========================================

Let your word belong in the manger of my heart and let me let it shine. Live inside the house of glory every day. Oh, let your word be in the manger of God. Let your word be. your worthy heart in the manger of God and let everything let it shine inside us all day and glory every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Father, Lord, we know, Father, you've put your seed word in our hearts, oh God. Father, we thank you for your love, your mercy, your grace. Oh God, we thank you, Lord, that you are heavenly father. You watch over us. You care for us, oh God. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you even now you watch over us, Father.

Oh God, thank you Lord that you reveal the truth to us. Oh God, thank you Lord that you open up the eyes of our understanding. Oh God, that Lord, we can be seated together now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh God, if now father forsaking all others, we sit under the Lord the comfort of your word and we pray Lord that your word will bring comfort to our hearts. Bring a word of faith. Oh God, we know that faith cometh by the hearing of the word. And Lord, we are depending on you even this morning. I pray Lord that you bless the hearer and the listener. Oh God. Father, I pray Lord that you bless the speaker. Oh God. And Lord, may all things be done to glorify your holy name, oh God. And Lord, may no flesh glory in your presence, but may you be glorified in all things, oh God. We love you. We appreciate you. We thank you, Lord, for the bread of life. We thank you for good health, oh God. We commit all things into your mighty hand. We ask your blessings in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I greet you all in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Good to be found in the house of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And I pray everyone is feeling good in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So welcome you all. Amen. I believe Brother Gabriel is here with his mom. &gt;&gt; Praise his mom. Yeah. Looks a lot like Sister J. I thought it was Sister J. Praise the Lord. Amen. So Sister Julie, right? Amen. Sister Julie. That's brother Gabriel's mom. Amen. And then we also have, you know, sister Premula. Amen. That we got brother Samir. That's brother Denel's mom. Pastor Denel's mom. Sister Sarah's grandmother. Amen. And these are all related. Gabriel's a cousin. Amen. And that's the aunt. So they're all related. Amen. So we pray they'll be blessed in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also see our sister there to bless you. May you be blessed in the house of the Lord this morning. Everybody feeling good? &gt;&gt; Amen. You ready for the word of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just speak a few moments. Amen. On &gt;&gt; you saying moments, but these are just moments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In his presence. So we'll we'll go to the book of um Mark. Amen. Book of Mark chapter 11. I want to speak this morning. Hallelujah. the season of the spoken word in the hour of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes seasons are opened up to us. But we need to know how to unlock the potential that's laying in that season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we are unaware of what a season presents to us, the opportunities, then we won't be successful in that particular season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm speaking on the season of the spoken word in the hour of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Mark chapter 11, we read from verse 23. For verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, remember that mountain can be your problem, your circumstance, your sickness, whatever it is, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, and he shall have whatsoever ever he saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ecclesiastes 3 and verse 1. Very popular scripture. Even Mark 11:23 is one of our popular scriptures. Amen. Ecclesiastes 3 and verse1 says to everything, &gt;&gt; there is a season. &gt;&gt; Whether it be your health, your wealth, &gt;&gt; your marriage, your job, &gt;&gt; the Bible is recording to everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a season. &gt;&gt; And a time to every purpose under the heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. A time to every purpose under the heaven. Amen. The Lord of blessings through the reading of his word. You may be seated while we continue to read in Exodus chapter 23. Amen. &gt;&gt; The next portion of scripture I'm laying here is to show you that in every season, the angel of the Lord is present. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know there were three great exodus. The first exodus, God took a natural Israel out of Egypt. Amen. &gt;&gt; The second exodus was when our Lord Jesus came. He established a new covenant. He took them away from the old law and he established a new covenant which was grace. Lord &gt;&gt; and now we're in the third exodus. Praise the Lord. He took us out of every denomination and he set us in heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is the scriptural backing showing you that behold I send an angel before thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are not alone in this journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an angel leading us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel of the Lord is here &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way. &gt;&gt; To bring thee into the place which I have prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "Beware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. For mine angel shall go before thee, &gt;&gt; to bring thee in unto the Amorites, Itites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Evites, Jebusites, and I will cut them off. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are not alone in this journey. &gt;&gt; God is here. Amen. If we are free to believe in him, he will fight our battles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you know our Lord Jesus even rebuked the scribes and the Pharisees when they came to him and he says here in in Mark 16:3, he says you can discern and say it'll be foul weather. &gt;&gt; Even today they sent out there'll be a level five weather warning for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the sky is red and lowering. He says, "Oh, you hypocrites." You can discern the face of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the time. &gt;&gt; You can't tell the season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Proverbs 15:23, it says, "A man had joy, but the answer of his mouth." &gt;&gt; And he watched spoken in due season, how good it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when somebody's sick and laying in hospital, a word spoken in due season, don't go telling me you're looking terrible. E, &gt;&gt; tell them you're looking good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak positive words over them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, people go through depression, they get fat, too. The first thing you see them, you tell them you're getting fat. They're getting more depressed. Praise the Lord. But the Bible is saying the word spoken in due season, &gt;&gt; how good it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 15:4 says, "The Lord God had given me the tongue of the learned." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then one more there. I just want to lay one more scripture in Proverbs 25:11. A wordly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So like we read to everything there's a season. Now we know if we talk about seasons, we go back to the Genesis account and we see in Genesis 1, God said, Amen. the lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the lights from the night. And he said, "Let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, right?" And we know then he set up the sun and the moon. But which one is actually set up for seasons? Is it the sun that's set up for seasons or is it the moon? &gt;&gt; We'll take our answer from Psalm 104:19. He says he appointed the moon for seasons. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know the sun is typing Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his church is typed as the moon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So is actually controlling seasons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's controlling the atmosphere of the age? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to be sitting in heavenly places. Amen. To have all things under their feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be under the circumstances, BUT WE OUGHT TO BE A PEOPLE OF PERFECT FAITH. THIS IS THE HOUR OF PERFECT FAITH. AND WE OUGHT TO BE SETTING the season and the tone for the hour. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULDN'T BE WONDERING, HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING? IN THE DENOMINATIONAL WORLD SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE PROGRESSING and they're doing this that and THE OTHER AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IS GOING UNAWARES WONDERING WHAT'S HAPPENING and just saying Lord I don't know what's really happening maybe you should just come and take us away NO BUT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE she is know she's marching to that step she knows where she is in time and season &gt;&gt; yes Lord &gt;&gt; the prophet says the word is in the bride she knows what he wants done with the word &gt;&gt; hallelujah Praise the Lord. So, I'm just showing you that the moon &gt;&gt; is a type of the bride, &gt;&gt; the wife of the Lord Jesus, and the moon controls times and seasons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we also know that a season can't last forever in the natural. &gt;&gt; Now, you're going through seasons in your life. It can't last forever because we know that a natural season lasts approximately for 3 months. And we've got to know how to work in that particular season if we're a farmer. Otherwise, we'll be sowing seeds in the wrong season. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There are certain seeds designed to prosper in certain seasons. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You plant a seed. Amen. You get different types of seeds. Right. If if you plant the seed in the wrong season, it that seed the potential will remain dominant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; The potential in that seed remains dormant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And nothing will happen to THE SEED. IT WON'T GERMINATE to life. Now many seeds are adapted to grow in specific seasons and they require seasonal conditions to break docy and thrive. We know they are warm season plants. I'll give you some examples. Tomatoes, basil, corn, beans require warm soil and air temperature to germinate and grow. These are planted in late spring or early summer. Amen. After the danger of winter has passed, cold season plants of spinach, carrots, radish, peas germinate and grow best in cooler weather. &gt;&gt; Amen. They can tolerate the the the winter. &gt;&gt; Now, gardeners, gardeners and farmers use planting calendars and information about local uh seasons and weather to determine when it is best time to plant their crop. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we find in our lives if we look all of our lives vary &gt;&gt; and all of us may be going through different seasons &gt;&gt; and some of us may be living life right now based on what transpired in the past. &gt;&gt; We should never live our lives that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I can't change the past. &gt;&gt; But I can change my present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; I am equipped right now with the most powerful word &gt;&gt; to change my current situation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my current if I change it now, I can then determine where my future will lead me. &gt;&gt; If I am walking in the paths OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, I DON'T HAVE TO GUESS WHERE this word will take me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This word will take me to prosperity. &gt;&gt; This word will take me to my ETERNAL HOME. THIS WORD WILL TAKE ME, AMEN, and lead me all the way to Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So in this time and season, you have within you the potential to break cycles in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the opening scripture that we read there, THEY WERE COMING TO JESUS TO ASK HIM, "HOW ARE YOU BEING A MAN?" REMEMBER, they had forgotten that this kind of a man WHO WALKED IN PERFECT FAITH EXISTED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. for 4,000 years had not seen this kind of a man. &gt;&gt; They saw glimpses of it in Moses. &gt;&gt; They saw GLIMPSES OF IT IN JOSHUA. &gt;&gt; THEY SAW GLIMPSES OF IT IN ELIJAH AND ELISHA. &gt;&gt; BUT TO SEE A MAN WALK IN PERFECT FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EARTH DIDN'T KNOW, CREATION DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS kind of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus called the 12, THEY WERE MARVELING AT THE ABILITY OF JESUS TO BE able to speak TO A TREE THAT WASN'T BE ABLE TO GIVE OFF ITS FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So they come to Jesus and they say, "How are you able to speak to the tree?" &gt;&gt; And now Jesus IS GOING TO UNLOCK A scripture to show how man is supposed to operate in a world of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm guaranteeing you that this is a secret. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that if YOU APPLY IT THE SAME WAY, &gt;&gt; if we put up Mark 11:23, then your results and your mountains will move, not can move, will move. &gt;&gt; Jesus now tells them, you want to know how I cursed that fig tree and spoke to it? He says, "Verily I say unto you, whosoever, &gt;&gt; not just the pastor, &gt;&gt; not just the evangelist, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST SOMEBODY CALLED TO MINISTRY, &gt;&gt; but whosoever will believe now, &gt;&gt; if you believe, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen." So, whosoever, so that includes all of us here. Yes. &gt;&gt; Shall say &gt;&gt; shall say &gt;&gt; not pray &gt;&gt; because sons of God are speaking in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the hour OF THE SPOKEN WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE ORIGINAL SEED THAT WAS SPOKEN IN GENESIS WAS THE SPOKEN WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We know brother Brandon comes to reveal that to us now that the spoken word was the original seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, whosoever shall say to this mountain, your sickness, your problem, your circumstance, your trial, whatever you're going through, your family, your children, your loved ones, whatever it is, speak to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be thou removed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell it what to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; Are we catching what Jesus is saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your problem what to do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your circumstance what to do. &gt;&gt; BE THOU REMOVED. NOT ONLY THAT, TELL IT WHERE TO GO. &gt;&gt; Tell it what to do and where to go. &gt;&gt; Be thou REMOVED AND BE CAST INTO THE SEA. &gt;&gt; Because even demon powers when they coming out of people, they want to go somewhere. &gt;&gt; They told Jesus, "Don't just leave us floating around in the air, &gt;&gt; but let us go into the pigs." &gt;&gt; Jesus told them what to do and where to go. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall not doubt. This is our part now. Speak to the situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell him what to do, where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't doubt. &gt;&gt; Now remember, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about spiritual things here. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your day-to-day trials and situations that you're going through. Speak to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak to the unemployment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak to that sickness. Yes. &gt;&gt; Speak to that unbelieving child. &gt;&gt; Speak to that addiction. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't just wait for somebody else to pray over it or speak over it. You speak. &gt;&gt; We are raising up an army of believers who have the spoken word in their mouth. It's the right season, but you've got to operate now in perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, don't doubt in your heart. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt. BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE SAYING IS going to happen &gt;&gt; and shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass and he shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord thank you. &gt;&gt; You know even in in Proverbs chapter 18 there it says death and life are in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; Now if you're going through a situation and you exalt that situation that's what you're going to have. You're going to have whatever you're saying. &gt;&gt; That's right. You go around telling everyone you're unemployed, you're unemployed. That's what you're going to remain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Speak life over your situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't go around. John Ryan didn't go around telling everyone, "I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even though physically he was blind. &gt;&gt; His confession wasn't extra extra. Praise God. I'm blind. Extra, extra. Praise God, I'm blind. &gt;&gt; Extra, extra. Praise God, I'm making ends meet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change your prayer. Lord, help me to make ends meet. &gt;&gt; If you got faith to pray and say, "Lord, make me help me make ends meet." Surely you can use that same faith to say, "Lord, help me to have provision for the next six months." &gt;&gt; Amen. using the same amount of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Just change what we are speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to have whatsoever you say. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, whatsoever you say. Now, if you put up Mark 9:23 there, you'll see Jesus is saying all things, not some things. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To them that believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; If thou can believe, all things are possible to him that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So maybe maybe you're stuck in a cycle. Maybe your family member is stuck in a cycle. &gt;&gt; Maybe you see that things are not working out right for you &gt;&gt; and you seem to be going in the same old pattern. Do you know that trials and and testings come our way because God is molding character? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if we do not learn our lesson or that character is not being molded, &gt;&gt; remember we're going up statue of a perfect man, we're going from faith all the way to love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if we're coming up with faith, we don't have faith, God's going to keep testing us until we get perfect faith. &gt;&gt; We need virtue. We need temperance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need temperance. We need knowledge. We need patience. &gt;&gt; God's going to keep testing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's developing character. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is this? It's the Holy Ghost virtues in the believer. &gt;&gt; Now we're going through the first situation. Someone stamps your toes. Let the spirit of marim arise. &gt;&gt; We forgetting now that Holy Ghost is in us. &gt;&gt; We want to handle it. &gt;&gt; It's not saying Holy Ghost handle it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't be handling situations based on human spirit. &gt;&gt; We are governed by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I am saying if you're going through a cycle, it's time that we break that cycle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's a difference between child training development. You can't break that and say, "Lord, you are trying to teach me patience. I break that in Jesus name. No, you're going to have to go through your trial &gt;&gt; and until you develop patience, he's going to take you to the next phase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about cycles in your life, generational curses. &gt;&gt; They tell you it's been all through your lineage. EVERY ONE OF THEM SUFFERED with cancer. &gt;&gt; And nine times out of 10, you are going to end up, "No, I break that generational curse." &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heart disease is running rampant through your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You ask people how they feel. &gt;&gt; Dangerous question. &gt;&gt; People love to tell you how they feel. &gt;&gt; They're feeling under the weather. They're feeling like this. They're feeling down. Instead of saying by the stripes of Jesus, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Ah, my my faith is not based on my feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, John Wright didn't say, "Praise God, I'm blind." He said, "Praise God, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; Until his body had to obey his confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep confessing daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep confessing. The Bible says, "Pray without ceasing." &gt;&gt; Keep confessing. Thank you, Lord, for provision. Thank you, Lord, for my finances. Thank you, Lord, for my healing. Thank you, Lord, for my wife. Thank you, Lord, for my husband. And thank you, you've already provided for it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's time that we can break these cycles. WE CAN BREAK THESE CURSES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER SPIRITS IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Spirits of witchcraft, spirit of demon powers, &gt;&gt; all of these countering forces. &gt;&gt; Now we should be able to understand that witchcraft cannot prevail over the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; If we are sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, WITCHCRAFT ARE NOT MORE POWERFUL THAN US. &gt;&gt; God has placed ALL THINGS UNDER OUR FEET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; people come now with their past. Whatever I've been through in my past, I've been through a traumatic experience. &gt;&gt; I've been through uh gender based violence. I've been through traumatic experience as a child. Amen. I've been through different circumstances in my life. And all of these things are weighing heavy on my spirit. and it's caused trauma in my life that now other relationships that I have, it's having an effect on those relationships. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we can break that cycle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If any man BE IN CHRIST, HE'S A new creation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OLD THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY. &gt;&gt; BEYOND ALL things have become new. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW GOD CAN BRING such peace to our minds? &gt;&gt; Yes. HE CAN CHANGE OUR ENTIRE LIFE. IF YOU'VE NEVER FELT PEACE IN A LONG TIME, WHY DON'T YOU INVITE YOUR LORD JEHOVAH SHALOM to come into your life and say, "Lord, let the peace of God come and settle on me, oh God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We can break curses. We can break cycles in our life. We can break anxiety. We can break depression. We can break worry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that at one time there was a season of partial faith. WE HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR that now. &gt;&gt; Amen. At one time it was A SEASON OF MUSTARD SEED FAITH. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT IN THIS TIME and season. GOD HAS CALLED US TO A GREATER FAITH. GOD HAS RELEASED A GREATER WORD. AND THERE'S A GREATER ANOINTING ON THE EARTH RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is not a partial restoration. We are in the fullness of the restoration. Amen. THIS IS THE SEASON OF PERFECT FAITH. AMEN. I WILL RESTORE SAY THE LORD. &gt;&gt; All the young the ONE, THE PL ONE, THE LOCUST. AMEN. AND THE CATERPILLAR HAS HEATED. I WILL RESTORE, SAY THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD PROPHESIED IN RESTORATION OF THE BRIDE TREE. HE SAID THE HOUSE OF GOD WILL LIVE AGAIN. THE TREE OF LIFE WILL bloom again. I say the tree of life is blooming RIGHT NOW. THE HEADSTONE HAS COME DOWN. CHRIST IS HERE IN THE MIDST of his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will resto the Lord. The problem is the season has changed and people don't recognize it. &gt;&gt; People don't recognize the change in the season. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO THEY'RE TRYING TO PLANT ANOTHER SEED IN ANOTHER TIME AND SEASON. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE season has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not a season of a partial word. The fullness of the word has come. This is not a season of a a partially open word, but the old word is open to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will restore, say the Lord. The season of restoration started in the days of Luther. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The season of restoration started in the days of Luther. &gt;&gt; In the days of Luther, I WILL RESTORE JUSTIFICATION, say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that season. &gt;&gt; BUT SOME ARE STILL STUCK IN THAT SEASON. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE CALLED the Lutheran. &gt;&gt; They are still stuck in that season. &gt;&gt; But we are not in that season. &gt;&gt; IN THE TIMELINE OF GOD, THAT SEASON has passed. &gt;&gt; Amen. But some of them are still planting the seeds of justification, trying to grow an harvest, TRYING TO BE successful in the season of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; But nothing wrong with that season. We also believe in justification. &gt;&gt; It's the first work. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; EVERYONE HAS GOT TO COME to justification. If you don't know what justification is, God has justified us. Yes. &gt;&gt; Even though we were guilty, amen, of our past sins and our mistakes through our first birth, God says it's as though you have never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Justification goes beyond forgiveness of sins. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because forgiveness of sins. You did it. You were guilty. I forgive you. &gt;&gt; Justification says, "I justify you." And it's as though as you've never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you've never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we understanding? The prophet says what justification is. &gt;&gt; It's as though you have never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the season changed from Luther and in the days of Wesley the season of sanctification was released to the church, &gt;&gt; holiness, sanctified life, clean life, &gt;&gt; but still at some still sewing seeds thinking it's still the season of sanctification. The Lutherans will fight the Wesians arguing about what season it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the season has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not the days of sanctification. Yet sanctification is a further work of that step. &gt;&gt; From justification, we moved on to sanctification. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Moving us now into that new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the days of Pentecost, the season changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From 1906, a man by the name of William Seymour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. M &gt;&gt; the zuza street outpouring &gt;&gt; all that wait now to 1946 &gt;&gt; till the angel comes to meet the prophet in the cave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was a season of Pentecost &gt;&gt; going out. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? Restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God had his prophet being born in 1909, &gt;&gt; growing up in this time and season under that atmosphere &gt;&gt; under that anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've got to know how to operate in time and season. Remember, God can do things to us that we will regret for the rest of our lives. Time and season came for the prophetic ministry to come in on the scene. And God told the prophet to go down to a group of people. He never knew his world would be rocked in such a way &gt;&gt; by disobeying God and not going to preach those people because he listened to his mother-in-law and that caused the judgment of God to come upon that city &gt;&gt; and he lost his wife and his daughter &gt;&gt; but could he have changed it? &gt;&gt; What would have changed it? Had he gone to those people? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Choices we make in life. &gt;&gt; Yes. We will have to live with the choices we make. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we can't escape it. &gt;&gt; Do you know that that really traumatized the prophet? Do you know that the prophet became suicidal? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The prophet took a gun and he put it to his head. He wanted to blow his brains out because HE FELT THE WEIGHT OF THAT. &gt;&gt; Losing his baby, losing his wife. &gt;&gt; One day he's out there. is uh is connecting and disconnecting you know electricity lines &gt;&gt; and he says I took that glove off &gt;&gt; and I had enough &gt;&gt; and I held on to that electricity line and he says nothing happened. &gt;&gt; Nothing can defeat the purpose of God for your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing shall be able to defeat the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God HAS DESIGNED SOMETHING ECCLESIASTES SAYS THERE'S A TIME AND PURPOSE. If your purpose is not done yet, you can't leave the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has still GOT A PURPOSE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Check if your neighbors breathing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell them then you still have purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that was the days of Pentecost. But then in Revelation 10:7, HE SAYS, "BUT IN the days &gt;&gt; of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; the season will change." &gt;&gt; I'M MOVING PAST THE RESTORATION OF THE GIFTS. NOW, &gt;&gt; I'm going TO DO SOMETHING NEW ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; All the time, YOU HAD WORD FROM THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU HAD MEN COME WITH RESTORATION, but this time I'm coming with a word from the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is not a word from the earth. YEAH. &gt;&gt; THE TITLE DEED that Adam lost in the Garden of Eden, I will bring that title DEED BACK TO THE EARTH &gt;&gt; TO RESTORE MY FALLEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AND I'M GOING TO BRING BACK THIS TITLE DEED so that you can have dominion over the earth. &gt;&gt; The time AND SEASON IS NOW FOR DOMINION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you heard me. IT IS NOW THE SEASON OF DOMINION. &gt;&gt; ROMANS 8 SAYS, AMEN. THAT ALL CREATION IS WAITING FOR SONS OF GOD TO STEP INTO that season of dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can't REMAIN SILENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE MUST SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. Amen. In the days of the voice of the SEVENTH ANGEL, HE SOUNDED and the season changed for the church. &gt;&gt; Not only did the SEASON CHANGE. AMEN. WE KNOW THE MYSTERY OF GOD WAS REVEALED which was Christ. &gt;&gt; CHRIST BECAME A REALITY TO US. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery. WE SAW HIM ALL THROUGH THE BIBLE. HE WAS IN MOSES. He was in the prophets. And we saw Christ. Hallelujah. The season changed when the mystery was revealed. The changing season brought a change in position of the bride. Because in the first seal, the season changed. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And now I no longer call you church." &gt;&gt; And because of the change of season, you've got to be able to cope with the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the effects of the season. Now, in this season, you can't be called CHURCH ANYMORE. I CALL YOU BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So each season and releases its own &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Its own qualities, its own characteristics, &gt;&gt; its own potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, not only did he change our position to call us, the bride. &gt;&gt; He then married us. &gt;&gt; WE BECAME MARRIED TO THE REVEALED WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We became married to the open word. &gt;&gt; And he changed our name. &gt;&gt; Amen. He changed our position first. &gt;&gt; Then he changed our name to Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That name carries authority. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know at one time the the Lord Jesus told the disciples, "Ask anything in my name." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He told them, "Ask anything in my name." &gt;&gt; Now you walk in the season where it is your name. &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? Amen. &gt;&gt; His name has now become your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His name HAS BECOME OUR NAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So when I'm asking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I'm speaking from the position of wife. I'm speaking from the position of sunship authority &gt;&gt; that not only heaven &gt;&gt; recognizes the authority BUT EVEN HELL RECOGNIZES THE AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; So the season the season changed. NOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU BECOME wife that you you need to be under headship. &gt;&gt; I think we all understand that very well. &gt;&gt; You have to be under headship. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, let's see what the prophet of God says here in what Isaiah 9 and6 meant. We all know that the government shall be upon his shoulder. We've been through this in the year. I just want to hit this highlight, right? To show you that you are not alone. Whatever you're going through right now, you're under the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He bears responsibility for you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; And if you feel that your provider is underproviding, &gt;&gt; you can go to him and speak to him. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. But my God doesn't &gt;&gt; underprovide. &gt;&gt; I call it a lack of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear what he says now. Isaiah 9:6, "The government shall be upon his shoulder." What does this mean? The answer, the government upon his shoulder come from the wedding ceremony of the east. When the bride is committed to the groom, she takes off a veil and places it over the groom's shoulders. Amen. &gt;&gt; Signifying that not only is she under his dominion, that she has transferred her rights to him, &gt;&gt; that he is the head, &gt;&gt; but also that here's what I'm trying to get to now. That he bears responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the care and that he and he alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one else. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NO OTHER MAN, &gt;&gt; NO OTHER POWER HAS ANY right and responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I didn't put that in caps. That's how it is written in the books &gt;&gt; for emphasis. &gt;&gt; God sent the Holy Ghost into the church. &gt;&gt; No denominational man system has the right or responsibility over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He alone has responsibility over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He alone will take care of you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he says no other man, no other man can shower your wife. Where's the married brothers here? &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you like other men to come shower your wife with gifts. All the brothers are getting very jealous now. They're very angry. &gt;&gt; Let me test the others. Let me test it the other way. I don't know if your sisters will receive gifts from other men. &gt;&gt; It depends what it is. &gt;&gt; But it works both ways. &gt;&gt; You don't receive gifts from other men. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's saying no other man, no other power has any right or responsibility. &gt;&gt; Right? And that beloved is the key of David. God being sovereign, he forneew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose she did not choose him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Woman don't be choosing your men. He chose her. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Otherwise for the rest of your life that man will tell you, I never choose you. &gt;&gt; You came looking for me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose her. She did not choose him. He called her. &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is? &gt;&gt; Women are by themselves. Now they're sitting with a problem after they married. This woman was here minding own business byself. That man went called her for nothing. They're driving past boy men. I don't know. they're driving past, they'll screech their brakes, they'll slow down, they'll hoot, they'll do all of these kinds of things because now she's sitting with all the problems. Now you're inviting her to come to you with all the problems. Now you're sitting with their problem because you don't find your woman on the street. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he says he called her. She did not come on her own. He died for her. He washed her in his own blood. He paid the price for her. She belongs to him and him alone. She's wholly committed to him. And he accepts the obligation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is ahead for Christ is the head of the church. And Sarah called Abraham Lord. Even so, the bride is happy that he is our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He speaks and she obeys. That is her delight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But have men heed to the truth? Have they esteemed each person who alone has full sovereign authority? So Jesus Christ should have full sovereign authority over our lives. Amen. That's what I'm getting to. And one more point I want to get here. The government upon his shoulders, he says that's a part of his body. That's his earthly strength. &gt;&gt; The God who made the universe, the God who created the heavens and the earth, his earthly strength lies in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we reading this? What the prophet saying? Amen. &gt;&gt; God's earthly strength is in his word made flesh in his body here on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, very quickly, I want to go through this. I told you that he has authority over you and he has responsibility over you. &gt;&gt; Don't take my God lightly. God has provided all areas of your life. Let's go through it quickly. As as Jehovah roi or rafa, sorry, Jehovah Jehovah roy, the Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; You'll find that in in Psalm 23. I shall not want. So he's made provision to lead and guide you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; AS JEHOVAH GYRA, THE LORD IS MY PROVIDER. &gt;&gt; Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for my physical needs, I call on Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the seven redemptive names are locked up in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he's our married husband. &gt;&gt; So he has got to release these redemptive rights to us. &gt;&gt; Redemptive blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. as Jehovah Rafa, the Lord my healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when I'm sick, I am the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah Shalom, the Lord my peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Ni, the Lord my banner. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Septinu, the Lord my righteousness. And Jehovah Sharma speaks of his presence. The Lord is there for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when you are fighting your battles, you are not alone. I'm going to give you two scriptures to show you that God fights your battles for you. And God goes before you to prepare the way for you. You've just got to walk in that authority and know that he is fighting your battles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; See, in the first Exodus, the Lord is saying, "I will send before thee." They are going to fight a battle. God is sending on before them, which shall drive out the Elite, the Canaanite, the Hittite from before thee. God will send honors to already clear the way. &gt;&gt; God will make your way clear. Somebody receive this. God will make your way clear. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He'll make your pathway free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, give me skill and wisdom and understanding to be debtree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will be be able to awaken that faith within you. &gt;&gt; And he'll be able to get you out of debt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How? Using who? Don't look to the left. Don't look to the right. Don't look to the front. Don't look to the back. God will use you. God will give you wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God was able now to clear the way by sending ornaments before them. I will not drive them out from before in one year. Lest the land become desolate. See, so now if if men don't inhabit the land, the wild beasts are going to come into the land. So he says here, "Lest the land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against thee." So God is strategic. He's releasing it to you little by little. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Don't be ungrateful with the provision. &gt;&gt; He's releasing it to you little by little. &gt;&gt; He says, "Little by little, I will drive them from before thee until thou be increased &gt;&gt; until you get the capacity to handle it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Until you get the necessary staff, until you get the necessary skill to be able to handle it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And inherit the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the land was theirs to inherit, but God is for their own protection is going to release little by little according to the ability in which they able to operate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go to Joshua 10. Here again, we'll see it came to pass as they fled before Israel and were going down to Bethon, the Lord cast down great stones. &gt;&gt; They're fighting a battle. God says, "You know what? I think you need supernatural assistance." &gt;&gt; God cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Ezek and they died. &gt;&gt; There were more which died with the hailstones than they which the children of Israel slew with the sword. We don't know. Sometimes we walk unconscious of the supernatural realm and we don't know the amount of uh demons that are being slain through angelic beings clearing the pathway for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why David could say, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For thou art with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you awaken, Amen. Don't think you're going alone. Yeah, &gt;&gt; beside goodness and mercy that follows you. The angel of the Lord goes before thee. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You are protected. &gt;&gt; You have divine protection. Don't worry about all of these presidents and things. They got G20. They think they're looking so cool there in their black cars. &gt;&gt; Protection services, VIP. They are nothing. Brother Sunny was telling us other day with depreciation, they're not even worth 84 cents. But now because they got some title now they carry themselves out. These old men you see how old they are. &gt;&gt; They got power now. They're meeting G20 summit bodyguards protection. &gt;&gt; I have higher detail security detail than them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A son of God is higher security detail. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at Elisha. That boy was the the that boy was so concerned. Elisha, how you going to fight off these armies? &gt;&gt; Hey, I got a security detail you can't even see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, Lord, open the boy's eyes. &gt;&gt; Let him see what's encamped around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let him see the oath of army that's encamped around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are protected. &gt;&gt; The one who you are married to has protection. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Other people getting shot, other people getting murdered, other people, Amen. things are happening to them. But the Lord is your protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is your guide. &gt;&gt; Hey, I don't rely on South African economy. If we're going to rely on the South African economy, &gt;&gt; we are going to be living by the South African economy. &gt;&gt; We've got to be living on another economy. &gt;&gt; We got to be living on the economy of heaven. &gt;&gt; That the Lord is my provider. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord provides for me. I am not in lack. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. For those of you that were saying amen, silently, inwardly, you need to say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, &gt;&gt; speak. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I'm here to open up mute mouths. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the ability to speak. &gt;&gt; But you can't recognize the season. &gt;&gt; So, I'm telling you to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got to be able to speak. OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH. DON'T BE SHY. AMEN. If you CAME TO SOME HIGHRANKING official that told you, "I'll grant you whatever you desire," like maybe Esther, even to half the kingdom, &gt;&gt; you're going to you're going to say, &gt;&gt; when somebody says speak, you speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, sometimes you want to help people and maybe a beggar &gt;&gt; and you must see how many excuses they'll try and give you to try and make you give them the least. &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; You ask the next beggar how much you need. Hey bro, not too much. You know, they'll tell you a whole lot of story how much they don't need too much. That person probably needs thousands of rands. &gt;&gt; But they'll tell you no nothing, man. Maybe just give me something for some bread. And we don't even give them the amount for the bread. I give them five rand for another 15 rand. &gt;&gt; But when God is saying ask anything, &gt;&gt; don't be shy. &gt;&gt; Don't limit God. Do you know your entire family dynamic can change? &gt;&gt; Your family situation can change. &gt;&gt; But you got to afraid to believe it can change. &gt;&gt; You can believe as a parent, my children are serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; My children are walking uprightly before you. Amen. &gt;&gt; My whole family is saved. &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what they are going through, you speak that word over their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Situations will work themselves out that they have got to align to whatever you have spoken. &gt;&gt; It may happen little by little, but it is happening. &gt;&gt; That little grain of sand is moving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So we can see that God fights our battles. God goes before us. Amen. We know the disciples, as I'm closing now, the disciples were ordinary men. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came in on the scene and Jesus walked in on the scene, they took note of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There was something within them that recognized, hey, the season is changing. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is this man calling us? Can you imagine you're fishing there, minding your own business, someone comes and says, "Come follow me." &gt;&gt; What would you do? &gt;&gt; You're fishing there. You're a wild man. You're a wild fisherman. Amen. And somebody says, "Come follow me." What will you do? These men had something within them &gt;&gt; that heard that voice. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; A stranger they will not follow. &gt;&gt; Peter left fishing. James and John left fishing. &gt;&gt; They were in a successful business relationship. &gt;&gt; The sons of Zebedee. &gt;&gt; They were all in fish fishing business. &gt;&gt; But they forsake it all to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is calling you today. &gt;&gt; Young man, young woman, God is calling you to follow him. &gt;&gt; What choice will you make? You know, God didn't tell them, uh, you know what, you're leaving fishing and all of these things. They didn't bother where their provision was going to come from. &gt;&gt; If I leave a successful fishing business and I follow you, who's going to take care of my family? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter was married. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's not I don't know if it's recorded, but I don't know if he had children. He had responsibilities to for them to forsake all of that. Who's going to provide for their needs? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jehovah Gyro was not locked up in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah Rafa was locked up in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he could heal the sick. &gt;&gt; When there was time for provision, he didn't say, "Go get a fish. You'll find the tax in its mouth." &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be able to unlock what you need from within him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So these men recognized the they WERE ORDINARY MEN DOING ORDINARY JOBS, LIVING ORDINARY LIVES. BUT ONE DAY AT the changing of the season, they met Jesus. And when they met Jesus, everything changed. &gt;&gt; How many of you can testify this morning when I met Jesus, everything changed in my life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The entire life changed. THE ENTIRE PURPOSE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; THE ENTIRE GOALS AND THEIR VISION CHANGED. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; And you know when they were looking at Jesus in Matthew Matthew 8:27, the these were the disciples that are speaking now when Jesus now awakes from the ship and he speaks to the winds. The disciples marveled. The men marvel saying, "What manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him?" &gt;&gt; They knew that this is no ordinary man. &gt;&gt; THIS SEASON HAD CHANGED. THERE'S NOW A GOD MAN ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says here when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly becomes a two-fold being. So these men move from being ordinary men to following the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One of the earth to die, one of heaven. In his body is subject to death, but in his soul is passed from death unto life. And that's where we are right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are supernatural beings. &gt;&gt; We are twofold being. The prophet is saying one of the earth to die, one of heaven. Which one will have a stronger force? &gt;&gt; The one you feed more. &gt;&gt; The one you feed more. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I we need to change our confession. I'm not an earthbound man. &gt;&gt; I am not an earthbound man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am heaven bound. I am sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not waiting to be redeemed. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE WAITING to be redeemed? &gt;&gt; The price of redemption has already been paid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The title deed of inheritance to the earth has already been given back to man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting for the title D to come back. &gt;&gt; Come on. We can't be reading the Bible and thinking it's a future prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not waiting for the title D to come back. I am not waiting for Jesus to come out of the sanctuary and go and take the book. &gt;&gt; That has already happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not waiting now for Revelation 10:1, the mighty angel to come back to the earth. That has already happened. &gt;&gt; We've got to recognize the season. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The season has passed. I have the title D to the earth. Then if we have the title D to the earth, dominion has been restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have the title D to the earth, dominion has been restored. &gt;&gt; So we walk with dominion authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we can walk into hospital rooms. &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the entire ward get discharged. &gt;&gt; You know the testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There were there were different ailments, different sickness. All three women, one prayer. Next morning, all three discharged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Completely healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Pray for a sister with a bone sticking out of her hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bone goes back into place. Pain is gone. What is that? Dominion authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Doing outreach in the field. The man comes and he says his lungs are finished. They gave him up. They said he's got a few months to live. He's got to live with eight 10 tablets a day. &gt;&gt; One prayer of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The next time you go there, he comes running and he SAYS, "I'M IT WORKED. IT WORKED." &gt;&gt; Completely healed. &gt;&gt; Dominion authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. HALLELUJAH. GOD BYPASSING PROCEDURES. &gt;&gt; GOD BYPASSING PROCEDURES. PEOPLE BLACKLISTED CAN'T GET VEHICLE FINANCE. GOD CAN BYPASS procedures and they get vehicle finance. &gt;&gt; That's fresh testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can take you back to the time of Jesus. And I can take you back to the time of the disciples. Those we don't doubt THOSE TESTIMONIES.
