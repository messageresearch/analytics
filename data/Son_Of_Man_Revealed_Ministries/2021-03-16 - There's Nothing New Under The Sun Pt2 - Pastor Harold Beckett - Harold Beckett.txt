========================================

and we can see all those patterns unfolding in the bible and now we are back in the evening time we are back at harvest time so all the bible now become end-time scriptures so there's nothing new under the sun what we see here today been played out in some form in some type and some shadow and we are not a shadow we are not attacked but we have the fulfillment of all the types and so we can see that everything around us our achievements our natural birth as a beginning and it has an end a trials has a beginning and it has the name of life you might say well i'm in a heavy trial but that trial has a beginning in a trial it has a beginning somewhere that it began and at the end of the day that tribe will come to an end it's like a vapor it's like a grass it has no enduring substance nothing that we go through in life is enjoying everything has a season of time and as the messenger said we have no continuing setting the clothing that you have beautiful beautiful dress it gets old beautiful home it gets our beautiful car it gets all whatever we have in this life nothing we can take with us because it is natural it is seen but the unseen is more real like what we can say and god already made the unseen world before we made the singing world and there's a theophany already waiting for you before you on the earth brother bannon was laying next to his second wife in a mortal body and he was talking to his first wife and he says quickening power took me to the other side i saw all of you over there so you can see there's a there's a real world this is only the scene world this is younger world that we see we see the buildings we see grass we see eels we see atms we see all those things around us but the unseen is more real what we can see and so everything is mixed it's got joy it's got sadness sometimes you're very happy and sometimes sadness comes in your home sometimes there's a little baby being born you're happy new life has come in a home sometimes there's death in your home and you become very sad and life and this life is that life it's got death and it has ups and it's downs he has mountains and valleys it has health and he has sickness sometimes you're very healthy and the next moment you are sick sometimes you have mountains you have valleys you have and each one is unique that god has made us and every city has its own beauty the urban has its own beauty cape china has its own beauty elizabeth harter wherever you go every set he's like a female it has his own beauty and so we can see god reflecting himself through the universe because god's nature was his first bible so we are born again by the word of light and as long as we on the earth brother bannon says we'll have a sticky nature that will always bother us there's going to be a nature of the 90s that's going to come in your body you're going to behave like your grandfather and you're going to behave like somebody in your distant family and that's all pressed into your body you're born again you're in the messy church you love the lord you're a preacher you're a deacon but the nature of the ancestors or the family is traced right within you and brother manning chased that little german boy and his mother was his father was irish his mother was german and he says i wish that little boy never get married because he will give any woman hell on the earth because of the traits of the family that is inbred into you and sometimes you see your father in you you see your grandfather reflecting backing your children and you you wish that wasn't there but brother manning says as long as you're in this body you'll have a sticky nature that will always bother you but on the inside you are born again and so we are born again and that will always bother us because we have light and we have darkness and we go through a continuous cycle a continuous cycle things go good for you then things goes bad for you again and then you become moody you go ups and you have your ups and downs but god is the one who is the one who gives divine revelation and revelation is there not to give you information not to win every argument to show that how much they're clever you are but revelation is overcoming power revelation brings humility and revelation brings god to you again and so nothing that man is invented as any enduring substance weak weapons of science they can make ventilators they can make oxygen machines uh they can make so many stuff but it's all called weak weapons of science and it's got no enduring substance god was the one who breathed the breath of life and man became a living soul so god's breath is more stronger than any weapons that science can produce and so our homes our cars our clothing uh it all gets old uh we can say that's my new home but it gets old uh your home that's you can say well that's my home but that's that home is not really you you can say well that's my cell phone but that cell phone is not really you you can say that's my body but that body is not really you it's only a reflection of another one is waiting for you amen and so we can see god is a bodybuilder god designed mortal bodies god designed theophanies and god is also a designer of glorified bodies so we have three bodies most people only know this body and that's the only body that looked to and that's the only one that keep healthy but there's another body that is more greater than this one and so we can see for all of us life has rich joys life has got rich joys and happiness your kids are university they go to college and you have joys and god is fully earth with goodness there's bananas there's advocate of pears there's uh there's so much you can enjoy the fruits of the field and everything around god gives us rain god gives us sunshine god gives us health god gives us a word god gives us a family and as many people are praying for a baby and god has blessed you with five children and so god is the one who gives us joys and gives us happiness and we recognize that joy and goodness is all around us all around us we can see there's goodness there's joys there are people that are happy and we can see the joys of god and god made different varieties of fruits thousands of different fruits and god is my third certain herbs of the field and everything that you need for your body is in the earth amen because your body comes from the earth god make garlic with the properties of the garlic to become antibiotics god has made the lemon with antibiotics with the ingredients in that lemon that can heal your body god has made ginger god has made turmeric goddess make hand pepper goddess made all the herbs of the field to heal your body so everything is in the body when your forefathers never went to desk or went to a pharmacy they went to the back of the yard your mother knew exactly what tree to go to your mother would take a leave from the tree boil it up and give it to you and you were better your mother was a pharmacist because you knew exactly what you need for the human body because the human body doesn't live by any pharmacy but it lives by by the fields of the fruits of the fields that god has given on the earth and everything that god has given for the human body is right in the earth and everything you need for the journey is right in the message you don't have to go anywhere else rapturing fake lies in the message changing the body lines in the message because it's got resurrection seeds the messengers said that other robots are pentecostal seeds and uh billy grahams of evangelistic seeds but malachi 4 so resurrection so if the seeds if your earth is the seed of the ground and you sow the seeds of malachi 4 it will produce another mannequin amen it will produce rapture in grace it will reproduce whatever if it worked for the man that ate it it will work for you as well amen because the seeds that you sow and that's why your mind is such a tool in the hands of god that's why satan wants your mind and god wants your mind that's why social media has destroyed people's minds and it's manipulated people's minds what they're here i'm seeing in fox news and radio show and radio this and news and what's ups and and all these viral messages is there to destroy your thinking right but god wants your mind for the first time we can think like god we can now talk like god we can think that god had a threefold mystery in the back part of his mind so now what was in god's eternal thoughts and we can say before god was god and you could say before god even made lucifer god already and put my name in the landscape now you can't say that that william branham came on the scene and took us before genesis he says we can say in the beginning but i'm going to take you before the beginning so we can see that we experience satisfying sights and sounds and beautiful sounds of the year and we enjoy smells we enjoy tastes we enjoy adventure and it's got riches and it's got many joys many people are happy they some days a day vacation for them they can enjoy the ocean they can go scuba diving they can climb the mountain they can do a hiking trip and many people have beautiful sounds and sights and everything around the universe goddess bless the universe but so many things but at the same time we must face reality that life is full of trouble amen with all the joys and all the happiness and all the sights and the sounds and and with everything that god has we must understand our life is full of trouble man that is born of a woman is in a few days and full of trouble you can leave durban and go to australia trouble will follow you you can leave levin and go to america trouble will follow you you can go to the best church in the world trouble will follow you because you have internal trouble you have external trouble it doesn't say man born of god but man born of a woman is full of trouble so troubles are part of our journey and we have all those things that is coming us but the bible said that the unseen is more real that what we can see so what we look at today there's nothing new under the sun job lost his children he lost his cattle uh he lost his feels he lost everything and even his wife said why didn't you curse god and die now you can lose everything you can lose your husband you can lose your wife your daughter your son and yet you have everything because you have god job lost everything and yet he had everything and he has god once you have god and these revealed thoughts for the day you have everything because god is the sum of total perfection and so we can see that job says man is born and troubled jesus said in this world you will have trouble so jesus said be in this world you have trouble and james says you will fall into various trials so jesus said father uh in this world you have trouble but he be be not discouraged i have overcome the water amen so uh we understand you're born under trouble the earth is nothing but a testing ground you are tested with a family you wonder now why did my mom leave my dad why did this happen and why do i have to struggle why was i born under this country and why would i be this and and but god has allowed everything to come your way amen and god has designed every trouble everything in the church and brother bannon says that god can split the church in half and god can give you a sick bed and god can turn all your friends against you just to prove that you're receiving them amen so the message is not dealing with groups it deals with individuals it's not a group revelation but it's an individual revelation and that's why god has allowed that rhonda virus god to restruct it and what god allowed it to bring out underlying ailments with people there are people that will never come to church again because it was laying there dormant in there and whatever is underlined it will surface up and so god put pressure on us and the pressure that god puts upon us is to bring out the good that is within us and so none of us can question the fact that life can bring disappointment we can't question the fact that life or great disappointment uh it is it is it is filled with unexpected terms terms that you don't expect today you can be healthy and tomorrow you can have a sick bed and tomorrow you can be an invalid tomorrow somebody has to pick you up and somebody has to take you to the bathroom somebody has to shave you and today you can be healthy and tomorrow things can turn around unexpected turns then we find there is sudden deaths sudden accidents you dive down the road one morning and somebody loses with breaks goes into you and then you have an accident you phone your mom i'm in hospital i'm in bed and they put me off for six months to get healed again but god knows the end from the beginning god knows how to chastise us how to bring the best out of us god had to actually send blast moses out of moses god to him of the wilderness god had to give brother venom i took away his wife to the way his daughter and he wanted to commit suicide twice but god had to do certain things to bring the best out of it and so god will do certain things and use certain things to bring the best out of you and so we find that uh today we are healthy and tomorrow we are sick unexpected turns revenge in life you have your rain pain then sickness strikes your family you have your bone pain you have security up your home and you put the fence up and you put security out and that thickness strikes your heel and your children brings you shape one of your sons is daddy i'm going to divorce my wife i beat him this marriage for five years but i call naked she's dominating she's dominating my life and she will say daddy i'm leaving this man because man is an abusive military slave driver and so we find you have unexpected turns and you're looking for a time when wilder's all sees when will this all seems that you don't have any trouble any corona virus no wearing your mars no eating bad foods and when are we gonna have there's no jealousy no anger no hatred uh no fighting and there's gonna be peace and we're all looking for that day when we leave this earth we go into a body that is called supreme breast and joy and so we can find that life that's like the longer you live the wider your experience the longer you live on the earth the wider will your experience be and the more people you meet there will be more pain and more difficulty if you have a big church you have lots of trouble if you have a small church you have small trouble if you have no church you have no troubles but it's part of journey and you can have a family church and you're going to family problems and you can be individual in your home and you can have a beautiful home but don't happy in that home you have china where you have everything to your heart's desire and yet your husband doesn't love you he doesn't do things for you that you really feel like you're a woman and so you find that the material things of life doesn't give a joy the only joy you find is to find god and the message of the hour has made god very real to us amen it took god from history and made god present to us he took god from before genesis and he took god right back in the beginning and gave us the big picture we could only see the small picture every minister will preach to you denominations can only preach the small picture but we see the big picture we see why god has allowed us and why god has purposed that and god even designed his own enemy if you ever thought about that that lucifer was was an associate pastor the only thing he couldn't do he couldn't create but god designing it and god even the left against open god allowed sin to come into the earth if there was no sin there would be no sickness and if there was no sin there would be no death but if there was no sin there would not be a savior and if there was no sickness he would not be a healer so certain things that god had to allow in his permissive world but now we can see the bigger picture amen why god did certain things the outside world said god is unfair the outside world says you must do this and we must do this to go to heaven god says no i've already chosen you before you chose me and i love you before you even love me so you can see it's not even your struggles but it's all what god has done for you you're never asked to give me an entire message uh you've never prayed lord please say to william branham please send malachi 4. you'll never knew about you were in hindu you were in some church in some organization you never knew nothing about the end time god but god already knew that he was going to be in the bible yeah god really sent him took him away again took him home and yet you are thinking uh you're thinking that i'm just in the church and so like and so sometimes you might think that our burdens is unique what i go through as the family is unique but it's the same old trial somebody else has gone through and you might think what we as the nagy family go through nobody else has gone through we we are unique family and you touch one of us who touch all of us because we are very special we are unique and uh there is nothing but there is nothing new under the sun somebody else has gone through it somebody else at this very moment is going through worst things that you go through somebody else has lost his own entire family somebody else has done things that and maybe going through things that you will never dream that you will go through so we can see there's nothing new under the sun and we see the nature the nature has nature has perpetual life it produces the same fruits all the time same apples for six thousand years there's been apples uh there's been bananas there's been avocado pears there's been peaches and apples and uh there is in the herbs of the field perpetual life it's been producing all the time there's nothing new under this earth you know next season is going to be mango season you know the fishes of the ocean god has designed everything for humanity and so we can see that our troubles are trials as a beginning and there have an end they are not eternal that's why hell is not eternal hell was designed for the devil and his angels if you have eternal life and you go to hell you will outlive hell because you see you cannot be in hell if you have eternal life eternal life means you will never had a beginning you never ever made it all's got a beginning he's got a name so it was designed for the devil and his angels and so we can see that we've been placing the earth to be tested and we have bypass of the effort now the question is which body did god first make the first god make the mortal body or did god make ethiopia god friends made your theology and god took a picture of me and in that picture god never saw you smoking drinking god saw you perfect amen and brother branham says you you bypass your author you recognize the message of the hour to the eagle food you hear from your theory amen so what is god doing god is now influencing you back from your therapy there's a body on the other side that looks like you got the same features same eyes same texture when you were young uh brother bannon says when i saw them their eyes was glistening like the stars of heaven their teeth was as white as squirrel and there was no yesterday there was no tomorrow it was perfection and so you can understand there's a world that is more real than this one and so we've seen we've been placed on the earth to be tested we have bypass autophagy and we are in this body for character molding so god molds you you have a temper uh you're impatient and you have several things that you have in your life and god has to mold you maybe you are addicted to pornography addicted to the internet and god has to now work with you and god has to give you heavy trials to detox you from that so god knows you can spend hours and hours watching social network and god wants to have your time in your mind for him so god has to do something to detox you away from that and to give your attention to god that's why the toronto virus was sent by god god has allowed that to bring the best out of you and so we can see that we did not decide to be here and you never decided to be there amen and you had no choice coming to the earth and you never decided to be a naive or ready or a chatty or or or the crash or whatever you certainly might be you had no choice and in that certain family there was an inherited disease there was heart failure in that family there was mainly there was arthritis there were sugar beaters in their family and you inherited because of your great grandfather so suddenly brother bannon says becomes inheritory and also sickness travels through genetics and also your christian birth travels by the genes of god you are what you are because you are part of god and you are what you are because you're part of a certain family and you are what you are because you were born by adam and adam all died in christ all is made alive so we did not decide to be here and we had no choice of a family you have no choice of gender i wish i was a male and i wish i was a female but god made you a female of god made your way and our faith is not a pain-free life our faith in christ is not pain-free you don't come at the message to be pain-free sometimes when you commit a message you have more troubles that you have when you are in denomination what troubles come by you say well is this really the message of the hour maya there's no love here and but god allows that god allows everything because god wants to deal with you not with love not with food parcels but god deals you with divine revelation so god wants to get a hold of you so you look at love you look at who preach you who gives you a full parcel who's love you who hugs you and who's kind to you or i'm going to join that church because there's lots of love in that church there's nothing to do with that it's a view of divine revelation and so you see we have to understand that some people view serving god is about life here and now it's not about life here and now it's about eternity you're not on the earth to create legacies i've got so many churches i've given up so much money i've done this and i've done this for god uh you're not on the earth to create the legacy amen but you're on the earth to prepare for eternity and so we can see what a paradox into the natural male and sin under trouble he cannot see joy in trouble and james has counted all joy when you fall into trouble now a natural man he cannot see a joy he wants to commit suicide he wants to take his life he goes to the bar he drinks himself he cannot see god in pain and suffering struggling and he's breathing to survive if god would ask what would you refer in life we would we would prefer a life of trouble free if god would ask you what would you refer in life you will say god i want the life trouble free i want to love everybody i don't want any trouble in the church i don't want to trouble my family i want my grandkids i want my children to be nice and i don't want trouble because you're on top of your life but life when you pray for a life of comfort that's what we do in our normal natural being lord protect me from this and lord save me from that and don't let this happen to me i don't want suffering if i feel sick lord make me well i'm i'm while depending on others to help me we pray that we said lord if i'm sick make me better a lord give me good friends and lord do this for me do this one but god knows how to bring the best out of you amen and sometimes you are moody nobody's upset you you're just feeling moody because god has allowed that so that you can pray and you can say god please take the spirit away from me and brother bannon said the only way to calm your nerves is prayer amen you can go to descent you can buy tablets up the tablets and your bathroom can look like a small chemist of all the antibiotics you've never taken the full course and this and that and this is ebola but all those things will never help you it's got side effects the only thing that can help you and save you is almighty god and so we can see an immediate response to the trial is a prayer lord get me out of this trouble that's the immediate response when we're in trouble lord please get me out of this trouble lord take me away from durban take him away from my family i don't want to be with my in-laws i don't want to be with them i want to be somewhere else i can live a lot but god has allowed you to be in a certain situation and god has put you in the message for trials and god has put you in that you love everybody you love your pentecostal friends you love your methodists you love your neighbors god has chastised you this is not a cult that you join this is god dealing with you amen and so you don't hear people pray lord i'm in great trouble keep me until your recovery is what you want to accomplish nobody prays lord if i'm in this trouble please lord keep me we don't hear prayer requests coming lord but the girl wants more trials and more suffering no he wants more money he wants a better job he wants to go for interview we always have requests for something that's good we don't have requests but sister mary wants to bring wants you to bring something into a life that will draw away from sin and material things that is hindering the growth you don't hear that pray brother jack wants a trial at work for god to give you more patience and remove the spirit of envy and jealousy we're going to hear that we always ask for success for increase a better job better home lord make me well my husband he seeks my children he said lord do this do this but we don't ask for trouble but god says county dog joy when you fall into it because behind it god is dealing with you and so brother managing down everything that has been we ask for prosperity and we ask for a better lifestyle that's what politicians carry a vote for us we'll give you a better lifestyle we'll give you better service delivery we'll clean your roads we'll do this for you just put your mark on us and we will do this for you and brother madam says that herod was a politician and jesus identified all politicians as foxes can't inherit the fox and the fox is very slight he'll tell you something he'll do something else but that's why we can put our faith in god in the message of the hour because that's what our strength lies and that's why if you want to be spiritual strong you've got to read the word you've got to take a book a week and feed upon it and if you don't understand just read it it doesn't matter if you're if your mind is unfruitful but if you feed in the world you're feeding yourself if you eat bananas and avocado pears and you eat healthy fruits there's something in the body is you eat the fruit in five minutes time you eat all that food the wife can take two hours to prepare that meal and in five minutes you can consume that food but organs in the body will take over and then supply the kidneys they will supply the lungs that this every part of the body will be supplied and so the moment you eat on the message of the element take the book take a pen write down if you take one book for one week or one book for one month feed upon it and by feeding upon it you're feeding your soul and as you feed your soul it will bring your spirit and your body in subjection to that the reason why people are struggling because they're not feeding and the reason people are doing things because they're not feeding they are what you eat if you eat if you eat methodist food you'll become a methodist if you eat baptist food you'll become a baptist if you give pentecostal food you'll become pentecostal if you get messy through it you'll become a massive believer because it will produce after its own time and so people are seeking a better lifestyle we review things temporarily and we view things materially and we do things physically everything is temporary everything is materially everything is physically what we should be praying is for perfect faith amen because brother madam says perfect faith is the master of all circumstances once god gives you perfect faith you've got a master's degree a degree that you can handle opposition you can handle a stubborn wife you can handle a stubborn husband you can handle maybe an abusive mother-in-law you can handle a colic at work you can handle another pastor you can handle false doctrine you can handle anything that comes your way because you've got a master's degree that's what god wants you to have his perfect faith in his work knowing that god has allowed things to happen and god has purpose the things that will happen so that god can chastise you and bring the best out of you what we should be praying is for trials what we should be praying is for trials because that's how our faith is perfected god affects you by trials that's why brother man says god can turn your family around and god can split your church you know and god can give you a sick bed and god can do this and god can do almost anything just to prove that you can handle it and that's why we thank god today we are not here because that we wanted to be in the message we never prayed lord please i want to be in the entire message lord please i want to go to heaven you're already in heaven before you come to the earth jesus says i come from heaven i go back to heaven jesus said that one that you see me talking to you i'm also in heaven so god is that dealing with temporal things and god doesn't give you temporal things god gives you eternal things that's what the message of the hour doesn't come from jeffersonville indiana it's not the intellectual property of william bannon but it's the voice of god it is god trying to deal with you as an individual because in the midst of suffering christ will display himself amen in the midst of hard times in the midst of suffering nullified for went through suffering but and god would let him speak things in existence and out of existence god never said brother bannon go out of the storm and then you speak the storm god says go back in the storm and once you're in the storm now you speak the storm of existence so god doesn't take you out of your troubles and out of the things you go through but god puts you right back there and god says now i want you to speak the storm of existence just imagine that we are now having a mosque and one day they're going to go from the mosque to the mark and they won't be able to buy you won't be able to sell it they can do force you to have a vaccine that you won't be able to employ as a teacher and you won't be able to employ you won't take a policy or discovery unless you have a vaccine certificate and they're going to force you and force you and one day you won't be able to do things and there's certain things that you have to take your stand the midwives took their stand they would not circumcise and kill all the children and god was with them and the midwives let every israelite be born so there's a time in your life that you will have to take a step you'll have to come against the system and god will have to come on to you the third pool is not going to be behind the pulpit some brother from america some brothers from africa this is a fantastic brother he's behind the platform he's the man of the hour no the turtle will go home with you and god will let you eat that one chicken for the whole month amen and god will put vitamins in that food and god will supply things for you in your home that you'll never dream that rule what stores will never provide for you god will be right for you because god is god and so we can understand that god is going to pressurize us and god is going to allow the system god has to give the roman system power to do what they have to do and no amount of protests no matter fighting
