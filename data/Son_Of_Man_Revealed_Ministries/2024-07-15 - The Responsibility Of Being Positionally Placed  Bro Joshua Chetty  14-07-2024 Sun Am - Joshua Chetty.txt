our pastor has gone out in a Hillary assembly assembly there they gone to G to preach the gospel and we pray that he' be a blessing unto them amen amen we know that God has ordained us for the season for this time that we living in uh we could have come out in the first church age we could have been born there we would have been anointed for the age we could whichever age we was born in we would have been anointed for the age but God has anointed us to be Overcomers in this age amen amen in the darkest of all ages amen the prophet had to put light there because why he knew there to be a people that will come forth in this hour amen amen in the hour of gross Darkness light has come our way amen he said Shalom arise and Shine the Light is come amen this light is not for the whole world Amen this light is given unto you amen so you are empowered so you will impact amen with you will shake Grace upon the Earth amen and I believe that we are on a spiritual battle this morning I believe that we are here on the earth we're not here in the Millennium as yet amen we are here in the land of the Holy Ghost and in the land of the Holy Ghost was typing when Joshua had given the inhabitance to the children of Israel they have to go and Conquer territory yes amen they had to go and fight amen they had to go and defeat the enemy to take what rightfully belong to them amen amen and we come as Sons and Daughters of God we are ear to the kingdom amen amen and this Holy Ghost Kingdom that is given unto us we have we have to take on territory amen because why in this hour we are fighting demon powers hell is Unleashed upon the Earth amen you you got to be sensitive to this amen the word has come to sensitize us that Al is been Unleashed on the earth Satan found a way to the fourth dimension he's found a portal to bring the fourth dimension to influence the fourth dimension and bring hell upon the Earth therefore you find 200 million demons in different places amen into your governments into your scientific into your Educational Systems into your everyday life you find you are faced with demon powers so as much as you faced with that God has got his army upon the Earth amen God has got his generals he's got his he's got his special uh special type of uh equipment that he's given us which is his word amen and he's given us all his equipment to equip us to prepare us for every onslaught of the enemy so we can be we can be satisfied like the other people said you know what we are don't those are giants in the land we are like grasshoppers to go and defeat these enemies or we can be like Joshua and Caleb and say this is our land this is our inheritance we are more than able amen amen amen if you got your Bible this morning you turn to the book of Galatians read from chapter 4 amen you happy to be the house of God this morning amen book of Galatians chapter 4 now I say that the heir as long as he is a child defer nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so he is Lord of all right but he defer nothing from a servant as long as he remained a child now we know even in the natural a child cannot remain a child amen a child has to grow yes now for the child to grow you got to give him natural food and to give him natural food and stimulation and he will grow so he cannot remain remain the same amen there has to be a progression in his life but he under chors and governors until the time appointed of the father now the chers and governors in this for us is the Holy Ghost that's our guide amen even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world so we have the guide that is tutoring us and the guide is working through the five4 ministry amen amen amen so even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world so when we come new babies in Christ drinking the sincere milk we also were in b AG because while we had this we kept asking ourselves H what is our identification are we eternally saved are we do we have the Assurance of what is like on the other side that's why when we were babes coming into the coming into Christianity amen being first saved and then what happened you was kept in bondage all the time until they come a time there's a progression in your Revelation yes where you know as you were known amen will you now know as you were known oh yes amen and when you have that perfect love casted away all fear amen now you are no longer in bondage amen amen but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that way under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons amen and because he are son God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen you may be amen we also turn quickly to the Book of Romans 12 reading from verse 4 and 6 for Romans 12: 4 and 6 for we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts deferring according to the grace that is given to us where the prophecy let us prophesy according to the procreation of Faith so just showing that once that scripture there Romans 12: 4-6 there's many we are many members but we are forming one body amen and we all don't have the same office but we all have our inheritance amen and we are here coming under this message to what to be positionally placed amen the Holy Ghost has come like how Joshua types remember in the Old Testament Joshua is positionally placing the children of Israel according to how they were birthed amen amen when the mothers when the Israelite mothers were giving birth to them they gave birth to them and na them according to their inheritance amen and then Joshua comes and he places them according to their births so just like that the Holy Ghost comes and places us according to what our bir because why we were predestinated God already for knew all things and he predestinated according to his purpose each one of us we're predestinated according to God's purpose amen and there comes a time when the Holy Ghost comes and positionally places us amen but this morning we speaking on the responsibility of being positionally placed amen they come the responsibility to be positionally placed amen a lot of us can say we have a lot of us can say we receive this message we receive all the word but they come the responsibility amen and not many people are willing to take on that responsibility amen many want to shy away from that responsibility because in this hour you are not a called to just be a church member yes amen this is not an hour to call you call upon and say I I believe God sent a prophets oh God sent us the pull of fire God sent us the opening of the word this is not the hour for that amen we have received that we have received God sent a prophet God sent a prophet for a purpose he sent a prophet so there can be a people on the Earth that will come to adopted Sons and Daughters of God Amen there will be a people on the Earth that will take on the responsibility of having proper sunship amen they will come of full age they will come to maturity amen because why we have speaking to a Corinthian Church here amen we are speaking to an Ephesian Church yes amen we're not speaking the time of having your air long and and wearing those long dresses those things were to pull you out of Egypt those things were cleaning you out of Egypt this is a time now when you are taken out of unbelief when you are totally separated from all unbelief and now when you are totally separated from all unbelief now you can come in the presence of God and receive from the heavenly manner amen that which was hidden from the from the world that was hidden to everybody else is come to the children amen because why is that me to give the children's bread to others amen so it comes with responsibilities we are called to be faithful stewards of what God has given us amen sometimes this message has become too common to people but we're forgetting there's a sacred trust that church is a female and there's a sacred trust upon her amen she's required to have a certain virtue about her she's required to have a certain character about it amen God has not called us to be sful in this hour God has not called us to be AIT about the things in his kingdom amen because why we are representing the kingdom of God and if you are an ambassador of a country the prophet of God said if you are an ambassador you will go and represent every about your country now if you are ambassador of your country you can't go to a foreign land and represent another country amen you got to represent your very own country so we are an ambassador of the kingdom of God we can't be living here in this foreign land right now in Satan's kingdom and represent the world yes amen amen we can't be representing Satan's kingdom we are representative of the Heavenly Kingdom amen father as it is in heaven so let it be on the earth amen may may they be one even as we are one there must be this Oneness there must be this Union there must be an Harmony between God the father and US amen there must be this on with us amen you must become because remember we bypass the word but we are becoming the word we become so much the word of the word that the people will eventually see Jesus Christ walking again in human flesh amen amen amen the Bible in Luke 48 12:48 says For unto whomsoever much is given much is required now there's never been any other age where much was given there's never been any other age where the fullness of the word has come down where no stone has been untouched amen and he given us all the land to inherit but yet there's much territory to regain to gain amen amen because why between the time between now of receiving spiritual adoption in this hour and between the changing of the body amen there has to be a people that will come and represent Jesus Christ upon the Earth there will be a people that will have signing power they will have there will be a people will say this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter yeah because why Revelation 10811 said thou must prophesy again before Nation tongues and Kings now who are those people there must be a people that will prophesy again yes amen that's why he can say this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter yeah amen because why she becomes the final voice in the final age who this bride under a messenger amen but he can't just say yeah if there's no you not taking the responsibility if you there's no growths amen if you're going to remain stagnant in your work you still confused about your identification you're still confused whether you are saved you're still concerned about whether you got a place in heaven no these things should be open to you amen there must be a personal revelation of who you truly are that the Gen of God was placed in you amen that you are part of him that you always been a part of him that you are the representative on the earth amen and then you come to know him the way the way he operates amen and how does God operates watch him through the world word watch him through the scriptures he doesn't change his ways amen he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore if the church started at a certain time this in the alpha church amen they were there in the upper room amen the because that was the Jewish church amen that's how it started off but when it moved to the Gentiles God was moving one by one individually and that's how he's moving with us right now amen we are not just gathered in one place and we expecting now the Holy Ghost just to come down in one place God is dealing with individuals amen amen God is dealing with individuals in that way get a man set apart here get a daughter set apart yeah amen God is dealing with you in that way amen and then God said this is my son now the Holy Ghost is shoing him he said right this is the son that's responsible he knows how to handle my word he know what's what I want done with the words yes amen and now I can give him that responsibility now when he speaks the word it must be according to as he spoken amen amen yes that's why he could say his Prophet you spoke it you speak it amen he said I don't go you already spoke it amen wait there till it come to pass amen amen so the prophet emphasized the importance of understanding our position in Christ he thought that adoption is not merely something theological amen like how the how the how the church World sees it but it is a something transformative it's a transformation that's taking place amen you always you remember nothing can change your sunship that's something that's already predestinated the gene of God was in you amen if you got the god gen in you it mean the DNA is within you amen but now to come to adoption it's a transformative process amen there's a process where you as a Son of God are walking in the things of God amen amen when you first come in you'll have all the you come in with all your sin you come in with the S of the world you come in speaking lies you come in smoking your cigarettes you come in still drinking you're coming still using V languages you'll do all the things but there's a transformative process for in this word there's a power of transformation thank you God is able to change the violence that's why you don't write anyone off amen thank you Lord God can take the violent Sinner and transform their lives than that's when the prophet went he lost the the field for the people and he went off the scene God had to show him back amen he said no you lost the feeling for the people people amen then he had to get the feeling for the people again and then go back on the field because why God was still dealing with people the fact that we are here upon the Earth right now it means the grace of God is still upon the Earth amen Grace will leave the Gentile dispensation when his bride leaves the Earth and then moves on to the Jews but between then and now God is dealing positionally placing his sons in the Kingdom amen now each one of us had different purposes to play in his kingdom each one of us there a different parts yes don't be jealous of your brother's Parts cuz God is dealing with people at a different level now if God dealt with your brother and brought him to maturity and he's progressing the things of God don't be jealous about it be be be glad and say God is with my brother look at God in that man that God is that sister amen and then you pray for them and then you'll see your part being fulfilled amen stay within your position oh thank you Lord amen and what God put you in be faithful in it he is a little thing when God say right this brother this sister this son and daughter of mine they've been faithful in this now I can give them something else I can place them to something else now they must go into another Frontier amen they passed this battle they pass this Battle Ground let me let me take them to a bigger Battleground thank you Lord amen let me take them to conquer more territory now thank you Lord amen so it's a transformative process amen it's the power of transformation that is taking place they changing us what we don't realize we changing from Mortal to immortality but it's happening From the Inside Out amen there's something taking place on the inside and this transformative thing that is taking place each time we are getting more and more in tunee with it we are getting less Earthbound Hallelujah he taking away the magnet that's keeping us the gravitational level that's keeping us grounded upon the Earth amen why we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are now soaring into the heavenli amen we are looking at things to spiritualize amen we are looking to at things from above we are not looking at things through Satan's hidden we are not looking at things through the five senses because why we defeated the five senses you bring it under subjection amen as you coming now to a mature Son of God you bring your senses to subjection amen because why you're a faith-based person amen yes amen so we find that as galatian 4:47 says when the fullness of time was come God sent for his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem that we under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent for the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore thou no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen amen we an air yes amen amen we an air of our father's inhabitance amen amen who can take that away now that is already is written down God's law cannot God's word cannot change let every man's word be a lie but my word be the truth no one shall add to this no one can take us from that so you an A so why are you worried now that's right you can't be walking in this hour living in fear you can't be walking this hour living in anxiety living underneath your privileges Satan wants to keep you that way Satan doesn't want you to know who you truly are Satan doesn't want you to have a revelation of your true inheritance amen they you an a of all things amen yes amen amen Satan doesn't want you to know that so what he wants you to do he keeps you H bound he wants you to be tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine he wants you to be fussing he wants you to be murmuring he wants you to pick on this brother pick on this thing pick on that and brings you all confusion of doctrines taking away from the true word of God taking away from the leadership of the Holy Ghost the true guid in his hour amen who's leading you to the promise amen who's leading you to a land of inheritance am keep your eyes fixed on Jesus amen amen he's the author and the finisher of our [Music] faith so we find that we are actually transitioning right we don't realize that but we are transitioning because every day you find that your your Chase B already changed correct yes you you see I can't be trapped in this pest anymore Lord amen you you see the things around you you know when everyone's talking confused everyone is uh in fear everyone is panicking with the economy everyone is panicking with the the walls on the earth everyone's panicking with the political situations and the crisis around the world you know that you are transitioning see for God to set up his kingdom there has to be an end of another kingdom right so you see the ending of this Kingdom right now you find things happening around the world Russia is getting triggered by NATO and so forth all these things are happening why but everyone's wondering why the tension is so high but everybody is wondering why it never lead us yet to World War II that's because when the mighty Angel comes down he suppressing the powers yes amen amen he's holding the he's holding the winds he holding the Ws and Stripes because you are on the earth yes amen there's a quick short work for you to do before you leave the Earth amen so we find that this as we come into this process of adoption people don't want to take the responsibility of taking going and studying the word for himself going and spending time surrendering thems to God now if you going to partake of all the garbage of all temporal things how are you going to absorb Eternal things amen where you going to have time for the Eternal things how are you going to grow you I mean a lot of people are interested in in growing the Flesh in progressing in material things in progressing in how they can advance in this life in everything else but how many people are really interested in spiritual maturity in spiritual growth because everything else in this life is yes amen amen all your riches where are all the great Empires where are the great pharaohs where are the great Napoleon and so forth all the great Europe and all his kingdoms yes where are they everything is temporal amen but we have received something Hallelujah that this world knows nothing about amen yes that we can hold to cherish to our hearts because we know these are Eternal things amen but it has substance amen faith is a substance Hallelujah of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen amen and therefore when the doctor come and give you a bad reports you say no I've got substance amen you are giving a medical report I've got substance amen you give me bad kidneys in your report my father says he can take the kidneys out and he can put a new kidney in because whatever I loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven so I loose that bad kidney and I now I put now you speak a new kidney there amen what is impossible with our father it will be according to Thy word that's right amen even as you speak it will be according to your word amen for as many as are led by the spirit of God now how can you be led by the spirit of God if the there's no room for the holy ghost in your life if you never create an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to be in your life you made him unwelcome in your life how can you be led by the spirit of God Amen if you want the Holy Ghost to work in your life create an atmosphere yes you know the prophet said he's a gentleman amen the minute you think bad thoughts the minute you do evil things he takes away his flight so you know how to bring him back pray him back let there be an atmosphere in your in your life let the hly Holy Spirit lead you let the holy spirit guide you amen amen can you believe can you imagine a life without the Holy Ghost then you need to think back before you received this word amen what a miserable life that was what a terrible life that was how your life was just you you it was you can't explain there was an emptiness there wasn't vacuum in your life but when you receive the Holy Ghost amen and you know Satan is so clever thank you Lord Satan is so you know what Satan does he knew you was having the craving for something he knew you had his vacuum so what he did he brought every other thing he brought every other fleshly desire the lust of the Flesh and the lust of this life he brought all those things front of you that's right amen but we thank God for his grace amen amen that now when he bring this what he takes out it burns out everything burns out all the drust burns out everything that is not of God Amen that's why we lay aside every weight of sin everything that the enemy brings in amen and that's why now we are able to resist the devil the Bible says resist the devil and he shall flee so we find that as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear amen so why you see what what what we had before for we had a spirit of bondage so when you find that in people are in fear and anxiety they still have a bondage upon them people are the devil still wants to oppress them and you know what what is the greatest fear when people are not sure they they know that their life is temporal right and they know there's the ending of their life and they're not certain and they don't have a revelation of what happens when this life ends but you know that you always was amen that you never began in the first place you was always in the thoughts of God you you was in Eternal thoughts of God hallelujah amen and if you never began in the first place you can't end because you an eternal son and daughter of God yes amen amen there only came a time and season when you are to be manifested but this is hour now when people can take that responsibility then there must be manifestations of Sons and Daughters of God this is the what I'm talking about now when you take that responsibility amen when there the responsibility of being positionally placed then there must be a manifestation amen amen there must be a manifestation that you are son and daughter of God Amen and the manifestation must be everything that Christ was you must be yes sir amen amen everything because you are you are who is with Christ all that was in God he pour into Christ all that was in Christ he pour into his church each one of us have a portion of the Holy Ghost but when we are fly framed together in the body we are a fully functional body amen and this is the body of Christ upon the Earth again Christ walking now in bright form amen Christ upon the Earth in bright form now each one is not fasting with the other true true son and daughter of God with a true revelation will not be fasting and and murmuring and so forth but you realize I am positionally placing in my part of the body here my brother positionally plac another part of the body here my sister positionally plac in another part of the body but we are the mystical body of Jesus Christ amen and Satan hates that he don't want his body to come into Unity so he made his false Unity he brought the World Council of churches he brought the ecumenical movement he brought all the other unities together because why he hates this Unity because you know when this Unity comes on the earth then what happens on the earth then God is on the earth working through a body amen he bring God back on the earth Hallelujah God was working in a oneman Ministry God God came down upon the Earth through William brandham amen but now God is upon the Earth working through his body again amen doing the Greater Works in the hour amen Satan AIDs that he don't want to see this body United together he don't want to see the Believers coming today positionally into a position and being placed amen amen he don't want him to take responsibility he rather have them out there like the prodical son was out there took his things out there but the father amen hallelujah the father with his arms open he's still waiting and says son no matter how long you take I'm still waiting for you but when that son comes home amen when that son got a revelation amen everything in my father's Kingdom belongs to me amen amen I am rightful here my father can never kick me out of his kingdom I will always be his son I went around the world I did this I did that but I cannot change by status as being a son amen and when I go there my father will receive me amen amen that's why true son and daughter can always pick themselves up thank you amen you can't leave them down in the gutter they will picks up and realize that I'm a son and daughter of God hallelujah thank you Lord amen amen thank you Lord sometime we go into spiritual Amnesia forgetting who we truly are but amen the holy the preaching of the word comes to remind us amen that you are son and daughter of God Amen it's time to progress in your work amen it's time to not remain stagnant in your walk amen we want to possess all the land that's given to us this is all our inhabitance amen no one else to take this inheritance from us amen maybe you left the land so long there might have been squatters there but it's time to come and remove the squatters from the land come and take the squ out of your land amen because why you left it too long but it's time you don't don't be merciful towards the enemy amen don't be merciful towards the devil and his IM amen yeah come and R out every evil amen remove them from the land create an atmosphere let the Holy Ghost come into you it's not the god with us anymore it's God in us this is the hour of let God above us this is not the God our of God with us this is the hour of God in us amen Christ in us the hope of glory amen so what happened when we receive this word we transitioning from servants and to Sons and Daughters amen because a servant is got everything there but the son as the full rights the full Authority as the father amen there's nothing different when he puts a signature there from the father putting his signature there yes when he puts his signature there is as good as the father amenallah it's done said it's a sign deal amen that's why now if you say to this mountain amen be thou removed it shall be removed yes he never said if you say in the name of Jesus Christ be thou removed he said if you say Amen because when you say as a son I'm talking about when you are now mature you come to adopt adopted son when you are positionally placed in your rightful position then you can speak as a son and daughter of God Amen what places the people it was the is the teaching of the word amen that positionally places the people yes amen because you know the you know the story The the prophet give that illustration about the lady that had a son that went to work overseas and he had this fine job and then she was at home and he'd be sending her the things and she was thought he just a card nice she thought he just a nice picture on it and everything but he were sending all those dollars and she was in poverty and then she got sick and she wouldn't she wouldn't have money to get those things need of eventually what the social workers came and checked on there and they said don't you have any family then she said yeah I got a nice son don't you hear from your son yes I do hear from him he does send me those beautiful things you know the postcard they said can we see that when we looked at it she said lady your son has been sending you so much of money so you could have got your medication you got everything that you needed everything that you have need of there to come now and teach her what she had with her now just like that the five4 ministry is coming amen and showing you what you've got with you amen all this word is given unto you he's not given to you for nothing he's not given to you to lay on your sh he not giv you to say oh what a lovely cat this is oh he not giving you say oh I know more than the denomination I know more than the theologians you see they don't know they ignorant that's not what it's come to do it's come to make amen it's come to give you to show to place you as a son and daughter of God he say right now that you are coming to mature as a son and daughter of God now I can say the children can say this is he did well this is your son he passed the test he passed this test oh he passed the test of lust he passed the test of suffering for the cross he he passed the test of of giving it all oh and sacrificing everything for this gospel oh he loves your word so much amen he pass the chest he knows how to handle your word that's what this message is given so you can manifest Jesus Christ upon the Earth amen he not come to make you just have some fancy quotes have some fancy theology yes you see how dest it can be amen people can settle for security yes what am I talking about oh I got security I believe the true prophet of the age I'm An established messy Church we've got church order and Doctrine we've got the correct baptism we believe in the true godhead we believe in serpent seed and you just settle like that just a just a person ah they let the other people preach I'll just listen to them no impact upon the Earth no difference in your life to the people of the world outside there no value when you speak when the when when the the Bible say when the apostles spoke the people were astonished at the things they spoke yes amen amen when you speak with confidence as a son and daughter of God people will be astonished at the things you are saying people must be astonished by your life yes that's saying that you are just a normal uh person you can have good works Indus can have good works uh Caba devotees other chrishna devotees Buddhist Muslims can have good works it's that your good works then going to save you there must be a difference in your life amen you come from a royal priesthood amen you're coming in this hour to an image of Christ yes sir you're coming as Kings and Priests in this hour you're coming to the image of Christ in hour amen God has formed you in his own image and that's what this word has come to do to bring you back to the image his word is coming to bring you back to full Redemption the only thing that has to be left the only thing is a body change the complete part of the Redemption apart from the body change until the body change takes place you must come back to what Adam lost yes you must come back to have dominion again Adam had full fellowship with God he can't be in God is saying Adam Adam where are thou Adam you say Lord here am I I'm in fellowship with you Lord amen invite him into your heart create the atmosphere let him come in the cool of the day amen like how he come to be one with Adam amen he come in the cool of the day and dwell in adamen amen and that's why Adam was the god man on the earth man God dwelling in his son and that was lost and you think that God was happy with that when he was lost no God has went started the Plan of Redemption immediately amen amen he killed the lamb there he know to be blood amen he started the work of redemption because why he needed to draw his sons back to him he wanted that Fellowship so badly amen and you think God is happy with us with this right now God wants his sons and daughters to have fellowship with him to come and commune with him amen yes amen that's why he says God in us we can't make that statement God in us but there's no atmosphere for God in us amen if it's God in us then people must see God in us amen amen when you got the Holy Ghost people must want to be around you that's right amen people must be attracted to you you must be like a magnet you know when you walking with the Holy Ghost the there's such an anointing around you that people notice there's something peculiar about you there's something different about you or you can be like every other negative human being that's what a human beings are right now you're not just like every other human being you're a spirit being you hous in a flesh body amen amen your house in a pestil in a in in a body that's rotting amen hallelujah so you find that we're living now like in this flesh our flesh the same as everybody else's it's every others it's same as your neighbors same as your your workmates your colleague mates your family members but inside inside there the great planter amen yes Hallelujah the great s amen he came he predestinated inside of you because why there was a bing ground inside there amen like how Mary had to have a bedding ground and said be unto me according to th word inside here there was a bedding ground for fate to fall in the sour now Faith couldn't fall anywhere else the beding ground had to be right amen because everywhere else there was a beding ground for doubt everyone else out of the predestination there was a beding ground for doubt but you had a beding ground for Faith amen and we had the beding ground in this hour so this Faith seed could grow the promises could grow amen the seed of promise that was within us it could grow amen that's the difference from every other human being and how did God know that but predestination amen he predestinated us because he said in his word whom he predestinate he justified and whom he justified he also glorified that's God's purpose that was God's plan amen but every time we had a revelation of this it wasn't easy you had to go to pain and suffering it's just like birth pains every time you had to go get a re every time there was a progression of the word it come with pain and suffering when God brought the prophet on the scene before the prophet could go out he had to go to pain and suffering he had to lose his wife he had to lose his daughter amen but God was calling him out amen because why a new chapter was taking place Hallelujah upon the Earth and therefore in your life you have to give away the things of the world you to die to self you had to be expelled from your family members you had to be hated amongst your work colleagues you had to be persecuted for the for the things that you were believing when you first were coming in because remember there was a transition taking place you are to now change change your lifestyle change the way you think and you began to get persecuted you began to be mocked you began to now bear the cross for Christ amen yeah amen and then we find that as we come in the word now it can't remain the same each time there has to be a progression remember we we are drinking from the inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen the the person that says they know it all there's something wrong with them then they denominated if some person and tell you we've got everything open to us we know everything the whole word yes the whole word is open to us the word is open it's already open portal is open but the Holy Ghost comes amen and we draw from this inexhaustible Fountain of Life his mercies are renewed every day amen amen so we find that this word is not stagnant it just progresses and progresses amen one bomb drops there from there drops to to another bomb to another bomb to another bomb amen it's like the splitting of atoms amen so so there's a crying out there must be a crying out you find that even here we know that we we there came a time where we realize we couldn't remain the same there was something wrong but there was we didn't realize there was a craving within us for more amen because why Holy Ghost must full on Holy Ghost amen yes but there was a claiming for more we were wasn't just satisfied with saying hey now I I received this message I'm I'm happy now I'm just going to church every week no we want to be a people that will have an impact on the earth amen we will be the they need to be a people and we are Believing by faith we are that people that Moses and Elijah is going to testify about that there the people that met the Rapture there were the people that walked with God Amen people that had an Enoch work amen in this hour there were the people that was one with God there were the people that displayed Christ upon the Earth there were the people that when they spoke things came to pass yes hallelujah amen because why this is the hour of the third P amen this is the hour when the anointing comes upon us that now we are known as we were known amen am [Music] so we find that when every time God is doing something God was meeting your C God was meeting your desire so if you want more of God if you have the desire God will meet the desire that's right amen but if you want to keep God limited no I'm just happy I'm just happy with that I'm just happy with that I don't want to progress anymore Lord you stay with it true amen but he blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen the prophet of God said is is a code where he says God don't want us he want us to live abundant lives he doesn't want to deliver underneath our privileges yes the reason why you don't have because you don't ask and when you ask you ask in other words you're asking in doubt you ask without believing that it will happen but you forget what you ask there's a substance amen amen but when you come into maturity you when you ask when you speak it's God speaking it's the same as God speaking because why you have that signing Powers now amen because this is the Holy Ghost saying this is this son of yours he's done the work he's passed the test and he says this is my beloved Son I will honor his words amen amen hallelujah amen yes Lord amen the find when Jesus came on his Transfiguration amen and he went into a glorified body there on the mount amen he has to be on the mount amen because why just typing that they on the mount and then people out of the out of the city it's like typing the he typing the Millennium amen and then we had Moses and Elijah amen they left another dimension they came in this Earthly Dimension right there it was showing the people he showing the disciples right there Peter James and John see these people there life beyond the grave they left another dimension Moses which body was packed away Elijah which went up but they left the denomination back in the theop there and they're showing there and they were there but they were still in the prophets they were still as prophets amen because why you still keep that character amen but you notice that m was typing he was on the he was typing the deading Christ which will rise first Elijah was typing the resurrected translated Saints amen but you also had Jesus in the glorified body then you had Peter James and John who typing the 144,000 Jews amen and they will be coming and then you had people at the bottom of the mountain typing the nation that out of will come out of the City what all those things were doing it was rehearsing the kingdom amen but as much as all those things were taking place God was showing yes my son who was faithful to me who was obedient to my word he said now this is my beloved Son yeah he give me it was showing them an adoption ceremony and after the adoption ceremony took place yes most Elijah knew this is our time to go yes because why this is adopted son of God amen amen yes this is now the adopted son of God so he came as the first sh did and then he comes in this day amen there in Sunset mountain with another Son of God now he's using a Redemptive body he's showing right that was right that was a perfect body but here has a Redemptive body now comes as a cloud Cloud appears Amen to show right here the adoption year of my son Redemptive body here the first shield of other Sons and Daughters will come where I am now dwelling in Redemptive bodies amen oh thank you first she wave before us amen so if that has already happened and he said to us and he spoke to us in 1959 when the sco came to existence he said all these things must happen yeah this is only he showing you an example of what must come to pass then what must happen in the many membered body oh yes amen amen when you say to this mountain be or anything that you say anything that you ask for will come if you pray believing it must come to pass if you pray and you believe that's right what you say it shall come to pass it must come to pass amen he didn't say go ask your pastor to pray M he said when you pray yes amen so if if you got a situation out in the field yeah out in the world somebody needs healing somebody needs Deliverance somebody need salvation do you have to call the pastor to pray who are you amen that is what the pastor is here to empower you the pastor is there to teach you the pastor is there to C you for the coming the preaching of the five4 ministry to for the equipping of the Saints so they all come in the full statue of the fullness of Christ that's what their job is to do so if he's equipping you then you can't remain that person say know I'll call my pastor I'll call some from church what are you doing there they can't see God in you they can't see that you are son and daughter of God then what's the difference from the message that you got and from what they teaching the denominator you have received a message for a purpose that's right Amen to show that you are not an ordinary person doesn't like them you got to have that Revelation you're not like walking around like every other human being it's got to come to your realize you got to live up higher amen the problem is we're living too much here we need to come up a bit higher amen that's why he call us up higher come up higher he said John come up higher get a revelation of who you truly are John yes get a revelation of true what's your true word John that you're an a to all things amen amen get a revelation that you have the signing Powers amen hallelujah the word has come to bring us to spiritual maturity amen amen so the placing of a son takes responsibility Amen to be positionally placed it takes a responsibility takes a responsibility of a surrendered life it takes a respons being separated from the sins of the world Amen it takes a responsibility to go and pray to study the word yes a lot of people like to there's nothing wrong to have fellowship with the word with the people I love that I love to have fellowship with people I love to have hear the preaching of the word but there comes the time when you need to be alone that's right and if you don't have that alone time with Christ he's going to be you're going to be one of those and says depart from me now workers of inqu I know you not it means you don't know him you don't have a personal relationship with him you haven't become one with him they must come the time where you don't want to be around people you must become educated there have to be that personal time where I have to have a closet time amen I just don't want to be around anybody I need to be I need to be synced with him amen amen and trust me if you want to benefit spiritually that is your best time that is your best time when you have that a long time you don't have to shout and pray you don't have to scream and Hollow and let everybody hear you amen amen I'm telling you now you'll see the greatest testimonies is that secret prayers amen that secret time with God you'll get the best revelation of the word you have a better understanding of the word amen is a secret time with God then you come out and have fellowship and be a blessing unto others amen you come and have fellowship and share your light with others that's why before the service on the Sunday morning people should be having their quiet time with God Fellowship in prayer with God prayer fellowship with the word and then we come there's a mighty outpouring of the holy spirit amen we each one coming with a licks of fire amen amen each one coming is an anointing that comes over the service amen and then whatever comes in if there now there's a brother or sister down whatever Spirit they become with that Spirits can't car in the presence of God it must depart amen yes amen now that's the church that that's that's the continuity of the book of Acts hallelujah amen so in this age what a privilege we are Imagine seven Thunders come to literally turn our hearts back to the Fai of the fathers why it couldn't happen in other age why they happen in this age because why you see Sun like like the plant right the sun just can't come and Scorch this the plant the seed it'll it'll with but the sun has to come in progression am just like that light had to come in progression if the opening of the word come in lud's day they would have died out in W's age they would have died out but they had to come little by little as light was needed light was given and now it's come oh I tell you now it's coming now in its fullness am amen that's why the because now it's a time of maturity in the time of M the Sun comes amen and it come in his brightness amen amen making the word clear to us clear to us but that's why even when you were first coming in everything couldn't come to you you didn't understand the thing you couldn't you could say I came I knew everything no every day we learning every day we progressing because why God knows how to give light as light J amen he doesn't want to scat you out and just push your way out you might have just left the message there he knew how to bring his word how to share light to you amen he knew how to open up his word to you so we find that as life was coming in we had a little life when fought in uh in Luda amen a little tessel the stock began to grow and then the tessel and then the Shar amen but then when when now the Sun watch out the Shar life had to go from because the life must go back to the grain now amen as life was coming into the Grain and the grain was drawing the life the Shar had to die out yes that's why there was a time still tearing there was still some movement in the Pentecostal World there was still some Crusades and all going on but now the shack died out there's no life there amen don't be deceived there's no life at all amen sir because the life is fully in the grain amen amen now you are drawing from the life amen you are drawing completely from the vine now amen because why you are part of the vine Hallelujah you are drawing the full life of the vine so that life that in Christ is also in you amen it's his blood your blood of his blood his DNA everything about him is in you his makeup is in you you can't you can't have another DNA it is DNA completely in you amen and now you have the life amen you have his nature you have his characteristics then it must come with power and demonstration amen if you have a life because he Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so all these things the supernatural must take place amongst you because this is a supernatural God the thing we try to understand God to Natural Things sometime we read read our Bible to the Western idea of reading the Bible maybe you need to look at it through the Eastern I Eastern way because the Bible is written the east yes that's right so that's that's the way we look at things we look at things through what we T by science and we look at things naturally you can't be carnally minded with the things of God because it will bring forth this amen but you got to be spiritual minded amen so these are the responsibilities that it is it takes now to bring forth to embrace our positions amen and to be good stewards of what's given to us to be faithful in what's given to us and then to impact to have an impact Amen to take what's given to us and have an impact yes now you can't have an impact we are just here together and you don't talk about God to the people of the world we are talking about God all the time those people now who's going to talk to them about God we just said the Shar is no life anymore there's no life only you have the life so who's going to give him life then yes so if we don't talk about God we don't talk about this message how you going to be prophesying again and then how you going to see the signs and wonders how are you going to see the power and demonstration of the gospel because you're not going to your brother will have the same anointing he's got he's get anointed you anointed we need to take it out there I'm not talking about Crusader I'm talking about having an impact I'm talking about having a life that is so anointed that people see Christ in you am amen amen that people know that death a man that sorry that's a person that walks with God that's a brother that's a sister that walks with God that that sister is not just talking not a hypocrite not just talking about God He Walks With God there's a difference with there's a difference knowing about this message and knowing this message if I can put it more easier there's a difference about knowing about Christ and knowing Christ there's a difference there's a big difference amen so they will say this person don't just talk about God they walk they know God amen amen stand God bless [Applause] you and we have the musicians let's sing that song Amazing [Music] Grace amen you believe it's amazing grace that Sav us amen [Music] How Sweet the Sound that sh
