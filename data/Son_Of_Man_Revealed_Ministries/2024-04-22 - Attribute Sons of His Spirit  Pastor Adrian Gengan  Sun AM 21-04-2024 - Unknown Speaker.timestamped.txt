[3:46] poast we pray the Lord will give them
[3:48] safe traveling mercies amen but we are
[3:50] here to Rejoice around the word of the
[3:52] Lord amen and let's turn to Genesis
[3:54] chapter 1 praise the Lord
[4:06] Hallelujah so at this time in season
[4:08] amen we appreciate the way the Lord is
[4:11] working with us we see the way he's
[4:13] working with natural
[4:16] Israel amen you do know that Israel
[4:19] can't continue in that way for much
[4:21] longer without Supernatural help that's
[4:23] right amen and the only way they can get
[4:26] Supernatural help is for the bride to
[4:28] leave the Earth amen because the prophet
[4:30] teaches us he don't work with the
[4:32] Gentiles and the Jews at the same time
[4:34] amen so he's got to fix things quickly
[4:36] now for the Gentiles get them off the
[4:38] scene so that amen he can now walk with
[4:42] the Jews again amen and you can see all
[4:44] nations you know the prophet taught us
[4:45] these things when you see all nations
[4:47] start to turn against Israel amen
[4:50] imagine that somebody attacks you and
[4:51] they tell you don't attack them back
[4:54] that's what they being told don't attack
[4:56] them back amen and you can see the the
[4:59] US who was their biggest Ally amen now
[5:03] also wants to take the breaks of the
[5:05] support of Israel so these are all signs
[5:07] for us it's been spoken in the message
[5:09] for years and years and years we've been
[5:11] preaching about these things the prophet
[5:12] laid in the books and tapes and now we
[5:14] can see it coming to pass before our
[5:16] very own eyes amen it also helps us to
[5:19] see the time and season that we are in
[5:21] amen but we don't use those things to
[5:23] scare us into getting ready amen the
[5:26] angel of the Lord is already here
[5:27] preparing us for the rapture amen
[5:30] hallelujah so we are not troubled or
[5:31] perplexed at wars and rumors of wars we
[5:35] are already ready for the Rapture how
[5:37] many if you can say Amen this morning
[5:39] amen praise the Lord amen so Genesis
[5:44] 1:26
[5:47] Hallelujah and God said let us make man
[5:50] in our image after our likeness and let
[5:54] them have dominion over the fish of the
[5:56] sea and over the foul of the air and
[5:58] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[6:01] and over every creeping thing that
[6:03] creepeth upon the
[6:06] Earth so God created man in his own
[6:10] image in the image of God created he him
[6:13] male and female created he them and God
[6:17] blessed them amen amen are you feeling
[6:21] blessed this morning and God blessed
[6:24] them amen praise the Lord and God said
[6:27] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[6:30] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[6:32] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[6:34] and over the foul of the air and over
[6:36] every living thing that moveth upon the
[6:38] sea amen let's turn to Romans chapter
[6:43] 8 these are very important scriptures at
[6:45] this time at this time amen the reason
[6:48] I'm reading Genesis 1 I'm showing you
[6:50] where you're going back
[6:51] to the type of man you're going back to
[6:55] amen praise the Lord amen Romans chapter
[6:58] 8 reading
[7:01] from let's read from verse
[7:05] uh
[7:08] 16 okay maybe from verse 15 there you
[7:12] this the scripture is packed I just want
[7:13] to keep reading and reading amen but
[7:15] let's read from
[7:17] verse let's read 15 for you have not
[7:19] received the spirit of bondage again to
[7:21] fear but you have received the spirit of
[7:24] adoption amen amen amen have you
[7:28] received that spirit
[7:30] yet amen the spirit of adoption amen
[7:34] amen so adoption is a spirit that will
[7:36] come upon you that groaning for
[7:39] adoption it says we have received the
[7:41] spirit of
[7:42] adoption amen some are satisfied being
[7:46] the son of
[7:47] Mami but the spirit of adoption connects
[7:50] you back with your father amen praise
[7:52] the Lord you have received the spirit of
[7:55] adoption whereby we cry ABA father
[8:00] the spirit that's the Holy Spirit itself
[8:03] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[8:05] are the children of God Amen so what is
[8:09] the holy spirit coming to do identify
[8:11] your give you an
[8:14] identification the holy spirit is here
[8:16] now to tell you that you are the
[8:18] children of God and if
[8:20] children remember being a child brings
[8:25] promises brings inheritance then a a
[8:28] speak of inheritance
[8:30] ears of God joint ears with Christ if so
[8:33] be that you suffer with him that we may
[8:36] also be glorified together amen for I
[8:39] reckon that the sufferings of this
[8:41] present time are not worthy to be
[8:43] compared with the glory which shall be
[8:45] revealed in us hallelujah for the
[8:48] earnest expectation of the creature
[8:50] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[8:52] of
[8:53] God for the creature was made subject to
[8:56] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[8:59] him who had subjected the same in Hope
[9:01] yes because the creature itself also
[9:04] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[9:06] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[9:09] the children of God aren't you glad that
[9:12] this flesh is going to be delivered this
[9:14] creature here amen is going to be
[9:16] delivered from bondage of
[9:18] corruption for we know that the all
[9:21] creation granth and travaileth in pain
[9:23] together until
[9:25] now and not only they but ourselves also
[9:29] which have the first fruits of the
[9:31] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[9:33] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[9:36] with the Redemption of our body amen
[9:39] amen amen one more scripture Revelation
[9:42] chapter 10 praise the
[9:50] Lord Revelation 10 and verse 7 says but
[9:53] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[9:56] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[9:59] mystery of God should be finished as he
[10:02] had declared to his servants the
[10:04] prophets amen the Lord had blessings to
[10:06] the reading of his word you may be
[10:09] seated praise the
[10:16] Lord amen everybody feeling good amen
[10:20] hallelujah amen it's a good thing to be
[10:21] found in the house of the Lord and to be
[10:23] called the Sons and Daughters of God
[10:25] this morning I want to speak on
[10:26] attribute sons of his spirit
[10:29] amen amen attribute sons of his Spirit
[10:34] am that's who we are
[10:43] amen atribute sons of his Spirit now we
[10:48] know an attribute is a
[10:51] quality if I talk about an attribute I'm
[10:53] talking about the quality the character
[10:56] or characteristic ascribed to
[11:01] someone trying to define attribute sons
[11:03] of his spirit this morning amen so an
[11:05] attribute is the quality character or
[11:08] characteristic of
[11:10] someone amen so the attributes of God
[11:14] refer to the character traits of God am
[11:16] amen amen amen hallelujah the character
[11:21] traits of God that are revealed to us in
[11:24] the
[11:25] scripture and as long as God remains a
[11:28] mystery
[11:30] we would not understand the nature of
[11:32] God meaning we wouldn't understand his
[11:35] attributes his nature and his
[11:39] character the way he revealed
[11:42] himself amen so the only way for us to
[11:45] know God's attributes the only way for
[11:47] us to know God's nature and his
[11:50] character is for the mystery of God to
[11:52] be revealed amen amen amen amen amen and
[11:57] we are living in that time Hallelujah we
[12:00] are living in that season where the
[12:02] mystery of God has been revealed the
[12:04] seventh angel has sounded so then now we
[12:07] can identify his attributes we can
[12:10] identify his nature we can identify his
[12:14] character praise the Lord so when the
[12:16] mystery of God is being revealed his
[12:19] attributes are being revealed
[12:22] Hallelujah prior to 107 being fulfilled
[12:26] his attributes were not fully revealed
[12:28] amen sons of God couldn't come to their
[12:30] full potential yes amen amen Luther
[12:35] couldn't operate as a fully as a Romans
[12:37] 8 man right neither could Wesley amen
[12:42] function like a Romans 8 man neither
[12:44] could the early Pentecostals but there's
[12:46] a time and season amen that's been
[12:49] designated for Sons and Daughters to
[12:51] come back to everything that they were
[12:53] in the beginning can somebody say Amen
[12:55] to
[12:57] that amen so with this it was revealed
[13:00] to us that we were in the thoughts of
[13:03] God before the foundation of the earth
[13:06] amen we know we've been reading
[13:07] Ephesians 1 and that confirms it that
[13:10] what we were predestinated to and to
[13:12] adoption of children there amen praise
[13:14] the
[13:15] Lord but this is my point now you and I
[13:19] are not a regular thought of
[13:23] God
[13:26] Amen remember what I'm trying to do this
[13:28] morning I'm trying to take away the
[13:30] Amnesia amen amen when man fell the
[13:33] prophet says we became unconscious of
[13:36] the fact of who we are but the preaching
[13:39] of the word in this end time the
[13:40] fivefold ministry in this end time he's
[13:43] coning out to amen reveal to you and
[13:46] make you known as you were known amen
[13:48] thank amen hallelujah we can't continue
[13:51] in this life living a kind of Life we've
[13:55] got to recognize who we are and what we
[13:56] were put on the earth for amen so when
[13:59] the mystery of God revealed now it takes
[14:02] on a different meaning because that is
[14:04] going to reveal Us in
[14:06] Christen amen it's going to reveal his
[14:09] attributes amen so we are not in regular
[14:13] thought amen hallelujah we are not an
[14:16] ordinary thought of God yes amen praise
[14:20] the Lord praise the Lord amen amen every
[14:23] son and daughter of God every child of
[14:25] God is no ordinary thought oh thank you
[14:28] Lord God meticulously thought about you
[14:31] he planned you amen he shaped you and he
[14:34] formed you he knew which part of the
[14:36] word you would be fulfilling for this
[14:38] age so God's thoughts about you are
[14:41] Eternal maybe now in the body there's
[14:43] some defect in your body there's some
[14:45] sickness amen but you're an attribute of
[14:47] God and your body must come in alignment
[14:50] with God's word amen and must let go of
[14:52] you amen amen demon powers that attach
[14:55] themselves to your body to your
[14:57] children's body to your wife's body body
[14:59] to your son's body amen they are
[15:01] illegally attaching themselves to that
[15:03] body amen but sons of God are coming
[15:05] back into their position and with the
[15:08] authority to tell that demon powers to
[15:10] let God's people
[15:12] go amen hallelujah so Genesis amen
[15:16] Genesis reveals our true beginning and
[15:18] brother Bram took us Beyond Genesis amen
[15:22] before creation Before Time began before
[15:25] Angels were created before creation of
[15:28] the heavens and the Earth he gave us our
[15:30] existence and eternal
[15:32] quality am no other preacher told us
[15:36] that amen but the seventh angel why when
[15:39] he's revealing the mystery of God the
[15:41] attributes of God must be fully revealed
[15:45] so he's got to tell you about yourself
[15:47] if you are an attribute of God yes
[15:50] praise the Lord amen Lord amen
[15:54] hallelujah yes so until that this may
[15:59] seem like a simple thing now but until
[16:01] this is established in your
[16:03] heart drops down from your head into
[16:06] your heart yes it'll be hard for you to
[16:08] reach rapturing Faith perfect Faith yes
[16:13] because perfect faith is knowing who we
[16:15] are what the word says about us and
[16:18] becoming everything the word says about
[16:21] us amen praise the Lord
[16:25] hallelujah if somebody in the natural
[16:28] loses their memory amen you've got to
[16:31] start to remind them of who they were
[16:33] where they come from you remember that
[16:35] soldier that lost his memory in battle
[16:38] he was going on this train and at one of
[16:40] the train stations he jumped off and he
[16:43] was looking and staring out at a hill
[16:46] and he just started to
[16:47] walk and one of the maybe the one of his
[16:51] leaders there started to follow
[16:54] him and this boy started to walk but he
[16:57] was completely lost his mind he started
[17:00] to walk down Pathways started to walk up
[17:04] a hill and down the hill and he got to a
[17:07] little house and he knocked on the
[17:10] door and when the door was opened this
[17:14] man on the other side hugged him and
[17:16] said my son I knew you would come home
[17:19] amen what happened he was walking down
[17:21] familiar Pathways amen and that's what
[17:24] the message of the hour came to do to
[17:26] make us walk down familiar pathways to
[17:29] lead us back to our father's home amen
[17:32] thank you Lord amen now we know the
[17:35] prophet of God tells us that the Holy
[17:37] Ghost does not make us Sons and
[17:38] Daughters of
[17:40] God hallelujah the Holy Ghost cannot
[17:43] make you a son and daughter of God you
[17:45] had to be a son and daughter of God
[17:47] already the Holy Ghost is only coming to
[17:50] equip you now in this time and season
[17:53] amen amen the Holy Ghost comes down to
[17:56] confirm your sunship amen your sunship
[17:59] was something in the back part of God's
[18:00] mind and it took the prophet to tell us
[18:02] where we came from amen so don't tell me
[18:05] we don't need a prophet amen and we know
[18:07] that the seven seal book that came down
[18:09] in this day came back with an abstract
[18:12] title D an abstract meaning something
[18:15] that was searched all the way back to
[18:16] the beginning meaning there's no other
[18:18] claimants on that title
[18:21] deed every other claimant has been
[18:23] stricken off that's what Boaz did amen
[18:26] when he went to the near Kinsman he when
[18:29] he was tracing back the title deed of
[18:31] noom's inheritance elac's inheritance
[18:34] there was a nearer Kinsman they had
[18:37] claims on their title te thank but he
[18:39] gave him an opportunity and the man
[18:41] refused so he struck him
[18:46] off amen praise the Lord amen so the
[18:50] seven seal book came with an abstract
[18:52] title de amen it searched all the way
[18:54] back to the beginning Tracing Our orions
[18:57] all the way from before the
[19:00] beginning don't you love the prophet of
[19:02] God because he gives our existence
[19:05] quality we are not didn't evolve from a
[19:08] monkey he told us where we came from
[19:11] what's our purpose here on the earth and
[19:13] where we are going to he gave our
[19:15] existence quality amen praise the Lord
[19:17] amen everything amen that you see
[19:20] created in heaven in the Earth was they
[19:22] thought of God because of God's
[19:26] omniscience he knows all things even
[19:28] knowing how how many times the prophet
[19:29] says he bets the flea would bet his eye
[19:32] think about this God now he knows how
[19:34] many times if flea bets his
[19:37] eye highs amen that's how complex and
[19:41] that's how great the mind of God is oh
[19:43] yes thank you Lord every little detail
[19:46] that's going on in the world right now
[19:48] God knows about it and God knows every
[19:50] little detail in your life amen maybe
[19:53] you feel like you're forsaken that God
[19:55] has forgotten about you I'm here to
[19:56] remind you that God knows every detail
[19:59] in your life thank you Lord thank you
[20:01] Lord thank you Lord amen God is
[20:04] concerned about you God is concerned
[20:06] about your life amen but God wants you
[20:08] to commit your weary ways your troubles
[20:12] to the Lord Everything To God In Prayer
[20:15] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah thank
[20:18] you Lord we've got to leave it there
[20:21] even if the world from you would old all
[20:23] it's silver and it's gold and you have
[20:25] to get along with Meer fair just
[20:28] remember his word how he feeds the
[20:30] little bird take your burdens to the
[20:33] Lord and leave it there thank you Lord
[20:37] if God won't let sparrows go hungry
[20:40] you're a son and daughter of God David
[20:42] said I've never seen the righteous
[20:44] forsaken amen thank you or seed begging
[20:47] bread thank you Lord amen you got to
[20:49] recognize your father and put a claim on
[20:51] your father you can't be joint tears
[20:54] with Jesus and then still be living
[20:56] beneath our privileges we've got to put
[20:58] in a clim
[20:59] to recognize who we are yes thank you
[21:02] Lord thank you Lord well if you think
[21:05] God's forgotten about you and who you
[21:06] are why don't you remind him who you are
[21:10] yes sir oh thank you go to me in prayer
[21:12] Lord I'm your son I'm your daughter why
[21:15] am I going through the trial why am I
[21:16] going to it oh God deliver me
[21:20] amen amen but the thing is we want to
[21:23] turn and walk away sometimes we want to
[21:25] get upset with god oh you've forgotten
[21:27] about me amen why is this going on in my
[21:29] life I didn't plan this type of life for
[21:31] me but God is building your character
[21:34] amen very important thing I'm telling
[21:36] you now an attribute reveals the
[21:38] character and nature of God but I want
[21:40] you to know that character you don't
[21:42] come with it on the earth you don't come
[21:45] built in with God's character because
[21:47] the prophet says character is not a
[21:51] gift character is a victory amen which
[21:55] means he going to use the trial it's
[21:57] going to take you to your place of
[21:58] trying to build up that character and
[22:02] that place of trying is only going to
[22:04] prove that you have the character of God
[22:06] because you can remain in
[22:09] patience character is not a gift you
[22:12] don't come predestinated from heaven
[22:14] with God given
[22:16] character character is a victory amen
[22:19] somebody say amen amen praise the
[22:22] Lord amen amen so we're talking about
[22:26] all thoughts now that were in God's mind
[22:28] even Lucifer was a thought in God's mind
[22:31] and all the angels that fell was a
[22:33] thought in God's mind but they were not
[22:36] attribute thoughts yes there's a
[22:40] difference with being a thought and
[22:42] there's a difference with being an
[22:43] attribute thought yes what is an
[22:46] attribute determines the nature
[22:49] character of a person you are an
[22:51] attribute thought meaning you are going
[22:52] to reveal the nature and the character
[22:54] of
[22:56] God thank you Lord
[22:59] Lucifer was in God's mind but he not an
[23:01] attribute
[23:03] thought how can he be revealing the
[23:05] attributes of God when he rebelled
[23:07] against God how can those angels be an
[23:10] attribute of God when they rebelled and
[23:13] they left heaven with Satan
[23:16] yes so anything that's not revealing his
[23:19] attributes his nature and his character
[23:22] is not an attribute
[23:24] thought
[23:26] hallelujah amen when a thought is an
[23:29] attribute thought it's a different
[23:31] thought it's a peculiar thought Amen
[23:35] brother Bram revealed that God's
[23:36] thoughts about us amen as an attribute
[23:39] meaning that God's thoughts about us are
[23:41] just not ordinary thoughts but they
[23:43] exist in God's mind but God's thoughts
[23:46] about us were his very nature we are
[23:49] reflecting God's nature that's who we
[23:51] really are that's our identity
[23:55] amen you see people don't like this
[23:57] preaching now because then when you when
[23:59] you realize who you are you can't go
[24:01] living your life the same
[24:03] way amen amen you can't be the same
[24:07] Almighty amen but you've got to be
[24:09] changed amen amen amen they can't
[24:13] constantly think that you are this type
[24:15] of person who just reacts from the flesh
[24:17] all the time amen temper like a buz saw
[24:21] brother brandom even had a temple like a
[24:23] b but his character was molded and
[24:26] shaped Hallelujah
[24:29] now you have a choice to believe this or
[24:30] not whether you're an attribute thought
[24:32] or not you have a choice to believe
[24:35] it you also have a choice to believe
[24:37] that you are in the Eternal section of

[30:23] hallelujah amen amen
[30:29] now he says here in the next one for
[30:32] those of you that need healing I put
[30:33] this in
[30:34] here healing is of God alone and God
[30:38] alone has purchased for us our healing
[30:40] it's up to us to do everything that we
[30:43] can in our life and in every way that
[30:46] God has give us for our healing but it's
[30:49] God that heals yes amen
[30:53] amen I hope you're reading what the
[30:55] prophet is saying there it's up to us to
[30:58] do everything we can in this life in
[31:01] every way that God has give us so if you
[31:04] need to go to the doctor you go to the
[31:06] doctor because the prophet is teaching
[31:09] us God heals through
[31:10] medicine God heals through
[31:13] music amen yes Hallelujah God heals
[31:17] through his word yes amen so are we
[31:19] going through every
[31:23] area and he says but it's God that heals
[31:26] amen
[31:28] that's right if God calls you to go home
[31:31] tonight there isn't enough medicine in
[31:33] the world will keep you
[31:34] here yes there's nothing going to keep
[31:37] you here and if he determines you to
[31:39] stay on the earth no matter how many
[31:41] Physicians say you're going tonight
[31:44] you're not going so it's just all up to
[31:48] God so you can rest in that that nobody
[31:52] can touch your life
[31:54] amen he says God is life life eternal in
[31:57] the was God he wasn't God at that time
[31:59] because God the English word god means
[32:01] object of worship there was nothing but
[32:04] him he was the Eternal just the Eternal
[32:06] one there was no moon no stars No Angel
[32:10] no nothing but in the beginning when we
[32:12] called God our Father Was attributes in
[32:15] him was an attribute to be father in him
[32:18] was attribute to be God in him was
[32:20] attribute to be son in him was attribute
[32:22] to be savior in name was attribute to be
[32:25] healer and all these things that we see
[32:27] now is just displaying his attributes
[32:29] amen than now if you were in is thinking
[32:32] at the beginning if you've got eternal
[32:34] life there's only one form of eternal
[32:36] life eternal life had no beginning and
[32:38] it has no ending amen so if you have
[32:41] eternal life you were an attribute of
[32:43] God's thinking before there was anything
[32:45] but
[32:46] him your form your shape and what you're
[32:49] in now is just a negative when you come
[32:52] around 22 years old you are a negative
[32:55] and death develops the picture to the
[32:58] positive that when this Earthly
[33:00] Tabernacle dis be dissolved we already
[33:02] have one waiting amen just to display
[33:05] now it shows what's being done like God
[33:08] becoming God when he creates Angels he
[33:10] becomes son when he created Jesus Christ
[33:13] he becomes savior when Jesus died he
[33:15] becomes healer when he was wounded for
[33:17] our transgressions with his stripes we
[33:19] were healed amen all these things are
[33:21] attributes of God just so that in the
[33:24] end the Bible says you will know that I
[33:26] am in the Father the father in me I in
[33:28] you you in me amen it's God becoming
[33:31] tangible your own wife you and your
[33:33] husband is just a shadow a negative of
[33:36] God and his wife the church amen so ask
[33:39] yourself at any time when was the
[33:41] attribute of God's wife on display amen
[33:46] now
[33:49] amen so God had an attribute to reveal
[33:52] himself in feminine form and locked up
[33:55] in the masculine form of Jesus Christ
[33:57] was the Bride of the Lord Jesus but at
[34:00] the cross they put a spear to his side
[34:02] and water and blood came out that was
[34:04] the birth of the church
[34:07] amuah amen
[34:10] amen why it's enough to set a Act of a
[34:13] beli on fire in these great hours that
[34:16] we're living when all hopes and Nations
[34:18] and everything else is crumbling on us
[34:20] and us we've got a kingdom we are
[34:22] baptized into this
[34:25] Kingdom amen hallelujah praise the
[34:29] Lord so the Lord has come now and he's
[34:32] given us the holy spirit amen but the
[34:35] holy spirit is just a temporal gift to
[34:37] you and I because Ephesians tells us
[34:41] amen grieve not the Holy Spirit until
[34:44] the day of your
[34:45] Redemption amen so
[34:48] yeah let's read the quote for those of
[34:50] you who don't know it amen in things
[34:51] that are to be he says I've got the
[34:53] baptism the holy spirit that still has
[34:56] nothing to do with it that's just only a
[34:58] temporal gift for you yes the real gift
[35:02] is your soul down in
[35:04] there so how's the condition of our
[35:07] souls this
[35:09] morning the real gift is your soul down
[35:12] in
[35:12] there cuz remember that's why the Holy
[35:14] Ghost came to connect with your soul
[35:18] yes that was born of God and that
[35:21] controls the whole thing to the word of
[35:23] God and the will of God Amen so if
[35:26] you're not conformed to the word of God
[35:29] and the will of God there's something
[35:30] wrong in your soul you haven't had a
[35:32] born again experience in your
[35:35] soul
[35:38] yes you're a Son of God coming forth and
[35:41] you see the word of God says I should do
[35:44] this I should be born again if you don't
[35:46] line up with that word there is
[35:47] something wrong your real father ain't
[35:50] God I'm trying to show you now whether
[35:53] you're an attribute of God or
[35:54] not the proph is pretty clear here right
[35:57] if you are not lining up with the word
[35:59] of God then it's clear you're not an
[36:01] attribute thought of
[36:02] God but if you are lining up with every
[36:05] word every word that's showing your
[36:09] you're the attribute of God you're the
[36:10] nature of God am because the Holy Spirit
[36:13] cannot deny his own word yes amen amen
[36:16] thank you Lord because that's the real
[36:18] start in your soul before there was ever
[36:21] even a spirit it was your soul that Soul
[36:23] didn't come from God then it wasn't a
[36:25] germ of God to begin with your
[36:29] received that's in things that are to be
[36:31] now one of the last messages he
[36:35] preaches hallelujah it's preached in
[36:38] December 5th
[36:40] 65 and he's preaching real deep things
[36:42] here now so you know amen hallelujah
[36:47] everybody okay amen you are not just a
[36:49] spirit you possess a soul yes amen and
[36:53] you have another body called theophany
[36:56] amen yes
[36:58] Hallelujah
[36:59] yes we may be accustomed to this body
[37:02] but you and I if we are what we just
[37:05] read there now an attribute of God we
[37:07] have a theophonic body amen hallelujah
[37:11] amen a theophonic body even the Apostle
[37:14] Paul says if the Earthly Tabernacle be
[37:16] dissolved we already have one waiting
[37:19] amen amen hallelujah God has made
[37:22] preparation for us he's given us another
[37:25] body waiting for us amen hallelujah we
[37:29] step into our theopen body if we die in
[37:32] the flesh we step into our theopen body
[37:35] in that sixth
[37:36] Dimension Hallelujah Lord praise the
[37:39] Lord and what does a theophonic body do
[37:42] a theophonic body gives quality to our
[37:45] soul amen amen it amen it frees a
[37:49] theopen body will free our soul from
[37:52] deception amen will free our our souls
[37:56] amen from ception of the enemy from
[37:58] every false
[38:00] idea aop body knows all
[38:03] [Music]
[38:05] things a theop body knows all things
[38:09] Am
[38:11] Lord now you hear what I'm saying a
[38:14] theop body knows all
[38:17] things and we know that only God knows
[38:20] all things so this body must be an
[38:23] attribute of God thank you Lord amen
[38:28] Amen in order for us to function like
[38:30] God yes you remember what we spoke about
[38:33] when he said let us make man in our
[38:35] image talking image means his character
[38:37] his nature likeness means to function
[38:40] like him in order for us to function
[38:42] like God Amen the the angels that fell
[38:45] were spirits that came from the thoughts
[38:47] of God but they fell and they did not
[38:49] have a theophonic body amen hallelujah
[38:52] if they had a theophonic body they
[38:54] wouldn't have fallen because the
[38:55] theophonic body would have kept them
[38:56] from deception ition amen amen but what
[39:00] did it do it revealed the quality of
[39:02] their Spirit it was not an attribute of
[39:05] God they were not redeemable attributes
[39:07] but thank God you and I are redeemable
[39:10] attributes of God a Son of God can fall
[39:13] a thousand times but if is a redeemable
[39:15] attribute of God Amen God must bring him
[39:18] back to his original
[39:21] position
[39:22] hallelujah thank you Lord
[39:26] [Music]
[39:27] that's
[39:30] right how many of you feel
[39:34] redeemable amen hallelujah you know
[39:38] something break down you have to make a
[39:39] decision whether you're going to fix it
[39:40] or not whether it's worth fixing say ah
[39:44] maybe it's not worth fixing that means
[39:45] it's not
[39:46] redeemable you don't have value to it
[39:50] quality to it but if it's dear to you
[39:54] even if it cost you more than that thing
[39:56] was you will redeem it yes and it cost
[39:59] him his own life
[40:01] hallelujah amen cost him his own life
[40:05] thank you
[40:07] Lord the Mighty God unveiled before us
[40:09] he says but when he come Express exactly
[40:13] The Testament had said he would be
[40:15] expressed then all those who was
[40:17] redeemable believed it because they were
[40:19] the thoughts of God the attributes of
[40:21] him at the beginning was made flesh and
[40:24] redeemable and was brought back to God
[40:26] as many as received him to them gave he
[40:29] power to become sons of God because they
[40:31] were redeemable amen they were from the
[40:33] beginning in the
[40:35] expression if we could stop here for a
[40:37] moment if it would be possible to think
[40:39] of that tonight of the message of the
[40:41] hour they express thought of Jehovah
[40:44] amen amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord
[40:49] the message of the hour is coming to

[40:57] of life thank you Lord praise the Lord

[41:07] soul and if you want to know the nature
[41:09] of your

[41:14] spirit so if you have a filthy Spirit it
[41:18] tells you the nature of your soul yes if
[41:21] you have a Godly Spirit it tells you the
[41:23] nature of your soul amen amen so if you

[1:04:39] messages from God to the individual is
[1:04:42] out to get the first thing
[1:04:44] first you can't put the Capa on before
[1:04:48] the foundation is laid that's like the
[1:04:51] roof before the foundation we've got to
[1:04:54] remember that put first things first

[1:05:07] connected with the angel amen he'll go
[1:05:09] on and on and tell you that you are a
[1:05:12] candidate for association with the
[1:05:14] Angelic world for the supernatural world
[1:05:16] how many of you know angels are
[1:05:17] ministering Spirits sent to the ears of
[1:05:20] Salvation that's Bible what are
[1:05:23] ministering spirits to the ears of
[1:05:25] salvation
[1:05:26] meaning like when Elijah was out there
[1:05:28] in the wilderness and they brought him
[1:05:30] food they are ministering spirits to
[1:05:32] serve
