[24:00] yes and I've been struggling to get a
[24:02] message
[24:04] I've been struggling to get a message
[24:05] because I've been preaching for
[24:07] hey long
[24:08] I had a good holiday yeah you know I was
[24:12] enjoying everything that was coming
[24:13] there
[24:14] I always try to run away from this place
[24:16] I never in all my life in the preaching
[24:19] of this gospel never looked for a Pulpit
[24:23] God always found the pulpit amen he said
[24:26] because if you've got to preach God and
[24:28] find you the people yes if you've got to
[24:30] preach you'll put the bridge in you yes
[24:32] if you got the preach you'll find a
[24:34] Pulpit for you amen praise the Lord it
[24:36] depends what you do from the pulpit amen
[24:39] you see that is why they call it Pulpit
[24:41] yeah because you need to pull people out
[24:43] of the pits or you could pull them down
[24:45] into the pit yeah
[24:47] so that's what happened
[24:49] I was living with his parents and you

[27:22] journeyed
[27:24] hey they came to Egypt
[27:27] when he came to Egypt what happened then
[27:30] Abraham
[27:32] saw
[27:33] hey Sarah was looking too terrific
[27:39] said I was looking too terrible
[27:43] she had a figure like a trigger
[27:45] you know that same
[27:47] problem hurry

[28:04] you know it was lawful that time yeah
[28:08] he said you know what just tell him
[28:09] you're my sister
[28:11] see God calling somebody
[28:14] and this somebody is telling a lie
[28:17] and he's supposed to be a prophet yeah
[28:20] and now we've got people here now in our
[28:22] place now telling us hey William Brandon
[28:25] is not a prophet because this is not
[28:28] right that's not right that's not right
[28:30] so now this page I'm tear it out from my
[28:32] Bible now because Abraham is not a
[28:35] prophet anymore
[28:36] you see we must learn to understand what
[28:40] God wants us to do yes
[28:42] when God calls a man he calls a man
[28:46] irrespective of the circumstances he
[28:48] takes him in amen
[28:51] so now
[28:53] Abram
[28:54] lets his wife go
[28:57] what happens there now hey I can just
[28:59] imagine Abraham Lincoln ate this man
[29:01] yeah
[29:02] he's with my wife
[29:06] he's with my wife
[29:09] but he allowed it
[29:12] but you see the god that we serve no
[29:16] matter what the circumstances in your
[29:18] life amen he will not leave you amen we
[29:20] will not forsake you
[29:22] he will be with you yes all the days of
[29:25] yours amen when he calls you he calls
[29:28] you to finish your work amen and he is
[29:30] going to finish the work irrespective of
[29:32] what happens
[29:36] now
[29:37] the King was troubled all night
[29:40] it comes to England
[29:42] you're telling me why did you tell me
[29:43] this is your sister when did you tell me
[29:45] this is my wife he says I was afraid
[29:49] now what happened
[29:51] the thing you have to pack him up hey
[29:54] put all this
[29:56] food and the rest of the things you see
[29:57] God is is fulfilling his promise I'm
[30:01] calling you to a land amen how are you
[30:03] going to get there you can't get there
[30:05] by starvation yeah
[30:08] so it fulfills the promise yes right
[30:11] there
[30:12] the king had to give him all the things
[30:15] send him off
[30:17] and he goes on the journey
[30:19] and he goes on the journey
[30:21] and then they come to a place
[30:24] it's Aaron
[30:26] and they stayed there
[30:30] and then what happened
[30:32] we find that you see sometimes when God
[30:34] calls the separation
[30:36] he's not calling your mother yeah you're
[30:38] not calling your father you're not
[30:40] calling your brother not calling your
[30:42] sister he's calling you amen amen yes
[30:45] amen amen nobody can go yeah amen
[30:48] calling you amen I mean he calls you
[30:51] yeah you must go amen
[30:55] don't decide to carry a table Yeah you
[30:57] see yeah same thing happened in the
[31:00] Garden of Eden
[31:01] see the disciple came with a fork tongue
[31:03] and he came with a long tail
[31:06] you see so don't carry a tail with you
[31:09] if God called you he calls you amen
[31:11] despise all the others and go forward
[31:14] amen he will bless you yes
[31:17] yes so yeah he was and they had to have
[31:19] a separation again
[31:21] you have to have a separation again yes
[31:23] right a lot
[31:26] a lot of things the Bible says he was
[31:29] blessed also yes you see how your
[31:32] blessing you could bless other people
[31:33] yes because of you the people are
[31:35] blessed Because Of You the people are
[31:37] blessed in this country yes if God takes
[31:40] away the bride the country is gone yes
[31:42] that's what the prophet said it's
[31:44] because of the Bride
[31:47] you are here and you stay here and as
[31:50] long as you are yeah there is no
[31:52] judgment on the land yes
[31:54] and when the bride gets off the land
[31:55] judgment amen yeah
[31:59] now Lord
[32:02] and Abraham
[32:04] and Abraham was a just man
[32:07] that is why he was called a friend of
[32:09] God
[32:11] and there was one place I think he was
[32:14] called
[32:15] the the the the mighty Prince friend of
[32:18] God Mighty Prince
[32:20] look at the titles yes God can give you
[32:23] titles amen you see

[56:23] but everything doesn't seem right
[56:26] but people have to bow down to you
[56:28] you're supposed to be like a king

[57:06] interpret the dream
[57:08] and so the one that should die the one
[57:12] had to go out
[57:14] but he said you know what
[57:16] when you grow up you remember me you
[57:18] remember me
[57:21] now he was reminding him
[57:24] to say the king
[57:26] this is what I am
[57:28] after that many years went by a lot of
[57:32] time went by
[57:34] hey hold it
[57:36] now hey this is all his dreams and
[57:38] everything we're not

[57:43] but one day
[57:45] they had to call for him
[57:47] when the king energy
[57:49] so he came up when there's a dream was
[57:51] for free fulfilled
[57:53] in the time of famine these brothers
[57:55] that you come
[57:58] you see they were all supposed to perish
[58:02] but God was fulfilling his promise amen
[58:04] amen to Joseph amen it was fulfilling
[58:08] the promise to Joseph amen because
[58:10] Joseph had to look after them during the
[58:11] time of famine amen Joseph forgot
[58:14] everything because he was christ-like
[58:16] yeah amen you see
[58:19] sometimes we can forgive but you can't
[58:22] forget one guy was telling me I can't
[58:24] forget
[58:27] he said I think about it
[58:28] I have to forget
[58:31] you see but Joseph never worry
[58:34] called his brothers he was happy to see
[58:36] his brothers yeah
[58:38] and he sustained them during the time of
[58:40] the famine yes yeah we're going to go
[58:43] through the way he went to his father
[58:44] and all that that's another story we'll
[58:47] say at three till three o'clock but
[58:50] that's what it was God fulfilling his
[58:52] brother amen yes not letting the Royal
[58:54] Seed of Abraham to die amen and
[58:58] throughout the journey right up to now
[59:01] the Royal Seed of Abraham will continue
[59:04] praise the Lord because he is the one
[59:06] that is sustainable amen that is keeping
[59:09] it through amen
[59:11] now Joseph
[59:14] sustain them through the time but this
[59:17] came a Time
[59:20] well
[59:21] a new federal rules you pick that up in
[59:25] Exodus one
[59:27] go home and read it see what preachers
[59:30] preach they've got no time to go through
[59:32] all that things unless if he's teaching
[59:36] a teacher will come and teach you but
[59:38] the preacher will preach yeah and set
[59:40] your life
[59:42] so now you pick it up in Exodus one
[59:46] the new Pharaoh came in and forgot about
[59:48] what Joseph's promise was what they
[59:51] promised Joseph and the people and they
[59:53] said now these people here whatever
[59:56] we're doing to them they multiplying

[1:00:03] one of these days they're going to
[1:00:05] overcome
[1:00:06] and they're going to take over our land
[1:00:09] they were afraid
[1:00:11] they were afraid
[1:00:13] that is why you see the denomination
[1:00:15] will tell the people hey don't join
[1:00:18] these people yeah
[1:00:20] don't join them because they take you
[1:00:23] away
[1:00:24] you see because why they are afraid
[1:00:27] because you have the power amen yes
[1:00:30] that's the only reason they are afraid
[1:00:31] because you have the power of God
[1:00:34] so they'll tell you don't join these
[1:00:36] people
[1:00:37] I remember when we first came in the
[1:00:38] message

[1:00:52] do
[1:00:53] that is what happened to the Egyptians
[1:00:55] now they were afraid
[1:00:57] people are they reckon then they said
[1:00:59] okay
[1:01:00] the Pharaoh said no don't worry we will
[1:01:02] deal with them in a different way
[1:01:04] persecution
[1:01:06] persecution time
[1:01:08] there is persecution when this bride is

[1:11:20] had the same procedure coming through in
[1:11:22] the last Exodus people are going off in
[1:11:25] disabled or going off from that angle
[1:11:28] but God told us to walk straight amen
[1:11:30] Prophet told us to walk straight
[1:11:34] you see
[1:11:36] all these delays
[1:11:38] all these delays
[1:11:40] are just for us
[1:11:42] to know
[1:11:43] that we must get ready and the only time
[1:11:47] it will happen if we get ready the
[1:11:49] Rapture will take place amen you see and
[1:11:52] then God rules up Moses for that day
[1:11:56] we come along and we see God had to
[1:11:59] raise somebody in that day
[1:12:02] and when the time time came Joshua knew
[1:12:06] Joshua had a vision of Jericho falling
[1:12:09] yeah
[1:12:09] yeah the vision yeah he knew
[1:12:13] he knew that is why I had so much of
[1:12:16] so much of Courage

[1:12:23] while they cross over
[1:12:28] he stood in the hand
[1:12:32] while they're crossing over
[1:12:34] we find
[1:12:36] the Jews were now in a place
[1:12:39] concentrated
[1:12:41] and then
[1:12:42] they had to raise somebody else to save
[1:12:45] them the promise
[1:12:48] and the promise had to come
[1:12:51] but how the promises come there's so
[1:12:52] much obstacles yeah there's obstacles on
[1:12:55] the way our promise is there but there's
[1:12:58] obstacles on the way
[1:13:01] and here was
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:05] he wanted to finish off all the Jews
[1:13:09] and if you finish up all the juice then
[1:13:10] where's the promise
[1:13:12] there's no promise
[1:13:15] King Azeroth
[1:13:18] was a king
[1:13:19] amen was in charge
[1:13:23] but is she gone
[1:13:24] in all his power and All His glory had

[1:13:53] because God will open the way amen he'll
[1:13:57] remove your vastly yes
[1:13:59] he will remove
[1:14:01] you don't have to remove it he will come
[1:14:03] and remove it
[1:14:06] and now
[1:14:08] there to be somebody to tell
[1:14:10] Esther
[1:14:11] hey oh did God had to raise a Mordecai
[1:14:16] to preserve his promise
[1:14:19] in order that he can fulfill This
[1:14:20] Promise
[1:14:21] he raised a Mordecai
[1:14:24] thank you in the time of distress it was
[1:14:28] a Mordecai
[1:14:30] and the Mordecai had to come there
[1:14:33] and tell Esther

[1:14:47] if all of us are gone there's no
[1:14:48] Abraham's seed yeah
[1:14:51] we all are finished yeah
[1:14:54] but God is never never ever going to
[1:14:58] allow his promise to fail yes amen
[1:15:02] allow his promise to me so he raises the
[1:15:05] Mordecai who comes there and Esther says

[1:23:18] to the time of Malachi
[1:23:20] that's 400 years yeah everything like
[1:23:22] government

[1:24:38] he says
[1:24:40] there will be a forerunner
[1:24:42] and there'll be Elijah yes yes but from
[1:24:45] that time to that time I think it was
[1:24:46] three hundred 400 300 years

[1:24:55] Mary yes amen hallelujah amen prophet

[1:31:20] church
[1:31:21] you will know who you are yeah if God
[1:31:24] called you you will preach amen amen you
[1:31:28] will not go out there and do what you
[1:31:31] supposed to do right
[1:31:33] because yeah he was self-proclaiming
[1:31:36] and then you got some
[1:31:38] backslidden preachers too
[1:31:41] will take you and ordain you
[1:31:43] make you a pastor
[1:31:46] there's no two Pastors in one Church
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:51] there's no two pastors
[1:31:54] people make that yeah
[1:31:57] you know
[1:31:58] the prophet
[1:31:59] said every church is a sovereign Church
[1:32:02] they will never pass it to lead the
[1:32:04] church amen
[1:32:05] if you want an example I'll give you an
[1:32:07] example
[1:32:09] here was a church
[1:32:11] there was a call for the pastor to go to
[1:32:13] Milltown
[1:32:16] remember the experience the military
[1:32:18] experience
[1:32:20] when he goes there
[1:32:21] he looks around
[1:32:23] finds a deliberated church
[1:32:30] trying to find a preacher they couldn't
[1:32:32] get a preaching
[1:32:33] anyway he walked around and he was
[1:32:35] waiting for that
[1:32:36] you know the prophet lived in the vision
[1:32:39] you know
[1:32:40] he was waiting for that call
[1:32:45] and he said
[1:32:46] when he got to the place
[1:32:48] I saw this young girl
[1:32:50] she was finished
[1:32:51] she was about to die
[1:32:56] property prayed for her
[1:32:59] and first thing he asked
[1:33:02] okay before that he went
[1:33:05] and he asked those people can we have a
[1:33:07] meeting in this church
[1:33:09] and that man that owned that place he
[1:33:11] said no you can't have a meeting in this
[1:33:12] church
[1:33:13] I don't blame him for not allowing them
[1:33:16] because maybe preachers come there leave
[1:33:19] the church and go away because it was
[1:33:20] not feasible to run the church
[1:33:24] today churches become
[1:33:26] feasibilities
[1:33:28] whether it's feasible to run a church or
[1:33:31] not feasible to run a church
[1:33:33] so when it's not feasible to run a
[1:33:34] church you close it down
[1:33:36] leave the people
[1:33:39] so that's exactly what is happening
[1:33:41] people close the church and no more
[1:33:44] church now
[1:33:45] people might find their own ways
[1:33:47] it happened in the message
[1:33:49] I'm not going to talk about the
[1:33:50] denomination
[1:33:52] right there were things like that
[1:33:54] now yeah I'm telling you
[1:33:57] if there's two people sitting here
[1:33:59] if I start to preach for two people amen
[1:34:02] take them to Heaven amen they're having
[1:34:04] a thousand people inside yeah yeah and
[1:34:06] sending 50 of them
[1:34:09] that's a church no church closes so this
[1:34:13] man must have been angry in his
[1:34:14] apartment
[1:34:16] you know what I've got a lot of these
[1:34:18] people now they'll come and get all the
[1:34:19] people and leave them and run away
[1:34:23] so you never allowed it
[1:34:25] so they went around they went a little
[1:34:27] bit they went and seen the place
[1:34:29] and they said hey you know what the Lord
[1:34:31] said him to go to a certain house
[1:34:33] when it's honestly girls I think she had
[1:34:36] TB or something some sort of a sickness
[1:34:38] she had
[1:34:39] cancer
[1:34:41] and the prophet prayed for her she
[1:34:44] jumped out of the she never once
[1:34:45] you were never was out of the bed for
[1:34:47] months she jumped out of the bed and the
[1:34:50] neighbors saw it and it was a whole
[1:34:52] Place went on fire for the Lord then
[1:34:55] they started to have meetings the man
[1:34:57] said okay come have meetings and the
[1:34:59] very same man ended up being the pastor
[1:35:01] of the church who first disallowed the
[1:35:04] meetings
[1:35:06] but then the prophet said and the
[1:35:08] brothers were asking the prophet what do
[1:35:10] we do yet I'm giving you this because
[1:35:12] you need to know because there's so much
[1:35:15] of things that are going around you need
[1:35:17] to know what is happening right
[1:35:19] and you need to know you have to stay in
[1:35:21] Fellowship amen you need to know that
[1:35:23] you have to be in Fellowship amen you
[1:35:25] need to know that you need a church to
[1:35:27] stay here hallelujah not streaming and
[1:35:29] all that kind of stuff
[1:35:33] no
[1:35:35] the prophet said the brothers
[1:35:37] we will send somebody every week
[1:35:40] to have those meetings
[1:35:42] until we find
[1:35:44] somebody to pass to the church yes yes
[1:35:47] sir yeah and somebody to pass to the
[1:35:50] church
[1:35:51] now
[1:35:52] that's what happened
[1:35:54] and they came
[1:35:55] week after week week after week week
[1:35:57] after week and then they saw this
[1:35:59] brother growing and growing in the best
[1:36:02] and So eventually
[1:36:03] eventually
[1:36:07] he became the pastor
[1:36:09] so that is why I'm saying there's no two
[1:36:12] Pastors in one church amen every church
[1:36:14] is a sovereign church if you've got five
[1:36:17] churches 10 churches and you're going
[1:36:19] around
[1:36:20] you better place pastors there amen
[1:36:22] Grace pastors there let them run the
[1:36:24] church amen we've got no overseers we've
[1:36:27] only got one overseer amen who's the
[1:36:30] Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:36:33] and here was David is busy
[1:36:36] he's busy now with his congregations
[1:36:37] he's got everything ready and the priest
[1:36:40] was going to anoint him
[1:36:41] but God had to raise up a nature
[1:36:45] Nathan
[1:36:47] Nathan the prophet
[1:36:49] came and reminded by Sheba
[1:36:52] Bathsheba with a queen
[1:36:56] remember
[1:36:57] what David said

[1:37:26] but here he came
[1:37:27] heading to the queen go in and I will
[1:37:31] come and confirm amen

[1:37:49] to make the king to speak amen the king
