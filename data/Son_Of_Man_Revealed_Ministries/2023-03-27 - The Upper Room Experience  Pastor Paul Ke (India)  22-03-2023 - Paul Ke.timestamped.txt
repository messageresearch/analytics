[4:14] who fell in the bathtub and they're
[4:16] taking you at a hospital now
[4:19] amen we've already prayed over the
[4:21] situation and we're awaiting the
[4:23] positive report amen amen just to give
[4:25] you a feedback amen some testimonies so
[4:27] yeah we were on Sunday you know Sunday
[4:29] after the service and spirit of the Lord
[4:31] is moving in this place and we totally
[4:33] be sensitive to the angel of the Lord
[4:34] amen
[4:36] so we go outside dismiss the service and
[4:38] here comes with the same all excited
[4:41] amen you can see there's something
[4:43] countenance has changed
[4:45] and you can hardly speak he just wants
[4:47] to break down crying and then he shares
[4:49] the testimony he says brother I didn't
[4:50] know this now right he says brother I
[4:52] couldn't use my end I couldn't use my
[4:54] arm I couldn't even lift my arm
[4:56] but he says something happened there and
[4:58] if you those of you that were yeah you
[4:59] know I said that somebody wants to touch
[5:01] the touch the aim of His Garment and I
[5:04] didn't know the brother there was
[5:05] sitting with a need amen
[5:07] and he says he felt like something just
[5:09] a way to leave him
[5:11] and when I said let's just raise our
[5:13] hands and Worship the Lord he raised his
[5:15] hands
[5:16] and he got surprised that he could
[5:17] actually lift his hand up
[5:19] amen
[5:21] in the Peace of the Lord amen I tell you
[5:24] we are writing another book of Acts
[5:27] it's not going to happen it's happening
[5:29] now amen if we leave it up for another
[5:31] day in another age like I always say we
[5:34] might as well die and go to the grave
[5:35] and let the age that's going to come and
[5:37] do it be on the scene now amen but we
[5:40] are the church that God is working
[5:42] through we're always preaching that it's
[5:45] a mystery great mystery secret of how we
[5:47] were in the back part of God's mind but
[5:49] God wants to have the preeminence in his
[5:51] Believers now when are we going to allow
[5:53] the Holy Spirit to walk through us I
[5:56] tell you as the message church we really
[5:57] got to wake up we are the most powerful
[6:00] word but we have people sitting without
[6:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[6:04] the new birth and that's the problem
[6:06] we have a second generation in the
[6:08] message now that have now become the
[6:10] life of the church but they've kind of
[6:12] inherited the message and haven't had
[6:14] not have not had the new birth have not
[6:16] had the new Holy Ghost experience I'm
[6:18] telling you we need to labor to make
[6:20] sure they have that experience otherwise
[6:22] amen what's going to happen
[6:24] we're gonna just end up believing the
[6:26] message and the prophet tells us
[6:28] believing alone is not good enough he
[6:30] says believing that's what the Baptists
[6:31] do
[6:32] they tell you that believing is a sign
[6:34] of the Holy Ghost
[6:35] amen hallelujah
[6:38] in suspicion this evening I mean if you
[6:41] come pray it up amen hallelujah because
[6:43] you get what you expect if you come
[6:45] expecting nothing we're gonna go out
[6:47] receiving nothing but if we come
[6:49] expecting amen and and if you heard of
[6:52] that accident on the m41
[6:55] the massive pile up last week on the 6th
[6:57] of March
[6:59] our sisters were caught up in their
[7:00] accident sister Elaine and sister
[7:01] Jaylene if you see the pictures of that
[7:04] car you wouldn't think anybody survived
[7:05] it the car was overturned it flipped
[7:07] several times the truck hit them and the
[7:10] cops flipped several times
[7:12] so something phenomenal happened because
[7:14] we've been preaching on the angel of the
[7:15] Lord
[7:16] amen my vision was that if we take the
[7:19] book of Acts and we marry it with our
[7:22] church because we're going to write
[7:23] another book of Acts you'll see the
[7:25] angel of the Lord present in the book of
[7:27] Acts visibly present he's opening prison
[7:30] gates for them he's leading Philip to
[7:33] the desert to the eunuch there there's a
[7:35] visible manifestation of the Angel of
[7:37] the Lord and exodus 23 23 says behold I
[7:41] send my angel before thee so if there
[7:43] was an angel in the first Exodus there's
[7:45] an angel in the second Exodus
[7:47] with the disciples they must be the
[7:49] angel of the Lord here and stop telling
[7:52] me it was in the days of brother Brandon
[7:53] because we are do not serve again
[7:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[7:58] amen
[8:00] Hallelujah so here we were and
[8:04] when I heard about the accident and I
[8:05] saw the pictures and brother Sunny
[8:07] called me to tell me his daughter was
[8:08] involved in this accident
[8:10] and then we were hearing the news
[8:12] reports that there was no
[8:14] nobody lost their lives
[8:17] and immediately I said the angel of the
[8:18] Lord was there to protect his sisters
[8:20] and because they were there he protected
[8:23] everybody else amen now the Bible says
[8:26] prove all things
[8:27] so we were looking for the manifestation
[8:29] and the presence of the Angel of the
[8:31] Lord
[8:32] so when I went to visit the sisters I'm
[8:34] just sharing this testimony because it
[8:36] might help you in your faith Amen to see
[8:38] that the angel of the Lord is present
[8:40] here with us you won't hear this
[8:42] testimony in the news report because
[8:43] they were eyewitnesses of what they saw
[8:45] there
[8:46] so just before the accident
[8:49] sister Elaine is now relating this story
[8:51] and she says sister Jalen that's a
[8:54] daughter now he's telling a mom can you
[8:57] see like this mist and this Cloud here
[9:00] night
[9:02] you may think that's ordinary incident
[9:04] why would somebody be showing their
[9:06] mother a cloud
[9:07] unless it's an unusual something amen
[9:10] amen so if you know that
[9:11] the the down to the m41 look overlooking
[9:13] the beat
[9:15] [Music]
[9:16] it's not in the
[9:18] arming down everybody know who I'm
[9:20] talking about the m41 it's not in the
[9:22] island that you would see clouds at that
[9:24] level because you're descending that way
[9:25] the clouds will be up there
[9:28] but sister Lane says I can't see
[9:31] anything I don't know what you're
[9:32] talking about
[9:33] hmm
[9:36] yes she's seeing something and she says
[9:39] I was getting frustrated with my mother
[9:41] because I'm telling her she was just
[9:42] about to open the window and say mom
[9:44] look there and sister Elaine is saying I
[9:46] can't see anything for me it's clear
[9:48] then it came to my mind where Elijah
[9:50] said Lord open the boy's eyes
[9:53] she said it was like a miss that was
[9:54] forming there and coming and I believe
[9:57] of the Lord
[10:00] because she said she was just about to
[10:02] open the window and say mom look there
[10:04] and then the accident impact happened
[10:06] so what was manifesting there
[10:09] I know some of you don't believe it
[10:12] because the 96 Chicago I've got a three
[10:15] clouds what is that
[10:18] we sit in the form of a cloud but the
[10:20] prophet says it's 7
[10:24] the angel of the Lord is present with us
[10:26] and amongst us we need to be more
[10:28] sensitive to the angel of the Lord
[10:31] you know what if we lead him to recite
[10:33] he's a gentleman
[10:34] he won't come barging on us
[10:36] we got to be expecting to see him we got
[10:39] to be expecting to see the manifestation
[10:40] of the presence of the Lord and we thank
[10:43] the Lord for his grace upon the sisters
[10:44] lives amen hallelujah that they walked
[10:47] out of that accident with minor injuries
[10:50] amen hallelujah and he can do it for you
[10:53] yes
[10:54] I encourage you to call him on the scene
[10:56] amen amen I encourage you
[10:58] to depend on him amen now more than ever
[11:01] before check if we have the Holy Ghost
[11:04] amen I tell you because if that's the
[11:07] key
[11:08] the key to the message of the hour is
[11:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:12] seek it with all you can
[11:14] amen if it means you fasting and praying
[11:17] and doing all you can don't go another
[11:18] day without the spirit of the Lord
[11:21] amen amen amen hallelujah I want to call
[11:24] Pastor Thomas amen living welcome
[11:26] Apostle key
[11:28] amen seeing that he knows him best I
[11:30] know he's looking at Pastor Denzel now
[11:32] but I'm calling Pastor Thomas
[11:35] amen so we welcome Pastor Denzel
[11:38] amen the other minister and brothers
[11:40] that are here amen welcome you good to
[11:44] see every one of you amen
[11:58] amen God bless you brothers and sisters
[12:00] amen amen is good to be in the house of
[12:03] God tonight amen hallelujah we've had
[12:07] a few Knights of Jubilee amen amen with
[12:10] our brother Pastor paulki from India
[12:13] some of you were there last night I see
[12:15] familiar faces amen and we had a
[12:19] wonderful time and I believe you're
[12:21] going to be blessed tonight amen amen
[12:24] um I think he's coming in
[12:28] um he is from guntur
[12:31] I think there was a mistake he's not
[12:32] from Hyderabad on the poster he's from
[12:36] guntur
[12:38] he's married and he's got two children
[12:41] he's got a daughter who is equivalent to
[12:44] the grade 11 in South Africa and he's
[12:47] got a small Sun as well I think about
[12:50] two years old
[12:52] [Music]
[12:52] um
[12:54] Pastor Paul came
[12:56] some of you might have heard him saying
[12:59] I am a Street Preacher
[13:03] and if you've been to India and you
[13:05] watched him
[13:06] he were the block off a street
[13:09] block it off completely
[13:12] and because of police and whoever it is
[13:15] it will put tents on the other either
[13:18] side and he would have a service
[13:21] people from the balconies would watch
[13:24] and be convicted by the sermons that he
[13:28] preaches you'll have all the ministers
[13:30] coming by
[13:32] um just a the work that is doing in
[13:35] India
[13:37] um you know in South Africa most of our
[13:39] churches people are backslid
[13:42] yeah after covert
[13:44] in India
[13:46] after covert people came in the message
[13:50] received the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:54] I'm talking about Pastor Paul King
[13:58] baptized 2 000 Souls
[14:05] amen
[14:10] over and above that
[14:12] he has planted 33 churches amen
[14:16] amen
[14:18] and 23 of them were denominational
[14:21] churches before that are now serving
[14:24] under the message
[14:30] the brother is so dedicated to the Lord
[14:34] that he prays up he leaves his family
[14:38] and you know uh you know the pastor's
[14:41] present I I just want to confess I feel
[14:44] ashamed
[14:46] when I look at the worker that the
[14:48] Pastors in India are doing especially
[14:49] Pastor Paul came
[14:51] I told him on many occasions I take my
[14:53] cap off for you
[14:56] he goes out
[14:57] into the streets he goes out into the
[15:00] deep forests
[15:02] and he goes out and preaches for days
[15:05] and comes back home
[15:08] he says every week
[15:10] there are baptisms that are taking place
[15:13] he's doing baptisms on a weekly basis
[15:17] I think in South Africa we're doing it
[15:19] on a yearly basis
[15:23] so I think there's a leaf that we need
[15:25] to take from amen amen you must
[15:27] understand that the ground is difficult
[15:30] the Hinduism ground is very difficult
[15:33] it's difficult to break but most
[15:35] probably we need to sit with pastor
[15:37] paulke and you know take a leaf out of
[15:40] his page so here we have a man
[15:44] who is actually in action amen Christ
[15:48] Jesus when he says he's a Street
[15:50] Preacher I think in the context of what
[15:53] I said tonight you will understand what
[15:55] he does
[15:56] it goes out for the gospel if he's
[15:59] called out you know he is one of the
[16:02] preachers that came by and he doesn't
[16:04] want a free day to go out to the
[16:07] aquarium or to the you know crop world
[16:10] and things like that he wants Ministry
[16:13] amen if he can get that soul
[16:16] irrespective whether it's India or South
[16:18] Africa if he can get that soul
[16:21] so my brothers and sisters we want to
[16:23] introduce pastor paulke and I think he's
[16:26] done a lot for the Gospel of Jesus
[16:29] Christ and he sits around with ministers
[16:33] especially the young ministers I'm
[16:36] talking about young in the message and
[16:38] he kind of kind of tutors them in the
[16:42] message of the Hour
[16:43] his Doctrine is straight
[16:46] you know he doesn't have any wishy-washy
[16:50] dachshunds around the message and so
[16:53] those of you who had him last night and
[16:56] the other nights as well on Sunday he
[16:58] preached two Services as well and if you
[17:01] heard him well you will find that he is
[17:04] a powerful preacher amen so
[17:07] I wish you can
[17:10] Just Surrender yourself
[17:12] and be subject to the spirit of God
[17:16] tonight as he comes to the pulpit I'm
[17:19] not sure whether we've been there and
[17:21] sing a song
[17:23] [Music]
[17:29] amen amen let's just stand together we
[17:33] sing a song and

[46:20] by Harding and why did he fail
[46:24] is the reading is spending time but
[46:26] nothing is in his mind
[46:32] then some people would like to pray all
[46:33] the day
[46:34] [Music]
[46:36] they may not be the Rapture yeah
[46:39] you know why
[46:43] if God Gave You exam

[46:56] God's exams you don't have any grades we
[46:58] have only one great you have to get sent
[47:00] percent
[47:03] but because some people only will give
[47:05] you a mark That's why we say it's all in
[47:08] examination we call it a mark you know
[47:10] Grace mark
[47:13] Factor
[47:15] God gave a Christmas to Jacob God gave a
[47:18] Christmas to David God gave a Grace not
[47:20] to Paul and the same God gave me he
[47:23] given me Christmas so the reason I'm
[47:25] here tonight
[47:27] praise the Lord see those who are in the
[47:30] word of God will believe the full word
[47:33] amen they believe that the world was
[47:36] open tonight it was open see what is
[47:39] purple
[47:48] that's what prophet said
[47:51] but what is the acts of the third Polo

[47:58] you need the power of the Holy Spirit
[48:01] [Music]
[48:03] amen
[48:05] open word you need the power of the old
[48:08] yes see see Prophet said that God never
[48:11] gave the word of God only but he gave
[48:14] the power of God too what is Third World
[48:17] opening of the word and power of the god
[48:20] that God is
[48:23] amen that's why you call anything in the
[48:26] thoughtful
[48:27] you call anything it will happen it will
[48:30] come to the existence no matter what
[48:31] happens but you have to believe it
[48:35] amen until unless you believe it won't
[48:37] happen amen because you are saying you
[48:40] are part of Christ when you are saying
[48:43] Christ will do that
[48:45] praise the Lord amen
[48:48] let me continue
[48:52] we know all these three pictures amen
[48:57] right
[48:59] when John was asking to eat the book
[49:01] then he never doubted
[49:04] did he not yet
[49:05] did he asked God God how can I eat a
[49:08] book
[49:12] he never doubted he just followed the
[49:14] world
[49:15] that's how the bride will follow the
[49:18] world Amen it won't ask any questions
[49:21] amen
[49:23] praise the Lord
[49:26] when Moses was asked to
[49:29] separate the Red Sea then he never
[49:31] doubted it
[49:35] see when God came to Moses then he said
[49:37] just Moses open I mean raise your hand
[49:40] and show the rod to the Sea
[49:43] did he asked God that God will it open
[49:50] in the third pole we don't doubt the
[49:52] world

[49:58] secret is the thoughtful
[50:00] God will talk to you directly
[50:03] in the third pole yes
[50:06] and the greatest thing is YouTube will
[50:08] talk to him directly amen nobody between
[50:11] you and God nobody between Moses and God
[50:14] nobody Between Brothers and God nobody
[50:16] between pride and Christ tonight amen

[50:23] you can see him
[50:27] the denomination says that God is here
[50:29] tonight
[50:31] but who he says that God is in me
[50:33] tonight amen
[50:35] it's so personal the message is so
[50:37] personal amen
[50:39] it is separating from us to me
[50:43] is that right see the pillar of fire was

[1:02:13] because God appointed your pastor amen
[1:02:16] for his job you must not say anything
[1:02:19] against him
[1:02:20] see why why David didn't kill Saul

[1:02:47] church if you want to be in the church
[1:02:48] don't say anything against your past
[1:02:56] they'll come out and they'll call me
[1:02:57] Pastor now I came out from the church I
[1:03:00] want to say about the pastor and I said
[1:03:01] what is the need now
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:08] so no need to try again
[1:03:11] if you are really
[1:03:14] have experience with God personal
[1:03:15] experience with God you don't curse
[1:03:18] anyone amen no need to cast God will do
[1:03:21] that yes
[1:03:22] if he did anything wrong then God will
[1:03:25] take action
[1:03:26] that's why see Bride has the double
[1:03:28] portion believe it yeah
[1:03:30] the preacher has a double punishment
[1:03:35] why why are we entering into double
[1:03:37] punishment
[1:03:41] it's very hard to preach from the
[1:03:43] pulpitra amen somebody would like that
[1:03:45] see Prophet said all the men in the
[1:03:48] church would like to preach
[1:03:52] after preaching a settlement every
[1:03:54] believer every man in the church would
[1:03:56] like to say if I am there
[1:03:58] maybe I'll preach more than you better
[1:04:01] than him
[1:04:04] then why you had a pastor
[1:04:08] it is a call
[1:04:11] say Prophet Prophet said in a message
[1:04:13] called an angel at the end time
[1:04:16] those who are preaching at the end time
[1:04:18] they were four are dying
[1:04:20] amen you were not ordered by some pasta
[1:04:24] or some brother or some a person
[1:04:27] evangelist you are foreign
[1:04:34] he said I saw God calling him
[1:04:38] he never added Timothy he said Prophet
[1:04:40] says that I saw God calling Timothy
[1:04:43] because his forefather is a pastor
[1:04:47] see that was in in Timothy so he found
[1:04:50] the call and he said you have a call yes
[1:04:54] it's a declaration
[1:04:56] it's not ordination yes
[1:05:00] so it's a declaration of the ordination
[1:05:03] praise the Lord
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:07] see
[1:05:11] do you have all the expert how the
[1:05:14] experience of the upper room
[1:05:17] you must have before the Rapture amen
[1:05:20] let me ask you where do we get the
[1:05:22] abortive experience
[1:05:28] do you get anywhere
[1:05:30] knows that we can't get anywhere but in
[1:05:33] the world
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:36] it can't go anywhere
[1:05:38] so
[1:05:45] in a message expectation 55 he said
[1:05:48] Prophet says that we need back to the
[1:05:51] Bible to the old-fashioned Holy Spirit
[1:05:53] good old time Saint Paul's Revival and
[1:05:57] the Bible Holy Ghost
[1:06:00] is what we need back in the church again
[1:06:02] tonight amen
[1:06:04] what we need it
[1:06:09] praise the Lord
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:15] see
[1:06:16] saying but friend friend
[1:06:19] the wheat is still moving on
[1:06:22] we are
[1:06:23] one of the greatest revivers
[1:06:26] it lasts longer history shows that the
[1:06:28] Revival only lasts about three years
[1:06:33] this one has been 15 years
[1:06:36] or more
[1:06:37] great healing campaigns but it's cool of
[1:06:40] now
[1:06:42] it's cool off now you know why it was
[1:06:44] cooled up
[1:06:46] we are sharing the testimonies
[1:06:51] I love to share the testimony I always
[1:06:53] say the show we must not hide the
[1:06:55] testimony amen but see one one the
[1:06:58] healing was happening the family
[1:07:01] who was benefited by the healing they
[1:07:04] don't like to come to the church next
[1:07:05] week
[1:07:07] because they're busy sharing testimony
[1:07:12] that's how they are
[1:07:13] going far from the church
[1:07:17] so once God healed you
[1:07:20] then you are a testimony in the god
[1:07:25] so how to how to show gratitude to God
[1:07:30] how do thanks you God
[1:07:33] see what happens in our churches
[1:07:35] especially the message churches if
[1:07:37] anything happens in the family or
[1:07:38] healing or something happen they may get
[1:07:40] the job or something they'll call the
[1:07:42] pastor to call it all the church and
[1:07:43] they say the Thanksgiving service
[1:07:45] they'll give some offering to parcel
[1:07:47] I'll name a president to Pastor they'll
[1:07:49] provide food everything then it is over
[1:07:53] yeah yeah
[1:07:56] it's not about one day thing
[1:08:00] from then you have to give your life to
[1:08:03] God amen amen from then
[1:08:06] if anything happens personally in your
[1:08:09] life that means god is looking to you
[1:08:11] amen what is healing
[1:08:14] you know what is healing
[1:08:16] only God can give it amen nobody can
[1:08:20] give it so that when God saw you
[1:08:24] God showed Grace towards you amen God
[1:08:27] healed you that means god actually you
[1:08:31] know especially in the church
[1:08:34] because you find favor in the sight of
[1:08:36] God Amen
[1:08:37] amen amen
[1:08:39] that means god is attracting you God is
[1:08:42] calling you through the healing amen
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:46] amen why Jesus did all the healings in
[1:08:49] his first food to attack the people yes
[1:08:53] to gather the people that's right to
[1:08:55] attack the people to the world
[1:08:58] so now why God is giving healings in the
[1:09:00] church why God is giving testimony to
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:07] church's fish
[1:09:11] once he was caught you must give your
[1:09:14] heart to God Amen not like Samson
[1:09:18] not like Samsung
[1:09:21] is half heart to God
[1:09:24] well he's able to fight
[1:09:27] then he feels like a warrior
[1:09:30] are they freeze the war
[1:09:32] then you look for a woman
[1:09:36] because he give halfway to women
[1:09:38] how far to God but God wants full
[1:09:41] surrender
[1:09:45] the same God wants to wear full armor of
[1:09:48] God not half
[1:09:49] I'm sorry
[1:09:51] really I'm sorry to say this
[1:09:54] today is some preachers they only read
[1:09:57] four books of prophet
[1:10:00] they don't read whole Bible
[1:10:03] they leave only four books they say that
[1:10:06] they have God God
[1:10:07] hmm how can it be possible yes
[1:10:13] how could it be possible
[1:10:17] if God called you then God will give you
[1:10:19] full word
[1:10:21] because we are not in the beginning days
[1:10:23] of the thoughtful yes without the ending
[1:10:26] days of the thoughtful

[1:10:34] you'll agree or not I don't know but I
[1:10:36] would like to bring it your notice

[1:10:41] seven sins then there was no Revelation

[1:13:22] Prophet says that we came to our uh our
[1:13:25] starting point now he said
[1:13:27] maybe today or tomorrow we are going
[1:13:29] back to our own place
[1:13:34] will take place between morning six and
[1:13:37] nine yeah

[1:13:46] how many are ready to receive the holy I
[1:13:48] mean to to be in the Rapture how many
[1:13:50] are
[1:13:55] so that's why he says that you need Holy
[1:13:58] Spirit each and every hour amen each and
[1:14:01] every hour
[1:14:03] see when Peter received Holy Spirit he
[1:14:05] never denied Jesus Christ he never
[1:14:07] afraid of anything he became Brave
[1:14:12] they caught it they said will kill you
[1:14:14] he said how would like to kill me
[1:14:18] on the cross
[1:14:21] he said okay no problem but can you do
[1:14:23] me a favor
[1:14:24] can you do it upside down
[1:14:28] yeah
[1:14:29] there's the one who ran away
[1:14:32] see the power of the holy spirit amen
[1:14:34] let me tell you one thing when when
[1:14:37] Peter was in the prison
[1:14:39] he never left afraid of the prison
[1:14:45] you have any of you have experience in
[1:14:48] the prison
[1:14:55] I have
[1:15:00] I was seven days in the prison
[1:15:03] without doing anything
[1:15:06] because of my close friends I was there
[1:15:08] in the prison
[1:15:12] I was I was not a preacher at the time
[1:15:16] I just read a book
[1:15:18] Paul a prisoner to Christ
[1:15:21] last night and the next day morning five
[1:15:23] o'clock somebody knocked my door and I
[1:15:25] opened their police they took me to the
[1:15:27] jail
[1:15:30] what can I do
[1:15:32] it was a Friday evening
[1:15:34] so I don't get bail on Saturday and
[1:15:37] Sunday so my family came and upgrade on
[1:15:40] Monday they don't know how to apply
[1:15:41] because we never face this kind of
[1:15:43] things they failed to produce all the
[1:15:44] documents so I didn't get it so you know
[1:15:47] what happened to the channel and the
[1:15:48] Sunday Saturday morning I was I I tried
[1:15:51] to get a Bible I would like to read
[1:15:52] Bible on my knees at the time
[1:15:55] so I was reading my Bible on the fourth
[1:15:57] trial on my knees at the time
[1:16:00] so I got the Bible the Bible has no
[1:16:04] Genesis and no revelation
[1:16:07] because it was only Bible in the prison
[1:16:10] so I asked her depleted them to give so
[1:16:12] they give me and I started reading at
[1:16:14] the window from morning eight o'clock to
[1:16:16] three o'clock I started reading so
[1:16:18] jailor was walking and observing me
[1:16:21] the day was went on very well the next
[1:16:24] day morning we all were called to the
[1:16:26] assembly and suppose their pastors come
[1:16:29] and preach for 15 to 30 minutes we were
[1:16:32] standing in the lane there were 200
[1:16:34] prisoners there with me
[1:16:36] so the passage didn't came
[1:16:38] the Jailer came to me directly and they
[1:16:41] asked me
[1:16:42] hey come and preach he said I said I'm
[1:16:46] not a pastor and they said they are not
[1:16:48] Believers with God grace
[1:16:54] what is good
[1:16:58] then I came to know why God
[1:17:00] put me in the prison
[1:17:05] first day the first day I mean Friday
[1:17:07] night I never sleep I was crying just
[1:17:10] like I don't know why I came here
[1:17:12] I started believing Jesus Christ and I
[1:17:15] started reading messages there I don't
[1:17:17] know what was happening I'm just
[1:17:19] thinking that maybe something I did
[1:17:20] wrong so the reason I came here but I
[1:17:22] don't know why God sent me there
[1:17:25] praise God
[1:17:27] so then I went there and I took the same
[1:17:30] Bible and I preached it for 30 minutes
[1:17:33] and after preaching after finishing up
[1:17:35] preaching there were a lot of tears in
[1:17:37] me
[1:17:38] and I was walking somebody came to me he
[1:17:41] said what was your name
[1:17:42] I was not able to tell my name then he
[1:17:44] said maybe whatever your name is from
[1:17:46] today we'll call you Paul
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:51] because I appreciate Paul's The Prisoner
[1:17:53] yeah
[1:17:56] so all the my colleague president
[1:17:59] started calling me Paul they named me
[1:18:01] Paul
[1:18:05] from second day to seventh day I never
[1:18:08] feared one one thing ever one thing
[1:18:11] because I know that why I was there
[1:18:14] amen God has a plan
[1:18:17] praise the Lord I'll tell you one thing
[1:18:19] if you do good things then sometimes you
[1:18:21] will be in the prison
[1:18:25] are you sure
[1:18:27] see Joseph passed the examination that
[1:18:29] was connected by God
[1:18:32] for the Vera wife
[1:18:34] right
[1:18:36] did Joseph was the examination or not
[1:18:37] yeah
[1:18:38] it was a distinction he got sent percent
[1:18:41] marks then God gave him a promotion he's
[1:18:44] supposed to give a promotion God sent
[1:18:46] him in the prison
[1:18:49] you know why
[1:18:52] they are true persons in the prison
[1:18:54] very close to the king amen Joseph's
[1:18:57] supposed to be next king yes so they are
[1:19:00] there to to they're there to explain how
[1:19:04] to be a king
[1:19:06] that's the reason God sent him in
[1:19:10] praise the Lord
[1:19:12] say God will act like that
[1:19:15] so when when I was when I'm going into
[1:19:18] the prison then I'm a Believer
[1:19:20] when I'm coming out I'm a pastor
[1:19:25] see God made me pass in the prison
[1:19:27] see the same way when Peter was in the

[1:19:34] get sleep with the prison there's one
[1:19:35] I'm trying to tell you now
[1:19:37] you don't get sleep with the prison
[1:19:39] right because tomorrow next day morning

[1:19:44] and before the day they killed his
[1:19:46] brother Jacob
