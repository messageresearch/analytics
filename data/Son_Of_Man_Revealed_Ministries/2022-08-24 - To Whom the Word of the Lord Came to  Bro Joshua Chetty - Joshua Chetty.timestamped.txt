[22:36] reading from chapter 18
[22:39] read from verse 16
[22:42] genesis chapter 18 reading from verse 16
[22:50] and the men rose up from theirs and
[22:52] looked towards sodom abraham went with
[22:55] them to bring them on the way
[22:57] and the lord said
[22:59] shall i hide from ibrahim
[23:01] that thing which i do
[23:05] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[23:07] a great and mighty nation amen amen
[23:11] and all the nations of the earth shall
[23:13] be blessed in him
[23:15] for i know him
[23:17] see this is a personal relationship amen
[23:21] the lord don't want to hide
[23:23] his mystery from abraham amen
[23:26] amen amen he says
[23:29] that he will command his children yes
[23:33] and his household after him
[23:37] amen
[23:38] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[23:41] yes
[23:42] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[23:45] may bring upon ibrahim that which he had
[23:49] spoken of him
[23:51] the lord wanted to reveal this mystery
[23:53] to abraham
[23:55] because abraham will command his
[23:57] children amen
[23:59] amen and there's been a spiritual father
[24:01] in this day amen
[24:04] another
[24:06] one with seven letters amen amen and
[24:09] came and stood up the food because why
[24:11] he will command that she's spiritual
[24:14] children amen and they
[24:16] shall keep the way of the lord
[24:19] when will it come in a time when it's
[24:21] like sodom
[24:23] amen when the world is in another
[24:26] southern condition yes amen god will not
[24:28] withdrawals amen what he wants to do
[24:31] amen amen
[24:33] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[24:36] may bring upon abraham that which he had
[24:39] spoken of him
[24:40] iman you may be seated
[24:42] thank god for the reading of his word
[24:46] so here the lord
[24:49] we know what happened there to the time
[24:50] of judgment amen
[24:53] but we know that abraham was typing
[24:55] adriam and sarah was typing the bride
[24:57] yes because they before
[25:01] the destruction upon sodom they had a
[25:03] visitation yes amen amen wherein
[25:08] god could discern sarah's hearts and
[25:10] thoughts
[25:13] and we revealed that that was revealing
[25:15] that mystery that will happen in this
[25:17] day amen
[25:18] and that was before the promised sun
[25:20] could come
[25:22] but upon that visitation
[25:24] and that revealing of sarah's heart took
[25:26] place after that we know that you dare
[25:28] to be a body change yes
[25:33] and abraham recognized when the angel of
[25:36] god when god appeared to him
[25:39] because why the three men worked there
[25:40] and he said my lord amen he didn't say
[25:43] my lord yeah amen so this was in
[25:46] revelation
[25:47] and it was revealed to abraham
[25:50] yes
[25:52] abraham could identify his god amen amen
[25:56] amen
[25:59] we know that we are living the time when
[26:01] the seven seals have been open
[26:04] amen
[26:05] and we find that all these mysteries
[26:07] have been revealed to us because it says
[26:09] in the days of the voice of the seven
[26:11] angel yes when he shall begin to sound
[26:14] the mystery of god shall be
[26:16] finished as he declared to his servants
[26:19] the prophets
[26:21] and then tonight we're speaking on the
[26:23] rapture
[26:24] and to whom the word of the lord came
[26:27] amen because we know the rapture
[26:30] is not a public show yes amen the
[26:33] rapture is a great secret yes amen that
[26:36] god kept away
[26:38] i was listening to a clip last night
[26:41] and one of these theologians was
[26:42] speaking about the prophet
[26:44] and it's amazing how
[26:46] they started the clip and they'll speak
[26:48] about
[26:49] the supernatural things that took place
[26:52] and then as they go on they say
[26:54] but william branham was meant for the
[26:56] prayer lines
[26:58] is he
[27:00] he was nowhere to be a preacher
[27:02] and there was
[27:04] there was uplifting uh
[27:07] uh people like jima shikarian and so
[27:10] forth
[27:11] people that would leave the prophets
[27:14] you see you see how blind they are
[27:17] and these people were going by
[27:21] yesterday
[27:22] things that they heard
[27:24] and they spoke about the prophet's end
[27:25] but they wouldn't go back in the bible
[27:27] and look at how all the dark ages and
[27:29] all these all the apostles and how they
[27:31] all died amen and all these things and
[27:34] they find that the prophet have died
[27:36] prematurely
[27:38] but the prophet and he mentioned one the
[27:40] starting statement he spoke about the
[27:41] time the period where the prophet just
[27:43] left them when they had all these places
[27:44] booked
[27:45] what they didn't realize
[27:47] because that was for him to go and meet
[27:51] and have his personal experience of god
[27:53] because it was time of the coming of the
[27:55] seven angels amen
[27:57] they didn't know it wasn't for them
[27:59] because why
[28:00] it was a status
[28:02] of the rapture cycle amen and this would
[28:05] not be a public show amen because under
[28:08] that first two polls
[28:09] they was using him for the prayer line
[28:12] they booked all these places and things
[28:14] like that
[28:15] but they don't know that god used it for
[28:16] his purpose amen that was just an
[28:19] attraction yes
[28:21] but he was hunting he was fishing there
[28:23] for the rainbow trout amen
[28:26] amen then he had to go off the scene
[28:29] and go to and follow the leadership of
[28:31] the holy spirit yeah and he speaks about
[28:34] it the year before
[28:36] so this is the time of the end
[28:39] and he gives the vision and he speaks
[28:41] division right there and then scripture
[28:44] must be fulfilled amen
[28:48] you see they missed all these things
[28:51] but literally no that's why you said you
[28:53] had to bypass the theologians yes it had
[28:56] to come the word of the lord have to
[28:58] come to the prophet amen yes because the
[29:01] prophet could identify who he was amen
[29:04] the prophet could say that's my lord up
[29:06] there amen
[29:07] because why the start of the rapture
[29:10] cycle had to come amen
[29:15] let's turn our bibles to the book of
[29:16] second preacher
[29:18] in chapter 1 verse
[29:26] amen
[29:30] the rain falls on the just and the
[29:32] unjust we know that
[29:34] so the word of the lord came to
[29:35] everybody was preached to everybody
[29:38] but it was not revealed to him amen
[29:41] amen
[29:43] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[29:46] to the knowledge of god and of
[29:48] jesus our lord
[29:49] according as his divine power had given
[29:51] unto a house all things that pertain
[29:53] unto life and godliness
[29:56] through the knowledge of him that it
[29:57] called us to glory and virtue
[30:00] whereby are given and she was exceeding
[30:02] great and precious promises
[30:05] that by these ye might be partakers of
[30:07] the divine nature
[30:10] having escaped the corruption that is in
[30:13] the world to lust
[30:15] amen yes not everybody have been given
[30:18] to be partakers of the divine nature
[30:20] amen amen there to be a new birth yes
[30:24] yes you have to die to that old man yes
[30:27] amen
[30:28] because that old man brought you in
[30:31] brought you into this world speaking
[30:32] lives
[30:33] shaped in inequity born in sin
[30:36] it comes from that old nature
[30:38] because of the first man adam all have
[30:41] fallen into depth yeah but by the second
[30:44] adam amen
[30:46] we have the opportunity now to be
[30:47] partakers of the divine nature amen
[30:51] and beside this
[30:53] giving all diligence add to your faith
[30:56] virtue amen here's the man that's
[30:58] walking in the rapture cycle now amen
[31:01] head to your faith virtue and to your
[31:03] virtue knowledge
[31:05] and to knowledge temperance and to
[31:07] temperance patience and to patient
[31:09] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[31:12] kindness
[31:13] and to brotherly kindness charity amen
[31:16] for if these things be in you and abound
[31:19] they make you that they shall neither be
[31:22] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[31:26] of our lord jesus christ amen
[31:30] but he that lacked these things is blind
[31:34] you see
[31:35] they can be preaching the gospel
[31:37] they can have the gifts of the holy
[31:39] spirit
[31:41] but they don't have the holy spirit
[31:43] himself
[31:44] the person of the holy ghost
[31:47] is not dwelling in them yeah the person
[31:49] of the holy ghost is not there to
[31:51] navigate their lives
[31:53] the person of the holy ghost is not
[31:55] there to teach them
[31:56] because he is the teacher amen he will
[31:59] bring you into knowledge of all these
[32:01] glorious truths amen he will reveal he
[32:03] will enlighten you on this word
[32:06] and he will make you realize that this
[32:09] day we had a visitation this day
[32:12] and through this prophet he came and
[32:15] revealed himself amen hallelujah
[32:22] but he that look at this thing is blind
[32:24] who's blind this lady's here in church
[32:26] amen
[32:30] and cannot see a far off
[32:33] you see they're looking for the flesh
[32:35] they're looking for the time that
[32:36] they're living in they're looking at in
[32:37] this world cosmos yes but to us
[32:40] we have been taken to an unseen world
[32:43] we have been shown a far off amen amen
[32:47] while we are seated here we are now
[32:49] seated in heavenly places in christ
[32:52] jesus yes you can look beyond this
[32:54] dimension
[32:55] amen because why there was one that went
[32:58] beyond the curtain of time amen that
[33:00] told us about another world amen there
[33:02] was the one that came and came to win in
[33:04] spite of the land and come to give us a
[33:07] good report amen
[33:12] and have forgotten that he was purged
[33:14] from his old sins yes wherefore the
[33:17] rather brethren give diligence to make
[33:19] your calling an election sure
[33:23] for if you do these things shall never
[33:25] fall
[33:26] for someone entering shall be ministered
[33:28] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[33:31] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[33:33] christ
[33:35] now if you read that scripture
[33:37] and if you look at it
[33:38] you might say now do i have to go and
[33:40] make myself do this now you cannot do
[33:42] that on your own amen that takes the
[33:45] grace of god yes
[33:47] and that takes divine revelation he has
[33:49] to bring you into his word amen and he
[33:52] takes the leadership of the holy spirit
[33:54] to build you up because what they don't
[33:56] realize that god is building you up
[34:01] like our enoch in the time when we build
[34:03] this pyramid it was a type of this body
[34:06] of christ
[34:07] because this is typing the body of
[34:09] christ that she will come into this
[34:11] perfect image amen amen amen this is
[34:13] building you up into an image amen which
[34:15] is the temple of god amen and you just
[34:18] come into the most holy temple yes amen
[34:22] we're not talking about a literal temple
[34:24] we're talking about the most holy temple
[34:27] because what this is the temple that god
[34:29] will dwell in amen
[34:38] he said
[34:39] but each age god has placed these things
[34:42] into his church
[34:44] and threatened it by showing that each
[34:46] individual as these possess these
[34:49] qualities
[34:50] and this being when it's completed is
[34:52] the church of god going to rapture amen
[34:57] so this is the age
[34:59] where this body must come into the image
[35:02] amen
[35:04] because in the time when jesus gave up
[35:06] the ghosts
[35:08] and he says when he gave up the ghost
[35:11] the graves were opened
[35:13] and he says
[35:14] at his resurrection they raised up from
[35:16] the graves yes
[35:19] where where did they raise up
[35:21] at his resurrection they raised up from
[35:24] the graves
[35:25] that was his resurrection of his literal
[35:27] body
[35:28] and now it is a resurrection of his
[35:31] spiritual body amen
[35:33] and if this is the hour where the body
[35:35] is raised up
[35:36] the rising of the sun and the rising of
[35:39] the body amen is the rising of the son
[35:42] in this day
[35:43] rising of christ the body of christ has
[35:46] risen up from all these ages amen amen
[35:49] then what are we living in now amen
[35:51] there must be a time when there must be
[35:53] an emptying out yes amen if this body is
[35:56] risen up and she's rised up in a power
[35:58] right up rise up as the body of christ
[36:00] in this hour
[36:02] and recognizing a position in christ
[36:04] recognizing who she is now so this is
[36:07] the hour where there must be an empty
[36:09] house amen because in the time of the
[36:11] literal
[36:13] body of christ raising up
[36:15] two thousand years ago
[36:17] the graves
[36:20] people raised up from the graves the old
[36:22] testament sins
[36:24] and if that pattern was in the bible we
[36:25] must find his scripture amen if that
[36:27] pattern it was in the bible it must
[36:29] happen now a mess when this body is
[36:31] raised up that means that when this body
[36:33] is ready should i say
[36:35] when she's raised up and come to a
[36:36] position when she's come to that super
[36:38] church when she's recognized to be that
[36:40] super race when she recognized to be
[36:43] that invincible honey amen amen she
[36:45] become the final hour in the final voice
[36:47] in the final day amen then there must be
[36:50] an emptying out
[36:52] of that sixth dimension
[36:55] and if you can show me any other our
[36:57] ways closer now
[36:59] this is our
[37:00] man
[37:01] and this being incompleted is a servant
[37:03] of god in the church of god that's going
[37:06] in the rapture glory see what i mean
[37:09] there you are that's the full thing
[37:12] [Music]
[37:15] it says and then god through that has
[37:18] brought also seven church ages to show
[37:21] the seven steps that he brought
[37:24] building his individual into his image
[37:26] yes
[37:28] he built a complete church in his image
[37:31] amen
[37:31] [Music]
[37:33] so this body must be in that image yes
[37:35] amen
[37:38] that body must be that
[37:40] city that will come down amen
[37:42] and he's not made up of just this church
[37:44] age is made up of seven church ages amen
[37:48] amen this pyramid city is made up of
[37:50] seven church ages yes amen and at the
[37:54] resurrection
[37:56] this complete body will be raised up to
[37:59] live with him forever
[38:01] because it is a bride
[38:03] so that cuts in every age every age that
[38:06] comes yes
[38:09] amen
[38:09] [Music]
[38:11] now
[38:12] when he visited abraham he said he knows
[38:13] abraham
[38:15] god said i know abraham
[38:18] because why
[38:19] he was part of god yes amen he was an
[38:22] attribute of god
[38:24] everything about hatred on earth was
[38:26] displaying the characteristics of god
[38:28] yes
[38:30] amen
[38:32] and there must be a bride in this day
[38:35] just like how there was and it there was
[38:38] one in this day
[38:40] that came as the first chief
[38:44] way before us as a true example of how
[38:48] every son and daughter of god should be
[38:52] the one that manifested the attributes
[38:54] of god yeah the one that can add the
[38:57] characteristics of christ
[39:00] and now after him many others will come
[39:03] because why they believe these words yes
[39:05] amen amen if any word that he received
[39:09] they will receive amen
[39:11] because what revelation 10 8 11 says
[39:14] john went and took the book amen and he
[39:16] began to eat the book amen amen and that
[39:18] was typing the bride
[39:22] to whom the word of the lord came amen
[39:25] amen did the word of the lord come to
[39:27] you
[39:28] amen
[39:32] so god
[39:33] looked at abraham and he said
[39:35] basically he said
[39:36] shall i withdraw from abraham what i'm
[39:37] gonna do he began to reveal the mystery
[39:40] to him yes he began to unlock the
[39:43] secrets of how he has been destroying
[39:45] man sodom and tomorrow
[39:48] and he began to unlock
[39:50] he began to open up break that seven
[39:53] seals when he come
[39:55] revelation down
[39:55] 1 comes down
[39:57] and he opened up that seven seals yes he
[40:00] unlocked the mysteries to us amen or
[40:02] what's been happening in all ages yes
[40:05] how the writer was writing
[40:07] and how he's what he's doing right now
[40:09] in the shower and how he's going to
[40:11] deceive how his writing now receiving
[40:13] the nation
[40:14] and helen that followed him didn't help
[40:17] follow him
[40:20] so you see we're not unawares of what is
[40:22] happening amen
[40:23] and we can see the world in the
[40:25] condition that they're going in
[40:26] and man is getting deceived
[40:28] thinking he's living on yeah now he's
[40:31] excited because why he says no the
[40:33] covert is finished
[40:35] and everything is back to normal
[40:37] you see the scoffers will rise up
[40:40] thinking that everything is normal
[40:42] what they don't realize what was
[40:44] happening behind the scenes
[40:46] they can't identify what was happening
[40:48] in the russia war
[40:49] why they had to be that war they don't
[40:52] realize that israel was going back to
[40:54] the homeland amen they don't realize
[40:56] that the kings of the north was
[40:57] gathering
[40:59] they don't realize
[41:01] that rome was also calling the people
[41:03] together behind the scenes
[41:08] you see
[41:09] then the prophet says she can start to
[41:11] walk she can stop her amen
[41:14] they don't see that and they think
[41:16] everything is back to normal
[41:24] that's why
[41:25] the world could
[41:27] criticize the cloud
[41:29] what is this mysterious cloud
[41:31] it was a rocket it was this it was that
[41:34] or the other
[41:35] but to whom the word of the lord came
[41:37] we'll understand we'll take that cloud
[41:40] we'll look at the vision of the prophet
[41:42] the year before we'll take it in the
[41:44] scripture it says revelation 10 1
[41:46] and then you can put a date to it when
[41:48] was revelation 101 fulfilled 1963
[41:51] take a date and put it to it
[41:54] because why she will understand when was
[41:57] angel why was angel descended amen what
[42:00] was the purpose
[42:01] because why
[42:02] the book had to be opened your name had
[42:05] to be revealed amen amen redemption had
[42:07] to be revealed to you amen redemption
[42:10] god had to show you that i'm taking you
[42:12] back to your original condition yes
[42:16] i was discussing with brother adrian the
[42:17] other day i said you know it's not like
[42:20] taking if somebody stole something from
[42:22] me and saying i'm going to give you
[42:23] something else to compensate you for
[42:24] that
[42:25] no this is giving me back what i'm
[42:27] supposed to
[42:29] yes not something else yeah
[42:36] that's why job when the bible said god
[42:38] given him all these things
[42:40] god job could have
[42:42] what he originally had
[42:44] amen job could have that he could see
[42:47] the last days he could see his redeemer
[42:50] on the earth amen yes he had them he had
[42:53] the revelation of that god revealed it
[42:56] to him
[42:57] what's gonna happen in the last day he
[42:59] said i know my redeemer liveth amen
[43:03] amen and he knew in his flesh he will
[43:05] see god yes
[43:06] [Music]

[45:40] sixty and five years
[45:43] and enoch walked with god they sing that
[45:45] thing again they're saying that part
[45:46] again now the scripture is emphasizing
[45:48] now and enoch worked with god
[45:52] and he was not for god took him
[45:55] yes the seventh one
[45:57] that walked with god
[45:59] he is the seventh one who god revealed
[46:02] himself to amen
[46:04] to whom the word of the lord came yes
[46:07] amen to whom the word of the lord came
[46:10] will have a translation
[46:12] to whom
[46:13] [Music]
[46:17] the one that communicated with god
[46:20] amen and therefore he built that pyramid
[46:23] because there was gonna be typing the
[46:25] pride amen amen because we know that
[46:27] pyramid was the type of the bible yes
[46:30] before that they were studying the stars
[46:32] amen
[46:33] and then he looks type is bullying the
[46:34] predator was typing for the type of the
[46:36] bible amen and then we have the written

[46:40] and now we have the word who are now in
[46:44] human flesh again
[46:46] we are the living apostles read and all
[46:48] known of all men amen the bible now is a
[46:51] body of christ
[46:52] displaying the word she is coming to the
[46:55] word image amen
[46:57] [Music]
[46:59] so if you want to see the word now it
[47:01] must be displayed in human flesh
[47:04] it must be a manifested word
[47:06] this is the hour where the word must be
[47:08] manifested yes
[47:12] because we know the letter killers by
[47:14] the spirit giveth life amen amen this is
[47:18] the hour for life giving
[47:22] amen now enoch had a personal
[47:26] relationship with god amen
[47:29] he has a man that's going in the rapture
[47:31] the man that has a personal work with
[47:33] god
[47:34] the man that will guide yourself yes the
[47:37] man will say surrender himself i want to
[47:39] be a prisoner of christ
[47:41] the man will not take man-made creeds
[47:43] man-made dogmas
[47:45] the man that recognized that whom the
[47:47] word of the lord came to
[47:51] because that's what happened in this day
[47:53] they refused to accept the messenger
[47:55] yes
[47:56] and the messenger was the key to the age
[47:59] amen
[48:00] he unlocking the mysteries but they
[48:03] refused to accept the
[48:04] messenger by those that came and
[48:07] accepted the messenger and his message
[48:09] and has become one with the message
[48:12] they are that's the man that's going in
[48:14] the rapture amen that's the one to whom
[48:16] the word of the lord come to amen that's
[48:19] the one that's going to be a living
[48:20] epistle that's going to be read and
[48:22] known of all men amen that's the man
[48:24] that's sitting now in heavenly places in
[48:27] christ jesus
[48:29] that's the man that can see far off amen
[48:32] that's the man that's partakers of his
[48:34] divine nature amen in other words if
[48:37] he's particularly divine nature
[48:38] recognizing now it's not my spirit
[48:41] that's living in me but the spirit of
[48:42] christ working through me amen
[48:45] [Music]
[48:53] so that was enoch's rapture amen yes
[48:56] and the book of jude says and enoch
[48:58] lived
[49:00] sorry and enoch also the seven from adam
[49:04] prophesied of these things saying behold
[49:07] the lord covered with ten thousand of
[49:09] his saints
[49:12] to execute judgment upon all
[49:16] and to convince all that are ungodly
[49:18] among them of their ungodly deeds which
[49:22] they have ungodly committed
[49:24] and of all there are speeches which
[49:27] ungodly sinners have spoken against him
[49:30] what they mean by speaking against him
[49:32] he's not just talking about the people
[49:33] that spoke about him two thousand years
[49:35] ago
[49:37] about the one that spoke against his
[49:39] words
[49:40] all the ages amen and in this last day
[49:43] they will come against his words
[49:45] those that come and crucified the word
[49:48] they come and rejected this christ
[49:50] through his word amen
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] these are murmurs complainers
[49:57] walking after their own lust
[49:59] and their mouth speaking great swelling
[50:01] words like as i was telling you now
[50:04] this theologian was speaking last night
[50:06] speaking about how they are protecting
[50:08] the people from false doctrines
[50:14] and having men's persons in admiration
[50:17] because of advantage
[50:19] what's the advantage they want material
[50:20] gain
[50:22] they want to gain popularity yes they
[50:24] want to gain money they want all these
[50:27] things from the that will satisfy the
[50:28] flesh
[50:31] but there was a prophet of god that was
[50:32] willing
[50:33] everyone would reject him
[50:35] all the people that was around him
[50:37] arranging all his crusades and the
[50:39] campaign the 10 meetings and so forth
[50:41] they all will reject him
[50:43] when when it comes to the time of the
[50:45] opening of the word
[50:47] under the first two pulls
[50:48] an evil and adulterous generation
[50:51] seeking after signs
[50:52] coming in the message coming for all the
[50:54] meeting giving support to the meetings
[50:57] but when it comes to the opening of the
[50:58] world yes
[50:59] this would not be a public show
[51:02] because why
[51:04] this wasn't wasn't for everybody amen
[51:07] amen
[51:09] the book of 1 thessalonians chapter 4
[51:12] verse 13
[51:15] and i would not have you to be ignorant
[51:17] brethren concerning them which are
[51:18] asleep
[51:19] that you sorrow not even at others which
[51:22] have no hope when we believe that jesus
[51:24] died and rose again even so them also
[51:27] would sleep in jesus will god bring with
[51:30] him for this we say unto you by the word
[51:32] of the lord that we which are alive and
[51:34] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[51:36] not prevent them which are asleep
[51:38] for the lord himself shall descend from
[51:40] heaven with a shout amen
[51:43] with the voice of the archangel and with
[51:45] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[51:47] shall rise first
[51:49] then we which are alive and remain shall
[51:51] be caught up together with them in the
[51:53] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[51:55] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[51:59] [Music]
[52:02] now we know
[52:06] in the rapture message
[52:08] the prophet is telling us
[52:11] [Music]
[52:14] he says now i want you to notice a great
[52:16] thing taking place here now don't miss
[52:18] this
[52:19] the word year says in second
[52:21] thessalonians that
[52:24] there is three things
[52:27] from the 13th to the 16th verse there's
[52:29] three things
[52:30] that has to happen before the lord
[52:32] himself appears yes
[52:36] he's talking about before he corporately
[52:37] appears
[52:38] amen
[52:40] quickly now so we can close the first
[52:42] thing happens
[52:43] notice they shout yes
[52:46] a voice he trumpets he lays it out
[52:49] for the lord himself shall descend from
[52:51] heaven with a shout and the voice of the
[52:52] archangel the trump of god three things
[52:54] a void sorry a shout a voice a trumpet
[52:58] it has to happen before jesus appeared
[53:00] amen now a shout jesus does all three of
[53:03] them when he's descending
[53:06] a shout what is the shout it's the
[53:08] message going forth first amen the
[53:12] living bread of life bringing forth the
[53:14] bride
[53:15] so that was the start of the rapture
[53:18] the cycle of the rapture process
[53:20] was a shout amen which was the message
[53:23] going forth amen to gather the living
[53:26] saints

[56:08] you a scientific explanation for you
[56:10] amen
[56:12] because you can tie it back to the words

[56:42] him yes and we could recognize that we
[56:44] are part of him yes amen we could
[56:47] recognize that all that he has we are
[56:49] co-heirs with him yes amen

[56:55] always part of this mystery amen
[56:58] we are always the back part of god's
[57:00] mind he could take us right to the back
[57:02] part of god's mind
[57:04] show me which theologian can take you
[57:05] and do that
[57:07] because why if you're not particularly
[57:10] divine it you cannot see a fire off amen
[57:12] oh man
[57:15] he says the first thing comes when he
[57:17] starts descending from heaven there's a
[57:19] shout what is it a message to get the

[57:45] body no matter whether you defeat no
[57:47] matter which part you are but you have a
[57:49] part to play in that body
[57:51] amen
[57:53] amen
[57:54] you might have different gifts in the
[57:56] body but you are part of that body and
[57:58] each one is needed amen there's no one
[58:02] greater than the other yes
[58:05] and no one can do without the other in
[58:08] the body
[58:10] if one part of the body is sick then
[58:12] other part will also feel it
[58:15] hey man if the leg got a problem oh the
[58:18] whole body is battling because of the
[58:19] leg yes
[58:21] if the stomach got a problem the whole
[58:22] body is battering because of that
[58:26] so each one is quickly joined together
[58:29] amen

[58:55] yes when he come to the seventh
[58:57] he was translated
[58:59] we had all six ages amen and everyone
[59:02] had to go by the way of deaths
[59:04] but when we come to the servants
[59:06] amen we know that we're not talking
[59:08] about people who go by the way i'm
[59:09] talking as an age amen this is the age
[59:12] that will meet the condition for the
[59:14] rapture amen amen in the seventh world
[59:17] champion in that seven age this is the
[59:20] age that will meet the condition that
[59:22] was a condition whereby you can have
[59:25] rapturing faith amen because why he was
[59:27] given rapture in grace amen amen
[59:31] so it's a time to be a it's time to rise
[59:34] and swim your land yes
[59:36] why i say rise because there must be a
[59:39] rising of the bright
[59:41] because this body had to rise
[59:43] amen
[59:44] just like our 2000 years ago jesus body
[59:47] had to be resurrected
[59:49] and then the graves
[59:50] let out his bodies
[59:52] just like that his body had to come now
[59:53] and rise in power yes
[59:55] rise to that invincible army rise to
[59:58] that super race rise to this
[1:00:00] characteristic that's spoken of her yes
[1:00:03] that there must be an emptying out amen

[1:00:13] the redemption of our bodies we are
[1:00:15] waiting for the redemption of our
[1:00:18] bodies
[1:00:21] that's why healing was given as a sign
[1:00:25] that certain body part needs to be
[1:00:27] healed
[1:00:28] it's a sign that your body needs to be
[1:00:30] completely healed
[1:00:32] in when you are translated it's a
[1:00:33] complete healing of the body amen
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:41] and they did some of them found they
[1:00:43] didn't even have any oil in the lamb but
[1:00:45] his lamb trimming time

[1:00:52] seventh behold the bridegroom comets in
[1:00:55] the seven ones there was a cry amen
[1:00:57] rise and trim your lamps and they did
[1:01:00] some of them found that it didn't have
[1:01:01] any oil in the lamp but it's lamb
[1:01:04] swimming time
[1:01:05] it's malachi 4 time
[1:01:07] it's promised luke 17 time all those
[1:01:10] prophecies that perfectly set forth in
[1:01:12] order is talking about that time when
[1:01:14] the word was coming so what hour is it
[1:01:16] now
[1:01:17] now it's over where the body is risen up
[1:01:20] where he says now thou
[1:01:22] must prophesy amen now is the hour where
[1:01:26] you become the final voice
[1:01:28] in this final age
[1:01:30] this is the bride ministry now amen it
[1:01:32] was a time for a luke 17 30 ministry
[1:01:35] it was a time for malachi 4 ministry you
[1:01:37] know the time for revelation 10 7
[1:01:39] ministry but now it's the hour for
[1:01:41] revelation 10 8 to 11 ministry amen
[1:01:44] remember the body has risen yes amen
[1:01:51] amen it's a very late hour we're living
[1:01:53] in
[1:01:54] i hope you can see where i'm getting at
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:57] we have received such a great message
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:03] imagine
[1:02:04] this the world didn't see this but from
[1:02:07] eternity
[1:02:10] seven angels came down and formed the
[1:02:12] trouble
[1:02:13] from eternity yes
[1:02:15] and man when a debate would god
[1:02:18] man want to debate with the supernatural
[1:02:22] when you debate with the supernatural
[1:02:26] in
[1:02:27] you are missing the promises of god
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:33] a prophet that was four days before the
[1:02:35] foundation of the world yes it was on
[1:02:37] the scene
[1:02:39] yes the denomination all of them call
[1:02:41] him a great prophet because they don't
[1:02:42] call him the prophet
[1:02:44] for the messenger of the age but they
[1:02:46] don't recognize him as a prophet as a
[1:02:48] word prophet
[1:02:49] remember this was the word prophet yes
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:52] this prophet had to bring the word for
[1:02:54] the age yes
[1:02:57] they recognized him just because of the
[1:02:58] miracles because of him
[1:03:00] deserving the hearts and thoughts of
[1:03:02] people
[1:03:03] that's how they recognize him
[1:03:06] but we recognize him because the message
[1:03:08] that he brought
[1:03:10] because we know that all of us come in
[1:03:12] because we are stimulated by the
[1:03:14] revelation of the world and that word
[1:03:16] still stimulates us yes because we know
[1:03:19] the only thing that energizes us is the
[1:03:20] stimulation of revelation
[1:03:22] that's what makes you jump for joy
[1:03:24] that's what makes you shout amen get
[1:03:26] what makes you want to dance that's what
[1:03:29] makes you want to praise him that's what
[1:03:30] makes you want to sing amen
[1:03:33] when you have that stimulation of
[1:03:34] revelation when you are drunk in that
[1:03:37] spirit
[1:03:39] you've got to have something that's
[1:03:41] happening within you yes and you show it
[1:03:43] on the out outside amen
[1:03:45] you can't hold it anymore because why
[1:03:47] bubbling from within you amen
[1:03:50] and one of these days is very word
[1:03:52] that's bubbling in you that word that's
[1:03:53] in you oh this body can't only
[1:03:56] anymore he's just gonna translate
[1:03:58] amen amen he's gonna take you to another
[1:04:00] dimension amen
[1:04:05] he said if you're in christ there's not
[1:04:07] a word written in here but what you
[1:04:09] believe it
[1:04:11] i don't care what anybody else said
[1:04:14] we don't care we don't care what the
[1:04:15] skeptics say that's right amen
[1:04:18] yes in fact if you've got discernment
[1:04:21] and you've got revelation
[1:04:22] you will see how inferior the theology
[1:04:24] is and the reasoning is to the wisdom of
[1:04:28] god yes they are so inferior
[1:04:31] they might buy out the scriptures that
[1:04:32] sounds profound to some certain people
[1:04:35] but
[1:04:36] those that are full of the holy ghost
[1:04:37] will not be astonished by them yeah but
[1:04:39] when you speak
[1:04:40] mystery truths amen to people that are
[1:04:43] eating from the garbage can
[1:04:45] because they're in spiritual famine
[1:04:46] that's right because why
[1:04:48] under joseph stores money there was food
[1:04:51] amen yes so when you are speaking
[1:04:54] mysterious troops after they
[1:04:57] they're trying to find a spiritual meal
[1:04:58] from a garbage can from those joel
[1:05:00] osteen from the tv jigs from all these
[1:05:02] people that are receiving them and you
[1:05:04] speak this mysterious truth they are
[1:05:06] astounded by your script sorry about the
[1:05:08] things that you are saying they are
[1:05:09] astonished by what you are saying amen
[1:05:12] because what you are saying makes sense
[1:05:15] what you are saying ties up with events
[1:05:17] that are happening right now
[1:05:19] what you are saying he ties up with
[1:05:21] modern day events made clear by prophecy
[1:05:24] hallelujah amen
[1:05:26] that is why you still have to prophesy
[1:05:27] amen that is why until the lord comes
[1:05:32] you have to go out and prophesy again
[1:05:34] amen amen and you're not talking about
[1:05:37] just the
[1:05:38] they got those preachers to preach the
[1:05:39] fundamental gospel we're talking about
[1:05:41] preaching
[1:05:42] this gospel this message man this
[1:05:45] message that's revealed
[1:05:47] to you when the the opening of the world
[1:05:48] we're not talking about a closed book we
[1:05:50] talk about preaching from an open book
[1:05:53] that's what the world needs to hear
[1:05:55] until the lord comes he's preaching from
[1:05:57] an open book
[1:05:58] don't be ashamed to preach from an open
[1:06:00] book don't be ashamed of that you
[1:06:02] received because let me tell you
[1:06:04] something they might come and buy the
[1:06:06] entire bible to you they might come and
[1:06:08] explain to you the greek meaning they
[1:06:10] might explain to you the hebrew meaning
[1:06:12] but they cannot explain between the
[1:06:14] lines amen
[1:06:18] because why to you it's revealed plainly
[1:06:20] yeah
[1:06:22] he said i don't care what anybody else
[1:06:24] said and that good then god makes that
[1:06:27] thing manifested because you when he
[1:06:29] pours the spirit upon the word what
[1:06:31] happened just like putting water on any
[1:06:33] seed it will live and bring forth
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:36] amen so we spoke about enoch then there
[1:06:39] was elijah amen
[1:06:41] being a prophet the word of the lord
[1:06:43] came to him yes he knew on a certain day
[1:06:46] he's going to be translated
[1:06:48] he didn't just walk
[1:06:50] he wasn't walking from one position to
[1:06:52] another
[1:06:53] no it was a strategic work
[1:06:55] hey man he was strategically working
[1:06:58] from one location to another amen until
[1:07:00] they had to even tell you to cross over
[1:07:03] jordan but it was strategically walking
[1:07:06] we're not just walking anyhow
[1:07:08] inappropriately amen amen we are
[1:07:10] positionally placed in this land to the
[1:07:13] holy ghost amen and we are walking along
[1:07:15] this journey amen what we walk into we
[1:07:18] are walking to the rapture
[1:07:19] we are walking through this rapture
[1:07:20] journey yeah and we are strategically
[1:07:23] walking what i'm talking about there's a
[1:07:24] progression in the
[1:07:26] world the time it was revealed from 1963
[1:07:29] from the opening of the world to 2022
[1:07:32] there has been a progression in the
[1:07:34] world hallelujah what i'm trying to say
[1:07:36] as light is needed light is given
[1:07:39] revelation upon revelation upon
[1:07:41] revelation yes amen the word is becoming
[1:07:43] more clearer the word is unfolding more
[1:07:46] and more yes
[1:07:48] because why you need it for this hour
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:52] so he says now
[1:07:54] it's the first thing it's astounding
[1:07:56] the first thing is a trumpet
[1:07:58] a shout and a voice in a trumpet
[1:08:00] shout a messenger getting the people
[1:08:02] ready
[1:08:03] the second is the voice of the
[1:08:05] resurrection
[1:08:06] the same voice
[1:08:08] that loud voice insane john 11 38 to 44
[1:08:13] that call lazarus from the grave
[1:08:16] getting the bride together and then the
[1:08:19] resurrection of the dead
[1:08:20] to be caught up with it
[1:08:23] now watch this thing takes place the
[1:08:25] next is what
[1:08:26] was it
[1:08:27] a shout a voice a trumpet
[1:08:32] now he says the third thing is a trumpet
[1:08:34] which always at the feast of trumpet is
[1:08:36] calling the people to the feast
[1:08:38] and that will be the bride's supper the
[1:08:40] lamb supper with the bride is in the sky
[1:08:43] you talk about wearing the seventh
[1:08:45] dimension amen where we go to meet in
[1:08:47] their wedding supper
[1:08:50] now we know
[1:08:51] just like our weak culture that feast
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:55] there must be another rapture after us
[1:08:58] we know that three raptures have already
[1:08:59] taken place enoch in the bible
[1:09:02] elijah in the bible in the time of jesus
[1:09:05] yes that's history now amen this one to
[1:09:09] take place with the bride
[1:09:11] to go to the wedding supper amen and
[1:09:13] after us
[1:09:15] there must be
[1:09:16] moses and elijah
[1:09:18] after the preaching of three and a half
[1:09:19] years
[1:09:20] they were killed the body were lying in
[1:09:22] the streets
[1:09:24] and people were watching over them for
[1:09:25] three and a half days
[1:09:27] are they watching them through the media
[1:09:29] why they wasn't touching the body maybe
[1:09:31] it was no man's land maybe at that time
[1:09:33] there was some they couldn't interfere
[1:09:35] with his bodies
[1:09:36] we don't know but that's what the bible
[1:09:38] said everybody was watching them
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:41] and then they raised up and they were
[1:09:43] absolutely amen
[1:09:45] so we are living we are living in this
[1:09:47] hour where the bride is risen up again
[1:09:50] so much to take place now amen the one
[1:09:53] that already was descending
[1:09:55] with a shout
[1:09:56] you must go and call out
[1:09:58] the sleeping sins amen because they're
[1:10:01] sitting at six dimension we are waiting
[1:10:03] for jesus to come
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:05] they're waiting for that amen
[1:10:09] and we are waiting to see them yes we
[1:10:11] are waiting to have fellowship with him
[1:10:13] amen so what happened in between
[1:10:16] what happens between you must be the
[1:10:19] manifestation of christ upon the earth
[1:10:21] christ must be reproduced through you
[1:10:23] amen amen that's the in between
[1:10:28] you become a living apostle great in all
[1:10:30] of all men you are prophesying in this
[1:10:33] hour
[1:10:34] from an open book amen
[1:10:37] to whom the word of the lord came to
[1:10:40] not for the public show but he come to
[1:10:41] you personally
[1:10:43] come to say
[1:10:44] i'm coming to take you away
[1:10:47] like how the rancher's son
[1:10:49] went and told at a certain time you
[1:10:51] don't get ready you just be ready
[1:10:54] but you're going to be my wife
[1:10:58] and she was scorned that she was mocked
[1:11:00] out
[1:11:01] to all the cousins to all the
[1:11:03] denominations
[1:11:05] why she is keeping herself for this man
[1:11:08] yet he's never taking so long to come
[1:11:10] there's so many other people that she
[1:11:11] could go through
[1:11:12] she could go to any denomination man
[1:11:15] why she keeping herself with one man
[1:11:18] but she knew she had a promise
[1:11:20] once he gave her that word
[1:11:23] she received it within a heart and it
[1:11:25] settled

[1:12:55] amen to whom the word of the lord has
[1:12:58] been revealed
[1:13:00] he says
[1:13:02] but the word justified is though you've
[1:13:04] never done it at all that's right so
[1:13:06] when we look at our lives and say
[1:13:08] but how i'm going to portray
[1:13:11] these virtues
[1:13:12] i'm going to do this i'm going to keep

[1:13:41] flesh under subjection is subdue the
[1:13:43] evil one in the battleground of the mind
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:47] amen defeating right there yes and say
[1:13:50] the blood of jesus cleanses me from all
[1:13:53] sin yes amen

[1:14:03] forget
[1:14:04] eyes could forgive you but i'll always
[1:14:06] remember you done those evil things then
[1:14:09] you're not just you're forgiven
[1:14:11] but in the height of god the bride is
[1:14:13] justified
[1:14:15] she never done it in the first place
[1:14:18] amen standing there married to the
[1:14:20] virtuous son of god
[1:14:23] never sinned in the first place why she
[1:14:25] was foreign she was trapped into this
[1:14:29] thank you lord you didn't ask to be born
[1:14:31] in this world
[1:14:32] speaking lying shamefully
[1:14:35] you come into today because of the sin
[1:14:37] of man amen
[1:14:38] but you have the opportunity
[1:14:41] to receive the new birth

[1:14:52] the kingdom of heaven
[1:14:54] he said truly truly i say unto you until
[1:14:57] you are born again you cannot understand
[1:15:01] the things that the kingdom of heaven
[1:15:02] you won't understand whatever revelation
[1:15:04] of it it will never be revealed to you
[1:15:06] because why it's not a natural thing
[1:15:08] it's not a natural you come by the
[1:15:09] natural bird but this is a supernatural
[1:15:12] birth amen this will make you because
[1:15:15] that's how we come the royal seed of
[1:15:17] abraham
[1:15:19] amen through the royal seed we come
[1:15:22] and that's why all abraham's blessings
[1:15:24] still pertain to us because we come from
[1:15:26] that royal seed
[1:15:28] and now we come by a supernatural birth
[1:15:31] amen and now we are identified with

[1:15:50] first place amen standing there married
[1:15:52] to the virtuous son of god never sinned
[1:15:54] in the first place why
[1:15:55] she was for dane she was struck into
[1:15:58] this and now when she heard the truth
[1:16:00] and come forth the blood cleansed her
[1:16:05] amen aren't you glad that the blood
[1:16:06] cleansed us amen
[1:16:08] amen because why

[1:16:12] washing of the waters of the world
[1:16:14] you come through the washing of the
[1:16:16] waters of the word
[1:16:19] and she stands there virtuous
