Lord I pray oh Lord you'll address each and every heart now in Jesus precious name thank you amen amen thank you Father amen I greet you Lord in the wonderful and precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we blessed to be in the house of the Lord once again amen I'm glad the atmosphere is charged up Hallelujah now I told Pastor Adan on Sunday I have it easy on a wedness day because the atmosphere is usually charged up on a wedness day you know you don't realize how difficult sometimes it can be when you know the minister is here and if the atmosphere is not set amen it's very difficult because ministers are usually very temperamental usually very nervous people as well because they're trying to be in between two Dimensions at the same time amen you know you're looking at a natural person standing here but the minister is in between two dimensions and if you catch the same anointing you can be in between two Dimensions as well that is why the Bible says we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you know sometimes you just got to be sensitive to that other dimension yes you know even like today my wife was unwell and you know as she was talking to me I was taking her to the doctors and she's talking to me and I'm not ignoring I'm listening to what she's saying but at the same time I'm getting inspiration from from that Dimension and you're trying to be in between two Dimensions amen that's what the a minister goes through but when you set the atmosphere then you can receive a blessing out of Hallelujah because the gifts are for you amen the gifts are to benefit you amen amen so I'd like to thank uh brother Ramesh and Pastor for setting uh the platform already so I'm just going to take the Bon and run with it amen amen under the same inspiration under the same anointing amen let's open our Bibles the book of Isaiah 6 reading from verse one amen so the Bible reads in the year that King oziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up amen and his train full the temple amen amen above it stood the serams each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with train he covered his feet and with train he did fly and one Cried Out unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory amen and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was full with smoke yes amen his voice was so powerful amen amen that even the door started to move amen the door posted amen then said I woe is me so Isiah when he's caught up now to the presence of the Living God he says woe is me for am for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts amen the king of glory amen amen then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongue the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this had touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged amen also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us yes then said I here am I am I send me hallelujah amen amen and we can say tonight here am I send me amen you may be seated at this time may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word amen that is why I ask Pastor to sing that song Amen because we can stand like Isaiah and say when the coal of fire had touched us amen he cleansed us hallelujah amen we are now purged amen and now we can say Lord here am I send me amen and the Lord is asking whom shall I send who will go for us yes amen amen so for a title we just want to speak on Whose Glory will you share in amen whose Glory will you share in amen so we see Isaiah here was one of the Major Prophets amen and Isaiah the book of Isaiah is an important book because the prophet tells us that the entire book of Isaiah is a full commentary of the Bible yes yes amen amen and no no one else knows that but we know that because the prophet told us amen amen it's like you know when you go to university and only the lecture can tell you exactly which study guy to get amen amen the study guide that has exactly what's coming out in the exams amen so if if Isaiah the book of Isaiah is the commentary then if we want to see the pattern of the glory of the Lord then we can find it in Isaiah amen amen you see Isaiah despite being a prophet with the word of the Lord because we know the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet The Prophet William Bram tells us that Isaiah had been leaning too much on the great king Isaiah you know but God took Isaiah away from him and when God took Isaiah away Isaiah the prophet was down in his Spirit now you can try and find this I could be wrong but I've tried to find this in the Bible where it talks about Isaiah and Uzziah being so close and and and his desire being so depressed and all of these things but you won't find it Well I I certainly did not find it but the prophet tells us this amen so you know the prophet in this day we are a prophet that will come and shed light and read in between the lines and give us the secret messages in between the lines amen and when the prophet does something like this we need to pay attention amen because it means if God didn't show it to the nominal Christian he's only showing it to us it means there's a reason behind it correct amen amen so the prophet begins with tell us that there was this great relationship between the prophet Isaiah and King Uzziah so much so that the prophet tells us that King oziah was very fond of Isaiah yes so much so that King oziah used to do things for Isaiah the prophet he used to help him out perhaps financially perhaps be an encouragement to him because the prophet tells us that King oiah was a very righteous man and the prophet Isaiah being a young Prophet took life liken to him yes he saw an upright King a righteous man and he began to be influenced by King oziah in a good way not in a negative way but in a good way he has a righteous man he has a good influence but you see they come a time when the prophet Isaiah begin to rely too much on his influence from King oiah and then King oziah did something that was not right because King oziah then started to take the place of a priest yes and he came into the Temple of the Lord and he took the sensor the golden sensor and wanted to offer up sacrifices and do the job of a priest which is contrary to the word because we know this was left to the levitical order amen yes and when King Uzziah did this the priest approached him the high priest approached him and they begin to tell him what you're doing is in correct yes what you are doing is against the word of God Amen and when they did this King oziah began to be become upset with them because he was elevated now as the king yes amen and he thought himself a righteous man which he was but because of being elevated he started to get upset with them and instead of taking correction amen he got very rot with them yes amen and the Bible tells us that when he began to become upset with them leprosy struck him yes and in their presence they begin to see the leprosy forming on his face amen and so the prophet Isaiah began to see this and for the rest of King Isaiah's days he perished away in leprosy and so Isaiah couldn't understand how this righteous King this great king could have such a fall and the prophet tells us that this taken such an effect on him yes amen the prophet says talking about King oziah and then the minister tried to correct him we find out that four score priests besides the high priests come after him and told him sir in other words like this God has blessed you you're an honored man you're a great man and God is blessed you in your work but you shouldn't do that getting off the beatin road Prophet goes on to say now watch my brethren be careful because no matter how much God has filled you with his spirit amen here is where we got to be careful no matter how much God has filled us with his Spirit no matter how much that you've done and how you've been blessed you stay with the calling of God don't get off on some tradition and organizational schemes and so forth you better come back to the path you better come back to what God laid down in the beginning amen and here's where we in the message got to be careful because we've been filled with the spirit we've got the word of the Lord but we got to stay on the right path am yes amen and the prophet goes was on to say now we find out that this man when he was corrected instead of humbl himself and admitting the word that was right and God was right he became angry in other words he was ready to kick him out of his organization he was very upset very perplexed and know he got angry and he to turn around and say now just wait a minute do you realize who I am so the prophet is dramatizing this ver now I wonder sometimes a man you know when the rebuke is coming from the pulpit like it was on Sunday you know I wonder sometimes if we can humble ourselves and say Lord I take correction amen you instead of getting angry within ourselves or getting upset with the minister or getting upset that we are being rebuked but we can humble ourselves and say Lord I take correction notice that God never Strike King oziah with Leprosy when he went against the word and he started to do the duty of the priest he struck him with Leprosy when he got angry at the priest for correcting him because we all subject to mistakes we can do something wrong can have a wrong thought or anything like that and God is ready to forgive us amen but when God is giving you a rebuke and his rebuke is chastisement which is love amen through the fivefold ministry we got to be careful that we don't resent that amen amen we got to be careful that we don't now get into the Realms of the Judgment of the Lord amen because when the Lord is sending a rebuke it's Mercy for us because why he said we have escaped the great day of judgment because we receive judgment here amen amen judgment first at the house of the Lord amen so King Isaiah got struck with Leprosy when he got angry amen so that is why we should not come into that condition help us Lord amen amen so now back to the story King Isaiah was so influenced by this King he got taken up in the glory of this King yes but there had to come a time when the glory of this King started to fade yes andah needed to be caught up into a realm where he could see the glory of the king of kings the one whose Glory Would Not Fade Away amen amen now let's let's see the picture of this king of glory and Isaiah paints this picture in Isaiah chapter 6 now the Bible says in Isaiah chap 6 that when Isaiah was caught into the presence of the Lord he says he strained full the temple and the prophet tells us what that is is the angels of the Lord the train filling the temple the prophet says that that is the angels of the Lord and now in this time where is the Temple of the lord we are the Temple of the Lord and his train fills the temple because the angels of the Lord are gathered with us amen you see the angel of the Lord fills the temple Isaiah is seen this p in heaven you see but he we we are the real living Temple of the Living God amen amen amen so the angels of the Lord are with us amen now this can be two things it can be like when the Bible says our Angels do behold the face of our fathers and the prophet tells us that that is our theop amen amen that is also Angelic beings that are with us amen protecting us as we go along the day Journey being here at the pulit when the minister is ministering amen at your at your bedside amen when you are sick amen the angel of the Lord is being sent when the prayers of the Saints are being made for you amen Rafa is being sent amen why because you are the Temple of the Living God and fills the temple yes hallelujah amen praise the Lord and what did we say the glory of the Lord is it's the Holy Ghost In You amen and what is the Holy Ghost we know that the angel of the Lord is the Holy Ghost see chain fills the temple the Holy Ghost fills you hallelu which is the Temple of the Living God Amen you know I wonder if we can see a type here you know before 2023 and all through the decades you know that we've been in the message there have been great influences in the message you know we had big great names in the message that people look up to Big ministers that people look up to and didn't want to accept any teaching from any other minister but only stuck with a certain teaching of a certain Minister it's kind of like is z so influenced by this King yes yeah influenced by a man and you notice that throughout 2023 the topic that we are speaking about is the supernatural the angel of the Lord moving amen amen and he started to shift our attention away from man amen because you notice the ministry kept on laboring and said that the minister the ministry is not yet to benefit itself it's yet to equip the people so take the focus out of man yes amen so for the all of 23 we had that so much so that that Spirit of having a manly influence was killed in 2023 am so we can enter into 2024 see the glory of the king amen no longer the glory of a certain Minister the glory of a certain influence but now we can be caught up in the glory of Hallelujah and we ourselves can share in His Glory thank you Lord amen hallelujah Lord so that Spirit was slain in 2023 amk King oah had to die than you in order for Isaiah to see the king of glory isah had to die so all the influences had to die hallelujah oh you think the word was coming just for nothing throughout the whole 2023 week in week out slaying each Spirit slaying every influence why because you are a people that ought to be free amen amen let's just pause for a moment praise the Lorden hallelujah hallelujah bless your name oh god oh bless your name Jesus bless be your name oh we don't have to be fixed on any man anymore see it used it used to be we needed some anointed guest speaker to come down and read us like 100 quotes and confuse our minds it used to be that way and we should be so intrigued hey look at how deep this minister is but that is now a Time Gone by because now the individuals sh the glory of the Lord yes Lord the individuals are filled with power amen yes oh God thank you see Moses as well though he was a prophet D did so many Supernatural things but there had to come a time when he said Show Me Your Glory he had experienced all the supernatural Moses had done the supernatural but there had to come a time when Moses said Lord Show Me Your Glory he had to come a time when he needed what he had was not sufficient enough he needed to see the glory of the Lord and you see we we started the end of 2023 talking about sharing in the glory of the Lord on our watch Night Service we spoke on sharing the in the glory of the Lord and we are heading into 2024 where the Lord is bringing us into his glory amen yes now you might say yeah these guys go again with their numbers the whole of 2023 we spoke about the number 23 and not 24 just started and we only speaking about the number 24 amen but let me make it a little bit more crazy for you how many of you know what's the date today the 24th of January 2024 and what is the glory of the Lord we know that in the Bible when Solomon was dedicating the temple the glory the Shak glory of the Lord came down even when Moses was dedicating the Tabernacle the glory of the Lord came down it was the the pull of fire and the pull of cloud and exactly 74 years today on the 24th of January the glory of the Lord firsty for the first time was captured Hallelujah by the camera lens for the first time the glory of the Lord was taken out on a photograph as evidence Undisputed evidence when on the 24th of January 74 years today amen so you see we're not just talking about numbers the Lord works this way yes amen the Lord shows his patterns in the Bible but some may call it fism but for those of you who catch it it's glory amen yes Hallelujah now you see Isaiah he was a prophet we know that he wrote the commentary of the Bible but there had to come a time as well for Isaiah when he needed to see the real presence of the L of the Lord he needed to see the real glory of the Lord yes the prophet says Isaiah saw Visions he was a the prophet Isaiah preached the word he was a minister Isaiah was a holy man but and this is all that we was throughout all the years in the message but one day standing in the temple he fell into a trance and he saw the glory of God Amen he saw the angel with wings over their face oh look at how the reverence comes in the presence of the Lord in the glory of the Lord and if we say that we want to experience the glory of the Lord how do we experience without coming with the same reverence yes with the same approach whether it's in our worship whether it's in our day to-day living whether it's coming into the house of the Lord we have to come with the same reverence these angels crying holy holy you know just a thought we always say that the angels will not know what we singing about when we singing Redemption Song and we we always saying you know we have a greater song than the Angels cuz it's a song of redemption but if you look at the Angels if if if if the way we worship Now is better than this worship then there's something wrong I'm talking about the level of what we are worshiping now you've seen it week in week out how we struggling to break through in worship it cannot be that that worship is greater than the angels of worship there ought to be a level higher than that there ought to be a worship higher than that when the Angels begin to cover their face Angels who knew not sin begin to cover their feet oh how much more we are to come into the presence of the Lord amen we who knew sin we who was dead in trespasses but the Lord had quickened us up amen washed Us in his blood amen he left his glory amen and he come down amen oh he come down to be born in a stable how much more we got to worship him how much more we got to our worship got to be better oh if we can just paint that picture of how we are to worship him I can tell you when John began to see that the lamb was worthy he said everyone heard me amen hey the way he began to shout the way he began to scream he said everyone heard my voice amen so when the word is open to us there ought to be a different kind of worship yes amen amen hallelujah Prophet says a prophet a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of them talking about Isaiah but he says I am a man with unclean lips and I dwell among people that that that has unclean lips wo is me because I see the glory of God Amen the prophet says we find that in the presence of God men recognize themselves to be Sinners when we come into the glory of the Lord yes he says then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is amen and how close we come in the to come in the presence somehow or another it's always throw a great effect upon people to come in the presence of of God the prophet says I've seen the time in my Ministry when you would see the presence of God come into the place and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral acts and bring such a holy hush amongst the people till they drop out of the prayer line before they ever come up to be prayed for run to the Altar and get right with God before they come up into his presence oh Hallelujah if we could come with the same approach amen look at the reverence when when people begin to feel the glory of the Lord they were standing in the prayer line waiting to be prayed for but when the glory of the Lord came down they felt undone so much so they left the prayer line they went to the Altar and began to confess their sins oh sometimes I feel that we forgot how to come to the altar amen amen some of us forgot how to weep in the presence of the Lord amen we forgot why because we need to come into that Glory realm where we can be like a z and say Lord wo is me amen I'm a man of unclean lips amen the prophet said talking about another Minister he preached the gospel in such a way till he stood in Boston in a little bay window because there was no church could hold his crowd and he stood there with such a mighty force and preached hell such a place until working men with their baskets under their arms fell into the street screamed for mercy in the presence of God great preachers who's been able by the word of God to bring the presence of God to an audience oh and we have great preachers amen now that can bring the presence of God down if you could only tap into it be the prophet says far be it that man would ever be so seared in their hearts till they could never recognize the presence of God far be it oh my I wonder I wonder when we hear the preaching weak in and weak out about the glory of the Lord and about his presence and about the angel of the Lord whether our hearts are already so seared that we could never recognize the presence of God amongst us the prophet says far be it from that oh far be it from The Message Church not recognizing the presence of the Lord amen far be that they are so Str strong held in Tradition that they can cannot recognize the glory of the Lord amen oh amen has latest year become so strong and influence Upon Us amen that that a minister can stand here dangling the toys amongst us and we and we stand unfazed we're not interested like the prophet talks about that boy you could Dazzle the toy in front of him and he would not be phased by it oh I hope that we in the message have not come to that amen the prophet says far be from that how can it be that way if we are seated together in Heavenly places amen how can we be lwam yes if we say we are in the glory of the Lord then how can we be in that condition yes Lord the prophet goes on to say in Exodus 3 we find that Moses we saw that Isaiah felt undone right the prophet says Moses the great servant and the prophet of God when he was on the back side of the desert the man was a holy man he had been born for that purpose he was born from his mother's home to be a prophet he had tried to get his education and do everything he could to deliver his people and going down he knowed them from an intellectual standpoint talking about all the promises of God he know the promises of God from an intellectual standpoint he'd been thought all of the promises of God and he was a great military man but one day on the backside of the desert when he come into the presence of God he jued off his shoes and fell to his feet knowing that he was on Holy Ground amen you see what I'm trying to show you the behavior of holy men when they come into the glory of the Lord amen recognize oh he could not stand upon his feet when he come into the presence of God Amen he fell to his face like Abraham did he could not stand in the presence of God oh Hallelujah but when God come down the top of Mount Si and the whole Mountain caught on fire and the smoke was flying from it like a furnace and the voice of God roared out Israel fell on their face and said let Moses speak yes and not God lest we die man in the presence of God realizes he's a sinner yet they were everyone circumcised unto the law they had carried out the Commandments and everything but when God spoke and they moved up in into his presence they realized that they were out they were not right there was something that was lacking yes because they were now now do you see why the whole of 2023 we've been building up consecration getting our lives right there was something that was lacking all these years because we're getting ready to come into the presence of the Lord yes and they said let Moses speak and not God for if God speaks we'll die let Moses speak amen just like Isaiah said woe is me yes you see holy man recognize themselves sinners in the presence of God Amen and the prophet says what if if holy men recognize themselves as sinners in the presence of of God what will the Sinner and ungodly do at that day what will people do who sit in the meeting meetings what will the people do that's seen the power of God that's heard the countdown on the word that's seen God manifest himself and beyond a shadow of Doubt every scripture fulfilled and will still try to make it to heaven without being born again and receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said if a righteous man be scarcely saved where will the an ungodly appear what kind of a place are we going to stand if we see God unfold himself right before us and we are believing that we are coming to a place where God is unfolding his glory right before us amen and we see the glory of God just the same as he as them men did that kind of men Cried Out prophets and sages upon whom the word is based upon if they cried and fell to their feet and screamed I'm a man of Unholy lips uncleanness what will it be then for the man who won't even confess his sins oh what will it be for the teenager our youngsters listen to what the prophet is saying what will it be for the teenager that won't confess his or her sins what will it be for the hard-hearted man that thinks he knows more about God's creation than God does himself what will happen to that man that spent all of his life trying to disprove the Bible what will believe what will happen to unbelieve the sign that spend all the years trying to disprove the message amen where will they stand if the righteous scarely be saved yes you see the people this is why the people were scared to come into the presence of the glory and the glory of the Lord It's revealing this is why we said people are scared to receive the Holy Ghost yes the Holy Ghost is revealing it will take out all the sin from your life amen it will take out all the drust from your life it's revealing you see it was find back then for them to say let Moses speak that will not work today no amen we have to come into His presence ourselves Lord we have to come into the glory of the Lord ourselves there ought not to be any reason why we should not enter into the glory of the Lord and now the prophet will tell us why the prophet says repented sinners now not Sinners but repented Sinners doesn't have any fear oh no a sinner that will repent he knows that there's a bloody sacrifice waiting to stand in his place this is how we enter into the glory of the Lord now that's what gives me the consolation I've seen the glory of God I've felt his power I know the touch of his hand I know the touch the touch of his chastisement I know that is God and I know I'm undone but there is one that's standing there for me amen aren't you thankful for that there's one who stands there says father lay all of his inequity upon me or we can say thank you Jesus because he stood for me down on the earth then I walked to the throne of God Amen like ision I was caught up into the throne room of God boldly having Grace in my heart to know it's not by good works but by his mercy and saved amen yes amen hallelujah yes praise the Lord you know it's like back then only the high priest could enter into the holiest of holies it was death for anyone else to enter yes but today to stay away from the holiest of holies is death see now we have to come into the holiest of holies where the Shak glory is amen cuz that's where the glory of the Lord was it was in the holiest of holiest and I tell you if you come into the shakina glory in the holiest of holies they cannot be any dried up person there aon's Rod started to B to life in the sh glory of the Lord that is why so many people are dried up they need to come into the sh glory of the Lord amen and then you start to Bear the fruits because you start to B in the glory of the Lord hallelujah amen you see how important it is to be in the glory of the Lord amen you see you can't say that you are living in the glory of the Lord and you're not bearing fruit amen because in the glory of the Lord the fruit starts to come hallelujah amen hallelujah you see the Fig Tree could not recognize the glory of the Lord standing before it and because of that it was dried up yes so the glory of the Lord can be right there but if it's unrecognized it will have no effect on you absolutely it has to be recognized you see so it's your part to recognize the glory of the Lord amen hallelujah the prophet is such a person and such a man such a time and how they felt we have also ourselves we've seen the glory of God like these men did sure we've seen it we've seen the glory of God like Abraham saw it we saw the glory of God like Moses saw it same Pillar of Fire the same power of God the same Christ revealing himself showing himself keeping his word in the last day how can we come by then and walk and treat it so lightly oh yes the rebuke come into the church how can we walk and treated so lightly how can we let the spirit of latery and make us so relaxed amen amen when we've seen the glory of God Amen and I'm not only talking about 50 years ago I'm talking about right here in our assembly we've seen the glory of the Lord amen so let us not walk and treat it lightly amen amen back to Isaiah chapter 6 verse 6 then flew one of the seraps unto me having a live call in his hand which he had taken with the the tongs from off the altar verse 7 and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this had touched my lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me now this sounds very similar to Mark 16 and Revelation 108-111 you see Isiah found himself undone and the angel take the co of fire and put it on his lips and purged him yes and after this was was done then the Lord said who will go for us and hisai said here am I send me Amen in Revelation 108-111 when John goes and takes the book and it enters his mouth amen he is now purged amen he's now cleansed and now he's told to go and prophesy again to Nations kindreds and tongues amen Mark 16 says go out preaching the gospel amen amen and he tells us the signs that we ought to do because this shows the glory of the Lord we've been through the past has been to the courts over the last 3 weeks when you go out in Mark 16 and you showing the glory of the Lord amen it's similar to Isaiah who says who will go for us and Isaiah says Lord send me yes amen we've got to come to that place in order for us to be sent out in order for us to fulfill our part of revelation 108-111 we need to experience the glory of the Lord amen because then if we don't we don't have something that we can take to the people yes you see when when when Peter and John was passing by the gate beautiful and they healed this uh man or it was the blind man and then after he healed them everyone started to gather around them and then he started to preach Jesus Christ to them but if he if they never heal him if the glory of of God never portrayed through them and heal him they would have not have a cause to preach Jesus to them yes they would have been no Victory to show to them that Jesus Christ is resurrected but when you have the glory of God within you and you can display the glory of God then you can preach Jesus Christ amen then you can preach the Lord is coming amen then you can have an effective Ministry hallelujah amen and the bride we know has a Ministry [Music] yes the prophet says when you come into His presence you have a great responsibility amen it says look at that lady talking about the woman at the well she couldn't stay no longer she went to the city and told them told the man come see the man that told me the things I've done isn't this the Messiah they could not deny it because it was scriptural certainly yes they've got to do it a man we when we got a responsibility of telling others as Moses did as Peter did as Paul did after these things you've seen it and you've come into the into his pray you're responsible for the message to get to somebody else amen you see it's not just about experiencing the glory of the Lord for yourself but when you come into His into his presence then the responsibility is on you amen you can't just keep quiet at work anymore you can't just keep quiet amen you got to be responsible for telling someone else yes Lord amen but that's only when you come into His presence amen amen oh thank you Isaiah 6:9 and he said go and tell this people he indeed but understand not and see indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their eyes heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and con convert and be healed now can you see the type there again with our ministry Souls Lost in prison yes we are to preach to them but their eyes are shut amen but our job is to preach to them you see Isaiah is just showing us the whole pattern amen because Isaiah is the full commentary yes now we find that in the Bible whenever the temple is built the Shak Glory needs to fill the Tabernacle yes otherwise it's just brick and mortar amen even we I read to you Exodus 40 the other week amen because Moses first saw the pattern and Moses then starts to build the Tabernacle intense according to how he saw the pattern and then the temple that Solomon built was after the pattern of what Moses saw amen so when Moses is building this pattern in Exodus 40 and I told you how we typed the first Sunday of this year in our church when Moses is doing this he starts to get everything in order first he starts to consecrate everyone he starts to anoint everyone he anoints the priest he gets the order in place and when he does this in verse chapter 33 it says and he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle verse 33 of chapter 40 and the Altar and set up the hanging of the Court gate and it says so Moses finished the work so after Moses had finished building this Tabernacle then now9 verse 34 then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud Abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle amen amen amen and it goes on to say when the cloud moved then they moved when the cloud didn't move they didn't move so you see once the temple is built like when Solomon finished building the Temple then the Shak glory of the Lord drops down amen amen and we know that throughout seven Church ages God has been building a temple amen yes amen but the glory of the Lord couldn't fall down all through seven Church ages while God was still building the Tabernacle while God was building the Temple but there has to come a time when the temple is complete being built we can't be building for years and years and years and years there has to come a time the prophet says as she nears him she'll be so much like him amen it will be like a glove the prophet say the capsule will come and just foit on Amen amen amen so we still building the Tabernacle or is the temple built already because the Lord is fixing to come yes amen the the temple has to be built amen just like how the Lord when the Lord is getting ready to return to Jews they want to build their Temple oh yes so if the Lord is fixing to come for us the Tabernacle has to be built already so that the glory of the Lord can fill this place amen hallelujah so you see why last year we had to go through a consecration consecration setting things in order because the temple has to be completed amen and now we can say the temple is ready am because why you and I are the Temple of the Living God Amen we can say I am the Temple of the Living God lord fill me with your glory amen fill me with your Shak Glory because that's the pattern in the Bible if you did it back then in the Bible you have to do it now abolutely amen amen if the glory of the Lord is not filling you up it means your temple is not built yet amen amen hallelujah amen amen you see for seven Church ages God was building up the virtues we've been through all this the last few weeks God was building up all the the things that needed to be done yes you notice when Solomon was building the Temple they begin to bring stones from each different Province they started to get all these different vessels from each different Province why because it's a universal bride amen the Temple of the Lord is coming from each different country being built up being built up yes holy vessels amen the Bible says holy vessels hallelujah amen let's read Amen in in in Solomon for some reason here I didn't mark the chapter but you can maybe search for it it says then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel verse one I'll read it in the meantime then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel andto King Solomon in Jerusalem that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David which is Zion we know that's the word of the Lord and all the men of Israel assembled themselves together unto King Solomon at the feast in the month of eam which is the seven month amen you see the temple is getting ready and finalized in the seven Church age amen and all the Elders of Israel came and the priests took up the ark and they brought up the Ark of the Lord and the Tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels see those holy vessels are a type of these holy vessels yes amen that way in the Tabernacle even those did the priest and the Levites bring up and King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep sheep and oxen they could not be told or numbered and the priest brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into his place into the Oracle of the house to the most holy Place amen the the the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the holiest of holiest amen that is why the the word of the Lord can't only come down into your flesh it can't only drop down into your spirit it has to drop down into the holiest of holies which is your soul because we remember Moses saw the pattern in heaven but if we the temple we also have three parts amen the outer cord the inner court and the holiest of holies which is our soul and the Ark of the Covenant which the word of the Lord has to drop down in our soul amen under the wings of the sherub that's where the angels are amen yeah down in the holiest of holiest for the sheram spread forth their two Wings over the place of the Ark and the sheram cover the ark and the stares they off above amen let's drop down verse 10 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy Place amen when they had finished everything amen that the cloud fill the house of the Lord amen this is the Shak Glory now so that the priest could not stand to minister because the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord this is similar now to what happened when Moses dedicated the the Tabernacle now the glory of the Lord F the place that Moses himself could not even stand so similarly the priests themselves could not even Minister because of the glory of the Lord amen because when the temple as we said is complete the glory of the Lord must fill the Tabernacle and after Moses was finished after Solomon had been done and dedicated him then the glory of the Lord fill the Tabernacle and you see when the glory of the Lord fills the Tabernacle then the days of man is over yes because Moses could not enter in the days of the Prophet were over the ministers could not enter in the days of the ministers were over that is why you've been hearing week in and weak out that the ministry is here to equip you because it's no longer up to the minister yes the responsibility comes upon you because when the glory of the Lord fills the Tabernacle it's no longer the prophet it's no longer the minister it's you alone with the glory of the Lord amen is you alone sharing in the glory of the Lord amen praise the Lord see it was making all this time that you've been hearing all the preaching you've been hearing the word it was making you ready to share in his glory amen yes absolutely you see we had to take our influence and and our influences before we may be influenced by man we may be influenced by great teachers but now we were coming to a stage where we need to be caught up into the glory of the Lord amen yes Lord oh thank you Jesus but now asks you whose Glory will you share you see we can be easily caught up in the glory of a man of a minister we can be easily caught up still in the Glory Days of the Prophet yes you know the prophet had a great ministry a glorious Ministry and we can easily be caught up and be stuck in that but whose Glory will you share in can you come up yourself into the Shak glory of the Lord and sharing his glory amen amen you you see we said Isaiah is the commentary of the Bible right and we read this Isaiah was caught up in the sixth chapter into the glory of the Lord in the sixth chapter Isaiah's influence then was no longer on a man yes but now it got caught up into the glory of the Lord and what is the sixth book of the Bible it's the Book of Joshua you see the days of Moses was over Moses wrote Genesis Exodus and so forth the laws and so forth but the days of Moses was over Joshua and Israel had to take their eyes out of Moses and they had to now enter in themselves amen yes they had to enter now in the sixth book they are to enter themselves into the glory of the Lord they had to experience the glory the supernatural for themselves they had to fight for themselves they had to conquer for themselves they could not rely on Moses anymore to draw Moses give us water Moses give us food that to now come into the glory of the Lord themselves amen wonderful you see isah is just typing everything out amen so don't be caught up on the influence of a man or some great preacher or or don't be caught up just in the days of the Prophet but enter in yourself amen yes you see in when you are caught up in his glory his train fills the temple amen the Holy Ghost fills the temple the angels of the Lord fill the temple Lord but you need to be caught up into that realm yes amen [Music] amen and when the glory of the Lord fills the temple then now it can be used for service you see sanctification sets us apart for service but the Holy Ghost puts us into service what is the Holy Ghost the glory of the Lord residing in you and when the glory of the Lord fills the temple then the temple can be put for service before that you can't be put for service because there's no power in you there's no glory in you you know let's we're looking at this Earthly Temple now of Solomon right and let's see the glory of this Temple and compare it now with the glory of this Temple I'm I'm keeping an eye on my time I won't be too long much longer but let's let's compare the glory of that temple with this Temple yes see Solomon now now after the temple is dedicated and the glory of the Lord fills this this Temple he's now praying and you know it's a familiar prayer where he's talking about and saying if any man looks to this Temple and prays that the Lord must answer so let's go through this and see and when we read this I want you to think of yourself as the Temple of the Living God verse 28 yet have thou respect unto my prayer of thy servant and to his supplication oh Lord oh Lord my God to hearken un to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayed before thee today that thine eyes may be open to Wi this house this Temple right amen and I said put yourself in this place amen that Thine Eyes the Lord's eyes may be open toward this house night and day amen even toward the place of which thou has said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make towards this place and and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and thy People Israel when they shall pray towards this place who is M Jesus on the earth now who is Grace upon the earth now and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive amen who sins you forgive amen If any man trespass against his neighbor an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the O come before th altar in this house then then hear thy in heaven and do any judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness when thy People Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house thou hear thine heaven and forgive the sin of thy People Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gave unto their fathers and when Heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray towards this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou Afflicted them then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people that thou teach them a good way wherein they should walk and give Reign upon thy land which thou has given to the people didn't we read the quote where it says if a brother comes to you and asks for rain yes you can say I give you rain you see the glory of this Temple Hallelujah if they be in the land of famine if there be pestilence blasting M Locust or if there be caterpillar if the enemy besiege them in the land of whatever they of their cities whatsoever plague whatever sickness they be what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy People Israel which shall know every man the the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hand towards this house then thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways amen so you see the power of when the glory fills this Temple amen then now they can look towards this Temple and they can ask God for anything in my nameen and it shall be done when the glory of the Lord fills this Temple you see when the glory of the Lord fills you it says even if it's pestilence even if it's amen didn't we say that we serve a God that can ride off deaths am why because the glory of the Lord is in this Temple amen you see it's a long chapter I want you to go home and read it and compare yourself to this Temple because you are the Temple of the Living God Amen and we know that that Temple was effective because remember Jonah in the whales belly when he turned towards the temple and he prayed God came in to deliver him amen remember Daniel though they passed those laws he opened his windows he looked towards the temple and he prayed amen you see so if that Temple that literal Temple that was filled with the glory of the Lord was so effective amen imagine this Temple when this Temple is filled with the glory of the Lord how effective this Temple can be you see in that Temple they were sacrificing animals but in this Temple amen the lamb was slain before the foundations of the world amen amen there is no sined unto us there's not no more condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus so how much more glorious this Temple is amen but whose Glory will you Shan yes amen will you Shan the glory of the Lord yes amen you see the prophet says the church in this day that glorious church that's to be on the earth when Jesus comes to receive a glorious Church you see he's coming to receive a glorious church not any church but a glorious church we receiving the latter rain a double portion of the Holy Ghost is coming on the earth and he's sweeping Every Nation Revival fires are burning see this is why you can listen to a message like on Sunday to brother Tim frud and see that he's preaching the same things why because Revival fires are breaking out on every Hill in China in Japan from Korea the dark afca Africa and everywhere the holy spirit is being poured out upon the people God Made A Way amen you see you know just in closing I want to show you amen how you know we can think of ourselves little yet you know but I want to show you how God works with little and how he can fill us with his glory the prophet says but when I opened the Bible the first little ribbon in the Bible was a very strange thing where it was when Solomon dedicated the temple of God and the glory of God was so great the shakina glory in the buing till the priest couldn't even Minister and then the next thing the next string was laying the prophet is looking at the strings in his Bible the next string was lay where in Ezra returned and dedicated the temple yes and in the now Pastor Adan read this a while back amen tying it up with Mark 11:23 and the third little marker that my wife had gotten me and put in the Bible not knowing with my name on it and so forth was laying to mark 11:22 but it's actually referring to Mark 11:23 yes she was she stuck in the Bible that's way was if you say to this mountain be moved and all of you know that scripture was right in my mind so you see the prophet is typing these three things the Shak glory of the Lord Mark 11:23 he's tying all these things in together yes and we at 2023 where we went over Mark 11:23 now we coming to 2024 the glory of the Lord the prophet is now bringing it together for us and and notice then he goes on to say in the same quote and then my first meeting after this right message I to preacher is at Phoenix amen Arizona yes and the prophet says Phoenix is something that can raise up out of nothing amen amen now I'm not making a Doctrine out of this but I'm I'm I'm putting it there to encourage you yes right that's what God does he takes nothing raises up something out of it amen the prophet goes on to say thank you brother he says surely be a real real privilege to have brother brandham come often so often to Phoenix he says I think he comes to phix more than anywhere I'm showing you this for a reason just to encourage you amen the angel of the Lord visits us yes amen see the angel of the Lord likes to visit Phoenix in 1963 he appeared in Phoenix Arizona in 2023 showed himself here in Phoenix amen amen not because of the place now because of the elect the other day on the mountain I was standing there I said Lord I got one Open Door in the whole nation as far as I know that's Phoenix yes Lord you've only got you're the only one I got the prophet says I I hope this is not the case now and I hope that the the eyes of the people in the M begin to open yes amen so the angel of the Lord can move he goes on to say that's been about 12 14 years ago now in the city called Phoenix is something that built up from ruins I said well that's the same thing happened to you this morning God built you up I believe this morning from a ruined heal to good health you see a lot of the a lot of the uh message community were heavily influenced by wrong doctrines by all different kinds of doctrines the seven Thunders the Seven Virtues and all of these things they were ruined in that doctrines all these years but the prophet says God took us from ruined Health to Good Health am you see he is able to show us the truth amongst all of it yes now the prophet says Isaiah one time a young Prophet here last time at Phoenix amen we speaking about it in Phoenix tonight I spoke to him to the businessman I believe it was he had been leaning heavy upon King the king's shoulder oah and we find out that oah got all puffed up amen talking about what we've been speaking about today another one your life will shine a lot louder I'm closing I'm just I'm just trying to encourage you a little bit your life will shine a lot louder than your testimony could ever give your life so loud till the people don't even understand your testimony that's where sincerity and sacredness five good people really filled with the spirit will do more in Phoenix than all the members we've got if they're consecrated to God in a sincere life cuz God will move his word through there and vindicate that to be the truth amen so you see God only needs surrendered lives consecrated lives that are willing to share in his glory am amen that are tired of being influenced just by man but want to be influenced by the king of glory and enter into Shak glory amen amen then we can be fit now for service we can fulfill our part of Revelations 108-111 because we've been filled with the glory of the Lord amen you see we see the types in the Bible but if that Temple was so great if that Temple was So Glorious how much more this Temple amen but whose Glory will you share tonight amen I pray blessed amen let's stand stand Hallelujah let's him let's Praise Him whose Glory will you share in will you share in the glory of the king of Glory Hallelujah any other person's Glory May fade away but the king of glory and what is it it's Christ in you the hope of glory and we know that the second full purpose amen is for Christ to be in you have the preeminence in you the hope of glory that's that the prophet used to preach Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says I take you now in the back part of God's mind this is God's purpose his glory needs to be unveiled through you there's no other purpose you see Jesus fulfilled his purpose because the fullness of the God had dwelled bodily in Jesus Christ but now in order for us to go into the third phase the third purpose the second purpose needs to be fulfilled Christ to have the preeminence is in the church amen the glory of of the Lord to fill this Temple amen but you will have to let him amen hallelujah hallelujah we thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you Jesus fill us with your glory Lord we want to shame Your Glory oh God lord we don't want to be influenced by man we don't want to be influenced by the things of the world things that will fade oh God but we want to be influenced by the king of glory we want to be influenced oh God by an eternal King oh Lord Jesus Lord where your train fills the temple the Holy Ghost fills the temple the angels of the Lord are filling the temple oh Lord may
