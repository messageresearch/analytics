that we've grown attached to land we know for many years she's been with the church for 40 years I've been a loyal member of faithful member and not one that was demanding or quite much attention Amen but she was faithful in the Lord Romans would attend the services she would drop faith and I remember many times she would come and even pass more DVDs of preaching services she would request songs CDs and keep asking me if I could please little son maybe time he would give up I'm to be blessed by it and but she would keep requesting more which means she desire to be in the presence of the Lord she desired to be surrounded with things that were praising the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so we are honored to stand here today and be a witness of respect for time-tested memorial of her dear mother she has lived a life she has finished the race amen and I believe the Lord has given a final healing healing in the natural he's only a type of what is going to happen to us one of the days the final healing will be the changing of these bodies very many so we were praying when our dear mom was in hospital you were praying for the healing of her but the Lord is only allotted for us to live for 70 years upon the earth and if by grace he gives us another 10 years so we were praying to the Lord and saying Lord heal our gear mother touch her and in his great tender mercy he said I want her one more time but this time I'll go HeLa forever she steps into a new body area and that's where she is rejoicing right now and we could just look beyond the curtain of time to where she is in a new body it's a whole nother scene here we are said here we are morning but on the other side she's rejoicing at the same a man so we've got a limit to time because of all the respects so both of you that have to leave the family has requested the a prepared meal already pre-packed little boxes which tent is it yeah just behind this in front of this tent so when you're leaving you get you can take your meal with you and when you're coming here in the front we ask you to refrain from making contact with the family just to abide by the regulations and nobody not use this kind of funerals we all want to embrace one another not one another but if the authorities come here we don't also want to be shut down so we also want to abide by their okay so we will give you time to view the face again just now but we because of our limited time we'd like to go straight into our program we'd like to invite well Ronnie was gonna share the word of the Lord amen plus money has been the pastor of sister cinta for the last 40 years so I'm sure it is him join his heart in many said to see a member cultures gone but he can do joyously Amen you can do it knowing that she has lived a life faithfully before a big hole in the precious name of Allah instead of Jesus Christ in even else as it was said was till powers a faithful believer in the entire message and thank God for the revelation that she had he can be faithful and she lived with this house alone but almost a little bit alone yes she was not alone amen because she had the word of the Lord and that was I believe that kept her going and she really loved the message and she also you know in the last part of her life even reading the message the books let's speak to the tapes so we know she loved that world when there the time at the tape recorder got voltage stopped working she told us you know what my my CD player is not working and that she wanted us to get one for us so it just got a few which kept on reminding us I need my tape recorder so finally got one tape recorder for her so she can listen to the message so what confidence in our hearts we can stand in and have this field or service by many people services people would like to say something about a person and maybe exaggerate also but our system we don't have to exaggerate any it's a life that she left who speak for yourself and to the family and everybody that knows so we know what fate was in the Lord Jesus Christ and she believes with all our heart right to be in so give it glory price so then I read from the word of the Lord and that we pray that the word Allah to bless us this excuse me with my vocals I've got some irritation my throat but I praise it to know to make them wait for us read from the book of st. Bob chapter 10 verse 17 2010 I'll pray the Lord will bless us and I want to say things he had this morning that the Lord must be pleased what we are saying and also we we don't want to be guilty of saying something that we are not going to say because the Bible says here we'll have to give an account for what we say and also what we don't say that we should say so we're going to speak directly from the word it's not my word it's what's recorded in the Word of God so we must listen to what His Word says and be attentive to what His Word says so we don't want to be guilty before him for not saying the things that he want us to say so read from the book of said mark chapter 10 from verse 17 to 23 and when he was God flawed into the way they came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus 17 why call us now be good there is none good but one that is God that knows the connivance do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother and he hums it and said unto Him master all these things I have observed for my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said I hear one thing thou makest go that way sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at the same and whether it be for yet great have Richard enter into the kingdom of God praise the Lord let's just power it forward prayer even what Jesus me thank you lots your word and we know your hell your word will ever remain everything never pass away but your words will not pass away you pray that you bless us Lord in may our faith be anchored upon thy word and Lord we know the subject that we're speaking Lord is about life and eternal life we know yeah we have a temporal life but there is eternal life we pray that you bless our hearts that we may find it out for we ask it in Jesus precious name Amen amen if we're gonna tackle this little message I'd like to give it a title a fake world or a false world shake wool or a false world amen I believe that's a time we are living in everything is fake everything is false they don't nothing is like in its original condition now we know that if people are elderly yeah you know that twenty years back thirty years back fifty years back the world was not in this condition people never look the way they look the way they are living down things that are done was not done those years back so the world is become a fake no reality mm and we know the Bible tells us that yeah we have no cookie living City but we seek one is bull then make a is gone so we have through a short space of time certainly is even if you look one hundred years it's a short space of time and in the hundred years all of us here would be dead if the Lord tarries see if the rock don't come to take us away in the rapture all of us will be dead yet in a hundred years time uh-huh but if we have eternal life if we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ amen we look for ever event going on into eternity now we find this rich and ruler he was a wealthy man and if you look at the legend see the bottle says he came running you know the Lord Jesus was a busy man preaching every day he was on the street and the disciples were rounding men and people who are congregating around him and he must have heard them and he must have thought about his life now although he had possessions that very rich one thing that he thought about his eternal life and the Bible says he came running to the Lord and he went on his knees and he said good master what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life but he wanted he can light that Jesus ever people keep all the commandments he said I kept them out from a youth up growing up a kept all the world and many was there you know good living citizen then Jesus saw that the elect one thing that it was really really rich and Jesus said okay God sell all that you have and give to the poor and come and follow me that was not prepared to do yet he wanted to go out to every ten life and Jesus said well the sell of this thing that and give that give it away come and follow me take up your cross he didn't want did not wanna part with his goods he did not want to change his living styles and what a great opportunity he missed to follow the Lord Jesus Christ and he would have an eternal life we will see like that what what happened with amen so he find this world yeah he's only a fake whoa people are deceived Kenya or whatever is gonna be important to them in this life they can make all beans to achieve those things that is all well and good we gotta have a job we gotta handle living we gotta feed yourself and feed your families but there are people that you know chase out the things in this world not knowing God the carrier is more important the world is more important and you find even parents today they want to do everything for the children they want to give them the best education that wonderful maybe be a doctor or a lawyer and have a good job that's fine but they've got no eternal life they're gonna go to the regions of the lost all these things are not going to come and standing the day no credentials now jesus said go into the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned so the gospel must be preached and people must yeah amen now there are many rich people in the Bible it's nothing nothing wrong with being rich God made people rich if we go to the Bible Abraham was a very rich man but he he served God he was obedient to God and then his riches never made him stop believing in God King David was a rich man being a king praise the Lord you can read The Book of Psalms you always praise God yet great wisdom and knowledge that he was able to leave Israel Moses the Bible tells us Moses also was to be the next Pharaoh in Egypt and the Bible says he forsook all those things he refused to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and then never won a great things that he refused to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and that's how it goes with a lot of people today they are caught up in this thing the appeal is well and the think you know what this is a life this is the life that I'm gonna look but they have you seen amen that's not the life when when Jesus was speaking to the disciples and he told them you know what there's gonna come a time that you're going to be put into prison you're gonna be put to death you're going to be separated from your families now they never see ended ran away no there's still something that all of them were killed they were martyred amen so if this was if saving Jesus and and preaching the gospel was the fake why did they whole time Stephen no stone preaching the gospel the people's heart was so hard they couldn't receive the Word of God so I was longing to get when I found says he looked up to heaven and he said Lord Jesus receive my spirit hey man you know there's another land out there there's another place amen and our sister he's gone to the better place you know what kids went to the almost Martin Bernie and he always visited them a circle family you know he went they said spoke the Word of God and and that's some refreshments but he says you know what Mary chose the better part Martha got a happy end she went to go prepare some videos and she was not happy that Mary never come to her hot bath but Jesus said she chose the better part she said there and listen to what Jesus had to say I was thinking of God and Jesus said she chose the better parts so I was sister as chose the better parts she listened to the Word of God she received the Word of God and we got four four preachers the past had three other preachers we are always preaching about the rapture we always preaching about the body change and I was sister was listening and hearing now see chosen better parts nothing waving at faith even when she was not well many many times she always tested God she came for player she requested prayer amen she chose a better part she never played God a lot of people want to blame God you know what what what is this happening to me in and why must you suffer and all this thing they oughta blame God but she trusted and believed in God and we are going to go through these testings and trials in this life well it shows what we are made of what we are trusting who we going to believe him so she listened to the Word of God that promised us eternal life eternal life was promised and she held on to the world and bigger testimony she never wavered they met you believe the Word of God see so I'm saying like we're living in that in a fake world in a false wall you know so I said we know that fifteen twenty fifteen years back the world wasn't in this commission people wasn't in this commission children wasn't in this condition teachers were certain the condition parents wasn't in this condition the parents don't know what to do with the children children don't know what to do with the parents the teachers don't know what to do members they don't know what to do they're not to control them the Bible says people are heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God anything yet something about the gospel of salvation oh they want to live the whole life see any under lovers of pleasure more than look for God when they get sick and lie on the deathbed then the ones in the way is gone I love people in the last stages of the life never want to look for God itself God but when they realize that doctor said sorry there's nothing we can do for you now medical science and doctors and anything can do the best for people but many cases they cannot said sorry there's nothing we can do for you please we're gonna send you home to die many many cases and I'm telling you now this is a true testament people want to find God when they realize that they've come to the end of the life and they're going to die because of the sickness and the disease they want to know what what is going to become off my life so I'll tell you actual facts and actual truths I had a brother an older brother and the younger brother one above me and one up for me Claudia I told him about seven gold and things like that then but they want to live their own life and they they got drunk and they look the life and when he spoke about what God said no God knows me and I know I know God and they never come to serve Him but when the doctor said to my eldest brother he was in Alberta truly when they opened him up and they said sorry there is nothing we can do for you the cancer is gone cause take that is nothing we can do we're gonna send you back to the one stitch above see then you start peeking where your life is going and then he called for prayer he wanted prayer and then he told his family you know us great is not none of them and it was a it was a okay somebody was Hindus they studied this today the wives and children that are living but he said his family when I time he wanted me to do the funeral in a Christian way and that is Armas factors witnesses yeah he told his family what he realized now there is some truth in Christianity he realized he needed God so I don't know how much he's going to find favor with God but we had to do what he requested in the midst of all a family very news we had a Christian funeral that was in the last stages of his life and then the brother after me same story he lived his life lived in this world two things in this world and everything but when we started getting sick and can't say the banner and cancer they hip and moving can say realized you know what Wow call from my brothers we went facility hospital with the scrim brother Joshua is witness he wants to give his heart to the Lord you want to serve God we sent a chat with him the Word of God and took him through there as salvation and baptism and everything else and he's all now see he said the sinner's prayer he said when it come to the last stage then people wanted to perform I wonder if they can find in any way these people want to live their own life like sometime yes you know I'll change later you guys I'm young I've got my yes to look like you know what all of a sudden it dying accident they might die in the club some people get into a coma and land up in hospital and no matter how much your friends you say they can't yet they never had the opportunity to listen at the scene the Word of God in Jesus Christ so that would go on and on I'm living in a time with all the things that's happening in the world for many years now and people want to know what is God why is blood not coming why is he not helping us if he is going why must we suffer how would I say today God has been around amen Lord has been around they wanted God to come down rescue them but when God works he don't work like men God works in a supernatural way amen God was yet people were many ways God blows yeah the Bible tells us in the book of Revelation Ted another mighty angel cake down cloud with the cloud what was it God was yeah blood was opening his word to the people God had people that will receive it and then some some mysteries that were hidden the Bible another mighty angel came down and opened the seals so God was yeah the supernatural was being that scientific evidence that the world was baffled by and the one question what is this and who is that but God was here and people want to know where he's gone God is mindful of the people he says in the book of Malachi chapter 4 we all don't send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day before i smite the earth with the cast and before my righteous walk on the actions of the wicked I will send me light of the Prophet he will bring the true word to you you're gonna listen to him perhaps jesus said to the young man tell me across it follow me there are people to me help the Word of God and they have taken the cross and following Jesus why the one running away see borders come and worked in the supernatural he was yeah the Bible says in Luke 17 chapter 17 the Son of Man is going to reveal himself as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in the case of Lord the Son of Man which is Jesus Christ would come and reveal himself and he's already done that in the Ministry of this day an organization she never belonged to a denomination she believed the Word of God people must have heard about they're going to some church and what state church is listen and the Saints are prophet and all these things in you know that is a truth and they're stopping go check it out it's all recorded in the Word of God so God has not left us without attending to us and the Bible says he will present himself a glorious church without spot without Rico without British there are people on the face of the earth today as you received a supernatural they have seen the supernatural working of God God says my ways is not your ways and your ways are not my ways he's not going to come down in the way the people want him to come he came in the way he wanted to come and now he's gonna show himself and it's up to the people to believe me to receive it or reject it thanks a lot and the Bible tells us I'm not gonna read the scripture they take longer to people know their story the one says this rich young ruler time and the Bible says he opened his eyes in hell amen he opened his eyes in hell and when he was there he looked at the water and kept the content and out and he saw a friend and he saw laziness hey man and the Bible says that he was fermented he was in the flames of fire and he said to let us please bring me some water they said sorry we can't even bring you water he's a gulf here there's a you know we can't help you hey man let us listen attentively before we close sorry yes sir ever the Word of God is more important so so this man now they couldn't help him and he was in torments and the Bible tells us now here concern he had five brothers and he said to the police sent somebody to one my brother's not to come to this place this already when he got concerned when he realized what he rejected and now he was the determinants of fire he said send somebody to warn my brother's got to come to this place the angel said you know what even if somebody went from the dead they won't believe they got the Word of God the prophet Moses wrote and got the preachers they must gather a man and I believe that's what we must listen to the Word of God and the people that God said to preach the Word of God God is not change God's desire was for men to preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saying he that believeth not shall be damned hey back what women want to live their own life they think this is life I'll close up real gap from the book of Romans I'm afraid that you listen attentively because this is the exact condition into the Word of God they don't want to listen to the preachers and the one I had their own way now this is here in the Bible of book of Romans so I'll read this yeah and then I think the rock parish of the program so it says in the book of Romans chapter 1 from verse 16 the Apostle Paul went to Rome find you the gospel and this is what he said I am not ashamed of the gospel because it's the power of God that brings salvation to everyone that believes first to the Jews then to the Gentiles a righteousness that is by faith from first to last just as it is written the righteous will live by faith he says yet the rock of God is being revealed from heaven against all godliness wickedness that's what may be known about God is plain to them because God had made plain to them for since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature has been clearly seen being understood from what was being made so that people are without excuse so what God is saying God has always been revealing himself it's gonna be revealing himself for other than you God they neither glorified him as God don't get paint him but the thinking became futile and the few foolish hearts were darkened although they claim to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the important God for images that look like important human beings and birds and animals and reptiles therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of the heart to sexual impurity and for the degrading of the bodies one with another they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator who is forever praised because of this God gave them over to shameful lusts even the woman exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations shifted woman and when you train with last one for another been committed shameful acts with other men and the seeing in themselves the due penalty for their error third of all just as they did not think in what was to retain God in the knowledge so God gave them over to a depraved mind amen so that he came up to a depraved mind they have become full with every kind of wickedness evil greed depravity they are full of envy murder strife deceit and malice they are gossips slanderers God Aten insolent arrogant boastful they invent ways of doing evil they disobey the parents they have no understanding no stability no love no mercy are they other than know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death they not only continue to do these things very things which also approve of those who practice them so the Word of God goes on and on and on people have made a choice for the life that they want to live on this earth and blah blah he has made away for us the Bible tells us in the book of Isaiah come let us reason together amen tolya sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow so there is hope there is cleansing power in the blood of Jesus Christ so if you want to have eternal life we must listen to what the Bible says Jesus I am the bread of life that came down from heaven which any man believe in me shall not die I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me but there's not many other ways to God only through Jesus Christ and in the day what are we gonna leave this earth we will come to know the truth then maybe you will not know it now and that rich young ruler found out that he refused to follow Jesus Christ he refused eternal life and he ended up in hell so bring that God bless you thank you for turning we'd like to continue we have to get you just believe the messages that the siblings wanted to pass on shall start with Rajat mum you were the truest dearest more than the whole world to me you should have known for your precious gift from God so much beauty love and patience you possessed you touched my heart in so many ways the strength to smile even on dark days made me realize I have an angel besides now you've heard God's whisper courting the home you didn't water you didn't want to leave us I see your fights you loved us so much that you held on tight until all your strength was gone and you could no longer home finally you gave your hand to God and slipped away quietly without telling us by I will forever salute you because you've been all I've ever needed God gave me the best mom in the world you taught me never to

was clouded by the overwhelming love that never failed to shine you did the best you could do and that best is a benchmark we all aspire to be to be able to provide food and shelter for almost every one of your family at some point in their lives but above all your unwavering love yes there were arguments misunderstandings harsh words but maybe a family that don't have that but forgiveness was
