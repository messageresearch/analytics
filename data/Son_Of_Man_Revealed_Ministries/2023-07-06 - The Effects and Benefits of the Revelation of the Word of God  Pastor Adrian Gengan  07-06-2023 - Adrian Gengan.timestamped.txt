[1:41] we're just exhort for a few moments amen
[1:44] and then we can get together and pray
[1:46] amen the prophet always spoke about a
[1:48] Wednesday night prayer meeting
[1:49] amen hallelujah so we look forward to
[1:53] that time where we can come
[1:55] and they call it a corporate prayer amen
[1:58] amen the body of Christ praying together
[2:00] amen 1 John 5 4 says for whosoever is
[2:05] born of God overcometh the world
[2:09] and this is the victory that overcometh
[2:11] the world even our faith amen amen so we
[2:15] know that faith is our victory
[2:17] amen we can't be short of faith that's
[2:21] one thing we will make sure that we are
[2:23] growing in our faith amen amen
[2:25] who is he that overcometh the world but
[2:28] he that believeth that Jesus is the son
[2:30] of God Amen may the Lord blessings to
[2:33] the reading of his word you can be
[2:34] seated
[2:35] amen
[2:39] Hallelujah you can also turn to
[2:42] Revelation chapter 2.
[2:45] amen Revelation chapter 2 verse
[2:48] sorry Revelation 3 and verse 20.
[2:50] amen
[2:52] Hallelujah some scriptures with Caleb
[2:54] you'll just get on your Bible Software
[2:55] amen Revelation 3 and 20 just want to
[2:58] get some
[3:00] context to this end time
[3:02] amen
[3:04] Revelation 3 and 20 says behold I stand
[3:07] at the door and knock If any man hear my
[3:10] voice
[3:11] and open the door I will come into him
[3:15] and will suck with him and he with me
[3:19] so somebody tell me who's standing at
[3:22] the door just for the children now they
[3:24] don't know who's standing at the door
[3:28] amen can everybody say we've got a lot
[3:30] of children here now we need to teach
[3:31] them who's standing at the door
[3:34] Jesus is standing at the door and he's
[3:36] knocking
[3:37] and Jesus is saying if any man hear my
[3:39] voice and open the door I will come in
[3:43] to him
[3:45] and will sup with him and he would me
[3:49] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[3:52] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[3:54] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[3:57] in his throne
[3:59] amen so we find the one that is going to
[4:02] open the door he's the one that is
[4:04] familiar with the voice because nobody
[4:07] opens the voice to his opens the door to
[4:10] a stranger
[4:11] amen we teach our children do not open
[4:14] the door to a stranger's voice
[4:17] that is why the leadership Church can't
[4:20] open the door to Jesus amen
[4:22] they don't know his voice amen didn't
[4:24] Jesus say my sheep know my voice and the
[4:27] strangers they will not follow
[4:30] amen so that's why they can't open the
[4:32] door to him is because they don't know
[4:34] his voice yes amen doesn't he say in the
[4:37] days of the voice amen so they have not
[4:40] recognized the voice so they can't open
[4:42] up the door to him so even when they
[4:44] heard the voice of the seventh angel
[4:45] they shut the door yes amen amen and he
[4:49] says to him that overcometh will I grant
[4:52] you sit with me in my throne even as I
[4:55] also overcame
[4:56] and I'm sat down with my father in his
[4:59] throne now all of us have to overcome
[5:01] things in this life
[5:03] amen we are all going to a testing time
[5:07] we live in in this latest here age of
[5:11] gross Darkness amen we are all coming
[5:14] now to the time where we can say like no
[5:18] flesh will be saved it's preaching to
[5:21] the Lost
[5:22] amen so there's gross Darkness all
[5:24] around us and
[5:26] some of the things we have to overcome
[5:29] amen we know it's the lust of the eyes
[5:32] lust of the eyes amen lusting amen for
[5:35] things that we see lust of the flesh
[5:38] and the pride of life if we can
[5:40] summarize it in those three things but
[5:42] you can detail each aspect and see how
[5:45] the people are lusting after material
[5:47] things
[5:48] amen not only they are lasting up to
[5:51] material things even in the spiritual
[5:53] kingdom of God they're lusting after
[5:54] gifts amen amen the lasting after
[5:58] gifting and they love sing after the
[6:00] power of God yet they don't want to obey
[6:02] the word of God Amen so we all go to
[6:05] overcome something in this life some
[6:07] trial that God has given us amen some
[6:10] testing amen because these trials come
[6:13] to perfect our faith amen amen they come
[6:16] to give us patience they come to build
[6:18] our character
[6:19] amen hallelujah
[6:22] so we find here that every one of us is
[6:24] overcoming something
[6:27] amen every one of us will have to face
[6:29] the tears amen God's not going to push
[6:32] us through a pipe and bring us the other
[6:35] side and say Well done my son you made
[6:38] it through
[6:39] amen hallelujah brother Caleb we can go
[6:42] to a slide now the prophet he gives us
[6:44] great insight into his own
[6:47] into his own life
[6:49] amen
[6:53] and he exposes some of his flaws and
[6:56] some of his mistakes so that we can
[6:58] learn let's go to slide number 14 there
[7:01] we find in in the message standing in
[7:03] the gap
[7:04] [Music]
[7:06] the prophet wants you to go off the
[7:07] field and he wants you to become
[7:10] just the profit in the wilderness
[7:12] and come out whenever he's thus said the
[7:14] Lord and preach you know what he says
[7:16] now
[7:21] uh I'll be there okay
[7:25] thank you
[7:32] sorry maybe 15 it's like 15. he says why
[7:36] do you wait for me to move you every
[7:39] time you move
[7:41] right the Lord is now speaking to the
[7:44] prophet and he's telling why do you wait
[7:46] for me to move every time you move where
[7:49] is your reward then I sin and then he
[7:52] said do you remember what brother
[7:53] Robertson told you in his dream of
[7:55] vision that you had done like Moses you
[7:57] forgot the feeling of your people you
[8:00] forgot the call that I called you to
[8:04] amen he says I let the sick lay
[8:09] but he had that saved the Lord
[8:12] I want the Lord to tell me where to go
[8:15] and not to that's wrong
[8:18] now we are the bride who has that saith
[8:21] the Lord amen
[8:23] amen we've got to believe that we have
[8:26] that's it the Lord in the sower
[8:28] we are the entire people we are
[8:30] finishing the race we have been
[8:31] commissioned to go
[8:33] we have that's it the Lord so we can't
[8:36] be lying around waiting
[8:39] we've got to go amen hallelujah we can't
[8:43] let the sick lay
[8:45] amen we've got to show the power of God
[8:47] amen hallelujah amen oh blessed be his
[8:51] name there's one more quote I want to
[8:52] read the brother Caleb amen
[8:54] amen maybe we can get it from yeah
[8:57] praise the Lord amen
[8:59] let me just find the slide
[9:03] amen hallelujah
[9:06] amen you love the Lord amen amen
[9:09] maybe we can if you go to standing in
[9:11] the Gap I'll give you the paragraph for
[9:12] the thing it was a beautiful quote I
[9:14] wanted to read to you amen maybe I don't
[9:17] put it onto the slide
[9:18] Hallelujah
[9:20] amen standing in the gap
[9:22] if you get it tell me then I'll give you
[9:24] the amen which one to call up
[9:29] you got it
[9:30] amen
[9:36] he says if God pushes a man through a
[9:38] pipe amen
[9:46] he says if God pushes a man through a
[9:49] pipe and he don't move at all until God
[9:51] tells him there is no faith connected
[9:53] with it
[9:55] amen
[9:56] there's no faith connected with it if
[9:59] God is just going to bring you through
[10:00] all your trials will not put you through
[10:02] trials amen he says there's no faith
[10:05] connected to it that's right amen so
[10:08] there's no Victory there's no overcoming
[10:10] power it's god pushing you to something
[10:13] and it's built the ministry to a place
[10:15] where there is nobody can say one word
[10:17] against it but from ends what let me
[10:19] first speak to you in the name of the
[10:20] Lord before you listen because I must go
[10:23] out by faith I must do it by faith
[10:26] whether I think it's right or wrong or
[10:28] what
[10:30] some are waiting for the portals of
[10:32] Heaven to open and say my son go forth
[10:35] and do this
[10:36] you have been commissioned in this hour
[10:38] amen yes yes amen because I must go out
[10:42] by faith I must do it by faith whether I
[10:44] think it's right or wrong I do the best
[10:46] of my choosing and then go do it yes
[10:49] yes who's choosing
[10:51] I do the best of my choosing and then go
[10:54] do it because it hasn't been because it
[10:57] hasn't been wrong is because I've waited
[10:59] to till he told me to go I've waited for
[11:02] him so it wasn't me it was him amen so
[11:04] then he goes into that other quote where
[11:06] we read that
[11:07] amen so if you go to 121 there you'll
[11:10] see there what he is telling him and
[11:12] this is what we are called to now
[11:13] because remember we are connected with
[11:15] the prophet's Ministry yeah amen anyone
[11:18] who received the prophet's message must
[11:20] bear the fruits of his message yes amen
[11:22] amen hallelujah he said but so remember
[11:26] he wants you to be like the Old
[11:28] Testament prophet he says but that was
[11:29] the Old Testament Prophet you've been
[11:31] called to a much higher office than that
[11:37] amen amen stop trying to be like Ruth
[11:39] stop trying to be like Esther stop
[11:41] trying to be like Mary if you go to a
[11:43] much higher office
[11:47] each one just playing a part of you and
[11:51] entirety they reveal the mystery of you
[11:54] but you are the entirety of the mystery
[11:56] amen amen you've been called to a higher
[11:59] Ministry a higher office you have more
[12:02] gifts beside that
[12:05] yes come on now you have more gifts
[12:07] beside that
[12:08] amen you were called to pray for the
[12:11] sick and preach the gospel and you're in
[12:13] the apostolic form you know of greater
[12:16] things many great gifts

[12:21] time you move where is your reward

[12:44] forth and you apply the word by faith
[12:46] amen these signs shall follow them that
[12:49] believe

[15:23] but if you saw them sign it's Luke 17
[15:25] shrine

[16:02] the Christ
[16:05] not is a Christ now but is the Christ
[16:08] he doesn't say that the overcome is one
[16:10] that believes in a Jesus and in a Christ
[16:13] but he believed that Jesus is the Christ
[16:16] one person not two he
[16:19] he is the one who is baptized in the
[16:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ have you
[16:24] been baptized that way amen amen then we

[16:43] churches none of them believe the best
[16:45] the God is the way we believe it yes
[16:47] because the mystery of God has been
[16:49] revealed amen and they refuse to be
[16:51] baptized in his name
[16:54] Amen to be baptized in his name is to
[16:57] die to serve that's what baptism does
[16:59] you're dying to yourself that's what a
[17:01] woman does she dies to herself and takes
[17:04] on the name of her husband when we go
[17:06] down to the watery grave amen we are
[17:08] baptized in his name and we are
[17:10] resurrected with his name
[17:12] amen glory be to his name amen
[17:16] we find you in the scriptures Amen
[17:18] brother Caleb if you can go through it
[17:20] quickly amen that there was going to be
[17:22] a word released to the people amen now
[17:26] John the Baptist said behold the Kingdom
[17:28] of Heaven is at hand
[17:30] kingdom of God is coming prepare either
[17:33] way what was his kingdom Jesus was
[17:35] talking about
[17:37] Amen in Luke 9 and 1 you'll find here
[17:41] Jesus Calls the 12 disciples together
[17:43] now Jesus had 12 disciples 12 men that
[17:47] he called commissioned to go and spread
[17:49] the good news of the Kingdom he called
[17:51] the 12 disciples together and gave them
[17:54] power and authority over all devils and
[17:57] to cure diseases
[17:58] amen amen amen amen and send them to
[18:02] preach the kingdom of God and to heal
[18:04] the sick
[18:06] yes amen you can't preach the kingdom of
[18:07] God without these
[18:10] without power
[18:12] you can't preach the kingdom of God
[18:14] without having authority of all devils
[18:16] they're gonna make you run amen amen you
[18:19] can't preach the gospel without being
[18:21] able to cure all diseases Luke 9-1 amen
[18:24] hallelujah
[18:27] to be able to hello is it the same
[18:29] yesterday today and forever come on now
[18:31] this is the evidence of the Gospel in
[18:34] power and demonstration cure all
[18:36] diseases and in line two he sent them to
[18:39] preach the kingdom of God and to heal
[18:41] the sick amen amen amen Luke 10 and 9.
[18:46] it reiterates and to heal the sick that
[18:49] they are that are there in and to say
[18:52] unto them the kingdom of God has come
[18:54] nigh unto you
[18:58] amen don't just take them the word only
[19:00] show them the power of the Gospel
[19:05] amen
[19:07] and Luke 10 11 now he commissions them
[19:09] further even the very dust of your city
[19:12] amen this is now the people who reject
[19:14] him which cleaved on us we do wipe off
[19:17] against you notwithstanding be sure of
[19:20] this that the kingdom of God has come
[19:22] nigh out to you
[19:24] but I say unto you that it shall be more
[19:27] tolerable in that day for Sodom than for
[19:29] that City talking about Sodom amen let's
[19:32] go to Luke 17 and 20 then
[19:37] amen
[19:38] now the Pharisees come to Jesus and
[19:41] demand of him when is the kingdom of God
[19:43] going to come and he answered out to
[19:45] them and said the kingdom of God cometh
[19:47] not with observation yes
[19:50] yes amen
[19:51] neither shall they say Lo here O Lord
[19:54] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[19:56] where the kingdom of God is within you
[20:00] but not everybody will experience at him
[20:02] and you're going to put up John 3 there
[20:04] amen 16. amen John 3 accept a man be
[20:08] born of water and of spirit he cannot
[20:10] see the kingdom of God Amen
[20:13] amen amen didn't Jesus say accept your
[20:15] man be born again he cannot see the
[20:17] kingdom
[20:18] so only born-again people can experience
[20:21] the kingdom of God Amen then he goes on
[20:23] to say except a man be born of water and
[20:25] of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom
[20:28] so all this time Jesus is prophesying
[20:30] the kingdom of God is coming look what
[20:32] he says here Luke 16 16.
[20:35] the Lord the prophets were unto John
[20:37] since that time the kingdom of God is
[20:39] preached
[20:41] and every man pressured into it
