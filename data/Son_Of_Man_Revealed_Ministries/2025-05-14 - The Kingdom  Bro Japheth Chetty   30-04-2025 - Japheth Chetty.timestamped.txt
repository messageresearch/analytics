[19:22] before you and humble ourselves before
[19:24] you ask your blessings in the mighty
[19:25] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[19:28] with much thanksgiving amen the Lord
[19:31] bless you may be seated amen I greet you
[19:33] all the precious, the mighty, the holy
[19:35] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[19:37] Christ. Amen. Who's worthy of praise.
[19:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We thank brother
[19:43] Shan for leading the songs. Amen. Amen.
[19:45] I know it may have been a bit different.
[19:48] Uh maybe we don't know all the songs,
[19:49] but I guess you'll learn the songs.
[19:51] Amen. A lot of them are message songs.
[19:54] Amen. Brother Romesh was unwell. He's
[19:55] not here in church tonight. Amen. We
[19:57] thank the show for stepping in and
[20:00] because brother Jeff is sharing the word
[20:02] so we have to rotate. Amen. Praise the
[20:05] Lord. Amen. But in the body there's
[20:07] diversity of gifts. And each one
[20:09] complimenting each other. Amen. Amen.
[20:12] Hallelujah. So we're thankful. Amen.
[20:13] That we can be gathered here tonight to
[20:15] worship him and give him praise. Amen.
[20:17] Even as we look around the world, we see
[20:19] a lot of things transpiring. Yes. Amen.
[20:22] And if you're looking in in terms of
[20:24] prophecy and what's happening, you you
[20:26] you you would be paying attention. Amen.
[20:28] That the pope has passed on. Hallelujah.
[20:32] And so made way now for another pope to
[20:35] come in on the scene. And we know that
[20:38] the next one could be the one that
[20:41] finishes it all. Amen. We know the the
[20:44] last pope brought about world religions.
[20:47] It accomplished that. There's no more
[20:49] dialogue about world religions. They
[20:51] were all united. Amen. As one. If you go
[20:54] look at the even the funeral, there was
[20:57] a Catholic priest that was singing in
[20:59] Arabic. Like you thought it was a Muslim
[21:01] person. You know the way they call do
[21:04] those songs. Amen. So they are uniting
[21:06] in a one world religion. That's what our
[21:08] prophet told us. They would unite all
[21:11] religions in a one world religion.
[21:14] Making an image unto the beast. Amen. We
[21:16] must never forget these things which the
[21:18] prophet taught us. Yes. Amen. As much as
[21:20] we want sermons to help us overcome
[21:22] life, this bride is built on revelation
[21:24] of the word. Amen. What what makes us uh
[21:28] not to be deceived is revelation because
[21:31] the prophet had already taught us what
[21:34] to look for. Amen. So, we're not moved.
[21:37] Then there's a there's something
[21:38] interesting that you need to maybe
[21:41] consider in the Roman Catholic own
[21:43] prophecy. There's a prophec Amen. one of
[21:47] the oldtime
[21:48] u cardinals. I don't know where he was.
[21:51] Amen. He was called Malachi and he had
[21:54] prophesied in the 1600s.
[21:57] Amen. That this will be the final pope
[22:00] that's coming on. Even in the where they
[22:04] put the pictures of the pope, they've
[22:05] only got one slot left. Amen. For the
[22:08] pope. So, I'm saying it's not
[22:10] coincidence. If we're running by their
[22:11] timeline, we can see they are saying
[22:14] it's their end.
[22:16] If we're running by the timeline of the
[22:17] US, we can see they are saying they at
[22:19] the end. And if we're running by the
[22:21] bride's timeline, we can see we are at
[22:24] the end. And then don't forget the
[22:26] ultimate timeline is Israel because that
[22:29] is God's time peace. Amen. So they have
[22:32] prepared for all our war and you know
[22:34] what's going on there. Amen. They're
[22:36] reclaiming their territories. Amen. So
[22:38] we are just thanking the Lord as we
[22:41] observing these things. We're also
[22:43] preparing ourselves for what is to come.
[22:46] Amen. Because the bride must be gone
[22:49] before the first born falls. That's what
[22:52] the prophecy is. This bride will be
[22:54] taken away. But in order to be taken
[22:56] away, she needs rapturing faith. Amen.
[22:58] Amen. So, if you're watching the the
[23:01] series of uh how the Lord has been
[23:03] taking us, we are not at the time, Amen.
[23:06] where the lamb has not taken the book.
[23:08] Hallelujah. We're at the time now where
[23:10] the lamb has already taken the book.
[23:12] Redemption's rights have been given to
[23:14] him. He has come down to the earth in
[23:16] Revelation 10 and now pronounced
[23:19] redemption rights upon us married to
[23:22] people and also bringing up to adoption.
[23:26] Do you know there's a portion of the
[23:27] bride body that will only fulfill
[23:30] scriptures that maybe Paul, Ireneius,
[23:33] Martin never fulfilled. Amen. This is
[23:36] now full adoption because adoption can
[23:38] only come at the top. Where was Paul and
[23:41] them? Right at the bottom. But as it
[23:44] narrows down, you may be thinking it's a
[23:45] little group of people. But he says this
[23:47] group of people as they coming up they
[23:50] he's calling them super church, super
[23:51] race as they nearing their headstone.
[23:54] And he says it'll be so in his image and
[23:56] likeness basically they will be Jesus
[23:58] Christ. Amen. Reproduced that it'll fit
[24:01] so perfectly with him. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[24:04] And that what he is calling adoption.
[24:07] That's when we are stepping now into
[24:09] dominion authority. Amen. The thought
[24:12] hit me when I'm driving now. I'll tell
[24:14] you why. There was there's this Hindu
[24:17] guy at work and uh so he's quoting a
[24:20] Christian girl and he was sharing this
[24:23] testimony. I was telling him, "Hey, I'm
[24:25] rushing off to to church now." So he
[24:27] then he he he found it. I didn't know
[24:29] why he was telling me this, but he was
[24:30] telling me this. He says, "You know
[24:32] what? I must tell you about this. It
[24:33] happened last week. He was there at his
[24:35] girlfriend's house and her aunt or
[24:37] somebody basically she stopped
[24:39] breathing. There was no pulse and she
[24:42] just laid stiff there for about 5
[24:44] minutes. Right? He says, he says she was
[24:47] like dead for 5 minutes. Then one of the
[24:50] Christian aunties came there and she
[24:53] said, "Lord, it's resurrection Sunday.
[24:55] It's resurrection. And as you raised up
[24:58] Jesus, raise up the sister." Hallelujah.
[25:00] Yeah, the sister came back to life.
[25:04] Right now, these are non-es people,
[25:08] right? The rain falls on the just and
[25:10] unjust. Praise the Lord. So, the thought
[25:13] hit me. Mark 16 says, "These signs shall
[25:17] follow them that believe."
[25:20] But adoption, son, believing is not in
[25:22] the equation.
[25:25] They already operating in perfect faith.
[25:27] Thank you, Lord. You get what I'm
[25:29] saying? Hallelujah. We are moving into a
[25:31] position now where believing will not be
[25:33] considered. Thank you Jesus. We don't
[25:35] doubt at all. Now remember what we have
[25:37] kept saying.
[25:39] There is no room for Satan to work
[25:41] because there's no doubt. Satan can only
[25:42] walk in doubt and reasoning. So the
[25:44] message of the hour has come now to
[25:46] position us into adoption age where all
[25:49] doubt is gone. So there's nothing for
[25:51] Satan that he can work through. Amen.
[25:54] With that I don't want to go too much
[25:55] because I don't know how Amen. the Lord
[25:57] is working tonight. So, amen. Let's
[26:00] stand together. We'll sing one song as
[26:01] we prepare our hearts now to hear the
[26:03] word of the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[26:06] Glory be to his name. Amen.
[26:13] Hallelujah. Let's sing. There is none
[26:15] like you from J. There is
[26:18] none like
[26:22] you. So no one else. No one else can
[26:27] touch my heart like you
[26:31] do. And I could search for all eternity
[26:37] long and
[26:39] find there is none like
[26:44] you. Sing it again. There's none like
[26:46] you. There is none like you. Amen. Over
[26:51] to brother John. No one
[26:55] else can touch my heart like you do.
[27:02] And I can search for all
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] eternity and
[27:09] find there is none like you. Let's sing
[27:13] that one more time. There is none.
[27:17] Oh, there is none like you.
[27:23] Lord, no one else, no one else can touch
[27:28] my heart like you
[27:30] [Music]
[27:32] do. And I can search for all
[27:36] eternity, Lord, and
[27:40] find there is none like you.
[27:47] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[27:49] prayer. Our heavenly father, we bow once
[27:51] again before you. We thank you, Lord,
[27:54] for this time that we can be gathered in
[27:55] your presence, oh God. Hallelujah. Lord,
[27:58] what a great privilege this is, oh God.
[28:00] There's no other place we'd rather be,
[28:02] oh God. And Father, many of times, oh
[28:04] God, Father, maybe we go through trials
[28:06] and testings and we have all of these
[28:08] cares of this life, Father, but when we
[28:10] come into your presence, we know there's
[28:12] fullness of joy, there's peace, beyond
[28:15] your measure, oh God. We can find a
[28:17] relief in your presence, oh God. We can
[28:20] find strength in your presence, oh God.
[28:22] And we pray now, Lord, that your word
[28:24] will come forth and will quicken us, oh
[28:26] God. Will uplift us in faith, oh God.
[28:28] Whatever is lacking in our life, oh God,
[28:31] Father, you know the right spiritual
[28:33] diet to give to us, oh God. And I pray,
[28:35] oh Lord, that Father, you will come and
[28:37] feed us beak to beak this evening, oh
[28:39] God. And that your word will take effect
[28:41] in our lives, oh God. Oh Lord, if
[28:43] there's any hindrance now, we pray, oh
[28:45] Lord, that it will be removed in Jesus
[28:47] name. Every spirit that is not of thine,
[28:49] Father, we cast it out because you've
[28:51] given us the authority, oh God, to cast
[28:54] out every evil spirit, Father. And Lord,
[28:56] I pray, oh Lord, that your sweet Holy
[28:58] Spirit will have the preeminence in this
[29:00] place, oh God. In Jesus precious name,
[29:02] we ask these things. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[29:06] Amen. I greet you, Lord, in the precious
[29:08] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[29:09] Christ. Amen. Amen. And you're blessed
[29:11] to be back in the house of the Lord.
[29:12] Yes. Amen. Brother Tyler, if you could
[29:15] just connect the monitor on the inside
[29:17] as well, just with him on the inside.
[29:20] Amen. We're glad to be back in the house
[29:22] of the Lord. Amen. This is the place
[29:24] where we come to draw strength, where we
[29:27] come to uh uplift our faith. Amen. Amen.
[29:30] Because as Christians, Amen. We know the
[29:32] prophet tells us that the Christian life
[29:34] is not an easy bed of roses. We go to
[29:36] trials. We go through tribulations. But
[29:39] amen, the Lord can prepare us. Amen. By
[29:41] his word, he can strengthen us. Amen.
[29:43] And give us a faith. Amen. So, just to
[29:46] read our opening scripture and then you
[29:48] can be seated. We'll turn to John
[29:51] chapter
[29:53] 20 and we're looking at verse
[30:01] 21. Tyler, maybe you could help me to
[30:04] connect the TV. Let's see if we can get
[30:05] the projector connected onto my laptop.
[30:08] And perhaps we could share the quotes
[30:20] tonight. Amen. John 20
[30:24] 21. Then Jesus Then said Jesus to them
[30:28] again, "Peace be unto you. As my father
[30:31] had sent me, even so send I you." And
[30:35] when he had said this, he breathed it on
[30:37] them and saith unto them, receive ye the
[30:40] Holy Ghost. Amen. Whosoever sins ye
[30:44] remit, they are remitted unto them. And
[30:46] whosoever sins you retain, they are
[30:48] retained. Amen. Just emphasize in verse
[30:51] 22 again. And when he had said this to
[30:54] them, he breatheth on them and said unto
[30:56] them, receive ye the Holy Ghost. And
[30:59] notice how it specifically in verse 23
[31:03] it now comes into the portion where
[31:05] whoever sins remmit shall be remitted.
[31:07] Whoever sins retain shall be retained.
[31:10] Amen. The Lord add blessings to the
[31:11] reading of the word. You may be seated.
[31:13] Amen. Amen. Let's just see if we can get
[31:16] this working.
[31:44] Okay, I think if it's going to go on and
[31:46] off, I'll just pull it
[31:48] out. Amen. The Lord is good. The Lord
[31:51] will grant us grace. Amen. Amen. So,
[31:53] amen. You all happy in the house of the
[31:54] Lord tonight? Amen. So, tonight for a
[31:57] little subject, I just want to speak on
[31:59] the kingdom. Amen. We know we are part
[32:01] of a kingdom. Amen. And amen, we are
[32:03] kingdom people. So, we just want to
[32:04] speak on that. But before I go into it,
[32:07] I just want to place this message in in
[32:08] its right context. A few weeks back I
[32:12] was uh away at Jakensburg and on the
[32:15] Sunday Pastor Adrian preached and I was
[32:17] not here and I believed he touched on
[32:20] the subject of the
[32:21] kingdom and I was meant to preach the
[32:24] witness day after that. Um but we had
[32:28] our visiting minister from India and
[32:31] then thereafter we had the Easter
[32:32] conventions and so forth. So I did not
[32:34] preach there then. But when I came back
[32:37] from Jensenburg, I asked pastor, you
[32:39] know, what did you preach on? And he
[32:41] told me that he preached on the kingdom.
[32:43] And I showed him a picture screenshot of
[32:45] my notes and said that's exactly the
[32:46] thoughts that the Lord had given to me.
[32:49] So I'm putting that into context to say
[32:52] if some things are repeated here, then
[32:54] the Holy Spirit is just reaffirming it
[32:55] and reconfirming it. And then maybe the
[32:58] Holy Spirit will also lead us into
[32:59] something that will be a continuation
[33:01] from that. Amen. Then we know it's the
[33:03] same angel of the Lord that's speaking.
[33:05] Amen. So, amen. We're going to speak on
[33:07] this kingdom. And we know that, Amen. We
[33:10] receive a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[33:11] Amen. We know that in this end time, the
[33:14] world is falling apart. The prophet
[33:16] preached the message and we see that the
[33:17] kingdoms have been shaken. But we have
[33:20] received a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[33:22] Amen. So, in the book of John here,
[33:26] Jesus, this is after he died and rose
[33:28] again and is about to leave the scene
[33:30] and ascend. And he's speaking to his
[33:33] disciples. And now he breathes upon them
[33:35] the Holy Ghost. Yes. And he says,
[33:37] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." Now we know
[33:41] that the disciples received the Holy
[33:43] Ghost on at the upper room experience.
[33:46] So there was a question put forth to the
[33:49] prophet and they asked him what's the
[33:51] difference between this portion of
[33:53] scripture where Jesus is breathing upon
[33:55] them the Holy Ghost and then when they
[33:57] gone in the upper room and received the
[33:58] Holy Ghost. What's the difference? And
[34:00] the prophet says
[34:01] [Music]
[34:02] here, Jesus breathed on the disciples
[34:05] and said, "Receive ye here the Holy
[34:07] Ghost." And when they had to go to the
[34:10] upper room to tar, it was a promise he
[34:12] gave them. Breathe upon them his
[34:15] promise. Yes. And said, "Receive ye the
[34:18] Holy Ghost." It was a promise. So they
[34:20] did not receive the Holy Ghost at that
[34:21] point. Jesus breathed upon them a
[34:24] promise. And then when they went onto
[34:26] the upper room, they had to carry there.
[34:28] And then that promise was fulfilled.
[34:30] Amen. When they received power from on
[34:32] high. Amen. Because Jesus told them
[34:35] ta in Jerusalem until you shall receive
[34:38] power from on high. Yes. So just like
[34:41] that, there's many promises now that's
[34:43] been given to this bride. And we've been
[34:45] believing these promises all through the
[34:47] years. You know, this bride is the super
[34:49] church, the super race. The bride is to
[34:51] prophesy again. She'll be an invincible
[34:53] army. Now those promises were breathed
[34:56] upon us by the prophet. Amen. Yes. But
[34:58] that was not the fulfillment of it when
[35:00] he prophesied it. Amen. But now comes
[35:02] the time. Amen. When we've been tearing
[35:04] all through the years and waiting upon
[35:05] the Lord and believing it in our heart,
[35:08] now comes the fulfillment of that
[35:09] promise. Amen.
[35:11] So the prophet goes on to say here, I'll
[35:15] give you the keys to the kingdom of
[35:17] heaven. This is Jesus now saying talking
[35:19] to the disciples when he spoke to Peter
[35:22] and Peter had this revelation of who
[35:24] Jesus was and he said I'll give you the
[35:26] keys to the kingdom of heaven. What is
[35:28] the kingdom of heaven? The Holy Spirit.
[35:31] Amen. There should be no doubt in our
[35:32] hearts what what the kingdom of God is.
[35:34] It's the Holy Spirit. Amen. And the
[35:37] Bible said the kingdom of heaven is
[35:39] within you. Amen. The king he says the
[35:43] kingdom is within you. Now he said some
[35:45] standing here will not see death until
[35:48] they see the kingdom of God come in
[35:49] power. Amen. And just a few days later
[35:53] there was Pentecost. See some stands
[35:55] here right now
[35:58] he had been transfigured and said they
[36:00] won't see it yet until you see the
[36:02] kingdom of God coming in power. Amen.
[36:04] Amen. And then he goes on to say I'm
[36:06] just laying a foundation with these
[36:07] quotes. Amen. He goes on to say the
[36:10] kingdom is within you. When Jesus rose
[36:12] from the dead, remember he had on his
[36:15] side the keys of death and hell, not the
[36:18] keys to the kingdom. So the prophet is
[36:20] saying, "Yeah, Jesus did not have the
[36:21] keys to the kingdom because he gave the
[36:23] keys to the kingdom to the church."
[36:26] Amen. He only has the keys to death and
[36:28] hell.
[36:29] Amen. So the keys to the kingdom is with
[36:31] the church.
[36:33] And he says here, "Do you believe Jesus
[36:35] would keep his word? If he doesn't,
[36:37] brother, he wasn't God." That's all he
[36:40] said. Peter, I'll give you the keys to
[36:41] the kingdom. In other words, to the Holy
[36:44] Spirit. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll
[36:47] bind in heaven. So, you see, God has
[36:50] this kingdom now. And we are subjects of
[36:52] this kingdom. Now, not only are we
[36:54] subjects of this kingdom, we are joint
[36:56] hes. So, we are ruling and reigning with
[36:58] him in in this kingdom. Amen. Amen. And
[37:01] so, in this kingdom, there's it operates
[37:04] by divine laws. Like any earthly kingdom
[37:06] now you have the laws of the land that
[37:08] govern how that country is run. Or
[37:11] perhaps in the olden days when they had
[37:13] a king and a kingdom they had a certain
[37:15] way of doing things just like that. Now
[37:17] in God's kingdom, God's kingdom operates
[37:20] by his spiritual laws. And his kingdom
[37:22] operates by the word of God. Amen. In
[37:25] fact, this kingdom has its own economy,
[37:27] its own currency. This kingdom has its
[37:30] own defense system. Amen. Amen. Its own
[37:32] military system. Amen. You see, God's
[37:34] kingdom, amen, is is such a kingdom,
[37:37] amen, that there's all kinds of attacks
[37:40] against this kingdom. Amen. Because the
[37:42] enemy also has his kingdom. And the
[37:45] prophet says that the enemy now in this
[37:46] end time, he is ruling and reigning in
[37:49] Satan's Eden. And it's a kingdom that he
[37:52] is trying to raise against God's
[37:54] kingdom. Just like how in the beginning
[37:56] in the garden of
[37:57] Eden when God's kingdom was all perfect.
[38:00] Amen. Adam was ruling and reigning but
[38:03] Satan arose his kingdom and started and
[38:05] came through deceit. Amen. To try and
[38:07] deceive the children of God. So God's
[38:10] kingdom has its own defense
[38:12] system. So we want to see amen that
[38:15] we've been a part of this kingdom. Now
[38:17] how do we fall apart from this kingdom?
[38:20] Amen. You will notice that the believer,
[38:23] Amen, his life is a supernatural life.
[38:26] The believer's life, amen, has many
[38:28] facets to it. In as much as he's living
[38:31] in this world, he's not of this world.
[38:33] Amen. He's ruling and reigning from
[38:34] another kingdom. Now, you are going to
[38:36] work, you're going to school, and so
[38:38] forth. And you are participating in an
[38:41] earthly kingdom. Your flesh body is.
[38:44] Amen. But whilst you are doing that, you
[38:46] are ruling and reigning from a spiritual
[38:48] kingdom. Amen. Amen. So in other words,
[38:51] in this kingdom there's sickness and
[38:53] death. Yes. Amen. So when the doctor
[38:55] pronounces sickness upon you, that's in
[38:57] this kingdom. But now you are ruling and
[38:59] reigning not from this kingdom, but from
[39:01] a spiritual kingdom. And so when when
[39:03] they pronounce sickness upon you, you
[39:05] take it up now to a spiritual kingdom.
[39:08] And you say no, the word of God in this
[39:10] kingdom says that I was healed. Amen.
[39:14] You are not trying to govern things
[39:15] through this earthly kingdom. Amen. That
[39:17] is why the Bible says we wrestle not
[39:19] against flesh and blood. Amen. But we
[39:21] wrestle against principalities, powers
[39:23] in high places. Amen. Because the where
[39:26] is the believer's position in Christ?
[39:27] It's seated in heavenly places in Christ
[39:30] Jesus. Amen. You're reigning from a
[39:32] supreme kingdom. Amen. So that is why I
[39:35] said the believer's life is laced with
[39:37] supernatural activities. Now you might
[39:40] not easily sometimes recognize the
[39:42] supernatural happening in your life. You
[39:44] might just take it for granted or
[39:46] overlook things. But I guarantee you if
[39:48] you look closer, you will see the
[39:50] supernatural hand of God in your life.
[39:53] Example, none of us are seated here just
[39:56] on purpose. Amen. God called us to the
[39:58] message of the hour. Now, no doubt each
[40:01] one had their own supernatural
[40:02] experience of how you came to the
[40:04] message. Amen. And I hope you don't mind
[40:06] if I if I preach a little bit of
[40:08] testimony tonight. Amen. Because Amen.
[40:10] Sometimes, Amen. We can preach the
[40:12] quotes. We can preach about the
[40:14] prophet's testimonies, but if you don't
[40:16] have your own testimonies to back up,
[40:18] you're only trying to warm someone with
[40:20] a painted fire. Amen. You're trying to
[40:22] warm someone up with history. Amen. You
[40:24] know, David, when he came to King Saul,
[40:27] now here was King Saul and he had a job
[40:29] position open. He needed someone to
[40:31] defeat Goliath. Amen. He had a job. No
[40:34] one else wanted to take the job or no
[40:36] one was qualified to even take the job.
[40:38] So, here comes David now and he sees
[40:40] this job opening. someone to take down
[40:42] Goliath. And what does he do? He hands
[40:44] his CV to Saul. Wonderful. You know, and
[40:47] Saul starts to look at his CV. He looks
[40:49] at the first page. He says, "Okay, your
[40:51] name is David." He sees, you know, you
[40:53] you're looking quite young for the job.
[40:54] Your age is a bit young. Amen. You know,
[40:57] this guy, he was a warrior from his
[40:58] youth and you haven't been trained in
[41:00] war and you're looking quite young. On
[41:02] top of that, you know, your health
[41:03] doesn't look too good. You look a bit
[41:05] skinny for the job. You know, he looks
[41:07] like a giant eye and you look a bit
[41:09] skinny for the job. So he goes on
[41:11] reading and he says you know where are
[41:13] you from? He says no you are from the
[41:16] tribe of Judah from Bethlehem but no
[41:19] good thing can come out of Bethlehem. We
[41:21] know that. So Saul is looking at his CV
[41:23] now but David says you know what there's
[41:25] another page to the CV. Just turn over.
[41:27] So Saul turns over and he sees past job
[41:29] experiences. Wonderful. Amen. And as he
[41:32] looks at it he sees you know I killed a
[41:35] bear with my bare hands. Once upon a
[41:37] time I killed a lion with my bare hands.
[41:39] What is it? David is preaching to Saul
[41:41] his own experiences so that he he can
[41:45] show that he's qualified for the job.
[41:47] Amen. And so the bride in this hour and
[41:49] more specifically any minister that
[41:51] steps behind the platform must have his
[41:53] own experiences to show that he's
[41:55] qualified for the job. You got to know
[41:57] what you're talking about. Amen. Because
[41:59] the prophet says we can't get warm by a
[42:01] painted fire. Amen. So like I was
[42:03] saying, we each we each all have our own
[42:07] supernatural experiences of how we came
[42:08] into the message. You know when I was
[42:12] out there in the denomination now I
[42:14] wasn't uh you know I wouldn't say I
[42:17] wasn't serving God. I was quite
[42:19] religious in serving God, quite
[42:20] religious in going to church. And you
[42:22] know, I followed my dad, my dad being a
[42:24] preacher. Wherever he went to campaigns
[42:26] late in the night, we'd walk out to 10
[42:28] meetings. And that was the kind of
[42:31] desire I
[42:32] had. And you know, brother Josh, when he
[42:35] came into the message, he started to
[42:36] witness to me and I started to look at
[42:39] these scriptures. But I couldn't
[42:40] understand for me at that time I
[42:42] couldn't understand how how my brother
[42:45] would tell me these things because prior
[42:47] to that you know Joshua's in the world
[42:49] he had his own experiences and I was
[42:52] never in the world. I was always serving
[42:53] God. So I couldn't fathom in in my mind
[42:56] how my brother would be telling me these
[42:59] things. But nevertheless, you know, I
[43:01] was invited to the service and when I
[43:05] was in the service, you know, it wasn't
[43:07] necessarily some uh great doctrine that
[43:09] caught me or anything like that. But
[43:12] when I was in when I walked into the
[43:14] service, there was the sister singing
[43:16] when he's 4 days late, but he's still on
[43:18] time.
[43:20] And as I walked in and she was singing
[43:22] the song, something just got a hold of
[43:24] me and said, "This is where you need to
[43:26] be."
[43:27] Now bearing in mind this is not an easy
[43:29] thing to do. I had relationships in
[43:32] where I was at my past church. I had a
[43:34] position as a Sunday school teacher. I
[43:37] was uh getting started to get involved
[43:39] in the music there and I was quite
[43:42] heavily involved in the church. So it's
[43:44] not an easy thing just to leave like
[43:46] that you know but something just got a
[43:49] hold of me that it took away all desire
[43:51] to go back
[43:54] and you know maybe I haven't shared this
[43:56] portion of it before when I was much
[43:59] younger you know every um minister or
[44:04] visiting person that would come to my
[44:05] dad or to the churches that we were
[44:07] whenever they used to pray with me they
[44:09] would they would always prophesy and say
[44:11] you know you have a very prophetic
[44:13] anointing on you and now this is like
[44:15] many many people from some from Germany
[44:18] some from Israel all from different
[44:20] parts of life saying this to me and at
[44:22] that time because I was in the
[44:23] denomination I took the denomination
[44:26] interpretation of that meaning that
[44:28] you're going to you know in the
[44:28] denomination you got many prophets now
[44:30] everyone's a prophet in the denomination
[44:32] so I took that as the interpretation of
[44:34] those prophecies and so I would pray and
[44:37] say to God you know if this is what you
[44:39] call me to do I would fast and pray and
[44:41] say show me a vision or show me give
[44:43] give me a prophecy and this is me now at
[44:45] the age of maybe standard four standard
[44:48] three at that young age I'll be seeking
[44:50] the Lord and and saying Lord if if this
[44:53] is your is your will for me then give me
[44:55] these gifts only later on when I came in
[44:57] the message that I realized they were
[45:00] referring to me being under a prophetic
[45:02] anointing because remember the bride is
[45:04] under a prophetic anointing in fact the
[45:06] bride has to prophesy again how can she
[45:08] do that if she's not prophetic amen so
[45:11] you see the bride is under a prophetic
[45:12] anointing
[45:14] But you see, we come through these
[45:16] supernatural experiences that lead us to
[45:18] where God wants us to be. Just like our
[45:21] David now, he needed to be there at the
[45:23] army. And God supernaturally led him
[45:25] there. But before he led him there, he
[45:28] gave him those experiences to build him
[45:30] up. Amen. Amen. Before God sends you to
[45:33] your Goliath, he's going to give you
[45:34] smaller tests. Amen. He's going to build
[45:36] you up in faith. Amen.
[45:39] Now, as I was saying, the believer's
[45:40] life is laced with supernatural. Now,
[45:42] but the difference is the difference is
[45:45] with the believer, they base all the
[45:47] supernatural things according to the
[45:49] word of God. Amen. They always have the
[45:51] word of God as their foundation. Amen.
[45:53] Amen. You can't base Amen. your
[45:56] experience and you can't rely on your
[45:58] experience to tell you the truth. Amen.
[46:00] You got to rely on the word of God. And
[46:02] when your experience matches the word of
[46:04] God, then you can have confidence in it.
[46:05] Amen. You know, many people have
[46:07] experiences. Yes. In fact, I have a
[46:10] friend um you know from school and uh he
[46:14] used to be just a normal Christian just
[46:16] because he was born in a Christian home
[46:19] and after school he went to um you know
[46:22] these police training in Cape Town and
[46:25] he came back to serve as a police
[46:26] officer and when he came back he came
[46:28] back a very changed person. He went on
[46:32] to start to believe in science and he
[46:34] got very analytical about like Steven
[46:36] Daw, Richard Dawkins and Steven Hawkins
[46:39] and all of these great scientists. So
[46:42] over the years we've always had great
[46:44] debates about he'll debate about science
[46:46] to me and I'll debate him about the word
[46:48] of God and we'll try and influence each
[46:50] other to say who is correct, you know,
[46:52] and and we still do that up until today.
[46:55] But about 2 years ago, he had an
[46:58] experience. He had a a sort of a serious
[47:01] illness and he was in hospital. He went
[47:03] for a procedure. So after the procedure
[47:06] and you know he has under all these
[47:07] anesthetics and stuff. Whilst asleep he
[47:11] felt himself slipping away and he felt
[47:13] himself kind of beaming himself.
[47:16] And when this happened, he saw this
[47:19] great light. And when he walked towards
[47:22] this great light, he said, and now he's
[47:25] explaining this experience to me when he
[47:27] came back. He said when he walked
[47:30] towards this great life, he light, he
[47:32] felt such a peace. He said there was no
[47:34] worry, there was no care, there was only
[47:36] joy, there was only peace. But at that
[47:39] moment, he thought his memory came back
[47:42] to him and he thought about his baby. He
[47:44] at that time he just had a baby and he
[47:46] said you know if I step into this light
[47:47] now I'm going to cross over to another
[47:50] dimension and who's going to raise my
[47:52] baby? So he never he never stepped into
[47:53] the light he stepped away and he then
[47:55] came back to himself and he woke up. So
[47:59] he he's sharing this experience to me.
[48:01] And I told him, you know, you had this
[48:04] experience. You as a scientist, you are
[48:06] always saying you need evidence. You
[48:08] need physical evidence. You need to see
[48:10] for yourself. You're always saying that.
[48:12] Now here, God shows you a glimpse of
[48:14] another dimension.
[48:17] In fact, you have more reason to believe
[48:19] now than me because I've never seen that
[48:20] dimension.
[48:22] But yet now, even then, he still doubts.
[48:26] So what am I saying to you? I'm saying
[48:28] your spiritual experience if it doesn't
[48:31] be founded upon the word of God, it
[48:33] doesn't mean anything. Amen. Many people
[48:35] can have experiences, but we thank God
[48:37] for the revelation of the message of the
[48:39] hour that can reveal to us our identity.
[48:42] Because what takes away our spiritual
[48:44] amnesia? It's the revelation of the
[48:46] word. Amen. It's the message of the hour
[48:48] that takes away our amnesia. So you see,
[48:51] many people can have experiences, but
[48:53] the believer's life is different. The
[48:56] believer's life is based on a
[48:57] supernatural experience tied to the word
[48:59] of God. Amen.
[49:01] Amen. So the prophet goes on to
[49:04] say he was crucified, died, rose the
[49:08] third day, was on earth for 40 days
[49:10] among men, and ascended up into heaven
[49:13] and told them, "Wait till they seen the
[49:15] kingdom of God come upon them. At this
[49:18] time, the father will restore the
[49:20] kingdom in a spiritual form to them."
[49:22] Yes. Now, notice what the prophet is
[49:24] saying here. He's saying that because at
[49:26] that time the children of Israel were
[49:28] looking for a physical kingdom. They
[49:30] were looking for Jesus to come and
[49:32] physically take over and defeat the
[49:34] Romans and start to rule and reign
[49:36] physically upon the earth. Yes. But
[49:38] Jesus is telling them, "No, I've not
[49:40] come to do that. I've come to reveal to
[49:42] you a spiritual kingdom." Amen. Amen.
[49:45] And why I say that is because you know
[49:48] it's very easy in this day now to say
[49:50] you know we are going to our heavenly
[49:52] kingdom when we go in the rapture we are
[49:54] going into that new dimension and then
[49:57] we got the future home of the bride.
[49:59] It's all good to believe in those things
[50:01] and those things will come. But first
[50:03] Jesus has to restore the spiritual
[50:05] kingdom. He has to give you the keys to
[50:08] the kingdom which is the Holy Spirit.
[50:09] And you've got to rule and reign from
[50:11] his spiritual kingdom first before we go
[50:13] to that physical kingdom. Amen.
[50:17] So, amen. That is why he calls it the
[50:19] keys to the kingdom. Amen. Without that,
[50:22] you can't even enter. What did Jesus
[50:24] say? Unless you be born again, you can't
[50:27] even see the kingdom of God, let alone
[50:28] enter the kingdom of God. Amen. So,
[50:31] amen. We'll turn to our B Bibles to the
[50:33] book of Luke. And we know that Jesus
[50:37] came to represent this kingdom to us. We
[50:40] know that Adam ruled and reigned in this
[50:42] kingdom. And we know Jesus was the
[50:44] second Adam who showed us how Adam
[50:47] lived. He came to show us what kind of a
[50:49] man that Adam was. Amen. So if you want
[50:52] to look at Jesus life through the
[50:54] scriptures, you are going to see how
[50:56] Jesus is ruling and reigning in this
[50:58] kingdom and how he wants this kingdom to
[50:59] operate. Amen. Amen. Now here Jesus is
[51:04] sending out the 77 disciples right and
[51:07] this is before they received the Holy
[51:08] Ghost. So before they received the
[51:10] kingdom he says after these things we
[51:13] reading from verse uh chapter 10 verse
[51:15] 10 sorry
[51:18] 10:1 after these things the Lord
[51:21] appointed 70 others also and sent them
[51:24] two by two ahead of him into every city
[51:27] and place whether he would come himself.
[51:31] Therefore, he said unto them, "The
[51:33] harvest truly is great, but the laborers
[51:34] are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of
[51:37] the harvest that he would send forth
[51:39] laborers into his harvest." So, first we
[51:41] can see in the kingdom of God, there is
[51:43] a harvest to reap. Amen. Amen. There's
[51:45] labors in the kingdom of God and there
[51:47] is a harvest to
[51:49] reap. Amen. Amen. Now, if we go to verse
[51:52] four, he says, "Carry neither person nor
[51:54] pack nor shoes and salute no man by the
[51:56] way." What is what is he what is he
[51:58] trying to say? He's trying to say in
[51:59] this kingdom when you are going to serve
[52:01] the Lord. Amen. You got to not have any
[52:03] thought for your own life. Amen. Amen.
[52:05] You got to forsake your own life, you
[52:07] got to forsake the cares and burdens of
[52:09] this life. Amen. Amen. And into
[52:12] whatsoever house you enter, first say,
[52:14] "Peace be to this house." And if the son
[52:17] of peace be there, your peace shall rest
[52:19] upon it. If not, it shall return unto
[52:21] you again. Amen. We're just going to
[52:24] skip over to verse 9.
[52:28] and heal the sick that are therein and
[52:32] say unto them the kingdom of God is come
[52:34] n unto you. So here when they are going
[52:37] out preaching the gospel and healing the
[52:39] sick Jesus is saying the kingdom of God
[52:42] is coming n unto you. Now he's giving us
[52:44] clues here of how this kingdom operates.
[52:46] In other words, in this kingdom, amen,
[52:49] the sick is healed in this kingdom. The
[52:52] good news is preached in this kingdom.
[52:54] Amen. The backsliden is delivered. Amen.
[52:58] He's giving us a clue of how this
[53:00] kingdom operates. But notice he's saying
[53:01] the kingdom of God is come nigh unto
[53:03] you. It is not saying the kingdom of God
[53:05] has come to you because the Holy Spirit
[53:07] had not come as yet. But in whatsoever
[53:10] city you enter and receive you not, go
[53:13] your way out and into the streets of the
[53:15] same and say, even the very dust of your
[53:18] city which cleaveth on us, we do wipe
[53:21] against you. Notwithstanding, be ye sure
[53:24] of this that the kingdom of God is come
[53:27] nigh unto you. Amen. Amen. So you see
[53:29] when the good news is being preached, we
[53:32] are preaching the kingdom of God to the
[53:33] people who are introducing them to
[53:35] another kingdom, something that's
[53:37] different from the kingdom that they are
[53:39] accustomed to.
[53:42] Amen. Now the disciples then they go out
[53:46] and they fulfill this, right? And they
[53:48] come back to Jesus. Amen. We go on to
[53:50] verse 17.
[53:52] And the 70 returned again with joy,
[53:54] saying, Lord, even the devils are
[53:56] subject unto us through thy name. And
[53:59] Jesus said unto them, I beheld Satan as
[54:02] lightning fall from heaven. Now, this is
[54:05] very interesting. I always thought that
[54:07] this meant Jesus was referring back to
[54:09] when Lucifer fell from
[54:11] heaven. But when I researched and saw
[54:14] what the prophet said about it, that's
[54:15] not what he says. He says in in
[54:18] explaining the scripture he says that
[54:20] was immediately after this after the
[54:23] disciples went out and did did this cast
[54:25] out evil spirits and so forth Jesus gave
[54:28] his disciples power against unclean
[54:30] spirits and they went out casting out
[54:32] devils sent them two by two and said
[54:35] don't go to the Gentiles but go rather
[54:37] to the lost sheep of Israel as you go
[54:39] preach then the kingdom of heaven and
[54:41] heal the sick and cast out devils and so
[54:44] forth and they came back rejoicing
[54:46] happily. And he said, "Rejoice not
[54:49] because the devils are subject unto you,
[54:52] but rejoice because your names are
[54:53] written in heaven." He said, "I beheld
[54:56] Satan fall from heaven like lightning."
[54:58] Now, see what this means. See the power
[55:01] of that church moving forward had upset
[55:04] the whole kingdom of Satan. You see, and
[55:06] he saw him referring to Satan as he
[55:10] dropped from
[55:11] places. What is he saying? He's saying
[55:13] when this 77 went out casting out
[55:16] devils, he saw Satan drop dimensions. He
[55:19] saw Satan fall from higher places. In
[55:22] other words, the kingdom of Satan
[55:23] started to be get destroyed. Amen. Just
[55:26] by them going out casting out evil
[55:28] spirit. They started to destroy the
[55:29] kingdom of God. And Jesus is saying as
[55:31] you were doing that, I saw Satan started
[55:33] to fall. Amen. So if this was the 77
[55:37] before they received the Holy Ghost,
[55:39] before they received the kingdom of God.
[55:41] Amen. How much more are the church when
[55:43] they receive the kingdom of God and are
[55:45] operating by a kingdom principle? Amen.
[55:48] We said many times, amen, when we say,
[55:50] "Thus say the Lord," Amen. It's atomic
[55:52] warfare on the enemy. Amen. The enemy's
[55:55] kingdom is being destroyed. That is why
[55:57] Jesus said when you are casting out
[55:58] devils, I saw Satan fall. Amen.
[56:01] Hallelujah. So don't doubt your prayers.
[56:03] Amen. Don't doubt your confession. Amen.
[56:06] Because when you speak, Amen. It's
[56:07] impacting realms. It's impacting
[56:09] dimensions. Amen. because you are ruling
[56:12] and reigning from a spiritual kingdom.
[56:15] Amen. Hallelujah.
[56:17] Glory, Lord. Thank you, Lord. And then
[56:20] he goes on to say the scripture now in
[56:21] verse 19, behold, I give you power to
[56:24] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[56:27] all the power of the enemy, and nothing
[56:29] shall by any means hurt you. Therefore,
[56:31] we don't have to worry. We don't have to
[56:33] fear. Amen. Amen.
[56:39] Amen. Hallelujah. is worthy of all
[56:40] praise. Amen. Aren't you glad to be a
[56:42] part of this king? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[56:45] Just bear with me. We don't have the
[56:46] quotes today, so I'm trying to digest it
[56:48] easily for
[56:51] you. Amen. So Jesus goes on, Amen.
[56:55] talking about this kingdom and someone
[56:57] uh reach someone screams out to him and
[57:00] and they say apparently it's a lawyer.
[57:02] Amen. So these lawyers are bad guys.
[57:04] Amen.
[57:06] So he screams out to him and say, "You
[57:09] know what? What can I do to receive then
[57:11] eternal life? You're talking about this
[57:13] kingdom. How can I receive it?" And now
[57:15] look at where Jesus directs him to after
[57:18] he says, "Have you followed the
[57:19] commandments and so forth?" Jesus now
[57:22] refers into the good Samaritan. Jesus is
[57:24] taken into charity because Amen. Why is
[57:27] charity so important in this kingdom?
[57:29] Amen. Because this kingdom is operating
[57:31] by charity. Amen. Hallelujah. If you
[57:34] don't have charity, you can't operate in
[57:35] the kingdom of God because what? Eternal
[57:38] life is living for others. And how do
[57:40] you live for others without charity?
[57:42] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So Jesus refers
[57:45] into charity. Amen.
[57:48] Hallelujah. Then to end of the
[57:51] scripture, the same chapter from there,
[57:53] Jesus then goes on now and now they go
[57:56] to the story of ma Martha and Mary.
[57:58] Amen. And I'm continuing with the
[58:01] scripture because Jesus is showing you
[58:02] how the kingdom operates, right? And now
[58:04] he goes on to Martha and Mary and we
[58:06] know the story how uh Martha gets uh
[58:10] upset now with Mary because Mary is not
[58:12] helping her with all of the chores and
[58:13] all of these things and Mary's sitting
[58:15] at Jesus' feet and and Martha comes to
[58:17] Jesus and say you don't care that you
[58:19] know Mary is not helping you but Jesus
[58:21] says Mary has chosen that better
[58:23] portion. Amen. See in the kingdom of God
[58:25] you got to forget about the cares of
[58:27] this life. You got to choose that better
[58:29] portion. Amen. You got to choose that
[58:31] portion which has eternal merit. Amen.
[58:33] That portion that will not corrupt.
[58:35] Amen.
[58:43] Hallelujah. Amen. Just one more
[58:45] scripture on this point. Luke
[58:49] 11:18. It says, "If Satan also be
[58:53] divided against
[58:55] himself, how shall his kingdom stand?
[58:58] Because ye say that I cast devils
[59:00] through
[59:01] Belove. And if I by Belove cast out
[59:04] devils, by whom do your sons cast them
[59:07] out, therefore shall they be your
[59:09] judges." Now listen to what Jesus says.
[59:12] But if I with the finger of God cast out
[59:14] devils, no doubt the kingdom of God has
[59:17] come upon you. Notice this this
[59:19] recurring theme. Amen. The kingdom of
[59:21] God involves the casting out of evil
[59:23] spirits. And Jesus is saying if I by the
[59:26] finger of God, in other words, because
[59:29] the spirit of God is dwelling in Jesus,
[59:31] now the fullness of God dwells in Jesus.
[59:33] So the Holy Spirit is embodied in Jesus.
[59:36] So he said, if I by the spirit that
[59:38] lives in me cast out these evil spirits,
[59:40] the kingdom of God is come unto you. And
[59:43] that's the same how when the believer is
[59:45] filled with the Holy Spirit now and is
[59:47] now manifesting as a word son of God by
[59:51] the spirit that's within him then he's
[59:53] operating by the kingdom principle now.
[59:55] Then when he speaks the kingdom is in
[59:57] operation that is why that is what Jesus
[59:59] is trying to show us. Amen. Through the
[1:00:02] scripture. Amen. Now we know that Mary
[1:00:07] types the elect of God. Right? Mary
[1:00:10] received the angel's message. Yes. And
[1:00:13] she said, "Be it unto me according to
[1:00:14] thy word." Right. And then the word took
[1:00:17] conception in her and there had to be a
[1:00:20] time of conception where she carried,
[1:00:23] amen, the seed within her for 9 months.
[1:00:25] But then there came a time when she had
[1:00:27] to now deliver this baby. Right. The
[1:00:29] word made flesh. Yes. So she delivers
[1:00:32] this the word made flesh. And the word
[1:00:35] starts to grow up. starts off as a child
[1:00:38] in in its infancy and the word starts to
[1:00:41] grow up. Now the word comes to the age
[1:00:43] of accountability at the age of 12.
[1:00:47] Right? And here Mary and Joseph now
[1:00:52] attends the the Passover in Jerusalem.
[1:00:55] Amen. And you know that's kind of like
[1:00:57] our Easter convention around Easter
[1:00:59] time. Every year they would attend this
[1:01:01] Passover. Amen.
[1:01:04] And after performing all of their
[1:01:06] religious affairs, you know, they
[1:01:08] started to make their journey on their
[1:01:10] way back home. And on their way back
[1:01:12] home, they realized that they they left
[1:01:14] the word back in Jerusalem. You know,
[1:01:18] like some people after the convention,
[1:01:19] they leave the word at the convention.
[1:01:21] They don't take the word with them.
[1:01:23] Amen. They were so focused on their
[1:01:25] religious affairs that the word made
[1:01:28] flesh which he brought forth, they
[1:01:30] forgot back in Jerusalem. But thankfully
[1:01:32] the prophet tells us, amen, if you
[1:01:35] realize something is wrong in your life,
[1:01:37] go back to where you left God. Amen. So
[1:01:40] Mary and Joseph starts to retrace back
[1:01:42] their steps. They start to ask around
[1:01:44] amongst their relatives, have you seen
[1:01:46] the word made flesh? Now that's already
[1:01:49] a wrong picture. Yeah. Because you
[1:01:52] bought the word made flesh. Now you are
[1:01:54] looking for the experiences of other
[1:01:55] people. Amen. It's supposed to be
[1:01:58] protected and safeguarded by yourself.
[1:02:00] Amen. Amen. So they make their way back
[1:02:04] to Jerusalem and they find the word
[1:02:06] where the word is always. The the word
[1:02:08] is always about the father's business.
[1:02:10] Amen. Amen. So whenever you find
[1:02:13] yourself lost and drifted away, come
[1:02:15] back to the father's business. Come back
[1:02:17] to the kingdom of God. Now remember our
[1:02:19] topic. We're talking about the kingdom
[1:02:20] of God. Yes. So here the word now is is
[1:02:25] is speaking to all of these Pharisees
[1:02:27] and these great teachers and is and they
[1:02:30] all marvel at his wisdom because why?
[1:02:32] He's speaking from another kingdom now.
[1:02:34] They've never heard this before. They've
[1:02:36] never heard such speech before. Yes. And
[1:02:39] so Mary and Joseph now come all upset
[1:02:41] and they ask Jesus, you know, why have
[1:02:44] you done this to us? Now like it's the
[1:02:46] word's problem. Now they were supposed
[1:02:48] to be taking care of the word. They ask
[1:02:51] Jesus, "Why have you done this to us?
[1:02:53] We've been looking all over for you."
[1:02:55] And Jesus then corrects them and tells
[1:02:58] them, "Don't you know I'm about my
[1:02:59] father's business. I must be about my
[1:03:01] father's business."
[1:03:03] Right? But I want to show you now what
[1:03:05] Mary does. Mary then, you know, she, you
[1:03:09] know, parents are, they must have been
[1:03:11] frustrated, must have been upset and
[1:03:13] kind of scolds him. And she then takes
[1:03:16] Jesus with them, right? And the Bible
[1:03:18] goes on to
[1:03:20] say, "Then he went down to Nazareth with
[1:03:24] them and was obedient to them." Now
[1:03:27] notice now instead of them being
[1:03:29] obedient to the word, the word now is
[1:03:32] being restricted by them. Now remember,
[1:03:34] Mary is typing the individual. Yes. Mary
[1:03:36] is typing us. And this is how we can
[1:03:39] restrict the word in our lives. This is
[1:03:41] how the flesh body can sometimes jump up
[1:03:44] and want to take control of the spirit
[1:03:45] man. Yes. Amen. So that is what is
[1:03:48] happening here. And notice from that
[1:03:50] point from the age of 12 we don't hear
[1:03:53] nothing about Jesus until he reaches 30.
[1:03:56] Yes. Why? Because now the word is now
[1:03:58] following
[1:03:59] Mary. So that inhibits the ministry. Now
[1:04:03] I don't mean to sound sacriiggious
[1:04:05] because we know God has everything in
[1:04:06] his will. God had an appointed time,
[1:04:09] right? But I'm just trying to show you
[1:04:10] the type of how we can restrict the word
[1:04:13] from fulfilling what it's supposed to be
[1:04:17] fulfilling. Amen. And so now we don't
[1:04:21] hear nothing about Jesus up until the
[1:04:23] age of
[1:04:24] 30. And now comes Amen. After Jesus goes
[1:04:27] down to the river Jordan and gets
[1:04:29] baptized and so forth and the spirit
[1:04:31] indwells him, now they come to the
[1:04:34] wedding. Amen. at Kaa of Galilee and the
[1:04:39] wine runs
[1:04:41] out. Now here comes now the mother of
[1:04:45] Jesus. The Bible says calls her the
[1:04:47] mother of Jesus here in verse 2 in John
[1:04:49] chapter 2:2 or verse one. And the third
[1:04:53] day was a marriage in Canaa of Galilee.
[1:04:56] And the mother of Jesus was there. And
[1:04:58] both Jesus was called and his disciples
[1:05:00] to the marriage. And when they wanted
[1:05:03] wine, the mother of Jesus said unto
[1:05:05] them, "They have no wine." Jesus said
[1:05:08] unto her, "Woman." Now notice firstly
[1:05:10] the word corrects the error. All along
[1:05:12] it said, "The mother of Jesus." And
[1:05:14] Jesus says, "Yeah, woman." He doesn't
[1:05:16] call her mother. Says, "Woman, what have
[1:05:19] I to do with thee?" In other words, why
[1:05:22] are you bothering me? Why are you
[1:05:23] troubling me? This is not my for not my
[1:05:25] problem. if the wine is wine out. And he
[1:05:28] says, now look what he says, my hour is
[1:05:30] not yet come.
[1:05:33] Now the same Mary that restricted the
[1:05:35] word when he was at 12, when he was
[1:05:36] ready to to confound the Pharisees and
[1:05:39] confound the teachers and go about the
[1:05:40] father's business, was ready to do all
[1:05:42] of that now was restricted up until the
[1:05:45] age of 30. And now he says, "Now my hour
[1:05:46] is not yet come."
[1:05:49] Amen. So the same Mary now because she
[1:05:51] restricted the word, she has to be the
[1:05:53] one to put the word back in effect. So
[1:05:56] if you restrict the word in your life,
[1:05:57] Amen. the word is not going to take
[1:05:59] effect until you recognize what you did
[1:06:01] and you bring the word back into effect
[1:06:03] in your life. Amen. Because the word is
[1:06:06] made flesh. Amen. By you. You bear the
[1:06:09] word. Amen. So now you you got to reap
[1:06:12] the fruits of the word. Amen. And so you
[1:06:14] got to know how to operate the word. So
[1:06:16] Mary now, even though Jesus said that,
[1:06:18] she pays no attention to that. She tells
[1:06:20] the servant, "Do what he says." Amen. So
[1:06:23] in other words, Mary has so much of
[1:06:24] confidence now in the word that she puts
[1:06:26] the word into effect.
[1:06:29] Amen. So we could have believed the the
[1:06:32] word the message of the hour for years
[1:06:33] and years. Amen. That does not mean the
[1:06:35] word is in effect. There's got there's
[1:06:37] come a time now when the bride of Christ
[1:06:40] is now starting to put the word in
[1:06:41] effect. Amen. Perhaps they've restricted
[1:06:43] the word all of these years by just
[1:06:45] saying no, we believe it in our heart.
[1:06:47] Because if we go back to the scripture
[1:06:49] there when when it says that Jesus was
[1:06:51] obedient to them, it says but me but but
[1:06:54] his mother treasured all these things in
[1:06:56] her heart. See, she kept she kept the
[1:06:59] message in her heart. That's good. She
[1:07:01] believed it in her heart. That's good.
[1:07:03] But we know amen that what you have in
[1:07:05] your heart, you've got to put it in your
[1:07:06] mouth. You've got to confess it. You've
[1:07:08] got to put it into action. If it just
[1:07:10] says in your heart, it's not going to
[1:07:11] materialize. Amen. The word has got to
[1:07:14] be manifested. Amen. Amen. So now Mary
[1:07:17] realizes that and she now brings the
[1:07:19] word into manifestation and from then on
[1:07:21] now we see the word made flesh walking
[1:07:23] in his ministry. Amen. Hallelujah. Then
[1:07:26] the word now can take full effect. Amen.
[1:07:31] Hallelujah. He's worthy of all praise.
[1:07:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:41] Now we know the prophet preached the
[1:07:43] message uh Christ the mystery of God
[1:07:45] revealed and we know the first part of
[1:07:48] the mystery was God was manifesting
[1:07:50] himself through Jesus Christ. He wanted
[1:07:53] to reveal himself through Jesus Christ
[1:07:55] and then he said the second fold part of
[1:07:57] the mystery was to have the preeminences
[1:08:00] in the
[1:08:01] church. Right? And we know the third
[1:08:04] fold part is to restore the kingdom.
[1:08:07] restore us back to the original
[1:08:09] condition like it was in the garden of
[1:08:10] Eden. Amen. Amen. And notice that when
[1:08:13] the first part of the mystery was
[1:08:15] complete, it had to give way for the
[1:08:18] second fold. In other words, when Jesus
[1:08:21] finished complete the mystery, the first
[1:08:22] part of the mystery, he now gave way for
[1:08:25] the church for the Holy Spirit to have
[1:08:26] the preeminences in the church. And now
[1:08:29] for years and years, we've preached,
[1:08:30] amen, that we are in the second full
[1:08:32] part of the mystery. Christ is having
[1:08:34] the preeminences in the church. Amen.
[1:08:36] But now we are transitioning into the
[1:08:38] third part of the ministry or the third
[1:08:41] part of the mystery where God is
[1:08:43] restoring us back. That's why you're
[1:08:45] here in the word. Amen. Of how Adam was.
[1:08:48] Amen. So we can be restored back to
[1:08:50] Adamike condition. Amen. That is why you
[1:08:52] seen the type of how Jesus showed us how
[1:08:55] Adam operated. Why? Because God is
[1:08:58] restoring us back to our heavenly
[1:09:00] kingdom. God is ready to transition into
[1:09:03] that third phase. the great mystery that
[1:09:05] he had in the back part of his mind.
[1:09:07] Amen. So, we got to be sure, amen, that
[1:09:09] we don't just get stuck in the second
[1:09:10] mystery, but we start to transition with
[1:09:13] God. Because when God moves, we got to
[1:09:15] move with God. Amen. When the pillar of
[1:09:17] fire move, the children of Israel had to
[1:09:18] move. Amen. So, as God is going into
[1:09:21] this third phase, now we've got to now
[1:09:23] also go into this third phase. Amen. And
[1:09:26] we've got to catch what God is doing.
[1:09:27] Praise God. And you know, we see
[1:09:32] that God in this third phase of of the
[1:09:35] mystery, right? He's restoring the
[1:09:37] kingdom.
[1:09:38] But before he can restore the kingdom
[1:09:42] and before he can restore us back to
[1:09:44] Adamic condition, he has to restore us
[1:09:47] with the right spirit. Amen. That is why
[1:09:49] we have to receive the Holy Spirit,
[1:09:51] which is the keys to the kingdom. Amen.
[1:09:53] Amen. Because we've heard, amen, that's
[1:09:55] been preached throughout the last few
[1:09:56] weeks that the original spirit that Adam
[1:09:59] has what was the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:10:02] Amen. So that is why now the Holy Spirit
[1:10:04] is so important. God has to give us the
[1:10:06] keys to the kingdom. Give us our right
[1:10:08] spirit to begin with. And when we have
[1:10:10] the right spirit to begin with, then we
[1:10:12] can be restored back to our Adamike
[1:10:14] condition. Amen. Amen. And then now we
[1:10:17] can operate as Adam operated. We can
[1:10:20] walk like Adam walked. We can speak like
[1:10:22] Adam spoke. Amen. Now the prophet says,
[1:10:26] "And if a man says he's born again and
[1:10:30] try to place these promises of Christ in
[1:10:32] the last days to some other age and make
[1:10:35] him Christ yesterday but not today, then
[1:10:38] that man or that person has been in a
[1:10:41] delusion by Satan." Amen. So in other
[1:10:44] words, if God is now trying to tell us
[1:10:47] week in and week out that amen, I am
[1:10:50] restoring you back to the original
[1:10:51] condition to be a God man on the earth
[1:10:53] again. And if you say that is a future
[1:10:55] tense, a future tense, the prophet is
[1:10:58] saying you are under delusion. Amen.
[1:11:00] Because God is saying this is a promise
[1:11:02] for this hour. The angel of the Lord is
[1:11:05] confirming that this is a promise for
[1:11:06] this hour. Amen. It's not a future
[1:11:08] tense. Amen. So we got to move with God.
[1:11:12] Amen. The prophet goes on to say, "These
[1:11:14] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:11:17] into all the world and to every age,
[1:11:19] casting out devils, speaking with
[1:11:21] tongues." Are you seeing the recurring
[1:11:23] theme about the kingdom of God? Amen.
[1:11:25] Always the supernatural casting out
[1:11:27] devils.
[1:11:29] Amen. And all these great manifestations
[1:11:32] of gifts that will follow. Now, they
[1:11:34] it's not they may be or they ought to.
[1:11:37] They will follow. Amen. and heavens and
[1:11:39] earth will pass away but his word won't.
[1:11:42] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Now, you
[1:11:45] see, we've got to believe that. We've
[1:11:46] got to believe that we are now living in
[1:11:48] the right time where God now is bringing
[1:11:50] us back to that condition. And we got to
[1:11:53] believe. Amen. The prophet says, you
[1:11:55] know, there's a quote further on where
[1:11:57] the prophet says, you might have a doubt
[1:11:59] in your heart and saying, you know,
[1:12:00] maybe it's not me or maybe I don't have
[1:12:02] it within me. He said, don't think like
[1:12:04] that. If you have the word of God living
[1:12:06] in you and you believe the word of God
[1:12:08] for your age, then you have it. Amen.
[1:12:11] Because you cannot accept this word
[1:12:13] unless the Holy Spirit reveals his word
[1:12:15] to you. Amen. And all that God has
[1:12:18] called, he's not going to lose. Amen.
[1:12:20] God said he hid it from the wise and
[1:12:22] children of this world. But revealed it
[1:12:23] unto babes such as we learn. So if it's
[1:12:26] revealed it to you, the kingdom of God
[1:12:27] is within you. There be no doubt. Amen.
[1:12:30] So amen. If the kingdom of God is within
[1:12:32] us, Amen. There should be no doubt that
[1:12:35] Amen. If the dead is placed before us,
[1:12:36] we can raise them back up again. If the
[1:12:39] sick is placed before us, amen, we can
[1:12:41] pray for the sick. Amen. How many of you
[1:12:43] believe that? How many of you believe
[1:12:45] that? Amen. If there was a condition
[1:12:46] here in the church tonight, Amen. that
[1:12:48] needed the healing hand of God and the
[1:12:50] deliverance power of God. Amen. That we
[1:12:53] could be the ones that God could turn
[1:12:54] to. Amen. Because remember in the
[1:12:56] kingdom, in Saul's kingdom, there was no
[1:12:58] one that God could turn to. But there
[1:13:00] was a David that stepped forth. There
[1:13:02] was a David all of the past experiences
[1:13:05] that could step forth and said, "Who is
[1:13:06] this Philistine?" Amen. That defies the
[1:13:08] army of the living God. Amen. And that
[1:13:11] is why from 2023, God has been giving us
[1:13:14] these experiences, building us up,
[1:13:16] building us upon our most holy faith.
[1:13:18] Amen. Increasing our faith. Amen. And
[1:13:20] that is why now we can speak. Amen. And
[1:13:22] when we speak, we believe it will come
[1:13:24] to pass. But now, Amen. We got to
[1:13:26] compare apples with apples. Amen.
[1:13:28] Because in the book of acts when the
[1:13:31] Holy Spirit the kingdom of God is poured
[1:13:33] out upon the church. Amen. We've got to
[1:13:35] compare back to that and see if we
[1:13:36] compare. Amen. If if they when they
[1:13:39] received the Holy Spirit came out with
[1:13:41] such a boldness, we've got to look
[1:13:43] within ourselves. Are we bold? Amen. Or
[1:13:45] are we afraid? Are we afraid to declare
[1:13:47] the message of the hour? Are we afraid
[1:13:49] to declare the healing power of God? Are
[1:13:51] we afraid to lay hands on the sick?
[1:13:54] Amen. I'm reminded now not so long ago.
[1:13:56] Amen. We we were at a combined service
[1:13:59] and you know maybe I'll get into trouble
[1:14:00] for saying this. We were at a combined
[1:14:02] service and here the minister falls six
[1:14:05] fall sick and he and he faints you
[1:14:07] know and here is super church super
[1:14:11] bride sitting in the audience. Amen. And
[1:14:15] the first thing that happens is they
[1:14:17] rush up the ministers to the doctors.
[1:14:19] But super church super race is sitting
[1:14:21] here in the audience. Now come and I if
[1:14:24] we are saying that we are the super
[1:14:26] church super race operating from a
[1:14:28] heavenly kingdom what power does an
[1:14:30] earthly doctor have over a super church
[1:14:34] and I can show you by the scripture that
[1:14:35] that is not scripture because when Paul
[1:14:38] was preaching one day amen there was a
[1:14:41] man that fell down dead and Paul went
[1:14:43] and he raised him up a Paul said if I
[1:14:46] the wise master build up lay the
[1:14:48] foundation take care that another man
[1:14:50] doesn't come and lay another foundation
[1:14:52] Here in the end time comes another WMBB
[1:14:55] a wise master builder William Miam
[1:14:57] Brandom and brother falls sick in the
[1:15:00] church brother way and what brother
[1:15:01] Brandon does he doesn't see a vision he
[1:15:04] doesn't hear from the Lord but he goes
[1:15:05] and says Lord give us back brother way
[1:15:07] and he raises him up Amen. So if this is
[1:15:10] the same church operating by the same
[1:15:12] spirit we got to operate in the same
[1:15:13] way. Amen. We got to compare apples with
[1:15:16] apples. Amen. We got to tell it like it
[1:15:18] is. Amen. Because if we don't, who will?
[1:15:21] Amen. There's got to come an hour when
[1:15:23] the church is not afraid. Amen. Because
[1:15:25] Saul and his army was afraid to face
[1:15:27] Goliath.
[1:15:29] Amen. But David, because of his past
[1:15:31] experiences, he could stand with
[1:15:32] boldness. Amen. That is why I said
[1:15:35] earlier on, you cannot be warm by a
[1:15:37] painted fire. That is why I said as a
[1:15:39] minister, if you come here, you've got
[1:15:41] to have your own experience. Amen.
[1:15:43] Because when the hour comes and presents
[1:15:45] itself before you and the challenge
[1:15:47] presents itself before you, what are you
[1:15:48] going to do? Amen. Amen. Because there's
[1:15:50] unbelievers looking. Amen. The the
[1:15:54] challenge is going to be put to you.
[1:15:56] Amen. And then what are you going to do?
[1:15:59] What are you going to do on the day when
[1:16:00] the rapture takes place and it's time
[1:16:02] for a body change? Are you going to call
[1:16:04] your plastic surgeon and say, "Can you
[1:16:06] just quickly fix me up and give me a
[1:16:08] body change?" What are you going to do?
[1:16:11] You're going to rely on medical science?
[1:16:14] No. We've got to rely on the
[1:16:15] supernatural hand of God. Amen. We are
[1:16:17] reigning from a supreme kingdom. Amen.
[1:16:19] We are the children of the most high
[1:16:21] God. Amen. There is no army that can
[1:16:23] defeat us. There is no demon power that
[1:16:26] can defeat us. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:29] Now, this is the kingdom that God has
[1:16:30] presented on us. It's not a kingdom that
[1:16:33] can be defeated. It's not a kingdom that
[1:16:35] can be moved. Amen. But it's the Holy
[1:16:37] Spirit now operating in human flesh
[1:16:40] bringing us back into a God man
[1:16:42] condition. Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] Amen. Amen. is not the time, amen, for
[1:16:47] message quotes and message doctrines.
[1:16:49] Amen. The time for manifestation, amen.
[1:16:52] This is the season, Amen. Not tomorrow,
[1:16:54] not a few years from now. In fact, a few
[1:16:56] years from now, the rapture will take
[1:16:58] place. But this is a season where the
[1:17:00] sons and daughters of God are
[1:17:01] manifesting in this hour. Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Hallelujah. Amen. It's a quick short
[1:17:06] work before the rapture. Amen. So, if
[1:17:08] it's a quick short work, we better hurry
[1:17:10] up. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:17:14] and let's see if we can speed up here.
[1:17:16] Amen. I got a lot of quotes, but we'll
[1:17:18] just skip through some of them.
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:26] Amen. The prophet says, "Then our
[1:17:28] headship is a kingdom. The kingdom of
[1:17:31] God is within you." Said the Bible,
[1:17:33] Jesus, the kingdom. We are not a
[1:17:35] denomination. We belong to a kingdom.
[1:17:38] You know, just just the thoughts coming
[1:17:40] back to me now went back to that
[1:17:42] incident that happened. It so happened
[1:17:44] when that incident happened at the
[1:17:47] combine, the same voice that I heard,
[1:17:49] that still small voice that spoke to me
[1:17:51] many years ago when I came to the
[1:17:53] convention and said, "This is where you
[1:17:54] need to be." Is the same voice that
[1:17:56] spoke to me that night and said, "This
[1:17:59] is why I need
[1:18:00] soldiers." And now if you might think,
[1:18:03] Norman, maybe you just thought that. But
[1:18:06] then as I walk out of this the service,
[1:18:08] I go to greet pastor Adrian and he tells
[1:18:11] me, "God bless brother. God needs
[1:18:13] soldiers. The exact same thing the
[1:18:15] spirit just told me in the service.
[1:18:17] Hallelujah. You see, so the angel of God
[1:18:19] is confirming. Amen. These are not our
[1:18:21] opinions. This is the angel of the Lord
[1:18:24] confirming. Amen.
[1:18:27] And the kingdom is the word of God made
[1:18:29] spirit and life in our own life,
[1:18:31] bringing to pass every promise in this
[1:18:33] day as it did in that day when the word
[1:18:36] and God was one. And the word and God is
[1:18:39] one in his church today. That's the
[1:18:42] kingdom. Amen. God is one with his
[1:18:44] church. Making it the headship of the
[1:18:46] body that is redeemed to bring the
[1:18:48] message in the last day. Amen. Now
[1:18:51] notice we are in the shout, right? Yes.
[1:18:53] And the shout gathers the living saints.
[1:18:56] But we know that the shout releases the
[1:18:58] Holy Spirit upon the age. Because down
[1:19:02] through the ages, the the the word of
[1:19:04] God was lost. The Holy Spirit takes his
[1:19:07] flight. Amen. But there come a
[1:19:08] restoration. Amen. justification,
[1:19:10] sanctification, and the restoration of
[1:19:12] the gifts. But now the shout releases
[1:19:14] the genuine Holy Spirit, Amen, onto the
[1:19:17] age, unto the people of God. Amen. And
[1:19:19] when this happens, Amen. The shout, we
[1:19:22] heard a few weeks ago, the shout brings
[1:19:24] you into the door and the door is shut.
[1:19:26] Amen. Now, what is that door? It's
[1:19:28] bringing you into a kingdom. Yes. Amen.
[1:19:31] Now, think about Esther. Now, there were
[1:19:33] many candidates, but Esther was chosen
[1:19:35] to be married to the king. And when that
[1:19:37] happened, she was called into the
[1:19:39] palace. Yes. Amen. And when she was
[1:19:41] called into this now, a new kingdom, she
[1:19:44] was ruling and reigning in a new
[1:19:46] kingdom. She may not have realized the
[1:19:48] full effect of what she had, but she was
[1:19:51] marching around as queen in this new
[1:19:53] kingdom. But there come a time when she
[1:19:55] realized what a true effect was, what a
[1:19:57] true power was, what an inheritance was.
[1:20:01] But she always had it. Amen. So the shot
[1:20:04] brings us into this new kingdom by
[1:20:06] releasing the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:20:10] Now we see the promise being fulfilled.
[1:20:13] Amen. Christ the true headship going in
[1:20:16] coming in his bride doing the same works
[1:20:18] that he did at the beginning. Amen. And
[1:20:21] making ready and fulfilling his word as
[1:20:23] he did. John 14:12. He that believeth on
[1:20:26] me, the works that I do shall ye do
[1:20:28] also. Amen. Then the head and the body
[1:20:31] are becoming one in works and in sign
[1:20:34] and in life. You see, you got to be one
[1:20:37] in works and in sign and in life.
[1:20:41] Vindicated by God himself through his
[1:20:43] promised word for the last days. Amen.
[1:20:47] And the prophet says if you are
[1:20:48] spiritual, you'll catch it. Now, I like
[1:20:51] what the prophet says here, we have
[1:20:53] Satan's answer. Yes. Amen. God has
[1:20:57] vindicated himself. God has proved
[1:20:59] himself to his promise in this day. The
[1:21:02] headship is here. Christ the risen Lord
[1:21:05] is here in the same power of his
[1:21:07] resurrection that he was manifesting
[1:21:09] himself. There's the devil's answer.
[1:21:12] That's the reason when this man sitting
[1:21:14] here now we just spoke just now about
[1:21:15] brother way. Right? Here's the prophet
[1:21:18] confirming it again. That's the reason
[1:21:20] when this man sitting here dropped dead
[1:21:22] the other day. sitting here we could say
[1:21:24] come back to life cuz the Holy Spirit
[1:21:27] said so that's why it could do it to
[1:21:30] that little baby back yonder in Mexico
[1:21:33] you see the headship and the body has
[1:21:35] become one unit
[1:21:37] you see we have the devil's answer now
[1:21:40] even if the devil throws death at us we
[1:21:42] have the answer that is why Paul could
[1:21:44] say oh death where is your sting oh
[1:21:47] grave where is your victory you've got
[1:21:49] to have the devil's answer in this hour
[1:21:51] if not you are not fully in the message
[1:21:53] of the hour because the message comes to
[1:21:55] give us the answer. Amen. Amen. Thank
[1:21:58] you, Lord.
[1:22:01] Amen. We see the condition of the
[1:22:02] people. We see the condition of
[1:22:04] politics. We see the condition of the
[1:22:07] world. It can't stand. It's got to sink
[1:22:09] like the Titanic. It must go down. For
[1:22:13] theirs give room, one nation gives room
[1:22:16] to another as it falls. And this
[1:22:18] kingdom, this earthly kingdom must fall
[1:22:22] to give room for our kingdom. Amen. That
[1:22:25] is why the kingdoms are falling. Because
[1:22:27] it's giving room for a new kingdom
[1:22:29] that's ushering in. Amen. Because Christ
[1:22:32] is coming to rule and reign with his
[1:22:34] queen. Amen. That is why the nations of
[1:22:36] the earth are falling. Because a new
[1:22:38] kingdom is coming. Now notice what he
[1:22:41] says here. For we receive a kingdom that
[1:22:44] cannot be moved through. How? How do we
[1:22:46] receive this? Through this perfect image
[1:22:49] of God, the masterpiece, the perfect
[1:22:52] image, the God man. Amen. So here's now
[1:22:55] the kingdom. Now the God man. Look how
[1:22:57] he brings it back to the God man, back
[1:22:59] to Adamic condition. The perfect image,
[1:23:02] the God man, God in Morphe had changed
[1:23:05] from supernatural to vision. And the
[1:23:07] vision was projected into the image. And
[1:23:10] the image was smitten so that the
[1:23:12] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[1:23:14] death. God's perfect masterpiece. Amen.
[1:23:17] And now we know in the end time, God is
[1:23:19] now being vindicated again through the
[1:23:21] God man. Amen. You and I. Thank you,
[1:23:24] Lord. Amen. We're almost done.
[1:23:33] Amen. And the prophet says, "We receive
[1:23:35] a kingdom that cannot be moved." How did
[1:23:38] we get into it? Not by a religious
[1:23:39] system, but a kingdom of God is within
[1:23:42] you. The kingdom, the king and his word
[1:23:44] is the same and it's within you.
[1:23:46] Vindicating the hour we're now living in
[1:23:49] the promise that God made for this age.
[1:23:51] Here we are living with the king,
[1:23:53] sitting in heavenly places watching him
[1:23:56] do these things. Hallelujah. So it's not
[1:23:59] us that's doing it. Hallelujah. It's God
[1:24:01] doing it through us and we are just
[1:24:02] standing by and watching. That is why
[1:24:04] the prophet said it wasn't I that
[1:24:06] appeared at the river. Amen. I was just
[1:24:08] standing there. It wasn't I that
[1:24:10] discerned the hearts of the people. I
[1:24:12] was just standing there. The angel of
[1:24:14] the Lord used my mouth. Amen. So, here
[1:24:16] we are. Amen. Just yielding ourselves to
[1:24:19] the Holy Spirit. That the kingdom of God
[1:24:21] can be unveiled to us, expressed to us
[1:24:24] as God made, sons and daughters of God
[1:24:26] on the earth again. Amen. And do we have
[1:24:28] the answer to the devil's question?
[1:24:31] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand to our
[1:24:32] feet. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:36] Amen. We receive a kingdom that cannot
[1:24:38] be moved. Amen. Hallelujah. I pray that.
[1:24:41] Amen. has encouraged you. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:44] Don't let any doubt creep up in you
[1:24:45] because remember Satan is the master of
[1:24:47] doubts. That's his job is to create
[1:24:49] doubt because he can't touch your life.
[1:24:52] So the only thing he can do is create
[1:24:54] doubt. That is why the prophet said the
[1:24:56] greatest battlefield is in our minds.
[1:24:57] Amen. Amen. And that is why the prophet
[1:25:00] also said if she gets a true revelation
[1:25:02] of who she is, she'll be a super church,
[1:25:04] a super race. Amen. So, hallelujah. We
[1:25:07] are victorious in Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah. Amen. Even as we call our
[1:25:12] pastor forward, let's just sing a song.
[1:25:15] Amen. Let's sing. Victory is mine. Amen.
[1:25:18] Because we have the victory. Amen. We
[1:25:20] are victorious church.
[1:25:22] Amen. Oh, victory is
[1:25:26] mine. Victory is
[1:25:30] mine. Victory today.
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:38] I chose
[1:25:41] Satan. Get thee
[1:25:43] be. Make the day is mine. Sing the Holy
[1:25:50] Ghost. The Holy Ghost is
[1:25:53] mine. The Holy Ghost is
[1:25:57] mine. The Holy Ghost
[1:26:00] today is mine.
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:05] Well, I told
[1:26:07] Satan to get me
[1:26:10] behind. The Holy Ghost today is
[1:26:16] mine. Jesus is mine. Jesus is
[1:26:21] mine. Jesus, for I am my beloved and he
[1:26:25] is mine.
[1:26:27] Jesus, it is mine.
[1:26:32] And I told
[1:26:34] Satan, get thee behind
[1:26:38] me. Jesus, today is mine. Amen. Let's
[1:26:44] give the Lord a good hand of praise.
[1:26:46] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that you're
[1:26:48] part of the kingdom? Amen. How do we get
[1:26:51] into the kingdom? Amen. The body by one
[1:26:54] spirit. We all baptized into the
[1:26:58] kingdom. Amen. Hallelujah. And what a
[1:27:01] privileged people we are. We have the
[1:27:03] revelation of the name to be baptized
[1:27:05] in. There are millions and millions and
[1:27:08] millions of people being baptized in the
[1:27:10] titles father, son, and holy ghost. But
[1:27:13] the Lord has revealed it to us. Amen.
[1:27:15] The name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:27:18] If we are buried with him, we shall also
[1:27:20] be resurrected with him. Amen. Amen. So,
[1:27:23] we are sons and daughters of the most
[1:27:25] high God. Let's sing and worship him.
[1:27:26] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing. Amen.
[1:27:30] Uh, praise the
[1:27:32] Lord. Hallelujah. I want to sing Ancient
[1:27:35] of Days, but I'm wondering maybe D
[1:27:39] tonight might be too high. Let's sing it
[1:27:41] from C. You know it from C. Let's sing
[1:27:43] it. Amen. Your kingom shall rain over

[1:28:30] every
[1:28:31] tongue. Oh, every tongue in heaven and
[1:28:35] earth shall declare your glory. Every
[1:28:38] knee shall bow at your throne. In
[1:28:43] worship you will be exalted, oh
[1:28:47] God, and your kingdom shall not pass
[1:28:52] away. Oh ancient of
[1:28:55] days. One more time. Your kingdom shall
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:28:59] reign. Your kingom shall reign over all
[1:29:04] the
[1:29:05] earth. We sing unto the ancient dark
[1:29:09] days.
[1:29:12] And man can compare.

[1:29:21] Every
[1:29:23] tongue, every tongue in heaven and earth

[1:30:00] when he he went beyond the curtain of
[1:30:02] time and the voice as he was leaving
[1:30:05] says keep pressing on. Keep pressing on.
[1:30:09] Amen. Hallelujah. Even when he saw the
[1:30:11] preview of the bride. Amen. He wanted
[1:30:14] the bride to keep marching forward. And
[1:30:16] he told us stay in line. Don't deviate
[1:30:18] from the left or the right. Don't get
[1:30:20] out of the kingdom of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:22] The kingdom of God is our protection.
[1:30:25] Amen. The kingdom of God is our life.
[1:30:28] Amen. The kingdom of God is what makes
[1:30:30] us successful. Hallelujah. Without the

[1:30:51] Father. I want another portion. Oh, God.
[1:30:56] Amen.
[1:30:57] Don't be satisfied with what you have.
[1:31:00] Amen. The moment we are content and
[1:31:02] satisfied, we can't grow. Praise the
[1:31:04] Lord. I'll give you an example. If
[1:31:06] somebody is satisfied, if they're a
[1:31:09] musician and they're satisfied with just
[1:31:11] playing a basic three
[1:31:14] chords, that's all they'll play the rest
[1:31:17] of their lives. But they if somebody is
[1:31:20] never satisfied and wants to learn and
[1:31:21] grow in the kingdom of God, that puts a
[1:31:24] yearning inside of him. Amen.
[1:31:26] Hallelujah. I'm saying if we can use
[1:31:29] that same principle for the things of
[1:31:30] God. Amen. I The prophet of God said it
[1:31:34] like this. He says, "I'm not satisfied
[1:31:37] with how much I have now." He says, "How
[1:31:38] much he wants to pour in me, that's how
[1:31:40] much I want." So more of your spirit,
[1:31:43] Lord. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:31:47] Jesus.
[1:31:49] Amen. Let's sing more and more.
[1:31:54] [Music]

[1:32:35] Jesus. Yes. More and more and more and
[1:32:39] more of
[1:32:43] Jesus and less and less of me.
[1:32:48] Less and lesser. One more time. For more
[1:32:52] and more and more and more of
[1:32:58] Jesus. More and more and more and more
[1:33:02] of
[1:33:05] Jesus and less and less of
[1:33:09] me. Less and less of
[1:33:13] me. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. With your
[1:33:16] heads bowed, your eyes
[1:33:18] closed.
[1:33:22] Amen. Just hold your altar in your heart
[1:33:24] to the Lord and say, "Father, you know
[1:33:25] what I have need of. You know the areas
[1:33:28] I'm restricting you, oh God. Father,
[1:33:30] right now I'm breaking down those walls,
[1:33:31] these barriers, and I'm allowing the
[1:33:33] Holy Spirit to have access into these
[1:33:35] areas, oh God." Amen. Even freedom in
[1:33:37] the spirit. Amen. Some people are so
[1:33:39] bound. Amen. They can't rejoice over the
[1:33:41] things of God, over the word of God.
[1:33:43] Amen. So say Lord break down every
[1:33:45] barrier. Break down every obstacle oh
[1:33:47] God. Oh father Lord quicken that seed
[1:33:50] gene within my soul oh God that father

[1:34:06] of the Holy Spirit upon my life right
[1:34:08] now. Oh God. Every head bowed and every
[1:34:10] eyes closed. Amen. If you are trusting
[1:34:12] the Lord, maybe all of you are not doing
[1:34:14] it right now. Amen. Because maybe some
[1:34:16] of you don't want to break through in
[1:34:17] the spirit realm. Amen. You are
[1:34:19] restricting the spirit of God. But those
[1:34:21] of you that are sincere tonight, Amen.
[1:34:23] that wants to experience the move of God
[1:34:25] in your life. You want more of the Holy
[1:34:27] Ghost. Amen. Not just a religious
[1:34:29] theory. Amen. But you want to see the
[1:34:31] supernatural power of God. Amen. Just
[1:34:34] breakthrough. Amen. You in your heart
[1:34:36] right now. Start to talk to the Lord.
[1:34:37] Amen. That's how you receive the Holy
[1:34:39] Ghost. Not me. Amen. But you out of a
[1:34:42] desire in your hearts. Amen. Saying Lord
[1:34:45] more of you Lord Jesus. Lord even as I
[1:34:47] come before you Lord I'm asking Lord for
[1:34:49] a greater measure greater outpouring
[1:34:51] Lord Jesus. Even as Lord your prophet
[1:34:53] had taught us Lord that the dynamics of
