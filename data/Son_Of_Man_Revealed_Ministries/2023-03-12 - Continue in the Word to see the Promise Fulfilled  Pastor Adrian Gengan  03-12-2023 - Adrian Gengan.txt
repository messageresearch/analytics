hope you got nobody else to turn to Jesus is available amen amen Jesus was on Earth at that time and the woman knew that she could get to Jesus amen if she could just touch the am of His Garment amen so praise the Lord we'll turn to our scripture reading this morning amen let's start reading in ook amen ook chapter 2 and verse two and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables amen amen is everybody in here yet amen I don't want anyone to miss the message so whoever needs to come into the service please come in amen we come to church we must be in the church amen we don't have overflow yet amen hallelujah the only overflow is for the mothers and the children praise the Lord what does the Bible say and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables yes that he may run that reth it oh yes so it mustn't be written in a mysterious form it must be written in simple language so the one that's reading it can run with a vision amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it amen amen wait for it because it will surely come amen yes it will not car amen praise the Lord so notice the emphasis there on those words amen praise the Lord and then our many portion of scripture we're going to read is John 8:31 amen praise the Lord John 8:31 then Jesus said to those Jews who believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen you may be seated to the Lord at blessing to the reading of his word you leave that scripture up there amen hallelujah let's go back to that verse 31 amen i' like to speak on continue in patience amen continue in patience to see the Promise come to pass amen amen amen hallelujah then Jesus said to those Jews who believed on him so this message is coming just to Believers don't miss the details of this verse now Jesus is talking to Believers he's not talking to the scribes and the Pharisees and everybody else Jesus talking to the Jews who believed on him and he's telling them if you continue in my in my what word in my word then I hear my disciples indeed amen amen so we got to ask ourselves are we continuing in the word amen when we are facing how are we let me ask you a question like this how are you facing your daily trials your battles your situations in life how are you overcoming it amen how are you overcoming your trials how are are you navigating through your stress and all of these things that come upon us amen the key is the word of God Amen and Jesus Is Telling those that believe on him are we the ones that believe on Jesus amen he says if you continue in my word amen amen meaning you must have patience to continue amen continue in my word then I he my disciples what is a disciple a follower of Christ the one that wants to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ another word is a devote a one who is devoted to the Lord Jesus Christ if you continue in my word yes notice he's not saying if you just come to church amen he's not saying if you only do a particular thing he instruction is specific if you continue in my word then I am my disciples indeed so how is our study of scripture is it just casual is it just like uh whatever verse pops up today I will read that or is our study of the word intentional because the word can liberate us from every situation amen the word is key and it's the answer to all our problems amen amen amen now we just read abuk 2:2 it's telling you though it car wait for it amen it must come to pass now we can't be wavering in our faith we must be consistent in our faith when is it we were speaking about having a rod VI Faith a rod Vier when it locks its jaw you can't open it you can hit it on its head or do anything once it grips it will not release it will not open up its mouth let your faith be like that amen don't be despondent when you see things not coming to pass amen when you see things not working out according to your timeline God wants to work amen Faith work with patience amen amen God is testing if you really believe him or you just want to see the reward of what you want oh I'll continue in the word until I get my healing and then I'll forget about the word I'll continue in the word until I get the desire of my heart then I'll forget about the word you know it's human nature that way we start something for a while and then we back off today we wake up hey right I'm ready to lose weight I got my exercise program I got my diet program give it a week give it two weeks give it 3 weeks and then what happens we forget about it then we goone on back to the whole slam amen but if you continue say you were continuing and you had a goal that you were going to lose a certain amount of weight if you had continued in patience and applied the diet and applied the exercise program would you see the results so if we can apply these things in the natural if somebody is studying something maybe the degree is three or four years if they continue in patience if they continue and and and dedicate themselves to study will they see the result at the end of the four years they will certainly see the result so if in the natural we can be persistent to achieve Natural Things how much more should we in the spiritual be persistent to achieve spiritual things amen sometimes I feel like we are more committed to physical things and we put so much of time and effort and energy into physical things amen and what we want to achieve physically and less spiritually amen so sometimes you got to ask yourself what is the matter with man why is he so casual when it comes to serving God Amen Hallelujah John 177 says this if you want to know what is truth now because Jesus had told him you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free in John 17:17 Jesus is telling them sanctify them through the truth Thy word is truth amen so if you're going to continue in the word like what Jesus is saying he means you must continue in truth now a truth can be a partial Truth for a certain amount of time but then when God is moving on to further the truth you got to move with truth Luther's light was truth but there was a continuation we can't say we are remaining in truth with Luther's light we needed to progress to Wesley's light sanctification then we needed to progress to the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and now we have coming into the formed word image of the Son of God amen amen now the word is coming to full fruition in our lives yes amen you say what are you talking about simplify it for me when I see you when I see my brother and when I see my sister I must see Jesus on display I must see the life of Jesus on display amen yes Lord yes Lord amen hallelujah Jesus thought it not robbery to be equal with God why was possible because all that was in God according to Christ yes the end no yes so if Jesus thoughted not robbery to be equal with God because all that was in God he pour into Christ now all that was in Christ he pour into the church now can you come into your position and say you thought it not robbery to be equal with Christ amen we are HS of the father joint with the son amen amen amen hallelujah let's go to Hebrews 6 And1 12 we'll lay the scriptures amen and then we'll continue in our sermon Hebrews 6:12 says that you be not slothful amen don't be slothful when it comes to the things of God but followers of them who through faith and patience s what they do through faith and what patience patience yeah but I gave the Lord a timeline I told him it's got to be now amen God is Not serving us in our kingdom we are serving God in his kingdom and the reason why he's got you in this holding period of maybe 25 years maybe 20 years in this wait 430 years in this waiting period is for what because he wrote the vision and according to his word you see Malachi 4: 5 and 6 behold I sent you Elijah the prophet was laying in scripture the vision was written but until the appointed time we had to wait for it yes it couldn't have been in 1900 19001 19002 no but in 196 yes amen was the Fulfillment of that Vision amen amen God had to have a man on the earth praise the Lord so we through faith and patience inherit the promise amen why I'm telling you that amen because you have worked your faith up to a level where you can believe God for all things to be possible but then you don't have the patience to wait and then what happens when the person is not in p patience his faith wavers and he loses out on the promise of God abuk 2 says though it t wait for it amen the beginning of the year we ask so many of you to write things down some of you may have written amen some of you may have written it on your mind amen and that's where it will remain Hallelujah because God had thoughts and as long as it remain thoughts nothing happened on the Earth God had to take the thoughts and speak it amen that's the law on the earth amen hallelujah now James 1: 2 and 3 says this my brethren count it all joy now you say but I'm going through a trial I'm going through patience I'm going through sickness I'm going through tribulation you saying I must count it all joy knowing this that the trying of your faith work patience amen because when faith is built up to a level you can get excited in the service you can say okay I'm speaking I'm speaking I'm speaking you spoke the word it went forth but remember the word will not return void it's going to come back to you how is it coming back in multiplication we are in the kingdom of God and we serve God by multiplication amen so the king the word is coming back pressed down shaken together running over so the trying of your faith worketh patience I don't like patience people don't like patience you know why we live in a society where everything is instant everything is instant amen you know back in the day you could tell somebody you know what we need to buy this and we're going to save towards it now that takes patience now people don't want to wait and save what they do Quick Fix they go take a loan that they can't pay and they put themselves in debt amen hallelujah Wednesday we were speaking about Elisha the one who can raise all debts amen if you missed the sermon too bad those of you that were here you know what I'm talking about amen amen hallelujah you know how to handle your problem problems you know how to speak about it amen hallelujah praise the Lord and I Don't Preach things for a sermon so I don't expect you to continue paying that thing over the next 20 30 years Elisha the Razer of bondsman is here amen amen hallelujah so you need to confess that with your mouth amen and how is he doing it the Lord is giving in wisdom through his hands amen so the Lord is going to bless you and multiply you in order for you to get out of that yes amen praise the Lord amen what is Joy the Bible says there go to the first verse there verse two count it all joy how many of you know what Joy is what is Joy be happy joy don't say your auntie what is joy Jo joy of the Lord is my strength anybody else know what Joy is some of you don't know what Joy is say the last time I felt Joy is when I was born anybody know what Joy is what is the true meaning of joy amen how can we be joyful the true meaning of joy is knowing the end result if you know the end result you can be joyful amen did God reveal to us the end result yes of Our Lives of our journey on the earth amen amen so that is the true meaning of joy is knowing the end result amen you'll find it here in Hebrews 12:2 amen look at the one who is the beginner and who is the finisher the one who altered your life let me speak to every one of you here you are not here on the Earth by chance you didn't come out of here by what they call it these unbelievers what did they say how how creation started evu Evolution Evolution they believe Evolution you know when you're going to realize evolution is wrong when you end up in hell you're going to evolve to hell looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our what I thought it was my faith I thought it's my faith who Ed your faith he's the author and he The Finisher so the one who started a good work in you is able to finish it amen amen but can you continue in the word in patience amen amen amen we don't we are we are running a race and we don't have much time because we must run with all the strength that we have amen amen hallelujah we must finish strong yes we are at the Finish Line amen I don't know if you're hearing me I'm telling you we're at the finish line for the ending of the Gentile [Music] dispensation but the one who altered our faith is the one that here here to see us through to finish it amen amen who for the joy see now Joy is knowing the end result the joy that was set before him he knew that if he goes to the Cross he'll receive us his trophies so that's the joy knowing the end result the joy that he set before him endured the cross for brother rames who was set before Jesus endured the cross amen Hallelujah brother Jaden was set before Jesus so Jesus endured the cross so that he can experience the joy of fellowship and restoration with you come on give God praise amen hallelujah amen we ought to be excited about our Salvation amen we are to be excited that Jesus Christ came and died for us amen and restored us back to our original condition amen amen hallelujah amen we going to have some Joy about it am amen we can't have an attitude over Jesus that me so what thank amen every day we ought to be rejoicing I thank you Lord that you saved me oh God I thank you Lord that by your grace I am saved oh God I thank you for the faith oh God which you Ed in my life oh God I know father God that I must continue in faith oh God and you started this faith in me you will alter this faith in me you will finish the faith in me oh God I'm not wavering yes a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways yes you know what you're going to get if you keep relying on your own strength you know when your strength is gone you're going to be a miserable old person without salvation without Jesus Christ you say how do I know if I'm saved do you ever have thoughts of Jesus you ever have thoughts of his word yes thank you I'm rejoicing night and day as as I walk this narrow way yes you know what the school of the prophets told Elisha uh this way is too narrow this place that you're going is too straight yes so we want to go build another place they can't walk with you amen don't end up a miserable person have the joy of the Lord amen amen have the joy of the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus amen and I want you to be able to speak that in the life of your partner in the life of your children if they are miserable amen depressed people amen say I thank you Lord that my husband is joyful I thank you Lord that my wife is joyful I thank you Lord they are filled with the holy spirit amen if you can have faith for healing you can have faith for all things amen thank you you don't have to live with this person that you call a neag bag you you can change it with your words you can change it by the life you are living amen you can speak what you want I thank you Lord that my my wife is not negative I thank you Lord that my child is not negative I thank you Lord that my husband is not negative I thank you Lord father that he's a man full of Faith amen I

patience you shall see the result amen amen hallelujah amen some people thinking this is a amen hallelujah I I'll just serve the Lord for all the blessings amen I amen I want The Giver of the blessings I want the the Holy Ghost the person of the Holy Ghost himself Amen Hallelujah Lord praise the Lord how many if you feel that way amen hallelujah don't be rejoicing night and day and live your miserable way amen hallelujah oh all I care about is my you know as long as I got my jeans and my Takis I'm happy as long as I have my cell phone as long as I got my laptop these things give me cheap thrills you're looking for the blesser you know who looks for blessers these fast women they looking for older men who got money who can bless them they call them blessers amen hallelujah now it's more important for you to bless Jesus than for him to bless you I will bless thee oh Lord I Will Bless thee Lord why must I bless you you're so blessed I Will Bless thee Oh Lord amen hallelujah you know you're asking God the wrong way if you read Ephesians the Bible says we are blessed with all spiritual blessings you going there and saying Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord you know what you are saying I don't know who I am that's why your prayers are not answered you are going before God and because you are praying in ignorance you are praying bless me Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord the Lord says I can only bless you if you know who you are and what the word says about you Hallelujah so you approach God and say I thank you Lord that I'm already blessed I thank you Lord that all my needs are met I thank you lordes amen don't you see we need to change our ways change our thinking amen hallelujah the way out of your problem is not you going to your brother pray for me pray for me pray for me you feel spiritual when you tell everyone pray for me yeah when you say pray for me pray for me when brother Brandon was dealing with Billy Paul why did he told him I didn't do the sinning you did the sinning who must pray you pray but you think you'll know me last I spoke to him his when I nearly fall on and I said Jesus hey last I spoke to him was when the dog was chasing me and I saying oh you're God that's the last time I spoke to Jesus amen is this is not just for the old people young people children do you pray yes or you shy amen you should not be shy for Jesus amen amen children ought to be on fire for God young people ought to be on fire for God amen amen we ought to be able to say hi Hallelujah we ought to be able to say praise the Lord because of what he has done for me amen so we are people who walk by faith I many if you can agree with that amen so the safest place that you and I can walk right now is to walk according to the purpose of God Amen nothing can touch you if you're fulfilling God's purpose amen so we must be focused on his purpose amen driven by his purpose our whole life must be centered around Christ and what he wants to do through us with his word Christ centered lives remember to sing the song later Jesus at the center when we closing right remember if I forget Jesus at the center of it all Jesus in the far right of it all I'll push you to the left when I have all that I need Jesus amen hallelujah I know nobody's nobody is living that way here all of us live Christ centered lives all of us are totally dedicated to the word all of us are committed to the study of the word so this is going to the internet people amen so just bear with me amen amen just bear with me because give yourself a nice tap there see Brother Sam is doing it too I say Well done boy for conforming to everything amen hallelujah praise the lord we must live Christ cented lives amen so we find here this is what I'm trying to get to you God asked Noah to build an ark and to preach repentance before the destruction of the Earth was going to come by what water amen and even though he had never seen rain before year after year amen there was no rain he built the ark and still there was no rain God didn't tell tell him when it was going to rain he never set any time limit yes he just said it's going to rain so what did Noah have to do continue in the word by faith through patience Noah had to continue in the word Noah had to stay focused and faithful to the purpose for which God had called him amen Noah knew that he was going to see it in his generation amen hallelujah and Noah was ready to go into the H anytime God said go into the H how are we living Our Lives amen and after 120 years it rained amen can we remain patient amen can we wait for the promise to be fulfilled amen yes amen some of us need to develop patience you tell your mother you're hungry the your mother tells you the food will be ready in 1 hour you say you want me to die I'm starving no patience amen hallelujah sometimes this is not fictional this is fictional what I'm telling you the wife will tell you do this it's a fiction story right and you don't do it immediately leave it I'll do it myself this a fictional story I forgot the name of the book but some of you know what I'm talking about or the other way wife husband will say make my tea where years I spent in Van amen what happened we need to continue in patience am amen so we've got to remain patient and wait for the promise to be fulfilled now when the tea don't come in an hour's time are you going to blow your top off even when they bring the tea now you sulking okay when I ask you for the tea now you bringing the tea I was busy changing the baby's nappes now amen so we must remain I'm I'm trying to get through this year here what the prophet says we got to wait patient right in this first quote here in the trial 107 he says he never said as soon as you lay hands on the sick they're going to jump up and run around the floor like the skeptic wants to make you think he said they shall recover amen he never said when they will he said the prayer of faith shall save the sick in James 5 ver14 God shall raise him up when he didn't say he just said he would amen amen yeah in 109 he says Mark 16 he said so the prophet is really one quoting Mark 11:23 how do we know it we should know the scripture of bahad right but he's saying he said say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said will come to pass he didn't say when he said it would yes Hallelujah so what you need to do when you speak that word and you speak to the mountain you need to go rejoicing you need to have joy because you know the end result what's the end result the mountain has moved so I'm rejoicing night and day amen thanking God thanking God hallelujah amen I was once blind can now see amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah you get people who are Skeptics tell you let me see you make this man walk amen he's been in a wheelchair long time amen he said he's got faith you see the the prophet says that's the devil skeptic coming Jesus never said amen they jump up right away he says amen that's what people want an instant amen he said amen if they believe they would get well they shall recover it depends what prayer you're praying if you're applying Mark 16 you will see Mark 16 results if you're applying Mark 11:23 you'll see Mark 11:23 results if you're applying Mark 9 23 you'll see Mark 9:23 results amen praise the Lord you know what happens we've been explaining to this to you through the months there's spiritual warfare going on yes and Rafa can't always get to you if you if you only knew the Angelic world and now it operates amen because sometimes you know you know God is omnipresent amen but he can only be at one place at one time and how does he how is he omnipresent through his omnicient because he knows all things amen hallelujah but God is a physical being he can be at one place at one time amen hallelujah so say for now for example now you are sitting here and you got afraid to believe God for something right now yes you're saying Lord I believe you I receive it right now I receive it now he's going to connect with your faith but maybe Gyra what I'm saying there are seven compound names is Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Shalom there's so many people amen that are praying to God Amen and God sends his angels as ministering Spirits now you can receive this or not yes amen but that's how the angel of the Lord came into the prophet's meeting amen so the angel why would he why couldn't he just pray before the angel came why would he say you know I'm waiting for somebody yes amen praise the Lord amen what am I trying to tell you why didn't Daniel receive his promise immediately there was a spiritual warfare going on these angels are caught up in Warfare and the prayer sometimes may not be answered immediately but maybe they'll come the next day or two yes yes and coming to see if you are still continuing in faith oh yes Lord amen continuing in patience continuing in the what w r d yes continuing in the word oh thank amen imagine when the angel comes 2 days later and there you busy with your own thing gone back to your old ways your faith was only between 10 and 12 on a Sunday morning 5 12 you saying goodbye friend I stay no longer with you goodbye patience you'll see 5+ 12 on the way home you'll see how many people being patients or not hey you didn't even press the push button put the air corn on you didn't start the car yet now you're following speed distance I mean they're saying they're angry patience continue in patience why I'm saying these things you can't suddenly have patience in one aspect of your life and be impatient the rest of your aspects patience is a thing that's developed amen last week we were talking about character the prophet says the only thing you will take to Heaven is your character right amen amen and we were showing you how the word is molding your character so if the word which is an eternal word molds your character into the image of Christ then your character which is able to live on this Earth is the same character that can live in that Earth in that heaven that's why you don't change your character but you must come into the character of Jesus amen hallelujah praise the Lord so amen you think of Abraham we've been through Noah you think of Abraham God told him he was going to have a son through his wife Sarah she was 65 at that time Abraham was 75 they had no sign of children or whom was dead amen after 28 days came nothing happened to Sarah they laughed and made fun of Abraham amen the first year came they laughed and made fun of him they asked him how many children you got now you told us the Lord told you you're going to have a son how many children you got now but the Bible says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God Amen but was strong in faith now remember from 75 to 100 was his body getting weaker or stronger come on now physically was his body getting weaker or stronger his body was getting strong weaker but what was getting stronger his faith was getting stronger so year after year his faith grew stronger all the time because he believed that God was able to keep his word and he was focused on God's purpose so one day amen hallelujah while he's sitting there and he's maybe talking to Sarah because she's in the tent behind him the angel of the Lord comes to him amen 25 years pass he's old he's stoop shouldered Sarah could hardly get around herself amen Sarah was 90 years old but as soon as they met the angel of the Lord the prophet of God says the very next day his shoulders started to straighten out he no longer was walking as a unpack man his shoulders started to straighten out amen the Bible the prophet tells us that his air started to go back to black you can see I'm having a body change slowly amen Sarah's cheeks became red Sarah started to look young again beautiful again amen hallelujah praise the Lord and they started to turn back to a young man and woman again amen now the prophet says that God hides his messages in between the lines because you can't go to a seminary school to learn that Abraham and Sarah turned back young again that's right that's right it's only this Prophet that told us that oh yes right so hear what he says he says my wife this is now in Amen in the paragraph the 120 my wife when she writes writes me a letter I can read between the lines I know what she's talking about cuz I love her I know her nature I know what she means she's writing I'm sitting here tonight Billy the children are in bed I'm thinking of you I know what she's meaning cuz I love her you see then he says if you in love with God and God's spirit is in you the Holy Spirit himself is The Interpreter of this word amen amen so he's laying this now to show us the hidden Mystery between this so he says in order to get that baby a whom was dead a Liv stream was dead he would have to make a mother another home yes he gave Sarah another home amen what would he have to do you see they didn't have any bottles they stick in the baby's mouth so the mother can run around everywhere them days it had to be a wet mother meaning a breastfeeding mother right so in order to do that the milk veins was dried up so he would have to make new milk veins yes to feed the baby and another thing a woman under years old going into labor what you would have to give her he would have to give her a new heart oh yes Lord amen amen see he didn't just Patch It Up hallelujah our god don't believe in patch jobs when he healed he really healed amen ask brother Joshua when he heals he really heals oh yes thank you Lord amen amen hallelujah so but after 25 years the baby com in on the scene it happened God didn't say you're going to have the baby next week by Sarah he never designated any time he said he would have a baby by Sarah he never said when he just said he would he showed in him what he's going to do to all Abraham seed they'll turn back a new get a new body for to receive that coming son that we're looking for I still believe the promise you say that's radical said he didn't say when he would do it but he said he would do it so God did not say when he would answer you he wants you to believe the answer is on the way now sometimes can God can use cruel situations to bring his purpose to pass God can take you to trials to bring his purpose to pass amen look at what happened to Joseph like we all know what the end result is right that's our joy that we are going to be seated with Jesus on his throne because we are Overcomers of this day I don't know about you but I already overcame this age am amen amen now Joseph why was his faith not wavering why did he continue in patient because he believed the dream am the dream saw him that his father and his brothers were bowing down before him so when he was in the pit and he didn't see his father and brothers bowing down before him he continued in patience yes contined having faith because he knew the dream must come to pass amen then they took him and put him in P's house and he was a servant there amen he became a servant so from a slave he became a servant but even in that situation his father and brothers did not bow to him in part of his house so he knew there was a further work and he was working in God's purpose so he continued in faith they threw him in prison but he knew that his father and his brothers do not bow to him they in prison so he knew the vision was yet for an appointed time amen so he had to wait for it so he continued in patience amen I got a point why I'm telling you all of this it's only when he was taken to the highest level of the king's Palace that his father and his brothers came to him then he knew he could say this day amen this dream is fulfilled amen yes you see some of us are wavering in faith some of us are wavering in our journey but I'm asking you have you received a new body yet then why you wavering yeah that's the end result we need to continue amen oh yes we're going to have a new body we're going to the marriage supper of the Lamb stop living like you've already achieved it this is not the Millennium this is not amen the restoration of all things where Christ has now restored Eden on the earth come on now amen we must continue in faith amen we must strive if we want to attain amen so God can use cruel take us to cruel trials cruel testing you wonder why this things have to happen the Bible says in Daniel 2:21 he changed the times and Seasons he removed Kings and he set it up Kings so God is in control amen who's Changing Times and seasons of your life God Amen you you put up these scriptures as I'm calling them out Daniel 2:21 he changed times and Seasons he removed Kings and set it up Kings amen this is God's plan yes this is God's program in Revelation 411 Jesus is telling us amen hallelujah yeah they are worshiping Jesus they're worshiping God sorry and they're saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created am are you created by God yes then you are you are serving his purpose you are here for his pleasure amen Romans 828 it says and we know that these things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen we find here amen why God is using now a cruel thing that's happening in Egypt these people are successful people they are able to build the bricks and give Pharaoh what he wants but Pharaoh is not happy because his people are increasing rapidly amen gone into Moses now but there was a family that was waiting for the promise because they were following the word of God they were continuing in the word the prophecy went out yall shall be in Egypt for 400 years so they knew that 400 years have passed hello yes yes so they were continuing in the word is what I'm trying to tell you and they knew the scriptural sign and evidence that they were looking to see so the B the prophet will dramatize this you can read it in uh a teaching on Moses I think the message is called teaching on Moses where the Prophet is bringing this out and he says amen that AMR got to pray amram and Joseph B amen or yab if you want to pronounce it like a Hebrew saw that it was time for the word to be fulfilled so they went to pray yes and the prophet says it's usually those who pray is the one who got the burden amen that's in a true sign that's overlooked and it's usually you'll find it there on the notes and it's usually those who pray is the one who's got the burden who's got the burden the one who is praying amen it's usually those who pray is the one who's got the burden the one who gets something it's those who pray that's ordained of God to do so so you see God has called you separated yourself from the things of the world and the glorious power of God has Sanctified you from them things you should be the happiest person there is in the world look to your neighbor and tell them I'm so happy that you are happy amen hallelujah not talking tell him he wants to hear tell him I am so happy that you are so happy say it's okay to look at me amen you should be the happiest person in the world how many of you from today will say I will be the happiest person in the world Amen husbands look at your wives I don't know why brother jaff is laughing you also getting problems there you should be the happiest person in the world there was millions that would do it if they could but they can't it's not for them to have it are you listening to the prophet yes happiness is reserved for you thank you amen this is the day when the church is called out separated yeah little boys and girls what the prophet is saying to you now he says little boys and girls does God hear prayer oh little girls here does God hear prayer what' you say does God hear prayer see in the church there the boys and girls said yes he hears prayer does God answer prayer God can hear it but does he answer okay sometimes he makes us wait is that right but God answers prayer doesn't he amen and just because everything is going wrong that's no sign we should quit praying use remember what the word says now continue in the word then you shall be my disciples what does the word teach us the word teaches us how to pray we just pray on anyhow don't we God answers prayer let's say it all together let's all say it together now the prophet is saying it there let's say it all together God answers prayer amen yes no matter what the circumstances are he answers anyhow so then that night I'm here's amam now I'm going up to pray like I never prayed before there's no there that's the way to pray pray like you never prayed before really get to business if you just go up and say Lord bless so and so God don't take interest much to to that so you see now you learn a key now if I ask you brother rames pray that pray for me and the Lord will bless me if you go and say Lord bless brother aent what is he saying if I go up and say Lord bless so and so God don't take the interest much to that hey but when you really get down to business when your little boys and girls pray get down to business you know what I'm talking about you know how you get down to business when you're on that phone when you chatting to your friends you get down to business you must get down to business with praying do you do that in school do you ask God to help you in school when you're going to go to school and don't make very good grades like some of you know after the test you're praying night and day amen God I want you to help me have a little place slip out and pray say your little prayer you say it every night before you go to bed when you get up in the morning so the prophet of God tells us that the angel of the Lord came to amram and he told him amen that the Lord has heard your prayer and I've come to tell you that he's going to send you a deliverer and he's remembered his promise and the angel points his sword to the north and he tells him you're going to have a son amen because we know how the angel of the Lord talks right you're going to have a son amen and he shall be the deliverer amen hallelujah about this time next year you're going to have a son so Abraham comes down I'm going to close now Abraham comes down running to Joseph to tell him we're going to have a son we're going to have a son but Joseph is not too happy about the news because the law just been pass that they're going to kill all babies but God is not concerned about the law amen if he's got a purpose to fulfill amen he will bypass all laws amen yes come on now God will protect you from all the laws yes amen no matter what the laws are passed God will protect you if you're working according to his purpose amen amen so look at the time and this the timing of God to bring Moses to pass is when they are passing the laws about the deliverer about sorry killing babies two years and under amen Hallelujah he says God will bring it to pass amen we just be joyful and remain true to the promise and bring forth his baby amen hallelujah if God promised your baby if God promised your healing if God promised you that is Jehovah Gyra amen God will bring it to pass in your life amen it's God's problem Amen

Lord three people are buying their house cashier yeah amen amen I am living in God's economy amen did Abraham have to worry night and day when the Lord said look north south east and west I given you the lamp look at the stars amen look at the sand amen this will be your Offspring do you have to worry did he have to go and try and help God make it bring it to pass no who made the promise of the word did Jesus say if you continue in my word if you ask in faith are you continuing in his word amen then I tell you ask abundantly amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen amen so God is going to answer in spite of the situation don't make a difference amen Abraham went back to work the next day because you know he was also a mud Dober he was also making bricks he went back the next day full of strength full of life and he began to tell his co-workers amen work with all your might amen for our deliverance is coming soon amen we'll give to Pharaoh what is Pharaoh's and we'll give to God what is God's amen the angel of the Lord met me last night and he told me the deliverer is coming amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallelujah thank you Lord now what when the baby was born you know time passes the baby is born they need to protect the baby am and inspiration he takes this reads and he starts to build an ark a little basket full of reads and he begins to pitch it amen hallelujah amen I'm trying to show you that God's promises you are a part of God's promise for this day God will protect you God will protect you through the Nile God will protect you through Stormy Waters amen through crocodile infested waters through a world pool amen that may have been forming there in the waters amen nothing could touch the basket as long as Moses was in the basket amen as long as your spirit is in this body nothing can touch you if you're serving God's purpose amen hallelujah thank you amen so God navigated that that uh that basket through the Nile River amen through all the crocodiles and he brought it down through a beautiful garden stream right into to the Palace of pharaoh they had a lovely water feature there but God navigated it without GPS God the angels of the Lord you know what the I don't have time to read it now the prophet of God says that he dramatizes this and he says God is looking through the banister of heaven and he's asking his angels what are they doing down there and the angels tell God they are putting the baby in the water and God gets excited and he says you mean they trust me that much amen amen they have faith in me that much that I'm able to take care of this baby the one that I promised them amen he said send a 10,000 Legion of angels to protect that baby amen Psalm 91 is here to protect you amen hallelujah I shall give my angels charge over thee yes the angels are ministering Spirits sent forth to the HS of Salvation am the angel of the Lord encamps around them that fear Him yes Lord amen hallelujah all around you are angels amen even if you can't see it amen the angels of God are there to protect you amen praise the Lord here the the angels of God protect this basket and they take it all the way to Pharaoh's Courtyard and there amen the sister of pharaoh finds this basket and the prophet of God says that this woman knew that her brother had passed a cruel law so when she saw this baby she knew amen that this baby must have been an Hebrew baby but she had compassion in her heart because she couldn't have her own children and she said I will take this baby and I will raise this baby up you see what God will do he will make an unbelieving King pay for your maintenance yes must buy your nappies must buy your diapers must buy your wet wipes must buy your creams must buy your purities Moses grew up in [Music] luxury God will make the unbelievers take care of you yes that's right right God will make them take care of you and raise you up until you are ready to step out in your purpose the same one that Pharaoh raised was the same one that destroyed them because of him Moses amen so God is making them pay for his bills and God even if you read there further in that story how God now this woman she didn't you know milk only comes to a woman who was conceived or had a child so this woman she couldn't have children so she didn't have milk so she asked Miriam do you know anyone who can nurse this child amen said no just woman so God allows Joseph to come and the prophet says that the that Pharaoh's da sister said I'm going to pay you yeah $300 to nurse Moses amen and Miriam says I know just the woman amen and she ran to tell a mother to come amen and there in Pharaoh's kingdom yes Joseph nursed Moses and she got paid for nursing amen hallelujah hope my sisters don't get an idea now they nursing our babies here now brother Jeff with you and I in trouble here praise the Lord $300 a week oh I'm must read that carefully whether it's a month or a week yeah I don't to trap myself amen
