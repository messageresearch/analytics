[Music] amen hallelujah amen you can take your seats at this time amen [Music] amen it's good to praise and worship our god and king amen oh amen sometimes amen even when you're feeling down amen but when you begin to worship god amen you can start to see the joy in our child amen like paul said amen i just want to share a few words of testimony this morning i actually supposed to sing a song but then i thought about it since i had my experience of uh losing my brother as you all know i never got a chance to really share a few testimonies of what actually transpired through the time and now god seen us through and amen encouraged us at that time amen so as you know it was quite a trying time when we lost uh jonathan our brother and it was something unexpected for us because that was something we never really expected and from in our immediate family we never really lost anyone close to us apart from relatives but no one in our immediate family so the week before uh jonathan passed on i was praying for him and josh and i was both trained together and we were both sharing testimonies and at that stage we had no idea that god was going to take him away that week so i was praying and asked god for a confirmation and i said god this happened a few times the prophet when the prophet would just open the bible and find some sort of confirmation so i specifically asked god in my prayer and i said i'm gonna open the bible not once or twice but three times and in those three times if you give me a direct word then i'll know that it's from you so i open the bible just like the first scripture my eyes laid on was i won't remember the exact scripture but the words were your ways are not my ways and my ways are higher than your ways amen so sometimes when we have our own expectations of how things are going to turn out or perhaps how are you gonna get your healing but god says my ways are not your ways amen the next so i closed the bible i opened it again and the next scripture that i read was and jesus healed every severe pain now that was the first time i ever saw the bible mentioned in the word severe pain you'd usually see and jesus heal their disease or heal their sicknesses but it was quite striking to me that i found those words severe pain because uh what my brother was actually going through was very severe pain at the time not even morphine was helping him so that really struck me and so i closed the bible again and i opened it for a third time and the scripture that god gave me in the third time my eyes fell on was in the parable of the prodigal son and the scripture that god gave me was and behold that brother was lost is now found he was once dead is now alive so i never really thought that god meant that he was gonna take him that week so i i applied it more to a spiritual application and as the week panned out i began to get desperate and now i really know what it means when we when someone gives a prayer request and we say we gotta put ourselves in their shoes because when it's someone close to you that you know that's uh either very sick or about to lose their life i tell you what you get really in a state of desperation it got to a stage where i even i had to leave my wife at a mom's place i told i just wanted to be alone and fast and pray and i didn't eat anything uh any food for that for that two days that's how desperate i began to get and it so happened the next two days after that uh jonathan had passed on and so when we entered the hospital room because we had that scripture and joshua also agree with me on this we cannot explain the peace of god that full our hearts at that moment even though we entered into the room and basically staring at a dead body we didn't start to cry we didn't start to panic we didn't start to fear but there was such a peace of god that came over us at that time that we cannot explain and it wasn't us because after that when the funeral was over obviously we mourned and we were sad but at that particular time and i believe the prophet calls it when the supersense comes down it's a peace that surpasses all understanding so i'd like to thank god for that because actually my father was with us and if it wasn't for that peace of god we most probably would have broken down so i like to thank god for keeping us through that time and there are many other supernatural things that that happen and i'd like to share just this one instant and maybe sometimes to when when someone else shares their testimony it might not be personal to you but i pray that it will increase your faith in some way a few days after my brother passed on i did i stayed at my mom's house uh for that for that week and uh my brother actually had married my neighbor so his wife and the children were staying next door so i went to lock the outside gate and when i came back i saw my five-year-old nephew standing outside in the night and looking at the stars so i asked him what you're doing outside you know it's so late and it's so cold what what are you doing outside so you just told me he's looking at the stars so i went inside the house and then he sent me a whatsapp from his mom's phone while i was in the house and he said i was talking to a man outside and the man said that he was coming to well the world was slice me that's how a child would talk so that that really got me a bit worried now so i called him over and i asked him what happened and we i've also phoned josh i had him on the video call and we was going and we was praying for him and what struck me was how he described this man he said that he was looking into the sky and a window opened up and a man came through the window and this is a five-year-old boy and he has dressed in sort of brown a brown garment and he had a sword on his side so the only thing that i could identify this was a demon spirit so we prayed over him and we begin to castor that spirit and and the words that the demon actually told him was if you you must stop coming to see my uh his father otherwise he's going to attack all of us and the night before he act my father actually had an attack um by an evil spirit so we cast out that spirit and we began to pray and when i went outside after after we prayed i went outside and i was on the phone call with with brendan and i sharing with him what happened and as i was talking to him i was looking up into the sky and i saw a light sort of a star but it was much lower and it flew from sort of here to like around where the just passed where the speaker is and it disappeared right before my eyes and for me this was obviously a shock now because i was busy on the phone call and the only thing that i can identify that would be the angel of god that's come down after we begin to pray and call upon the angel of god to come down that's what i can identify with and it so happened that that light flew in the direction of where my nephew saw this demon and so after that he's never had that he's never had that experience again and well as a family we begin to have peace so you know when we we're always talking about the supernatural but just to encourage all that we always got to be aware that the unseen is always amongst us amen the angels of god are right with us and so is demon powers and that's why we got to be on watch a man so i pray that encourages you all to amen it's not something that we uh hold on to as our as our major as the prophet said amen we hold on to the word our faith is anchored on the word but amen god gives us these little things to encourage us because he's faithful amen is compassionate and amen he loves us amen and also i'd like to thank god for at the same time witnessing to my other brother samuel for those of you who don't know my brother samuel is sitting at the back he's been visiting church for a few weeks now so i like to thank god for working in his life as well he's got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and we like to thank god for that amen amen let's all stand if it had not been i would have drowned in the water but my soul has an escape a hiding place in you [Music] and the vowlessness [Music] [Music] i can't live without [Music] [Music] i [Music] nothing without [Music] can't live you you without you i live and moving [Music] that i breathed [Music] nothing without you nothing [Music] here [Music] mmm i believe the holy spirit has put us in our right mind amen that we can come and worship him with praise give him all the glory and that is worthy of all praise amen just like to encourage the believers that i'm not coming think some of them should be coming now maybe some of them are making an excuse not to come to church thinking they're going to get the virus well if they can't come to church thinking they're going to get the virus they mustn't go anywhere they must go to work they mustn't go to the supermarkets they mustn't go anywhere but they won't come to church and it's more easier for them to get the balance of the slow market and in the crowds see so don't make an excuse and say you're going to get the virus because nobody yet has got the virus amen we got the antidote jesus christ and also young children also you know the record they the young children can go through this they've got an immune system so don't get them used to staying at home get them used to coming to church alfred amen have faith until we bring the church amen we're going to serve the law amen see so we pray give us grace and uh and i pray none of them died from this virus we won't even see the body isn't it we won't even see the body we gotta go seal but we like to see them before the gourmet so come to church and worship the lord right and faith but then the bible said jesus said you shall drink every deadly things and walk upon scorpions and serpents do you know so you find these people not coming they drink something on the other days definitely going to the supermarket i mean they've got to have food to eat so they're going to go buy the food so come for some spiritual food i pray god will make a way amen so 10 obama's the book of uh hebrews chapter 11. so hebrews stopped the 10th i don't like these mics and all sticking around my face here i get very nervous so i'm going to bless us as uh bonnie and uh you know we are living in a very uh stressful time and the believers are going through a test around the world and uh so people are praying the more they preach and the more they pray for divine healing more people are getting sick even though sponsors are praying for people all the time their family is getting attacked see the devil is putting them through a test trying time but they got more faith to believe and trust god but then i want to say this morning that people can get healed and still die they'll get healed and live for a while they're still gonna die but jesus raised up lazarus from the dead but he still had to die the prophet prayed for many many people received the healing in their day but today they're all dead but god healed him for time see but we all still gotta die because we know it's a it's appointed on a man 70 years right and he can't live above that years so uh we're still going to die and these bodies like a factory it's a factory every organ has got work to do see and then sometimes the system breaks down and and everything else and it affects the body and things like that but uh god knows all things see that the enemy comes in there they attack the body see so i make an organ to not function and all these things but uh we're just stressing the lord but we are looking for a new body there'll be no organ failure there'll be no sickness praise the lord and we know we're not very far from there we're living right now if you're following the news american can start any time it actually started you know israel and iran is at war already they're actually attacking each other by uh santo force and taking uh infrastructure water and all these things and we're living in such a such a deceptive time if you look at this now america with israel was working up the peace plane right to take part of uh west bank and under their control and then we got the the russians protecting the syrian president then we got iran and taking israel from syria and israel is attacking the bases where they are trying to attack them from now what china has done the president he's made friends with the palestinians and he's he's supporting them whereas now is being in direct conflict with america to say that we are here with the palestinians now let me let me see what you're going to do so it's a very conflicting time so we know armageddon is going to start and we know when that starts now the rapture must go yes praise the lord so we're believing for that this morning so we'll read from our bibles uh the book of hebrews chapter 10 sorry hebrews chapter 10 uh the title of the message is pressing on to the rapture and the promised kingdom pressing on to the rapture and the promised kingdom amen right but faith that is what the believer is dreaming amen amen that is what the basic bully was doing pressing on to the rapture yes and the promised kingdom right so that is the believers of the brightness so let's see what the scripture says now uh some other people now reading from verse 31 hebrews 10 31 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god but call to romans remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated what that means they would like to do the world after they were eliminated you endure a great fight of afflictions partly whilst you are mainly grazing stock bought by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used for you had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance caused by the way there for your confidence which are great recompense of reward for your beard of patience then after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and not carry now the judge shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are none of them will draw back onto petition destruction right but of them that believe to the saving of the soul but we are none of them will draw back into condition but one of them that believe to the saving of the soul praise the lord let's just pray amen lord jesus we thank you lord for this glorious day we thank you lord for this way we thank you lord for this faith and lord we know there is uh no other better way we can live and lord we know christianity is the best there is no other religion there is no other faith and we know it is your word we know you have come down you have demonstrated yourself your power reveal yourself we thank you a lot for calling us and revealing yourself to us even in this messy draw and all that we know of you lord that we were taught by your prophets even the life that we lived and the experiences that he had wrong we thank you a lot for sending us the prophet for this last day and lord you said surely you'll do nothing but reveal your secrets to your servants the prophets and we thank you lord we come because the word has been opened to us and we can say lord we thank you we are our right minds we give you praise and glory and lord though we are afflicted though we feel sorrow many times we have heartaches but lord we know joy comes in the morning amen yes we just got to end your little while and i pray that you'll be with us lord and and strengthen us even that we that are standing here this morning we pray that you'll keep everyone by your grace and mercy lord keep away all the sicknesses and diseases and by this loss we come by faith and we serve you all we also pray for those that are home and not well we pray that your healing virtues and touch will be with their lord especially remembering our brother sonny lord for his speedy recovery lord that he'll be back on his feet again and punishing your word lord bless his family also and we also want to remember to stand raj and his wife also make our way for them we pray for your grace and mercy upon the life and lord we also want to remember our brother dennis this morning make a way for him also lord and i pray for many other believers that have been this morning then reach out by faith and receive lord from your word this morning we pray on us in jesus precious name amen praise the lord amen you may be seated i was going to say something about uh whatever raj and his wife but i want them to be i want to say it and uh you know they would be a witness you know something amazing has happened between them am i and i actually had nothing to do with it and i was put into a fix actually it is it is this time i was put into a fix and uh i said something and it was like a commitment and i said oh lord what am i going to do now but the lord made a way see and it was it was between them so i'd like them to be present here they're not well uh they had they were very frivolous and you know like symptoms and they went to the hospital there in bedlam and they didn't like the situation there they did take also the test for the virus and they'll get the results maybe by tomorrow or tuesday but pray for them god will make your way for them see because they've taken the step uh to you know to look together and reconcile so we just pray for them god will make a way praise the lord and also dennis is they're not going to church and out there because there's no church in congress at the moment open and he was coming here but the place is staying stopped in the record you can't go anywhere and uh you must stay over here we don't want you to go in fact they were very angry and they told him to pick up his clothes and leave and they told him to say yeah you better not go anywhere and just stay here so he's looking for a place a room somewhere you can rent you know things like that you want to come back to phoenix so if anybody knows of anybody who's living a room you know stop letting a room in the house or something like that and uh just let us know gotta make our way through so uh you know we may not take these things serious but uh the prophet said you must put yourself in there true and you know how they feel and surely if they didn't stop it you would have been here this morning because he was wanting to come here every week so we pray god will make our way through it if any man grow back my soul shall have no pleasure in it praise the lord if any man grow back see god said my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not to them that draw back amen see that's what the scripture says but we are pressing on to the promises of god yes no matter what affliction what we go through what are they and and whatever it is we're pressing through and sorry remember brother sam also forgot to mention him he was taken healed i think when it was uh what it was one day he was taken ill during the night and uh he was he went to the doctors and they gave him some treatment and things like that so just burn him up and pray i've got to make a way for him also so we are we are pressing on the battle not no sickness no infliction nothing can get us down all these things are coming upon the earth now these things are not now they are from from way back people are getting sick elijah the prophet got sick and died he died over sickness so he's been happening from ages and ages and ages but god is also the healer he said i am the lord that healed me amen yes all thy sickness all that diseases amen and he's made away by the atonement though we get afflicted and all this thing but we're still praying and as i said we will get well we'll get better for a while at all but we still got to die see now that is what we're going to make preparations for because the bottom talks about the a second debt also we are going to die we know that but there's a second yet which we don't want to come to the second death amen we want to escape the second death see so that's what i said it's a fear fearful thing to fear fall into the hands of a living god right but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him right so the prophet tells us here and the word of god tells us that there was a guy in the days of uh of saint paul by the name of demons and demons left paul and uh he was zooming there in his ministry he left him right and the prophet said you know what how can a man you know he must leave a man like paul with a ministry like that but the bible says he was left and he's gone to the present world but the prophet said he didn't think he backslid and went and did the wrong thing he just lost his influence with being with paul and he saw paul was that his monastery was great and all these things but he saw like uh you know this guy is like poor he's only got one coat he's telling to meet him when you come bring my one coat and come on you know like he can't afford clothes you know and then and he says no demons was a rich guy he was well off but he couldn't stay around and uh and if you don't take the torbjorn there they're probably speaking from aggressive present stage of my ministry amen that many people are going to leave and go and he actually makes a statement there he says uh earned blackstone you know was his campaign manager right from canada and uh he says er baxter made this comment that when he gets to heaven and he finds demons there he's gonna give him a smith across his face and say why didn't you ever leave paul the promise you know that won't really happen that nobody's going to fight or anything like this but i said this one this is what he said you know like i'm going to give him a smack and ask him why did you leave a man like paul a great ministry and he's preaching that in the present stage of my ministry that he's going from one stage to another stage to another state and he's a scene like to the world it was falling back the healing and all was falling back but god was getting ready to do a greater thing amen the opening of the word and if you look at it now the very guy that says why did he muslim he left the prophet he never continued believing the message he went on into the denomination and he was again some of the teachings of what the prophet was teaching so it just shows so divas now left for he left he left the ministry of the day and he went away how come amen and we know the problem said when he was taken back over there he said i only preached what paul preached praise the lord he stayed with that word but he was left him he left wall he left his ministry and we don't know where else he went to right so are we gonna uh you know look i'm just getting the touch here now he's very bad but he does pull away if any man draw back so when god is calling us and the angels of god is there we there's no drawing back now we find these two angels came to lot and suddenly was in a crisis pathetic these two angels came there they wanted to attack them and do a sinful thing but the angels said to lot take your your wife and your two daughters and run don't look back see this is why germany men draw back don't look back just when you keep running now don't look back but now his wife you know like he was disobedient to the garden looked back but the angel said don't look back now she turned into a full of assault you know that is a sad thing and with god all things are possible he can take a human being turn into a pull up assault why she turned into a fuller soul she looked back see so when god has called you and he's uh he sent his angel we believe the angel is going before us and the message is god before us don't look back we are not to look back into the world see now we know that uh uh mr sloth she had two other daughters there and maybe the two other son-in-laws now they were making mockery of them calling and saying they didn't want to believe but they all burnt up in the city they were built up so she had concerned that she had to look back she had concern maybe my grandchildren there my two daughters left behind and uh you know how the after her mother is but she didn't know what was going to happen to her with concern she'll look back but god is not interested in what your concern is he's interested in what he said he said don't look back when god is calling us here with his word and we've seen the power the signs and everything else we have not to look back amen it says here and i'm going to read that in 1 john chapter 2 1 john chapter 2. some people can look back into the world right so let's see what the bible says 1 john chapter 2 from verse 15. love not the world these are the things that are in the world if any men love the world the love of the father is not in it so when god is calling us now we must we must make it uh you know by the grace of god to serve him amen don't love the things of the world see we must love god love his word amen we are god has given us from the things of this world so it says don't love the things of this world right for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh how many people are caught up there in the lust of the flesh see he can't have two masters that's what he said and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life see how we can love the things in the world lust of the flesh lust of the high and the pride of life is not of the father what is of the world praise hello we mustn't lust up the things of this world which the people are lusting after you know all the things that is not edifying he's not throwing them closer to god see those those are going to bring distraction to them see he says don't love those things amen the world pass it away and the lust thereof but he that does the will of god abide in forever so all these things are going to fade away see it's going to fade away amen but he that doing the will of god abideth forever praise the lord now he said little children it is the last time as you have heard that antichrist has come even now there are many antichrists wherefore we know that it is the last time look at it now the antichrist started writing the page many antichrist antichrist means against the word they were against the word so he's telling them like you know this happy christ here and and what we address them as little children many antichrist see don't be drawn by them don't listen to them right verse 19 they went out from us but they were not of us see very men draw back but these are not unbelievers he's talking about yes they supposed to be christians in their day and they went out from us but there were none of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us like give us demons who have continued see but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of us see there could be people now even in the message a lot of people have gone back they think they're in the message but they got back some people going to church with other churches some people are staying at home see some people stop serving god some people change their dress codes they left the world they love the message they left the faith some of them moved over to other provinces and all and not serving god like they used to serve see they drove back but jesus said my soul shall have no pleasure in them amen now the way he gives the assurance to the believers here but he have an action from the holy one amen and you know all things now the action there is an anointing for religious service they used to do by oil he says now you are anointed maybe it's not that little oil but we have a spiritual anointing that we know all things praise the lord so we're not looking back we are pressing on to the coming of the rapture and the promised kingdom praise the lord so we're not going to draw back if you think now but you know what i i don't think but why did the prophet preach a messenger how can i overcome what you're going to overcome you're going to overcome a lot of things in this life amen don't need that message how can i overcome and now they said are you going to overcome i will come by the world three times jesus was tested and tempted by satan and he said certainly it is written so when you are tested and tempted now are you gonna overcome telling me it is written amen we must not live by these things we must not indulge in the wrong we must not be get caught up with the ungodly of this world we must strive to look before the lord amen amen you got to make a sacrifice amen you got to pay a price also if you haven't watched us amen we're gonna forfeit all our rights your brother said we must fulfill our rights amen he said like the woman will come in america said we have a right to chill out we want to dress and and how we want to wear our hair that forfeit all your lights and the problems and now you fulfill all these things here but you got more to gain on the other side praise the lord amen forfeit all this thing it's only for a while it's only for a season it's all going to perish he says store up on the other side praise the lord sublime sister you know what this world was a a beautiful world when god created it because he said it was good every time you know you create you said it was good and god saw that it was good and god saw that it was good it was beautiful he separated the waters from the land and all these things and all the you know animals and birds and insects and plants and everything beautiful it was but corruption came by man corruption started by men you know i was looking at some pictures there they got one of the space crafts got to mars it's a long long way 385 000 kilometers from here to mars 385 000 now they got this uh i don't know what they call it uh i think biking or something i think biking right it's taking pictures at the center last lot of pictures and i tell you mars look a beautiful place it looks very much like earth only thing there's no plant life and there's no water there and then you see the beautiful mountain ranges and planes and everything else and and i tell you what if i had an opportunity to go to barcelona it looks beautiful you don't want it there and if there's plant life and you can go look there i don't mind going and nobody can live there there's no atmosphere like this and even the moon the moon look very much like the earth if we saw the pictures that they took up the moon and sent here they got their mountain ranges and and all this thing right and and it looks but nobody can stay there they haven't got the atmosphere like we got see actually the moon haven't got the atmosphere the hill has gone but it's a beautiful place if you get a chance just go and have a look at that peaches from mars they send the latest one beautiful beautiful pictures you know and they got uh and you can see i don't know whether it was too but it looked like there were water on there on the mars you know when water has been through a place you can see this shifting of the sand and like lakes and all it seems like water used to be there but we don't know the bible don't tell us anything see but man came on the face of the earth and that's where corruption started but it used to be a beautiful place what could happen it's sin unbelief see that's why jesus said the soul that sinned shall die now we gotta die first we're gonna die right we're gonna live whether 70 years 80 years 90 years 100 years we're going to die but when we say the soul that sinned shall die god will bring a complete destruction to the soul and that soul the spirit is living in this body we will die in this body this body will go to the ground but the spirit goes back to god right so that one is going to be a white grown judgment the bible tells us there's going to be a white throne judgment there and everybody is going to be brought to the white throat judgment after a thousand years after the millennium after the bride has been spending 1 000 years upon the face of the earth there's going to be the white throne judgment amen and satan will be cast into the lake of fire that will be the complete destruction it's going to be what they say annihilated completely destroyed and all the souls are going to come and stand and appear before god to give an answer for the life that they lived and the bible says the books were opened and all the deeds were over there in the book that's in the book of revelation right it was there all that deeds and how they lived and and when that given opportunity to receive the gospel and those that walked away turned away from the gospel all is going to come up there amen what are we going to do that's a whiter judgment and the bible says now this is when they are pronounced to go to the second dead where the soul is destroyed praise the lord and then god will make this earth now a foot place to live in again like i said the earth was a beautiful place to live so it's going to be beautiful again can you picture our health here now a beautiful place with everybody that i am nobody that is old no gray air no wrinkles no nothing see picture that now and that is where we are going to look at the promises that we have so let us press on to the coming of the rapture why live in all these big elements here the bible says why indulge in all these things here sometimes people think oh you know what uh i need a little relaxation you know i need to have some wine or maybe i need cigarettes to calm my nerves what kind of people are fighting for those things now we when the model starts open we want cigarettes again you see how they came down everybody got to listen you've never gotta wear your mask you don't want your mask you can't go shopping you can't go anywhere see and i want to say something that the bible tells us we must also wear a garment amen if we don't want to be cast out we must have the wedding garments because the bible says there's one man he entered into that into the banquet there without the wedding garments what did he do took him out and threw him now if anybody go without a mask anyway they're not allowed you go to the shopping center they throw you out leave blood holy ghost and if you don't have the covering they're going to cast them out see some people are going to come to their wedding went through judgment and they're going to be judged they're going to give it after answer francis that's what jesus said the people from sodom and gomorrha will rise up amen the people from delhi will rise up the queen of sheba will rise up amen she saw great things but a greater than solomon is here amen and he says now we never had all this witness but you all had all this witness they're going to stand up in the judgment and we're going to condemn it so those people are not they may be dead on the earth but they are waiting to come to the judgment even jesus was there capernaum companion if you only know the days that you're living in you can discern the skies you know you know how good science is now you can go to get the weather for the whole week enough people go to let me see what's the weather for the whole week i can see how much dress what clothes i must have already isn't it so they can they can tell you that the weather patterns but they don't know the day that they are living in amen and we got a message here that the prophet tells us here in the third day god promised to revive his israel amen in the third day so where we are living now we are right there in the third day amen we are living in the closing of time amen we are right there in the coming of the lord so what the bible says now we must be overcomers we must be persistent amen persistent means don't give up amen if you are pressing onto something be persistent amen if you ever want to achieve something be persistent like if you're studying young people if you're studying for something you've got to be persistent amen you've got to endure if you want to achieve i mean you can't have a drunk attitude i know what i'll just take it easy you know when the last minute come i'll sweat it out that's how we used to do in our school days know a couple weeks before exam you sweat it out i don't know whether i sweated up because once in a while i used to copy i'm telling you the truth not too much a little bit see people start copying and they get the exam papers and it gets leaked out and they want to pass the exam but they never persisted themselves they cheated only how many professionals coming with fault certificates even doctors got false significant i mean they're practicing not qualified as doctors as long as they can poke at me or their doctor and the people getting bluffed they've got doctors there they're thinking of these guys but they found that this guy is a fake doctor fake is significant they research and all you never even go to university so you can buy a doctor's certificate today but don't let them catch you up because you'll need a doctor in prison amen so what the bible says here we must continue so we are none of them will draw back unto destruction so that's why now jesus said luke 17 one day he says as it was in the days of lord as he possibly sort of remember lord's wife why is he putting you here in luke 17 and that scripture is going to be fulfilling in our day remember lord's wife what he said she look back luke 17 he said when the son of man is revealed don't look back press on to the coming of the rapture amen don't look back don't hear what others are saying there are many voices in the world people are confusing the bride yes there are these people confusing them right they're telling them all types of things over the prophet and you know this vision was wrong and that was wrong don't listen to all the other voices amen yes we have one voice we had signs and there's a voice behind our signs amen not being all the other voices see some people are drawing back because of other voices but they can't go back in the state with the voice of god amen see that's where they're falling and jesus is telling them think about it now right then luke 17. so shall it be in the days yes and we know that was fruitful now that's history isn't it the son of man has revealed himself he showed us by discernment what he did when he came here the first time calling peter andrew and all that he's done the same thing you know he's the messiah i said why are you gonna look back probably that's why i said there is no other better way than this way there is no other better gospel than this gospel amen amen the things that god has made us listen to by sending his prophet is not preached anywhere in in the light of truth see and now we also know a lot of other churches did not they know who the antichrist is they know now they can see his room lots of them other churches see but the prophet gave us you know the real true revelation when the seals were open about the antichrist how he started writing and where he's finishing off praise the lord so we are looking to that now see we're not looking to the things of this world see once you know why you'll get influenced if you let down your god amen you will stay too long on your on your your on your cell phones you'll get influenced the wrong things and that doesn't verify the soul amen it's a contamination to the spirit now what is this body really what are these bodies this body is a tabernacle to the spirit that's all this body is it is housing the spirit and soul so the outward flesh now want to live on all the things of this world but the bible says this is the temple of the holy ghost now if you went to a temple today what will be the atmosphere in the temple holiness some of the peace up you know holiness you feel holiness are you know really reverent the priest is there whatever temple you go like holiness and the bible says we are the temple of the holy ghost so there supposed to be some holiness about us there's supposed to be some righteousness about us see so we must shed all these things and now the problem says dream not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption amen so if you want to know you've got the holy ghost when we do wrong we get grieved isn't it we know like with something we're not supposed to do or not supposed to speak or something like that if you've got the holy spirit it's grieved in you you feel terrible you feel uncomfortable and then you want to go on your knees that's a lot i'm sorry and you contrast the lord and the bible says he will confess his sin god is faithful and just to forgive amen we have a high priest we have an advocate amen if any man sin jesus is there the advocate and the blood of jesus christ comes us so that's why now when you we're not supposed to gossip we're not supposed to have a tongue the bible talks about the tongue it sounds like a ship you know the ship is so big and they got that what they call it the thing that right in the bottom there then elbow something yeah that pilot there is telling a small little thing and drives the whole ship and the bomb says our tongue is like that a little member can do a great big destruction so he says sometimes we must watch what we talk let our speech be seasoned with songs see we gotta watch what we talk what the uh you know what the people gonna hear what we are saying what we are talking as christian our speech must be edifying to others they will say what manner of people is this i never heard people talk like this amen see so we are the temple of the holy ghost we have an action an anointing praise allah so that is where now you have a desire to say lord i don't want to live in this body like this we are we are subject to all things around us we are still human and the bible says jesus said now many places if you look upon a woman to rush out there lust up the eyes so the woman wanted to dress herself in a certain way she may not know it but the men are lasting after see they see the way she's dressed and she looks very attractive and things like that that is man he start lusting after a woman to look at her body and he lost up to her body but the devil is so crooked and and perverted today the woman can be fully dressed properly they'll still last after can we get some air man yeah she can be fully dressed she can dress like a basic sister and everything ben will still lust after that if you don't believe that why did the pastors fall from members in noun congregation they never come to looking like a sex queen or anything they were dressed like sisters but how many of them fell see so the lust of the high jesus said if you look up our over plus amen last week we were there in uh kenobi we went to ghana i went to gonna have my little chicken whatever was there the one waiting i don't know the wife was sitting there man when she looking that man he looked so terrible i don't know why are you looking at lusting after men who is she lasted after on tell me now she lasted after joseph and and her husband had the right name b.o.t so his stomach was like and she said no joseph you look so slim you look so handsome you know full of life full of vigor and everything else come and lie with me that joseph was a man of god he endured all temptation and he refused and then she falsely accused him they sent him to prison false accusation some women do lust women do look at men or maybe before they marry they do like look at boys that is true they look and say you know what i wish i'd get that guy there hey that guy looks so handsome hey you know what they don't know nothing about the guy see she don't want you laughing i wasn't even a christian i was smoking i used to drink socially but one day she saw me coming hey this is a guy here i want this guy here i'm after this guy here you know i do nothing but one day going to a engagement a brother's engagement in peter meltzer see on the return trip guns are fast today but sometimes it's good and i was sitting there next to the window and she said please can i sit here next to the window can i can i come and sit next to you thank god it's going to start somewhere something you know the guys sometimes are too slow also they're slow they're waiting waiting waiting they think hey you know what if you like that girl go tell her and they're not get the straight answer but you're waiting now hey i like that yellow i like this girl i like that guilt approach them tell him you know what i seem to be attracted to you yeah it's got to start somewhere isn't it see there's got to be that fatal attraction stuff somewhere huh okay i didn't really finish up there now do not lust some people get in contact with me because they're lusted after them that's true see do not desire all these things of the world see if you want some time to relax you know just quit all the other stuff and running around around just go and relax listen to some music listen to the tape don't say now i think uh i'll have a vienna i know a black market and i gotta play black market price water stores closed so you want a beer you know where to get it and there's a guy down the road here man he's got the stocks even if he's selling it for 10 times the price you got to get it huh yeah you don't get it they want it let me relax with another vienna let me settle down those things are true so let me settle down with there with a cigarette let me pull that thing and i calm my nerves you know my nerves are shocked but the bible says you temple of the holy ghost see so if any man grow back my soul has no pleasure in him see we are not to them that rob but what are we pulling down on strongholds the struggles of the enemy satan amen he knows how to attack he knows how to come satan knows how to seduce because he started in the garden of eden praise the lord so jesus tell us in matthew 6 24 you cannot serve two masters you must love one and hate the other isn't it you can't serve two masters so we can't say i'm a coveted christian now and i'm serving the lord and honesty and that we want to live in the world also this was love one and eight the other one you must actually do that right so we have an action we have an anointing by the holy ghost if you read the message of the prophet he said right down in the soul you have doubt of faith right so if you got doubt that is where people go back they draw back they turn away from god they're disbelieving god but if you've got faith in the soul and the prophet tells the time when his wife died and he took willie paul to the graveyard there and billy paul says derry mummy is here down the grave and all this thing and he started talking and then satan came said yahweh is your god now you're preaching you're jesus where is he your wife is here your father died in a heart attack your brothers died why are you bragging about this jesus started reasoning with him and the prophet said like you know it seems like god won't even hear him blackness like a blanket came down over and he started to reason and he says satan though you are right where is his god now see in the time of crisis and people can't get an answer they want to say god what happened you're not around reason while he was listening and then he said if it hasn't been something way down faith amen faith stood up and you remember this scriptures of job also the lord giveth and the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord he knew god is in control even in death so i said if it wasn't for the convergent deep down which is faith praise the lord that's what we must have don't doubt the word of god but have faith see anything you don't understand don't doubt see don't doubt anything in the message but have faith many things will come your way give it to reason i mean the prophet god teaching medicine by taking his wife taught me my lesson about taking his daughter and he he said lord and and being human he wanted a common suicide he said i can't face it you want to go grab that political wires on the pole and take his life so remember even a prophet can break down but god had a work for him to do he never allowed him to take his life see the crisis that's a lot of people come with suicide they can't take it they can't face it none of them see but god is our overcoming power amen we will say sometimes maybe somebody gets sick you want to blame somebody else don't blame somebody else then the bible tells us god puts us to test and trials to see what we'll do about it don't blame somebody else trust god god does things for his own glory like that man that was blind from birth jesus said to them this was done he was born like this so the glory of god can be seen so god allowed him to be born blind that he will receive israel healing and be a testimony and a witness for them around there because they came and questioned it who are you who healed you derek and jesus who is this jesus and jesus said no listen this man was born blind they thought oh his mother sinned and father sinned now you know he got afflicted she said christ is not because his personal sin no it was predestinated foreign that the works of god can be seen see so we go through some problems some sickness and then we get complaints from believers also now believers get sick maybe believers are praying believers are you know sometimes they visit them in hospital and the people are not praying for me and they're not phoning me you know the complaint makes it worse for them let's make it better people are praying see they say no those people are not praying for me and uh you know nobody's following me and encouraging me they're like babies but we must trust god ourselves even if somebody come and visit like jokes to be friends now was it any up to him no they came and spent time with him and everything else and you know never helped him so people are praying that he said oh the call from the pastor pastor is not coming see nobody is coming to visit us the complaining is going to make it worse for themselves that is the truth you just have faith and have the right attitude and right spirits and distrust god amen okay let's go a little further down here the bible says faith is a substance of things up for the evidence of things not seen faith is the substance of things up for the evidence not seen by this the elders received a great report you see alfred let them through amen see now we're not to them they're drawing back we are them they're pressing forward the bible talks about naomi and her two daughter-in-laws right and then the sons died their husband died now she was going back to bethlehem they had to go there because there was a famine she want to go back to her position she know she had land over there there's got to be somebody must redeem the land back and then she's coming back with a true daughter like opera or pha they she gave opportunity for them to go back open kiss the mother of goodbye said bye i'll break back the oppa means nick she was stiff-necked amen our stiffness another one when stephen was preaching there he said you stiff-necked you're unsacrified you're not you always resist the holy ghost and in that crisis of that time normie needed a friend she's going back without a husband without the two sons what a glorious thing root says i will never leave you amen i will go with you your god will be my god all that know me was she says i prefer to be part of it and luke means a friend and now when she came there she was in the field of poez huh i will sting the jewish harvest to help the jewish church alone for the jewish church to get into redemption you would be rude and gentile was helping out in the harvest field of wires amen to help normally the jewish church get back into redemption and the prophet said when this gospel is finished that gentile church will be there taking the gospel back to the jews and today lots of them have preached the gospel in jerusalem and the jewish churches are now christians there amen so rudnah was a gentile helping in the harvest of the jewish church and in that help there she got redeemed praise the lord and god blessed her so much that she threw to a great man of god that came after her why because she didn't turn back she pressed on with nobody so we are pressing on with the jewish church amen you know what the next president derek is running for president joe biden he's against the jews he's for the palestinians and anybody that comes against the jews god says there's no blessing but cases upon them and everything that trump is doing he says i'm going to reverse it trump brought me the moneys they're giving 400 million dollars a year i think to the world health organization stop it because they were signing with china about bringing the report about the virus so pilan says if you come into power the first day you will give the money back to them isn't it conflicting and he's against this uh uh the roadmap plan to peace he's looking for that and he's prepared to move out jerusalem back being the capital moving back out of there and the bible said jerusalem the king of salem is going to come and set up his kingdom there jerusalem king of salem amen amen so there's going to be a new evidence right there and he'll be the land the light the city will need no light the lamb is the light sitting right there in jerusalem the headquarters of god so we see all this conflicting thing coming up on here but some people want to pull back see we're coming here now people say oh you know so long now you know we preaching rapture from so long the coming of the lord the rapture the coming of the lord so long the preaching preaching when the rapture gonna come the one says it's in an hour that you know not off it's such an hour you know not off see between six and nine one morning we won't be gathering here anymore praise the lord i'll be glad for that that day is coming are we looking forward are we watching and waiting and looking praying lord the rapture is going to come anybody where are we you know i'm waiting for jesus the king of israel where was nathaniel under the victory he was praying and meditating they're coming the first coming day he was praying and waiting amen and when they came to call him he says that then you'll come before the messiah so what was your name watching and waiting and praying and then you scared the messiahs here so we must literally doing that don't say no i know i'm scared of this violence and i'm staying at home i'm not doing the church and everything else and they're going to work and everything else it's more risky because they're going to the workmates and all they can get it and bring it home see so we want people coming back to church exercise our faith lord i'm going to serve you virus and no virus see and i want to say some of them it's an excuse not to come you go check them out this week they drink something going on away from home mixing around with the people that they can get the virus from yeah they can bring it home so let's press on the battle to the coming of the lord amen we must not be you know to them that want to give up amen god gave us a message not to give up see one of these mornings it won't be long christians will come you're going to look for me but will be gone that people are going to say where is this people he said this is a right time for the hampton to take place because all the babies know people can't go to church so we never come here for a couple weeks isn't it until they allowed 50 people to come back so what happened the rapture they won't know they said no these people are not coming down their mind is locked up but then after begun see in such an hour as you think about the son of man coming praise the lord so let's say lord we are looking on to the promise looking to the coming of the rupture and the rupture is the only flight guaranteed saa can't get into your flight they've got no pilots they don't know workers they can't afford to even fly the planes but the raptor is our only flight guaranteed praise the lord we gonna take off we don't need rocket fuel we don't need to be put into a rocket amen the word that's being built up now gonna change our bodies jesus i'm gonna change our bodies we that are alive and remain shall be changed he's gonna meet us in the air praise the lord i'll be glad for that see so take it as a little thing we waiting for the rapture we are praying for the rapture be like nathaniel say lord which day which day lord i'm waiting which day lord praise the lord amen but cut it all joy in the lord shall come and we go we've got nothing to miss yet we've got nothing to leave behind and be sorrowful about today you talk about the rapture people get money they get disturbed they got this stuff for a long time hey don't talk like that man you know we got so many things to do and all that but god is going to take us to a better place praise the lord amen how many of you you are seated this morning in prayer you have a need this morning so let's trust the lord praise the lord are you going to trust the lord or trust what the world says praise the lord we must trust the world but trust what man says trust the word plus jesus we have one sister governor only you need prayer anybody else be prayer for anything maybe you need victory in your life maybe you need to say lord i need a closer walk with you not uh let me press on the coming of the lord look to the rapture praise the lord come sister gandhi we're not going to worry about what
