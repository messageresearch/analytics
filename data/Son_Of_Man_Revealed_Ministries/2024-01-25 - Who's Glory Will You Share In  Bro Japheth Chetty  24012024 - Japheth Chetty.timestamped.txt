[2:18] amen thank you Father amen I greet you
[2:21] Lord in the wonderful and precious name
[2:23] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[2:26] we blessed to be in the house of the
[2:27] Lord once again amen I'm glad the
[2:29] atmosphere is charged up Hallelujah now
[2:32] I told Pastor Adan on Sunday I have it
[2:34] easy on a wedness day because the
[2:36] atmosphere is usually charged up on a
[2:38] wedness day you know you don't realize
[2:40] how difficult sometimes it can be when
[2:43] you know the minister is here and if the
[2:44] atmosphere is not set amen it's very
[2:47] difficult because ministers are usually
[2:49] very temperamental usually very nervous
[2:52] people as well because they're trying to
[2:54] be in between two Dimensions at the same
[2:56] time amen you know you're looking at a
[2:58] natural person standing here but the
[3:00] minister is in between two dimensions
[3:03] and if you catch the same anointing you
[3:05] can be in between two Dimensions as well
[3:08] that is why the Bible says we are seated
[3:09] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[3:12] Jesus amen you know sometimes you just
[3:15] got to be sensitive to that other
[3:18] dimension yes you know even like today
[3:20] my wife was unwell and you know as she
[3:22] was talking to me I was taking her to
[3:23] the doctors and she's talking to me and
[3:27] I'm not ignoring I'm listening to what
[3:28] she's saying but at the same time I'm
[3:30] getting inspiration from from that
[3:32] Dimension and you're trying to be in
[3:34] between two Dimensions amen that's what
[3:37] the a minister goes through but when you
[3:38] set the atmosphere then you can receive
[3:41] a blessing out of Hallelujah because the
[3:43] gifts are for you amen the gifts are to
[3:46] benefit you amen amen so I'd like to
[3:49] thank uh brother Ramesh and Pastor for
[3:52] setting uh the platform already so I'm
[3:55] just going to take the Bon and run with
[3:56] it amen amen under the same inspiration
[3:59] under the same anointing amen let's open
[4:01] our Bibles the book of Isaiah
[4:06] 6 reading from verse
[4:18] one amen so the Bible
[4:20] reads in the year that King oziah died I
[4:24] saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne
[4:27] high and lifted up amen and his train
[4:30] full the temple amen amen above it stood
[4:34] the serams each one had six wings with
[4:37] Twain he covered his face and with train
[4:39] he covered his feet and with train he
[4:41] did fly and one Cried Out unto another
[4:45] and said holy holy holy is the Lord of
[4:47] hosts the whole earth is full of his
[4:50] glory amen and the post of the door
[4:52] moved at the voice of him that cried and
[4:55] the house was full with smoke yes amen
[4:57] his voice was so powerful amen amen that
[5:00] even the door started to move amen the
[5:02] door posted amen then said I woe is me
[5:07] so Isiah when he's caught up now to the
[5:09] presence of the Living God he says woe
[5:11] is me for am for I am undone because I
[5:14] am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in
[5:17] the midst of people of unclean lips for
[5:20] mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[5:22] hosts amen the king of glory amen amen
[5:27] then flew one of the seraphim unto me
[5:29] having a live coal in his hand which he
[5:31] had taken with the tongue the tongues
[5:34] from off the Altar and he laid it upon
[5:37] my mouth and said Lo this had touched
[5:39] thy lips and thine iniquity is taken
[5:41] away and thy sin purged amen also I
[5:46] heard the voice of the Lord saying whom
[5:48] shall I send and who will go for us yes
[5:51] then said I here am I am I send me
[5:55] hallelujah amen amen and we can say
[5:58] tonight here am I
[6:00] send me amen you may be seated at this
[6:02] time may the Lord add blessings to the
[6:04] reading of his word amen that is why I
[6:06] ask Pastor to sing that song Amen
[6:09] because we can stand like Isaiah and say
[6:11] when the coal of fire had touched us
[6:13] amen he cleansed us hallelujah amen we
[6:16] are now purged amen and now we can say
[6:19] Lord here am I send me amen and the Lord
[6:22] is asking whom shall I send who will go
[6:26] for us yes
[6:28] amen amen so for a title we just want to
[6:32] speak
[6:33] on Whose Glory will you share
[6:36] in amen whose Glory will you share in
[6:40] amen so we see Isaiah here was one of
[6:43] the Major Prophets amen and Isaiah the
[6:46] book of Isaiah is an important book
[6:48] because the prophet tells us that the
[6:50] entire book of Isaiah is a full
[6:53] commentary of the Bible yes yes amen
[6:56] amen and no no one else knows that but
[6:58] we know that because the prophet told
[6:59] us amen amen it's like you know when you
[7:02] go to university and only the lecture
[7:04] can tell you exactly which study guy to
[7:07] get amen amen the study guide that has
[7:09] exactly what's coming out in the exams
[7:11] amen so if if Isaiah the book of Isaiah
[7:15] is the commentary then if we want to see
[7:18] the pattern of the glory of the Lord
[7:19] then we can find it in Isaiah amen amen
[7:23] you see Isaiah despite being a prophet
[7:26] with the word of the Lord because we
[7:28] know the word of the Lord comes to the
[7:31] Prophet The Prophet William Bram tells
[7:34] us that Isaiah had been leaning too much
[7:35] on the great king
[7:38] Isaiah you know but God took Isaiah away
[7:41] from him and when God took Isaiah away
[7:45] Isaiah the prophet was down in his
[7:49] Spirit now you can try and find this I
[7:52] could be wrong but I've tried to find
[7:54] this in the Bible where it talks about
[7:56] Isaiah and Uzziah being so close and and
[7:59] and his desire being so depressed and
[8:00] all of these things but you won't find
[8:02] it Well I I certainly did not find it
[8:04] but the prophet tells us this amen so
[8:08] you know the prophet in this day we are
[8:09] a prophet that will come and shed light
[8:11] and read in between the lines and give
[8:13] us the secret messages in between the
[8:15] lines amen and when the prophet does
[8:18] something like this we need to pay
[8:19] attention amen because it means if God
[8:21] didn't show it to the nominal Christian
[8:23] he's only showing it to us it means
[8:25] there's a reason behind it correct amen
[8:27] amen so the prophet begins with tell us
[8:29] that there was this great relationship
[8:31] between the prophet Isaiah and King
[8:34] Uzziah so much so that the prophet tells
[8:38] us that King oziah was very fond of
[8:39] Isaiah yes so much so that King oziah
[8:42] used to do things for Isaiah the prophet
[8:45] he used to help him out perhaps
[8:48] financially perhaps be an encouragement
[8:50] to him because the prophet tells us that
[8:52] King oiah was a very righteous man and
[8:56] the prophet Isaiah being a young Prophet
[8:58] took life liken to him yes he saw an
[9:01] upright King a righteous man and he
[9:04] began to be influenced by King oziah in
[9:08] a good way not in a negative way but in
[9:10] a good way he has a righteous man he has
[9:12] a good
[9:16] influence but you see they come a time
[9:18] when the prophet Isaiah begin to rely
[9:21] too much on his influence from King
[9:24] oiah and then King oziah did something
[9:28] that was not right
[9:29] because King oziah then started to take
[9:32] the place of a priest yes and he came
[9:35] into the Temple of the Lord and he took
[9:37] the sensor the golden sensor and wanted
[9:39] to offer up sacrifices and do the job of
[9:42] a priest which is contrary to the word
[9:45] because we know this was left to the
[9:46] levitical order amen yes and when King
[9:51] Uzziah did this the priest approached
[9:54] him the high priest approached him and
[9:57] they begin to tell him what you're doing
[9:58] is in correct yes what you are doing is
[10:01] against the word of God Amen and when
[10:04] they did this King oziah began to be
[10:06] become upset with them because he was
[10:09] elevated now as the king yes amen and he
[10:12] thought himself a righteous man which he
[10:14] was but because of being elevated he
[10:17] started to get upset with them and
[10:18] instead of taking correction amen he got
[10:21] very rot with them yes amen and the
[10:24] Bible tells us that when he began to
[10:26] become upset with them leprosy struck
[10:28] him
[10:29] yes and in their presence they begin to
[10:32] see the leprosy forming on his face
[10:35] amen and so the prophet Isaiah began to
[10:38] see this and for the rest of King
[10:40] Isaiah's days he perished away in
[10:43] leprosy and so Isaiah couldn't
[10:45] understand how this righteous King this
[10:47] great king could have such a fall and
[10:50] the prophet tells us that this taken
[10:51] such an effect on him yes
[10:55] amen the prophet says talking about King
[10:58] oziah and then the minister tried to
[11:00] correct him we find out that four score
[11:04] priests besides the high priests come
[11:06] after him and told him sir in other
[11:08] words like this God has blessed you
[11:11] you're an honored man you're a great man
[11:14] and God is blessed you in your work but
[11:16] you shouldn't do that getting off the
[11:18] beatin road Prophet goes on to say now
[11:21] watch my brethren be careful because no
[11:24] matter how much God has filled you with
[11:25] his
[11:26] spirit amen here is where we got to be
[11:29] careful no matter how much God has
[11:31] filled us with his Spirit no matter how
[11:33] much that you've done and how you've
[11:35] been blessed you stay with the calling
[11:37] of God don't get off on some tradition
[11:40] and organizational schemes and so forth
[11:43] you better come back to the path you
[11:45] better come back to what God laid down
[11:47] in the beginning amen and here's where
[11:49] we in the message got to be careful
[11:51] because we've been filled with the
[11:52] spirit we've got the word of the Lord
[11:54] but we got to stay on the right path am
[11:56] yes amen and the prophet goes was on to
[11:59] say now we find out that this man when
[12:00] he was corrected instead of humbl
[12:03] himself and admitting the word that was
[12:05] right and God was right he became angry
[12:09] in other words he was ready to kick him
[12:10] out of his organization he was very
[12:13] upset very perplexed and know he got
[12:16] angry and he to turn around and say now
[12:19] just wait a minute do you realize who I
[12:21] am so the prophet is dramatizing this
[12:23] ver now I wonder sometimes a man you
[12:26] know when the rebuke is coming from the
[12:27] pulpit like it was on Sunday you know I
[12:31] wonder sometimes if we can humble
[12:33] ourselves and say Lord I take correction
[12:36] amen you instead of getting angry within
[12:38] ourselves or getting upset with the
[12:40] minister or getting upset that we are
[12:43] being rebuked but we can humble
[12:45] ourselves and say Lord I take correction
[12:48] notice that God never Strike King oziah
[12:51] with Leprosy when he went against the
[12:53] word and he started to do the duty of
[12:54] the priest he struck him with Leprosy
[12:57] when he got angry at the priest for
[12:58] correcting
[13:00] him because we all subject to mistakes
[13:03] we can do something wrong can have a
[13:04] wrong thought or anything like that and
[13:06] God is ready to forgive us amen but when
[13:09] God is giving you a rebuke and his
[13:11] rebuke is chastisement which is love
[13:14] amen through the fivefold ministry we
[13:17] got to be careful that we don't resent
[13:19] that amen amen we got to be careful that
[13:21] we don't now get into the Realms of the
[13:23] Judgment of the Lord amen because when
[13:25] the Lord is sending a rebuke it's Mercy
[13:27] for us because why he said we have
[13:29] escaped the great day of judgment
[13:30] because we receive judgment here amen
[13:33] amen judgment first at the house of the
[13:35] Lord amen so King Isaiah got struck with
[13:38] Leprosy when he got angry amen so that
[13:41] is why we should not come into that
[13:43] condition help us Lord amen amen so now
[13:46] back to the story King Isaiah was so
[13:48] influenced by this King he got taken up
[13:51] in the glory of this King yes but there
[13:54] had to come a time when the glory of
[13:57] this King started to fade yes andah
[14:00] needed to be caught up into a realm
[14:02] where he could see the glory of the king
[14:04] of kings the one whose Glory Would Not
[14:07] Fade Away amen amen now let's let's see
[14:10] the picture of this king of glory and
[14:13] Isaiah paints this picture in Isaiah
[14:15] chapter
[14:20] 6 now the Bible says in Isaiah chap 6
[14:24] that when Isaiah was caught into the
[14:26] presence of the Lord he says he strained
[14:28] full the
[14:29] temple and the prophet tells us what
[14:31] that is is the angels of the Lord the
[14:34] train filling the temple the prophet
[14:36] says that that is the angels of the Lord
[14:38] and now in this time where is the Temple
[14:41] of the lord we are the Temple of the
[14:43] Lord and his train fills the temple
[14:46] because the angels of the Lord are
[14:47] gathered with us amen you see the angel
[14:50] of the Lord fills the
[14:51] temple Isaiah is seen this p in heaven
[14:55] you see but he we we are the real living
[14:59] Temple of the Living God amen amen amen
[15:01] so the angels of the Lord are with us
[15:03] amen now this can be two things it can
[15:07] be like when the Bible says our Angels
[15:10] do behold the face of our fathers and
[15:12] the prophet tells us that that is our
[15:13] theop amen amen that is also Angelic
[15:16] beings that are with us amen protecting
[15:19] us as we go along the day Journey being
[15:22] here at the pulit when the minister is
[15:23] ministering amen at your at your bedside
[15:27] amen when you are sick amen the angel of
[15:29] the Lord is being sent when the prayers
[15:30] of the Saints are being made for you
[15:33] amen Rafa is being sent amen why because
[15:36] you are the Temple of the Living God and
[15:38] fills the temple yes hallelujah amen
[15:43] praise the Lord and what did we say the
[15:45] glory of the Lord is it's the Holy Ghost
[15:47] In You amen and what is the Holy Ghost
[15:50] we know that the angel of the Lord is
[15:51] the Holy Ghost see chain fills the
[15:54] temple the Holy Ghost fills you hallelu
[15:56] which is the Temple of the Living God
[15:58] Amen
[16:01] you know I wonder if we can see a type
[16:03] here you know before
[16:06] 2023 and all through the decades you
[16:09] know that we've been in the message
[16:11] there have been great influences in the
[16:13] message you know we had big great names
[16:15] in the message that people look up to
[16:18] Big ministers that people look up to and
[16:20] didn't want to accept any teaching from
[16:22] any other minister but only stuck with a
[16:24] certain teaching of a certain
[16:26] Minister it's kind of like is z so
[16:29] influenced by this King yes yeah
[16:31] influenced by a
[16:33] man and you notice that throughout
[16:37] 2023 the topic that we are speaking
[16:39] about is the supernatural the angel of
[16:41] the Lord moving amen amen and he started
[16:44] to shift our attention away from man
[16:47] amen because you notice the ministry
[16:49] kept on laboring and said that the
[16:50] minister the ministry is not yet to
[16:52] benefit itself it's yet to equip the
[16:54] people so take the focus out of man yes
[16:58] amen so for the all of 23 we had that so
[17:01] much so that that Spirit of having a
[17:04] manly influence was killed in 2023 am so
[17:07] we can enter into
[17:09] 2024 see the glory of the king amen no
[17:12] longer the glory of a certain Minister
[17:14] the glory of a certain influence but now
[17:17] we can be caught up in the glory of
[17:18] Hallelujah and we ourselves can share in
[17:21] His Glory thank you Lord amen hallelujah
[17:24] Lord so that Spirit was slain in 2023
[17:27] amk King oah had to die than you in
[17:30] order for Isaiah to see the king of
[17:32] glory isah had to die so all the
[17:35] influences had to die
[17:38] hallelujah oh you think the word was
[17:40] coming just for nothing throughout the
[17:41] whole 2023 week in week out slaying each
[17:45] Spirit slaying every
[17:47] influence why because you are a people
[17:49] that ought to be free amen amen let's
[17:52] just pause for a moment praise the
[17:53] Lorden hallelujah hallelujah bless your
[17:56] name oh god oh bless your name Jesus
[18:00] bless be your
[18:03] name oh we don't have to be fixed on any
[18:06] man anymore see it used it used to be we
[18:09] needed some anointed guest speaker to
[18:10] come down and read us like 100 quotes
[18:13] and confuse our minds it used to be that
[18:15] way and we should be so intrigued hey
[18:17] look at how deep this minister is but
[18:20] that is now a Time Gone by because now
[18:23] the individuals sh the glory of the Lord
[18:26] yes Lord the individuals are filled with
[18:28] power amen yes oh
[18:31] God thank
[18:33] you see Moses as well though he was a
[18:37] prophet D did so many Supernatural
[18:39] things but there had to come a time when
[18:42] he said Show Me Your Glory he had
[18:45] experienced all the
[18:47] supernatural Moses had done the
[18:49] supernatural but there had to come a
[18:51] time when Moses said Lord Show Me Your
[18:53] Glory he had to come a time when he
[18:56] needed what he had was not sufficient
[18:59] enough he needed to see the glory of the
[19:02] Lord and you see we we started the end
[19:05] of 2023 talking about sharing in the
[19:08] glory of the
[19:09] Lord on our watch Night Service we spoke
[19:12] on sharing the in the glory of the
[19:14] Lord and we are heading into
[19:18] 2024 where the Lord is bringing us into
[19:20] his glory amen yes now you might say
[19:24] yeah these guys go again with their
[19:25] numbers the whole of 2023 we spoke about
[19:28] the number 23 and not 24 just started
[19:32] and we only speaking about the number
[19:34] 24 amen but let me make it a little bit
[19:36] more crazy for you how many of you know
[19:38] what's the date
[19:39] today the 24th of January
[19:43] 2024 and what is the glory of the Lord
[19:47] we know that in the Bible when Solomon
[19:49] was dedicating the temple the glory the
[19:51] Shak glory of the Lord came down even
[19:54] when Moses was dedicating the Tabernacle
[19:56] the glory of the Lord came down it was
[19:58] the the pull of fire and the pull of
[19:59] cloud and exactly 74 years today on the
[20:03] 24th of January the glory of the Lord
[20:07] firsty for the first time was captured
[20:10] Hallelujah by the camera lens for the
[20:13] first time the glory of the Lord was
[20:15] taken out on a photograph as evidence
[20:18] Undisputed evidence when on the 24th of
[20:21] January 74 years today amen so you see
[20:25] we're not just talking about numbers the
[20:27] Lord works this way yes amen the Lord
[20:29] shows his patterns in the
[20:32] Bible but some may call it
[20:35] fism but for those of you who catch it
[20:37] it's glory amen yes
[20:40] Hallelujah now you see Isaiah he was a
[20:43] prophet we know that he wrote the
[20:44] commentary of the Bible but there had to
[20:47] come a time as well for Isaiah when he
[20:49] needed to see the real presence of the L
[20:51] of the Lord he needed to see the real
[20:53] glory of the Lord yes the prophet says
[20:55] Isaiah saw Visions he was a the prophet
[20:59] Isaiah preached the word he was a
[21:00] minister Isaiah was a holy man but and
[21:03] this is all that we was throughout all
[21:06] the years in the message but one day
[21:08] standing in the temple he fell into a
[21:10] trance and he saw the glory of God Amen
[21:13] he saw the angel with wings over their
[21:15] face oh look at how the reverence comes
[21:18] in the presence of the Lord in the glory
[21:21] of the Lord and if we say that we want
[21:23] to experience the glory of the Lord how
[21:25] do we experience without coming with the
[21:27] same reverence yes with the same
[21:29] approach whether it's in our worship
[21:31] whether it's in our day to-day living
[21:33] whether it's coming into the house of
[21:34] the Lord we have to come with the same
[21:37] reverence these angels crying holy holy
[21:40] you know just a thought we always say
[21:43] that the angels will not know what we
[21:45] singing about when we singing Redemption
[21:47] Song and we we always saying you know we
[21:49] have a greater song than the Angels cuz
[21:51] it's a song of
[21:53] redemption but if you look at the
[21:56] Angels if if if if the way we worship
[22:00] Now is better than this worship then
[22:03] there's something wrong I'm talking
[22:05] about the level of what we are
[22:06] worshiping now you've seen it week in
[22:07] week out how we struggling to break
[22:09] through in worship it cannot be that
[22:11] that worship is greater than the angels
[22:13] of worship there ought to be a level
[22:15] higher than that there ought to be a
[22:17] worship higher than that when the Angels
[22:20] begin to cover their face Angels who
[22:23] knew not sin begin to cover their
[22:26] feet oh how much more we are to come
[22:28] into the presence of the Lord amen we
[22:31] who knew sin we who was dead in
[22:34] trespasses but the Lord had quickened us
[22:37] up amen washed Us in his blood amen he
[22:40] left his glory amen and he come down
[22:43] amen oh he come down to be born in a
[22:46] stable how much more we got to worship
[22:49] him how much more we got to our worship
[22:51] got to be better oh if we can just paint
[22:54] that picture of how we are to worship
[22:55] him I can tell you when John began to
[22:58] see that the lamb was worthy he said
[23:00] everyone heard me amen hey the way he
[23:03] began to shout the way he began to
[23:05] scream he said everyone heard my voice
[23:08] amen so when the word is open to us
[23:11] there ought to be a different kind of
[23:12] worship yes amen amen
[23:16] hallelujah Prophet says a prophet a
[23:19] mightiest prophet of the Bible one of
[23:21] them talking about Isaiah but he says I
[23:24] am a man with unclean lips and I dwell
[23:26] among people that that that has unclean
[23:29] lips wo is me because I see the glory of
[23:32] God Amen the prophet says we find that
[23:35] in the presence of God men recognize
[23:37] themselves to be Sinners when we come
[23:40] into the glory of the Lord yes he says
[23:43] then we realize how little we are when
[23:45] we realize how great he is amen and how
[23:48] close we come in the to come in the
[23:50] presence somehow or another it's always
[23:53] throw a great effect upon people to come
[23:55] in the presence of of God
[23:58] the prophet says I've seen the time in
[24:00] my Ministry when you would see the
[24:01] presence of God come into the place and
[24:04] call out their sins of all kinds of
[24:06] immoral acts and bring such a holy hush
[24:10] amongst the people till they drop out of
[24:12] the prayer line before they ever come up
[24:14] to be prayed for run to the Altar and
[24:16] get right with God before they come up
[24:18] into his presence oh Hallelujah if we
[24:22] could come with the same
[24:23] approach amen look at the reverence when
[24:26] when people begin to feel the glory of
[24:28] the Lord they were standing in the
[24:29] prayer line waiting to be prayed for but
[24:31] when the glory of the Lord came down
[24:33] they felt undone so much so they left
[24:35] the prayer line they went to the Altar
[24:37] and began to confess their sins oh
[24:40] sometimes I feel that we forgot how to
[24:42] come to the altar amen amen some of us
[24:44] forgot how to weep in the presence of
[24:46] the Lord amen we forgot why because we
[24:49] need to come into that Glory realm where
[24:52] we can be like a z and say Lord wo is me
[24:55] amen I'm a man of unclean lips
[24:59] amen the prophet said talking about
[25:01] another Minister he preached the gospel
[25:04] in such a way till he stood in Boston in
[25:06] a little bay window because there was no
[25:09] church could hold his crowd and he stood
[25:11] there with such a mighty force and
[25:13] preached hell such a place until working
[25:16] men with their baskets under their arms
[25:18] fell into the street screamed for mercy
[25:20] in the presence of God great preachers
[25:23] who's been able by the word of God to
[25:24] bring the presence of God to an audience
[25:28] oh and we have great preachers amen now
[25:30] that can bring the presence of God down
[25:32] if you could only tap into it be the
[25:35] prophet says far be it that man would
[25:37] ever be so seared in their hearts till
[25:39] they could never recognize the presence
[25:41] of God far be it oh my I wonder I wonder
[25:45] when we hear the preaching weak in and
[25:47] weak out about the glory of the Lord and
[25:50] about his presence and about the angel
[25:52] of the Lord whether our hearts are
[25:54] already so seared that we could never
[25:56] recognize the presence of God amongst us
[25:59] the prophet says far be it from that oh
[26:02] far be it from The Message Church not
[26:04] recognizing the presence of the Lord
[26:06] amen far be that they are so Str strong
[26:09] held in Tradition that they can cannot
[26:11] recognize the glory of the Lord amen oh
[26:15] amen has latest year become so strong
[26:18] and influence Upon
[26:19] Us amen that that a minister can stand
[26:22] here dangling the toys amongst us and we
[26:25] and we stand unfazed we're not
[26:28] interested like the prophet talks about
[26:30] that boy you could Dazzle the toy in
[26:31] front of him and he would not be phased
[26:34] by it oh I hope that we in the message
[26:36] have not come to that amen the prophet
[26:39] says far be from
[26:43] that how can it be that way if we are
[26:46] seated together in Heavenly places amen
[26:50] how can we be lwam yes if we say we are
[26:53] in the glory of the Lord then how can we
[26:55] be in that condition yes Lord
[27:02] the prophet goes on to say in Exodus 3
[27:04] we find that Moses we saw that Isaiah
[27:07] felt undone right the prophet says Moses
[27:09] the great servant and the prophet of God
[27:12] when he was on the back side of the
[27:14] desert the man was a holy man he had
[27:17] been born for that purpose he was born
[27:19] from his mother's home to be a prophet
[27:22] he had tried to get his education and do
[27:24] everything he could to deliver his
[27:26] people and going down he knowed them
[27:29] from an intellectual standpoint talking
[27:31] about all the promises of God he know
[27:33] the promises of God from an intellectual
[27:35] standpoint he'd been thought all of the
[27:37] promises of God and he was a great
[27:39] military man but one day on the backside
[27:42] of the desert when he come into the
[27:44] presence of God he jued off his shoes
[27:46] and fell to his feet knowing that he was
[27:49] on Holy Ground amen you see what I'm
[27:52] trying to show you the behavior of holy
[27:54] men when they come into the glory of the
[27:56] Lord amen recognize oh he could not
[27:59] stand upon his feet when he come into
[28:01] the presence of God Amen he fell to his
[28:03] face like Abraham did he could not stand
[28:06] in the presence of
[28:08] God oh Hallelujah but when God come down
[28:12] the top of Mount Si and the whole
[28:14] Mountain caught on fire and the smoke
[28:17] was flying from it like a furnace and
[28:19] the voice of God roared out Israel fell
[28:21] on their face and said let Moses speak
[28:23] yes and not God lest we die man in the
[28:27] presence of God realizes he's a sinner
[28:30] yet they were everyone circumcised unto
[28:32] the law they had carried out the
[28:34] Commandments and everything but when God
[28:37] spoke and they moved up in into his
[28:39] presence they realized that they were
[28:42] out they were not right there was
[28:45] something that was lacking yes because
[28:48] they were now now do you see why the
[28:50] whole of 2023 we've been building up
[28:52] consecration getting our lives right
[28:55] there was something that was lacking all
[28:56] these years
[28:59] because we're getting ready to come into
[29:00] the presence of the Lord yes and they
[29:03] said let Moses speak and not God for if
[29:06] God speaks we'll die let Moses
[29:12] speak amen just like Isaiah said woe is
[29:15] me yes you see holy man recognize
[29:19] themselves sinners in the presence of
[29:20] God Amen and the prophet says what if if
[29:24] holy men recognize themselves as sinners
[29:26] in the presence of of God what will the
[29:28] Sinner and ungodly do at that day what
[29:32] will people do who sit in the meeting

[29:40] countdown on the word that's seen God
[29:42] manifest himself and beyond a shadow of
[29:45] Doubt every scripture fulfilled and will
[29:47] still try to make it to heaven without
[29:49] being born again and receive the Holy
[29:51] Ghost the Bible said if a righteous man
[29:53] be scarcely
[29:55] saved where will the an ungodly appear
[29:59] what kind of a place are we going to
[30:01] stand if we see God unfold himself right

[30:05] are coming to a place where God is
[30:07] unfolding his glory right before us amen
[30:10] and we see the glory of God just the
[30:12] same as he as them men did that kind of
[30:16] men Cried Out prophets and sages upon
[30:18] whom the word is based upon if they
[30:21] cried and fell to their feet and
[30:22] screamed I'm a man of Unholy lips

[30:28] man who won't even confess his
[30:30] sins oh what will it be for the teenager

[30:35] prophet is saying what will it be for
[30:36] the teenager that won't confess his or
[30:38] her sins what will it be for the
[30:41] hard-hearted man that thinks he knows
[30:42] more about God's creation than God does
[30:46] himself what will happen to that man
[30:48] that spent all of his life trying to
[30:50] disprove the
[30:51] Bible what will believe what will happen
[30:54] to unbelieve the sign that spend all the

[31:35] ourselves Lord we have to come into the
[31:37] glory of the Lord ourselves there ought
[31:39] not to be any reason why we should not
[31:41] enter into the glory of the Lord and now
[31:43] the prophet will tell us
[31:45] why the prophet says repented sinners
[31:48] now not Sinners but repented
[31:51] Sinners doesn't have any fear oh no a
[31:54] sinner that will repent he knows that
[31:57] there's a bloody sacrifice waiting to
[31:59] stand in his place this is how we enter
[32:01] into the glory of the Lord now that's
[32:04] what gives me the consolation I've seen
[32:06] the glory of God I've felt his power I
[32:09] know the touch of his hand I know the
[32:12] touch the touch of his chastisement I
[32:14] know that is God and I know I'm undone
[32:18] but there is one that's standing there
[32:19] for me amen aren't you thankful for that
[32:22] there's one who stands there says father
[32:24] lay all of his inequity upon me or we
[32:27] can say thank you Jesus because he stood
[32:30] for me down on the earth then I walked
[32:33] to the throne of God Amen like ision I
[32:35] was caught up into the throne room of
[32:37] God boldly having Grace in my heart to
[32:40] know it's not by good works but by his
[32:42] mercy and saved amen yes amen hallelujah
[32:46] yes praise the Lord you know it's like
[32:49] back then only the high priest could
[32:51] enter into the holiest of holies it was
[32:53] death for anyone else to enter yes but
[32:56] today to stay away from the holiest of
[32:58] holies is death see now we have to come
[33:01] into the holiest of holies where the
[33:03] Shak glory is amen cuz that's where the
[33:06] glory of the Lord was it was in the
[33:07] holiest of holiest and I tell you if you
[33:10] come into the shakina glory in the
[33:13] holiest of holies they cannot be any
[33:15] dried up person
[33:17] there aon's Rod started to B to life in
[33:20] the sh glory of the Lord that is why so
[33:23] many people are dried up they need to
[33:25] come into the sh glory of the Lord amen
[33:28] and then you start to Bear the fruits
[33:31] because you start to B in the glory of
[33:32] the Lord hallelujah amen you see how
[33:35] important it is to be in the glory of
[33:37] the Lord
[33:39] amen you see you can't say that you are
[33:41] living in the glory of the Lord and
[33:43] you're not bearing fruit amen because in
[33:46] the glory of the Lord the fruit starts
[33:48] to come hallelujah amen hallelujah you
[33:51] see the Fig Tree could not recognize the
[33:53] glory of the Lord standing before it and
[33:56] because of that it was dried up yes so
[33:59] the glory of the Lord can be right there
[34:01] but if it's unrecognized it will have no
[34:02] effect on you absolutely it has to be
[34:05] recognized you see so it's your part to
[34:08] recognize the glory of the Lord
[34:10] amen
[34:13] hallelujah the prophet is such a person
[34:16] and such a man such a time and how they
[34:19] felt we have also ourselves we've seen
[34:22] the glory of God like these men did sure
[34:26] we've seen it we've seen the glory of
[34:27] God like Abraham saw it we saw the glory
[34:30] of God like Moses saw it same Pillar of
[34:32] Fire the same power of God the same
[34:34] Christ revealing himself showing himself
[34:37] keeping his word in the last day how can
[34:40] we come by then and walk and treat it so
[34:42] lightly oh yes the rebuke come into the
[34:45] church how can we walk and treated so
[34:48] lightly how can we let the spirit of
[34:50] latery and make us so
[34:52] relaxed amen amen when we've seen the
[34:54] glory of God Amen and I'm not only
[34:56] talking about 50 years
[34:58] ago I'm talking about right here in our
[35:01] assembly we've seen the glory of the
[35:03] Lord amen so let us not walk and treat
[35:07] it lightly
[35:11] amen amen back to Isaiah chapter
[35:14] 6 verse 6 then flew one of the seraps
[35:18] unto me having a live call in his hand
[35:21] which he had taken with the the tongs
[35:24] from off the altar verse 7 and he laid
[35:27] it upon my mouth and said Lo this had
[35:29] touched my lips and thine iniquity is
[35:32] taken away and thy sin purged also I
[35:35] heard the voice of the Lord saying whom
[35:36] shall I send and who will go for us then
[35:39] said I here am I send me now this sounds
[35:43] very similar to Mark 16 and Revelation
[35:47] 108-111 you see Isiah found himself
[35:50] undone and the angel take the co of fire
[35:53] and put it on his lips and purged him
[35:55] yes and after this was was done then the
[35:57] Lord said who will go for us and hisai
[35:59] said here am I send me Amen in
[36:02] Revelation
[36:04] 108-111 when John goes and takes the
[36:06] book and it enters his mouth amen he is
[36:09] now purged amen he's now cleansed and
[36:12] now he's told to go and prophesy again
[36:15] to Nations kindreds and tongues amen
[36:18] Mark 16 says go out preaching the gospel
[36:20] amen amen and he tells us the signs that
[36:23] we ought to do because this shows the
[36:24] glory of the Lord we've been through the
[36:26] past has been to the courts over the
[36:28] last 3 weeks when you go out in Mark 16
[36:31] and you showing the glory of the
[36:33] Lord amen it's similar to Isaiah who
[36:37] says who will go for us and Isaiah says
[36:39] Lord send me yes amen we've got to come
[36:42] to that place in order for us to be sent
[36:45] out in order for us to fulfill our part
[36:47] of revelation
[36:49] 108-111 we need to experience the glory
[36:51] of the Lord amen because then if we
[36:54] don't we don't have something that we
[36:56] can take to the people
[36:58] yes you see when when when Peter and
[37:01] John was passing by the gate beautiful
[37:03] and they healed this uh man or
[37:05] it was the blind
[37:08] man and then after he healed them
[37:10] everyone started to gather around them
[37:12] and then he started to preach Jesus
[37:13] Christ to
[37:14] them but if he if they never heal him if
[37:17] the glory of of God never portrayed
[37:20] through them and heal him they would
[37:22] have not have a cause to preach Jesus to
[37:24] them yes they would have been no Victory
[37:27] to show to them that Jesus Christ is
[37:30] resurrected but when you have the glory
[37:32] of God within you and you can display
[37:35] the glory of God then you can preach
[37:37] Jesus Christ amen then you can preach
[37:39] the Lord is coming amen then you can
[37:41] have an effective Ministry hallelujah
[37:43] amen and the bride we know has a
[37:45] Ministry
[37:47] [Music]
[37:50] yes the prophet says when you come into
[37:53] His presence you have a great
[37:55] responsibility amen it says look at that
[37:57] lady talking about the woman at the well
[38:00] she couldn't stay no longer she went to
[38:02] the city and told them told the man come
[38:04] see the man that told me the things I've
[38:06] done isn't this the Messiah they could
[38:09] not deny it because it was scriptural
[38:12] certainly yes they've got to do it a man
[38:15] we when we got a responsibility of
[38:17] telling others as Moses did as Peter did
[38:21] as Paul did after these things you've
[38:23] seen it and you've come into the into
[38:26] his pray
[38:27] you're responsible for the message to
[38:29] get to somebody else amen you see it's
[38:32] not just about experiencing the glory of
[38:34] the Lord for yourself but when you come
[38:36] into His into his presence then the
[38:38] responsibility is on you amen you can't
[38:41] just keep quiet at work anymore you
[38:44] can't just keep quiet amen you got to be
[38:46] responsible for telling someone else yes
[38:49] Lord amen but that's only when you come
[38:51] into His presence amen
[38:54] amen oh thank you
[38:57] Isaiah 6:9 and he said go and tell this
[39:00] people he indeed but understand not and
[39:03] see indeed but perceive not make the
[39:07] heart of this people fat and make their
[39:09] eyes heavy and shut their eyes lest they
[39:12] see with their eyes and hear with their
[39:13] ears and understand with their heart and
[39:16] con convert and be healed now can you
[39:18] see the type there again with our
[39:20] ministry Souls Lost in prison yes we are
[39:23] to preach to them but their eyes are
[39:25] shut amen but our job is to preach to
[39:28] them you see Isaiah is just showing us
[39:29] the whole pattern amen because Isaiah is
[39:32] the full commentary
[39:35] yes now we find that in the Bible
[39:37] whenever the temple is built the Shak
[39:40] Glory needs to fill the Tabernacle yes
[39:43] otherwise it's just brick and mortar
[39:46] amen even we I read to you Exodus 40 the
[39:50] other week amen because Moses first saw
[39:53] the pattern and Moses then starts to
[39:55] build the Tabernacle intense according
[39:57] to how he saw the pattern and then the
[39:59] temple that Solomon built was after the
[40:01] pattern of what Moses saw amen so when
[40:03] Moses is building this pattern in Exodus
[40:06] 40 and I told you how we typed the first
[40:08] Sunday of this year in our
[40:10] church when Moses is doing this he
[40:13] starts to get everything in order first
[40:16] he starts to consecrate everyone he
[40:18] starts to anoint everyone he anoints the
[40:20] priest he gets the order in
[40:23] place and when he does this
[40:27] in verse chapter 33 it says and he
[40:30] reared up the court round about the
[40:32] Tabernacle verse 33 of chapter
[40:36] 40 and the Altar and set up the hanging
[40:39] of the Court gate and it says so Moses
[40:42] finished the work so after Moses had
[40:45] finished building this
[40:47] Tabernacle then now9 verse 34 then a
[40:50] cloud covered the tent of the
[40:52] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[40:54] filled the Tabernacle Moses was not able
[40:57] to enter into the tent of the
[40:59] congregation because the cloud Abode
[41:01] thereon and the glory of the Lord filled
[41:03] the Tabernacle amen amen amen and it
[41:06] goes on to say when the cloud moved then
[41:08] they moved when the cloud didn't move
[41:09] they didn't
[41:10] move so you see once the temple is built
[41:14] like when Solomon finished building the
[41:16] Temple then the Shak glory of the Lord
[41:18] drops down
[41:20] amen amen and we know that throughout
[41:24] seven Church ages God has been building
[41:26] a temple amen yes amen but the glory of
[41:30] the Lord couldn't fall down all through
[41:33] seven Church ages while God was still
[41:34] building the
[41:35] Tabernacle while God was building the
[41:37] Temple but there has to come a time when
[41:40] the temple is complete being
[41:42] built we can't be building for years and
[41:45] years and years and years there has to
[41:46] come a time the prophet says as she
[41:48] nears him she'll be so much like him
[41:51] amen it will be like a glove the prophet
[41:53] say the capsule will come and just foit
[41:55] on Amen amen amen so we still building
[41:58] the Tabernacle or is the temple built
[41:59] already because the Lord is fixing to
[42:01] come yes amen the the temple has to be
[42:04] built amen just like how the Lord when
[42:07] the Lord is getting ready to return to
[42:09] Jews they want to build their Temple oh
[42:11] yes so if the Lord is fixing to come for
[42:13] us the Tabernacle has to be built
[42:15] already so that the glory of the Lord
[42:17] can fill this place amen hallelujah so
[42:21] you see why last year we had to go
[42:22] through a consecration consecration
[42:24] setting things in order because the
[42:26] temple has to be completed amen and now
[42:29] we can say the temple is ready am
[42:31] because why you and I are the Temple of
[42:33] the Living God Amen we can say I am the
[42:36] Temple of the Living God lord fill me
[42:38] with your glory amen fill me with your
[42:40] Shak Glory because that's the pattern in
[42:42] the Bible if you did it back then in the
[42:44] Bible you have to do it now abolutely
[42:46] amen amen if the glory of the Lord is
[42:48] not filling you up it means your temple
[42:50] is not built yet
[42:52] amen
[42:55] amen hallelujah
[42:58] amen amen you see for seven Church ages
[43:01] God was building up the virtues we've
[43:03] been through all this the last few
[43:05] weeks God was building up all the the
[43:08] things that needed to be done yes you
[43:10] notice when Solomon was building the
[43:12] Temple they begin to bring stones from
[43:14] each different Province they started to
[43:16] get all these different vessels from
[43:17] each different Province why because it's
[43:19] a universal bride amen the Temple of the
[43:22] Lord is coming from each different
[43:23] country being built up being built up
[43:25] yes holy vessels amen the Bible says
[43:28] holy vessels hallelujah amen let's read
[43:31] Amen in in in
[43:38] Solomon for some reason here I didn't
[43:40] mark the chapter but you can maybe
[43:42] search for it it says then Solomon
[43:44] assembled the Elders of Israel verse
[43:49] one I'll read it in the meantime then
[43:51] Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel
[43:54] and all the heads of the tribes
[43:56] the chief of the fathers of the children
[43:59] of
[44:01] Israel andto King Solomon in Jerusalem
[44:05] that they might bring up the Ark of the
[44:06] Covenant of the Lord out of the city of
[44:08] David which is Zion we know that's the
[44:10] word of the
[44:11] Lord and all the men of Israel assembled
[44:14] themselves together unto King Solomon at
[44:17] the feast in the month of eam which is
[44:20] the seven
[44:21] month amen you see the temple is getting
[44:24] ready and finalized in the seven Church
[44:26] age amen and all the Elders of Israel
[44:29] came and the priests took up the ark and
[44:31] they brought up the Ark of the Lord and
[44:33] the Tabernacle of the congregation and
[44:36] all the holy
[44:37] vessels see those holy vessels are a
[44:40] type of these holy vessels yes amen that
[44:43] way in the Tabernacle even those did the
[44:45] priest and the Levites bring
[44:47] up and King Solomon and all the
[44:50] congregation of Israel that were
[44:51] assembled unto him were with him before
[44:54] the ark sacrificing sheep sheep and oxen
[44:57] they could not be told or numbered and
[44:59] the priest brought in the Ark of the
[45:01] Covenant of the Lord into his place into
[45:04] the Oracle of the house to the most holy
[45:07] Place amen the the the Ark of the
[45:09] Covenant was brought into the holiest of
[45:11] holiest amen that is why the the word of
[45:14] the Lord can't only come down into your
[45:16] flesh it can't only drop down into your
[45:18] spirit it has to drop down into the
[45:20] holiest of holies which is your soul
[45:22] because we remember Moses saw the
[45:24] pattern in heaven but if we the temple
[45:26] we also have three parts amen the outer
[45:28] cord the inner court and the holiest of
[45:30] holies which is our soul and the Ark of
[45:33] the Covenant which the word of the Lord
[45:35] has to drop down in our soul
[45:37] amen under the wings of the sherub
[45:40] that's where the angels are amen yeah
[45:42] down in the holiest of
[45:44] holiest for the sheram spread forth
[45:46] their two Wings over the place of the
[45:48] Ark and the sheram cover the ark and the
[45:51] stares they off above amen let's drop
[45:54] down
[45:57] verse 10 and it came to pass when the
[45:58] priests were come out of the Holy Place
[46:01] amen when they had finished everything
[46:03] amen that the cloud fill the house of
[46:06] the Lord amen this is the Shak Glory now
[46:09] so that the priest could not stand to
[46:11] minister because the cloud for the glory
[46:13] of the Lord had filled the house of the
[46:15] Lord this is similar now to what
[46:17] happened when Moses dedicated the the
[46:19] Tabernacle now the glory of the Lord F
[46:21] the place that Moses himself could not
[46:23] even stand so similarly the priests
[46:26] themselves could not even Minister
[46:28] because of the glory of the Lord amen
[46:31] because when the temple as we said is
[46:33] complete the glory of the Lord must fill
[46:35] the Tabernacle and after Moses was
[46:38] finished after Solomon had been done and
[46:41] dedicated him then the glory of the Lord
[46:43] fill the Tabernacle and you
[46:46] see when the glory of the Lord fills the
[46:49] Tabernacle then the days of man is over
[46:52] yes because Moses could not enter in the
[46:54] days of the Prophet were over the
[46:57] ministers could not enter in the days of
[46:59] the ministers were over that is why
[47:02] you've been hearing week in and weak out
[47:05] that the ministry is here to equip you
[47:07] because it's no longer up to the
[47:09] minister yes the responsibility comes
[47:12] upon you because when the glory of the
[47:13] Lord fills the Tabernacle it's no longer
[47:15] the prophet it's no longer the minister
[47:18] it's you alone with the glory of the
[47:20] Lord amen is you alone sharing in the
[47:23] glory of the Lord amen praise the
[47:29] Lord see it was making all this time
[47:32] that you've been hearing all the
[47:33] preaching you've been hearing the word
[47:35] it was making you ready to share in his
[47:37] glory amen yes absolutely you see we had
[47:40] to take our influence and and our
[47:42] influences before we may be influenced
[47:45] by man we may be influenced by great
[47:47] teachers but now we were coming to a
[47:49] stage where we need to be caught up into
[47:50] the glory of the Lord amen yes Lord oh
[47:54] thank you Jesus but now asks you whose
[47:56] Glory will you
[47:58] share you see we can be easily caught up
[48:00] in the glory of a man of a minister we
[48:03] can be easily caught up still in the
[48:05] Glory Days of the Prophet yes you know
[48:07] the prophet had a great ministry a
[48:09] glorious Ministry and we can easily be
[48:12] caught up and be stuck in that but whose
[48:15] Glory will you share in can you come up
[48:18] yourself into the Shak glory of the Lord
[48:20] and sharing his glory
[48:22] amen amen you you see we
[48:26] said Isaiah is the commentary of the
[48:28] Bible right and we read this Isaiah was
[48:31] caught up in the sixth chapter into the
[48:33] glory of the Lord in the sixth chapter
[48:36] Isaiah's influence then was no longer on
[48:38] a man yes but now it got caught up into
[48:40] the glory of the Lord and what is the
[48:42] sixth book of the Bible it's the Book of
[48:45] Joshua you see the days of Moses was
[48:47] over Moses wrote Genesis Exodus and so
[48:50] forth the laws and so forth but the days
[48:53] of Moses was over Joshua and Israel had
[48:55] to take their eyes out of Moses and they
[48:58] had to now enter in themselves amen yes
[49:02] they had to enter now in the sixth book
[49:04] they are to enter themselves into the
[49:05] glory of the Lord they had to experience
[49:08] the glory the supernatural for
[49:09] themselves they had to fight for
[49:11] themselves they had to conquer for
[49:13] themselves they could not rely on Moses
[49:15] anymore to draw Moses give us water
[49:17] Moses give us food that to now come into
[49:20] the glory of the Lord themselves amen
[49:23] wonderful you see isah is just typing
[49:25] everything
[49:27] out amen so don't be caught up on the
[49:31] influence of a man or some great
[49:33] preacher or or don't be caught up just
[49:36] in the days of the Prophet but enter in
[49:38] yourself amen yes you see in when you
[49:42] are caught up in his glory his train
[49:44] fills the temple amen the Holy Ghost
[49:46] fills the temple the angels of the Lord
[49:49] fill the temple Lord but you need to be
[49:51] caught up into that realm yes
[49:54] amen
[49:55] [Music]
[50:00] amen and when the glory of the Lord
[50:02] fills the temple then now it can be used
[50:05] for
[50:05] service you see sanctification sets us
[50:08] apart for service but the Holy Ghost
[50:11] puts us into service what is the Holy
[50:13] Ghost the glory of the Lord residing in
[50:16] you and when the glory of the Lord fills
[50:18] the temple then the temple can be put
[50:20] for
[50:21] service before that you can't be put for
[50:23] service because there's no power in you
[50:25] there's no glory in
[50:29] you you know let's we're looking at this
[50:32] Earthly Temple now of Solomon right and
[50:34] let's see the glory of this Temple and
[50:37] compare it now with the glory of this
[50:43] Temple I'm I'm keeping an eye on my time
[50:46] I won't be too long much longer but
[50:49] let's let's compare the glory of that
[50:51] temple with this Temple yes see Solomon
[50:55] now now after the temple is dedicated
[50:56] and the glory of the Lord fills this
[50:58] this Temple he's now praying and you
[51:01] know it's a familiar prayer where he's
[51:03] talking about and saying if any man
[51:05] looks to this Temple and prays that the
[51:07] Lord must answer so let's go through
[51:09] this and see and when we read this I
[51:10] want you to think of yourself as the
[51:13] Temple of the Living
[51:15] God verse 28 yet have thou respect unto
[51:18] my prayer of thy servant and to his
[51:21] supplication oh Lord oh Lord my God to
[51:24] hearken un to the cry and to the prayer
[51:27] which thy servant prayed before thee
[51:31] today that thine eyes may be open to Wi
[51:34] this house this Temple right amen and I
[51:37] said put yourself in this place amen
[51:39] that Thine Eyes the Lord's eyes may be
[51:41] open toward this house night and day
[51:44] amen even toward the place of which thou
[51:46] has said my name shall be
[51:49] there that thou mayest hearken unto the
[51:52] prayer which thy servant shall make
[51:53] towards this place and and hearken thou
[51:56] to the supplication of thy servant and
[51:58] thy People Israel when they shall pray
[52:01] towards this place who is M Jesus on the
[52:04] earth now who is Grace upon the earth
[52:05] now and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling
[52:08] place and when thou hearest forgive amen
[52:12] who sins you forgive amen If any man
[52:16] trespass against his neighbor an oath be
[52:19] laid upon him to cause him to swear and
[52:22] the O come before th altar in this house
[52:25] then then hear thy in heaven and do any
[52:27] judge thy servants condemning the wicked
[52:29] to bring his way upon his head and
[52:32] justifying the righteous to give him
[52:33] according to his righteousness when thy
[52:36] People Israel be smitten down before the
[52:38] enemy because they have sinned against
[52:40] thee and shall turn again to thee and
[52:43] confess thy name and pray and make
[52:45] supplication unto thee in this house
[52:48] thou hear thine heaven and forgive the
[52:50] sin of thy People Israel and bring them
[52:53] again unto the land which thou gave unto
[52:55] their
[52:56] fathers and when Heaven is shut up and
[52:59] there is no rain because they have
[53:02] sinned against thee if they pray towards
[53:04] this place and confess thy name and turn
[53:07] from their sin when thou Afflicted them
[53:10] then hear thou in heaven and forgive the
[53:12] sin of thy servants and of thy people
[53:15] that thou teach them a good way wherein
[53:17] they should walk and give Reign upon thy
[53:20] land which thou has given to the people
[53:23] didn't we read the quote where it says
[53:24] if a brother comes to you and asks for
[53:26] rain yes you can say I give you rain you
[53:29] see the glory of this Temple Hallelujah
[53:33] if they be in the land of famine if
[53:35] there be pestilence blasting M Locust or
[53:39] if there be
[53:40] caterpillar if the enemy besiege them in
[53:42] the land of whatever they of their
[53:44] cities whatsoever plague whatever
[53:46] sickness they be what prayer and
[53:49] supplication soever be made by any man
[53:51] or by all thy People Israel which shall
[53:54] know every man the the plague of his own
[53:56] heart and spread forth his hand towards
[53:58] this house then thou in heaven thy
[54:01] dwelling place and forgive and do and
[54:03] give to every man according to his ways
[54:06] amen so you see the power of when the
[54:08] glory fills this Temple amen then now
[54:11] they can look towards this Temple and
[54:14] they can ask God for anything in my
[54:15] nameen and it shall be done when the
[54:18] glory of the Lord fills this Temple you
[54:20] see when the glory of the Lord fills you
[54:22] it says even if it's pestilence even if
[54:24] it's
[54:26] amen didn't we say that we serve a God
[54:27] that can ride off deaths am why because
[54:29] the glory of the Lord is in this Temple
[54:32] amen you see it's a long chapter I want
[54:34] you to go home and read it and compare
[54:35] yourself to this Temple because you are
[54:37] the Temple of the Living God
[54:42] Amen and we know that that Temple was
[54:45] effective because remember Jonah in the
[54:48] whales belly when he turned towards the
[54:49] temple and he prayed God came in to
[54:52] deliver him amen remember Daniel though
[54:55] they passed those laws he opened his
[54:56] windows he looked towards the temple and
[54:58] he prayed amen you see so if that Temple
[55:01] that literal Temple that was filled with
[55:03] the glory of the Lord was so effective
[55:05] amen imagine this Temple when this
[55:08] Temple is filled with the glory of the
[55:10] Lord how effective this Temple can be
[55:13] you see in that Temple they were
[55:14] sacrificing animals but in this Temple
[55:18] amen the lamb was slain before the
[55:19] foundations of the world amen amen there
[55:22] is no sined unto us there's not no more
[55:25] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[55:27] Jesus so how much more glorious this
[55:29] Temple is amen but whose Glory will you
[55:33] Shan yes amen will you Shan the glory of
[55:36] the Lord yes amen you see the prophet
[55:39] says the church in this day that
[55:42] glorious church that's to be on the
[55:44] earth when Jesus comes to receive a
[55:46] glorious Church you see he's coming to
[55:48] receive a glorious church not any church
[55:51] but a glorious church we receiving the
[55:54] latter rain a double portion of the Holy
[55:57] Ghost is coming on the earth and he's
[55:59] sweeping Every Nation Revival fires are
[56:02] burning see this is why you can listen
[56:04] to a message like on Sunday to brother
[56:06] Tim frud and see that he's preaching the
[56:08] same things why because Revival fires
[56:10] are breaking out on every Hill in China
[56:13] in Japan from Korea the dark afca Africa
[56:17] and everywhere the holy spirit is being
[56:18] poured out upon the people God Made A
[56:21] Way
[56:23] amen you see you know just in closing I
[56:26] want to show you amen how you know we
[56:29] can think of ourselves little yet you
[56:32] know but I want to show you how God
[56:33] works with little and how he can fill us
[56:35] with his
[56:40] glory the prophet says but when I opened
[56:42] the Bible the first little ribbon in the
[56:44] Bible was a very strange thing where it
[56:47] was when Solomon dedicated the temple of
[56:49] God and the glory of God was so great
[56:52] the shakina glory in the buing till the
[56:54] priest couldn't even
[56:56] Minister and then the next thing the
[56:59] next string was laying the prophet is
[57:00] looking at the strings in his
[57:03] Bible the next string was lay where in
[57:05] Ezra returned and dedicated the temple
[57:08] yes and in the now Pastor Adan read this
[57:11] a while back amen tying it up with Mark
[57:14] 11:23 and the third little marker that
[57:17] my wife had gotten me and put in the
[57:19] Bible not knowing with my name on it and
[57:21] so forth was laying to mark 11:22 but
[57:24] it's actually referring to Mark 11:23
[57:26] yes she was she stuck in the Bible
[57:28] that's way was if you say to this
[57:31] mountain be moved and all of you know
[57:33] that scripture was right in my mind so
[57:35] you see the prophet is typing these
[57:37] three things the Shak glory of the Lord
[57:39] Mark 11:23 he's tying all these things
[57:42] in together yes and we at 2023 where we
[57:46] went over Mark 11:23 now we coming to
[57:48] 2024 the glory of the Lord the prophet
[57:51] is now bringing it together for
[57:53] us and and notice then he goes on to say
[57:57] in the same quote and then my first
[57:59] meeting after this right message I to
[58:03] preacher is at Phoenix amen Arizona yes
[58:06] and the prophet says Phoenix is
[58:08] something that can raise up out of
[58:09] nothing amen amen now I'm not making a
[58:12] Doctrine out of this but I'm I'm I'm
[58:14] putting it there to encourage you yes
[58:16] right that's what God does he takes
[58:18] nothing raises up something out of it
[58:21] amen the prophet goes on to say thank
[58:23] you brother he says surely be a real
[58:27] real privilege to have brother brandham
[58:29] come often so often to Phoenix he says I
[58:32] think he comes to phix more than
[58:35] anywhere I'm showing you this for a
[58:37] reason just to encourage you amen the
[58:39] angel of the Lord visits us
[58:42] yes amen see the angel of the Lord likes
[58:44] to visit Phoenix in 1963 he appeared in
[58:48] Phoenix Arizona in 2023 showed himself
[58:52] here in Phoenix amen
[58:56] amen not because of the place now
[58:59] because of the
[59:02] elect the other day on the mountain I
[59:05] was standing there I said Lord I got one
[59:07] Open Door in the whole nation as far as
[59:10] I know that's Phoenix yes Lord you've
[59:13] only got you're the only one I got the
[59:16] prophet says I I hope this is not the
[59:18] case now and I hope that the the eyes of
[59:22] the people in the M begin to open yes
[59:25] amen so the angel of the Lord can
[59:28] move he goes on to
[59:32] say that's been about 12 14 years ago
[59:35] now in the city called Phoenix is
[59:38] something that built up from ruins I
[59:41] said well that's the same thing happened
[59:43] to you this morning God built you up I
[59:46] believe this morning from a ruined heal
[59:48] to good health you see a lot of the a
[59:51] lot of the uh message community
[59:55] were heavily influenced by wrong
[59:57] doctrines by all different kinds of
[59:59] doctrines the seven Thunders the Seven
[1:00:01] Virtues and all of these things they
[1:00:03] were ruined in that doctrines all these
[1:00:05] years but the prophet says God took us
[1:00:08] from ruined Health to Good Health am you
[1:00:11] see he is able to show us the truth
[1:00:12] amongst all of it
[1:00:15] yes now the prophet says Isaiah one time
