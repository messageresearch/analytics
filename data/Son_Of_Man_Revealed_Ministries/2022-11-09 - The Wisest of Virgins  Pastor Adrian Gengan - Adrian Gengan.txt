Heavenly Father we come before your most holy presence and we know father any man that has human ability can open the Bible Pages of these Bibles and read those words but it takes your Holy Spirit or

house of the Lord this evening to worship you we pray Lord that you will bless him this evening father and meet with the every needle God even as we see the day first approach him keep us ready Lord prepare for the hour because Lord in such an hour as we think not the son of man is coming oh God we thank you Lord that you're preparing your people oh God Lord you've sent us a message Father to prepare us and give us faith for this rapture we look forward to this time of fellowship with prayer a mighty angel will come now and Speak O God and take your word father and break it forward to our hungry Souls we ask his Blessings Now in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen good to see every one of you back in the house of the Lord amen to worship Him amen we'll speak this evening just take a little parable of the Lord the way he took the parable of the ten virgins and we'll speak on the wisest of virgins amen so let's go to Matthew 25 so you know Matthew 24 is where they're asking Jesus When shall the sign of the coming be and the end of all things and Jesus is describing the circumstances that will be upon the Earth and then this 25 is a continuation and he's saying then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forward to meet the bridegroom amen they went for to meet the bridegroom so what were they doing they were looking forward to the coming of the Lord so we know we have a rich heritage of the faith that's been passed down to us so from Paul's Day from the disciples day because Jesus gave them a promise I will come again so they were looking for the bridegroom from their first age Jesus never told them that it was going to take two thousand years of church history all of them were looking for that bridegroom now remember when the prophet is preaching about the ten virgins he tell you the cloth is laid across all seven Church ages and the pattern is cut out because the five y's and the five foolish are coming right through seven Church ages okay so you just wanted to get that down there in that verse so they're going forward to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them so we know the oil is a type of the Holy Spirit but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps so not only did they have oil in the lamp they had a special vessel on their side that they kept extra oil in so they had a double portion of oil but the wise took oil in the vessels with a lamp while the bridegroom carried so there's the 2000 years of church history now they all slumbered and slept so here we come now to the Pentecostal age right Lou that passed Wesley had passed the Pentecostals that had a niche initial outpouring but they slumbered and slept and settled for denominationalism and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh going out to meet him now we know what Ministry that is right amen then all 10 all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps because he initiated the greatest healing Revival and out of that Revival you see all the other evangelists go out into the field like Oral Roberts TL has born and all of these Mighty Men A.A Allen so he started an initial healing Revival there all the one all the versions arose and trimmed their lamps so they're making preparation if you're trimming your lamp you're making preparation And The Fool is said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out and the wise answered saying not so lest they be not enough for us and you but go we rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves so note that there's not a shortage of oil oil is freely available but they need to go to the right source to get it amen and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut amen that sounds as final as Genesis 7. yes put up Genesis 7 16. amen let's just cross reference this the door was shut you know what this is amen Genesis 7 16. when Noah goes into the Earth they went in went in male and female of All Flesh as God had commanded him and the Lord shut him in so what similar event now they were trying when the rains are coming they are trying to gain entry into the ark they can't because God shut him in let's continue reading the bridegroom shuts the door and afterward all came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us hmm and he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you're not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh pay attention to them he is talking about a specific Ministry because we know he comes as son of man amen Son of God son of David so in the current time when he is speaking he's speaking in the office of Son of Man a prophet he's going to go away and it's going to become the age of Son of God the Holy Spirit but in between Son of God and Son of David he comes back as son of man amen so notice that he's saying you know not the day nor the hour away and the son of man cometh okay you may be seated God bless you amen so what are we noticing here they are called amen when were they called amen they were called under a specific Ministry when I'm saying they were called we were called the wisest of virgins were called Amen to Revelation 19 and 9 says right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the Lamb and he's saying unto me these are the true sayings of God okay we find here that as civilization has traveled with the Sun from east to the West so as Sin traveled with civilization every thought of man is continually evil it's just like the days of Noah amen till it grieved God that he even made man he said I will destroy man from the face of the Earth and the prophet says we've come back to that time again if we know what the condition of the world and what it's going through right now the people that run the world the world leaders know that it's time for the end why are they pushing this great agenda you know right now top 27 is taking place it's climate talks they're kicked off in Egypt and it's going on for 12 days world leaders climate scientists negotiators activists will take part in this great Gathering to talk about the planet's future amen when we have a confidence that the the safety of the plan of the earth is not in the hands of man Peter describes us when the Lord will destroy the Earth or burn it up and renovate the Earth amen they are trying to save what they have already destroyed right amen amen let's just read this brother Caleb while we're there let's go to Revelation 8 11 and 18 and show you in scripture what is currently happening amen it says here Revelation 8 11 and 18 and the nations were angry for thy wrathis come and the time of the Dead that they should be judged okay let's just take the two things are the Nations angry is his wrath come Revelation 10 is a time of investigating judgment right because amateur tribulation has set in making way for the Great Tribulation so his wrath is come and the time of the Dead isn't about the time for the dead in Christ to rise amen that they should be judged that they should be now watch learn from the scripture is so packed if you ever want to know if they reward they ended out here it is that they should give reward unto their zip for servants and the prophets amen you remember the prophet's Vision dream he was given rewards amen yes it confirmed in Scripture reward given to the servants the prophets and to the Saints amen so there is a time of Rewards right and also to them that fear thy name small and great and here's judgment and is destroying them which destroy the Earth so in that little sentence there the Bible is telling us that there'll come a time upon the Earth where man in the pursuit of Technology logical advancement would end up destroying themselves amen there's a reason there's an energy crisis right now is because they are trying to get off cold they can continue like that but they are saying that type of generating that type of energy is destroying the planet so they want clean energy that is why they don't want this fuel they want clean energy and they're going into fracking and fossil fuels and all of these things amen they don't want the old way of doing things because they are saying that is the cause of why the Earth is being destroyed they're talking about climate change they're talking about the ice caps melting they're talking about increasing temperatures rising sea levels but they don't know they are thinking is their doings they don't know it's the wrath of God being poured out upon the Earth because they don't believe in the vials they don't believe in their trumpets amen so man it is futility is trying to save himself so the Bible is telling us there's a group of people that are destroying the Earth and God is going to destroy them why why would God be angry with man that is destroying the Earth because God made man as the guardian over the Earth he made him Steward over the Earth yes because when God made man in Genesis 1 man was in his Spirit form in Ethiopian body and in this form he could not till the ground so in Genesis 2 verse 5 the Bible tells us there was not a man to till the ground and in verse 7 it says the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastwood in Eden and there he put the man whom he formed right so man would become the guardian of the earth his role was supposed to be a caretaker of the Earth and subdue and Rule and control everything on the Earth Earth was man's domain and heaven was God's domain amen so we find this cop 27 now there's a very strange thing happening and it's going to happen on Sunday in compliance with the message of Pope Francis the world leaders are gathering at Mount Sinai what is Mount Sinai that received the Ten Commandments so here's what they're doing world leaders are going to be gathering on Mount Sinai to put forward prophetic interreligious call to action 10 Universal Commandments now yeah we preachers over the years Pastor Ronnie labeled over the years and you know the pro you read the seals and all of these things we don't need to go back and now let's say instill again how the end of time is going to be and what the pope is going to do we know what he's going to do we can spend the next hour or so just trying to show you all those quotes but you already know these things right and now he's going to form a one world religion and unite all religions do you know he's already done it that's right in September they met for the final time and the final document if you read that document you'll be amazed that they have already set into motion the laws that will be implemented he's saying that no one religion should prosely light and declare that there is the only true way now pay attention because the beginning of the Gentile dispensation is the same as the ending amen when was the law passed Daniel must not pray while he's still at religious freedom he could still pray so laws right now are being passed while we still have our liberties and while we are worshiping behind closed doors they are signing yes and you see there head of the Anglican Church head of the Muslim faith hello Buddhist Faith all religion everything the prophet laid out in the seals is coming past what forward we are at the end of time when he said that this great economical move that's being formed now will be set up that image is already been set up now amen we have signed the final document the laws that the persecution will be set upon the people have already been detailed and they've already readied out and you read and you watch how they're commanding World governments and telling them fall in line with this do this do this implement this and then the spirit tell us that they cannot unite the world through politics so they will do it through religion amen amen so right now on Sunday we are going what are they doing they are playing God because they know God took Moses up to Mount Sinai and he gave him the Ten Commandments not for the whole world not for all the religions but for the chosen people of God Amen to follow this those Ten Commandments amen now they have formed a one-word religion the First Act is to go to Mount Sinai and they are calling it Ten Commandments or ten Universal principles for climate Justice they are trying to recreate the Ten Commandments that Moses received from God from this very same Mountain thousands of years ago but we had another Prophet go up to mount Sunset and he received a word that revealed all of their schemes and what they're going to do yes amen amen we have received Supernatural instruction from another prophet amen hallelujah so we are at the end of times Church right now and that was the that signing that they had funny enough was their seventh Congress amen if numbers mean anything to you that was their seventh Congress so we're living at the end of the seventh Church age leadership Church age and at the seventh Congress they signed the final document please go and watch that if you can so we know that the Lord Jesus Christ comes three times he comes to redeem his bride watch now the pattern of Jesus Christ is always the first time he comes he comes to rescue people he comes to redeem man amen didn't he do that in the Garden of Eden the first time he comes he comes rushing into the garden to redeem Fallen Adam and Eve amen but the next time so there's a time of redemption under the time of intercession amen one time no Noah could open their meetings and preach let this floods coming this rain coming I'm building an eye getting to the Ark of Safety amen there is a time for that Ministry but when the doors are shut you can't do anything yes there's a time when Abraham can go down and rescue lot physically do it but there's a Time when you can't go down and rescue a lot the second time so the second time is a time of intercession I'm trying to show you that the bride has moved from when Jesus was in the midst of seven golden candlesticks because in Revelation 2 he's in the midst of seven golden candlesticks he's in the midst of the church ages right right where is he now he's moved from that intercessory role because we find in Revelation 5 he's coming out of that intercessory role everybody agreed brother Branham says in the breach message he is coming out of the sanctuary in Revelation 5 to take the book Amen to do the claiming work to the names that were found in the book right in Revelation 5 he does that Revelation 6 he breaks the symbols of those seals Revelation 10 he comes down with that open book I said all of that to tie it up to behold the bridegroom cometh amen and show you that when the bridegroom is coming all seven Church ages oh sorry all seven Church age Messengers would have sounded their message yes so let's go through there amen so he comes the first time to redeem his bride second time to catch away his bride and the third time he comes with her as king and queen now we find here that the oil we know it's it's typing the time when they had limbs right I'm detailing it because some of the young people may not understand what we're talking about they used to carry a lamp you have to put oil in the lamp you're gonna put a wick okay so the oil was necessary to keep the flame of that light burning when the oil ran out the light went out amen so we find amen now there's so much that we can tie it with amen but we find the Wise carried oil with them and the foolish only had oil in their limbs they bought the rose at Midnight Cry and went out to meet the bridegroom so picture the scene it's midnight right it's doctors all around there's no light anywhere but in the midst of this gross Darkness are you tying it now with as I am that gross doctor shall cover the Earth amen cover the people but arise Shine for thy light has come amen Amen in the evening time it shall be lights at Zachariah yes amen amen so we find picture the same midnight latest seeing blackness complete blackout that went the Lord threw it up in the heavens he could only show six phases of the moon because the servant was completely blacked out Prophet says when I drew it on the board I added a little light but when the Lord threw it up in the heavens complete blackout so that's the scene we are in now amen and complete darkness and the only way they can navigate through the darkness is to rely on the lamps that they have now spiritually the only way we can navigate through this labels here and darkness is through the word that we have because Thy word is a lamp to my feet and then light to my path amen so the only way they can navigate through this Darkness is to rely on the lamp then you know your your lamp is your most important survival tool in that hour amen look they're making their journey to meet the bridegroom now along the way in the midst of gross darkness in the journey the foolish virgins run out of oil if I could break it down so that all of us understand it's like load shedding that's what this is modern day load shedding for the five foolish you know when you are sitting at home and the lights go out but your neighbor got a generator and you look at his house and you see it all litter or maybe you got solo energy that's how the foolish were looking at the wise because now in the midst of gross Darkness pitch Darkness I'm trying to explain it in the next one but I hope you're catching the spiritual amen because that's what's happening in the church world right now everywhere light is in Ocean but under this Darkness I remember the time when maybe 20 years ago brother Joshua Remember the Time when the Pastors in the denominational world were getting frantic they said we're losing our youth to the world so they started to change the music in the church and just about that time Kirk Franklin came up with that song Stomp and it sounded so much like the club songs and every Church started to play it you remember when stomp was going crazy every church and I was working at Cleves music at that time and people used to come and ask us they wanted to upgrade their sound systems put some subwoofers get the base going they asked us for lighting they were looking for lighting stage lighting starting to put disco lights into the church and they would I should have some conversations with these pastors and they should tell me we need to attract our youth these modern day Elvises that's what they've done they sold out the gospel and the youth are even worse off condition now amen they have no morals no standards and they don't have God amen so you see what started in that fruit it's only in seed form sounded like an idea for the for that Pastor to retain his members but look at it now when the tree is fully grown amen complete darkness all around amen so the foolish run out of oil so with no light to guide them through the darkness they turn to the wise and they asked the wise for some of their oil now what is the oil producing light what is light revelation the holy ghost that we have is giving us Revelation in this hour to navigate through every storm of life no matter what they throw at us we can navigate through it because of Revelation amen revelation of the word amen there's nothing that the pope can throw at us at the World Council of churches can throw at us the denominational work you throw at us that this bride will be confounded this bride has been well prepared for this hour amen we are preparing for a final Victory yes Hallelujah amen but when the when they come to us the wise the wise refuse because they need all the oil they can because they still got still some time journey ahead to get to the bridegroom follow my thought now amen amen foreign to be compassionate and charitable at that time amen yes so the wise continue on their journey and you'll find a separation time comes a separation between the wise and the foolish they go these Separate Ways amen Hallelujah so we find amen because they refused initially to take oil in their vessels they ran out of oil they refused the prophets instructions initially amen for the Caleb get up genome National Rivers there see if you can find the quote in amen Feast of the trumpets you find it in paragraph 243 there amen so we find here the oil that was needed to get to the bridegroom and we are still on our journey to the bridegroom not so so we need all the oil we cannot get all the reserve that we have we need to make sure that we are filled and I I want to put it this way make sure that we are not having load shedding in our lives we are having our own load shedding amen sometimes three days gone and load shedding no lights no word is being read no word is being heard we are having personal load sharing because our generators are down for maintenance amen so as a admonishment to the church watch that we are not having spiritual load shedding amen amen and sometimes you know what we can't get caught up in that situation but awaken yourself quickly and run back amen and check your oil check your lab trim it you need light in this hour to navigate otherwise you'll get swept up with this later Shield spirit amen amen hmm amen and believe me the devil is life the devil is coming he knows how to pray on your weaknesses amen so guard yourself amen amen he prayed up all the time amen because the David Good Devil goeth around like a roaring lion she ikh he may devour don't become food for the devil and don't say oh I got overtaken by a lion the Bible says he's like a roaring lion because when you're sitting there on the floor and you're thinking one line is going to eat you and Auntie's looking at you there because he's like a roaring lion now this ant is going to nibble at you slowly and feed on you you want to be eating up a mouse amen Hallelujah so we find amen yeah let's read this here the holy spirit because we are saying they ran out of oil and I'm putting this quote in to show you how they ran out of oil the Holy Spirit has been doubt Bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loose in the evening time by the evening time messenger so when we say the evening time messenger loses the Holy Spirit amen we are using this quote the evening time messenger loses the evening time message amen which releases an evening time anointing and gives us an evening time Revelation to light up our path arise and shine for thy life has come amen amen what light are we talking about amen we are talking about the light of the opening of the word amen hallelujah amen the light that came shining for amen under that servant Steel amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen only only Juliet knew when Romeo was coming amen Hallelujah because it was an Eden encrypted message amen amen going out to meet him Hallelujah there had to be a specific time now we find amen there is no Amen to the wise and the foolish have come to a separation I I don't I don't message Richard will say uh foolish virgins are the message didn't we just read now the foolish left the wise and said go find some of your own based on that scripture you don't hear anybody agree based on that scripture it doesn't dovetail with an idea that foolish virgins are in the message amen the Bible says they went to find oil so they left the wise they went to find their own oil right if you want to find out who's selling oil go read revelation there's a group that's crying out come by without money come by without price amen isn't that group crying out in Revelation so they go and trying to find that revelation Hallelujah now if you understand what they are asked to they are asked to go back and receive justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost because they cannot just receive oil the Holy Ghost without the other two stages they must go through all three walks of Grace so it's taking them some time before they arrive back when they come back they find the door to the marriage is already closed now we know in that time something happened amen there was a prophet messenger who came in that time Hallelujah and he introduced us to our Isaac amen and the wedding ceremony has been performed and he has taken this bride to be his wife and they went into the marriage amen not the married sapna the Bible says they went into the marriage and the door was shut amen so the prophet says while the five virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation this is what will happen to all who are not going to go up in the rapture that is what will come upon the eyelids and our daughters amen Hallelujah so we find that word virgin amen that word virgin is Keen a chaste woman that's what we are amen clean from every denominational idea amen hallelujah we are clothed with the garments of the word of God the wise virgin is not deceived now there's been a change in the ministry like I told you because now she's no longer walking in the Starlight because when the bridegroom cometh who is he the s-o-n light because when he comes what the Bible says he took it into the marriage so she is now in the presence of the great satellite amen amen hallelujah and that's right in line amen with what the prophet is preaching he takes us from an Easter seal to it is the rising of the Sun watch now so there's been a change in the light that the bride has been walking in one stage we walked under light but now we are walking under sunlight and that is why we are walking amen under Luke 17 30 lives remember what Jesus said now today he said let's put it up Matthew 25 verse 13. he says watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wearing the son of man cometh what is Son of Man God in a prophet God in a prophetic office brother Branham was a son of man revealing the son of man amen Hallelujah who was given the king's sword amen so understand that that is now so he's telling you you know not not the hour wearing Luke 17 will be fulfilled is that what he's saying let's read Luke 17. Luke 17 26 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man this son of man again they didn't eat drink they married wives they were given in marriage until the day Noah entered the Earth the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted and build it but in the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and Brookstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now watch if you pay close attention to Luke 17 is describing the end of the foolish version but there's a hidden mystery about the wise virgin in there amen because Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and he was spared him and his family so even as in the days of lot there's a hidden Mystery because Abraham and Sarah are having a body change at that time [Music] amen amen you can actually time when Abraham and Sarah had that body changed because before that first born Falls this bride will have a body change so before fire and brimstone Came Upon Sodom that day just before that Sarah and Abraham had a body change amen so he tells you that Luke 17 30 even that shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen so there was a time amen when they came a separation at this end time we find it happened at the seventh watch we find also Noah is called into the Ark in the seventh chapter all typing the end time Noah is called into the app and taken into a new world in that seventh chapter right so yeah we find amen another time of chaos another time of Blackness and darkness and Gloom came over the disciples because Jesus was crucified the church was thrown into chaos the disciples are in hiding and you're very early in the morning the first day of the week they come to the simple cup at the rising of the Sun but everything was going to change from that point on because this was the beginning of the Eighth Day Sunday is the first day of the week but it's also termed as the Eighth Day amen this was the beginning of the Eighth Day and The Eighth Day represents what age the bright age amen we're going back to the beginning amen beginning for the bright age amen before the falling away took place and the start of the seven Church ages amen where only the candle light would shine amen but right now when they're standing in the presence of their Risen Sun amen now I want you to know that the rising of the sun and the angel descending at that morning to take away the stone was not to release Jesus from the tomb Jesus wasn't risen and trapped in that tomb and calling for the angels to take me out of this tomb remember Jesus is in a glorified body he can pass through walls yes but it's a type for the end time revelation 10. when the mighty Angel descends amen the rising of the Sun in this age amen because we are not in the candle light of the church ages anymore we are living in the bright age when the sun is risen after seven long nights of church ages when the sun comes up you don't need Candlelight anymore amen so the two women at the dawn of the Eighth Day at the rising of the Sun and there's a great earthquake and a descending angel that breaks the seal and rolls back to Stone to reveal to them Christ the Risen Sun now the prophet says there was a dual Sunrise the sun and the son right amen so he says when this Angel roll back a stone that held the Revelation that Jesus was risen now Mary the two Marys didn't know that Jesus was risen the stone was rolled away to bring to them the Revelation that Jesus is not dead but he's alive [Music] was to expose the Risen Christ amen and we said he was in a glorified body he could walk towards did not need the angel to roll away the stone but the mighty Angel who descended and told open the seal is to reveal to us that there is now a living what was the seals to do to reveal this end time seal was taken away to reveal that there is a living resurrected bride that just as how the head Rose about two thousand years ago now the body has risen amen amen doesn't he come to empower the body would the title deed so when he takes away the seal is revealing to there's John the Risen body take back the title deed to the Earth amen so he's revealing the living resurrected bride that amen hallelujah so at the rising of the sun she bursts forth into life amen so in order for us to come out of a denominational tomb amen and walk amen that we were once walking in Candlelight but we had to come out of the denominational tomb amen so the angel must break the seal on your life and reveal who you are who you are amen that you are Eternal as God is eternal revealed to you that your name is in the book what is he doing he's taking away the seal of your life and revealing to you your Eternal attributes thank you the word of this age is revealed to you by the Angel's message amen so only those that has a seal upon their lives and that seal must be broken tell you who your mother and father is amen and he said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham amen now notices this event at the rising of the Sun was a mighty Revelation to the woman at that time and notice how it came when the Easter seal was broken now here it is in type again because we told you it's a son of man revealing the son of man but the Brennan preaches the Easter sea in 1965. right on the 10th of April 1965. then so that's in Phoenix Arizona then he goes back to the east he goes back to Jeffersonville and eight days later just like the story is preaching it is the rising of the Sun if you caught that it's a Time of the son of man being revealed amen 10th of April 1965 he preaches the Easter seal eight days later he preaches it is the rising of the Sun and in that very same message it starts out by telling you you need to turn that picture to the right first time I don't understand why so many churches still have the picture the other way because the law told the prophet you're looking at the picture the wrong way so why do you want to have the picture the wrong way some say we want to stick with the original the way science took it why you want to look at it the way science took it when the Lord is telling the prophet so honey you're looking at the picture the wrong way turn it to the right [Music] amen so let's tell it the right way amen because when you turn it the other way you don't see Christ amen so from that point we see there was a turning point now in the ministry as well because eight months later so moving from eight days it is the rising of the sun eight months later brother Branham is taken off the scene and there's a change in the ministry because Revelation 10 7 is taken off the scene and it's a time now for thou must prophesy again amen yes amen Hallelujah foreign [Music] [Music] so we know as we're ending now we're going to prepare keep our lamps trimmed and burning we're telling you all of this to tell you this amen let's get this in the message amen it says type of this that church will stand true in the fight it says don't make no difference what they say that church will stand true in the fight she has already proved it back Yonder and she'll do it again in the face of everything it's the word of God and let all economical movements and anything else be gone she is going to be there without spot or wrinkle that's right she'll stand there talking about now the wise virgin amen you can see this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed he's preaching this in 416 he says and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon you got it why why are we ending with this amen remember the prophet says there must be a squeeze and if you go and read that document that they finally sign it'll show you how that we cannot even preach that Jesus is the only way even the pope is saying he doesn't even refer to God anymore he refers to God as Creator creator of all and he says God creators are all equal amen right now he's really speaking like a dragon with subtleity though so he says here and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that and churches like this who is not a denomination they'll use them for he stores anything [Music] and he says here and if any man goes and offer prayer for anybody else that don't belong to the economical movement will be shot on the spot it's all ready we got that [Music] a bitter religious persecution we're nearing that time he says you remember church that we're living in the best day that you'll ever will live in right now until Jesus come you got this say living in the best day that you ever will live in he says you remember Church you're living in the best day that you ever will live in right now until Jesus come it shall rapidly get better and better [Music] what does he say he will rapidly get worse and worse now isn't that exactly what's happening we can hardly keep up with how was Ben is getting rapidly it's getting worse and worse the world is crying out in fact right now they elected little boys whistling through the graveyard you watch after this U.S election midterm they've been trying to keep our faces and appearances try to keep the economy a bit stable let this midterm finish you'll see the true effects of it amen he says we're coming into a religious persecution with the same things they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it does save the Lord [Music] amen [Music] yeah again I want to say this because some people still have questions what is the mark of the beast in question and answers paragraph 26 question and answers you'll see that in 1959 he says the mark of the beast is on today and the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit now hear this very clearly because people have always questioned what is the mark of the beast right so he's telling you the mark of the beast is on today the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit [Music] to reject it that means to reject the Holy Ghost to reject it is the mark of the beast right so you can be sitting in church reject the Holy Ghost and you can be receiving the mark of the beast right here but you're waiting for them to come to the church you're waiting therefore to come put a tattoo you're waiting for him to come with a permanent Mark and write on your head but he says yes it sure to reject it is the mark of the beast amen just continue reading there amen he says ever who sees the holy ghost that you're supposed to receive it and don't do it that's the same with the wise and foolish now he didn't do it right automatically you take the mark of the beast now you see the hidden story that's not being told in that's terrible when they ran out of oil they didn't have the Holy Ghost when they went away they received the mark of the beast that's why when they came back because they were mocked already Christ couldn't open up the door it was sealed right he says you're supposed to receive it you didn't automatically you take the mark of the beast because there's only two classes to exist all that didn't have the Seal of God had the mark of the beast so to receive the Seal of God is to receive the Holy Ghost to reject it is to have the mark of the beast there's the whole thing that's exactly right thank you foreign [Music] let's just take this last quote amen I will close with this it's handwriting on the wall 1956. the handwriting on the wall 1956 amen paragraph 89 he says I want you to notice the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them they got OT in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the Gentile age was issued in with that it will go out in the same way a boycott of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and to do the thing that they've been taught that was contrary to the word of God and brother it'll be so slick and Sly until it will deceive the very elective possible so you better purpose in your heart tonight to be filled with God's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and wrong when the proclamation is issued amen amen now I ask you what Proclamation is that I think we have just witnessed it because they've already written it down they're going back now to Mount Sinai on Sunday to create their own Ten Commandments you don't believe me you're good on Google [Music] amen Sunday they're going to do it while you are gathered here on Sunday they're gonna have a religious experience on Mount Sinai and they're going to create their Ten Commandments and don't think because Who's involved with cop 27 the United Nations and all the world religious leaders that have come from the summit of the Pope they're saying it's time the time for talking is over right the pope has already got 10 climate Commandments you can read that he's already got it out so the Pope that man of sin you can see how he's working amen and he is working through satility how many of you can go and Unite you ever tried talking to a Muslim man and trying to have fellowship with him how did this guy get it right he got the biggest Imam in the Muslim world to sign a document that they all worship one God he's got Jewish people he's got Hindus he's got Buddhist he's got the anglicans he's got the Pentecostal he's got everyone there how did he do it amen because he's anointed to do it the same way you are anointed for your part he's anointed for his part I tell you go here tomorrow and try and get this priest from this Temple this Imam from this mosque and see what they won't come join me too because you are not anointed for that amen but where the caucuses amen you can gather Eagles together amen they'll come Eagles will come because of the word amen so
