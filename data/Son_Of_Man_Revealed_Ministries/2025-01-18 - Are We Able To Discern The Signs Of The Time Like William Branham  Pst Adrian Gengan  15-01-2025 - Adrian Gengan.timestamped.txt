[3:49] worthy to reveal himself to us amen so

[3:57] brother
[3:58] jaff praise the
[4:01] Lord amen so it's good to be back with
[4:04] Believers of light precious Faith amen
[4:06] and we're going to get into some uh
[4:09] serious stuff amen praise the Lord amen
[4:13] even as we see the day fast approaching
[4:15] we can speak on the word of God Amen
[4:17] let's turn to our Bible Matthew chapter
[4:28] 24 we'll read from verse three and as
[4:32] they sat upon the Mount of Olives the
[4:34] disciples came unto him
[4:37] privately saying tell us when shall
[4:41] these things be and what shall be the
[4:43] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[4:47] world Amen now Jesus would go on to talk
[4:52] about all the
[4:54] signs amen but 202 24:24 says for there
[4:59] shall arise false Christ false prophets
[5:03] F and shall show great signs and wonders
[5:07] in so much if it were possible they
[5:09] shall deceive the very elect amen so
[5:12] that that's one of the signs amen and
[5:15] then we'll find in verse 30 he says
[5:18] there shall appear the sign of the son
[5:19] of man in heaven now we know Jesus
[5:22] Christ is not coming a son of man again
[5:25] he's coming as son of David so what is
[5:28] the sign of the son of man
[5:30] amen so he's saying but where shall it
[5:35] appear where shall it appear it shall
[5:38] appear in the heavens 1963 the sign
[5:40] appears in the heavens amen praise the
[5:43] Lord and then there shall all the tribes
[5:46] of the earth mourn and they shall see
[5:49] the son of man coming in the Clouds Of
[5:50] Heaven with power and great glory amen
[5:53] praise the Lord verse 36 says but of
[5:56] that day and that hour knoweth no man
[5:58] know not the angels of heaven but my
[6:00] father only but as the days of Noah were
[6:03] so shall also the coming of the son of
[6:05] man be amen hallelujah then then he goes
[6:09] to tell you how amen two will be
[6:11] grinding in the field amen he'll come
[6:14] and take one and leave one amen so the
[6:17] Lord keeps on going on into Matthew 25
[6:19] the Lord are blessings to the reading of
[6:21] his word you may be
[6:22] seated
[6:24] amen for amen just want to go through a
[6:27] few of the prophets
[6:30] amen
[6:34] messages and what we are looking at is
[6:37] we don't want to become
[6:40] desensitized and things are happening
[6:42] all around
[6:44] us and because we are so focused on the
[6:47] natural side of life that we miss the
[6:49] signs of his
[6:51] coming we miss the signs
[6:54] amen because they ask Jesus for the
[6:57] signs and Jesus detail to them if you go
[7:00] and read the whole of Matthew 24 and 25
[7:04] Jesus is detailing amen what would be
[7:06] the conditions of the
[7:09] earth amen now I want to start by
[7:12] reading what a prophet is many times
[7:14] people are confused at what a prophet is
[7:17] and even amongst the message folks
[7:19] you'll hear them
[7:20] saying a prophet is a modern day
[7:23] preacher but I want the prophet's
[7:25] definition of what a prophet is because
[7:28] we are all modern day preacher preachers
[7:30] but we are not prophets amen you'll find
[7:34] they read the quote halfway that a
[7:36] modern day preacher is a prophet but
[7:38] let's see what the prophet of God is
[7:40] saying amen he says now we might speak
[7:43] here just for a minute what is a prophet
[7:46] now in the English term according to the
[7:48] English terms it means
[7:51] preacher that's the English terms but in
[7:55] the Hebrew terms it's called SE amen I
[7:59] want us to be very clear because I want
[8:01] us to realize what kind of ministry we
[8:03] are associated with
[8:06] amen and isia was one that who had the
[8:10] interpretation of the written word and
[8:13] he forsaw things that was to come and
[8:16] when he spoke of the things that was to
[8:18] come and proved he was a sea then he
[8:21] knowed they know he had the right
[8:23] interpretation of the scripture because
[8:25] God through him manifested the written
[8:28] scripture for that day
[8:30] amen don't be slothful wake up amen so
[8:35] he he's is uh trying to tell us this
[8:38] definition of a prophet is so serious we
[8:40] mustn't be slaughtered we must wake up
[8:42] and listen to what he is
[8:44] saying because you get many people call
[8:47] themselves
[8:48] prophets amen don't be slothful wake up
[8:53] that was the plain identification a SE a
[8:56] for teller or teller forth and the only
[8:59] way
[9:00] way that they know he was getting the
[9:02] right interpretation to the scripture
[9:04] because what he said come to pass
[9:08] amen then they know he was called of God
[9:11] God said that and they noticed that it
[9:13] did it did come right back in continuity
[9:16] with the word for that day amen so we
[9:21] find our Prophet said many
[9:24] things and if he is a true Prophet they
[9:27] must it must come to pass and we know
[9:30] without a shadow of a doubt it's been
[9:32] revealed to us that he is a true Prophet
[9:34] he's a scriptural Prophet amen he's a
[9:37] Vindicated Prophet amen praise the Lord
[9:39] so the things that he spoke we want to
[9:42] look for it amen and also because we are
[9:45] a prophetic class of people be able to
[9:48] see how he saw things so that we can be
[9:51] able to discern it the same
[9:52] way amen because the Bride is a
[9:55] prophetic voice on the earth now the
[9:58] prophet of God will tell us here
[10:02] I want to show you that God can use
[10:04] signs in the
[10:05] heavens and when we see signs in the
[10:08] heavens we should not take it as a
[10:10] natural
[10:11] phenomenon yes right amen hallelujah he
[10:15] says the wise men that came from Babylon
[10:18] they were studying the
[10:19] Stars they were astronomers they studied
[10:22] the Stars they seen these three stars
[10:25] line up now the three stars lining up
[10:28] had a meaning ham sham and Jeff star
[10:32] that they were born under lined up and
[10:34] they
[10:35] knew these scientific Believers watched
[10:38] the Heavenly beings how they moved and
[10:41] when they seen those stars coming to
[10:43] line over Jerusalem for for if there was
[10:46] at Babylon they look right straight
[10:48] towards Jerusalem towards the West to
[10:51] see it and when they seen that com in
[10:53] they knew when those stars come in line
[10:56] with one another now this is the
[10:58] definition of stars coming in line the
[11:00] Messiah was on the
[11:03] earth
[11:05] amen so the lining up of stars and the
[11:09] lining up of planets have
[11:12] meaning but if we are so caught up in
[11:15] the Natural Things of life we will just
[11:17] take it as Natural
[11:20] Things amen but the ones that are
[11:22] studying it a prophet of God would amen
[11:26] tell you that these things means
[11:28] something is happening on the earth God
[11:31] first shows it in the heavens Hallelujah
[11:34] and when we see Israel now watch he's
[11:36] not only showing you the Stars he's
[11:38] showing you a scriptural sign as well
[11:40] Israel going
[11:42] home the Holy Ghost poured out in the
[11:45] churches the economical move of going
[11:48] together the Council of churches and
[11:51] things the Roman Catholics Protestants
[11:54] uniting together that's another sign he
[11:56] says the Messiah is going to come to
[11:59] catch away his
[12:00] bride now for many years the prophet had
[12:03] laid it out how the pope was going to
[12:05] unite all
[12:07] religions through the years we have
[12:09] watched it
[12:10] unfold we even had the chance to preach
[12:13] it as
[12:14] prophecy but it can no longer be
[12:17] preached as prophecy because it has
[12:19] already been fulfilled yes the final
[12:22] document of world religions has already
[12:24] been signed 3 years ago
[12:27] yes that's why you find the pope no
[12:29] longer going around and meeting with all
[12:32] religious leader that has already been
[12:34] done they've already
[12:37] signed amen you watch now the pope is
[12:40] accepting all religions all kinds of
[12:43] worship amen so watch what the prophet
[12:46] is saying now the stars in the heavens
[12:49] lining up Messiah is on Earth Israel
[12:51] going to the Homeland Church receiving
[12:53] the Holy Ghost amen the Catholics
[12:57] Protestants and all religions you in
[12:59] together it's a sign that the Messiah is
[13:02] going to come and catch his way way his
[13:05] bride and he says and God is sending
[13:08] gifts to create a in us a
[13:13] faith that will move us out of here yes
[13:16] am amen someday into a
[13:21] Rapture and what are these gifts Healing
[13:24] The Sick opening the eyes of the blind
[13:26] raising up the dead because the gospel
[13:28] come can't be preached without
[13:30] manifestation yes amen as much as we are
[13:33] preaching the revelation of the word of
[13:35] God there has got to be a manifestation
[13:37] to follow the word of God because
[13:40] Dynamics and mechanics go together
[13:43] praise the Lord and now notice now we
[13:47] are talking when what we are talking
[13:48] about we want to see evidence if we are
[13:51] saying we have the revelation of the
[13:52] word the signs the Wonders the miracles
[13:55] must accompany the ministry and have we
[13:58] seen that accompany the ministry have
[14:00] you seen healings miracles signs and
[14:03] wonders amen hallelujah amen
[14:08] hallelujah Great Signs in the heavens
[14:10] above now watch he's going to continue
[14:12] now he's showing you more evidence Great
[14:16] Signs in the heavens above Angels coming
[14:18] in a
[14:20] constellation and scientists looking off
[14:22] at it predicted months before it
[14:24] happened there it was there it is in
[14:27] Life Magazine told months before before
[14:29] it happened seven angels come down the
[14:32] complete revelation of the six sealed
[14:34] mystery of God would be unfolded and
[14:36] there it was just exactly like he said
[14:39] predicted before it
[14:41] happened now many of us when we look at
[14:44] this picture by now we have digested it
[14:47] and it has become
[14:50] common but this is one of the greatest
[14:54] signs am
[14:56] Hallelujah not only is it a sign
[15:00] it is the start of the returning of the
[15:02] coming of the
[15:04] Lord because he shall descend with a
[15:07] shout yes so this started the Rapture
[15:11] cycle this started the second coming of
[15:14] the Lord amen he shall descend with a
[15:16] shout amen next will come the voice of
[15:18] the Archangel to call out the sleeping
[15:20] Saints amen so this is no ordinary event
[15:23] neither should we look upon this picture
[15:25] as an ordinary Picture This should
[15:28] excite us every time we look at it
[15:30] because he said the prophet says that's
[15:32] our Lord up
[15:33] there amen amen amen so let's not become
[15:38] desensitized to what has been happening
[15:40] within the framework of the message of
[15:42] the
[15:43] hour let's start to place Great Value
[15:45] upon things that have been revealed to
[15:47] us yes amen hallelujah praise the
[15:54] Lord he says and they look around they
[15:57] find all kind of Mystic signs and call
[15:59] them supernatural beings of some kind
[16:02] now you would know about 2 or 3 months
[16:04] ago for the first time they held a
[16:08] hearing in the US about
[16:11] UFOs unidentified flying objects and
[16:15] they were stating specific incidents
[16:17] where fighter pilots had seen these
[16:20] these great big amen things go past them
[16:24] faster than their planes faster than the
[16:26] speed of light they couldn't explain
[16:30] it and it's the first time they've had a
[16:32] public hearing about it you can find it
[16:35] on YouTube you can listen to it the
[16:38] experiences he says they are seeing some
[16:41] kind of Mystic sites call them
[16:42] supernatural beings they call it flying
[16:45] sources fearful signs in the skies on
[16:47] Earth signs the signs point what are
[16:50] these signs now he's telling us what are
[16:52] these signs he says the signs pointing
[16:54] us that the coming of the Lord Jesus is
[16:56] at hand amen
[17:01] Hallelujah he says watch Israel is a
[17:04] nation of her own he going back to
[17:05] another side she's got her own Nation
[17:07] her own flag six point star of David
[17:09] oldest flag in the world flies again for
[17:11] the first time about 2500 years they got
[17:15] their own Army own currency amen
[17:18] represented in the United
[17:20] Nations amen first time for 2500
[17:23] years
[17:25] Hallelujah so when the prophet of God is
[17:28] teaching us to look at signs he's
[17:30] teaching us how to look at Heavenly
[17:32] Bodies he's teaching us how to re read
[17:34] when politics come into play Israel
[17:36] becomes a nation now notice what Jesus
[17:39] said when you see the Fig Tree begin to
[17:41] put forth its Birds know
[17:44] that amen
[17:47] hallelujah and then he also say that
[17:50] this generation shall not pass away
[17:52] which Generation The Generation that
[17:54] sees Israel go back to her
[17:57] Homeland so when she starts to put forth
[17:59] fig leaves is in Spring but he says know
[18:02] that summer is at end summer is when the
[18:05] fruit is on the tree Hallelujah he says
[18:08] this generation shall not pass
[18:12] away until all these things be
[18:16] fulfilled
[18:18] hallelujah amen praise the Lord now we
[18:20] know a generation is 40
[18:22] years and a generation pass aways passes
[18:26] away at 80 years so if you go do the
[18:29] math you'll see what the year
[18:30] is when did Israel become a nation you
[18:33] add 80 years to that because that's the
[18:36] time that that generation which Sayes
[18:38] the return of Israel to the Homeland
[18:40] will start to pass
[18:42] away praise the
[18:44] Lord amen amen now the reason why I'm
[18:49] saying this things are happening all
[18:51] around us at such rapid
[18:55] speed and we don't give a thought to it
[18:57] because we are one about making five R
[19:00] to buy something to
[19:01] eat we are worried about making money we
[19:05] are worried about amen taking care the
[19:07] of the Affairs of Our Lives which is we
[19:10] should be taking care of these things
[19:11] but our focus should be more
[19:14] spiritual amen amen our focus should be
[19:19] our eyes fixed when we reading the news
[19:21] when we are seeing the signs Amen in the
[19:23] heavens we reading the news we seeing
[19:25] politics we should be seeing it because
[19:27] the whole world was open to
[19:31] us amen things happening to
[19:34] us and you're the prophet would say
[19:37] something in the message the angel of
[19:38] the Lord he says over on the east coast
[19:41] they are hollering at
[19:43] me why are you going to the West Coast

[42:19] that's been planted to bring forth a
[42:21] bride the evening Light gospel will
[42:23] bring forth a bride right the next one
[42:26] he says
[42:30] now of us would think that power cuts
[42:34] and blackouts is a
[42:38] sign most of us would write esom a
[42:41] letter or go on the false thing there
[42:44] report of
[42:45] fault blackouts are a
[42:48] sign the prophet in the Rapture message
[42:51] now isn't it strange that not long ago
[42:54] on the East Coast a big the big black
[42:57] out ah but they didn't have enough they
[43:00] didn't have enough
[43:06] energy right now all this city uh this
[43:09] entire
[43:10] place that the fires all the electrical
[43:14] wires and everything got burned there's
[43:16] blackouts
[43:22] there they couldn't understand it Texas
[43:25] blacked out last week they couldn't they
[43:28] can't understand it don't you realize
[43:30] that that's a
[43:35] sign don't you know the nations are
[43:37] breaking Israel is in a Homeland and
[43:40] these signs are indicating that we are
[43:42] at the end the same time it's blacking
[43:44] out don't you know that's a sign the
[43:47] prophet said but there'll be there shall
[43:50] be light in the evening time that the
[43:52] light will come forth in the evening
[43:54] time when the blackouts and things are
[43:56] going the way they are
[43:59] now look at it how it blacked out the
[44:02] pope just come over here remember up at
[44:04] the Tabernacle you got the tapes amen
[44:07] how the Lord showed there exactly what
[44:10] those Church ages would be how they
[44:12] would be I had them draw out on the
[44:14] board then church ages draw out on the
[44:16] board if the Holy Spirit didn't come
[44:18] down in a big Pillar of Fire went right
[44:20] back there on the wall and draw it out
[44:22] itself with three or 400 people sitting
[44:24] looking at it and just as a pop started
[44:27] over here the moon Sumer blacked
[44:31] out and they took their pictures the
[44:33] same way that it was dra up in the
[44:35] heavens on the
[44:37] platform right so the prophet is saying
[44:40] he walked up 13 steps amen went to the
[44:44] made a trip on the 13th walked up 13
[44:46] steps serve communion to 13 to a nation
[44:49] that's a number 13 blackouts coming
[44:51] everywhere don't you see where we at we
[44:53] at the end time amen there's no
[44:56] difference in time than what it
[44:59] was now he says but when you see these
[45:02] things begin to happen raise up your
[45:04] head get ready something could happen at
[45:06] any time Christ come for his
[45:13] church praise the Lord one more thing
[45:15] here about how this is the last quote
[45:18] I'm going to
[45:20] read he says then Jesus Christ said in
[45:22] his ministry when this gospel has been
[45:24] preached to all the world ham Shem and
[45:27] Jeff's people then he would come
[45:30] again now those planets Heavenly planets
[45:34] as they move around they
[45:37] separated now those planets they
[45:40] separated right they've never been on
[45:43] the earth since known but every so 100
[45:46] years they cross their Cycles like this
[45:49] if they happen to be an astronomer here
[45:51] you might know what she's talking about
[45:53] I don't he says they cross like that and
[45:57] in Comm commemoration of the greatest
[45:59] gift that was ever given to mankind when
[46:02] God gave his son on earth when these
[46:04] planets cross themselves again why he
[46:07] said he sends another gift to the Earth
[46:09] so he's talking about this astronomer
[46:11] that was talking to him on the
[46:14] bus he says you were born on the
[46:16] crossing of that time and said that's
[46:19] the reason I knew
[46:22] it praise the Lord so when we are
