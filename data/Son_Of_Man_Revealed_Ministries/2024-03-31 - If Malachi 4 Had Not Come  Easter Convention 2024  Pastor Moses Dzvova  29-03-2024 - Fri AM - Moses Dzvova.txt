amen so I appreciate Pastor M and you know there's something about de the angel of the Lord said go to De it was the climax of The Prophet visit to South Africa amen so I always say when time is prolonged corruption will set in so I don't want to take much time because when Moses delayed to come from the mountain corruption set it was idolatry because time it prolonged and I also want to say to the young people don't stay in courtship for a long time corruption might set in you might forget that you are not yet wored even when Samson delayed to take his wife corruption set in his wife was given to his best friend because time it prolonged you remember even Paul when he preached all night corruption set in fell and died because the message had prolonged so the B says those days will be shortened for the sake of the elect Hallelujah if those dayses were not shortened no soul was going to be saved so this morning the Simon will be short for the sake of the elect amen do you love him can you say hallelujah hallelujah can you say hallelujah hallelujah you know that's 50 % can you say hallelujah hallelujah 70% can you say hallelujah hallelujah 99.9% can you say hallelujah hallelujah

bless you church amen we thank God for a wonderful weather I was told de is hot actually everything is hot in De the food is hot the gospel is hot the weather is hot everything is hot but God has been kind to us am for the where you know I was telling the pastors hey we thank God so Revelation ch 10 you know our familiar scripture Revelation 10 ver 7 God bless you Pastor name Hallelujah Revelation 10 verse 7 it's a familiar one the Bible says but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God you know I like that I like the Bible it not say the Mysteries it says the mystery of God there is only one mystery not Mysteries what is that mystery Christ is the mystery of God reveal Hallelujah Christ is the mystery of God revealed in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be f finished as he declared to his servants the prophets we may be seated may God His blessings to the reading of the word we may be seated hallelujah amen so I just want to see how I start I just want to give a small title I just want to say if Malachi 4 did not come Hallelujah if Malachi 4 did not come what do you think was going to happen my brother in the religious world if malach 4 did not come praise be to God hallelujah if Malachi for did not come H listen to this I just want to start with this quotation how many are under expectation Hallelujah so we are just talking about if Malachi 4 did not come so let's go straight to the word of God the Feast of trumpets the Feast of trumpets 64079 M paragraph 243 the prophet says the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loed in the evening time how many believe in the evening time this Holy Ghost which was bound is to be loosed in this evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh Hall in the evening time he said he promised it so do you see that this Holy Ghost which was bound is to be released in this evening time so we thank God if Malachi 4 did not come how many can say Amen so we thank God for Malachi 4 we had to come with a message that was going to release Hallelujah the Holy Ghost amen do you love him in another quotation I'll just quot it brother says you know I don't care how many names your book how many books your name is on but if the genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is this word manifested you will see the message into the hour hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost this word manifested and the real Holy Ghost will lead you to the message of the hour what is the sign that you have received the Holy Ghost a genuine faith in the promised word of God power that's a sign that you have received the Holy Ghost how many can say amen I I just want to to to say this again in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled Hallelujah 6529 paragraph 146 listen to this what is the Holy Ghost brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you do you what is saying the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting that word what is the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting this word so if you have got a holy ghost you will punctuate every word of God with an amen how many can say Amen praise be to God Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting that word outside of that it can be the Holy Ghost if it says it's the Holy Spirit and denies one word of the Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence whether you believe or not how many can say amen amen accepting the word that's why in another quotation he says wait until the seven thers your voices to that group that can accept the word how many say Amen praise be to God are you happy we thank God for Malachi 4 if William Bram did not come some of our sisters will be preaching huh will be saying give me J give me e we thank God for if not come Hallelujah you love him amen listen we don't worship Malachi 4 how many say amen he our Prophet trly the Bible says You must honor them who among you especially those who in the W so the message and the messenger they are one are we together so you have to Mal is a vessel that was used by God are we together my brother so if you want to drink water H the water comes with the bottle that's the container are we together so you must also respect the container you don't just respect the water only but respect container so we respect he is God's Prophet are we together praise God you remember in the Book of Revelation he said worship me not I'm a fellow servant like you Hallelujah and I was reading one time says you know he says we have heard of many elijas and Elijah's mants but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ oh the last sign that God gave s before the destruction it was God Elohim coming better in human fles are we together and the last sign that God is going to give us today it's God coming in human flesh are we together my brother my sister we thank God for Malachi 4 H praise God if Malachi 4 did not come H listen to this I just want to read quickly H in the message the seed is not a with the Shar 6528 m i want you to see what God has promised us in this end time he says paragraph 128 neither will a Christian eat on that dead Canyons from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour listen now he says God promised Rapids in the days of Lu can you imagine in the days of Luther God promised rabbits he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full a can you say Amen the seven menu for all the Seven Seals are open and

heyes can you tell me H you mean that this message is no sense what are you say says these men when they take this they will give it morees and make it come to life can I give you an example Jesus Christ in Matthew chap 28 he said you must be baptized in the name of the father of the son and of the Holy Ghost that did not make sense but Peter in act 238 he said you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so act 238 makes sense Hallelujah to Matthew 28 how many can say Amen may God help us if you need a Bible listen friend we are so privileged to have men of God here a preacher is a special man how many believe that we are so privileged to have Ministers of this caliber praise to God do love him they giving us a man says what is Hi man Hi man is a special revelation says a little

people ha thunderings but Moses a voice how many can say Amen even when Jesus was speaking H to God those who were around him they said it's standard but Jesus was hearing a voice so a thunder is a voice of God when a seal is open and the prophet was asked the seven thers oh we don't know that they are Thunders yet says they were raled in the Seven Seals so what is a seal a seal is a container how many say like this listen H do you see this water here so We Don't Preach how many can say Amen We Don't Preach seals a seal cannot help you it's just a container we preach the revelation of the Seven Seals how many say Amen huh so the seven THS are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so a SE is a Calvary how many say Amen like if you want to drink this water you don't drink the
