[1:06:40] verse1 the Bible says in those days was
[1:06:46] Hezekiah sick unto death and Isaiah the
[1:06:50] prophet the son of Amos came Hallelujah
[1:06:55] unto
[1:06:56] and said unto him thus said the Lord set
[1:07:01] th house in
[1:07:03] order this is the Lord we all know that
[1:07:08] the Lord can never fail so Isiah was
[1:07:12] sick he was told to put his house in

[1:07:31] putting his house in order he
[1:07:34] prayed against that the Lord verse two
[1:07:40] and said and Hezekiah turned his face
[1:07:44] toward the wall and prayed unto the Lord
[1:07:48] and said remember now oh Lord I besch
[1:07:54] Thee how I have walked before thee in TR
[1:08:00] and with a perfect

[1:08:42] now then came the word of the Lord to
[1:08:45] Isaiah say go okay he says go and say to
[1:08:51] Heek thus say the Lord the god of David
[1:08:55] that

[1:41:09] brother Bram himself he just says you
[1:41:12] are healed go listen now that's me
[1:41:16] saying that go and Jesus Christ makes
[1:41:19] you home sometimes I see it turn that

[1:41:34] is is on Hallelujah and they are going
[1:41:41] to I never tell them that not that I'm
[1:41:47] to tell them watch now because even

[1:41:57] person yet their prayer would change
[1:42:02] that this
[1:42:07] is did you hear that even if God
[1:42:12] pronounces dead upon a person yet the
[1:42:16] prayer of that person can change that so
