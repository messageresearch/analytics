[2:50] of prayer and get our souls quietened
[2:53] down before his presence so that he can
[2:55] speak to us by his word amen i' like to
[3:00] speak Amen on
[3:02] expectations visions and declarations
[3:05] for you in
[3:07] 2025
[3:09] amen you see all of God's promises are
[3:13] yes I gave you a yes amen but the Bible
[3:17] says it's Amen all of God's promises are
[3:20] yes and amen amen so we will speak on
[3:24] expectations visions and declarations
[3:26] for you in
[3:27] 2025 because if we have no Vision where
[3:30] there's no vision the people perish if
[3:33] we have no vision for our life we will
[3:35] not go any further that's how Faith
[3:37] Works if we want to see progress in our
[3:39] life we've got to expect new things amen
[3:42] amen abook chap 2 and verse
[3:52] 2 and the Lord answered me and said
[3:56] write the vision make it plain upon
[3:59] tables
[4:00] that he may run that readeth
[4:03] it so we've got to write down our own
[4:07] Vision our own plan so that when we read
[4:11] it we can run amen don't worry about
[4:14] other people reading it yes amen we can
[4:18] read it and we can run amen amen so
[4:21] don't let your your planner be filled
[4:24] with
[4:27] nothing for the vision is yet for an
[4:30] appointed
[4:31] time but at the end it shall speak and
[4:34] not lie though it t wait for it because
[4:38] it will surely come it will not t so
[4:42] that is God's promise to us
[4:44] now amen things may not happen according
[4:48] to our
[4:49] timeline but wait for it amen amen
[4:53] things are also not continuing as it
[4:55] were God is moving in stages amen
[4:58] Revelation 3 and ver8
[5:00] praise the
[5:02] Lord behold I have set before thee an
[5:05] open door and no man can shut
[5:08] it amen behold I have set before thee an
[5:12] open door and no man can shut it praise
[5:17] the Lord one more verse of scripture
[5:19] then you can be seated
[5:22] Hallelujah Isaiah 43 and verse 19
[5:31] it says behold I will do a new
[5:34] thing now it shall spring
[5:37] forth shall you not know it you see how
[5:40] the Lord speaks he's declaring something
[5:43] that's a
[5:44] declaration behold I will do a new
[5:48] thing now it shall spring forth he's
[5:51] already seeing it shall he not know it I
[5:55] will even make a way in the wilderness
[5:57] and rivers in the desert
[6:00] hallelujah amen you may be
[6:02] seated Hallelujah while we being seated
[6:05] I want to get to Psalms 24:7
[6:08] amen Psalms 247 is very important
[6:11] because we were in Psalm 24 last year
[6:15] and we said who shall Ascend the heill
[6:16] of the Lord but he that had Clean Hands
[6:19] and a pure heart amen then it spoke
[6:21] about opening
[6:23] up lifting up the gates and opening up
[6:27] the Everlasting doors amen
[6:30] 24/7 says lift up your heads oh he Gates
[6:34] and be lift up ye Everlasting doors so
[6:38] open the
[6:39] door and the king of glory shall come in
[6:42] so if we want to ascend the glory realm
[6:45] we've got to have clean hands and a pure
[6:47] heart and
[6:50] amen and we've got to open up ways for
[6:53] the king of glory to be able to come in
[6:56] amen can you say Amen to that amen and
[6:59] the g and the doors how often must they
[7:02] be open well the very chapter and the
[7:05] verse tells you how
[7:07] often how
[7:10] often
[7:12] 24/7 24 hours 7 Days of the Week the
[7:17] doors of Jerusalem Mount Zion ought to
[7:19] be
[7:20] opened the Gates of Jerusalem Mount Zion
[7:23] ought to be open so that the king of
[7:25] glory can come down amen amen so that's
[7:28] an easy scripture to to remember Psalm
[7:31] 247 that's how God must have access to
[7:34] my life praise the Lord and we were
[7:38] reading there that in Revelation 4 and 1
[7:42] and after this I looked and behold a
[7:44] door was opened in heaven and the first
[7:47] voice which I heard was as it were a
[7:49] trumpet talking with me which said come
[7:52] up hither and I will show the things
[7:54] which must be Hereafter now pay
[7:56] attention because brother brandham is
[7:58] saying revelation four is the rapture of
[8:00] the
[8:01] church so which means that it it is
[8:04] doors being open to
[8:06] us and and we'll read in this first
[8:09] quote here brother brandham is saying
[8:11] that the Rapture we're talking about is
[8:12] only for the bride so which means that
[8:16] the door was opened only for the bride
[8:18] but we know the Rapture is not just one
[8:21] event the prophet defined it for us and
[8:23] he told us it's a
[8:25] process it's a shout so which means that
[8:29] the Rapture is opening up in Dimensions
[8:31] to us can you say Amen am hallelujah
[8:35] amen different doors of the Rapture will
[8:37] be
[8:38] opened he says there is going to be a
[8:40] Rapture the Bible says there will be and
[8:43] it will only and it'll be only for the
[8:46] elected the elected lady the bride in
[8:50] this day that's pulled out the church
[8:53] amen praise the Lord now that is
[8:55] beautiful amen that this Rapture the
[8:58] shout our party is only for the bride
[9:01] amen amen pay attention now we're going
[9:03] to get through this now amen so Matthew
[9:05] 25:10 we read this as well while they
[9:08] went to buy the bridegroom came how did
[9:11] he come somebody say with a shout yes
[9:14] and then did he open the door he had to
[9:17] open the door because the very next
[9:18] verse says and they that were ready went
[9:21] in with him to the marriage and the door
[9:23] was shut amen hallelujah so the
[9:25] bridegroom came opened up the door of
[9:27] the Seven Seals amen he opened up a new
[9:30] land to the Bride of Jesus Christ where
[9:32] all things are possible amen amen making
[9:35] things ready for the Mark 11:23 men to
[9:38] come in on the scene making things ready
[9:40] for the Romans 8 men to come in on the
[9:42] scene amen now the promise is not just
[9:44] left with God Alone he has opened it up
[9:46] to us but it requires an application on
[9:48] our part what will we do with the word
[9:51] amen amen now here we're going to detail
[9:54] this just a bit he says when the
[9:56] bridegroom came he opened the door he
[9:57] pulled the bride in and he shut the door
[10:00] yes sir right everyone get that point
[10:02] now in the message proving his word he
[10:04] says it's now how did he do it we want
[10:06] to learn how he did it right this is
[10:08] what the point of it it son of man Jesus
[10:11] Christ will come down in human flesh
[10:13] Among Us that's how he's going to do it
[10:16] and will make his word so real till
[10:19] it'll unite the church and him as one so
[10:22] what happened when he pulled her in to
[10:23] the door there was an invisible Union am
[10:27] amen hallelujah amen
[10:30] see It'll unite the church and him as
[10:33] one the bride but how did it happen
[10:34] don't miss the first part it's through
[10:36] the son of man through God in human
[10:39] flesh yes through God in William
[10:41] brandham can I make it more plain than
[10:42] that amen he pulled us into the
[10:46] door
[10:47] amen now watch it's in two steps
[10:51] there pulled her in United the bride and
[10:55] then she'll go home to the wedding
[10:56] supper so he pulled her into the wedding
[10:58] to the
[11:00] Mar he pulled into the marriage now
[11:02] we're waiting to go to the supper
[11:04] everybody clear with that she's already
[11:08] United see we go to the wedding supper
[11:11] not to the marriage cuz the marriage
[11:13] happens now amen so brother BR is very
[11:16] clear here she's already united we go to
[11:19] the wedding supper not to the marriage
[11:21] amen cuz the marriage of the Lamb has
[11:23] come but the Rapture is going to the
[11:25] wedding supper praise the Lord
[11:28] hallelujah amen
[11:33] amen now there's a there's a verse here
[11:35] I want to read in Psalm
[11:37] 24:14 amen praise the Lord everybody
[11:40] feeling good amen amen Psalm
[11:47] 24:14 we said he opens the door and he
[11:49] pulls it in watch what Psalm 24 sorry
[11:51] 25:14 says there's a private place
[11:54] reserved for the lovers of
[11:57] God so he opens the door he pulls you
[12:00] into that secret place remember we
[12:02] adding to Psalm 27 in the secret of his
[12:05] Tabernacle will he hide me but he
[12:08] already started it now he's pull you
[12:09] into a private
[12:11] place amen where they sit near him and
[12:14] receive the Revelation secrets of his
[12:17] promises amen hallelujah the mystery of
[12:20] God has been revealed the mind of Christ
[12:22] has been revealed the Revelation Secrets
[12:25] has been revealed to us how he opened
[12:27] the door and pulled us into the secret
[12:28] place yes amen amen hallelujah then
[12:32] remember we tying all of these
[12:33] scriptures you got to pay attention to
[12:35] this Genesis 25 and verse 5 watch it's
[12:39] in the 25th verse sorry the 25th chapter
[12:42] and how many years did Abraham wait for
[12:44] the promise 25 years so though the
[12:48] vision t wait for it it must come to
[12:52] pass Super Church super race Invincible
[12:55] Army thr the vision ter wait for it it
[12:58] must come to pass us
[13:00] amen amen
[13:04] amen and Abraham gave all that he had
[13:07] unto
[13:08] Isaac Hallelujah that's the Dimensional
[13:11] Doors I'm talking about now amen he's
[13:13] giving all to the bride amen God don't
[13:17] work with two Ministries at the same
[13:18] time hallelujah
[13:21] amen you you'll see now as we continue
[13:24] in 25:6 you see he gave all that he had
[13:28] unto Isaac he gave him everything he
[13:31] gave the bride everything but watch the
[13:33] next verse and Unto the Sons of the con
[13:36] concubines which Abraham had Abraham
[13:38] gave gifts they are satisfied with the
[13:43] gifts amen and what he did he sent them
[13:47] away he closed the door to any further
[13:51] blessing come on somebody praise the
[13:53] Lord he closes the door to any further
[13:55] blessing he gives them gifts and sends
[13:57] them away amen
[14:00] but watch now it's not over for Isaac
[14:02] yet and from Isaac his son he sent them
[14:04] away from who you see why there's a
[14:06] separation between the bride and
[14:08] denominations he sent them away from
[14:11] Isaac his son you see why they are
[14:12] leaving the message he sent them away
[14:15] from Isaac his son you see why they are
[14:17] saying they don't believe the sign he
[14:20] sent them away from Isaac
[14:23] amen wonderful while he yet looked
[14:26] Eastward unto a East Country now in
[14:28] verse 11 it says and it came to pass
[14:30] after the death of
[14:32] Abraham that God blessed his son
[14:36] Isaac after the
[14:39] death after the death of Moses Joshua
[14:41] could get into the promised land amen
[14:44] hallelujah after the son of man was
[14:46] revealed through William Brandon can
[14:48] Revelation 108 to11 come in on the scene
[14:51] amen God don't work with two people at
[14:53] the same time amen so it's after the
[14:55] death of Abraham that God blessed his
[14:57] son Isaac amen and Isaac dwelt by The
[15:00] Well of La orai if you only knew what
[15:03] the well of La orai means that word
[15:05] means a living well amen that well is
[15:07] typing Jesus Christ the inexhaustible
[15:10] Fountain of Life so Isaac is dwelling by
[15:12] the inexhaustable Fountain of
[15:15] Life now maybe some of you are thinking
[15:18] he you sound like a uh like you're
[15:20] saying every year there's new promises
[15:23] you're going through Psalm 23 you're
[15:24] showing us the angel of the Lord leading
[15:26] the church you're going to Psalm 24
[15:27] you're showing us who shall ascend the
[15:29] hill of the Lord he that had Clean Hands
[15:31] and a pure heart and the glory realm
[15:33] amen the bride living in that Glory
[15:34] realm the sh of Glory coming down upon
[15:36] the believer amen you mean every year
[15:39] there's something
[15:41] new amen you mean every year there's
[15:44] something new well can I let that
[15:46] Prophet answer it for you let's get to
[15:49] the message Shalom it says God stands on
[15:53] the promised word for each new year amen
[15:57] so somebody needs to the mind of Christ
[16:00] for the promises of God for each new
[16:02] year come on now this is our Prophet
[16:05] speaking God don't stand on the promised
[16:07] for last year or the year before God
[16:10] stands on the promised word for each new
[16:13] year amen he stands on it this
[16:17] year to fulfill what he promised what he
[16:20] has got promised for this year
[16:23] yesterday's blessings was good last
[16:26] year's anointing was good but I want the
[16:28] pro promises for this
[16:30] year they are new Every Morning H amen
[16:33] he says whatever it is right whatever it
[16:37] is I want to be right in the center of
[16:39] his will in the future like they did
[16:43] amen amen now he types Abraham what were
[16:45] we talking about like Abraham when he
[16:47] met his Crossroads he didn't know how he
[16:50] would do it God told him I'm going to
[16:52] give you a son 25 years he waited for it
[16:55] every 2,000 years God does something on
[16:57] the earth amen 25 years we have waited
[17:00] for it amen amen finally the Sun come
[17:04] and God said now by this sun I'm going
[17:07] to make you a father of many nations
[17:09] amen take him up there and kill him
[17:12] destroy the very thing he had waited 25
[17:15] years on Abraham never worried it never
[17:18] bothered him he picked up the wood and
[17:20] put it on a donkey and took his son took
[17:23] him on the top of the hill to offer him
[17:26] because Abraham knew he received him as
[17:28] one from the dead
[17:29] Sarah's whom was dead he was sterile he
[17:32] was 100 years old she was 90 so he come
[17:35] by the promised word if God told him to
[17:38] offer him up God was able to raise him
[17:41] up amen hallelujah he says we must
[17:45] believe God the same way God is able to
[17:48] raise up the promises for our day how
[17:51] many of you believe that amen God is
[17:52] able to raise up the promises for our
[17:54] day amen we may seem dead amen some of
[17:58] the promises May him dead the bride will
[18:00] be a super chur super rais but it's a
[18:02] promise amen amen it's a promise yes
[18:05] Hallelujah she'll be an invincible Army
[18:08] but I'm holding on to the promises of
[18:09] God Amen I may not see it amen this is
[18:12] not the prophet now this is my notes if
[18:14] you were just wondering amen I may not
[18:16] see it but I have the evidence of the
[18:18] promised land who brought it Joshua and
[18:20] Caleb brought back the evidence of the
[18:22] land who is Joshua the prophet who is
[18:25] Caleb the one that stayed faithful to
[18:27] the prophet's message
[18:30] now here what the prophet also says in
[18:32] Shalom so the new year is determined by
[18:36] God somebody tell your neighbor 2025 is
[18:39] determined by God
[18:41] 202 and nobody can stop it
[18:45] no are you reading it what the prophet
[18:47] is saying the new year is determined by
[18:51] God not by us the new year is determined
[18:55] by God right just determine now all we
[18:58] can do is stay in his word
[19:01] amen amen
[19:04] hallelujah amen
[19:06] and how many of you are determined to
[19:09] stay with the word amen amen amen praise
[19:12] the
[19:12] Lord and I was thinking about it I am
[19:15] more determined now more than ever
[19:18] before that mes Corporation or motus
[19:22] group is not going to use me more in the
[19:25] Kingdom of the world than God is going
[19:27] to use me in the Kingdom of Heaven
[19:30] am I will not give my spiritual
[19:32] resources to
[19:34] nothingness my energy and my strength to
[19:37] just earning a few rents amen hallelujah
[19:40] I am not going to devote much of my time
[19:43] and effort and energy more on the
[19:45] Natural Things of life more than the
[19:47] kingdom of God priorities have to
[19:50] change amen it has to
[19:53] shift we can't expect new things of God
[19:56] now we can't expect the blessings or or
[19:59] the results of blessings of God without
[20:01] the sacrifice for it we want all the the
[20:04] spiritual rewards of Christ but we want
[20:07] to give him the least we want to give
[20:09] Christ the least and expect the best
[20:11] results the best rewards it don't work
[20:13] that way amen so I'm determined more
[20:15] than ever before that this year we're
[20:18] going to work more in the kingdom of God
[20:19] than in the corporate world Amen or can
[20:22] somebody amen identify with that word am
[20:26] we are not going to give ourselves to
[20:27] pharaoh we were born for a purpose amen
[20:30] amen I will not become a slave to my job

[20:34] world than in the kingdom of God this
[20:37] amen thy will what did Jesus say thy
[20:39] kingdom come thy will be
[20:42] done on Earth this earth now can we say
[20:45] that about ourselves I will not put more
[20:47] effort in my schooling than the kingdom
[20:49] of God come on young people so dedicated
[20:52] to our schooling so dedicated to our
[20:54] studies but yet when it comes to the
[20:57] things of God we ask you to read the

[21:37] will not put more effort into my work

[21:41] our strength of
[21:42] life doesn't the Bible says seek ye
[21:45] first the kingdom of God and his
[21:47] righteousness then all of these things
[21:49] shall be added unto us didn't Jesus say
[21:52] that our righteousness must exceed the
[21:54] righteousness of the Pharisees didn't
[21:56] Jesus say that then that means more must
[21:59] be done for the kingdom of God than for
[22:00] the corporate
[22:03] world not many amens on that Hallelujah

[26:42] abundantly there should be nothing
[26:44] lacking in the bride so I'm speaking

[26:59] am breaking amen the old way of things
[27:01] going on in your life amen and what you
[27:03] have determined for your life God will
[27:05] supersede it but it comes with laws and
[27:06] principles amen I'm declaring and
[27:09] speaking new things over your life I'm
[27:10] speaking Genesis 22 and 17 over your
[27:13] life God won't call you look look at
[27:15] this
[27:16] 22:17 in blessing I Will Bless thee how
[27:20] will you bless me Lord in multiplying I
[27:22] will multiply thee God's not going to
[27:25] call you and make you a father of many
[27:27] nations and then you can't take care of
[27:28] the many
[27:29] nations you know you get these people
[27:31] make babies everywhere they can't take
[27:32] care of them the mother must go collect
[27:34] maintenance God doesn't want you to
[27:36] collect maintenance come on now amen God
[27:39] doesn't want you to collect
[27:44] maintenance thank you you know people
[27:46] get nervous when you speak like this
[27:48] thank you Lord I am showing you my God
[27:50] who told Abraham this and are we the
[27:53] children of Abraham did he say that I
[27:56] will bless your seed are we Abraham sure
[27:58] come on we sing Abraham's blessings are
[28:01] mine Hallelujah Abraham's blessings are
[28:03] mine God didn't call Abraham to live in
[28:06] poverty that's right amen God blessed
[28:09] him abundantly look fact that was one of
[28:11] God's promises for his life and Abraham
[28:14] didn't have to wait 25 years for
[28:16] that God blessed him amen hallelujah he
[28:20] waited for the son 25 years but when he
[28:22] came to his material blessings when he
[28:24] came to his financial blessings God
[28:26] blessed him abundantly amen
[28:28] yes some people don't like this kind of
[28:30] preaching but I'm preaching the word
[28:36] anyway Amen in blessing I Will Bless
[28:39] thee in multiplying I will multiply thee
[28:42] thy seed as the stars of heaven and as
[28:44] the sand which is upon the seashore and
[28:47] thy seed shall possess the gates of the
[28:49] enemies amen these are the same Gates
[28:51] amen that Jesus told Peter the Gates of
[28:54] Hell will not
[28:56] Prevail amen so when God blesses he
[28:58] multiplies he has no sorrow but how does
[29:01] God bless you may ask how does God bless
[29:04] is there anything required on my part we
[29:06] have to work with laws and principles I
[29:08] can't bypass procedures for you
[29:10] here let's go to Luke 638 there you'll
[29:13] see how you want me to be blessed Lord
[29:18] how you going to give me back he says
[29:26] give amen if you're okay is for amen
[29:29] maybe we can try it here let's try it
[29:31] here because I don't know if it's the
[29:35] cable or if it's this we can read it off
[29:38] here
[29:40] hallelujah Luke 6:38 somebody write this
[29:44] down it says give what's the first
[29:51] word tell your neighbor give
[29:59] every I want you to give
[30:04] up
[30:05] amen praise the
[30:10] Lord let me see if I can get into
[30:12] reading
[30:26] mode if you can see that
[30:28] so Luke 6:38 says give amen did you tell
[30:32] your neighbor to give and what did they
[30:35] say
[30:40] stingy now if the one who said let there
[30:42] be is telling you to
[30:45] give you see we can't expect the
[30:47] blessing without the first part amen
[30:50] give and it shall be given unto you
[30:53] straight away he's telling I'll give
[30:54] unto you how good measure press down see
[30:59] he's not going to Peck the bag he's
[31:01] going to tie those things down
[31:04] tight press down good
[31:08] measure amen shaken together and running
[31:13] over there shall be an overflow shall
[31:16] men give where is it coming from don't
[31:20] stay in your room and expect the windows
[31:23] of Heaven to open who's going to give it
[31:24] to you so you must work and God is going
[31:28] to cause those men to give it to you oh
[31:30] come on somebody's reading the Bible
[31:31] with me H bro I thought you said I have
[31:33] to stay in my room and pray and
[31:34] somebody's going to knock on my door and
[31:36] come and say there's a suitcase full of
[31:39] uh I thought they going to knock on my
[31:41] door and come give me the car
[31:43] key you got to work and God will bless
[31:45] the labors of your
[31:47] hands
[31:49] amen shall who give to
[31:52] you okay who did you God use to bless
[31:55] Abraham and give him cattle and give him
[32:00] things use men right that's the point
[32:03] I'm trying to say God used men to bless
[32:07] Abraham praise the
[32:09] Lord shall men give into your bosom for
[32:12] with the same measure that you meet with
[32:15] all it shall be measured to you again
[32:17] now don't lose track of that definition
[32:19] and what he's saying there I want
[32:20] another version so you can understand it
[32:22] it says give
[32:24] generously and generous gifts will be
[32:27] given back to you
[32:28] shaken down to make room for
[32:32] more abundant gifts will pour out upon
[32:36] you with such an overflowing measure
[32:39] that it will run over the top is that
[32:41] overflow amen amen now this is the last
[32:44] part I said don't miss the translation
[32:46] your measurement of generosity becomes
[32:49] your measurement of return
[32:52] amen amen hallelujah amen your
[32:54] measurement of generosity becomes your
[32:56] measure of return
[33:00] amen amen hallelujah so how do we do it

[33:06] year must be the

[37:08] new
[37:08] things which means we must make a
[37:11] spiritual
[37:14] investment praise the Lord
[37:16] [Music]
[37:18] amen how do we do it brother
[37:21] brandom if you want to remember the old

[37:45] the glory
[37:46] realm amen what it meant and asked amen
[37:52] what we did at the bedside when we got
[37:53] up then come to the table where we
[37:55] usually a little family altar gather
[37:58] around the table and pray you see we've
[38:00] got to develop good spiritual habits
[38:03] read our Bible now there's no excuse why
[38:06] we should not read our Bible and
[38:08] everybody said amen if we call ourselves
[38:12] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[38:13] are feeding on the word there's no
[38:15] reason why we should not read our Bibles
[38:18] amen amen in fact there you have
[38:21] technology in your hands if you go to
[38:24] the Play Store or the Apple Store you
[38:26] can go and read the oneyear Bible amen
[38:30] amen you can set up a reading plan every
[38:33] day it'll give you chapters to read you
[38:36] can follow that and by the 31st of
[38:38] December you would have read the whole
[38:43] Bible
[38:45] amen praise the Lord but you see it
[38:49] requires spiritual
[38:50] discipline that's what it requires
[38:52] spiritual discipline now we always try
[38:55] to make a Abbot
[38:59] we try to make it
[39:01] what a of
[39:03] praying a night before we go to bed
[39:06] since I was converted get up of a
[39:09] morning it's too dark too Misty for me
[39:10] to walk I don't know where I'm going but
[39:12] if I just ask him to take my hand and
[39:15] guide me through the day so make it a
[39:17] habit to pray am come on now you're not
[39:20] listening to me some of you are ignoring
[39:21] me tell your neighbor make it a to
[39:26] pray we see many of us are rejoicing
[39:28] when we say God's going to bless you
[39:30] God's going to give but when he telling
[39:31] you how he's going to do it people are
[39:33] quiet because they don't want to get
[39:35] through the spiritual discipline of
[39:37] it praise the
[39:53] Lord
[39:55] amen so maybe you're saying I I haven't
[39:57] connected in 2023 with the angel of God
[40:00] maybe you're saying I haven't ascended
[40:02] the hill of the Lord I haven't ascended
[40:03] the glory realm I don't have clean hands
[40:05] and a pure heart maybe you're saying
[40:08] amen that amen you're talking about amen
[40:11] Dimensional Doors being opened up Heaven
[40:13] coming down upon the Earth the bride
[40:15] being taken into to that secret place
[40:18] mysteries of God revealed to her Power
[40:19] released to the church amen Dimensional
[40:23] Doors I'm talking about Dimensional
[40:25] Doors amen amen meaning that even right
[40:29] now God can open you up dimensionally
[40:32] thank you Jesus amen
[40:37] hallelujah maybe you're thinking what
[40:39] I'm talking about what am I talking
[40:41] about God when God opens up new promise
[40:44] to you he's taking you to higher
[40:45] Dimensions
[40:47] amen so which means that some things
[40:49] were close to you but it's for a time in
[40:51] a season I just want you to get you what
[40:54] dimensions are he says remember we live
[40:56] in three dimensions light time and
[40:58] [Music]
[41:00] matter amen praise the
[41:03] Lord what what time did I start at
[41:06] 9 amen praise the Lord I'm losing track
[41:08] of time here because we keep changing
[41:10] the service times amen praise the lord
[41:14] we live in three
[41:15] dimensions now how many of you are
[41:17] conscious conscious of these three
[41:22] dimension when I'm saying how many of
[41:24] you know that you are physically
[41:25] contacting the dimension of time or the
[41:28] dimension of matter or the dimension of
[41:31] light it becomes so natural to
[41:34] you praise the Lord amen we live in a
[41:38] three dimensions like time matter and
[41:41] our five senses contact these
[41:44] Dimensions our sight context light you
[41:47] see what brother brand is giving you the
[41:48] key now sight context light feelings
[41:51] context matter and so forth but we have
[41:54] to but we have contact through science
[41:57] to the fourth dimension
[41:59] now so we never had that Dimension
[42:02] before how is he saying we got it
[42:05] through
[42:06] science prior to this we knew that the
[42:09] prophets could see
[42:10] visions that was God's Communication
[42:13] channel with these prophets and only
[42:15] they were blessed with this
[42:16] communication portal the fourth
[42:19] dimension but now he says through
[42:21] science we have the fourth
[42:24] dimension because coming through this
[42:26] building comes picture voices of radio
[42:28] pictures of Television that our Sensers
[42:30] do not contact but yet the tube or
[42:33] Crystal picks up ether waves and
[42:35] manifest them right in this building now
[42:37] is live actions of people in the air
[42:39] live voices they hear we know it they
[42:42] absolutely the truth and the only thing
[42:44] you do they catch it on I understand the
[42:48] mechanics of those things science has
[42:50] invented but we know that it proves that
[42:52] there is a fourth dimension I'm trying
[42:54] to show you the dimensions that exist
[42:56] that we never knew about
[42:59] before but now that this Dimension has
[43:01] been opened up to us we can enjoy the
[43:03] benefits of
[43:04] iten he says The Fifth Dimension is
[43:07] where the sinner the unbeliever dies The
[43:09] Fifth Dimension kind of well a horrible
[43:12] Dimension and when a Christian dies he
[43:15] goes into the sixth Dimension and God is
[43:18] in the seventh
[43:20] Dimension praise the
[43:24] Lord what we need is a holy ghost
[43:26] atmosphere
[43:27] an atmosphere where the power of God is
[43:29] moving one Accord one place gathered
[43:33] together under the atmosphere of
[43:34] expecting God to move down and do signs
[43:36] and wonders let's move oursel up into
[43:39] that bracket Hallelujah so he's saying
[43:41] there has to be a conscious decision
[43:43] where we move into the dimension of the
[43:45] Holy Ghost amen Step Up in faith move
[43:49] out of these three dimensions up into
[43:50] the next one am the Holy Ghost is a
[43:54] four-dimensional amen so we become
[43:55] four-dimensional beings

[44:01] time and matter but living by the Holy
[44:03] Ghost

[44:55] things and that expect he will get that
[44:57] Unity among the
[45:02] people I also want to say if God closed
[45:04] doors in your life make sure you go
[45:06] there and nail it
[45:08] closed that those persons who chose to
[45:11] walk out of your life can never come
[45:15] in
[45:19] Hallelujah why should they enjoy the
[45:21] benefits of a Son of God yes amen nail
[45:26] it sh
[45:28] amen praise the
[45:37] Lord Brother BR talking about Dimensions
[45:40] now he says five senses we live in
[45:42] that's just a little world of our own
[45:44] now I'm trying to show you something
[45:47] here that animal life plant life don't
[45:52] know the world that humans live in
[45:57] we live in a world of our own they can't
[46:00] comprehend our world because we are the
[46:02] highest form everybody's understanding
[46:04] me even though they exist in the
[46:06] world dimensionally they are not of the
[46:08] same caliber as us I'm trying to show
[46:11] you spiritually even though we exist in
[46:13] the world with other people
[46:16] dimensionally we don't exist in the same
[46:18] plane as them we live in a world of our
[46:22] own we are seated together in Heavenly
[46:24] places in Jesus Christ
[46:28] you see there is senses beyond that
[46:31] another Dimensions God is always present
[46:35] if we could only remember that you see
[46:37] now he's going to open up Dimensions to
[46:39] us he says the angels of the Lord are
[46:41] encamped around them that fear Him a
[46:43] dimension but can you see
[46:45] it but it's
[46:47] there the scripture is telling you that
[46:49] the angels of God are encamps around you
[46:52] amen so it's a dimension that's there in
[46:56] this building tonight stands Jesus
[46:58] Christ in this building tonight is a
[47:00] host of angels thousands of them
[47:02] gathered around you don't see them but
[47:04] you can feel the influence of
[47:06] them telling you that they're here if
[47:09] that isn't so then scripture isn't so
[47:11] and if the scripture isn't right then
[47:12] God isn't right the Bible says the angel
[47:14] of God encamped they don't leave they
[47:17] stay near to those that fear Him Jesus
[47:19] said wherever two or three are gathered
[47:21] in my name I'll be in their midst that
[47:23] makes him in a world that we cannot see
[47:26] that our senses don't contact Jesus
[47:28] Christ is here present if we could be
[47:31] conscious to that trying to show you
[47:33] there are dimensions that exist in us
[47:35] around
[47:36] us come on church that we've got to tap
[47:40] into and these Dimensional Doors can
[47:41] open up to
[47:43] us he says not only here but when you're
[47:46] walking down the street wherever you are
[47:48] you that profess to be Believers and
[47:50] fear the lord remembers the angels of
[47:53] God are moving with you wherever you are
[47:56] when I go to work work the angels of God
[47:57] are moving with me when I go to school
[48:00] the angels of God are moving with me
[48:02] amen wherever I go through the fire the
[48:04] angels of God are moving with me through
[48:06] the trial the angels of God are with me
[48:09] amen
[48:12] hallelujah praise the Lord thank you
[48:15] Lord what must we do now he says they
[48:19] watch everything you do every thought
[48:21] that goes through your mind they know
[48:23] all about you therefore we must be
[48:25] conscious of that if you're not
[48:27] conscious of it then you act any way so
[48:30] people mostly today too many people are
[48:31] not conscious of the presence of the
[48:33] Lord Jesus that's the reason they or we
[48:36] have these things that we have going on
[48:38] right now that's not
[48:41] right listen what brother brand is
[48:43] saying now this what you see happen here
[48:46] in the meeting that spirit that comes
[48:48] and packs out into Dimension that the
[48:51] world knows nothing about amen you
[48:53] sitting in the audience will just see
[48:55] brother Brandon there as a normal man
[48:57] talking you'll think it's just a
[48:59] prophetic gift but he's saying what is
[49:01] happening is the the holy spirit is
[49:03] coming and packing him into another
[49:06] dimension yeah he'll define it if you
[49:08] only knew my dear sister you're standing
[49:10] at the same place so there's a sister
[49:11] standing there you're aware as a
[49:13] Believer right now something's going on
[49:16] I turned around this way and started
[49:17] talking real sweet humble feeling come
[49:21] amen cuz between you and I probably
[49:24] never seen the picture of it that light
[49:25] is just Milling between you and I amen
[49:28] I'd like to believe that light is here
[49:30] right now Milling between you and
[49:32] I you see maybe you're just in the three
[49:35] dimensions see you're sitting there
[49:37] there's another dimension here but maybe
[49:40] you're just sitting there in the three
[49:41] dimensions now this is another dimension
[49:45] it's moving in on me but it's a spirit
[49:48] in it's in another
[49:50] world people they're not gone they're
[49:53] near us angels and everything else
[49:55] angels of God and camp around them that
[49:57] fear Him you remember Elisha and Doan
[49:59] that morning the Syrian armies there's
[50:03] more with us than there is with them he
[50:05] couldn't see anybody but Elisha said God
[50:08] open them young man's
[50:11] eyes and when he opened his eyes around
[50:13] that old Prophet was angels of fire and
[50:16] Chariots of Fire then there's more with
[50:18] us than there's with them and that's the
[50:21] dimension Now by being born again maybe
[50:23] you never will see such but you believe
[50:26] it anyhow how much greater is the reward
[50:29] who have never seen yet believe but some
[50:31] of us were born for that God places that
[50:34] in the church from baby birth prophets
[50:36] are not just put in by man it's a gift
[50:38] born all through scripture born from
[50:41] childhood watch how he says this now if
[50:44] the audience can still hear me he
[50:46] doesn't even know if the audience is
[50:47] hearing him because he's caught up in
[50:48] this
[50:49] Dimension if the audience can still hear
[50:52] me the angel of the Lord is settling and
[50:54] I know that I'm being heard somewhere
[50:58] but she's suffering what I think is a
[50:59] broken rib she's got a
[51:01] lump
[51:03] see I'm just trying to show you that you
[51:07] walking in this world you are caught up
[51:09] in another
[51:10] dimension and God are going to open up
[51:12] more Dimensions to you
[51:14] amen I said God is going to open up more
[51:16] Dimensions to you
[51:19] amen amen praise the
[51:24] Lord I got much more go
[51:28] amen
[51:31] hallelujah yeah I just want to maybe
[51:33] read this in glorify Jesus he says the
[51:36] first thing he's talking about going up
[51:38] another dimension now he says going this
[51:40] way the first thing is the spirit of a
[51:43] man catch this now the spirit of the man
[51:46] he's talking about Jesus Christ the
[51:48] spirit of a man that died and rose again
[51:50] Christ the Holy Spirit that's what
[51:53] influences the believer going upward
[51:57] the next is Angelic beings the next is
[52:00] heaven the third heaven you see what
[52:03] happens out of your three dimensions
[52:05] next is the Holy Ghost amen he says
[52:07] after that is
[52:11] angels I thought you wanted new things
[52:13] to be declared over you I thought you
[52:15] wanted Dimensional Doors to be opened to
[52:17] you so I'm saying if you never got it in
[52:19] 2024 if you never got it in
[52:22] 2023 write the vision though it t wait
[52:26] for for it sometimes it was not meant
[52:28] for you to receive
[52:30] it as fast as
[52:33] others sometimes it is still the same
[52:35] vision continuing so don't throw away
[52:38] what you wrote down last
[52:39] year hello don't throw away what you
[52:42] wrote down last year if it wasn't time
[52:44] and season wait for it God will bring

[54:04] to teach you how to manage
[54:07] money some people have been mismanaging
[54:09] money that's why you're in the problem
[54:11] you
[54:12] are even Jesus said before you start a
[54:14] project consider the cost and see if you
[54:17] have enough he says otherwise the
[54:19] unbeliever will say look at this person
[54:21] claiming to be a Christian they can't
[54:22] even live so live within your means and
[54:26] ask God to bless
