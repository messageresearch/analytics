[0:00] have time to read it now about how God
[0:02] answers amen maybe not according to our
[0:05] time and season but according to his own
[0:07] time he says if he answered immediately
[0:09] we would never learn patience but he
[0:11] wants to teach us amen develop us as a
[0:13] son and daughter of God Amen so let's uh
[0:16] Stand Together amen as we turn to the
[0:19] word of the Lord praise the Lord we'll
[0:21] turn to Exodus chapter 23 read from
[0:24] verse 20
[0:38] Exodus 23 and: 20 says behold I send an
[0:42] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[0:47] way amen so when he introduces the angel
[0:50] he's just introducing him as an angel
[0:53] but you'll see 23 will'll change it into
[0:55] a more personal thought I sent an angel
[0:58] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[1:00] to bring thee into the place which I
[1:02] have prepared so no son and daughter of
[1:04] God is going without
[1:06] leadership amen that's the first Exodus
[1:09] it happened in the second Exodus it must
[1:11] happen in the third so I want you to
[1:13] rest assured there's an Angel going
[1:15] before you if you're a son and daughter
[1:17] of God called amen into the shout
[1:19] message at this end time there's an
[1:20] Angel going before you beware of him
[1:23] obey his voice provoke him not for he
[1:26] will not pardon your transgressions for
[1:28] my name is in him amen
[1:31] hallelujah but if Thou shalt indeed obey
[1:33] his voice and do all that I speak then I
[1:36] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[1:39] an adversary unto thine adversaries so
[1:42] nothing can happen to a child of God
[1:44] Amen without God being involved praise
[1:47] the Lord this is the verse I love for M
[1:49] angel now he makes it personal not just
[1:52] an angel M Angel shall go before
[1:56] thee and bring thee unto the amorites
[1:58] itits perizzites Canaanites evites and
[2:01] jebusites and I will cut them off amen
[2:04] praise the Lord we'll go to Hebrews
[2:06] chapter 11
[2:10] amen praise the
[2:14] Lord amen we can just read verse
[2:18] one
[2:20] amen now Faith is a substance of things
[2:23] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[2:26] Seen amen you may be seated the Lord had
[2:29] blessings the reading of his
[2:33] word amen so if I title this I just want
[2:36] to title it through revelation we obtain
[2:40] the promise and defeat Satan's kingdom
[2:42] amen
[2:44] amen now we know that faith is a
[2:46] revelation the prophet teaches us that
[2:49] faith is a revelation we cannot progress
[2:52] in the kingdom of God without Revelation
[2:54] therefore we've had a prophetic word
[2:56] released to the bride Amen to bring her
[2:58] into revelation amen amen God didn't
[3:01] leave us amen without an understanding
[3:03] of the word in fact the Hidden Mysteries
[3:05] have been revealed to us and though it
[3:07] sound foreign to the church world and
[3:09] they can't understand these Hidden
[3:11] Mysteries it's because of Revelation and
[3:13] that Jean seed that God has placed
[3:15] within us that we are able to understand
[3:17] these things amen now God don't use
[3:20] intellectual knowledge God don't use
[3:23] intellectualism amen we can't use our
[3:25] own intellect to understand the kingdom
[3:27] of God without the Holy Spirit if we sit
[3:30] down with the church age books Seven
[3:32] Seals books and all the messes messages
[3:34] and try to understand it from a human
[3:37] standpoint we will never get the
[3:39] revelation of the message because it's
[3:41] hidden in Simplicity and revealed to
[3:43] those who have a genene seed I'm saying
[3:45] this message is not revealed to anybody
[3:48] it's revealed to those that have the
[3:49] Jean seed locked up inside of them amen
[3:52] and what a special class of people we
[3:54] are amen so we know that God anoints
[3:57] Sons and Daughters who have a gen SE in
[4:00] this hour amen hallelujah so I'm trying
[4:02] to show you that we are a special class
[4:04] of people that we are sitting sitting
[4:06] here today not great in the eyes of the
[4:08] world in the eyes of the world not much
[4:11] to look at but we carry something on the
[4:13] inside of us that is why science is
[4:16] trying to progress at a rapid rate
[4:18] because God is quickening his Gene seed
[4:20] so they are trying to modify the gene
[4:22] seed in man and try to make that genene
[4:24] seed
[4:25] perfect Hallelujah you understand
[4:28] science is trying to catch up with what
[4:30] God is doing yes they are trying to
[4:32] eliminate sicknesses by amen touching
[4:35] the gene that's in a man touching
[4:38] genetics they saying they can remove
[4:40] cancer they can remove heart trouble
[4:42] they can remove sugar diabetes by
[4:44] tampering with the
[4:46] gene Hallelujah but God is saying I can
[4:50] take you from mortality to immortality
[4:53] because of the Gen seed that's within
[4:55] you Hallelujah but they will never catch
[4:58] up to God God is just allowing them to
[5:01] probe in his laboratory God is just
[5:03] allowing them to Temple with things God
[5:05] is allowing science to progress because
[5:08] of the Bride of Jesus
[5:09] Christ Hallelujah he's allowing them
[5:13] into the laboratory because there are
[5:14] certain things amen that needs to be
[5:16] unlocked at this time in season amen and
[5:20] can only be unlocked in this time in
[5:22] season now those that carry the jeene
[5:26] seed amen you are worth the prophet say
[5:29] 10,000 ,000
[5:30] worlds 10,000 worlds and if it means the
[5:34] great creator of heavens and earth the
[5:37] one that formed amen the galaxies were
[5:39] just his breath amen that said let there
[5:42] be and there was if it means that he
[5:45] must now take on the form of Flesh to
[5:48] come and save you save me that was lost
[5:52] amen he is not amen he's willing to even
[5:55] do that take on the robe of Flesh take
[5:57] on the robe of humility leave all of of
[5:59] heaven and come down in the form Amen in
[6:02] the stinking stable and come and die for
[6:05] you and I not only die but resurrect and
[6:08] because he resurrects we live also amen
[6:11] because Jesus said amen in the you know
[6:14] it's written there in John 3:16 God so
[6:16] loved the world he gave his only
[6:18] begotten son that whosoever believeth on
[6:21] him should not perish but have
[6:23] everlasting life our lord Jesus also
[6:26] said all that the father has given me
[6:28] will come to me amen
[6:30] and not one of them is lost who is he
[6:33] talking about you and I the ones with
[6:35] Jean seeds hallelujah amen the father
[6:38] was veiled in flesh and mocked amen he
[6:41] was beaten ridiculed spat upon murdered
[6:45] but he rose again amen amen hallelujah
[6:49] praise the Lord because he won't leave
[6:51] his sons and daughters trapped in
[6:53] Satan's Eden Hallelujah so we are
[6:56] precious in His sight Jesus loves the
[6:58] little children
[7:00] all his children in the world red and
[7:02] yellow black and white they are precious
[7:04] in His sight Jesus loves the children of
[7:07] the world talking about his jeene seed
[7:10] amen hallelujah now the prophet also
[7:13] tells us that Jesus was the fullness of
[7:16] the
[7:17] word now he's trying to get this point
[7:19] across to the people and he's telling us
[7:21] that we individually are are the
[7:25] word how many of you believe you are the
[7:27] word yes amen now he says Jesus was the
[7:30] fullness of the word so you are to exist
[7:34] in Jesus amen yes amen come on now get
[7:38] the thought that Prophet is trying to
[7:40] convey now he's saying each one of us
[7:42] are an expression of the word we are the
[7:45] word manifested but he's saying when
[7:48] Jesus was made flesh the fullness of the
[7:51] word was locked up in Jesus am you know
[7:54] that's John chapter 1 the word was made
[7:57] flesh in the beginning was the word what
[7:59] was with God what was God and the word
[8:01] became
[8:03] flesh so that scene is exactly how when
[8:06] God created Adam amen he was locked up
[8:10] inside of Adam so when Jesus comes to
[8:12] the Earth the bride who is the word is
[8:15] locked up in the fullness of the
[8:17] word hallelujah so he says when he
[8:20] walked the streets of Jerusalem we
[8:23] walked the streets with him when he was
[8:25] beaten we were beaten when he was put on
[8:28] the cross we were put on the cross amen
[8:31] and when the Roman soldier put that
[8:33] spear in his side the bride was released
[8:36] amen hallelujah amen blessed be the name
[8:39] of the Lord amen so we are part of Jesus
[8:42] we are part of the word that's why at
[8:44] this end time amen he's coming to unite
[8:47] back with his Jean seeds back with the
[8:49] word he will only Unite with the word in
[8:51] this time and season so his word as
[8:53] creative power and he sent a word bya
[8:56] the message of the hour to Quicken us
[8:58] and turn our heart back to the faith of
[9:01] the original father amen he opened up
[9:03] our Revelation he opened up the
[9:05] mysteries of God and we have a listening
[9:07] post within
[9:10] us this is not the clacking of an
[9:19] in amen we can't feed on the clacking of
[9:23] an in Jolo steam we can't feed on the
[9:25] clacking of an in t
[9:27] Jes that don't satisfy our soul amen
[9:32] hallelujah but when we listen to
[9:33] Revelation 10:7 amen when we hear the
[9:36] voice of Malachi chapter 4 our spirit
[9:39] settled down our soul is at ease amen we
[9:42] know that is God's voice sent to
[9:45] us amen amen hallelujah we are not
[9:49] trying to do away with the prophet we
[9:50] are not trying to sideline the prophet
[9:52] we are not trying to belittle the
[9:53] prophet because we know that we under
[9:55] our messenger become the final voice to
[9:58] the final age we are proud to be
[10:00] identified with William Mary and brandom
[10:02] amen he's the seven Church age
[10:04] Messengers he's one of the stars that
[10:06] Jesus held in his hand yes that's right
[10:10] amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[10:15] amen if we get to our first quote here I
[10:17] want to just read this it might be
[10:18] lengthy but I want to get this to the
[10:21] people brother brandom is saying Christ
[10:23] in the true church is a continuation of
[10:26] the book of Acts amen now continuation
[10:29] doesn't mean it'll be the
[10:31] same
[10:32] Hallelujah because what's in seed is not
[10:35] what's at the
[10:37] fruit Hallelujah yes praise the Lord
[10:41] continuation means that this bride will
[10:43] progress to a level where she'll be in
[10:45] his very own image and
[10:47] likeness where you can't tell her apart
[10:49] from the groom he says she is himen
[10:52] praise the Lord praise the Lord praise
[10:54] the Lord now remember what I said
[10:56] brother Brandon says we've got to get
[10:58] into the spirit of things so if we yet
[11:00] to have church this morning we've got to
[11:02] get into the spirit of the word amen I
[11:05] want you to know this is not a sucker
[11:06] field so you can't get into the spirit
[11:08] of playing soccer right now you can't
[11:10] get into the spirit amen of trying to
[11:12] pass messages but you got to get into
[11:14] the spirit where you're in love with the
[11:16] bridegroom and he's sending a word to
[11:18] his people whispering love secrets to
[11:21] heren he says the Book of Revelation
[11:23] shows the Antichrist spirit will come
[11:26] into the church and defile it making it
[11:28] look
[11:30] formal powerless now you know how that
[11:33] church ended there in Revelation CH 3
[11:36] ladies here ended up this way because of
[11:39] that right the Antichrist spirit that
[11:41] moved in yes amen hallelujah making them
[11:44] lukewarm formal and
[11:47] Powerless and the in another message the
[11:50] prophet says God hates a dead religion
[11:52] yeah God hates amen anything that's
[11:55] lukang that's cold and formal amen
[11:58] hallelujah and and God don't expect his
[12:00] church of Amen in this last days who's
[12:02] been highly revelated the mind of Christ
[12:05] put into the bride to sit in the church
[12:07] as a dead Catholic person amen God is
[12:10] expecting amen A Hallelujah from you God
[12:13] is expecting an amen out of
[12:15] you he says amen it takes the Holy Ghost
[12:17] within you to say Amen to the word of
[12:19] God hallelujah what we need is quicking
[12:22] power back in the church amen where
[12:24] people are not afraid to get drunk with
[12:26] the Holy Spirit where people are not
[12:28] afraid to raise their hands people are
[12:30] not afraid to say praise the Lord people
[12:32] are not afraid to shout amen people are
[12:34] not afraid to get lost in his presence

[14:23] do the Greater Works and somebody said

[19:31] sermon without
[19:34] preparation in this
[19:36] day you can get a quote you can get a
[19:40] verse and come and preach it to the
[19:43] people the people amen are happy because

[19:52] anything they H to their life when they
[19:55] go through a problem they don't know how
[19:56] to have overcoming power they don't know
[19:59] any such thing as they being Holy Ghost
[20:02] have you received the Holy Ghost since

[20:10] God I thought the Holy Ghost was for the
[20:13] disciples only brother since Brandon

[20:19] God well we supposed to be a
[20:21] continuation from brother

[20:26] supposed to be a continuation from
[20:28] Brother br
[20:29] yes if that's what we claim to be
[20:31] Revelation 108
[20:32] to1 how
[20:34] come the power of God moved through

[20:38] was called The Wave Chief showing you
[20:40] that many others would follow amen but I
[20:44] don't see the others following I see I
[20:46] call that a missed
[20:48] opportunity sir I call that a missed
[20:51] opportunity brother Brandon calls it a
[20:53] missed
[20:54] opportunity amen like the 12 Spies when
[20:56] there he says they missed the
[20:58] opportunity to get into the
[21:00] land because they listen Amen to the to
[21:03] the lies and the fear of these 10
[21:07] spies

[24:21] brings a persecution upon the flesh amen
[24:24] some of you feel that's the worst
[24:25] persecution you rather go to the three
[24:27] and a half years persecution than to

[25:09] amen if they get a true revelation of
[25:11] the two Spirits within the framework of
[25:14] the Christian
[25:15] Church there are two spirits in the
[25:18] framework of the Christian
[25:19] Church brother Bram is saying it's
[25:21] important for you to get a revelation of
[25:23] it the quote is still continuing if I
[25:26] had to ask you can you recognize the two
[25:28] spirits in the framework of the
[25:29] Christian
[25:31] Church you must know that
[25:33] Revelation amen because the quote
[25:35] continues
[25:37] now amen there was two Spirits from the
[25:41] beginning can and Abel yes amen Jacob
[25:45] and Esau Hallelujah two Spirits coming
[25:49] there in in Matthew
[25:52] 25 five wise five foolish two
[25:56] Spirits amen
[25:58] the one Spirit finally had to recognize
[26:00] that the other Spirit had something they
[26:02] didn't
[26:04] have the thing that they had was making
[26:06] them the word made flesh so they said
[26:09] give us some of that how come you are
[26:12] becoming word made flesh how come what
[26:14] you have is making you more like Christ
[26:18] I want some of
[26:20] that praise the Lord let me ask you
[26:24] this did you receiving the message of
[26:27] the hour and amen under the leadership
[26:30] of the Holy Spirit and conforming to the
[26:32] word and transforming was it an easy
[26:37] process you had to forsake a lot you are
[26:41] to forsake all others and cleave only to
[26:43] him amen yes that is why she tells them
[26:49] I can't give it to you this came with a
[26:51] price amen amen the condition you find
[26:54] me in the word made flesh didn't come
[26:57] easy
[26:59] this was a process I had to come to
[27:02] justification sanctification baptism of
[27:05] the Holy Ghost into the formed word
[27:07] image you think it's just easy for me to
[27:10] now that you see the final product you
[27:12] just want
[27:13] that you have got to go through the same
[27:16] process so go to them that are
[27:18] sing so they have to go back and look
[27:20] for the prophet's
[27:22] message because there's no way by one
[27:25] Spirit we are all baptized into the body
[27:27] you can't bypass any
[27:29] processes amen you can't bypass
[27:34] protocols so can we deser the two
[27:36] Spirits within the framework of the
[27:38] Christian Church By God's spirit discern
[27:41] and withstand the Antichrist Spirit

[28:23] finally see
[28:25] Satan he says people wonder how did we
[28:28] ever get deceived by this little puny
[28:31] fellow because the Bible says he

[30:46] Lord
[30:47] amen looks like today we'll only be able
[30:50] to read one
[30:51] quote
[30:54] amen we'll have to finish it off at the
[30:56] next service
[30:59] amen he says Satan will be powerless
[31:02] before he will be as differ tarted today
[31:05] as when Christ withstood his every
[31:08] effort to gain power over him in the
[31:11] desert Satan hates Revelation now I want
[31:15] you to know Satan wanted Jesus to take
[31:16] his life he put him up on the temple he
[31:22] says jump
[31:24] down Satan that's his tactics
[31:29] he tell you you're not worth it you're
[31:31] not good for nothing he'll send his
[31:34] angels charge over
[31:36] here Jesus said You shall not tempt the
[31:39] Lord your
[31:40] God what did Jesus knew he knew who he
[31:44] was praise the
[31:48] Lord Satan hates Revelation but we love
[31:51] it how many if you love Revelation I am
[31:53] saying amen I going not get to amen
[31:55] we've only got a few more minutes left
[31:57] but through revelation
[31:58] you obtain the promise and defeat
[32:00] Satan's kingdom or maybe I'm ahead of
[32:03] time here because of the testimonies
[32:05] that happened praise the
[32:08] Lord Satan hates Revelation but we love
[32:12] it yes amen I need to hear the Church of
[32:14] God say we love
[32:16] Revelation
[32:18] yes with true Revelation in our lives
[32:21] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[32:24] it amen amen so no matter what Satan
[32:26] prays against you Satan's kingdom cannot
[32:29] Prevail against
[32:30] you amen this is a highly revelated
[32:33] bride amen and remember faith is a
[32:35] revelation so she's moving in perfect
[32:37] Faith Right
[32:42] Now Praise the Lord you will recall that
[32:45] I mentioned at the beginning of this
[32:46] message that this book we are studying
[32:49] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[32:51] himself in the church and his work in
[32:53] future ages I mentioned it takes the
[32:56] Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we
[32:59] will fail to get
[33:02] it so if you believe the message of the
[33:04] Lord the message of the hour it was the
[33:07] Holy Spirit leading you he says without
[33:09] the Holy Spirit you'll fail to get
[33:13] it so don't ever doubt whether you are
[33:16] being led by the Holy
[33:18] Ghost the Holy Ghost LED you to the
[33:20] message thank you Lord you can't believe
[33:22] this message with
[33:24] intellect correct
[33:28] amen so if anyone ask you did you ever
[33:31] have an encounter with the Holy Spirit
[33:33] yes look where I am right
[33:36] now I believe the message of the hour I
[33:39] believe God sent a prophet my heart is
[33:42] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[33:44] amen amen look at my
[33:47] Revelation amen look at me the word made
[33:50] flesh right now I know who I am Christ
[33:54] is being revealed through
[33:56] me I didn't end up here amen by any
[34:00] other human
[34:01] leadership but the Holy Ghost led me
[34:04] amen praise the
[34:06] Lord amen I probably will just climb to
[34:09] tell you exactly who the Holy Ghost is
[34:12] amen and in what form he is Right Now
[34:15] Praise the
[34:16] Lord amen amen amen glory be to his
[34:21] name he says bringing these two thoughts
[34:24] together you'll see it won't just take a
[34:27] Ord AR study and thinking to make this
[34:30] book real so no matter how many quotes
[34:33] you can line up and try to show the
[34:35] people this ties in with this and this
[34:38] types this he says it won't make it real
[34:42] it takes the operation of the Holy
[34:45] ghosten amen hallelujah get into the
[34:48] presence of the Holy Ghost one time amen
[34:50] the whole book will be open wide before
[34:52] your wondering eyes amen light upon
[34:55] light a mighty illumination of
[34:56] Revelation will come upon you and the
[34:59] whole book of Revelation amen from the
[35:01] church ages to the seals from the seals
[35:03] to the trumpets from the trumpets to the
[35:05] vs amen amen yes hallelujah thank you
[35:10] Jesus
[35:11] Hallelujah so it can't take a study like
[35:15] a student he's saying showing you that
[35:17] this is piecing with that this means a
[35:19] book can't be revealed to anyone but a
[35:22] special class of people amen amen the
[35:26] prophet of of God is saying
[35:28] is revealed to a special class of people
[35:31] and I'm talking to a special class of
[35:33] people this is not an Earthly class this
[35:36] is an Heavenly class amen you are not

[36:46] rid of the nuts your whole thing will
[36:49] come
[36:50] apart amen amen so call me a n for
[36:54] Christ amen hallelujah call me a nut for
[36:59] Christ and the thing is we are not loose
[37:05] nuts we are not loose nuts we have been
[37:09] tightened by the Holy Ghost because he
[37:11] says remember that cart needs to be
[37:13] packed tightly and sealed by the Holy
[37:16] Ghost so we are not ordinary nuts we are
[37:19] tightened
[37:20] [Music]
[37:22] nuts amen you need the nuts to keep this

[37:35] boat amen praise the Lord where are we
[37:40] requires amen special class of people it
[37:43] will take one with prophetic Insight
[37:45] we've had him it would amen and we are
[37:48] part of that prophetic class it require
[37:50] the ability to hear from
[37:53] God you know in order to hear you need
[37:55] to shut up yes
[37:59] shut in with God in the secret
[38:04] place there in his presence beholding
[38:08] his face gaining the
[38:11] power to run in the R I love to be shut
[38:15] in with God am we think when we shut in
[38:18] with God Lord oh Lord I need this I need

[38:24] this father if you only give me this
[38:26] Lord sh
[38:34] amen he says sometimes we so much in a
[38:37] hurry to get out of the prayer room we
[38:40] don't give him time to
[38:43] speak speak back to
[38:46] us
[38:52] amen it requires Supernatural
[38:57] oh this is something now that's
[39:00] foreign foreign
[39:04] Supernatural it requires
[39:08] Supernatural instruction not just
[39:10] student comparing verse with verse
[39:12] though that is good but a mystery
[39:13] requires the teaching of the spirit
[39:15] where it never becomes clear how we need
[39:17] to hear from God and lay ourselves and
[39:19] open and become healed to the spirit and
[39:22] year and know as I already said This
[39:25] Book of Revelation is a consummation of
[39:27] scriptures it's even placed exactly
[39:29] right in the cannon of scripture at the
[39:31] End Amen praise the Lord I need to stop
[39:35] reading this quot other words will never
[39:36] end
[39:37] here
[39:42] amen towards the end of that quote he
[39:44] says the revelation of God for each age
[39:47] can come in that age
[39:49] only so I'm saying the revelation of the
[39:52] Bride being the manifested word could
[39:54] only come in this day it couldn't come
[39:56] in Luther couldn't be the manifested the
[39:59] full manifested word for his day he only
[40:01] had one part it's only in this time and
[40:04] season that the full manifestation of
[40:06] the word is on the
[40:10] earth praise the
[40:12] Lord he says we learned this principle
[40:15] immediately revelation of God for each
[40:18] age can come in that age only at a
[40:21] specific time amen the revelation of God
[40:24] to Moses can only come at a specific
[40:26] time of History
[40:27] his as the people cried to God Jesus
[40:31] himself came at the fullness of time he
[40:33] be he being the full revelation of the
[40:35] godhead and this age the revelation of
[40:39] God will come in its due time it will
[40:41] not falter neither will it be premature
[40:43] think on this and eat it well for we are
[40:46] in the end time today amen amen than you
[40:50] Lord so if you're wondering what time we
[40:51] in the prophet is saying he's manifested
[40:53] now in the dispensation of the Holy
[40:55] Ghost I'm going to Define what the Holy
[40:57] Ghost is here very quickly see what the
[40:59] prophet is saying we are not living in
[41:01] the Christian dispensation but in the
[41:03] Holy Ghost
[41:05] dispensation it's the acts of the holy
[41:07] spirit in the church marvelous day we're
[41:09] living in greatest time of all ages
[41:12] we're now living just at the closing of
[41:15] sin this world's activities and fixing
[41:18] to enter into that great age that we've
[41:21] looked for so long the Hebrew prophets
[41:24] had spoke through the day am that's in
[41:26] my angel shall go before thee now in the
[41:30] next paragraph there he going to define
[41:32] the angel he says and that Pillar of
[41:34] Fire or the angel praise the Lord
[41:38] somebody say praise the Lord
[41:43] amen he says so this Pillar of Fire
[41:46] that's over the prophets
[41:48] said amen amen or the
[41:54] angel was the angel of the Covenant
[41:57] everybody get this now I believe all
[41:59] ministers will agree with that that that
[42:02] was the angel of the
[42:03] Covenant if it was the angel of the
[42:06] Covenant then it was
[42:09] the who was
[42:11] it Lord
[42:15] Jesus it was God the
[42:20] who amen
[42:22] thank so who is the angel of
[42:25] God the holy SP spirit in the form of
[42:28] angel of God praise the Lord
[42:32] amen it was the angel of the Covenant
[42:36] then it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was
[42:38] God the holy spirit that was Christ the
[42:41] logos the angel of the Covenant that led
[42:43] the children of Israel out of Egypt to
[42:45] the promised land which was just the
[42:48] foreshadow as he did in the natural then
[42:51] it does in the spiritual today
[42:53] amen amen praise the Lord amen
[42:58] what did he do in the natural day he
[43:00] supplied all their needs their clothes
[43:02] didn't we out in the wilderness he
[43:04] provided food for them he provided
[43:06] clothing for them and my God says in
[43:08] this Third Exodus my God shall supply
[43:10] all your needs according to his witches
[43:12] and glory amen they needed water from
[43:15] The Rock he provided for them they
[43:17] needed food he provided angel food for
[43:19] them whatever they needed amen
[43:22] hallelujah he gave it to them amen thank
[43:25] you Lord and he's our present help in
[43:26] the time of trouble he said in mark
[43:28] 11:24 whatever you ask when you pray
[43:31] believe that you have already received
[43:33] it praise the Lord now just to close on
[43:37] this
[43:39] point the greatest the strongest weapon
[43:42] that they is in all the world that's
[43:45] prayer prayer is what changes things the
[43:48] Christian doesn't realize what a force
[43:50] he has when he kneels on his knees
[43:52] before almighty God In The Name of Jesus
[43:54] Christ I'm getting into the part now you
[43:57] defeat Satan's kingdom yes
[44:01] Amen in order to defeat him on your feet
[44:05] you've got to defeat him on your
[44:08] knees prayer is what changes things the
[44:11] Christian doesn't realize what a force
[44:13] he has when he kneels on his knees
[44:15] before almighty God In The Name of Jesus
[44:18] Christ he doesn't realize what power
[44:20] that
[44:21] is if the people could only realize
[44:25] that what is given unto them anything
[44:28] you ask for will be given if you can
[44:30] appropriate the faith to believe
[44:33] it for God's word is
[44:35] true so what we've got to do to get it
[44:38] back into the program of God and find
[44:40] out after all what God wants us to do
[44:43] and the only way I know to do is it is
[44:47] prayer prayer is the key that's the
[44:50] answer if you want to go somewhere you
[44:52] need a key to start your
[44:55] car if you want to access the kingdom
[44:57] well of prayer is the
[45:00] key what is prayer prayer is
[45:05] petitioning prayer means to
[45:08] petition
[45:10] okay he doesn't realize amen so yeah he
[45:12] saying prayer is the key Prayer Changes
[45:15] Things prayer is the most powerful
[45:16] weapon that was ever put in control of
[45:19] human beings there's no atomic bomb
[45:21] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[45:23] prayer will change the mind of God
[45:28] so in a kingdom you can't access the
[45:32] king the only way you can access the
[45:35] king is to petition the king now
[45:38] remember this is not a democracy in the
[45:39] kingdom of God this is a kingdom realm
[45:43] so you've got to
[45:44] petition how do you petition according
[45:47] to what's in the word yes amen you can
[45:50] only make a petition based on the king's
[45:53] law King you said in decree certain
[45:56] certain
[45:57] me that this will happen if I come
[46:00] before you that's how you petition but
[46:03] if we don't know what's in the decree if
[46:06] we don't know what's in the word how do
[46:08] we petition the
[46:10] Lord amen so whatever the king commands
[46:14] becomes law and you can petition the
[46:16] king according to the king's word so
[46:18] prayer is how we petition the king now a
[46:22] prayerless life is telling
[46:25] God Amen
[46:27] you know what a prayerless life is
[46:28] telling
[46:32] God I have
[46:35] pride to live a prayerless life is to
[46:38] live a life of
[46:41] Pride to live a prayerless life is to
[46:43] tell God I am
[46:47] self-sufficient to live a prayerless
[46:49] life is to live in
[46:51] arrogance to live a prayerless life he's
[46:54] saying I don't need God
[46:57] you don't need to contact an high realm
[47:00] I am
[47:01] self-sufficient that's the lat in spirit
[47:03] I have need of Nothing in Your Kingdom
[47:06] look how rich I
[47:08] am praise the
[47:11] Lord so I am saying reexamine our prayer
[47:15] life amen reexamine our prayer
[47:19] life reexamine our love for the word

[48:44] way must Jesus bear the cross alone and
[48:47] all the world go free there's a cross
[48:50] for you and there's a cross for me the
[48:53] way to eternal life the way to enhabit
[48:56] the kingdom of God you must follow the
[48:58] same
