[4:01] Life is easy
[4:05] when you're up on the mountain.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; You've got peace of mind
[4:14] like you haven't known.
[4:19] But things change
[4:23] and you're down in the valley.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But don't lose faith.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For you're never alone.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; For the God of the mountain,
[4:40] he's the God in the valley.
[4:45] When things go wrong,
[4:50] he'll make them right.
[4:54] for the God of the good times.
[4:58] He's the God in the bad times.
[5:03] The God of the day,
[5:07] he's the God in the night
[5:12] of
[5:14] [Music]
[5:17] the mountain.
[5:20] Talk come so easy.
[5:24] When you face what you see down in the
[5:30] valley,
[5:32] [Music]
[5:36] &gt;&gt; that's when your revelation
[5:38] &gt;&gt; that's when your face
[5:40] &gt;&gt; is ready.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; It's ready put to the test.
[5:46] The God on the mountain,
[5:50] he's your God in the valley.
[5:54] When things go wrong,
[5:59] he'll make them right.

[6:40] &gt;&gt; He's the God. He's the God in the time,
[6:46] the God of the day.
[6:50] He's the God in the night.
[6:54] From verse three says, "Blessed be the
[6:57] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[7:00] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[7:03] blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
[7:07] Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; So, in order to access heavenly bless uh
[7:11] heavenly these blessings, we got to be
[7:13] in heavenly places.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; In Christ,
[7:16] &gt;&gt; according as he had chosen us in him
[7:19] before the foundation of the world, that
[7:21] we should be holy and without blame
[7:23] before him in love.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the
[7:27] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[7:30] himself according to the good pleasure
[7:32] of his will.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Father, Lord, we love
[7:36] you this morning. We thank you, Lord,
[7:38] that we can be found in your most holy
[7:39] presence, oh God. Father, we can lay
[7:42] aside this time, oh God, to come and
[7:44] Lord, the day after the Sabbath, oh God,
[7:46] to come, Lord, the waving of that wave
[7:48] sheep, oh God. We thank you, Lord, that
[7:51] this is the holy convocation, Father.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, we come to honor your
[7:54] resurrection, Lord Jesus. And I pray,
[7:56] Lord, for your blessings upon us this
[7:58] morning as we come around the revealed
[8:00] word of the hour. We have nothing else
[8:02] to feed on besides your revealed word.
[8:04] Oh God, we haven't come here, Lord, for
[8:05] social gathering. We haven't come here,
[8:07] Lord, to meet one another. But we have
[8:09] come to meet with the King of Kings and
[8:10] the Lord of Lords. God, I pray will
[8:12] focus our hearts and our minds and our
[8:14] attention now. And Lord, I pray
[8:16] Revelation will be in attendance. Your
[8:17] great Holy Spirit will open up the eyes
[8:19] of our understanding and break the bread
[8:21] of life to our hungry souls. We ask your
[8:23] blessings now and we ask your blessings
[8:24] over the hearer of the word, the speaker
[8:26] of the word. And I pray your Holy Ghost
[8:28] will anoint both of us now in the mighty
[8:30] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[8:32] with much thanksgiving.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn to your neighbor and ask me
[8:35] if they're ready for the word.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Now I haven't come this morning to
[8:40] preach a wishy-washy sermon.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; We come because of the revelation of the
[8:46] word.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says that teaching
[8:50] places you positionally to know who you
[8:52] are. And he says, "Unless we know who we
[8:54] are, we can never truly have faith,
[8:56] &gt;&gt; perfect faith."
[8:57] &gt;&gt; If you want mustard seed faith, plenty
[8:59] of churches preaching mustard seed
[9:00] faith.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; But we are looking for perfect faith.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; I spoke to you the last time I told you,
[9:11] take a mustard seed in your hand. See if
[9:13] you can hold that faith for too long.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; See how long you can hold on to a
[9:17] mustard seed. Because Jesus is saying if
[9:19] you had the faith, the grain of a
[9:20] mustard seed. So see how long you can
[9:23] hold the grain of a mustard seed in your
[9:24] hand without you losing it and then see
[9:28] how long you'll be able to sustain that
[9:30] kind of faith.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; So we come now in the message of the
[9:34] hour. We come with the opening of the
[9:35] word that seventh seal open to us.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; So then we must be able to stomach the
[9:41] revelation of the word.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I say this again, we we don't
[9:49] have too much of time for the rapture,
[9:51] &gt;&gt; the changing of our bodies. That's
[9:52] &gt;&gt; right.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; So now is the time we must feed on the
[9:55] word,
[9:56] &gt;&gt; equip ourselves with the word so we can
[9:57] get ready for that body change
[9:59] &gt;&gt; because that's what the word has come to
[10:01] do. So if we're looking at our
[10:02] scripture,
[10:04] Amen, just to confirm, you got the
[10:06] notes. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[10:12] You know this year when we enter the new
[10:14] year the Lord gave us inspiration the
[10:16] opening up of dimensional doors.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord
[10:20] &gt;&gt; and we come to see the further unfolding
[10:23] of that revelation through the months of
[10:25] preaching
[10:26] the Holy Spirit making it more clear.
[10:30] You know we had been looking at Matthew
[10:31] 25.
[10:33] I'm sure all of you were in these
[10:34] services. Matthew 25 and we found if you
[10:37] put up 25:10 there, you'll see a door
[10:39] was open to marriage.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; You remember the wise and foolish
[10:44] virgins.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; You'll see there a door was open to them
[10:50] and they were pulled into the marriage.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So there's two classes
[10:54] of people on the earth right now. The
[10:56] wise and the foolish.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; But the wise are not just virgins
[11:00] anymore. The wise are the married wife
[11:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ reproducing his
[11:05] life.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; So the the ones that went in are married
[11:11] to Christ and they are taking the seed
[11:13] word eaten the book reproducing the life
[11:16] of Jesus Christ matching the ministry to
[11:18] welcome back the headstone Christ and
[11:21] thereby fulfilling the scripture that we
[11:23] just read. We are predestinated to
[11:24] adoption.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; So this can only happen in the bride
[11:28] age. It can't happen in the Leosian age.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been through this now that
[11:33] it's the bride age. It's not the Leosian
[11:35] church age. So, we're going to look at
[11:37] three things here. The prophet is
[11:38] speaking about about the mystery of his
[11:40] will, the mystery of his coming, and the
[11:43] mystery of sitting together in heavenly
[11:44] places.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; And see how the the Holy Spirit was
[11:48] speaking to the prophet and tying these
[11:51] things together.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So if we get to
[11:56] our first quote there just to lay this
[11:58] at the foundational quote,
[12:00] brother Brandham now is going to be
[12:04] talking about Ephesians chapter 1:3. I'm
[12:07] going to read it again. Blessed be the
[12:09] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:11] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[12:13] blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Now we mustn't read too quickly over
[12:19] that because the prophet is now going to
[12:21] break it down for us,
[12:22] &gt;&gt; right? How do we get into heavenly
[12:24] places? How do we get in Christ? And
[12:27] then there's a two-part getting into
[12:30] Christ. Right? So that's what we're
[12:31] going to be looking at this morning.
[12:34] Now remember this adoption that we are
[12:36] looking at is not like you can't have
[12:38] children and we adopting a child.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; In this adoption, the husband and wife
[12:44] come together,
[12:47] they have a child,
[12:49] &gt;&gt; but the child goes through tutors and
[12:50] governors.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. through a training period. And
[12:54] when the child comes to maturity, the
[12:56] father then adopts the son.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; And that adoption means the all
[13:00] authority that the father had is now
[13:02] given to you.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because we can't
[13:07] talk about the power of the spoken word
[13:09] and and operating these things if
[13:11] authority is not given to us.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's read. He made known unto
[13:17] us the mystery.
[13:20] He says get the Holy Spirit on you
[13:22] sometime and start running that then
[13:25] just watch how it goes this afternoon
[13:28] about 30 minutes to study just look at
[13:30] the lesson or maybe not I'll say about
[13:32] half of that 15 minutes between the
[13:34] times so the prophet is saying the Holy
[13:36] Spirit can take 15 minutes to reveal
[13:38] something to you
[13:40] &gt;&gt; all he needed was 15 minutes and I got
[13:42] to running and I thought the mystery how
[13:44] mysterious and the scripture pulled me
[13:46] back into the Old Testament and then
[13:49] back over into the New Testament and
[13:51] tied something together.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Now, when you tie something together,
[13:56] they become
[13:57] &gt;&gt; one.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everyone paying attention,
[14:01] everyone getting the thought.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; He's tying the whole Who's tying this,
[14:06] brother Brandham? No. Who is he saying
[14:07] tying it?
[14:08] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; He's tying these three things together.
[14:12] The mystery of his coming.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; The mystery of his will.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; The mystery of us sitting together.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Now you know we've been dealing with
[14:24] that of us sitting together in heavenly
[14:25] places in that great headstone.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; How we are the church that is coming now
[14:30] to meet the headstone. Now if you don't
[14:32] get this mystery, you're going to miss a
[14:33] big chunk of the message. So pay
[14:35] attention. So the prophet is saying the
[14:37] Holy Spirit is tying the mystery of his
[14:39] coming.
[14:41] the mystery of his will and the mystery
[14:44] of us sitting together.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, if we touch on the
[14:49] first one, the mystery of his coming. If
[14:51] we are sitting with a denominational
[14:53] concept this morning about the coming of
[14:55] the Lord.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; That one day the sky is going to split
[14:58] open.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Are we going to see the Lord in the air?
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Then you miss your message.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Because the coming of the Lord started
[15:07] with a shout.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't believe the seventh
[15:16] seal is open, you are going to say, "I
[15:18] don't believe that."
[15:20] Right? But the seventh seal is open.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We've been through that
[15:28] through months. And you know, the
[15:29] prophet says that the the mighty angel
[15:32] himself, Christ himself, open that
[15:34] seventh seal.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; So, the mystery of his coming
[15:40] We know that he's telling us that these
[15:42] three are tied together. They go hand in
[15:44] hand, tied together. So they are one.
[15:47] Now the mystery of his coming, I would
[15:49] say, has been revealed to us. The
[15:52] apostle Paul, if you put up 1
[15:53] Corinthians chapter 4 there, verse 16,
[15:55] somewhere around there, you'll see he is
[15:58] just telling us about a shout, a voice,
[16:00] and a trump
[16:03] &gt;&gt; talking about the coming of first,
[16:05] sorry, first Thessalonians,
[16:07] talking about the coming of the Lord.
[16:09] Yes.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; He doesn't detail the shout.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; He doesn't detail the voice.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; He doesn't detail the trump of God. All
[16:17] he says, the Lord himself shall descend
[16:19] from heaven with a shout
[16:21] &gt;&gt; with the voice of the archangel. And
[16:23] with the trump of God, the dead in
[16:25] Christ shall rise first.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; It takes a prophet now in the rapture
[16:29] message just before he leaves to talk
[16:31] about the shout.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we are looking at what the
[16:38] prophet is saying about the shout, I I'm
[16:40] I'm laying this again. We've been
[16:42] through it before, but I want you to get
[16:43] it. Now let's let's first deal with the
[16:47] fact that Revelation 10 is the seventh
[16:49] seal.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Because if we believe this is a
[16:56] fulfillment of Revelation 10,
[16:58] &gt;&gt; which means the seventh seal was open to
[17:00] us.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not seeing anybody everybody saying
[17:06] amen this morning.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; But let's get through it. Maybe by the
[17:09] end of the service you're going to be
[17:11] agreeing with me.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Right. So let's see how the prophet is
[17:16] talking about and I'm going to ask you
[17:19] to change. If you are listening to
[17:21] internet preachers, you are going to be
[17:23] confused.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; I am not here to sort out your questions
[17:28] about you listening to internet
[17:29] preachers and what they are saying.
[17:30] Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; If you're part of this assembly and
[17:33] you're part of this ministry, you've got
[17:34] to listen to what the pastor is saying
[17:36] because the pastor is an angel to the
[17:37] church.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So why I'm saying this?
[17:41] People are preaching what? Not what
[17:42] brother Brandham said, but what they
[17:44] think he meant.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Yes, sir.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. You don't believe me? Let's go and
[17:54] sort out one teaching that's going
[17:56] around. Let's go to Revelation chapter
[17:58] 3.
[18:00] or maybe sorry revelation chapter 6
[18:04] &gt;&gt; sorry brother Josh I got to do this
[18:06] &gt;&gt; amen because spirit wants to make things
[18:08] clear
[18:09] &gt;&gt; but I want to background quickly and
[18:10] then we can move on right
[18:12] &gt;&gt; he says and I saw when the lamb opened
[18:14] one of those one of the seals and I
[18:16] heard as it was a noise of thunder now
[18:18] people are taking that and saying see he
[18:20] doesn't say he opened the first seal he
[18:21] opened one of the seals
[18:23] &gt;&gt; right you heard that preaching
[18:26] &gt;&gt; so which means let's read and when he
[18:28] had opened one of the seals
[18:30] I heard noise of the thunder, one of the
[18:32] beast saying, "Come and see." And I saw
[18:33] behold a white horse. So according to
[18:36] their teaching, the seventh seal is
[18:37] revealing a white horse.
[18:41] Is everybody reading this?
[18:43] &gt;&gt; So how can the seventh seal be open
[18:44] first?
[18:45] &gt;&gt; When he is saying
[18:49] the first seal is the white horse rider,
[18:51] then let's go to Revelation chapter. If
[18:52] that is the first seal or if that is the
[18:55] seventh seal, then what about Revelation
[18:56] 81?
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Revelation 81. you put there when he had
[19:00] opened the seventh seal. So which means
[19:01] the seventh seal going to open twice.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:11] So Revelation 6:1, he is opening the
[19:13] first seal.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; He is opening the first seal. Who is
[19:20] opening it is what people are getting.
[19:23] The one opening it is Christ.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. He is that seventh seal.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; So now having sorted that prophet is
[19:34] going to talk about the seventh seal.
[19:36] Now
[19:37] &gt;&gt; he says the seven and last one of these
[19:39] seals. So what's the last one of these
[19:42] seals? Somebody say seven seals.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; When they open it's found in Revelation
[19:47] the 10th chapter.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Where is the seventh seal found?
[19:53] &gt;&gt; In the 10th chapter of Revelation.
[19:56] Praise the Lord. What is that seventh
[19:58] seal? It's the coming of the Lord.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the coming of the
[20:04] Lord.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Didn't brother Brandham says the seventh
[20:06] seal brings him back to the earth.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; And how does it start? Starts with a
[20:12] shout.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; It starts with a shout. What is the
[20:16] shout?
[20:17] &gt;&gt; It's a message. So he says the seven and
[20:20] last one of these seals when they are
[20:22] open is found in Revelation the 10th
[20:25] chapter
[20:27] there was a mighty angel which was
[20:28] Christ came down put one foot on the
[20:30] land and on the sea raised up his hand
[20:33] the day is finished time is run out it's
[20:35] all over time shall be no more
[20:38] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord I want to get to 206
[20:40] said just to confirm what the prophet is
[20:42] saying the last one of them is
[20:44] revelation 10
[20:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[20:46] &gt;&gt; so the seventh seal is revelation
[20:49] Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel coming down
[20:52] &gt;&gt; with a shout.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:06] Now watch what brother Brandham says
[21:08] here next.
[21:10] Right? He says, "But when these seven
[21:13] thunders," now remember the thunders are
[21:14] found in Revelation 10. But when these
[21:16] sign is over in Revelation 10, he said,
[21:18] "Don't write them at all.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; They are mysteries. We don't know what
[21:22] they are yet, but in my opinion, they'll
[21:24] be revealed right away."
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; So, they are revealed right away.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; And when it do, it'll give us faith for
[21:33] that rapturing grace.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; For the church to move out
[21:37] &gt;&gt; out where? Out here.
[21:41] If you don't come into heavenly places
[21:44] and join with the headstone, you got to
[21:46] join in here first
[21:48] &gt;&gt; before you can take a rapture.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; He called you out of Leosia to come here
[21:52] and unite with him, then take you in the
[21:54] rapture. Praise the Lord. You see, we've
[21:58] just moved out through everything we
[22:00] know through all dispensation. We've
[22:03] watched everything.
[22:05] We've seen mysteries of God. We've seen
[22:07] the appearing of the great gathering
[22:08] together of the bride in the last days.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Gathering together. What are you talking
[22:14] about?
[22:15] &gt;&gt; The gathering together of the bride.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Let's see what he's talking about. He
[22:21] says like it seal broken in the word of
[22:24] God reveals to the man of the age. What
[22:26] age we living in?
[22:28] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the age, the church of the
[22:30] age. Revelation 10 at the end we find
[22:34] when the last seal was broke. Amen.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; We find the angel standing with one foot
[22:40] on the land, other on the sea with his
[22:42] hands up to heaven, rainbow over his
[22:44] head, swearing by him that lives forever
[22:47] that time has run out when that last
[22:49] seal and you wait till we get into them
[22:51] seals and see where that seal is at. So,
[22:54] have these quotes established that
[22:56] Revelation 10 is the seventh seal?
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; So, me saying it is the prophet.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. So this is coming
[23:06] together.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; This is the headstone.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Christ coming back.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; With a message. Now let's just move the
[23:14] thought quickly.
[23:16] So we are saying the shout. Let's detail
[23:19] the shout. The first thing comes when he
[23:21] starts descending from heaven. There's a
[23:22] shout.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Right. What is it? Is a message.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; To get the people together. So, you see
[23:31] what's getting us together into heavenly
[23:33] places.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Pay attention now because if you're
[23:36] agreeing with me on this port, you got
[23:37] to agree with me on the next port.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Brother Adrian's reading
[23:44] ports
[23:46] of the prophet."
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; I see. I'm a good fisherman.
[23:52] So, I'm fishing now and reeling you in
[23:55] the show. You know about fishing. Some
[23:56] of you brothers know about fishing. So,
[23:58] I'm throwing a bait out to you. What is
[24:00] he saying the message is?
[24:03] What is the shout? A message to gather
[24:05] people together,
[24:09] &gt;&gt; right? A message comes forth first.
[24:14] Shout a messenger getting the people
[24:16] ready, getting the bride together.
[24:19] The first thing comes forth is his
[24:21] message.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; So, we all established that it's the
[24:27] message, the shout that gets the bride
[24:29] together.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "Amen."
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Let's read the next one. And then
[24:35] there's coming forth seven mysterious
[24:37] thunders that's not even written at all.
[24:39] That's right. And I believe that through
[24:41] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[24:43] the last days in order to get the bride
[24:45] together for rapturing faith.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:52] So one is saying the shout the message
[24:54] is going to get us ready.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; This part is saying the seven thunders
[24:58] are going to gather us.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; So is it the same thing?
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[25:07] Everybody is agreeing that the short
[25:09] message and the seven thunders is the
[25:12] same message.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Now you remember he says the messenger
[25:16] of Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 will do
[25:18] two things.
[25:20] Praise the Lord.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Why am I saying this? Some people don't
[25:23] believe that the seven thunders are to
[25:24] their voices.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; But here what the prophet is saying, the
[25:27] seven thunders will gather the bride.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; We just read quotes in the rapture
[25:31] message where he's saying the sharp
[25:32] message is gathering the bride.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; So you know and now remember I can't
[25:38] give you revelation.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; I can preach to you something.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; I can preach you my revelation. What the
[25:46] prophet is saying.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; This is not my revelation. I'm preaching
[25:49] to you, but you've got to ask the Holy
[25:51] Spirit to give you revelation to quicken
[25:53] that word.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll just be repeating what
[25:58] I am repeating.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; But you're going to be able to say,
[26:01] "Lord,
[26:03] &gt;&gt; how come I missed this?" Now,
[26:05] &gt;&gt; he's saying the shout message is to get
[26:07] the people together.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; And here he's saying the seven thunders
[26:10] will get the people together.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Remember, he says the seven thunders are
[26:14] contained in the seals.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; So, what is going to get us up here into
[26:23] heavenly places?
[26:24] &gt;&gt; We can say it's the sharp message or the
[26:27] seven thunder message.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Is going to get us up here.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; That's why I said this morning, we
[26:33] haven't come here to preach a wishywashy
[26:34] sermon. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; We come here to give you rapturing
[26:38] faith.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; So, how do we get into heavenly places?
[26:41] Because remember, we are looking at
[26:42] three things. The mystery of his coming.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. the mystery of his will
[26:47] &gt;&gt; and the mystery of us sitting together
[26:49] in heavenly places.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit tied these
[26:53] three things together to say they are
[26:55] one thing.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:01] So if we are saying that
[27:04] we've all established now what is the
[27:06] mystery of his coming? Denominations
[27:08] don't know this.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; The mystery of his coming is that he has
[27:12] descended with a shout. Yes.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Right. And when he has descended with a
[27:20] shout, seven thunders are to their
[27:22] voices.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:30] Just want to see if we're all on the
[27:32] same page here.
[27:40] So he says remember it cannot be taught
[27:43] in any seminary.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. You cannot know it by
[27:48] education.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; By theology.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that's been hidden since
[27:53] the foundation of the world waiting for
[27:56] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; You mean this great mystery
[28:04] &gt;&gt; has been waiting for us?
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; The mystery of his coming, the mystery
[28:10] of his will, the mystery of us sitting
[28:12] together in heavenly places is depending
[28:14] on the manifestation of the sons of God.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his coming to
[28:21] summarize is the seventh seal, the
[28:24] Revelation 10 1 Thessalonians 4:16.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now if we are looking
[28:31] at the mystery of his will, anyone's got
[28:33] any questions on the mystery of his
[28:35] coming?
[28:36] We know he's come with a shout,
[28:38] &gt;&gt; a message. And that's why people are not
[28:41] enthused about the message because they
[28:43] don't have a revelation of what this
[28:44] message is.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; They think the message is a bunch of
[28:47] laws.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; You know, dress right, do right, act
[28:50] right.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Speak Lord.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; But this message has come to call back
[28:54] sons to adoption.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Because if he calls you and he quickens
[29:01] you, that's right. That seed gene within
[29:03] you makes you start to dress right, to
[29:05] live right, to act right.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; We don't have to force you to do these
[29:10] things.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; What the message is doing is to quicken
[29:12] that C gene within you. And Amen. Once
[29:15] that CG gene is within you, it
[29:16] recognizes who you are, your pedigree,
[29:19] and what you called for.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; So, the mystery of his will, let's look
[29:26] at that.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; If you got any questions on the mystery
[29:29] of his coming, you can speak to me.
[29:32] Let's read what the mystery of his will
[29:34] is then.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; You want to know what the mystery of his
[29:38] will is?
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will, let's see
[29:44] what the prophet is saying.
[29:46] Now let's read. All right. In the ninth
[29:49] verse. Praise the Lord.
[29:53] If you're looking at first, if you're
[29:54] looking at Ephesians, the prophet is
[29:56] going to read the ninth verse. That's
[29:57] what he's referencing. Amen. If you want
[30:00] to put it up, we'll read it first.
[30:02] Hallelujah.
[30:05] And to make not make all men see what
[30:08] the fellowship of the mystery.
[30:11] Sorry. Ephesians 1:9, not 3:9.
[30:18] Having made unto known unto us the
[30:20] mystery of his will,
[30:23] according to his good pleasure, which he
[30:25] had purposed in himself. Now before we
[30:28] read the quote the the apostle Paul is
[30:30] saying he has made known to us the
[30:32] mystery of his will.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; So let me ask you you're all saying
[30:36] amen. What is the mystery of his will?
[30:40] Sorry
[30:42] we all saying we know the apostle Paul
[30:44] is saying having made known unto us the
[30:48] mystery of his will.
[30:51] We just been through the mystery of his
[30:53] coming.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; But he's saying, "Having made known unto
[30:56] us the mystery of his will."
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor what the mystery of
[31:00] the will is.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Let's see now what the prophet is
[31:06] saying. Praise the Lord. Having made
[31:09] known to us the mystery of his will to
[31:14] adopt us.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will is adoption.
[31:18] Amen.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; But it's got to start with the coming.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Everybody seeing that?
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; This the mystery of his coming has got
[31:27] to be revealed first before the mystery
[31:29] of his will.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Because he has to come first to call his
[31:34] own sons back to him.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of his will to adopt us
[31:40] &gt;&gt; according to his good pleasure which he
[31:42] had purposed in himself.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:47] He purposed it himself before the
[31:49] foundation of the world.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, who is tying this
[31:54] together? I'm going to say again, the
[31:55] Holy Spirit is tying this together. He's
[31:57] tying the coming of the Lord, the
[31:59] mystery of his coming, and he's tying
[32:01] the mystery of his will to adopt us
[32:02] together.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Spirit is tying the seventh
[32:06] seal and the adoption mystery together.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; And he's also tying the mystery of us
[32:12] sitting together in heavenly places
[32:14] together.
[32:16] So if these two if we are just saying
[32:18] now that the mystery of his coming is
[32:20] revealed. You all agree mystery of his
[32:22] coming is revealed.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; We all agree that the mystery of his
[32:25] will which is adoption is revealed to
[32:27] us.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Then what about the mystery of sitting
[32:31] together in heavenly places?
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Adoption is also called the placing of
[32:44] sons. Yes.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Right. So, let's read what the prophet
[32:47] is saying here. Now, Wednesday is night,
[32:49] we got into the fifth verse, right?
[32:52] Prophet is referencing the Ephesians
[32:54] 1:5. Now, right, that we were called to
[32:56] adoption. He's saying unto the adoption
[32:59] or the placing of people.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; How did God trying to place his people?
[33:07] So, he's come for us with a shout, with
[33:08] a message, with the seven thunders to
[33:10] place us in our position. Yes.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's your seven thunders that
[33:15] gives us faith for rapture.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; And he says we can't have faithful
[33:18] rapture unless we know our position.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Can you see how it's being tied
[33:23] together?
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; He says, now we're going to stop just a
[33:27] second on the adoption. The fifth verse,
[33:29] trying to get down as far as we possibly
[33:31] can. Now remember the theme. It's all
[33:34] together on placing. So what is
[33:36] adoption? Placing.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; How many understands that?
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's hear you say with one word.
[33:42] So the prophet is going to ask the
[33:44] congregation to repeat and I'm going to
[33:46] ask you to repeat. Placing the body of
[33:49] Jesus Christ
[33:50] &gt;&gt; the body of Jesus Christ
[33:52] &gt;&gt; positionally
[33:53] &gt;&gt; positionally
[33:54] &gt;&gt; in Christ
[33:55] &gt;&gt; in Christ
[33:56] &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit
[33:57] &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit
[33:58] &gt;&gt; is leading us
[33:59] &gt;&gt; is leading us.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Now brothers and sisters, this is the
[34:02] prophet's definition of adoption.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:12] Amen. Yeah.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; The aspect of us getting the robe and
[34:16] the authority is one aspect of adoption.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; But the prophetic gift is telling us the
[34:21] definition of adoption is placing the
[34:23] body of Jesus Christ positionally in
[34:26] Christ. Now, have you ever thought about
[34:28] that? Re reread that.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; You're going to place the body of Jesus
[34:33] Christ in Christ.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I say don't read too
[34:40] fast.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; How are we going to place the body of
[34:45] Jesus Christ
[34:47] in Christ?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; He says the definition of adoption and
[34:55] he's asking the church to repeat it.
[34:57] He's placing the body of Jesus Christ
[35:00] positionally in Christ where the Holy
[35:03] Spirit is leading us.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; There you are. Now you got it.
[35:09] Positionally placing us and the book of
[35:12] EP Ephesus is to do that.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Notice now placing the body not an
[35:22] individual.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Because the body is made up of many
[35:26] members.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; So let's get to the first part.
[35:31] Placing the body of Jesus Christ. Now we
[35:34] all want to be part of the body of Jesus
[35:36] Christ,
[35:37] &gt;&gt; right? So we'll go to scripture. Then
[35:40] how do we get into the body?
[35:42] So before the body is placed in Christ,
[35:47] we've got to get into the body.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; So the body must be built up first. See,
[35:55] if this is Christ,
[35:58] the body must be built up first before
[36:00] we can place you in Christ.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot get into the body by
[36:06] joining. You know the prophet says this.
[36:09] You can't get into the body by
[36:10] handshake.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; You can't get into the body by
[36:12] membership.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; You have to be for ordained from before
[36:16] the foundation of the world to be in the
[36:18] body of Christ.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; No man can call you into the body.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has to call you into the
[36:25] body and baptize you into the body of
[36:27] Christ.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; So how do we get into the body of
[36:30] Christ? Here's a scripture for the Amen.
[36:32] for you. Amen. the young ones, the old
[36:34] ones, whoever is writing this down. 1
[36:35] Corinthians chapter 12. For as the body
[36:38] is one,
[36:40] and have many members, and all the
[36:43] members of that one body, being many,
[36:46] are one body, so also is Christ.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; For by one spirit,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; we are all baptized into one body. Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[37:01] we be bond or free and have been made to
[37:03] drink into one spirit.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; So, we first have to come and the Holy
[37:10] Spirit has to baptize us into the body
[37:15] &gt;&gt; before we can be placed the body can be
[37:17] placed into Christ.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that becoming more clear?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet saying adoption is
[37:25] placing the body
[37:27] into Christ.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; You're going to see how this ties up
[37:34] with the things we've been preaching.
[37:37] Praise the Lord.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; So, how do you place the body? Now, we
[37:42] we've just read how you get into the
[37:44] body,
[37:46] right? You can't come because of your
[37:48] father's revelation.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; You can't come because of your mother's
[37:51] revelation.
[37:53] The Holy Spirit has to quicken it to you
[37:55] and fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[37:57] baptize you into the body.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; You can try,
[38:03] you can try all you want to try and
[38:05] bring somebody into the message. You can
[38:08] try and speak to them about revelation
[38:09] upon revelation and see if they believe
[38:12] it or not.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has to do the
[38:14] quickening. That's right.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; So, how do you place the body of Jesus
[38:18] Christ in Christ?
[38:23] How do you join the top stone with the
[38:24] headstone?
[38:28] Right? The way you do it is by the Holy
[38:32] Spirit. We're going to read a scripture.
[38:34] Right? The same spirit that dwelt in the
[38:37] groom that made him the headstone is the
[38:40] same spirit that must be in us
[38:43] &gt;&gt; to make us the body of Christ to fit in.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. When all that happens, Amen. that
[38:50] is placing the body of Christ the wife
[38:52] positionally. So what are you saying?
[38:55] Before you can come to adoption, you've
[38:57] got to come through marriage.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Before you can be called the sons of
[39:05] God, you've got to come through
[39:06] marriage.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Christ is not going to have a child of
[39:10] adoption out of wedlock.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; You first have to be united with Christ.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:19] So when that happens placing the body of
[39:22] Christ the wife positionally the
[39:24] marriage union gets us ready for the
[39:26] next step which is adoption and the
[39:28] invisible union. So you need to read
[39:30] messages like invisible union of the
[39:32] heavenly bridegroom with the earthly
[39:34] bride and messages like the marriage of
[39:36] the lamb.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Let's read what the prophet is saying
[39:38] now. Secondly talking about the freefold
[39:40] mystery to have the preeminence in his
[39:43] body of believers. The same body of
[39:46] believers is going to be placed in
[39:49] Christ.
[39:51] Hallelujah.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; For what? Here's the thing. Where does
[39:55] God want to live? In heaven. Somebody
[39:58] say in heaven.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; God wants to live in heaven.
[40:02] In this time and season.
[40:05] Where does he want to live?
[40:10] &gt;&gt; You hear what the prophet is saying?
[40:11] Christ the mystery. Christ the mystery
[40:13] is actually the prophet preaching the
[40:14] seven seal
[40:16] right he's saying have the preeminence
[40:19] in the body of believers that he might
[40:23] live in people
[40:28] &gt;&gt; where does God want to live
[40:30] &gt;&gt; people
[40:32] &gt;&gt; God wants to live in people
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:11 but if the spirit that
[40:42] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[40:44] where?
[40:46] &gt;&gt; In you.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're looking at how we get
[40:49] placed into Christ as a body.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; If the spirit that raised up Jesus from
[40:55] the dead dwell where? In you.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; He that raised up Christ from the dead
[41:00] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[41:03] his spirit that dwelleth in you.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; So Christ has come to dwell in you. And
[41:09] when the seventh seal opens or is
[41:11] broken, it places the body of Christ,
[41:13] the bride, changes the title to the wife
[41:16] and puts her in position in Christ to
[41:19] fulfill Ephesians 1:5.
[41:22] Now, if the body of Christ is not in
[41:24] position,
[41:26] which means the seventh seal is not open
[41:28] to people.
[41:30] The mystery of his coming is not open to
[41:32] people.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; They just in a message church.
[41:36] But like we've been saying, we are not
[41:38] called to a message church.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; We are being called under the seventh
[41:41] seal
[41:42] &gt;&gt; to be placed positionally for adoption.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And the place we are called to is the
[41:48] headstone which is heavenly places in
[41:50] Christ.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Matthew 25:10. Let's read it again. And
[41:55] while they went to buy, the bridegroom
[41:57] came,
[41:59] &gt;&gt; and they that were ready went in with
[42:01] him to the marriage, and the door was
[42:03] shut.
[42:06] Right. So Jesus has come. Christ has
[42:10] come to open the door to marriage. Took
[42:13] us in to be united with him.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Now the first connecting stone in this
[42:18] headstone was William Brham.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; You see, when you're looking at the
[42:27] pyramid, come down. This pyramid is all
[42:30] the way inside
[42:33] &gt;&gt; because the flange
[42:35] &gt;&gt; must fit perfectly here.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; It's coming to a needle point.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; So, the first wave sheep who was waved
[42:41] over the people,
[42:43] &gt;&gt; the first son to come to maturity,
[42:45] &gt;&gt; the first son to come to adoption,
[42:47] &gt;&gt; his name was William Brandham.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And he was the first piece that went up
[42:51] here.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[42:54] Thank you Lord.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; And the teaching is if there's a first
[42:59] wave sheep over the people, it means
[43:01] there are many more to follow.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And the rest are going to connect and
[43:06] come up here and connect and connect and
[43:07] find their place in the body of Christ.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Right now in the message,
[43:19] &gt;&gt; there are two classes of people.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; You're either inside the door. Yes,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; You're inside the door married to Christ
[43:29] the word.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:34] And placed positionally for the adoption
[43:36] now seated in heavenly places or you are
[43:39] in the category of the foolish virgin
[43:42] &gt;&gt; trying to buy oil.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; You say what is oil? Brother Graham says
[43:46] oil is the Holy Ghost.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; But then he also tells you what's the
[43:49] evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[43:52] He's having a revelation
[43:54] &gt;&gt; of the word for your day.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So what are they trying
[43:59] to do?
[44:01] &gt;&gt; They're trying to get revelation.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; You see, it's easy when we say they're
[44:06] trying to get oil,
[44:08] &gt;&gt; but people are trying to get revelation.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; People are trying to get an
[44:13] understanding of the word,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; but they are locked out the door.
[44:18] You can only get true revelation, true
[44:20] understanding in the shikana glory if
[44:22] you come into the message,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; if you're coming through the door. Pay
[44:25] attention to that. Now,
[44:27] &gt;&gt; or another example, like we've been
[44:29] preaching is Queen Esther being married
[44:31] to the king, but too afraid to go into
[44:33] his presence.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; What category are we?
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Are we satisfied to say we're in the
[44:39] message?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:44] Are we satisfied to say we're in the
[44:46] message of the hour, but two are free to
[44:48] come into the king?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Esther chapter 5 shows us the door
[44:54] that's open to her.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; A scepter is raised.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; She starts to unlock the favor of the
[45:00] king, the blessings of half the kingdom.
[45:02] She starts to plan and expose Amon. She
[45:04] starts to Amen. to change the law that's
[45:07] going to kill the Jews.
[45:09] All of this is happening where? under
[45:11] the seventh seal,
[45:12] &gt;&gt; under the coming of the Lord,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; he's tying it with the adoption. He's
[45:16] tying it with sitting together in
[45:17] heavenly places. Now, how do we access?
[45:21] Now, everyone understood that the
[45:23] mystery of his will is adoption.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; How do we get to adoption? Through
[45:27] marriage.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let's see. How do we access then
[45:31] the mystery of us sitting together in
[45:33] heavenly places?
[45:37] Sitting together in heavenly places.
[45:39] He's telling us heavenly places is the
[45:41] believer's position in Christ.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Heavenly places, our wish at the time, I
[45:47] got it marked right here in my Bible
[45:49] about heavenly places. What is heavenly
[45:51] places? Heavenly places, just for a
[45:54] moment, is the believer's position in
[45:56] Christ. Where the believer stands in
[45:58] Christ? Heavenly places.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Now, that may sound casual to you.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; It's knowing your position.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you know your position? You
[46:10] must be baptized into the body.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And once you are baptized into the body,
[46:14] he says the Holy Spirit places you
[46:16] there.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So the prerequisite for accessing
[46:22] heavenly places
[46:24] is to access the mystery of his will,
[46:26] which is adoption.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And how do we access the mystery of his
[46:31] will, adoption? We first must identify
[46:34] the mystery of his coming.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. M hallelujah.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; It's all tied together.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; If we haven't accessed this, the mystery
[46:42] of his coming, we won't know the mystery
[46:44] of his will that he has come to adopt
[46:46] us.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And if we don't know that he has come to
[46:48] adopt us, we won't know that we are
[46:50] supposed to be all the way up here.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You go ask around. Message people
[46:55] think we're in the latest church age.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Wednesday, for those of you who missed
[46:58] it, you missed a good sermon. Amen. The
[47:00] prophet is telling us that we are in the
[47:02] bride age.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; It's a hidden age.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] It's a age they know nothing about.
[47:08] That's why you find people disputing
[47:10] about Revelation 10. Revelation 10 is
[47:12] not for the Gent, not for us.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not for you.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Don't say us.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Take out the S. Put you.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 is not for them.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; No, this this cloud of 1963 has nothing
[47:27] to do with Revelation 10.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; But they're saying they believe the
[47:30] message.
[47:34] Let's see what this mystery of us
[47:35] sitting together in heavenly places is.
[47:38] What did brother Brandham now say? It is
[47:42] knowing our position in Christ.
[47:45] Did we just establish what our position
[47:47] in Christ is?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; We must first be baptized into the body
[47:50] and then be placed into Christ.
[47:53] Christ is the headstone.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; So we we first must be identified. I'm
[48:01] going to say it again for those that
[48:03] wasn't paying attention.
[48:05] In order to get to the last part, the
[48:06] mystery of sitting together, we first
[48:08] must unlock the mystery of his coming.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Right? Once we unlock the mystery of his
[48:15] coming, he's going to tell us how he has
[48:18] taken us into a marriage and he's
[48:20] adopting us.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of his will.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; And once we access the mystery of his
[48:26] will, he now takes us and he places us
[48:29] into the headstone. That's the mystery
[48:32] of sitting together in heavenly places.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; So, we may have taken our position and
[48:39] been baptized into the body. Here is
[48:42] where I'm getting to. People have been
[48:44] baptized into the body of Christ,
[48:46] saying, "I'm in the message. I'm in the
[48:48] message. I'm in the message." But now,
[48:50] the Holy Spirit must take the body and
[48:52] place it where?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Being baptized into the body is not good
[48:58] enough.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:04] Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying the Holy Spirit
[49:08] must take now that you that been placed
[49:10] into the body and place you in Christ.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; I know this is deep for some people, but
[49:16] I'm trying to take it as slow as I can.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Right
[49:20] now, make known unto us the mysteries of
[49:23] his will, the coming. Let me read you
[49:26] something. Let's go back to the pause,
[49:28] brother George. make known unto us the
[49:30] mystery of his will, the coming. Let me
[49:33] read something I was reading over. Let's
[49:35] turn all now over to the mystery of his
[49:37] will.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; The prophet is now going to define the
[49:40] mystery of his will. We said it was
[49:42] adoption. And he's saying, let's go to
[49:45] the seventh chapter of Hebrews.
[49:48] Hey, it sounds like the prophet is going
[49:49] to read the wrong scripture. Why would
[49:51] he want to read about Melzdc?
[49:54] Hebrews 7 is about Melzdc.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And he's saying it's the mystery of his
[49:58] will.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; I'd like to read to you something that
[50:03] would just make you feel so good when
[50:05] you think of us sitting together in
[50:06] heavenly places. Hebrews the 7th
[50:08] chapter.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go on. For this Melzdc. Now watch.
[50:13] King of Salem, priest of the most high
[50:15] God. What's the mystery here? Now here's
[50:18] the mystery. Watch this. Who is this
[50:20] fellow making?
[50:23] knowing
[50:25] the mystery of his will.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; This Melzdc.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; So you mean this is him that came down?
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; He himself came down.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; This mystery. Here's the mystery. This
[50:43] fellow he is making and you are knowing
[50:47] &gt;&gt; the mystery of his will adoption.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Oh church. Why is he tying Hebrews 7
[50:54] with the mystery of us sitting together
[50:55] in heavenly places? Let's keep reading.
[50:59] Praise the Lord. Jesus was the fullness
[51:02] of God manifested. He was the fullness
[51:04] of the Godhead bodily. So, can we agree
[51:07] that he's saying Melzdc
[51:10] &gt;&gt; the word became flesh?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Right. He was the fullness of the
[51:14] Godhead bodily. Therefore, when he came
[51:17] to earth, watching reveal the mystery of
[51:18] his will. Yeah. How many of you know you
[51:21] were here 2,000 years ago?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; When he came to earth and was manifested
[51:28] in the flesh, you were in him then.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; I can take you to Genesis 1 and show you
[51:33] Eve was there but she was you couldn't
[51:35] see her physically.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; She was in Adam.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; So now when you're reading the gospels
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; You know when Jesus is walking and
[51:44] healing the sick, you are there in him.
[51:46] Yeah.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Tyson,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; think of it.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to the man who had no
[51:55] arm
[51:56] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[52:00] &gt;&gt; You are part of him.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. You know how beautiful
[52:03] this teaching is. You know what?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Watch what he just said. He said Jesus
[52:07] was the fullness of the word.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; So if he is the fullness of the word,
[52:13] you and I are part of the word.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; So which means the complete revelation
[52:19] of God was in Jesus.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Let me say it another way. The complete
[52:24] word was locked up in Jesus. And I'm a
[52:27] part of the word. You're a part of the
[52:29] word. So when Jesus was manifested, I
[52:31] was manifested though not seen with my
[52:34] physical eye, but I was locked up in
[52:36] Jesus.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus walked the shores of
[52:39] Galilee and when he walked upon water, I
[52:42] walked upon water because I was in him.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; You see the mystery of his will.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; The mystery of us sitting together in
[52:51] heavenly places.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he was here,
[52:55] &gt;&gt; I was here.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; When he came to the earth and was
[52:58] manifested in flesh, you were here in
[53:00] him. Hey, so nice. When he came and he
[53:03] multiplied the fish and loaves,
[53:05] &gt;&gt; I was a part of that.
[53:08] If I was not part of him, then Jesus was
[53:09] partial word.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a strong statement.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; But he was the fullness of the word.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; The word was with God. The word was God.
[53:21] And the word became flesh and dwelt
[53:23] amongst us.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So all through Jesus life, he's carrying
[53:26] a hidden mystery inside of him.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; He's carrying the hidden mystery of the
[53:30] bride.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. If you're reading Genesis 1,
[53:33] before Adam is put into a flesh body,
[53:35] Adam is carrying the mystery of Eve
[53:37] locked up inside of him.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Adam is having authority over the earth.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Adam is speaking to winds. Adam is
[53:43] speaking to waves. Adam is speaking.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; So you mean when you mean that mystery
[53:51] of why Jesus is trying to tell us Mark
[53:53] 11:23 is because we had amnesia?
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus went to the tree,
[53:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; we were in it. Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; So now he comes to tell you how to
[54:08] operate like that. Praise the Lord.
[54:10] Let's keep reading. How many of you
[54:11] enjoying this?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is our climax, so you better
[54:13] enjoy it. Praise the Lord.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Therefore, when he came to the earth and
[54:17] was manifested in flesh, you were in him
[54:20] then.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Because he was the word. In the
[54:28] beginning was the word and the word was
[54:29] with God. And the word was God.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word was made flesh and
[54:36] dwelt among us. The word was made flesh.
[54:39] Therefore, you walked with him.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; When you were in him, when he was on
[54:44] earth,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; you suffered with him.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, I hope you got strong stomach
[54:50] lining. Please don't tell me your ulcers
[54:52] are flaring up now because this food
[54:54] here is not agreeing with your digestive
[54:55] system.
[54:58] If that's you this morning, I want you
[54:59] to do what the prophet did when he was
[55:01] proclaiming his heal. He said that food
[55:03] was coming up
[55:04] &gt;&gt; and he swallowed it back down.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; If you can't digest it, swallow it back
[55:10] down.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; You suffered with him.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; You died with him.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; You buried with him.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And now you are risen with him. Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Manifested attributes of God sitting in
[55:22] heavenly places already raised
[55:26] &gt;&gt; resurrected to new life.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Sitting in heavenly places in Jesus
[55:29] Christ. Oh, that means so much nowadays
[55:32] church. That means so much to us to see
[55:35] ourselves positionally placed in Jesus
[55:38] Christ.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not of this world.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I was expressed into time. I'm not of
[55:46] this world.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] Praise the Lord.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; We must be there. We must be the church,
[55:55] the bride of Christ. I lived with him on
[55:57] the earth when he lived. I died with him
[55:59] when he died. I rose with him when he
[56:01] rose.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; I assembled and I'm seated with him now
[56:06] in heavenly places because I'm part of
[56:08] him. Wherever he is, there I am.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Go listen to the scripture we took when
[56:13] we preached manifest. Call to the
[56:14] headstone to manifest. What did Jesus
[56:16] say? that where I am, you may be also.
[56:19] And we showed you Christ is now in the
[56:20] headstone. So, you've got to be where he
[56:22] is.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Because I'm part of him. Wherever he is,
[56:28] there I am. Where my servant is, there
[56:30] will I be also. That's John chapter 12
[56:33] he's quoting.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Now, he can fellowship with us and
[56:43] through us and rest his word with us.
[56:46] Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Hey.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Where's he resting his word?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. Now he can
[56:52] fellowship with us. Do you know if
[56:54] you're part of the Leadyian church age,
[56:56] Christ can't fellowship with you?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know if you're outside the throne
[57:00] room where Esther was, he can't
[57:02] fellowship with you.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Do you know if you're outside the door
[57:05] where Christ has opened the door, he
[57:07] can't fellowship with you.
[57:10] Right.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; He can fellowship with us and through us
[57:15] and rest his word with us.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Which we are a part of his word. If he
[57:20] is the word, we are part of him. Then we
[57:23] are part of the word.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; I tell you church, I'm closed now. But I
[57:28] tell you this,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; don't be part of the nom nominal church,
[57:32] message church.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; You'll get left behind.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; You will get left behind. That's true.
[57:40] Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Because foolish virgin
[57:42] &gt;&gt; is not denomination.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Denomination is not virgin.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go read the Bible.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that a mother is a harot.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Sorry, a
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; And the daughter is a prostitute.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; How many of you saw a virgin prostitute?
[58:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Believe them. Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; So where you going to find the virgins?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; So don't be satisfied with saying I'm
[58:14] called to the message.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; I believe the message.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; I believe the prophet.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That's going to get you nowhere.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; It's a start.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; But don't stop there.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Get into Christ.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Right. What was the key? I'm going to
[58:29] summarize now.
[58:31] How do Let's see. The prophet said, if
[58:33] you put up that first quote, brother
[58:35] Josh, we'll summarize with how we
[58:37] started and let's see if we now
[58:39] understand his quote.
[58:42] Praise the Lord.
[58:44] The first quote, you got it. Jesus said,
[58:49] he says, he made known unto us the
[58:50] mystery of his will.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Spirit on you sometime.
[58:54] Start running that and just watch how it
[58:56] goes. This afternoon, I had about 15
[58:59] minutes between the times. Amen. Go.
[59:04] And I got to running and I thought, how
[59:05] mysterious the scripture packed me back
[59:08] and tied something together
[59:12] to see the mystery of his coming.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; The mystery of his will, adoption.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And the mystery of us sitting together.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; The mystery of us sitting together. What
[59:28] is adoption? the Holy Spirit taking the
[59:31] body of Christ and placing it in Christ.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; If you miss the shout, you miss the
[59:41] rapture.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; What is the shout? Did we read that the
[59:45] shout is going to gather the people
[59:46] together?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And then did we read a second quote to
[59:49] say the seven thunders gather us
[59:50] together? Amen. Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; So maybe you've been sitting here
[59:54] wondering now if you knew that the seven
[59:57] thunders was going to give you rapturing
[59:59] faith and we're telling you that the
[1:00:01] seven thunders is the sharp message
[1:00:03] going forth.
[1:00:05] Can we still leave that book there lying
[1:00:07] like that
[1:00:09] when what's in that book is going to
[1:00:11] give us rapturing faith? No. This book
[1:00:14] has maybe how many pages with it,
[1:00:17] George? 20 pages, 30 pages. Thin book.
[1:00:22] Thin book.
[1:00:24] Here's an movie. 1 hour.
[1:00:28] Uh, choice to make. Do I read the book?
[1:00:31] Do I watch the movie?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; No. No. You know, I'm so tired. I came
[1:00:37] from work. I got to eat. You know, if
[1:00:40] you're really hungry for God, ask these
[1:00:42] brothers what they used to do
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; in their lunchtime, they'll eat their
[1:00:46] lunch and read.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Put your hands up, brothers, if you did
[1:00:52] that.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I want the younger people to see that
[1:00:55] you did that.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Who did that? Put your hands up.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying where you place
[1:01:01] value,
[1:01:03] sometimes you'll even say, you know
[1:01:04] what, I don't want to eat right now. Let
[1:01:06] me read this thing first.
[1:01:09] But that's how you're going to know. You
[1:01:10] can't say, "I love Jesus. I love Jesus."
[1:01:12] And you don't love his word. Hey, I feel
[1:01:15] like I'm sounding like Pastor Ronnie
[1:01:16] right now.
[1:01:18] You can't say you love Jesus. You love
[1:01:20] Jesus. And you don't love his word.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; You don't spend time with him.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; So, how many of you I'm not going to
[1:01:28] judge you or ask you a question. I'm
[1:01:31] saying how many of you are going to
[1:01:32] value what we have even more knowing
[1:01:34] that it is the seven thunders.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes sir.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; That's giving us faith for rapture.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; And it lies in these things that we are
[1:01:42] reading to position us.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Now quick as one two three I want you to
[1:01:47] say put your hand up right as soon as I
[1:01:49] say this. Put your hand up and the first
[1:01:51] one will get a prize. How many of you
[1:01:54] want to miss the rapture?
[1:01:58] Nobody. And the key for not missing the
[1:02:00] rapture is this message.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. What are you doing with Jesus on
[1:02:07] your hands?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Will you be guilty of rejecting the word
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; or will you not come up and ascend to
[1:02:15] heavenly places?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Appreciate what has been given to us.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I ask you again, what you're
[1:02:23] hearing right now, the Holy Spirit is
[1:02:25] revealing this to us
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; to position us and get us ready for that
[1:02:29] body change.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Without this, we're not going.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:34] Hallelujah.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Shut in with God
[1:02:52] in the secret
[1:02:55] place.
[1:02:58] There
[1:03:00] in his presence,
[1:03:03] belowing
[1:03:05] his face,
[1:03:08] I'm gaining
[1:03:11] the power
[1:03:14] to ride in this race.
[1:03:20] I love
[1:03:22] to be shing
[1:03:25] with God.
[1:03:28] Oh sh with God. Shing
[1:03:33] with God
[1:03:36] in the sing.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; All there in his presence. There
[1:03:44] in his presence,
[1:03:48] the holy.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, church of God. You're giving
[1:03:53] you power.
[1:03:57] [Music]
[1:04:04] I love
[1:04:07] to be shal.
[1:04:12] Let's just raise our hands and say shut
[1:04:14] in with God.
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:18] Oh church,
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; hear the Holy Spirit call.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; This is the word to give you power.
[1:04:28] Yes, in his presence.
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, new power is coming to us.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; How does power come by knowing our
[1:04:47] position?
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; I love
[1:04:51] to be shouting.
[1:04:55] One more time, let's sing with God.
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; We are shutting, oh God, with you.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Sealed away from the world, oh God.
[1:05:08] Sealed away from the things of the
[1:05:10] world, oh God.
[1:05:13] In his presence,
[1:05:17] we glory
[1:05:22] again.
[1:05:25] Give you power
[1:05:28] to run
[1:05:31] this.
[1:05:33] I love
[1:05:36] to be shing
[1:05:39] with God. Amen. Can we just talk to the
[1:05:42] Lord and give him praise? Give him
[1:05:44] glory. Amen. Just worship him. Just give
[1:05:47] him praise. Just thank him. Amen. That
[1:05:49] he's called us.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That he's revealed the mystery of his
[1:05:52] coming to us. He's revealed the mystery
[1:05:54] of his will to us and he's revealed to
[1:05:56] us the mystery of sitting together in
[1:05:58] heavenly places. Amen. Oh, just start to
[1:06:00] thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. Thank
[1:06:02] the Lord. Amen. Thank you. Amen. Glory
[1:06:07] be holy name. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:06:10] Revelation of your word, oh God. Thank
[1:06:13] you, Lord, for revealing it to us, oh
[1:06:15] God. Oh, flesh and blood has not
[1:06:17] revealed this to us.
[1:06:20] Oh, but our father has revealed us to
[1:06:22] us.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; has come to dwell in the hearts of his
[1:06:27] people.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; We give you glory and praise, oh God.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; To know, oh God, we are seated with you
[1:06:33] right now, oh God. We have taken our
[1:06:36] position as the bride body, Father, to
[1:06:39] welcome back the headstone.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; We give you glory, Lord Jesus.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; We give you honor, Father.
[1:06:49] Thank you Jesus.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Oh worthy is his name.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Worthy is his name.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord this journey.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Oh we love to be shut in with Jesus.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Love to be shut in.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Glory glory glory glory glory. Thank you
[1:07:13] Jesus.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:07:17] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; You say maybe why didn't you preach a
[1:07:22] sermon amen to empower me.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; You missed the sermon
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; to know your position gives you
[1:07:28] authority and power.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; This is power being given to the church.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; When you take away the amnesia
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; to show that you are as eternal as God
[1:07:37] is eternal.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; When God thought about the lamb slain
[1:07:41] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:07:45] Think of a church. If you had to think
[1:07:48] of making a sacrificial lamb, who would
[1:07:53] you have to think of first?
[1:07:56] You would have to think of the one who
[1:07:58] fell first
[1:08:00] before I can think of how I'm going to
[1:08:01] redeem that person.
[1:08:04] So, he is the lamb slain from before the
[1:08:06] foundation of the world.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And my name was put in that book of life
[1:08:11] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:08:14] I have eternal qualities about me.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; God's thought about me was before he he
[1:08:20] thought about creating heavens and
[1:08:22] earth.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Think about it again. Genesis 1 says,
[1:08:27] "In the beginning, God created the
[1:08:28] heavens and the earth." But the Bible is
[1:08:30] telling me that he put my name before
[1:08:32] the foundation of the earth.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; So before God said, "Let there be," he
[1:08:37] already thought of me.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Do you know you're a
[1:08:43] very part of God
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; right now? Start to access that
[1:08:47] anointing.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Start to access that anointing within
[1:08:50] you.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Why I'm asking you to access that
[1:08:52] anointing.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; You are amateur gods on the earth right
[1:08:55] now.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And we have all these prayer requests.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; As God spoke in the beginning and said,
[1:09:02] "Let there be. I want you to activate
[1:09:04] your corporate anointing now as the body
[1:09:06] of Christ."
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Sister Victory not well. She's got a
[1:09:09] muscle problem. Amen. Pain in her arm.
[1:09:12] She went for an injection yesterday.
[1:09:13] Amen. But was with extreme pain even
[1:09:15] through the night. Couldn't make it for
[1:09:17] service this morning. Many believers
[1:09:19] unwell in body. Couldn't make it for
[1:09:20] service this morning. Amen. You're
[1:09:22] trusting God for a miracle. You're
[1:09:24] trusting God for a job. You're trusting
[1:09:25] God for promotion. You're trusting God
[1:09:27] for a marriage partner. I am saying
[1:09:29] right now, you can activate it and speak
[1:09:32] a word over your situation right now.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; The power don't lie in the preacher. The
[1:09:36] power lies in you believing the
[1:09:37] preacher.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; The power lies in you believing the
[1:09:40] word. Yes.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking you right now to take
[1:09:42] these needs to the Lord.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. Amen. I'm not going to
[1:09:45] ask any individual to pray, but I'm
[1:09:47] going to ask all of you to pray. Amen.
[1:09:50] Do you know that some people are lost,
[1:09:51] some people are trapped,
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and you have the power to call them in?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; You have the power right now. Like
[1:09:56] sister said, I ask for the salvation of
[1:09:59] my two boys.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know if you meet the same
[1:10:02] conditions right now, you can ask for
[1:10:03] the salvation of your children.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe your children are not
[1:10:09] showing interest.
[1:10:11] Your children are weward. Your family
[1:10:13] member is weward.
[1:10:16] God has given you this power right now.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with it,
[1:10:20] church?
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's pray together,
[1:10:23] church. Amen. Take your needs to the
[1:10:25] Lord. Take your burdens to the Lord.
[1:10:27] Let's sing. Leave it there. Leave it
[1:10:28] there. While you'all are playing that, I
[1:10:29] want the church to start to pray.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Let's start to pray.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; You got these prayer requests. You've
[1:10:35] heard. Amen. All these prayer requests.
[1:10:37] I want you to activate the power of a
[1:10:39] spoken word that's within
