[18:01] [Music]
[18:11] amen hallelujah amen you can take your
[18:15] seats at this time amen
[18:17] [Music]
[18:23] amen it's good to praise and worship our
[18:25] god and king amen
[18:27] oh amen sometimes amen even when you're
[18:29] feeling down amen but when you begin to
[18:31] worship god amen
[18:32] you can start to see the joy in our
[18:34] child amen like paul said
[18:36] amen i just want to share a few words of
[18:38] testimony this morning
[18:40] i actually supposed to sing a song but
[18:42] then i thought about it
[18:44] since i had my experience of uh losing
[18:47] my brother as you all know
[18:49] i never got a chance to really share a
[18:51] few testimonies of what actually
[18:53] transpired through the time
[18:55] and now god seen us through and amen
[18:57] encouraged us at that time
[19:00] amen so as you know it was quite a
[19:02] trying time
[19:03] when we lost uh jonathan our brother
[19:07] and it was something unexpected for us
[19:09] because that was something we never
[19:11] really expected and from
[19:13] in our immediate family we never really
[19:14] lost anyone close to us
[19:16] apart from relatives but no one in our
[19:18] immediate family
[19:20] so the week before uh jonathan passed on
[19:25] i was praying for him and josh and i was
[19:29] both trained together and we were both
[19:30] sharing testimonies
[19:32] and at that stage we had no idea that
[19:35] god was going to take him away that week
[19:38] so i was praying and asked god for a
[19:40] confirmation
[19:42] and i said god this happened a few times
[19:44] the prophet when the prophet would just
[19:46] open the bible and find some sort of
[19:48] confirmation
[19:49] so i specifically asked god in my prayer
[19:52] and i said
[19:53] i'm gonna open the bible not once or
[19:55] twice but three times
[19:57] and in those three times if you give me
[19:58] a direct word then i'll know that it's
[20:00] from you
[20:02] so i open the bible just like the first
[20:05] scripture my eyes laid on was i won't
[20:07] remember the exact scripture but the
[20:08] words were
[20:10] your ways are not my ways and my ways
[20:12] are higher than your ways
[20:14] amen so sometimes when we have our own
[20:16] expectations of how things are going to
[20:18] turn out or perhaps how are you gonna
[20:19] get your healing
[20:20] but god says my ways are not your ways
[20:23] amen
[20:24] the next so i closed the bible i opened
[20:26] it again and the next scripture that i
[20:28] read was
[20:29] and jesus healed every severe pain now
[20:33] that was the first time i ever saw the
[20:35] bible mentioned in the word severe pain
[20:37] you'd usually see and jesus heal their
[20:39] disease or
[20:40] heal their sicknesses but it was quite
[20:43] striking to me that i found those words
[20:45] severe pain because
[20:47] uh what my brother was actually going
[20:49] through was very severe pain
[20:51] at the time not even morphine was
[20:53] helping him
[20:54] so that really struck me and so i closed
[20:57] the bible again and i opened it for a
[20:58] third time
[21:00] and the scripture that god gave me in
[21:01] the third time my eyes fell on was
[21:03] in the parable of the prodigal son and
[21:05] the scripture that god gave me was
[21:08] and behold that brother was lost is now
[21:10] found he
[21:11] was once dead is now alive
[21:14] so i never really thought that god meant
[21:17] that he was gonna take him that week
[21:19] so i i applied it more to a spiritual
[21:22] application
[21:23] and as the week panned out i began to
[21:26] get desperate and
[21:28] now i really know what it means when we
[21:29] when someone gives a prayer request and
[21:31] we say we gotta put ourselves in their
[21:33] shoes
[21:34] because when it's someone close to you
[21:36] that you know that's uh
[21:38] either very sick or about to lose their
[21:40] life i tell you what you get
[21:42] really in a state of desperation it got
[21:44] to a stage where i even
[21:46] i had to leave my wife at a mom's place
[21:48] i told i just wanted to be alone and
[21:49] fast and pray
[21:51] and i didn't eat anything uh any food
[21:53] for that for that two days that's how
[21:55] desperate i began to get
[21:58] and it so happened the next two days
[22:01] after that
[22:02] uh jonathan had passed on and so
[22:06] when we entered the hospital room
[22:09] because we had that scripture
[22:12] and joshua also agree with me on this
[22:15] we cannot explain the peace of god that
[22:18] full our hearts at that moment even
[22:19] though we entered into the room
[22:21] and basically staring at a dead body we
[22:24] didn't start to cry we didn't start to
[22:26] panic
[22:26] we didn't start to fear but there was
[22:28] such a peace of god that came
[22:30] over us at that time that we cannot
[22:32] explain and it wasn't us because
[22:34] after that when the funeral was over
[22:36] obviously we mourned and we were sad
[22:38] but at that particular time and i
[22:40] believe the prophet calls it
[22:42] when the supersense comes down it's a
[22:45] peace that surpasses all
[22:46] understanding so i'd like to thank god
[22:50] for that because
[22:51] actually my father was with us and if it
[22:54] wasn't for that peace of god we most
[22:55] probably would have broken down
[22:57] so i like to thank god for keeping us
[22:59] through that time and there are many
[23:01] other supernatural things that
[23:03] that happen and i'd like to share just
[23:05] this one instant
[23:07] and maybe sometimes to when when someone
[23:10] else shares their testimony it might not
[23:11] be personal to you but i pray that it
[23:13] will
[23:14] increase your faith in some way a few
[23:16] days after my brother passed on
[23:19] i did i stayed at my mom's house uh
[23:22] for that for that week and uh my brother
[23:25] actually had married my neighbor
[23:27] so his wife and the children were
[23:29] staying next door
[23:31] so i went to lock the outside gate and
[23:33] when i came back i saw my
[23:35] five-year-old nephew standing outside in
[23:37] the night and looking at the stars
[23:39] so i asked him what you're doing outside
[23:41] you know it's so late and it's so cold
[23:43] what what are you doing outside so you
[23:44] just told me he's looking at the stars
[23:46] so i went inside the house and then he
[23:48] sent me a whatsapp from his mom's phone
[23:50] while i was in the house
[23:52] and he said i was talking to a man
[23:54] outside and the man said that he was
[23:56] coming to
[23:57] well the world was slice me that's how a
[23:59] child would talk
[24:01] so that that really got me a bit worried
[24:03] now so i called him over and i
[24:05] asked him what happened and we i've also
[24:07] phoned josh i had him on the video call
[24:10] and we was going and we was praying for
[24:12] him and what struck me was how he
[24:14] described
[24:15] this man he said that he was looking
[24:16] into the sky
[24:18] and a window opened up and a man came
[24:20] through the window and this is a
[24:21] five-year-old boy
[24:24] and he has dressed in sort of brown a
[24:27] brown garment and he had a sword on his
[24:29] side
[24:30] so the only thing that i could identify
[24:32] this was a demon spirit
[24:35] so we prayed over him and we begin to
[24:38] castor that spirit
[24:39] and and the words that the demon
[24:41] actually told him was
[24:42] if you you must stop coming to see my uh
[24:46] his father
[24:46] otherwise he's going to attack all of us
[24:48] and the night before he act
[24:49] my father actually had an attack um
[24:53] by an evil spirit so we cast out that
[24:55] spirit and we began to pray
[24:58] and when i went outside after after we
[25:01] prayed i went outside and i was on the
[25:02] phone call with
[25:04] with brendan and i sharing with him what
[25:06] happened
[25:07] and as i was talking to him i was
[25:08] looking up into the sky
[25:10] and i saw a light sort of a star but it
[25:13] was much lower
[25:14] and it flew from sort of here to like
[25:17] around where the just passed where the
[25:19] speaker is and it disappeared
[25:20] right before my eyes and for me this was
[25:24] obviously a shock now because i was busy
[25:26] on the phone call
[25:28] and the only thing that i can identify
[25:30] that would be the angel of god that's
[25:31] come down after we begin to pray and
[25:33] call upon the angel of god to come down
[25:36] that's what i can identify with and it
[25:38] so happened that that light flew in the
[25:40] direction
[25:41] of where my nephew saw this demon
[25:45] and so after that he's never had that
[25:47] he's never had that experience again
[25:50] and well as a family we begin to have
[25:52] peace
[25:53] so you know when we we're always talking
[25:56] about the supernatural but
[25:58] just to encourage all that we always got
[26:00] to be aware that the unseen is
[26:02] always amongst us amen the angels of god
[26:04] are right
[26:05] with us and so is demon powers and
[26:07] that's why we got to be on watch a man
[26:09] so i pray that encourages you all to
[26:11] amen
[26:12] it's not something that we uh hold on to
[26:15] as our as our major as the prophet said
[26:18] amen we hold on to the word our faith is
[26:19] anchored on the word
[26:20] but amen god gives us these little
[26:22] things to encourage us because he's
[26:24] faithful amen is compassionate
[26:26] and amen he loves us amen and also i'd
[26:28] like to thank god for
[26:29] at the same time witnessing to my other
[26:31] brother samuel
[26:33] for those of you who don't know my
[26:34] brother samuel is sitting at the back
[26:36] he's been visiting church for a few
[26:37] weeks now
[26:39] so i like to thank god for working in
[26:40] his life as well he's got baptized in
[26:42] the name of the lord jesus christ and we
[26:44] like to thank god for that amen
[26:46] amen let's all stand
[26:58] if it had not been
[27:21] i would have drowned in the water
[27:29] but my soul has
[27:33] an escape
[27:37] a hiding place
[27:41] in you
[27:42] [Music]
[27:44] and the vowlessness
[27:50] [Music]
[28:10] [Music]
[28:13] i can't live without
[28:16] [Music]
[28:35] [Music]
[28:42] i
[28:49] [Music]
[28:59] nothing without
[29:03] [Music]
[29:10] can't live you you
[29:15] without you
[29:18] i live and moving
[29:27] [Music]
[29:35] that i breathed
[29:41] [Music]

[30:05] [Music]
[30:06] here
[30:08] [Music]
[30:20] mmm
[30:32] i believe the holy spirit has put us in
[30:34] our right mind amen that we can come and
[30:36] worship him
[30:37] with praise give him all the glory
[30:40] and that is worthy of all praise amen
[30:44] just like to encourage the believers
[30:46] that i'm not coming
[30:50] think some of them should be coming now
[30:53] maybe some of them are making an excuse
[30:57] not to come to church thinking they're
[31:00] going to get the virus
[31:02] well if they can't come to church
[31:04] thinking they're going to get the virus
[31:06] they mustn't go anywhere they must go to
[31:09] work
[31:10] they mustn't go to the supermarkets they
[31:13] mustn't go anywhere
[31:16] but they won't come to church and it's
[31:19] more
[31:19] easier for them to get the balance of
[31:21] the slow market
[31:23] and in the crowds see
[31:27] so don't make an excuse and say you're
[31:30] going to get the virus because nobody
[31:31] yet
[31:32] has got the virus amen we got the
[31:35] antidote
[31:38] jesus christ and also young children
[31:41] also
[31:43] you know the record they the young
[31:45] children can go through this
[31:48] they've got an immune system so don't
[31:51] get them used to staying at home
[31:55] get them used to coming to church alfred
[31:59] amen have faith until we bring the
[32:01] church amen
[32:02] we're going to serve the law amen see
[32:06] so we pray give us grace and uh
[32:10] and i pray none of them died from this
[32:12] virus
[32:14] we won't even see the body
[32:17] isn't it we won't even see the body
[32:21] we gotta go seal but we like to see them
[32:25] before the gourmet
[32:28] so come to church and worship the lord
[32:31] right and faith
[32:34] but then the bible said jesus said you
[32:36] shall drink every deadly things and walk
[32:38] upon
[32:39] scorpions and serpents do you know
[32:44] so you find these people not coming they
[32:46] drink something on the other days
[32:49] definitely going to the supermarket i
[32:51] mean they've got to have food to eat
[32:53] so they're going to go buy the food so
[32:56] come for some spiritual food
[32:59] i pray god will make a way amen so 10
[33:02] obama's the book of
[33:03] uh hebrews chapter 11.
[33:08] so hebrews stopped the 10th i don't like
[33:10] these mics and all sticking around my
[33:12] face here
[33:14] i get very nervous so i'm going to bless
[33:18] us as
[33:19] uh bonnie and uh
[33:22] you know we are living in a very uh
[33:24] stressful time
[33:27] and the believers are going through a
[33:28] test around the world
[33:31] and uh so people are praying
[33:34] the more they preach and the more they
[33:38] pray for divine healing more people are
[33:40] getting sick
[33:42] even though sponsors are praying for
[33:43] people all the time
[33:46] their family is getting attacked see the
[33:49] devil is putting them through a test
[33:52] trying time but they got more faith to
[33:54] believe
[33:56] and trust god but then i want to say
[33:59] this
[34:00] morning that people can get healed and
[34:03] still die
[34:05] they'll get healed and live for a while
[34:07] they're still gonna die
[34:10] but jesus raised up lazarus from the
[34:12] dead but he still had to die
[34:15] the prophet prayed for many many people
[34:17] received the healing in their day
[34:19] but today they're all dead
[34:23] but god healed him for time see but we
[34:26] all still gotta die
[34:28] because we know it's a it's appointed on
[34:30] a man
[34:31] 70 years right and he can't live
[34:35] above that years so uh
[34:38] we're still going to die and these
[34:41] bodies
[34:41] like a factory it's a factory every
[34:45] organ has got work to do
[34:48] see and then sometimes the system breaks
[34:50] down and
[34:51] and everything else and it affects the
[34:53] body and things like that
[34:55] but uh god knows all things
[34:58] see that the enemy comes in there they
[35:00] attack the body
[35:02] see so i make an organ to not function
[35:06] and all these things but uh we're just
[35:09] stressing the lord
[35:10] but we are looking for a new body
[35:13] there'll be no organ failure
[35:15] there'll be no sickness praise the lord
[35:19] and we know we're not very far from
[35:20] there
[35:22] we're living right now if you're
[35:25] following the news
[35:27] american can start any time it actually
[35:29] started
[35:31] you know israel and iran is at war
[35:34] already
[35:36] they're actually attacking each other by
[35:38] uh santo force
[35:41] and taking uh infrastructure water and
[35:43] all these things
[35:45] and we're living in such a such a
[35:47] deceptive time
[35:49] if you look at this now america
[35:54] with israel was working up the peace
[35:57] plane
[35:59] right to take part of uh west bank
[36:03] and under their control
[36:07] and then we got the the russians
[36:09] protecting the syrian president
[36:13] then we got iran and taking israel from
[36:16] syria
[36:18] and israel is attacking the bases where
[36:21] they are trying to attack them from
[36:24] now what china has done the president
[36:26] he's made friends with the palestinians
[36:33] and he's he's supporting them whereas
[36:36] now is being in direct conflict with
[36:38] america
[36:40] to say that we are here with the
[36:41] palestinians now let me let me see what
[36:44] you're going to do
[36:46] so it's a very conflicting time so we
[36:49] know armageddon is going to start
[36:52] and we know when that starts now the
[36:53] rapture must go yes
[36:55] praise the lord so we're believing for
[36:57] that this morning so we'll read from our
[36:58] bibles
[37:00] uh the book of hebrews chapter 10 sorry
[37:03] hebrews chapter 10
[37:04] uh the title of the message is pressing
[37:07] on to the rapture
[37:09] and the promised kingdom pressing on to
[37:12] the rapture
[37:13] and the promised kingdom amen right but
[37:16] faith that is what the believer is
[37:17] dreaming amen
[37:18] amen that is what the basic bully was
[37:20] doing
[37:22] pressing on to the rapture yes and the
[37:25] promised kingdom
[37:26] right so that is the believers of the
[37:29] brightness so let's see what the
[37:30] scripture says now
[37:31] uh some other people now reading from
[37:34] verse
[37:34] 31 hebrews 10 31
[37:38] it is a fearful thing to fall
[37:42] into the hands of the living god
[37:46] but call to romans remembrance the
[37:49] former days
[37:50] in which after you were illuminated
[37:56] what that means they would like to do
[37:59] the world
[38:01] after they were eliminated you endure
[38:05] a great fight of afflictions
[38:09] partly whilst you are mainly grazing
[38:11] stock
[38:13] bought by reproaches and afflictions and
[38:16] partly
[38:17] whilst you became companions of them
[38:21] that were so used for you had compassion
[38:24] of me in my bonds
[38:27] and took joyfully the spoiling of your
[38:30] goods
[38:31] knowing in yourselves that you have in
[38:34] heaven
[38:34] a better and an enduring substance
[38:38] caused by the way there for your
[38:40] confidence
[38:42] which are great recompense of reward
[38:46] for your beard of patience then after
[38:49] you have done the will of god
[38:51] you might receive the promise
[38:55] for yet a little while and he
[38:58] that shall come will come and not carry
[39:02] now the judge shall live by faith
[39:06] but if any man draw back
[39:09] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[39:13] but we are none of them will draw back
[39:15] onto petition
[39:17] destruction right but of them
[39:21] that believe to the saving of the soul
[39:25] but we are none of them will draw back
[39:27] into condition
[39:28] but one of them that believe to the
[39:31] saving of the soul
[39:33] praise the lord let's just pray amen

[42:05] them to be i want to say it
[42:07] and uh you know they would be a witness
[42:10] you know something amazing has happened
[42:11] between them
[42:12] am i and i actually had nothing to do
[42:15] with it
[42:17] and i was put into a fix actually
[42:20] it is it is this time i was put into a
[42:23] fix
[42:25] and uh i said something and it was like
[42:27] a commitment and i said oh lord what am
[42:29] i going to do now
[42:31] but the lord made a way see and it was
[42:34] it was between them
[42:35] so i'd like them to be present here
[42:37] they're not well uh
[42:39] they had they were very frivolous and
[42:41] you know like symptoms
[42:43] and they went to the hospital there in
[42:45] bedlam and they didn't like the
[42:46] situation there
[42:48] they did take also the test for the
[42:49] virus and they'll get the results maybe
[42:52] by
[42:53] tomorrow or tuesday but pray for them
[42:55] god will make your way for them see
[42:57] because they've taken the step
[42:59] uh to you know to look together and
[43:02] reconcile
[43:03] so we just pray for them god will make a
[43:04] way praise the lord
[43:06] and also dennis is they're not going to
[43:10] church and out there because
[43:11] there's no church in congress at the
[43:12] moment open
[43:14] and he was coming here but the place is
[43:16] staying stopped in the record you can't
[43:18] go anywhere
[43:20] and uh you must stay over here we don't
[43:21] want you to go in fact they were very
[43:23] angry and they told him to pick up his
[43:25] clothes and leave
[43:27] and they told him to say yeah you better
[43:28] not go anywhere and just stay here
[43:30] so he's looking for a place a room
[43:33] somewhere you can rent
[43:34] you know things like that you want to
[43:35] come back to phoenix so if anybody knows
[43:38] of anybody who's
[43:39] living a room you know stop letting a
[43:42] room in the house or something like that
[43:44] and uh just let us know gotta make our
[43:46] way through
[43:48] so uh you know we may not take these
[43:51] things serious
[43:52] but uh the prophet said you must put
[43:54] yourself in there
[43:56] true and you know how they feel
[44:00] and surely if they didn't stop it you
[44:01] would have been here this morning
[44:03] because he was wanting to come here
[44:04] every week so we pray god will make our
[44:06] way through it
[44:12] if any man grow back my soul shall have
[44:15] no pleasure in it
[44:17] praise the lord if any man grow back
[44:20] see god said my soul shall have no
[44:24] pleasure in him
[44:26] but we are not to them that draw back
[44:28] amen
[44:29] see that's what the scripture says
[44:32] but we are pressing on to the promises
[44:34] of god
[44:35] yes no matter what affliction what we go
[44:38] through
[44:39] what are they and and whatever it is
[44:42] we're pressing through and sorry
[44:44] remember brother sam also forgot to
[44:46] mention him
[44:47] he was taken healed i think when it was
[44:49] uh
[44:50] what it was one day he was taken ill
[44:53] during the night and uh he was he went
[44:56] to the
[44:56] doctors and they gave him some treatment
[44:58] and things like that so just burn him up
[45:00] and pray i've got to make a way for him
[45:01] also
[45:02] so we are we are pressing on the battle
[45:04] not no sickness
[45:06] no infliction nothing can get us down
[45:10] all these things are coming upon the
[45:12] earth now these things are not now
[45:14] they are from from way back people are
[45:17] getting sick
[45:18] elijah the prophet got sick and died he
[45:22] died over sickness
[45:23] so he's been happening from ages and
[45:25] ages and ages
[45:27] but god is also the healer he said i am
[45:30] the lord that healed me amen yes
[45:32] all thy sickness all that diseases amen
[45:35] and he's made away
[45:36] by the atonement though we get afflicted
[45:39] and all this thing
[45:40] but we're still praying and as i said we
[45:43] will get
[45:44] well we'll get better for a while at all
[45:46] but we still got to die
[45:48] see now that is what we're going to make
[45:50] preparations for
[45:51] because the bottom talks about the a
[45:53] second debt also
[45:55] we are going to die we know that but
[45:56] there's a second yet
[45:58] which we don't want to come to the
[46:00] second death amen
[46:02] we want to escape the second death see
[46:04] so that's what i said
[46:05] it's a fear fearful thing to fear fall
[46:08] into the hands of a living god
[46:10] right but if any man draw back my soul
[46:14] shall have no pleasure in him
[46:16] right so the prophet tells us here and
[46:19] the word of god tells us
[46:20] that there was a guy in the days of uh
[46:22] of saint paul by the name of demons
[46:25] and demons left paul and uh he was
[46:29] zooming there in his ministry
[46:30] he left him
[46:34] right and the prophet said you know what
[46:36] how can a man
[46:39] you know he must leave a man like paul
[46:42] with a ministry like that
[46:46] but the bible says he was left and he's
[46:48] gone to the present world
[46:51] but the prophet said he didn't think he
[46:52] backslid and went and did the wrong
[46:55] thing
[46:55] he just lost his influence with being
[46:57] with paul
[46:59] and he saw paul was that his monastery
[47:01] was great and all these things
[47:03] but he saw like uh you know this guy
[47:06] is like poor he's only got one coat
[47:10] he's telling to meet him when you come
[47:11] bring my one coat and come on
[47:13] you know like he can't afford clothes
[47:16] you know and then
[47:17] and he says no demons was a rich guy he
[47:19] was well off
[47:21] but he couldn't stay around and uh and
[47:23] if you don't
[47:24] take the torbjorn there they're probably
[47:26] speaking from aggressive
[47:28] present stage of my ministry amen that
[47:32] many people are going to leave
[47:33] and go and he actually makes a statement
[47:35] there he says uh earned blackstone you
[47:38] know was his
[47:39] campaign manager right from canada
[47:42] and uh he says er baxter made this
[47:45] comment
[47:46] that when he gets to heaven and he finds
[47:49] demons there
[47:50] he's gonna give him a smith across his
[47:51] face and say why didn't you ever leave
[47:54] paul
[47:57] the promise you know that won't really
[48:00] happen that nobody's going to fight or
[48:01] anything like this
[48:02] but i said this one this is what he said
[48:06] you know like i'm going to give him a
[48:07] smack and ask him why did you leave
[48:10] a man like paul a great ministry
[48:14] and he's preaching that in the present
[48:16] stage of my ministry
[48:18] that he's going from one stage to
[48:20] another stage to another state
[48:21] and he's a scene like to the world it
[48:23] was falling back
[48:25] the healing and all was falling back but
[48:27] god was getting ready to
[48:28] do a greater thing amen the opening of
[48:31] the word
[48:32] and if you look at it now the very guy
[48:34] that says
[48:35] why did he muslim he left the prophet
[48:40] he never continued believing the message
[48:43] he went on into the denomination and he
[48:46] was
[48:46] again some of the teachings of what the
[48:48] prophet was teaching
[48:50] so it just shows so divas now left
[48:53] for he left he left the ministry of the
[48:55] day
[48:56] and he went away how come
[49:02] amen and we know the problem said
[49:05] when he was taken back over there he
[49:06] said i only preached what paul preached
[49:10] praise the lord he stayed with that word
[49:13] but he was left him he left wall he left
[49:16] his ministry
[49:17] and we don't know where else he went to
[49:19] right
[49:21] so are we gonna uh
[49:25] you know look
[49:29] i'm just getting the touch here now
[49:33] he's very bad but he does pull away
[49:37] if any man draw back so when god is
[49:40] calling us
[49:42] and the angels of god is there
[49:46] we there's no drawing back now we find
[49:49] these two angels came to lot
[49:53] and suddenly was in a crisis pathetic
[49:57] these two angels came there they wanted
[49:59] to attack them
[50:00] and do a sinful thing but the angels
[50:02] said to lot take your
[50:04] your wife and your two daughters and run
[50:07] don't look back
[50:09] see this is why germany men draw back
[50:12] don't look back
[50:15] just when you keep running now don't
[50:17] look back
[50:19] but now his wife you know like he was
[50:22] disobedient to the garden
[50:25] looked back but the angel said don't
[50:29] look back
[50:31] now she turned into a full of assault
[50:38] you know that is a sad thing and with
[50:41] god all things are possible
[50:43] he can take a human being turn into a
[50:45] pull up assault
[50:48] why she turned into a fuller soul she
[50:50] looked back
[50:52] see so when god has called you and he's
[50:55] uh he sent his angel
[50:57] we believe the angel is going before us
[51:00] and the message is god before us
[51:01] don't look back we are not to look back
[51:04] into the world
[51:06] see now we know that uh uh
[51:09] mr sloth she had two other daughters
[51:12] there and maybe the two other
[51:13] son-in-laws now they were making mockery
[51:15] of them calling and saying
[51:16] they didn't want to believe but they all
[51:19] burnt up in the city
[51:21] they were built up so she had concerned
[51:24] that she had to look back she had
[51:26] concern maybe my grandchildren there
[51:29] my two daughters left behind and uh you
[51:31] know how the after her mother is
[51:34] but she didn't know what was going to
[51:36] happen to her
[51:38] with concern she'll look back but god is
[51:41] not interested
[51:42] in what your concern is he's interested
[51:44] in what he said
[51:46] he said don't look back when god is
[51:50] calling us here
[51:50] with his word and we've seen the power
[51:53] the signs and everything else
[51:54] we have not to look back amen
[51:57] it says here and i'm going to read that
[51:58] in 1 john chapter 2
[52:02] 1 john chapter 2.
[52:06] some people can look back into the world
[52:09] right so let's see what the bible says 1
[52:12] john chapter 2
[52:13] from verse 15.
[52:21] love not the world these are the things
[52:24] that are in the world
[52:26] if any men love the world the love of
[52:28] the father is not in it
[52:30] so when god is calling us now we must we
[52:33] must make it
[52:34] uh you know by the grace of god to serve
[52:37] him
[52:38] amen don't love the things of the world
[52:43] see we must love god love his word amen
[52:47] we are god has given us from the things
[52:49] of this world
[52:50] so it says don't love the things of this
[52:52] world right
[52:55] for all that is in the world the lust of
[52:58] the flesh
[53:00] how many people are caught up there in
[53:02] the lust of the flesh
[53:04] see he can't have two masters that's
[53:07] what he said
[53:09] and the lust of the eyes
[53:12] and the pride of life
[53:15] see how we can love the things in the
[53:17] world
[53:19] lust of the flesh lust of the high and
[53:22] the pride of life
[53:24] is not of the father what is of the
[53:28] world praise hello
[53:31] we mustn't lust up the things of this
[53:33] world
[53:34] which the people are lusting after
[53:37] you know all the things that is not
[53:39] edifying
[53:41] he's not throwing them closer to god
[53:45] see those those are going to bring
[53:48] distraction to them
[53:51] see he says don't love those things amen
[53:55] the world pass it away and the lust
[53:58] thereof
[53:58] but he that does the will of god abide
[54:00] in forever
[54:02] so all these things are going to fade
[54:04] away
[54:05] see it's going to fade away
[54:09] amen
[54:14] but he that doing the will of god
[54:16] abideth forever
[54:18] praise the lord now he said little
[54:22] children
[54:22] it is the last time as you have heard
[54:25] that antichrist has come
[54:27] even now there are many antichrists
[54:31] wherefore we know that it is the last
[54:34] time
[54:35] look at it now the antichrist started
[54:37] writing the page
[54:39] many antichrist antichrist means against
[54:43] the word
[54:44] they were against the word so he's
[54:47] telling them like
[54:48] you know this happy christ here and and
[54:50] what we address them as little children
[54:53] many antichrist see don't be
[54:57] drawn by them don't listen to them
[55:00] right verse 19
[55:05] they went out from us but they were not
[55:08] of us
[55:10] see very men draw back but these are not
[55:13] unbelievers he's talking about
[55:15] yes they supposed to be christians in
[55:18] their day
[55:21] and they went out from us but there were
[55:24] none of us
[55:26] for if they had been of us they would no
[55:29] doubt have continued with
[55:31] us like give us demons who have
[55:34] continued
[55:36] see
[55:40] but they went out that they might be
[55:42] made manifest
[55:43] that they were not of us
[55:48] see there could be people now even in
[55:50] the message
[55:52] a lot of people have gone back they
[55:54] think they're in the message but they
[55:56] got back
[55:58] some people going to church with other
[56:00] churches some people are staying at home
[56:03] see some people stop serving god some
[56:06] people change their dress codes
[56:09] they left the world they love the
[56:12] message
[56:14] they left the faith some of them moved
[56:18] over to other provinces and all
[56:20] and not serving god
[56:23] like they used to serve
[56:26] see they drove back but jesus said
[56:29] my soul shall have no pleasure in them
[56:32] amen
[56:37] now the way he gives the assurance to
[56:39] the believers here but
[56:40] he have an action from the holy one
[56:44] amen and you know all things
[56:48] now the action there is an anointing for
[56:50] religious service
[56:52] they used to do by oil he says now you
[56:55] are anointed
[56:58] maybe it's not that little oil but we
[57:00] have a spiritual anointing
[57:03] that we know all things
[57:07] praise the lord so we're not looking
[57:09] back we are pressing on to the coming of
[57:11] the rapture
[57:13] and the promised kingdom praise the lord
[57:16] so we're not going to draw back
[57:20] if you think now but you know what i i
[57:22] don't think
[57:23] but why did the prophet preach a
[57:24] messenger how can i overcome
[57:27] what you're going to overcome you're
[57:29] going to overcome a lot of things in
[57:30] this life
[57:31] amen don't need that message how can i
[57:33] overcome
[57:36] and now they said are you going to
[57:37] overcome i will come by the world
[57:40] three times jesus was tested and tempted
[57:43] by satan
[57:45] and he said certainly it is written so
[57:48] when you are tested and tempted now
[57:50] are you gonna overcome telling me it is
[57:52] written amen
[57:54] we must not live by these things we must
[57:57] not indulge in the wrong
[57:59] we must not be get caught up with the
[58:01] ungodly of this world
[58:03] we must strive to look before the lord
[58:05] amen
[58:06] amen you got to make a sacrifice amen
[58:09] you got to pay a price also if you
[58:11] haven't watched us
[58:13] amen we're gonna forfeit all our rights
[58:17] your brother said we must fulfill our
[58:19] rights amen he said like the woman will
[58:21] come in america said
[58:22] we have a right to chill out we want to
[58:24] dress and and how we want to wear our
[58:26] hair
[58:26] that forfeit all your lights
[58:30] and the problems and now you fulfill all
[58:32] these things here but you got more to
[58:34] gain on the other side
[58:36] praise the lord amen
[58:39] forfeit all this thing it's only for a
[58:42] while
[58:43] it's only for a season it's all going to
[58:46] perish
[58:48] he says store up on the other side
[58:51] praise the lord
[58:52] sublime sister you know what this world
[58:55] was a
[58:56] a beautiful world when god created it
[58:59] because he said it was good every time
[59:02] you know you create you said it was good
[59:05] and god saw that it was good
[59:07] and god saw that it was good it was
[59:09] beautiful
[59:11] he separated the waters from the land
[59:13] and all these things and
[59:15] all the you know animals and birds and
[59:19] insects and plants and everything
[59:22] beautiful it was
[59:24] but corruption came by man
[59:27] corruption started by men you know i was
[59:30] looking at some pictures there
[59:32] they got one of the space crafts got to
[59:35] mars it's a long
[59:38] long way 385 000 kilometers
[59:43] from here to mars 385 000
[59:49] now they got this uh
[59:53] i don't know what they call it uh i
[59:56] think biking or something i think biking
[59:58] right it's taking pictures at the center
[1:00:02] last lot of pictures
[1:00:03] and i tell you mars look a beautiful
[1:00:06] place
[1:00:08] it looks very much like earth only thing
[1:00:11] there's no plant life
[1:00:13] and there's no water there and then you
[1:00:15] see the beautiful
[1:00:16] mountain ranges and planes and
[1:00:19] everything else and
[1:00:20] and i tell you what if i had an
[1:00:21] opportunity to go to barcelona
[1:00:24] it looks beautiful you don't want it
[1:00:27] there and if there's plant life and you
[1:00:29] can go look there
[1:00:30] i don't mind going and nobody can live
[1:00:32] there
[1:00:34] there's no atmosphere like this and even
[1:00:36] the moon
[1:00:37] the moon look very much like the earth
[1:00:40] if we saw the pictures that they took up
[1:00:41] the moon and sent here
[1:00:43] they got their mountain ranges and and
[1:00:45] all this thing
[1:00:46] right and and it looks
[1:00:50] but nobody can stay there
[1:00:53] they haven't got the atmosphere like we
[1:00:55] got
[1:00:56] see actually the moon haven't got the
[1:00:59] atmosphere the hill has gone
[1:01:01] but it's a beautiful place if you get a
[1:01:04] chance just go and have a look at that
[1:01:06] peaches from mars they send the latest
[1:01:09] one beautiful
[1:01:10] beautiful pictures you know and they got
[1:01:13] uh
[1:01:14] and you can see i don't know whether it
[1:01:15] was too but it looked like there were
[1:01:17] water on there on the mars you know when
[1:01:21] water has been through a place you can
[1:01:22] see this shifting of the sand
[1:01:24] and like lakes and all it seems like
[1:01:26] water used to be there
[1:01:28] but we don't know the bible don't tell
[1:01:30] us anything
[1:01:31] see but man came on the face of the
[1:01:33] earth and that's where corruption
[1:01:34] started
[1:01:36] but it used to be a beautiful place what
[1:01:39] could happen it's sin
[1:01:40] unbelief see that's why jesus said
[1:01:43] the soul that sinned shall die
[1:01:47] now we gotta die first we're gonna die
[1:01:49] right we're gonna live
[1:01:50] whether 70 years 80 years 90 years 100
[1:01:53] years
[1:01:53] we're going to die but when we say
[1:01:57] the soul that sinned shall die god will
[1:02:01] bring a complete destruction to the soul
[1:02:04] and that soul the spirit is living in
[1:02:06] this body
[1:02:07] we will die in this body this body will
[1:02:10] go to the ground
[1:02:12] but the spirit goes back to god
[1:02:15] right so that one is going to be a white
[1:02:17] grown judgment
[1:02:20] the bible tells us there's going to be a
[1:02:21] white throne judgment there
[1:02:23] and everybody is going to be brought to
[1:02:25] the white throat judgment
[1:02:26] after a thousand years after the
[1:02:29] millennium
[1:02:30] after the bride has been spending 1 000
[1:02:33] years upon the face
[1:02:34] of the earth there's going to be the
[1:02:35] white throne judgment
[1:02:38] amen and satan will be cast into the
[1:02:40] lake of fire
[1:02:42] that will be the complete destruction
[1:02:45] it's going to be what they say
[1:02:46] annihilated completely destroyed
[1:02:50] and all the souls are going to come and
[1:02:51] stand and appear before god
[1:02:53] to give an answer for the life that they
[1:02:56] lived
[1:02:57] and the bible says the books were opened
[1:03:01] and all the deeds were over there in the
[1:03:03] book
[1:03:04] that's in the book of revelation right
[1:03:07] it was there all that deeds and how they
[1:03:10] lived and
[1:03:11] and when that given opportunity to
[1:03:12] receive the gospel
[1:03:14] and those that walked away turned away
[1:03:16] from the gospel
[1:03:17] all is going to come up there
[1:03:21] amen what are we going to do
[1:03:24] that's a whiter judgment and the bible
[1:03:28] says now
[1:03:29] this is when they are pronounced to go
[1:03:31] to the second dead
[1:03:34] where the soul is destroyed
[1:03:39] praise the lord and then god
[1:03:42] will make this earth now a foot place to
[1:03:44] live in again
[1:03:46] like i said the earth was a beautiful
[1:03:48] place to live
[1:03:50] so it's going to be beautiful again
[1:03:53] can you picture our health here now a
[1:03:55] beautiful place
[1:03:56] with everybody that i am
[1:03:59] nobody that is old no gray air no
[1:04:03] wrinkles no nothing
[1:04:06] see picture that now and that is where
[1:04:09] we are going to
[1:04:11] look at the promises that we have so let
[1:04:14] us press on
[1:04:15] to the coming of the rapture why live in
[1:04:18] all these big
[1:04:19] elements here the bible says why indulge
[1:04:22] in all these things here
[1:04:24] sometimes people think oh you know what
[1:04:25] uh i need a little
[1:04:27] relaxation you know i need to have some
[1:04:29] wine
[1:04:33] or maybe i need cigarettes to calm my
[1:04:35] nerves
[1:04:37] what kind of people are fighting for
[1:04:39] those things now
[1:04:40] we when the model starts open we want
[1:04:43] cigarettes again
[1:04:45] you see how they came down everybody got
[1:04:47] to listen
[1:04:49] you've never gotta wear your mask you
[1:04:52] don't want your mask you can't go
[1:04:53] shopping
[1:04:55] you can't go anywhere
[1:04:59] see and i want to say something
[1:05:02] that the bible tells us we must also
[1:05:05] wear a garment
[1:05:06] amen if we don't want to be cast out
[1:05:09] we must have the wedding garments
[1:05:12] because the bible says
[1:05:13] there's one man he entered into that
[1:05:15] into the banquet there without the
[1:05:17] wedding garments
[1:05:19] what did he do took him out and threw
[1:05:21] him
[1:05:22] now if anybody go without a mask anyway
[1:05:24] they're not allowed
[1:05:27] you go to the shopping center they throw
[1:05:29] you out
[1:05:34] leave blood holy ghost
[1:05:39] and if you don't have the covering
[1:05:40] they're going to cast them out
[1:05:44] see some people are going to come to
[1:05:45] their wedding went through judgment
[1:05:47] and they're going to be judged they're
[1:05:49] going to give it
[1:05:50] after answer
[1:05:53] francis that's what jesus said
[1:05:57] the people from sodom and gomorrha will
[1:05:59] rise up amen
[1:06:01] the people from delhi will rise up
[1:06:05] the queen of sheba will rise up amen she
[1:06:08] saw great things
[1:06:09] but a greater than solomon is here amen
[1:06:12] and he says now
[1:06:13] we never had all this witness but you
[1:06:15] all had all this witness
[1:06:16] they're going to stand up in the
[1:06:17] judgment
[1:06:20] and we're going to condemn it so those
[1:06:23] people are not
[1:06:24] they may be dead on the earth but they
[1:06:26] are waiting to come to the judgment
[1:06:30] even jesus was there capernaum companion
[1:06:33] if you only know the days that you're
[1:06:35] living in
[1:06:38] you can discern the skies you know you
[1:06:40] know how good science is now
[1:06:42] you can go to get the weather for the
[1:06:44] whole week
[1:06:46] enough people go to let me see what's
[1:06:47] the weather for the whole week i can see
[1:06:49] how much dress
[1:06:50] what clothes i must have already isn't
[1:06:53] it
[1:06:54] so they can they can tell you that the
[1:06:56] weather patterns
[1:06:57] but they don't know the day that they
[1:06:58] are living in
[1:07:01] amen and we got a message here that the
[1:07:04] prophet tells us here
[1:07:05] in the third day god promised to revive
[1:07:08] his
[1:07:09] israel amen in the third day
[1:07:12] so where we are living now we are right
[1:07:15] there in the third day
[1:07:17] amen we are living in the closing of
[1:07:19] time
[1:07:21] amen we are right there in the coming of
[1:07:23] the lord
[1:07:25] so what the bible says now we must be
[1:07:27] overcomers
[1:07:28] we must be persistent amen
[1:07:32] persistent means don't give up
[1:07:36] amen if you are pressing onto something
[1:07:38] be persistent
[1:07:39] amen if you ever want to achieve
[1:07:41] something
[1:07:42] be persistent like if you're studying
[1:07:46] young people if you're studying for
[1:07:48] something you've got to be persistent
[1:07:51] amen you've got to endure if you want to
[1:07:54] achieve
[1:07:56] i mean you can't have a drunk attitude i
[1:07:58] know what i'll just
[1:07:59] take it easy you know when the last
[1:08:02] minute come
[1:08:03] i'll sweat it out that's how we used to
[1:08:06] do in our school days know a couple
[1:08:10] weeks before exam you sweat it out
[1:08:14] i don't know whether i sweated up
[1:08:15] because once in a while i used to copy
[1:08:18] i'm telling you the truth not too much a
[1:08:21] little bit
[1:08:24] see people start copying and they get
[1:08:26] the exam papers
[1:08:28] and it gets leaked out and they want to
[1:08:30] pass the exam
[1:08:31] but they never persisted themselves
[1:08:34] they cheated only how many professionals
[1:08:38] coming with fault certificates
[1:08:42] even doctors got false significant i
[1:08:45] mean they're practicing
[1:08:47] not qualified as doctors
[1:08:50] as long as they can poke at me or their
[1:08:52] doctor
[1:08:54] and the people getting bluffed they've
[1:08:57] got doctors there they're thinking of
[1:08:58] these guys
[1:08:59] but they found that this guy is a fake
[1:09:01] doctor fake is significant
[1:09:04] they research and all you never even go
[1:09:07] to university
[1:09:09] so you can buy a doctor's certificate
[1:09:10] today but don't let them catch you up
[1:09:14] because you'll need a doctor in prison
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:17] so what the bible says here we must
[1:09:19] continue
[1:09:21] so we are none of them will draw back
[1:09:23] unto destruction
[1:09:26] so that's why now jesus said luke 17
[1:09:29] one day he says as it was in the days of
[1:09:32] lord as he possibly sort of
[1:09:34] remember lord's wife
[1:09:37] why is he putting you here in luke 17
[1:09:41] and that scripture is going to be
[1:09:42] fulfilling in our day
[1:09:45] remember lord's wife what he said
[1:09:48] she look back luke 17 he said
[1:09:51] when the son of man is revealed don't
[1:09:53] look back
[1:09:56] press on to the coming of the rapture
[1:09:58] amen don't look back don't hear what
[1:10:00] others are saying
[1:10:01] there are many voices in the world
[1:10:03] people are confusing the bride
[1:10:04] yes there are these people confusing
[1:10:07] them right
[1:10:08] they're telling them all types of things
[1:10:09] over the prophet and you know this
[1:10:11] vision was wrong and that was wrong
[1:10:13] don't listen to all the other voices
[1:10:15] amen yes
[1:10:17] we have one voice we had signs
[1:10:21] and there's a voice behind our signs
[1:10:23] amen not being all the other voices
[1:10:26] see some people are drawing back because
[1:10:29] of other voices
[1:10:32] but they can't go back in the state with
[1:10:33] the voice of god amen
[1:10:36] see that's where they're falling and
[1:10:38] jesus is telling them
[1:10:39] think about it now right then luke 17.
[1:10:44] so shall it be in the days yes
[1:10:48] and we know that was fruitful now that's
[1:10:51] history
[1:10:52] isn't it the son of man has revealed
[1:10:55] himself
[1:10:57] he showed us by discernment what he did
[1:11:00] when he came here the first time
[1:11:02] calling peter andrew and all that he's
[1:11:04] done the same thing you know
[1:11:07] he's the messiah
[1:11:11] i said why are you gonna look back
[1:11:13] probably that's why i said
[1:11:14] there is no other better way than this
[1:11:17] way
[1:11:19] there is no other better gospel than
[1:11:21] this gospel amen
[1:11:24] amen the things that god has made us
[1:11:27] listen to
[1:11:28] by sending his prophet is not preached
[1:11:31] anywhere
[1:11:33] in in the light of truth
[1:11:37] see and now we also know a lot of other
[1:11:40] churches did not
[1:11:41] they know who the antichrist is
[1:11:44] they know now they can see his room
[1:11:48] lots of them other churches see
[1:11:53] but the prophet gave us you know the
[1:11:55] real true revelation when the seals were
[1:11:57] open
[1:11:58] about the antichrist how he started
[1:12:01] writing
[1:12:02] and where he's finishing off praise the
[1:12:04] lord
[1:12:05] so we are looking to that now see we're
[1:12:08] not looking to the things of this world
[1:12:11] see once you know why you'll get
[1:12:13] influenced
[1:12:15] if you let down your god
[1:12:19] amen you will stay too long on your
[1:12:22] on your your on your cell phones you'll
[1:12:26] get influenced the wrong things
[1:12:29] and that doesn't verify the soul
[1:12:33] amen it's a contamination to the spirit
[1:12:38] now what is this body really what are
[1:12:40] these bodies
[1:12:42] this body is a tabernacle to the spirit
[1:12:46] that's all this body is it is housing
[1:12:49] the spirit and soul
[1:12:53] so the outward flesh now want to
[1:12:57] live on all the things of this world but
[1:12:59] the bible says this is the temple of the
[1:13:01] holy ghost now if you went to a temple
[1:13:05] today
[1:13:06] what will be the atmosphere in the
[1:13:07] temple
[1:13:10] holiness some of the peace up
[1:13:13] you know holiness you feel holiness
[1:13:17] are you know really reverent the priest
[1:13:21] is there
[1:13:22] whatever temple you go like holiness
[1:13:26] and the bible says we are the temple of
[1:13:28] the holy ghost
[1:13:30] so there supposed to be some holiness
[1:13:32] about us
[1:13:33] there's supposed to be some
[1:13:34] righteousness about us
[1:13:36] see so we must shed all these things
[1:13:40] and now the problem says dream not the
[1:13:43] holy spirit
[1:13:45] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:13:48] redemption
[1:13:49] amen so if you want to know you've got
[1:13:51] the holy ghost
[1:13:53] when we do wrong we get grieved isn't it
[1:13:57] we know like with something we're not
[1:13:58] supposed to do or not supposed to speak
[1:14:01] or something like that if you've got the
[1:14:03] holy spirit it's grieved in you
[1:14:06] you feel terrible you feel uncomfortable
[1:14:10] and then you want to go on your knees
[1:14:11] that's a lot i'm sorry
[1:14:13] and you contrast the lord and the bible
[1:14:15] says he
[1:14:16] will confess his sin god is faithful and
[1:14:20] just to forgive
[1:14:20] amen we have a high priest
[1:14:24] we have an advocate amen if any man sin
[1:14:30] jesus is there the advocate and the
[1:14:32] blood of jesus christ
[1:14:34] comes us so that's why now when you
[1:14:38] we're not supposed to gossip
[1:14:41] we're not supposed to have a tongue the
[1:14:42] bible talks about the tongue
[1:14:46] it sounds like a ship you know the ship
[1:14:48] is so big
[1:14:49] and they got that what they call it the
[1:14:52] thing that
[1:14:55] right in the bottom there then elbow
[1:14:57] something yeah
[1:15:01] that pilot there is telling a small
[1:15:04] little thing
[1:15:05] and drives the whole ship and the bomb
[1:15:07] says our tongue is like that
[1:15:10] a little member can do a great big
[1:15:11] destruction
[1:15:13] so he says sometimes we must watch what
[1:15:15] we talk
[1:15:17] let our speech be seasoned with songs
[1:15:22] see we gotta watch what we talk what the
[1:15:24] uh
[1:15:25] you know what the people gonna hear what
[1:15:27] we are saying what we are talking
[1:15:30] as christian our speech must be edifying
[1:15:33] to others
[1:15:35] they will say what manner of people is
[1:15:37] this i never heard people talk like this
[1:15:40] amen see so we are the temple of the
[1:15:43] holy ghost
[1:15:45] we have an action an anointing
[1:15:49] praise allah so that is where now you
[1:15:51] have a desire to say lord i don't want
[1:15:53] to live in this body like this
[1:15:56] we are we are subject to all things
[1:15:58] around us
[1:16:00] we are still human
[1:16:03] and the bible says jesus said now many
[1:16:06] places
[1:16:07] if you look upon a woman to rush out
[1:16:09] there
[1:16:12] lust up the eyes so the woman wanted to
[1:16:15] dress herself
[1:16:17] in a certain way she may not know it
[1:16:21] but the men are lasting after
[1:16:24] see they see the way she's dressed and
[1:16:26] she looks very
[1:16:27] attractive and things like that that is
[1:16:30] man
[1:16:32] he start lusting after a woman to look
[1:16:34] at her body
[1:16:35] and he lost up to her body but the devil
[1:16:39] is so
[1:16:40] crooked and and perverted today
[1:16:43] the woman can be fully dressed properly
[1:16:45] they'll still last after
[1:16:49] can we get some air man yeah
[1:16:52] she can be fully dressed she can dress
[1:16:55] like a basic sister and everything
[1:16:57] ben will still lust after that
[1:17:00] if you don't believe that why did the
[1:17:01] pastors fall
[1:17:04] from members in noun congregation
[1:17:08] they never come to looking like a sex
[1:17:10] queen or anything
[1:17:11] they were dressed like sisters
[1:17:15] but how many of them fell
[1:17:19] see so the lust of the high jesus said
[1:17:22] if you look up our over plus
[1:17:24] amen last week we were there in uh
[1:17:27] kenobi
[1:17:27] we went to ghana i went to gonna have my
[1:17:29] little chicken whatever was there
[1:17:33] the one waiting i don't know the wife
[1:17:35] was sitting there man when she looking
[1:17:36] that man
[1:17:38] he looked so terrible i don't know why
[1:17:39] are you looking at lusting after men
[1:17:54] who is she lasted after
[1:17:58] on tell me now she lasted after joseph
[1:18:04] and and her husband had the right name
[1:18:07] b.o.t

[1:18:13] and she said no joseph you look so slim
[1:18:15] you look so handsome
[1:18:17] you know full of life full of vigor
[1:18:20] and everything else come and lie with me
[1:18:25] that joseph was a man of god he
[1:18:28] endured all temptation and he refused
[1:18:34] and then she falsely accused him
[1:18:38] they sent him to prison false accusation
[1:18:43] some women do lust women do look at men
[1:18:49] or maybe before they marry they do like
[1:18:51] look at boys

[1:20:08] they're slow they're waiting waiting
[1:20:12] waiting they think hey you know what
[1:20:13] if you like that girl go tell her and
[1:20:15] they're not get the straight answer

[1:20:22] guilt
[1:20:24] approach them tell him you know what i
[1:20:28] seem to be attracted to you
[1:20:30] yeah it's got to start somewhere
[1:20:36] isn't it see there's got to be that
[1:20:39] fatal attraction stuff somewhere
[1:20:44] huh okay i didn't really finish up there
[1:20:47] now do not lust
[1:20:50] some people get in contact with me
[1:20:52] because they're lusted after them
[1:20:54] that's true see do not desire all these
[1:20:58] things of the world
[1:21:00] see if you want some time to relax you
[1:21:03] know just
[1:21:04] quit all the other stuff and running
[1:21:06] around around just go and relax
[1:21:08] listen to some music listen to the tape
[1:21:11] don't say now i think uh
[1:21:12] i'll have a vienna i know a black market
[1:21:16] and i gotta play black market price
[1:21:19] water stores closed
[1:21:22] so you want a beer you know where to get
[1:21:25] it
[1:21:26] and there's a guy down the road here man
[1:21:28] he's got the stocks
[1:21:31] even if he's selling it for 10 times the
[1:21:33] price you got to get it
[1:21:36] huh yeah you don't get it they want it
[1:21:40] let me relax with another vienna
[1:21:43] let me settle down those things are true
[1:21:49] so let me settle down with there with a
[1:21:51] cigarette
[1:21:53] let me pull that thing and i calm my
[1:21:54] nerves
[1:21:56] you know my nerves are shocked
[1:21:59] but the bible says you temple of the
[1:22:00] holy ghost
[1:22:02] see so if any man grow back my soul has
[1:22:05] no pleasure in him
[1:22:07] see we are not to them that rob but what
[1:22:10] are we
[1:22:11] pulling down on strongholds
[1:22:14] the struggles of the enemy satan
[1:22:19] amen he knows how to attack
[1:22:23] he knows how to come satan knows how to
[1:22:25] seduce
[1:22:28] because he started in the garden of eden
[1:22:31] praise the lord
[1:22:35] so jesus tell us in matthew 6 24 you
[1:22:38] cannot serve two masters
[1:22:40] you must love one and hate the other
[1:22:43] isn't it you can't serve two masters
[1:22:47] so we can't say i'm a coveted christian
[1:22:49] now and i'm serving the lord
[1:22:51] and honesty and that we want to live in
[1:22:53] the world also
[1:22:55] this was love one and eight the other
[1:22:57] one
[1:22:59] you must actually do that right
[1:23:04] so we have an action we have an
[1:23:06] anointing by the holy ghost
[1:23:09] if you read the message of the prophet
[1:23:11] he said right down in the soul
[1:23:13] you have doubt of faith
[1:23:17] right so if you got doubt that is where
[1:23:20] people go back
[1:23:23] they draw back they turn away from god
[1:23:27] they're disbelieving god but if you've
[1:23:30] got faith in the soul
[1:23:32] and the prophet tells the time when his
[1:23:34] wife died
[1:23:35] and he took willie paul to the graveyard
[1:23:37] there
[1:23:38] and billy paul says derry mummy is here
[1:23:40] down the grave and all this thing
[1:23:43] and he started talking and then satan
[1:23:46] came
[1:23:48] said yahweh is your god now
[1:23:51] you're preaching you're jesus
[1:23:55] where is he your wife is here
[1:23:58] your father died in a heart attack your
[1:24:01] brothers died
[1:24:04] why are you bragging about this jesus
[1:24:07] started reasoning with him
[1:24:10] and the prophet said like you know it
[1:24:12] seems like god won't even hear him
[1:24:16] blackness like a blanket came down over
[1:24:19] and he started to reason
[1:24:21] and he says satan though you are right
[1:24:26] where is his god now see in the time of
[1:24:30] crisis
[1:24:30] and people can't get an answer they want
[1:24:33] to
[1:24:34] say god what happened you're not around
[1:24:39] reason
[1:24:42] while he was listening and then he said
[1:24:46] if it hasn't been something way down
[1:24:51] faith amen faith stood up
[1:24:57] and you remember this scriptures of job
[1:24:59] also
[1:25:00] the lord giveth and the lord taken away
[1:25:02] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:25:05] he knew god is in control even in death
[1:25:10] so i said if it wasn't for the
[1:25:11] convergent deep down
[1:25:14] which is faith praise the lord
[1:25:18] that's what we must have don't doubt the
[1:25:21] word of god
[1:25:23] but have faith see
[1:25:26] anything you don't understand don't
[1:25:28] doubt
[1:25:30] see don't doubt anything in the message
[1:25:33] but have faith many things will come
[1:25:37] your way
[1:25:38] give it to reason
[1:25:42] i mean the prophet god teaching medicine
[1:25:45] by taking his wife
[1:25:48] taught me my lesson about taking his
[1:25:49] daughter
[1:25:51] and he he said lord and and being human
[1:25:55] he wanted a common suicide
[1:25:58] he said i can't face it
[1:26:04] you want to go grab that political wires
[1:26:06] on the pole
[1:26:07] and take his life
[1:26:11] so remember even a prophet can break
[1:26:14] down
[1:26:16] but god had a work for him to do he
[1:26:19] never allowed him to take his life
[1:26:22] see the crisis that's a lot of people
[1:26:25] come with suicide they can't take it
[1:26:26] they can't face it
[1:26:29] none of them see
[1:26:34] but god is our overcoming power
[1:26:37] amen we will say
[1:26:41] sometimes maybe somebody gets sick you
[1:26:43] want to blame somebody else
[1:26:46] don't blame somebody else
[1:26:50] then the bible tells us god puts us to
[1:26:52] test and trials
[1:26:55] to see what we'll do about it
[1:26:59] don't blame somebody else
[1:27:02] trust god god does things for his own
[1:27:06] glory
[1:27:07] like that man that was blind from birth
[1:27:10] jesus said to them
[1:27:11] this was done he was born like this so
[1:27:13] the glory of god can be seen
[1:27:17] so god allowed him to be born blind
[1:27:21] that he will receive israel healing and
[1:27:23] be a testimony
[1:27:24] and a witness for them around there
[1:27:27] because they came and questioned it
[1:27:28] who are you who healed you derek and
[1:27:30] jesus who is this jesus
[1:27:36] and jesus said no listen this man was
[1:27:38] born blind
[1:27:39] they thought oh his mother sinned and
[1:27:41] father sinned now you know
[1:27:42] he got afflicted she said christ is not
[1:27:45] because his personal sin no
[1:27:49] it was predestinated foreign
[1:27:54] that the works of god can be seen
[1:27:57] see so we go through some problems some
[1:28:00] sickness
[1:28:01] and then we get complaints from
[1:28:02] believers also now
[1:28:05] believers get sick maybe believers are
[1:28:08] praying believers are you know
[1:28:10] sometimes they visit them in hospital
[1:28:11] and the people are not praying for me
[1:28:14] and they're not phoning me you know the
[1:28:17] complaint makes it worse for them
[1:28:21] let's make it better people are praying
[1:28:26] see they say no those people are not
[1:28:28] praying for me and uh you know
[1:28:30] nobody's following me and encouraging me
[1:28:35] they're like babies
[1:28:39] but we must trust god ourselves
[1:28:43] even if somebody come and visit like
[1:28:45] jokes to be friends now
[1:28:47] was it any up to him no
[1:28:50] they came and spent time with him and
[1:28:52] everything else and
[1:28:53] you know never helped him
[1:28:57] so people are praying that he said oh
[1:29:00] the call from the pastor pastor is not
[1:29:03] coming
[1:29:05] see nobody is coming to visit us
[1:29:11] the complaining is going to make it
[1:29:13] worse for themselves
[1:29:16] that is the truth you just have faith
[1:29:20] and have the right attitude and right
[1:29:22] spirits
[1:29:25] and distrust god amen
[1:29:29] okay let's go a little further down here
[1:29:31] the bible says faith
[1:29:33] is a substance of things up for
[1:29:37] the evidence of things not seen
[1:29:40] faith is the substance of things
[1:29:44] up for the evidence not seen
[1:29:48] by this the elders received a great
[1:29:51] report
[1:29:53] you see alfred let them through
[1:29:57] amen see now we're not to them they're
[1:30:01] drawing back
[1:30:02] we are them they're pressing forward the
[1:30:06] bible talks about
[1:30:07] naomi and her two daughter-in-laws
[1:30:10] right and then
[1:30:13] the sons died their husband died now she
[1:30:17] was going back to bethlehem
[1:30:18] they had to go there because there was a
[1:30:20] famine she want to go back to her
[1:30:22] position
[1:30:25] she know she had land over there there's
[1:30:27] got to be somebody must redeem the land
[1:30:29] back
[1:30:31] and then she's coming back with a true
[1:30:32] daughter
[1:30:34] like opera or pha
[1:30:39] they she gave opportunity for them to go
[1:30:42] back
[1:30:44] open kiss the mother of goodbye said bye
[1:30:48] i'll break back the oppa means
[1:30:52] nick she was stiff-necked
[1:30:58] amen our stiffness
[1:31:03] another one when stephen was preaching
[1:31:05] there
[1:31:07] he said you stiff-necked you're
[1:31:10] unsacrified you're not
[1:31:12] you always resist the holy ghost
[1:31:27] and in that crisis of that time normie
[1:31:29] needed a friend
[1:31:33] she's going back without a husband
[1:31:35] without the two sons
[1:31:37] what a glorious thing root says i will
[1:31:40] never leave you
[1:31:41] amen i will go with you
[1:31:44] your god will be my god all that know me
[1:31:48] was she says i prefer to
[1:31:49] be part of it and luke means a friend
[1:31:54] and now when she came there she was in
[1:31:56] the field of poez
[1:31:59] huh i will sting the jewish harvest
[1:32:05] to help the jewish church alone for the
[1:32:08] jewish church to get into redemption you
[1:32:12] would be
[1:32:14] rude and gentile was helping out in the
[1:32:17] harvest field of wires
[1:32:21] amen to help normally the jewish church
[1:32:25] get back into redemption and the prophet
[1:32:28] said
[1:32:29] when this gospel is finished that
[1:32:31] gentile church
[1:32:32] will be there taking the gospel back to
[1:32:34] the jews
[1:32:36] and today lots of them have preached the
[1:32:39] gospel
[1:32:40] in jerusalem and the jewish churches are
[1:32:44] now christians there
[1:32:46] amen so rudnah was a gentile
[1:32:52] helping in the harvest of the jewish
[1:32:55] church
[1:32:57] and in that help there she got redeemed
[1:33:02] praise the lord and god blessed her so
[1:33:05] much
[1:33:06] that she threw to a great man of god
[1:33:11] that came after her
[1:33:14] why because she didn't turn back
[1:33:18] she pressed on with nobody
[1:33:21] so we are pressing on with the jewish
[1:33:23] church
[1:33:26] amen you know what the next president
[1:33:30] derek is running for president
[1:33:34] joe biden he's against the jews
[1:33:38] he's for the palestinians
[1:33:42] and anybody that comes against the jews
[1:33:45] god says there's no blessing but cases
[1:33:48] upon them
[1:33:50] and everything that trump is doing he
[1:33:52] says i'm going to reverse it
[1:33:56] trump brought me the moneys they're
[1:33:58] giving 400 million dollars a year i
[1:34:00] think
[1:34:00] to the world health organization stop it
[1:34:03] because
[1:34:04] they were signing with china about
[1:34:06] bringing the report about the virus
[1:34:09] so pilan says if you come into power the
[1:34:12] first day
[1:34:13] you will give the money back to them
[1:34:16] isn't it conflicting
[1:34:19] and he's against this uh uh
[1:34:24] the roadmap plan to peace he's looking
[1:34:27] for that
[1:34:29] and he's prepared to move out jerusalem
[1:34:32] back
[1:34:32] being the capital moving back out of
[1:34:35] there
[1:34:38] and the bible said jerusalem the king of
[1:34:40] salem
[1:34:41] is going to come and set up his kingdom
[1:34:42] there jerusalem
[1:34:45] king of salem amen amen
[1:34:50] so there's going to be a new evidence
[1:34:53] right there
[1:34:57] and he'll be the land
[1:35:03] the light the city will need no light
[1:35:07] the lamb is the light sitting right
[1:35:10] there in jerusalem
[1:35:12] the headquarters of god so we see all
[1:35:15] this conflicting thing coming up on here
[1:35:17] but some people want to pull back
[1:35:21] see we're coming here now people say oh
[1:35:23] you know so long now you know

[1:35:55] that day is coming are we looking
[1:35:56] forward
[1:35:58] are we watching and waiting and looking
[1:36:00] praying
[1:36:02] lord the rapture is going to come
[1:36:03] anybody where are we
[1:36:06] you know i'm waiting for jesus the king
[1:36:07] of israel
[1:36:09] where was nathaniel under the victory
[1:36:14] he was praying and meditating
[1:36:18] they're coming the first coming day he
[1:36:20] was praying and waiting
[1:36:22] amen and when they came to call him he
[1:36:25] says that then you'll come before the
[1:36:26] messiah
[1:36:30] so what was your name watching and
[1:36:32] waiting and praying
[1:36:35] and then you scared the messiahs here so
[1:36:38] we must literally doing that
[1:36:42] don't say no i know i'm scared of this
[1:36:44] violence and i'm staying at home i'm not
[1:36:46] doing the church
[1:36:47] and everything else and they're going to
[1:36:49] work and everything else
[1:36:50] it's more risky because they're going to
[1:36:52] the workmates and all they can get it
[1:36:54] and bring it home
[1:36:58] see so we want people coming back to
[1:37:00] church

[1:38:06] right time for the hampton to take place
