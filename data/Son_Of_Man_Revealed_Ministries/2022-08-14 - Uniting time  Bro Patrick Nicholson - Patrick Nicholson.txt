praise amen there is none like our god amen not in heaven none in earth you can even dig beneath the earth they already checked there was no one found worthy amen he's the king of kings and he's the lord of lords amen so we greet you and we welcome you into the house of the lord this morning amen certainly glare for the another privilege and an opportunity to come into the house of the lord to worship him amen and we ought to give thanks god daily for our lives because life is not guaranteed to anybody and every morning when we wake up we ought to thank the lord amen for another day of grace that we can serve his purpose on the earth amen so next week amen we want to have a little thanksgiving uh in the memorial of pastor ronnie he would have been 70 next week sunday the 21st of august amen so we'll have a little memorial and provide the lunch amen nation sunday so come prepared for that if you want to be a part of that you want to share somebody something a testimony a memory amen you can just let us know amen so everybody got that message next sunday amen for those of you who want to assist and help us the way you normally do you're more than welcome amen so many hands make light work amen let me say that again many hands make light work amen hallelujah so i'm making this announcement just because some believers have approached me already but nobody's obligated to do it so because pastor ronnie had been the church pastor of the church for 40 years some of the believers have already asked me if they can contribute towards the memorial amen towards the meals and whatever else is going to be prepared so we also don't want to let you miss that opportunity if you want to do that amen so you can contribute towards it you just mark it and you give it to uh amen to brother sebastian or brother sam amen i know participation is not going to be here next week he's actually going away on a 10-day holiday where you going brother where switzerland so he won't be here pray that lord will keep him safe traveling west he's there as well it's a nice holiday nice break for him amen so let's do our best that we can amen for us to serve us for 40 years amen we can do the best we can and uh just give honor and remember a life of ministry served to the lord amen and from that ministry there's other sons that have raised up amen other ministries that have raised up they're not only confined in this local church the other people out there preaching because of this ministry amen other people are fellowshipping the message churches because of the ministry that came here amen so i i certainly know that if pastor ronnie was here he definitely would have celebrated his 70th birthday you know how he loved his birthday amen so uh you want you want me to have people that celebrate well we're not celebrating the 70th we're doing a memorial amen because he's in a young body so he's in the youth the best body of his life amen so we trust him and everyone to cooperate with them amen so this morning we're happy to have with us my mom in grace they usually say in grace not in law and my daring law amen let's welcome you let's give them a hand amen hallelujah spend some time with us anticipating the arrival of the grandchild and uh it's an exciting time so we're not sure any day now amen no man not the day of the hour amen but the lord knows this one amen because life comes from god so we want to commit to even karen to the lord amen that the lord will amen have his way amen everything will go fine there's no complications amen if you can speak things before they happen amen so hallelujah is we happy to have them with us amen to spend this time with us and also to be gracious enough to come and share the word of the lord with us amen we know ministry is not just a plain thing amen it's a gift it's a calling and it's something amen shouldn't be taken lightly amen so we know amen that the minister would have studied and he would have sought the lord for a message for us so we come now and we do our part we draw from the minister amen we don't come to be entertained we don't come to watch amen what's the action what's the move but we pull on the gift amen something even the minister may not even have in his mind to say but you got pulling you and you can operate the gift amen and god can speak directly to your need this morning amen so without wasting uh much more time amen let's stand together even as we sing word of god ever true changing me and changing you it was the word of god that was sent in this hour amen that is going to bring about this change amen and now this is no ordinary word this is rapturing faith word amen a word to quicken our bodies amen let's sing and glorify his name amen hallelujah word of god ever true changing and changing you we have gone with open hearts [Music] changing you amen my question people [Music] god bless you you may be seasoned at this moment [Music] i certainly greet one and all in that lovely name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen it's certainly a wonderful protest to be back in the house of god this side of south africa and i'm certainly happy to be with the children the grandchildren and the trust that god will send the bless of saiyan as we await the new arrival amen so may god bless karen i think what i think i know um god help me if i forget uh it will be my wife's birthday tomorrow so we hope that the two births will kind of come inside so we trust that god will bless them and [Music] what a wonderful time season for especially pastor adrian and the first time that i'm preaching god in the east amen so may god certainly bless him just so trusted i couldn't make i couldn't make it but i believe that all things work together for the good to them that love the lord amen so i think adrian has just pulled me back out of retirement so if if i make a mistake behind the pulpit this afternoon today it's his fault amen so may god bless him and certainly happy to address the church in durban and also certainly miss our precious pastor ronnie that passed on and trust that the lord will certainly rest his body in peace until uh he comes back to uh greet us because that's a promise that god amen he's coming back again and we can say for sure but we will see him and it's not it's not him coming but it's us going hallelujah yeah so he's already made it and we also find ourselves like i was in a little bit of an accident i almost took my life wrote the bucky off but by god's grace i just walked out of that accident with a headache after two i could think the way that my head felt must have been both airbags it would not be amen so i trust that you keep on praying for me and god will give us grace and mercy and trust that everything that he's done is for the good amen amen doesn't matter what it is for the good amen that's not what happens to you and i believe that all things work together for the good to them that love the lord if you know that you love him remember doesn't matter how bad the situation seems it's for the good to them so i certainly want to bless you with a sermon this morning i trust that god will send me how much time do i have for the past savior it's not it's not covered so my wife reminded me she said it's two two-hour sun i have to stick to two hours what did you say the church is two hours okay sorry i trusted god was in the uh graces with his presence amen amen that's all we need nothing else and then trust that the lord will simply bless us as we stand [Music] chapter 11 [Music] and you can also keep your finger on the book of matthew chapter 16. now before we read the word of god let us despise it and close eyes heavenly father we approach thy most majestic throne of grace and mercy i believe that you are present because you promised where two or three are gathered in your name that you'll be the milk's father i pray that you'll chow us with your grace and your mercy i believe that all things are important because there's nothing out of order with you i believe that your blessings rest upon those that love your father and may you bless your word hide your sin behind the cross i pray that you'll bless from the janitor to the pulpit bless the pastor of this church lord our precious brother adrian may be with his precious wife give birth we pray for the mom the navy that shall keep them [Music] and that strongly healthy you will receive the glory and the honor of praise because it belongs to be alone bless everyone father god bless our children bless our moms our dads we also think in our precious system grace may have the mercy says god be with her also we ask that your blessings continue to be with the lord and make our minds settle our minds to know that you are the comforter yes lord there's nothing else we need all we need is jesus christ amen we bless the ministry lord bless the corpus leaders bless the musicians god bless the deacons the trustees the treasurer may everything father god as you've accepted the order for we know there's chaos out in this world and there's nothing no table clean and we pray father god that you come and wash our tables or our hearts may you put the sacrifice that we will place that sacrifice so that the fire can come down upon it consume our sacrifices lord that it will be well pleasing to thee bless your word and bless our servant and oh god may you make us humble if we will not have a proud look because we hate a proud big father and that's why we know that we are nothing it's all about your lord and we will point each and every member of the bride jesus christ as we give thanks unto your holy name amen god bless you as you just remain standing and the bible says in genesis chapter 11 and reading from this one the bible says and the whole earth was of one language and one speech and it shot and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east they found a plane in the land of chennai and it dwelt there and they said to one another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had bricked for stone and slime and they for mortar and they said go to let us hold us a city and a towel will stop may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth amen and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which a children of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do amen so we'll stop right there turn to the book of matthew chapter 16 and you also start from this one reading if you all have it the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he should show them a sign from heaven and the answer then said unto them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering ye hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and they shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonah and he left them and departed may god bless the reading of his will you may be seated this morning so [Music] if i can maybe just have a request may i change the bottles around i haven't used this one so i just need a warmer bottle thank you now i've got a title um uniting time yeah so try to keep it simple and straightforward so maybe dive here and there we dive in and come back up get some breath and try to just float on top and then so once in a while take a dive again so we trust that we'll just keep your thinking kept your spiritual thinking caps on and trust in god will certainly lesser snow we [Music] trust that you are all comfortable those that i don't know by name i trust that god will certainly bless you because i feel honored to speak to you amen from a scriptural message standpoint and i trust that god will certainly give us grace and our understanding will be enlightened by what i have to say and that you'll be more confused than you got enlightened by god's grace so i believe that god is not as complicated as we make him not to be because he makes everything so simple that a child will understand what message is all about what these scriptures are all about amen because it's written that he reveals his secrets amen not only to his prophets but he reveals it to babes such people that gets the message from the scriptures but it's fishermen his mechanics housewives and students so i was a student myself when i came into the message in grade 10 so and i didn't have an understanding of the message all i knew was that i wanted to be saved that was what mattered to me i didn't grow up in the message and i grew up in the world i was reading this morning and i saw a name by the uh pat tyler and i was wondering how who's respect tyler because brother brown constantly called his name asked him to read the bible and calling a friend and i realized that i was listening to a message and i thought well this is basically the message that i should be preaching because brother branham said isn't that so brother pat and i said well that's a message then i'm going to have to preach this morning that's why i looked him up and i saw that he was a tyler who was a gangster that was converted as a former gangster and uh god brought him into the message so it doesn't matter who you are amen god has got a place for you amen in his economy and i trust that god will certainly give us grace i was never in a church i always wanted to find myself going to a church but i was more like on the sporting field trying to do what the world does but by god's grace he turned me around he set my foot upon a rock amen hallelujah and here i am today knowing that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and everything that i wanted to do i did by god's grace and that was storming first in my heart that i wanted to be a son of god amen i would have been about four maybe five six six years old and somebody asked me are you going to heaven i said i don't know [Music] and that question stuck with me for years and years until i was about 17 years old he said i could give my life to the lord i want to find jesus in my heart and not knowing parents didn't go to church one was the seventh-day adventist the other one was a union congregationalist and we didn't know what church to go to catholic seven days adventures and uh by god's grace the message came away and saw the cloud amen my cousin told me that he's seven angels hallelujah and today i can see those angels right there in the cloud people can't see it amen they said it's a rocket hallelujah but to me it's jesus christ out there amen that's him nothing else so i certainly am happy to know that uh what doesn't mean anything to the world means more to me than life when i look at the cloud i look at the pillar of fire over the property in the picture that was taken people will kind of reject that and that's why my subject this morning included in my title uniting time and my subject is the rejected one amen if you've never been rejected you won't grow amen there needs to come a rejection if you ever asked at school to take a girl out and she said no you feel kind of rejected amen and you don't know where to put your head you don't know what to do i was in survey raid 1 they would call it and we were all sitting around this beautiful girl amen and everybody was asking do you like me and do you like me and she said yes yes and when it came to me she said no so i kind of thought well you kind of learn you know how to handle those things it stuck with me for a while but you kind of sort of think well these things happen in life and that you need to be pushed one side and then jesus came on this earth and he was the rejected one nobody else like he could be rejected did nothing the god of heaven and earth he created all things but he was the reject one so who are we a man to escape being rejected and we feel down that we failed maybe a grade or we failed out you know to get a job or to be top of the class or to do any little thing and be rejected and then you find it builds character once you find yourself in those places it builds character so i just want to share a few quotations with you nothing that you don't know and i trust that god will certainly bless you and we look at the scriptures and i would like to share some uh things maybe historical issues with regard to the seals like i said it will just be a short piece to share with you and i think it blessed me and i believe it will bless you now we find that the bible says in the book of luke i'd like to maybe read it there also and then we can have the sunday school teaching now he said beware of the 11 of the pharisees which is hypocrisy verse 11 it's his amen so for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed now think about the seals think about the thunders think about adoption think about the baptism of the holy ghost think about all these things water baptism all covered based on the fact that we were we were clothed over we were veiled from the apostolic message that came on the day of pentecost on about 120 amen and the bible is not exact on that outpouring of how many received it and he said it's about 120 people and we find that since then 3000 and then azusa street ended up with a lot of holy spirit coming down upon people in measure so we find that we didn't know what it means to be baptized in water and what the correct formula was yes but god by his grace came with revelation chapter 10 and verse 7 and said but in the days of the voice amen so there had to come a voice today to reveal the mystery of god amen so it was a mystery and the mysteries the prophet would say it is the reason why we don't know the mysteries is because we are not taught the mystery and then sometimes we find that pastors will have a kind of a mystery and the people would just be hanging there like thunders or adoption uh big words like those amen and it's as simple as it sounds because the bible tells us that the thunder is the voice of god amen it's as simple as that you don't have to kind of like when he was on mount transfiguration some said they thundered and others heard yeah from different avenues the way they were listening at this sound there were at least two people that got the different revelation of what happened on non-transfiguration so he what do you hear today yeah him jesus or hear he the evangelist or hear the pastor what he's got to say or is it what god has got to say that's the bottom line amen amen in any company if you can't get the bottom line sorted out then you're going to become bankrupt hallelujah so get the bottom line straight enough to know that you are profitable yes amen not with the f but the ph in the center profitable there there has to be someone on the scene today in the amount of confusion that's happening we have to find ourselves profitable amen there has to be eyes because remember all movement in the body is below from the eye and down all movement amen anything above the eye there's no movement hallelujah you can maybe cause some wrinkles but that's all you're going to get a man above the eye but every movement is below the eye and when the eyes come you find that the eyes speak our prophet amen and if you don't have a prophet you are blind and that's why this age they've got all kinds of ministries they've got all ministries to kind of build the church to get the funds in to get out there and get the crowds in amen but there's no i because the bible has prophesied god is prophesied they will be rich increased in goods there will be people that will be uh heady high-minded amen lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god and who's god the word amen they don't care about the word the word doesn't matter to them no more but there's a people in the land that's got eyes to see amen back and forward presently hallelujah because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the unchanging god amen and that's why we have to look how what are we united to what are we up against when we look at the circumstances in this world who are we going to believe are we going to take god at his word or are we going to take what man says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven amen and who is my father in heaven it's the holy ghost amen amen nothing less nothing more he is this great spirit that created heavens and earth amen amen before jesus the body set his foot on the stone the father was there amen and that's why isaiah could say about this what the catholic people will call the eternal son but yet comes the eye and he says there's no such a thing amen as an eternal sign yes amen because the sun at the beginning and the sun would have an end and that confused me quite a lot because we are sons so if we are not eternal what are we but we are speaking of that logos that went out of god amen we are talking about that son being eternal because if that son is eternal then we believe in the trinity we believe in a father person a some person and a holy ghost person but the bible declares that the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost is the lord jesus christ amen so that was made visible to us in our minds in our hearts that revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he unites us back to the lord jesus christ and back to the apostolic father because remember we were baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in three persons and calling titles names amen but we find that the name of those titles belong to the eternal god amen hallelujah it's the lord jesus christ now after the voice has spoken and revealed the mystery of god which is the lord jesus christ we find that this son now meets paul on his way to damascus and he said i am jesus hallelujah so that means this jesus is no longer that son that came from mary amen in her home he is now back as isaiah said the son shall be the everlasting father oh my you see you can't take one scripture and make it work you have to get the whole puzzle together otherwise the car will be eating grass right on the top of the tree hey man bring the cow back amen back under the ground back on his four feet amen and doesn't matter how nicely it fits you all of us had a puzzle to complete and you find that some pieces fit amen but the picture doesn't match amen hallelujah so when jesus said i am hallelujah jesus paul recognized that elohim amen jehovah jireh is jesus wow he found his face amen amen lord yahweh who are down and when yahweh said on jesus he got the revelation amen jesus the god of the old testament is the jesus now you might not find that a scripture written but it's the revelation amen the god of the old testament is the jesus of the new amen oh wow so we thank god without the eyes now you would think now here's two uh elijah two elijahs there was going to be five elijahs altogether amen and when you share the word elijah you just find here's a man the original elijah he comes from nowhere and he rebukes this jezebel and ahab when you come from no mother no father that's identified in scripture but it's just elijah but he had the spirit of god upon him so when you hear the word elijah just think about that it's not a man but it's the spirit of god in a man amen hallelujah so that's why the spirit of elijah is used five times amen because it's god speaking yes it's not a man it's not like we would think it's a prophet so here comes uh malachi and he promises that there'll be elijah turning the hearts of the fathers of the law to the apostolic or rather pentecostal children yes amen so there was the law fathers and they needed to change their hearts to what jesus was giving amen he was giving the holy ghost and we needed to receive the holy ghost and only the apostolic the children amen would get the holy spirit so there we find that when john came on the scene he was already united in flesh to jesus he was jesus cousin in other words [Music] elizabeth and mary they were cousins so that made them second cousins according to the flesh what we would know but we know that jesus was no flesh he was created amen and self yes oh yes there was nothing human about jesus but he was all human amen oh my so we find that elijah was now being promised that he would turn the law of the jewish fathers to these pentecostal children amen and then when the pentecostal children moved on we find that the gentiles started coming in because remember peter was sent to the jews and paul was a missionary or an apostle to the gentiles because they rejected the message of paul and he said i turned to the gentiles yes amen and that's us amen so when you turn to the gentiles here comes a bright tree being formed and when the bride tree was formed we find that here were seven messengers seven voices seven angels earthly angels not the ones with the wings but a messenger and an angel is one in the same thing as far as a man is concerned he's sent to us yes he's a saint one he's a missionary and that's why you find in the message that there's so many apostles great men that call themselves apostles because they want to be the top of the food chain they want to be above the pasta and the prophet says there's no one above the elder right yes amen there's nothing above the elder if you want to be an apostle and come and sit here as an apostle and think that you're about the pastor get out because you don't belong sorry to put you out i don't know who you are but that's the crux of the matter there's nothing above the pastors and that's why these men that's calling themselves apostles they make themselves above the past amen because of advantage you find that these men are usurping authority over god's other and that never happened in church not in the apostolic church not today because he's the same god amen so we have to realize what an apostle is an apostle is united in the body by the holy ghost because remember gifts and callings are without repentance you don't have to repent to be an apostle you don't have to repent to be a pastor amen amen there are pastors today behind the pulpit without the holy ghost now that is a very hard statement to pay man but that's the truth of the matter because you can be gifted but without the holy man that is why you have to be united to the head amen and the only way to be united to the head is to receive the holy ghost amen [Music] and that's why when you look back in the book of genesis these people the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and once that happens you get away from god absolutely when a board united in a church against a pastor that church is dead there's nothing left of it amen when the people comes against the pastor the church is dead when the pastor comes against the people there's nothing left of them because they are not united yes amen amen you have to unite like two donkeys trying to get to food and they both tied together but you find that there's a bundle of hay and here's a bundle of hay and the rope is not enough for them to feed both right amen so the rope has to they have to come to a decision to first eat the one side and then go to the other side amen and both of them as they feast together we'll get half of this and half of that which will be a half plus a half peace one amen oh my united time it's time to be united in in that sense where if we are not we are divided yes and a divided house will not stand amen so here you find that the elijah turning the hearts to the children is to the pentecostal and then the same scripture says at the heart of the children to the fathers now we would say apostolic fathers we say yes but what kind of a children are we for our hearts to be turned that means we are lost in darkness because why would our hearts be turned in amen so that means ad325 the nice saying fathers said we'll take titles instead of the name and when they took titles we became the children of the nicene fathers that's true and somebody said amen amen when that happened there had to come a messenger to turn our hearts back amen yes pastorizing fathers back to the apostolic now they're not children anymore they're now the fathers yes they were children yes when they were the law fathers but when they 2 000 years went on the children became the fathers and these nice in children we were baptizing in the name of father son and holy ghost but revelation 10 7 comes and he says lord jesus christ now i want to say this anyone today that's not baptized according to the formula of matthew chapter 28 and verse 19 which says the name of the father son and holy ghost is lord jesus christ you will not be united with the head what does that mean brother pat that means you won't receive the holy ghost you say why does it matter brother pat because it mattered to paul in acts chapter 19 he met a bunch of doctors converted by john but they were preaching christ remember they were preaching what elijah was preaching elijah was john because jesus identified john and he said this is the elias that you come yes amen hallelujah and when this elias came then you're not but he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the unbelief of the world yes amen so then jesus identified john as the liars of malachi chapter 4 the first part but the second part was identified by the holy ghost himself now where's the holy ghost today the holy ghost is the bride you can't find it anywhere else amen amen how do you get into the bride by being baptized by being born again yes and the new birth is two phases in other words you are entering in and you are seen and the bible jesus said to nicodemus he said to be born again you must be born of water yes yes and of spirit yes those two phases happens with the new birth but now watch what happens and he says now unless you are born of water which means you've got to be baptized to signify that you are starting the new birth hallelujah like a baby is born in water before it's born yes right on the outside it's there waiting in water being shaped receiving its organs it's bones it's toes it's all kinds of uh elements that's being added to that baby to be united with his spirit hallelujah oh my so now you find that when this child is born of water there must be a formula yes amen hallelujah without the formula you are not going anywhere john comes and he says unto repentance hallelujah and everybody says well john is baptizing now and here jesus comes and the bible said jesus was not baptizing but his disciples were doing the baptism but here was jesus and his group baptizing and john and his group baptizing but here comes paul and paul says unto what were you baptized they said we were baptized unto john can you see how important what a baptism is it's for the new birth it's for god accepting you so that you can be entered into the body that you can be united with jesus christ amen so anyone that's baptized in the name of jesus christ you must be baptized over because the correct formula is lord jesus christ amen amen anyone that's baptized in the name of jesus must be baptized over because the correct formula is lord jesus christ because the mystery of god is revealed yes yes who the father son and all you go see do you see how simple it is but yet so powerful and if you reject that you're not going anywhere but to the tribulation because all those that's got the holy ghost goes in the rapture amen those without the holy ghost you can be you can have faith you can avert you you can have knowledge you can have temperance you can have brotherly kindness you can have all those virtues but you have not been accepted because god accepts your faith when he sees you are obedient amen if you're not obedient he won't accept your faith and that's why when we look at people that were baptized in the name of father son and holy ghost luther baptized like that but he was obedient to the revelation he received it was not it was not the mystery of god was not revealed to them like it's today for us the responsibility for us is that if much is given much is required hallelujah there's not a greater message to reach this other than the one malachi chapter four to turn our hearts back to the episode away from the nights and fathers away from titles back to the name amen back to life back [Music] baptized on the elijah and he said have you received the holy ghost since you believed have you been in the message you haven't received the holy ghost yet how were you baptized hallelujah they said well we don't know about any holy ghost and he says well how were you baptized he said well we were baptized according to john's baptism he said but you're preaching christ you baptist but you're preaching christ and he recognized the formula for baptism was wrong yes and then paul said come let's baptize you and look right and he says paul baptized them in the name of the lord jesus amen didn't say lord jesus christ but when peter baptizes luke writes jesus christ so look knew exactly what the name of the father son and holy ghost is because why would he leave out christ in luke 19 or acts chapter 19 and leave out lord in acts chapter two he knew what the name of father son and holy ghost is so why would paul now do something different than matthew 28 19's instruction by jesus christ he wouldn't and that's why god accepts your faith and he gives you the holy ghost amen that's why you have to work your faith add to your faith virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and when god sees those things that you have worked your faith he gives you in other words he accepts your faith amen hallelujah so let those things stand out in your life let there be the foundation the rock that god gave you faith and now for you to be united with the head hallelujah not everybody wants to be united with the head but they forget about the cap and i'm going to tell you what the cap is the cap is for the individual amen everyone gets the holy spirit while you're in this life if you are predestinated to me but the whole church from paul to this day gets the headstone can you get it separated now the cat is for the individual it's the holy ghost we receive the holy ghost in measure don't tell me that you've got the fullness of the holy ghost like jesus had it no you'll never get it like that you'll get it like those on the day of pentecost when god separated himself and united himself with 120 and filled them because of the obedience going to the upper room have you gone to the upper room yet have you received the experience and don't think that everybody is going to get the same experience no but everybody will get the holy spirit but your experience will be maybe on your knees in front here or you'll be sitting with your [Music] hand in your head or in your face at the back there hey man or you'll come running from the back to the front and run out there and run back and all around doesn't matter how you receive it as long as you receive it amen that's the bottom line that's when the profit or the or the profitability comes in when you receive that what god says it's not only for you but to your children amen and to them that's far off even as many as the lord your god your call i trust you are happy amen anybody sleeping not yet amen so i'm just teaching i'm not trying to preach here today so i'll try to preach some other time maybe in another two years i've been here last time two years ago hallelujah so i trust that god will certainly give us grace but i want to keep it as simple as possible so that you can understand that those two prophets were the elijah prophets and you know what jesus said of elias he said no man born of women greater than john yeah hallelujah so now here's the word where's the word today in the bride what was the bride or what does the word say of elias for today no one born of women greater than william brandon you can say that with me amen no man i don't care who comes man is not if joseph branham or bulletpole uh whoever he might be he cannot be another one outside of william bradley amen amen it's not possible yes right because jesus said of his elijah no man greater and the word will say the same thing about her eli because he said his forerunning is coming amen when the son of man is revealed hallelujah we find that the son of man was revealed in a son of man to show forth the bride of the group amen why he was the elijah he was the friend of the group that's why he never pointed to himself he didn't say i'm the one he said no i'm pointing you to jesus christ [Music] so anyone pointing to himself hallelujah is of the devil you can't point to yourself because that's what lucifer did in heaven he pointed to himself and when he pointed to himself there was one third angels that went with him because he was pointing to himself they fell by the lie of lucifer now lucifer was just not an angel you think that he might be a devil looking like with horns no he was a light bearer he was a minister hallelujah he could do any kind of thing he was a song leader he could preach he could do anything but then he pointed to himself when he pointed to himself he took a third of the church hallelujah the whole church in heaven a third of that those are that's some millions and millions of people hallelujah that lucifer and that's why it's so hard for them to send them to hell yet because there are so many on this earth today because they fell you can't send a demon to hell you can only cast him up hell is not open yet hell is right here on this earth where those demon powers are causing all kinds of diseases cancer tuberculosis and that's why i'm saying today doesn't matter what kind of a disease you have might be eye trouble stomach trouble foot trouble matters not by the preaching of the word by your pastor and every minister the demons are cast out in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen remember when you walk out there that spirit has left you you cannot say that you came in and walked out with the same demon that you came in because we have the authority by the word of god we are united with thus saith the lord when you walk in you go home free for whom the son is set free he's free indeed when you're coming with t.v you god without that we cast it out in the your power which you have none because jesus christ died on calvary he set you free amen and who the son has set free he is free indeed be united to his word that by his stripes i'm healed by every power that jesus had by his word that these sons shall follow them that believe and will ever believe you can be free now [Music] you have no right to be [Music] do you feel free amen oh i yes felt inspired to say those words that we are united with the word many other afflictions of the righteous amen but the lord he delivers them out of all [Music] you don't have to be a liar no more you don't have to be an adulterer you don't have to smoke a cigarette in your life i don't care how many times you've tried to give it up god is here to cast out those spirits upon you and say go home and be free my son and my daughter hallelujah amen amen it's time to tell the devil where to get off yes amen this ticket has done this right amen it's time to get off satan get off from the children of god get off so that they can have a free reign a free ride hallelujah he's bought the ticket for them they got out and they are not getting off the only one that must get off is use satan now not in another minute not in the next day now in jesus name in the name of the lord jesus christ you're a had heart trouble spine trouble we had diabetes in the house we have eye trouble in the house when we lay in our beds the bible says pray every hour hallelujah when you open your eyes you are praying you say leave my child leave my son leave my daughter hallelujah leave this house and say this house oh my god in the name of jesus christ i just can't get away from that because i feel in victory in christ i feel you have the victory raise your hand that came in sick and you know that there's nothing [Music] hallelujah so let's be in one accord let's have one voice because we are unstoppable hallelujah nothing stands in our way yes not this amen not sickness not a virus we've got a new virus coming out from china made in china hallelujah it's they call it levy uh acronym or a short form of this lay big kind of a virus and they found it in an animal called the shrew and the shoe is packing this virus and they don't know how it got to the humans in china but they say it's not highly transmissible you find that they can just press a button now and close our church they can press a button and keep their past at home and they can just spray a few biological weapons that's what the virus is all about biological warfare so it's about time that we have a spiritual warfare it's smaller than those biological weapons amen but it's more powerful it's greater he that's in you he's greater and more powerful than he that's in china than he that's in russia that he that's in the united states of the soviet socialist republic amen who are the united states the bride amen who is the united states united against the bride hallelujah they rejected the prophet why because they had the truth of the word of god amen he had thus saith the lord and he spoke to the jezebels of this age oh yes and he said to the herots or where the king was and he said you are not supposed to have that horn it's your brother's son marriage of divorce water baptism communion all kinds of things john the baptist was united to the headstone when from his mother's world wow hallelujah we don't hear that ever happening because the law and the prophets was until john after that it's the new birth can somebody say amen after john eats the new birth what happened to william branham he had to be born again hallelujah before god could use him before he could strengthen his brethren he had to go to the upper room where his upper room was amen you know where you drop the room on your knees you want to go up you have to go down [Applause] remember be good to everyone on your way up because you'll be sure to meet them on your way down amen hallelujah even satan will be there to meet you because pride takes you up but god takes you down amen and when you go down hallelujah you don't look either not when you look down you see the kingdom hallelujah because from your knees you'll go to the water from the water you'll have faith faith like enoch enoch had such a friend that he was so united to god that he was not because god took him amen he was united amen so much so that this world couldn't hold him no more right just imagine we call it gravity gravity lust is hold on enoch a flesh man hey you and i we are flesh man no the sister would say well i'm not a man the bible says you are a man he said god created man so ultimately amen you are a man but he divided man and he said male and female created you then hallelujah so sister there's no schism in the body of christ everyone receives the holy ghost and the holy ghost will lead you into all truth what you have to do with your gift in the body of christ matters not if you're a housewife or a mechanic or a doctor or a nurse or just a student you are in the economy of god by the baptism of the holy ghost god accepted your faith after you add it to your faith faith without works is dead dead hallelujah come alive and say hello life in christ because i'm united to the word of god amen i'm so sorry for screaming oh but praise god i hope i hope it gets through to you yeah god i've only got 15 minutes left faster i hope i can make it so we know who the two elijahs was one was john for the jews and to fought for jesus who came to his own and he told peter don't go to the gentiles go to the jews jesus saying that why he was a jealous god and he said don't you touch my bride yet hallelujah i've got a messenger that's going to you know what happened paul rebuking peter because he being holy ghost's fault amen a man with a holy ghost did you know that god said grieve now not the holy ghost whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption amen so that means if god says don't eat that means you can eat if god says grieve not that means you can grieve otherwise why would he say that grieve nor not the holy ghost whereby you are sealed you are sealed but you can grieve you are married but you can commit adultery hey did you know you can commit adultery after being married yes [Music] it's possible so grieve now not the holy ghost whereby you were sealed until the day of redemption why because you are still in a body of flesh amen and then you'll call it a mistake after willfully you won't do it willfully when you have the holy spirit because now your mistakes are grieving god you're making too many mistakes and then making too many mistakes means that you are willfully doing what you are doing and i'm saying by the grace of god in my spirit grieve you ministers you laity members you trustees and deacons grieve now not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your death you are united to christ but yet you can grieve him because remember when you make that mistake i'm saying it like that because it's a mistake you make you don't mean to do that you don't mean to look at that nakedness you don't mean to lie at that moment to cover your skin you don't mean to run a red light you don't mean to not stop at the stop stream amen fear takes you beyond what you believe sometimes you know you know what you have to believe but your fear takes you beyond your faith because when your faith goes this way fear takes you that way oh i'm scared i'm fearful so what does it happen when you have cancer the doctor declares you've got cancer your faith takes you past that cancer but your fear will bring it back you've been prayed for you've been anointed nothing can happen against you it's your fear and that's why even the doctors as unbelieving as they are so many of them will tell you to be positive what does that mean perfect positive the prophet says don't ever be negative in your testimony because it will take you down yes it will kill you to make you sick again it will be worse for you than the previous time that you were single are you happy can you say amen can everybody say amen can i get a sister say amen god bless you amen means so be remember you are healed that little headache you had you are healed don't worry about it amen stop eating too much sweets hallelujah it's as simple as that hey man high blood pressure comes from too much sugar not too much salt dr patrick spoke god bless you the disclaimer says i'm not a doctor hallelujah so he is the great physician yes you are what you eat amen you're a christian because of what you eat and you don't get a good christian oh i'm a good christian or a bad christian you're a bad christian you don't get a good and a bad christian it's just christian hallelujah ever seen a good thing and a bad pig no it's just a pig hallelujah pig pig go there you never say how good pig come here go away no pig that's the same with christian there's nothing higher than being a christian that's the highest order that you can ever be is to be a christian amen i feel anointed when i say those words higher than a christian you cannot be you want to be a minister it's lower than a christian paul said there's nothing about me that i should boast and he said three times i've asked god to take this phone out of my flesh and three times he said my grace it or leave it paul my grace is sufficient so matters not in what uh sphere i am where i find myself i'm content with what god said and god said my grace is sufficient and paul says i glory in my infirmities oh why do you want to be blind crippled what do you want something where the devil has got he's got you gripped he's got you by the throat there's nothing you can do about it what do you want after after you've got what prophet would say satan has got one blow one punch coming your way amen now satan has got a hard hand he doesn't come lightly to you why go lightly and face him you have to train and exercise how to get the licks of satan hey man away from you amen hallelujah when i was young i used to box every day of my life at school i used i had to keep off my enemies because every enemy that saw me want to do hallelujah and that's the devil he wants to fight every bit of the way but you have to keep your god up have on the helmet of salvation amen that's where you have to find yourself because it's gonna rain upon you not little pebbles it's gonna rock so rocks will rain on you that's why you need a helmet and the bible says it's a helmet of salvation i'm saved hallelujah amen have on the breastplate of righteousness what's the breastplate when you look at the priest he's got all the stones 12 stones on his breastplate and when the holy spirit comes upon those stones it sparkles and he says you're our accepted son you're an accepted priest you are a king and a priest and when god flashes his lighter on you the enemy sees that and he backs off because god has accepted his priest and his king you are a king sister you're a priest sister did you know that amen you you're in the priesthood by the baptism nobody can take that away from you you don't have to preach your very walk is a sermon the way you talk is a silence your children recognize you that you are praised in the kingdom of god united with the son of god and there's nothing they can say against you because you know who you are you know where you come from and you know where you're going to because the bible says we are not blind that we can see who our make and creator is lord jesus amen he's not the third person hallelujah i'm so happy i promise you that we are going to not be too long let's read this quote behold i send my messenger before thy face we shall prepare thy way before thee very i say unto you among them that are born of women they are not risen or greater than john the baptist not withstanding amen he that is the least in the kingdom just a brother student the least in the kingdom is greater than he amen john you're so great but there's somebody in the benches here that's sitting here that's greater than john hallelujah you are greater than john because you still esteem yourself the least in the kingdom but you are in the kingdom how do you get in the kingdom on the baptism of the holy ghost how did you get the holy ghost because god accepted your faith that you added to virgin knowledge temple inspirations etc etc when god sees your faith working he accepts you and he kept you hallelujah when you go to university you are capped after you have done what you had to do you have passed this you have gone through that you are you are temperamental amen but then god comes with temperance you know what temperance is i've said this once before temperance is when you have this uh especially on the side of the cars you find that it's shatter proof in the front and it's it's it's not shatterproof but it's armor plate on the side how shatterproof is that when you hit a stone against it because of the plastic between two pieces of glass it will just shatter and it will crack this way and crack that way this way that way depending on where the crack leads but with armor plate on the side of the car especially at the back you find other plate cannot be you can't heat it with your fist and sometimes you throw a brick against it the brick bounces back you find many times where people want to rob you in the street like a traffic light they will throw a brick against the armor plate and it will just bounce back into their face and they're thinking about what's happening with this glass it's glass no it's not it's tempered tempered glass means that there's a force that brings a glass together to the extent the heat that it goes through it tempers the glass hey man it becomes tempered in a sense that when you heat it with a sharp object you break the temperance of the glass and the whole glass every bead will shatter through the glass and every inch of the glass will have a little crack and a bead that when you push your finger through that window it will just it will just start to break because the temperance of that glass has now been released it was kept together how is how are you kept together by the word of god heat you are treated with hate with fire and the holy ghost it tempers you and that's what temperance in the pyramid means that the prophet drew you are tempered by the word of god and then when anything strikes you you just hold your temple you are tempted nothing goes against it amen let the enemy throw a stone it can't penetrate that because it's tempted when your wife angers you you are tempered you don't shatter when your husband comes against you why are you going to church again this morning you've been to church so many times watch that you were holier than loud then your temper holds you can't shatter by your husband's temperament or your wife's temper or your child or your teacher or your boss nothing shatters your temper because you are put together piece by piece heat treated put together and you are tempted by the holy spirit fire and the holy ghost same thing amen the holy ghost and fire tempest you together amen you are sealed by the holy ghost until the world ends god don't see me today to lose you tomorrow and that's why i'm going to skip many things much is known about the seals on roman wolves when you have anybody have a world you know what a world is it gets a notoriety stamp and it says this notoriety lawyer from pronouncing it right has said that whatever oath is inside this world is sealed with a stair i've heard what he has to say he's agreed solemnly to the oath and i place my sail upon this it's settled and whoever reads it has to perform the words written there oh my god it's only saying that my amen i just press my knot away [Music] so let's let's see what the seals are all about amen now remember what the prophet says about the seals he says that the seventh long closing amen so give me about 10 minutes it's only 11 53 now i know the prophet says that the seventh seal now listen carefully before you say amen it's not open hallelujah but then we see that the prophet himself says that the seventh cell is the coming of the lord oh yes so now has he come now remember what many people are doing in the message they said he has come and that means we listen to the book of corinthians where paul says when he has come we do we do the communion until he comes so if he has come then we don't have to do communion no more so as long as you are having communion you are saying he hasn't come but you have to be careful when you start to say he hasn't come when he has gone amen and don't say uh he's come and is gone because if he's come we must see him corporally do you know that we must see jesus corporally amen when he comes yes he's not coming as the holy spirit he's coming as a man a human being like he made himself known to the disciples he says handle me hallelujah and that's the way we will handle jesus when he comes the second time for the bride we are not talking for the world now because he will identify himself he will unite himself to the jews but listen to this he has come for the bride as the son of man now we have to identify where the son of man appeared he appeared in a son of man which was a son of man means prophet the son of man is holy ghost the son of god amen because that's how he could only come with this prophet he could come as the holy ghost he couldn't come any other way because that's what he promised he came as the son of god as the son of man why because he discerned the hearts the intents of the hearts of the people the same way jesus as the son of man identified himself to the samaritan woman who were samaritans and to the jews when he said before you were under the fig tree i saw you amen he said thou art the son of god but there he was in flesh and he was called by nathaniel the son of god god the son of god and we find that when the samaritan woman identified him and he said of the prophet he said you know our father's worshipped here and are you are you greater than jacob he said you know the time is going to come when two worshipers will not worship me uh here in this in this place but they will worship me in spirit and truth amen because god seeks such to worship people spirit and truth don't worship him because you're just a christian call yourself christian church church member amen uh pastor adrian he's my pastor no what about you [Music] pastor adrian has got the holy ghost you all believe that what about you hey man you're just not a christian you're sitting a few you're a priest you have to exercise your priesthood out there and out there everywhere you are you have to shine the light where it's dark amen hallelujah so we find ourselves in that state where son of man is revealed the son of man is revealed as the holy ghost in a prophet and he comes he said your name is such and such and such and such you live in such and such go home and be healed in the name of the lord jesus christ go home and do well hallelujah what was that it was the former rain falling with the latter rain remember there's a promise coming the latter rain and the former rain will fall together now we said we're gonna dive sometime so we're diving now keep on the spiritual thinking camp don't sleep now did somebody say amen amen can you say that again amen can you say it one more time amen hallelujah so now we find that the son of man was being revealed in a prophet because it was promised that the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of god is revealed so here was the mystery of god on a platform in a prophet coming and he said you know he's standing about a few feet away from me hallelujah now the angel was there and all of a sudden there's a light and he said you your brother your name is so-and-so you've got on the left side of your lung uh the doctor was looking at it through this that in the other and thus saith the lord go home and be well what was that former rain falling now it was falling together he was doing the discernment and he was telling him you are healed lettering the former and the lettering falling together glory to god so you was the son of man revealing himself he has come and he's coming so we don't stop communion because we know he's coming in a corporate body but he was here as he said now what does the bride say about william branham no man born of human greater than william branham but the least in the kingdom is greater than he so there we have it former and literary folly together he has come the seventh seal is open and when it opens when a woman gives birth it just closes to the public the public doesn't see it but you are sealed in they ask you allowed as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man when they were eating and drinking they didn't see the rain come but no before one dropped foul saw the rain come and he said it's gonna rain it's going to rain hallelujah we are going up beyond the friends we are going in the rapture although i'm dead my body might be death i'm going to be resurrected in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah it's not going to be a wink a wink is when you know you're sitting across a table and you see this nice guy on the other side and he winks at you you know like like that our man and you blush but you know there won't be time to blush when he comes amen it's not going to be a wink it's going to it's going to be a twinkle hallelujah a twinkle is so fast that you can see movement you can stop movement hey man if you have a twinkle that a fan blowing in your room and you twinkle at that fan it looks like the fan kind of stops in the moment and life on this earth will stop in a moment when you twinkle yourself out of this world in a moment in the twinkling of an eye your body is change hallelujah and i believe when this body changes you can eat anything you want to you can create a mcdonald's burger if you want to you can create a kentucky fried chicken doesn't matter what 12 herbs and spices hallelujah so that means you are now that creator like god you are a head amen and that's why now we can create another world but god has got laws in place that you can't do what you want to do but you know you can amen that's why we can exercise our faith on when the enemy comes in like a flood the standard which is you sister which is you brother which is your preacher the standard of god is raised up against it so be against the power of the devil and satan come out and leave this house leave this video leave this bathroom leave [Music] and your thing you know what god is saying amen that's why god says don't be afraid when they take you to the judges in the courts but just speak amen because only you speaking it will be the holy ghost you will have words that they won't even be able to understand how do they get this word this unlearned man doesn't have anything in his name he's never been a day in school but yet when he speaks we just have to listen we can't again say what he says because he's saying what god is speaking amen oh yes so now we see these seals all the seals has been opened but it will be close to a lot of people the reason why is because of the unbelief the ark was closed to many people because of the unbelief but there were animals that went in some animals couldn't go in because they didn't believe there were some people that didn't go in because they didn't believe and when the door was shut they wanted to come in afterwards but then afterwards means that tribulation is setting the rain is starting to fall and that's what happens with you outside the holy ghost outside the bride of christ you go to the tribulation so that you can get the fire on you so that you can sleep for a thousand years come up in the judgment the judgment throne and then you'll be separated as a sheep or a goat and depart from me you workers of iniquity on the left you goat but to you sheep enter in the joys of the lord amen amen now where did they get to joy when they died with their own blood in the tribulation because they rejected the holy ghost they rejected the life in the blood this side so they had to cross over and go into the tribulation die with their own blood come up pass the millennium in the judgment seat and then be counted as a sheep where's the bride sitting in the throne of justice [Music] and the eyes of the lamb is right around it you can't escape me i know what you've done to me i've known what you've done to my wife i know what you've done to my daughter and my my brother and my sister i know what you've done because my eye will be on the lamb's head right around the head of the land your eye is dead you are a witness you the bride you're baptized by the holy ghost this side before the tribulation system as
