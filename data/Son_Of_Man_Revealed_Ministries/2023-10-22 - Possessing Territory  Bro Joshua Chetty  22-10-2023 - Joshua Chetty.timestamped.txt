[11:32] with the this that's why he started in
[11:34] the Garden of Eden by reasoning amen you
[11:37] know he couldn't bring something more

[12:30] Saints amen amen amen you may be
[12:38] seated thank God for the reading of his
[12:41] word amen amen we speaking this morning
[12:45] on possessing
[12:47] territory amen amen you believe we
[12:50] living in the hour where we must possess
[12:52] all things yes amen not some things all
[12:57] things cuz we believe this is the
[12:59] Ephesian church amen and efficient
[13:02] parallels Joshua amen and in Joshua's
[13:06] Ministry it was promised to them that
[13:08] that's the generation that was going to
[13:10] come and possess the land amen that's
[13:12] the generation that's going to receive
[13:14] their
[13:15] inheritance amen that was the generation
[13:18] that was going to drive out all the
[13:21] hites all the parasites all the jeide
[13:24] going to drive out all the squatters in
[13:26] the
[13:27] land amen but who was with Joshua the
[13:31] captain of the Lord's host amen is this
[13:34] the hour where the angel of the Lord is
[13:36] here amongst us am amen so this is the
[13:40] hour of possessing all territory amen
[13:43] removing all squarters from the
[13:46] land Hallelujah the prophet of God says
[13:49] our Warfare is not carnal But Mighty
[13:53] casting away all reasons see pulling
[13:56] down the strongholds of
[13:59] Satan amen for 6,000 years Satan has
[14:03] been squatting upon the Earth amen and
[14:06] he started right there in God's Heathen
[14:09] he came and squatted upon God's heeden
[14:12] and he brought reasoning to God's
[14:15] people
[14:17] amen because Satan originally was in
[14:20] heaven and he was cast to the Earth and
[14:22] the Earth was created for man but Satan
[14:25] became a squatter because God created
[14:27] his son Adam there and Adam was to have
[14:30] dominion over the Earth amen but Satan
[14:33] became a squatter upon the Earth and
[14:36] became an inance to men and right now in
[14:39] this hour when hell is Unleashed upon
[14:42] the Earth demon powers are squatting
[14:45] upon the
[14:49] Earth you might not see the demons
[14:52] physically but they are in man that's
[14:55] right they are in system they are in
[14:57] laws amen they are through
[15:00] governments yes they are working through
[15:03] the United Nations they are working
[15:05] through the World Council of churches
[15:08] they are working to the UN ecumenical
[15:11] movements
[15:12] right they are strategic it's a
[15:15] strategic
[15:17] war and they become an inance amen and
[15:21] therefore you finding mankind trying to
[15:23] build the Earth man trying to accumulate
[15:25] his wealth and you're trying to they're
[15:26] trying to fight for territory all over
[15:28] the world
[15:29] but the Bible say don't you know the
[15:30] meek shall in the earth amen this Earth
[15:34] is for our possession amen am but the
[15:38] time is not now
[15:42] amen we will come back amen amen when
[15:47] when God totally destroys all sin on the
[15:50] earth amen we will come and Rule and
[15:52] Reign on the Earth but he's preparing us
[15:54] a people
[15:57] amen and we we are right now to possess
[16:00] territory it means that you should have
[16:03] your own armor on because we are in war
[16:07] amen yes we are at War and the war is
[16:09] reaching yes amen amen right now the
[16:13] world is looking at the natural word
[16:15] that's going on in Israel we know the
[16:16] natural Israel types spiritual Israel
[16:20] and spiritual Israel is the body of
[16:22] Christ
[16:24] amen and we know that we are in a
[16:28] Warfare amen
[16:30] amen and right now we know that it's
[16:33] coming the time where Satan is pointing
[16:34] is going to point all his Dart Theory
[16:36] darts at us yes because he's already got
[16:40] the church world Amen they not
[16:42] identified with the truth amen but we
[16:45] identified with the truth we identified
[16:48] with being in the presence of God we be
[16:51] identified with the true word of God and
[16:54] therefore there's going to come a
[16:55] squeeze upon the people in this hour
[16:58] amen and that's where you're going to
[16:59] stand with the truth or you're going to
[17:01] depart from the truth but in this hour
[17:03] of our's time you can't hide fruit amen
[17:07] therefore there was a falling away
[17:09] because why all these years you could
[17:11] hide in seed form but in Fruit form you
[17:13] cannot hide who you are amen and
[17:16] therefore you finding even now in the
[17:18] natural nations are siding with who they
[17:21] were siding with all the time they might
[17:23] have been hiding in all these years but
[17:24] now they are showing who they siding
[17:27] with amen and therefore we are showing
[17:30] who we are siding with amen we are
[17:32] standing with the TRU amen we are
[17:34] standing with the revealed word that's
[17:35] coming as our we W turn to the left we W
[17:38] turn to the right but we will stay with
[17:41] that say the Lord amen because this is
[17:44] the word that's come down to us through
[17:46] a prophet amen and was given and the
[17:49] message was given him through a mighty
[17:50] Angel amen yes what people don't see in
[17:53] this hour that the Mighty God that was
[17:56] come in human form 2,000 years ago go
[17:58] has now come and veil in a man in this
[18:01] day and man has missed it
[18:05] amen
[18:06] amen and now God is moving again and how
[18:10] he's moving through his many membered
[18:12] body to do the Greater Works amen
[18:15] because why you know this body must
[18:17] possess all territory amen all Promises
[18:21] of his word belongs to them because why
[18:24] she is him amen they must go upon the
[18:28] Earth and me and take up his name and be
[18:31] a reflector of him and do the same works
[18:34] that he did amen they must be the ones
[18:36] to heal the sick they must be the ones
[18:38] to raise the dead they must be the one
[18:40] to cast out Devils
[18:43] amen they need to possess all
[18:47] territory
[18:50] amen now you might say but we've got 200
[18:53] million demons upon the Earth how do we
[18:56] do this he's given us weapons of mass
[19:01] destruction oh yes amen we have Atomic
[19:04] weapons amen we've got the reveal word
[19:06] in his hour amen and the devil cannot
[19:09] withstand it
[19:12] amen the opening of the word is yet the
[19:14] seals have been loose to us amen those
[19:17] seven tunders their voices it's all
[19:20] revealed to us amen amen and the devil
[19:24] cannot withstand
[19:26] Revelation because set the Gates of Hell
[19:29] shall not Prevail against
[19:31] it and therefore you find that for for
[19:34] years people have be become Scholars of
[19:36] the word studying the word and studying
[19:39] the word studying the history of it
[19:41] studying the the Greek terminologies of
[19:44] it
[19:45] studying the timeline of the word but
[19:48] yet could not be possessors amen yes
[19:53] amen amen until God had to sent a
[19:57] prophet amen yes in this
[20:00] day a prophet whom they couldn't
[20:03] recognize because he had a seventh grade
[20:05] education
[20:07] yes and he never come from one of their
[20:10] seminaries amen right amen he never come
[20:12] from one of these schools of
[20:14] theology amen but this Prophet was
[20:18] walking with the pillow of fire
[20:20] Hallelujah yes that walked that walked
[20:22] with Moses that walked with the children
[20:25] of Israel this Prophet was walking with
[20:27] the angel of Lord amen directing him
[20:30] amen the same angel of God that made
[20:32] Abraham amen the same one that made
[20:34] Abraham the same one that met Moses the
[20:37] same one that met Joshua amen that same
[20:40] God that was here today amen yes that's
[20:43] right
[20:44] thank never happened 2,000 years to
[20:48] church history but the pull of fire
[20:50] after 2,000 years come down thank you
[20:52] Lord never be a day like this day yes
[20:55] right and therefore he could go and
[20:57] possess every way the the soul of his
[21:00] feet could tread upon he was possessing
[21:02] it amen travel the world taking the
[21:05] message across but he was possessing

[21:13] going to be a people that's going to
[21:15] receive this word it might have been
[21:18] hard for the Pentecostal babes to digest
[21:20] it then because why the digestive system
[21:23] couldn't take it they were babies amen
[21:25] but there's going to be a different type
[21:27] of people upon the Earth

[1:00:26] why we are here this morning amen amen
[1:00:28] he if we all were perfect if we all were
[1:00:31] already perfect we are perfected in
[1:00:33] God's eyes but the flesh man will always
[1:00:36] be it's always at War this flesh man
[1:00:40] this pest out it wants to keep us from
[1:00:42] our
[1:00:43] blessings this is the enemy this is the
[1:00:46] enemy when you go to look yourself in
[1:00:47] the Mir and say that's your enemy we are
[1:00:50] always battling with this enemy
[1:00:53] yes
[1:00:55] we want to blame everybody else but this
[1:00:58] is our biggest enemy amen we need to
[1:01:01] bring this under subjection amen yes and
[1:01:05] the only way you can bring under
[1:01:06] subjection when you when you see
[1:01:07] yourself the way God sees you amen
[1:01:10] otherwise you're going to keep yourself
[1:01:11] in condemnation the Bible says there
[1:01:13] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:01:16] that are in Christ Jesus and are called
[1:01:18] according to his purpose amen so if you
[1:01:21] want to keep yourself in condemnation
[1:01:23] you are not seeing yourself the way God
[1:01:25] sees you you are seeing yourself your
[1:01:28] enemy that's why I'm saying you are the
[1:01:29] enemy you are looking yourself is
[1:01:31] condemning
[1:01:33] you amen you get what I'm saying amen
[1:01:36] you're looking yourself through your own
[1:01:37] self your own ability now that brings
[1:01:40] condemnation and the devil will play
[1:01:42] with that on the mind but when you look
[1:01:44] at yourself the way God sees you am
[1:01:47] you're not relying upon yourself thank
[1:01:49] you Lord you like the SC said I will
[1:01:51] present myself amen a glorious Church
[1:01:54] without spot without wrinkle without
[1:01:57] blemish she will be a super Church she
[1:01:59] will be a super race amen yes amen
[1:02:04] hallelujah thank you Lord amen amen oh
[1:02:08] the enemy should be trembling right now
[1:02:13] amen and the promise that we receive the
[1:02:15] seal is a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:17] that's right amen for that is God in
[1:02:21] form of spirit you being his word in you
[1:02:24] then he comes in if you receive the word
[1:02:26] in you the holy spirit is the only thing
[1:02:28] that can make that love and then you
[1:02:31] have the promise of possessing the Gate
[1:02:33] of the enemy that tries to attack you
[1:02:36] that's right God promised it and so I'm
[1:02:39] sure Joshua ising why I didn't the Cod
[1:02:42] that I gave him is not here God shared
[1:02:44] my whole message this
[1:02:46] morning he knows what I'm talking about
[1:02:48] cuz I gave him a whole lot of quotes and
[1:02:50] he's not here God gave me his word in
[1:02:52] the morning amen and I was battling I
[1:02:55] said Lord why I'm not getting what you
[1:02:56] want me to say and I Was preparing
[1:02:59] something else but the Lord has given me
[1:03:01] this word I don't know why but he G me
[1:03:03] this word in the
[1:03:06] morning and I'm sure you must be
[1:03:08] wondering why I'm giving I'm speaking
[1:03:09] about other things
[1:03:13] though yeah so this is the
[1:03:15] battle this is the Forefront amen amen
[1:03:19] we thank God that he's given us the
[1:03:21] five-fold ministry amen given us
[1:03:23] Apostles the prophets amen pastors
[1:03:25] teachers evangelists and that's why each
[1:03:28] one of us has to be under a covering if
[1:03:30] you're not under a covering and say no
[1:03:32] I'm just I believe the message I I
[1:03:34] remember when I first came in the
[1:03:35] message I was there at the library and a
[1:03:38] brother came came from jber and we was
[1:03:41] having some fellowship and he asked me
[1:03:43] where our fellowship and I told him he
[1:03:44] said
[1:03:46] brother I got it from the officer
[1:03:49] mouth he wasn't in you get what I'm
[1:03:52] saying he said I got it it from the O's
[1:03:55] mouth
[1:03:56] itself so he tried to tell me that he's
[1:03:58] not going to Fellowship he just got it
[1:04:00] from the O's
[1:04:03] mouth so if we don't gather together yes
[1:04:07] yes then then how can we how can the
[1:04:09] five-fold ministry be of
[1:04:11] effect then if you don't gather together
[1:04:13] how can we come in the unity of the
[1:04:15] faith then how can we come together in
[1:04:17] one mind one spirit in one Accord under
[1:04:21] one baptism amen amen
[1:04:24] and then remember God doesn't work
[1:04:28] aasly in his Warfare even in the war you
[1:04:32] got different ranks right you got your
[1:04:35] generals you got your Colonels and you
[1:04:37] got your Majors your captain so forth
[1:04:39] and then you got you got you got your
[1:04:42] air battle you got your ground battle
[1:04:45] you got your troops and then you got
[1:04:47] your troops on the ground and things
[1:04:48] like that so that's how God works he's
[1:04:50] got different gifts in the church amen
[1:04:53] amen he's got different gifts that he
[1:04:55] uses he G blessed us with all spiritual
[1:04:58] gifts amen and therefore the spiritual
[1:05:01] gifts are operating in every church he
[1:05:02] should be operating every local assembly
[1:05:05] amen and then he's got different Rank
[1:05:07] and file in his different Rank and file
[1:05:11] another different Ministries that is
[1:05:13] ordained in the church for different
[1:05:15] purposes amen some will preach the word
[1:05:18] some will will go out in the field some
[1:05:21] will maybe help the go and testify some
[1:05:24] will will pray for the sick some got a
[1:05:26] gift to pray for the sick all type all
[1:05:29] these gifts are used for the body of
[1:05:30] Christ for the benefit of the body but
[1:05:33] under one goal fighting one common enemy
[1:05:37] amen we using his gifts not to show that
[1:05:40] I'm popped up or it's for me or I got to
[1:05:43] certain no we are using on one common
[1:05:45] goal is to defeat the enemy the enemy
[1:05:47] sat is already defeated but he he is
[1:05:50] constantly attacking us yes he
