[5:34] blessings to the reading of his word you
[5:35] may be seated amen amen amen hallelujah
[5:39] praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so
[5:42] we find there was a battle that started
[5:43] in heaven amen hallelujah but then the
[5:46] battle came down to the Earth amen
[5:49] that's why you feel this oppression
[5:51] that's why you're feeling demonic Powers
[5:53] amen you are in being influenced amen by
[5:55] either two Realms either Angelic beings
[5:58] or demonic
[6:00] Powers amen this morning my title is
[6:02] sons of God angels and demon
[6:06] powers spiritual warfare
[6:09] hallelujah amen now sons of God we got
[6:14] Angels on the Earth but then we got
[6:16] fallen angels as well and it's a great
[6:19] spiritual
[6:21] warfare if you thought you were born
[6:23] into a good family amen just to be
[6:25] raised up in a good home in a Christian
[6:27] home and to live a good life and stature
[6:29] your own family have a good job and have
[6:31] a home you are solely mistaken you are
[6:33] put on the earth to combat Satan amen
[6:37] you are put on the earth to become a
[6:38] soldier in the army of Christ
[6:42] amen hallelujah so we find amen that
[6:46] this battle started Amen in Heavens but
[6:48] it came down to the Earth and we see
[6:50] what happened in Eden amen we see how
[6:53] man fell from his position amen but we
[6:56] have been restored back to our original
[6:58] position amen how many of you know what
[7:00] restoration is if you take a old car and
[7:03] you restore it you restore it back to
[7:05] its original
[7:07] condition
[7:10] amen praise the Lord
[7:13] amen amen it's restored back to its
[7:16] original position you're not getting
[7:18] something
[7:19] else amen if you had a v8 car you
[7:23] restoring it back to a V8 that's right
[7:25] you're not putting a 900 cc engine in
[7:27] there and calling it rest restoration
[7:30] that's not restoration that's
[7:32] replacement amen that's conversion but
[7:35] Jesus said you must be born again amen
[7:38] amen there are two classes of people on
[7:40] the Earth right now they are the sons of
[7:42] Adam and then there's the sons of God
[7:45] Sons of Adam are dying and will go to
[7:48] the Grave without eternal life but the
[7:51] sons of God Amen the sons of God are
[7:53] born again of his spirit amen and if the
[7:56] same spirit that raised up Jesus from
[7:58] the dead dwell in you it will also
[8:00] Quicken our mortal
[8:02] bodies amen so we find here the battle
[8:05] climax where at
[8:07] Calvary when God was in Christ
[8:10] reconciling the world to himself so that
[8:12] Sons and Daughters could come back to
[8:15] God amen amen now we the reconciled ones
[8:19] are coming back to sunship coming back
[8:21] to Dominion authority to take our
[8:23] rightful
[8:26] inheritance amen Satan at one time had
[8:28] the leg Authority yes amen that's why he
[8:33] could offer it to Jesus the kingdoms of
[8:36] this world had one time he had the legal
[8:39] Authority what Satan lost was given over
[8:42] to what what Adam lost was given over to
[8:44] Satan so he became the ruler the God of
[8:47] this
[8:48] Earth but Jesus came to put him in his
[8:51] place amen amen and God subjected
[8:54] himself to his own law amen
[8:57] sir amen
[8:59] God himself knew that in order to redeem
[9:02] man the the price for the sacrifice must
[9:06] be paid the price for Redemption must be
[9:09] paid amen so God subjected God will walk
[9:12] in his own word he won't walk outside of
[9:15] his word he required a lamb in the
[9:18] beginning in Garden of Eden so that's
[9:20] why they to take a sinless spotless lamb
[9:22] Jesus Christ to come to Die For Us amen
[9:26] Jesus died for us Jesus Paid his Christ
[9:29] on the cross amen Jesus shed his blood
[9:31] on the cross so that you and I can go
[9:34] free amen so that you and I all our
[9:37] sicknesses all our diseases he be on the
[9:40] cross our deed of death our deed of
[9:43] condemnation he nailed it to the Cross
[9:46] so that you and I can go free that's the
[9:48] power that's the message of the Gospel
[9:51] amen amen we don't have to live defeated
[9:53] lives there's nothing to be added to it
[9:56] Christ has done it all and he come to
[9:59] give man back the legal authority over
[10:02] the Earth amen amen I'm talking about
[10:06] full restoration I'm talking about full
[10:08] Authority where you have dominion over
[10:10] the Earth again that's what I want to
[10:12] get back to the man that God said let us
[10:15] make man in my image amen let him make
[10:18] me let let me make him after my likeness
[10:20] that's the man I'm created to be I want
[10:22] to go back to that and nothing less amen
[10:26] hallelujah hallelujah amen am so we find
[10:30] the redeemed ones are rising up to the
[10:32] god-given potential amen and the final
[10:34] war is being waged between the sons of
[10:37] God angels amen that are here to assist
[10:39] the sons of God and demonic
[10:43] powersall amen what is it God in us Amen
[10:48] in that day you shall know that as I was
[10:51] in the Father the father in me I in you
[10:55] amen the Bible says greater is he that's
[10:57] in you than he that's in the world
[11:00] greater is he that's in you than your
[11:02] sickness greater is he that's in you
[11:05] than your problems amen greater is he
[11:07] that's in you than your circumstance so
[11:10] how can we sit around depressed how can
[11:12] we sit around amen anxious when the one
[11:15] who the problem solver is within
[11:18] us hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen
[11:22] praise the Lord amen which day this day
[11:26] in that day Jesus said this is the day
[11:29] yes the fullness of God Amen he now
[11:32] being reflected in a many membered body
[11:34] the power of God working through us to
[11:36] do the Greater Works and to finish the
[11:38] work you know and pick up your pen and
[11:40] write he says he couldn't finish it all
[11:41] through that Virgin Mary he says but
[11:44] he's got another Mary now amen amen he
[11:47] says look at what it's coming to what is
[11:49] it it's going right back the way it did
[11:52] back in Eden amen you know what oh
[11:56] hallelujah amen you know we we influence
[11:59] our children and we teach them the ways
[12:01] of God and and we tell them don't hang
[12:04] around the wrong company and we can we
[12:07] can mold them and shape them and tell
[12:08] them that boy is of bad character and
[12:10] that girl is of bad character you
[12:12] shouldn't be associating with them you
[12:14] know we can lead them and we can guide
[12:16] them but sometimes we need to look
[12:18] beyond the
[12:20] physical because the physical is easy to
[12:22] spot and identify but we need spiritual
[12:25] mothers and fathers amen because there's
[12:27] a demonic world there's a demonic Force
[12:30] come to influence the people and it's
[12:32] coming via social media it's coming via
[12:34] cell phones it's coming via movies it's
[12:37] coming by all the fourth
[12:41] dimension hallelujah
[12:44] amen amen so it's good to protect our
[12:46] children amen amen but can we guide them
[12:50] spiritually as well amen amen hallelujah
[12:54] amen get them to that cross amen get
[12:56] them to an experience in Christ amen
[12:59] hallelujah how do you say you say how do

[13:03] keep them in an atmosphere amen where
[13:05] there can be birth
[13:07] amen praise the Lord amen I tell you the
[13:11] battle is hot and heavy Satan is on a
[13:14] rampage right now amen hallelujah
[13:17] seeking to influence men seeking to
[13:19] corrupt men who are these angels they
[13:21] amen who are these demonic forces there
[13:23] were angels that were in heaven L am
[13:27] amen Lucifer
[13:30] is now called Satan Lucifer had the
[13:35] music Lucifer was a covering
[13:38] Angel Lucifer amen hallelujah was in
[13:41] control of the worship service in
[13:43] heaven I rather talk slowly softly
[13:46] because the musicians won't think I'm
[13:47] bashing
[13:49] them but it's very important I'm going
[13:51] to say music team so that nobody thinks
[13:54] I'm if I say song leader this that and
[13:56] then they're going to think I'm talking
[13:57] about them but it's important the music
[13:59] team he prayed
[14:01] up because you can disturb the entire
[14:03] service remember you are coming up front
[14:06] it's important for the music team to be
[14:08] filled with the Holy Ghost AM hallelujah
[14:12] it's important for the music team to be
[14:14] born again filled with the Holy Ghost
[14:16] and not have something Satan had p r i d
[14:21] e Pride
[14:23] amen
[14:25] amen
[14:27] Pride amen
[14:31] musicians watch what you do your actions
[14:35] you know you're sitting here in the
[14:36] service you playing music here and
[14:39] suddenly you get upset with the song
[14:42] leader you're getting upset with the
[14:44] song leader you're making this that that
[14:46] way you're getting frustrated you're
[14:48] causing a spirit here you're causing
[14:51] commotion here amen then the song
[14:55] leaders as well need to be anointed they
[14:57] need to be prayed up because they can
[14:59] also cause chaos here by being super
[15:03] nervous don't remember they are here to
[15:06] conduct the service if you are so
[15:08] extremely nervous how you going to
[15:09] conduct the service and settle the
[15:11] people because you they're going to feed
[15:13] off your anointing they're going to feed
[15:15] of your
[15:16] nervousness amen you need to come pray
[15:19] up amen don't stumble around amen have
[15:23] your songs prepared brother brandom says
[15:25] they must be there half an hour amen
[15:27] that song service half an hour if
[15:28] there's a song special you get it in if
[15:30] there's a testimony you get it in amen
[15:33] and he says do not try and preach in
[15:34] that time it's not your place to preach
[15:37] it's your place to sing the songs so
[15:39] flow from one song to the next amen I
[15:42] think amen many people have not read
[15:44] Church order they don't know how the the
[15:46] prophet says amen the piano and the
[15:48] organ is the property of the church amen
[15:51] he says then the music should flow amen
[15:55] amen
[15:57] hallelujah you know the the angel of the
[15:59] Lord can play
[16:00] music yeah he can play music right plus
[16:04] he learned Fanny Crosby
[16:06] song yeah yeah some message people I
[16:09] don't like the
[16:10] him we must sing only in modern
[16:13] songs I mean sorry only certain
[16:17] songs one time the sister got caught up
[16:20] in the Holy Ghost and that's why I'm
[16:22] saying sometimes our musicians need to
[16:23] leave their music
[16:25] too now the old church is worshiping and
[16:27] here they are
[16:33] they never get lost in
[16:36] worship hey when we tell you notice
[16:39] something now watch I'm I'm telling you
[16:40] something here now when the whole church
[16:42] is worshiping and there's a breakthrough
[16:44] going on the only people not worshiping
[16:46] is the
[16:48] musicians because now they want to play
[16:50] and they want to now show you their
[16:51] skill and that was the time for me to
[16:53] get my lead pieces there and
[16:55] things to impress
[16:57] you see I'm talking about me
[17:01] now amen then musicians have a special
[17:04] power they can
[17:09] disappear they only reappear after the
[17:13] service you didn't know that they have
[17:16] the superpower watch it when you go to
[17:18] combines and all of these things the
[17:20] musicians have their own meeting outside
[17:22] they be standing and talking they think
[17:24] they not they they excluded from the
[17:25] service how many of you have seen it
[17:27] brother suban you saw that
[17:29] combin meetings conventions musicians
[17:32] out back there hey they have drinking
[17:33] water Coke this that they finished from
[17:35] that service half now they don't need
[17:38] the word now they they discussing this
[17:41] that they're discussing the sound how
[17:42] terrible it was and this and that and
[17:44] the
[17:45] other we don't need the
[17:47] service now after they complain they
[17:50] they running back to go play When the
[17:51] passor calling with the terrible sound
[17:53] in
[17:55] everything so I'm saying watch the
[17:57] spirits out there
[17:58] influencing now the ministry is
[18:00] depending on the musicians who set the
[18:02] atmosphere that's right but now if they
[18:05] all out of
[18:06] cater and there's problems going on why
[18:09] am I saying this it happened in heaven
[18:12] with the
[18:14] music and Satan came down to the Earth
[18:17] with the
[18:18] music so I was telling you about the
[18:20] sister she was playing the piano and she
[18:22] got into the spirit and she just began
[18:23] to leave the piano and began to Worship
[18:25] the Lord she began to dance in the
[18:27] spirit sisters
[18:29] and and she began to dance in the spirit
[18:31] sisters
[18:32] amen amen and then the piano kept on
[18:35] playing the great
[18:38] phys
[18:40] now the angel knew the cords the angel
[18:43] knew the notes the
[18:45] sying
[18:47] Jesus amen hallelujah
[18:52] hallelujah what are we after why am I
[18:54] saying this we after the anointing we
[18:57] after his presence amen if the Holy
[18:59] Ghost is a gentleman we don't want to do
[19:01] anything to displease him now there's a
[19:04] person a congregant here who's in need
[19:06] of prayer who in need of healing but
[19:08] because of all the chaos and the
[19:09] disruptions going on the angel can't
[19:12] move amen so that's just imp passing
[19:15] amen we need to amen be careful when we
[19:17] come into the service and the atmosphere
[19:20] and the anointing we carry amen
[19:22] hallelujah praise the
[19:24] Lord amen so we find Satan come down to
[19:27] destroy God's creation
[19:29] what God had created himself Satan had
[19:31] come down to destroy that was his
[19:34] purpose
[19:35] amen coming you on the earth now in the
[19:38] message here let your light so shine
[19:40] before men preached in 1961 let your
[19:42] light so shine before men in paragraph
[19:45] 158 it says the people are looking for
[19:48] class and do you know that the devil
[19:50] lives in class do you know what caused
[19:52] the first battle in heaven was when
[19:54] Lucifer set up a greater class of
[19:56] people to get get a better class of
[19:59] angels He thought build a bigger Kingdom
[20:02] a more brighter shinier Kingdom than
[20:04] Michael had and he was kicked out of
[20:06] heaven see where classes come from stay
[20:09] away from
[20:10] class yes
[20:12] amen now in paragraph 159 there he says
[20:15] the hungry don't want class the hungry
[20:18] wants
[20:20] food yes sir the cold wants fire not a
[20:25] picture and the hungry and they that
[20:28] hunger and thirst for God wants the
[20:30] gospel and the power of Jesus
[20:32] Christ you know I I found that to be
[20:34] true because in this last week we did a
[20:36] couple of days of Outreach work and you
[20:39] know the hungry really were looking for
[20:40] food that's
[20:43] right amen yes so I was thinking the
[20:46] next time we really do Outreach walk we
[20:47] must take sandwiches or take something
[20:49] and go because there are some people
[20:51] that will sit to listen but they are so
[20:53] hungry yes and they walking around
[20:55] looking for food amen amen amen they're
[20:58] looking for
[20:59] food and I'm telling you there's a great
[21:01] burden there's a great need amen just
[21:04] standing here by the plaza and letting
[21:06] the prophet's voice Thunder out through

[30:43] counterfeits are rising God is proving
[30:45] which is right and wrong the
[30:48] counterfeits are here amen the
[30:50] counterfeits are here and they will come
[30:52] within the framework of the
[30:56] message
[30:58] so Angelic beings come down in a war
[31:01] with demonic influence over Sodom and
[31:04] Gomorrah now we were there and we're
[31:07] really there in Genesis 18 and 19 now
[31:09] that's where we really are that's why
[31:10] we're dealing with demonic warfare and
[31:12] we're dealing with sons of God because
[31:14] Abraham and Sarah were sons of God and
[31:17] angels came down to connect with them
[31:19] but there was all also demonic activity
[31:22] you see when you're reading Genesis 19
[31:24] and you see that the The Three Angels
[31:26] Came Down in Genesis 18 why have they
[31:28] come down because all L was let loose
[31:30] upon Sodom and
[31:32] gomorra you need to read between the
[31:34] lines here now yes because we're in
[31:35] another day of Sodom now it's Luke 17:30
[31:39] time Malachi 4
[31:41] time as it was in the day so shall it
[31:45] be so when you're seeing now these
[31:47] angels go down to Sodom and you see
[31:50] Abraham before they bargaining and they
[31:52] go down to Sodom and you are just seeing
[31:54] reading the story from the external you
[31:56] are seeing corrupt men
[31:57] trying to interfere with these men with
[32:00] these angels but you what you're not
[32:02] seeing is the Demonic influence over
[32:05] them that Sodom was in such a state that
[32:08] cry went up to heaven that it caused God
[32:11] to come down to see whether these things
[32:15] be true now who took the report up to
[32:19] God Angelic beings
[32:21] yes amen that's right when God told them
[32:25] in Egypt they I've heard the Cry of my
[32:26] people people Angels on the earth
[32:29] messenger Angels taking the report back
[32:31] to God back to God
[32:34] amen amen God is omnipresent because of
[32:38] his omniscience yes hallelujah amen
[32:43] amen the prophet will teach us now you
[32:45] go and search it out God is a being
[32:47] that's right and he can be in one place
[32:49] at one time right but because of his
[32:51] omnicient because he knows all things
[32:53] it's like he's in all places that's
[32:55] right amen amen amen or you never read
[32:57] that before that's right amen the
[33:00] prophet teach us these things so yeah
[33:02] Angels taking Messengers angels are
[33:04] messengers taking the report back to the
[33:06] father this is what's happening this is
[33:08] what's happening this is what's
[33:09] happening still it grieved the heart of
[33:11] God so much that he said I must go down
[33:14] and see it for myself
[33:16] amen but while he's coming
[33:19] down he gives life to the sons of
[33:23] God he changes their bodies am
[33:27] because all hell is let loose upon Sodom
[33:29] and gomorra and the influence is
[33:31] spreading and there are corrupt men
[33:35] there amen and if you go and look what
[33:38] happened to Sodom and
[33:40] gomorra that place is like sulfur that's
[33:44] right atomic fire fell down yes
[33:48] Warfare who caused it to rain fire and
[33:51] bromstone
[33:53] God God burnt those
[33:55] cities amen now watch in the time yeah
[34:00] lot lot as a family and lot as Grand
[34:04] children like the prophet who dramatized
[34:07] lot has got sons and he's got children
[34:09] now he must have had other children
[34:13] there because remember the two girls
[34:15] that he offered he says they were not
[34:17] married untouched yes so he had other
[34:19] children that's right right and he had
[34:22] grandchildren and you go read the story
[34:25] it's so dramatic that the angel has to
[34:27] pull them by their hands and get them
[34:29] they didn't want to
[34:32] leave that's right and the the angel is
[34:35] telling him flee and lot still wants to
[34:38] bargain he wants to go to a nearby City
[34:41] but all of that was supposed to be burnt
[34:43] but the angel concedes and tell him okay
[34:45] go to that City I won't burn
[34:48] it but now all of them are looking for
[34:51] seed watch the chapter now it's very
[34:54] it's hidden there yes amen lot is left
[34:57] without seed
[34:59] yes and Abraham has no seed
[35:04] yes and God has come down to confirm
[35:06] with Sarah you're going to have a child
[35:08] amen and you should call his name
[35:10] Isaac but watch in a perversion now
[35:13] Satan's perversion the daughters go and
[35:16] lie with lot because lot has no seed lot
[35:21] was not given a promise that your seed
[35:23] shall be anything amen lot was given no
[35:26] inheritance
[35:27] lot was given no promise the only
[35:29] blessings lot received is because of his
[35:31] association with
[35:34] Abraham amen amen
[35:37] yes just like amen the prophet would
[35:40] tell us those that do good to the bride
[35:42] will have the reward am amen your
[35:45] friends your families amen they are
[35:46] blessed because of their association
[35:48] with you whether they choose to believe
[35:50] it or
[35:54] not amen
[35:57] Hallelujah but watch the association now
[36:00] we were talking about Association you
[36:02] know we tell our kids don't do this
[36:03] don't do this don't do that but then we
[36:05] associate with unbelievers we associate
[36:08] we go to their things we go for
[36:10] it that's one thing we were not liked in
[36:13] our family is because we never attended
[36:15] their
[36:18] functions
[36:21] amen they want to have porridge prayers
[36:25] we got porridge in the house
[36:30] Jung we are porish prayer every
[36:33] morning you pray before you

[36:58] Hallelujah but now we if we're feeling
[37:01] comfortable in their presence if we
[37:03] feeling comfortable around them that
[37:04] surrounding something is wrong because

[37:57] you it's not affecting any of us here so
[38:01] please go and tell this to somebody else

[41:22] zooming no telescope there he says I
[41:25] looked there was my body laying on the
[41:30] bed he calls it a slanted
[41:34] Dimension one so
[41:37] close is it why Jesus said amen the son
[41:41] of man is ascending and
[41:43] descending was he moving between
[41:45] Dimensions that people knew nothing
[41:47] about amen which dimension did Elijah
[41:50] and and Moses appear from amen they on
[41:53] the mountain and then in a moment's time
[41:55] they go back
[41:57] back amen so yeah Joshua's eyes is open
[42:01] to this Dimension and he sees this man
[42:03] and he says Thou force all our
[42:06] adversaries and he says n but as the
[42:08] captain of the host what's host he's
[42:11] talking about Angelic host Angels he's
[42:14] the captain of the Angels but captain of

[42:40] Lord's host said unto Joshua loose th
[42:43] shoe there's the sign there's the
[42:45] language as I was with Moses so shall I
[42:48] be with

[42:59] for the place whereon thou stand us is
[43:01] Holy and Joshua did so amen amen you see
[43:06] The Obedience that follows yes very

[43:13] prophetic scripture because it's dealing
[43:15] with an Elijah an elishah anointing but
[43:19] it's it's typing an En time people as
[43:21] well it's typing our prophet and it's
[43:24] typing the third pole and it's typing a
[43:26] lot of things here so it starts out here
[43:28] you'll see here
[43:29] in
[43:33] amen if you read Second Kings it says it
[43:36] talks about the sons of the prophet and
[43:40] now they were saying the place where we
[43:43] dwell is too straight for
[43:47] us because straight is the
[43:50] gate and narrow is the
[43:54] way amen amen
[43:56] they didn't want to live in the straight
[43:58] way so they tell let us go we pray unto
[44:01] Jordan and take against every man a beam
[44:04] and let us make a place there you see
[44:06] they wanted their own place of worship
[44:08] they wanted to make their own way of
[44:10] worship Blasphemous
[44:13] names where we may
[44:15] dwell and Elisha answered go he and one
[44:18] said be content I pray thee and go with
[44:20] thy servants and he answered I will go
[44:22] and so he went with them and when they
[44:24] came to Jordan they cut down wood but as
[44:27] one was fing a beam the ax head fell
[44:31] into the
[44:34] water and he cried alas Master for it
[44:37] was borrowed and the man of God said
[44:39] where fell
[44:41] it and he showed him the place and he
[44:44] cut down a stick and cast it into the
[44:47] and the iron did swim thank you amen so
[44:51] here's the supernatural
[44:53] happening amen praise the Lord
[44:58] therefore he said take it up and he put
[45:00] it out of his hand and took it right now
[45:04] what is the a the a here we know
[45:07] remember we talking about
[45:08] elishah and the spirit of Elijah Works
[45:11] how many times five times five times
[45:14] amen and didn't it tell us in Matthew
[45:17] 3:10 that the ax is laid to the root of
[45:20] the tree who's the
[45:24] ex
[45:27] amen the ax is the
[45:31] head it's called the ax
[45:34] head and who's the one chopping down and
[45:36] ring what did it say The Apostle amen
[45:40] the John the Baptist he says the ax is
[45:42] laid to the root of the trees therefore
[45:44] every tree that does not bear good
[45:47] fruit is cast down and thrown into the
[45:50] what
[45:53] fire so this picture that John is p
[45:55] painting is telling us that God has
[45:57] taken out his ax and begin to First chop
[45:59] the trees that he will strike that
[46:01] judgment is
[46:03] impending it's a time of investigating
[46:05] judgment amen amen so the ax is laid to
[46:08] the root the ax is used to cut unbelief
[46:12] the a amen is used to kill the root to
[46:14] kill the tree to kill the root of
[46:17] unbelief amen and Elijah has come again
[46:20] in this day to restore the

[47:44] listen what it says it's a Ministry to
[47:46] restore us back to turn our hearts back
[47:50] amen for far too long the church has
[47:52] lost it sir amen 2,000 years of church
[47:55] history and made the church weak formal
[47:58] cold powerless but under the message of
[48:01] restoration amen we are coming back to
[48:04] the original Pentecostal blessings to
[48:06] the original Pentecostal
[48:09] experiences amen you can choose to live
[48:11] under your god-given privileges amen but
[48:14] I'm choosing amen sometimes we don't
[48:16] even understand what we are talking
[48:18] about we just use phrase words
[48:23] amen you know you get Scholars yes
[48:26] brother we have the word we have the
[48:29] opening of the word they call it opening
[48:32] of the word
[48:33] right and the what is the opening of the
[48:37] word you ask that person that's telling
[48:39] you that tell them my pastor said I'm
[48:42] must ask you what is the opening of the
[48:46] word right and then now they're going to
[48:49] and they may try to spin something but
[48:52] tell them go back to this quote now this
[48:54] messenger of Malachi 4 vers 5 and 6 will
[48:56] do two things Hallelujah he will rece
[48:59] reveal the
[49:00] Mysteries right according to Revelation
[49:03] chapter
[49:04] 10 verse
[49:06] 7 right you'll reveal the
[49:10] Mysteries and then it will be these
[49:14] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[49:18] will literally turn our hearts back to
[49:22] what back to what what of the
[49:24] Pentecostal father
[49:27] back to the
[49:30] faith now here's an easy way to get to
[49:33] it if I can't see your heart turned back
[49:36] to the faith because Faith you can see
[49:39] it amen hello amen Faith you can see it
[49:44] and Christ in the true church is the
[49:46] continuation of the book of
[49:48] Acts so tell them okay I got Bas here
[49:53] amen you telling me you got the opening
[49:55] of of the word you are telling me that
[49:58] your heart is turned back to the
[49:59] original Apostolic fathers yes
[50:05] bmus let's close you
[50:09] quickly making uncomfortable for
[50:13] us it's either we want the original or
[50:16] nothing yes
[50:19] Bas you are
[50:21] saying that your heart has been turned
[50:23] back you sure your head hasn't been turn
[50:26] back you only got head
[50:29] knowledge that's right you got a theory
[50:32] you got the theory so packed so
[50:35] well you know some people become
[50:37] academics some become Professor what
[50:40] they call them Joshua help meia they
[50:42] become they get their
[50:44] phds doctor's degree but they never ever
[50:47] go and do what they qualified for they
[50:50] become lecturers of
[50:52] it you know that there are some people
[50:56] I'm just going to use law now that are
[50:58] so up in
[50:59] law they never ever practice a day in
[51:02] their
[51:04] life you put them in a
[51:06] courtroom these Chetty Brothers will
[51:09] finish
[51:10] them
[51:14] hey what's what am I saying they got the
[51:18] experience one has got just the theory
[51:21] never put the
[51:23] application so when anybody tells you we
[51:27] have the opening of the word which is
[51:28] 100% true but what did the opening of
[51:31] the word come to
[51:35] do if you have asked yourself that I'm
[51:37] going to teach you now what did the
[51:39] opening of the word come to
[51:42] do when we talk about opening of the
[51:44] word what word this
[51:47] word this word was a sealed book this
[51:50] word was a closed book even now we're
[51:53] talking about here Joshua's eyes being
[51:55] open opened and you're going to see now
[51:56] the Lord the Elisha says open the boys's
[51:59] eyes denominations read this book and
[52:01] their eyes are closed they read Acts
[52:04] 2:38 and they can't see it that's right
[52:07] but your eyes are open you can see it
[52:10] yes you read here about the godhead they
[52:13] can't see it but you can see it that's
[52:17] right what is that a veil is before
[52:21] their
[52:22] eyes but our eyes are become
[52:27] unveiled amen can you say praise the
[52:29] Lord praise the Lord prise the Lord
[52:31] blessed are your eyes for they see the
[52:32] things of God hallelujah amen so there's
[52:37] a fine line there between Theology and
[52:40] schooled in
[52:42] theology but if you are not like the
[52:45] early disciples something is wrong
[52:47] something is wrong with your experience
[52:48] not with the
[52:51] word then you need to check
[52:53] up amen
[52:55] yes you need to check up what is wrong
[52:57] with
[52:59] me don't put the blame on somebody else
[53:02] check up your own life amen so we find
[53:04] it it starts out with a very prophetic
[53:06] scripture because he restores the Ed
[53:08] back to the church yes if you see it in
[53:11] type there Elisha restores the a Ed
[53:14] which is a type of the Ed back then he
[53:17] goes on and we find the king of Syria
[53:20] here in verse 12 it says oh King but
[53:24] elishah the Prophet that is in Israel
[53:26] tell the king of Israel the words that
[53:28] thou speakest in thy bed chamber so this
[53:31] man is able to know the secrets of men's
[53:33] art he's able to discern things right
[53:37] and we find here they go to Doan you
[53:38] know that's a place where Abraham has
[53:40] once it's a place called two Wells it's
[53:42] also the place where Joseph's brothers
[53:44] left they left the one place and they
[53:46] went to Dothan so you see they went
[53:48] after two Lords Doctrine there so two Ls
[53:53] amen so they come to Elisha and what I'm
[53:57] trying to show you here is Genesis 19
[54:01] the ministry to be able to open and
[54:03] closed eyes blind eyes remember the
[54:05] Angels blinded
[54:06] them right so you'll find here
[54:11] in in verse 15 16 and 17 Elijah Elisha
[54:16] comes before the Army and they say we're
[54:18] looking for
[54:19] Elisha but Elisha closes their eyes now
[54:22] he doesn't blind them like they can't
[54:24] see M he blinds them as they can't
[54:27] recognize him then he leads an entire
[54:31] Army right into
[54:34] Israel and then he says here in verse 17
[54:37] and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray
[54:39] thee open his eyes that he may see okay
[54:42] I'm sorry I'm I'm in verse 20 I'm in
[54:46] verse 20 and it came to pass when they
[54:48] were come into Samaria that Elisha said
[54:50] Lord Open the Eyes of these men that
[54:53] they may see and the Lord Lord opened
[54:55] their eyes and they saw and behold they
[54:57] were in the midst of
[55:00] Samaria
[55:02] amen that's 2 Kings chapter 20 now in
[55:07] verse 17 of 2
[55:11] Kings I'm going to read this
[55:14] quickly they want to find this man who's
[55:16] revealing their
[55:18] secrets and who is exposing them so they
[55:22] take an
[55:23] army and they Sur
[55:25] around this place where they
[55:30] are it says here in verse 10 and the
[55:33] king of Israel sent to the place which
[55:34] the man of God told him and warned him
[55:37] of and saved himself there not once nor
[55:39] twice so you see two two times it passed
[55:43] so they under the third pool now
[55:45] therefore the heart of King Assyria was
[55:46] so troubled for these things and he
[55:48] called his servants and said unto them
[55:50] will you not show me which of us is for
[55:52] the king of Israel and one of his
[55:53] servants said
[55:55] none my Lord oh
[55:57] King but Elisha the prophet that is in
[56:00] Israel tell the king of Israel the words
[56:03] that thou speakest in thy bed chamber so
[56:05] he says go and fetch him and in verse 14
[56:08] he sent forth to the horses chariots and
[56:10] a great host yes and they came by night
[56:13] and compassed the city about and the
[56:16] servant of the man of God was risen
[56:18] early and gone forth and behold an O
[56:21] Compass the city both with horses and
[56:22] chariots and his servant said unto him
[56:25] alas my master how shall we
[56:28] do so he's looking at this great Army
[56:32] surrounding
[56:33] them and he said in verse 16 fear not
[56:36] for they that be with us are more than
[56:40] they that be with
[56:41] them that's why I'm telling in your
[56:43] daily lives quote the scripture Lord I
[56:46] believe they are more with me than the
[56:49] enemy and Elisha prayed and said I pray
[56:52] thee open his eyes
[56:55] yes so there's a spiritual eyesight to
[56:58] be open to see this Dimension amen and
[57:01] the Lord opened his eyes of the young
[57:03] man and he saw and behold the mountain
[57:04] was full of horses and Chariots of Fire
[57:07] round about
[57:10] elishah thank you
[57:13] Lord amen and when they came down to him
[57:15] so yeah so you see why I'm showing you
[57:18] this Elisha has the ministry to open and
[57:20] close eyes so the same preaching when
[57:23] you when people are reading the message
[57:25] and they blinded to it and yet others
[57:27] eyes are open to it and the prophet says
[57:30] sometimes I say certain things in a
[57:31] certain way to amen for the unbelievers
[57:34] that's right to confuse them that's
[57:37] right amen praise the
[57:39] Lord amen
[57:42] hallelujah oh praise the
[57:46] Lord I just want to close on this here
[57:49] very
[57:53] quickly
[58:10] amen if you go to the first slide this
[58:12] second slide he says now to see whether
[58:14] this message we got is connected with it
[58:17] or not the very hour that Israel was
[58:20] signed in to be a nation it was the same
[58:22] very day same month I was supposed to be
[58:25] in Greens Mill Indiana when that angel
[58:27] day appeared to me and sent me out into
[58:29] the field with this and after that he
[58:31] met me in the river and told me what
[58:33] would take place then commissioned me 11
[58:36] years later at the same hour that Israel
[58:38] was signed in as a nation it's all
[58:41] connected together right we're getting
[58:43] to a point now he says the angel of the
[58:45] Lord is on earth now see is moving
[58:47] around fixing everything for the coming
[58:50] of the
[58:52] Lord amen you you may be asking the
[58:56] question who's these angels here he goes
[58:58] on it's the same angels that heard the
[59:00] sin when they went down to
[59:04] Sodom same
[59:06] Angels connected with our Prophet same
[59:09] angels are yet to connect with us
[59:14] amen and they said we have come down to
[59:16] see if these things be so and one Angel
[59:19] stayed with Abraham the elect Sodom was
[59:21] down there and lot was in Sodom and two
[59:23] angels went down and preached to them
[59:25] and brought that little byy group out
[59:27] sleeping virgin now somebody tell me who
[59:29] those two angels were one
[59:33] was Billy Graham and Oral Roberts right
[59:36] he says this Angels preached down there
[59:38] a modern Billy Graham and them pulled
[59:41] him out but the angel that stood with
[59:43] Abraham at his back turned to the
[59:46] tent Abraham where is your wife Sarah
[59:49] how do you know she was
[59:51] married how do you know that Abraham was
[59:53] married
[59:56] he asked him where's your wife how did
[59:57] he know her
[59:59] name she's in the tent behind you well
[1:00:02] I've made you a promise you see who the
[1:00:04] angel was I made you a promise I'm going
[1:00:07] to visit you according to the time of
[1:00:09] life Sarah is going to have this baby am
[1:00:14] I'm telling you you're going to have
[1:00:15] your
[1:00:18] baby that which the Lord has sown within
[1:00:20] you you are going to have your baby amen
[1:00:24] is it's the time of life amen amen you
[1:00:27] must bring forth the Life of Christ amen
[1:00:33] amen so he says here in 101 there after
[1:00:37] biligram received the Holy Ghost he
[1:00:39] could not come out into
[1:00:43] here you see these Messengers will be
[1:00:47] saved under their
[1:00:49] message you read what he's saying there
[1:00:52] after bully Graham received the Holy
[1:00:54] Ghost he could not come into the bride
[1:00:56] that's right into our message amen he
[1:00:59] could not come out into here that's his
[1:01:01] field down there and he recognizes it
[1:01:04] and God is hold him
[1:01:06] there ah why you don't bring him in
[1:01:10] Lord God is holding him there that's
[1:01:12] right with that intellectual preaching
[1:01:15] the thing that he hears here he's but
[1:01:19] he's trying to jerk out
[1:01:21] Sodom amen trying to jerk out to give
[1:01:24] Grace to that sleeping virgin but there
[1:01:26] was Abraham and his class and Jesus says
[1:01:29] As it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[1:01:31] it be in the days of the son of man so
[1:01:34] those angels will be here on Earth doing
[1:01:37] the same
[1:01:40] thing that's the reason bully goes to
[1:01:42] the Baptist and so forth has to Jack
[1:01:45] schula and those great men out there
[1:01:47] that's going the revivalist they have to
[1:01:49] because they jerking out you see that's
[1:01:52] why you don't find us going you may be
[1:01:54] wondering why we don't go out you can
[1:01:56] see how the prophet is detailing it he
[1:01:58] says they have a Ministry going out to
[1:02:01] the
[1:02:02] Baptist amen I don't know if any Baptist
[1:02:05] that will invite
[1:02:07] us he says men out there that's going
[1:02:10] the revivalist that they have to because
[1:02:13] they joking out they never done Miracles
[1:02:15] down there a few like people smoke blind
[1:02:19] but preaching the gospel smites them
[1:02:21] blind the Bible says
[1:02:23] so it says but to this fell out done the
[1:02:26] sign Supernatural
[1:02:28] sign to Abraham
[1:02:31] right now I need to read this because I
[1:02:33] need you to get this everyone paying
[1:02:36] attention amen
[1:02:39] amen so this is now the prophet going to
[1:02:41] tell you how the angel of God works so
[1:02:44] it's very important when you are prayed
[1:02:46] for when you're receiving something to
[1:02:48] wait for the moving of the Angel amen so
[1:02:52] I remember he prayed for these two women
[1:02:54] one had the growth and the other had the
[1:02:57] stomach trouble and he says I went down
[1:02:59] so there one woman is writing the story
[1:03:01] I went down to tell her what had
[1:03:02] happened when I got there she was
[1:03:04] screaming at the top of her voice the
[1:03:06] growth that left her throat what was it
[1:03:08] it was the angel of God passing through
[1:03:10] the neighborhood amen his Blessing had
[1:03:13] been
[1:03:14] pronounced sometimes they can't get to
[1:03:16] you just as
[1:03:18] they hello amen now can you imagine the
[1:03:21] angel of God coming by your house and
[1:03:23] your house is in
[1:03:24] chaos you're watching movies and you
[1:03:27] living ungodly and you got pop music
[1:03:30] playing

[1:03:34] music off your phone amen get those

[1:03:49] people we need to watch what we listen
[1:03:52] to amen these years are holy they're
[1:03:55] anointed to listen to the word of God
[1:03:57] there are many gospel songs you can
[1:03:59] listen to
[1:04:01] amen the angel of God was passing
[1:04:03] through the
[1:04:04] neighborhood his Blessing had been
[1:04:07] pronounced sometimes they can't get to
[1:04:08] you just as they
[1:04:11] wish he says what was it the angel of
[1:04:13] God had seen a faith and was passing
[1:04:15] through the neighborhood confirming his
[1:04:17] word with signs and wonders there they
[1:04:19] was and these two women were just so
[1:04:21] happy rejoicing the other one had a
[1:04:23] female disc da said it struck her the
[1:04:25] same time Hallelujah you see how
[1:04:28] important it is thank you Lord when we
[1:04:31] leave here or nothing happened to me

[1:04:52] is present now was telling me about some
[1:04:54] of the things that happened in our
[1:04:55] neighborhood
[1:04:56] yesterday after night before last
[1:04:59] meeting how the Lord restored
[1:05:02] hearing to a
[1:05:06] woman been totally deaf for a long
[1:05:10] time claim the angel of the Lord came
[1:05:13] into the house where she was
[1:05:16] at and gave her a
[1:05:22] hearing we would like to have a
[1:05:24] testimony to write it out back there
[1:05:26] that's very fine we're happy for that
[1:05:29] just very
[1:05:30] happy and then the prophet will go on to
[1:05:33] say how many remembers when Daniel the
[1:05:34] angel came to him 21 days he would stood
[1:05:37] you remember that Daniel Prayed but the
[1:05:39] angel said that he had trouble there and
[1:05:41] he couldn't get to him for 21 days after
[1:05:44] he made the prayer
[1:05:46] amen the angel could be down the road
[1:05:48] from you yes but fighting demonic Powers
[1:05:52] that's that's stopping them from coming
[1:05:54] into your house amen so you need to know
[1:05:56] how these things operate I told you we
[1:05:59] are sons of God angels and demon powers
[1:06:01] now locked up in spiritual warfare amen
[1:06:04] so Dan so don't be in a hurry amen just
[1:06:09] believe have faith and if you accept
[1:06:12] Jesus tonight as your healer have faith
[1:06:14] it's got to come to
[1:06:20] pass and there again he says and you
[1:06:22] know what it was it was the Ang of the
[1:06:24] Lord passing through that neighborhood
[1:06:27] of those things he had pronounced if he
[1:06:29] pronounces it it's his obligation not

[1:06:36] yours see it's your obligation to Keep
[1:06:39] On Believing it's my obligation to stay
[1:06:41] and work with him it's your obligation
[1:06:43] to believe what he tells you and God
[1:06:45] will bring it to pass now they can't
[1:06:48] always answer
[1:06:50] spontaneously when Paul was out on the
[1:06:52] ocean that night and and 14 days and
[1:06:54] night without moon and stars while all
[1:06:57] hope was gone no hopes at all on the
[1:06:59] seen men with Barnacles on them almost
[1:07:03] they had been in Sea so long and all
[1:07:05] hopes is gone if they should ever live
