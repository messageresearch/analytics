[0:43] to us Lord Jesus Lord we are make
[0:46] ourselves available to you even as we
[0:47] surrender to the Holy Spirit we ask that
[0:50] you come now and bless us at this time
[0:52] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[0:54] Christ amen hallelujah amen I greet you
[0:57] all in the precious name our Lord and
[0:59] Savior Jesus Jesus Christ amen it's a
[1:02] wonderful thing to be a son and daughter
[1:04] of God Amen and to be called in this
[1:07] hour
[1:09] amen many are called few are chosen amen
[1:13] and we are the chosen people amen so we
[1:15] can thank the Lord for that amen praise
[1:17] the Lord let's turn to John
[1:20] chapter chapter 1 amen the same book of
[1:23] St John chapter
[1:26] 1 praise the
[1:28] Lord
[1:36] [Music]
[1:40] amen so in Book of John 1:1 in the
[1:44] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:48] with God and the Word was God Amen the
[1:52] same was in the beginning with God yes
[1:56] all things were made by him and without
[1:58] him was not anything
[2:00] made that was made amen so this is
[2:03] talking about the word and we know who
[2:05] that word is that word is a person Amen
[2:08] in him was life and the life was the
[2:11] light of men and the light shineth in
[2:14] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[2:16] it
[2:17] not and then we want to go down to
[2:22] amen verse 14 which says and the Word
[2:25] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[2:29] beheld is Glory the glory as of the only
[2:32] begotten of the father full of grace and
[2:35] truth amen amen praise the Lord amen you
[2:38] may be seated the Lord have blessings to
[2:39] the reading of his word
[2:45] amen amen I'd like to speak and maybe
[2:47] just title it the secret food
[2:52] amen secret food the secret
[2:55] food deity embodied in us a amen
[3:02] hallelujah you know we can preach many
[3:04] things but we've got to come into the
[3:06] revelation of this day
[3:09] amen we got to move into Perfection so
[3:12] there was a word sent to us to move us
[3:15] to Perfection amen amen
[3:18] hallelujah
[3:20] and this I'm getting from the prophet
[3:22] when he says the secret food and he
[3:24] talks about deity embodied in US amen
[3:28] now what is deity you may ask amen it's
[3:30] God himself yes amen so when we come
[3:35] into the message of the hour and we
[3:38] start to understand all of the mysteries
[3:40] of God and our Revelation is Progressive
[3:43] and we are growing in
[3:44] Christ we start to realize that at the
[3:47] end of it Christ wants to be fully
[3:49] manifest in you and I amen so his full
[3:52] Glory his full Splender will be on
[3:55] display through the body of Jesus Christ
[3:58] amen so if if we take it in the comings
[4:01] if we look at it and type it in the
[4:03] comings in the first coming God needed a
[4:08] body so he set aside a
[4:12] virgin who would align with the word of
[4:14] God amen amen she identified with the
[4:18] scripture in Isaiah 9 a virgin shall
[4:21] conceive she said that is me and then
[4:25] because she received the word for her
[4:27] day amen she conceived and brought for
[4:29] for the Lord Jesus Christ yes amen amen
[4:32] so that's in the first coming God needed
[4:34] a body and that's what we read the word
[4:36] became
[4:38] flesh so in the second coming God needs
[4:41] a body amen
[4:45] amen because in the second coming he
[4:47] doesn't come back to the
[4:49] Earth everybody understand amen we go to
[4:53] meet him like the Bible says in the air
[4:57] but he doesn't put his foot on the Earth
[4:59] yes right but that's why Revelation 10
[5:03] and Revelation 8 is important because
[5:05] under that seven seal it's silence
[5:08] because there's a mystery going on amen
[5:11] amen he's doing a work on the Earth but
[5:14] he's coming to a people and he's doing
[5:16] the work through a people amen so he
[5:19] needs a body again yes so in the first
[5:22] coming the body there is called the head
[5:26] in the second coming the body that is
[5:27] formed is called the Bride of the Lord
[5:30] Jesus Christ or the body of the Lord
[5:31] Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord so we
[5:35] know that in the end of the second
[5:37] coming he will unite The Head and the
[5:39] body will unite so in the second coming
[5:42] he also needs a body so he's got another
[5:45] virgin prepared oh yes amen and you and
[5:48] I make up that virgin bride amen amen
[5:52] and what are we doing making our body
[5:56] available so that he can come and
[5:59] tabernac Le in the second coming now
[6:02] this is the great mystery
[6:04] secret amen Satan himself cannot
[6:07] understand this neither can Satan stop
[6:10] it even if he did understand it he can't
[6:13] stop the plan of God he can't stop the
[6:16] program of God Amen Satan is powerless
[6:19] before us yes amen amen
[6:22] hallelujah amen so we're looking at this
[6:25] and I just want to background it a bit
[6:28] and show you because we know how the
[6:30] prophet tells us power comes back to the
[6:33] church through Revelation amen and it
[6:35] tells us how when she gets Revelation
[6:37] Satan becomes powerless before Satan
[6:40] becomes powerless before but here he
[6:42] says now in the message pardon he
[6:46] says traditions in them days the great
[6:48] prophet cried out your Traditions are
[6:50] powerless they stink before me the
[6:53] people were offering these offerings
[6:55] without even having faith in what
[6:57] they're doing
[7:00] now we shouldn't be like that we should
[7:02] know why we are coming into the message
[7:04] amen and why we are serving God in the
[7:07] message we shouldn't be doing it without
[7:09] faith is what I'm trying to say so now
[7:12] the prophet is saying in paragraph 109
[7:14] let's just ask ourselves the question
[7:17] isn't that something like today as bad
[7:20] as we a to say it we've got to face
[7:22] facts somewhere
[7:24] yes now here we like to face up to facts
[7:28] amen amen right is right and wrong is
[7:31] wrong I'm talking about here in this
[7:33] church we don't like to candico things
[7:37] if the message church is in the state we
[7:38] need to say it amen if we are in a state
[7:41] we need to say it amen so here the
[7:44] prophet is saying there is something
[7:46] wrong
[7:47] somewhere why this church ought to be a
[7:50] million miles up the road to where it is
[7:54] now Jesus is waiting on his church to
[7:57] get ready amen amen amen how many of you
[8:01] can identify that we are the church am
[8:03] the prophet is saying Jesus is waiting
[8:05] on you to get ready his bride has made
[8:08] himself ready we got the
[8:11] potentials the holy spirit is here God
[8:14] is here the power to heal the sick the
[8:17] power to do all the things that Christ
[8:19] did have we seen
[8:21] it I've seen it demonstrated Myself by
[8:24] the holy spirit so the potentials are
[8:26] here so then what next he says what God
[8:29] is waiting for us to get away is from
[8:33] our traditions and come back under the
[8:35] blood of his son Jesus Christ and become
[8:38] the Church of the Living God
[8:42] amen
[8:44] amen he says I believe that that was all
[8:48] that within me God has sent down the
[8:50] Holy Spirit to do that but we with our
[8:53] rituals without
[8:55] sincerity we're going it's our tradition
[8:58] because it's a ritual we go without
[9:00] sincerity Without Really sorrowfulness
[9:03] of
[9:04] sin
[9:06] amen now here in the message the pergam
[9:09] church age I'm going to read a bit
[9:11] tonight because I want to establish the
[9:13] truth of what the prophet is saying and
[9:15] he says from a little group of the true
[9:18] seed of the word God will present Christ
[9:20] with a beloved bride now this is talking
[9:23] about you and I that's why I'm bringing
[9:24] this in she is a virgin of his word she
[9:28] is a virgin because she knows no
[9:30] man-made Creeds or dogmas oh yes now
[9:32] this is the important part by and
[9:34] through the members of the of the Bride
[9:37] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[9:40] of God to be made manifest in the Virgin
[9:43] amen
[9:45] amen now what I'm I trying to say is
[9:48] that we are coming now to a place where
[9:52] he wants to fully Express himself
[9:54] through the body of Jesus Christ through
[9:56] the bride through your body through my
[9:57] body not just to flesh man now because
[10:01] the spirit amen the flesh the spirit is
[10:04] willing but the flesh is weak amen
[10:06] that's why we need a body change amen
[10:09] hallelujah but we've got to be so built
[10:12] up that this the flesh man can't take it
[10:14] that he got to give way for the new
[10:16] body amen praise the Lord you and God's
[10:20] gifts always find their places he says
[10:23] that Jesus was the fullness of all the
[10:25] prophets cuz they were the word of the
[10:28] Lord if you call those Gods whom the
[10:30] word came to how can you condemn me when
[10:33] I say I am the Son of God see even those
[10:37] in that age was identified as Gods God
[10:40] called them himself God what were they
[10:43] now here's where I'm going they were the
[10:45] manifestation of his word and yeah was
[10:48] he the fullness of the word deity
[10:50] embodied deity manifested In the
[10:55] Flesh amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[11:01] and I'm going to go now to the quote
[11:02] where I'm taking my title from in the
[11:05] message spiritual food in due
[11:09] season the prophet is saying if he
[11:11] appear to us in a physical body he's
[11:14] talking about now if Jesus appeared to
[11:17] us in a physical
[11:18] body looked just exactly like off man's
[11:21] head of Christ at 33 and blood running
[11:24] out of his hand and so forth nailed
[11:26] scars all over him I wouldn't accept
[11:33] it that's a statement right if Jesus
[11:37] Christ appeared on the earth
[11:40] now in a physical body like of man's
[11:43] head and he can show the nail scars and
[11:45] blood coming out of it he says I won't
[11:47] accept it why it's not time and season
[11:51] for him to come that way amen he's got
[11:53] to come like the word says He must come
[11:56] yes amen so the question then must be
[11:59] asked what will brother Bram accept in
[12:02] what form will he accept him
[12:06] amen he says no no no I won't accept it
[12:10] when he comes himself so now he's
[12:12] talking about when he will come every
[12:14] eye shall see him every tongue shall
[12:15] confess him and as the lightning Cometh
[12:18] From The East unto the West so shall it
[12:19] be we don't believe these Cults and
[12:21] clans we believe God in his word amen
[12:24] now this is the paragraph I want you to
[12:26] write down and maybe go and look at
[12:28] spiritual food in due season paragraph
[12:31] 168 but he embodies
[12:34] himself taking your body and my body and
[12:39] give you gifts amen gives me gifts and
[12:43] through these gifts He makes himself
[12:45] known amen yes L that's the secret food
[12:49] he says amen amen amen thank you he says
[12:53] if you're going to search it later go
[12:55] type there that's the secret food or
[12:57] type the secret food you'll find the
[12:58] quote
[12:59] amen so how is the world going to see
[13:02] Jesus he's placed gifts within us he's
[13:05] taken your body he's taken my body amen
[13:08] and he's expressing himself through US
[13:10] amen amen and he says he's making
[13:13] himself known in this day in the second
[13:16] coming of Christ amen through the many
[13:19] membered body and he says that's the
[13:21] secret food amen thank you he says no
[13:26] matter how much he would make himself
[13:27] known by me you've got to believe
[13:32] it now watch He's attributing Faith to
[13:34] this now what I just said no matter how
[13:37] much he would make himself known by me
[13:39] you've got to believe it you've got to
[13:41] have the gift of faith too to believe it
[13:44] amen so what we are telling you now
[13:46] you've also got to have faith to believe
[13:47] it because that's what the word is
[13:49] saying about you and perfect faith is
[13:52] for you to get a revelation of what the
[13:54] word says about you to believe the word
[13:56] and then act on the word amen amen
[13:59] amen we can't skip the steps we can hear
[14:02] the word we can believe the word but
[14:04] then we've got to act on the
[14:07] word amen there's no use sympathizing
[14:10] with the message no use sympathizing and
[14:13] coming so close and knowing all the
[14:15] revelations but then falling
[14:17] short how do we fall short not acting on
[14:20] the
[14:21] word amen praise the
[14:23] Lord he says how is it that we can see
[14:27] other great signs and wonders is done on
[14:29] others and what about
[14:31] us it should cause an estate of
[14:34] desperation that we are determined
[14:36] before God the signs of his coming
[14:38] should bring the entire congregation
[14:40] when we've read it from the word
[14:44] amen he says the newspapers packet the
[14:47] magazines packet show a picture of it
[14:50] now he's talking about you know the
[14:51] cloud and things come back here and see
[14:54] those great Mysteries hidden in the
[14:55] Bible opened up to us on a new field
[14:58] that we we've never known before
[15:00] perfectly Blends into the coming of the
[15:01] Lord Jesus then at the end of The
[15:04] Messengers see the action of the great
[15:06] Holy Spirit see come down visible before
[15:09] the people even taking pictures of it
[15:11] see it working signs and wonders that
[15:13] it's not a man it's not a preacher it's
[15:16] not a certain congregation it's the Holy
[15:18] Spirit showing the same thing it did
[15:21] when it was embodied in the body of the
[15:23] Lord Jesus Christ now it it's embodied
[15:27] in the body of his bride it should throw
[15:29] us into
[15:32] desperation amen and we find as we
[15:35] progress in this Revelation about his
[15:38] glory being fully revealed through us
[15:40] it's got to take deity to do that when
[15:43] we are talking about creative power and
[15:46] the power to operate Mark 11:23 it's not
[15:49] I that doth The
[15:51] Works you see the bride can't be
[15:53] different from the groom she's got to be
[15:56] so in Union with him did Jesus say it's
[15:58] not I that do the works but my father
[16:02] that dwelleth in me so now creative
[16:06] power to operate Mark 11:23 now let me
[16:10] say this that Mark 1123 was only opened
[16:13] up in this Century 20th century prior to
[16:17] that nobody could understand Mark
[16:19] 11:23 nor could anyone have the faith to
[16:22] operate Mark 11:23
[16:26] yes amen
[16:29] nobody could do it but the prophet of
[16:32] the age yes amen was able to unlock Mark
[16:38] 11:23 creative power now that creative
[16:41] power is not at the will of man that
[16:45] creative Power is coming when deity
[16:48] embodies
[16:51] himself how is De you're going to say
[16:54] now how is deity going to embody himself
[16:57] the Holy Spirit amen when the Holy
[17:00] Spirit can take full control of a man
[17:03] now I want to ask you a question what
[17:05] does perfect Faith look
[17:06] [Music]
[17:08] like when you see it on display in you
[17:11] and I what does perfect Faith really
[17:13] look like how many of us won perfect
[17:15] Faith amen amen majority of us wanton
[17:19] perfect Faith
[17:21] amen what does perfect Faith look
[17:24] like if we look at the first example of
[17:27] perfect faith I'm talking about brother
[17:28] Brandon
[17:30] now what did it really look
[17:35] like we would expect perfect Faith to be
[17:37] somebody fully in Authority fully in
[17:40] control fully in
[17:43] charge everybody understand what I'm
[17:46] saying a prophet
[17:49] bold but he's sitting in the woods with
[17:51] his
[17:52] Bible and he's asking the Lord I don't
[17:55] understand the scripture Mark 11:23
[18:00] right I'm talking about the origins of
[18:02] perfect faith in William brandham
[18:03] through Mark
[18:05] 11:23 now he's sitting there and the
[18:07] Lord asked him what did you come
[18:11] for and he tells him I came for
[18:16] squirrels amen so I'm trying to show you
[18:19] that it wasn't something big bold
[18:21] powerful under his super Revelation and
[18:23] the super anointing we know the super
[18:25] anointing came down but look look at how
[18:29] the prophet was being tooted into
[18:31] perfect Faith he starts to question and
[18:35] reason and and starts to have this
[18:37] dialogue with God if you going to read
[18:38] the
[18:39] account and he says I don't understand
[18:41] it then the the Lord is telling why why
[18:43] don't you speak
[18:45] amen what is he doing tutoring him in
[18:48] perfect Faith yes amen so then he says
[18:52] you know even even the prophet why I'm
[18:54] saying how does perfect Faith look like
[18:56] he says let the SC come here there there
[18:58] there this way and the squirrel came he
[18:59] shot it then he says he had to rub his
[19:01] eyes and really check now did that thing
[19:03] and then he says a squirrel doesn't
[19:05] bleed what am i showing you the Lord is
[19:08] taking him in Grace and showing him
[19:10] perfect Faith how to operate Mark
[19:13] 11:23 if you say Amen now did the
[19:17] prophet go there when he said speak and
[19:20] ask for his squiddle did he go to pray
[19:22] and say Lord Jesus according to your
[19:24] word according to Mark 11:23 your word
[19:27] says if I say to this mountain be thou
[19:29] removed cast into the sea don't doubt in
[19:31] my heart but believe what I have said
[19:33] shall come to pass I shall have what I
[19:35] have said so therefore based on your
[19:37] word oh God I speak now and I ask in the
[19:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ let a
[19:43] squirrel appear
[19:46] there because what is perfect Faith must
[19:50] take you back to Adam condition and Adam
[19:52] never had to pray amen amen amen amen
[19:57] amen that's that's why Jesus is saying
[19:59] if you say not if you pray if you say to
[20:02] this
[20:03] mountain and you come back to your Adam
[20:05] condition you can speak yes amen we know
[20:08] that Adam could speak to the winds if a
[20:11] river was coming a certain way and Adam
[20:13] could redirect the
[20:14] river he could
[20:17] speak amen hallelujah Adam could speak
[20:20] to the
[20:23] son remember glimpses of it in
[20:26] Joshua Adam could speak to the sun yes
[20:29] Adam could speak to the Moon if Joshua
[20:31] did it then Adam definitely did it amen
[20:34] praise the Lord amen
[20:37] hallelujah not only you see not only did
[20:40] he could he speak but he also understood
[20:42] the heavenly bodies cuz remember Enoch
[20:45] understood the heavenly bodies that's
[20:47] why he designed the pyramid so perfectly
[20:50] amen that it comes in alignment yes amen
[20:53] the pyramids built in the center of the
[20:55] earth remember job and all of these
[20:57] things is talking about pladies and
[20:59] Orion job is the oldest man that lived
[21:02] one of the oldest people in the Bible
[21:04] and he knows about the Sun the Stars the
[21:07] moons talks about the ples and Orion the
[21:09] Seven
[21:11] Stars amen so this knowledge was given
[21:14] to man in the beginning and that's why
[21:16] Jesus is saying now if you say to this
[21:18] mountain so what am I trying to tell you
[21:21] look at our perfect Faith was now
[21:23] instilled into a prophet taking him back
[21:25] to his Adam
[21:27] condition
[21:29] God schooling the prophet in perfect
[21:32] faith and what am I trying to show you
[21:34] it wasn't something super duper it was
[21:36] in a simple humble way him having a
[21:38] conversation with the Lord and then he
[21:41] he even wants to go away and the Lord
[21:43] tells him but didn't you say you came
[21:44] for
[21:47] three you know like some of us would
[21:50] expect the story to be I went over there
[21:52] and there was no squiddles and I looked
[21:54] at Mark 11:23 and the power of God Came
[21:57] Upon me and I just spoke and I spoke and
[21:59] I spoke if it was another preacher they
[22:01] probably would have said it that way but
[22:03] he was just his own character am he said
[22:07] it in a way we could understand it
[22:09] because he knows even us amen sometimes
[22:11] it's hard for the human mind to
[22:13] comprehend Supernatural
[22:15] things so he says it in a way to school
[22:18] us and make us
[22:20] understand that perfect faith can come
[22:23] in Simplicity
[22:24] amen amen in the Simplicity of your home
[22:28] in the Simplicity of your situation you
[22:31] can take the word and apply it but
[22:33] you've got to believe what the word says
[22:35] about you amen that is why we are
[22:37] talking about deity embodied In You and
[22:40] I the secret food you see if we really
[22:43] knew who we are and I'm talking about if
[22:46] we really knew who we are amen amen that
[22:49] we didn't come just at at the conception
[22:52] amen uh at Birth in our natural birth
[22:56] but that we had a beginning from before
[22:58] that time amen that we are Sons and
[23:00] Daughters of God amen amen that we are
[23:02] the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[23:05] that God wants to manifest his glory
[23:06] through us we take charge of every
[23:09] circumstance but that's perfect Faith
[23:12] perfect faith is knowing who you are
[23:14] amen recognizing who you are as a son
[23:17] and daughter of God you know the prophet
[23:19] is telling us here in perfect Faith he's
[23:21] telling us about these disciples who
[23:23] were given Authority and power over
[23:25] snakes and scorpions according to Luke
[23:27] 10
[23:29] right Luke chapter 10 I have given the
[23:31] authority to trample on snakes and
[23:33] scorpions and overcome all the powers of
[23:35] the
[23:36] enemy but here they are and they come
[23:40] Jesus comes off the mountain remember
[23:42] Jesus coming off the mountain Peter
[23:44] James and
[23:45] John they come now and they're faced
[23:47] with a situation that the disciples
[23:49] can't cast out this epileptic Spirit
[23:52] from this
[23:55] boy you remember the story amen
[23:58] and what does Jesus tell
[24:00] them Jesus tells them because of your
[24:05] unbelief what is
[24:07] unbelief they they doubt the word they
[24:11] don't have faith so their faith is
[24:14] partial and the prophet is saying they
[24:16] had the power but they didn't have the
[24:19] faith to operate the
[24:21] power amen and he says what is the power
[24:24] the Holy Ghost in you the Holy Ghost in
[24:28] you and I remember the Dynamics is the
[24:30] power power come back to the church so
[24:33] what I'm trying to tell you by this is
[24:35] that the dynamic can be in the church
[24:37] but you need Faith to operate
[24:43] it you see because the Holy Ghost won't
[24:46] take your body and start to use it
[24:49] without your
[24:51] permission
[24:53] yes I said de embodied in US man must
[24:57] stand up yes man must
[25:00] speak amen
[25:03] hallelujah what did if you go and study
[25:05] what the Holy Ghost is sinful he'll lead
[25:07] you he'll guide you into all truth he's
[25:10] the spirit of wisdom the spirit of
[25:12] knowledge the spirit of Truth
[25:14] amen amen and if I ask you this
[25:19] question what Spirit did man Adam have
[25:23] in the beginning before the
[25:25] fall what kind of a spirit did he have
[25:28] we know it's a perfect Spirit right yes
[25:32] a perfect Spirit was it a Godlike Spirit
[25:36] yes made in the image and after the
[25:38] likeness of God yes amen oh come on
[25:41] church amen I'm trying to jog your
[25:43] memory from before the beginning before
[25:45] the foundation of the world Amen I'm
[25:47] trying to show you the kind of spirit
[25:48] that you and I ought to have oh yes amen
[25:51] a spirit that ought to govern us amen
[25:53] amen hallelujah I'm trying to show you
[25:55] the spirit that God designed for us in
[25:57] the beginning thank you Lord because God
[25:59] is a spirit and when he said let us make
[26:01] man in our image and out our likeness he
[26:04] was making a man that was
[26:06] Godlike so what was that Spirit remember
[26:09] if we fell from something we must be
[26:11] restored back to the same Spirit that's
[26:13] what I'm trying to tell us amen so what
[26:16] Spirit did we fall from oh yes and what
[26:18] Spirit must we be restored to amen have
[26:21] God good use for you God has sent the
[26:23] spirit that was in Adam amen hallelujah
[26:26] the perfect spirit that was in Adam the
[26:29] perfect spirit that Adam had is the Holy
[26:31] Ghost come on now
[26:34] amen amen you get it the perfect spirit
[26:38] is the Holy Ghost so we need to align
[26:42] with the holy spirit because that's the
[26:44] perfect Spirit image and the spirit of
[26:46] man supposed to be
[26:51] in now you know why the prophet says
[26:53] he's got to give us a new spirit in
[26:55] order to get along with the Holy Ghost
[26:59] amen praise the Lord so the Holy Ghost
[27:01] is our ought to be conditioned yes amen
[27:04] hallelujah oh yes amen so love the Holy
[27:07] Ghost amen amen say I want more and more
[27:11] because what are you saying as you
[27:12] receive the Holy Ghost you are coming
[27:14] into your image you are coming into your
[27:15] fullness of your Adam and Eve condition
[27:19] where deity can fully Express himself
[27:21] through you and I oh the Holy Ghost amen
[27:25] amen hallelujah praise the Lord how if
[27:27] you love the holy spirit amen how many
[27:29] if you love the way the holy spirit
[27:31] makes you do things that the flesh
[27:34] hates am makes you love everybody makes
[27:39] you love everybody makes you love
[27:42] everybody it's good enough for me amen
[27:47] hallelujah uh Holy Ghost can't make you
[27:50] backbite Holy Ghost can't make you amen
[27:52] be jealous Holy Ghost can amen makes you
[27:55] forgive amen hallelujah amen Holy Ghost
[27:59] makes you Godlike brings you back to
[28:01] your god-given position god-given
[28:04] Authority amen hallelujah holy ghost
[28:07] leads you to the word amen hallelujah
[28:10] holy ghost is teaching you the word Holy
[28:12] Ghost leading you guiding you directing
[28:14] you amen bringing you in Step amen with
[28:17] what God is doing in this
[28:20] hour amen we heard on Sunday when the
[28:23] drum beat changes Holy Ghost tells you
[28:25] amen change in music go to way do
[28:28] that and the bride is Marching In Step
[28:32] marching to the beat of Onward Christian
[28:34] Soldiers amen hallelujah am amen so the
[28:38] Holy Ghost is our perfect condition the
[28:40] Holy Ghost is the perfect image that we
[28:42] ought to be in and that's why God says
[28:45] amen that the Dynamics of this church
[28:47] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost a
[28:49] refilling of his spirit amen amen thank
[28:53] you Lord hallelujah and let's say Lord
[28:56] let it come in a double portion Oh Come
[28:58] and Tabernacle me Lord Jesus bring my
[29:01] secret food now food is necessary for us
[29:04] right every none of us can live without
[29:07] food amen you know I was reading here in
[29:11] the book of Corinthians I didn't write a
[29:13] mark the scripture now but I was just
[29:14] reading it that we should do everything
[29:16] for the glory of God whether we eat
[29:19] whether we drink it should all be for
[29:21] the glory of God and some people really
[29:23] love to display the glory of
[29:26] God
[29:28] amen they love that scripture they
[29:30] display the full glory
[29:33] amen so but in everything we ought to
[29:36] display the glory of God Amen now we
[29:39] ought to live such Christlike lives that
[29:41] the people can't tell the difference
[29:43] between us and
[29:45] Jesus amen hallelujah I know I know you
[29:48] really believe that I know it's hard to
[29:50] say Amen to them because the flesh gets
[29:52] in the way amen something triggers us
[29:56] and then we can just get get upset but
[29:59] that's why Temperance and how do we
[30:01] sweeten our how do we get our temper
[30:03] under control we sweeten our temper with
[30:07] prayer amen next time you find yourself
[30:10] getting angry you feel your blood
[30:12] boiling remember who you are
[30:16] amen amen remember who you are as a son
[30:19] and daughter of God because why the
[30:21] prophet says that sticky nature will
[30:23] always be with
[30:25] you but you've got to bring it under
[30:27] this objection and you tell him all
[30:29] nature I will not allow you to dominate
[30:31] this body you know what the key is don't
[30:35] respond immediately
[30:38] amen amen you know as you mature in life
[30:42] as you get older in life you learn these
[30:44] things when you're younger you are
[30:47] hotheaded you are quick to speak
[30:50] amen quick to
[30:53] respond amen just say anything bless
[30:56] anything but be
[30:59] tempered have
[31:01] patience speak a word in wisdom rather
[31:05] say i' rather not speak now Lord give me
[31:09] wisdom how to respond the Bible says
[31:12] answer not a fool according to his
[31:15] folly amen so most most things will come
[31:19] to tempt you amen we can switch that
[31:22] power brother it's
[31:24] okay praise the Lord
[31:42] brother Jeff you can switch it off but
[31:45] maybe I can get the HDMI I can show you
[31:47] some quotes here then we're going to
[31:49] close I think it's more effective when
[31:51] you can see it for yourself
[31:56] amen
[31:58] praise the
[32:26] Lord
[32:29] praise the Lord
[32:31] amen
[32:41] hallelujah there's a message of prophet
[32:43] preachers and if you get a chance I want
[32:45] you to read it it's called the word
[32:46] became
[32:48] flesh so another name for it is India
[32:50] trip
[32:51] report amen maybe some of you have read
[32:54] it he makes some profound statements
[32:57] here we also need to switch
[33:08] this okay it's back
[33:10] on there's no signal
[33:15] there coming
[33:20] up there is
[33:25] it
[33:36] see how big I can get
[33:41] it so this one is not coming
[33:45] on so here's the quote you can see he
[33:48] embodies himself taking your body my
[33:50] body gives me gifts gives you gifts and
[33:53] through these gifts He makes himself
[33:55] known amen amen so that's a quote I was
[33:58] reading there and you can see here it
[34:00] says that's the secret
[34:04] food okay we gone past that
[34:13] now maybe it's a cable in the back of
[34:16] the T okay let me get to the point I
[34:19] want to read
[34:25] now
[34:34] in 175 he says when Jesus no wonder when
[34:39] he come off the hill that night and
[34:41] looked around that tree for food and
[34:43] there was no food on the tree he said no
[34:47] man eateth from thee and he went on away
[34:50] and the next day coming back the tree
[34:52] had withered God's mind the mind that in
[34:55] the beginning that was a thought before
[34:57] it was a word that expressed Jesus
[35:00] Christ the same one is was expressing
[35:03] that word back again you see what what
[35:05] he's trying to tell you there this is
[35:07] the same one that said let every tree
[35:09] bring forth after its
[35:12] kind and when he saw that this tree was
[35:14] not bringing forth after its kind every
[35:17] seed then he cursed that seed
[35:25] right
[35:35] amen so the point he's trying to bring
[35:37] here now you got to catch this okay I'm
[35:39] trying to take it slow tonight cuz I
[35:41] want you to catch this he's saying just
[35:43] like how that was a law that every seed
[35:45] must bring forth of its kind in the
[35:48] Bible the word is in seed form you can
[35:51] see there it says every word in the
[35:53] Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed
[35:56] form amen that if received into the
[35:59] human being and spoke by the same
[36:01] thought that materialized the Bible
[36:04] brings the thing to pass
[36:06] amen everybody understanding that amen
[36:10] amen read it nice and slow yeah and
[36:14] understand what he is saying he's saying
[36:16] the words that are laying in the Bible
[36:17] is seed form yes amen but if you and I
[36:21] can take that Bible and speak it by the
[36:24] same thought in the beginning amen
[36:26] you'll make it come to pass you'll bring
[36:28] it to pass see what I mean how powerful
[36:31] could the church be amen the Bible says
[36:36] let this mind that was in Christ be in
[36:38] you am as a man thinketh in his heart so
[36:41] is he now your thoughts if they become
[36:44] expression right like God said let there
[36:48] be a word before it could be a word it
[36:50] had to be a thought so God in the
[36:52] creation created the world by his
[36:55] thought and the thought expressed became
[36:57] material see what I
[36:59] mean now if that same spirit that said
[37:02] let there be light and there was light
[37:04] Let There Be trees and there was trees
[37:06] if the same mind that was in Christ be
[37:08] in you how much could it say let there
[37:11] be no cancer
[37:13] amen amen
[37:18] yes you see when you realize that you
[37:20] are part of God listen to what he's
[37:22] saying
[37:23] now God is embodied in you
[37:27] so he's saying if that same spirit that
[37:29] they said let there be light and there
[37:31] was light Let There Be trees and there
[37:33] was trees if that same mind that was in
[37:35] Christ is in you how much could it say
[37:38] let there be no cancer and it would be
[37:40] gone let the blind eyes be open and it
[37:43] would be so it's your thought amen amen
[37:47] amen
[37:49] so could it be that you see somebody
[37:52] with cancer and you let them
[37:54] lay you walk away
[37:57] because you don't have faith to operate
[37:58] the
[37:59] power could it be that we' be in a
[38:01] situation yet we don't have the faith to
[38:04] operate the
[38:06] word and speak to that situation amen
[38:10] speak to that problem not have mental
[38:12] Faith now but really have faith in the
[38:14] word of God say Lord I'm a Son of God
[38:18] I'm a daughter of God I believe your
[38:20] word and right now I'm faced with this
[38:23] but I know who I
[38:25] amen and I know that I'm being restored
[38:27] back to my original condition I know
[38:29] that you have given me the Holy Ghost so
[38:31] I speak to the situation whatever it be
[38:35] amen it must obey my voice amen and I
[38:38] believe it in My Heart Lord I speak it
[38:40] with my mouth I believe it in my heart
[38:43] and what I have said shall come to pass
[38:47] am how much more could it say let there
[38:50] be no cancer and it would be gone let
[38:52] the blind eyes be open and it would be
[38:55] so what made the that man that I was
[38:57] witnessing to come back a month later
[39:00] and tell me it worked it worked
[39:03] amen because the prayer that was prayed
[39:05] Lord give him new lungs the man couldn't
[39:08] breathe the man was struggling to
[39:10] breathe had to live on eight tablets a
[39:13] day but something Divine hand of God
[39:18] allowed him to walk by that way be
[39:21] ministered to amen and he goes back into
[39:24] his at night that night and he says Lord
[39:27] I don't know who that man is but if you
[39:29] sent him and your word is true and what
[39:31] he said is true prove
[39:34] yourself he says he slept like a baby
[39:36] that night but he came back when he came
[39:39] he saw us he came running and he said it
[39:41] worked it
[39:45] worked
[39:47] amen now what if I had stayed
[39:52] silent that's what I'm trying to show
[39:54] you here these things are seeds and we
[39:57] are faced with opportunities every day
[40:00] we are faced with circumstances every
[40:02] day amen amen and like how we started
[40:07] out the only Jesus people will see is
[40:09] through you and I Jesus is not coming
[40:11] back in a physical body on the earth now
[40:14] he's working through a many membered
[40:16] body amen is Jesus Christ in you and I
[40:20] he's using your hands and he's using
[40:22] your feet amen I can't express that
[40:24] enough tonight and you may be thinking
[40:26] why I'm emphasizing it constantly and
[40:28] repeatedly I'm trying to make it sink
[40:32] in
[40:34] Lord but wait a minute he said have
[40:36] faith in God for verily verily I say
[40:38] unto you if you say to this mountain be
[40:41] moved plucked up cast into the sea don't
[40:43] doubt in your heart but believe that
[40:45] what you said shall come to pass you
[40:47] shall have whatever things thou say is
[40:49] that right you shall have
[40:50] it not me you shall have it what power
[40:55] has been given to the ch church that now
[40:57] you can express it by mental
[41:02] conception but if it becomes a real
[41:04] revelation of God that you see it before
[41:07] it happened and express it in word form
[41:10] that word takes a hold and becomes
[41:12] material a thought
[41:15] expressed we spoke about faith being the
[41:17] wrong material amen hallelujah that
[41:20] brings the Unseen into a seen
[41:24] world how many if you believe you have
[41:27] the faith of God amen amen to bring the
[41:30] Unseen into a seen World Hallelujah you
[41:34] know brother Brandon was talking to ATI
[41:36] right and he said if you want a million
[41:41] dollars right now you can have it amen
[41:44] you got e it right here sitting here in
[41:46] the
[41:47] wheelchair if you speak and you say
[41:50] healing to her body you shall have
[41:53] it where was the million dollars going
[41:55] to come from
[41:57] from amen but you do you believe that if
[42:01] at you right asked to a million dollars
[42:03] it would have materialized right there
[42:07] amen the same way the prophet says if I
[42:10] left my pocket knife at home and I tell
[42:13] you by faith I believe the pocket knife
[42:15] is in my pocket right
[42:18] now you see natural man can't understand
[42:21] it natural man can't comprehend it but
[42:23] Faith even if you left it in at home on
[42:27] the dresser faith can put it in your
[42:29] pocket right
[42:32] nowall if you go read again the message
[42:35] uh where the Prophet is speaking about
[42:37] Mark
[42:38] 11:23 what's the message
[42:41] called amen if you remember the title of
[42:44] it speak to the mountain amen thank you
[42:48] speak to the mountain you know what the
[42:50] prophet says there when he was hunting
[42:52] for the
[42:54] squirels he shot
[42:56] three and he said he there was a fourth
[42:59] one that he shot but because he shot
[43:02] three he took it away and he told the
[43:05] brothers about this
[43:06] incident you come across it on the tape
[43:09] he said his Deacon I think it's brother
[43:11] Tony or
[43:13] somebody started he said it in a way
[43:17] amongst all the other brothers as well
[43:20] and the way he said it like he doubted
[43:22] brother
[43:22] brandom and he said well brother
[43:24] brandham if you really it it will be
[43:27] there in the morning we'll go and look
[43:28] for
[43:29] it so brother Bram starts to get all
[43:32] anxious now he said but how can he doubt
[43:34] me how could he say it in front of all
[43:35] those people surely I mean that's my
[43:38] Deacon why would he doubt
[43:40] [Music]
[43:42] it you know what the prophet told him
[43:45] while they on the way back there I mean
[43:47] what the Lord told the prophet the Lord
[43:49] told the prophet even if it's not there
[43:52] you speak it and it will be
[43:54] there amen
[43:57] the Lord wasn't going to make his
[43:59] Prophet a
[44:00] liar amen he says even if you can't find
[44:02] it when you go there you speak it and
[44:04] you'll find it and by God's grace when
[44:06] he went there eventually found
[44:08] it what am I telling
[44:11] you speak by faith first you got to
[44:14] recognize who you are as a Son of God
[44:17] Amen and then you've got to have some
[44:20] form of expression some form of thought
[44:22] what do you want for your
[44:25] life do you have a vision for your
[44:28] life do you have a vision where you want
[44:31] to be yes you know you go for any
[44:33] interview for a job to they ask you
[44:35] where do you want to be some people
[44:37] don't know where they want to be so they
[44:39] don't have a vision they don't have a
[44:40] plan amen we ought to have a plan if we
[44:44] are in the image and likeness of God God
[44:47] saw the end from the beginning amen
[44:49] we've got to Envision ourselves what we
[44:52] want to be the kind of home we want to
[44:53] have the kind of wife we want to have
[44:56] the kind of children we want to have
