[0:00] at the age of
[0:02] 37 one night I was praying in my
[0:05] room and when I raised up I noticed
[0:08] there's a light on the floor and looking
[0:11] around and see where it come from it was
[0:12] coming from
[0:13] above the pillow of fire was hanging
[0:17] just above was throwing the light on the
[0:19] floor I heard someone
[0:22] walking I look coming through the room
[0:25] coming into this light came a man and
[0:28] human figure he'd be about about 200 lb
[0:31] of weight he had dark hair to his
[0:33] shoulder an olive complexion is
[0:36] barefooted of course I was frightened
[0:39] and he said to me fear not and as soon
[0:42] as I heard that voice I knew it was the
[0:44] same voice that had always spoke to me
[0:46] but the first time I'd ever seen him in
[0:48] human form he said I am sent from the
[0:50] presence of God to tell you that you're
[0:53] to pray for sick people great signs and
[0:55] wonders will be following your ministry
[0:57] and you'll be praying for kings and
[0:59] monarchs and so forth well I told him I
[1:02] was a poor man I had no education I
[1:05] would not be able to do this job he said
[1:08] as Moses was given two signs of
[1:10] confirmation of his ministry that I
[1:12] would be given two signs one would be
[1:14] the praying for the sick the Miracles
[1:16] and the other would be you know the very
[1:17] secrets of the people's heart I told him
[1:20] that I had been praying about this that
[1:23] the people told me that it was of the
[1:24] devil the ministry he referred to me
[1:27] many scriptures such as when Philip
[1:30] found Nathaniel and Nathaniel came to
[1:33] Jesus well Jesus told him where he had
[1:35] been where he was under the tree when
[1:37] Nathaniel found him and many other
[1:41] scriptures such as the woman at the well
[1:43] how that she was revealed her sins to
[1:46] her when Jesus told her that she had
[1:49] five husbands she ran into the City and
[1:51] said this is the
[1:53] Christ many other scriptures he referred
[1:56] to I told him I would go he gave me the
[1:59] assurance that he would be with me
[2:01] always as you know brother cops and the
[2:03] world knows of the great things that's
[2:06] been taking place in the ministry
