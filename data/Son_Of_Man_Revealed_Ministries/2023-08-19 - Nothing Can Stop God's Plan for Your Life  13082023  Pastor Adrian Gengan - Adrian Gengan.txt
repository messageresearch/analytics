a good day to be alive I hate the house of the Lord amen to enrich you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen good to see every one of you amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles amen praise the Lord amen don't forget the combined meeting this evening at 4 pm amen the devil girl Secondary School Hallelujah amen how many of you were enjoying Abraham's Journey of Faith amen how do you know he's called the father of the faith for a reason amen because God was so pleased with him and his faith amen and no matter how much Satan tried to come in and mother plan and distort the plan and sowing see our reasoning and doubt God will Super Prevail God's word will never fail amen so we stopped on Genesis 14 let's just go through Genesis 15 and we go through a few things amen and I pray that the spirit of God will speak to our hearts amen something very unusual and the more you look into Abraham's life you can see the end time conditions that we are in because you find that in Chapter 11 the in Babylon and this man is in one Accord the immunity and they're able to build a city and they're able to build a tower that it amazes them so much because where there's Unity men can achieve a lot so God even comes down the Bible says God came down to look at the city and the tower and God said look at what man has done with the imagination with the hope faith is the substance of things with the imagination with the hope they had in their heart because of unity look at what they're able to achieve let me now go and confuse the language so there's confusion in the land men are confused but then God calls Abraham now something is very strange God puts it into the heart of Abraham's father to leave the land of Earth if you read the closing chapter of 11 Abraham's father starts to take the journey first he takes a lot and he takes Abraham and Sarah and he starts on a journey and he's going to what and the Bible says that he has a desire to go towards Canaan now why I'm saying that wind just arrived here in the promised land in the Holy Ghost Luda had a desire to move on we're coming on a journey because after the Dark Age of the church amen was almost dead yeah but somebody had to start a journey and Abraham's father starts the journey but then he dies in Iran and that's when God comes and meets him amen hallelujah amen so what are we trying to show you the things that we are believing we are not just alone in it it's come from a rich life Heritage we're coming we can trace Our Roots all the way back to the early disciples amen when the Holy Ghost poured out we are the progression of their Church if you know that if Paul was alive Peter was alive and and all the apostles would be Fellowship in here this is a continuation of the same church amen hallelujah so Genesis 15 let's just read and then we can be seated so we know that in 14 now he means the the mystery of God is revealed he needs Melchizedek right and after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision so remember his name is Sir Abram and saying fear not Abram I am thy Shield that's protection armor and defense and exceeding great reward now you only reward somebody if they do something right but I am your shield and I'm your reward but not just any reward I'm an exceeding great reward to you that's how we feel about the Lord and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliza of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine here you see why we have to ask the Lord these things we've got to ask us Abraham didn't stay quiet he's asking the Lord and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but ish that shall come forth out of thine own bow shall be in thy ear and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars so previous chapter he told him look at the Sand now he tells him if you're tired of looking at the sand look at the stars so from the dust of the Earth to the Stars we've got to look if you are able to number them and he said unto him so shall I see it be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it unto him for righteousness you see what belief can do amen remember Mark 9 23 now Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible amen yes that's what Abraham is doing now he's exercising his faith he believed in the Lord and he counted into him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Earth the chaldees to give thee this land Amen to inheritance amen may the Lord and bless you to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen now if we just look at and just focus in on that few verses that we read there and we try and type it in without any time that we are living in now amen Abraham is saying I am childless I don't have the formed what image in me I'm supposed to be in the Statue of a perfect man amen I supposed to achieve all of these things but all I can see is Brandon amen of all things is that the condition of the message I Elevate Brandon because he operated at this level amen Elisa remember Eliza is the type of me and child Prophet yes remember what the prophet was asking the Lord to show him the scripture he flipped Through the Bible and the Lord showed him the servant going forward to get Isaac so he is typing Eliza in the Bible must he be the only one to come to full maturity is the question I'm asking his wave sheep was waved before us he came to full maturity yes yes amen he spoke to the winds he spoke to the storm he spoke to the fish he spoke to the Raging Bull he spoke to Flying piece he spoke his sister out of existence amen yes his body changed when he was walking with the Lord his wife sheep was waved before us but is he the only one seeing that I go childless Lord is what Abraham is asking is he the only one that's going to inherit all the end time promises because here the Bible says Abraham said you have given me no seed and low one born in my house his mine air so he's Abraham is Brandon born part of the household of God is he also a son of God so he's also born and a part of us amen but should he be the only heir hmm or is he the one that was way before the people the first fruits of the others to say if you lay in the presence of the son you can also come to full maturity amen amen amen you can also operate as the son of God amen amen and yes sir wait waiting in the sunlight to come to full maturity but how many of us have walked away from the sunlight of the word I know because I've got time laying in the sunlight of the word to come to full maturity that's why we are childless amen so ask ourselves the question now using the scripture what about our maturity what about our inheritance Lord amen I see Brenham and I Rejoice because I see my potential when a man is fully surrendered to God how you can use him amen but he prophesied things about me amen and he told me that I can operate in this level and this anointing amen hallelujah now I want you to know that God has not forgotten about you amen God has not forgotten about you you see as the chapters are progressing if we don't if we don't notice it years are going by without the promise being fulfilled but God has not forgotten his promise the thing that you've been trusting the Lord for the thing that you even believe in the Lord for God has not forgotten about you amen thank you Lord amen amen Keep Holding On keep holding to the promise amen don't deviate now now's not the time for unbelief and reasoning to come in amen I want you to know God is Not Forgotten amen you have may have had all the experiences like Abraham we just started in 12 13 14. he had early experiences but time has lapsed now God comes to reconform his word I am your defense oh yes I know a great reward amen you may feel childless but God is saying one out of your own vows the whole life must come out of you yeah amen Christ's life must come out of you amen amen hallelujah we Rejoice to see Christ's Life coming out of Paul out of Luther out of Wesley but what about out of you amen Christ's life must come out of your own voice vows amen amen now in verse 8 the Lord comes down he reconfirms his promise and he tells him Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it how do I know that I shall inherit these things so here the Lord gives him amen he takes five animals so anything that you inherit in this life takes by g-r-a-c-e anything you inherit in this life it's by the grace of God Amen to our god asked him to take an effort he asked him to take a coat he asked him to take a ram amen a turtle dove and a young pigeon amen that's why if a goat amen a ram a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he tells him to divide it in the midst of him and then the Lord comes amen now amen in the midst of that before the Lord comes as a consuming fire to consume it Abraham goes into a Daydream or Nightmare and God shows him things that are to be and he shows him how you see he's going to go into captivity in Egypt right so amen let's just go to our quotes there and just maybe tie this up here so my subtitle here this morning is nothing can stop God's plan for your life nothing gets up God's plan maybe you've forgotten about the plan but God has not forgotten about it amen so yeah we read amen we can go to slide number four there he says we are families every family in here is custom to that sometimes everything will run fine for you for years then all at once you little spell where everything goes wrong we see it many times here down here in the South when it rains you pause you're going through a nighttime that's what Abraham was having in our vision of night time yeah when the children of Israel will go down into Egypt he says then there's a day break and then at night time everything runs in continuity not to go to slide true there you'll see the scripture to everything there is a season anytime so there's time and season for everything amen for every matter or purpose under heaven for everything there is a season there is a time and God has a great clock the next slide amen God has a great clock and he has a picture this is the prophet now and he is moving the club to get the picture in life amen God is moving his truck to get the picture that he has in his mind to bring the picture to pass you may think the clock is out of sync you may be thinking the clock needs you batteries but God's clock is never out of time God's blood doesn't need batteries amen amen amen and God has a picture you may not like the picture but God has a picture of you and the image he wants to bring you to amen amen and if you refuse to obey that voice that's calling you to align with the picture then you ask him for serious trouble because you've got a child of God if you're a son and daughter of God he is going to whoop you into place he's going to make you go to Great trials through great persecution he's going to let a will swallow you up because you're running from Nineveh amen but the property is saying again nothing can stop it amen say thank you Lord nothing can stop my blessings nothing has stopped me from coming into your image amen it's going to be just exactly according to what God said it would be that's why we don't have to get jealous when other people are prospering when other people are progressing in this life even spiritually we don't have to get jealous because my Lord has been apportion to me and according to God's time and season I shall receive it amen you don't even know that other people may be jealous of what God is doing for you but yet you are jealous of one another who God is doing for other people don't be jealous the bottle is fitly framed together enjoy one another's blessings amen hallelujah enjoy one another's gifts praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so the thing needed we know is the Holy Ghost amen how many of you know the thing needed is the Holy Ghost God will give us the Holy Spirit to actually destroy sin out of our life [Music] so if there's any sin there then you know now there's a check mark there Lord do I have the Holy Ghost it's coming to utterly destroy sin and nothing can stop the church if the church is stopped it's because they left the Holy Ghost they've gone after their own program but nothing has stopped the move of God nothing can stop the program of God if it's LED of the Holy Ghost God Amen they may call you frenetic they may call you simple to protect the Bible they may say you're a Holy Roller whatever they do nothing's going to stand in God's Church she's moving towards Canaan they may tell you believing the wrong thing Brother Sam they may tell you you're believing in a false prophet they made amen how many of you know that yeah all all the people here to Bear a lot of reproach now we've got organized messy churches but they have to leave denominations and they they took a lot of words from the denomination they met they had a lot of rejection a lot of what the persecution was spoken to them they were called fanatics amen hallelujah but they stood faithful to the word of God something was revealed to their hearts amen while they were hearing an eagle cry amen the other people couldn't hear nothing yeah the other people are saying this guy is condemning the women the other people were saying he's calling me a chicken yeah amen they were listening to the same voice but one was being called a chicken and one was being called an eagle amen give God praise for a bigger noodle amen glory glory glory glory amen amen turn to your neighbor and tell them I'm gonna surprise you today I'm going to be singing amen so no now all of you can do it I'm going to be singing a man to the one of the Lord amen try to embrace yourself brother yeah many many men now he says if you don't go God's going to take them that will go amen I believe all of us want to move with God's program now brother Brandon is saying if you don't want to go with this program God will take those that one to go it's an irresistible Force irresistible for us and God will move everything all Devils out of hell and all these forces can't stop it then if there's ever a time that all dealt up or fell upon the Earth it's now you could read the fourth seal it's now but even all the devils in hell even Satan himself can't stop you amen you will empower the Holy Ghost Satan is scared of you still do the Holy Ghost Satan is terrorized abuse filled with the Holy Ghost amen the time's here yes time and season now the time is here that the spoken word of God is ready to come to pass and nothing can stop it amen we need to be available to the Lord and say Lord use me as your spoken word you hear the channel right now father nothing can stop it you'll be amazed at what the Son and Daughter of God who believes in the word of God is immovable in the word of God all things become possible to them amen they are forced to be reckoned with and he resistible Force yes amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so we find God confirms his word by coming and consuming the sacrifice and he confirms it by grace a sacrifice of Grace amen so yeah you find amen that's how the chapter closes there with a night dream and then the Lord tells him about the Canaanites camsites so yeah in list 10 Nations 10 Nations that is going to give them now imagine Abraham walking through the land why did the God tell him I'm going to be a shield he's walking through a land that's fully inevited by other nations don't tell them this but when they say this was our land first they actually absolutely right Abraham walked into their territory and God said I'm going to give you all of this right so he had to walk the way and God was going to give him all and he said I'll drive all of these people out yeah because I have got a you in my mind oh man so yeah we finally chapter 16 now chapter 16 he's wear doubt and reasoning comes in amen chapter 16 he's wear doubt and reasoning comes into the story and if you read the story it's almost identical to Genesis chapter 3. where the serpent comes in the Garden of Eden and souls doubt and reasoning and how does doubt and reasoning come in Chapter 3 of Genesis through the Through The Who through the woman amen and watch our doubting reason comes in in chapter 16 of Genesis through the woman now Sarah Sarah Abram's wife babe no children and she had an animated Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarai said to Abram Beyond now the Lord had restained me from bearing I pretty go in unto my maid that it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram after the voice of Sarah and Adam listened to the voice of Eve amen same story it must be the same because I Adam and Eve was the first family God chose now after the flood God chooses a new family and he comes with the same reasoning amen trying to make them fall [Music] and some of you know I was asking my wife this the other day we're having a trivial questions and I was asking how many wives did Abram have so we know Abraham had Sarah and yeah how many wives so when Sarah died then he remarry so yeah I'm bringing this point for a reason watch how the Bible writes it and Sarah Abram's wife took AGA amid the Egyptian and Abram at 12 10 years in the land of Canaan I gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife so you see you men that's sleeping around with women that's your wife [Music] God sees it as your wife hello we woke up here in the 20th century and you're thinking the only time you get married is because of an English traditional ceremony I don't know if you know the English traditional ceremony didn't exist maybe a couple hundred years ago your white wedding dresses and things hello these were Eastern Eastern marriages you go find when when Rebecca comes to meet Isaac they're just going to the tent and she became his wife they didn't go have a big uh wedding as time progressed they got into more traditional and they started to have winnings and all of these things amen but don't forget my point now you young men you keep yourself pure you young woman you keep yourself pure don't think you can go around sleeping around God will hold you accountable for it amen God is a word his word is he standard and we must keep his word we have no excuse because we are growing up with truth truth is presented to you all the time so you're gonna have to make these choices no matter how enticing sin may seem don't get caught up into it amen you keep yourself undefiled so here you find in verse 3 it tells you that 10 years have passed since the Lord called him so after 10 years voice of doubt and reasoning comes in after how many years now in the message the voice of doubting reasoning is coming in amen Hallelujah and Sarah Abram's wife took aega so she gives him to be his wife and he went in to aega and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistus was despised in her eyes now she's saying my wrong be upon you why you listen to me why did you listen to me my wrong be upon you [Music] I have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the law checked between me and thee but Abram said to Sarah Biol this is your maid they see the pushing the blame back and forth this is your mate you do it as you please you see the same story in Genesis there and that's what I'm trying to show you the back and forth blame back and forth blame so she fled now when she flees amen okay just stay I want you to know God does not need our help to bring the promise to pass yes Sarah thought God needed our help right Sarah thought God needed her help to bring the promise to pass I love God my poor husband is here having so much of Faith he's believing it he's got me making so much of booties and clothing here I've got all Wardrobe full [Music] let me help God bring the promise to pass my body is old now 10 years 65 and now she's 75. Abraham is 85. 75 years huh I'm past childbearing now I got a young Egyptian girl yeah maybe the Lord will use her to bring the promise to pass now in all of this God is silent God could have stopped them God could have come down and stopped them but God is silent amen God has a provided way and then there's a permissive way you may be thinking you got away with whatever you've done and you're walking in God's permissive way amen God will still have the last saying amen so God does not need our help to bring the promise to pass just because 10 years or 50 years has gone by 60 years and no sign of the promise don't let unbelief come into the church don't let reasoning come into the church the reasoning will come in through subtility the reasoning will look so reasonable the reasoning amen but wait until God's time and season amen because when you go over to Genesis 22 verse 2 now whose son is this who's Ishmael who's Ishmael whose son is he who's the father come on now who is the father of Ishmael okay but in Genesis chapter 22 God tells verse 2 God tells Abraham take now thy son thine only son Isaac because in reality Abraham had only one son but Abram and Ishmael amen amen amen yes remember Abram is the old nature yes Abram why does the name represent your nature Abram doesn't have a new name so Abram's son is Ishmael but in Genesis 22 verse 2 he tells him take now thy only son Isaac but watch here God is mindful of all things they didn't even know what the child the the one that's in agar's womb the name of it but the angel of the Lord comes to this woman and tells her the name of the child yes yeah so you'll find in chapter seven you'll find you can go and read it how the angel of the Lord comes and finds it by the function of water in the wilderness and he tells her to go back to your mistress amen I need the child to be delivered because it's Abram's seed now God don't believe in abortion yeah yes amen hello yeah if she had stayed in the wilderness she would have perished she would have died and Abraham's seed Abram's seed would have died with her God says go back go back to your place of Refuge go back to your master no and let the child come forth let them take care of you right and here you'll find that God tells him now in verse 11 the angel of the Lord said unto us behold Thou Art my child thou shall be a son and shall call his name Ishmael that sounds so familiar to the angel that spoke to Mary you are a child you shall be a son and his name Shall be Called Ishmael because the Lord had hurt land Affliction and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of his Brethren and she called the name of the Lord that speak unto her thou God sees me for she said have I also you looked after him that seeth me wherefore the well was called because it was between kadish and Berea so he's now 86 years old he's got a son foreign and he takes care of the Sun and you'll find in the next chapter Abram is now 90 years old how many years have passed amen four years past in chapter 17. four years passed the boy is four years old and the Lord appears unto Abram and says I am almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make a covenant that's a treaty in agreement or a promise between me and thee and multiply the exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him as for me be all my covenantes with thee and thou shall be a father of many nations amen right now here's the name change neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee amen amen amen Hallelujah and I will make the exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and King shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed out to thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein Thou Art his stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting position and I will be their God so yeah we know what is the Covenant given now God says to Abraham that shall keep so straight away it goes to calling him Abraham in verse 9. God said you changed your name and I'm calling you Abraham from now on Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore and I heal after thee in their generation this shall be my Covenant which you shall keep now every man child among you shall be circumcised now we know circumcision is the type of love Holy Ghost circumcision right so God is giving him a new name and is giving him the Holy Ghost you shall circumcise your flesh of your foreskin it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and you and you know eight days old every man child in your generation that is born in your house shall be brought brought into and anyone that is not circumcised shall be Cast Away that's how that verse ends right because you're broken by Covenant you'll see that in verse 14. thou shall cut off the soul from my people now God doesn't only change Abraham's name this is very important now because if you go and read from chapter 12 nowhere that's how unbelief came in now because Satan will always try and find a point of reasoning nowhere from chapter 12 God does God reveal to Abram through who the seed will come he doesn't name Sarah anywhere before hello he only tells him Abraham out of your loins out of you shall come forth out of you out of you so Sarah when she was reasoning did God say that Abram shall have a son maybe it won't be through you because he never mentioned the woman maybe it'll come through aega but now God is specific God is identifying the paining ground God is identifying the woman in church yeah come on I'll follow the continuity after the new name and the Holy Ghost God will identify you as the bride and the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ through whom he's going to manifest his life amen amen yeah we find that in verse 15 God said to Abram ask for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name and I will bless her amen amen and give thee a son also of her I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations so not only is Abraham a father of Nations amen Sarah is mother of Nations Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen not only is he King of Kings but she is Queen of Queens king of people shall be of her then Abram fell on his face watch now because man is just being man and Abram fell on his face and laughed shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall server that is 90 years old babe now watch what God what Abram is offering God Abram said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before thee he became the apple of Abram's eye Abram's eye Abram was settling for this to be his inheritance now God is reconfirming to which woman and God said Sarah thy wife amen let me tell you this from a zooming out a bit the church world thinks that God is producing his life through denominationalism they all over television they all over the world proclaiming the name of Jesus but God is saying through this bride through this Pride I will reproduce my life amen amen stop telling me about denominations I'm not interested in that life of Ishmael it's a wild Nation yeah Hallelujah amen refocus Abraham Sarah thy wife amen and Jesus has the wife amen other people are claiming his name Agar was claiming Abram's name that's my husband I have a son with him amen they are claiming the name of Jesus they are performing great signs and wonders Miracles and saying the name of Jesus may God blessed famous names there but God is saying I have one woman amen the marriage of the Lamb is kind and his wife has made himself ready yes I am one woman and Sarah is a meme hey amen Sarah thy wife shall be the son indeed and thou shall call his name Isaac so God is telling them the name God knows your children before you name them yes God knows if you're gonna have children what your son's names are is acting so shy God knows yes God even knows the person he's looking down God even knows the person you're going to marry Say Amen amen you want me to say that for you too God knows the person you're going to get married to come on you're supposed to say Amen reveal it to me Lord you see your father wasn't slapped you must get some chips from me hey amen praise the Lord Give the Lord a good night for praise the Lord praise the Lord [Applause] amen so God is reconforming Abraham get your vision back into Focus you got into wild imaginations here you're trying to offer me Ishmael and telling me to bring the promise to him I am going to use Sarah you think you think that promise will still come to us 60 The Profit you think in principal Army you should put children I think it'll still come amen how do I know it's here yeah yeah amen it's here already amen praise the Lord amen that's voicemail I hear what you're telling me about Ishmael I have blessed him and I'll make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he begin and I will make him a great nation and but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac see my Covenant will be with Isaac with Sarah again re-emphasizing the woman the bending ground Sarah shall be unto thee at the set time in this time and season next year and he left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham amen praise the Lord so yeah God Abraham goes now and he circumcises we know he circumcises ishma and he circumcises all his servants and he gets circumcised and he's 99 years old amen and here they go following that sign of circumcision they are going now to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they're following now what God is saying now God is telling him hey come on now now at 99 years old at 199 one is 100 one is uh one is hundred and what's the other one it's 10 years difference right so now it's impossible so the body needs to change the body needs to change yes yes because in the physical state they can't bring for children so their body must change that's when now Genesis 18 comes into view amen are we expecting a body change Genesis 18 what happens three men come from heaven three men come from heaven amen walking through and you know important that is because that's time with body change son of man being revealed is tied to a body change amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen but I just want to be mindful of what I'm doing here this morning and don't forget so this is my thought for you this morning I believe how many of you are believers here amen come on now I want everyone to believe everybody you don't want to do I believe therefore all things are possible that's Mark 9 23 right I believe therefore all things are possible and I am Unstoppable amen yes yes do you know why you saw there our about Ishmael will be a great nation and God will bless them you see we say that we are blessed after a faithful Abraham all the blessings of Abraham are mine yes but we we don't put our hand to work therefore we don't see the reward of them yeah all of you are blessed yes but maybe you're satisfied with working for a boss because you have the Holy Ghost who is the Holy Ghost people don't know who the Holy Ghost is who is the Holy Ghost right God about God was above us then God was with us now it's God in us you see what happens when you have to rebuild rebuild the walls I'm rebuilding Faith amen I'm rebuilding faith in you to show you things amen to show you what a powerful Unstoppable Force you are amen amen that nothing you touch should not be blessed oh yes everything now I need you to confess us everything I touch everything at times he's blessed he's blessed my family is blessed family is blessed my possessions are blessed everything I touch is blessed yes yes do you know when you speak you are blessing people your word should be words of wisdom you should be blessing people yes you should be speaking to people when they hear you this you say yo what wisdom is throwing out of this person yes no no I feel good around this person yeah they are so positive and so full of encouragement that they are so full of what is this I've never experienced this kind of Faith this energy amen amen hmm what is this presence about them what is his energy force yes that's around there thank you amen so what I'm saying is the Muslims believe that ishmael's Nation right they go and open business forever yeah and they are prospering they are working according to their promise whether they know it or not and they are being blessed yeah the same with the Jew the Judas opens business is blessed bless bless blessed blessed but we are taught different yeah your thoughts are coming to your master go to work come home but if you put your hand to anything amen you have been given a promise already yes that Everything You Touch Is blessed thank you nothing shall return to your voice or empty what's right or parent absolutely but it's a lifestyle as well let me tell you Abraham was a man of praise Abraham is a man of worship Abraham was a man of obedience Abraham was a man of submission then you are to submit to God you knew his heart was right amen hallelujah go and go and read there those chapters and see anytime God asks Abraham asks God to bless him he just walked before the Lord and and this man pleased the Lord so much God just started to pour His blessing upon him amen that's how we want to be right amen so I believe therefore all things are possible and I'm unstoppable I'm a force to be reckoned with amen I'm in a resistible force amen so nothing can stop God's plan for your life the truth is that the father is a plan for your life and God is bringing you to pass by moving the clock and bringing you into his picture that he has of us right and nothing can stop God's plan for your life not you not your neighbor no enemy can stop God's plan you'll find in Jeremiah 29 11 it says for I know the plans I have for you say the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you his plans is to give you a hope and a future amen is planned the design that is for a specific time and season and God's plans are bigger and better than my plans I don't know if you know the Bible says that God's ways are higher than our ways God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts God wants to give you more than you will be imagine he says exceeding great reward Abraham exceeding Grace he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask a thing he is requiring you to believe him he's requiring you to have faith in him he's requiring your future surrender to him amen but in the human nature sometimes we would just want to make plans on our own amen amen we try and rush things ahead of God's Time ahead of God's season and then we get disappointed when our plans don't succeed we wonder why things don't work out for us as planned amen but I want you to know this morning God's timing is perfect he is never too early neither is he too late and God's plan will always come to pass amen amen and for you I want you to know and I really mean this now I'm speaking to you God is not forgotten about you yes thank you God has not forgotten about you young men young women even sisters all sisters young sisters all men young men all of us God has not forgotten about us you are not just here a number filling space [Music] -time amen when we are connected Romans 8 28 you'll find here when we become connected to God's plan God will walk out all things together for our good but we need to be connected to the source we need to be connected to him amen God's plan like we said is designed for a specific time and season and nothing can derail him nothing can make it happen before time amen God promised us that our God never promised us here that our life or not will be easy amen but he did say that there is a time and season for everything like we read in Ecclesiastes right and when it's your turn when it's your turn when it's your time when is your season amen nothing can stop it yes yes people may try and stop it people may try and discourage you but nothing can stop it amen hallelujah so God knows when we're ready God knew when Abraham was ready God in his mind and his cloth he knew 25 years had to pass I want everything even Abraham if he slept with 100 women he wouldn't have been able to have children his body was completely past the age to reproduce so God was making sure that it's no human ability here I will show my glory and I will share my glory on nobody that's why Abraham says Lord take your smell like I don't even have seed anymore now the Bible says the thing that which upon the Lord amen shall renew their strength amen they shall Mount up with wings like him amen they that wait upon the Lord if you go to Proverbs 16 and 9. maybe you know we got our own plan sometimes in life but yeah we're Proverbs 16 and 9 says amen Hallelujah a man's heart divides his way but the Lord directed his steps maybe in the night you're planning your plotting what you're going to do but God is ordained your steps amen Proverbs 3 and verse 5 and 6 says trust in the Lord with all that heart lean not to thine own understanding in all that ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your path amen so we see amen that God has this great clock and this great picture and he has you in his mind and you are forced to be reckoned with but God is working now to bring you into that image ask yourself am I cooperating with God am I submitting to God Amen amen am I surrendering to him do I have the Holy Spirit am I feeling on the word amen praise the Lord so yeah it's slide seven he says the property saying you now you can never go forward until you are perfectly satisfied and know without a shadow of doubt you're walking in God's will so we want to go forward right we want to move ahead in the things of God but we must know that we are walking in his will then when you know you ain't God's Will and walking in his way so there's a will and there's a way nothing can stop you because you know where you're standing you know the way you're going you know what you got in your mind and you know what the will of God is then you can do it amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen if God would reveal to that little girl now this can be applied to anything in life I'm saying anything take the limit of just healing now here if God would reveal to that little girl sitting there she was going to walk I bet the devil could tell every demon he's got in out of hell that wouldn't stop it that man sitting there in a wheelchair whoever you are it wouldn't stop him no there ain't nothing going to stop him God said so that settled it believe believe I believe therefore all things are possible therefore I'm unstoppable I believe therefore if I lay hands upon the sick they must recover amen I believe they shall lay hands upon the sick they shall recover they shall cast out devils in my name because they believe now let me explain this to you some of you have never seen that scripture come to pass because you are not a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ you don't believe that that scripture applies to you you believe that that scripture applies in the in the church yet the puppet for the pastor so when somebody is sick you don't see yourself as the disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ to bring that promise to pass so our you see that the true teaching of the word and the true building up of the church is to put the word back into the people and the people operate with the word then you won't find okay you know what I'm gonna tell my pastor about you and we're gonna pray when the need arises you say Lord your word declares here in Mark 16 that these signs you're putting it up for them who don't know it that these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover in my name they shall cast out devils they shall drink deadly things you shall not harm them Mark 16 16 it's gone to maybe 15 16 around there amen let's all read it together and these signs shall follow them without believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they treat any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover whose is they go back then one shall follow them that believe now you all raise your hand just now when you told me you believe yes now you all can operate that scripture amen thank you you believe the Lord will back your word up but they met his word up but you have got to perform it any promise of God any promise of God if you believe it God is obligated to his word now we've not seen it maybe I have not seen it in your life because you've never taken the opportunity maybe you were never presented with the opportunity to say Lord I'm taking you at your word even now you have a late answer on the sick you have a laid hands on the sick amen you know what I mean because some of you don't know what I'm saying so I'm going to pray to you personally then you can say no no no no all right we've got to take God's word and see ourselves as Disciples of the Lord Jesus now you've got to find the first opportunity presented to you and God will present opportunities to you day in your life you present opportunities to you but what are we doing with it you see fear said sin sometimes you at work or you wherever you are and somebody tells you oh I'm feeling so sick and I'm feeling so down and yes they are the witnessing opportunity and you tell them assistant brother the word of God declares that if I land upon the sick they shall recover can I pray for you but now we can't do that because we're electricity that work we haven't gone there Superman we've gone this Clark Kent do you understand what I'm saying we've got to work as Clark Kent hiding our identity yeah so now you think you need to go find a full moon do you know what I mean but if we arrive to work as Superman then you don't need to change your behavior change your circumstance because let me tell you what a few moments ago you were laughing at the dirty jokes you were talking nonsense with them I'm feeling sick now suddenly you think I'm like situential around this person right yes okay that's why I say you went there as Clark Kent but they need Superman now amen so yeah yes wait let's let's get this basis now I've been speaking on this for a while but I just love the way the prophet explains it and then we'll close here right he says you say I've got faith the first thing you have to have basis for Faith now that's the word of God so we can read the word of God God says it yes I believe it he believes it here in his mind so all of us can say yes I'm reading the word I believe it it's in your mind you're saying yes I believe learn this concept now it's very important because sometimes this is why our prayers don't get answered but we've got a subconscious also and in that subconscious we disagree like here we are saying I believe I believe but here you're like yeah subconscious disagrees with it because when he starts to do it he's scared it won't happen and it won't that's right the prophet says when you're scared it won't that's right right he says like a man crossing the sea the man goes across the sea the real man that drives the ship he never sees where he's going he's down in the bowels of the ship the man in the angel room he's the engineer the man sitting here on the deck he takes he gives the orders from the man up in the Crow's Nest he says he will send down the word two knots to the left now the man down there he don't see what's going on on top right it's just the engine well if you would give it two knots to the right or what if he would just wouldn't give it at all then the man up here says go forward and he puts it in reverse you see what happens when there's a struggle between our mind and the subconscious and the Heart three people now he's talking about one upon the Crow's Nest right right on top we can see how far one was the commanding officer and one in the engine room but Jesus said who must believe the one in the engine room the one in if you believe in your heart the one in the engine room if you can get these three aligned the mind the subconscious the heart that's where he's going with this yeah right he says otherwise if there's confused signals going on like here what he's talking about they'll never get out the harbor that's the way the church is you're going this way and that way and this way and that way yet now when the man up in the closeness says Straight Ahead the man on the deck says straight ahead and the man down in the bottom says straight to the Head she's going to move amen I am not satisfied when I pray I pray and it's not answered then I do quick evaluation is my mind just believing is my heart believing is my subconscious believing here's the keys here's the tools to walk in perfect faith something is out of alignment and you need to bring it in alignment I'm saying don't be satisfied if your word is returning void to you that's not the image of the Son of God Amen you must be the one they come to running if they can't do it yeah if they can't Castle the demon you must be the one they come running to so three things must be in line Straight Ahead Straight Ahead Straight Ahead then she's going to move amen yeah he says When God Says buy his stripes you are healed the man receives it in his heart by his stripes we are healed the subconscience hacks back by his rights we are healed look out something is going to take place yes yes you're going forward nothing will stop it then you're in full Harmony and not away but okay what kind of waves come he'll never be contrary to your faith now some of us have been proclaiming that scripture but I Stripes I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed but what are we in full alignment he that confessed with his mouth how is the word spoken why he thought what is a thought expressed so the thought is where is it in your so you have the thought in your mind you're expressing it with your mouth and you're believing in your heart three things are aligned but he's saying if you are saying bye you Stripes I'm Healed but then your subconscious is not believing it he's saying if you can only get the two aligned together nothing can stop it them you're in full Harmony not a wave I don't care what kind of wave would come it will never be contrary to your faith you you watch yourself and see yourself like this you know when you believe the word of God so much sometimes you know in your heart you believe it but watch the battle raging in your head then the thing to do is quieten down and say Lord I'm a perfect peace in my heart right now I believe your word but yes Satan's trying to sow thoughts yeah but you said if I Believe In My Heart you shall have what you say right because remember the battle is going to be in the mind the prophet says you can't stop thoughts from coming through this mind but you can stop it from settling yes it's not so you speak to your body and you say Body Mind this thing is settled in mouth already so you can race and try and cause fear and anxiety and rage and worry and all of these things it's settled in my heart already I have already received it I'm waiting for my body to catch up to My Confession and if you really want to make the devil man go and tell everyone you are you so nothing tell them the guy who you went down and you take his uh pamphlet there he was telling me I'm here praise God I'm Healed you see you become like a fanatic you become like a lunatic amen Hallelujah you're going there to drive through in the McDonald's you're telling them Big Mac praise God I'm Healed come on now yes you see Faith requires a certain type of behavior and that behavior looks mad that behavior looks radical that behavior looks to be causing a stir and a problem the behavior will also make you maybe look made from the outside make you look like you're lying come on now come on church if you really want to see a move of God you need to change your behavior you need to even change your action and your worship you need to change everything about you praise is the key praise is the key to your Victory amen hallelujah so nothing can stop it I hope you're learning from these principles you just move right through on and on see but you've got to make everything in agreement with God's word then we move on when we got it all lined up and in agreement well that case if we say that case is too hard or that I know you try to believe up there but down in here you got you're a little scared about it he says so yeah he says you mustn't be scared right and he says he's taking the type of Tyson here what will a young man do for his Young Bride that he wants for his sweetheart he's blind don't do anything yes sir you want some nothing can stop him he's the only one I know that's uh interested in it earlier I think the other guys that came down here when a young man will do for his young bride yeah he is blind he'll do anything yes sir he wants her nothing can stop him he's going to heaven you know that same way if she tell you she like Trump yeah I didn't have any money and you rake up all your money just to go buy the chomper the same way believe the word of God believe the word of God like that do everything in your power to get faithful and believe God's word that's the way God did when he seen the church he loved it nothing was going to stop he was ready to give his life God moved down in a body of Flesh worthy the king of Heaven amen he was making folks to us amen so remember we're moving through the Journey of Faith a journey of faith our own Journey we are only using Abraham's Life as a type we're only using Abraham's Life as a title we're not really focusing on his life we are trying to see our life in there and seeing how shortcomings in there and seeing how reasoning can come in through Sarah and all of his unbeliefs and things but God is giving us a new name new name means a new nature and then the circumcision is the Holy Ghost right so remember we stopped on chapter 17 you can go read 18 19 20 and continue reading that story and see your life in that story see where you are in your faith Journey God is coming to drive up all unbelief from your life God won't leave you with unbelief God didn't leave Abraham and Sarah with unbelief with Ishmael God came to remove unbelief and say out of this bride out of you is a current expectation you shall reproduce his life you shall reproduce his life come on now you shall reproduce his life you mean me I shall be like Jesus yes I will be like Jesus amen I am life of his life born of his bone Spirit of his Spirit one of his word she is him when you see me you see Jesus amen that's the end
