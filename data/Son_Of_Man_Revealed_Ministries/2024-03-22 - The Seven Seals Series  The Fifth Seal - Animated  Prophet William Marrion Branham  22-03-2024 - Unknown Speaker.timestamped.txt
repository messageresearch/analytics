[0:00] now the fifth seal Begins the sixth
[0:02] chapter of Revelations the 9th verse and
[0:06] when he had opened the fifth seal I saw
[0:09] under the altar The Souls of them that
[0:12] were slain for the word of God and for
[0:16] the testimony which they held and they
[0:19] cried with a loud voice saying how
[0:24] long oh Lord holy and true does thou
[0:28] judge and avenge are blood on them that
[0:31] dwell on the earth and white robes were
[0:34] given un unto every one of them and it
[0:38] was said unto them that they should rest
[0:41] yet for a little season until their
[0:45] fellow servants also their Brethren that
[0:48] should be killed as they were should be
[0:53] fulfilled notice there is no mention of
[0:57] another Beast or a living
[1:00] living creature to this announcement of
[1:04] the fifth seal we know that see there's
[1:09] no living creature notice but here when
[1:12] we come to this fifth seal
[1:16] now there's there's there's no Rider
[1:19] Goes
[1:20] Forth and there's no Beast to
[1:25] announc that is that the mystery of the
[1:28] church ages are already finished at this
[1:32] time the mystery of the
[1:34] Antichrist is revealed at this time the
[1:39] Antichrist took his last
[1:41] ride and we found him on this pale horse
[1:45] mixed with these many colors and rides
[1:48] all the way into preditions right
[1:51] they're they're way in the church age
[1:53] the church absolutely is raptured at
[1:55] this time the church goes up in the
[1:58] fourth chapter of reev ations and does
[2:01] not return till it comes back with his
[2:03] King in the 19th Chapter but these seals
[2:07] here are revealing what has been what is
[2:11] and what will be see notice and the
[2:16] Antichrist all they them them
[2:19] Revelations and the presence of that
[2:22] ball of fire hanging there in a room to
[2:24] Oh
[2:25] Brother although I've seen it since a
[2:27] child every time it comes near me to
[2:30] alarms he almost puts in unconscious
[2:34] condition you never get used to it you
[2:37] can to
[2:39] Sacred now notice now in the ninth verse
[2:43] Souls under the
[2:46] altar now here's where I'm going to get
[2:48] some
[2:49] real uh
[2:52] disagrees but uh just watch just a
[2:55] minute just see I thought that too but
[2:57] it didn't come that way
[3:01] we've I've always thought that these
[3:03] Souls under the altar were the the the
[3:07] martyrs of the early church and I'm sure
[3:09] that well Dr Ur Smith and every one of
[3:12] them says it is see but I thought so
[3:15] myself but when the Holy Spirit showed
[3:18] the vision to it it
[3:21] wasn't it isn't the soul now who are
[3:24] these Souls that's the next thing who
[3:27] are they then if they're not the early
[3:29] church
[3:32] this is
[3:34] Israel that's to be saved as a
[3:37] nation all them that are
[3:41] predestinated that's Israel that's
[3:44] Israel itself for I would not Brethren
[3:48] that you should be ignorant of the
[3:52] mystery let's you should be wise in your
[3:55] own
[3:57] conceit are you
[4:00] the blindness in part is happened to
[4:04] Israel until the fullfilling fullness of
[4:08] the Gentiles become in as it is
[4:12] written there shall come out of Zion a
[4:15] deliverer and shall turn away
[4:18] ungodliness for
[4:20] Jacob what Israel was
[4:25] blinded for the very purpose of us being
[4:29] saved
[4:32] notice now I want you to watch this real
[4:36] close they were given
[4:39] robes they didn't
[4:41] have they were given robes white robes
[4:45] each one of them now the
[4:49] Saints now have already had one they get
[4:53] it
[4:54] here but there they were given robes and
[4:58] the Saints already had their and going
[5:00] on see see they had had not the this
[5:07] these um
[5:09] Souls understanding now that's under the
[5:11] altar why they were martyred by sinful
[5:15] man like
[5:16] Ian yeah see they're holding right on
[5:19] millions of it but they remain
[5:23] Jews now remember what was it they were
[5:27] killed for the word of God's sake
[5:31] not for the testimony of Christ did you
[5:33] understand that but remember the church
[5:35] come in also the martys of the church
[5:37] was far the word of God and the
[5:40] testimony of Jesus Christ how many know
[5:42] was that here all right now but these
[5:45] didn't have the testimony of Jesus
[5:47] Christ for the word of God and for the
[5:50] testimony which they H Jews and Hitler
[5:54] hated them so did I so did stalling all
[5:56] the rest of the
[5:58] world but they stay they true to what
[6:00] they believe and they killed them
[6:03] because they were
[6:05] [Music]
[6:08] Jews that's right and for the testimony
[6:11] they held they were
[6:13] martyred and here was Souls under the
[6:15] altar after the church had been gone now
[6:21] watch they had in their blindness
[6:25] martyred their
[6:27] Messiah and now they were a reaping bar
[6:31] they realized it they recognized Act is
[6:33] gone on they seen them when they come
[6:35] before the altar of God but now watch
[6:38] the grace of God comes to them and Jesus
[6:42] gives them each one a white robe
[6:46] right watch come over after the church
[6:49] is
[6:50] gone like Joseph did to his Brethren a
[6:54] TI look when Joseph stood there and when
[6:57] he finally he made himself knowing there
[6:59] with the
[7:00] altar his own
[7:03] Altar and his Palace is thrown
[7:06] Hallelujah he said everybody leave me
[7:09] amen his wife was over in the palace
[7:12] where the bride would be all right and
[7:14] he said to him he said don't you know
[7:18] me hey speaking Hebrew now I'm your
[7:22] brother
[7:24] J oh my they said n oh you're going to
[7:27] get us so wait a minute wait a minute
[7:29] God did that for a purpose had you to
[7:32] throw me out in order to save life
[7:36] Hallelujah there you
[7:39] are said don't don't be angry with
[7:41] yourselves remember Joseph said that
[7:43] which is a type of the 144,000 we'll get
[7:46] later see what he did he just run right
[7:49] quick to Benjamin fell on his neck and
[7:50] started hugging him his little brother
[7:52] that had been born into the family after
[7:55] he had been
[7:56] gone by his mother
[8:01] the first church the Orthodox Church the
[8:05] 144,000 were born in his abs while he's
[8:09] awake get his
[8:12] Gentile oh my don't that just do
[8:14] something to you so you see who they are
[8:17] there they are these Jews
[8:21] 144,000 is to be called out by the two
[8:26] witnesses of Revelations 11
[8:30] now you remember they was to prophesy
[8:32] notice these
[8:34] souls are to wait a little season for
[8:39] the 144 to be
[8:41] martyred oh isn't that isn't that this
[8:44] puts the Bible together well listen I
[8:46] just got something to tell you it's just
[8:47] so good it's just burning right in my
[8:49] heart I hope you haven't forgotten
[8:52] see let me say this in the presence of
[8:55] him by his grace
[9:00] he also let me see my people not long
[9:03] ago in white
[9:05] RS you
[9:08] remember you remember the story not long
[9:12] ago the Gentile
[9:15] bride they're there now they're always
[9:18] in white robes to god notice this
[9:22] now now if there's no alar of
[9:27] sacrifice in heaven where is the
[9:30] sacrifice for sin
[9:33] laying the
[9:38] lamb there has to be a place where that
[9:40] slaying lamb bloody is laying there or
[9:44] the blood is or I do think brother by
[9:46] the opening of this fifth
[9:49] seal as I believe that it's
[9:52] open I did it with good
[9:56] conscience with clear Revelation before
[9:58] God
[10:00] not trying to just make it think because
[10:02] I always was against the organization
[10:04] never would belong to him but it's open
[10:07] to me
[10:09] now
