[10:01] we pray the lord give them safe
[10:02] traveling mercies amen and also pray for
[10:06] brother pat nicholson this morning he is
[10:08] preaching out of pasadena this morning
[10:10] amen let's pray the lord bless them
[10:12] there this morning amen so preach your
[10:15] our visitors mommy's normal visitor has
[10:18] been with us for so long
[10:21] amen no stranger so this morning we have
[10:24] a serious question to ask you
[10:27] amen
[10:28] the question
[10:31] you'll find as we read in our scripture
[10:33] and only you can answer the question
[10:35] this morning
[10:37] amen let's turn to our bibles matthew
[10:39] chapter 11
[10:40] we'll be speaking
[10:42] for a title i want to take from branham
[10:44] to me
[10:45] no not me
[10:48] i'm not making this about myself but you
[10:50] put yourself into me
[10:52] from branham to me a turning point in
[10:54] the ministry
[10:56] and the question we want to ask is
[10:59] are you the one or do we look for
[11:01] another
[11:03] amen
[11:04] we don't come to church to tickle our
[11:06] years
[11:07] amen we come here to check up
[11:10] whether we are right with god
[11:12] so an important question let's read
[11:14] matthew 11
[11:16] from verse one
[11:17] amen and it came to pass when jesus had
[11:20] made an end of commanding his twelve
[11:22] disciples
[11:24] he departed dance to teach and to preach
[11:26] in their cities now when john had heard
[11:29] in the prison the works of christ
[11:32] so there's a ministry being
[11:34] with john's disciples they are taking a
[11:36] word back to john
[11:39] and they are testifying about the works
[11:41] of jesus
[11:43] and his heart
[11:44] is in prison he heard the words of
[11:47] christ
[11:48] notice now the works of christ because
[11:51] christ means the anointed one
[11:54] and christ is still present tense
[11:57] he still has anointed ones in the end
[11:59] time
[12:02] he said two of his disciples and he said
[12:04] unto him
[12:05] are thou here that should come
[12:08] or do we look for another
[12:11] now if if there was a question put to
[12:13] the head
[12:14] there's a question being put to the body
[12:16] this morning
[12:18] are you the one amen or should we look
[12:21] for another
[12:22] this is not playing time
[12:24] and what's your answer and our response
[12:28] the question is not being asked to the
[12:30] church this morning it's being asked to
[12:32] individuals this morning
[12:35] amen
[12:36] now jesus let's watch our lovely lord
[12:38] jesus our head answered and jesus
[12:41] answered and said unto them
[12:43] go and show john again those things
[12:46] which you hear and which you see amen go
[12:49] prophesy back to him amen
[12:53] amen
[12:54] the blind received their sights
[12:58] the lame walk
[13:00] the leopards are cleansed
[13:02] the death here
[13:03] the dead are raised up
[13:05] and the poor have the gospel preached to
[13:08] them
[13:09] there must be a physical manifestation
[13:12] jesus is not taking them back to the
[13:14] word
[13:15] and saying look the word is being
[13:16] preached
[13:17] he is showing them the signs and the
[13:20] wonders because these signs shall follow
[13:22] them that believe
[13:24] [Music]
[13:25] amen
[13:27] and jesus is saying and blessed is he
[13:30] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[13:33] amen may the lord have blessings to the
[13:35] reading of his word
[13:36] you may be seated
[13:39] why is jesus saying blessed is he who
[13:42] shall not be offended in me
[13:44] you remember when he went to galilee
[13:47] and he began to do signs and wonders
[13:49] amongst them he went back to his
[13:51] hometown
[13:52] and they were offended and astonished at
[13:55] his doctrine and his teaching and they
[13:57] asked the question isn't this the son of
[14:00] joseph
[14:01] we know his brothers and his sisters
[14:05] amen
[14:06] and the bible says they were offended as
[14:10] he
[14:11] and jesus is saying blessed are you who
[14:14] are not offended in me
[14:16] amen amen
[14:18] now
[14:20] a question like we said now we're taking
[14:22] it from branham to me
[14:24] a turning point in the ministry
[14:28] all things are not continuing the same
[14:31] since branham fell asleep
[14:34] the church is on the move
[14:36] amen the question is are you a part of
[14:39] the church of jesus christ
[14:41] amen or are you stagnant i'm just
[14:44] satisfied with life
[14:46] satisfied with pretending
[14:50] amen
[14:52] satisfied with coming to a message
[14:54] church
[14:55] but no real manifestation no real zeal
[14:59] to serve god
[15:01] satisfied with coming to your sermon
[15:05] we are to be a living sermon amen amen
[15:09] amen
[15:10] hallelujah
[15:13] now just for a little background i want
[15:15] to go into this quote the prophet and
[15:17] watching how he can separate ministries
[15:21] and not take on ministries that are not
[15:23] years this is just for my foundation
[15:26] now brother branham here is telling he
[15:28] was coming in down the road the other
[15:30] day and there was something happened
[15:32] that spoke to me
[15:33] about the thing that i must do
[15:36] and it's not my message
[15:42] yes
[15:43] from verse 8 is not his message
[15:48] 10 7 is his message yes
[15:51] [Music]
[15:52] amen that is why it doesn't go past
[15:55] verse seven amen
[15:58] is everybody in agreement
[16:00] don't sit in one day here this morning
[16:02] amen hallelujah don't i behind i've got
[16:05] the holy ghost without sensation
[16:08] because the same prophet who said that
[16:10] he's the same one who said the holy
[16:12] ghost in you will punctuate every word
[16:14] of god with an amen
[16:17] amen amen
[16:19] hallelujah
[16:21] he says it's not my message
[16:25] amen what she says now leo mercer one of
[16:28] his friends said brother branham the
[16:29] time will come
[16:31] he said about five or six years ago
[16:33] maybe seven the lord is going to change
[16:35] your ministry brother branham
[16:37] sounds like he's prophesying over his
[16:39] life
[16:40] and he says when he does you probably
[16:42] just line up hospitals and speak them
[16:45] out of beds and things
[16:47] sounds like a powerful ministry doesn't
[16:49] it
[16:50] sounds like a thing to attain for
[16:53] but watch the prophet now he says it
[16:55] didn't sound right
[16:57] amen
[16:58] although i believe brother liu was
[17:00] trying to be sincere about it and that's
[17:02] the problem sometimes we are too sincere
[17:05] but it's not god speaking
[17:08] amen
[17:10] amen he says but it didn't sound right
[17:13] because our lord jesus never did that
[17:16] amen
[17:18] amen
[17:20] and he went to the hospitals there was
[17:22] one in that hospital do you remember
[17:24] where it was in the bible the pool of
[17:26] bethesda
[17:27] he said great multitudes of important
[17:30] people laid there amen crippled lame
[17:33] blind wizard waiting for the angel
[17:37] now that was in a spiritual hospital
[17:40] where people waited on divine healing
[17:42] and here the divine healer himself came
[17:46] and healed one and walked out
[17:48] we would have thought jesus was being
[17:50] rude
[17:51] we would have thought we made
[17:52] preparation to come in
[17:55] and yeah he healed one person and walked
[17:57] away
[17:58] we would have got offended at jesus
[18:04] now watch very important statement the
[18:06] prophet makes here
[18:07] you couldn't expect a mortal man
[18:10] or a ministry to come forth
[18:13] that would be greater than that was
[18:17] right hello
[18:20] brandonites in the message hear me well
[18:24] brandon was not greater than christ
[18:28] because the prophet is saying
[18:31] you can't get one greater than jesus
[18:33] christ
[18:37] it says you can't expect a mortal man
[18:41] or ministry to come forth would be any
[18:44] greater than that was
[18:46] see i couldn't agree with it
[18:49] jeffersonville hear me well
[18:52] we can't agree with that
[18:56] but as i started to turn around now
[18:59] watch the holy spirit speak
[19:01] the holy spirit come upon me
[19:03] this is another time he picked up his
[19:05] pen and he wrote
[19:06] he says i asked leo for a pen i got a
[19:09] piece of paper and i wrote it
[19:11] it's in this trailer today
[19:14] if you ever got up where it's at it's an
[19:17] old aluminium trailer where i was low
[19:20] out of the loading outfit just as you go
[19:22] in the door there's a shelf right on the
[19:24] right-hand side right in front of the
[19:27] trailer it's laying under there
[19:30] if that trailer still exists you can
[19:32] find it
[19:34] probably not right
[19:36] they probably made it a rally
[19:38] i laid it up there and said someday you
[19:40] can pull this out watch what he wrote
[19:43] god will never change the ministry
[19:46] but he will change the man with the
[19:48] ministry
[19:51] that's amen
[19:55] make that personal this morning
[19:58] because we are laboring to tell you
[20:00] that you are john who has asked to take
[20:02] the book
[20:03] and if you in your mind you are saying
[20:05] but i'm not i'm not ready to take the
[20:07] book god will change you
[20:10] and make you ready for that ministry
[20:13] because that word must come to pass amen
[20:16] yes hallelujah he says god will never
[20:20] change the ministry
[20:21] revelation 10 8-11 is a ministry yes
[20:24] amen
[20:26] but he will change the man
[20:28] he will change you and i am
[20:32] with the ministry
[20:37] that's what's to be done
[20:42] i know what i've got to do he says i
[20:44] can't do it in the condition that i am
[20:46] now right
[20:49] how many of you can say that this
[20:50] morning
[20:52] hello
[20:56] can you do it in the condition we are in
[20:59] so caught up with the things of life
[21:03] amen
[21:04] the boss asked you to do something
[21:06] you'll ask him how high
[21:08] god asked you to do something you go on
[21:10] a wall
[21:12] like jonah
[21:14] amen
[21:18] he says something has got to happen with
[21:20] me that will take god to do it
[21:23] amen we don't depend upon our human
[21:25] ability
[21:27] we know it's god gonna do it amen
[21:30] but we got to surrender our lives
[21:33] this is no plain thing
[21:36] amen now god rearranged his word for
[21:38] each age
[21:40] how many if you can say amen to them
[21:42] god rearranged the word for each age
[21:46] and he fought against men for each age
[21:49] that through the man the world would be
[21:51] fulfilled in that age amen
[21:53] and every time he sent his word he
[21:55] predestined a man to manifest that word
[21:58] amen
[22:00] if we look at
[22:01] moses in genesis 15 13
[22:04] yeah the lord is talking to abram
[22:07] and he's telling him he said unto abram
[22:10] no officiality that thy seed shall be a
[22:13] stranger in the land that is not theirs
[22:17] before they even go into egypt god is
[22:19] prophesying
[22:21] god knows what's happening in your life
[22:23] before it happens
[22:27] he's saying they're going to go into a
[22:28] land that's not there that shall serve
[22:30] them
[22:31] and they shall afflict them there
[22:33] 400 years
[22:37] amen
[22:41] now they could have asked moses that
[22:42] question in that day are you the one
[22:45] or should we look for another right
[22:48] i would imagine they were they were
[22:50] there the general calls to ask moses
[22:51] that question
[22:53] because when he slew the egyptian he
[22:55] fled into the wilderness
[22:59] amen they were waiting for the
[23:01] deliverance
[23:02] and moses had shown them signs of being
[23:05] the fulfillment of that word
[23:07] but now moses was gone 40 years
[23:14] but know one thing this morning
[23:16] the prophecy of god will never fail
[23:20] things may be going on for 40 years and
[23:23] the trial is getting harder and under
[23:25] harder under the task masters
[23:28] the situation may be getting more worse
[23:31] in your life
[23:32] but hold on to the promise
[23:35] amen for in the appointed time
[23:38] in the appointed season the world that
[23:41] was promised to deliver you
[23:43] will be made flesh and the deliverance
[23:46] may come in the form of an 80 year old
[23:49] man walking with a stick in his hand
[23:52] a one-man invasion but that's god's
[23:55] chosen way to bring your deliverance
[24:00] amen amen amen
[24:06] that was one of the words that was
[24:08] predestinated god spoken in the time of
[24:11] abram and he said moses was coming
[24:15] didn't isaiah speak about john coming in
[24:18] john 40 and verse 3
[24:20] isaiah living way before john and he's
[24:23] prophesying through the spirit he's
[24:25] saying the voice of him that cried in
[24:27] the wilderness
[24:28] prepare he the way of the lord
[24:32] how did he know word for word what john
[24:34] the baptist was going to say
[24:36] amen god has already predestinated the
[24:39] things that will be coming out of your
[24:40] mouth
[24:43] don't be afraid to prophesy amen yes
[24:47] thank you god has pre-arranged the words
[24:50] god wrote it verbatim
[24:53] and when john stepped in on the scene
[24:55] he fulfilled that word and he said
[24:58] prepare hear the way of the lord
[25:01] make sweet pots
[25:02] [Music]
[25:04] and he added some grasshoppers
[25:06] and some vipers
[25:08] you snakes in the grass
[25:11] you vipers
[25:17] another prophet by the name of malachi
[25:20] in chapter 3 verse 1 prophesied and he
[25:23] says i will send my messenger and he
[25:26] shall prepare the way before me and the
[25:28] lord whom he seek
[25:30] yes
[25:32] shall suddenly come into his temple
[25:34] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[25:36] you delighted behold he shall come saint
[25:39] the lord of hosts
[25:43] these men were moved of the holy spirit
[25:45] amen they were tapping into the mind of
[25:47] christ
[25:48] amen and they were writing down
[25:51] prophesying about men who were appointed
[25:53] for an age yes amen
[25:56] even our lord jesus was prophesied by
[25:59] the prophet desire in israel 7 14 he
[26:02] says therefore the lord himself shall
[26:04] give you a sign
[26:07] behold a virgin shall conceive
[26:10] oh what a sign
[26:13] amen never been done before
[26:16] i'm gonna confound this world
[26:19] and bear his son and shall call his name
[26:22] emmanuel for unto us a child is born
[26:26] amen watch now he goes from prophecy
[26:30] to speaking it as if it happened
[26:35] yes amen what are you looking for in
[26:37] your life

[30:29] amen hallelujah to suit your requirement
[30:33] in order for the germination of the seed
[30:36] gene seed of god within you
[30:39] it's not designed for the flesh man
[30:41] forget about it
[30:43] the flesh man will rebel against this
[30:45] message it's too hard
[30:47] give me some pleasures of his life
[30:50] brother branham why is so hard
[30:55] amen
[30:57] amen
[30:58] it's not designed for the flesh man the

[31:06] tape off
[31:09] the flesh man we want to say oh brother
[31:11] brandon wasn't put too
[31:17] but that hard penetrates through the
[31:19] flesh
[31:20] [Music]
[31:22] and it's not even designed for the
[31:23] spirit man
[31:29] the spirit has
[31:31] memory
[31:33] reasoning
[31:35] affection
[31:37] imagination
[31:38] unconscious
[31:42] the message was designed to go past
[31:45] the second pole
[31:47] some of you went by there yes
[31:50] amen hey
[31:52] first pull
[31:53] took you by the hand
[31:55] he took the flesh man by the hand
[31:57] he had a sign in his hand
[31:59] second full he discerned their spirits
[32:03] he designed the hearts
[32:06] you happy with two poles
[32:08] third pool went into the soul amen
[32:12] where the gene of god is yes
[32:14] amen
[32:15] it's designed for them so when he lie to
[32:19] the prophet's message finds you
[32:22] you can rest assured
[32:25] you may be
[32:26] withholding back
[32:28] but if that gene seed is within you you
[32:30] can rest assured that if you receive him
[32:33] and his message
[32:35] with faith yes the result is going to be
[32:38] the same every time
[32:40] you're going to end up when it turned
[32:41] out
[32:43] because that's what his message is
[32:44] designed to do
[32:46] to turn your heart yes
[32:48] you say turn it where
[32:50] to original faith amen yes amen
[32:53] it was the job of elijah the prophet
[32:56] to turn your heart back to the original
[32:58] faith
[33:00] the apostolic faith
[33:02] it's not a manufactured faith
[33:04] amen it's not a replica of faith
[33:07] it's not an impersonation of faith
[33:11] but it's the original faith amen yes
[33:14] so much so that if peter and paul walked
[33:17] into this church this morning they must
[33:19] feel at home
[33:21] amen they must fight the same spirit
[33:24] that was there peter paul is here
[33:26] tonight this morning amen
[33:30] they shouldn't wonder what is the
[33:31] condition of this church
[33:34] but it should be a church on the move
[33:36] amen
[33:37] in fact they should feel like they've
[33:39] missed out on so much
[33:41] when they walk into the shirt they
[33:43] shouldn't feel like
[33:45] [Music]
[33:46] peter paul we got some work to do
[33:52] it should be original faith again
[33:55] hallelujah
[33:57] same signs same wonders same
[33:59] manifestation
[34:01] if it's not then it's not the same
[34:03] yesterday today and forever
[34:05] and then we have made it up in our minds
[34:06] that we are
[34:07] [Music]
[34:09] he neither is or he isn't and i know
[34:11] that he is amen amen without a shadow of
[34:15] a doubt
[34:16] look what the prophet is saying here now
[34:18] he says look here you're you're an
[34:20] outside man
[34:21] maybe we're going through this because i
[34:22] saw some unbelief when we said this just
[34:24] now you have five senses that contacts
[34:26] the outside body
[34:28] god gave you five senses
[34:30] i mean if you got five senses
[34:32] amen
[34:34] to contact your earthly home
[34:36] see chase feel smell here
[34:39] then you have the spirit on the inside
[34:40] of that and it has five outlets
[34:42] conscience love so forth five outlets
[34:45] that can contact the spirit world with
[34:47] that but with your spirit so physical
[34:50] context physical spiritual context
[34:53] spiritual ego is going on now
[34:55] right he says your physical context the
[34:58] physical spiritual context is spiritual
[35:01] but inside of that you got a soul
[35:06] and that soul is that gene that came
[35:08] from god
[35:10] do you have representation this morning
[35:12] amen
[35:15] now
[35:16] any seed needs to be germinated to life
[35:19] amen
[35:21] and the message of the hour
[35:24] is the only thing that can germinate
[35:26] that seed to life
[35:29] it's a ministry to call a pride for
[35:32] jesus christ out of the church world
[35:36] that's why he says
[35:38] come out of all my people
[35:40] and be not partakers of her sins
[35:43] it's a ministry to call you out
[35:47] now people ask can i be a part of the
[35:49] pride without accepting the ministry of
[35:52] william branham
[35:54] we say no
[36:02] if you want to appeal that
[36:04] the answer is still no
[36:08] you know these politicians
[36:11] like zuma and everybody they want to
[36:13] keep appealing
[36:14] you can go to the supreme court of
[36:16] appeal
[36:18] the answer is still no
[36:21] you can't be a part of the bride outside
[36:23] of this message yes
[36:25] and if that hurts you
[36:27] i'm sorry i can't help you i can't
[36:29] change my statement
[36:33] amen
[36:34] the modern preachers
[36:36] of today
[36:39] cannot do it
[36:40] billy graham couldn't do it in his day
[36:42] oral roberts couldn't do it in his day a
[36:45] allen couldn't do it in his day
[36:47] and the modern preachers of today can't
[36:50] do it in this day
[36:52] they can't put you into the bride
[36:55] only one man and his message is designed
[36:57] to do that yes amen
[37:00] amen jimmy swaggart couldn't do it
[37:05] paul washer can't do it
[37:10] hey man james dobson robbie zacharias
[37:14] amen teeny snakes
[37:17] i'm smiling joel
[37:21] joseph prince
[37:23] boshuri
[37:24] whom an angel
[37:28] there's only one man in his message that
[37:30] will call this bride
[37:32] amen
[37:33] like eliezer
[37:35] sent by abraham
[37:37] to find a bride for isaac
[37:40] one man was sent in this day to call out
[37:43] a pride for the lord jesus christ
[37:48] amen now watch eliza was not relying on
[37:51] his own human ability
[37:53] he went to pray immediately
[37:55] he was going to find icky wife
[37:58] but rebecca was already chosen for isaac
[38:03] how many of you know eliza didn't go
[38:04] find her
[38:06] he located her there's a difference
[38:08] between finding and locating
[38:12] if i tell you go and find something
[38:14] you can bring me back anything
[38:16] but if i tell you to go locate this
[38:18] person
[38:19] that person already exists
[38:22] amen
[38:23] why
[38:24] didn't
[38:25] the lord tell elise i'll send my angel
[38:27] before you amen
[38:30] right so through prayer and supernatural
[38:32] assistance from the angel of god that
[38:34] went before him he was led to the well
[38:38] and according to his prayer he located
[38:40] rebecca
[38:42] his prayer was the one which
[38:44] he says the one who give me to drink and
[38:46] my camels to drink she will be the one
[38:48] that you have chosen amen
[38:55] so the one who responds to the message
[38:57] of the hour
[38:58] it's a sign and a vindication that you
[39:01] were already chosen amen
[39:04] to believe it
[39:06] why every time there's a deep there's
[39:08] got to be a deep within you to respond
[39:10] to the deep amen
[39:13] rebecca was not eliezer's choosing
[39:16] i'm saying it again
[39:18] the bride was not brandon's choosing
[39:21] you were not chosen on your good
[39:22] behavior on your moral standing
[39:28] he was just being used by abraham and
[39:31] god to do the work of calling out a
[39:33] bride from the midst of babylon was she
[39:35] in babylon
[39:36] he was calling her from the midst of
[39:38] babylon and providing her
[39:41] watch now
[39:44] he provided her with gifts did he not
[39:46] give her gifts yes
[39:48] hello yes
[39:50] he gave a gift
[39:53] did god not when he ascended i gave us
[39:55] gifts
[39:58] he gave us gifts
[40:00] and
[40:02] what's the second thing he gave up
[40:06] hello
[40:07] god this is a tie
[40:09] this is not just a story he gave her
[40:11] gifts
[40:13] and he gave her transportation
[40:18] amen
[40:19] he's given us the fireform ministry from
[40:22] branham
[40:23] to pass the teacher apostle
[40:26] amen
[40:30] and
[40:32] he's providing us transportation
[40:34] to change dimensions
[40:37] one of these days
[40:39] we shall change dimensions
[40:42] now he says
[40:44] watch now here's the quote if you're
[40:46] wondering why i'm making that statement
[40:48] so strong and so bold he has the prophet
[40:50] himself telling you you can't get into
[40:52] the bride without his message
[40:56] he says that's why this
[40:58] the church age that we live in
[41:00] there's no church
[41:02] no methodist
[41:05] let's get the quote
[41:10] it's in the identified christ of all
[41:12] ages

[41:22] to the end of this but the killer wants
[41:23] to end the service
[41:34] you can find it in leadership paragraph
[41:36] 123 he says that's why this
[41:39] the church age that we live in what
[41:41] church age do we live in
[41:44] right remember the church yet is still
[41:46] going on
[41:47] but we have been called out of the
[41:48] church age and it's called the bride age
[41:50] yes amen he says no methodist
[41:54] baptist
[41:55] pentecostals or anything else

[42:00] it so it's the 7th of december paragraph
[42:04] 123

[42:09] the church age we live in there's no
[42:11] church no methodist no baptist
[42:14] pentecostals or anything else so he's
[42:17] grouping all denominations yes
[42:20] including the denominations in the
[42:22] message two lords and all of these
[42:24] things
[42:25] anything else can ever put this shirt
[42:27] into the bride
[42:30] can you read it
[42:31] can you see it
[42:33] he says none of them can put this church
[42:35] into the bride
[42:37] it'll have to be the answering of who
[42:40] td jake
[42:42] who
[42:52] for god to send a prophet to be revealed
[42:55] to
[42:56] because that's the one of the ways
[43:00] sorry
[43:02] it's the only way
[43:04] give god praise
[43:08] you are not sitting here by chance this
[43:10] morning
[43:11] it is the only way
[43:13] this is the way jesus spoke about when
[43:15] he said i am the way
[43:17] no man can come to my father but through
[43:20] me
[43:22] yes
[43:23] now can the body say that this morning
[43:26] you can't get to the father but through
[43:29] this message yes amen
[43:33] amen let's find the identified christ of
[43:36] all ages
[43:38] paragraph 157
[43:42] now you
[43:44] we are saying we're just going to read
[43:45] to read this we are saying brother
[43:47] brandon you're telling me brother
[43:49] branham is william branham is the art
[43:50] turner he's going to turn my heart but
[43:53] to what i want to get it straight from
[43:55] the prophet
[43:56] so
[43:57] with younger people who's never seen the
[43:58] quotes you can now see it
[44:00] because this must also be established in
[44:02] your hearts
[44:04] amen
[44:07] paragraph 157 we got it brother caleb
[44:10] okay he says i want to ask you something
[44:12] i said and read out of the scripture
[44:14] that he is the same yesterday today and
[44:16] forever and just temporarily haven't
[44:19] primarily done it yet showed you that
[44:21] he's supposed to get this very same
[44:23] thing again in the last days how many
[44:26] believes that malachi 4 and all of it is
[44:29] supposed to return right back again
[44:32] him again come down and identify himself
[44:34] in a prophetic message
[44:37] to turn the hearts of the children back
[44:40] to the faith
[44:41] then he describes the faith apostolic
[44:44] faith
[44:45] pentecostal faith
[44:47] of the fathers
[44:48] that's exactly what is supposed to be
[44:50] done
[44:52] not some creed but back to the original
[44:55] faith
[44:57] now we believe that with all of our
[44:59] heart
[45:00] amen
[45:02] now if you go to the nigerians and
[45:04] you're buying your levi's even though
[45:06] you've got attack called levi's in your
[45:08] heart you know you are not wearing
[45:10] genuine
[45:13] even when that person compliments your
[45:15] tell you that's a nice genes you got and
[45:17] you're telling him thank you
[45:19] you know you're being an hypocrite
[45:23] because you're taking a compliment based
[45:24] on a fake
[45:26] [Music]
[45:28] am i right
[45:33] but we do not have
[45:36] a duplicate
[45:38] we do not have an impersonation didn't
[45:40] brother graham say there will be no
[45:42] impersonation to this
[45:44] the third poll he said there'll be no
[45:46] impersonation
[45:48] amen
[45:49] now let's get to revelation 10 7.
[45:52] amen
[45:53] so malachi 4
[45:55] sent to you
[45:57] you can try to hide
[45:59] you can be trapped in some hindu system
[46:01] your national system he was sent to you
[46:07] he will find you that you will find you
[46:09] whether it's through the fivefold he
[46:10] will find you
[46:13] and you will turn your heart back that's
[46:15] his ministry
[46:17] that scripture can't fail
[46:20] then
[46:21] revelation 10 7 says but in the days of
[46:24] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[46:26] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[46:29] should be finished
[46:32] and we want to say finish the cloud
[46:37] yes amen
[46:38] it's finish the clown
[46:42] [Music]
[46:54] [Music]
[46:55] amen
[46:57] that scripture is finished
[46:59] amen the mystery of god is already
[47:02] revealed
[47:04] yes amen we know the mystery of god
[47:07] and how he was a the spirit and out of
[47:10] that great eternal function of being
[47:13] went forth in light called the logos
[47:15] amen amen
[47:17] and that logos was called the son of god
[47:20] hallelujah amen
[47:23] and now he further condescended
[47:25] amen
[47:27] became
[47:28] mercy
[47:29] yes yes from spirit he became worth
[47:32] mercy and from kansas he became flesh
[47:35] which is jesus christ
[47:40] but then
[47:41] further mystery remember the mystery of
[47:43] god if jesus christ is a further
[47:46] revelation of the mystery of god
[47:48] then jesus christ has a hidden mystery
[47:50] locked up inside of him
[47:56] some of you need water to swallow that
[48:00] is it too big a pill
[48:02] then you become part of that mystery of
[48:04] god in revelation 10 7
[48:07] then what is it really telling you
[48:10] that this revelation 10 angel
[48:13] is going to unlock
[48:14] who you really are
[48:16] that you are really a part of the garden
[48:20] because like added eve was locked up in
[48:22] adam and the two were one flesh yes
[48:26] you were taken out of the side of the
[48:28] cross amen
[48:29] so christ is the mystery of god revealed
[48:33] and the bride is the mystery of christ
[48:36] revealed amen
[48:39] amen
[48:40] you're saying brother adrian why are you
[48:42] giving meat this morning
[48:44] chew on it amen yes it may feel like
[48:47] bull tongue but chewing it this morning

[54:22] i prefer it this way
[54:26] this may have been the original way

[54:31] but this is the original way
[54:34] the designer designed it to be looked at
[54:38] amen
[54:40] hallelujah
[54:42] what is he saying
[54:44] almost like the real thing so in the
[54:47] last days now you see it's

[55:09] what he says
[55:11] this is not lose his age
[55:13] so you can't smoke your pipe
[55:16] you can't drink
[55:18] you can't persecute the jews
[55:23] this is not pentecost age yes
[55:27] hello
[55:30] what age is it this is
[55:32] bright age
[55:34] as moses called a nation out of a nation
[55:37] christ today is calling a church out of
[55:39] a church you see the same thing in type
[55:42] taking them to the glorious
[55:44] eternal
[55:46] promised land amen amen
[55:49] now don't miss this
[55:54] he says to refuse the person that's
[55:57] doing the calling
[55:59] and he
[56:00] comma who
[56:02] christ
[56:04] now christ is the anointed one
[56:07] he is the manifested one
[56:09] so we said god allotted his word for
[56:11] each age at one time it was christ in
[56:15] moses
[56:16] so was he the christ
[56:18] yes come on now yes was moses the christ
[56:21] was john the baptist to christ
[56:23] amen and then jesus was the christ
[56:26] the bible says he was born the christ
[56:29] two lords say he was made lord in christ
[56:32] but simeon when he's there in the temple
[56:34] he said i thank you lord that i have
[56:35] seen
[56:38] christ the lord
[56:40] hello
[56:45] amen

[56:57] but christ means the anointed one
[56:59] so was branham the anointed one yes amen
[57:02] yes
[57:04] so let's read that again he says
[57:08] to refuse the person that's doing the
[57:10] calling christ
[57:13] no matter if you're pentecostal
[57:15] methodist luther whatever you are
[57:18] this angel nothing against them not not
[57:20] at all but in this age now you've got to
[57:23] accept like they did in that day the
[57:25] person of christ which is the word amen
[57:31] now i'm going to break it down for you
[57:32] and bring it further
[57:36] you are christ in this day
[57:38] yes
[57:41] amen
[57:43] now he says they've got to accept you
[57:46] that is why john in verse 11 of
[57:48] revelation 10
[57:50] thou must prophesy again
[57:59] [Music]
[58:03] thomas watch manchester united lose

[58:37] when they're supposed to be laying in
[58:38] the presence of the sun
[58:40] to mature that

[58:45] ask yourself the life that you are
[58:47] living this is not ended in any
[58:48] individual i'm asking you to each one
[58:50] check their lives
[58:52] what is different from you and a
[58:53] denominational person

[59:02] watch the same movies they do
[59:06] love the same things they do
[59:08] the bible says if you love the world

[59:15] no no is there in the seventh seal
[59:22] message believers love soccer
[59:28] message believers
[59:30] and we say that's things of god these
[59:32] are things of god

[59:50] now
[59:52] people are looking at their watches
[59:54] saying isn't it about time to close the
[59:55] service
[59:58] but the bible says if you love the world
[1:00:01] all the things of the world
[1:00:04] the love of god is not even in you
[1:00:08] people can fuss and fight
[1:00:12] but let somebody say something against
[1:00:13] this message
[1:00:15] yes
[1:00:17] amen let them tell something about your
[1:00:19] team

[1:00:49] but have you come to meet with christ
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:54] it says the eighth nothing against them
[1:00:56] not at all but the age you've got to
[1:00:58] accept
[1:00:59] the person of christ which is the word
[1:01:02] and he breaks it down in the beginning
[1:01:04] was the word the word was with god the
[1:01:06] word was god and the word was made flesh
[1:01:08] and dwelt amongst them i want to tell
[1:01:11] the people of the world this morning the
[1:01:13] world is made fleshless today and it's
[1:01:15] dwelling amongst you but you are
[1:01:17] rejecting it
[1:01:20] because a true sign is overlooked
[1:01:24] because it's in the form of a bride
[1:01:28] he says what life luther had was
[1:01:30] justification
[1:01:31] wesleyan sanctification added to it the
[1:01:35] pentecost led restoration of the gifts
[1:01:37] coming back
[1:01:38] in it
[1:01:39] added to it but now it's completing in
[1:01:42] the body you see the three phases of it
[1:01:46] so there's three phases of it and then
[1:01:47] he says and out of that
[1:01:50] that is why we sing that song these
[1:01:52] three stages
[1:01:55] changing me
[1:01:58] into the formed word image
[1:02:01] coming out of
[1:02:05] amen that
[1:02:07] when the resurrection comes
[1:02:10] the life that lived in them lutherans
[1:02:12] that went out the life that lived in the
[1:02:14] methodist went out and the life that
[1:02:16] went into the pentecostals will all be
[1:02:19] raptured
[1:02:20] out of the ground
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:23] and this is your reward for being
[1:02:24] obedient
[1:02:25] you will be raptured out of the ground
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:32] in the body of the bride to be taken in
[1:02:34] before jesus christ glory to god
[1:02:38] he says it's exciting
[1:02:41] amen do you feel excited amen
[1:02:44] and he says it's the
[1:02:46] truth oh listen to the statement now
[1:02:50] we've turned the corner
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:54] lutherans baptist methodists all these
[1:02:57] full gospel churches are not on our
[1:02:59] level
[1:03:00] yes
[1:03:04] he says we have turned a corner
[1:03:08] where we going brother branham we're
[1:03:11] looking towards heaven
[1:03:13] hallelujah watching
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:22] people don't want to say that
[1:03:24] watching for the what
[1:03:27] wait the cap on the pyramid as we would
[1:03:30] say he is coming back
[1:03:33] the church must be resurrected soon and
[1:03:36] we must be ready amen are we ready this
[1:03:40] morning amen
[1:03:42] amen hallelujah
[1:03:45] oh we better be ready amen let's move
[1:03:47] quickly revelation 10 8 let's read this
[1:03:50] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:03:51] spake unto me again and said go take the
[1:03:54] little book which is open in the end of
[1:03:56] the angel would stand it upon the sea
[1:03:58] and upon the earth
[1:04:00] and i went unto the angel
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:04] and
[1:04:06] said unto him give me the little book
[1:04:09] and he said unto me take it
[1:04:11] and eat it up and it shall be make thy
[1:04:14] belly bitter and it shall be in thy
[1:04:16] mouth sweet as honey and i took the
[1:04:19] little book out of the angel's hand
[1:04:22] and ate it up
[1:04:25] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:04:28] and as as soon as i had heated it my
[1:04:31] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:04:35] when you find time
[1:04:37] in your busy schedule
[1:04:39] go and prophesy
[1:04:45] and he said unto me
[1:04:47] when you have free time
[1:04:50] and he said unto me
[1:04:55] thou must
[1:04:56] prophesy again
[1:04:59] before many peoples
[1:05:01] and nations
[1:05:02] and tongues and kings
[1:05:06] hallelujah amen
[1:05:09] amen amen
[1:05:10] now closing with this now
[1:05:14] they asked jesus they have the question
[1:05:17] are you the one
[1:05:18] or do we look for another
[1:05:22] we are saying from branham to me a
[1:05:24] turning point in the ministry
[1:05:27] then brother branham says we have turned
[1:05:29] the corner
[1:05:30] but the corner didn't go this way
[1:05:32] the corner went that way
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:41] that way he turned the corner upward
[1:05:44] because this message is taking us up
[1:05:46] amen did he say when he saw the preview
[1:05:49] of the bride
[1:05:50] that this last church when she came on
[1:05:52] around marching to the peat of onward
[1:05:55] christian soldiers
[1:05:56] he said she went about this way and he
[1:05:59] said she was exactly like that first
[1:06:01] shirt and he said she went onward and
[1:06:03] upward
[1:06:05] did he say that
[1:06:07] he said we've turned the corner
[1:06:09] so we are not on the same level as these
[1:06:11] denominations but we are seated in
[1:06:13] heavenly places in christ
[1:06:16] jesus now we could have asked brother
[1:06:19] branham are you the one and that's what
[1:06:21] they are asking
[1:06:24] are you the one sent
[1:06:26] are you elijah the prophet
[1:06:28] or do we look for another
[1:06:30] some have left went to look for another
[1:06:32] because they were not satisfied
[1:06:36] with what they were hearing that's right
[1:06:39] and i'm going to use this as a type
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:42] but it's no reflection of john
[1:06:45] john the baptist because john the
[1:06:46] baptist was saved
[1:06:48] but spiritually speaking where was john
[1:06:51] the baptist
[1:06:53] where was he
[1:06:55] come on now
[1:06:57] you know your bible where was john the
[1:06:59] baptist
[1:07:03] john the baptist was in prison
[1:07:07] and they sent message to jesus saying
[1:07:10] are you the one
[1:07:11] or should we look for another we read
[1:07:14] what jesus response was
[1:07:16] he showed them the physical
[1:07:17] manifestation of his ministry
[1:07:19] because works without faith is dead
[1:07:23] right spiritually speaking now
[1:07:26] these are souls that are imprisoned
[1:07:29] and they are asking are you the one
[1:07:32] is this the one to fulfill revelation 10
[1:07:35] or do we look for another mighty angel
[1:07:38] their mighty angel came down in
[1:07:40] revelation 9.
[1:07:42] put it up brother caleb for those that
[1:07:43] don't know what revelation 9 is
[1:07:46] why is john saying i saw another mighty
[1:07:49] angel
[1:07:50] where did he see another angel
[1:07:53] hello have you ever thought about that
[1:07:56] the scripture starts by saying i saw
[1:07:58] another mighty angel
[1:08:00] what is he saying here
[1:08:04] what is it
[1:08:10] who is that scar
[1:08:13] come on now people
[1:08:14] who is that star
[1:08:16] it's lucifer
[1:08:20] is lucifer in angel
[1:08:25] this is not a trick question
[1:08:27] it's a straightforward question
[1:08:29] yes
[1:08:31] he was the eyes of all the angels
[1:08:34] this is the angel
[1:08:36] that they saw coming down
[1:08:39] but he's falling like a star from heaven
[1:08:42] and through the earth
[1:08:44] and he's given keys to the bottomless
[1:08:46] pit
[1:08:48] they were not satisfied with this angel
[1:08:53] so they went to look for another angel
[1:09:00] amen and then revelation 10 7
[1:09:03] they're asking him is he the prophet of
[1:09:07] that was predicted to come
[1:09:10] and then he says look at the signs
[1:09:13] i came out amongst you
[1:09:15] i didn't come for your money
[1:09:17] i went on healing campaigns
[1:09:19] sacrificed seven nights at a time 14
[1:09:21] nights at a time
[1:09:23] slept there prayed for people till
[1:09:26] virtue left his body
[1:09:27] went into the second pool of his
[1:09:29] ministry
[1:09:31] amen they abused his ministry
[1:09:33] used it for their own gain
[1:09:35] used it just for the healing
[1:09:37] but then he turned his back towards them
[1:09:41] and he deserved their hearts
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:46] and they were astonished at his ministry
[1:09:50] and many of them walked away
[1:09:54] because
[1:09:55] they
[1:09:56] were
[1:09:58] offended
[1:10:02] what do they tell you you are not called
[1:10:04] to preach
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:10] now
[1:10:11] here's a question we're going to close
[1:10:12] with
[1:10:14] john asked to take the book
[1:10:18] john ate the book
[1:10:20] so
[1:10:21] who holds the evidence of the book
[1:10:24] the one who ate the book
[1:10:27] right
[1:10:28] so the question is being put to the body
[1:10:30] now
[1:10:31] are you the one
[1:10:33] who's got the book yes
[1:10:36] or do we look for another
[1:10:41] then
[1:10:41] what are you going to say like jesus
[1:10:45] jesus gave them an answer
[1:10:47] who tells john
[1:10:49] the sick are healed
[1:10:50] the dead are raised
[1:10:52] the gospel the poor have the gospel
[1:10:54] preached to them
[1:10:55] the lepers are healed
[1:10:57] you can't just say yes
[1:11:00] i'm the one and
[1:11:01] don't look for another
[1:11:04] where is the manifestation in your life
[1:11:09] individual work now
[1:11:10] where is the manifestation in your life
[1:11:16] where is the evidence of your life but
[1:11:18] don't don't be responding now
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:21] you are the one
[1:11:22] that's eating the book remember what we
[1:11:23] read god will change the man to fit the
[1:11:26] ministry
[1:11:28] yes
[1:11:29] god will change you
[1:11:31] if you have not been living up to it
[1:11:34] maybe you got distracted along the way
[1:11:36] maybe the influence of later sea has got
[1:11:38] a grip on you but tomorrow if i phone
[1:11:41] you young man
[1:11:42] and i tell you i cannot make it brother
[1:11:45] she's sick or pray for him
[1:11:47] what are you going to do
[1:11:50] how are you going to fumble
[1:11:51] are you going to
[1:11:52] stumble
[1:11:54] but these signs shall follow them they

[1:13:43] being poured on the earth
[1:13:46] under the sportos rider all of heaven
