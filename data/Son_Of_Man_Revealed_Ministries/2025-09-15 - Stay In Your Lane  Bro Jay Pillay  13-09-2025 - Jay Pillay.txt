========================================

Um I wonder if you can turn Amen to chapter 26 2 Chronicles. You know I say this on the onset of the service. Uh many of us sometimes don't understand the difference between a preacher uh a minister a minister and and a preacher very close you know in the calling and a pastor. The difference about a pastor beside taking care of the flock, you'll find that a preacher will be able to preach a message today here and tomorrow he can preach a message in another church. But the poor pastor every week has to feed his flock with something new. When I say new, I mean the word of God, &gt;&gt; but something different from last week &gt;&gt; or from the week previous. &gt;&gt; So that's a big difference. &gt;&gt; So the burden lies a lot on a pastor &gt;&gt; and the support can get from his congregation is very very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So do understand that there's a difference. For me it's easier because I preached this message uh other places. So this morning you hearing it the first time and be privileged this morning to feed upon God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to bring greetings um from u raine Christian assembly and also brother Nami told me I must greet the church this morning. supposed to uh minister. I were not sure uh what was happening but they wanted me to minister but I mentioned to brother Nami that it's been some times that I ever been here in Phoenix &gt;&gt; and I know the last time you know I was here and and I ministered it's very long and this morning I I take this you know as a privilege to be here together you know in this assembly and to minister God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then shall we turn to chapter 26 of 2 Chronicles? Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me with some of the names that are so difficult to pronounce, but you would read it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "Then all the people of Judah took us &gt;&gt; who was 16 years old and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. After the father died, the son took uh the leadership being the king, &gt;&gt; the highest leadership, you know, in a uh he is to be a king. And we go to verse four just because of time it's quite a lengthy subject uh to see the life of Isaiah. So I'll be skipping in between verse four. And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father Amaziah did. And he sought God in the days of Zechariah who had understanding in the visions of God. And as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper. You may take your seats. I'm going to read continue reading. &gt;&gt; Uh but you can take your seats this morning. Amen. You see this morning, I want to say it this way that it is your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That proves what you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. The prophet of God says then the queen of Sheba, it is your life that proves what you are. &gt;&gt; Are your brides material &gt;&gt; or what are you? Amen this morning. &gt;&gt; So let us look at ourselves this morning not at the next person so much and let us you know let God have his own way. We were talking about grace and the brother sang the song. I really took it to to heart of the words from the song &gt;&gt; and he spoke about grace there also. It took the grace of God. It took the grace of God. Jesus Christ died and that made the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. We were talking about you know having the grace of God is so important in our life. &gt;&gt; Now what is the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do we think about it? What is the grace of God? &gt;&gt; If there was no Calvary there wouldn't be the grace of God. &gt;&gt; He took Calvary and in Calvary there was a death that took place. And this morning there must be a death that must take place in ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just want to speak a little on eternal life this morning. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is not this life that you and I are living. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If I ask you, you know, I mean, why are you living? The true answer is I'm living for a better life. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no other reason. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are here this morning &gt;&gt; preparing for a better life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the life when you lose a loved one and then you get down depressed and &gt;&gt; you are lost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It is the feelings of this body that manifest itself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you feel so bad. But we talking about another life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A life that's going to be eternal. &gt;&gt; And nothing can replace that life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that is why you are here this morning is to make ready for that life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are preparing for that life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. It is a new birth and a change of art that changes a man from a dying being &gt;&gt; to a resurrected immortal son of God, &gt;&gt; taking his place on the seat of the believer's heart. &gt;&gt; It's a nature change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this nature change is from this life to eternal life. Yes. &gt;&gt; So a year for a time period. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of these days that time period will expire &gt;&gt; and you're gone. &gt;&gt; So how much are we doing to make ready for that life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we look at the cross of Calvary, we see something amazing that happened. &gt;&gt; It took the innocent to become you and me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh yes. Now I'm not preaching salvation this morning &gt;&gt; but I'm preaching true salvation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Salvation the way we have to look at it &gt;&gt; as message believers. &gt;&gt; Change of life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know I always think about these great men that were being in this world. Really they were great men. You think of Mandela, you think of Mahatma Gandhi. They were great men. &gt;&gt; They were great. They were powerful men. And we must appreciate for the changes that they made. &gt;&gt; We must be thankful in this mortal flesh. They made life a little much better than what it was before that. &gt;&gt; So in those things we give thanks. But I want to tell you this morning, church, the greatest thing happened when Christ died on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he died, he paid a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that was a worthy price for you and me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he was an innocent one. &gt;&gt; That's the sad part. He was innocent, &gt;&gt; but he paid the price for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, that's my eternal life. If I don't feed this natural man, it will die. &gt;&gt; Yes. And if I don't feed the spiritual man, &gt;&gt; it will die. &gt;&gt; So, let us &gt;&gt; look into it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And realize this natural man you will die &gt;&gt; if you don't feed it. That's why you eat food &gt;&gt; so that the body can grow strong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But that's only going to be temporary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just for a while. &gt;&gt; But the spiritual man is eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are preparing for. So this morning, the gift of life is eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rather, the gift of God is eternal &gt;&gt; life. &gt;&gt; And I want you to ponder and remember that that's an important thing about we as believers. &gt;&gt; Yes. God sent us a prophet. I just want to read a quotation. I haven't started yet with the message, but something that I want to read what he says here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From seven churches. He says persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian life. I'm not saying it. &gt;&gt; My prophet and your prophet is saying that &gt;&gt; it's part of the Christian life. &gt;&gt; And there is only one thing you can do about them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Does anybody know what you think that you can do about it? &gt;&gt; There's only one thing. &gt;&gt; Commit them all to God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; judge not and leave the outworking and final judgment to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many a time we struggle around certain things instead of leaving it to God to help us in prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh, help us. He says how tragic page 108 church ages how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Instead it listen to man. &gt;&gt; But thank God in the last age there will be a group. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That will rise up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The true brides. Yes. of the last day &gt;&gt; and she will listen to the spirit. &gt;&gt; There'll be a connection. &gt;&gt; She will listen to the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the day of gross darkness, &gt;&gt; the light will return by the pure word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we will return to the power of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not we going to go back to Pentecost as such, but the power of Pentecost. of them. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Now we are thankful for the messenger. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see at the moment when you look around us the denominational world is having a revival with Pentecost. &gt;&gt; That's a level they are in. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. It is just like Abraham when he had Ishmael, he was excited. &gt;&gt; He was happy with Ishmaile and even told God, he said, you know, he was thankful for Ishmael. He says just leave him, you know, like he just was thankful. He was very thankful because he had his son Isma. Yes. &gt;&gt; But God said about the promised seed, &gt;&gt; the promised son, &gt;&gt; was going to be Isaac. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we get excited over these small things and we think that is heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Let us be careful. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we draw our line. And that is why we are further up in this message because we realize we need more than &gt;&gt; Pentecost. &gt;&gt; When we look at the three pools, &gt;&gt; when we look at the three pools, what do you see there? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The revealing of his word in the last book &gt;&gt; is more edifying. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And it is what can give us rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church this morning I'm trying to keep it simple saying it simple so that everyone can understand. &gt;&gt; When you come from the old school sometime it's odd but we are thankful to God we learned a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you talk about the old school you can't wear a fancy suit. You can't wear a dark color shirt or bright color shirt. We were so conscious about everything. &gt;&gt; Let me say this just for the sake of many new believers that have come over the years. &gt;&gt; It was such that you cannot even get married. I remembered in the congregation in Tongat in those days the days when we just came into the message. Nobody wants to get married because the Lord is coming &gt;&gt; and I believe the Lord is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I sincerely believe from the bottom of my heart and and that is why we make ready every day in our life. I was asked by my brother in in the flesh who was also in the message at that time. He's late now that I must go to this certain brother now who was seated like the bishop and get permission from him if you're going to get married. Now in in in in in in normal slang terms I was they say I was a lightye &gt;&gt; that means you was a &gt;&gt; a young boy. I was 21 years old just over 2021 and you have to go through this brother now and you have to say to him look I'm intending to get married because they believe the Lord is coming &gt;&gt; and it was very firm very tough everybody was sincere and god-fearing already I've been reading these books, the spoken word books by then &gt;&gt; and here was the brother that I have to go and see. I went to his house, my mom's house and then I met up with him and then I told him this is my situation. I believe the Bible says better to marry than to betterness. Gave him one two scriptures that I understood and said to him, I want to go in the rapture. I want to be a true Christian. So, I want to get married. He said to me, I'm going to say it the way he he mentioned to me. He said, your light is what's wrong with you? [Music] what's wrong with you? I said, why? What is wrong with what I'm saying? He said, no, there's no more time for that. Just go tell her you joke to them. Get over now. You hearing this from the horse's mouth? &gt;&gt; I mean, I experienc this, &gt;&gt; but I was a bit of a difficult guy. I think it was difficult in those days till we met short and we learned a lot of I said no brother said what he was going to do for example you're going to plant potatoes &gt;&gt; tomorrow you don't plant potatoes tomorrow &gt;&gt; I said that was my plan &gt;&gt; and I want to get married &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so that I can know I got my family few years later when I say few could be almost 3 years later, the same brother got married. So you see, you have to be careful rightly dividing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just take what the pastor says everything down your throat. Hear to it. Look into it. And you not sure of something, sit and say, "Pastor, I don't see these things or elder, I don't see this thing. explain to me &gt;&gt; and I'm sure there'll be an explanation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that is how life started for us in this message. &gt;&gt; Y are the most privileged people in these days that y'all got everything on the plates. &gt;&gt; We got we had those real tapes. How many of youall remember the real tapes? You older folks, you remember the real tapes? The remembers the you remember the real tapes uh when his father used to have those tapes also. It was real tapes and that was the start of the service to end of the service was over 3 hours. You have to hear through the message &gt;&gt; and then it came into cess &gt;&gt; and then now on onto your your cities and even you see technology advanced itself that now we got it so simple question and answers and everything you find that God has revealed this to us. Amen. In this made it so much easier. You know why it became so much easier? We are living in the tradition churches. It's naked, miserable, but everything is getting smarter. &gt;&gt; You know, everything is around the computer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm happy my knowledge is so limited on these things &gt;&gt; that, you know, I have to search and find in the word of God. and and and this morning church, you know, ser serving serving the Lord in this in this time is wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's really uh it blips your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As much as we know what we stand for, as much as we know what the world tells us, but we know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. And when you know it's the truth, &gt;&gt; your arts get strengthened, edifice, get stronger, &gt;&gt; that you want to persevere and continue &gt;&gt; the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; I like many of the prayers of the prophet &gt;&gt; especially you know when he starts prayer he says certain things that touches your heart. He says here, "Our gracious Lord, we are indeed grateful today for this privilege that we have of assembling ourselves together upon the earth before the coming of the Lord. May we examine our hearts today &gt;&gt; by the word &gt;&gt; and see if we are in the faith that we might be ready that the hour of his appearing that we should be as the scripture has said would be caught up &gt;&gt; together with those who are asleep and meet the Lord in the air forever. Be with him. And in verse seven, he says, "And now we trust that the Lord will bless each one of you. I know your hearts are full of joy, looking for the coming of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Are you looking for the coming of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Are you just coming to church because daddy and mommy is here? or you really know and you've got the revelation now &gt;&gt; and you know about this coming of the Lord we are talking about. &gt;&gt; Yes. He says the coming of the Lord and mine also bubbling over to see things happening the way they are. national safe and the church in the condition it is sap states &gt;&gt; and see the signs of his coming both physically we spoke about life &gt;&gt; true life &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; so here the prophet says physically and spiritually &gt;&gt; and knowing that the time of his appearing is so It just fills our heart with joy to know that we are going to be changed one of these days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going &gt;&gt; to be changed &gt;&gt; from these creatures that we are. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I believe with sincerity in my heart that we are living in that latter time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And therefore this uh this morning we have to raise our faith &gt;&gt; higher. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just one more uh encouragement to give you and then we go into the word of God. I must watch my time. &gt;&gt; I want to lift up your your spirits this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you. That's the job of a preacher is to bring forth the word and encourage the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; In a small congregation in the foothills of Great Smokies built a new sanctuary on a piece of land willed to them by a church member. And 10 days before the new church was to open, the local building inspector informed the pastor that the parking lot was inadequate for the size of the building. They needed more parking space. And until the church had to double the size of the parking lot, it would mean that the church would not open its doors. &gt;&gt; It cannot use the sanctuary. Unfortunately, the church with its undersized lot had used every inch of the land except to the mountain against which it had been built. So whatever land was there, it was used to the fullest except the one in the back where it there was a mountain &gt;&gt; and you know there's not much you can do about it. It was a huge mountain. The pastor announced the next Sunday morning that he would meet that evening with members who had mountain moving faith. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; The real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they would hold a prayer session asking God to remove the mountain from the backyard &gt;&gt; and to somehow provide enough money because you when you remove the mountain, you have to do the floors. &gt;&gt; Yes. to have provide enough money to have it paved and painted before the scheduled opening dedication service the following week. At the appointed time 24 here you see the colors now 24 of the congregations 300 members 24 300 members assembled for prayer. Sure. &gt;&gt; So they certainly marked their mountain moving &gt;&gt; trust. Amen. They prayed for nearly 3 hours and at 10:00 the pastor said the final amen. And he said we will open next Sunday as scheduled. He assured everyone God has never let us down before. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe you will be faithful this time too. &gt;&gt; And the next morning as the pastor was working in his study there came a loud knock at the door. And when he called come in, a rough looking construction foreman appeared removing his hard hat as he entered. and he said, "Excuse me, reverence. I'm from this particular construction company over in the next county. We are building a huge shopping mall." And we need some filler means gravel. We will remove and pave all the exposed area free of charge &gt;&gt; if we can have it right now. &gt;&gt; We can do nothing with our m to extend or whatever it is until we get that dirt that gravel &gt;&gt; in and allow it to settle. &gt;&gt; I always think the price has been paid on Calvary. always think about this. Lord, &gt;&gt; the little church was dedicated the next Sunday as originally plans. I like that the pastor stood there with his words. Amen. That is the service. going to continue with everything up to date. And there were far more members with mountain moving faith &gt;&gt; on the opening Sunday than there than there had been the previous week. &gt;&gt; Praise wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I wonder what would you have do in this case? &gt;&gt; Yes. Would you also have had that faith that can move amen mountains? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this morning we are grateful to understand that. Amen. Hallelujah. As we read the word this morning, the scripture, we look at this great king Uzziah. a great king. Very great. Amen. He was. As we look at some scriptures just now and you'll see how powerful this man was to the extent they could hear and know about his power even in Egypt. And when we look at his background, he came from a family where his parents raised him in the ways of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In chapter 20 25, if you can just turn backwards to chapter 25, that was his fatherhiah. He was 20 and 5 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 20 and 9 years in Jerusalem. The Lord the father in verse two said and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord. Now even the prophet speaks about that. He says his upbringing he had a lot of influence you know in the way he conducted himself though it says in in verse two he says but not with a perfect heart. &gt;&gt; So we don't know what went wrong in there what he was thinking but in general he raised the family in the ways of God. He raised his children in the ways of God. And then in 26 he talks about Uzziah was 16 years old when he became the king. At that age the people wanted him as a king and they made him a king in the room of his father when his father died. We look at the latter part of the father also. He went and brought the the gods of the world into his house, idols and all those things and that upset God and later the people murdered him, killed him. &gt;&gt; That's how important it is to walk in the ways of the Lord. In verse 4, 264, it says that he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father and Messiah did. We don't want to go too much into it, but it's very important how we raise our family. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very, very important how we raise our family. that will show forth what fruit it will bear. In verse five, it says, "And he sought God in the days of Zechariah." He says, "And as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the devil sometimes can tempt people and make them to prosper, too. when the head get a bit big, you know, they they get into the world side of things. So I'm not talking about that pro. I'm talking about prosper in the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says the Lord made him to prosper. here is a is is this king that has received the blessings of God and God add him and cut it and lifted him. And I want to title my message this morning. Stay in your office. &gt;&gt; What God has called you, you stay in your office. &gt;&gt; Amen. And watch out. Beware of pride. &gt;&gt; May I say it even a little different? Beware of pride in high places. &gt;&gt; You know when you get up there &gt;&gt; high places then you feel you got wings now. You are somebody. &gt;&gt; Our attitude changes. &gt;&gt; We didn't want to tell the pastor how to run the church. We don't tell the elder you know uh what to do. &gt;&gt; We'll tell the deacons no you know they are not right. &gt;&gt; We want to start finding faults on one another. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No &gt;&gt; that is what we must watch. &gt;&gt; So here was this young king 16 years old. The Bible says he reigned for over 50 years. 52 years I would Yes. Over 50 years from a young man. And for 50 years plus he reigned as king. Verse six. And he went forth and warded against the Philistines and break down the wall of Gap and the wall of Gavna and the wall of Ashdod and build cities. He was very, you know, much on the building and uh weapons. vers. And God helped him. And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians that dwelt in those places. Verse eight. And the Amorites gave gifts to Uzziah, and his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened himself exceedingly. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to pay attention about when it says, "And he ex and he strengthened himself exceedingly." It's only God's favor in your life that carries you every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about yourself who you are. &gt;&gt; It's about God's favor. &gt;&gt; And that is why we must stay in the way of God, not on the way of man. He says they built towers in Jerusalem. You go on to verse 10. Also he built towers in the desert places and they dig for wells. He say the low country and in the plains husband men also and uh vine dresses to the mountains and in camel for he loved husband. So here we see he loved that outdoor life. Nothing wrong about that. Moreover, Uzziah had an host of fighting men. You see so much about him that we are reading now. He says that he went out to war by bands amount of people, military force according to the number of the accounts by the hand of J, the scribe. And then he say verse 12, "And the whole number of the of the chief of the fathers, the mighty men of Allah were 2,600. And under their hand was an army 300,000 and 7,000 and 500." You see the numbers. Amen. And verse 14. And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the old shields and spears and helmets and others and bows and slings and stones to pass stones and not the slings that you and I think of. Slings that could pass big stones can kill people. So he was so well organized with you know the help of God that everything fell so well in his lot. But then his head became a bit swelled more and he made in Jerusalem angels. Verse 15. And invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bullwarks to shoot arrows and great stone dog. And his name spread far abroad. For he was marvelously helped till he was strong. The word strong is not just he was strong, he was famous, he was known for all these things because he had the help of God. &gt;&gt; And many a times with the help of God we have seen great things happen in our lives because God being with us. Verse 16 comes to our climax of the of of the main part of the scriptures or the message says but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction to his destruction. &gt;&gt; When he was strong &gt;&gt; when he thought he knew it all. Many a time when we think we know it all, we think there's nobody else can think like me. Nobody else is better than me. Many times it has come across us. Many of times we have thought that. Maybe you have prospered. Maybe you've been doing well. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been the leader in your family doing so well and you took it to heart. or in the congregation. Many a times you will think these things. But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction. For he transgressed against the Lord the God is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you touch on God's side, &gt;&gt; you have to be so careful. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are playing with fire &gt;&gt; and fire burns. You play with water, you will drown. That's what happened in the time of Noah. And when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, to his own destruction. For he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense. &gt;&gt; Such a sad part to to read the scriptures. He looked at himself and he was big in his boots. Many a times these are the things that take us away from God. &gt;&gt; These are the things pride and we are somebody and it draws us away from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we know and we look at example that God has left for us through the prophetic ministry. We look at the prophet of God was such a humble man of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we learned so much from that. Yes, &gt;&gt; that he was really a humble man of God. Even when he was put to the test, when there were problems and they were questioning him, God was on the scene and helped him always. &gt;&gt; It says, "And as a priest went in after him with him, four priests of the Lord that were valiant men. Here we look." Now when you went into the temple to burn incense, that is why a church must be so protected. That's why there's such a thing as deacons. The prophet of God spoke about these things. You must just be careful. You can get a man that just possessed can just walk in. We have to guard beside Jesus. And as the the priest went in after him with him four priests of the Lord that was valiant men. And they would stood Uzziah the king and said unto him that it is not for him to burn incense into unto the Lord. It was not his responsibility. &gt;&gt; It was not his duty. It was not his office. Yes. &gt;&gt; If it's not your office, stay at your office. &gt;&gt; And if you feel that office is not enough, God knows the right time when you'll promote you from that office to the next office. &gt;&gt; You leave things in God's hand, not in the hands of man. Amen. That's right. And the Bible says, "And they would stood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, it's not for you, Uzziah, to burn this incense because it's only for the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense. go out of the sanctuary for thou has trespassed. It was another office. But he used to look at himself to be such a great man. The king, the in authority, yes, the king is a great man. What he says, it's taken into effect. Amen. Whatever he says. And here he thought he was he was hit. He was a man. He can do what he wants to do. And he was going to now burn incense in the temple of God. 19 Then Uzziah was rot and he had a sensor in his hand to burn incense. And while he was rot with the priest, the leprosy even rose up &gt;&gt; in his forehead &gt;&gt; before the priest in the house of the Lord from beside the incense altar. &gt;&gt; God doesn't play with his word. &gt;&gt; God keeps to his word &gt;&gt; and he will keep to all what he has said. We want to talk about your calling. No matter what you've been called &gt;&gt; as a believer, let us stay in our calling. &gt;&gt; Let God &gt;&gt; take us higher up if he needs to. &gt;&gt; In a workplace, you can't be doing a job and then you go and say the supervisor, I'll do your job or go tell the manager, I'll do you. You have no authority. They kick you out. &gt;&gt; You're out. &gt;&gt; You have to stay at your responsibility. &gt;&gt; See, God's calling generally refers to God's invitation to participate in his purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Calling is seen as a gift and a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a way to bring glory to God. And let's look at a few examples. Amen. When we look at uh King Saul in 1st Samuel 138-11, Saul offered sacrifices to God when he was supposed to wait for the prophet Samuel. There was a bit of a delay time &gt;&gt; and Samuel came a bit late. But here was Saul being a great man, king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will take it upon myself." So he took it upon himself to do a office of somebody else. His impatience led him to perh to to perform a responsibility that was not his. We look at Kora in numbers 16. Can we turn to numbers 16? If you can just read verse 3, 4, and 5, and then verse 32, you see the Bible talks about how the her opened up. Amen. Numbers 16 verse 3, 4, and 5. Thereafter, verse 32. When we look at Kora, he was a live by birth. He was privileged to serve in the tabernacle. He had a sacred role despite his important position. He was not satisfied still. &gt;&gt; He was he was uh not content. &gt;&gt; That's another area of concern &gt;&gt; we have in today's time. We are sometime just not content with what we have. &gt;&gt; That's why there's so much of problems even in marriages. Maybe the sister will tell the brother, you know, you see the neighbor, they they change, they got another car now, you know, or they they're doing some extension to their house. And why you so behind it? And that is why these things ought to be discussed in homes. &gt;&gt; We ought to sit down and say this is what the Lord has provided. You remember the story when this poor man and and husband and wife and the prophet passed by there and yeah they said so much they earned the husband said and and this is for so much for groceries. This is so much for that and this is a dress that I saw. I probably will not make it this month but maybe next month I will you know be able to make it. &gt;&gt; And there was an understanding &gt;&gt; there was an agreement. &gt;&gt; Yes. And so much good it is to have that kind of sit together once a month and discuss your your your your your money side you know your uh discuss you know your budget and those things so that it's understood to both you know to the husband and to the wife but sometimes when she wants that she wants those things and then you go and you say let me make another uh what do you call it higher person on on on interest and and then end of the month come now you going to the families you're going to the pastor and saying I have this problem now and I cannot solve it and that becomes really a difficulty that becomes a mountain so here we see that ka He was by birth. He was privileged to serve in the tabernacle. He had a sacred role. Despite his important position, he was still not content with his calling. Furthermore, he was so upset. He was rebellious. He was rebellious. and he gathered 250 followers and challenged the authority of Moses and Aaron that was leading to a severe judgment. The 250 men who were offered incense were consumed by the heavenly fires. You know one thing about God is not a playmate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We must take it serious. Is God respect honor is the highest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In between you and me is the highest in our worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. The consequences of fora was that Dayton and Abraham they were swallowed by the hurt. That was a display of God's judgment &gt;&gt; on those who challenge God's appointed leaders. &gt;&gt; Just be careful. I hope I'm not making you scared, &gt;&gt; but it's the truth. Just be careful. Don't play with fire. You get burnt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lesson here is stay humble. Stay in your position. Because if you read number 16, you're going to see the whole chapter there when you have time and you will see a man and understand it better. Then we're looking at David. When we look at the earlier part of David when he was was put his hands to the the heart we know that God was against it and God showed him but he took correction from the word of God. &gt;&gt; That was a good thing. He took correction from the word of God. He was anointed king also and he was corrected and it became the duty of the Levites to transport the ark, not the king's duty. According to 1 Chronicles 15:2, God was not pleased with David's first attempt to move the ark of the covenant. It was done in an improper pagan way, &gt;&gt; pagan manner. And that was leading to death. Amen. Users death. Amen. As we know what happened to David realized the protocols and instructions that are only for the Levites to carry the ark. &gt;&gt; This morning church, let us realize what we carry within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. You can carry malice and all anger and all these things or you can carry God in you. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know in Matthew 1 I think it is there when he talks about uh Mary says when Joseph was reminded by the angel that what Mary is carrying within her is of the Holy Ghost. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now what is Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Then later he says his name will be called Emanuel Jesus and and and and you see the godhead there. People don't see the godhead but you go in Matthew chapter one you will see the god there. It says and his name shall be called Jesus. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that Holy Ghost name was what? Jesus one God &gt;&gt; not three gods &gt;&gt; so that the denomination world get all mixed up and they see three gods or they see three different ways they they they cannot explain to you they'll talk to you in halfway then they lost themselves but there's one God and the prophet of God showed that to us &gt;&gt; even spoke on water baptism He said father, son, holy ghost is one God. &gt;&gt; So here we see a blessing can become a test. And as long as Uzziah sought the Lord, he prospered. But when he became strong, his heart was lifted up to destruction. The lesson that we learn from here is sometimes the greater test is not hardship. &gt;&gt; Yes, hardship is a test. Yes, it is a test. But the greater test is but success. When we look at Isaiah, we look at his success. that made him think that blew his head up. Made him think he was it. &gt;&gt; He was a man of the hour. &gt;&gt; So sometimes the greatest test is not hardship but success. I know it's hard to understand this. How can success be such a painful thing? You know, can be a greater test because that's what happens when we succeed. When we success, when we get better in life, we sometime want to go astray. Nebuchadnezzar, he was lifted in pride and later humbled to eat grass. &gt;&gt; You know the story. Eat grass like a cattle. But he was a proud man. We look at Saul, he exalted as a king, but he was rejected for one thing, disobedience. [Music] &gt;&gt; Disobedience. God doesn't like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pride leads us out of God's boundaries and takes us away. &gt;&gt; Right. Uzziah entered the temple to burn incense. A priest's duty, not the king's. The king's duty was not to burn incense. It was the priest's responsibility. Pride makes us ignore God's order and roles and authority. That's what pride does. It fleshes so much in us. It makes us to ignore what God wants out of us. And God will be speaking to your heart and still you'll ignore that and you'll go do something different. The lesson that we learn here, Amen. is position in one area doesn't give us authority in all areas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it. position in one area does not give us a quality in all areas. &gt;&gt; You can be a king but it's not your office to go to the priesthood and take day responsibility. When we look at Kora he rebelled. He was wanting the priestly office and he was judged by God because you wanted somebody else's office. &gt;&gt; Church, let's stay at our calling. Whether you wipe the chairs, whether you clean the carpet, [Music] whether you do home visitation, no matter what is the calling that you are doing. Yes, maybe you want to you like that calling, you speak to your maker. You speak to God. Let God handle everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But stay at your calling. Stay at your responsibility. Stay at your duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you will see the hand of God. &gt;&gt; When you look at Lucifer, nobody likes the name Lucifer. Lucifer does a lot of damages. And when you look at Lucifer in Isaiah 14, God had to kick him down because he was, you know, saying things to assert more authority and more power over the angels. And he put words into the angels. Yes. May I say it that way? &gt;&gt; And finally he was kicked down. &gt;&gt; And what he did when he was kicked down anyone where the first place he went after that &gt;&gt; he went to had him and he &gt;&gt; and he messed up the plan of God. &gt;&gt; That was why God kicked him down &gt;&gt; because he was messing up there. By the time God could do anything else, he missed the plan of God. He came in between and pride ends in shame. When God struck Isaiah with leprosy, instantly he became isolated. He lived until death. Remember, not just for strength. He was not just remembered for strength. Remember, he was a strong man. The Bible says he was a great man. He was so great. They spoke about him outside the other area, other countries, other surroundings, outside Egypt. But not just only because of that, but also because of pride. &gt;&gt; Pride is such a sad thing. And You know we must just be humble in again the lesson that we learn always pride always brings downfall. Proverbs 16:18 he says pride goeth before destruction. &gt;&gt; Pride goeth before destruction and an arty spirit before a fall. Amen. &gt;&gt; An artist before a fall. You look at he received glory as a god. He was struck by an angel. So there's many others. Amen. May you know you may be gifted, talented and even in eye position. But beware, pride can make you step out of God's calling and destroy what God built in you. &gt;&gt; And therefore, it's important you stay humble. &gt;&gt; Stay in your lane. &gt;&gt; Stay in your lane. &gt;&gt; And give all glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Bible says God resisteth the the proud but giveth grace to the humble. It's in James 4. Amen. Verse 6. This morning we want God to have his way in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the messages the influence of another says Uzziah did that because he got lifted up. He got lifted up much higher. And now we see what he tried to do. Now what really got him when he got lifted up in his heart? We are told in the Bible in Chronicles the 26th chapter which we read. Amen. We find out that he went into the temple of the Lord with a sensor in his hand to burn incense unto the Lord. And when he did the minister put a stop to that. minister of the temple would force call other ministers followed him and told him don't do that you are wrong you are not a minister &gt;&gt; in other words you are not a priest &gt;&gt; you are a king &gt;&gt; not a priest he was very upset and he was ro and he flew up and his temper got away from him and he lift the sensor to go any anywhere. He didn't worry. He said, "I'm going to do it because he was a king. &gt;&gt; He had authority. He had power." But how you assert your power and authority is another thing. Be careful each one of us here. Amen. How we assert our power and our authority even in your own family. Yes. You know as I said those days when we came into the message man you know thought that you know yes he was the the leader in the house. Yes he was in charge of the family but some of them thought they were gods you know and they were really reckless. But as the years went by we learned to understand that this message so much better and God has been favorable to help us and guide us. and show us what is a family and all these things. We all made our mistakes once upon a time. That is where we want a lesson. Now, if this man which God had blessed in his capacity but he wasn't satisfied with that, he wanted to take somebody else's place. You can't be nothing. He says now as long as he remained king, he was a blessing to the people as a king. He was a great blessing to the people being a king. But when he thought he was a minister, he thought because God had blessed him, God had brought him so high up, he was the man for the for the moment. He could be anything he wanted to be. But he was a blessing to the people as a king. And that was a high authority, the highest authority. But still he was not satisfied. &gt;&gt; But not a blessing. He became a curse upon them as he tried to take the minister's place. Tried to take the priest place. And we have a lot of that. Everybody wants the prophet says to pack the ball. It talks about the ball game. Amen. And today we have the same thing. He says when we see God come on the scene and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all our enemies away from it &gt;&gt; and let us use our influences and tackles not run runner tackles that protects the runner. Let him pack the ball right way. He's talking about a soccer game how you play the ball right because there's no opposition. All he has to do is just keep running and we should be catless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, let us just guard this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let us put a guard around this message. Amen. Let us have longsuffering for our brother, &gt;&gt; longsuffering for our sister. Sometimes we wonder, I mean, you know, how he can't see this message. He's so long in the church. Oh, she can't dress like a proper Christian. You take it to God in prayer and you'll see the hand of God. My brother, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; we can preach from the pulpit. It's not going to make a difference, but you take it to God in your prayer. It'll make even a greater difference. &gt;&gt; God will hear. He has more time to hear to that prayer. But when we start throwing stones, &gt;&gt; then it's not good. M &gt;&gt; many times in a church, a little church, you can have a revival going on. Someone will want to go out here and lead a prayer meeting and then he's got a different idea from what really the Bible says. But he believes it this way anyhow. He believes it this way and he will start and influence and draw others away from it. The thing to do is to protect this message the way it's going stay right with it and knock everything away from it if we are ever going to cross the gold line. All right. And I said, "Brethren, there is something wrong. You fellows are businessmen." You talk about the businessmen, they want to take over the pulpit and all those things. You see the first place you don't understand the approach. You don't understand the approach to the ministry because the ministry is a God called gift. &gt;&gt; It's not for Tom, Dick, and Harry. It's a God called gift. Amen. That is from the message influence of another. Now pray here we see Uzziah he got lifted up and he thought what a great fellow I am so much he got lifted up till he tried to take the place of the priest. He goes into the temple which he took picked up the sensor of fire and went up to the altar of incense. Now that now that was only consecrated for the priests. He says, "Now I have said before, so say I again. Businessmen are not preachers." He says, "We preachers have enough time to try to keep this thing straight." The responsibility of the ministry, let alone businessmen. You all are businessmen, not ministers. And don't take the place of one or try to because you are not called for such. If you want somebody to speak at your convention, what do you do? Get a preacher. Get a preacher. Somebody that's called to do so. Because you see what a struggle we ministers have got already. And so you see what you do. And Isaiah here, he tried to take the place of a priest. He thought, well, God has blessed me. Why can't I do it? Don't you never get that in your head? God calls and predestinates, &gt;&gt; four ordaines to his glory. You remember in the Bible when Moses was bringing Israel out of Egypt across though to the promised land, do you remember one in there and those who got lifted up and said, "Now wait a minute, Moses. You try to be the only one on the beat. There's other holy men among you." But Moses was called by God to perform his responsibility. That's why we have to respect one another's office. We need to realize, Amen. that God put that man in the office. God put that man in this area. Let him be respected. And God said, "Separate yourself. I will destroy them." And you know what God done? He opened the earth in time of Moses and he destroyed them and he burnt them and he said separate yourself for I will destroy them. God had ordained a certain thing to be done and it must be done that way. &gt;&gt; We are not to inject our own ideas. &gt;&gt; We are to respect his idea and his commandment. Now, not referring back to he says to our sisters, no matter what the other woman does, God has got your pattern laid here for you. &gt;&gt; No matter what some other layman done in the Bible, God has got your pattern here what to do. We will get to it after a while because he says that the layman is is to do and the minister and all of us. He's talking about later about church order and all the things. But now we find out that this man got lifted up. So he took the sensor went for to the altar which was only permitted by God to the right office palace. He tried to take the minister's place and that was what caused the biggest problem and he ended up with leprosy on and then the minister tried to collect him. We find out that four SC priests 80 priests had to stop him from doing that. Beside the eye priest, 81 priests come after him and told him, "Sir," in other words like this, "God has blessed you. You are an honored man." &gt;&gt; You are an honored man. You are a great man and God has blessed you in your work. You shouldn't do that. You're getting out of the beaten roads. So this morning, we are to take a lesson from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And understand, Amen. I just like to read one and close. Amen. And understand, Amen. what God wants from us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe this morning God is speaking to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God says in perfect strength by perfect weakness in page 11 he says then in paragraph 68 then God can achieve his purpose by sending not a revival but brother what he needs to do first is send a killing. &gt;&gt; We need to die first. Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. So we can revive. You have to die before you can be born again. &gt;&gt; You have to die before you can be born again. He needs a killing of ourselves. &gt;&gt; And then he says about don't tabernacle. He says this tabernacle needs a killing and me with it. That's humbleness of the prophet. He says, "And me with it." And all of us, we need a killing so that we can be revived in a new life, a new hold, a new hope, a new experience. And we need first a day of mourning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to get away from that, from that human ability. We got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls and live even to the housewife, to the farmer, to the mechanic or whatever we are. We got to surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing. &gt;&gt; That we are nothing. Then let God start from there. Then he starts moving, working and that includes all of us. History proves does right now proves history proves that God always chose the nobody's &gt;&gt; to become the somebody's God takes a person that's nothing to make somebody shall we stand to our feet this morning God bless Amen to your hearts and I pray that you'll be invited by his precious Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the wonderful thing about this gospel that we are speaking of. Amen. It comes amen from the heart of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is what is wonderful. Amen. It comes from the heart of God. Hallelujah. You know in what think of Christ paragraph 9 he says that's my eternal life. If I don't feel this natural man, it will die. &gt;&gt; If I don't feed this natural man, it will die. &gt;&gt; As I said earlier, and if I don't feed this spiritual man, it will die. &gt;&gt; So, you got two feeding to do. &gt;&gt; But let us concentrate more on that spiritual man this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Time tested memorial of God. He says that's the way God does his church. He gives you trials after trials. I want to encourage you this morning and I want you to remember this last quote that I'm reading. You'll go through trials after trials. Don't feel you are the only one going through that. Just remember your neighbor, your brother, your sister is also going through it. Says that's the way God does his church. He gives you trials after trials. He gives you tests after test until the life of Christ is reflected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in your life &gt;&gt; until the life of Christ is reflected in your life. Until you become peaceful, sober, meek, gentle, humble, ready, submissive, willing. Turn your head from the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary to the one to the one the one that's doing the beating this morning. God is doing the beating in your life. Look to him. Amen. I pray that you have been edified by the word of God this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the word of God is the most powerful weapon that we have. Amen. In this time that we are living in. And let us stay close by his side. Amen. I pray that I'll be governed. Amen. By God's words this morning. I wonder if we can sing a song. Amen. I want to live the way you wants me to live. Do you want to live the way of God? Amen. This day, amen. I want to live the way and he wants me to live. I want to hear until this. &gt;&gt; I want to love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Love is just as you love. &gt;&gt; But I can never ever love the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to live. I want to live the way that he wants me to &gt;&gt; and the service God's servant our precious brother. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Amen. taking. [Music] I want to love you. Just know [Music] &gt;&gt; I could never ever [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Were you blessed through the word of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even as our brother was ministering. Amen. Stay in your office. &gt;&gt; Amen.
