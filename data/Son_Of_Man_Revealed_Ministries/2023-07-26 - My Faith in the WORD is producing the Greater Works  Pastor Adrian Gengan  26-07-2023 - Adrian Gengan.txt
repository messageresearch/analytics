tell the prophet watch Russia yes can you really read the news without watching Russia it's staring in your face amen Russia is at War amen and Ukraine is being used as a proxy for the United Nations amen so they are all ready for the final age the final hour for the climax amen the superpowers are ready amen hallelujah the false Church Israeli the Antichrist is ready the mother and the daughters are ready but there's a super church that's ready amen there's a super church that's written up in this hour amen hallelujah yes amen so here the prophet is saying listen to this now he says father speaking to the people trying to get them to see their purpose here their purpose is not to go to work come in at night eat the meals go to bed read the paper the next morning and go back to work again day in and day out now that's Satan trying to distract us right amen neither is it to go to church on a Sunday morning listen to a sermon go home go to work and father we're here to be instruments of yours and if you know instruments are meant to be played yes I'm going to say father play me amen use me amen strum me amen speak to me yes amen hallelujah amen you redeem them back to their right estate Hallelujah yes amen man in his right mind believes God for all things amen are we in our right mind we believe God for all things amen hallelujah he says remember now he's quoting a scripture because a lot of people like to quote the scripture but he's quoting it to bring a point amen he says a weak and adulterous generation seek after science but he says but friend we have been so educated we've educated away from the supernatural yes come on now yeah that's right I hope you're not looking towards denominations right now yeah we've been educated away from the supernatural that's right Jesus said this son shall follow them that believe amen did he say these signs shall follow the pasture only did he say these Sons shall follow the evangelists only he says these signs shall follow them that believe and by God's grace are you one of them that believe amen he says we are never seeking signs but God is always there with science from the very beginning of Genesis 2 Revelation in the Bible and where there was no signs there was no God amen amen hallelujah amen we ought to pray like the disciples we ought to pray like the prophet watch before his service he starts he's praying to the Lord Lord switch forth and hand to heal with Miracle signs and wonders amen amen we can't be preaching without an expectation without the expectation for the demonstration of power yes amen and you find people they are too Restless after the service when God is fixing to move and the Holy Ghost is fixing to move we just want to close service and go home we don't want to see a move of God we have no desire to see the sick Hills amen we have no desire to see people filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we just want to settle our itching ears and our conscience to say we've been to church let me go home amen we need to be so desperate for the presence of God amen amen the presidency of God it should be the only thing we live for in this life and like we read on Sunday the hill the mountains melt at the presence of the Lord just like how demons respond when you walk up to them you walk up to a person demon possessed and you watch how they manifest yes the same way amen if you are carrying the presence of God problems must go away you don't even need to say a word amen the Bible says lay hands on the sick he doesn't say pray the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen glory be to his name what am I teaching you faitha's muscles yes and how do you develop muscles you train it are we training our faith are we exercising our faith exercise it in the little things yeah yes amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so now you know that in the church world today you'll find it all over YouTube and all these Apostles and Prophets and everybody they are trying to deal with sickness without dealing with sin they're trying to use the power of God to heal the people but they don't deal with the root cause of it which is sin and the prophet says you cannot deal with sickness without dealing with sin that is why amen for sure the people the demon property lives in but they're a week later they got the demon back on them so they keep coming back into the prayer line amen hallelujah and we know that sin is unbelief amen sin is the root but we are like Jesus we curse the root amen we go to the tree we go to the roots of unbelief and we curse that root of unbelief and we say Satan take your unbelief out of me amen hallelujah so sickness is just an attribute of their unbelief if we get rid of the root then that's what Jesus do do amen amen put up 1 Peter 2 24 there amen for sin is the head of the serpent unbelief is the head and how do you kill a serpent if you attack the body does it die what do you attack so sin unbelief he's the head of the serpent you've got to attack the head 1 Peter 2 24 hear what Jesus did Jesus Took the sting out of death Jesus Took death upon his own body he took sin upon his own body so that you and I can live in Victory amen for his own self bear sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to our sins he took it upon himself so that we can be dead to sin to unbelief should live unto righteousness amen Satan is lying to you that you cannot attain righteousness I don't have my own righteousness it's the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen it's no longer I that liveth amen but Christ said liveth in me amen so I am righteous oh come on now get that unbelief off of you amen I am righteous I am cleansed I am perfect through the blood of Jesus amen don't let Satan live you and Satan make you live a defeated life and make you think oh look how unrighteous you are you cannot get in righteousness on your own not in this flesh you've got to look at your righteousness through Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and he says not only did he take death away now by whose Stripes you were killed amen yes this is the scripture we ought to be buying this is the scripture we ought to know of by heart listen Isaiah 53 this is the word of God and shall never change anytime Satan comes amen and tries to throw sickness upon you you're quoting back to scripture amen tell him Satan oh Hallelujah this is scriptural now every time Satan came against Jesus he quoted back the word amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah now Jesus didn't come to redeem us just from sin without redeeming us from sickness that's what the scripture is saying yes amen and everything goes with it even death he redeemed us from death and we do not die no way in the Bible does it speak of us dying speaks of us going to sleep we know what that means sleep in this body but alive in another body amen a Christian does not die yes yes amen a Christian has eternal life amen Hallelujah we just changed garments we just change Dimensions but we never die amen amen how can we die in Christ when he took our death amen glory be to his name amen hallelujah the prophet God says here that salvation happiness and joy is the earnest of our salvation so if you got no happiness and joy you are not speaking of your salvation amen amen people are miserable people find it miserable in the message they think hey it's so miserable amen is the most joyous life amen it's one of three amen it's one of Happiness yes amen amen that would be most miserable in any other church that's right but because of the message of the hour amen I have salvation I am happiness and joy yes sir Glory put in his name amen and here not only did he leave us with that with an Earnest for salvation but he says amen Divine Healing is the earnest of our Immortal bodies which is coming on Amen thank you so you go to that mountain of sickness and say sickness take your flight amen I have the inheritance the down payment amen my body change is coming amen you either leave now or you're going to leave sooner or later yes amen there's no sickness going to be in that new body amen no thank you Lord thank you thank you Father glory be to his name amen amen amen hallelujah you know you know in the in the natural when you lose one sense the other sins strengthens like if you lose sight your hearing strengthens right right the other sense becomes stronger right how about if we die the five senses one will happen tonight six years amen hallelujah now he says here and there's a reason why I put this and we're not focusing on denominational Christian now right we're focusing on message Christian as a denominational Christian with only a profession of faith you'll never see the mystery yes yes amen you stay in your church he says but be born again of the spirit so the valves in your innermost being in your mind and soul can open up to the full stature of what God wants you to be I mean if you want to say Lord open up my vows amen amen many many men some of us need some plungers here amen this is a plumbing term now he's using the drains are clogged the spirit cannot flow we need to call in a plumber amen hallelujah amen a specialist Plummer that can unclog all the muck in the Maya and there's no better promise than the holy spirit amen he'll get rid of all unbelief in your life amen that's the reason people don't want the Holy Ghost they want to stay in the church they think the protection is in the message of the hour oh I got good news for you you're wrong or is it bad news you are wrong you are not going to make it to Heaven because you are in a messy Church you are going to make it because you are born again and filled with the spirit of God individually amen ain't nobody gonna hold my ankles when I go in that body change you can't hold on to Mommy's ankle Daddy's ankle Mom can I go back in your room then I'll go with you Nicodemus spirit amen hallelujah glory be to his name now how would you know what you need to be in this hour if somebody doesn't take away your amnesia because we really have amnesia and this flesh it's so what can I say thick that you've got to constantly remind it who you are yes the spirit man within you who's living we've got to rewire ourselves we've got to constantly remind ourselves that's why we've got to constant to you read the word yes amen the word is reminding us yeah now we're going into some important stuff here because on our own we would never know what man was meant to be right there's no denomination can tell you how Adam operated on the earth there's only one man a prophet one will the mystery of God and unlocked the potential that was in Adam the Genesis 1 26 man yes so we'll read a picture and he says first you were born here to control all circumstances now we just laid the platform to show you that Jesus restored back everything in his death yes yes so this is our ought to be condition this is the goal become the master of all circumstances doesn't Romans 8 tell us that creation is waiting for its master right when God made man it made him Superior to anything on Earth Hallelujah yes amen go deep now are the demon powers on the earth yes is the photos right on the earth yes was a serpent day in the garden yes but who's Superior of him he gave him jurisdiction of everything on Earth you know we get excited when we watch Superman you are greater than Superman amen you are greater than Superman he gave him jurisdiction of everything on Earth to control everything he control the animal life he controlled for our life the fish of the sea he controlled the winds sounds like Jesus doesn't it because that's what the second Adam was he came to remind us what we were how can he redeem us if he himself is not showing us the potentials so when when we read denominations read the book they'll read the Bible and they they that's why I love that song to be like Jesus because that's me yes that's the potential of my husband amen the husband and wife is one amen and I'm a co-ed with Jesus joined Here with Jesus yes amen hallelujah if you if you think I'm off there then Peter see Jesus walking on water did he desire to walk on the water did he ask Jesus if he can walk on the water what was he asking him didn't he ask him can I be like you Peter started singing to be like Jesus to be like Jesus all I ask is to be like you right now can I walk on water and Jesus said sure come yeah amen and he walked on water so learn from that even that short story there don't just walk for a season or a little while yes keep your eyes fixed on Jesus don't look around at the circumstance because you know why you're the master of all Circumstance the situation is impossible yes yes it's not possible for men to walk on water Normal Man without faith so when you're looking at your sickness it's not possible according to science for somebody to recover from stage four cancer it's not possible for certain diseases according to science for man to recover but when you step out on faith amen don't look back at the circumstance yes don't look at the symptom amen look to the Unseen Faith looks to the Unseen amen I'm walking that Supernatural realm of faith so don't walk in it for a season and then slip and fall into the water and ask Jesus to save you amen hallelujah walk by faith not by sight amen amen that's the thought they walk by faith so here we are now and we're reading out we control the winds he control the plant life did Jesus control the plant life did he go to the tree and speak to it he controlled everything now this is talking about Adam not Jesus the property is talking about Adam are we Adam I don't want your faith to wane now don't let it get weak this is your potential now this is God taking away your amnesia now don't have dementia where you remember things for a while and then you forget well Alzheimer's I don't know what the difference is amen men were man was made as a secondary God on Earth yes he was given power to control some things the easy thing he was given power to control all things all elements of the Earth water Moses water yes the way you bringing so hard examples amen I must go to the Sea and speak to them if Moses did it I can't do it amen it's the same God amen hallelujah that sounds ridiculous sounds ridiculous didn't he spot the Jordan again yeah my God can do it again and again and again amen he's the same God today amen hallelujah pull him out of History amen yes amen he's the god of today all elements is fire and elements three Hebrew boys fire that doesn't work was it the same one in the burning bush fire that doesn't burn yes amen hallelujah all elements of the Earth what about rain is it raining elements can you speak to rain we did yes amen come on now amen yes this is your training ground you go anywhere and the weather's bad you speak to that weather that's right amen I know some of you can't wait for it to rain again amen not only that look that was Adam Adam was given these great powers and Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop so sisters if you're complaining because wind is going to blow my hairstyle you know what to do don't speak and complain it's so windy to speak to the wind say Lord maybe somebody has need of this wind but I don't need it now send the wind to them when I go out it must not be windy until I come back I thank you Lord in Jesus name amen amen he could speak to the trees and they would obey him amen yes we were sharing getting some testimonies from the brothers they've been speaking to trees amen they spoke to trees that were not bearing fruit-bearing trees that were not bearing don't cut it down speak to the tree amen you know you know that's a reality you know in gardening they tell you you must speak to your plants pick your flowers why are they telling you they think you know in the natural world that's Madness they ask you if you're mad you're speaking to the tree there but they know there's a life in the tree they know that trees have life amen it sounds mad to speak to a mountain just like how it sounds mad for you to speak to an engine that's not that's not uh part of scientific world how can you speak to an engine you speak to a mountain eh but this is the potential we have amen amen hallelujah remember now what we are speaking faith in the world to produce the Greater Works now if you're looking for it I'm afraid you're too late it's already started amen the Greater Works have already started I can sit down here and start a testimony night right now amen hallelujah so you're too late skeptic you're too late I'm believer yeah amen amen hallelujah yes glory be to his name amen hallelujah amen I'm just trying to push your faith again amen hallelujah amen so that you can go on Amen Hallelujah walking in faith so yeah it's so beautiful I can't stop reading it yeah amen you could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife now we know what Daniel did in the Lion's Den yes it would obey him he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obeyed amen Adam now in the beginning of man that's what God gave him power over everything on Earth and yet again Adam never had to be sick he never had to die so you go back to that enemy and you tell him Satan I'm not listening to your gospel sickness is Satan's gospel right he never had to die he never had to worry amen that's why Jesus comes and says don't worry Adam didn't have to worry he never had a heartache he never had fear and fear is the thing that is crippling people's feet they are fearful and you know what they're fearful about applying the word of God they are too afraid to apply the word of God I don't know why amen they'd rather sit with a situation than take God at his word and applied by faith amen but he says here everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was God's child amen and the child is heir of all things amen Give the Lord for praise amen thank you Lord amen amen glory be to his name amen many many men Hallelujah amen let's just take a praise break here amen while they switch the power we are Heirs of the father we are jointed and we are children of his kingdom We are family we are one one more time we are ears tell them don't wait for you to switch things [Music] we are children of his kingdom and we are family we are one one more time [Applause] [Music] and we are join tears with the sun we are children of his kingdom we are families now we come to a crucial point we just learned about Adam and how he operated and that was kind of taking away the scale taking away the amnesia but here is where he failed and it's an important time because we must catch the revelation of this amen Hallelujah amen he says but then why is your screen White is it not projecting it's coming on slowly okay let's go to the next one it says but then this is important now because this is where we are then the power he was given to me to himself that's true is where he felt does Christ want to reproduce himself oh come on now church amen yes this is the hour where Christ wants to reproduce himself amen and this is where Satan is attacking the church it was right in the reproduction yes Adam was about to reproduce himself but Satan preaches gospel first and he got the bearing ground to reproduce his own seed true life and Adam had to play catch-up to save the woman but then the power that was given to make himself to reproduce himself is where he fell that is why God now comes to Mary and he reproduces himself through Mary it's all through reproduction yes amen that is why now in Peter he tells you that we mustn't be Barren and unfruitful but we need to reproduce The Life of Christ that Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness is the image of Christ The Life of Christ that we need to reproduce in our lives Hallelujah now there's something there that people don't like [Music] because people want Power people love what we just read but they don't want to love the enemies because power without character is satanic now Jesus didn't only teach us about speaking to the mountain Jesus also spoke to us about our character didn't he tell us love our enemies yes do good to them that persecute you yes that hate you as much as we want to practice the power part we don't want to practice the other part that's why it becomes demonic character power without character is what's that word but but Power Wood character is put to rule that's what he goes on to say power with character is fit to rule and that's what we want to have now that is one of the reasons why people don't want the Holy Ghost is because the Holy Ghost who make you love your enemies the Holy Ghost will make you pray for them amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost will make you have mercy and compassion of Jesus Christ oh come on now come on now do we want all of him on none of him do you want some parts do we just want to operate the power so if you really want to have the victory in your life yes yes to make all your wrongs right go to those people that are never expecting an apology from you and go and apologize go and make things right go and phone them go and talk to them or do you want to go to your grave do you want to go with unforgiveness with unresolved issues not in this hour it's too late now why would we want to have come so far and then just have that little bit root of bitterness yes let me just keep this little bit voucher uh Jesus don't curse this root when I see them I like to have this bit of feeling for them come on now Jesus is teaching us about all things amen he says if they slap you offer them decide too don't tell them are you lucky I'm saved that's not what Jesus said you must do hey Jesus said turn the other cheek Jesus teaching us about our character that comes with the power amen otherwise think of it did Adam kill the serpent but yet he should have been enraged this man just slept with his wife he should have been enraged but he had a character so Jesus is teaching us all things and he's bringing us back to all things right so through the fall he lost that power then it becomes unconscious to the fact that's why we just read all of that is because if brother Branham didn't come to tell us all this about Adam we wouldn't have known this yes he says we become unconscious of the fact what is unconscious somebody can tell me yeah it's like lifeless why am I saying that that person is like in asleep but what comes to awaken us hello what what comes to awaken us say the right thing the bride hasn't added Revival yet it'll take what to wake up again say Lord make it thunder some people don't like the word Thunder Prophet says Thunder is a voice so let's say seven voices you like seven voices sounds less scary to you seven voices he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father that he lost this is where you'll get that he lost eternal life fellowship with God and power over the Earth right he lost that power he became unconscious of the fact he lost his relationship and friendship Fellowship of the father then he lost there and you know he lost eternal life right and all these great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through and now when man fell he lost us and when he lost when he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for so he just landed everything that Adam fell from and he's saying did you ever come to think what Christ redeemed us for him or back to amen now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to death now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again amen hallelujah so Satan wants to keep us thinking we slept to change something but Christ did it all amen he did it on the cross so I can walk in Victory I can walk in power yes yeah amen but you've got to have the free to believe it amen you've got to take God at his word amen amen amen hallelujah you can walk on water you can speak to mountains you can speak to the actually you can speak to the wind in all the potential lays within you amen hallelujah but faith in the world is going to produce the Greater Works thank you Lord that is why the prophet is saying get back to the word get back to the word get back to the word it seems like people are so thick amen they say it as a theory they say it's Amen but they never apply the word so ask yourself again I'm coming back to some Basics how much of time are we spending with the word how well do we know the word do we know where the promises of God lay in the world amen amen get rid of all those other things that are clogging yes yes come on now yes we've got to get rid of it amen we should be so in love with the word of God that it's the only thing on our mind Hallelujah amen you know you should sing You Are Always On My Mind tell your girlfriend tell your husband tell your wife amen you've got very unromantic people here they act like they don't know what I'm talking about hey I was thinking about you the whole day hey a poor fellow sleeping next to his brother he's singing that's his girlfriend he's talking to her and things like that in his sleep he's thinking he's thinking about it constantly talking about her constantly what am I trying to tell you or the point yes the thing you love the most you will spend most time with it amen hallelujah glory be to the Lord amen hallelujah somebody hold your Bible up amen say Lord I Thank you for this word I love the word amen glory glory glory amen hallelujah amen amen amen even if you don't have Medical Aid this is Miracle Aid amen yes what do you prefer Medicaid or miraculate miraculate is found in Mark 16 amen hallelujah so we don't only have Blessed Assurance we got miraculate amen when they phone you know from the coast into they ask you you got medically yeah I got Medical Aid amen amen yes they say which companies say mark 16. glory be to his name amen so he brought it back to its origin again so every day I want you to wake up thank you Lord I'm back in my image yes thank you Lord I'm in control of all things Lord Romans 8 is talking about creation longing for its master and the groaning here I am today Lord Jesus I take control of every situation I take control of all circumstances every place the soul of my foot shall tread I'm a possessor of it nothing shall be able to stand before me all the days of my life yes say it till you believe it yes how does something become unconscious how does something reside in your subconscious is where the property is going to go next because at one time you don't know how to ride a bicycle but did you give it up the first time you fell or did you keep practicing yes yes a brother are you telling me that faith can be practiced by the prophet says faith has muscles and I know muscle to get more muscles I must practice I must exercise I'm a strained to grow bigger muscle yes why does Jesus say that if you have the grain of a mustard seed Faith so he's telling you that faith can grow that the disciples ask Jesus increase our faith so faith is something that can be grown amen amen you can be weak in faith but then you can be strong in faith let the weak say I am strong amen so Faith must be exercised and we're getting to that place by God's grace yes amen amen hallelujah so take control of every situation every morning even midday take control of the situation amen every time you think pray say Lord I Thank You Lord that I'm a master of all circumstances amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen so when he gave us eternal life he brought us back into Eternal Fellowship Amen in relationship with God and through this restoration is coming back to power but remember the power as to come back with character amen glory be to his name now he says here the thing is since he restored man back to this place man in the fall has lost his conscience so when you lose your conscience you're not awake of what the father put him here on Earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affair with our own life domestic things it's all become so clogged with death until God can operate through those channels that he made a man fall but all is not Allah say Lord unclog me even now amen all God wants is a willing heart and a surrendered art and a submission amen say Lord send your plumbing now send your primary now yes amen is on call 24 hours and he doesn't ever call out free yes amen glory be to his name amen now if you think of God designed the human body how he designed the amen the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God made everything to work perfectly so that you can have one functioning human body right so it's the same way God pass in the body of Jesus Christ which is us each one of us functioning our capacity right he patented and he said the church the body of Christ in the same way God designed man's body that way and he designed the body of his son that way the church he designed us to come and he set us together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah amen so now we have Supernatural workings of God through these outlets in Heavenly places amen through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom knowledge Gifts of healing amen and all these different gifts he's got five spiritual gifts nine spiritual gifts to the church and five office gifts yes amen hallelujah and through this he lets out his power amen he lets out his Revelation to the people now how do we get into the body quickly someone tell me how we get into this body by one we are baptized Hallelujah here's something we're going to learn now very quickly I'm going to go through this amen and we can just learn these little principles so Satan is working by laws everything on Earth has a law in order for anything to work on the earth that's why scientists are so successful they work according to the laws that they studied yes so Satan works by laws as well the problem is telling us Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought to operate to Satan's abort operate so Satan sends a cancer right then man recognizes it so you see you must be able to receive it he says say the man recognizes it receives it maybe you didn't even know you were receiving it did Eve know she was receiving it no [Music] well if you go and read in other places what does the prophet say that stress worry fussing will do yeah does he say it'll give you sickness they say it'll bring cancers so we see how we can open up ourselves to these channels of Satan's gospel without knowing it we think we're having a fight with that brother and a fuss and a quarrel and a gossip and a hatred but what is he doing sure it's Satan's gospel man receives it Satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it but how is he doing it through deception you're thinking I'm standing up for myself but deceiving you every time you let that anger get out every time you get angry and you let yourself amen lose patience what is you doing you're operating this gift no amen for that the prophet is teaching us how Satan laws work Satan sends outtakes we recognize it and receive it and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man he's making his laws working man how much more of God with his power to make his laws work in man amen how much more God to his children to make his laws be recognized amongst these people of Divine Healing Revelation Powers gifts manifestations of the Spirit if the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things so we can count to Satan's gospel we can come to Satan's sickness yes amen even if sickness has come upon our body there is a remedy there is a cure it's the word of God Amen yes sir thank you so I believe this with all my heart I believe we are nearing the age that when people are going to recognize this thing thank you Lord win the rich Hallelujah we are in the 117th year of the church age this is the time this is a season amen amen yes amen glory be to his name amen amen so he says faith is an unconscious thing we need to practice it we need to build ourselves in the Most Holy Faith until it becomes second nature to us yes you know first when you're learning that guitar hey you got to watch every chord and you're going to place your fingers but as you practice as you become more skillful you don't even watch it you do it unconsciously you can even sing and play now right somebody can be talking to you can carry on and you can be doing things there why it becomes unconscious to you the prophet is saying Faith becomes unconscious thing you're so built on the word of God Amen thank you let me tell you something the only person not of me is that what Jesus was doing was himself yeah neither was he boastful he didn't say you guys you saw that hey you saw that one but you must watch his modern guys you see them operate they all over YouTube and everywhere they do it again you saw that one you saw that one they become boastful prideful when it's not them doing the works who's doing the works great is he that's in me so they are trying to take the glory they are trying to take the glory for themselves amen so Faith becomes an unconscious thing your real Faith your unconscious of it you don't know that faith is you have got it's an unconscious matter with you can you imagine Jesus questioning whether he had Faith or not to stop the winds sure or steal the waves who are faith enough to raise Lazarus up he never questioned his faith yes now the first thing before we can even have faith we've got to have some foundation for faith now if you know that this is the foundation for our faith the word of God heavens and Uncle pass away on Christ of solid rock I stand yes all other ground is sinking sand amen a house that's built on the word of God Amen a faith that's built on the word of God Amen afraid not based on the Theology of a seminary of an individual let me tell you something your faith is not built upon brother Branham your faith is built on the word of God there is no other Prophet that will lead you back to the Bible yes his message is designed to turn your heart back to the faith of the Bible yes you know that in a nutshell is the most simplest form of understanding what Malachi 4 is amen he's coming to turn your heart back to the faith in the Bible so don't ask me [Music] you can bear witness to them you young men yeah much of time you'll spend young women how much of time do you spend reading the Bible yes in a day how much of time do we spend speaking the word of God out of our mouth just any Scripture even for now if you don't even know the scriptures the scripture that you know just speak it out the Lord will bless you for it your faith comes when it's settled in the human heart it's a settled thing it's finished you know it's done amen amen you tell your wife I'll see you later how you know you're going to see it you have such confidence that when you get into your car you're going to start it it's going to start you have confidence that you're not gonna have a flat tire on the way we have confidence amen that there's no traffic you tell us here at a certain time you have confidence it's unconscious you don't even know and I don't know if you know sometimes you're even driving and you're not even paying attention to the role you that spend more time on the road you'll know you're thinking about you're you're sitting there on the beach and you're busy uh driving here like even some of you some of you in your bed you're sitting here physically your mind is already asleep That's The Power of your mind but the Jesus say I have faith in your mind he says confess with your mouth believe in your heart amen we're going to close now amen we'll just leave it there amen Hallelujah so one more thing here I think I just got one more right is there one more there he says you've got it so he's talking about a natural thing but I want you to get the spiritual meaning you've done things so much in your life that you become accustomed to those laws until it's a natural thing we have got to be so accustomed to Faith so accustomed to the word of God that it becomes a natural thing in our lives that is why we are speaking on faith in the world to produce the Greater Works amen you know this is the the lie that Satan brought upon the people in our Circle is that don't worry brother you receive the word for your age just wait for that time you don't read the word you don't pray you don't do nothing anymore they only want to say they're root resting without a consecrated life God is not going to pour his power on the people because what did we just say power without character is satanic so we can't continue the same old way and think that one day suddenly God is just because to close off events and to get his program done is I'm saying never mind these people are so slaughtered let me just pour my power on them did you not open up the Earth and swallow those people did he not drown except eight people do you think he's just going to do it just for the sake of doing it every time he spared people is because they repent to look at them they turn from their Wicked Ways yes amen people that are obedient and willing to surrender and and turn to God and say Lord we are willing to forsake all our Theology and everything we know for your presence for your power for your character so remember when you're praying for his power pray for his character yes and where can all of these things be found his character amen where does he teach us blessed are the meat here blessed us is he not teaching Us in his word yes the character of Christ so if you want to know his character we read his word if we want to know his power we read his word yes everything we need this is the manual to the supernatural the Bible we've got to walk in it so faith in the word to produce the Greater Works you may be looking for other things you thought this would be something imaginary that you'll be able to do the Greater Works I'm telling you now and what the prophet is saying it's faith in the word to produce the greater work so they say in the beginning there go to our opening scripture let's just read today the opening scripture amen Saint John 15 7. close with the scripture what does it say if you abide in me and my what abide in you you shall ask what you will amen and it shall be done unto you now let's give the Lord a good anchor of Grace
