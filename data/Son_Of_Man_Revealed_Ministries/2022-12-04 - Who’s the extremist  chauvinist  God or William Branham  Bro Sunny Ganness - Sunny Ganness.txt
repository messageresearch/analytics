gospel one more time and I went to bed and this morning I can say that Jesus Christ is alive amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I want to thank you so much and this message this morning you know I miss my brother pastaroni very very much and I want to get dedicated this message to him because he was one man then always stood firm for this message amen has anybody had anything to say if anybody had anything to say brother only would be the first one to stand up open the scriptures tend to the word open the back open the Bible open the message and this morning I'm going to preach the message dedicated to him shall we stand we're going to turn to the book of Thessalonians we're going to go through a lot of scriptures this morning time that are supposed to reach this message in 2020. however it never be realized but God has allowed me this morning to preach this message again first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1. for yourselves Brethren no our our answer into you that it was not in vain but even after that we had suffered before and we're shameful and treated as ye know at Philippines and we were and we Lord amen we were born in our on our God to speak unto you the gospel I'm sorry you see that's what happens not been away for three years you get nervous and you you just go second place now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together and to him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that they shall not come except they be the step they become a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition amen amen praise the Lord let's go to 1 Timothy 21 chapter 4. 1 Timothy chapter four well it's amen amen now the spirit speak it expressly that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith um just go backwards Philippines Ephesians cheers [Music] let's go back to 10 finally my brother and be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the violence of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against the powers against the rulers of the darkness and of this world and the spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil days and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about good truth and having having on the breastplate of righteousness amen praise the Lord this morning our subject our subject will be who is an extremist a chauvinist is gone oh William Branham now you heard this morning and you hear all the time the people around the world inside to make this message into something like a myth but it is not so we came we have read the scriptures and we found this morning letting the last days meaning they shall become a falling away first and there will be people that will depart from the faith now why would these people depart from the faith and the only reason is they are disgruntled and this kind of people will always have something to say and something not good this kind of people will always have a negative attitude towards anything and we find there's so many discredible people today that had left this message summer has gone said they've been in the message for 10 years some say 12 years some years some say 40 years some say 50 years and I want to tell you this morning you can be in this message for 10 years you can sit in this place for 10 years you can sit in this place for 20 years or 50 years all you have been told by somebody that this message was the truth and then later on you've been told by somebody that this message is false because you were sitting in this place without a revelation yes amen he was sitting in this place without knowing who you are you were sitting in this place without knowing where you come from all you are doing is to listen to somebody to say this is the truth and then listen to somebody who says this is bonus so what you've been doing you have not been reading you have not been reading your Bible you've never been reading the books you'll never be listening to the tapes but you have been listening to people yes and forming your Doctrine yes and that is why you can say that you know why you were dissatisfied and this is this is not the truth thank you and I can conclude this morning to say if you were living in a garage for 50 years that doesn't make you a Moroccan because we're born in a stable and that didn't make him another makes you a believer so I've seen one clip and when I noticed there very very carefully she's already had a haircut she's already tinted here she's already started using jeans and tackies and she was so disgruntled she said I've been in this message but I've been in this place for 12 years believing this is the truth and somebody comes along and say this is not the truth and then they told her there was something about the cloud the cloud was not real and then there's somebody told her that this Prophet was a false prophet what her problem was because the moment you leave this message you will go into a frenzy and the devil will just take control of you in the message and she went into that mode now to cut her hair change her hair use her pants use the top and stand and say this message is false and then we find that if you find a journalist comes along and say well you know after after examining all the facts and bring through some interviews we find that William Brennan was an extremist and we find William Branham was a chauvinist you know I'll tell you this morning that we will go through the scriptures to find out who was and who is because they will nobody who's there who's a chauvinist he had to defend William Branham neither am I here to defend the gospel because William Branham was born a prophet before the foundation of the world amen he preaches gospel before the foundation of the world and therefore I cannot defend him and you can say how how to how can you say that William Branham was he said before you were formed in your mother's womb I made you a prophet amen and if it was for that Prophet it would be for this prophet because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we find that we cannot defend the Bible is our book like any other thing in the natural a country has its Constitution and the country that has its Constitution will tell you this is the rule and this is a law and if there's no rules and there's no laws there's no punishment there has to be a rule and there has to be a law in order for you to have a punishment so if people tell you now that the Bible because God got lost and God has instructed us to do certain things and not to do certain things if you say the book is not a law then you tell me this morning what is the law thou shall not and thou shalt not you see the cloud people are disputing the cloud they are saying well the cloud was there because some death will pass and that jet went past and made that cloud that was in 1963 and in 1963 if that cloud if that jet made that cloud today we have more Jets than 1963. and I've never seen another cloud like that and some people say that Brandon was not there but you find in a quote Robert Brown says and you see where the brand always said something in the presence of two or three Witnesses yes in order to to to to to to to to confirm what he's saying and we find here in the Easter sea you know the funniest thing is you know I Was preparing this message and I was asking the Lord you know what I need to go look for something about the cloud and so I could actually quote and uh while I was thinking about it and I just had this book on the table and it was the Easter seal and then I looked and said no maybe I can find it here yes I did find it there so which means that God Was preparing so I could just find things just easily you know and he said you see I saw seven angels come down but here he says there were other brothers were there you know he said seven angels come down didn't Life Magazine pack it up and ask the Frog of of it floated across yeah 27 miles high and 30 miles across is it not fed short man these others Gene Norman then sitting back there stood right right there when when them seven angels when seven angels appeared right there on the hill it shook the hills for miles around he shook the hill for miles around like that they stood seven angels and throwed a sword in in your hands said go home and open the seven seas that they that are given that are given and there they are true mysteries of marriage and divorce and now you see people don't read and you want to take things from other people and you want to say well it's happening it's happening around us also you see when you start getting involved in gossips when you start getting involved in things like that it becomes a problem because you are not reading the prophet stays saved with the tapes read the books and stay with the books and you will never be wrong I've come into this message in a very very difficult time when there were very few books there were very few people we had to go and search those were difficult times there was no push buttons for us we had no cell phones we had no computers where we could just push there and say okay let's look for this we never had that we came in a difficult time so we had to read and God has blessed us through the Bible says millions of people died people just died young children died babies died with them but the waters covered them up and perish so who was the extremist was no other extremist or was God the extremist you enjoy your conclusion this morning God was giving nobody extra instruction likewise he gave brother Branham the instrument he was given instruction to go out and set the people free Moses we go there to to to to to Exodus Exodus 12. 29 foreign Exodus 12 29 he came to pass when the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt and from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne and for all the first born imagine the mother is looking at the firstborn child dying we're going to take our uh our talk this morning here was Moses giving the instruction and he was telling them you know what this is what's going to happen and the people refuse to listen to to Moses and then when Moses departed from there when Moses departed from there after that when chepedo eventually set them free I'm sure the people must have been there and say you know Moses Moses Moses was an extremist he killed all our babies that's what he must have told the people must have sent me he was an extremist he killed all our babies our babies all died because of Moses but who is a god of love God is a God that will come to Satan but is a god of wrath also is a jealous God he will not take anything else except what he what he has instructed us to do you cannot even go eat this way or you cannot go that way because God in in the way and when the people head go into the gate through the camp and slay every man his brother word of Moses and they felt of the people that day three thousand now you see when God has given an instruction a people delayed the people saw Moses delay and when people saw Moses delaying what they did they came Falling Away they came falling away because Moses delayed and what the people did they started doing their own things no no no no no no you go into the wrong way and that's exactly what happened when they left when Moses went to bring the Commandments they left the gospel and what happened three thousand men women children everybody oh we're saved oh asleep I want to tell you this morning God's right God is what is dangerous let us not fall into that time and three thousand men die woman who was the next two of us was it Moses was it Moses or was it God it was God's instructions God gave the instruction and it was only carried out by the prophet and so that is why we confirmly stand and say brother Brandon only came the caves is set in the caves set overnight fast to breed came down and opened the word he never just come to the pulpit to preach show me one man show me one man that had such a great ministry one man at that time when brother Brandon was around we are all robots where Billy grabbed him multi-million millions and millions of people were healed millions of souls received but yet you can say that this he died because God called it over to leave the blind to leave the black defend for herself because he was born did he have the premature death he was crucified upside down so let us not play with words God had his work done and it's finished he went home to Glory to meet his wife to meet the Believers out there one of these days we are going to go to Glory are we going to meet [Music] you see that is why sometimes we have to be careful what we do we have to be careful what we say don't get involved with people with unnecessary discussion I've come to a place in my life I said Lord I am here to preach your gospel I'm not here to debate your gospel I'm not here to reason on your gospel I am not here to tell who's wrong and who's right when I finish preaching and let them decide who's right and what's wrong the decision have to be dead so let's move on praise the Lord are you happy that's fine are you with me amen praise the Lord we go to numbers 16 31. you know sometimes the devil he wants to play around especially with the ministers he wants to attack them you want to put them in a frenzy finally always the ministers are attacked and you know when the minister is attacked he knows it he knows because he's being attacked are we find numbers 1631 and it came to pass am I right as he had as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground claimed in and that was on okay let's go for that okay yeah we find that Moses is now now telling the people listen don't this is dating a quarter right they dated in court they've come in now and they you know started to to to to to start to what you call uh challenge the ministry challenge is the ministry and telling Moses you know Moses you it's not only you that can can can can preach the word it is not only you Moses that can can perform miracles we are from the elliptical order we also can do the same thing and now they didn't call ahead the disagreements you see if I can't sit in a message today we have people have a lot of disagreements but you want to be careful with your disagreements whether they're lining up with the word of God or whether they're lining up with the message or the message in the word of brother Branham you preach the Bible so you've got to see whether you're lining up with your disagreement and here was Dayton and Connor continuing to to fasten and and God is telling him you know what I'll open the ground and swallow these people and mo you see Moses had a spirit of God and you find always the ministers will have a spirit of God in them they will always try to protect you they will always try to stand in the gap for you and that is exactly that was happening and Moses was trying to protect you continue to try and protect them but they wouldn't have none they would have nothing and we find yes see what happened and it came to pass as he had made the end and speaking all these words and the ground cleared asunder and that was under them and the Earth opened up their mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men and all the men and the and all the gods all the goods and they and all that pertained to them went down a light into the pit and the Earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation and all Israel that were around about them fled fled at the Cry of them for they said lest the Earth swallow us up also and they came out a fire from the Lord and consumed 250 250 men that offer incense you see they wanted to take the place of the priesthood and that's what happened 250 men God consumed them the rest of them they were called under the ground God swallowed them up and now who Who was the extremists now we're going to call Moses in extremists no Moses was only time to protect him but they wanted to take Moses's place many a time we find the same thing people want to just you see let me tell you something I've been preaching for very very long time and as I'm standing here I'm very nervous I'm very nervous every time I come here I'm very nervous and some people think you know what I can preach better than this mandate I can get there Constantia and could preach I can preach he's losing his words you can't read properly he's losing his words you don't know what to say but I want to tell you something even if you come here to convene for the first time you come here to convey for the first time you're going to have a problem because the spirit of God will never want you to say something wrong and that is why ministers become nervous when they come before the problems when they come to atmosphere so remember one thing amen God is not in the numbers amen God is not in the numbers so we're going to just be careful with that the moment you go in line that is why when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time he went beyond the curtain of time and when he saw the bride going out of lying dead by all winds of Doctrine let us not be shaken by the discounted people that have left the message they have never left the message because they are never part of us all they came in with the intellectual fate yes they never had a revelation of this message and therefore they went out and then they could go to Facebook YouTube wherever they want and to the journalists and whatever whatever place they want to go to time and bring this message down this message will never come down amen this message comes from the Throne of God hallelujah yes amen and the prophet came from the Throne of God he brought the message from there because the Bible says before the foundation of the world he ordained us where we come from where we're going to God is not an extremist God has laid down these laws God has laid down his rules he's not an extremist God laid his rules done for his people not for the whole world for his people and these people will obey the rules of God amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord yes we go to our next line of thought s have I done and when I saw among the spoils The goodly Babylon garments and the 200 seconds of silver and The Witch of gold a 50 second wait then I coveted them and took them and behold they are hidden in the Earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it so Joshua sent messages and ran into the tent and behold and behold it was hidden in the in his tent the silver under it and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto Joshua and all of the children of Israel laid them laid them out before the Lord and Joshua and all Israel within took Aiken and Zera and the Surah and the garments and the wedge and the gold his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his acid and his sheep and he's still and that said they had brought them and unto the valley of Echo and Joshua said why Hester traveled us the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all Israel stored him stoned him with him with the stones and built them with fire and after they had stoned them with stones they raised up over him again great heap of stone unto the this day and the Lord and the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name the name of the place was called the valley of Echo and this day it is yes there is a remembrance there is a remembrance of this it is not there it is there and it could be identified so the Bible is not a myth the Bible is not some solitary the Bible has some great stories it has love stories you've got War Stories he's got hate stories he's got everything in it so if you want to read a book you read the Bible and who was the extremists in this we finish with Moses we finish with Noah now we come to Joshua a man of God prophet of God a leader of God who led the people into a promised land was he an extremist he killed him one man did the sin but the whole family had to die so be careful you see this is where we stand we have a great God and a god with instruction this morning and they can and his family had to be kissed wiped out and that was the instruction of God now you've gone through the motion we've gone through all these things that we see now and placing God and their prophets we place God in the prophets in the two sides to see whose instruction and who wants to be blamed nobody is to blame because God's instruction William Branham did not speak his own words he did not preach his own words he preached the gospel the only he only said what the Bible said and no other point and never pointed anybody to himself he was always pointing people to Jesus Christ at no time he ever said somebody to come to his church he always pointed them to Christ he always said to him stay with your bastard he always say them stay with the church but they had to come a time when he had to say come out of here my people do not be partakers of a plague because there was a plague today now we find brother Brandon would preach you say he was a chauvinist he never hated woman all he did was preach the gospel if you want to look with God said about the trousers that's exactly what he preached it's Abomination unto the Lord thy God for a woman to put on the garments of a man so we can find that in general Deuteronomy 22 5. let's go there for the sake of we get to the other part just now it says the woman shall not wait that would pertain it unto a man neither seven men put on the garments put on the woman's put on woman's gun for all that do our Abomination unto thy Lord thy God have a scripture and that's what he preached so he didn't he existed he all corrected them and told them to do the exact thing and you see today what has happened you know the man that actually put the woman into her pants when he was dying he regretted it he wrote a letter that he regretted it I can't get his name now but he said he regretted the day he put the woman on the pants so he knew in his country that he knew now the woman said no you know what we go there we are so stuck up we can't use our makeups we can't use our things we can't use our pens we can't use our uh uh uh our jewelry and you find it they become so difficult and if you see our sisters they glows just natural I've seen in the news somebody someone of the celebrities said she's not using makeup anymore she want to go natural and then she also realized that makeup makes you look different from what you meant to me let's go to Genesis 35. you just bring this backwards this morning can I go another 20 minutes Genesis 35 and Christ go after battle dwell there and make thee and alter unto God that appeared unto thee went down fled from the face from the face of Israel then Jacob said his household and all that were with him put away the strange gods strange gods now you see the problem was not assurance all he was doing is to preach this gospel by going among you and be clean and change your garments and let us rise and go up to battle and I will make thee an altar unto God who answered and said in the day of my distress and was with me in all the way which I went and they gave unto Jacob all the strange Gods which were in their hands and all their earrings which were in their years and Jacob hid them under the oak tree under the oak which was inshakable greatest mistake he made you put it under the tree he should have bend them all you see so you see that is what it is they are strange gods and we put them in the Years people put them in the ears put them in the hands put them around the neck and you say that uh a woman is equal to a man no it can never be that was never the ordinances of God the ordinance of God always you should be under the subjection of your husband you should be under the subjects in the rulership of your of your husband never over that and now now here they say that brother Brendan was a chefiness because he preached this let's go and see let's go to Genesis 3 16. that's where the curse was [Music] and Grace came in John 3 16. Genesis 3 16 took the test John 3 16 gave you the grace and the blessing hallelujah amen praise unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in total thou shall bring forth children and the desire shall be to the husband and he shall rule over shall rule over thee because you have to be under the subjection and that is why we got such a chaos this morning because people the the the the sisters want to be above the man they want to take cruel you know sometimes you might say that I am not I don't use the pants says about death he says if you rule over your husband you're already using the pants so always remember if you if you if you if you always nothing your husband and and trying to to get him get him under your control then you got the pants on you can learn to have a nice long dress doesn't make any difference no we find that God is always people so man is always misinterpreting the word of God and therefore we can find ourselves in this situation oh my God you see we find today the present day the present-day evangelists and the Great Men of the so-called Great Men of God today I've misled the sisters and two will invoke them away from the gospel of God we find the day and put it the woman on the pedestal we find The Woman become preachers women become convenience and we've seen this on a regular basis and imagine a convenience coming in the front with a mini skirt to convene I suppose that must be a Christian minister because the only Christian church so God and then you decide find a convener coming up with the jeans and the the talks are gone low preachers say nothing about it that must be a Christian jeans for the woman and then you find them fully painted probably get the Christian lipsticks from somewhere I believe this recently TD Jakes T.D Jakes I want to tell you this morning you're not a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you are just a motivational speaker that is all you are what you said came from the pit of Hell what you just said came from the pit of Hell you cannot release the woman they are under the subject of their husbands anything that is against the word of God and contrary to the word of God comes directly from the pit of Hell yes so therefore sisters don't go into the YouTube and watch these people preaching you have 1200 messages they will destroy your home they say there is no Protestant anymore what did the Protestants die for 68 million Christians died mothers stomachs were opened the babies were taken out they were fed to the Lions they were fed to the drugs ever put out a street balls lighting would turn on the head that died horrible death because they were Protestant protesting against what against the Catholic Church today you Protestant Joel Austin TD Jake whoever you are you are going there and calling him your father [Music] you have denied this faith and you call Brother Branham a false prophet you must get your head turned around God is not a joke if you're in a motivation amen Protestant we are still Protestants we will never join the Catholic Church amen and one is because of the doctrine it's a doctrine of the devils therefore this morning we should know where we're going we should know how we stand this gospel 68 million of them died because of us so we can stand today we find this morning that is why people are saying this morning the world is going into a chaotic mood you know they're saying celebrities saying they have stunned the crowd because they came out unto the podium with a see-through garment where did you see a see-through marriage gown what happened to the men they became so sissified with a see-through wedding gown if you want to see where where this all comes from so those are the demons that sitting on your head so you need to get played up and start covering your body you're talking about cutting your hair you can find it in the book of I'm cutting yeah you can find it in the book of First Corinthians chapter 11. which says the woman shall not cut ahead it's not better the blood who said a woman should not cut it it's the Bible and you know when this happened this happened after 1981. it got worse after 1981. why Princess Diana every pastor's wife cut the hair according to Princess Diana's Style yes the Diana Spirit went through the world president was gone off the scene but he foresaw this I questioned my pastor he said me no how long is long and how short is shot so you got to think about that you go and think about it I see if this was a length if you took out one centimeter it's shot already so don't try your uh your intellectual uh your intellectual feed in this matter and in 1981 that's what happened the whole world went into a frenzy because Princess Diana had a a real good Style and I come to church and and I was in the denomination at that time gone to a church and see my pastor's wife had long hair and the next moment that his style was up but all in my heart I wasn't in the message at the time but I just believed it was wrong I believed it was wrong is it because you're the seed of God you can believe it is wrong and when you believe in something in your heart tells you this is wrong do not do not deny it do not push it aside yes it is wrong accept it and go and search it we find this morning [Music] we find this warning we are in a certain condition serious they have now they have now uh legalize prostitution they have legalized gay managers they have legalized unisex toilets she says you're going to be careful now if I think I'm a lady I can just go into a ladies toilet if the sister thinks she's a below we find it strange that man can accept this find it very very strange let us go to the Bible let us go to 19194. you sit outside the Angels decided to sit outside but not being a man that saw how is is a his uncle uh uh conducted himself as a Christian he said the Angels no you can't stay outside here come we have to go into our house and he took them into his house and then he made them rest and you see what happened but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of Sodom come past the house with me the surrounding the house around but all men and young men both old and young and all the people from every quarters and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in through this through this night bring them out unto us that we may know them and lot went out the door and with us a lot went out the door unto them and shut out the door after him and said I prayed thee brethren do not show Wicked behold now I have two daughters which have not known man let not known man let me I pray you bring them unto you and you do what you want to them you see this it's not putting the brand into it he's not his word it's God's word and yeah God destroyed Solomon by fire and we are in the same condition today nothing has changed it's even worse than I think that time let's go to Romans 24. I mean Romans 1 . 24 recording wherefore God also gave them up to unclean uncleanliness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a life and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto via depiction for even their women did change the natural use into what into that which is against nature and likewise also men living the natural use of the woman burned in their eyes in their lust one towards another man men could men working that in their knowledge God gave them up over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with their unrighteousness [Music] that's your ceramic conditions today it's right here and this is not brother branham's word he was not a chauvinist he was not an extremist he preached the gospel as it is bare-handed and that is why today we can say truly this is the truth this is God's word for the day amen this is God this is God in action once more and I want to remind you my brother my sister I've really took some time to preach this gospel to to search this thing because you know I I I always thought that we need to clarify this because the people out there don't know what the preachers are doing they are misleading the people and listening the people to believe that they can do what they feel like doing we're going to close this one let us go to truth Timothy 2 16. closing you know when people say they're closing we just say the closing 2 Timothy two sorry it says but San profane and vain babbling for they will increase unto more ungodliness you see sometimes we get involved and we get involved in a debate we get involved because you cannot change these people you cannot change them but we get involved in serious debates he says forget that for now because we are living right at the brink of his coming let us prepare ourselves for our journey let us unpack all the things that we shouldn't have you see it says they will increase unto more angularly and their world will eat and don't eat canker of whom is infinitas who concerning the truth third saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith summer we have the same thing today people say the Rapture took place in 1963. 3 yes and let us stand up for this gospel that was another one which is supposed to have gone first yes but LeBron believed the Trinity but not the way the Catholic Church believed it you see and I'm sorry for you that are in the denomination because you've lost out and you've lost her desperately you know because the Bible says I think in James 2 19. so he is happy because there are people that are believing three gods and he believes one God you see let us therefore this morning look unto Jesus amen the author the finisher of our faith he is so good to us he's never left us he's never forsaked us this message is from the Throne of God this message is real this message is true amen this message cannot be cannot be exchanged for anything in the world whether you call it an extremist whether you can call it a chauvinist whether you can call it whatever you want this is a Gospel of Jesus Christ amen and the prophet just preached that he shared that with us and that is why today we are ready to go home we are ready to go Within and meeting I never come here to defend brother Brandon neither defend the gospel never did the Bible the Bible is true and for you journalists and it is atheists atheists have nothing to stand on but you generous that are Christian you go out there and do a proper research on William Branham and you will find you will find for yourself you will get convicted [Music] random message there is no contradictions there is only convictions so if you want to do a proper journalism of William Branham I challenge you to take these books and read amen and anybody else that want to want to challenge this message there's a hundred and twenty one thousand two hundred messages and you can go and find your contradiction and I guarantee you when you feel evicted and converted may God add his Blessing to his word of God grace we have a message of love we have a message of instruction we've got a message of Repro and we've got a message of Correction yes yes so let us take our correction let us call as paid his pay and not a garden tool this morning we cherish this message may God bless you this morning while we sing Hallelujah I need the I need [Music] to leave [Music] [Music] oh she get out this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] this morning raise your hands to the glory of God again [Music] [Music] oh please to let me walk with you two times [Music] [Music] [Music] okay later [Music] foreign [Music]

fresh anointing of his holy spirit this morning if you say Lord I want to know more of your word Lord I want wisdom knowledge and understanding of your word he takes the Holy Ghost to open up that word to you if you're Desiring that tonight this morning we are the Lord will want to meet with your need maybe if you're standing in a gap for a loved one maybe in a bachelor's in condition baby they

came here seeking your face this morning they come here because Allah they'll be living in Father we need more of you in our life amen and amen amen Emmanuel blessed this morning amen amen the Bible said that Scofield will rise up in the last days saying where is the promise of his coming amen and that's what we had in this end time amen we had people getting was getting wondering where where is the promise William Brandon spoke about the coming of the Lord Ray is the promise then he started to reason with the word you see when you start to use reasoning and not Faith you start to bring doubt amen right so it's wisdom versus faith and that's what we had and therefore we had a falling away because we're living in a time where by the food they shall know them you can hide seed bunch of clonides fruits and you'll see in the in this hour now all the fruits are manifesting amen whatever fruit was sold in the ground is showing in the sour that's that is why in this hour You Can't Hide what you are the Bible said he that is Holy will be holy still these are he that is filthy will be filthy still but the Bible said we must contend for the faith amen amen but as times where you also can't cast your pearls amongst the swine yeah so you've got to use wisdom and you've got to follow the leadership of the holy spirit in all things amen and we thank God that we live in our but this is our with the holy spirit that is leading the church and that is why we're Desiring always to be led by the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit can discern the hearts and intents of the heart and he knows exactly what we need to be sustained in this hour amen is the holy spirit that is going to see us through and he's looking through the fivefold ministry amen we've got to recognize that people come and cast doubt and trying to find faults in the prophet's Ministry but everything that a prophet spoke about and he kept speaking about a bride tell him it's too late there's already a bride manifested upon the Earth and tell him it's too late because I am the manifested word in this hour yes if you want to say that William Branham is false whatever he spoke about I manifest the word is manifested through me in this hour amen you tell him he's far too late now we can see the scriptures being manifested from Genesis to Revelation because why if you were to message by intellect you will fall yeah but if you had it that's why Jesus said unto you unless you are born again you cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven that is why you've got to be burned again and when you are born again you realize that it's not your own intellect yeah but now because you are part of God and you are now seated in Heavenly places you are hearing directly from the kingdom of God Amen so we thank God for his word which is the absolute and it's an infallible word amen he said let every man's word be alive but my word that shoots amen and the word of God can only come through a prophet not to some motivational speaker no the word of God must come through a prophet amen and the fight for Murder She will pick it up not another word not another gospel yes but the same word that came through the prophet the faithful ministry will come and Echo it again amen and it will bring it down to our modern day to show that show the modern day events made clear by this word amen modern day events Me Clear My Professor prophecy amen and as we see that ours are we living in the world is becoming more clearer and more clear until it becomes so crystallized that nobody can take you away from the same man why would why would you want to leave his word with the same word that you are receiving you know that this world is going to give you that body shape [Music] Amen in closing we'll sing that song I'm rejoicing night and day amen but before we sing that song included philosopher the submission to just say the opposing prayer and then we'll sing the song foreign [Music] thank you okay [Music] here we go remember to take off the study for bring the word amen you wouldn't say that it's in the same study that was laying in hospital a couple of months ago so we thank God we can see the miracle and these things increase our faith because we know the same God of William Branham the same God of Abraham yeah amen amen he's the same yesterday today and forever we don't speak about a god of History we speak about a living God living amongst these people amen I'm rejoicing night and day I'm rejoicing that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] about here we are Hallelujah [Music]
