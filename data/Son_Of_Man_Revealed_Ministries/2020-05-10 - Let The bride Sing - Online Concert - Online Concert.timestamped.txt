[10:03] the supreme
[10:06] sacrifice
[10:08] that was leading
[10:12] [Music]
[10:14] that could buy
[10:16] eternal life for you and me
[10:25] had it not been for a place
[10:31] called Mount of Calvary.
[10:36] And had it not been
[10:39] for the old rugged
[10:42] cross.
[10:47] And had it not been for a man
[10:53] called Jesus.
[10:58] Then forever
[11:01] my soul would
[11:04] be lost.
[11:09] And I'm so glad
[11:12] he was willing
[11:14] to drink that bitter cup.
[11:20] Although he prayed,
[11:23] Father, let it pass from me.
[11:30] And I'm so glad
[11:34] he never called heaven's angels.
[11:41] From these hands or these nails that set
[11:47] me free.
[11:51] And had it not been for a place
[11:57] called Mount Calary,
[12:02] and had it not been for the old rugged
[12:08] cross,
[12:12] and had it not been for a man
[12:18] called Jesus,
[12:24] Then forever
[12:27] my soul would
[12:30] be lost.
[12:34] So I'll cherish
[12:38] the old rugged
[12:41] cross
[12:45] till my draw
[12:48] feels at last time
[12:51] laid down.
[12:53] [Music]
[12:56] I will cling
[12:59] to the old rugged
[13:02] cross
[13:04] [Music]
[13:07] and exchange
[13:09] it someday
[13:12] for a crown.
[13:15] [Music]
[13:18] had it not been
[13:21] for a place
[13:23] called Mount Calvary.
[13:26] [Music]
[13:28] And had it not been
[13:32] for the old rugged
[13:35] cross.
[13:39] And had it not been for a man
[13:45] called Jesus.
[13:50] And forever
[13:53] my soul would
[13:56] be lost.
[13:59] [Music]
