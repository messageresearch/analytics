[38:13] seeing mark and Jason thank you very
[38:16] much for everyone that's contributed in
[38:18] every way it was a real neat those as
[38:22] Sunday school kids have a were able to
[38:25] put together that song item so that was
[38:26] that was really special thank you very
[38:28] much for that for everyone who was
[38:30] involved I mean god bless you richly so
[38:33] I'd like to greet everyone this morning
[38:35] in the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[38:36] Christ and Sunday morning again it's
[38:40] just amazing how quickly these weeks fly
[38:43] past and another week done and
[38:47] tomorrow's is a statutory holiday and I
[38:51] think there's very few people that it's
[38:53] gonna actually affect at the moment
[38:55] given our current circumstances but I
[38:58] trust that that we that we're all having
[39:01] a place of time with our families and so
[39:03] forth so I I'm so excited to have
[39:09] brother Eugene preach for us this
[39:11] morning he he's got the easy end of the
[39:14] bargain though for him it's four o'clock
[39:16] in the afternoon or something similar
[39:18] and so it's not quite that for that in
[39:22] terms of I had to get up at 3 o'clock
[39:25] last weekend at 3 o'clock in the morning
[39:28] but either way that's not what it's
[39:31] about we're just looking forward to to a
[39:33] place a time today and just just trust
[39:35] that that God will give us a good time
[39:38] together around his word and that the
[39:40] Lord will bless us with his presence and
[39:41] that we will that that her brother has
[39:45] the freedom to to minister but the Lord
[39:47] puts on his heart and that the Lord has
[39:49] something for us I believe he does and
[39:50] I'm excited about it I just really
[39:53] looking for brother Eugene mentioned to
[39:55] me yesterday that that he hears fresh
[39:59] inspiration the ludus has laid something
[40:01] very specific on his heart and and
[40:03] that's that's wonderful and we just
[40:06] excited about that so we have a couple
[40:10] of free requests
[40:12] I had a contact from brother
[40:16] Shabazz Eden Pakistan who he sent me
[40:21] some pictures of a young girl in the in
[40:24] the church she's in hospital with
[40:27] infection in her intestines and asked if
[40:31] we could keep her in pray so we want to
[40:34] take her to the Lord this morning I mean
[40:36] say she's in a real bad condition and
[40:39] then also brother mark that friend of
[40:42] mine back in South Africa it seems like
[40:45] the the situation with him is he's
[40:47] getting quite quite negative from a
[40:55] natural perspective and so just to to
[40:59] put you in the picture a little bit so
[41:00] it's now nearly three weeks ago that he
[41:04] went in and he was gonna have that
[41:05] operation so because of the coronavirus
[41:10] stuff going on his wife wasn't allowed
[41:12] to go to the hospital with him so he had
[41:15] the operation well in fact his wife
[41:18] wasn't even sure whether he was going to
[41:20] have the operation they because I don't
[41:22] know if you remember but he's his heart
[41:25] wasn't going to be in the right place to
[41:28] to take operation and things like that
[41:29] and then she got a phone call from the
[41:32] doctor the next day that the operation
[41:35] went well and then for four I think two
[41:40] and a half weeks or more she didn't hear
[41:42] anything she couldn't find him they
[41:44] switched his phone off she didn't even
[41:46] know where they had his phone with him
[41:48] or nothing and just could not get hold
[41:51] of them she found the doctors she found
[41:53] that the hospital just couldn't get
[41:55] through couldn't get any information out
[41:57] of him and then they discharged him they
[42:01] or two ago and it seems like he's is
[42:05] very incoherent now and my understanding
[42:09] is and this might be wrong with my
[42:11] understanding is that he's not even able
[42:13] to communicate properly with the family
[42:16] or anyone so he's in a he's not in a in
[42:19] a good situation obviously the families
[42:21] he's going through a hard time as well
[42:24] so if we can just like take those
[42:27] requests the Lord this morning and and
[42:29] just trust that the Lord will step on
[42:32] the scene I mean we we excited to see to
[42:37] see that the Lord will will undertake
[42:42] folding so so if you have a need on your
[42:47] heart this morning you can also make it
[42:49] known to the Lord as we take it to the
[42:51] Lord in prayer now precious and loving

[46:15] excitement in my heart this morning I
[46:17] can't brother Eugene as a very close
[46:20] friend and a precious brother and I've
[46:23] probably learned more from him than from
[46:26] any other brother in terms of just
[46:28] sharing different things and so on and I
[46:31] just really highly regard him we also
[46:33] had wonderful fellowship with him last
[46:36] year when we visited Canada and just
[46:40] really appreciate my brother brother
[46:43] Eugene you just like your liberty and
[46:46] and just goes through all these you so
[46:49] brother Eugene I'm gonna
[46:50] and over to you now and just just just
[46:54] let the Lord have his way god bless you
[46:58] my brother
[47:04] hey maybe Saints it's good to be with
[47:08] you here this afternoon and it's a
[47:10] special time to be able to have
[47:13] fellowship together via via these
[47:17] [Music]
[47:19] and man's a type of what God has always
[47:24] been right now I'm in halfway around the
[47:27] world and I've got an instrument in my
[47:31] hand at SAP that sends a signal to a
[47:34] satellite and that satellite may send it
[47:37] to one or two or three more and then it
[47:39] sends it down to your home from my home
[47:41] to your home but we know that the
[47:44] satellite is only a type of what God
[47:46] already had a long time ago because God
[47:48] is these satellites that can download
[47:53] the revelation to any home personally he
[47:57] would like to I've been very very happy
[48:00] to be with you today
[48:01] brother all riously loves us more than I
[48:05] love you because he got up in the middle
[48:06] of the night spoke for us last last
[48:09] Sunday and for me it's Saturday in the
[48:12] afternoon so he's made a bigger
[48:14] sacrifice than I have but having said
[48:18] all of that I really appreciate your
[48:20] past you very much he's a genuine pastor
[48:22] he has a genuine pastor's heart and I
[48:27] certainly enjoyed the revelation in his
[48:30] life and learned much from him certainly
[48:33] to learn much from him I just want to
[48:35] say God bless the church this morning I
[48:39] have very fond memories very fond
[48:43] memories of of the time that we spent
[48:46] with you over there very personal fond
[48:48] memories and I want to just say God
[48:53] bless you from our church and our
[48:55] fellowship over here it's a wonderfully
[48:59] wonderful to be part of the same family
[49:01] of God I'm in my church office today
[49:04] hope everything comes to clear my only
[49:08] problem I think I'm going to have is
[49:10] that I hope I don't go too long so that
[49:13] I end up wearing you all out here this
[49:16] morning but what we could do maybe I
[49:20] like to be able to take a thought this
[49:22] morning that the Lord has led me to and
[49:24] I hope I can express it correctly
[49:29] and be able to express it properly this
[49:34] morning the thing of it is it's not a
[49:37] matter of how much to get on to be able
[49:40] to preach that problem I have is to take
[49:42] pay off of the fork not to put hay back
[49:46] on the fork because sometimes I don't
[49:48] know where to leave all the material
[49:51] that God inspires you to I certainly
[49:55] enjoyed all this many school children
[49:58] oh well having part in that presentation
[50:01] and the special this morning it was very
[50:04] very good and it was very good to see
[50:06] the family of God still operating as a
[50:09] family
[50:11] I have many fond memories I remember
[50:13] going with brother John to that bull
[50:15] sail with his son that was a special
[50:18] time for me spending time in your
[50:21] different homes and present so I've got
[50:25] some very good fond fond memories so
[50:29] this morning here I'd like to take a
[50:32] thought on the invisible union of the
[50:34] heavenly groom and an earthly bride
[50:37] knowing that we're in a wonderful
[50:39] wonderful junction of time we're in a
[50:43] secret movement of God is moving his
[50:47] program along and we're at an
[50:48] intersection in his program and God has
[50:51] hid these things from the church world
[50:54] so to speak but reveal them to his
[50:57] sweetheart to his bride I just want to
[51:01] again say that I really appreciate your
[51:03] pastor his family all in the prime of
[51:06] youth with the prime of Revelation in
[51:09] their hearts moving from glory to glory
[51:12] we had a wonderful time with his
[51:14] daughter we just actually rode horseback
[51:16] this morning with my granddaughter's
[51:18] together with my granddaughter's I have
[51:20] evidence that your pastor is also a
[51:22] Methodist that he's like John Wesley he
[51:25] has spent some time on horseback so
[51:27] we've got evidence of that that he's
[51:30] also part of the sanctification ministry
[51:34] there's a picture of his beautiful
[51:36] daughter that we had this wonderful time
[51:38] with but we've also got
[51:40] some other young people that spent time
[51:42] with us from your church they there
[51:44] they're still young at heart and they're
[51:46] certainly looking for adventure and
[51:48] they've got you got many many wonderful
[51:52] wonderful memories together with them
[51:56] also a motorbike yet but that could
[51:59] happen who knows so we've talked about
[52:02] young and hard to there they're probably
[52:04] going to end up back over here to get
[52:06] even with me after all these pictures
[52:08] but we'll certainly enjoy them back over
[52:11] here for sure this is the best picture
[52:13] of all right over here this is our our
[52:17] sister deacon over here taken over the
[52:20] church she's gonna take over the whole
[52:22] church I'm so wonderful good to see you
[52:26] my brothers good to see you so we're
[52:30] gonna take a short thought if I Lord
[52:33] willing on on on this topic the
[52:36] invisible union of the heavenly groom
[52:38] and the earthly bride and I like to just
[52:42] take and remind us that God is
[52:46] privileged us as the husband and the
[52:50] wife will often have a secret language
[52:53] between them
[52:55] me and my wife we're sitting across the
[52:58] table from each others and there could
[53:00] be you know 10 15 people at the table
[53:04] but if my wife gives me a certain looker
[53:07] I give her a certain looker a certain
[53:09] nod both her and I know exactly what
[53:13] that means and we have developed a
[53:17] secret relationship between us
[53:20] secret language between us based on
[53:22] relationship and it's that relationship
[53:25] that actually holds the language and I
[53:29] like to talk about the same kind of an
[53:31] effect between Christ and the bride
[53:35] where the groom and the bride they
[53:39] developed a secret language between them
[53:41] based on a relationship and so uh for
[53:45] starters this morning I'd like to take
[53:48] your Bible that you would in turn to
[53:50] revelations chapter 8
[53:53] in your Bible revelations chapter 8 very
[53:57] familiar to all of us but certainly a
[54:00] key for the bride
[54:02] this morning and so I just want to again
[54:06] just take the thought this morning that
[54:11] God is doing something very very special
[54:15] for us and he and and in all of that
[54:20] he's hiding the things that he is
[54:24] revealing to the bride and that he's
[54:27] developed a protocol that the bride will
[54:29] catch it for the sisters for the young
[54:34] people today at don't wanna spit out I
[54:39] don't want this to be a intellect but I
[54:42] wanted to be a real practical thought
[54:44] this morning that we can see the bigger
[54:47] picture of what the the time we're
[54:50] living in
[54:51] I talked to spur the Steve Brussels this
[54:54] morning and it's very interesting all
[54:57] the brothers and sisters that I've
[54:58] talked to in the last couple of two
[55:01] three months over here with this virus
[55:02] thing with this plague that's been
[55:05] unleashed
[55:07] on our world and how that it has brought
[55:12] the whole world economy it's very
[55:18] interesting how that it to them escape
[55:25] the world is nervous
[55:28] the world is running around and feared
[55:32] trying to find answers bride wise the
[55:38] bride has no problem with being able to
[55:40] reconcile what is going on over here
[55:43] so I will just read from revelations
[55:46] chapter 8 verse 1 this this this morning
[55:50] for you revelations 8:1 and when he had
[55:54] opened the Seventh Seal There was
[55:56] silence in heaven about the space of 1/2
[55:59] an hour and I'd like to read a little
[56:02] bit further than that
[56:04] and I saw the seven angels which stood
[56:06] before God and to them was given seven
[56:09] trumpets so in verse three and another
[56:14] angel this would be the eighth angel
[56:18] means another angel came and stood at
[56:21] the altar having a golden censer so now
[56:25] we realized that this is a very special
[56:27] angel with the special office and he is
[56:31] in the holiest in the holy stock of in
[56:35] the tabernacle and the type and there
[56:38] was given unto Him much incense and we
[56:40] know that's at the incense also with the
[56:42] prayers of the Saints that he should
[56:44] offer it up with the prayers of all the
[56:46] saints upon the golden altar which is
[56:48] before the throne so he's at a
[56:52] particular spot and he's going to step
[56:56] into the holiest of Holies but before he
[56:58] gets in there he has to have he has to
[57:01] make the preparations for all these
[57:04] things and the smoke on the guttenberg
[57:14] and the smoke of the incense which came
[57:17] from the with the prayers of the Saints
[57:19] ascended up before God out of the Angels
[57:21] hand and the angel took the censer
[57:25] filled it with the fire off the altar
[57:29] and cast it to the earth and there was
[57:31] voices and thunders and lightnings and
[57:34] earthquakes so all I want you to
[57:39] understand this morning is that at the
[57:43] same time when the seventh seal opens it
[57:48] also causes a disruption of nature or an
[57:54] effect on the earth if I can use that
[57:57] term it causes at the same time a
[58:01] destructive effect on the earth now
[58:05] let's just take and while after we've
[58:07] read that let's just take and bow our
[58:09] heads and just ask God for I want to
[58:12] find that channel for us this morning
[58:14] that I believe that the Lord gave us
[58:16] first Heavenly Father we buy
[58:18] or hearts before you and I bow my heart
[58:21] before you and humility
[58:22] I pray you give me the supernatural
[58:25] guidance through the Scriptures that the
[58:27] Scriptures could become real and the
[58:29] Scriptures could do the talking
[58:31] I pray for the audience that hears that
[58:35] we could be tuned into the heavenly
[58:37] Channel and to leave this earthly realm
[58:40] to catch your thoughts
[58:42] I bring you download your thoughts into
[58:45] our hearts this morning I pray in your
[58:48] word to give us eternal life in your
[58:50] name we pray amen amen
[58:53] well god bless you this morning I'd like
[58:57] to start off this morning and I'm going
[59:01] to spend a little bit of time and trying
[59:03] to lay a good foundation so that when we
[59:06] move into the scriptures that we all
[59:09] catch the same thing so we have a good
[59:12] foundation this morning I'm gonna Rita a
[59:14] bunch of quotes at first but my thought
[59:18] this morning is that seven seal secret
[59:20] the secret communication between the
[59:23] husband and the wife the seventh seal
[59:27] secret communication between the husband
[59:31] and the wife so we'll read first of all
[59:35] some close I'd like to read this morning
[59:38] and this I found this astounding the
[59:42] other day when I was telling the church
[59:44] this now God cannot make anybody believe
[59:47] and board that struck me this morning
[59:50] God can't make anybody believe he so
[59:54] respects your free moral agency even if
[59:58] he knows you're gone and fighting your
[1:00:02] way to hell which we know that the
[1:00:05] believers they have to fight their way
[1:00:06] to hell go against everything god is
[1:00:09] that that even if he sees you going the
[1:00:13] wrong direction you're fighting your way
[1:00:15] to hell that God can't make anybody
[1:00:18] believe and I thought my that's
[1:00:19] astounding and then the next line is
[1:00:22] even more astounding God can only reveal
[1:00:25] himself in different forms
[1:00:28] so it's amazing God can't make us
[1:00:30] believe and the only thing God can do is
[1:00:33] reveal himself and he reveals himself
[1:00:37] many many many different ways let's just
[1:00:40] read a little bit more he can only
[1:00:43] reveal himself four different forms he
[1:00:46] has revealed himself in the wind in the
[1:00:49] mysterious movements and so forth in the
[1:00:53] form of angels he has revealed himself
[1:00:56] in his revealed himself in man by
[1:00:59] preaching the gospel he's revealed
[1:01:01] himself in times of trouble to the
[1:01:05] people revealing himself in times of
[1:01:07] trouble and sometimes he has to take a
[1:01:10] loved one sometimes to bring the heart
[1:01:14] of the person to the acknowledgment of
[1:01:16] God I find it amazing because when I
[1:01:21] think of my children for instance I
[1:01:25] can't make my children believe believe
[1:01:33] that I'm their dad but the best I can do
[1:01:37] is reveal myself in the fact that I am
[1:01:40] their dad and you know revelation is an
[1:01:43] amazing thing revelation is not
[1:01:45] information revelation is also not an
[1:01:49] explanation revelation is much much
[1:01:53] deeper than that
[1:01:55] we know revelation is faith there's
[1:01:59] different descriptions of revelation but
[1:02:03] a revelation lots of times will come to
[1:02:05] you when you're not studying when you're
[1:02:07] relaxed when nothing when you're not
[1:02:09] under pressure then God will reveal
[1:02:12] himself to you revelation is very
[1:02:14] interesting how it comes to you even in
[1:02:19] droves case old was looking for the
[1:02:23] evidence of the resurrection and yet
[1:02:25] every year the flower would would rise
[1:02:28] in spring would give its glory to the
[1:02:31] earth would die and fall and then next
[1:02:35] spring the flower would come up again so
[1:02:37] the flower was preaching a resurrection
[1:02:40] message to Joe
[1:02:42] but job didn't have the key to unlock
[1:02:44] the encrypted message that the flower
[1:02:47] was trying to preach to job so the job
[1:02:50] couldn't get the message of the flower
[1:02:52] though the flower was preaching to him
[1:02:54] every single year
[1:02:56] Mary often you know God reveals himself
[1:02:59] in our family lights
[1:03:01] for instance when our children are
[1:03:05] coming into the world as a baby they
[1:03:08] come in under complete innocence they
[1:03:10] have no fear they're one with the world
[1:03:12] as far as they're concerned the world
[1:03:14] loves them they have no boundaries of
[1:03:18] fear and separation but then the
[1:03:20] children go from age two to age 12 and
[1:03:24] then they'd be cool through the Ox age
[1:03:26] and they learn to have mom and Ella
[1:03:29] dad's identity because they don't have
[1:03:32] none of their own under the Ox age then
[1:03:35] the children go to the manage from
[1:03:37] puberty to the time of twenty-one years
[1:03:39] old or eighteen maybe and then they
[1:03:42] learn in the manage their own identity
[1:03:45] they learn how they feel themselves not
[1:03:46] what mom and dad are but what they are
[1:03:49] there for you also find after that they
[1:03:55] see when they buying that predestinated
[1:03:58] mate that God has for them then they
[1:04:02] they step into the Eagle age they set
[1:04:05] step into a secret union between husband
[1:04:09] and wife and then they become creators
[1:04:11] they first were a creation but now when
[1:04:16] they meet their mate they become a
[1:04:18] creator and now they create children now
[1:04:21] they're responsible for those children's
[1:04:23] redemption so in all of those things
[1:04:26] God's preaching his mystery for us I
[1:04:29] like to Rita
[1:04:30] another call here if we could and it's
[1:04:33] interesting now that we know that all
[1:04:36] that God can do is reveal himself now we
[1:04:40] find ourselves in the first purpose of
[1:04:43] that seventh seal because remember the
[1:04:45] first purpose was to reveal himself and
[1:04:48] the more that Christ reveals himself
[1:04:51] through the many different forms
[1:04:55] in the healing lines brother branham
[1:04:57] would stand sit on stage brother branham
[1:05:01] would sit on stage and then he would and
[1:05:04] then he would say you know what I'm
[1:05:06] waiting for
[1:05:08] I'm waiting for him to come if he'll
[1:05:10] come if he'll come then then we can
[1:05:15] continue with the healing so God was
[1:05:17] revealing himself God was revealing
[1:05:20] himself
[1:05:23] yeah unplug it yeah God was revealing
[1:05:25] himself on stage through healing that he
[1:05:29] was there he was actually there so all
[1:05:34] of that regard revealing himself we know
[1:05:38] what it would do is it would take and we
[1:05:41] would earn his preeminence because God
[1:05:43] revealed himself he earned his right and
[1:05:47] we wanted to give him preeminence
[1:05:49] because he revealed himself and we know
[1:05:52] that result of that would be to restore
[1:05:55] the kingdom so let's just go back a
[1:05:57] little bit do a little takeaway remember
[1:05:59] when God can make you a believer and
[1:06:02] number two all God can do is reveal
[1:06:05] himself
[1:06:07] you look at the Ministry of the Son of
[1:06:09] Man ministry in our day it's amazing
[1:06:12] that the more I fed on the Word of God
[1:06:16] in in in the prophets ministry the son
[1:06:20] of man in the prophets ministry the more
[1:06:23] I wanted to give him preeminence he
[1:06:26] definitely earned my respect will read a
[1:06:29] little bit more because there's a whole
[1:06:32] mystery involved that Paul was aware of
[1:06:37] that he knew that he had to keep secret
[1:06:41] and that he knew was going to be made
[1:06:44] fully revealed in the end time because
[1:06:47] remember Paul's ministry was the
[1:06:50] prophecy of the fulfillment of the
[1:06:54] seventh angels ministry so Paul's
[1:06:57] ministry mirrored the seventh angels
[1:07:01] ministry and Paul knew that he had to
[1:07:04] keep the secret way back 2,000 years ago
[1:07:07] he had to put it in mystery form so Paul
[1:07:10] said things like this now to him that is
[1:07:14] of power to establish you according to
[1:07:17] my gospel think of how many preachers
[1:07:20] they were preaching in Paul's day but he
[1:07:22] knew that he had the only one that could
[1:07:26] establish the bride according to his
[1:07:28] gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:07:31] according to the revelation of the
[1:07:35] mystery which was kept secret since the
[1:07:38] world began so think Paul knew this
[1:07:43] secret before the foundations of the
[1:07:45] world and he was the only one that knew
[1:07:47] that secret let's read a little bit more
[1:07:51] and I want to make a point here so we
[1:07:53] understand the angel the effect of the
[1:07:57] angel in our
[1:08:01] instead of via some of the
[1:08:07] uhh
[1:08:08] uh facing in enough or day to see once
[1:08:13] we see Paul's ministry then we will also
[1:08:17] see then we will also see the Angels
[1:08:24] ministry and our day also just a minute
[1:08:28] over here
[1:08:31] you
[1:08:36] so Paul knew this secret that was kept
[1:08:41] before the foundations of the world and
[1:08:43] he'll say things like he'll be amazing
[1:08:47] with some of the things that he will say
[1:08:50] so he said this he said Ephesians 3:9 to
[1:08:56] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[1:08:59] of the mystery so I want to stop there
[1:09:01] this is good this where it gets good you
[1:09:04] mean to tell me this mystery wants
[1:09:06] fellowship that's exactly what I'm
[1:09:08] saying
[1:09:08] it's wonderful this secret that Paul
[1:09:14] knew was from before the foundation of
[1:09:16] the world that secret mystery wants
[1:09:20] fellowship to make all men see what is
[1:09:23] the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:09:25] Ephesians 39 which from the beginning of
[1:09:28] the world hath been hid in God which had
[1:09:32] been hid in God who created all things
[1:09:34] by Jesus Christ to the intent that now
[1:09:38] unto the principalities and the powers
[1:09:40] and heavenly places remember in heavenly
[1:09:43] places he might be made known by the
[1:09:47] church to the manifold wisdom of God and
[1:09:50] I don't want that to sound complicated I
[1:09:52] just want you to realize that Paul he
[1:09:56] recognized that that mystery from before
[1:09:59] the foundation of the world that mystery
[1:10:01] wanted fellowship and and is looking for
[1:10:05] somebody to have fellowship with so
[1:10:08] again just thinking along the lines of
[1:10:11] Paul hiding the secret which was going
[1:10:14] to be revealed in our day in mark 4:11
[1:10:17] the Bible says and he said unto them
[1:10:20] unto you it is given to know the
[1:10:21] mysteries of the kingdom of God but unto
[1:10:24] them that or all these things are done
[1:10:26] in parables ah I find that fascinating
[1:10:31] for myself personally I was raised in a
[1:10:36] minute night home with none of God in it
[1:10:38] at all
[1:10:39] we were raised as worldly as can be we
[1:10:43] were raised without God as can be ah but
[1:10:48] I
[1:10:49] like I say this to you it is given to
[1:10:52] know the mystery you didn't earn it you
[1:10:55] didn't get it cuz you're in a good
[1:10:57] bloodline you didn't get it because you
[1:11:01] were a good person you didn't get it
[1:11:04] because you you you did anything to
[1:11:08] attract God's attention God looked in
[1:11:13] the Lamb's Book he saw your name he
[1:11:17] chose you and he decided that I'm gonna
[1:11:20] let you know the mystery that was secret
[1:11:23] before the foundation of the world this
[1:11:25] whole thing is God
[1:11:28] 100% choosing you picking you up picking
[1:11:34] you up and showing you his secrets from
[1:11:39] before the foundations of the world
[1:11:41] that's 100% what this thing is and so to
[1:11:46] you it is given to know the mysteries of
[1:11:49] the kingdom but what to the rest of the
[1:11:52] world
[1:11:53] he speaks in parables
[1:11:57] Wow
[1:11:59] to the rest of the world the Bible is
[1:12:03] Bible story Sunday school stories a book
[1:12:06] of morals but to the bride now we
[1:12:11] understand that this Bible is actually
[1:12:16] the book that Adam lost
[1:12:20] this Bible actually is the lamb's book
[1:12:23] section
[1:12:25] in the book of life and God has revealed
[1:12:29] that to us
[1:12:32] to show us that he treats that we are
[1:12:37] his bride and we have secret
[1:12:40] communication between husband and wife
[1:12:44] let's just read a little bit more here
[1:12:47] this morning if we can brother Branham
[1:12:53] says some amazing amazing amazing things
[1:12:56] in trying to show us that we are special
[1:13:01] in God's economy revelation is the
[1:13:05] previously hidden truth but now it's
[1:13:07] divinely revealed and I'm going to go to
[1:13:11] us because this is all building a
[1:13:13] foundation to try to get us to
[1:13:16] understand that there's a secret
[1:13:19] communication the seventh seal is
[1:13:21] encrypted and the reason we encrypt
[1:13:24] something is to keep out unauthorized
[1:13:28] access now think of it we have email
[1:13:31] these days that we there's encrypted
[1:13:34] email and the purpose of it it is so
[1:13:37] that unauthorized access can't get
[1:13:40] access to the email and that's what the
[1:13:42] seventh seal is God encrypted the
[1:13:45] seventh seal and we know that the the
[1:13:48] Bible now here's the difference the
[1:13:50] Bible is not just a record a book of
[1:13:54] Revelation it actually is the revelation
[1:13:58] it is the book that Adam lost when he
[1:14:02] fell on the garden and that Bible
[1:14:05] that has our name in it because remember
[1:14:07] I'll get to this later that this Bible
[1:14:10] isn't just a story about God or about
[1:14:14] revelation this Bible itself is the book
[1:14:17] that Adam lost the mystery of Christ in
[1:14:21] the book itself even the way is
[1:14:24] constructed is a mystery and we know
[1:14:28] that when Adam lost a book which we hold
[1:14:30] in our hands not just the physical ink
[1:14:32] on paper whether we're talking about the
[1:14:35] book of life that Adam lost it held
[1:14:38] three things number one it held the
[1:14:42] correct relationship with God number two
[1:14:45] it held the dominion over all of nature
[1:14:50] and number three it held eternal life
[1:14:54] itself so we find out that this Bible is
[1:14:57] a special special book written in a
[1:15:02] certain way for a certain people and and
[1:15:07] we find out that this Bible also
[1:15:10] contains the revelation that there's a
[1:15:12] supernatural communication of truth to
[1:15:15] the soul the Bible itself communicates
[1:15:19] truth and not just ink on paper because
[1:15:21] president says remember the secret of
[1:15:23] God is written between the lines not on
[1:15:26] the lines between the lines it's secret
[1:15:28] communication and we know that
[1:15:30] revelation is faith and the Bible is
[1:15:33] God's thoughts laying in seed form that
[1:15:36] will be received by the bride the Bible
[1:15:38] is not just the Word of God but it's
[1:15:42] actually the thoughts of God because
[1:15:45] remember thoughts first
[1:15:49] we were God's thought first then became
[1:15:54] word so the Bible isn't just God's Word
[1:16:00] the Bible is a transfer of God's
[1:16:02] thoughts and that has been held secret
[1:16:06] and it's represented those thoughts are
[1:16:09] representativeness garment in the red
[1:16:11] that that Rahab had the seventh seal is
[1:16:15] written between the lines and it's like
[1:16:18] a jigsaw puzzle you know when you do a
[1:16:20] jigsaw puzzle you can put a couple of
[1:16:22] five seven pieces together my wife loves
[1:16:24] puzzling you got a puzzle table at the
[1:16:26] end of our table
[1:16:27] the sisters come over to our house and
[1:16:29] all of a sudden half of them they don't
[1:16:32] even go for coffee they sit down to the
[1:16:34] jigsaw puzzle table I'm there pretty
[1:16:36] soon they got all their hands on that
[1:16:38] puzzle down there and they're all
[1:16:39] talking like crazy as this picture
[1:16:42] becomes into formation I remember when
[1:16:46] did you take a jigsaw puzzle what do you
[1:16:48] do you do the outside first because that
[1:16:50] has the lines you can recognize most the
[1:16:53] time you do the sky first because that's
[1:16:55] all blue you put all the black pieces in
[1:16:57] one spot and all the Reds in another
[1:16:59] spot now you can put four or five pieces
[1:17:02] of the jigsaw puzzle together and you
[1:17:04] say wow look at that I've got these four
[1:17:07] pieces together but you know what that
[1:17:09] still doesn't form the whole picture the
[1:17:11] Seventh Seal is actually the picture
[1:17:15] that the jigsaw puzzle becomes when you
[1:17:17] put the pieces together right and those
[1:17:21] pieces you can't you know like but I get
[1:17:25] it too a jigsaw puzzle I'll put pressure
[1:17:27] on it because I make these two pieces
[1:17:28] come together that's the way I see some
[1:17:31] preachers they take two scriptures and
[1:17:32] they make them come together but it
[1:17:34] doesn't reflect the picture of Jesus
[1:17:36] Christ under that seventh seal when
[1:17:38] they're done so just thinking of that
[1:17:41] thought I want to bring you another
[1:17:43] thought and again I don't want to sound
[1:17:46] intellectual that's not my purpose today
[1:17:49] but but we we know that the Bible is
[1:17:53] formulated in a certain way and that
[1:17:56] Bible
[1:17:58] we've had six church ages and then
[1:18:00] there's a gap if you read your Bibles
[1:18:03] there's an open door between the 6th and
[1:18:05] 7th church age and the same thing with
[1:18:08] the seals there's six seals and there's
[1:18:10] a gap between the 6th and the 7th church
[1:18:14] seal the same thing with the trumpets if
[1:18:17] you take your Bibles there are 6
[1:18:18] trumpets in a row then there's a gap or
[1:18:21] an interval between the 6th and 7th
[1:18:24] trumpet and the same thing happens in
[1:18:26] the vials if you go from your Bibles you
[1:18:28] find there's two major events between
[1:18:31] the sixth and seventh vial in your
[1:18:34] Bibles and it's done this way for a
[1:18:35] reason
[1:18:36] I want you to just notice this is done
[1:18:38] for a reason because president says the
[1:18:41] mystery is in the interval you don't
[1:18:43] find brother but I'm talking about the
[1:18:44] interval said after the seals are open
[1:18:46] and again I don't want to sound
[1:18:48] complicated but I just want you to see a
[1:18:50] pattern over over here that there's an
[1:18:53] interval between the 6th and the 7th in
[1:18:56] all cases and the mystery of all of
[1:18:59] these things the secrets that they hold
[1:19:02] is wrapped up and centered 7th under
[1:19:04] voices in Revelations 10 4 so the
[1:19:07] seventh under voices in Revelations 10 4
[1:19:10] reveals all of these things and it's a
[1:19:13] secret communication and the bride will
[1:19:17] catch it why these things are the way
[1:19:20] that they are it's a wonderful lesson of
[1:19:23] the revealing of the secret to the bride
[1:19:29] like to just read a couple of more
[1:19:31] quotes I'm I'm finding myself a little
[1:19:33] bit long here already but to understand
[1:19:36] that Paul he had the secret to the
[1:19:39] mystery that the seventh angel was going
[1:19:44] to be able to reveal because remember
[1:19:46] through 2000 years those secrets were
[1:19:50] going to be kept away or hidden for
[1:19:53] 2,000 years have to happen in our day to
[1:19:58] reveal what Paul knew and the mystery
[1:20:02] that Paul had I want to stop just a
[1:20:05] little bit I have four years I want to
[1:20:08] make a confession here to you today for
[1:20:11] years when I came to this message
[1:20:13] I was marvel
[1:20:15] ah by the Son of man ministry but I
[1:20:20] didn't know the son of man ministry I
[1:20:22] just knew God sent a prophet and I loved
[1:20:25] listening to the tapes
[1:20:28] and for years I preached the quotes but
[1:20:31] the truth of it is for years I couldn't
[1:20:33] make the picture come together I want to
[1:20:36] confess to you today that for years
[1:20:39] there's quotes that the prophet spent
[1:20:42] time on that I stayed away from it
[1:20:45] didn't make sense to me and then to make
[1:20:48] it worse one of the things that happened
[1:20:51] is there have been some ministry that
[1:20:53] came along and they actually distorted
[1:20:57] the truth in some of those quotes and
[1:20:59] that kind of made me gun-shy I stayed
[1:21:01] away from many of those things but as
[1:21:05] time went on I realized I was missing a
[1:21:07] key to unlock so many beautiful secrets
[1:21:11] in the scriptures
[1:21:13] and I had it stop back pull myself out
[1:21:17] and just take another look at this and
[1:21:20] what I realized and let me just speak to
[1:21:23] you personally a little bit one of the
[1:21:26] things that helped me spiritually junk
[1:21:30] or forced me out of my comfort zone or
[1:21:33] push me to another level
[1:21:37] was a couple of seven eight years ago I
[1:21:39] wonder why it is that the scoffers we
[1:21:42] knew that scoffers had to come no
[1:21:45] problem but I was wondering why did the
[1:21:49] scoffers attack the cloud the first
[1:21:51] thing that made no sense to me they
[1:21:55] weren't there they didn't even know
[1:21:57] anybody personally that was there
[1:22:01] and yet it was interesting to me how the
[1:22:04] scoffers in the gainsayers and the
[1:22:08] Korra's and the Balaam's rolls up inside
[1:22:14] the message and the first thing they did
[1:22:16] attack something that had been proven
[1:22:18] scientifically proven by camera proven
[1:22:25] and they would attack something like
[1:22:28] that and what that did is that told me
[1:22:30] there's something about that that the
[1:22:33] devil hates that I think I'm missing
[1:22:36] after a while it was interesting to me
[1:22:39] how that after a while when they
[1:22:43] attacked the cloud and yet Jesus said in
[1:22:47] acts 1 he said the way you see me go up
[1:22:52] is the way you're going to see me come
[1:22:56] down
[1:22:58] and I was wondering my goodness that
[1:23:01] means if they had been there if they had
[1:23:04] been standing there in acts 1 and see
[1:23:09] Jesus go up in a cloud
[1:23:12] they'd have probably been some of the
[1:23:16] 380 remember there is 500 saw him go up
[1:23:20] but when it was done
[1:23:22] there's only 120 that obeyed the voice
[1:23:26] the instructions and went to the upper
[1:23:29] room that means there was 380 they saw
[1:23:33] the cloud and they turned her onto
[1:23:35] walked away and they said ah that's
[1:23:36] nothing
[1:23:38] and it's interesting to me how that now
[1:23:42] when Christ fulfilled exactly what he
[1:23:46] said he would do
[1:23:48] he made himself known in that cloud
[1:23:54] proving
[1:23:57] ancient of days was coming to the Son of
[1:23:59] man the junction between the son of man
[1:24:02] of the Ancient of Days
[1:24:04] the junction between Daniel 7 and
[1:24:07] revelations 114
[1:24:10] and we're living in that Junction and
[1:24:12] don't recognize and appreciate the
[1:24:17] effect
[1:24:20] ancient of me in the Ancient of Days
[1:24:22] coming to the Son of man in our day
[1:24:25] how blind we are to think that we're
[1:24:29] looking for something in the future and
[1:24:31] don't realize it's already happened in
[1:24:34] the past
[1:24:37] say this my precious friends
[1:24:39] I had a person come to me a while ago
[1:24:42] and say oh look at this world a sort of
[1:24:45] control I can hardly wait till Jesus
[1:24:49] comes something inside of me just stood
[1:24:53] up and said not me
[1:24:58] I can hardly wait till he leaves
[1:25:01] because he's here already under the
[1:25:04] sixth seal under the tribulation seal
[1:25:07] under the interruption of nature think
[1:25:11] of it the interruption of political
[1:25:14] systems the interruption of finance the
[1:25:19] interruption of nature the sixth seal he
[1:25:24] is here under the sixth seal proving
[1:25:29] he's here revealing himself in the word
[1:25:35] giving us the third pull evidence that
[1:25:38] he's here and people are saying oh I can
[1:25:41] hardly wait till he comes
[1:25:44] I say to you brothers I can hardly wait
[1:25:47] till he leaves
[1:25:48] because once he leaves I'm going with
[1:25:51] him
[1:25:52] because remember he comes three times
[1:25:55] the first time to redeem his bride the
[1:25:59] next time to get his bride
[1:26:03] and the third time we're coming back
[1:26:05] with him with the bride
[1:26:08] think of that we're in the second full
[1:26:10] part of his people coming and I'm not
[1:26:14] waiting for him to come I'm waiting for
[1:26:16] him to leave
[1:26:18] because he's already come and that's why
[1:26:22] they hate that cloud cuz the cloud is
[1:26:26] the evidence that he is here doing
[1:26:31] exactly what he said he was going to do
[1:26:34] praise the Lord
[1:26:36] the bride is the only one that knows the
[1:26:40] secret coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:44] in this coming he comes calling your
[1:26:49] name personally
[1:26:53] he's not coming calling the church name
[1:26:56] everybody in that church he's not
[1:27:00] calling coming calling a group
[1:27:04] he's coming calling your name personally
[1:27:08] watch the secret what's the secret of
[1:27:11] the seven sealed and drawn seven and
[1:27:13] eight
[1:27:15] remember when Jesus came
[1:27:21] to Mary and Martha and Lazarus his
[1:27:26] friends that had already been nurturing
[1:27:30] the message
[1:27:32] under the criticism of the scribes and
[1:27:36] Pharisees
[1:27:38] under the judgment I of the religious
[1:27:40] world
[1:27:42] they've been nurturing the message made
[1:27:46] flesh the Christ made flesh
[1:27:50] remember when Lazarus died
[1:27:55] that Jesus he waited till the fourth day
[1:27:59] haha remember the fourth stage is the
[1:28:04] resurrection stage
[1:28:06] remember Ezekiel 36 what's the first
[1:28:11] stage prophesized son of man can these
[1:28:15] bones live so it starts off with a
[1:28:19] resurrection prophecy then what happens
[1:28:24] then the bone comes to bone stage 1 the
[1:28:31] sinews come to sin use stage 2
[1:28:36] the skin comes stage 3 but yet there's
[1:28:41] no life
[1:28:42] all you have is uh
[1:28:45] created being but no life
[1:28:49] but the fourth stage says come win
[1:28:54] give life thou shall prophesy again the
[1:28:59] second time remember the fourth state is
[1:29:02] the resurrection stage prophesy again
[1:29:06] and it stood up to be a mighty great
[1:29:09] army
[1:29:12] and it starts off with prophecy
[1:29:15] can your family live
[1:29:19] your family may be dead in sin and
[1:29:21] trespasses
[1:29:23] but it starts off with somebody
[1:29:25] prophesying can your family live yes
[1:29:29] Lord thou knowest well then the Lord
[1:29:32] said will you prophesy you speak to the
[1:29:36] bones you speak to the sinew you speak
[1:29:41] to the skin you prophesy again and call
[1:29:46] for life a pastor might be looking at
[1:29:50] his church his church might be
[1:29:53] spiritually dead living in the first six
[1:29:55] seals and not in the seventh seal
[1:29:59] and the body is there to sing you is
[1:30:02] there the bones are there the skin is
[1:30:04] there but there's still no 7c a life in
[1:30:07] the church and then God will look at the
[1:30:09] pastor and he'll say prophesy and then
[1:30:14] the pastor speaks the seventh seal and
[1:30:17] the seventh seal gives the life to the
[1:30:20] church it's the fourth stage and here
[1:30:25] Jesus in the seventh seal type so that
[1:30:28] we catch this catch this he waits till
[1:30:32] the fourth day till the Eagle stage lion
[1:30:37] Hawks mani go wait till that body is
[1:30:40] good and dead the debtor the greater the
[1:30:44] miracle
[1:30:46] but it takes somebody to speak speak the
[1:30:49] words speak to seventh seal Christ is
[1:30:52] here breathe life into that body and
[1:30:56] remember how happens in the first
[1:30:58] remember to look at the secret of the
[1:31:01] resurrection look at the seventh seal in
[1:31:03] that chapter and Jesus goes to the tomb
[1:31:07] and he says Lazarus come forth you know
[1:31:13] why he called Lazarus name
[1:31:17] because if he hadn't a said Lazarus come
[1:31:21] forth it would have caused the whole Old
[1:31:26] Testament Saints to come out of the
[1:31:28] grave
[1:31:29] that would have been the general
[1:31:30] resurrection
[1:31:33] but remember this resurrection that
[1:31:37] we're in right now is a secret
[1:31:40] resurrection a name called resurrection
[1:31:46] when God calls your name personally to
[1:31:50] the resurrection
[1:31:52] the general resurrection will come at
[1:31:55] the end of the millennium when all the
[1:31:57] sea will give up the dead and the earth
[1:32:00] will give up the dead and every soldier
[1:32:03] that died on a burning ship through all
[1:32:06] the wars and all the men that died in
[1:32:09] the civil wars from the beginning from
[1:32:13] Jesus Christ day through the two
[1:32:15] thousand those will all rise in the
[1:32:18] general resurrection to the white throne
[1:32:21] judgement but remember before that
[1:32:23] resurrection there is a secret
[1:32:26] resurrection to the elect and Jesus went
[1:32:30] to Lazarus's tomb and he said Lazarus
[1:32:35] come forth and Lazarus heard his name in
[1:32:40] the secret resurrection and he came
[1:32:43] forth and when he came forth Jesus told
[1:32:49] the servants lose him
[1:32:54] in other words take off all those dead
[1:32:57] clothes and loose him
[1:33:02] in the secret resurrection
[1:33:06] and look I'll read it to you that I'm
[1:33:09] getting ahead of myself but I'll read it
[1:33:11] to you brother Brendan they asked
[1:33:13] brother Branham a question brother
[1:33:14] branham how's the bride gunas bride
[1:33:17] going to get a new name and brother bum
[1:33:20] says yeah but he's going to call you
[1:33:22] first
[1:33:22] he says the bride the God doesn't call
[1:33:25] ormond level Li veil william branham
[1:33:30] called you by your earthly name how does
[1:33:35] God call you
[1:33:37] he calls you by revealing a mystery
[1:33:42] opening a secret and when you catch that
[1:33:46] secret that is the calling of your name
[1:33:49] showing that you're eligible for the
[1:33:53] private resurrection praise the Lord
[1:33:57] God's calling your name personally how
[1:34:02] is he doing that by showing you a secret
[1:34:06] inside the scriptures to you it is given
[1:34:11] to know the mysteries of God what a
[1:34:15] resurrection that was 2,000 years ago
[1:34:20] brother Branham said in the rising of
[1:34:21] the Sun but then he said what a
[1:34:25] resurrection this
[1:34:28] causing life to come again now let me
[1:34:35] just get back to this to this secret
[1:34:40] that Paul held brother Branham says this
[1:34:43] this is the contest now and remember
[1:34:46] this is 6212 showing that how he's
[1:34:50] stepping into another segment of his
[1:34:53] ministry that the bride will catch and
[1:34:55] understand
[1:34:55] help us Lord forgive us I pray thee
[1:34:59] raise up mighty raise up mighty warriors
[1:35:01] of the faith open this year Lord the
[1:35:05] hidden manna
[1:35:07] now let me stop they remember who open
[1:35:09] the hidden manna
[1:35:11] remember there was public mana that felt
[1:35:15] publicly for the children of Israel but
[1:35:19] then there was hidden manna private
[1:35:22] manna that was in the ark reserved for
[1:35:28] priests alone not so now brother Branham
[1:35:34] is saying Lord that hidden manna that
[1:35:36] rock beneath the rock that revelation
[1:35:40] underneath the revelation that we could
[1:35:43] see the program of God what's the result
[1:35:45] of eating the hidden manna what's the
[1:35:49] result of the rock beneath the rock and
[1:35:51] that is that we can see the program of
[1:35:54] God the whole program from Genesis 1 to
[1:35:59] revelations 22 only for the elect sake
[1:36:04] cap off the pyramids of our lives of our
[1:36:09] life Lord put on the capstone Jesus
[1:36:12] Christ upon every and each and every one
[1:36:15] of us
[1:36:18] we find out that we also see here that
[1:36:22] in the seventh seal again I don't want
[1:36:25] to sound intellectual is not about being
[1:36:28] intellectual I just want this to be
[1:36:31] plain and easy to be understood
[1:36:34] I remember let me read this first there
[1:36:39] are city things that goes with it
[1:36:41] one unfolded yesterday the one unfolded
[1:36:45] today and the other one yesterday and
[1:36:47] today and there's one thing that
[1:36:49] couldn't interpret because it was an
[1:36:51] unknown language but I stood right there
[1:36:54] and I looked straight at it this is the
[1:36:57] third pull coming up and then he says
[1:37:00] that's the reason that heaven was silent
[1:37:04] that's the reason that heaven was silent
[1:37:08] one place he said why was heaven silent
[1:37:10] because God left heaven everything
[1:37:14] stopped and God came down to this earth
[1:37:18] in 63 and the form of that cloud and now
[1:37:22] he is here rearranging the whole
[1:37:27] environmental political financial world
[1:37:33] and he's also uniting that's the secret
[1:37:40] coming that the bride knows the world
[1:37:43] knows the church world knows nothing
[1:37:45] about this
[1:37:46] and then remember he said that's I
[1:37:49] better stop right there
[1:37:50] I just feel checked not to say anything
[1:37:54] right there
[1:37:56] and there's a reason for that I find
[1:38:02] myself that it is the more time goes on
[1:38:06] the more I'm becoming aware of what the
[1:38:11] prophets thoughts were and how that he
[1:38:15] could articulate those thoughts now
[1:38:18] think of it God sent us a prophet
[1:38:24] he had to send and speak both to the
[1:38:27] false vine and the true vine
[1:38:31] remember the false line they got the
[1:38:35] first and second pull they got the
[1:38:37] healing and they got the discernment
[1:38:42] but the bride got more than that Street
[1:38:47] God
[1:38:50] and of the heeling remember this when
[1:38:56] the Eliezer came to get Rebekah
[1:39:00] eleazar's family brothers they got the
[1:39:03] gifts
[1:39:06] but Isaac but Rebecca
[1:39:10] Isak think of what a predicament
[1:39:17] the Prophet was in he loved the people
[1:39:22] and he had displayed the first and
[1:39:26] second pole and he wanted them to get it
[1:39:31] he explained many many spiritual secrets
[1:39:37] trying to convince the people to give
[1:39:40] them a revelation but remember God can't
[1:39:42] make you a believer all can do all God
[1:39:44] can do is reveal himself and because the
[1:39:49] brother brands love for the people he
[1:39:51] tried to explain the spiritual status
[1:39:53] that he was in and every time he did
[1:39:56] that it caused the counterfeit
[1:39:59] all of a sudden you had preachers with
[1:40:00] blood out of their hands
[1:40:02] you had women with all kinds of suits
[1:40:06] saying things people running after and
[1:40:09] it had created such a counterfeit that
[1:40:13] it caused a huge confusion
[1:40:16] because of the counterfeit will now the
[1:40:22] cloud came and he knew who that was
[1:40:26] now remember when Ahab got to the throne
[1:40:33] in 1960 when JFK got to the throne
[1:40:36] remember now he realized he better open
[1:40:40] more of the word so he opened the church
[1:40:41] ages
[1:40:45] remember he also recognized that God was
[1:40:52] on the move and changing from
[1:40:57] intercessor to judge now let me let me
[1:41:01] stop my brushless brothers and sisters
[1:41:05] so often because of our rejection
[1:41:08] complex when we think the word judge we
[1:41:12] feel condemned and guilty the judges
[1:41:15] here
[1:41:17] but what we've got to realize is the
[1:41:21] judge is the one that can annul your
[1:41:24] sentence and that can say forgiven he's
[1:41:31] the one that can say destroy your past
[1:41:35] records he's the one that puts a gavel
[1:41:40] down and pronounces you're free
[1:41:45] so the term judge to the bride isn't
[1:41:49] something we're scared of actually the
[1:41:51] truth of it is we love the fact that the
[1:41:55] judge is here because he's the only one
[1:41:57] that can take and clean up our record
[1:42:01] he's the only one that can do that and
[1:42:05] remember that Christ through the church
[1:42:08] ages was an intercessor interceding for
[1:42:11] us but in our generation he's turned
[1:42:16] from intercessor to judge and that
[1:42:20] junction is a relief to the bride it's a
[1:42:24] good day that the judges hear it's a
[1:42:28] wonderful thing that we've got God
[1:42:31] now as judge proclaiming the bride
[1:42:36] sinless and spotless and giving the
[1:42:40] bride the the the confidence that she
[1:42:43] needs
[1:42:45] I want you to notice that
[1:42:50] brother varanasi and 19th recognized the
[1:42:58] junction in God's economy
[1:43:03] sixty he already recognizes there's many
[1:43:10] things changing real fast and in
[1:43:14] nineteen sixty in the Patmos vision he
[1:43:17] says this he's the judge now come to
[1:43:23] judge the nation's Oh for that day when
[1:43:28] you see him like like that like he is
[1:43:31] look at his hair his hair is white of
[1:43:34] snow Daniel saw him coming to the
[1:43:39] Ancient of Days watch those two blend
[1:43:42] together
[1:43:42] all right watch those two blend together
[1:43:47] then later on this is 1960 think of it a
[1:43:51] have just got to the throne think of it
[1:43:54] he just preached the church ages think
[1:43:59] of it he says now the Ancient of Days
[1:44:02] whose hair was white as will John turned
[1:44:06] and saw one like the Son of man coming
[1:44:08] in the midst of the seven candlesticks
[1:44:11] snow-white hair the judge not girdle
[1:44:15] around his waist but girdle around his
[1:44:17] paps or his shoulders up there a judge
[1:44:21] with the sash of the judge over his
[1:44:24] shoulders he stood with a golden pure
[1:44:28] holy refined girdle
[1:44:30] that held his righteousness his cover he
[1:44:36] was covered all the way down to his feet
[1:44:39] what's the seventh full manifestation of
[1:44:42] his person in glory
[1:44:43] think of it brothers and sisters that
[1:44:47] was in 1960
[1:44:49] think of it nobody
[1:44:54] but the seventh church age messenger
[1:44:57] recognized the junction between the
[1:45:00] intercessor and the judge and not only
[1:45:03] that gave the bride confidence and
[1:45:08] security that the judge is going to be
[1:45:14] part of our DNA we're family with the
[1:45:20] judge he was going to prove that our DNA
[1:45:29] and a and he came to pronounce his
[1:45:33] family perfect and pure and had
[1:45:37] everything that we need to be completely
[1:45:43] condemnation free
[1:45:46] only the son of man ministry in our day
[1:45:50] could give the bride back confidence
[1:45:55] but the rest of the world
[1:45:58] is gonna feel
[1:46:01] plagues that Moses brought remember the
[1:46:05] same Moses that brought the place is the
[1:46:09] same Moses that provided the blood on
[1:46:13] the door for the elect
[1:46:19] remember the same Elijah that caused the
[1:46:25] drought in first Kings 17
[1:46:29] is the same Elijah
[1:46:32] had the secret food for the woman
[1:46:38] in that drought that he had caused
[1:46:41] so remember
[1:46:44] the political disturbance the
[1:46:47] natural disturbance is the same one
[1:46:51] that's showing that the Redeemer has
[1:46:55] come to pick up the redemption the
[1:46:58] redeemed ones if we can go on just a
[1:47:02] little bit more and trying to get to
[1:47:04] something in the scriptures I'm not
[1:47:06] doing a very good job I'm trying to lay
[1:47:08] a good foundation to take away the fear
[1:47:10] because remember when when Jesus came to
[1:47:12] the boat which was under the sixth seal
[1:47:15] the first thing that Jesus said to the
[1:47:17] people though
[1:47:18] fear not
[1:47:20] and once they recognized who is in the
[1:47:23] boat
[1:47:25] under that tribulation
[1:47:29] and he spoke
[1:47:33] all things were at peace
[1:47:39] let's read a little bit more
[1:47:47] now we know that this seventh seal has
[1:47:50] been revealed in every type in every
[1:47:52] shadow and every story and you're well
[1:47:54] versed in these things and I'm going to
[1:47:55] go to some of those stories so we're
[1:47:58] going to go a little bit more watch this
[1:48:00] quote God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:48:03] secret it was kept a secret nobody
[1:48:06] should know anything about it even the
[1:48:08] Angels didn't understand it see he
[1:48:10] revealed didn't reveal it that's the
[1:48:13] reason under the seventh mystery when
[1:48:15] the seventh seal was open there was
[1:48:18] silence because remember if brother
[1:48:20] Brandon would have spoke it it would
[1:48:23] have created another perversion so
[1:48:27] that's why brother Brandon didn't speak
[1:48:29] the seventh seal so that the devil
[1:48:33] couldn't create another perversion or a
[1:48:36] counterfeit but yet he's given the bride
[1:48:39] the keys she knows needs
[1:48:41] what's this quote now all these things
[1:48:44] in there we find out sometimes like I
[1:48:46] come to Shreveport where we have just
[1:48:49] been about two or three weeks I'd like
[1:48:51] to take 30 minutes a night and just on
[1:48:53] teaching now I love this part see just
[1:48:57] stay right in the word these secret
[1:48:59] passages see where we could find out how
[1:49:03] just how find out just how to get in so
[1:49:08] there's secret passages in this Bible
[1:49:12] that are actually doorways for the bride
[1:49:16] to get in for secret communication we'll
[1:49:20] read a little bit more my subject this
[1:49:23] morning I trust that God will reveal it
[1:49:26] and each time if you take the tapes and
[1:49:28] listen I hope and trust that you that
[1:49:31] have a spiritual understanding of what
[1:49:33] God's trying to get over to the church
[1:49:35] without saying it right out so think of
[1:49:38] the predicaments that brother Brandon
[1:49:40] was in he had to get something over to
[1:49:44] us but he couldn't say it
[1:49:48] so he was trusting on private
[1:49:50] communications to catch the part that he
[1:49:54] wasn't allowed to speak and just going
[1:49:58] back to what I was referring to the
[1:50:01] calling of the names
[1:50:03] nothing will be saved only those whose
[1:50:05] names are in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:50:07] before the foundation of the world Jew
[1:50:08] or Gentile see that's all the book holds
[1:50:11] that mystery and the book is only
[1:50:15] unfolding if now remember Paul sealed a
[1:50:18] 2,000 years ago not each one's name but
[1:50:23] what the mystery of the book is Wallace
[1:50:25] calling those names see you finally
[1:50:28] understand now see the book doesn't say
[1:50:32] hey now lavell is to be saved in time of
[1:50:36] this church age or ormond Nevel or
[1:50:39] whatever no it doesn't say that it just
[1:50:42] shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of
[1:50:46] what the thing is
[1:50:49] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[1:50:52] that's what I said that the other night
[1:50:57] so these secrets passages are in the
[1:51:04] scripture that the world knows nothing
[1:51:07] about and yet to the bride they hold a
[1:51:10] secret to give her faith to take away
[1:51:14] fear so that she knows what stage of the
[1:51:19] program she's in if you can take your
[1:51:23] Bibles with me you're probably getting
[1:51:27] close to my time already but if I can
[1:51:31] take one story in the Bible just to sure
[1:51:35] follow that seventh seal secret that's
[1:51:38] been encrypted it's been hiding and
[1:51:41] laying in the Bible for thousands of
[1:51:44] years but it was only starting to come
[1:51:47] to light now with the son of man
[1:51:50] ministry you take your Bibles and if
[1:51:53] we'll go to Genesis we'll go to Genesis
[1:51:59] the 24th of 24th well look ya know let's
[1:52:07] go yeah let's go to Genesis 24 and I'm
[1:52:11] sure that these things are nothing new
[1:52:14] to you and and you've read all these
[1:52:17] things before and I'm sure brother
[1:52:19] always shown these things before but
[1:52:21] perhaps this morning for somebody just a
[1:52:24] focusing real tight on the seventh seal
[1:52:28] which is actually secret communication
[1:52:30] which is actually encrypted which is
[1:52:33] actually reserved for a certain time and
[1:52:38] and and to give the bride the faith that
[1:52:40] she needs
[1:52:41] remember the seventh seal is in every
[1:52:44] shadow every story every type if I can
[1:52:47] also just while we're going there I'd
[1:52:51] like to show you the seventh seal even
[1:52:52] in Genesis chapter one verse one
[1:52:56] I find it so interesting that the
[1:52:59] Prophet actually when Brisbane says we
[1:53:02] now for the first time are able to go
[1:53:04] back into God's mind and shows us what's
[1:53:08] in the back part of God's mind imagine
[1:53:13] the thoughts before they became word now
[1:53:18] remember the Seventh Seal always reveals
[1:53:23] itself under tribulation so I'm going to
[1:53:27] use the words the Seventh Seal reveals
[1:53:30] itself under the sixth seal because the
[1:53:32] sixth seal is the tribulation see
[1:53:36] six seal of political disturbance
[1:53:39] financial disturbance spiritual
[1:53:42] disturbance of environmental earthly
[1:53:45] disturbance under that tribulation seal
[1:53:48] God reveals himself now I don't want
[1:53:54] again I want to bring this down home now
[1:53:57] very often when you find somebody going
[1:54:02] through a hard time in life family's
[1:54:05] falling apart they're in the middle of
[1:54:08] the divorce they lost their job they're
[1:54:12] feeling the effects
[1:54:15] of the 200,000 thousand demons crossing
[1:54:19] the river euphrates they've got a child
[1:54:23] in their house that heads off to the
[1:54:27] world and a lion and a bear eats on that
[1:54:32] child and now they've got to be David to
[1:54:35] go rescue that lamb you find a church
[1:54:39] maybe under the sixth seal under
[1:54:43] spiritual tribulation under under under
[1:54:49] religious persecution you find a family
[1:54:54] maybe under economic and political
[1:54:59] persecution from the rest of the
[1:55:01] relatives you find tribulation or
[1:55:05] persons late I want you to understand
[1:55:08] that the seventh seal reveals itself
[1:55:11] under the sixth seal under that
[1:55:13] tribulation and we find that all through
[1:55:17] the Bible when Egypt was under the sixth
[1:55:21] seal
[1:55:23] that's when the Seventh Seal revealed
[1:55:26] itself
[1:55:29] and the profit
[1:55:33] told us that when Genesis 1:1 this world
[1:55:39] was without form or void when you take
[1:55:42] Genesis 1:1 this earth was without form
[1:55:45] or void and he told us that it had
[1:55:49] crashed it was under tribulation it was
[1:55:53] under your judgment under the judgement
[1:55:55] seal under the sixth seal the sixth seal
[1:55:58] is the judgment seal the earth was under
[1:56:02] the judgment sixth seal of judgment seal
[1:56:05] as he was without form and it was void
[1:56:09] remember in the next verse the Bible
[1:56:13] says and the spirit moved and God spoke
[1:56:18] said let there be light and created
[1:56:21] light in the midst of the judgement seal
[1:56:25] and that's what brought that earth back
[1:56:29] into order and the Seventh Seal doesn't
[1:56:31] quit till Genesis 2:25 something that
[1:56:36] was in chaos
[1:56:39] something that was deformed
[1:56:43] the Seventh Seal speaks the spirit moves
[1:56:49] it speaks it says let there be light and
[1:56:53] there was light
[1:56:56] and the light separates light from
[1:56:59] darkness that's the first stage of
[1:57:03] taking something that's in chaos many
[1:57:06] families are without form would their
[1:57:09] void they're in confusion they're under
[1:57:13] the judgment seal but inside of that
[1:57:16] sixth judgment seal God speaks I mean
[1:57:20] the spirit moves God speaks
[1:57:24] and he creates light and the Seventh
[1:57:28] Seal creates light and the Seventh Seal
[1:57:32] is the light that takes the chaos out of
[1:57:37] the first six seals
[1:57:40] so the Seventh Seal started right from
[1:57:43] Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 the whole
[1:57:47] Bible starts with the seventh seal
[1:57:50] bringing something out of chaos and
[1:57:53] judgment with a form and void and the
[1:57:58] spirit moves and speaks and says let
[1:58:01] there be light and there was like the
[1:58:03] whole Bible starts with the seventh seal
[1:58:08] it's the secret
[1:58:11] that the son of man ministry gave to the
[1:58:14] bride so that we understand everything
[1:58:17] starts with the seventh seal and
[1:58:19] everything ends with the seventh seal
[1:58:21] the mystery secret praise the law
[1:58:30] I love it and remember
[1:58:37] when this earth was in judgment of water
[1:58:44] and with covered in water God spoke
[1:58:51] and dried off the earth that was under
[1:58:54] judgment and brought out a brand new
[1:58:58] civilization
[1:59:00] and Noah and his family had the
[1:59:03] unbelievable privilege of walking from
[1:59:07] one destructive civilization crossing
[1:59:12] through the breach
[1:59:16] under an arc that was sealed inside and
[1:59:22] out and walked out in a brand new
[1:59:25] millennium civilization by faith
[1:59:29] and remember the bribe is going to be
[1:59:32] like Noah
[1:59:34] because we've been given instructions
[1:59:37] how to build the ark you and I are gonna
[1:59:43] walk out of this condemned judgment
[1:59:46] earth into a brand new millennium
[1:59:50] civilization were the only ones that
[1:59:52] will taste two civilizations under that
[1:59:54] seventh seal a man
[2:00:01] and it gets better
[2:00:05] in that civilization Nimrod
[2:00:09] he knew the first six seals but he
[2:00:13] didn't know the seventh seal and the
[2:00:16] first six seals caused him to try to
[2:00:21] build his own deliverance from what he
[2:00:25] saw the former world destroyed by
[2:00:31] but Abraham was the Seventh Seal -
[2:00:34] Nimrod Nimrod knew the first six seals
[2:00:40] he was in an ungodly man
[2:00:45] he knew the first four horse riders and
[2:00:48] he was working against that seventh seal
[2:00:51] but Abraham possessed the seventh seal
[2:00:53] and Abraham was the seventh seal to
[2:00:56] Nimrod he held a secret Nimrod was
[2:00:59] looking for let me say this bright my
[2:01:02] friends my friends let me say this we
[2:01:06] hold the God the rest of the world is
[2:01:08] looking for
[2:01:10] what do you think that accelerator in
[2:01:13] France is all about they want to find
[2:01:16] the sole gene of the creation of God
[2:01:18] they're trying to find the molecule of
[2:01:21] creation what they're looking for we got
[2:01:27] what do you think Hubble is all about
[2:01:29] they're sending Hubble Oh to the space
[2:01:32] up there to do what to find what started
[2:01:35] this whole thing
[2:01:36] what therefore we got
[2:01:43] we hold what they're looking for
[2:01:47] and what nimrod was looking for was in
[2:01:49] abraham
[2:01:53] amen
[2:01:55] the bride possesses the eternal God
[2:02:01] that the scientists are looking for
[2:02:06] we hold the vaccine
[2:02:10] that they're trying to find to be
[2:02:13] disease-free they wanna they don't
[2:02:17] realize it's sin that causes disease
[2:02:22] and a vaccine will never stop disease
[2:02:26] because the sin will continue
[2:02:30] and what we have they're looking for and
[2:02:33] now it's so wonderful nothing to the
[2:02:37] sixth seal of this earth
[2:02:41] the plagues are being released financial
[2:02:45] strife spiritual strife under under
[2:02:51] under environmental troubles God reveals
[2:02:56] himself to a bride in secret in the
[2:02:59] encryption
[2:03:01] it's a wonderful thing
[2:03:05] now let me get back to Genesis 24 and I
[2:03:10] I'm getting a little bit long over here
[2:03:12] now so I'm gonna try to finish off with
[2:03:15] this I trust you're enjoying this I
[2:03:16] trust that the Seventh Seal is going
[2:03:20] past your flesh past your spirit going
[2:03:24] into your soul and giving you confidence
[2:03:26] of what happens in the Son of Man
[2:03:29] ministry in our day how that he knew the
[2:03:32] program of God he knew how to keep this
[2:03:34] program secret he knew how to take and
[2:03:37] let it be revealed at the right time and
[2:03:40] now we're 54 or odd years later and now
[2:03:43] the bride is finally starting to
[2:03:45] understand what it is the prophet knew
[2:03:47] all along because she's catching the
[2:03:50] revelation that he is that he encrypted
[2:03:53] for us to find in our generation right
[2:03:59] secret passages in the Bible that's good
[2:04:03] at Genesis 24 and this is an old story
[2:04:05] for you but I want to just bring some
[2:04:08] highlights of the effect of that seventh
[2:04:10] seal so here Abraham we know is looking
[2:04:14] for a wife for Rebecca for Isaac and you
[2:04:19] understand the story how that Abraham
[2:04:21] put Isaac or Eliezer and survery under
[2:04:25] oath and Eliezer when he's going out to
[2:04:28] look for a bride remember this III can't
[2:04:32] I can't help but I remember this that
[2:04:35] the wind Eliezer is looking for a bride
[2:04:37] his dilemma was how am I going to know
[2:04:41] that that I'm gonna be successful
[2:04:43] because he put himself under oath to
[2:04:45] find a bride remember brother Branham
[2:04:47] found himself under oath he's the one
[2:04:50] that had to go find a bride but he
[2:04:52] didn't want to go find a bride by
[2:04:54] putting an adult for and on a dating
[2:04:58] site for our description of character he
[2:05:01] wanted something eternal that would hold
[2:05:04] the test of time and we find out that
[2:05:08] what happened was over here that in
[2:05:10] verse 14 that Eliezer now he's he wants
[2:05:15] the confidence that how is he gonna
[2:05:19] the bride there's gonna be a lot of
[2:05:20] women but how is he gonna recognize the
[2:05:23] bride that he's looking for so that he's
[2:05:26] successful in his journey and he makes
[2:05:28] this deal with the angel in verse 14 let
[2:05:31] it come to pass that the damsel whom I
[2:05:33] shall say let down that picture I pray
[2:05:36] thee that I may drink and she shall she
[2:05:40] she she shall say drink and I will give
[2:05:47] thy camels so watch now he's talking to
[2:05:51] the angel he said the damsel that'll say
[2:05:56] drink when I asked for a drink that's
[2:05:58] gonna say drink I'll give you to drink
[2:06:01] and I'll give thy camels to drink also
[2:06:04] let the same be the one that thou has
[2:06:07] appointed now watch that word that thou
[2:06:10] hast appointed for thy servant appointed
[2:06:15] for thy servant remember you didn't
[2:06:18] choose God God trolls you God came after
[2:06:24] his seed he knew where the seed was you
[2:06:29] weren't looking for God God was looking
[2:06:31] for you you came at an appointed time
[2:06:35] that the damsel that has been appointed
[2:06:37] for thy servant Isaac you've been
[2:06:39] appointed to Isaac remember he didn't
[2:06:44] have a choice who her husband was
[2:06:49] he came out of Adam she had no choice
[2:06:54] she was Adams wife before she knew that
[2:06:58] there wasn't Adam
[2:07:00] and there is the mystery written inside
[2:07:02] of her before she even recognized who
[2:07:05] Adam was
[2:07:07] and remember this that the bride doesn't
[2:07:12] have a choice whose husbands we are
[2:07:16] we have no choice we came in a priced
[2:07:19] we're going back to her husband it's God
[2:07:23] all in all
[2:07:26] predestinated and thereby shall I know
[2:07:33] that thou has sought kindness unto thy
[2:07:36] master and it came to pass before that
[2:07:39] he was done speaking
[2:07:40] remember Eliezer oh lord help us we've
[2:07:46] had an Eliezer called in our generation
[2:07:50] remember choosing of a bride the thick
[2:07:54] service the six service seven services
[2:07:59] in a row six services in a row sorry
[2:08:01] he's preaching on the west coast in Los
[2:08:05] Angeles the sixth service under the
[2:08:08] sixth seal under the judgement seal the
[2:08:12] sixth service the Son of Man is on the
[2:08:15] west coast and on that West Coast
[2:08:18] remember he's the one that's thrown the
[2:08:21] rock in the air he's the one that caused
[2:08:24] the judgment on the west coast and now
[2:08:28] he's back on the west coast in the six
[2:08:31] sermon he's preaching choosing a bride
[2:08:34] and he places himself under Genesis 24
[2:08:38] as an Eliezer calling for a bride and he
[2:08:42] places himself as the vile angel in
[2:08:45] Revelation 21 9 in the same sermon the
[2:08:49] Eliezer and the vile angel under the
[2:08:53] sixth service under the west coast in
[2:08:56] the west coast where he's thrown the
[2:08:58] stone to start the earthquake
[2:09:01] and while the Bible says over here and I
[2:09:05] came to pass that before he was done
[2:09:08] speaking
[2:09:08] remember Eliezer still speaking he still
[2:09:13] got the angel on the scene he's still
[2:09:16] making a deal with the angel and before
[2:09:19] he's done speaking there's a bride
[2:09:21] that's catching the secret of who that
[2:09:23] is
[2:09:24] while he's still speaking praise the
[2:09:28] Lord
[2:09:31] and I came to path before he done
[2:09:35] speaking that behold Rebecca came out
[2:09:37] who was born of besties well the son of
[2:09:42] Milcah the dell wife of neighbor
[2:09:44] Abraham's brother and with her picture
[2:09:47] on her shoulder and the damsel was very
[2:09:51] fair to look upon a virgin neither had
[2:09:54] any man no one hurt and she went down to
[2:09:57] the well and was filling her pitcher and
[2:09:59] she came up and the servant ran to meet
[2:10:02] her and he said I pray thee now watch
[2:10:06] watch friends what it was a two-part
[2:10:10] deal with the angel here's the two-part
[2:10:13] deal the woman that says I'm gonna give
[2:10:16] you to drink and the woman that'll feed
[2:10:19] the camels remember it was a two-part
[2:10:24] token remember now he's only gonna tell
[2:10:29] the Eliezer one part so I have a
[2:10:32] question for you where is she gonna find
[2:10:36] the second part so that the token
[2:10:39] matches remember there's one part to
[2:10:42] Calvary and one part in our day and it
[2:10:46] has to match remember there's a Christ a
[2:10:49] husband and there's a wife but this
[2:10:53] alone by itself is not complete it's not
[2:10:56] complete till we have an invisible union
[2:10:58] and they both think the same thought and
[2:11:01] they come together remember Eliezer had
[2:11:05] given the angel a two-part token
[2:11:10] and now do and the servant ran to meet
[2:11:13] her and said I pray thee a little drink
[2:11:15] of water from thy pitcher now watch he
[2:11:19] asked her for a drink but he never told
[2:11:24] her the second part he never told her
[2:11:27] the part about watering the camels she's
[2:11:30] gonna have to get that part that secret
[2:11:32] communication that seventh seal from the
[2:11:35] seventh seal that's not spoken in other
[2:11:38] words there was going to be no quote for
[2:11:41] the seventh seal
[2:11:42] there's only B gonna be a quote for the
[2:11:45] first six seals but there's not going to
[2:11:48] be a quote for the seventh seal but
[2:11:50] she's gonna have to catch the the second
[2:11:52] part without a quote because Eleazar
[2:11:56] does not tell her about watering the
[2:11:58] camels
[2:11:59] that's why brother Brendan says when the
[2:12:02] Eleazar got to the well brother BAM says
[2:12:06] and the angel went ahead of him by about
[2:12:09] a half an hour and the angel beat
[2:12:13] Eleazar to the well by a half an hour
[2:12:16] and the angel beat Eleazar went all the
[2:12:19] way to Rebecca's house and put a Sox and
[2:12:22] Rebecca's mind that says you know what
[2:12:25] for some reason or other I think I need
[2:12:29] to get to the well and it seems to me I
[2:12:32] just got the slot to get to the well
[2:12:34] little did Rebecca know she was already
[2:12:38] under the influence of the angel before
[2:12:41] she got to the well that's what brought
[2:12:43] her to the message it wasn't that the
[2:12:47] message of the angel the angel went
[2:12:49] ahead of the messenger to can bring you
[2:12:52] to the message I had to come to realize
[2:12:55] that God was the one that brought me to
[2:12:57] this message before the message came to
[2:13:00] me God was already dealing with me
[2:13:02] bringing me to the message I was already
[2:13:04] under the influence of that angel before
[2:13:07] I even came to the message that's what
[2:13:11] brought me to the message amen
[2:13:16] praise the Lord
[2:13:19] and now eleazar's just gonna reveal the
[2:13:22] first six seals not gonna tell Rebecca
[2:13:25] the Seventh Seal and the servant ran and
[2:13:31] said I pray thee drink a little water of
[2:13:35] thy pitcher and she said drink my Lord
[2:13:38] and she hasted and let down the pitcher
[2:13:40] on her hand and gave him to drink and
[2:13:42] when she had done giving him drinks she
[2:13:45] said I will also draw for thy camels
[2:13:47] until they have done drinking and she
[2:13:49] hasted ended her picture in the trough
[2:13:52] and ran again into the well and drew the
[2:13:54] water and drew for the camels watch now
[2:13:56] watch now here's Eliezer looking at the
[2:14:00] Rebecca and realizing she caught the
[2:14:03] part that I didn't speak
[2:14:06] this is the woman this is the guarantee
[2:14:10] that I've been looking for so that I
[2:14:13] will be successful and what's this and
[2:14:17] the man wondered at her and held her
[2:14:21] peace because he only told her part of
[2:14:24] the token but she caught the second part
[2:14:27] that he had privately talked to the
[2:14:29] angel above and to it whether the Lord
[2:14:32] had made his prosper journey or not so
[2:14:36] now he realized it was the unspoken part
[2:14:39] that was the evidence that made his
[2:14:43] journey complete praise the Lord I feel
[2:14:49] my time is up I have probably where I
[2:14:53] exhausted your time I hope you've been
[2:14:56] really comfortable and you've had a
[2:14:58] orange juice or a coffee or a latte or
[2:15:02] something but I just pray that something
[2:15:05] of eternal values been made real to you
[2:15:08] when I say things like Abraham was the
[2:15:11] seventh seal to Nimrod Nimrod remember
[2:15:16] what happened to Nimrod Nimrod had the
[2:15:19] public role of what he knew God had done
[2:15:26] in the sixth seal under the tribulation
[2:15:30] to the earth but he didn't recognize
[2:15:33] Abraham
[2:15:35] and Abraham when he walked out also
[2:15:39] showed the Seventh Seal to us remember
[2:15:42] these are secret passages in the Bible
[2:15:45] that were there all along but God had
[2:15:49] hidden them for 2,000 years these secret
[2:15:53] passages that are only going to be made
[2:15:56] available to the bride in our generation
[2:16:00] over here and brother Branham gave us
[2:16:03] the keys to unlock these things because
[2:16:06] even in Abraham's life remember his name
[2:16:08] was Abram and when he comes up to to
[2:16:12] Genesis chapter 13 he's under
[2:16:15] sanctification and our justification
[2:16:18] under Luther's message and we realized
[2:16:21] that men in Genesis 15 he's under
[2:16:24] sanctification in Wesley's message and
[2:16:27] then under Genesis 17 he comes to
[2:16:29] Pentecost still doesn't have the right
[2:16:31] name still uncircumcised still has a
[2:16:35] covenant that he can't realize and so it
[2:16:38] takes some secret in Revelations 18 for
[2:16:41] him to meet the angel that actually
[2:16:43] gives him the faith to realize that when
[2:16:47] the angel met him in the tent that was
[2:16:50] private and when the angel talked to him
[2:16:54] in the tent and confirmed his confidence
[2:16:59] to him and showed him the program what's
[2:17:02] this the Angels now all of a sudden
[2:17:06] Abraham knew that the Angels that were
[2:17:08] mercy to him were judgment to Sodom so
[2:17:11] again we see the junction of time
[2:17:13] between judgment and between mercy and
[2:17:17] here the angels are going to be judgment
[2:17:19] to Sodom but they're going to be mercy
[2:17:22] to Abraham and while they're going down
[2:17:25] to burn sawed him into it pull up the
[2:17:27] elect but Assad and remember only the
[2:17:30] relatives of Abraham are going to be
[2:17:32] saved while they're going down to burn
[2:17:34] sought him Abraham walks with that one
[2:17:37] angel and then the angel says to him and
[2:17:40] opened the Seventh Seal in verse 17 and
[2:17:43] says can I hide any of my secrets from
[2:17:46] my friend
[2:17:47] and right there the angel actually tells
[2:17:50] Abraham the secrets that nobody knows
[2:17:54] nothing about and reveals the self for
[2:17:57] six sealed the seventh seal to him
[2:17:59] because the angel himself is the seventh
[2:18:01] seal that revealed the six seals and
[2:18:04] when Abraham realized the junction that
[2:18:08] he was in that's going to be judgment to
[2:18:11] Sodom but mercy to his seed remember
[2:18:15] this there's a three-fold reason why the
[2:18:18] angel said I came to you what's this you
[2:18:21] can write this down he says number one I
[2:18:24] came to you because you're gonna teach
[2:18:27] your children think of it the confidence
[2:18:30] that the angel had in Abraham to tell
[2:18:34] him a secrets was that he was going to
[2:18:36] teach his children
[2:18:39] and number two that I know thee and
[2:18:42] number three that you're gonna teach
[2:18:44] your children and they will recognize my
[2:18:47] visitation and their generations think
[2:18:51] of the consonants the angel is put in us
[2:18:53] in our generation to teach us his
[2:18:56] secrets knowing that we need to teach
[2:18:59] our children so that they recognize the
[2:19:01] day of their visitation so the Seventh
[2:19:04] Seal is wonderful and when you see it
[2:19:07] it's all you can see even Tmart knew
[2:19:10] that if she was going to be found
[2:19:12] pregnant they were gonna burn her under
[2:19:14] the sixth seal but she knew she had the
[2:19:16] seventh seal evident in her pocket of
[2:19:19] who she was pregnant with so it's God
[2:19:22] bless you this morning I just think I'm
[2:19:25] I hope I haven't been too scattered
[2:19:28] everywhere I hope that there's been
[2:19:30] something of eternal value I hope that
[2:19:33] you recognize that sometimes when a
[2:19:35] person's life is under the judgement
[2:19:37] seal that's exactly when God's got a
[2:19:39] chance to reveal himself to make himself
[2:19:42] known so I just want to say God bless
[2:19:44] you this morning I just want to say
[2:19:46] again you have a wonderful pastor it's
[2:19:49] got a pastor's heart he himself just
[2:19:52] like myself also realized that as a
[2:19:56] pastor even as the pastor of a home of
[2:20:00] the father of a home and his brother a
[2:20:03] Lurie and as myself if we're not growing
[2:20:05] spiritually then the whole church isn't
[2:20:08] growing spiritually if us as fathers of
[2:20:12] our home are going downhill spiritually
[2:20:15] we drag our whole family with it but
[2:20:17] your pastor a wonderful man of God has a
[2:20:20] desire to grow spiritually and I would I
[2:20:23] do also and that's what makes it really
[2:20:25] exciting it's been amazing to me the
[2:20:28] secrets that God has revealed in the
[2:20:32] book that Adam once held that's just
[2:20:35] been reserved for our day so I want to
[2:20:38] say God bless you and I'm just gonna
[2:20:40] turn it over to your wonderful pastor
[2:20:43] and let him end the service this morning
[2:20:45] I hope we can meet in person someday
[2:20:48] again I hope maybe we can go to another
[2:20:50] Bowl sale I hope maybe
[2:20:52] we can do something for you and when do
[2:20:55] you want to ever run away from wanna run
[2:20:58] away from the seal and we've always got
[2:21:00] a place for you so god bless you this
[2:21:01] morning God richly bless you we love you
[2:21:04] take greetings from our church and godly
[2:21:07] with you this morning god bless amen
[2:21:13] well brother Eugene that was wonderful
[2:21:16] really appreciated that
[2:21:18] I I got so much out of it and just
[2:21:21] really enjoyed that god bless you
[2:21:24] recently my brother just I mean so many
[2:21:27] so many Nuggets day that that it that
[2:21:30] was really special one thing is have
[2:21:34] brother Eugene spoke about how this
[2:21:37] resurrection is a secret resurrection
[2:21:39] and and it was just that that link
[2:21:43] between how the resurrection now is is
[2:21:49] the the same as when Lazarus was called
[2:21:53] and this is not the general resurrection
[2:21:56] that we in that that's just that thought
[2:21:58] how he placed that in in pipe was just
[2:22:00] really special I thoroughly enjoyed that
[2:22:02] and then also he made the statement that
[2:22:05] often because of our rejection complex
[2:22:07] we fear it when the judge is present but
[2:22:10] he's the only one that can wipe away our
[2:22:11] record
[2:22:12] I mean that that's a beautiful beautiful
[2:22:15] thought also how the same Elijah who
[2:22:20] calls for the drought was the one who
[2:22:22] took care of the widow woman I mean
[2:22:25] hallelujah it's that same principle of
[2:22:27] of the lion vs. the lamb I mean to the
[2:22:30] bride he's always gonna be the lamb I
[2:22:32] mean I also love her how her brother
[2:22:36] said that that God chose us and we had
[2:22:39] no choice whether we was gonna be his
[2:22:42] bride I mean he chose his bride be
[2:22:44] before she even knew that she was gonna
[2:22:46] be his bride like Eve was to Adam Amy
[2:22:49] and of course today with with all the
[2:22:52] women's liberation kind of Minds hits
[2:22:54] and stuff people would argue that's so
[2:22:57] unfair but if you are the bride that's
[2:22:59] not on fear you are just thankful that
[2:23:02] that God chose you
[2:23:04] amen I like that thought of the private
[2:23:08] communication that private inspiration
[2:23:10] that that principle we we spoke about
[2:23:12] that some time ago but but just the way
[2:23:14] this was presented just really special
[2:23:16] how Rebecca had to catch that that
[2:23:19] thought that was in God's mind and and
[2:23:21] the perspective that that really either
[2:23:25] and the angel had a had a two-part deal
[2:23:27] you could say but how the second part of
[2:23:30] the deal wasn't spoken and how Rebecca
[2:23:33] had to come into that inspiration to
[2:23:36] define that second part and also what I
[2:23:38] really enjoyed was how how Rebecca was
[2:23:41] already under the influence of the angel
[2:23:43] before she went to the well really
[2:23:45] special and how that applies how God was
[2:23:49] already preparing us for the message God
[2:23:51] was already bringing bringing us and the
[2:23:54] message together before it actually came
[2:23:56] across her path wasn't there just
[2:23:58] something and then the Seventh Seal
[2:24:01] reveals himself under tribulation the
[2:24:03] Seventh Seal and talking back to you to
[2:24:06] Genesis and how God created order in
[2:24:09] chaos that's what the Seventh Seal
[2:24:11] that's what that person of the Seventh
[2:24:13] Seal does for us just so much brothers
[2:24:17] and sisters I would certainly recommend
[2:24:18] you having a listen to that again and
[2:24:21] and maybe I can twist brother Eugene's
[2:24:24] arm at some point to do a part two for
[2:24:26] us but we'll we'll see we'll have a
[2:24:28] discussion and see if if you would fall
[2:24:31] for that Amy well god bless you richly
[2:24:34] I'm gonna ask brother Simon to produce
[2:24:37] few songs and close the meeting but god
[2:24:41] bless you it was good to fellowship
[2:24:42] together and may the Lord be with you
