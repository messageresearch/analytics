[1:02:13] brother Steve and sister Esther up to uh
[1:02:15] to minister at rfbf so we'll see you
[1:02:19] guys soon I'm looking forward to some
[1:02:22] fellowship there but um yeah it's it's
[1:02:25] just a awesome meeting so far I I just
[1:02:28] um I I want to say this that Friday
[1:02:31] night was Supernatural in in an amazing
[1:02:35] way
[1:02:36] um and and I want to say this for the
[1:02:39] sake of the visitors because obviously
[1:02:41] you would have necessarily appreciate it
[1:02:43] from from our
[1:02:44] perspective but um there's a there's a
[1:02:47] few things that that happened and I'm
[1:02:49] just going to you know share that very
[1:02:51] openly and honestly but um over the last
[1:02:54] few weeks I've been ministering along
[1:02:56] um certain lines and and the Lord has
[1:02:59] just opened up beautiful things
[1:03:01] wonderful things um and um so usually I
[1:03:07] I've got a habit that you know when I
[1:03:08] preach a series I preach it on Wednesday
[1:03:10] nights and then I go Wednesday night to
[1:03:11] Wednesday night and if I preach a series
[1:03:13] on Sundays I preach it Sunday to Sunday
[1:03:15] to Sunday I never never cross you know
[1:03:17] between Sundays and Wednesdays and for
[1:03:20] this particular series that I'm
[1:03:21] preaching at the moment I really just
[1:03:23] felt on my heart pressed for the first
[1:03:25] time ever that I've done that as far as
[1:03:27] I can remember to go Sunday Wednesday
[1:03:29] Sunday Wednesday on the same on the same
[1:03:32] um thought and um so that's the one
[1:03:35] thing that happened and then Monday
[1:03:37] night at the brother's prayer
[1:03:39] meeting again for the first time that I
[1:03:41] can remember that I ever did that I
[1:03:43] asked the prayer and I I I had a prayer
[1:03:46] request and I asked the Lord and I said
[1:03:48] Lord please keep us on the right
[1:03:51] Revelation because it would be so easy
[1:03:53] for for us just human humanly to go you
[1:03:56] know down rabbit holes and going
[1:03:57] directions that's that's off the word
[1:04:00] and and we prayed about that um you know
[1:04:02] prayed for our local Ministry and and
[1:04:03] you know all the all the ministering
[1:04:05] brothers and so that the Lord keep us on
[1:04:06] the right track and then the Lord came
[1:04:08] Friday night and and used brother Steve
[1:04:12] and and we were buzzing from the first
[1:04:16] moment because the quotes the scripture
[1:04:19] references the Practical applications we
[1:04:22] we heard most of it in the last few
[1:04:24] weeks because the Lord had just just
[1:04:26] really been dealing with with those
[1:04:28] things and and it was as if the Lord
[1:04:31] that's why I went much Sunday Wednesday
[1:04:33] Sunday Wednesday I didn't know it but
[1:04:34] it's as if the Lord wanted those that
[1:04:36] Foundation there so that we could could
[1:04:39] really get everything that that the Lord
[1:04:40] has had for us on wedes on Friday night
[1:04:43] so we were right there from the first
[1:04:44] moment and um I'm sure brother Steve saw
[1:04:47] very very big smiles on everyone's faces
[1:04:50] because we we were right in the in the
[1:04:53] channel I guess we can say so so um
[1:04:56] really looking forward to a continuation
[1:04:58] continuation of that this morning and I
[1:05:01] and I and I want to say you know if you
[1:05:02] sit here with you know any form of
[1:05:05] complex or or fear or defensive wall up
[1:05:09] for whatever reason you can ask the Lord
[1:05:12] now to take it out of the way get your
[1:05:14] portion out of the service amen we come
[1:05:17] here we're not looking to a man although
[1:05:18] we appreciate the man appreciate brother
[1:05:21] Steve a really precious friend and and
[1:05:23] we just count him and sister Esther as
[1:05:26] as dear friends I want to also say this
[1:05:28] again and I forgive me if I've said this
[1:05:30] already in public but they are probably
[1:05:32] one of the easiest ministering couples
[1:05:35] that we've ever had in our in our home
[1:05:37] you know they they just um there's no
[1:05:41] there's no kind of Pride and have to be
[1:05:43] served because we are Ministry or we are
[1:05:45] special or anything like that they just
[1:05:47] I cannot keep sister es out of the
[1:05:49] kitchen or away from the dishwasher or
[1:05:52] anything like that she's just right into
[1:05:54] it so you know and that's that's not the
[1:05:56] case always you know sometimes you have
[1:05:58] a bit of a a kind of chip on the
[1:06:00] shoulder where people think they need to
[1:06:02] be served and and and I mean rightfully
[1:06:04] so you were happy to serve but you know
[1:06:06] it's lovely to see the the servant heart
[1:06:08] so God bless you you and thank you for
[1:06:11] bringing her to share with us a little
[1:06:13] bit brother
[1:06:14] Steve um I don't want to take too much
[1:06:17] time I just want to um share few prayer
[1:06:20] requests um I've got a serious prayer
[1:06:24] request from s Julie Oliver for her
[1:06:27] friend she says a friend of mine from
[1:06:29] Elan um I think her name is Colleen
[1:06:33] that's right her a friend of mine from
[1:06:34] Alam was diagnosed with lung cancer
[1:06:37] today um we've had a chat her faith is
[1:06:40] High um and she's really mad at the
[1:06:42] Devil and she's ready to accept their
[1:06:44] healing so can we play for her pray for
[1:06:47] her and then also um some request from
[1:06:50] Sister Gail for Carol Horan um she's

[1:12:46] surprising and the other side it's not
[1:12:48] surprising because our Lord is the
[1:12:50] master of
[1:12:52] coordination and so came from other side
[1:12:55] of the world I didn't know what he was
[1:12:57] preaching on I had no clue it makes it
[1:13:00] difficult on one end but at the other
[1:13:02] end you Just Surrender yourself and say
[1:13:04] Lord I have no clue so I just come and I
[1:13:07] and and also coming here I wanted to
[1:13:09] start with what I'm preaching this
[1:13:12] morning that was supposed to be Friday
[1:13:14] night and as I was looking at my notes I
[1:13:16] just fell in my heart I need to do
[1:13:18] another step back and start like earlier
[1:13:21] like from a different standpoint before
[1:13:23] we reach this this morning so the Lord
[1:13:25] was in it and for that we are thankful
[1:13:28] because it it shows us that we are at
[1:13:30] the right place at the right time in
[1:13:33] God's time amen hallelujah so I want to
[1:13:36] thanks everyone for coming in such a
[1:13:39] great number I want to thank R for this
[1:13:40] justess his friendship and his his
[1:13:42] welcoming and his nice words is he's so
[1:13:45] nice you are so nice amen and
[1:13:48] so me and my wife are talking about
[1:13:50] moving in New Zealand we like it so much
[1:13:54] [Laughter]
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:13:58] I understand brother Chris the Canadian
[1:14:00] that moved to New
[1:14:02] Zealand we enjoy we enjoy the fellowship
[1:14:04] we enjoy the nice spirit the the
[1:14:07] welcoming the fellowship uh and so it's
[1:14:10] really a it's really a Trill to be uh to
[1:14:12] be with you and to share the word
[1:14:14] together also amen so we will turn in
[1:14:16] our Bible this morning in the book of St
[1:14:18] Matthew's chapter
[1:14:23] 13 so I want to talk this this morning
[1:14:26] as a question are you
[1:14:30] perfect are you perfect and we're still
[1:14:32] in the same a theme about spiritual
[1:14:35] growth and the reason why we've touched
[1:14:37] what we preached on Friday night it's
[1:14:39] because I feel that whenever we question
[1:14:42] our status we hinder the growth because
[1:14:47] we always fell back to the
[1:14:52] beginning so this is our title this
[1:14:54] morning morning are you perfect and for
[1:14:58] that we're going to read in St
[1:15:00] Matthew chapter uh 13 verse 36
[1:15:05] to
[1:15:07] 40 it's quarter to 11 just let everyone
[1:15:15] know we got to know when when I
[1:15:21] started it's all good for me if you're
[1:15:23] good I'm good
[1:15:27] amen let's read verse
[1:15:32] 36 then when Jesus sent the multitude
[1:15:35] away and went into the house and his
[1:15:36] disciple came unto him saying declare
[1:15:38] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:15:40] field he answered and said unto them he
[1:15:43] that sth the good seed is the son of man
[1:15:46] the field is a whirl the good seed are
[1:15:48] the children of the Kingdom but the
[1:15:50] tears are the children of the wicked one
[1:15:54] the enemy that them is the devil the
[1:15:57] Harvest is the end of the world and the
[1:15:59] reapers are the angel and therefore the
[1:16:02] tears are gathered and burned in the
[1:16:04] fire so shall it be in the end of this
[1:16:08] world how many believes were in the end
[1:16:11] time it's the end
[1:16:14] friends that's why this topic this
[1:16:16] morning is really important let's turn
[1:16:17] also in St Matthew chapter
[1:16:20] 5 verse 48
[1:16:33] that's the scripture ASM makes a lot of
[1:16:34] people
[1:16:35] nervous it made me nervous for many
[1:16:37] years until I understood what it
[1:16:41] meant Matthew 5 verse 48 be ye therefore
[1:16:46] perfect even as Our Father which is in
[1:16:48] heaven is perfect that's by our head
[1:16:52] Lord Jesus we want to thank you this
[1:16:54] morning we're in your presence we have
[1:16:56] your word may you come down in our midst
[1:16:58] to open the word open on our heart and
[1:17:02] understanding we so we may be able to
[1:17:05] receive from you Lord we want to take
[1:17:08] every Spirit under your control this
[1:17:10] morning our mind myself Everything For
[1:17:13] Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen
[1:17:16] amen you may be
[1:17:20] seated so I want to say a word also for
[1:17:22] all the volunteers I I am pressed how
[1:17:25] many people are involved with any like
[1:17:28] the banquet yesterday all the effort and
[1:17:30] and all the the the time the investment
[1:17:33] and so may the Lord bless you you know
[1:17:36] it takes it takes a whole church
[1:17:38] together like that and maybe as a pastor
[1:17:41] I see that and I'm I'm I'm impressed by
[1:17:44] the the level of involvement and how you
[1:17:47] take that really seriously it's it's
[1:17:49] impressive I got an outside view so I'm
[1:17:51] telling you it's impressive you take the
[1:17:54] things that heart you do it good and all
[1:17:57] that in a good atmosphere and with a
[1:17:59] smile it's important because sometime
[1:18:00] you can be involved but there's so much
[1:18:03] pressure and it's it's it's not fun
[1:18:06] you're involved it it's not fun but I
[1:18:08] see that you have good time together I
[1:18:10] see that you joke with each other
[1:18:12] there's smile there's there's a good
[1:18:15] good spirit so may the Lord bless you
[1:18:17] for that and keep keep that keep that
[1:18:23] amen all right
[1:18:26] so we want to talk uh this morning about
[1:18:28] the importance of spiritual growth and
[1:18:30] maturity tonight we will close the topic
[1:18:34] of and our title tonight is going to be
[1:18:36] the cost of spiritual growth so
[1:18:38] basically Friday night and tomorrow are
[1:18:42] mostly focus on what's hindering growth
[1:18:45] because actually to have growth there's
[1:18:47] not much you have to do you just to let
[1:18:50] it
[1:18:52] go like if you do a garden like you have
[1:18:55] to put the seed in the ground put the
[1:18:56] right condition if it's outside you
[1:18:58] cannot control it but if it's in a what
[1:19:00] do you call it a hot house I don't know
[1:19:02] how you call that you know a place where
[1:19:03] it's control environment you put the
[1:19:05] right atmosphere the White Water the
[1:19:07] right water the right moisture and all
[1:19:09] that but you know what's what's an
[1:19:10] inground you have to let it grow you
[1:19:12] have to let it grow but if there's a
[1:19:14] rock sitting on the seed you have to
[1:19:16] remove it you have to remove what's
[1:19:18] hindering the growth so this is why if
[1:19:20] we want to talk about spiritual growth
[1:19:22] you won't grow if I put pressure on you
[1:19:25] you have to grow you have to grow folks
[1:19:28] the Rapture is coming you have to grow
[1:19:29] he's like yeah I want to
[1:19:32] grow what can I do
[1:19:37] nothing right so that's confusing for us
[1:19:41] so Friday night and this morning is
[1:19:43] about removing what's hindering and
[1:19:46] first of all what's hindering the growth
[1:19:47] is when we question the seed all the
[1:19:49] time or if we don't know there's a seed
[1:19:52] now it's been covered Friday and so we
[1:19:54] want to uh linger too much on that but
[1:19:57] the prophet says that's a whole lot the
[1:19:59] matter with the Brenham Tabernacle
[1:20:00] because that unbelief the cares of the
[1:20:02] world has bound the people until he
[1:20:04] cannot produce spiritual growth now we
[1:20:08] just read the parable in Matthew uh
[1:20:10] chapter 13 and sometime people are
[1:20:12] confused because there's two Parable
[1:20:14] there about a swer and about seeds and
[1:20:17] and sometime people they try to make
[1:20:19] those two Parable fits but they don't
[1:20:21] fit because they don't talk about the
[1:20:23] same thing
[1:20:25] in the first Parable deceit is the word
[1:20:27] of God in the second Parable deceit is
[1:20:30] sons of
[1:20:31] God right and so in the first uh uh uh
[1:20:35] the Earth is is is your heart and the
[1:20:38] word Falls in into your heart and and
[1:20:40] then it can fall on the wrong ground and
[1:20:41] the right ground and all that so those
[1:20:43] two parable are totally two separate
[1:20:46] subjects but the second one that we read
[1:20:48] and we just read the part where Jesus uh
[1:20:51] H explained the the meaning of it we
[1:20:55] understand that the good seed are the
[1:20:58] children of of the Kingdom so this been
[1:21:00] solved you know we we spoke on that
[1:21:02] about uh on the topic Friday night there
[1:21:04] is seeds of God that's been
[1:21:06] sold and they have to to ra to be to
[1:21:10] rais to to mature and to be ready for
[1:21:13] the Harvest at the end
[1:21:15] time so it's a simple Topic in and and
[1:21:19] when when you know as a picture you know
[1:21:21] the good sorrow of Jesus Christ he was
[1:21:22] there with his bag of seeds and he was
[1:21:24] walking around the earth and and
[1:21:26] throwing seeds and the question is that
[1:21:28] seed was already a Son of God when he
[1:21:31] was in his bag that's before you were
[1:21:33] sent on Earth you were already a Son of
[1:21:35] God so that's not in question and we we
[1:21:37] kind of solved that on Friday night we
[1:21:39] don't want to question
[1:21:41] that because if we question that we
[1:21:44] hinder spiritual growth we're not able
[1:21:46] to reach the next step because tonight
[1:21:49] we're going to realize that when God is
[1:21:51] when we grow it comes with a price
[1:21:54] because as we mature God will entrust us
[1:21:57] with greater things but if we remain a
[1:22:00] kid always wondering if we're a sons of
[1:22:02] God there's not much we can do because
[1:22:04] we're always focused on our
[1:22:06] status and not we're not going anywhere
[1:22:08] and we're not prod producing any
[1:22:16] fruits so I'm skipping a little bit of
[1:22:18] that I I had placed that and but you
[1:22:20] know we want to follow the leading of
[1:22:21] the Lord and so this is just as a
[1:22:23] foundation this is what we read on
[1:22:25] Friday night you know all the F the
[1:22:26] father giveth to me shall come to me and
[1:22:29] him that cometh to me I will in no wise
[1:22:31] cast out and so we we look that you know
[1:22:35] the God wants to remove the scare in our
[1:22:38] life and exactly this this a key quote
[1:22:41] for me here the prophet is is saying in
[1:22:43] the God who is rich in Mercy he says I'm
[1:22:45] only saying this not to mix up Doctrine
[1:22:47] but to strand it out that we might get
[1:22:49] away from fear and
[1:22:51] scare if you want to know why I'm
[1:22:53] preaching that Friday night to remove
[1:22:56] this the fear and scare you don't know
[1:22:59] who you are and because of that it's
[1:23:01] hindering spiritual growth you're not
[1:23:04] you are not going to be but now you are
[1:23:07] the sons of God you always the sons of
[1:23:10] God see for when God had you in his
[1:23:12] thinking at the beginning you have to be
[1:23:14] some part of you your life that's in you
[1:23:16] now had to be with God before there
[1:23:22] amen we also look that that that group
[1:23:25] The elected the the one that the father
[1:23:28] gave that group of people his name has
[1:23:31] been placed on that record before the
[1:23:33] foundation of the world and cannot under
[1:23:35] any circumstances have those name
[1:23:41] removed and so sometime people ask and
[1:23:44] say well how will I
[1:23:46] know how will I know and that's a good
[1:23:48] question and I I forgot to read that
[1:23:51] that verse on Friday night I'm reading
[1:23:53] it this morning warning but the Bible
[1:23:55] says that the spirit
[1:23:57] itself beareth witness to our spirit
[1:24:01] that we are the children of God so it's
[1:24:06] not when the pastor shakes your hand or
[1:24:08] they gave you a fellowship card which
[1:24:09] we're not really you know big on
[1:24:12] that membership and all that you know
[1:24:16] that's not it who's going to tell you
[1:24:18] you're in it it's not the church it's
[1:24:20] not the group you belong to which we
[1:24:22] care about that it's important church we
[1:24:23] choose pastor and all that but that's
[1:24:25] not in question because it's the spirit
[1:24:28] itself well Pastor please tell me am I
[1:24:31] in am I in good enough he can't answer
[1:24:33] to you he's not supposed to tell you the
[1:24:34] answer CU he doesn't
[1:24:36] know he's going to teach you he's going
[1:24:38] to preach the word but we that's why we
[1:24:40] want to create an atmosphere we want
[1:24:42] this Holy Spirit to come down and to
[1:24:44] Bear witness to your spirit you are my
[1:24:48] children
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:55] and because ye are
[1:24:57] Sons God has sent forth his Spirit of
[1:25:00] his son into your heart so it's not
[1:25:02] because you're good it's not because
[1:25:03] you're better it's not because you
[1:25:05] behave better it's not because you're in
[1:25:06] the right church it's because the only
[1:25:08] reason you receive the holy spirit it's
[1:25:11] because you're a son you have a seed
[1:25:14] within yourself and from that seed the
[1:25:17] quickening power comes down and quickens
[1:25:20] that seed and that is the revelation of
[1:25:23] the baptism of the the Holy Ghost the
[1:25:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the open
[1:25:28] book it's the quickening of the seed
[1:25:31] it's not speaking in tongue it's not
[1:25:33] jumping around it's not going in a
[1:25:35] prayer line even though the Holy Spirit
[1:25:37] would might do may make you do all those
[1:25:40] things cuz that's all part of the Holy
[1:25:42] Ghost but you will receive the Holy
[1:25:44] Ghost because there's a seed inside of
[1:25:48] you and when the light strikes the seed
[1:25:51] something happen in your life you'll
[1:25:53] never be the same
[1:25:56] it changes your
[1:25:59] life
[1:26:01] Hallelujah
[1:26:03] okay so let's
[1:26:07] start if we are sons of God we don't
[1:26:10] question that
[1:26:12] anymore then we have to be
[1:26:18] perfect now if I'm a Son of God what am
[1:26:22] I supposed to do now I better you know I
[1:26:26] better be good and you know because I'm
[1:26:28] a Son of God now he's expecting a lot of
[1:26:30] me because he has a lot of Hope on his
[1:26:32] sons we don't want to disappoint him
[1:26:35] there's this is a big challenge right
[1:26:37] and so then we read that scripture it's
[1:26:39] like I am a Son of God this is a high
[1:26:42] calling and when we think High Calling
[1:26:44] we're thinking performance
[1:26:48] right and so that comes from the a
[1:26:50] problem that we have is that how we look
[1:26:53] at the word perfect
[1:26:55] and we need the true Revelation and the
[1:26:57] true meaning of the word perfect because
[1:26:59] for us in our modern culture especially
[1:27:02] country that are Performance Based
[1:27:05] everything is on Merit High grades high
[1:27:08] this they hired the best it's always
[1:27:09] about being the best and to perform and
[1:27:11] doing as much you know as less mistakes
[1:27:14] as possible so for us perfect that's
[1:27:17] what it
[1:27:21] means no fault
[1:27:24] you know they do finger skating they do
[1:27:26] whatever you know they want and there's
[1:27:27] judge sitting and and they're watching
[1:27:29] every move they're watching like okay
[1:27:31] okay all right oh that's good that's
[1:27:32] good a triple woo wow okay right right
[1:27:37] oh made a mistake you had 10 now you're
[1:27:40] nine right and so when we see the
[1:27:44] scripture right away are you with me our
[1:27:47] mind Falls
[1:27:50] there and the problem is that we look at
[1:27:53] that word with modern
[1:27:55] dictionary because in modern dictionary
[1:27:58] it leans way more in a a sense or of of
[1:28:01] a no fault no mistake I'm perfect
[1:28:04] there's no mistake so the problem is
[1:28:05] that when we do a mistake we're not
[1:28:07] perfect so it means we don't please God
[1:28:09] and we
[1:28:10] fail and since we know that the sons of
[1:28:13] God are going to be perfect if I'm not
[1:28:15] perfect then I'm not a son of God and
[1:28:16] then I'm fall back into the same problem
[1:28:19] right am I the only one who went through
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:22] cycle okay so we can have a Fellowship
[1:28:24] on that topic this morning so we got to
[1:28:28] know uh uh what's the meaning of the
[1:28:30] word
[1:28:31] perfect you got it several place when
[1:28:33] you have the word perfect in the Bible
[1:28:35] we're going to do a study this morning
[1:28:36] maybe as a foundation even when the Rich
[1:28:39] Young Rong young ruler came he says
[1:28:42] Jesus said unto him because well he says
[1:28:44] I done all those things I follow the
[1:28:45] Commandments I did this I did everything
[1:28:47] I I I I perform real well and Jesus says
[1:28:50] well you got to sell everything you have
[1:28:52] like you know so if you want to be
[1:28:55] perfect go and sell that thou Hast and
[1:28:58] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:29:00] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[1:29:03] me now when we hear that we're like man
[1:29:06] he did everything right and it's not
[1:29:10] enough like Jesus is asking for more and
[1:29:13] it's exactly what how I feel every time
[1:29:16] I'm I feel like I'm doing good I hear a
[1:29:18] sermon about something okay all right I
[1:29:20] don't know I'm a failure again
[1:29:24] yeah but what we're missing
[1:29:26] here is that to be perfect was not the
[1:29:29] behavior of okay to be perfect you got
[1:29:31] to go and sell your stuff it was not
[1:29:35] about selling stuff it was about to
[1:29:38] follow
[1:29:40] Jesus because as he was respecting all
[1:29:43] the rules and all the laws he was a
[1:29:46] kid because uh if you if you remember
[1:29:49] the gender confusion we preach about the
[1:29:51] Father the voice of the father the
[1:29:53] mother and the Bible says that law has
[1:29:56] not bring nothing to Perfection because
[1:29:58] the law is the mother that tells you
[1:30:00] everything you should
[1:30:01] do but the voice of the father brings
[1:30:04] you away from the law into
[1:30:09] maturity and it's exactly what Jesus is
[1:30:11] calling him to a higher calling you're
[1:30:14] under mommy following the rules and all
[1:30:18] the laws and that's all good but this is
[1:30:20] what we're going to talk about tonight
[1:30:22] the call for
[1:30:26] maturity and the call for maturity we're
[1:30:29] going to look at that tonight is name
[1:30:32] follow
[1:30:33] me don't follow the law the rules of the
[1:30:36] church follow me the
[1:30:39] father and if you're in
[1:30:43] me you're going to be perfect if you
[1:30:45] listen to my voice you're going to be
[1:30:48] perfect but if you follow the
[1:30:49] Commandments The Ten Commandments and
[1:30:51] all the law and the rules you'll never
[1:30:53] be perfect
[1:30:54] so what the word perfect means the word
[1:30:57] perfect comes from the Greek
[1:30:59] word which means a man of full
[1:31:05] age it's a man who was brought to its
[1:31:09] end it's he
[1:31:10] finish one thing nothing necessary to
[1:31:16] completeness full grown
[1:31:20] adult
[1:31:22] mature did you see no fault here never
[1:31:25] do a
[1:31:28] mistake the Bible word perfect doesn't
[1:31:32] mean no
[1:31:36] fault and it's really hard for us it's
[1:31:40] really hard we hear perfect we fall I'm
[1:31:42] not perfect you know what in this sin
[1:31:44] body you will never be
[1:31:47] perfect but that's why we have you have
[1:31:49] to have the Revelation under the word
[1:31:51] what the word justified mean Justified
[1:31:54] mean is as youve never done it because
[1:31:55] the prophet's teaching us that the sin
[1:31:58] question has been solved that the qu the
[1:32:00] sin in the flesh Paul's teaching about
[1:32:02] it brother br's teaching about it that
[1:32:04] sin question is solved the sin in the On
[1:32:07] In the Flesh has been cursed it is
[1:32:09] solved it's a done
[1:32:16] deal so we'll prove
[1:32:20] that Ephesians 4 he gave some Apostles
[1:32:23] some prophets some evangelists and some
[1:32:25] pastors and teacher for the
[1:32:28] perfecting of the Saints so we
[1:32:31] understand for the Saints to become
[1:32:34] perfect
[1:32:36] man and and also it can be a problem if
[1:32:39] a if a if a minister is like okay my
[1:32:42] role is to make the people
[1:32:46] perfect I'm going to be a good preacher
[1:32:50] and I'm going to make the people perform
[1:32:52] and they're going to be perfect because
[1:32:54] this is my
[1:32:55] role so it's really important for the
[1:32:58] ministry to understand what the word
[1:33:00] perfect means because if they don't know
[1:33:02] they going to put that pressure that's
[1:33:04] on them says God has sent me to bring
[1:33:06] those people to be perfect and if a
[1:33:09] pastor believ that they have all kinds
[1:33:11] of rulle and all kind of measurement the
[1:33:13] measure of the skirt the measure of the
[1:33:15] the the sleeve the LA the hair
[1:33:18] everything has to be measured because
[1:33:19] people has to be perfect and we think
[1:33:21] perfect is linked to behavior
[1:33:25] which is not it has nothing to do with
[1:33:28] behavior and as I'm saying that you're
[1:33:30] like yeah yeah but in your mind is like
[1:33:32] how how's that
[1:33:34] possible because we are so caught up in
[1:33:38] our behavior and it's worse even if we
[1:33:41] were raised in an environment where the
[1:33:45] message you know how many people love
[1:33:47] the prophet only because he was strick
[1:33:54] true they love the harsh quotes and
[1:33:57] that's all they hear he rebuked the
[1:33:59] church because the spirit of Elijah is
[1:34:03] rough Spirit of Elijah is rough but I
[1:34:06] don't have the spirit of Elijah in a
[1:34:09] sense that I'm not a prophet I'm a
[1:34:10] pastor we work under that eagle
[1:34:13] anointing but it it doesn't mean that a
[1:34:15] spirit of Elijah God sent a prophet is
[1:34:17] Harsh that I have to be
[1:34:20] harsh and it's surprising how many
[1:34:23] people they love they love the ministry
[1:34:26] of the Prophet for the Cod side of thing
[1:34:30] conduct order IND
[1:34:32] Doctrine should we wear pajamas should
[1:34:36] should should we do this oh I Cod man
[1:34:39] that's such a revive for me that's such
[1:34:41] Goods food and and and what I hear is
[1:34:43] like they're looking for more rules
[1:34:45] because there's all kind of questions
[1:34:46] they're looking for the answers because
[1:34:48] they want a church to be
[1:34:49] perfect and you can run years and years
[1:34:52] and years on that
[1:34:54] atmosphere being in the message but
[1:34:57] missing the true purpose of that
[1:35:01] message
[1:35:03] right well I love this man he was harsh
[1:35:05] he was up against the denomination and
[1:35:08] and there's rebellious people they like
[1:35:10] the prophet because it looks like this
[1:35:11] guy was against the system I'm against
[1:35:13] the system
[1:35:14] too like you're not in the right Spirit
[1:35:17] you're feeding off this with the wrong
[1:35:20] spirit and that's why you know it's been
[1:35:23] years I've been in the message I can we
[1:35:24] can talk we've seen many ISM many
[1:35:28] Tendencies why because people grab this
[1:35:31] drop the message and make something out
[1:35:33] of their own
[1:35:38] agenda when Jesus called when when when
[1:35:41] Moses called people out out of Egypt the
[1:35:43] Bible says a mixed multitude came
[1:35:46] there's all kind of people there for all
[1:35:48] kinds of reasons that's why the test
[1:35:50] came the desert came the lack of food
[1:35:52] the lack of this the lack of that to
[1:35:53] test God says I want to test what's
[1:35:55] inside of
[1:35:57] you you want to Stone Moses after a
[1:36:02] while so for the perfecting of the
[1:36:04] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:36:06] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:36:08] we all come in the unity of faith and of
[1:36:10] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:36:12] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:36:14] Statue of the fullness of
[1:36:15] Christ so again the word perfect here
[1:36:18] and the word perfecting has the qu kind
[1:36:21] of a same meaning as a men of a full age
[1:36:23] it broughts to his end finished a
[1:36:25] finished product you know if you finish
[1:36:27] a product you're building something and
[1:36:29] and it's finished it's mature it's
[1:36:31] perfect in a sense that you have
[1:36:35] finished and perfecting in the same is
[1:36:37] the same thing is until they are
[1:36:39] completely
[1:36:41] Furnishing
[1:36:43] equipped God wants to equi
[1:36:46] us
[1:36:48] Lord but then we go on and we listen to
[1:36:51] this message the stature of a perfect
[1:36:53] man
[1:36:56] and every time we think we are Christian
[1:36:59] we listen to that tape and we finish and
[1:37:02] I'm not sure we are
[1:37:04] encouraged right we are
[1:37:07] discouraged why because we look at all
[1:37:10] the virtues that's supposed to be
[1:37:13] there right and I translated all my note
[1:37:16] because these are a French
[1:37:17] note so I put the pyramid but I put it
[1:37:20] in French so I forgot to translate that
[1:37:24] this when I was in the office oh no I
[1:37:26] forgot this so you're going to get the
[1:37:28] French version you know Faith virtue
[1:37:30] knowledge Temperance patience what's the
[1:37:33] other
[1:37:35] one
[1:37:37] uh this
[1:37:39] one godliness right I know in French
[1:37:51] [Laughter]
[1:37:53] let's go back to English
[1:38:00] so for me I'm going to open my heart I
[1:38:04] was a boy sitting in church all my life
[1:38:06] I saw that as a
[1:38:08] ladder a ladder I had to
[1:38:11] climb right and you climb like you have
[1:38:14] faith and The Virtue and then you climb
[1:38:16] knowledge oh my knowledge that's great
[1:38:18] and then Temperance and then and then
[1:38:20] you you you lost your you lost your
[1:38:22] temper huh
[1:38:24] you lose your temper you lose patience
[1:38:26] and and then something happened like you
[1:38:29] you lose your
[1:38:33] temper how many you I've played the game
[1:38:36] you ladder and snake
[1:38:40] right that old
[1:38:42] snake you trip on him and down you go
[1:38:47] and now you're not a Christian anymore
[1:38:49] you have to
[1:38:50] restart why am I saying that because end
[1:38:52] their spiritual growth because of a lack
[1:38:55] of
[1:38:57] Revelation
[1:38:59] right then you feel much much a better
[1:39:01] Christian you you didn't lose your
[1:39:03] temper and then something happened and
[1:39:05] and and you lose patience you're like
[1:39:07] and then I lost it I lost it I'm not a
[1:39:09] Christian because I supposed to have
[1:39:11] that to be a Christian so I have to
[1:39:12] climb all the way up and find if I get
[1:39:15] up there if I'm good in all those virtue
[1:39:17] God will reward me with his holy ghost
[1:39:25] that's been a love you it's I've I've
[1:39:27] been raised in that
[1:39:28] thinking and so people if they feel good
[1:39:32] and they have brotherly love and all
[1:39:33] that they feel they can keep those
[1:39:35] virtue all together and I kind of I'm
[1:39:37] climbing climbing Lord and if I can
[1:39:39] climb and have those all those virtue
[1:39:41] God will reward me and I will receive
[1:39:43] the Holy Ghost but when you have a
[1:39:45] failure and you you didn't have enough
[1:39:47] patience so you didn't have brotherly
[1:39:48] love in that inst stances and you got to
[1:39:50] repent he says no I if I don't have that
[1:39:52] I can have I cannot have the higher
[1:39:54] Echelon because we see that as a
[1:39:57] performance base these are
[1:40:03] Echelon and that's a
[1:40:08] problem finally you had adopt all those
[1:40:10] things and you have brotherly love and
[1:40:12] then I don't know there's a split that
[1:40:13] happened in your church and you're angry
[1:40:15] at people and then you don't love them
[1:40:16] anymore and then God rebukes you because
[1:40:18] you don't have brotherly love because
[1:40:20] you cannot love beyond the boundaries of
[1:40:21] your own church
[1:40:24] or love beyond the boundaries of people
[1:40:26] who doesn't believe like
[1:40:31] you because let me just show you one
[1:40:34] thing no I have to skip that sorry
[1:40:38] so the problem
[1:40:40] is is that what you have to understand
[1:40:44] is that all the virtue of God it's not
[1:40:47] something that God's going to download
[1:40:49] inside of you at one point you have to
[1:40:52] understand that every all of this is
[1:40:55] already in De
[1:40:58] seed it's we looked at Friday when the
[1:41:01] prophet says you had eternal life all
[1:41:04] along you don't receive eternal life
[1:41:07] when you're a good boy when you repent
[1:41:09] you had eternal life inside of you you
[1:41:12] have all those virtue inside of you it
[1:41:14] might not be expressed it might not be
[1:41:17] mature but it's laying there sir it's
[1:41:21] not like you have to add like I got to
[1:41:23] go shopping and I got to add in my cart
[1:41:26] brotherly love praise the lord it's on
[1:41:28] rebate there's on they're on sale
[1:41:30] Hallelujah right and I'm adding stuff in
[1:41:32] my cart cuz I want to be a good
[1:41:34] Christian and we look outwardly when
[1:41:37] it's in the seed
[1:41:45] already okay I feel I feel pressed to
[1:41:48] say what I was I wanted to skip it but I
[1:41:50] can't so you'll have to turn with me
[1:41:53] because it's not in my note Ephesians 4
[1:42:33] okay verse three it's really important
[1:42:35] here I heard a minister talked about
[1:42:38] that couple of months ago or year a year
[1:42:40] ago or so and it for me it was and I
[1:42:42] don't have the quote that but I'm going
[1:42:44] to refer to because it's not in my note
[1:42:45] but I just feel that I had to to touch
[1:42:47] that so I got to back off here get rid
[1:42:50] of the snakes
[1:42:53] okay so the Bible says
[1:42:56] that God sent you know the ministry for
[1:42:59] the perfecting of the saint till we all
[1:43:00] come into the unity of
[1:43:02] Faith Unity of faith means we see eye to
[1:43:09] eye so to to see eye to eye is something
[1:43:14] in the future but if you fall back in
[1:43:17] verse three do have to be in your Bible
[1:43:18] cuz I don't have in a
[1:43:21] screen PA Paul is saying let's start
[1:43:25] with verse one therefore the prisoner of
[1:43:27] the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy
[1:43:29] of the vocation wherewith ye are called
[1:43:32] with all the loneliness and meekness
[1:43:33] with longsuffering forbidding one
[1:43:35] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[1:43:38] unity of the
[1:43:42] spirit in the bond of Peace So Unity of
[1:43:45] spirit and unity of faith is not the
[1:43:48] same
[1:43:48] thing Unity of faith is we see eye to
[1:43:52] eye
[1:43:53] Unity of spirit is like you're my
[1:43:55] brother like the prophet says I draw a
[1:43:57] bigger Circle I don't see eye to eye but
[1:44:00] I keep the unity of
[1:44:03] spirit but when in ignorance through
[1:44:06] many many many years we've tried to keep
[1:44:09] the unity of faith and we would
[1:44:12] disqualify or reject as soon as somebody
[1:44:14] we saw that we didn't see eye to eye we
[1:44:17] fell we had to push him aside cuz we
[1:44:19] were looking for the unity of Faith but
[1:44:22] the the prophet says I don't have the
[1:44:24] quote I might show it to you tonight but
[1:44:26] I know you trust me but the prophet says
[1:44:29] only when we going to see Jesus face to
[1:44:33] face that we will have the unity of
[1:44:38] Faith until the prophet says I even
[1:44:41] disagree with my own wife and that's why
[1:44:44] it's so hard sometimes for marriage to
[1:44:45] be together because we we are looking
[1:44:48] for a perfect marriage and perfect
[1:44:50] marriage equals seeing eye to eye that's
[1:44:54] possible mean my wife doesn't see eye to
[1:44:56] ey but we have to cultivate the unity of
[1:45:03] spirit and we have disqualified people
[1:45:07] but when we do good on that Journey
[1:45:09] you'll split your church over and over
[1:45:11] and over and over until you are alone
[1:45:13] and it's exactly what happened how many
[1:45:15] people are sitting at home listening to
[1:45:17] a tape cuz that's the only one they can
[1:45:19] agree with is
[1:45:21] themselves sometimes not
[1:45:23] even cuz they keep changing their mind
[1:45:26] cuz they disagree with themselves so
[1:45:29] that's a sign not that's not a that's
[1:45:30] not the sermon this morning but if if if
[1:45:33] you take verse three and verse 13 it
[1:45:37] says keep the unity of the spirit in the
[1:45:40] bond of Peace till we all come in the
[1:45:44] unity of Faith what's in between is
[1:45:47] everything that's needed to reach that
[1:45:50] so our purpose today is to keep the
[1:45:53] unity of
[1:45:57] spirit we are heading to the unity of
[1:46:02] Faith but I don't think it's possible in
[1:46:04] those bodies because we have our
[1:46:05] backgrounds and that's why we preached
[1:46:07] last night on different we have all
[1:46:09] different
[1:46:10] conscience you know somebody is
[1:46:12] condemned about eating meat that's what
[1:46:15] sacrificed the Idol idol and the other
[1:46:17] one the other one doesn't care Paul
[1:46:19] didn't say you have all to be the same
[1:46:21] and have the same belief and have the
[1:46:22] same conscience and think the same Paul
[1:46:25] has never preached that we have to think
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:30] same amen side note
[1:46:35] over that's a
[1:46:38] bonus all right so a lot of people their
[1:46:41] Christian life looks like
[1:46:43] that and it was my life for many many
[1:46:46] many years even as a
[1:46:48] minister until I realize the meaning of
[1:46:51] the word perfect
[1:46:56] and that what that that that's why I was
[1:46:58] so hard on
[1:46:59] myself and when we're so hard on
[1:47:02] ourselves so afraid of doing a mistake
[1:47:04] because if we do a mistake we fall back
[1:47:05] to the beginning and then it questions
[1:47:08] everything and you can never grow
[1:47:11] because because all your life's Focus
[1:47:14] it's about to maintain a a a a a per a
[1:47:18] per a
[1:47:20] perfect walk
[1:47:23] it is so difficult Lord is it okay if I
[1:47:26] put my feet there because if I do a
[1:47:28] mistake I go back to the beginning means
[1:47:30] I don't have the Holy Ghost maybe I'm
[1:47:32] not a son of God and and so and then
[1:47:34] what you know what it does Fear
[1:47:36] paralyzed and we're not doing anything
[1:47:38] we're not moving it by fear and then
[1:47:39] when when other people are free and and
[1:47:41] they do something for the Lord we're
[1:47:43] like how come they can do all
[1:47:46] that and then he makes a mistake in
[1:47:48] doing something for I I know I knew look
[1:47:51] look he did something wrong I'm I'm
[1:47:53] better paralyzed I did nothing
[1:47:55] wrong but there's a sin that's called a
[1:47:58] sin of
[1:48:00] omission and doing nothing sometime it's
[1:48:03] a lack of faith because you're Paralyzed
[1:48:05] by fear fear of doing a
[1:48:08] mistake but the Bible says that just
[1:48:10] falls seven
[1:48:14] times and yeah it has that same reaction
[1:48:17] two three amen the rest are like where
[1:48:18] is he going with
[1:48:21] that yeah
[1:48:23] the word just and the word
[1:48:26] fall in the same sentence doesn't work
[1:48:29] for us and you had the word seven forget
[1:48:34] it maybe one
[1:48:37] time I can seven come on man doesn't
[1:48:40] learn
[1:48:42] anything after one after one mistake I
[1:48:45] mean you're supposed to know you mean
[1:48:48] that you you you would you would repeat
[1:48:49] the same mistake really
[1:48:54] that's that's in the
[1:48:56] Bible but you know what he does he raise
[1:48:58] back up again because he know the sin
[1:49:01] question has been
[1:49:03] solved he knows the atonement at the
[1:49:05] cross he doesn't bring his behavior on
[1:49:08] the altar he brings the
[1:49:13] lamb I wanted to use that last night as
[1:49:15] a test because we were talking about our
[1:49:17] conscience I says are you living in a
[1:49:19] small box where everything is so strict
[1:49:21] and everything and I and the test I'm
[1:49:23] using is when I quote that scripture if
[1:49:25] it blocks in your mind the just fall
[1:49:28] seven time if it blocks in your mind you
[1:49:31] got to go back and reestablish what
[1:49:34] Grace
[1:49:35] is you're still too much on
[1:49:38] behavior and I hear you like I right I'm
[1:49:41] preaching I hear you like brother Steve
[1:49:43] you're removing all kind of demand and
[1:49:45] pressure based on Behavior do you don't
[1:49:48] you know what's going to cost to the
[1:49:49] church people going to run away and
[1:49:53] they're going to do this like like like
[1:49:55] you were waiting for church permission
[1:49:58] to go in a bar and start drinking like
[1:50:01] if that's what you want to do do it
[1:50:04] don't ask for the permission go do it or
[1:50:06] ask God to change your heart God wants
[1:50:09] to change our
[1:50:11] desires
[1:50:15] amen so the proof here that the word
[1:50:18] perfect is linked to maturity well you
[1:50:20] got it right there in the scripture
[1:50:22] scripture
[1:50:23] scriptures if you are perfect you are no
[1:50:26] more
[1:50:28] a
[1:50:31] children it doesn't say if you're
[1:50:34] perfect that stands for you'll never
[1:50:35] make make any
[1:50:38] mistakes so you have it here the Bible
[1:50:41] reveals
[1:50:42] itself so if a perfect man if you're at
[1:50:46] the measure of the stature of the
[1:50:48] fullness fullness again you have it it's
[1:50:51] complete that's what perfect means
[1:50:53] you're complete that's our goal God
[1:50:55] wants to make us complete fully equipped
[1:50:58] mature so he can trust us with
[1:51:00] things so if you are a perfect man
[1:51:03] you're no more a kid tossed and fro like
[1:51:06] I was like this tossed and fro and
[1:51:07] carried about with every wi of Doctrine
[1:51:10] by the S of man and cunning craftiness
[1:51:12] where do they lie and wait to deceive
[1:51:14] that's why so many people they run from
[1:51:16] it for a new idea well the prophet says
[1:51:18] we're not allowed to do this okay I'll
[1:51:20] stop doing it the prophet says we're not
[1:51:21] allow well I'll stop doing that the
[1:51:22] prophet says well you should well I'll
[1:51:24] do this and you're you're tossed and fro
[1:51:27] from from you always in you're always in
[1:51:30] in fear that you're going to find a new
[1:51:32] quote that tell you how wrong you
[1:51:36] are and there's expert
[1:51:39] around I call them Pharisees cuz that's
[1:51:42] exactly the spirit of Pharisees they
[1:51:44] were expert to find stuff in the word
[1:51:47] and and if they was they were not there
[1:51:48] they were making it
[1:51:50] up you you've heard that people like
[1:51:52] well I found a quote really what is it
[1:51:55] oh brother are you ready well you're
[1:51:58] doing this you're not supposed to do
[1:51:59] that cuz the B Prophet said and then
[1:52:01] they read you the quote is
[1:52:04] like kind of feel you're stretching this
[1:52:06] no brother you need a revelation to see
[1:52:09] it these are wied
[1:52:12] doctrines only the bride will see this
[1:52:16] well I guess I'm not in the bride and
[1:52:17] you are you are tossed to and fro
[1:52:21] carried about every abduction because
[1:52:23] you're a kid just trying to please mama
[1:52:26] and find a new rule to make her happy
[1:52:29] but when we move to Perfection we move
[1:52:31] to the
[1:52:33] father thank
[1:52:36] you but speaking the truth in love
[1:52:40] may grow to be perfect you need to grow
[1:52:45] up onto him in all things which is the
[1:52:49] head even Christ so the problem is as as
[1:52:53] long as we see the word perfect as a no
[1:52:56] fault we are careful about all the rules
[1:52:59] and our minds is set on rules to be sure
[1:53:02] that we are perfect but in doing that we
[1:53:05] don't
[1:53:06] grow and we then remain a children and
[1:53:10] you see how counterproductive it
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:18] is so there's a purpose for that
[1:53:24] the purpose for that if you take the
[1:53:26] first sentence of each phrase there's a
[1:53:28] purpose for Ephesians 4 he gave for the
[1:53:34] till we that we ends forth we are going
[1:53:40] somewhere he gave this for that till we
[1:53:45] that
[1:53:47] we do you see the moving
[1:53:50] forward there's a purpose for
[1:53:56] that that's why when we say that the
[1:54:00] rules doesn't bring nobody to maturity
[1:54:03] because the word perfect means maturity
[1:54:05] the Bible says for the law made nothing
[1:54:08] perfect but the bringing of a better
[1:54:10] hope did by the which we draw nigh unto
[1:54:13] God so against you have it's the same
[1:54:15] Greek word
[1:54:17] tell so the law so you want to control a
[1:54:22] church CH you want to control your
[1:54:23] family you had more
[1:54:25] rules you're condemning them to stay
[1:54:31] immature because when everything is a
[1:54:33] rule you don't take any decision well do
[1:54:37] it why do it well I'll do it but God has
[1:54:41] not created us to be
[1:54:43] robots and I'll give you an example I
[1:54:45] gave last night the prophet was you know
[1:54:48] in his ministry he was doing prayer
[1:54:51] lines he had big prayer lines but
[1:54:53] because he was seeing a vision for
[1:54:54] almost every one of them he could go
[1:54:56] with three four five and if he would
[1:54:59] stretch it he would he would almost pass
[1:55:00] out and they would have the deacons or
[1:55:02] Billy Paul will send him and so but ARL
[1:55:05] Roberts was praying for 500
[1:55:08] people and people criticize the meaning
[1:55:11] of the Prophet because he said well
[1:55:12] brother har Roberts pray for 500 your
[1:55:15] prayer line last let just a couple of
[1:55:16] people and your closing people were
[1:55:18] disappointed so he had a lot of pressure
[1:55:21] and and and and and and you know brother
[1:55:24] Brandon was like us you know you want to
[1:55:25] please people and and and and so he says
[1:55:28] and so he said the next time the angel
[1:55:30] come I'm going to ask the angel what
[1:55:33] should I do five or
[1:55:36] 500 there must be a number for me to be
[1:55:40] in the
[1:55:41] perfect will of God so because I I I I'm
[1:55:45] supposed to do exactly what God wants me
[1:55:48] to do so I'm pleasing God the prophet
[1:55:50] was not trying to please people he
[1:55:52] wanted to please God but he expected
[1:55:54] from God a number so when the angel came
[1:55:58] the prophet asked a question they were
[1:55:59] saying this Rob 500 and me couple so
[1:56:02] what should I do and then the angel
[1:56:05] replied do as you are
[1:56:11] LED give me a
[1:56:14] number I want a number so I can feel
[1:56:18] safe and
[1:56:20] secure that's what he want that's all
[1:56:23] what we want Lord show me what to do go
[1:56:25] by faith I don't want to go by faith cuz
[1:56:27] I can do a mistake I don't want to I
[1:56:30] want to have a no fault in my life so
[1:56:32] Lord tell me what to do go by faith do
[1:56:36] as you're LED what is your motive what
[1:56:38] is your objective go by faith well what
[1:56:41] if what if I'm
[1:56:42] wrong if you're wrong God's going to
[1:56:44] show it to
[1:56:46] you God's going to show it to you Lord
[1:56:49] I'm sorry you know my motive was right
[1:56:50] but I realized that was not the thing to
[1:56:52] to do Lord praise the Lord I'm going to
[1:56:54] rise up again and I'm I'm going to go at
[1:56:56] it again it's like the men that Prophet
[1:56:59] talks about he he was supposed to be
[1:57:01] hired and on his pen he didn't have any
[1:57:05] eraser and he says we won't hire you
[1:57:07] well he says I don't need an eraser cuz
[1:57:09] I don't do mistakes says we won't hire
[1:57:12] you cuz we don't want those kind of
[1:57:14] people bring an eraser on your spiritual
[1:57:17] life and that eraser is the blood of
[1:57:19] Jesus Christ every mistake pass presents
[1:57:22] and future is already
[1:57:24] covered because the sin question has
[1:57:26] been dealt
[1:57:30] with so in the beginning you know of the
[1:57:32] message the beginning of the movement
[1:57:34] they were using all the quotes that were
[1:57:36] harsh and rules don't do this do this do
[1:57:38] that don't touch don't look don't don't
[1:57:40] do to it's to hope to bring the church
[1:57:44] to
[1:57:45] Perfection it didn't work people were
[1:57:49] fighting each other people were spying
[1:57:51] each other like the guest
[1:57:53] Appo I saw brother so and so you know
[1:57:56] what he did and people are spying
[1:57:58] because you such you have this
[1:57:59] atmosphere that you living under the law
[1:58:01] like exactly like the
[1:58:04] Pharisees that's right and doesn't bring
[1:58:06] nobody to to adulthood he bring nobody
[1:58:08] to maturity everybody
[1:58:10] fusses they're trying to find a new
[1:58:14] rule it doesn't
[1:58:18] work so law made nothing perfect you
[1:58:21] know why law was sent the Ten
[1:58:25] Commandment they were send only and
[1:58:29] that's in the Book of Romans Paul
[1:58:30] explains that the Ten Commandments and
[1:58:33] all the law they were sent to prove to
[1:58:35] you and to me that it's impossible to
[1:58:38] follow the
[1:58:40] law and that you are a sinner CU if the
[1:58:44] law would have worked we didn't need to
[1:58:47] cross but the law was to show to every
[1:58:51] one of us you can't make it without the
[1:58:55] cross you need the cross but the problem
[1:58:59] is sometime after people are Christian
[1:59:00] well I receive the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:59:02] supposed to be perfect then I can follow
[1:59:04] the ten
[1:59:07] commandments cuz now the Ten
[1:59:09] Commandments are written in my heart so
[1:59:10] now I'm supposed to fall perfectly in
[1:59:12] line but you still live in the flesh of
[1:59:14] course the law of God is written in your
[1:59:16] heart but you're in your flesh so you
[1:59:18] might fail sometime and that's why
[1:59:20] there's an atonement
[1:59:26] all right let's move on cuz we got a lot
[1:59:32] more so Paul is talking I was made a
[1:59:35] minister in whom we preach warning every
[1:59:37] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:59:40] that we may present every man perfect so
[1:59:44] tellos it was the line here so every
[1:59:48] time you have the word perfect in the
[1:59:50] Bible it's a about maturity wanting
[1:59:53] nothing complete that's the purpose so
[1:59:57] the purpose of Paul is saying I was a
[1:59:59] minister and I'm preaching to make
[2:00:01] people mature and
[2:00:03] complete but if you preach rules you you
[2:00:06] keep people on the kids
[2:00:09] level so James 1 says let but let
[2:00:13] patience have have her perfect word that
[2:00:16] ye may be perfect and entire wanting
[2:00:19] nothing so you got to fool again we we
[2:00:22] isolated the word perfect but we never
[2:00:24] look at the
[2:00:25] context the per the word perfect strike
[2:00:28] us so hard we stop read reading but here
[2:00:33] he's saying perfect which is entire
[2:00:35] means complete wanting nothing that's
[2:00:38] the that's the meaning of the word
[2:00:43] perfect so I think you got the
[2:00:47] point he talking about kid here every
[2:00:50] for everyone that uses milk
[2:00:52] is unskillful in the word of
[2:00:54] righteousness for he is a babe but
[2:00:57] strong meat belong to them that are full
[2:00:59] age again it's the same word
[2:01:03] tellos perfect so we could have read but
[2:01:06] strong me belonging to them that are
[2:01:09] perfect you start seeing it's in the
[2:01:11] Bible it's
[2:01:12] everywhere even those who by reason have
[2:01:14] used and so you're either a baby or you
[2:01:17] have full age and if you're a baby don't
[2:01:21] don't don't crush yourself this
[2:01:24] morning babies are awesome your father
[2:01:27] is God I mean you're in good hands you
[2:01:30] can start growing cuz now the
[2:01:32] competitiveness here based performing
[2:01:34] based they listen to this sermon and
[2:01:36] they're not blessed they're like I'm
[2:01:37] still a baby so what's the
[2:01:40] worth I'm not full grown I'm not a full
[2:01:43] man you know you always find the
[2:01:47] negative side to every sermon and apply
[2:01:49] it to yourself
[2:01:53] God wants to free you from
[2:01:58] that again but when that which is
[2:02:00] perfect is come then that which in part
[2:02:02] shall be done away so perfect is
[2:02:05] complete
[2:02:06] partial
[2:02:08] complete
[2:02:09] partial complete when I was a child I
[2:02:13] spake like a child why because I was
[2:02:16] partial but God wants to make us
[2:02:18] complete so we understood as a child we
[2:02:21] thought as a child but when I became
[2:02:24] aen perfect I put away childish things
[2:02:28] for now we see true a glass Darkly but
[2:02:30] then when but then face to face now I
[2:02:33] know in part but then shall I know even
[2:02:35] as I so I am known when we going to see
[2:02:37] Jesus face to
[2:02:43] face then when Jesus was on the
[2:02:47] cross he
[2:02:50] said when Jesus therefore had received
[2:02:53] the vinegar he said it is
[2:02:55] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[2:02:58] up the ghost you know what's the Greek
[2:03:00] word when he was at the cross and he
[2:03:02] spread his arm he says it is
[2:03:07] oh
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:12] Hallelujah it is
[2:03:14] finished that word has a deeper s it's
[2:03:17] talking about being
[2:03:18] paid it's fulfilled it's f finish it has
[2:03:22] many meaning first of all it is finished
[2:03:24] I'm dying it is finished I paid the
[2:03:28] price it is finished in the sense of
[2:03:30] this is now accomplished it's
[2:03:32] perfect because because he died and he
[2:03:35] gave his life nothing could stop you now
[2:03:39] not sin that's why it says nothing shall
[2:03:41] separate us from the love of God neither
[2:03:43] that tribulation whoever whatever
[2:03:46] because he spread his harm and he gave
[2:03:47] up the ghost He said it it's finished
[2:03:50] and because of that you and me have a
[2:03:53] Greater
[2:03:55] Hope
[2:04:01] Hallelujah all
[2:04:07] right let's go back to
[2:04:10] Matthew after hurry up
[2:04:14] here how many believe we're in the
[2:04:16] harvest
[2:04:17] season so if we're in the harvest season
[2:04:20] we're in the maturity season
[2:04:23] that's why it's time to put all the
[2:04:24] childish thing aside cuz it's the time
[2:04:27] to grow
[2:04:28] up
[2:04:30] so the Harvest is the end of the world
[2:04:34] and it's the children of the Kingdom
[2:04:36] that
[2:04:37] needs to
[2:04:39] mature so we need to enter a season of
[2:04:42] maturing now to understand that we got
[2:04:44] to go back to draw the prophecy of you
[2:04:47] know the former rain and the latter rain
[2:04:49] I got to go quick on that but I I know
[2:04:51] you are well taught in the word so we
[2:04:53] just just want to he hit here at climax
[2:04:55] so we understand how come why is the
[2:04:57] word perfect being mature is so
[2:04:59] important right now for us to De uh dive
[2:05:02] into it is so important because we are
[2:05:04] in the season of
[2:05:08] maturing so the prophet in uh spoken
[2:05:11] word is original seeds talking about the
[2:05:13] you know the there was a reign of
[2:05:15] teaching you know the former reain was
[2:05:16] teaching and the rain of the rain the
[2:05:18] latter rain is the rain of harvest you
[2:05:21] another word I'll be a it'll be a
[2:05:23] teaching rain and a harvest rain now
[2:05:26] we've had the teaching rain and we're
[2:05:27] ready now for the Harvest rain now you
[2:05:30] have to look at the dates because there
[2:05:32] are a lot of people who read quotes but
[2:05:34] they don't understand quotes they don't
[2:05:35] look at the date they they they would
[2:05:37] read that this morning and says Oh
[2:05:38] Praise the Lord you know the Harvest
[2:05:40] rain is coming no that scripture is
[2:05:44] fulfilled that was in 62 but something
[2:05:46] happened later and we're going to dive
[2:05:48] into this this morning for us to
[2:05:49] understand the Harvest rain is not
[2:05:50] coming it's pouring right
[2:05:52] [Applause]
[2:05:53] now you know the first rain is when you
[2:05:56] plant the seed that start you crop your
[2:05:58] crop growing but ju then just before it
[2:06:01] matures then comes another crop and
[2:06:03] that's what they call the Harvest R so
[2:06:05] the Harvest rain is the L latter rain
[2:06:08] that make the crop mature ready to be
[2:06:12] ribbon so that's why the prophet's
[2:06:14] talking about you know that we need he
[2:06:18] the Son of God s o n Su n we have to lay
[2:06:22] in his presence to remove all the
[2:06:24] greenness outside of our life for us to
[2:06:27] become
[2:06:29] mature so in the spoken word says what's
[2:06:31] the matter she is now waiting for the
[2:06:34] latter rain that's when she produces her
[2:06:38] fruits I hope you get her then the kind
[2:06:42] of seed you have planted in your field
[2:06:43] will be the kind of crop you will reap
[2:06:45] so it's all about the where you come
[2:06:47] from the seed that was planted and the
[2:06:51] seed that was planted it comes from the
[2:06:52] bag of the Lord Jesus Christ sons of God
[2:06:56] sons of God sons of
[2:06:58] God there's no changes of species what
[2:07:02] you put in the ground will come to
[2:07:05] maturity
[2:07:07] Hallelujah so he says God isn't going to
[2:07:10] plant a new church but he's going to
[2:07:11] bring his original planting back to the
[2:07:13] original seed he is going as he stated
[2:07:16] in verse 23 by the teaching of former
[2:07:18] Reign next will come the Harvest rain
[2:07:24] or rapturing faith okay so the Harvest
[2:07:29] Reign is the faith for the Rapture so
[2:07:33] the rapturing faith is what we need to
[2:07:37] mature so something needs to happen now
[2:07:41] there's a lot of people like like the
[2:07:42] pyramid you know well now I need to go
[2:07:44] back to the grocery and go by and add to
[2:07:46] my cart rapturing fate man I hope it's
[2:07:49] on sale
[2:07:53] and sometime people are are are are
[2:07:55] confused because we you got to
[2:07:57] understand what we're talking about even
[2:07:59] when you read St John you need the you
[2:08:01] know the comforter will come then the
[2:08:03] spiritual truth will come then this
[2:08:05] peace will come it's like man I need to
[2:08:06] buy so many things no it's all the same
[2:08:09] thing it's
[2:08:12] him rapturing faith is in the
[2:08:18] seed it's already in the seed but need
[2:08:21] the right kind of rain to express it so
[2:08:25] we need to recognize how did that season
[2:08:28] start what causes the latter ring to
[2:08:31] come to Give Me ratering
[2:08:34] Faith and in seeing that it will bring
[2:08:37] me to
[2:08:42] maturity so the prophet is saying here
[2:08:45] we got to remember that Harvest rain
[2:08:48] equals rapturing faith
[2:08:51] obviously because if the seed is mature
[2:08:54] he has to be riing to be to be brought
[2:08:56] into G you call you call it a
[2:08:58] Garner right in the barn to be brought
[2:09:01] up out there so that that rain will make
[2:09:05] that seed mature so he can be
[2:09:08] Rapture we're in that season right now
[2:09:11] praise the
[2:09:14] Lord so there's coming forth seven
[2:09:17] mysterious Thunders that's not even
[2:09:19] written at all that's right and I
[2:09:21] believe that through those seven
[2:09:23] Thunders will be revealed the last day
[2:09:25] in order to get the bride together for
[2:09:28] rapturing fate we're going with h with
[2:09:32] it's like a puzzle we're we're hading
[2:09:34] pieces together and at the end of the
[2:09:36] service we want to have a more clear
[2:09:38] picture so if the latter rain equals
[2:09:40] rapturing faith and that rapturing faith
[2:09:44] comes with the revelation of the seven
[2:09:46] tunders now we we know where to look
[2:09:48] at to to see how that season
[2:09:57] started for those are not familiar the
[2:10:00] seven Thunders is the revelation of the
[2:10:01] Seven Seals so this is 63
[2:10:04] again so we understand with the message
[2:10:07] Rapture that a prophet says something
[2:10:09] for the first time he links the seven
[2:10:13] seal and those seven angel coming down
[2:10:15] he links it to the coming of the
[2:10:19] Lord which a lot of people in this
[2:10:21] message are missing it because he said
[2:10:23] it once at the end of his ministry and
[2:10:26] there's people unfortunately in the
[2:10:28] message that to believe something they
[2:10:30] have to see the prophet saying 10 times
[2:10:32] and unless he say 20 times they don't
[2:10:35] believe
[2:10:36] it but how many how many times John the
[2:10:38] Baptist says this is
[2:10:40] he right I think we have twice recorded
[2:10:43] in the Bible he says this is the Lamb of
[2:10:46] God that takes away the sin of the world
[2:10:49] well John the Baptist said said that
[2:10:51] once you
[2:10:52] know and I was not even
[2:10:56] there now what's important is not
[2:10:59] quantity it's not the fact you were
[2:11:00] there now what's important did he say it
[2:11:04] right well he said it and we had that
[2:11:07] moment with the prophet when he says
[2:11:09] this is your lord up
[2:11:11] there coming down with a
[2:11:16] shout and that coming down with a shout
[2:11:19] is the revelation of the seals you know
[2:11:21] for too many people they see the seals
[2:11:23] as
[2:11:24] information no the seals is not
[2:11:27] information it has
[2:11:29] information but the seventh seal the
[2:11:32] seventh one is Christ himself coming
[2:11:35] down and that's the main part is that he
[2:11:38] has come and he is here to gather his
[2:11:42] bride the prophet said that Christ
[2:11:44] himself opened the seal cuz he is the
[2:11:47] seal and in coming down with the shout
[2:11:49] he is gathering in the bride
[2:11:52] himself and that's what
[2:11:55] causes the rapturing
[2:11:57] faith knowing that we are in that season
[2:12:01] right
[2:12:07] now so those seven tunders or those
[2:12:09] seven seal because they are tunders
[2:12:12] unless they're revealed the once where
[2:12:14] they're reveal it's no more a
[2:12:17] mystery a thunder is the voice of God in
[2:12:19] mystery form is
[2:12:23] did you hear what he said no I just
[2:12:27] heard right people on Earth even like
[2:12:30] they hear thunder when when when God is
[2:12:32] talking but when the Thunder is revealed
[2:12:35] now you say you know what he's
[2:12:37] saying
[2:12:39] amen and so he says there were three
[2:12:41] stages of it as I said the martyr's age
[2:12:44] and the stage of the reformers and now
[2:12:46] they're calling out time when finish at
[2:12:50] Le O and according to Revelation 10 the
[2:12:53] mystery of all the Bible would be known
[2:12:55] to the bride is that right Revelation 10
[2:12:57] listen close now bride called out by the
[2:13:00] word Christ himself calling out the
[2:13:04] bride so it's not the church calling you
[2:13:07] it's not the rules calling you it's not
[2:13:09] even William bradam calling you because
[2:13:11] he has pointed you William bradam has
[2:13:13] pointed you to Christ and now your eyes
[2:13:15] is on Christ and as your eyes is on
[2:13:18] Christ he's maturing you because he's
[2:13:21] telling you I have come down in 63 and
[2:13:24] with my shout I'm gathering people
[2:13:26] calling out of out of many mothers many
[2:13:33] womens to
[2:13:35] gather not to make another church even
[2:13:38] though when we are gathered we are a
[2:13:40] church because we are a woman but it's
[2:13:42] to be gathered around Christ we don't
[2:13:44] want to recreate the same system we were
[2:13:47] supposed to leave
[2:13:54] so when Christ came down in
[2:13:58] 63 that's exactly what the prophet says
[2:14:01] I hope I hope you get
[2:14:03] it those seven Thunders they bring the
[2:14:06] bright together for rapturing Faith and
[2:14:09] rapturing faith is the rain for the
[2:14:12] Arvest and the rain for the Arvest bring
[2:14:15] you to
[2:14:17] maturity amen hallelujah Hall
[2:14:24] how come how so let me give you an
[2:14:26] example we we preach Friday night but
[2:14:30] because of the opening of the word we
[2:14:33] now know that we were not elected by
[2:14:36] four knowledge based on our choice
[2:14:39] that's right but because of the
[2:14:41] Revelation the seven tunders because of
[2:14:43] the revelation of the book of redemption
[2:14:45] we now know that we are chosen by origin
[2:14:49] that we were in him before for the
[2:14:51] foundation of the world right and we
[2:14:53] come from him and we go back to him that
[2:14:56] what's give us Faith to mature because
[2:14:59] we don't question our election
[2:15:02] anymore that's just one partial truth
[2:15:05] that I'm giving you to see the impact of
[2:15:08] Revelation 10 and for those who are not
[2:15:10] acquainted to that Revelation 10 you
[2:15:13] know a lot of people focus on Revelation
[2:15:16] 107 and it's important but when they see
[2:15:19] 1077 they skip the first six verse which
[2:15:22] were even more important because they're
[2:15:25] talking about Christ coming down with a
[2:15:28] shout to gather and the only people who
[2:15:32] hear the shout they have a seed
[2:15:36] inside because in that coming he comes
[2:15:39] from for those who has a
[2:15:42] seed it's disappointing when you have
[2:15:44] people they look they want to give their
[2:15:46] life to Jesus they are promising and
[2:15:48] then you when you talk to them about a
[2:15:49] prophet they're like ah
[2:15:51] well Christ is coming there's going to
[2:15:52] be a Rapture what and it seems like they
[2:15:55] would believe the Bible they would
[2:15:56] believe Jesus but when they hear about
[2:15:59] that maybe it's not for
[2:16:14] them so he says here
[2:16:18] Christ not William brandham
[2:16:21] not brother Steve not brother all not
[2:16:24] this church any other other church but
[2:16:26] Christ the great
[2:16:28] Harvester is now reaping the fruit of
[2:16:32] the
[2:16:33] earth he gathers the wheat into the
[2:16:37] Garner by coming for his
[2:16:41] own and receiving them forever unto
[2:16:44] himself then he returns to destroy the
[2:16:46] Wicked with fire unquenchable
[2:16:51] now obviously God Christ is using
[2:16:54] Servants of God don't get me wrong but
[2:16:57] the focus is on Christ a true servant
[2:17:00] needs to point to
[2:17:05] Christ but he
[2:17:09] gathers by coming for his own are you
[2:17:17] his I hope since Friday night some of
[2:17:20] you have solve that question I miss
[2:17:24] because if you're not you're questioning
[2:17:25] he's coming for you he's calling you but
[2:17:28] you're not listening CU you're you're
[2:17:30] listening but like Lord I'm not worthy
[2:17:32] Lord I'm not worthy I cannot be your son
[2:17:34] I've made so many mistake I'm not
[2:17:36] perfect that's where we fall back that
[2:17:39] is why Friday night and this morning is
[2:17:40] to remove those rocks sitting on the
[2:17:44] seed preventing you from growing cuz you
[2:17:48] question always your status and if you
[2:17:50] stop questioning your status you
[2:17:51] question your
[2:17:53] behavior amen I hope you're getting it
[2:17:57] in
[2:17:59] closing so he says I believe the church
[2:18:02] is beginning to hear the message the
[2:18:05] message is not William brandham the
[2:18:07] message is
[2:18:08] Christ and beginning to understand
[2:18:12] it but friend listen we've got to lay in
[2:18:16] the presence of the son we've got to be
[2:18:20] rippen our faith isn't ripped
[2:18:22] intellectually intellectually we're
[2:18:25] hearing the message that God has gave us
[2:18:28] and seeing the signs that he showed us
[2:18:30] and proving it proving it in the Bible
[2:18:32] it's there but oh how the church need to
[2:18:35] lay in his presence till it tenders up
[2:18:39] you know and gets sweet in the spirit so
[2:18:42] that it can be bathed
[2:18:44] down that's why I believe as more as the
[2:18:47] church mature she tenders
[2:18:51] become more soft I talked about the
[2:18:54] spirit that's in this church it's a sign
[2:18:56] of maturity because when you're under
[2:18:58] the law you're all tensed up all feared
[2:19:01] because you your behavior has been spied
[2:19:03] on and you're watching and everybody's
[2:19:05] nervous and
[2:19:07] tight that when we move into that
[2:19:09] freedom that
[2:19:11] Perfection laying in his
[2:19:14] presence then you get the sweet
[2:19:18] Spirit then it's not about finding fault
[2:19:21] in your
[2:19:23] brother then it's not about to
[2:19:25] disqualify this Minister it's not about
[2:19:28] to send him in a foolish virgin who sent
[2:19:30] him to hell it's about praying Lord pray
[2:19:32] I pray for my brother that's right or
[2:19:34] Lord even more mature Lord maybe I'm
[2:19:36] wrong and he's right oh
[2:19:40] my why don't we are so sure that we're
[2:19:43] right that's right you got an idea why
[2:19:46] are you so sure this is
[2:19:48] pride the more the year go the more I
[2:19:51] question what I believe and I'm talk I'm
[2:19:54] not talking about the word I'm not I'm
[2:19:56] talking about little detailed stuff that
[2:19:58] I was holding really holding on to it
[2:20:00] and I'm like I believe it so I'm going
[2:20:02] to do it but I'm not trying to enforce
[2:20:04] it maybe maybe I'm overboard with
[2:20:07] this in maturity you become less sure
[2:20:10] about yourself and more sure about God
[2:20:13] because God has started a work in your
[2:20:15] life and you will finish
[2:20:17] it
[2:20:19] amen amen
[2:20:21] so he says the original weed seed at
[2:20:24] Pentecost I got to hurry up here but he
[2:20:26] says it was to mature in
[2:20:31] lysia and he says but now according to
[2:20:34] the time where we stand in the Le leodan
[2:20:36] age a prophet messenger Revelation 10:7
[2:20:39] must already be in the Land once more
[2:20:41] thus said the Lord must be here ready to
[2:20:43] be manifested with infallible
[2:20:45] Vindication thus is the true seed
[2:20:47] already maturing and then the har
[2:20:52] and the
[2:20:55] thing the shock and nurture it so the
[2:20:58] shock I kind of Shield you protect you
[2:21:01] but now as the shock is pulling away you
[2:21:03] are
[2:21:04] exposed to the
[2:21:07] environment the shock has to leave the
[2:21:10] seed to get the seed in the presence of
[2:21:12] the Sun so it can be ripping all those
[2:21:15] you have been sheltered by the church
[2:21:16] the church tell you don't say that don't
[2:21:18] do that no you're not supposed to get
[2:21:19] rid of that you should buy that you
[2:21:20] don't do this you don't you the shell is
[2:21:22] protecting you but when you're mature
[2:21:25] the mother's supposed to let you go so
[2:21:28] you are connected the presence of the
[2:21:30] son is your father it's only in its
[2:21:33] presence only the father can bring you
[2:21:36] to
[2:21:38] maturity Church rules will keep you in a
[2:21:40] childish State that's right and that's
[2:21:44] what the ma the thing that matters with
[2:21:46] the message today those who obtain it in
[2:21:48] their hearts must lay in the Pres of the
[2:21:51] you got those quotes in 65 where he's
[2:21:53] saying all the church needs to do now is
[2:21:56] to lay in its presence to mature you can
[2:22:01] pick up the message and then let the sun
[2:22:04] bake all the greenest out of you making
[2:22:10] mature
[2:22:13] Christians if we change the word here
[2:22:15] making perfect
[2:22:18] Christians you're still not used to that
[2:22:22] see what I mean God is coming soon to
[2:22:25] receive his church and we must have that
[2:22:27] type of Christians to him to receive the
[2:22:30] wheat has got to get
[2:22:37] ripe so he keeps repeating that on and
[2:22:40] on the grain is to be in the presence of
[2:22:43] the
[2:22:45] sun then the great elevator will take up
[2:22:48] up his bride into
[2:22:51] to the glory the musicians can
[2:22:59] come let's B our
[2:23:11] heads Lord we need to be lay in your
[2:23:15] presence
[2:23:19] Lord like Adam and Eve when it was the
[2:23:22] evening
[2:23:23] time you were coming down and you had
[2:23:27] Fellowship Adam and Eve had no doubts in
[2:23:29] their mind that they were sons and
[2:23:32] daughters and at the evening time you
[2:23:34] were coming and they were not asking are
[2:23:37] we are we your
[2:23:39] kids will you receive us do you accept
[2:23:43] me Lord am I good
[2:23:46] enough you think this was the basic of
[2:23:48] their their basis of the their
[2:23:50] Fellowship ship it was
[2:23:53] not that's why friends we have to move
[2:23:55] on it's the evening time Christ has come
[2:24:00] down and he wants a fellowship with his
[2:24:04] bride he wants to talk to
[2:24:11] you he wants to talk to you this
[2:24:14] morning he wants to say you are mine
[2:24:20] why don't you settle this question in
[2:24:22] your heart you are my
[2:24:25] daughter you are my
[2:24:29] son I'm not looking at your
[2:24:33] behavior I'm looking at the Lamb on the
[2:24:36] cross when the worshipper was coming to
[2:24:39] worship the high priest was inspecting
[2:24:42] the
[2:24:44] lamb the worshipper was never
[2:24:48] inspected he has come down in this time
[2:24:51] in this in this end time and he wants to
[2:24:54] fellowship with his bride he's not
[2:24:56] looking at the behavior he doesn't even
[2:24:58] see you he sees the
[2:25:01] blood but he wants a fellowship he wants
[2:25:04] a conversation that's what the prophecy
[2:25:07] means when he says you got to lay in his
[2:25:12] presence why don't you lay in his
[2:25:14] presence with an open heart say Lord
[2:25:17] It's unbelievable unbelievable you
[2:25:20] received me you have accepted me I can
[2:25:25] now rest in your
[2:25:28] presence Lord we want to cast every fear
[2:25:31] and scare this morning in the name of
[2:25:34] Jesus Christ so your Holy Spirit May
[2:25:36] flow in this places from heart to heart
[2:25:39] so they can truly enjoy your presence
[2:25:43] and and lay in your
[2:25:46] presence cuz it's your presence that
[2:25:48] removed the greenest out of our
[2:25:51] life in that season where your people
[2:25:54] the people of the open book knows that
[2:25:58] you have come down and with that shout
[2:26:00] you have gathered people around you you
[2:26:03] have not gathered people around
[2:26:05] Jeffersonville around Canada you have
[2:26:08] gathered people around
[2:26:11] you cuz you've
[2:26:14] come to get the
[2:26:16] bride and she had made herself ready
[2:26:21] I pray Lord
[2:26:24] Jesus that you free your people from the
[2:26:27] bondage of
[2:26:29] Law and that they could walk into Grace
[2:26:33] because Lord when that Capstone came
[2:26:35] down the Bible says
[2:26:38] Grace
[2:26:40] [Music]
