[23:15] precious heavenly father, Lord, what a
[23:17] privilege, Lord, for us again to be here
[23:19] this morning. And Lord, we Lord had a
[23:22] bit of a taste last night of the the
[23:24] topic, Lord God, that you want to share
[23:26] to us this uh camp time, Lord. And Lord,
[23:29] an excitement has been built up, Father,
[23:31] Lord, to know what it is, Lord God, that
[23:34] you have for us in store. And Lord God,
[23:37] Lord, we are just sick of doing the same
[23:39] thing over and over again, Father. And
[23:41] Lord, we don't want to play church,
[23:43] Lord. We don't want to be caught up in
[23:44] our own religion, Lord. We don't want to
[23:46] be caught up in our own way of thinking
[23:48] and doing things, Lord. But Lord, we
[23:51] want to be fully controlled by you,
[23:53] Father, Lord. Fully surrendered to you.
[23:55] And Lord, and the power and
[23:57] demonstration, Lord, of the Holy Ghost
[23:59] in us, Lord. And Lord, I just want to
[24:01] pray now and ask, Lord. Please help us,
[24:02] Lord, just to break down, Lord, those
[24:04] barriers, Lord, and open our hearts,
[24:06] Lord, to receive from you, Lord. Lord,
[24:08] these topics may hurt us, Lord. They
[24:10] may, Lord, show us all the times that we
[24:12] fail, Lord, where we fail our families,
[24:14] Lord. We fail our friends, our parents,
[24:16] Lord, our children, Lord. But Lord God,
[24:19] I just pray that you'll give us a grace,
[24:21] Lord God, just to put that aside, Lord,
[24:23] and just say, Lord, change us, Lord.
[24:25] Bring us, Lord, into that image of
[24:27] Christ, Lord, from, Lord, that perfect
[24:29] image, Lord, a fully matured son and
[24:31] daughter of God, Lord. And Lord, that's
[24:33] our desire, Lord. It's not our desire to
[24:35] be like ourselves Lord or to to uh put
[24:38] ourselves on a pedestal or Lord to see
[24:40] what what we can be Lord in in others
[24:42] eyes Lord but we want to see what can we
[24:44] be Lord how can we Lord God get as quick
[24:47] as we can Lord God to the reflection
[24:49] that you have of us Lord Lord up there
[24:51] Father Lord and Lord as as the prophet
[24:54] said Lord in that picture book Lord of
[24:55] how Lord that complete picture that
[24:57] perfect picture that you have of us Lord
[24:59] we just want to pray Lord God that may
[25:01] be a quick work Lord that we may be able
[25:03] to surrender, Lord God, and that we may
[25:06] just uh find ourselves just so much
[25:08] closer to you after this weekend. Lord,
[25:10] we commit ourselves before you. We
[25:12] commit the service into your hands well
[25:13] and the song items, the testimonies,
[25:15] everything, Lord God. And may it be all
[25:17] for your glory, Lord, in your precious
[25:19] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[25:22] Amen. We'll just have the uh the song
[25:24] item with uh apparently Levi and the
[25:27] crew. And then after that we'll have the
[25:29] the other choir item which Chris's song

[25:34] leading. Thank you.
[26:49] [Music]
[26:52] So many
[26:54] people trying to fill a void inside. So
[26:57] many
[26:58] questions asking how asking why. I might
[27:02] not have all the answers, but I tasted
[27:05] and I seen there's a better path for
[27:08] Jesus. There's no going back for
[27:12] me. I'm going to let the way he says to
[27:17] do what he says to
[27:19] do. You can choose whatever road you
[27:22] choose. But I'm going to love the way he
[27:25] says to love. Just the way he says to
[27:29] trust. This world alone will never be
[27:33] enough. I'm going to walk with Jesus.
[27:37] I'm going to walk

[27:41] walk. I'm going to walk with Jesus. I'm
[27:45] going to walk with

[27:58] goes. All the
[28:00] lost. He keeps moving.
[28:03] [Music]
[28:04] Jesus
[28:12] [Music]
[28:17] very what he says to
[28:19] do. You can choose whatever road you
[28:23] choose. I'm going to love the way he
[28:26] says to love. Trust the way he says to
[28:29] trust. This word alone will never be
[28:34] enough. I'm going to walk with Jesus.
[28:37] I'm going to
[28:39] walk. I'm going to
[28:42] walk. I'm going to walk with Jesus. I'm
[28:46] going to walk with Jesus. I'm going to
[28:50] walk. I'm going to
[28:53] walk. I'm going to walk with Jesus.
[29:00] still I will follow.
[29:03] [Music]
[29:05] I'm going to walk. I'm going to walk.
[29:10] Still I won't
[29:14] follow. I'm going to walk. I'm
[29:17] [Music]
[29:20] going to follow.
[29:24] [Music]
[29:32] I'm going to let
[29:35] you say
[29:37] [Music]
[29:38] to
[29:39] [Music]
[29:45] you just the way to trust this world
[29:50] alone.
[29:53] I'm going to
[29:55] walk. I'm going to
[29:58] walk. I'm going to
[30:00] walk. I'm going to walk with Jesus. I'm

[30:11] walk. I'm going to walk with Jesus. I'm
[30:15] going to walk with Jesus.
[30:18] [Music]
[30:26] I'm going to walk with
[30:31] [Music]
[30:38] Jesus. Thank
[30:42] you. And then beautiful song. Thank you
[30:45] very much for that. Um, now we'll have
[30:47] the choir.
[30:48] Um, they can all come up.
[31:17] [Music]
[31:37] [Music]
[31:48] All my life I long to be a
[31:52] hero. My sword raised high. You run into
[31:55] the
[31:57] battle. I was going to take giants down.
[32:01] Be a man you would ride about.
[32:04] But deep in my chest is the heart of a
[32:08] warrior. So why am I still standing
[32:11] [Music]
[32:13] here? Why am I still holding back from
[32:18] you? I hear you call me out into deeper
[32:23] waters, but I settled on this shallow
[32:27] way.
[32:30] So why am I still
[32:35] standing? Was so afraid. What it might
[32:38] cause to follow
[32:40] me? I'd walk by faith if I could get
[32:43] these feet to
[32:45] move. But I don't want to live that way.
[32:49] I don't want to look back
[32:51] someday on a life that never stepped
[32:54] across the line. So why am I still
[32:58] standing
[33:01] here? Why am I still holding back from
[33:06] you? You've given me a faith that can
[33:10] move a mountain, but I'm still playing
[33:14] in the
[33:17] sand. Building little kingdoms that will
[33:20] never stand.
[33:23] I hear you call me out into deeper
[33:27] waters. I don't want this
[33:37] shadow. I'm so tired of standing
[33:43] here. What if I gave
[33:46] everything to you?
[33:49] What if I gave
[33:53] everything? What if I stop holding back
[33:57] from you? Starting now, I'm stepping out
[34:01] onto the
[34:03] waters. What if I gave
[34:08] everything? What if I stop holding back
[34:12] from you? Starting now I'm stepping out
[34:16] onto deeper
[34:19] waters. Want to see some
[34:24] mountain? What if I gave
[34:29] everything? What if I
[34:32] stop from you? Starting now I'm stepping
[34:36] out onto the deeper waters.
[34:40] What if I gave
[34:44] everything? What if I stop going back
[34:48] from you? Starting now, I'm stepping
[34:51] down on the water. I want to see some
[34:57] [Music]
[35:04] mountains. Ready to give
[35:07] [Music]
[35:09] everything. Say goodbye to
[35:13] standing
[35:17] [Applause]
[35:24] here.
[35:36] Beautiful. Thank you very much for that
[35:38] item as well. Amen.
[35:51] Let me just sing one more before Ari
[35:54] comes
[35:56] up. Let me stand and sing this
[36:01] one. Holy Spirit,
[36:07] rain down.
[36:11] [Music]

[36:23] comforter and
[36:27] friend how we need your
[36:31] touch again.

[36:55] love. Let your voice be more.
[37:00] Come and change our
[37:03] heart as we said our Lord.
[37:08] [Music]
[37:15] is great.
[37:17] [Music]
[37:24] No way I
[37:26] see, no ear I
[37:30] serve, no mind can
[37:34] know what God has in store.
[37:39] Open up
[37:41] [Music]
[37:42] heaven. Open it
[37:46] wide over your
[37:49] church and over our lives.
[37:57] Hol
[38:01] is God.

[39:35] touch
[39:37] again. Holy
[39:41] [Music]
[39:46] Spirit
[39:47] [Music]
[39:47] [Laughter]
[39:52] rain. Let your power fall. Let your
[39:57] voice be
[39:59] heard. Come and change our hearts as we
[40:04] stand on your word.
[40:07] Holy
[40:13] Spirit rain
[40:19] down. Hallelujah.
[40:22] Hallelujah. Amen. I believe that's our
[40:24] desire.
[40:26] Amen. The Lord works in our
[40:29] hearts. I mean, we had a wonderful,
[40:31] wonderful time last night. And I am so
[40:34] excited about today. so excited about
[40:37] the word, just looking forward to what
[40:40] the Lord has for us. And it's really
[40:42] special to be outside of our outside of
[40:45] our, you know, our normal routine, our
[40:47] normal cycle. And um it's a it's an
[40:50] opportunity to um you know, step out of
[40:53] our comfort zones a little bit. Um you
[40:56] know, it was just as I as I uh started
[41:00] singing here, just realized, you know,
[41:02] there's not the monitor speakers we have
[41:04] in church. And you know it's it's it's
[41:06] camp time, right? It's not the same. Our
[41:09] musicians is definitely a little
[41:11] different. Really enjoy the saxophone.
[41:14] That's really special. Brother
[41:16] Alistister, you probably a sax, don't
[41:18] you?
[41:20] No. Ah, yes. Yeah, that's a no. Which
[41:22] means a yes. That's right. Yeah. So, we
[41:26] we might need to sample that over the
[41:28] weekend
[41:30] sometime. Praise the Lord.
[41:33] And we just want to welcome each and
[41:35] everyone this morning. Let's just take a
[41:37] moment to dedicate our hearts to the
[41:39] Lord before the before the word comes.
[41:41] We just want to ask the Lord to to enter
[41:44] our hearts and to break break down every
[41:51] walls. Maybe if there's someone that's
[41:54] ill or that's got a need on your heart,
[41:55] you can express it to the Lord now as we
[41:57] pray. Our most wonderful and loving
[42:00] heavenly father.
[42:02] Oh father, it's just such a privilege,
[42:06] such a blessing, Lord, to to serve
[42:10] you, Lord Jesus. And Lord, my heart just
[42:14] wants to overflow with thankfulness and
[42:17] joy, Lord. Lord, joy for what you've
[42:20] done for us. Joy for the word that you
[42:22] pour out upon us,
[42:24] Lord. Our father, I am so thankful or
[42:27] just fellowshipping about where we come
[42:30] from and how how legalistic things used
[42:34] to be and how our balances were so
[42:37] wrong, Father.
[42:39] But because you cared, Father, you you
[42:42] come and show us more, Father. You show
[42:44] us more light, Father. Lord Jesus, and
[42:47] you open your word to us. You reveal
[42:49] yourself to us,
[42:51] Father. Lord, and we're so thankful,
[42:54] Lord. But it's not by our intellect.
[42:55] It's not by our abilities, Father, but
[42:57] it's by your grace.
[43:00] Lord Jesus, this morning, I want to come
[43:02] and ask, Father, Lord, that you will
[43:03] make this word alive to us. I, Father, I
[43:07] pray that you will break down every
[43:08] wall. Father, Lord Jesus, I pray that
[43:11] you will break down every human filter,
[43:13] our previous understandings, Lord, our
[43:17] building blocks that might not be of
[43:18] you. Father, I pray that you'll take
[43:20] those things down, Lord, so that we can,
[43:23] Lord, not just hear what the man says,
[43:25] Lord, but that we can hear what you
[43:27] intend with it, Father. Lord Jesus, that
[43:30] we don't just interpret your word
[43:31] through our filters, Father, but that we
[43:33] really take it in from you,
[43:36] Father. Lord Jesus, I just commit it to
[43:38] you. I lift Brother Alistister before
[43:40] you again. Pray, Father, that you will
[43:42] use that vessel for your glory.
[43:45] Lord, I also want to ask Lord if there's
[43:47] any any sickness. Lord, if there's any
[43:50] need among us, Father, you see those
[43:52] need expressed before you this morning.
[43:55] I pray, Father, that you will answer.
[43:57] Lord, Lord Jesus, there's no better
[43:59] place to bring all our needs than it is
[44:02] to bring it to you, Father. Amen. Lord,
[44:05] we just thank you. Have your way now,
[44:07] Father. Move among us, Lord. We ask it
[44:10] in the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[44:12] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[44:15] Amen. Before service, um, when the
[44:18] musicians was was playing,
[44:21] um, there was just such an anointing on
[44:23] that song. Oh yes. Oh yes, I'm a child
[44:25] of the king. Um, man, will you just help
[44:28] me find that quickly if you don't
[44:32] mind? Then we'll just call our brother
[44:34] up with
[44:38] that.
[44:48] Actually, I had the wrong song, but
[44:50] anyway, we'll sing this
[44:54] one. Oh
[44:57] yes. Oh yes. I'm a
[45:02] child of the king.

[45:11] [Music]
[45:12] [Applause]

[45:22] blood and
[45:25] vile can't

[45:39] together. Oh
[45:41] yes. Oh
[45:44] yes. I'm a child of the
[45:50] king. His royal
[45:55] blood now flows through my
[46:00] veins. And
[46:03] I who was
[46:06] wreted and vile now can
[46:11] sing. Praise
[46:14] God. Praise God.
[46:17] Oh, I'm a child of the
[46:22] king. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may
[46:25] be seated. Thank you, musicians.
[46:30] Good morning.
[46:32] Happy to be here this morning. Amen.
[46:35] It's good to be in the presence of the
[46:36] Lord. And I certainly appreciate the
[46:39] fellowship of the saints. We fellowship
[46:41] till about 11:30 last night. And uh it
[46:46] didn't feel like we wanted it to
[46:48] stop. It was just so good. Um with
[46:52] brother Matan and you can imagine I
[46:54] think most of you know
[46:56] him. It was just wonderful question
[47:00] after question and just wonderful
[47:02] fellowship just sharing thoughts. I love
[47:04] that. I love that where we can just
[47:07] share what we see and just bounce it off
[47:10] one another. It's just
[47:12] awesome. Amen. I'm I'm looking forward
[47:14] to doing that for
[47:16] eternity. So, just certainly enjoy the
[47:20] fellowship with the saints and thank you
[47:21] for your uh spirit, your welcoming uh
[47:25] wonderful uh spirits and your the
[47:28] anointing that you bring into the
[47:29] service of the Lord. It's so uh uh
[47:33] blessed to be here. So, um I'm not sure.
[47:36] I think I saw some new faces this
[47:38] morning. Some of you might have just
[47:40] come in. Uh, and I don't know those of
[47:44] you who are not here, can you raise your
[47:45] hand last night? Okay. Did you catch a
[47:48] streaming? You did? Not really.
[47:52] Okay. Uh, yeah. So, just I'm trying to
[47:56] keep to the time as best as we can. I
[47:59] believe in what the camp is about and I
[48:02] believe it's about fellowship. It's
[48:03] about getting together, getting out of
[48:05] your comfort zone. So, I'm not going to
[48:07] be here to teach uh
[48:10] uh mysteries and doctrines and uh you
[48:13] know that kind of thing. We want to make
[48:15] the message um uh easy to apply to our
[48:20] lives. Amen. Understanding and that's
[48:23] what I believe it's all about. So, last
[48:24] night we introduced our topic which is
[48:28] the
[48:30] um how it all
[48:33] works. Uh let's see if it's
[48:37] loading. Yeah. So how it all works and
[48:41] this is going to be part two and it's
[48:43] teaching on the seed. And so we uh where
[48:47] are the children? I have to pick on the
[48:48] children again. You all remember right
[48:51] the four things that a seed needs. What
[48:54] is it? Water. Water. Soil
[48:59] sun or or light and air. Okay. So you
[49:04] all believe that there's a seed of God
[49:05] in your heart.
[49:07] So it needs
[49:09] ground, it needs water, it needs air,
[49:12] and it needs light. And you are
[49:15] responsible for that seed. And you need
[49:17] to know whether you're getting those
[49:20] things. Some people just are interested
[49:24] only in light. And they don't realize
[49:26] with only light and no water, you're not
[49:29] going to get any growth.
[49:32] Some people just want water. Don't
[49:34] realize they drown out the seed.
[49:38] Nobody appreciates or cares about why
[49:41] the ground was chosen.
[49:45] And one of the most well they all are
[49:47] important, but then you have also the
[49:49] air. Of course, if you have no air to
[49:52] breathe,
[49:54] light and water is not going to work.
[49:57] Amen. So this is why we have to know how
[49:59] it all works and the um exactly what God
[50:04] wants for us in this day and it will
[50:06] give you so much of wisdom and you'll be
[50:08] able to take the mysteries this the the
[50:11] seals the thunders the church ages the
[50:13] vials the trumpets all these things do
[50:15] not become abstract mysteries or
[50:19] theories you actually know how these
[50:22] things apply to you and that's why I
[50:25] believe in campsmen so we and talk about
[50:27] these things. Amen. So, I want to begin
[50:30] by reading one of the most amazing
[50:33] scriptures in the Bible. So, today I
[50:36] should give you the plan. Uh this
[50:39] morning, we're going to deal with seed
[50:41] and ground. This evening we'll deal with
[50:44] rain and air or water and air. And then
[50:47] tomorrow morning for the Sunday service,
[50:49] we'll deal with uh light and the plant.
[50:54] All right. So, that's the plan. I I when
[50:58] I preached this in our church, I did it
[50:59] all in one service. It was about 2 and
[51:02] 1/2 hours. So, it was perfect that we're
[51:05] doing this at a camp where I could break
[51:07] each piece down and uh you know, just
[51:10] take a little short time. And so, I I
[51:13] rather not that it be preaching, but
[51:16] rather our spirits make contact with
[51:18] each other and we just talk it out. You
[51:20] happy with that? All right. So, let's go
[51:22] to uh
[51:25] Matthew chap 13:1
[51:29] 17-23. And you know it so well. You
[51:31] probably don't even have to read it. For
[51:33] verily I say unto you that many
[51:35] prophets, I love that. And righteous men
[51:38] have desired to see the things which you
[51:41] see and have not seen them. And to hear
[51:45] those things which you hear and have not
[51:47] heard them.
[51:48] Hear ye therefore the parable of the
[51:51] swer.
[51:53] Yet when you read hear ye therefore, it
[51:55] means it's referring to what I've just
[51:57] told you. Okay? So if the prophets and
[52:02] sages desire to see this,
[52:05] hear ye therefore. Right? Verse 19. When
[52:09] anyone heareth the word, what is the
[52:11] word? It's a seed.
[52:14] Amen. heareth the word of the kingdom
[52:16] and understandeth it not, then cometh
[52:20] the wicked one and catcheth away that
[52:21] which was sown in his heart. This is he
[52:24] which received seed by the wayside.
[52:27] Right? So now watch it. This parable is
[52:30] about comparing the grounds
[52:33] where the seed falls on. Amen. Okay. Uh
[52:37] verse 20. But he that received the seed
[52:39] into stony places, the same is he that
[52:42] heareth the word heareth the word.
[52:45] Hearing means understanding,
[52:48] and a non with joy receives it. How many
[52:51] people have we seen like that? Yet hath
[52:54] he not root in himself, but endureth for
[52:58] a while. That means he lasts for a time.
[53:02] For when tribulation or persecution
[53:04] ariseth because of the word, why does
[53:07] persecution and tribulation come up?
[53:10] Because of the seed, because of the
[53:12] presence of the word, right? If it were
[53:15] not for that, you'll be very happy being
[53:16] a drunkard. No issue, right? Persecution
[53:20] ariseth because of the word. By and by,
[53:23] he is
[53:26] offended. Last two. He also that
[53:29] receiveth receiveth seed among the
[53:31] thorns is he that hears the word again
[53:35] understands the word and the care of
[53:38] this world and the deceitfulness of
[53:40] riches choke the word and he becometh
[53:45] unfruitful that means he's actually
[53:47] taken it in and something else happens
[53:50] so I'm going to come back to this at the
[53:52] end and we'll explain it out properly so
[53:54] we we understand this and basically
[53:58] that the seed takes hold. The plant is
[54:01] actually growing but he bears no fruit.
[54:04] This is these are scriptures actually
[54:06] telling you there are people who's going
[54:07] to accept the word. They're going to
[54:09] even live it and live by it and somehow
[54:14] the other something happens that
[54:15] prevents them from producing fruit.
[54:18] Verse 23. He that received seed into the
[54:22] good ground is he that heareth the word
[54:25] and understandeth it, which also beareth
[54:28] fruit and bringeth forth some 100fold,
[54:31] some 60, some 30. Wonderful. Amen. So
[54:35] without getting into too much of that,
[54:37] I'll bring that towards the end and
[54:39] we'll close it off with that. Okay. So,
[54:42] do you already see I'm sure your
[54:44] appetites are already
[54:46] starting to you're starting to salivate
[54:48] because as we speak the word, you can
[54:51] start seeing things and thoughts are
[54:53] flying in. You're already understanding
[54:56] and you're already putting things
[54:57] together. Okay. So, today we're going to
[55:00] deal or we're going to deal like I said
[55:02] with the seed. Did I change? All right.
[55:06] So, that's my drawing of a wheat seed.
[55:08] It kind of looks like that. Okay. And I
[55:12] want us to first understand the seed. So
[55:15] let's see where we are. Okay. With
[55:18] time. Uh I want to start with the most
[55:21] important
[55:22] question. Do you know that seed that is
[55:26] in your heart is an eternal seed
[55:30] and it comes from God?
[55:34] That should make you sit down and stare
[55:36] at a wall for hours
[55:40] because it's it's in itself the thought
[55:43] of it is just crazy
[55:46] because when we consider who we are and
[55:48] that God thought it fit to put that into
[55:53] here is in itself all kinds of crazy
[55:57] because we'd be the first people to
[55:58] object.
[56:00] Lord, why me?
[56:03] Right? So, here's what I want us to
[56:05] understand about the
[56:07] seed. You don't even have to worry about
[56:11] the seed because the seed has all the
[56:14] power in itself
[56:16] to do everything and produce everything
[56:19] it's meant to produce.
[56:22] The only thing is there is a
[56:23] responsibility around um what we have to
[56:27] do to help that seed go along. And even
[56:31] if you're going to struggle with it, the
[56:33] only thing you're going to struggle with
[56:35] is your self-will
[56:37] because God is going to produce things
[56:39] and bring things your way. He knows when
[56:41] the Holy Ghost should come in. He knows
[56:43] the right time the light should arrive.
[56:45] He planted it. He is the great
[56:48] excavator.
[56:50] He is the one who knows the the plan of
[56:53] it and he's going to bring things in at
[56:55] the right time. As you've seen, it's
[56:58] just our self-will that kind of works
[57:00] against it, right? But the seed in
[57:04] itself has the complete intelligence,
[57:07] what it has to do and how it has to be
[57:10] the best to flourish the bre the the
[57:12] best at the right times. Amen. So let's
[57:17] start at the very beginning which is
[57:19] before the beginning of
[57:20] beginnings. In the beginning was the
[57:23] word. The word was with God. The word
[57:26] was God. That seed in your heart was an
[57:29] attribute in the self-existing one
[57:32] before there was anything. It was an
[57:35] attribute. It was what's an attribute?
[57:37] It's a nature
[57:40] unexpressed. It's potential. It's an
[57:43] it's a an ability. So if you look at
[57:45] that seed, a wheat
[57:47] seed, in that
[57:50] seed is the potential to have roots, to
[57:54] have a stalk, to have leaves, to have
[57:58] fruit, and to bring forth many seeds at
[58:02] the end.
[58:03] This is alpha,
[58:06] when the seed is produced, it's omega.
[58:08] Amen. The omega is exactly the alpha
[58:12] because it's going to produce more
[58:13] things
[58:15] and it will have the same power and
[58:18] potential of the original seed that went
[58:20] in at the beginning. Hallelujah. He says
[58:23] I am. That's a beauty part. I am alpha
[58:25] and omega. Not even really the in
[58:28] between. The in between is going to lead
[58:31] to the omega. I am he which was which is
[58:34] which is to come. The almighty. The
[58:36] beginning and the ending. the first and
[58:38] the last. In Revelations, he says it, he
[58:41] repeats that as if you didn't get it.
[58:43] Alpha and Omega. Okay, you didn't get
[58:45] that. First and last, you didn't get
[58:47] that. The beginning and ending. It's
[58:49] like he's punching it through. What's
[58:52] going to be at the end is going to be
[58:53] me.
[58:55] Glory to God. Glory.
[58:58] So, the seed was in him. Yes. And he who
[59:02] is all knowing, omniscient, omnipotent,
[59:06] omnipresent like the prophet said,
[59:08] knowing the beginning from the ending,
[59:12] he knows when that particular attribute
[59:15] should be planted, where in time,
[59:20] which dispensation,
[59:23] which country,
[59:26] which time, which wars, which
[59:28] pestilence, which he knows because He's
[59:32] the great excavator. He's He's the one
[59:35] who knows his seed. He knows exactly
[59:37] where it is, where it should go, what it
[59:40] should produce, which conditions should
[59:42] produce exactly what he wants out of it.
[59:45] You need to come to that understanding.
[59:48] That's the time where you really
[59:50] understand your salvation is when you
[59:53] accept that he chose me.
[59:56] He chose to place that seed in me. When
[59:59] everything I think of when all in my
[1:00:01] life resists that that's the only
[1:00:05] thought that that's going to hold you.
[1:00:07] Amen. When everything crashes down upon
[1:00:10] you. That's the only anchor that you can
[1:00:14] ever have.
[1:00:16] Right? I want to pause here for a second
[1:00:19] and tell you something.
[1:00:22] We make
[1:00:24] the the assumption, a very bad
[1:00:28] assumption that life with God is meant
[1:00:32] to be a bed of roses
[1:00:35] or prayer and fasting are supposed to be
[1:00:38] quick fixes that make our lives right.
[1:00:42] That has never been the case in the
[1:00:45] Bible. The
[1:00:46] Bible is the only religious book that
[1:00:49] brags about all the bad things about
[1:00:51] God's chosen.
[1:00:56] No. No. What other religious book says,
[1:00:58] "Look at our people, how bad they were."
[1:01:00] You have this God that says, "You,
[1:01:02] Israel, I've chosen you. You commit
[1:01:04] adultery. You deserve to have the
[1:01:06] greatest anger of mine against you, but
[1:01:07] here I am taking you back." And he talks
[1:01:10] about David and his mistakes and Abraham
[1:01:12] and he lied.
[1:01:14] Which person who writes a book about his
[1:01:17] own people writes all the bad things,
[1:01:20] right? And it's it's never a case of
[1:01:22] their lives were so peaceful. Even
[1:01:24] Solomon who had 40 years of peace, it
[1:01:27] even tells us what he did. He went and
[1:01:28] brought idol worshiping wives and built
[1:01:31] up temples to them and all of that. I
[1:01:34] mean, um, you know how it is when you
[1:01:36] get to funerals, you have to say good
[1:01:38] things about the
[1:01:39] dead, right? Barely anyone tells the
[1:01:45] truth. It's like, "Oh, he was so
[1:01:47] compassionate. He's a nice guy despite
[1:01:50] all this and that." You know, and then
[1:01:52] it's like we've got to be so diplomatic.
[1:01:56] It's so easy to do a funeral for an
[1:01:58] actually nice
[1:01:59] person, you know, and it's very easy. It
[1:02:02] just flows off the tongue. But you have
[1:02:06] uh this God of ours who just tells the
[1:02:10] truth. Amen. This is who they are. They
[1:02:13] were filthy, smarty,
[1:02:16] problematic,
[1:02:18] murmuring people. But I chose them
[1:02:22] for my purpose. I predestinated them. I
[1:02:26] gave them an outcome and they fought me.
[1:02:30] They actually tried to get out of it.
[1:02:32] And I had to tell them, "Do you know who
[1:02:34] you're dealing
[1:02:35] with? I created you. I chose you. I
[1:02:39] placed you. I I love that scripture that
[1:02:42] where he says I caused kings to rise and
[1:02:44] I removed kings. I brought up empires
[1:02:46] and I destroyed
[1:02:48] empires. This is him. So hallelujah. You
[1:02:52] are going to go through things in life.
[1:02:55] Saints, you are right now in the most
[1:02:57] beautiful time. You are the ones who the
[1:02:59] things that you see they desire to see
[1:03:02] and have not seen. The things you've
[1:03:03] heard. Amen.
[1:03:06] But you've been having, let me tell you,
[1:03:09] an easier time in the last few
[1:03:13] years. It's about to get really rough.
[1:03:16] This is in and you've seen it starting
[1:03:18] to happen.
[1:03:20] You are going to see the closest people
[1:03:23] to you fall away and reject the message.
[1:03:26] It's already
[1:03:27] starting and that's going to hurt you
[1:03:30] worse than sickness and cancer. You know
[1:03:33] that you are you might even see the
[1:03:36] death of a child which is enough to
[1:03:39] break everything in your family. I have
[1:03:43] seen it happen the death of a a wife or
[1:03:45] a husband or splitting up of a church.
[1:03:49] You're going to see things that's going
[1:03:51] to whittle things
[1:03:52] down. Don't be don't feel discouraged by
[1:03:56] that. It's got to be. Amen. you. This
[1:04:00] seed has to be tested to its maximum.
[1:04:03] But the seed has the power to overcome
[1:04:06] all of that.
[1:04:08] Hallelujah. Amen. So, let's not live
[1:04:11] under an illusion that this is once we
[1:04:14] get hold of this thing. And young
[1:04:16] people, don't think that the message is
[1:04:18] just going to change you and give you
[1:04:21] this life of absolute ease and you're
[1:04:23] going to, you know, have this beautiful
[1:04:25] husband or wife and his little crawling
[1:04:28] baby, you know, on the green grass with
[1:04:30] a white picket fence and the little
[1:04:32] poodle on the side and picture
[1:04:35] perfect.
[1:04:37] Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[1:04:41] You might start off that way, but
[1:04:43] everyone knows there are bills to pay,
[1:04:45] schools to go through, trials to get
[1:04:47] through. Children all the the the thing
[1:04:50] we all face is individual self-will.
[1:04:54] From the time your child is 2 years old
[1:04:55] and you say, "Don't do that."
[1:04:57] No. Right? Everybody knows that
[1:05:00] self-will starts from there. I want to.
[1:05:03] The rule of a child is it's
[1:05:06] mine. If it's mine, it's mine. If it's
[1:05:09] yours, it's
[1:05:10] mine. That's the rule of a child, right?
[1:05:15] Give me, it's mine. And self-will starts
[1:05:18] there. And the stronger the self-will,
[1:05:20] the more difficult it is to reason with
[1:05:23] uh with a child. And we grow up with
[1:05:25] that. And depending on how you are
[1:05:27] brought up, there are parents that will
[1:05:30] try to break a child's self-will. There
[1:05:33] are some parents who will say just let
[1:05:35] him be the way he is. But self-will has
[1:05:38] to be guided because it was self-will
[1:05:40] that caused the fall in the garden of
[1:05:42] Eden. So there has to be wisdom and
[1:05:45] revelation that allows self-will to work
[1:05:48] correctly. Amen. So remember these
[1:05:51] things. This is uh this is what's ahead
[1:05:54] of you. Amen. So when we look at a seed
[1:05:58] and you just take the seed with its
[1:06:00] potential, it requires ground. Today
[1:06:03] we're talking about seed and ground. It
[1:06:05] requires ground. Water on its own, air
[1:06:09] on its own, uh ground on its own, light
[1:06:13] on its own cannot fulfill the complete
[1:06:17] nature of the seed. Amen. Right? So not
[1:06:21] let's even combine two of everything or
[1:06:26] even one uh one is not but even two
[1:06:29] let's say you can combine light and
[1:06:31] water it's still not going to be
[1:06:33] complete or water and ground it's still
[1:06:36] not going to be complete it has to take
[1:06:38] all things to work together right amen
[1:06:41] so the seed planted into the ground
[1:06:44] here's the beautiful part of it when the
[1:06:47] seed is planted into the ground what is
[1:06:49] the
[1:06:50] It's your body. It's your person.
[1:06:55] When the seed is planted into the ground
[1:06:57] at seed comes to life, the ground
[1:06:58] becomes chosen ground
[1:07:01] election. Amen.
[1:07:04] And there there in lies the struggle.
[1:07:07] Okay, that's the first part and we're
[1:07:09] going to talk about that. The seed is
[1:07:12] the word in thought form, in attribute
[1:07:16] form. The seed is the earliest form of
[1:07:19] the word
[1:07:21] right from seed it has to be spoken then
[1:07:24] it becomes word then it becomes action.
[1:07:28] So if the seed remains in seed form it's
[1:07:31] still pointless. It has to become
[1:07:34] manifested. It has to become spoken. It
[1:07:36] has to be confessed. It has that's the
[1:07:38] whole purpose of of salvation and
[1:07:40] profession of your faith. That seed has
[1:07:43] to start moving through all its cycles.
[1:07:46] Amen. Let's read uh something here from
[1:07:49] the future home. There's just one quote
[1:07:51] on this. Are you still with us? If
[1:07:55] you've got eternal life, there is only
[1:07:58] one form. That's God. And you you are an
[1:08:03] expressed attribute. See, if you're not,
[1:08:07] you're not going to be there anyhow.
[1:08:10] You're an expressed
[1:08:12] attribute. Amen. No man can come to me
[1:08:17] except my father has drawn him. That's
[1:08:19] telling us who plants the seed, right?
[1:08:21] That's how you are called by the seed
[1:08:23] being planted. And the seed starting to
[1:08:27] ask for something.
[1:08:29] Amen. Which passes away all these old
[1:08:32] things, but these things don't. So it
[1:08:35] speaks of eternity. The Holy Ghost is
[1:08:37] eternal. Then you are in eternity where
[1:08:40] you was all the time.
[1:08:44] But you've just recognized what
[1:08:46] happened. So the first thing that must
[1:08:48] happen is when that seed comes to life
[1:08:52] is you have to understand inside you
[1:08:54] that you was all the time.
[1:08:59] You have to start accepting that
[1:09:02] you just only start to recognize
[1:09:06] you was all the time. That's a hillbilly
[1:09:09] Kuckian language, right? You were all
[1:09:12] the time. There's something inside you
[1:09:14] that is eternal that comes from God from
[1:09:17] the very
[1:09:18] beginning. Saints, young
[1:09:21] people, you have to apprehend that
[1:09:23] thought.
[1:09:25] Uh I'll tell you that's my personal
[1:09:28] experience. That was the moment of my
[1:09:30] salvation in uh the message. I was grown
[1:09:34] up in the message. I went through all
[1:09:36] the the emotions. I went through the
[1:09:40] baptism. I went through the altar calls.
[1:09:44] I went through the great wonderful
[1:09:46] anointings. But I can tell you I was
[1:09:48] just living a life of a traditional
[1:09:52] religious person.
[1:09:54] And there was nothing until this grabbed
[1:09:56] me
[1:09:58] that I saw myself in him before the
[1:10:01] foundation of the world and recognized
[1:10:04] that I am no longer the son of Steven
[1:10:07] Jennifer
[1:10:08] Francis. that I come from somewhere else
[1:10:11] and where I accepted that seed to be who
[1:10:15] I am and who I want to be. Yes. And when
[1:10:19] I accepted that, I realized I don't have
[1:10:22] to I'm going to struggle and I did with
[1:10:26] many things. One of the things you
[1:10:28] struggle with is, you know, Lord, uh why
[1:10:31] do I have these
[1:10:33] gifts? You know, I I I could play sport
[1:10:36] really well. I was really good at
[1:10:39] cricket and rising up to like a
[1:10:43] professional and having the opportunity
[1:10:46] to step into our South African national
[1:10:49] squad. I and that's part of my testimony
[1:10:52] which we'll talk about
[1:10:54] tomorrow.
[1:10:56] But when you're that kind of person and
[1:10:59] you're asking God and you're confused,
[1:11:01] you think all gifts come from God. I had
[1:11:04] to understand. No, no, this gift doesn't
[1:11:06] come from God. It's just a gift. People
[1:11:08] are born with gifts, with talents. Some
[1:11:10] of us just have uh quick hand eye
[1:11:13] coordination. Some of us have musical
[1:11:16] gifts. We can sing, we can play music,
[1:11:18] we can those are musical gifts. They are
[1:11:21] only of God when they are used by the
[1:11:24] word. Other than that, gifts and
[1:11:26] callings
[1:11:27] are without repentance. Repentance means
[1:11:31] a change of mind. They are just gifts.
[1:11:35] We make the mistake thinking they are
[1:11:36] just gifts of
[1:11:38] God. You know, you see all these sports
[1:11:40] stars, they get onto the field and they
[1:11:42] cross themselves. They make prayer. It's
[1:11:44] like, you know, whichever way they're
[1:11:47] Muslim, they bow to the ground. If
[1:11:48] they're Catholics or something, they
[1:11:51] what what are they saying when they
[1:11:52] Lord, please help me score a goal. I
[1:11:54] want a hat-tick today. And and if I
[1:11:56] score the goal, I'm going to praise
[1:11:58] Jesus. No, you come out of there a
[1:12:01] narcissist glorifying yourself. and
[1:12:05] making yourself an idol to all the other
[1:12:07] people who's going to worship your name.
[1:12:09] Messi
[1:12:10] Ronaldo, you know that kind of thing.
[1:12:13] And it's just narcissism. You're
[1:12:15] bluffing yourself that you're praising
[1:12:17] God for a gift he gave you. It's
[1:12:20] nonsense. Those gifts are things of man.
[1:12:22] That's not what the seed comes to
[1:12:25] produce. Hallelujah. At the same time,
[1:12:28] the seed is not a nature that's to make
[1:12:31] you a great church person. That's right.
[1:12:35] The seed has got nothing to do with
[1:12:37] religion.
[1:12:38] Right? So, let's understand this before
[1:12:40] we get to the
[1:12:42] ground. Let's look at the dispensations
[1:12:45] of time. Right? Everyone here I know I
[1:12:48] know we love
[1:12:50] church. We were born in it. It's like
[1:12:53] second nature. If we wake up in the
[1:12:55] morning and don't pray or do something,
[1:12:56] we start feeling
[1:12:59] backsliden, right? If we don't come to
[1:13:01] church, we start feeling backsliden. We
[1:13:03] we get regret. We feel convicted. We
[1:13:07] call it convicted. Is it really the Holy
[1:13:10] Ghost convicting you or you just feeling
[1:13:12] guilt about not doing something you are
[1:13:14] religious about? How did it start? The
[1:13:18] Garden of Eden. There was no
[1:13:20] church. There was no Bible. There were
[1:13:23] no books. There was no prayer. There was
[1:13:27] no service. There was no opening in
[1:13:29] prayer, closing in prayer, take up the
[1:13:31] offering, deacons, no pastors, no song
[1:13:34] leaders, no hymns. So what did Adam do?
[1:13:39] Can you even imagine the human
[1:13:40] condition? Can you even imagine serving
[1:13:43] God without church? Do you have an idea
[1:13:45] of how to do that?
[1:13:47] Some people who did the stay at home and
[1:13:49] listen to tapes thing thought that's a
[1:13:52] way some people and then you might be
[1:13:55] sitting so you might be sitting there
[1:13:56] thinking okay so what do I do? Do I
[1:13:59] leave church and do this on my own? No,
[1:14:02] not today. You cannot do that today. But
[1:14:06] I'm trying to show you where we are in
[1:14:09] our mentality
[1:14:10] when a life with God was independent of
[1:14:14] religion. Brother Bham calls that the
[1:14:16] conscience age which lasted from Adam to
[1:14:20] Abraham. There was no church. How did
[1:14:23] Enoch reach rapture material without
[1:14:26] church?
[1:14:28] Without religion, without fasting,
[1:14:30] without prayer, without sacrifice,
[1:14:32] sacrifices hadn't even come in yet.
[1:14:34] Yeah, I know. U Abel offered the lamb,
[1:14:38] but there was no law for sacrifice.
[1:14:41] There was no did Enoch really have to
[1:14:44] sacrifice a lamb. It only tells us about
[1:14:45] Abel.
[1:14:47] So how do the saints of that time
[1:14:49] including Noah, in fact, the Bible tells
[1:14:52] us Noah found grace in the eyes of God
[1:14:54] because he kept his lineage straight.
[1:14:59] He just did not mix with the false seed
[1:15:01] of Cain. And he yet we know the guy
[1:15:04] ended up being a drunkard.
[1:15:08] Noah was a drunkard. He enjoyed his
[1:15:10] wine. First thing he did when he got
[1:15:12] over on the on the on the next earth
[1:15:16] started planting grapes and then enjoyed
[1:15:19] his wine. And not just enjoyed his wine,
[1:15:21] he drank till he was
[1:15:25] unconscious. These are the heroes of the
[1:15:27] faith.
[1:15:29] How much uh how much forgiveness would
[1:15:32] you have had for brother Noah?
[1:15:37] Yeah, that's my point to step in here
[1:15:41] with I know we speak a lot because we
[1:15:44] learn so much from legalism and we we
[1:15:46] don't like legalism. But here's the
[1:15:48] truth. There is nothing wrong with the
[1:15:51] law. The law is perfect. There's nothing
[1:15:55] wrong with pointing out sin for what it
[1:15:57] is. Sin is sin. Wrong is wrong. There's
[1:16:01] nothing wrong with tell you you should
[1:16:02] not commit fornication. You should not
[1:16:04] commit adultery. You should not kill.
[1:16:06] You should not steal. That is the truth.
[1:16:08] You should not be doing it. Putting it
[1:16:10] plainly, you may not be a sinner for
[1:16:12] doing it, but you are a crazy
[1:16:15] fool. I'd like to say it that way.
[1:16:18] You're silly, stupid. You're going to
[1:16:19] mess up your life. We're all fools in
[1:16:22] some
[1:16:23] way. But that's the way it should be
[1:16:25] taught. The issue when it becomes
[1:16:27] legalism is how you police the law.
[1:16:31] Exactly. Because policing the law, you
[1:16:34] see when you have a law, the law tells
[1:16:36] you this is wrong. And Paul says when I
[1:16:39] was without the law, I was I was better
[1:16:41] off. Once the law came in, it took me
[1:16:43] prisoner and made me worse than ever
[1:16:45] before. He says I was actually happier
[1:16:47] without the law. When the law came in,
[1:16:49] and he said the law is great, right?
[1:16:52] It's it's the truth. But once the law
[1:16:54] came in, it made me prisoner. Why?
[1:16:56] Because when the law is made known to
[1:16:58] you and you know what is wrong and you
[1:17:00] transgress it, you become a
[1:17:01] transgressor.
[1:17:03] Before you know the law, you're not a
[1:17:05] transgressor because you were ignorant
[1:17:06] of the truth. Once you are a
[1:17:09] transgressor, then you have to pay the
[1:17:11] judgment for being a transgressor.
[1:17:14] Now the the thing is how do we pass
[1:17:16] judgment for the
[1:17:18] transgression? That's the part where we
[1:17:20] damage each other.
[1:17:22] legalism really in the message where it
[1:17:25] was perverted is the policing of the
[1:17:28] law. So how this works in the courts of
[1:17:30] law is if you transgress the police
[1:17:34] arrest you you get a an advocate on your
[1:17:38] behalf but there is a prosecutor. The
[1:17:41] prosecutor knows the law and he's the
[1:17:43] one who brings you before the judge.
[1:17:45] Who's the judge? And here's the problem
[1:17:47] with message people. We all think to
[1:17:50] judge is to hand out punishment. The
[1:17:53] judge's job is to check how much of
[1:17:55] mercy to hand out.
[1:17:59] Because the prosecutor is is going for
[1:18:01] the full judgment. He's like, "He
[1:18:04] murdered someone. He deserves the death
[1:18:06] penalty." The advocate is going to come
[1:18:09] and say, "But it wasn't intentional or
[1:18:12] it wasn't premeditated. It was
[1:18:14] accidental. Maybe there's manslaughter.
[1:18:17] maybe it wasn't homicide. Uh he's going
[1:18:20] to argue from your point. He's going to
[1:18:21] say, "Well, there was a little bit of
[1:18:23] mental instability." He's saying he's
[1:18:25] going to say, "Judge, uh he had a a
[1:18:28] problem in his family." So the
[1:18:29] prosecutor is going to go full penalty.
[1:18:32] The advocate is on your behalf is going
[1:18:34] to appeal for your intentions, right?
[1:18:37] And then the judge is going to look at
[1:18:39] the prosecutor's side and the advocate
[1:18:42] side and say, "Okay, I understand." So
[1:18:45] instead of death penalty, we can reduce
[1:18:47] that to 20 years in prison. But then I
[1:18:50] can see how contrite the man is. He's
[1:18:52] really asking for forgiveness. And the
[1:18:54] judge is saying, I can drop that another
[1:18:56] 5 years. And then we look at some of the
[1:18:58] details and some of the prosecutors, you
[1:19:01] can see the prosecutor, he's just his
[1:19:02] nature. He just really wants to to take
[1:19:05] you out from at the knees. He's saying,
[1:19:07] "No, there's a some of the evidence was
[1:19:09] misconstrued. He'll drop that a little
[1:19:10] bit more." And he'll say, "Okay, 10
[1:19:12] years." What was the judge doing?
[1:19:14] Handing out grace where you were
[1:19:18] actually guilty. That's what's missing
[1:19:20] from the message. Message people, not
[1:19:23] the message
[1:19:24] is they misunderstand what judgment is.
[1:19:27] Judgment is about how much grace to give
[1:19:31] when there is an actual transgression.
[1:19:35] That's what you need to bear in mind
[1:19:36] when you're dealing with your children,
[1:19:38] when you're dealing with husband and
[1:19:40] wife. Of course, everyone breaks a law.
[1:19:43] All of us break a law. We we do wrong
[1:19:45] things. We transgress against one
[1:19:47] another. And then obviously the person
[1:19:50] who says, "I'm so sorry," wants full
[1:19:52] pardon.
[1:19:54] You know, like my son came up to me and
[1:19:57] that time we, you know, I told him not
[1:19:59] to do something and he came to me and he
[1:20:01] thought I I I say to them, maximum
[1:20:04] punishment in this house is if you lie
[1:20:06] to me. Lies is demonology.
[1:20:10] Do not lie. Tell the truth and things
[1:20:13] are good with us and uh everything is
[1:20:16] about the truth about transparency in
[1:20:18] our hearts. Do not lie because once you
[1:20:20] lie that's what once you cover things up
[1:20:22] once you have deceit you head over into
[1:20:24] demonology and you attach those spurs to
[1:20:26] you. So that's a big thing in our home.
[1:20:29] So my son comes running up to me. Dad
[1:20:31] I'm so sorry I did this wrong thing. Uh
[1:20:33] you told me not to do it. I'm so sorry.
[1:20:35] You know um I'm I'm ready. Um, I'm
[1:20:39] really sorry about it. I hope you can
[1:20:40] forgive me. I said, okay, thank you,
[1:20:42] son, for telling me the truth. You're
[1:20:43] grounded for 2
[1:20:45] weeks. He said, "But I told the truth."
[1:20:47] I said, "Yeah, you did tell the truth.
[1:20:50] I'm so proud of you for that, but you
[1:20:51] also did something wrong. So, you have
[1:20:53] to accept some punishment for it. I
[1:20:56] can't let you get away, but hey, I love
[1:20:58] you for telling me the truth. Good
[1:21:00] going. But you're still grounded for 2
[1:21:02] weeks, right?" He looked at me. He
[1:21:05] processed it. You can see his wires
[1:21:07] going across a little bit. And then he
[1:21:09] said, "Okay, no, I can deal with this."
[1:21:12] But there must be an understanding that
[1:21:14] when there's a transgression, there has
[1:21:16] to be something to pay, right? But if
[1:21:20] you tell the truth, if you're honest, if
[1:21:21] you're contrite, if you're repentant,
[1:21:25] you're going to be rewarded. The the
[1:21:27] punishment is going to be lessened.
[1:21:29] That's what we need to learn so we can
[1:21:31] have the freedom to come ask
[1:21:32] forgiveness. Amen. very important to
[1:21:35] understand there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:38] the
[1:21:39] law. It's right to know what is right to
[1:21:43] do and it we have to point out when
[1:21:46] things are wrong. So just because we
[1:21:48] don't like legalism does not mean we
[1:21:50] become liberal and don't worry you can
[1:21:52] do whatever you want. We're just going
[1:21:54] to forgive you. You must accept there is
[1:21:56] some portion I have to pay because
[1:22:00] that's going to clean my spirit out.
[1:22:02] Amen. But when you have a group of
[1:22:04] people and a church with revelation,
[1:22:06] they're going to lead you into the right
[1:22:08] way. So coming back to the
[1:22:11] seed, that seed has to be nurtured.
[1:22:14] Amen. And God has chosen the ground for
[1:22:17] it. Amen. You are in eternity where you
[1:22:21] was all that time, but you've just
[1:22:22] recognized what happened. Right? So we
[1:22:24] move from the conscience age and then
[1:22:27] God brings in the law after Abraham.
[1:22:30] brings in the law of circumcision from
[1:22:32] here on. I got to take this off. It's
[1:22:34] getting
[1:22:35] warm. Ste, I'm getting
[1:22:40] comfortable. Okay. So, brings in the
[1:22:43] law. Now, from Adam, are you still with
[1:22:46] me? From Adam to Christ, brother Brandon
[1:22:49] calls that the dispensation of the
[1:22:51] father. And under the dispensation of
[1:22:54] the father, why is it father?
[1:22:57] Invisible God, God above the people, God
[1:23:00] who cannot be seen. If you see him, you
[1:23:03] die. Right? He cannot be touched. You
[1:23:06] cannot come up to the mountain. All the
[1:23:08] laws because this is this is the father.
[1:23:11] Father is working is a relationship.
[1:23:13] Father is not a name of God like father,
[1:23:16] son, holy ghost. They thought they are
[1:23:18] names or a different person. Father is a
[1:23:20] is an an English word which which
[1:23:24] reflects a relationship to man. Amen. So
[1:23:27] why is he father? Because his
[1:23:29] relationship to me is
[1:23:31] instruction and providing a purpose.
[1:23:35] He's a father deals with children. Got
[1:23:38] it right? So in other words, from Adam
[1:23:41] to Christ, they were all
[1:23:43] children. Humans were children. They
[1:23:46] were infant in mindset. They were uh
[1:23:50] from Adam all the way to Abraham. As as
[1:23:53] weird as it sounds, they were like
[1:23:55] infants. From Abraham all the way to
[1:23:57] Christ, they were like teenagers because
[1:23:59] now it comes up with thou shalt not.
[1:24:01] Thou shalt and if you do, there's going
[1:24:04] to be punishment. You're not dealing
[1:24:06] with God's no longer dealing with them
[1:24:07] by conscience. Now he's giving you a
[1:24:09] law. He's he's correcting the nature of
[1:24:12] the flesh. You shall not kill. You shall
[1:24:14] love the Lord your God with all your
[1:24:16] heart, with all your soul. You shall not
[1:24:17] commit adultery. You shall not covet.
[1:24:19] Honor your father and your mother. You
[1:24:21] shall keep the Sabbath. Then
[1:24:22] Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy, right? Two
[1:24:24] laws. If you do this, you'll be blessed.
[1:24:27] If you do not keep it, you'll be cursed.
[1:24:30] He's dealing with
[1:24:31] teenagers. Do you see that between
[1:24:33] father and children, there's still
[1:24:35] distance, it's not really a close
[1:24:37] relationship,
[1:24:39] right? And it's the thing. A lot of
[1:24:41] people take the message and they want a
[1:24:43] distant relationship, because it feels
[1:24:45] safe,
[1:24:47] right? Just keep instructing me. You
[1:24:50] tell me what to do. You correct me. You
[1:24:53] And that kind of relationship with God
[1:24:55] is not intimate. It's not close.
[1:24:57] And if it was meant to be that way, he
[1:24:59] wouldn't have brought in a son of man
[1:25:01] ministry. The son of man ministry ended
[1:25:03] the father dispensation. It was God
[1:25:07] moving from the invisible to Emmanuel.
[1:25:10] God with us. No longer God above. God
[1:25:14] invisible. God cannot be touched. God
[1:25:16] cannot be seen. Now he's God with us in
[1:25:19] the flesh without controversy. We have
[1:25:22] seen God in the flesh. Amen. They could
[1:25:25] touch him. They could punch him. They
[1:25:28] could spit on him. They could crucify
[1:25:30] him. That was the same God that was the
[1:25:33] pillar of fire in the time of Moses. But
[1:25:36] what changed? The relationship changed.
[1:25:39] What was son of man? Brother. He came to
[1:25:43] bring many brothers like unto himself.
[1:25:47] But that's that's a son of man ministry.
[1:25:49] God with us. Then he leaves and becomes
[1:25:54] the Holy Ghost which is the grace
[1:25:56] dispensation. Now what is
[1:26:00] grace? Grace is giving you space to make
[1:26:05] your mistakes and learn.
[1:26:08] Look at the difference between Moses the
[1:26:10] Lord dispensation and grace. That's what
[1:26:14] grace is. Grace is telling you, everyone
[1:26:16] sings about grace and prays about grace.
[1:26:19] Grace is actually telling you, I know
[1:26:21] you're a transgressor,
[1:26:24] but I'm giving you space to improve.
[1:26:28] How did Christ do that? Christ said, I
[1:26:30] do not come to do away with the law. I
[1:26:32] come to magnify the law. So he says, if
[1:26:36] Moses said to you, thou shalt not kill.
[1:26:39] I say unto you, if you're angry with
[1:26:41] your brother without a cause, you have
[1:26:42] killed already. So there were the
[1:26:45] Pharisees saying, we did not kill
[1:26:47] anyone. We are perfect. We keep the law.
[1:26:50] Christ came and said, "No, as long as
[1:26:52] you think about doing it, you're a
[1:26:54] transgressor." Why did it? Now, if you
[1:26:56] think about legalism, that would be like
[1:26:58] the height of legalism. Like who's going
[1:27:01] to In other words, Christ saying the way
[1:27:04] I'm teaching you, none of you are going
[1:27:06] to say you can do this by works.
[1:27:09] Exactly. Nobody can do this by works. In
[1:27:12] other words, he magnified the Lord to
[1:27:13] make it impossible to be self-righteous.
[1:27:17] I mean to say Moses said, "You shall not
[1:27:20] commit adultery, but I say to you, if
[1:27:22] you lust after a woman, if you think
[1:27:25] about it, you are guilty as if you
[1:27:27] committed the act." Right? It was like
[1:27:30] the disciples were saying, "Well, which
[1:27:32] one of us are going to pass that one?"
[1:27:34] You know, then he spoke about honoring
[1:27:37] your father and mother. You took that
[1:27:39] law and you said, "Well, once a year I
[1:27:40] come and give a sacrifice and honor my
[1:27:42] father and mother." He says, "No, that's
[1:27:44] not how it works, right? You missed the
[1:27:47] whole law. You spoke about keeping the
[1:27:49] Sabbath. What did they do with the
[1:27:50] Sabbath? They took the Sabbath and poor
[1:27:53] guy dies. the the cow or donkey falls in
[1:27:56] the ditch and no I'm not supposed to
[1:27:58] sweat on the Sabbath so let it die
[1:28:02] you know it's like in the message I
[1:28:04] remember in Durban he had a a brother
[1:28:08] and sister in a car accident and uh the
[1:28:10] brother is behind the wheel he's
[1:28:12] unconscious there's like fuel leaking
[1:28:14] out the car and there's a sister there
[1:28:17] and she some she needs someone to get
[1:28:18] out the car and here's the message
[1:28:20] brother say no we're not allowed to
[1:28:21] touch a sister
[1:28:24] But it's okay for the unbelieving
[1:28:26] paramedic to touch the sister. Like,
[1:28:31] you become insane.
[1:28:35] Like, what would you do if the sister is
[1:28:37] drowning? I'm not allowed to touch her.
[1:28:41] That's foolish.
[1:28:43] That's the Lord did not come to make you
[1:28:45] foolish. You dive in there and try to
[1:28:48] save her. You get her out of the car. It
[1:28:49] doesn't matter even if her husband is
[1:28:51] there. That guy's going to forgive you.
[1:28:52] Trust me.
[1:28:59] This is the this is my point. It's these
[1:29:01] things are simple,
[1:29:04] right? I mean, you have the same prophet
[1:29:06] who who tells you there's a sister who's
[1:29:09] doing wrong. He's talking to a brother.
[1:29:11] Take your sister by the hand. Sit her
[1:29:13] down. Talk to her. Sister,
[1:29:15] dear. The same prophet. Amen. So
[1:29:19] different. How did we get to these
[1:29:21] self-righteous message people who became
[1:29:24] so foolish?
[1:29:26] It's exactly Pharisee
[1:29:30] where he's the Lord of the Sabbath and
[1:29:32] they're telling him how to handle the
[1:29:34] Sabbath.
[1:29:35] We've noticed your disciples eat food
[1:29:38] without washing
[1:29:41] hands. We wash hands and the pots. We
[1:29:44] are super clean.
[1:29:47] He looked at them and said, "I am Lord
[1:29:49] of the Sabbath." We plucked corn on the
[1:29:52] Sabbath day because we were hungry.
[1:29:57] We needed to eat. What is more important
[1:29:59] to die on the Sabbath day from hunger?
[1:30:04] It's like it's like it's it's common
[1:30:05] sense. You should be able to do that. So
[1:30:09] grace made the law impossible to live by
[1:30:14] so that everyone becomes equal. And when
[1:30:18] everyone is equal, everyone needs grace.
[1:30:21] You see the dispensation? So what's
[1:30:23] happening all the time is God is moving
[1:30:25] closer. He went from invisible father
[1:30:27] who could not be touched, could not have
[1:30:28] a relationship with him only instruction
[1:30:30] only lord to a brother who is among you
[1:30:33] who suffers with you who bears your
[1:30:34] iniquities together son of man ministry
[1:30:37] dies on the cross to the holy ghost who
[1:30:39] now comes upon you to help you suppress
[1:30:42] those very spirited natures so you can
[1:30:44] believe the word he's telling you you
[1:30:46] have ignorance you don't know everything
[1:30:48] they started off grace uh uh
[1:30:51] dispensation without church learning
[1:30:53] church making things up on the go
[1:30:56] learning by the Holy Ghost, dealing with
[1:30:58] different Gentile nations and different
[1:31:00] laws and traditions. Amen. They needed
[1:31:03] grace. They were Gentiles. They were
[1:31:06] struggling. These people had a a Mars
[1:31:10] Hill where they're going up and they've
[1:31:12] got a temple for the unknown god because
[1:31:14] the Greeks had this thing, you know, all
[1:31:16] the gods. We have to worship all of them
[1:31:19] because and if we don't worship one of
[1:31:21] them, they're going to get upset with us
[1:31:22] and cause something in our life. So we
[1:31:24] have the unknown god for the god just in
[1:31:26] case we forgot who you were or didn't
[1:31:28] know who you were. We don't want to
[1:31:29] bring out your anger upon us. Paul says
[1:31:32] that unknown god I'm going to tell you
[1:31:34] who he is. Amen.
[1:31:36] Praise be to God. That's where you come
[1:31:38] from. That's who we were. We were these
[1:31:41] Gentiles who needed grace because we
[1:31:43] were so filled with ignorance. And with
[1:31:46] ignorance we were going to mess up all
[1:31:48] the time. Yeah. And then another son of
[1:31:53] man ministry at the end of the age of
[1:31:55] grace. God with us again.
[1:32:00] Amen. The coming of the Lord. And what
[1:32:02] does a son of man ministry do? It
[1:32:04] changes a dispensation.
[1:32:07] Right? Changing from grace to love. The
[1:32:11] capstone.
[1:32:13] Love is the closest relationship that we
[1:32:16] know. Love. and and you're no longer
[1:32:18] described as father to children or
[1:32:21] brother to brother. It is now husband to
[1:32:24] wife. There is no relationship in the
[1:32:27] world that we know of that is closer
[1:32:29] than husband and wife. There is no other
[1:32:32] relationship we know that where they
[1:32:34] they the two can be one flesh.
[1:32:37] That is the relationship God always
[1:32:39] wanted with man.
[1:32:42] One flesh,
[1:32:44] union, united. That's what he wanted. So
[1:32:48] we in the message who want God to be
[1:32:50] distant.
[1:32:53] That means you want to live by
[1:32:54] instruction. You want to live by law or
[1:32:57] you desire, you're so thrilled with the
[1:32:59] Holy Ghost who gives you gifts and gives
[1:33:02] you anointing. That's still living under
[1:33:05] grace. You're actually admitting, I'm
[1:33:07] just want to I want to have the ability
[1:33:09] to transgress and just have pardon and
[1:33:11] continuously have space.
[1:33:14] But you've got to move past that. When
[1:33:16] you come to love, love coverth a
[1:33:18] multitude of sin. What is love? It's not
[1:33:22] about pushing the sin under the rug.
[1:33:25] When it says love coverth a multitude of
[1:33:27] sin, it actually means love continues
[1:33:29] and loves you even for your faults.
[1:33:33] Because even your faults become
[1:33:35] valuable.
[1:33:37] You can never feel that way under grace.
[1:33:39] This is why the capstone ministry is so
[1:33:42] important to us today. As the bride of
[1:33:43] Christ, he chose you for your faults.
[1:33:47] Your faults are actually going to work
[1:33:49] in favor of the word.
[1:33:54] That's where we have come to and to
[1:33:56] understand the chosen ground. So let's
[1:33:58] go to um oh did I pass this already?
[1:34:02] See, you were the stone in the sea. You
[1:34:04] were made for an eternal purpose because
[1:34:07] um you was the manifestation of an
[1:34:10] attribute that was in God. That thought
[1:34:12] of you and expressed you and he made
[1:34:15] earth
[1:34:18] to take you out of to make you a human
[1:34:20] being and sin come along and pervert it.
[1:34:23] So obviously this is the planet he's
[1:34:25] speaking of. But there is an earth where
[1:34:27] the seed is going to be planted.
[1:34:30] Do you not think he
[1:34:32] knew when you were going to be born in
[1:34:35] what particular time? Now let's let me
[1:34:38] make you understand this. This is this
[1:34:40] is what I mean. My salvation. This is
[1:34:42] how I understood salvation. The
[1:34:44] attribute of God that was in his in him
[1:34:48] before the foundation of the world was
[1:34:49] not called Alistister.
[1:34:54] It was his name. Amen. That was not Al
[1:34:58] Alistister.
[1:35:00] But God knew in the right time after his
[1:35:04] prophet William Brham during some part
[1:35:08] of time in South Africa there would be
[1:35:11] this Indian family and their ancestors
[1:35:14] would come through all the whatever
[1:35:15] histories and land up in this town of
[1:35:18] Newcastle and there would be these group
[1:35:20] of
[1:35:21] people and in there there would be this
[1:35:24] pastor's
[1:35:26] family and they would have these
[1:35:28] qualities
[1:35:29] and he could see a vessel that could
[1:35:33] meet the possibility and the criterion
[1:35:35] of this particular attribute.
[1:35:39] So he could predestinate by fornowledge.
[1:35:42] That's what he said.
[1:35:44] Once he plants that seed or that seed
[1:35:47] becomes he so if he's seen it the seed
[1:35:50] is planted
[1:35:51] it's waiting for the life to come in
[1:35:55] because once you recognize the word the
[1:35:57] seed starts to to grow right but he's
[1:36:01] already planted it because he's before
[1:36:03] you even knew it he already chose the
[1:36:05] time the vessel which is why when you're
[1:36:08] growing up as a child because you're
[1:36:10] already chosen brother Bam said no man
[1:36:13] saw sought God. No man has the ability
[1:36:16] to seek for God. You are all most of our
[1:36:19] testimonies, you know, I was searching
[1:36:21] for God. I was searching for God. He
[1:36:22] says, no, he was brooding over you
[1:36:26] because he chose that body. He chose
[1:36:28] that vessel.
[1:36:29] Yes. Unfortunately, the uncomfortable
[1:36:32] life that you had was because he was
[1:36:33] brooding. You just could not be
[1:36:35] satisfied with every moment because he's
[1:36:38] brooding. He's just brooding. He's
[1:36:39] waiting like the spirit of God moving
[1:36:41] upon the face of the waters in the
[1:36:42] beginning of the earth. He's brooding.
[1:36:45] So whatever you try and sin and you're
[1:36:47] just not happy. You try and do your own
[1:36:49] thing and you're just not happy because
[1:36:50] he's brooding. He knows the time that
[1:36:53] that seed should ignite. Amen. That's
[1:36:55] what he was doing. But he saw your place
[1:36:58] and time before the foundation of the
[1:37:01] world. And there was a specific unique
[1:37:04] attribute to your vessel
[1:37:08] which no one can tell you about which
[1:37:11] you can't compare yourself to another
[1:37:13] one. He actually knew where you would
[1:37:16] be. He even knows whether you would
[1:37:18] whether you should die, whether you
[1:37:21] should fall sick. He knew exactly each
[1:37:23] moment. And that seed is depending on
[1:37:26] every single condition because he
[1:37:29] appointed it to be so. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] That's what you have to settle in your
[1:37:34] heart. When you do, you have peace.
[1:37:36] Amen. That
[1:37:38] attribute comes from the logos, the gene
[1:37:41] of your father. Brother says the thought
[1:37:45] of you and expressed you and he made
[1:37:47] earth to take you. The last part of that
[1:37:50] you come anyhow, but you was lost with
[1:37:52] the world. So he come and redeemed you.
[1:37:56] this expressed attribute and also
[1:37:59] redeems this earth by the same way not
[1:38:03] just the planet but the body. So because
[1:38:07] of the seed the the body becomes adopted
[1:38:12] the vessel the unworthy thing the thing
[1:38:16] with all the messed up genetics the
[1:38:18] thing with all the virus and bacteria
[1:38:20] and sinful natures and things passed
[1:38:23] down from from your from your parents.
[1:38:27] All the abilities in your body which
[1:38:29] come with all the negative things of
[1:38:31] your very nature. your race, your
[1:38:33] culture, your country, your town,
[1:38:36] whatever your teachers told you with all
[1:38:38] that,
[1:38:41] it adopts that ground.
[1:38:45] You know when Job says, I want us to
[1:38:47] appreciate this. When Job says, I look
[1:38:49] at a flower, it dies, the flower rises
[1:38:52] again. He says, if Job dies, will Job
[1:38:56] rise again? That when he says, if a man
[1:38:58] die, will he rise again? So I can
[1:39:01] imagine Job was probably thinking if I
[1:39:04] die do I come back like the same person?
[1:39:07] Is it this person or do I come back in
[1:39:08] another body? How is this working? And
[1:39:12] then we find out by grace and brother
[1:39:15] Maram actually went beyond the curtain
[1:39:17] of time and saw
[1:39:21] this same person rises again. Amen. This
[1:39:25] same person comes up. This person who
[1:39:27] came by permissive will, the seed turns
[1:39:29] that permissive will into perfect will.
[1:39:32] That's how powerful this is. It adopts
[1:39:34] the ground. Glory. Amen.
[1:39:39] Praise be to God. I love him, saints.
[1:39:43] And he says then, see, he redeems this
[1:39:47] earth by the same way. Then his purpose
[1:39:50] rolls on.
[1:39:52] The plant begins to grow. Oh,
[1:39:54] hallelujah. Oh, that does me so much
[1:39:57] good. Think of just what lays ahead from
[1:40:01] there on. It's the trials of the plant.
[1:40:04] Amen.
[1:40:05] Let's go to the next part, which is the
[1:40:08] ground. There's that seed stuck in the
[1:40:11] ground. The ground is your body.
[1:40:15] Amen. You come to all the trials, but
[1:40:18] the ground is chosen ground because he
[1:40:20] forneew it. Yes. Amen. Do you believe
[1:40:23] that?
[1:40:24] All right. So, we're going to close with
[1:40:27] this thought, but you're going to
[1:40:28] appreciate a whole lot about yourself
[1:40:32] because you're going to see yourself
[1:40:33] through God's eyes.
[1:40:36] Let's be honest, okay? We are the you
[1:40:39] can you can fight against people who
[1:40:41] judge you falsely.
[1:40:44] You get angry, right? Don't you with
[1:40:47] people who judge you? This new
[1:40:49] generation, don't be judgy.
[1:40:52] You're so judgy, you know. No judgment.
[1:40:57] No. But tell the truth. You are the
[1:41:01] greatest judge of yourself.
[1:41:04] You can get upset with everyone else who
[1:41:06] judges you. You're the one who condemns
[1:41:08] yourself the most. Nobody else is worse
[1:41:11] of a judge than you are. How do you
[1:41:13] know? You're the one who feels guilty.
[1:41:16] You're the one who feels like you need
[1:41:18] to be punished. You're the one who makes
[1:41:20] you lose sleep about it.
[1:41:24] It's your fault. You are the biggest
[1:41:26] judge of herself. You're so judgy about
[1:41:29] yourself, you even get
[1:41:32] constipated. Nobody else makes you
[1:41:35] constipated. You do it. Or you get
[1:41:37] irritable bowel syndrome. You give
[1:41:40] yourself anxiety. You give yourself
[1:41:44] depression. Nobody else does it to you.
[1:41:47] It's you. You are the worst judge you've
[1:41:50] ever met.
[1:41:52] Amen. You spend the time in the mirror
[1:41:55] making sure you leave
[1:41:58] the and you walk around and you're like
[1:42:00] adjusting yourself all the time.
[1:42:02] Nobody's even looking at
[1:42:03] you. They're not even interested. The
[1:42:06] one strand is standing up. They don't
[1:42:08] even notice it. You're like
[1:42:14] hairspray. Admit it. You are your worst
[1:42:17] judge.
[1:42:19] You are the one that makes you feel
[1:42:21] guilty. Not even God does that.
[1:42:26] Now, here's the thing about this this
[1:42:28] body, this ground that you have, it
[1:42:31] carries all the nutrients and
[1:42:34] characteristics to bring that chosen
[1:42:37] seed to its full potential.
[1:42:41] Wow. That you have to settle. How many
[1:42:45] how many farmers here agricultural
[1:42:47] farming? Okay. Plant seed. You
[1:42:51] understand seed. You understand ground.
[1:42:54] What's in that
[1:42:55] ground?
[1:42:57] Bacteria,
[1:42:59] filth,
[1:43:01] mold,
[1:43:02] worms, creatures of the
[1:43:07] dark. And then you even put animal
[1:43:12] excrement.
[1:43:16] We call it
[1:43:17] fertilizer. We add more stinky stuff to
[1:43:20] it because it makes the seed flourish.
[1:43:25] This is the truth.
[1:43:28] This is what the seed actually needs.
[1:43:30] And God knew all your mistakes, all your
[1:43:35] inadequacies, all your worms and your
[1:43:38] filth and your bacteria and the troubles
[1:43:40] you're going to have with life. Yes.
[1:43:43] Hallelujah. Let me let me tell you let
[1:43:45] me just give you one you know from a
[1:43:47] from a personal
[1:43:48] perspective. If you are a good musician
[1:43:51] or a good singer you are a rightbrain
[1:43:53] person means you are creative. You are
[1:43:57] passionate. You have you are
[1:44:01] artistic. You are
[1:44:04] dangerous. You are dangerous because you
[1:44:07] are you work on the side of sensuality.
[1:44:11] There's nothing wrong with it. You just
[1:44:12] need to know it's dangerous. You are
[1:44:14] going to be an immediate target like
[1:44:17] those beautiful children standing here.
[1:44:19] I'm going to pray for you.
[1:44:24] Because when you come up here in front
[1:44:27] with gifts, you become target number
[1:44:32] one. Because either that gift is going
[1:44:34] to be used to glorify God or to glorify
[1:44:37] self.
[1:44:39] It is going to be your trial from now
[1:44:41] till the time you're an adult. The only
[1:44:44] way to temper that thing is by the word
[1:44:48] to put your gift under subjection of the
[1:44:50] word to seek his face day and night to
[1:44:52] remain humble. Because every human has
[1:44:55] the the need to become relevant,
[1:45:00] noticed, powerful, and respected. It's
[1:45:04] called narcissism.
[1:45:05] It's called loving yourself. It's called
[1:45:07] loving your
[1:45:08] reflection. And yet God knows that.
[1:45:11] That's right. And God knows you were
[1:45:13] going to have this gift and knows you
[1:45:16] needed to learn how to handle it
[1:45:20] correctly and how it was going to lead
[1:45:22] you into trouble. If you're a good
[1:45:25] singer, you are going to be tempted to
[1:45:27] make a recording to cut an LP or an
[1:45:30] album or whatever it is that that you
[1:45:33] want to be a star. You could be on
[1:45:35] Something's Got
[1:45:37] Talent, you know, something or the
[1:45:40] other. Everyone's got talent nowadays.
[1:45:43] Britain and America and Poland and
[1:45:46] Greece and whatever. I don't know. But
[1:45:48] you'll be on something. You want to be
[1:45:49] on something's got talent or idols or
[1:45:51] something. And then in the church,
[1:45:53] people are going to love your gift. Look
[1:45:55] at how dangerous it is. People are going
[1:45:57] to request for you to sing a song.
[1:46:00] You are either going to
[1:46:02] think um Lord help me because this
[1:46:06] person has
[1:46:08] uh really loves that song and it touches
[1:46:10] their soul or you're going to be feeling
[1:46:12] proud that oh they love the way I sing.
[1:46:16] It's such a razor's edge.
[1:46:19] But hey, that's your worms. That's your
[1:46:22] bacteria. It's yours to deal with. some
[1:46:24] other person who, like brother Ram says,
[1:46:26] can't hold a tune in a coal bucket does
[1:46:29] is never going to fight that battle.
[1:46:32] That's yours. It's all yours. You're
[1:46:35] gifted. You got to deal with it. He
[1:46:37] placed a seed in your heart and that
[1:46:38] seed is going to need you to struggle
[1:46:41] with that gift because it's going to put
[1:46:44] potential in that seed as it grows to
[1:46:46] create wisdom to bring forth a life. And
[1:46:49] the seed that's in you is the only power
[1:46:53] to destroy those things or overcome or
[1:46:56] have the victory over those things in
[1:46:58] your life. Your victory is going to be
[1:47:00] nobody else's.
[1:47:03] Nobody else can have what you have, the
[1:47:06] trials that you have. That so even what
[1:47:08] I'm saying is, you know, and and this is
[1:47:11] what I try to do. Let's say there's a
[1:47:13] brother in my church who was a drug
[1:47:16] addict and he was a and I have some of
[1:47:20] them who've come out of it and they have
[1:47:22] got this incredible testimony. So when I
[1:47:24] go to counsel another young man who who
[1:47:27] has been in drugs, I take this brother
[1:47:29] with me because I don't know his
[1:47:32] attribute. He's the only one who's the
[1:47:35] master of that attribute. I actually do
[1:47:38] not know what it is like to be
[1:47:39] chemically dependent on anything. How am
[1:47:41] I going to counsel this fell? How am I
[1:47:44] going to tell him what he's going to go
[1:47:45] through? How am I going to This is why
[1:47:47] we are a body.
[1:47:49] If you're a person who's been through a
[1:47:51] divorce, you're the only person who is
[1:47:54] the master of it. Cuz you know what it's
[1:47:57] like to have mom and dad separated, what
[1:47:59] it is to go through children and go
[1:48:01] through uh what do you call it? What do
[1:48:04] they fight for? Custody. Custody
[1:48:06] battles. You know what it's like to deal
[1:48:09] with alimony and and maintenance and
[1:48:12] money and struggles. Those of you who've
[1:48:15] been through maybe fornication in your
[1:48:17] life are the only ones who know what
[1:48:19] it's like to have a spouse who doesn't
[1:48:20] forgive you for your
[1:48:23] past. I cannot explain that to somebody
[1:48:25] who's going through the same thing. I
[1:48:27] can try. I can go tell them you need the
[1:48:29] Holy Ghost. You need prayer. You need to
[1:48:31] get closer to God. But somebody who's
[1:48:33] actually walked that path is the master
[1:48:37] of that and has come through that and
[1:48:41] come to a place where they uh they have
[1:48:44] overcome it by their own personal
[1:48:45] struggle because there's a CG gene in
[1:48:47] there that gave them power to overcome.
[1:48:50] Let me tell you there are people who
[1:48:52] cannot deal with it. If you have two
[1:48:54] people, one they've had a past, they've
[1:48:56] had a previous marital partner or
[1:48:58] fornication in their life and this one
[1:49:00] has I literally had one brother tell me,
[1:49:02] "Brother, I I cannot deal with
[1:49:05] it when I'm when I'm together with her.
[1:49:08] I cannot think of her being with someone
[1:49:10] else." He says, "There's only one way I
[1:49:12] can think. I've got to go and be with
[1:49:14] someone else to make it equal." Do not
[1:49:16] do that. Do not do that. There is a Holy
[1:49:20] Ghost. There is a word of God. There's a
[1:49:23] seed inside of you. The fact that you
[1:49:24] are even feeling that way means there's
[1:49:26] a presence of God inside you asking you
[1:49:29] to do the right thing. Brother tells us
[1:49:32] and this is this is what I want to come
[1:49:34] to. There was a young man who was trying
[1:49:36] to tell me, "Brother Al, I've I've
[1:49:38] crossed the line between mercy and
[1:49:39] judgment. I cannot count the number of
[1:49:41] wrong things I've done. There is no way
[1:49:44] God can forgive me for what I've done."
[1:49:47] I'm standing there smiling at him and
[1:49:49] he's uh he's like, "What are you
[1:49:51] smiling? I'm trying to make you
[1:49:52] understand. I said, I understand you.
[1:49:54] You just don't understand you. And he I
[1:49:57] said, you're trying to prove to me that
[1:49:59] you've crossed the line. I said, okay,
[1:50:02] do you believe the prophet is a prophet
[1:50:04] of the hour? Yes. Do you believe the
[1:50:05] Bible? Yes. I said, we're 50%
[1:50:08] there. So, he said, "What do you mean?"
[1:50:10] I said, "Well, Brother Bam said, you
[1:50:13] wouldn't be feeling guilty about your
[1:50:15] life if you didn't have the seed inside
[1:50:18] you."
[1:50:19] Amen. He said you wouldn't even be
[1:50:22] feeling sorry about it if you didn't
[1:50:24] have the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. You
[1:50:27] there's no human who would be feeling
[1:50:29] like he needs to repent unless there is
[1:50:32] a presence of God. He says as long as
[1:50:35] that feeling is
[1:50:36] there, he's still got you.
[1:50:40] If you lose that feeling, if you feel if
[1:50:42] you if you reject the word and reject
[1:50:44] the truth and you do not feel any
[1:50:46] conscience whatsoever, you're just I can
[1:50:48] do what I want. You don't tell me what
[1:50:49] to do. I don't care about the message. I
[1:50:51] don't care about the prophet. And people
[1:50:53] can even say those things out of anger.
[1:50:55] But inside there, there's turmoil.
[1:50:59] Here's the lifeline. Brother says, as
[1:51:01] long as that feeling is there, that seed
[1:51:04] is there. You know there's a seed. This
[1:51:07] is not some human conscience that feels
[1:51:09] sorry. I know all the people who do
[1:51:12] whatever they want to and are enjoying
[1:51:14] themselves. They don't have any
[1:51:16] conscience. They don't have any regret
[1:51:17] or remorse. They don't care. There's
[1:51:19] literally people who feel like, "Oh man,
[1:51:21] today's a day, a new day. I can just go
[1:51:23] commit adultery again and I'm happy."
[1:51:25] There's some guys who like, "Yeah, my
[1:51:27] wife and I have an open relationship.
[1:51:29] What is that?"
[1:51:31] Yeah. We can just do what we want to.
[1:51:33] There is no conscience. There is no
[1:51:35] seed.
[1:51:37] But you and I are constantly whipping
[1:51:39] ourselves.
[1:51:42] No, no human wants to literally do that.
[1:51:45] The only reason you would is because
[1:51:48] there is a seed inside. Amen. There is a
[1:51:51] Holy Ghost brooding over you. That is
[1:51:54] enough to tell you that God is with me.
[1:51:58] Amen. And at some point it's going to
[1:52:01] bring you to a place where enough is
[1:52:02] enough. Amen. But what you've got to get
[1:52:06] is you are the chosen ground. That he
[1:52:09] foresaw that he would put a seed inside
[1:52:12] and that seed is going to grow to full
[1:52:14] potential. Wait, the water's coming. The
[1:52:18] light's coming. Amen. Hold on. Amen. The
[1:52:23] chosen ground has everything that is
[1:52:26] needed to sustain maturity.
[1:52:29] That means the struggles, the personal
[1:52:32] life struggles that you are going to go
[1:52:33] through, God has already foreseen it.
[1:52:35] God already knew Abraham was going to
[1:52:39] say okay to give his wife to
[1:52:42] Abumc and chose
[1:52:44] him. I mean, which one of you fathers
[1:52:47] would give your daughter to a man like
[1:52:50] that? I'm I'm afraid for my life. Sure,
[1:52:52] Aimilec, you can have my wife.
[1:52:56] Never. Amen. God knew this man was going
[1:52:59] to lie. God knew this man was going to
[1:53:02] listen to his wife and take Heagga and
[1:53:04] produce Ishmael, who's going to produce
[1:53:06] the Islamic nation, who's going to cause
[1:53:07] all the terrorism and wars in this world
[1:53:10] in the Middle East. God knew it.
[1:53:13] Goded
[1:53:15] it because God needed that seed that was
[1:53:18] in Abraham. God needed him that struggle
[1:53:21] to continue for that seed to come to
[1:53:23] maturity.
[1:53:24] Amen. God knew it.
[1:53:27] The ground, the body has a duty to that
[1:53:31] seed, the original seed. And do you know
[1:53:34] what the ground's purpose is? Here's the
[1:53:37] mystery of it all. The seed has to die.
[1:53:40] That's right. Sure. The ground is going
[1:53:42] to cause the seed to die first.
[1:53:46] Why?
[1:53:49] Because verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:53:52] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:53:54] ground and die, it abideth alone, but if
[1:53:58] it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:54:02] Which means that g that the message you
[1:54:05] receive, your life is going to resist it
[1:54:09] and try as best as possible to crush it,
[1:54:12] to disbelieve it, to reason it out, to
[1:54:15] kill it in every possible way. But
[1:54:17] here's the mystery. The more you do
[1:54:19] that, the more the life is going to push
[1:54:22] out. Except it fall into the ground and
[1:54:25] die. Except the message of the hour be
[1:54:28] completely rejected in the world, it's
[1:54:31] not going to be seen for what it really
[1:54:33] is. Except Christ was to be crucified,
[1:54:37] salvation was never going to be known.
[1:54:39] Hallelujah. You are going to go through
[1:54:41] an absolute rejection of the word, the
[1:54:44] message, even personally where you are
[1:54:47] not telling people that you don't agree
[1:54:50] with something you read and you don't
[1:54:51] really like that and you don't really
[1:54:53] like church and you don't really like
[1:54:54] the preaching and you don't really like
[1:54:56] this and you you that's your ground that
[1:54:59] he chose. He wants you to go on with
[1:55:01] that. He wants that to happen. He knows
[1:55:04] he's bearing with you. is for seen it.
[1:55:07] Except the seed fall into the ground and
[1:55:11] die, it abideth
[1:55:13] alone. So get used to it. Your ground is
[1:55:16] going to cause all sorts of trouble for
[1:55:18] the gene seed. No one else's fault. Your
[1:55:22] chosen ground. This is how it all works
[1:55:24] together.
[1:55:27] So sooner or later, you'll come to the
[1:55:29] point where I need to stop trying to
[1:55:32] make this guy look extra righteous
[1:55:34] just so that people can respect him. I
[1:55:38] have to be honest. Just admit my faults.
[1:55:40] You know why? I have an inclination
[1:55:42] towards that. I've got a problem with
[1:55:44] music. I'm a gifted person. Once in a
[1:55:46] while, I really sneak in and listen to
[1:55:48] some worldly stuff. You know, it appeals
[1:55:50] to me. I need to But you don't have to
[1:55:52] remain there.
[1:55:54] You can you can go you find message
[1:55:57] people. I I hate even the words message
[1:55:59] people. I like rather the the believers
[1:56:03] or the bride, the saints, you know. It
[1:56:05] even sounds even better because once you
[1:56:07] start saying message people, you already
[1:56:09] sound like a movement. Amen.
[1:56:12] The real true bride believer.
[1:56:17] Amen.
[1:56:19] Your ground has been chosen by God.
[1:56:22] Amen. And the mystery behind it all is
[1:56:25] you have to come to the understanding
[1:56:26] that your ground was chosen to cause the
[1:56:29] seed to die so that it can bring forth.
[1:56:33] At some point or the other, you are
[1:56:35] going to stop judging yourself for the
[1:56:37] things you have done wrong. For the
[1:56:39] things you have failed in, you are going
[1:56:41] to forgive yourself for your past. Thank
[1:56:44] you, Lord. And when you do, others will
[1:56:47] feel that and they'll forgive you.
[1:56:51] Here's another thing.
[1:56:52] What is
[1:56:54] forgiveness? See, everything is in these
[1:56:57] concepts. What is forgiveness?
[1:56:59] Forgiveness is not an apology and then
[1:57:02] someone saying it's okay. We accept your
[1:57:04] apology. That's apologies and acceptance
[1:57:07] of apologies. That's not forgiveness.
[1:57:10] When someone has done wrong even to you,
[1:57:12] someone has done something wrong to you.
[1:57:14] Forgiveness
[1:57:15] is restoring your brother back to his
[1:57:20] relationship with you.
[1:57:23] and giving him value.
[1:57:28] That's forgiveness. That's what people
[1:57:30] do not do.
[1:57:33] See, it's not enough to come here and
[1:57:36] apologize and say, "Okay, well, I
[1:57:38] apologize. I I've been in the church all
[1:57:40] my life. I've seen that. I've seen
[1:57:41] apologies. I've seen tears in front.
[1:57:43] I've seen people cry and and the pastor
[1:57:46] says, "Thank you for your confession.
[1:57:48] We're happy to welcome you back in the
[1:57:50] fold. go sit down and then you go there
[1:57:52] and you're still treated like the
[1:57:54] plague. Yeah, exactly. Like other
[1:57:57] people, the children do not associate
[1:57:59] with that. They had a bad spirit on
[1:58:00] them. Don't be friends with that person.
[1:58:02] They did some really bad wrong things.
[1:58:04] They might be a bad influence. I know
[1:58:07] your your parents, you're being
[1:58:08] protective. Some of us would have done
[1:58:10] that. But you have to bring value back
[1:58:14] to that person. If you are saying you're
[1:58:16] forgiving, you have to make that person
[1:58:19] come back to level ground and say, "You
[1:58:21] and I are the same. We are brothers in
[1:58:24] this fight. You are valuable to me. How
[1:58:26] do I make them of value?" You have to
[1:58:28] minister to them. You have to raise them
[1:58:30] up in their spirit. You have to bring
[1:58:32] back because they've just been devalued
[1:58:34] by the enemy. They've been devalued by
[1:58:36] people around them. Forgiveness is
[1:58:38] giving them back value.
[1:58:41] That's true forgiveness. How do you
[1:58:43] know? Look at how Christ forgave.
[1:58:46] Amen. The woman who was washing his feet
[1:58:49] and how this the Pharisees were
[1:58:51] devaluing her in front of them. He says
[1:58:54] to since I have been here, you have not
[1:58:58] washed my feet but she has not stopped.
[1:59:01] Right there. He put her on a level that
[1:59:04] was
[1:59:06] higher than the Pharisees. Amen. Here
[1:59:08] was he who was Christ, who was the
[1:59:11] savior, who was God himself in flesh,
[1:59:14] uplifting someone who the whole world
[1:59:17] would have rejected and he gave her
[1:59:20] value. That's the thing we because and
[1:59:23] it's a weakness because we don't even
[1:59:25] know how to give ourselves value. We
[1:59:27] struggle with giving another person
[1:59:29] value. It's
[1:59:31] like it should be this and I'm just I
[1:59:33] don't even know because it's so unique
[1:59:35] with every person. If your wife has made
[1:59:37] you upset and she comes to you and she
[1:59:40] hugs you and say, "Honey, I'm so sorry.
[1:59:42] Please forgive me. I was so foolish. I
[1:59:43] should never have done I should never
[1:59:44] have said that or something." And you
[1:59:46] stand there and say back tap like we men
[1:59:49] do, you know. It's okay, honey. It's
[1:59:52] okay. It's okay. It's okay. That's so
[1:59:56] condescending. It's okay
[1:59:59] means I'm glad you know you were wrong.
[2:00:05] You know, now we can establish our
[2:00:07] dominance all over
[2:00:08] again. That's not
[2:00:11] forgiveness. How do I lift her value
[2:00:15] back? I'm just going to be I'm going to
[2:00:17] break down crying. I'm I'm so sorry I
[2:00:20] made you do that. I'm so sorry I gave
[2:00:23] you the impression to to even say that
[2:00:26] to me. I'm so inadequate myself. Let me
[2:00:28] take you for breakfast.
[2:00:32] you know, in some stupid male way.
[2:00:34] Something I can do to buy you a teddy
[2:00:36] bear, you know, for something or do
[2:00:38] something to bring you back with value.
[2:00:41] You know, men, teddy bears, and
[2:00:43] chocolates and flowers. That's the only
[2:00:44] thing they taught
[2:00:47] us. We need new ideas. Those things are
[2:00:49] getting
[2:00:50] stale, right?
[2:00:56] I mean, wouldn't it be better if I
[2:00:57] climbed this volcano and came down with
[2:00:59] a wilting flower and said, "You know how
[2:01:01] much effort it took?"
[2:01:04] And she'd be like, "This is the sweetest
[2:01:05] thing." She'll press it in between books
[2:01:07] and keep it for life. You
[2:01:14] know, give them value. Bring back value.
[2:01:18] Amen. That's what forgiveness realism.
[2:01:20] You see how much more there is to the
[2:01:22] message? how much more there is to the
[2:01:24] mysteries.
[2:01:27] Right? You know what happens when you
[2:01:29] lift people up and bring value back to
[2:01:31] them? They become the strongest people,
[2:01:35] loyal, patriotic to the word. They will
[2:01:38] stand with you till the day you die.
[2:01:42] That's what happens when you give value
[2:01:44] back to people. That's actually what
[2:01:46] forgiveness. Think about God's
[2:01:48] forgiveness to us.
[2:01:51] Think about no matter what we've done
[2:01:53] wrong, no matter how many times, the
[2:01:55] fact that he knows, that he sees, that
[2:01:58] he hears, that he knows our thoughts,
[2:02:00] that even while we're doing something
[2:02:02] wrong, he's even there knowing and
[2:02:05] watching what we're doing. And yet, he
[2:02:09] still tells a prophet to tell you, you
[2:02:11] are virtuous, sinless,
[2:02:13] virgin born, bride of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:15] Christ. You were in my mind before the
[2:02:17] foundation of the world. He's how who
[2:02:20] can give value like that? True. And
[2:02:23] still he provide for our needs. He helps
[2:02:27] us in in times of trouble. He gives us
[2:02:30] wisdom from the word. There is preaching
[2:02:32] that comes from ministers, from people
[2:02:34] that just brings you back in the fold
[2:02:37] and lifts you up. He's doing everything
[2:02:39] to bring you value back and you're just
[2:02:42] whipping yourself. But he's the one
[2:02:44] you're the one saying, "I've crossed the
[2:02:46] line." He's not even He's saying there
[2:02:48] is no line.
[2:02:50] You're my bride. There is no line for a
[2:02:52] bride. There's a line for a church, but
[2:02:54] for a bride, there is no line. There is
[2:02:57] no divorce. So, what line are you
[2:02:59] talking about?
[2:03:03] Praise be to God. Chosen ground. The
[2:03:06] seed must die for the life within to be
[2:03:08] exposed. You know, I feel like you we've
[2:03:11] got it. But I want to go quickly back
[2:03:14] just very quickly through all that and
[2:03:17] not all
[2:03:19] that, just that, and we can close.
[2:03:23] Musicians, you can come up. For verily I
[2:03:26] say unto you that many prophets and
[2:03:28] righteous men have desired to see those
[2:03:31] things which you see, and you have and
[2:03:33] have not seen them, and to hear those
[2:03:34] things which you hear, and have not
[2:03:36] heard them. Hear you therefore the
[2:03:38] parable of the swer. So look at this
[2:03:40] very quickly. When one heareth the word,
[2:03:42] the word heareth means understanding. He
[2:03:45] that hath an ear the ability to hear the
[2:03:48] word, let him hear, let him understand
[2:03:51] what the spirit is saying to the
[2:03:52] churches. Hearing is
[2:03:55] understanding. And heareth the word of
[2:03:57] the kingdom and understandeth it
[2:04:00] not. Like that sounds like a parable. So
[2:04:03] what are you not understanding? You're
[2:04:05] understanding the word that is coming to
[2:04:07] you, but you're adding interpretation to
[2:04:10] it, false interpretation, or you're not
[2:04:12] understanding the purpose of it. So, you
[2:04:15] receive the message, but you're walking
[2:04:18] just following the
[2:04:19] crowd, right? What's going to happen is
[2:04:22] then cometh the wicked one, the wicked
[2:04:24] one. That means temptations. Temptations
[2:04:26] are going to make you fall. They're
[2:04:28] going to catch you away. They're going
[2:04:30] to catch away that which was swn in the
[2:04:31] heart. This is he which receives seed by
[2:04:34] the wayside. That means the seed just
[2:04:35] fell on the ground and it was left and
[2:04:38] the birds can just come and pluck it
[2:04:40] away. That's temptation, right? That has
[2:04:43] happened to so many people. What? Why?
[2:04:46] Because there was no
[2:04:48] water. There was no breaking up the
[2:04:50] fellow ground. There was nothing to let
[2:04:53] it sink in and take hold and take root
[2:04:54] and let the seed die. The seed was just
[2:04:57] left. You're just following the crowd.
[2:04:58] you're following through the Red Sea
[2:05:01] because everyone's going in that general
[2:05:04] direction. It if you don't let it sink
[2:05:07] in the soul, if you don't let it get
[2:05:09] inside, if you don't let it work on you,
[2:05:11] if you're just living the message by
[2:05:13] traditions, if you're just walking along
[2:05:15] with the crowd, at some point you are
[2:05:17] going to be taken by temptations. Amen.
[2:05:21] Simple. He that receiveth the seed into
[2:05:24] stony places, there's your legalist.
[2:05:27] The same is he that heareth the word and
[2:05:29] with joy receiveth it. Yet there's no
[2:05:33] root in
[2:05:34] himself. That's a stony heart. That's a
[2:05:37] heart that's ruled by complexes. A
[2:05:40] legalist is one who has fear. He
[2:05:43] actually is a nice person. He just
[2:05:45] doesn't want to admit it. He's actually
[2:05:47] someone who has so much of fear and
[2:05:49] doubt and he himself has been devalued
[2:05:52] along his life's way. He himself has
[2:05:55] been whipped and and subjected to things
[2:05:57] of of a restrictive church or ideology.
[2:06:01] He just really needs a hug. Somebody
[2:06:04] take him sit down and said, "Brother, I
[2:06:06] love
[2:06:07] you." He needs a hug. He doesn't need
[2:06:10] more criticism. The more you whip him,
[2:06:12] the harder he gets. And the problem with
[2:06:14] a stony heart is the root doesn't take.
[2:06:18] And he he endures for a short while for
[2:06:21] then tribulation and persecution starts
[2:06:24] and rises because of the word split in a
[2:06:27] church disorients
[2:06:29] him. Uh somebody preaching a false
[2:06:31] doctrine disorients him. What's
[2:06:34] happening when things go wrong? If his
[2:06:36] family does something wrong, he thinks
[2:06:38] the only way is make the law stricter.
[2:06:41] Tighten up. Fix this. Sort this out.
[2:06:45] Judge it. make sure that they're not
[2:06:48] going to criticize me because if I
[2:06:50] because he he doesn't understand
[2:06:52] criticism is actually good. Correction
[2:06:54] is good. The law is perfect. But he
[2:06:56] feels like if I say it, if I do it,
[2:06:59] they're going to judge me. So tighten
[2:07:01] up. Make it and make sure you tell them
[2:07:03] I I excommunicated my own
[2:07:06] son because I I stand on principle on
[2:07:09] God's
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:11] word. You know, excommunication.
[2:07:15] If if there's something wrong with your
[2:07:17] left
[2:07:18] hand and the doctor say you got to cut
[2:07:20] it off, how quick do you make that
[2:07:23] decision?
[2:07:26] You'll be, I want a second
[2:07:28] opinion. Give me time. Just give me
[2:07:31] time. I don't want to lose it. I don't
[2:07:33] want to cut it off. How quick do we
[2:07:35] excommunicate someone from church
[2:07:37] without love? How how much time do you
[2:07:40] give that person who's been through
[2:07:41] something? Is 2 weeks really enough? And
[2:07:44] then the Bible says, "Take two
[2:07:45] witnesses. If they don't listen, take it
[2:07:47] to the church." The church, if you're
[2:07:50] about to correct someone with
[2:07:52] excommunication, every member of the
[2:07:54] church needs to try and restore that
[2:07:55] brother.
[2:07:57] You visit him, you phone him, you pepper
[2:08:00] him because you believe he's a part of
[2:08:02] your body. You can't just make an
[2:08:04] instant decision to cut him off. Every
[2:08:06] one of you phone him, visit him. Don't
[2:08:08] give up. The only way he will be is like
[2:08:12] when it turns gangangerous and it
[2:08:13] doesn't even want to be a part of your
[2:08:15] body. So it turns gangrronous and it's
[2:08:18] it's saying I reject the word. I hate
[2:08:21] this word. I hate the prophet. But if
[2:08:23] you know it's somebody who just made a
[2:08:25] mistake was done something wrong even if
[2:08:27] it's grievously wrong and he's not ready
[2:08:30] to repent because he's going through
[2:08:31] issues your job as the church is to win
[2:08:34] him back. Amen. You don't just slice
[2:08:36] your your your your body part off. This
[2:08:40] is excommunication is completely an act
[2:08:42] of love. Most people in message circles
[2:08:46] get to take two witnesses and then if
[2:08:49] they don't listen, give them time.
[2:08:52] That's wrong,
[2:08:53] saints. You can win that person back by
[2:08:56] giving them value. They'll see value
[2:08:58] when every one of you reach out to them.
[2:09:00] Even if you can't say sit there and
[2:09:03] counsel him say brother Alistister what
[2:09:04] do I say sometimes it's so hard and then
[2:09:06] we know this the pastor even tells us
[2:09:08] don't talk to him you're not allowed to
[2:09:11] it's not even your job to do
[2:09:14] so it is and that pastor is leading you
[2:09:17] wrong if it tells you you have to in
[2:09:20] some way and if you want to go speak to
[2:09:22] your pastor and tell him pastor I've had
[2:09:24] this experience I know what it feels
[2:09:26] like I think I can do something let me
[2:09:29] just take him some food or take him a
[2:09:31] meat pie or something and have
[2:09:32] a a breakfast with him or something and
[2:09:35] just encourage him and tell him,
[2:09:36] "Brother, I'm praying for you. I really
[2:09:38] want to see you back. I know you're
[2:09:40] going through something. You don't have
[2:09:41] to be a deacon or a trustee or an office
[2:09:44] holder, but this is part of your body
[2:09:47] and you need to win him back."
[2:09:51] I feel sorry for the legalists because I
[2:09:54] know they've been secretly whipped in
[2:09:56] their lives. They've been treated,
[2:09:58] mistreated. They've been made to become
[2:10:00] hard. They've been made to become
[2:10:02] rulekeepers. And they don't know.
[2:10:04] They're robbing themselves of true
[2:10:09] happiness. Yet he hath no root in
[2:10:12] himself. But endureth for a while.
[2:10:15] That's the problem with that legalistic
[2:10:17] approach. It's not going to be long. You
[2:10:20] are going to end up in depression. Live
[2:10:23] with, you know, with people with a stony
[2:10:25] heart. You can just see it on their
[2:10:27] face. There's no joy of
[2:10:29] salvation. They will stand in church.
[2:10:32] They're the type of people be watching.
[2:10:34] Song service is too long. Preaching is
[2:10:36] too long. This is out of order. Cood.
[2:10:38] That in psychology is like
[2:10:41] OCD. It's it's it's mental health gone
[2:10:45] wrong. Right? It's like it it makes you
[2:10:48] anxious if just one thing is out of
[2:10:50] order.
[2:10:53] Right? But there is no there's nothing
[2:10:55] orderly about the seed taking root and
[2:10:58] dying and mess and filth. Brother Baron
[2:11:01] said salvation is a messy affair.
[2:11:06] Praise be to God. God is wonderful. He
[2:11:09] also that receives seed among the thorns
[2:11:10] is he that heareth the word and care for
[2:11:13] this world. And all right, he hears the
[2:11:16] word. He understands the word. care for
[2:11:17] the world is family life, bills to pay,
[2:11:21] children to educate,
[2:11:23] uh things to do. And the deceitfulness
[2:11:26] of riches, deceitfulness of riches is
[2:11:29] where exactly that you need to excel.
[2:11:33] You need to excel in career. You're
[2:11:35] placing career above your eternal
[2:11:38] purpose. You're placing business. You're
[2:11:40] placing you can skip church when you
[2:11:43] know there's no reason you can leave it
[2:11:45] for Monday.
[2:11:47] You'll even do this with family. You'll
[2:11:49] bring work home and neglect a wife who's
[2:11:51] just needing a hug. You'll neglect a
[2:11:53] husband who's just needing a hug or just
[2:11:55] needing a conversation. You're putting
[2:11:57] all of this is the deceitfulness of
[2:11:59] riches today. Why? Because in your mind,
[2:12:02] I have to get this done because I got a
[2:12:04] deadline for for the weekend. I've got a
[2:12:06] deadline for the end of the month. But
[2:12:08] you're putting things in a way and what
[2:12:10] does it say? It chokes the word.
[2:12:14] And when you choke the word, it makes it
[2:12:16] unfruitful. Then you stop seeing the
[2:12:19] fruits of the spirit. Then you start to
[2:12:21] become an unlovable person. Fruits of
[2:12:24] the spirit. Love, joy, peace. Amen.
[2:12:27] That's what people, you know, there's
[2:12:29] some people you just love to be around.
[2:12:32] They do, they don't look at you with a
[2:12:34] different kind of lens. They just want
[2:12:35] to fellowship about the word. They're
[2:12:37] not extra critical. They're not always
[2:12:39] stressed. You know, a highmaintenance
[2:12:42] friend is is
[2:12:44] complicated. We don't like
[2:12:46] highmaintenance relationships. We want
[2:12:48] people, you know, just smile more, just
[2:12:51] laugh more, just, you know,
[2:12:55] relax. God has saved us. God has drawn
[2:12:58] us together. We have this beautiful
[2:13:00] message. Let's not overcorrect each
[2:13:03] other. Amen. Let's not uh uh point out
[2:13:06] each other's faults all the time. Praise
[2:13:09] is also good.
[2:13:13] You're bringing up a child. It's okay to
[2:13:15] say, "Don't do that. Don't do that.
[2:13:18] Don't do that." But it's more important
[2:13:20] to say, "Well done. You did a great job.
[2:13:24] This was good. You can do it better. Let
[2:13:27] daddy show you. How about this way?" And
[2:13:30] the child was, he looks at you with eyes
[2:13:32] of admiration. You become his hero.
[2:13:35] Like, I never thought of that. Now he
[2:13:37] wants to do it that way. all the time
[2:13:39] because you took him in and you showed
[2:13:41] him
[2:13:42] right. Deceitfulness of riches chokes
[2:13:46] the word. It's so simple. What is the
[2:13:49] point of knowing the seventh seal and
[2:13:50] all the mysteries when we can't get this
[2:13:52] right?
[2:13:56] 23. But he that receives seed into good
[2:13:59] ground. Good ground is not ground that
[2:14:03] keeps all the rules. Good ground that
[2:14:05] allows itself to be broken, allows
[2:14:08] itself to be watered, is submissive to
[2:14:10] the seed, gives way to the seed, allows
[2:14:14] the seed, be humble enough to let it
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:20] die, which also beareth fruit, bringeth
[2:14:23] forth. And here's the thing, some of you
[2:14:25] might have hundfold. Some of you might
[2:14:27] be the ones in front who get all the
[2:14:29] attention who read all do all the
[2:14:31] studying who produce this oh you can
[2:14:34] worship you can praise you have prophecy
[2:14:36] you have dreams you speak some of you
[2:14:38] might have 60 some of you might have 30
[2:14:41] but it's the good seed in good ground
[2:14:44] everybody doesn't have to be the same
[2:14:47] this is how it all works together and
[2:14:49] this is the relationship between the
[2:14:51] seed and the ground that's the
[2:14:53] foundation and that's where we are today
[2:14:55] amen Amen. The Lord bless you, brother
[2:14:57] Al. Oh, are we handing over to the God
[2:15:00] bless you, my brother. God be with you,
[2:15:02] saints, until this evening. The Lord
[2:15:04] bless
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:07] you. Bless you,
[2:15:12] [Music]
[2:15:13] brother. Amazing
[2:15:17] love. I know it's
[2:15:21] true. And it's my joy to honor
[2:15:27] you. And all I
[2:15:30] do, I honor
[2:15:34] [Music]
[2:15:37] you. I'm
[2:15:39] forgi because you were
[2:15:44] forsaken. I'm
[2:15:48] accepted. You are condemned.
[2:15:53] Oh, I'm alive while your spirit is
[2:15:57] within me
[2:16:00] because you died or rose
[2:16:07] again. Amazing
[2:16:10] love. How can it
[2:16:15] be that you, my king, would die for me?
[2:16:23] Amazing
[2:16:25] love I know is
