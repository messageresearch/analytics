[18:37] depression but um this song really
[18:41] relates to me and I hope it relates to
[18:45] you all as well well not of course I

[18:53] that need
[18:54] it and just know that you're not alone
[18:58] because there are a lot of people that
[19:00] suffer with anxiety and

[39:14] me to be here this
[39:17] evening um to speak to his
[39:22] purchased
[39:25] possession um
[39:27] thank you Pastor El just for allowing me
[39:29] the
[39:31] opportunity
[39:35] um I just just before um a couple of
[39:39] weeks
[39:40] ago uh the the Lord just dropped this I
[39:43] was you know you know how it is you
[39:44] going through the uh sermons of brother
[39:47] brandham you're studying the word and
[39:48] then certain things just pops out at you
[39:53] and uh the Lord just laid this quote on
[39:54] my heart and I wasn't going to read it
[39:57] but I just felt before we go into the
[40:00] word I'd like to just read there's just
[40:03] two
[40:04] quotes um and then we'll we'll go into
[40:06] the word but the brandom says here um in
[40:10] the message Jesus Christ the same
[40:12] yesterday today and
[40:14] forever he says um I just want to say
[40:18] there's so many people passing through
[40:22] you that's suffering with mental
[40:25] oppression
[40:27] he says demon manifestation but
[40:31] oppression he said I seen the vision
[40:34] break before me of a young lady she went
[40:38] back there and sat down a few minutes
[40:41] ago and this lady brother Bram says
[40:44] thinks she's crossed the separating
[40:49] line he says don't let Satan tell you
[40:55] that cuz you know many times the enemy
[40:57] comes and he plagues your mind and he
[41:01] tells you that you know what you've done
[41:03] things and there's no
[41:05] Grace I just want you to know don't
[41:08] listen to the devil brother BR says
[41:11] don't let Satan tell you that as long as
[41:15] you love God God still loves
[41:20] you and I think that's so key and so
[41:23] important that we need to know that God
[41:27] loves
[41:28] us he
[41:30] says um it has to be a Creator to create
[41:35] that Creation in your heart to make you
[41:40] love God and I know you know as I was
[41:42] watching and
[41:44] observing um all of you over this
[41:46] weekend I like to observe people I like
[41:48] to sit in the back and I just watch
[41:50] things and I can see that there is a
[41:54] genuine love for the Lord don't let the
[41:59] devil come in between that he says and
[42:04] then he says he talks to the sister he
[42:05] says go believing with all your heart
[42:10] that Christ loves
[42:13] you right that's the one quote the other
[42:15] quote he gave me Divine
[42:17] love brother brandham says no matter
[42:20] what you've

[42:47] to drop that in before we go into the

[43:15] 4 verse
[43:18] 7 and I've got my timer on so my alarm
[43:23] might go off in the next 50 minutes
[43:27] but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop
[43:28] in 50
[43:31] minutes I will see that's just like a
[43:34] guideline for me I normally preach about

[44:07] therefore to
[44:08] God resist the devil and he will flee
[44:13] from
[44:14] you we'll just say a prayer quickly and
[44:16] I just remembered actually um I've got a
[44:19] I've got a 9-year-old grandmother out in
[44:22] South Africa and uh I just received news
[44:26] um that during their South African night
[44:30] she had fallen off the bed and you know
[44:33] 90-year-old they the bodies are frail so
[44:36] she broke um I think something in the
[44:39] arm year um so she's been to the
[44:41] hospital and they um talking about doing
[44:45] surgery for her but they're still also
[44:47] weighing things up because of her age
[44:48] and she's frail so if you would allow me
[44:51] I just want to just pray for my
[44:53] grandmother as well if we could just bow
[44:55] our heads
[44:57] Lord Jesus we want to say thank you for
[44:59] your word that's been read and Lord God
[45:03] the inspiration and the burden that
[45:05] you've laid on my heart um father I just
[45:08] commit that into your hands and I pray
[45:10] that you just help us through this
[45:13] meeting my God as I believe that you're
[45:15] going to be speaking to every heart
[45:19] tonight Lord just the prayer request for
[45:21] my grandmother Mar harom Lord she's
[45:24] frail 90 years old old you've kept her
[45:26] for all these years and Lord I will
[45:29] never forget how she was so instrumental
[45:33] in helping me teaching me to pray my God
[45:37] and I just want to um as we stand here
[45:39] together oh God as Believers Lord
[45:42] collectively father God we want to come
[45:44] to you by faith and we want to ask that

[45:49] and whatever they need to do my God the
[45:51] doctors the decisions the surgery the
[45:53] anesthetic whatever Lord God we commit
[45:56] it all into your hands and we ask that
[45:58] you would put strength into uh my
[46:01] grandmother in the name of Jesus we say
[46:04] thank you amen God bless you you may be
[46:07] seated um this this
[46:10] morning um so there's um you know I hope
[46:14] it's okay for me just to be me
[46:16] tonight and uh I I I when I speak right
[46:21] I I I speak of a burden that the lord
[46:23] has laid in my heart right um and uh i'
[46:28] I've I've always been of the opinion
[46:30] that I cannot be someone else I am who
[46:33] God has made me to be so uh the burden
[46:37] that the Lord has just laid on my heart
[46:39] and we're going to see how how how the
[46:42] meeting goes right but I've got a title
[46:44] here and um the title says
[46:48] surrender to our Lord Jesus Christ and
[46:53] allow his healing to flow
[46:56] that is just the burden that the lord
[46:58] has laid on my heart to release uh to us
[47:01] this evening now I'll start off with
[47:03] this quotation of brother Brandon where
[47:05] he says here in the angel of the
[47:07] Covenant he says the
[47:10] Christian has not one worry in the
[47:15] world he says they should be the most
[47:19] freest happiest people in all the world
[47:25] and you know as I was watching you uh
[47:27] young people this over this weekend I
[47:29] can see that you are Christians and
[47:31] that's why I said I can see that you
[47:33] love the Lord there's something
[47:36] different about you when you take
[47:39] yourself and you compare yourself to
[47:41] what's happening out there so appreciate
[47:45] what you have so he says we are the most
[47:51] freest happiest people in the world and
[47:54] then he uses the statement he says you
[47:58] can't
[48:01] lose and I want you to grab that and I
[48:05] want you to hold on to that because life
[48:09] will come and try to tell you something
[48:13] else life and the devil and situations
[48:17] will try to tell you that you a loser
[48:21] that you are not able to
[48:23] attain but my prophet
[48:26] has come and tell told me and telling
[48:28] you that as a
[48:31] Christian totally surrender to God you
[48:36] cannot and you will not
[48:40] lose so you see you are and I am part of
[48:44] that
[48:46] generation that will not lose cannot
[48:50] lose contrary to what the situation
[48:55] might might try to tell
[48:58] you contrary to how you might think you
[49:03] are feeling you might wake up one
[49:06] morning and feel so down and so
[49:11] depressed but even in that state of
[49:14] feeling down and feeling depressed as a
[49:19] son and a daughter of God you cannot
[49:24] lose
[49:27] so the devil will try to tell you you're
[49:32] a loser and when he comes and he tries
[49:36] to tell you
[49:38] that you tell the devil shut up
[49:43] devil I'm a
[49:47] winner my God has made me a
[49:51] winner and I'm not a winner in the
[49:54] future
[49:56] I'm a winner right
[50:00] now as you sit here this evening you are
[50:05] a winner right
[50:08] now
[50:10] regardless of what you
[50:14] think so don't
[50:18] doubt who you
[50:21] are God has made you as has has placed
[50:27] something powerful within
[50:29] you and I you know what I've discovered
[50:32] many times in
[50:34] life that I Taz many times I've got to
[50:40] press pause
[50:43] Taz because many times Taz want to tell
[50:47] Taz such a lot of foolish
[50:50] things but you see this word is and I
[50:54] said it I think on on uh yesterday this
[50:57] word is telling you who you
[51:01] are it's telling you that you are not
[51:04] some
[51:05] downtrodden thing you're not just some
[51:09] piece of thing that gets kicked
[51:11] around you are Sons and Daughters of the
[51:15] most high
[51:17] God the mighty
[51:20] conquerer lives with inside of
[51:24] you
[51:27] so
[51:28] don't
[51:29] allow and I might repeat myself but
[51:33] don't
[51:34] allow anything to tell you that you are
[51:38] nothing you are a something in the sight
[51:43] of God and he loves
[51:46] you so you and I and and and and and
[51:49] many times it is a battle where we have
[51:53] got to press pause our own
[51:56] thoughts and then we get so overwhelmed
[51:59] with
[52:01] things but I believe that God gives us
[52:04] the grace and he makes a way for us to
[52:08] press pause
[52:10] ourselves because this word is calling
[52:14] you and me
[52:16] higher right we we don't stay and Mark
[52:21] time on one place but we're moving
[52:25] forward all the
[52:28] time so many times if you think you know
[52:31] what I'm not really a good Christian and
[52:34] and uh you know I failed God and these
[52:36] things the devil wants you to focus on
[52:38] those negative
[52:40] stuff but you you know but but he tries
[52:43] to get your attention away from the
[52:46] positive things that has happened
[52:49] because maybe yesterday the Temptation
[52:51] came and I was able to say no but maybe
[52:56] today something happens and I slip and I
[52:58] fall and the Devil comes and he hammers
[53:00] on that but then we forget the victory
[53:04] that we had
[53:07] yesterday brother brandom says this and
[53:10] this is not just quotes right that I'm
[53:11] want to quote to you but this is
[53:13] something that I want you to take and I
[53:15] want you to apply it to your life and I
[53:18] want you to take it and say Lord I'm
[53:21] receiving it within me it's not just
[53:24] words that brother the Taz or any
[53:27] minister is saying but this is here to
[53:30] help me to recognize and realize that I
[53:34] am an overcomer brother brandham says
[53:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[53:39] and forever he says the word of God will
[53:44] defeat Satan
[53:46] anywhere
[53:48] anytime any place on any
[53:53] condition the word of God
[53:57] alone and you have
[54:02] access to this
[54:05] word this word is preached into each one
[54:08] of us and we sat and we've got to
[54:11] receive
[54:14] it and as we receive it this word shows
[54:18] us and teaches us and helps us to
[54:22] overcome and defeat Satan
[54:26] because we know Satan is a bluff he just
[54:29] tries things and he tries to say all
[54:32] this
[54:34] rubish but we know brother brand taught
[54:36] us whenever he opens up his mouth he
[54:41] lies so he might plant little thoughts
[54:45] into your
[54:48] head so when he does that you say devil
[54:50] shut
[54:52] up Adam goes in God's covenant with ABR
[54:55] he says Jesus defeated Satan on his own
[54:59] ground with the word of God so Jesus
[55:05] proved that it's possible to defeat the
[55:09] enemy with it is
[55:13] written and you and I can do the same
[55:17] and I know as you're listening to me as
[55:19] you watching me you've heard this so
[55:22] many times stuff of these a lot of these
[55:24] things to us message children you know
[55:27] and I'm one of them that grew up you
[55:29] know in the church and grew up in the
[55:30] message and heard all these things but
[55:34] it had to at some point become a reality
[55:39] in my life I had to one day take this
[55:43] word and then I had to apply it when I
[55:46] was
[55:47] alone there was no Pastor no Deacon no
[55:50] Mom no dad I was
[55:53] alone and I I had to use the
[55:58] word and I found out that it
[56:03] works so if you've never ever used the
[56:07] word against the enemy I encourage you
[56:10] use it brother brandham says that the
[56:15] weakest
[56:17] Christian and you know many times we
[56:19] look at ourselves we look at our friends
[56:20] and we look at brother Michael standing
[56:23] here and he's preaching the word and man
[56:25] he's so powerful and we look at him and
[56:27] say man I wish I could be like brother
[56:29] Michael he's such a strong Christian and
[56:32] I look at myself I'm so weak but brother
[56:35] Brandon comes and he encourag even you
[56:39] that think that you are weak you are
[56:43] strong but it's not you that's strong it
[56:46] is the god that you have surrendered
[56:50] yourself
[56:52] too so brother Bram says the
[56:56] weakest Christian here tonight so you
[57:00] know if you think you're weak not if you
[57:03] think you're weak can defeat Satan
[57:07] anywhere any place any time under any
[57:14] condition I want you to receive
[57:16] that this is not just you know words
[57:20] that we throwing at you and also
[57:23] sometimes some of these quotes
[57:25] can become
[57:28] buzzword but these are not just buzzword
[57:31] that you know we just throwing out there
[57:34] just to make you feel good but this is
[57:38] life and it's important that you hear
[57:42] and that you receive
[57:45] life because as you receiving this
[57:49] word God is showing you really who you
[57:55] are because we know that this walk that
[57:58] we walking it's a constant
[58:02] battle and brother brandham would come
[58:04] and preach a message called the
[58:08] contest and then he would say you define
[58:11] that the word contest it's a test of
[58:16] strength and then you would tell us as
[58:19] an example he say the American Indians
[58:21] they would build a fire in the middle
[58:25] and he says then they would have a rope
[58:27] and a group on the one end a group on
[58:31] the other end and he says they they'll
[58:33] have a
[58:35] contest where the one group is pulling
[58:37] the Rope the side the other group is
[58:39] pulling the rope that side and the
[58:42] objective brother brandham says with the
[58:44] American Indians was that the they want
[58:47] to the the one team wants to pull the
[58:49] other team into the fire so it is a a a
[58:54] test of who is
[58:57] stronger and brother Brandon comes he
[58:59] says now we know there's many things
[59:03] that we could base that example on but
[59:05] he says but I want to speak for these
[59:08] minutes
[59:09] quickly upon the greatest contest that
[59:13] there
[59:14] is and that's between the
[59:18] church you the church and
[59:22] Satan and then he says the
[59:25] great
[59:27] strength of Satan now we know our
[59:30] adversary is
[59:32] powerful but he says we want to speak of
[59:37] the great strength of
[59:40] God in his
[59:43] church and I want you to to to receive
[59:48] that because our God is all powerful and
[59:53] then brother brandham says how it
[59:55] started in heaven and how Satan was
[59:58] kicked out and he becomes an enemy to
[1:00:01] God's people and since then he's used
[1:00:06] everything to try to get
[1:00:10] you but remember you are not a
[1:00:14] loser you are a what's that song that we
[1:00:17] sing I'm a winner in Christ my Lord
[1:00:22] that's who you
[1:00:23] are and brother random goes on in the
[1:00:26] contest he says and we know who has the
[1:00:28] most power God does and he says and when
[1:00:33] God gave his people the best thing that
[1:00:37] could combat Satan and that's the word
[1:00:41] of God brother brandham says and you and
[1:00:43] I we have access man don't ever
[1:00:47] undervalue this word and it's not just
[1:00:50] any word it's not just cuz the
[1:00:52] Pentecostal and the every body's got
[1:00:54] this Bible but you and I have access to
[1:00:58] an open book you and I have access to
[1:01:01] things that is so amazing so tremendous
[1:01:05] so powerful and we should appreciate God
[1:01:10] for that so we are in a
[1:01:13] contest and now having said that I read
[1:01:18] the
[1:01:20] scripture the Bible says submit yourself
[1:01:24] to
[1:01:26] God resist the
[1:01:28] devil and he will flee from
[1:01:31] you now I love I love the way the Bible
[1:01:36] places things the Bible is so
[1:01:39] specific and when I when I looked at
[1:01:41] that scripture I thought wow this is so
[1:01:45] powerful because if you look at the
[1:01:48] order of that just that scripture the
[1:01:52] Bible says submit
[1:01:55] yourself therefore to God right step one
[1:02:00] submit yourself to God then the
[1:02:04] scripture goes on after you have
[1:02:07] submitted yourself to God then there is
[1:02:11] something within you that allows you to
[1:02:16] resist the
[1:02:18] devil because we read earlier brother
[1:02:21] brandom says our adversary is powerful
[1:02:24] and he is strong but our God is
[1:02:30] strong but our God wants you and I to
[1:02:34] resist the devil and his tricks and the
[1:02:39] things that comes our way I'm sure as
[1:02:41] you're looking at me you can identify
[1:02:45] that every single day of your life you
[1:02:49] are fighting the
[1:02:52] enemy it's a constant battle he wants to
[1:02:56] destroy
[1:02:58] you but he will not
[1:03:02] succeed don't let anybody tell you
[1:03:06] anything
[1:03:07] different you are the purchased
[1:03:10] possession of the most high
[1:03:14] God you are in the palm of his
[1:03:17] hand and no devil no demon no situation
[1:03:22] can pluck you out
[1:03:25] so the Bible says submit yourself to
[1:03:31] God that is
[1:03:33] key and for the next couple of minutes I
[1:03:36] think I want to just talk a little bit
[1:03:40] about
[1:03:42] submission talk a little bit about
[1:03:47] surrender in in uh non-military use that
[1:03:53] word submit
[1:03:55] it says here it was a
[1:03:58] voluntary
[1:04:00] attitude of giving
[1:04:03] in
[1:04:05] voluntary and that's what God wants of
[1:04:07] you and me he wants us to
[1:04:11] voluntary not being
[1:04:14] forced but just
[1:04:16] voluntary I submit myself to you
[1:04:22] Lord because you see
[1:04:25] as you submit to God and I read the
[1:04:30] scripture something happens
[1:04:34] within and you know that that word
[1:04:37] submit or that word
[1:04:41] surrender in the in the the big bad
[1:04:45] world of
[1:04:47] today that is not something that the
[1:04:49] normal person would like to
[1:04:53] do because if you think of that word
[1:04:56] surrender to many people it sounds like
[1:05:01] a act of
[1:05:04] weakness right people do not like to
[1:05:10] submit or to surrender to
[1:05:13] things
[1:05:15] it's tends to be
[1:05:18] associated with
[1:05:22] defeat many people
[1:05:24] I wrote it here connect
[1:05:27] submission with
[1:05:31] weakness or with
[1:05:35] fear but you see
[1:05:37] that is the
[1:05:39] definition out
[1:05:42] there to you and
[1:05:45] me as
[1:05:47] Believers
[1:05:49] submission to the
[1:05:51] word surrender to our Lord Jesus
[1:05:56] Christ is a powerful
[1:06:00] thing there a song that says the more
[1:06:03] that I
[1:06:06] Surrender the lighter my
[1:06:10] Lord the more that I
[1:06:13] Surrender
[1:06:15] myself the more he takes
[1:06:20] control amen and that's what we want we
[1:06:24] want him to take control of Our
[1:06:29] Lives we want him to live through us
[1:06:35] because at the end of the day you and I
[1:06:38] we are here today to prove that the word
[1:06:43] of God is all
[1:06:46] powerful so brother brandham comes right
[1:06:49] and he says here in the Queen of Sheba
[1:06:50] he says he talks about people having
[1:06:53] pieces of the cross
[1:06:54] of Jesus and nails and he says I don't
[1:06:57] care he says how many pieces of that
[1:06:59] cross you have or he says how many nails
[1:07:03] you have we he says this you me we need
[1:07:10] to produce this word
[1:07:14] again you see this word needs to
[1:07:19] live through you and through me he says
[1:07:24] we don't put it on the cross or piece of
[1:07:27] the Cross or piece of the nail he says
[1:07:29] but on the
[1:07:31] living
[1:07:32] atmosphere of the holy spirit it's so
[1:07:38] important that we need to find ourselves
[1:07:43] living under the right kind of
[1:07:49] atmosphere because under the right kind
[1:07:52] of atmosphere osphere the right things
[1:07:57] happen under a wrong
[1:08:01] atmosphere difficult things or wrong
[1:08:03] things can happen you know I remember I
[1:08:07] was I was actually thinking one time how
[1:08:10] uh a couple of years ago many years ago
[1:08:13] um I was working out in um I think it
[1:08:15] was
[1:08:17] Thailand and uh I was just not happy
[1:08:21] with my with with with my location where
[1:08:23] I was working loved my job but I just
[1:08:25] wasn't happy where I was working and I
[1:08:27] remember they had put me in an apartment
[1:08:30] you know quite quite high up and I was
[1:08:33] living in the apartment so I would be
[1:08:35] working there and coming home for a
[1:08:37] couple of days going back and working
[1:08:39] there for a long time and I just hated
[1:08:41] it and as a result what happened I
[1:08:46] allowed
[1:08:47] myself to come under a
[1:08:51] negative
[1:08:52] atmosphere and you know what the devil
[1:08:55] climbed into that and I was thinking
[1:08:58] about that a couple of days ago because
[1:09:01] I realize the devil wanted to kill
[1:09:04] Taz because you see the devil knows
[1:09:07] what's laying inside you and he knows
[1:09:10] that I am not afraid of him and he knows
[1:09:14] that you know as we come to realize who
[1:09:17] we are we can tell him to go so I
[1:09:20] remember you know I remember one time I
[1:09:22] was sitting and a happened over a couple
[1:09:25] of days because I was up quite high and
[1:09:28] my room had a beautiful balcony and you
[1:09:32] know what the devil tried to do he tried
[1:09:34] to tell me T you know what all you need
[1:09:37] to do just jump off the
[1:09:39] balcony I mean I would never have
[1:09:43] Suicidal
[1:09:45] Thoughts but I allowed
[1:09:48] myself to feel so
[1:09:52] despondent I started feeling so
[1:09:57] depressed and I then contined to live
[1:10:00] under that depressive
[1:10:04] atmosphere and even when I started to
[1:10:06] pray my prayers were negative prayers
[1:10:10] not positive negative prayers so I was
[1:10:15] constantly under a negative
[1:10:18] atmosphere and the enemy then seen that
[1:10:21] and he thought hey here's an
[1:10:24] opportunity and then he slowly started
[1:10:27] to drop little seeds in my
[1:10:31] head telling me hey TS there's that
[1:10:35] balcony if you want to go home just
[1:10:38] quite high up just jump off you'll break
[1:10:40] your leg or something and they'll see
[1:10:41] have to send you home but when I thought
[1:10:43] of it I was so high if I had to jump
[1:10:47] over there by the end I would have
[1:10:48] killed
[1:10:49] myself but I had allowed the enemy to
[1:10:53] plant the
[1:10:55] thought but I am grateful to God that he
[1:10:59] came my way and he opened my eyes and I
[1:11:03] had to realize T you are not in a good
[1:11:07] space you've got to break out of
[1:11:11] that and I'm grateful to God he gave me
[1:11:14] the grace to break
[1:11:17] free and I could then tell the devil to
[1:11:21] go and then I could create the right
[1:11:26] atmosphere around me a positive Holy
[1:11:31] Ghost atmosphere and you know what in
[1:11:34] that Holy Ghost atmosphere God was so
[1:11:36] gracious he said you know what T you've
[1:11:39] had enough in Thailand I'm sending you
[1:11:41] home but I had to change my the way I
[1:11:46] thought cuz you know I'm not going to go
[1:11:49] on say something brother Bram would talk
[1:11:51] about atmospheres
[1:11:54] and you would say how important
[1:11:57] atmospheres
[1:12:00] are and you would use the example of a
[1:12:03] egg and you'll say you know that egg
[1:12:05] under the right atmosphere will hatch
[1:12:08] and you would say it doesn't have to be
[1:12:09] the mother hand there it can even be a
[1:12:12] puppy so you'll say it's important to be
[1:12:16] under the right atmosphere because under
[1:12:19] that atmosphere certain things happen
[1:12:23] and what the enemy wants to do he wants
[1:12:25] to have you live under a negative
[1:12:28] atmosphere but brother brandham comes
[1:12:30] and teaches us and I'll just drop this
[1:12:32] in for free you know many times we come
[1:12:34] into church and we think that the song
[1:12:37] leader comes and he sings the songs and
[1:12:40] we he sings and we dance and we raise
[1:12:42] our hands and we create the atmosphere
[1:12:45] and then we think that is the only place
[1:12:48] that we can create an atmosphere and if
[1:12:50] you're someone that thinks that I want
[1:12:52] you to know that when you out there when
[1:12:56] you in your car when you in your room
[1:13:00] you can create an
[1:13:03] atmosphere that is so conducive for God
[1:13:07] to move and do something special in your
[1:13:11] life and you know how you can create
[1:13:13] that atmosphere yes we sing songs and as
[1:13:17] we sing you know we just get caught up
[1:13:19] in that and we and and we find the
[1:13:22] atmosphere change
[1:13:23] but also as you know what the things
[1:13:27] that we speak but bandam says this right
[1:13:30] he says you create an atmosphere with
[1:13:34] the things that you
[1:13:38] say so that is why they always say don't
[1:13:42] talk
[1:13:43] negative because if you talk negative
[1:13:46] you creating and you're going to find
[1:13:48] yourself walkking under a negative
[1:13:51] atmosphere so when when you go out here
[1:13:54] and you go and live life speak
[1:13:58] positive if you feel it feels so
[1:14:02] gloomy or if you wake up in the morning
[1:14:04] and man it's a blue
[1:14:07] Monday speak
[1:14:10] positive if you don't know what to speak
[1:14:14] just open up the
[1:14:17] Bible read a scripture say it out loud
[1:14:22] take a song
[1:14:23] Psalm 23 The Lord is my
[1:14:28] shepherd I shall not
[1:14:32] want he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:14:37] postures man what atmosphere does that
[1:14:41] create so when you go out there and you
[1:14:43] live
[1:14:44] life and things get hard and hot and
[1:14:50] heavy and it will
[1:14:54] right it's not a flowery bed of
[1:14:57] is this is a battle it's a
[1:15:02] fight you are on the winning side but
[1:15:06] you have got to do your part and when
[1:15:10] things happen and you feeling so down
[1:15:12] and but the Taz is not there you can't
[1:15:15] text him you can't text Brother Aly you
[1:15:16] can't contact this person you can't
[1:15:18] contact that person remember that you
[1:15:22] have an author
[1:15:23] within
[1:15:26] you don't forget that and you can
[1:15:32] speak speak health over
[1:15:36] you speak happiness over
[1:15:39] you so that's what you do creating the
[1:15:42] atmosphere and then for the brandom goes
[1:15:45] on actually he says it's not even the
[1:15:47] things that you
[1:15:49] speak he says it's the things that you
[1:15:52] think
[1:15:54] have you thought of that the things that
[1:15:57] you
[1:16:00] think think just just you think of the
[1:16:03] scenario maybe you you you're in your
[1:16:07] room and you start thinking of something
[1:16:11] scary maybe in your naughty days you
[1:16:16] used to watch horror
[1:16:19] movies right in your naughty days you
[1:16:23] don't do that
[1:16:25] today well if you do be
[1:16:28] careful because you're opening yourself
[1:16:31] up to
[1:16:33] demonic
[1:16:35] influences so if you're doing it I'm not
[1:16:38] talking to you talking to the live
[1:16:40] stream if any of you on live
[1:16:43] stream watching horror
[1:16:46] movies please don't do
[1:16:49] it it's a gateway to demonic forces
[1:16:55] but anyway think of this you're in your
[1:16:58] room and you remember this horror movie
[1:17:00] that you watch in your bad days and you
[1:17:03] start thinking of things what do you
[1:17:05] think happens it's like you feel the
[1:17:08] atmosphere still
[1:17:09] changing and then you feel like the the
[1:17:11] back of your neck start the hair starts
[1:17:14] going proving that you have an authority
[1:17:19] there's something powerful within you
[1:17:21] you've just changed the at atmosphere in
[1:17:24] your room
[1:17:26] alone now you take that to the
[1:17:30] positive the power and the authority
[1:17:33] that you have in your room
[1:17:38] alone you don't need Pastor Aly to come
[1:17:41] and encourage you even though many times
[1:17:43] we do need that but sometimes in your
[1:17:46] room
[1:17:47] alone you start thinking about the
[1:17:51] goodness of God
[1:17:53] you start thinking of what he's done for
[1:17:57] you and then you find just the
[1:18:01] atmosphere starts to
[1:18:03] change and then you can't help but you
[1:18:06] just want to raise your hands and say
[1:18:08] thank you Jesus and after a while you
[1:18:12] just find maybe the tears start coming
[1:18:15] because of the
[1:18:17] appreciation that you have for him but
[1:18:21] you see you were the one
[1:18:23] that changed the atmosphere you
[1:18:28] created an
[1:18:30] atmosphere and God God has just built us
[1:18:32] that way that we there's something
[1:18:35] within us to do it but you see he wants
[1:18:41] us to be
[1:18:44] submissive he wants us to
[1:18:48] surrender everything to
[1:18:51] him in you know this word this revealed
[1:18:55] word we call it we say the message of
[1:18:58] the hour this message is telling you and
[1:19:04] is
[1:19:04] transforming you into something
[1:19:09] powerful but we need to Just Surrender
[1:19:13] we need to allow God to teach us and
[1:19:16] show us how to walk under an atmosphere
[1:19:20] brother Brandon would call it of
[1:19:22] surrender
[1:19:24] and then he says here in the fundamental
[1:19:26] foundations of Faith he says I've seen
[1:19:29] people who just couldn't even come for
[1:19:32] healing so he says I've seen people
[1:19:34] coming to the meeting there's a prayer
[1:19:36] line and they just can't make it to come
[1:19:39] into the prayer line he says but he says
[1:19:42] they're just sitting there in the
[1:19:43] meeting like you are and he says they
[1:19:47] would go
[1:19:49] home he says after being
[1:19:53] submissive to the Holy Ghost so they'll
[1:19:57] sit in the
[1:19:58] meeting and brother Michael would preach
[1:20:01] the
[1:20:02] word and we would sit there and we'd be
[1:20:06] so submissive and we'd receive the word
[1:20:11] brother brandham says this people they
[1:20:13] go home they come into the meeting not
[1:20:17] well they sick he says they sit in the
[1:20:20] meeting and they are some m
[1:20:23] to the Holy Ghost he says and then they
[1:20:26] go home and be made perfectly made whole
[1:20:32] and didn't even realize
[1:20:35] it the power of
[1:20:41] submission to the
[1:20:44] word so let's you know just cultivate
[1:20:49] that kind of
[1:20:51] attitude in Our Lives as
[1:20:54] Christians in our walk with God let it
[1:20:59] be a walk of
[1:21:02] surrender let it be a walk of
[1:21:06] humility let it be a walk of
[1:21:10] submission to him because in that walk
[1:21:14] of submission and in that walk of
[1:21:17] humility he just gives you Grace to
[1:21:21] overcome
[1:21:23] I'll give you another testimony one day
[1:21:26] I was driving in my
[1:21:28] car and uh there was this demonic
[1:21:33] force that was just plaguing
[1:21:36] me it was just man it would get me down
[1:21:41] every time I would try to resist I would
[1:21:46] try to fight it but man it would just
[1:21:50] get me so this one day I'm driving in my
[1:21:53] car in Cambridge which is where I
[1:21:56] live driving in the town I'm alone in
[1:22:00] the car and I start talking to the
[1:22:04] Lord and as I'm speaking to God and I'm
[1:22:09] saying Lord I'm just tired of
[1:22:12] this I want to overcome father it's just
[1:22:16] this thing is just breaking me
[1:22:19] down as I'm
[1:22:21] talking without realizing it I was
[1:22:25] creating an atmosphere in my
[1:22:29] car and then all of a sudden as I am
[1:22:33] driving I feel the atmosphere in my car
[1:22:40] change and then and I can't explain
[1:22:44] this then I just found
[1:22:49] myself
[1:22:51] speaking it was like I was sitting in
[1:22:54] the passenger seat looking at Taz
[1:22:58] driving the
[1:22:59] car and as T was driving the car words
[1:23:04] was just coming out of his mouth but
[1:23:07] this was words that was addressing the
[1:23:10] specific demon that was plaguing me but
[1:23:14] it was words of authority that just came
[1:23:18] out it just came out and when it was
[1:23:23] done I was so weak my wife is testimony
[1:23:26] to this and I came home and as I came
[1:23:30] home I was staggering and I came into my
[1:23:34] lounge and my wife came running tell
[1:23:36] what's you okay and I said just wait a
[1:23:38] minute I'll tell you later and I had to
[1:23:40] go rest but since that
[1:23:44] day that demon never bothered me
[1:23:51] again so you know you know what there is
[1:23:53] an authority and you have the ability to
[1:23:57] create an
[1:24:00] atmosphere an atmosphere of
[1:24:03] Deliverance and for me it didn't happen
[1:24:05] in
[1:24:06] church I'm not saying it mustn't happen
[1:24:09] in
[1:24:10] church but for me with that battle I was
[1:24:13] going through it happened with Taz alone
[1:24:18] driving is
[1:24:20] car and God stepped into my
[1:24:25] car and brought a Deliverance but you
[1:24:29] see I wanted to
[1:24:31] surrender I wanted to submit myself to
[1:24:34] him and I was just sick and
[1:24:38] tired of this thing that was plaguing me
[1:24:42] and that's why I said Lord I need help
[1:24:47] and I said Lord give me
[1:24:50] Grace and he gave me Grace
[1:24:53] and that same God is
[1:24:56] available I mean I know I'm I'm it's
[1:24:58] like they say you're preaching to the
[1:25:01] choir cuz you know these things right
[1:25:05] but I I don't want you just to know
[1:25:09] these
[1:25:11] things I mean it's good to know these
[1:25:17] things but I want to ask
[1:25:20] you you know all these for many I think
[1:25:23] all almost all of us grew up in the
[1:25:25] message right I think so is there anyone
[1:25:27] here that has not grown up in the
[1:25:30] message anybody okay sister L brother
[1:25:33] add them but the majority of us you know
[1:25:35] we so we know the message
[1:25:38] lingo we know the the the the certain
[1:25:40] quotes that we quote that makes people
[1:25:42] go
[1:25:44] wow but don't yes these things make us
[1:25:48] go wow and it makes us go man this is
[1:25:51] amazing but let that
[1:25:55] quote become a reality in your
[1:26:01] life let that quote become personal to
[1:26:09] you and if it's not you say God lord
[1:26:14] Jesus give me
[1:26:18] Revelation because Lord I'm hearing all
[1:26:21] these quotes
[1:26:22] I'm hearing these amazing things that
[1:26:26] the preacher
[1:26:27] preaches but lord I can't identify with
[1:26:32] it yes it makes me excited and it makes
[1:26:36] me feel good but Lord when I'm out there
[1:26:39] I don't know how to use it in my walk
[1:26:42] with
[1:26:44] you let him know
[1:26:47] that because he's a friend that Stith
[1:26:51] closer than a
[1:26:53] brother he's a God that wants you to
[1:26:59] grow so you just let him know say father
[1:27:03] I need
[1:27:07] Revelation
[1:27:09] Revelation is so
[1:27:12] key and it's so
[1:27:16] important now there's anyone here that
[1:27:20] doesn't know really what Revelation is
[1:27:22] and this ank is not that clean but I'll
[1:27:24] just use it anyway you know Revelation
[1:27:28] is something that's hidden so you can't
[1:27:31] really see what's under my ank here but
[1:27:35] if you say Lord I don't understand you
[1:27:38] know that there's something here I don't
[1:27:41] understand can you reveal it to me see
[1:27:45] what he does he comes and he takes away
[1:27:47] the
[1:27:48] hanky and he shows you what it really is
[1:27:54] and then once you see and you realize
[1:27:58] what it is man it just does something
[1:28:03] within you brother brandham uses the
[1:28:05] words and I think I'm going to try to
[1:28:07] quote it he says you get
[1:28:11] stimulation of
[1:28:14] Revelation because now you realizing man
[1:28:17] is not just God sent a prophet or behold
[1:28:21] I send you Elijah the prophet but you
[1:28:24] realize that this is for me and it's
[1:28:28] transforming my
[1:28:29] life and it's
[1:28:31] personal very very
[1:28:37] personal but he wants
[1:28:39] us to
[1:28:41] surrender he wants us just to give
[1:28:45] ourselves over to
[1:28:48] him and it's not a difficult thing to do
[1:28:53] we just need to within
[1:28:56] ourselves make a
[1:28:58] decision and say
[1:29:00] Lord I'm not just singing the song All
[1:29:04] to Jesus I
[1:29:08] Surrender lord it's not just
[1:29:11] words cuz many people just sing the
[1:29:16] words but Lord I want you to see in my
[1:29:20] heart and father I want you to see that
[1:29:23] I want to just fully surrender to
[1:29:30] you and he sees that
[1:29:33] desire and then he comes and maybe you
[1:29:36] don't know how to do that
[1:29:39] surrender but he comes and then he will
[1:29:43] guide
[1:29:44] you it's like brother brandham would
[1:29:47] talk about a little I think he talks
[1:29:49] about his son or a little boy he says
[1:29:52] the little boy is wants to put on his
[1:29:54] jacket right so now he's putting his
[1:29:58] jacket on and he's trying to put the
[1:30:01] spot in right and he's he's struggling
[1:30:04] he can't find it where's where is it
[1:30:07] where is it I need to put my my arm in
[1:30:09] here but he says then what happens Mom
[1:30:12] comes and Mom comes and takes your arm
[1:30:17] and Mom then takes it and Mom guides it
[1:30:20] guides it to where it must go and then
[1:30:24] Mama helps you and then you can put the
[1:30:27] jacket on now what needed to happen for
[1:30:30] that boy right he needed to allow
[1:30:36] mom to take his hand and to guide his
[1:30:41] hand to the right
[1:30:43] place and then he needed to allow mom to
[1:30:48] then just put it and then he could put
[1:30:50] his jacket on
[1:30:53] and then he could look as nice as I'm
[1:30:55] looking today right but he need thank
[1:30:59] you
[1:31:02] but yeah I've dress with the suit today
[1:31:04] with the
[1:31:06] Michael but you see he needed to
[1:31:11] allow mom or dad to take his
[1:31:16] hand and to guide
[1:31:19] it and that's what God wants of you in
[1:31:23] me he just wants us
[1:31:25] to allow
[1:31:28] him that's
[1:31:30] all not
[1:31:32] resist not say no I can do it on my
[1:31:36] own but just say
[1:31:40] Lord I I want to give in i i brother T
[1:31:46] and the ministers keeps on telling me
[1:31:49] and telling us about this the this
[1:31:52] message and about this word and about
[1:31:56] the Holy Ghost and about you know the
[1:32:00] overcoming power and I can't I can't
[1:32:04] identify with that about you know I'm
[1:32:07] I'm I'm I'm a conqueror and and there's
[1:32:09] an authority within me I don't see it in
[1:32:11] my life but Lord I want to see it Lord I
[1:32:16] want the Holy
[1:32:18] Ghost it's about s
[1:32:22] friend that's part of you know we know
[1:32:25] there's there's many other things that
[1:32:27] that you know that that play some part
[1:32:29] in our walk with God but the Lord laid
[1:32:32] on my heart the burden of
[1:32:37] surrender that's what he wants and as we
[1:32:41] just allow him to take our hands and to
[1:32:46] to to move it in the right direction he
[1:32:49] comes and he'll teach you now test
[1:32:52] this is what you need to do T this is
[1:32:56] even how you must
[1:32:58] pray he wants
[1:33:01] surrender the resurrection of J's
[1:33:04] daughter brother brandham says now if a
[1:33:08] person completely surrendered to the
[1:33:11] devil will give him twice his
[1:33:15] strength what will a
[1:33:18] man
[1:33:19] completely surrender it to God
[1:33:24] Doo you see when
[1:33:28] you
[1:33:29] totally surrender yourself to
[1:33:34] God you can reach the
[1:33:37] point where the devil doesn't know what
[1:33:41] to do with
[1:33:43] you because then you'll say man I kick
[1:33:46] them here man I threw this temptation
[1:33:50] here at them I did this and I did that I
[1:33:54] tried to make them depressed I tried
[1:33:57] this but I just don't know why they just
[1:34:01] happy Christians they just love the Lord
[1:34:05] and you know what is worse they are
[1:34:08] encouraging others to serve the Lord
[1:34:11] because because at that camp they were
[1:34:14] told we are in this together and I you
[1:34:18] know what is so horrible those young
[1:34:20] people took those words seriously and
[1:34:23] when they went away from the camp they
[1:34:26] continued to support each other they
[1:34:29] continued to help each
[1:34:32] other because they decided to be
[1:34:35] surrendered to God why did they do that
[1:34:39] that's what the devil would
[1:34:40] say but I want to encourage you not only
[1:34:44] now yes now as well it's like these
[1:34:47] words that I use uh I heard one time
[1:34:51] somebody
[1:34:52] says if
[1:34:54] not
[1:34:56] you then
[1:34:59] who
[1:35:00] right if not
[1:35:04] here then
[1:35:06] where if not
[1:35:09] now then
[1:35:12] when so it's
[1:35:14] here it's
[1:35:16] now and it's
[1:35:19] you and we all have to make this
[1:35:21] decisions in
[1:35:23] life and I trust as you know brother
[1:35:26] Brandon would say as you if you want
[1:35:28] Faith preach faith and I believe the
[1:35:31] Lord just laid on my heart to preach
[1:35:35] surrender and I believe that tonight we
[1:35:38] are in an
[1:35:40] atmosphere of
[1:35:42] surrender we
[1:35:44] are in an atmosphere of
[1:35:50] influence because is as we sitting here
[1:35:55] surrendered I know I'm looking at you I
[1:35:59] can
[1:36:00] see I can feel that there's a surrender
[1:36:04] to him and as we're sitting and we
[1:36:09] surrendering we allowing him to help us
[1:36:14] to speak to us but the random in the
[1:36:17] maniac of gdar and I'll finish off
[1:36:19] shortly he says you just submit yourself
[1:36:22] to God one
[1:36:24] time and just heal your whole self to
[1:36:31] God your everything your
[1:36:35] emotions your
[1:36:37] feelings your struggles just yielded to
[1:36:42] God and brother brandham says watch what
[1:36:47] takes
[1:36:48] place cuz when you submit those things
[1:36:51] your your your struggles and the
[1:36:54] weaknesses he takes it and we heard
[1:36:56] brother Michael speak of it he takes it
[1:36:59] and he gives you the
[1:37:01] strength to
[1:37:04] overcome cuz you
[1:37:06] can
[1:37:08] overcome it's not
[1:37:11] impossible it's not
[1:37:14] hard God is able to help you overcome
[1:37:19] I'll read you this buzzword quote
[1:37:22] but it's not going to be a buzz word to
[1:37:24] you right pmo's Vision but the brandom
[1:37:27] says a
[1:37:28] man fully surrendered to God is
[1:37:34] omnipotent not only men sisters as well
[1:37:38] a sister do you know how powerful you
[1:37:41] are a sister and there are some sisters
[1:37:45] here totally surrender to God you are
[1:37:50] omnipotent and that word omnipotent
[1:37:53] means you are
[1:37:56] invincible you might look at me and say
[1:37:58] ah really for the is yes you are
[1:38:03] invincible
[1:38:06] Unstoppable no devil can stop
[1:38:09] you but the key is surrender yourself to
[1:38:17] him the musicians can come and then I'll
[1:38:21] I'll I'll just um close of with with
[1:38:25] with this quote
[1:38:30] here and whatever the Lord lays on your
[1:38:32] heart to play you play it
[1:38:35] musicians God bless
[1:38:37] you brother
[1:38:40] Brandon in the
[1:38:42] message the
[1:38:45] absolute I this this was really a
[1:38:48] tremendous encouragement to me
[1:38:54] because many times you feel
[1:38:56] sometimes that you're all
[1:39:00] alone you know you can be in a room full
[1:39:02] of
[1:39:05] people and you can still feel
[1:39:13] alone brother bandam would tell us an
[1:39:16] experience that he
[1:39:18] had he says where where the he that the
[1:39:21] enemy manifested himself this
[1:39:24] demon manifested himself to brother
[1:39:28] brandham and he would tell brother
[1:39:31] brandham
[1:39:33] things and brother brandham says after a
[1:39:36] while he was accusing
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:41] me and he
[1:39:43] said you have no power with
[1:39:47] God you're just a bluff William Brandon
[1:39:51] you're just a
[1:39:53] bluff you have no
[1:39:58] power and I know that the
[1:40:01] enemy tries that with
[1:40:04] you tries that with
[1:40:07] me tries tries to tell us you know
[1:40:10] that so we made mistakes and we slipped
[1:40:13] and we
[1:40:15] fell and he tries to keep you
[1:40:19] there I preached the sermon one
[1:40:22] time I titled
[1:40:24] it
[1:40:27] guilty and then I
[1:40:29] said
[1:40:32] repentance and then I said
[1:40:36] forgiveness and
[1:40:39] freedom now the enemy wants
[1:40:42] to keep you there
[1:40:47] guilty cuz we but flesh right
[1:40:52] and we do things we slip we fall we
[1:40:56] stumble even by the Tas I'm also 50
[1:41:00] years old like brother the
[1:41:02] Al I make
[1:41:05] mistakes but I don't allow the
[1:41:08] enemy to keep me there as
[1:41:13] guilty because you see I am
[1:41:16] living in an
[1:41:18] atmosphere surrendered
[1:41:21] to
[1:41:24] God now the brandom says the enemy came
[1:41:27] and tried to preach to
[1:41:29] him and tried to tell him William
[1:41:32] brandham you are a bluff you've got no
[1:41:37] power but you see brother the Brandon
[1:41:40] knew who he
[1:41:43] was so he could go and he said I
[1:41:47] said Satan you an offense to
[1:41:52] me get out of my way in the name of
[1:41:56] Jesus
[1:41:57] Christ brother brandham says and he
[1:42:03] left now that was William
[1:42:07] brandham now we've also heard these
[1:42:09] things about William brandom was the
[1:42:12] first wave
[1:42:14] sheave to show that there is more
[1:42:19] coming
[1:42:21] so this
[1:42:23] Authority didn't remain with William
[1:42:29] Brandon this
[1:42:31] Authority is laying within
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:38] you but we also don't play with the
[1:42:42] devil we need to know that we
[1:42:46] know so as I'm going to I'm going to
[1:42:48] repeat myself one of the keys is
[1:42:51] live a surrendered
[1:42:54] life to our lord
[1:42:57] Jesus and then you will be able to tell
[1:43:01] the
[1:43:02] devil Satan you an offense to me get out
[1:43:08] of my way in the name of Jesus
[1:43:12] Christ and he must
[1:43:17] leave and brother Brandon goes on this
[1:43:20] is off the enemy
[1:43:22] left he said I laid there a little bit
[1:43:24] in the bed and I started to raise
[1:43:27] up he says I felt a real sweet
[1:43:33] feeling come over
[1:43:36] me you know what as the music is playing
[1:43:38] and as you receiving the word I feel
[1:43:42] that we are in a such a a beautiful
[1:43:45] atmosphere he
[1:43:47] says I felt a real sweet feeling come
[1:43:53] over
[1:43:54] me I
[1:43:56] thought I wonder if the Holy Spirit now
[1:43:59] is
[1:44:00] close and then he says over in the
[1:44:04] corner so help me he said here is my
[1:44:08] Bible over my
[1:44:10] heart he says the sweetest
[1:44:14] voice I ever heard in my life said
[1:44:21] don't fear to go
[1:44:23] anywhere and don't fear to do
[1:44:27] anything for the never failing presence
[1:44:32] of Jesus
[1:44:35] Christ is with
[1:44:37] you wherever you
[1:44:40] go so as we going to be leaving this
[1:44:44] meeting and as we going to be going
[1:44:47] maybe later on a couple of days later
[1:44:49] and we go go often we live
[1:44:52] life I want you to
[1:44:55] remember and I want you to
[1:44:58] receive that the never failing
[1:45:03] presence of Jesus
[1:45:05] Christ is with
[1:45:07] you he wants to help you he wants to
[1:45:12] guide your
[1:45:14] hand so that you can put on that
[1:45:18] jacket but he wants you
[1:45:21] to be
[1:45:23] surrendered to
[1:45:25] him as we just bow our
[1:45:29] heads Lord

[1:45:35] you this evening
[1:45:39] tonight my God for your
[1:45:43] presence Lord Brother brandom makes the
[1:45:46] statement he says that the spirit
[1:45:51] follows the
[1:45:54] word and my God tonight I do believe
[1:45:58] that the
[1:45:59] word was
[1:46:02] preached and my God I
[1:46:05] believe that the never failing
[1:46:09] presence of our Lord Jesus Christ is

[1:53:33] saor I
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:40] Surrender Hallelujah just beautiful
[1:53:43] beautiful special sermon
[1:53:46] tonight I mean there's something I I
[1:53:48] want to want to say that it's it's
[1:53:51] something that has really helped a lot
[1:53:53] of people when I when I shared this
[1:53:56] thought you know
[1:53:58] sometimes we I wonder if I can just ask
[1:54:00] you to say take your seats for a
[1:54:04] moment sometimes we have things in our
[1:54:08] lives that we that we want to get rid of
[1:54:11] I'll just take this out
[1:54:15] closer you know whether it's a besetting
[1:54:17] sin or a struggle or a battle or a mind
[1:54:19] battle or you know hurts from the past
[1:54:23] that your mind constantly goes to and so
[1:54:25] forth and you say you want to get rid of
[1:54:30] it and you actually think you want to
[1:54:32] get rid of
[1:54:33] it but many times there's something
[1:54:36] subconscious sub subconscious that
[1:54:39] actually doesn't want to get rid of it
[1:54:41] okay and and and that is a real
[1:54:45] challenge you know some let's just use
[1:54:47] pornography as a as an example but
[1:54:49] there's you know it's kind of the the
[1:54:52] Practical example of the moment but you
[1:54:54] know sometimes we want to get rid of of
[1:54:58] the you know the feeling afterwards when
[1:55:01] we feel all dejected and a failure and
[1:55:04] all those things or we want to get rid
[1:55:05] of the the impact on relationships we
[1:55:09] want to get rid of the
[1:55:11] effects but actually subconsciously we
[1:55:13] want to hold on to that dopamine effect
[1:55:15] and the and and what it does for us and
[1:55:17] there's actually and it's a real
[1:55:18] struggle it's a real tough place to be
[1:55:21] and it can be like that with you know
[1:55:22] with hurts um and it's a really really
[1:55:27] big thing that the enemy can catch us up
[1:55:29] with because we get preached we need to
[1:55:32] forgive
[1:55:34] people and then the enemy brings into
[1:55:36] our minds things that happened years ago
[1:55:39] that we still hold against those
[1:55:41] people and part of us wants to forgive
[1:55:46] them but there's something on the inside
[1:55:48] that wants to hold on to that thing and
[1:55:51] now why am I saying all of this
[1:55:54] sometimes we need to ask God to help us
[1:55:57] surrender now sometimes sometimes we
[1:56:00] literally have to go on our knees and
[1:56:02] say Lord give me the want give me the
[1:56:05] will to want to
[1:56:08] surrender you know and and many times
[1:56:10] I've say to people start your prayer
[1:56:12] there you know if you've prayed over
[1:56:14] thing over and over and over again then
[1:56:16] change your prayer maybe and change your
[1:56:18] prayer and say to the Lord Lord Lord
[1:56:19] please give me the will to surrender
[1:56:22] please remove that want to hold on to it
[1:56:25] out of my life amen and that makes such
[1:56:29] a big difference you know many times
[1:56:31] like I said we we we we actually we
[1:56:34] can't really fool ourselves but we to a
[1:56:36] certain extent we do we think we want to
[1:56:39] get rid of something but there's
[1:56:40] actually something that holds on
[1:56:42] surrender is such a big thing and we and
[1:56:45] we need to to find I want to say it is
[1:56:49] really Grace when we find that place of
[1:56:51] surrender you know it's not mind over
[1:56:53] matter I'm sorry it doesn't it doesn't
[1:56:56] just lie in the human uh ability to Just
[1:56:59] Surrender by ourselves because some of
[1:57:01] those things are anchored Way Beyond
[1:57:03] where our our human Minds can reach it's
[1:57:06] actually deep down built into the I want
[1:57:08] to say nearly the spiritual DNA of us in
[1:57:11] a way you know subconsciously it because
[1:57:14] like brother Michael described also this
[1:57:16] morning those those things have formed
[1:57:18] New Paths in our minds and we think in a
[1:57:21] certain way and we and we justify
[1:57:23] ourselves to
[1:57:25] ourselves amen and we need to to have
[1:57:28] the Lord's Grace to surrender those
[1:57:31] things um sorry let me
[1:57:34] just so so I want to encourage you pray
[1:57:39] that the Lord gives you the want to get
[1:57:42] rid of your problem to the one to
[1:57:45] dedicate your life to
[1:57:46] him you know I I I believe with all my
[1:57:49] heart as you sit here you want to
[1:57:51] dedicate your life to the Lord I
[1:57:53] honestly
[1:57:55] do but there's possibly something still
[1:57:59] in some of you that that desires the
[1:58:04] applaud of your friends that that wants
[1:58:09] the tough guy attitude or that wants the
[1:58:14] attention of the guys if you're a girl
[1:58:16] and vice versa you know that and that's
[1:58:18] the basic at at a really deep basic
[1:58:21] level amen and and I want to say ask God
[1:58:25] to help you to surrender that
[1:58:28] thing I'll read a quote to you here from
[1:58:31] God in Simplicity brother bam says when
