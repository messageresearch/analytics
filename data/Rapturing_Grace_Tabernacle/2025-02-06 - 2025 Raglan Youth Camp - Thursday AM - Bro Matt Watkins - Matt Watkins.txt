this morning I just want you to turn to 2 Samuel CH 23:8 we just begin reading God bless you I'm going to to try to um just be as good as I can about my time and leaves very uh little time but that's all right just um just a little introduction today I I am in jeans and I've never preached in jeans so this will be a first for me but um we just uh had very little time to prepare and so uh you just forgive me this morning I I just wanted to feel casual anyway and be more uh just an opening service knowing that um I I do believe in miracles I want to make that clear but it would be a miracle for me to be able to preach uh in this little bit of a of a short time frame so we are at 8:15 so we have 45 now brother bandham said a good preacher will keep his sermon about 30 40 minutes so I learned a long time ago I'm not a good preacher but um my name is brother Matt Watkins for those of you that don't know me um uh I am from Buford South Carolina we got two uh young ladies here know very well and they are from my home uh country there in the United States and so I also brought with me my wife uh Rachel who uh is uh is is going to be here throughout the rest of this camp and also a good friend of mine uh brother Travis Jackson and his wife Deborah and then their little baby so we brought a little group with us um I am from Buford uh South Carolina way on the East Coast uh very much like this area here right on the coast and uh I have four kids I call them kids but my oldest is 21 and uh he just got engaged um just a few days ago so he's not here none of them were here but I so I would show pictures but I didn't have time to get them sent and I have a a a daughter two daughters and another son amariah uh Zoe and Ethan so um my quiver is full and I still consider myself a young person and and I am still a young young person I'm just not as young as you but I'm not as old as uh brother ALR and that's all right so somewhere in the middle so uh I'm still young I'm young at heart amen praise the lord well we we want to um we want to go to the scripture here and just have just a few things to say and then maybe just start a theme throughout um the rest of this Camp I would like to just ask just at the beginning and the opening here how many came with an expect ation something specific not just generic to say I believe the Lord's going to move that's wonderful but I wonder did you come with a specific need something on your heart and you you just could say this is what I'm praying for well if you don't have that how about you do that now how about you identify now before we start Why Don't We Just Close Our Eyes together anden we'll just open with prayer and I wonder if there would just be something as we just take a moment and you take inventory and and that's a good thing to do and you know brother brandham said that unfortunately is the case that so many times it takes crisis in our life for us to take inventory and really assess our own life and he said sadly that's what it takes sometimes so so maybe here we are and we could recognize with every head bowed that we're here in this moment and and we're here you you you you at the end of the day that's a victory you you made it you made it to camp and you you you may not feel like you're where you should be spiritually and you don't feel like you're on top of the world but I just want you to recognize small victories you're here you're in a youth camp you're in the The House of the Living God amongst God's people and God can do anything for you and so just at this moment while we're all in our all of us have our bodies Our we are we have our minds about us our wits we have an opportunity it's another fresh chance another fresh moment as the prophet said each generation has a chance uh at a Revival a chance at the word so here's your opportunity and I wonder if maybe if we could just look at our own lives introspectively and as David said in the Psalms as I thought on my way I turn my feet towards his testimonies so could we just for a moment just at the opening of this camp we think on our ways think on our lives and just for a moment we could maybe identify something and say Lord this is what I want out of this camp this year and maybe we just raise a hand and identify just by an uplifted hand if you have something specific and say Lord this hand that I'm raising is just representing God bless those hands this is representing Lord what I need you to speak to me about about Lord Jesus you see the hands up father my hands up now Lord as we just open this Camp open this first service Lord God doesn't take much time to do this Lord as we all father are so keenly aware of our own life our shortcomings our needs father that the needs Behind These Hands Lord would be too many Lord to Father the time that we have to to identify Lord Jesus but I'm so glad that you before we ever raise our hand Lord you already know our frame you know our makeup Lord father you remember that we are but dust Lord and beyond all of the layers and all of the layers and the facades that we all have Lord I believe that behind that hand is a Heart Lord that just wants to be closer to you Lord a heart that just wants to Father know you in a more real way a more personal way Jesus I pray that you would just have complete control Lord God direct my spirit my mind father Lord I I've waited on you now these months Lord and weeks leading up to this pulled Lord and so many directions and so many burdens you've placed upon My Heart Lord but I I just want to even identify my own need with my hands raised Lord how much I need you God now to come and use me Lord use the gift you you placed in my life I pray father speak and minister to every need every heart May We Go From This Moment Lord changed not who we were when we came Grant it Lord now we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you second Samuel chapter 23 and verse 8 I'm going to speak to you just with a little bit of time that we have and I just give maybe just a little bit of um personal about me just a little bit of moment for Testimony but at the same time just in this as some of the foundations of what we'll speak this weekend I want to take a theme for this whole weekend and the theme would be he cares that's just the way the Lord dealt with my heart the whole weeks leading up to this as I just laid before him I just kept coming back to this this word that this phrase he cares and so if the Lord would be our help we want to just demonstrate that through his word but before we we uh let's just read our scripture here in 2 Samuel 23:8 I want you to notice here because Samuel this writer is going to list the men the Mighty Men Who were with David now we know that David we know the story in the life of David he was a mighty man of God he had great many things written about him in the word in fact there's fewer men that have more of a three-dimensional look at their life not just the high times but also the low times the mistakes that that he made and the Bible says that we these things were written for our examples but I want you to notice because it's going to speak of different around surrounding David was different categories and categories of men and there was something particular about them that made them or separated them from the rest of the people in David's Army I'm going to use the word men but that's all right because we're all sons and Daughters of the king and we all have a commission upon our life and we all have an anointing upon our life and we all have a purpose for our life and God's purpose is for you to find that purpose in that he's placed before the foundation of the world your journey is all about finding the center of the will of God for your personal life and the job and the objective of Satan is to disrupt that and to derail you and put you on a different path so let's look at it here in verse 8 these be the names of the Mighty Men whom David had the taconite that sat in the seat Chief among the captains the same was adino the eite now listen to what he did here in verse 8 he lifted up a spear against 800 whom he slew at one time and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the ahite so you can be the son of a dodo but still a mighty man somebody say praise the Lord one notice here because it says here one of the three Mighty Men so I want you to pick up on something very quickly David had an entire Army an entire group of soldiers are an army that was trained these were selected men but within that Army there was a group of what was referred to as the Mighty Men but even Within that Circle there was a smaller group called the top three these were the three mightiest of all of them and Eleazar was one of them notice here and when they def he says one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were going away he arose and smoke the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave upon the Sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil after him was sha the son of age the harite and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled but notice he stood in the midst of the ground so here was one of the marks of a mighty man he can stand alone when everybody else is fleeing he stood all by himself and S the Philistines notice in verse 13 three of the 30 Chief went down let's just move on past this because David we know is is in a hold there in the Garrison and he Longs and says all that one would give me a drink of the Waters of The Well of Bethlehem and notice verse 16 and the three Mighty Men broke through the host of the Philistines and Drew out water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate took it brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink it but poured it unto the Lord notice there and he said be it far from me oh Lord that I should do this is this not this the blood of the men that went in Jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it notice these things did these three Mighty Men it goes on to list others in verse 19 and it says was he not the most honorable of three therefore he was their Captain how be it notice how be it he attained not unto the first three so it was awesome that he was named among the Mighty Men but he never attained to the level of the three bah look at it here in verse 20 son of jeia the son of a valiant man of cabil he had done many acts somebody say acts now how many remembers that word in your New Testament Bible he had done many acts and he slew two lionlike men man I've seen a lot of really bad guys Bad Dudes but I've never caught anybody man he's lionlike but this man faced men in his life that were lionlike that's what the scripture says here and he he says two lionlike men of Moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit and the Bible gives this detail in the time of snow and he slew an Egyptian a goodly man that goodly means huge and the Egyptian had a spirit in hand but he went down with him with the staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian hand and slew him with his own spear these things did bah the son of jeod and had the name among the three notice let's look at verse 23 he was more honorable than the 30 praise the Lord but he attained not to the first three and David set him over his guard it goes on to list these in and goes all the way through in verse 39 euriah the hittite 37 and all you can be seated this morning I want to just stop that here for a moment because to unpack that would just we'd be out of time and so Lord will and will'll go further into that this evening but I want to talk to you here for a moment just about these Mighty Men of God and I'm just going to go quickly through this but we know that there was within David's Army categories of what we would call greatness based on what they attained or the acts that they performed in their life you know it would have been a powerful thing just to be named that I was in the army of David but could you imagine that within that Army you'd have a secret service or maybe just a special operations unit and you in somehow in your life you had a quality or some part of your character or some ability or something that you did and as David was going through resumes and he was looking at you know resumés of people and things and accomplishments that they did and here he's trying to find his mightiest men and he comes over this man bayah and he reads about bah and it says this man bayah here's his resume he went down into a pit on a snowy day and he slew a lion with his bare hands and David said that's the god that's the guy I want over my my my my my select group or my select Army we know that Within These categories of greatness beyond the 30 there was also the top three these were the top three the greatest out of all of them you think well brother Matt that's just in the army of David how does that apply to us today well we're told in The Book of Mark chapter 4 it says and these are they which are swn on good ground how many remember the scripture such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth notice the categories here some 30-fold some 60-fold and some 100f so you mean that within the parable of the sewer the seed which we know the prophet of God told us that seed represents the word of God and it was cast on to four different types of humanity or soil and only one of which was considered good ground it's amazing because the word Goes Forth in the entire universe and the entire world and the entire world can bring forth different fruits or different evidences of the Life of Christ you take Christian Science and brother bham said that they had some of the greatest fruits of the spirit that you can see love and meekness and Temperance and they were self-controlled and you know they were kind and they gave to the poor and you'd think my goodness that's a that's a great fruit you know of the spirit of God and the prophet of God even in early in his life is is saying what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost what is the evidence that a person has truly been born of the spirit of God and the prophet in his own human thinking his natural reaction or reply was love it would be love how do I know that I'm born of the spirit of God it would be that I love because what's the greatest weapon the prophet says God ever gave to man in one place he says it was love but he says the Holy Spirit stopped him and corrected him and said no no no it couldn't be love though love is a fruit of the spirit yet the because the Christian Science had more love than any of the other denominations any of the symol of God people they had more of the humanity the human aspect of the life of this of Jesus yet Christian Science denies the deity of Jesus Christ so brother bam says well then what would it be how do I know that I'm truly born of the spirit of God it must be some gift some external gift of speaking in tongues the prophet says that's what the Pentecostal Church went away with I in order to say that you're truly born of the spirit of God you've got to have some outward manifestation and in the book of Acts they had an outward manifestation of speaking in tongues so it would mean that to be born again you've got to speak in tongues and the prophet says that sounded good but it couldn't be because he says I've seen Witch Doctors those that would drink blood out of a human skull speak it an unknown language and another would interpret it and you say that they would be born of the spirit of God and the prophet says no well then it couldn't be that then what would but I I just want to pause here for a moment brother brandham was not doing away with love hello come on somebody uh we have a show back home it's called Judge Judy and it's it's it's uh if you ever heard of Judge Judy she has a famous statement when she's talking to a plaintiff she says mhm is not an answer answer what is our answer amen amen so so notice here what I want to point out to you is that brother brandham was not doing away with the fruits of the spirit he weren't saying he was not saying that they were an Evidence he was just saying they were not the evidence of the Holy Ghost now if we can believe that he wasn't put in the way love then we must also believe he was not all he was not putting away gifts either he was not diminishing love nor was he diminishing speaking in tongues but he was saying away with experiences for a measuring line you must come back to the word of your hour because you can say that oh I would have defended Jesus and if I lived in that day you know when the Roman soldiers were crucifying him man if I would have lived there brother Matt I wouldn't have been in that crowd saying crucified him I would have been on his side I would have standed stood for him I would have defended the Lord Jesus and brother says now that's good big talk but he says I can tell you what you would have done in that day by showing you what do you do with the word revealed for your generation and it will identify what you would have done back there so notice here there's different categories of greatness because even within all of the so the word that was swed across the whole world what did it bring forth it brought forth denominations it brought forth Assemblies of God Church Church of Christ Church of God Presbyterian Anglican pres uh uh Catholic it brought forth all of this ground but yet within all of the manifested universal church yet there was only one ground that was called good ground yeah but even within that good ground I want you to notice there was different categories of Effectiveness or fruitfulness within the within the product that was brought forth can we look at it here again in Mark chapter 4 and if you have a Bible I want you to stay with me as close as you can uh Mark chapter 4 and you could just hold your place there and we're just reading for verse 20 but it says that some brought forth 30 some 60 some 100 and so it shows that only one out of all of the ground was considered good ground even in this productive fruitful fertile another words potential to bring forth the Life of Christ let me close that Loop the prophet of God says then what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's it's being able to say Amen to every word of God that's one way he says it another way he says it this way he says it is the proof that your life comes subject to the word for your hour it is believing your day and its message not just a mental asense saying I believe it because the Devils believe and tremble but it's the ability to bring your life subject to the word so notice this here because even within this productive fertile potential in other words we could say seed of God elected predestinated before the foundation of the world even within that ground even within that soil it's amazing and no worthy that there was different degrees Yeah of fruit bearing denoting different categories of Christian the Christian Life Jesus says in St John I think it's chapter 15 and he says every Branch notice every Branch all of them every Branch Jesus says in me that beareth not fruit how many remember this scripture he says he takes it away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it brings forth more fruit and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit fruit fruit fruit what is the objective of the holy spirit in your life to get born again well that's wonderful but is the Lord done when you're born of the spirit of God ah we just put our feet back and you know stick them up on the Ste and we'll put it in cruise control we just cruise on to the coming of the Lord oh no no it's nowhere near complete but you see the holy spirit's activity even those even to the born again and when I say born again I I I don't mean Justified I don't mean it varying degrees of sanctification I don't even mean just the gift of the Holy Ghost meaning in your flesh but even those that are sealed born again which means to be baptized by the holy ghost means to be born again even within that group of the elected Quicken seed yeah yet there is still an operation of the Holy Ghost in your life purging out your old nature purging out your old self for this purpose to bring forth fruit can you say amen and so notice here this is the highest category and and and and and this is he says except a corn of wheat you know this in John 12 except a corn of wheat die fall into the ground and die it Abid alone all by itself but if it dies then it brings forth much fruit so I want you to notice here because out of all of these men there was different categories of spiritual greatness I'm feeling the pressure of that clock now so let me just pause that can we can you freeze frame that here for a moment and I want to tell you that within all of these men you say how did they ever make this lists how did they ever I'm going to give you some principles if you have a pen and paper you can you're welcome to write it down I don't have time to unpack any of these I'm just going to say them and then we're going to Lord willing will be able to preach them how many know that brother bandam said character is not a gift it's a victory there's no Victory without a battle and so there was something about these people we could call it the marks of a mighty man what made him different what separated him from the rest of the pack what was David looking for and I'm going to give you some of these what I've labeled and the Lord's given me as marks of a mighty man one of the marks of a mighty man is that his core and his Center not the facade not what you see out here in front but at the center of his being at the core and the center is one desire to be in the presence of the Lord all the days of his life he has also one of the marks of a mighty man is that private Victory is more important than public victory yeah in other words a lot of people love to have the outside looking good but man the inside's just a mess one of the marks of this Mighty Man is that he has victory in his private life you could think of David and The Lion and the bear will we'll get to that later another Mark of a mighty man is that he's a giant slayer yeah David wasn't the only Giant Slayer but courage breeds courage and he was actually surrounded by other men who slew Giants another uh another Mark of a mighty man is that he can discern the anointed word for his age another Mark of a mighty man is that he isn't Fearless did you say that right brother Matt look back at your note make sure you said it right hold on we're talking about Supermen super women did you say that right yeah I did Mighty Men of God mighty mighty women of God are not Fearless they actually are people with great fear but they face their fears in fact one of the marks of a mighty man is that they depend their life they depend on the words fear not you see most Christians never have the luxury of his is a powerful statement I wrote down I took it from a just a little oneliner I read in a little devotional book that I have most Christians never have the luxury of hearing the word from their father saying fear not child because they never attempt anything great enough to Merit that command now fear we know is the beginning of wisdom how many know that and we know that the Bible says he's not given us the spirit of fear so you could spend your entire life fearing the wrong things in fact Satan's job is to get you to spend your life suffocating under the fear of what will happen and you're actually fearing things that will never take place in your life and if the devil can get you so paralyzed under that fear and he'll get you spinning your mind over something that'll never take place never actually happen it's a figment of your imagination so let me give you some of these fear knots and you could just remember these if you want to write them you better write quick cuz I got to say them quick fear not the attack of Satan but rather fear that you never make Satan's hit listow fear not the unknown but rather fear that you never find out what's beyond the unknown fear not a life with dark trials and tests some that will bring you to the brink of life itself fear not a life full of sorrow and trouble and trials and a cup of pain and distress but rather fear you say brother Matt I'm not to fear that type of life no the life that you ought to be fearing is a life of ease and complacency to where you're just rocked asleep I'm in the message I believe God's in a prophet and the devil says go to sleep go to sleep what to sleep little baby I'm I my mom and dad were in church I was raised in church I'm okay here's another Youth Camp just another opportunity meet my friends fear that type of life you see one of the greatest things the devil can put on you the prophet of God said if you didn't he says it's not cancer but it's the fear of cancer one of the greatest things that brother brandom said that Satan could put on on you is fear you say what is fear brother Matt fear is a distressing negative sensation I'm just reading this straight from Brother Wikipedia he's a good brother sometimes it's a stressing negative sensation induced by a perceived threat it's a basic survival mechanism this is fear occurring in response to a specific stimulus such as pain or the threat of danger fear is the ability to recognize danger leading to an urge to either confront it or flee from it also known as the flight or fight response in extreme cases of fear a terror or freeze of paralysis response is possible you know they they they they they bottle this made they made this bottle this up really easy to to identify that flight or fight um you see people will always respond one or two ways they'll either face it or they'll run from it and so they had a man in a dress uh not dressed but he was a man that was just uh hidden I should say in a trash can and and and he just hid down inside it there and so they had you know guys and uh going over and you know to take out the trash and they'd lift it up and man he'd just you know jump out and it was amazing because they had a super slow motion camera on the face of these big oh man guys just atess men just big you know tough looking guys and they'd walk over to there and they'd and you could just see the slow motion cameras they and they would just those big old guys man they would shrink and they'd fall backwards you know screaming like girls and most all of them did that and you can just see you know the out Outer veneer is really not an identification of the the real man that's on the inside but then this little old guy man he was just a little scny guy he walks right up there and he opens that thing and that guy it was just there was no fear was an instant [Laughter] bam he just gave was the natural reaction if you come at me you're going to get that kind of reply it's amazing because there's this is the fight or flight this is how we respond to fear some of the most common fears according to surveys some of the most common fears is the fear of ghosts the existence of evil power cockroaches do you have cockroaches here spiders some of y'all sisters says Heen some of y'all brothers would too if you were honest snakes some of the greatest fears is the fear of heights the fear of water some people fear water enclosed spaces tunnels Bridges needles social rejection failure greatest fear fear failure exams but of all of the fears that were listed the greatest fear that people uh Express that they have it's amazing you say what is it what is the greatest fear the fear of public speaking the fear of speaking out in public isn't that amazing that the greatest thing that the devil an attack is the ability to respond with your voice because the Bible says let the redeemed of the Lord say so Hallelujah you see there's something so powerful about using the voice God gave you to speak in fact your words when you confess it and when you speak it have the ability to freeze it and change the situation and atmosphere around you just your words will do that not thinking it but speaking it that's why it's so powerful that we don't just gohm but we say Amen it sounds so natural you know so what's the lord's spiritual and though the but the but but to the Greek mind that's true everything's just all either spiritual or natural but to the Jewish the Hebrew mind the natural and the spiritual are directly connected and brother Adam says the natural always types the spiritual right so your voice what did Brother brandham say in Jehovah Gyra when he's telling about the squirrels and sister Hade writes there and her two boys and brother Bram says sister Hattie I don't know what it was other than Jehovah Gyra and brother Bram says she spoke up and says Amen brother brandham that's nothing but the truth and brother brandham says when she spoke those words not thought him not just held him in but when she spoke those words she brother bam says it felt like the room was going to come apart and he says it moved Heaven my goodness when she spoke the words amen she agreed with the word and brother brandham says the voice of God spoke to him and says you tell that sister Hattie anything she asks for right now will be granted to her now what would have happened had she bottled that up and not let it out right say brother Matt that's CH that's really Elementary well it might be but why did Jesus spit on the ground why didn't he just heal the man but he bought up some some Earth and he put it on the man why did non have to dip in the not one time not two times not three times why was it why did brother brandham have to speak to the storm why did sister Hatty W have to speak and say Amen why was it that brother Welch brother Banks Woods is brother brandom and he picks up a stone he throws it in the air he did something physical and when he did something physical there was a supernatural reaction in another dimension you see this is how God has made us the natural types the spiritual and so one of the greatest things the devil can put on you is fear and one of your greatest weapons that you have to fight that fear is the voice God gave you to speak out and say Satan you're a liar Satan you're a bluff Satan I identify the spirit that's trying to affect me and I'm going to declare you're a liar and my God is is the God of all gods and so we have nine minutes praise the Lord and so it's amazing because that's one of the greatest fears is the fear to speak in public the fear to express the fear to name it or speak it out I I I think it's so powerful such a powerful thing that even within even within the Jewish uh culture even today and you'd look at hidic or uh what they call heric Jews and they pray reading Torah and you could watch them as they move and they move like this they don't just statically you know you know just read it very mundanely you know intellectually but they believe that when they read the word of God it's a supernatural Dynamic experience and they've got to interact with the text that they're that they're reading oh if we'd ever treat our Bibles that way I believe we'd get something more out of it that what you're reading when you read the word of God is not just a text that was written 4,000 2,000 years ago but it was actually it's actually a living organism it's a life it's not a thing it's not a Doctrine the message is not a Doctrine it's not a dress code come on somebody it's not just a way of life it's not a lifestyle it's a person and my question is do you know that person not do you know about him not do you know the message not do you know the quotes not do you know the dress code not do you know the right things to say but do you know him him him that's the most important thing we can know is him more than about him it's good thing to know about him but to know him personally for yourself what is the evidence what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother brandom would say it this way it is the Revel of Jesus Christ to you personally amen can we stand at our feet this morning we just laid a little Foundation Lord that's all we had time for and that's okay maybe that's all you needed this morning Lord just to express some of these things Lord I could already feel the the the urging Lord
