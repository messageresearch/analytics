I want to say if you're sitting here right now feeling that the world owes you something or that everything is sad or whatever take a moment to think of the name of Jesus and what he's done for you amen Hallelujah we have no reason to be sad I'm not denying that we go through hard things and so forth but when we when we just get a little bit of perspective I mean we can see that that there is

that that we uh that we I mean I I'm sorry I'm just going to be super blunt but you know I'm not measuring our spiritual spirituality on you know how much I can sit through a three-hour sermon and I blah blah blah you know that's that's all nonsense right but what we want is if each one of us can take one thing out of every service right then we've then we've got value for money right so so this

[Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] father you kept us through you gave a lot of Grace father you brought us through father you have a purpose in our heart father you blessed us father we had difficult times that's true like our most Dumber Brothers said not every day was Sunshine but you brought us through father because it was your grace it takes us home father so father for this evening may you speak again deep in our hearts and that's our brother said maybe it's just one point that really triggers us and helps us and anoints us for our daily walk father so we put everything into your hand bless the minister father give him wisdom give him the right words that bless our ears to understand the right thing father father bless the church back home in Germany may you be with them Father the Sheep the Eagles over there and may you bless Israel father from that point out we want to say shalom Israel May there be peace in Jerusalem father because those who bless Israel they are blessed father Lord we thank you Father and ask it all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you richly and thank you very much for for the musicians God bless you let us open the word of the Lord while we're standing in the second book of Kings chapter 4 verse 32. second book of Kings chapter 4 worth 32. and when Elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed he went in therefore and shut the door upon the Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child waxed warm then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his words we may be seated so I really want to greet you for the as far as I understand the last service for this year that we have together is that is that correct yes and uh I really want to bring you again the greetings I see some of the brothers and sisters uh came here new and I wish you all from our hearts God's blessings and I would love to enter directly into that mystery of the shunamite woman and I'm hoping that we understand we were talking about us and um got quite some a lot of compliments for the preaching of this morning and happy for this uh and I want to say this we have to understand one thing we are just a team that plays together I mean I got inspired by about the Adrian's uh quotes about about the theophany and I got inspired by Abra Murray about his his video that he made about timepieces of God I mean how often did I see this how much was it revealing the plan of God for me how maybe I won't even mention in some of the preaching some of the sources but the dean told to me you know that that I didn't forget when we were talking sitting on on the couch together and so we are just team and uh uh as I said the winning team because I always call it the Dream Team God's dream team and I would love to enter directly into the word of the Lord if it says fine for you and uh make a little teaching about it and a little help for each and everyone uh not to to to to lose too much time and uh as brother said the brother said I will not be long but long enough [Laughter] so I thank you again too that you have uh Grace with me with my kind of humor you you have more patience than my wife and my daughter they always say papa you are so embarrassing I said hey I'm cool I'm hip [Laughter] so so so um from the service from this morning it's quite an interesting subject and I and I come just enough I put off my jacket a little bit later um a little bit of the old school please please I said I will purposely on Monday I will have a blue shirt only that you see another German anymore huh but but I'm a little bit of your old school white shirt and all these things but this is has nothing to do with the message this is just the traditional Lutheran okay but but I would purposely I come I would change on Monday about it okay so I'm converted into a true uh to New Zealand I will not start with the Haka huh I was not starting that service like this okay but so I said today this morning it's quite interesting the time that I was talking about was the time between the day of Pentecost and the first church age remember it's a mystery because there's a quota brother REM said the Ephesian church was not seduced they were not deceived but they left the first love and there is no contradiction to what I said this morning because we were talking about the time before the Ephesian Church Ephesus Church because brother blame said or the the every Bible reader says the day of Pentecost was 30 up depending on the calculation 33 after Christ A.D brother Ben starts the first church at 53 so in between about 20 years that was already the fall of the church and Paul came to church was already a fallen woman okay and remember that brother blame said when the Holy Spirit felt the Antichrist Philip fell exactly at the same time and we always thought for many many years that the church fell at night cruel my brother Remy said a different time it fell at nicely around but in the seals he said it fell in the beginning but it was crowned at night it fell already there but the crown it received a nice year room so so just if if somebody reads this you have to really put it into the right right order and and I would love this afternoon again speak to your heart okay and I would love to to to to to to to to speak about our Heavenly fathers something that we have in common um normally when I'm preaching I realize that we have quite a bunch of young people here okay and whenever I make a teaching I have always a sequence of talking to the young people and when I'm talking to the young people I always have a sequence of teaching uh so that everybody I love that everybody can go out and say I got something okay for you as the youngsters we never be please never be frustrated if a minister prepares a service that he takes weeks and months and weeks and months for that okay so nobody expects for you to go out and repeat everything that was said if you get five percent that's perfect that's perfect just get the picture because the next one will build upon that same Rock I'm a remember there's a lot of thinking a lot of praying a lot of reading to put just into 90 minutes okay and and so uh uh but we are adding to our faith all these things so the story of the shunamite uh of Elijah and the shunamide starts with a story that the prophet Elisha was in Israel in Israel they didn't like their Prophets by the way they were extremely respectless to them and we remember that Elisha was Elisha was it Elijah that went through Israel and these young people made fun about it called him bald heads brother Branham was a young man and he had a problem with his hairdresser and the hairdresser put some liquid on his head so he became bold it was not the problem of the headrest it was God ordaining the man to do the wrong thing because brother Ben was typing the Prophet Elijah therefore he was bold on his back and what happened is these youngsters they made fun of the Prophet Elijah and the prophet was so much in Anger that he called a she-bear and killed 42 of these youngsters and brothers said it was not the fault of the children it was the fault of the parents the prophet said what the parents said behind the curtains that's what the children said on the streets that is what I was telling this morning if you want to teach your children something teach them to respect people teach them to respect Ministries even if you don't agree fully but put a man of God into God's hand God will take care of him we nobody needs your commentary your comment nobody needs my command be sure of that God will put everything into it into the right channel even a minister is growing never forget he's growing in his ministry he is growing in his Revelation he is he is just amen so what happened is I remember we had a we had a brother in our church and everybody was Jezebel everybody the kindergartens were Jezebel the school teachers were Jezebels the neighbors everybody was Jezebel and one day the neighbors a true story one day the neighbor was ringing at the door and the little boy opens the door he said Papa Jesse Bell is at the door so so that happens if we if if we don't pay attention that message taught us feeling taught us respect amen because if somebody let me say you see a bump on the street you see a uh somebody who's who's living on the street brother Graham said he might be nothing for us but he is a son of a mama and maybe he's a daddy of a little girl for us he's nobody for that little girl she's he's Daddy amen never forget that every human being is made in the image of God whatever he believes whatever he is you cannot produce a bride a bride comes from the presence of God she's part of him so what happens is that that uh that that the Prophet Elijah he just went to a city and he seems to make a miracle and here is that shunamite woman and her husband and they see what the Prophet Elijah did and they had Grace enough to invite the man into their home amen Elijah never had a t-shirt by the name of prophet Elisha but somehow God opened the eye of that woman to see who that man was it was the same holy spirit that opened your eyes things in the in the economy of God are Supernatural remember when the Prophet Elijah came to that widow woman from sabraptor the Bible says I commanded a widow woman the Bible never said she had a dream she saw a vision she heard a voice but in her subconscious God acted through her that she made the right decision maybe she didn't know what she was doing but it was God ordaining her when a when a person gives his heart to the Lord be sure it's not her head it must be her heart his heart have you ever seen when there was some kind like a calling and your heart was faster than your head I mean that was my conversion I was faster at the altar than I thought that I could I could think about that that is that little piece of God that he placed in our heart responding amen so he didn't just say that woman oh that's oh that's man and God bless you we were blessed they were they were entertaining that profit to come into their home now what she did she was preparing a room for him here we are again in the tent Vision that little room which is prepared we are waiting that God does tremendous things but we are not expecting another public show that must be so clear we don't expect another Pentecost Revival because brother Graham is that the Revival is over but he said the bride did not have her Revival yet that means it will be a Revival but different than we had it in the past don't look for some Pentecostalism because you might look in the wrong corner and God does tremendous things but it doesn't fit into our program amen so she prepared a little room and brother Brian said this it doesn't have to be a cave it doesn't have to be a special room but it should be a place in our hearts where God can come and go whenever he wants to take inventory I remember I was a young boy newly converted to the Lord and I love the Lord and I do it more than I did in the beginning and I'm sure I'm talking to people who feel exactly the same way exactly the same way we're not brandemites we are Christians we love the Lord Jesus with all of our hearts huh and what happens when I was reading that story of of of Christmas then I found out that when Mary arrived over there in Bethlehem there was no room every Inn every every Hotel was closed you see that God is in humor God knows what he does Amen in the time of Jesus all the hotels all the Inns were closed we're full and he had to go in some some kind like a like a cave amen so that Christ could be born when the seals were open the later part of brother Branson's Ministry the churches were closed amen but what did God open the hotels I mean because the Christian businessmen they were not gathering in churches they gathered into hotels so most of our greatest sermons that we have the choosing of a bride Ramada Inn amen great Services holiday in Tucson amen Cafe Bowl so-and-so I'm in Clifton's Cafeteria the choosing of a bride God left the church and went into the hotels God knows what he does amen he takes whatever he can so when I was reading that story I was just praying I said Heavenly Father you have no place in in laodicea I realized that but in my heart I want to give you praise Amen Let My Life be for your glory and for your honor if I'm a middle I never thought that I would become a minister but that has nothing to do let me be just a Christian and show to the world that this message is not a theory this message is Christ himself can you say Amen so so so they opened there's room for the prophet and for gehazi and let me start by this there is nothing that you can do for God unless he pays it back it's nothing whatever you do God remembers it God is your Rewards brother this message is not Social Gospel please do not expect everyone always clapping on your shoulder how good you are and how happy we are that you came to church thank you very much we are free you do these things for your own sake hallelujah amen because after some time after some years it was not that woman going to the Prophet Elijah and saying look man I mean I come all these here to church I pay my tight things I do this I'm the one who has to clean all the time I mean where is now my reward that was not her attitude and it was not even the prophet said look I mean what can we do for that woman how much she was always so nice but it was God's remembering what she did and God spoke to the prophet speaker whatever she wants and remember that's the same God speaking to Hattie Wright thousands of years later the same attitude caused the same God on the scene [Applause] blessing is not a question of Doctrine blessing is a question of attitude towards god brother you can be wrong in your Doctrine but if your heart is right God brings you on the way but I've seen sometimes people they were very strongly adopting but they had an arrogant spirit and God will not bless this absolutely no so we see how God really remembers and I want to show some examples about this and we will then we go a little bit in the in a deep teaching about it you help me the brothers exactly so I know that I was preaching that subject years ago when I was in New Zealand I know about that I know I'm over 50. and I'm forgetting many things but I'm writing down what I was preaching therefore I know the titles but we will change it a little bit this is such a good group such a good atmosphere that we can bring in a little bit on a higher level a little bit for eagle's food okay definitely so yeah I'm pretty sure that here is quite Eagles together now this is Eric Liddell Eric Lindell was a young minister in the time of the beginning of last century and what happens is that he was a believer in I think in the Methodist Church whatever he was a runner and they called him the Scottish locomotive he was a fast runner his life was put together in a film by the name's Chariots of Fire so he was studying he should start in the Olympic game I think it was 1924 but I'm not positive sure Bob if you see the picture you can see definitely that was he was a Christian and he was a runner he was a sportsman so he came into two finals one please don't I think it was a thousand meters and the second one was two thousand or three thousand something like this no matter in both he came into the final race and the for one of the races he was absolutely favorite he was going for gold the second one he had not much chance but the one where he was going for gold was on a Sunday and Eric bidel refused to run on a Sunday you can call it legalism I call it revelation I call it revelation because he remembered what Sunday means for God amen so he refused and these people they are just even the government the British government made pressure on him because he went for gold but he said I will not run on a Sunday Sunday is the day of the Lord I always say this Sunday is not barbecue day Sunday is not the day to change the tires Sunday is our Shabbat it's the time to think about eternal things it's the grace of God to lay down to come to rest and to think about eternal thoughts you have six days to work the seventh day is to rest and to think about things that are higher than just work amen so he refused and got that pressure and what happened is that he then went into the final of the course of the race where he was not a favorite at all and the American trainer the American coach came and put a little leaflet into his hand and Eric Lydell is a true story true testimony he put that leaflet into his back pockets and when he was running then eyewitnesses say it was like he was energized and he was winning that that contest he made he would he made Olympic gold I mean I became later a preacher in in the Anglican church or whatever hmm so as a big surprise he he was running for gold and when he later put out of the pocket a little leaflets that he got from the American coach from the U.S coach it was a leaflet of the Bible of the book of the story of Eli and his sons and he was reading I honor those who honor me brother whatever we do we must do it by love for God the dressing we don't have a church called dress code we don't have but we have something that pleases to God if you're a Christian you have a feeling what pleases unto God and what is not pleasing unto God can you say Amen if you pay your tithesis just people who want to discuss about paying your tithing I said brother you don't have a revelation what goes along with that foreign keep your tithing for yourself but you will pay for it because there's a blessing understanding following God's rules and God will bless you abundantly I said if you want to economize money please pay your tithings he said you say I never got a cash back from God I said yes at motor that should have cracked after a hundred thousand miles God tells to all these molecules and all these I mean that man is a faithful man you run up to 300 000 miles because our God is the God of all dimensions um it matters to serve the Lord it's a question of Revelation it's not a question of legalism it's a question of Revelation whatever you do brother God is watching you every mile that you go I tell you one thing he loves to give to people he loves to give you a little gift why that because he is a father in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the the mystery of God is revealed and brother Abraham said God's mystery he is he wanted to be a father all the time a father likes to bless his children amen you say I love Jesus but you don't know how Jesus how he much love how much he loves you amen I remember God remembers those things because it's a little story but there is a truce behind and I know I I was showing it to you to the Elder one years ago when we came to the message I mean we're a little bit younger I'm I'm good in shape because I had a slipped disc in my back so I have to make bodybuilding again so that's the doctor he told me you have to do because if not we have to make an operation so but when I was young I was even more in shape so we came to the Lord and we're really honestly said whole Germany comes to the message of the hour by Marcus Becker yeah yeah brother we were we were young and we were we we had a lot of ambitions and we had a lot of naivety and God has a very nice way to take all naivety out of us he said okay my son let's let's run a little bit brother and then God takes that gold and he gives him some beatings that is part of our training amen and here we are here's Marcus vicker and today we pray dear friends we say Lord keep me on the way Lord be with me help me to please you in all things because we learned one thing without God we cannot do anything you can try to change your family you can try to put the television out you can try to stop smoking and it will not work you throw it out and it comes back later but once God takes care of his we'll never come back again now I want to tell you to your oldest older older brothers and sisters I'm more now on your side and there's many prayers that we were praying When We Were Young Heavenly Father we want to serve you we want to do this and we want to do that and and brother over the years we have forgotten our own prayers but God did not forget them for God our prayer of 50 years ago is still there time means nothing for God age is nothing for God he because he's the master of all dimension his brother his brother Billy Paul and he gives that little example and we know this but it just shows how it so matters in 2023 to say look for me and my house we serve the Lord we have no option brother Branham is there and we don't have to talk about miracles of problem because we see in a church today but not in that measure that he had for sure but here comes that little girl and and and and she is obviously she's crippled and brother Billy Paul tells the story that girl says in that little cartoon in that little um the shoes because I believe if you pray for me I can walk and brother Brahm says to that girl why don't you sit over there and then Billy Paul said to his brother Ben told her he said please stay a little bit in church so that your little faith can raise up that's the reason we come to church streaming will never replace that you can stream Marcus Becker every day it is just entertainment don't forget it it's just nice knowledge about what Marcus know you must eat the book yourself nobody will eat it for you nobody will digest it for you you must eat that book I mean thank you I was waiting for somebody say hey and after a couple of hours one or two hours uh brother Ben was just praying for the people and behind him was his brother Donnie and he was sitting behind brother Brennan when he sings in his mind and sings in his heart hey Billy forgot about that girl who was sitting there or maybe he doesn't have faith for that little girl and he wants to dismiss us and then the little girl he was not prayed for and he was just thinking in his heart and in that moment brother Brian turns around he said no no Donny I didn't forget her [Applause] something that is as much higher than and he said and Jesus did not forget her neither brother if you if you consecrate into the law and they are in the Heap your faith in what you did don't look on the circumstances Lord they are dedicated to you and you will call them when your time comes you will call them can you say Amen deaf whatever you do if you dedicate a child if you dedicate your marriage do it in faith not as a religious act and God will bless what you did okay say Amen a young girl and a young boy want to marry and say brother America's uh we love one another I have different time this kid you've taken care a little bit of young people we love one another but uh we need time you know spiritually and and I said one thing is sure but the Brahman said only born-again people can marry it's no way around forget it no way around because I was preaching this morning of giving the Next Generation a vision how can you give your children a vision if you don't have a vision yourself forget it you can just bring them to church and they will sleep in the church like you do not you but [Laughter] but I said hey if you are a teenager and there is a there is such a love between you both and this is pure it's right it's not sensual not sexual not immoral there's a true love to one another why don't you both find the Lord together [Music] and search for the Holy Ghost together and make that romance to become a spiritual union that nobody can break up it's amen God allows these things that somebody gets in love before is really born again so that both are now bringing themselves up into the Throne of God he said we come together to church and we pray together can you say amen God can take big great Miracles if we just come in the right line so please make the next okay I'll make the next one can you say Amen whatever you do you do it in love to God if we are anti-legalist don't believe that we don't know that every promise is connected to a condition that's what brother Brands says every promise is connected to a condition that we fulfill amen so I I keep that thing up but let me just talk about that little girl forgot her name but it's in the generation book and certainly you have you were reading about the sister so and so I forgot your name she said this she were they were friends with the Branham family she was friend of one of the Branham God Sarah or Becky and what happened is she liked to have high heels okay and you cannot walk unsexy with high heels there's no way about that okay if I can even I'm looking sexy with it [Laughter] with a with a little bit of fantasy okay [Laughter] but you see the love of God is never hurting people but he tells the truth that's because he's a father amen and she says I was standing at some kind of a shop with my shoes in our own testimonial generation book and brother Brandon stopped by his car and he put down the window shield he said hey um I think Norman or whatever her name is hey or the abekia I think Becky uh that's too high half of it is enough and then brother and said is think about your back foreign so in other words more healthy to have a little and look what she said she said I went home and I threw all these shoes away I was so embarrassed that the prophet of God had to tell me what what thing to wear and not to wear that was in her heart I mean can we have that same attitude to God said Lord I want to please you whatever you feel amen then the same girl in her testimony they had a little photograph photo of what they made in the school and she was in the same uh class as the daughter of brother Brian I think Becky or Sarah and what happened is they made a photo with a certain uniform and that uniform did not have any any sleeves okay and you can say okay here comes that German Lutheran he wants to talk about sleeves but ah we talk about the heart condition okay so so so that girl said I don't think that it will please unto God no I will be not on the photo amen and she said there was a lot of pressure from the school because everybody had to have the same school uniform and even brother Brown's daughter was part of it she didn't have the strength okay um what happens is that a couple times later she was in a suing contest okay and she miraculously made number two or number three in the whole state of Kentucky and a couple of days later brother Brennan phoned according to his testing a phone to her father and they were just talking the father said can you give me uh your daughter so and so exactly and she said hello brother Brandon and brother Brahm said look I heard that you were winning or number being number two on that soaring contest in Kentucky he said yes brother Branham that is just a miracle that was wonderful and then brother when he said yes remember God gave you that price because he saw your attitude with the photo God has a feeling God as a father don't try to clown with him around um he's not Grandpa he is a father and he helps his children God loves his children can you say Amen whatever you do God will pay it back to you God will be your reward I mean it's in the generation books now what happened then is this God remembers amen and you remember when when when and we will see it in the next services how God placed brother Branham in a body that he didn't like when we were coming on this Earth nobody asked you do you want to be South African or kiwi nobody asks you nobody asked you want to be male or female nobody asked you do you want to be black or white nobody asks you you couldn't even choose your own name you have to bear a name that you don't like all your world you live in a body that you don't like you try to make any kind of feeling or whatever never never works every diet that you try is not working amen amen you live in sir you came into a family that you never choose do you understand one thing our our children did not have choice to our families we have to treat them right we have no right to bring our complexes upon the Next Generation we have no right for this because our children are our brothers and sisters in reality when you're both with your children driving against the wall on the other hand side you have the same to you often you're at the same age our children are our brothers and our sisters don't never forget that but we came into a situation if God would have asked us where would we like to be born everybody would like to be a Rockefeller amen but God placed us I was born in a broken family rather I saw my father beating my mother you never forget this in your life even with the Holy Ghost you had these things come up in your dreams that's all I never choose that brother blame told about that story how he came from a family where everybody was an alcoholics amen you have a difficult background and you think yet you came wrong on Earth and that might be so but it's not so because brother blame said this God pre-planned your birth for many generations in the second world war those Germans could not kill your grandfather because your father was still in him and your father could not die because you were still in him now we were talking about our theophany amen and you have to understand your theophany looks like you brother Brahm said Meda had the same black hair there as she had on Earth amen that means who was there first your theophany or your Earth and God according to the image that he had in his mind he had to bring over thousands of years the right parents that you're looking exactly exactly therefore the natural birth is more miraculous than the Virgin births amen therefore you can say I'm a maid in a wonderful way can you say Amen therefore God wants you to be like you are amen so we think that we came wrong on this Earth but in the message sings it out to be brother Brahm said God pre-planned your birth for many generations amen if God pre-planned my birth he pre-planned my death he pre-planned my my my my my rapturing my Rapture everything is pre-planned in God's eyes therefore God could tell the minutes when married and Monroe would die and told the prophet she will die at this in this minutes keep one thing in your mind when you were when I say you I always say we okay but I'm a preacher I'm just talking to you but we talk to us okay when you were born the date of your death was already on your on your front you haven't how it called expired dates and when your time is up your time is up and I'm not against this definitely so I'm living a body I'm happy that I'm healthy and I'm eating healthy I do a lot of sport I have to because I had problems in my back I had to do this but one thing is sure you can live healthy and you can eat healthy but when your time is up you die healthy you die healthy because your time is up on Earth that means Lord let me use my little these some little ears on this Earth let me be wise David said let me be wise to know that I will die someday don't wait for the last years to serve the Lord if you're young if you want to serve the Lord do it now because you don't have much ears on this Earth anyhow can you say Amen but one thing is sure if we believe that we came wrong on this Earth be sure that you go that you leave the world in the right way and this Earth journey is only there to mold that character Amen to to mold us and to form us into the image that he has already of us in his in his great minds blessed be the name of the Lord so you see how brother Branham he calls himself until the end of his ministry he said I'm an erotic type of person and he says I'm a melancholic type of person many musicians are that we're melancholics typical okay nothing wrong with it but you have to know who you are brother it's a confession that's not easy to make um and I do not do it at home but you are far enough and I'm hoping that you're cutting the streaming but but but I was I was for many many years I was standing in my own way you know as big as I am and I was a soldier I just I was in the French Foreign Legion I made a lot of things I was living in the jungle I was a real how do you call it Indiana Jones I did all these things before my conversion but I found out in my in my mind I'm a super sensible person I'm not don't demonize me but five percent of all people are soup are super sensible you can hurt them easily and I didn't realize it for myself until I found it out that's the way I protect myself from many many things okay I cannot change the way how God made me but I have to realize that is the strength that I have and here is my weakness and brother Brian said you have to cover your weak points with prayer everybody has them you have maybe said you say I'm another type that's fine but we have our weak points we have to realize that that's me that's how my makeup made me and here is my weak point so lot protect me amen by and I protect myself by prayer so brother Brandon was a neurotic type of a person he says it in the message on the wings of a snow white death of 1965 that means he was neurotic before his conversion with the Holy Ghost and after 30 years in the minutes is still a neurotic person do you understand one is the soul and one is the psyche of a man and we were Pentecostal we never understood that principle we always thought here comes the Holy Ghost we are a new person and therefore many many years we thought we were not born again because we're looking on our flesh and did not understand our flesh is not redeemed I mean our flesh is still our face it is only made under control by the Holy Spirit but it's still a wild animal I tell you young girl a boy without the Holy Ghost is nothing else than a mammal amen a boy without the Holy Ghost nothing else in them he just loves your body he's never loving your soul he will love your soul when he's a born-again Christian then he has a spiritual Insight in certain things if not he just loves your body and you say Amen so here's brother Branham and and he is 1963 and he has this kind of spells that you always have and he goes to hunt and here comes God and he says and the voice spoke to me he said you remembered your promise I knew it was him I said yes Lord and he said so do I remember mine I will never leave you I will never forsake you that burden lifted Christian friends it has been back since that was last October I have been a different person keep your promise to God whatever you say to God you believe it separate yourself from anything contrary to this word God will hear answer prayer let us bow heads you remember that picture was made May 1963 and brother Brahm said I built up a complex now here is a man who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost since he was a young boy though he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost twice he tried to take his life that's what we never understood as Pentecostals and he still and brother brands said this he said I was not fit for that work and many let me know this brother there's two things that destroys a person too much Applause and too much criticism every Minister you and you destroy the man you discourage him so far so much by too much Applause and too much criticism amen so when when when the car stopped the voice said look to the West amen and he sees Seven Mountains and bro and God says to brother Brahm that's your life your name is written all over these Seven Mountains now I want to ask you a question when did those seven mountains appear on this Earth 1963 when God created the Earth he knew that the seventh angel is an erotic type of a person and he builded up these Hills to show that's your life that's our father knowing the end from the beginning can you say Amen and God shows to him he said look I will not take all these Hills and Valleys away from you but at the end it will end up in eternity that's what it always says for for for New Year there will come problematic situations and there will come easy life situations but if you are on the Mountaintop don't become arrogant said oh I don't understand family so and so and their children and what happened to them and they should pray more and believe only believe brother only believe that's fine but one thing is sure the next Valley is waiting for you it's already in the plan of God but if you are in the valley don't give up don't give up because the next mountain is waiting for you can you say Amen so God says I remember my promise I'm in here you see God sees the end from the beginning remember a prophet sees in the future he sees already here is The Prophet by the name of Jeremiah and Israel is taken to captivity and Jeremiah says already look gentlemen it is not very long only 70 years and you come back all right he sees in the future he says you have to go now into captivity but I see you already back in your country amen do you believe that God sees us today in the rapture therefore in the seventh seal brother Brian said I don't know if you understand what I'm telling you but I call you now bright not church anymore you say I don't know if I make it God says but I know he said but I don't feel if armor God says I know I see you there already you get it fear casts love quests all all fear you must see yourself like God sees you and then God can correct you and he can mold you he can do whatever you do but gospel is good news it's always good news every Sunday is good news because God sees already the victory at the end so here is Israel and we see when the church was scattered Israel was scattered and brother baby said why is God so thought and cared so much about that little place of Palestine see when it's just a little spot but right in there is where the temple is set that's where the New Jerusalem will break up right there Olive Mount of other shell cleave part to the right and to the left shoe when he pushes up what does you have to understand the fight around Israel is a spiritual fight it's not a geographical fight because God said that place is for Israel because here the temple will stand and when brother blame said why is God so much cared about that little place in Palestine huh then I can say why is God so much cared about that little place in your heart [Applause] because the bride is New Jerusalem Jerusalem will visit Jerusalem if you take El Al Uno El Al but we will see it anyhow one day the bride is the New Jerusalem Abraham was searching for a city and he thought just geographically is it into some or is it in Jeffersonville but brother Brahma said that city is now right hanging above us your own theophany [Music] what a time that we live what a revelation of the sons of God can you say Amen but look at this huh so Israel was completely destroyed the Temple mount everything so even Theodore herzl thought by himself we search a home for the Jews it does not have to be Palestine it could be they thought Uganda or Argentina but God says I remember that there should be there you say Amen so what happens never ever if a civilization was destroyed it never came back you take the meters the Persians the the Aztecs the Incas these Chinese uh uh the the meters the Persians uh the Assyrians ever civilization once was destroyed it never came back only one people and that's Israel after two thousand years exactly in the same spots and brother brand because and brother Brahm says this and I hope I'm not discouraging someone but please don't search for a Pentecostal Revival in this message because brother Graham said if if a Revival ever dies it never comes back [Music] but the words in the beginning brought the words to the end can you say Amen it was God leading them and now I put on this is now pure Marcus interpretation Marcus interpreter you can reject it but still love me okay but there is a quote and many people struggle about Revelation 10 because brother Brian said he goes directly to Israel when that angel comes down of Revelation 10. now that happened 1963 what was the next great thing that happened that was The Six Day War in Israel 1967. and people said that victory was miraculously it was not the arms and look what it does the seventh seal is complete silence but complete silence doesn't mean that everybody is sleeping complete silence you do something that the enemy doesn't be aware of but there's great activity in great in in great silence you know how the sixth day well the sixth day was one on one morning the whole Air Force of the of of Israel went and they were flying below the radar and they could not be detected and in between of one hour 45 minutes the whole Egyptian Air Force was destroyed amen amen miraculously I mean not and and the thing was this the the general at that time was Moshe Dayan amen and you have to understand natural types to spiritual amen as the Pentecostal Church got their leader with one eye by the name of Seymour I'm an Israel got their Leader by Moshi Daya the man with one eye bringing these people back to the temple mounts [Music] and Moshe Dayan said this when we are destroying our enemy not one time we will have any call between the airplanes total silence until the last plane is destroyed amen so there was total silence Seven Seals but total silence does not mean God is sleeping God does great things but he doesn't explain it to everyone because this is the time of Romeo and Juliet and when you take the bride you will not tell everybody that you're now at her window and taking her home and you would surely not tell the parents I you get it it's a tremendous time right now but it's different than we thought it before God does not make any show can you say Amen so what a Time amen hallelujah do you love the Lord can I continue now with a little teaching is that fine for you I mean I'm I'm look I mean here I want to prove by the Bible why God will not forget he cannot forget amen now let me explain you with history just some minutes this is Constantine and Constantine was one of the rulers in Rome at that time Rome had an Eastern part in the western parts remember this morning we were talking about the early church and we are now in the time where Judaism is now going down I mean and Christianity from a little sick the first Christians they were thought were Jew they thought they were Jews with the Holy Spirit but now Christianity comes into a state religion because God has in mind seven Church ages hmm we have now two rooms East Rome and West Rome and in these little Easter and Western we have two schools of thoughts amen I don't know exactly which one we have the school of Alexandria and we have the school of another school amen one says Jesus was divine and one says Jesus was just an adopted man he was a human being he was a man and both have quotes of the Bible one school said he said at the cross why did you forsake me so he could not be God it must have been a man the other school that the other the other school said yes but Jesus said if you see me you see the father he's God and we find out how brother Brian brings it together he was 100 God fully God and was fully men definitely so but we have different schools of thoughts very prominent in the first three centuries arianism and the other school so that's not a problem in itself but now God wants to continue with Christianity and he brings this man Constantine and he is now fighting against the next Caesar in Rome now the night before he has his fights in Rome he sees a sign or he hears a voice it says in Hawk seek no vinces that means you will win in under this sign Constantine is not a Believer he doesn't understand that religion but he believes the dream that he has for he has that the vision that he saw during the day and he puts on the shields of his Fighters a Christian cross and he wins the battle at the bridge of mileage amen he now becomes the Emperor of a whole room so he is not a Believer he is not a Christian but he's a businessman amen he he feels now that the god of the Christians has more power than the God of all the rest so let us all become Christians okay and what he does he says I'm now the highest priest pontifex Maximus what the pope became later so he says to all of his people in the 4th century Christianity now becomes State religion now Christianity from a little Jewish sect overnight becomes now a big religion for the whole Roman Empire and at the same time Judah is now declines more and more definitely so hmm but he's now promoting his new religion he says we have a great God and his name is Christ and he's so powerful that I had a vision I saw the cross and he is now the god of our room so please teach that Doctrine to all of our Heathen worshipers because this God is not a god beside the rest everybody is a Christian that was that was Constantine but one thing is sure here you have two fundamental difficult different schools of thoughts fundamentally different and the Heathen priest would have said hey we would love to receive Christian doctrine but these Christians don't know what they believe themselves because one says this and the other one says this let them first find out what they believe that was the beginning of the nicer Council of Rome that is the reason because he said if we have a state religion we need one Faith one belief because if they don't know what they believe I will never convince my my my my my worshipers so Constantine came to nicaea and he says look I'm not interested in your religion you find out whatever you want at the end I want to have one solution one Doctrine and brother blame said the true Christian should have not gone there young people please understand so there are certain things in our life where God says you should not even go there amen no it's no need for you to go there a young brother wants him to spoke with me um it goes too far so what happens they now sorted out and the question is this it seems to be difficult but I make it very very easy if Jesus is divine he's part of God then he is Godly if he is just a man who was now adopted and he is just human exactly so they find out Jesus is divine he is God as the father is God that means that was the beginning of the Trinity Doctrine because later they found off is Jesus if God and the father is God and the son is God then the Holy Spirit must be God too the treaty Doctrine is more tricky than sometimes we think because it makes more sense than a false one one God Doctrine that was the question is now Jesus same person in Greek you say homo uzios r-e-c-a creation of Gods I mean from now on you put on your spiritual jacket because I speak about the bride there is a difference between a creation and a birth I can create many things but I only burst one daughter I can create many things but it's just an object but the thing that I burst part of me is in her amen foreign he said so he first was got Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there was nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that means that logos was part of God that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the Father the logos was part of God that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dweld Among Us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God so God didn't create the logos but the logos was part of God that come out of him and God looked to his son and his son looked to his father amen amen same person no two Gods no no no two godheads in the three in in there's no Trinity there's no same person it's like you take a spoon of water out of the ocean you have ocean in your in your teaspoon same substance only another dispensation the Sun comes out blessed be the name of the Lord therefore and you put on your spiritual jacket brother Graham said the first thing and here we have brother brother uh brother Murray's presentation you remember brother Murray brother Tony when brother Bremen said the first thing that God created was angels she quote brother Brennan amen and he said here's a comp here's the contradiction it's not contradiction because the logos was not created the logos was burst the logos was part of God the Ancients were not part of God they were created like like planets you see the difference between something that was versed if if I giving birth to my own daughter you understand through my wife but in my in my daughter it's part of my DNA Part of Me Myself is in the next person but I can create a puppet or whatever but that's just creation God created angels but he burst a logos it's a big difference big difference the Eternal thought and you put on your spiritual decade the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal if you can see this you will see many things oh if you see this you can see many things you don't see it you don't see much in the message you just you just send see God send the prophet but if you can see this you can find your origin and your origin will be your future brother Graham said if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable both in essence and behavior and so on and he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God [Music] you believe the prophet can you say Amen you understand why God came to set the prophet in our time none of the prophets ever could see Farah than William Branham Moses could just say in the beginning he could see the creation John could say in the beginning God John could see the logos in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God he could see that moment but brother Brian could even see right before the beginning nobody could look farther than him and we needed to understand that is our origin amen so the thoughts of God is not like we are thinking thoughts of God are part of God Eternal already just to be here to become manifested nobody can preach you into the family of God and nobody preaches you out of it can you say Amen you are born on this Earth Jesus said I'm born for a purpose I have to become a light for for the world you can say the bride can say I'm born for a purpose to find my father to find my mother to fight my eternal destination and to become a further part of God's revelation for my time my purpose in life is not to make money my purpose not to build a house my purpose is to come home to become redeemed to come back in the family from where I came from do you see the difference between the church and the bride let the rest find Salvation whosoever come let him come but only the the family of God was in the mind of God now I stress you that is my question are you created no I was birthed when in the beginning when the logos came out of God why this can you say Amen that is now the part not for the teenagers that is now that is not among ministers if you don't say Amen direct number that is that is real ministering but I spoke the first part was for you okay amen but but but brother Brands showed in the Bible says he says Eve was in Adam we know this and I said what I said two days ago a sister said to me when Eve and God took Eve out of Adam he took the best part out of the man I said okay I disagree with that but but she was yeah took some seconds there oh you didn't dare to laugh because he was sitting beside you [Laughter] but do you realize the woman never got a name she was just woman when God came in the Garden of Eden called Adam two people came because they were both called Adam amen he called Adam two people came when God speaks about Christ he speaks about the bride the same time [Applause] nobody will know only Christ in the bright so if Christ knows I will know too because I'm part of him so brother Brahm even said he said we were so much in him that we prayed for our own sins at the cross quote brother Branham so if we were in Christ then we were in Melchizedek because Melchizedek was Christ before in what form Ever God knows if we were in Melchizedek we were in the pillar of Fire the logos that came out of God and when we were in the logos we were in God right in the beginning we come from God and we go back to God nobody will step us nobody because we are predestinated brother we have a Heavenly navigation system in our soul that takes us home sometimes we make a lot of nonsense in our life but the navigation system says new calculation new calculation goal but the end goal is already programmed by God in what form Ever I will not enter into this because then I'm I'm I'm I'm going I'm just going to see how God remember we can speak about the angels we are not do okay but you put on your spiritual jacket okay in what form ever what forever brother Graham said quote brother Ben God in the beginning was alone with his thoughts have you ever had said in other words he wasn't alone in other words he wasn't alone he was alone with his thoughts [Music] it doesn't mean God was thinking he was alone with his thoughts what is his thought it's his family [Applause] nobody can preach you in brother no no wonder this message is to reach for denominations they cannot handle that that means you make yourself God I'm I'm just Marcus from Germany but deep in my heart amen I'm a new creation man therefore you don't become an eternal being by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have already part of God in your soul therefore the Holy Ghost is it's part you must receive it sooner or later because God ordained you together can you say Amen now you behave like your father so you understand a real bride cannot have complexes if we have these things because we do not know who we are but God doesn't take time it does take time you know to bring it as a slope and it's one thing but to soak that thing so deep into your heart you say that's me you come for the first time into a village the message of the hour and you have never seen a mirror on the denominational nonsense and here you go and you say hey hey hey he said Mama that's me that's what the message did with us we came into the message I'm happy to be safe and to be safe and then we were reading you would say hey that sounds familiar that's what I said and don't know in what form but we believe all the Miracles in the ministry of brother Branham because in what form Ever we were there when the creation was made and we remember somehow that was exactly so therefore brother Brian said God blackened out our minds so that we forget therefore you can have spiritual amnesia you can only have spiritual Amnesia if you once you knew who you were if not you can't have amnesia I mean but God just closed our eyes we came onto this world and he would say I'm so happy to be a kiwi and God says that is just your natural birth but deep inside of you is a mystery which is revealed at the end time can you say Amen therefore therefore always said Esther the Queen of Heaven Esther who who buried death that great uh King by the name of of forgot the name but he's there amen who what was the name of ahas for us Esther had two names one was her Earth's name was Esther means star but your true name was Hadassah brother you have two names one is on your passport but you have another name deep and soon your personality is not key we are South African you are a Christian deep in your hearts a son and a daughter of God can you say amen and God takes away that Amnesia from us therefore Esther had no father and she had no mother amen that reminds us to Melchizedek who had no father and he had no mother [Music] we are living here for 70 years on this Earth but in US is a mystery it's a seed of God coming from eternity bringing us back from where we come from this is not Harry Potter this is the truth can you say Amen only the messenger could bring these things to us because it was not in reformers age it was not the time but this is the time of the Capstone this is the time as I always says amen I'm here you have loudest here now if you see my passport you just see Marcus and brother Brian said he is loud he's here speaking in tongues this is Pentecostal age 1906 then the eyes God sent the prophets I mean William Branham is this the end program said no the intelligence comes brother Ram says there's no sound when the intelligent comes but it's there you recognize Who You Are you unless you find your position um you know one thing if I'm getting that job or losing that job if my brother betrays me or not I'm the inherited my inheritance is eternal anyhow I mean somebody's betraying you somebody steals your position in the church somebody steals this somebody somebody betrays you with car whatever you can just say okay in this whole world is my inheritance anyhow I remember one time years ago I came to the US and and and I came in the plane and Air Force One was Mr Obama came so we had to stop and he came with his plane Air Force One in in Dallas not Dallas in Atlanta so I was winking but he didn't Wing back and I thought by myself Mr obana your time is limited but my time will come do you understand on this Earth we're doing simply I'm a janitor at home a janitor simple things but at the same time God is molding our character because on the other side our ministry starts our ministry is not to be the man of the hour our ministry is to reign in the Millennium together with Christ and God is just changing our exploding our character because character might without character is satanic can you say Amen amen and continue amen God cannot forget you did someone of you ever felt that God forgot you somehow or he is a little bit too late have you ever felt like this I'm the only one okay fine some others somehow God did you did you just Overlook me but he cannot Overlook me take Heat said Jesus in Matthew that you despise none of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven and so on and so on and so on amen I know what you know what now comes amen I'm questions and answers please Brothers explain about Matthew chapter 18 verse 10. that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven what is the answer turn to Corinthians 5 if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved you know what it is if this earthy Tabernacle is his hope we have already one waiting all right what is the brother braam said that's our theophany every funeral we are reading this for a funeral why shouldn't we read this for life I mean why should we wait for our funeral to read this and to say this is my inheritance this is my true being amen that is the answer and he continues he said and now notice because their Angels always behold my face which is in heaven you see in other words they're Angels they're Messengers their bodies Angelic bodies that they will go to if they die are always before my father's face in heaven that means my angel is my theophany game Hallelujah in other words this part of me is always beholding gods in what form Ever it's the body in which I will enter when I die amen amen therefore there's no bad news for Christmas Even if you have cancer if I have cancer we can say death where's your sting honestly where's your sting it is sometimes difficult to die but death for a Christian is nothing Billy Graham even said if I die don't don't cry don't mourn I just changed my address that's what he said what can we say as the bride blessed be the name of the Lord therefore young people it matters to serve the Lord amen hallelujah their Angels behold their faith and now you understand one thing I mean when Jesus when he had to bypass and he had to come to Samaria there was a little woman amen and brother Brandon said this and you put on your spiritual jacket okay who has a jacket with you somehow without the boys you put on your jacket okay spiritually okay amen brother the Bible says he had to come through Samaria and brother Ben explains because that woman had a representation of the thoughts of God whatever it was for me it was her theophany but this is Marcus I don't have a quote for if you have a quote let me know but this is my interpretation she had representation of the thoughts of God but what does it mean she did not get representation because Jesus passed by Jesus had to pass by because she had representation the new birth doesn't give us a theophany we had the theophany when we were born and we must be born again to fit into the ethiopathy God makes sure that we make it can you say Amen and the bride will not be lazy okay I can drink I can smoke nobody preaches that but you cannot force yourself into yourself and you have it you are born with it that's the greatest gift that God could give you blessed be the name of the Lord so what happens is that the name of the Lord is just so wonderful that there is something of you whatever you want to call it something of you some part of you you're positive let me call it like this stands in the presence of God and reminds him God cannot forget you because your angel is always beholding and you remember that brother Graham said only the elect have angels amen so you're not alone so brother Brennan was not the messenger who invented tea of theophonies he did not invent them but he was a prophet who could see in the other dimension and he would say by glorified body is now standing right here on their platform charging me like a battery nobody else could say this amen so if you walk you're never alone somebody who has no Revelation who is who is in hospital brother Marcus uh I'm sick and nobody nobody nobody visited me even the pastor I mean I don't know what he's paid for really no nobody these these people nobody think No Love in the church no understanding brother that's the talk of an unbeliever or somebody who did not really understand message Doctrine because somebody who believes he said hey I was not alone because my theophany was very near to me amen amen I've heard from my theophany amen she's part of me even if the church forgot me but God cannot forget me because my angel just is in his presence all the time can you say Amen so that takes us away from social Christianity it takes us away from slogans Jesus loves you I think I think he cares for you and he loves you you know one thing he must care for me he will care for me because part of me is right there waiting for me just to enter I'm just a negative but the real positive is already on the other sides that's for me that it's pure Marcus that is what brother Brahman said cricket and power brought me behind the curtain of time and I saw all of you there that must be that part that he must have seen blessed be the name of the Lord amen now let's see this and continue I'm coming to the end that is a point while a true Christian has wings to fly away from all problems amen that is a picture it's a little film that was made by uh uh uh General Geographics or whatever is the name is amen National Geographics it's a little film and this is one of the pictures out of that little film and it shows a crow which is on the back of that eagle and what happens is this it's an unbeliever who made that little film in that photo series and he makes a little text about it and he explains this when that Crow was on the back of that eagle the crow was attacking the eagle the head of the eagle and the eagle was not fighting back the eagle was just just flying like this in the air amen but after some time that eagle just went up and the eagle knew one thing hey comrades if you don't pay attention you would you would you will be bursting into a thousand pieces because I will now go up into an altitude where you cannot follow you better leave me here because an unbeliever wrote that text the eagle was not fighting back but after some time the eagle was just going up and the crow behind him the eagle could go higher than any demon can go thank you do you see that you have a potential when it comes very deep maybe in 2023 becomes a difficult year maybe you have a lot of sicknesses maybe a lot of financial problems maybe a lot of problems with your children but there is something in you that can go higher into another Realm brother therefore we come into the house of God to rise up and go higher in certain things can you say Amen that is the nature of an eagle thank you Jesus what a privilege that we have God remembers let me finish that little Story I mean can you say Amen so far what a difference between a creation therefore brother Graham said the first thing that God created were angels and he was right and then he said the first thing that came out of God was the logos and his right too because the Locust was not created the logos was birthed out of him it's a difference amen and we were right in that amen because all the theophonies were in that logos blessed be the name of the Lord so we see that the shunamite woman her boy and that woman was a believer because when the boy died she laid that boy exactly in the same room that she prepared for the prophet and its message brother bran said it like this when Elisha entered into the house of the Widow of serpter he said he was not a prophet who was invited it was God that he invited she invited to him and she laid him just on his bed and he made herself on the way to the man of God and while she was on her donkey gehasi came her way and he said it's it's all well with the boy it's all well with the husband and brother brame said that woman said all is well the bar is dead everything is there but she says all is well in other words my father is in control all is well the doctor says this and this all is well my father is in control can you say Amen Putin says this and Putin says this and we say all is well because Putin can do not nothing but God doesn't allow everything I mean every move God is behind every move so she comes he said the boy is dead and what happened is that that that that that that that the Prophet Elijah he's just sent a little gift a little staff and send it over to laid upon the boy and when they laid it upon it it never worked brother sister you must understand this message is not not a new Catholicism you can go to Jeffersonville you can touch the rifle of brother Branham you can touch the pulpit of Brother by him you can even go to Sunset mountain and and lift your hands in the air but there is no more God there God is in his words amen there is no touching of certain things and now I get healed about this so she got a little gift and to lay it upon the boy and I want to say it like this we are for the gifts I have a gift and if you have a gift praise the Lord use your gift for the glory of God but understand a gift will not give you eternal life never major Upon A minor no gift will give you rapturing Faith rapturing faces in the words can you say no emotion gives you rapturing faith if you find your position in the words you can stream Marcus Becca up and down you can say that's the best preacher in the world but that will not help you on Long effect you just become Marcus fan not more you must touch him the person yourself you must get that message and eat the book yourself okay you say Amen amen I'll take another name what to say so now tied to God that Prophet now comes down the mountain and goes down into that house of that window woman brother Ben said it like this and here's our father who speaks brother Brahm said whenever it is important whenever deals of God's children God is not sending an angel he comes down personally amen tied to our time Revelation 10. among God came down to make the Rapture sure for us amen it was not Elijah searching The Chariot it was this Chariot searching Elijah blessed be the name at least these angels are searching us we are not searching you are not searching you of the offering because the offer is searching you to make sure that you come home because you have a place prepared from God what a father we have Calvary just opened the way for it what a what a blessed thing I know that I'm repeating myself can you say Amen so far this is the last service of this year and I just want to make it as a little dedication service to say Lord look about the Beauty and the goodness of God in 2022 and look how God will be with us in 2023. and that we can say this message is not a Doctrine it is a father that talked to us I'm not I know that I'm repeating myself but it's so beautiful that some of the youngsters that you understand how our father works amen and how it's make makes it matters so much to become Born Again amen because you become then like your father I know I'm repeating myself maybe somebody remember but here comes that little boy and he wants to and he wants to buy some dogs and the owner of this boy comes down the staircase and the boy says I want to have that dog and the owner says what do you want to do with that dog I mean he's handicapped he cannot walk like the rest he has no value what do you want to have with the dog and the boy is just putting up the throat the trousers on his leg and from his knee down he is handicapped and the boy says I want to buy this dog because if when we go out he understands me and I understand him and brother Ben said this God became man to understand me that's our father God was not sitting in heaven and said okay we will see who will make the Rapture only only the brave Only the Good only only who comes Sunday and Wednesday and Friday and the raptures our father comes down and takes us up home the Rapture is not a reward system a bonus point system so so often I read a message so it must be in our heart to serve the Lord and that the inner man is fed by the word of the Lord amen quote brother Brennan God became teenager to understand the teenagers quote brother Ben God became man physically you want to understand what I want to say as a mixed group to understand man so whatever you pray God says I know what you talk about because I was a man myself whatever weakness we speak we confess him God says I understand that because you're in a body who has thrives and is a mammal body I understand what you say that's the father that we serve therefore we can say whatever happens in your life don't stay home um and the biggest mistakes that you make just coming to the house of God is a Heavenly Father Here I Am you will not become more spiritual by staying home that is the time to have a father and not having a religion that is the time that you speak open with him Lord that's my weakness honestly I want to be different but that is my weakness and God says I made you that way but I help you out can you say Amen amen therefore we love to preach this message so he comes into the house amen and the boy lays there and the prophet enters God in form of their prophet and he closes all the doors again your tenth Vision it will not be a public show amen God does great things without playing it for the people I'm I'm very intimidated and what he does is this he lays himself upon the boy brother and this is what this message made with us I mean our mouth is his mouth our eyes became his eyes our mind became the mind of God he laid himself upon the dead body of his bride and the bride comes to life and she knows who she is can you say Amen God in silence does great things God does not forget his children amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen I story is not finished last point do you love the Lord therefore gospel is good news even if God corrects us even if God is chastening us even if he but God is molding us with a purpose so we say now they're just wonderful and the Bible continues it says it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went fast to cry unto the king for her house and for her land and the King talked with gehazi the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all great things that Elisha had done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman who his son had restored to life cried to the king for a house and foreign and this is her son whom Elisha restore to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her as certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now can you say Amen it started with the little tracts with a little conversion Jesus loves you oh where okay rapturing face Tabernacle yes I need Jesus okay that's fine it started with salvation but sooner or later God showed you no no no no no no no I have much more with you than just salvation I bring you back I'm into the place where you belong to you said great he brings us back to the book of Acts no no no he takes us pharah he takes us till the Garden of Eden praise him no no no no he takes us far away um he takes us back to our origin amen into a body that belongs which is eternal can you say Amen what a father we have we did not know who we were but God knew who we were and so everything in our life what we do for God let it become a part of thankfulness to our father when we say as for me and my house we serve the Lord it should not be because we are fearing death we're not fearing death it couldn't be we're Believers Christ paid for us but we do everything that we do out of love for our Eternal Father Can you say Amen when we pray when we come to church let it do it with all our hearts to say as for me and my house we serve the Lord if the musicians would come Hallelujah and we have a thank we are thankful to our God do you love the Lord Jesus amen the one who made a way for us the one who brings us back to where we came from nobody can preach Us in nobody can preach us out amen hallelujah maybe you have the song in moments like this amen is are these moments like this can you say Amen amen hallelujah enormous like this I I I didn't have to Applause me I'm asking you to serve the Lord amen I asked you to use that sentiment to say Lord I want to serve you in 2023 I don't want to jerk around with all kinds of nonsense I'm part of your family I mean one time I'm a little bit joking a pastor friend of mine he was bringing a real message of cutting those people and really repenting them and after service nobody repented everybody was applauding he said I didn't ask for Applause but for repentance but today I don't want to ask for repentance I want to just say let us be aware what kind of church we are we are not just any kind of Adina maybe we are children of the almighty gods and we have a father who takes us home and let's sing that little song in moments like this like these [Music] I sing song I think the love songs [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] before [Music] the Lord foreign foreign I love [Music] that fine for you let's sing the song Do You Love the Lord how many five let's sing the song As the deer pants for the water and then again I will make a little altar call but not coming in the front but I mean you can be seated you can stay wherever you want okay amen As the deer pants for the water I mean is here somebody wants to serve the Lord better in 23. knowing that I'm an inheritance of all things I have a father who gave freely everything to me let me give these little some years that I have on Earth for his glory [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you for you [Applause] [Music] hello [Applause] you you were here my friend that you are my brothers my friends [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] and if the music plays softly I'm not extending just the service but when I was praying there in my little room for that service some story that a long forgotten came back into my mind and it came back into my mind right now just give it two minutes and then we will ask I want to ask you a question do you need a father do you need a friend in life do you need someone that takes you back to your inheritance do you need a power that enforces things that belong to you I mean I don't speak about somebody repent or prayer we don't talk about this we talk about somebody says I need a friend in my life I need a father I need somebody who is there when I'm alone I'm in there's a true story it's a true story it's not stories of them it's a true story of a young boy he gave his story later in the denomination award years ago he was a young boy when he was a child and he his name was John and you every night as a young as these youngsters do they he prayed to God and he always said this Jesus this is John Jesus this is John I would like to talk to you when I'm older and I want to be a preacher I want to be this I want to be that and when the boy got older he fell completely into sin he completely left the Lord in all kinds of things that you can imagine and the boy became an older man and according to his own testimony was in a hospital somewhere when he was older and while he was trying to sleep he heard a voice and the voice said John this is Jesus John Jesus after many many years God remembered the prayers of that little boy am I said John the way John always addressed himself to Jesus was the way that Jesus addressed himself now to John um and why we have our heads about and we have our Iceland I want you to ask you not to film right now this is the holy moment but if somebody is here he said I want to have a friend in life I want to have someone who is always nearby me amen you raise your hand to God especially when you never gave your heart to the Lord amen

you should be though you are quite some time on your way amen and God calls you to a higher call I want you to stand up and make a confession before all the angels I said I'm not what I should be and I want the Holy Spirit and I want the word of the Lord to change my life not to become just old in the message and become more worldly than I ever was I want to say heavenly father you called me with a holy call years and years ago but it seems I became a little bit church member I became a little bit religious in this message but heavenly father let me grow let me let me again flap These Wings that you gave me let me just stream and be a little bit entertained but Lord let me eat the book let me get my time with you and go up into the eternity with you brother Marcus cannot do it for me brother Noah but heavenly father I'm not where I should be but I ask you please take my hands amen I cannot change my past but please heavenly father when I'm entering into 2023 let it be a changing year for me let me become a father who is a model for his family let me be a father like God as a father to me let me be a mother like God is a mother to me amen so Heavenly Father we are we are we're just consecrating our life you see we don't need a prayer line you are the prayer line we can't make a prayer line but Heavenly Father you spoke to their hearts foreign [Music] because goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life amen let us all sit down amen and you please take that purpose I many times say to the young people don't expect that tomorrow everything is new it's a process but you're entering into that process voluntary step by step don't go home and think everything will be new it's not new we have to throw this out everything it will not change but you make a stop at a start to now step by step bring things under your control under the feet of Satan as we were singing today and you take your own confession amen and bring it before the Lord and you water it with prayer and he said according be it according to your will and I will arrive exactly there you water your confession must always be positive God in his time has seen my hand and he has seen my stand therefore I told you in the beginning I'm that woman took a stand for God and brother Brandon called her you got that price because God saw your attitude with that dress is not who has the longest stress is our attitude towards God you honor God and God will honor you that is gospel because God is a father heavenly father is a different ending than our thought but you are so wonderful we come out of 2022 we are on the way home we are pilgrims we are not strangers we are pilgrims but here is people they decide I want to be better on track I want to really serve the Lord not in legalism it never worked it will never work but I want to have a little room in my own heart where you can come wherever you want to talk to me because you told one time to your prophet why don't you walk with me that is what you tell your Earthly bride I want to walk with you I want to talk with you I want to have fellowship with you because this is bright age and last we want to tell you we want to we don't want to be too busy to serve you amen blessed be the name of the Lord if you wouldn't mind we just end with the song if you know the song I have a father amen amen that fight for you amen and that and then I give over to this giveaway to the song service or to the pastor what do you think to our brother do we sing the song Amen you can't imagine I could now have made any kind of come to the front I come down we will this and cry we're not doing this your reaction is for God enough it's for God enough but if you purposed in your hearts um you speak your dad and you speak with your pastor hey what is my next step to do I want to serve the Lord I want to take his hand amen do you see that was an altar call without fear did you realize that did you realize it was an altar call without pressure amen it was not to confirm the preacher a preacher doesn't have to be confirmed how great the service was it was just God telling his children children I love you I mean come home
