[52:13] what a blessing amen want to thank the
[52:16] musician and all the special singer
[52:18] tonight there was certainly a what a
[52:20] blessing
[52:21] amen let's stand up tonight for the
[52:24] reading of the word of God
[52:31] well that's quite a a full
[52:33] day told Brother already back there in
[52:36] the office I said I guess I'll have to
[52:38] be full of energy
[52:43] tonight more preaching than reading
[52:45] because I'm going to lose some
[52:47] people amen but we got a portion tonight
[52:51] we got a portion of the word and
[52:52] certainly uh the Lord has something for
[52:55] us tonight so we will turn in our Bible
[52:56] tonight in the book of St Matthew
[52:58] chapter 19 it's already our last service
[53:02] but it's been a blessing I enjoy the
[53:04] atmosphere I enjoy the fellowship I
[53:05] enjoy the fellowship with you and it's
[53:08] been me and my wife's been certainly
[53:09] certainly a good a good time
[53:12] amen so let's read St Matthew Chapter 19
[53:17] Verse 21 actually this is the the verse
[53:19] we uh read this um this morning now our
[53:23] title tonight is the cost of spiritual
[53:25] growth
[53:27] so this morning in Friday night we've
[53:29] looked at um what was hindering
[53:32] spiritual growth but now
[53:34] tonight uh we will dive in and and try
[53:37] to get a bigger a better a better
[53:40] understanding of how this works so we
[53:43] want to
[53:44] read Matthew 19
[53:48] verse
[53:50] 21 Jesus said unto him if thou will be
[53:53] perfect go and sell that thou H has and
[53:56] give to the
[53:58] poor and thou shalt have a treasure in
[54:00] heaven and come and follow me amen let's
[54:04] bow our head Lord Jesus thank you thank
[54:06] you for your presence thank you for the
[54:07] fellowship thank you for your word it's
[54:09] been certainly Lord a an amazing time in
[54:13] your presence and which with one another
[54:15] Lord it it's a taste of Heaven Lord and
[54:18] we want you Lord to uh give us strength
[54:20] for this last Service as you may come
[54:22] down and speak to our heart again open
[54:23] your word and open our understanding
[54:26] that we realize the challenge of the
[54:27] hour help us tonight we want to take
[54:29] every Spirit under your control take our
[54:31] mind Lord as we surrender ourselves in
[54:33] your presence we pray Lord in Jesus name
[54:36] amen amen you may be
[54:41] seated so this morning we looked at the
[54:43] word perfect and we realized that
[54:46] perfect was lead was a lead uh link to
[54:50] being
[54:51] mature it's a maturing process it's it's
[54:54] talking about to be complete
[54:57] and so this is the Young Rich ruler that
[55:00] went to see Jesus and he was asking the
[55:03] Lord what he needed to have eternal
[55:06] life and Jesus gave him a couple of
[55:09] Commandments and he says what I've done
[55:10] all this and Jesus told him he says now
[55:13] if you want to be mature a grown man if
[55:15] you want to be
[55:17] complete sell all that you
[55:20] have and come and follow me
[55:26] which I want to call this tonight the
[55:29] call
[55:31] so a lot of time after we gave our life
[55:34] to the Lord and got an experience with
[55:37] God we get a lot of people that doesn't
[55:40] quite know what's the next step
[55:43] especially when we're struggling about
[55:44] our status what we've looked at Friday
[55:47] night am I Son of God uh what if I do a
[55:51] wrong choice what if I fall what if I
[55:53] make a mistake and this morning we look
[55:55] at what is the the meaning of the word
[55:57] perfect because we have to stop
[55:59] disqualifying ourself because we have a
[56:02] call in our
[56:04] life and we cannot listen to the call if
[56:08] we are so busy wondering if we are even
[56:11] in the
[56:12] game
[56:14] amen and so many men in their life heard
[56:17] and heat the
[56:18] call
[56:21] and we have here when uh Peter and those
[56:26] fishermen Jesus come by and say follow
[56:31] me I will make you Fishers of Men and
[56:33] straightway they left their Nets and
[56:35] followed
[56:36] him in many instances when Jesus was
[56:40] just walking by he went to Peter he went
[56:43] to Philip he went to Matthew and he said
[56:46] Follow Me Now Jesus was a pure stranger
[56:49] I'm wondering what Jesus had that was
[56:51] that special that somebody would quit
[56:55] his career his work and leave everything
[56:57] on a split second without even looking
[57:00] back
[57:02] to go in the next step now obviously
[57:05] this this this it's it's talking and the
[57:08] reason why I'm I'm want to use this
[57:11] follow
[57:12] me is that God is calling you
[57:15] tonight this follow me is not just a
[57:18] conversion this follow me is the next
[57:22] step of growth in your spiritual life
[57:28] but when we are so busy wondering who we
[57:31] are and am I enough we don't heed the
[57:34] call but God is here tonight to call
[57:38] every one of you to the next step in
[57:41] spiritual growth to the next level and
[57:44] it's something that we underestimated
[57:46] because when we gave our life to the
[57:47] Lord and we have an experience with God
[57:49] then we think you know well I've arrived
[57:52] and yes You' have arrived as far as as
[57:54] as eternal life you've
[57:57] arrive but this morning when with the
[57:59] prophet is saying that the matur SE the
[58:02] maturing season is about to lay in the
[58:04] presence of God most of you probably got
[58:07] the picture of laying in the presence of
[58:09] the son he like oh perfect brother Steve
[58:12] I like that preaching amazing all I have
[58:15] to do is is is lay in the presence of
[58:18] the sun now you got me
[58:22] wrong that's not Del lay on the beach in
[58:24] the presence of the Sun what well I like
[58:26] this maturing
[58:29] process because now I want to talk
[58:31] tonight about the cost of spiritual
[58:35] growth I need to fix this picture in
[58:38] your
[58:39] mind that's why we need more service to
[58:42] to a to be able to go deeper into this
[58:44] this topic and so again you know Jesus
[58:47] passed from forth then and he saw a man
[58:49] named Matthew sitting in the receive and
[58:51] he said unto him follow me and when
[58:54] Jesus says follow me is that follow me
[58:57] in the next step and that's that's all
[59:00] of our call it was not like the first
[59:03] day Jesus says follow me we have to
[59:05] follow the leading of the Holy Ghost
[59:07] every day of our
[59:08] life and it's not following rules or
[59:11] following laws it's following the
[59:14] leadership of his presence which is a
[59:17] it's a different ball
[59:22] game so you know that that that that
[59:26] follow me thing right now is very very
[59:30] popular but I want to tell you there is
[59:32] one here tonight who wants to be
[59:35] followed by you and his name is
[59:40] Jesus follow And subscribe are we sick
[59:43] and tired to hear that you want to you
[59:46] want to fix your lawnmower and you go on
[59:48] YouTube and they're all about well you
[59:50] know like And subscribe and follow I
[59:52] don't want to follow you I want to fix
[59:54] my my lawnmower
[1:00:00] but there's how many people we call them
[1:00:02] influencers and and and every it's a
[1:00:05] modern age everybody wants to be
[1:00:08] followed and but we don't you don't know
[1:00:10] is they follow somebody
[1:00:12] else they have 100,000 subscriber they
[1:00:15] follow the one who has a million
[1:00:17] subscriber and everybody's copying and
[1:00:19] following somebody else and it's an age
[1:00:22] of
[1:00:23] followers amen what in the natural is
[1:00:26] also in the spiritual it's the age of
[1:00:29] following
[1:00:30] Jesus we need to
[1:00:33] subscribe to his to his fresh daily
[1:00:39] updates
[1:00:41] Hallelujah so Jesus passed by the son of
[1:00:43] Levi and he said follow me and and they
[1:00:46] got up and and went and and so that's um
[1:00:50] then he said Jesus unto the disciple If
[1:00:51] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:00:54] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:00:57] me because why my sheep hear my voice
[1:01:01] and I know them and they follow
[1:01:05] me so as much it was put aside following
[1:01:08] the law and following Church rules and
[1:01:10] and maybe some of you left the church
[1:01:11] this morning it says well what did I do
[1:01:13] because I'm I I'm used to follow rules
[1:01:15] and guidance and laws and dos and don'ts
[1:01:18] so what's my leadership now you got your
[1:01:20] answer tonight you got to follow his
[1:01:23] leadership and if you want to know if
[1:01:25] what he's telling you comes from the
[1:01:27] right Spirit you have the Bible to back
[1:01:30] it up because his Spirit wrote the
[1:01:33] Bible his Spirit sent a prophet in our
[1:01:38] age and so he that loveth his life shall
[1:01:41] lose it and he that aided his life in
[1:01:44] this world shall keep it unto Eternal If
[1:01:47] any man serve me let him follow me so
[1:01:50] we're slowly slowly entering into the
[1:01:52] cost of spiritual growth because every
[1:01:55] time you follow Jesus he's is's leading
[1:01:58] you to the next step he's leading you to
[1:02:00] growth he's not leading you to stay as a
[1:02:03] child or to stay at a status quo but
[1:02:06] he's leading you to the next step which
[1:02:08] you have no clue what it is because the
[1:02:10] Bible says that God has prepared for us
[1:02:13] before the foundation of the world some
[1:02:15] works and some Deeds that we that was
[1:02:18] prepared for us so God not only has a
[1:02:20] plan for you but he has a work for
[1:02:23] you but to be able to upon that
[1:02:27] task you need to grow inside because
[1:02:30] whatever God is asking you will bring
[1:02:33] more pressure in your life but if you
[1:02:34] don't grow inside you cannot take what's
[1:02:37] coming from the
[1:02:39] outside so we need to
[1:02:43] grow so we we'll look at different Bible
[1:02:46] character this morning tonight sorry
[1:02:49] and I want to see that every time that
[1:02:52] God calls some men and even some wom in
[1:02:55] their and our calling it came with a
[1:02:59] price and this is what we're not used to
[1:03:02] and we're not prepared for that because
[1:03:04] when we read the Bible we read it like a
[1:03:07] novel we we read it like a nice book and
[1:03:10] we underestimate what those character
[1:03:13] went
[1:03:14] through talk about David was like oh my
[1:03:16] this is so amazing it was not that
[1:03:19] amazing it was actually very very
[1:03:22] difficult
[1:03:27] so let's talk about Gideon for a
[1:03:31] minute when G when God came to visit
[1:03:35] Gideon he was with his crop hiding
[1:03:38] behind a wine
[1:03:42] press and when God visited him the angel
[1:03:46] of the Lord appeared unto him and the
[1:03:48] Lord said the Lord is with thee thou
[1:03:52] Mighty Men of
[1:03:54] Valor now you have a man that's now
[1:03:56] hiding his crop from his enemy hiding
[1:04:00] behind a wine press and God appeared to
[1:04:03] him and call him a mighty man of Valor I
[1:04:06] I'm guessing ginon is
[1:04:08] like who are you talking to like I'm
[1:04:11] full of fear and I'm hiding Beyond a
[1:04:13] wine press and you calling me a mighty
[1:04:15] man of
[1:04:17] Valor it's the same thing when when when
[1:04:19] when when Samuel visited Jesse's son
[1:04:23] family God says you're looking at the
[1:04:26] stature and the height I'm looking at
[1:04:28] the
[1:04:29] heart and there and and Jesse didn't
[1:04:32] dare invite his son CU while he's just
[1:04:34] with the Sheep it's not much it's just a
[1:04:36] kid but when man sees a kid God sees a
[1:04:42] king God seesing gon a mighty man of
[1:04:45] Valor because God knew the potential in
[1:04:48] the seed but gidon didn't know the
[1:04:51] potential in the sea and that's why God
[1:04:54] wants to grow you in a space and a
[1:04:56] position you have no clue the potential
[1:04:59] and the calling and the gift that were
[1:05:02] placed inside that
[1:05:06] seed so we see how Gideon sees himself
[1:05:09] he says Lord you
[1:05:11] know I am the least in my father's house
[1:05:14] and probably many people feel like that
[1:05:16] tonight who am
[1:05:19] I and that's why we sometime we push
[1:05:22] aside when God's called us to do
[1:05:24] something when God us to to step to the
[1:05:27] to to the next level we're kind of oh I
[1:05:31] want to be
[1:05:32] humble it's not about being Pride be
[1:05:35] humble it's about obeying the leading of
[1:05:37] the
[1:05:44] Lord so Gideon is so unsure about what's
[1:05:47] going on that you know that God calls
[1:05:50] him for a great word to deliver is
[1:05:52] Israel and and then he asked for a sign
[1:05:54] then he asked for a second second
[1:05:57] sign and he and he picks himself up
[1:06:00] because he realize God is calling him
[1:06:02] and so he's doing what God is asking him
[1:06:05] so he went at
[1:06:07] night to
[1:06:09] destroy the the the alar and the idols
[1:06:12] in the house of his
[1:06:15] father and the Bible doesn't really
[1:06:18] explain who his father was but let me
[1:06:21] give you my opinion you can take it or
[1:06:24] not but seems like to me that his father
[1:06:28] was probably a priest of some sort
[1:06:31] because when Gideon destroyed the idol
[1:06:34] Baal in his father's house all the town
[1:06:38] showed up so it was not just his
[1:06:41] personal item it seems that the the city
[1:06:44] was in shock and awe that now the idol
[1:06:48] was
[1:06:49] destroyed and so gidon did it at night
[1:06:53] he's he's following the call he's
[1:06:55] following the lead of the holy spirit in
[1:06:58] his life because God wants to grow
[1:07:01] Gideon now when God calls Gideon he's
[1:07:04] hiding behind the wine press so if you
[1:07:06] look at the accessories around him all
[1:07:09] he have is a crop and a wine press but
[1:07:11] God is saying you're going to deliver
[1:07:13] Israel he like what what all I have is a
[1:07:16] wine press and a and fear and a crop
[1:07:19] laying there and sometimes this is how
[1:07:22] we see it is when God Inspire us to do
[1:07:25] something we look at actually what's
[1:07:27] around us and how we feel and we're like
[1:07:29] how is this
[1:07:31] possible but you got to St of Faith
[1:07:34] because whatever God's going to give
[1:07:36] what you need God's going to give it to
[1:07:37] you along the
[1:07:43] way so when Gideon started his ministry
[1:07:46] is first of all to destroy the idols in
[1:07:48] his father's house but when the people
[1:07:51] get up in the morning and they found out
[1:07:53] that this Idol in the city has been
[1:07:55] destroyed they come with sword and torch
[1:07:58] and and they're like who did
[1:08:03] that and finally the Gideon's name come
[1:08:05] up and they're like well it's Gideon who
[1:08:08] did
[1:08:09] that and all the town is coming after
[1:08:12] Gideon so I want you to picture in your
[1:08:15] mind this young man has just done this
[1:08:17] this this first work for
[1:08:21] God and he did it by faith and he get up
[1:08:24] in the morning and look at the windows
[1:08:26] and and you see people coming with with
[1:08:28] with torch and sword and yelling and
[1:08:30] screaming we going to kill him we going
[1:08:32] to kill him and get is looking at the
[1:08:34] window he's like oh my
[1:08:37] goodness what's going on
[1:08:40] here and they come closer and they come
[1:08:42] closer and you start to start to feel
[1:08:44] the heat of wow you know I was excited
[1:08:47] last night I took a stand for
[1:08:49] God but I mean I'm about to
[1:08:54] die yeah that's right he feels inside of
[1:08:57] his heart it's probably the shortest
[1:08:58] ministry that's ever
[1:09:00] been I mean I've been serving God for a
[1:09:02] couple hours and I'm going to die lord
[1:09:04] well take me
[1:09:07] home but it doesn't know that he's now
[1:09:10] growing as he's listening to the call of
[1:09:13] the Lord but it won't be easy because
[1:09:15] this is the cost of spiritual growth so
[1:09:19] forget this thing about laying in the
[1:09:22] sun Gideon was laying in the Sun
[1:09:26] he's now maturing because he's entering
[1:09:28] in
[1:09:30] service but that son now he feels the
[1:09:38] heat the problem is when we read the
[1:09:40] Bible we read it as a
[1:09:43] story and when we try to do something
[1:09:46] for the Lord and it turns bad or it
[1:09:48] turns against us we lose all our courage
[1:09:51] but my question is what are you reading
[1:09:55] why are we so surprised when we try to
[1:09:58] do something for God and it turns
[1:10:00] against us it doesn't turn the way we
[1:10:02] think and you know what until Gideon's
[1:10:05] father stood up so he seems like he was
[1:10:08] an influential man because when he stood
[1:10:10] up and talked to those people at the
[1:10:12] town and he said Baal can defend himself
[1:10:15] if he's a true God my son killed
[1:10:19] him so if he's a true God he can defend
[1:10:21] himself and he and he was able to put to
[1:10:24] appease them and like get was
[1:10:28] like boy that was that close to get
[1:10:35] killed but sometime we have such a
[1:10:38] romantic view when we read it it's just
[1:10:41] a
[1:10:43] story it's like a Sunday SCH you know
[1:10:45] sometime maybe we've been training in
[1:10:48] Sunday
[1:10:49] school you know David is anointing King
[1:10:52] and he becomes king like wow is it
[1:10:54] amazing well read the story between the
[1:10:57] anointing and the
[1:11:00] crown it was not a matter of week
[1:11:02] neither of month it took several
[1:11:08] years when God calls you and inspireing
[1:11:11] I'm not talking about preaching most of
[1:11:14] you won't ever preach you won't be a
[1:11:15] deacon but every one of you have a
[1:11:18] purpose in your
[1:11:21] life God wants to anoint you God wants
[1:11:24] to come down in your life and his Spirit
[1:11:27] wants to reveal to your spirit that
[1:11:29] first of all you're a son and a daughter
[1:11:30] of God but second secondly he wants to
[1:11:34] reveal to you personally follow me then
[1:11:38] your question is well in my position
[1:11:40] brother Steve what is it to follow me I
[1:11:42] don't
[1:11:44] know it took everything for me to
[1:11:47] understand what it
[1:11:49] meant you know I remember when I started
[1:11:52] ministering it's n90 it's was in 99 so
[1:11:54] that's
[1:11:55] been a little
[1:12:02] while after I preached seven
[1:12:05] sermons a brother rose up in church and
[1:12:08] he started to attack me and I got so
[1:12:11] discouraged and he went after me and I I
[1:12:14] thought that created a commotion in the
[1:12:15] church and I was so affected by that I
[1:12:18] didn't expect that I didn't expect to
[1:12:22] preach the word of God to Christian and
[1:12:24] and one man would rise up against me and
[1:12:26] start attacking me I don't know what
[1:12:29] button I pressed but I stepped on
[1:12:32] something and the B I was so unprepared
[1:12:36] for that I had no Shield I had such an
[1:12:38] open heart loving the Lord and and I got
[1:12:41] crushed so bad and I became sick and and
[1:12:43] and fever because my spirit was so
[1:12:46] damaged and and I remembering in bed you
[1:12:48] know and having fever and you know what
[1:12:51] I I I had preached seven sermons so I
[1:12:53] thought it was a spiritual number
[1:12:56] so I said Lord I preached seventh sermon
[1:12:58] take me
[1:12:59] home honestly I thought my Ministry was
[1:13:03] over I was like I've served my purpose I
[1:13:06] delivered a message to that church they
[1:13:08] want it they don't want it it's not my
[1:13:10] problem Lord take me home little did I
[1:13:12] know that I just put a toe it was just a
[1:13:16] baby step in my calling and I already
[1:13:23] collapsed yeah
[1:13:28] cuz I didn't realize I was in a
[1:13:30] war a spiritual war and it wasn't out
[1:13:34] against that brother God probably God
[1:13:36] allowed that brother says hit him hard
[1:13:39] he needs to become a man that young
[1:13:42] Soldier needs to realize this is not a
[1:13:45] picnic and he's got to learn he'll have
[1:13:47] to grow he'll have to be able to get up
[1:13:50] when he's discouraged when he is pain
[1:13:53] and when he is crushed and to pick up
[1:13:55] his sword yes and not attack his brother
[1:13:58] but keep his mission that's right and we
[1:14:01] call that expression in war we call it
[1:14:03] shell
[1:14:10] shock and many warriors experiment that
[1:14:14] you know you go to training and I'm
[1:14:15] going to cover with that later but you
[1:14:17] go to
[1:14:19] training and people are not
[1:14:21] prepared for for the first bomb and for
[1:14:24] the first first guy who was blow up at
[1:14:27] at your on your side and they go in such
[1:14:30] a shock cuz they and Gideon went through
[1:14:33] that I went through
[1:14:37] that and that's how God wants to remove
[1:14:40] the kid out of us to make us men and
[1:14:43] Daughters of God who can stand up in the
[1:14:45] middle of
[1:14:47] discouragement and not say well if this
[1:14:49] happened I'm not a son of God I quit I'm
[1:14:51] not good for nothing I fail I this I
[1:14:53] that and to rip FP apart your service or
[1:14:56] your office for God cuz God wants to
[1:14:59] trust us with things and
[1:15:07] Mission David went through the same
[1:15:11] thing David was anointed king and and
[1:15:15] I'm going to tell you the story how I
[1:15:17] see it so a prophet comes to town to
[1:15:19] anoint a
[1:15:20] king he goes to Jesse and Jesse invites
[1:15:24] all of his sons except
[1:15:27] David like this just a kid we don't we
[1:15:30] won't bother a kid right we're here to
[1:15:32] name a king we're not here to entertain
[1:15:35] children and so when God goes through
[1:15:37] all the sons obviously is he's missing
[1:15:40] he says don't you have another one and
[1:15:42] and you can go read the Bible at home I
[1:15:44] don't have time to show all the
[1:15:45] scriptures but I just want to give you
[1:15:47] the
[1:15:47] highlights so Jesse says well he's just
[1:15:50] with the Sheep you know saying it's
[1:15:51] little boy taking care of sheep you know
[1:15:53] we're talking about serious business
[1:15:54] here we're here to we're here for a king
[1:15:57] right so he says no bring it so he's not
[1:16:01] even started he's not even anointing yet
[1:16:03] for his ministry that his father doesn't
[1:16:05] even believe in
[1:16:07] him that's a good
[1:16:10] start we know how father is important
[1:16:13] and when your father doesn't believe in
[1:16:14] you and that you're in your capacity of
[1:16:16] all these two young go play go
[1:16:19] play but finally because finally because
[1:16:22] the prophet is around he gets anointed
[1:16:24] and
[1:16:25] and and and I can I can think about
[1:16:27] David going back in the field that night
[1:16:30] laying you know in the grass looking at
[1:16:32] the stars and say man I just got
[1:16:36] anointed king today is it amazing that a
[1:16:40] straw in his M you
[1:16:44] know we're in New Zealand
[1:16:48] right and he's like wow I've just been
[1:16:52] anointed king
[1:16:55] that was so easy all I had to do is come
[1:16:57] out of the field bow my head respect the
[1:17:00] prophet all I had to do is believe the
[1:17:02] prophet oh my oh
[1:17:06] my all I had to do is listen to The
[1:17:09] Prophet believe the prophet and
[1:17:12] wow well he doesn't
[1:17:15] know God sees a king but he's still a
[1:17:17] kid he's got a lot to
[1:17:21] learn so one day his father sends his
[1:17:25] his father sends David he says you know
[1:17:26] your brother's at War so I'll pack some
[1:17:30] uh some food and you bring food to your
[1:17:33] brothers so he says yeah Dad he obeys
[1:17:35] his father so brings the food goes to
[1:17:37] the field goes to the war and and and he
[1:17:39] start hearing that goliet with the
[1:17:41] challenge and he's the seed inside start
[1:17:44] to you know that there's life in there's
[1:17:47] a lot of potential inside and and that
[1:17:49] voice of that Challenger kind of kind of
[1:17:51] trickle something inside of him because
[1:17:53] there's a there's a deep deep
[1:17:55] there he so he get all excited and he's
[1:17:58] like who's that guy why is he
[1:17:59] challenging the army of God and man God
[1:18:02] is with us and he's able and he's this
[1:18:04] and he's that and then his his brother
[1:18:06] Eliah hear him and he's like well David
[1:18:10] here you are what are you doing here why
[1:18:11] are you not with your sheep you came
[1:18:14] here and you're full of Pride I know
[1:18:17] you and so first of all his daddy
[1:18:19] doesn't believe in him and when he's
[1:18:21] about to step in his ministry to make
[1:18:23] his first word
[1:18:26] is is his
[1:18:28] brother attacks him his own
[1:18:32] brother and his brother saying you're
[1:18:35] full of
[1:18:36] Pride but if we understand the story
[1:18:39] right eliab's full of Pride because
[1:18:41] Eliah has it against David that that the
[1:18:44] cup the anointing was bypassed him and
[1:18:47] went down the alley and anointing David
[1:18:49] and now elab is still mad about that but
[1:18:52] because he's mad about that he accused
[1:18:54] David of being what he is himself that's
[1:18:56] a common
[1:18:59] pattern so his fathers didn't believe in
[1:19:01] him now his brothers attacking
[1:19:04] him and so David makes such an argument
[1:19:06] that at one point he's he was probably
[1:19:08] real convincing because they brought him
[1:19:10] to the king we got this boy here he's
[1:19:13] pretend he wants to go fight this
[1:19:14] Goliath and Saul is like really you're
[1:19:17] just a kid like another one that doesn't
[1:19:19] believe in
[1:19:22] me I want to do something for God and
[1:19:25] and every time I step there's somebody
[1:19:27] who's against me criticized me you
[1:19:29] better be sure when you have something
[1:19:32] on your
[1:19:33] heart God will allow even people that
[1:19:35] you love that will doubt what you have
[1:19:39] Jesus went through that when he went to
[1:19:41] Nazareth his own
[1:19:42] people well we know his father we know
[1:19:45] his mother we know his brother we know
[1:19:46] he's a comforter son he's just this he's
[1:19:48] nothing and the Bible says Jesus
[1:19:50] couldn't do much miracle in that town
[1:19:52] because he had such a backlash against
[1:19:54] his personal
[1:19:58] life it takes
[1:20:01] courage to serve God in the mission he
[1:20:04] has given
[1:20:07] us and so finally Saul is like okay go
[1:20:11] try to put his armor doesn't work get
[1:20:12] rid of that and then he goes in face
[1:20:15] Goliad and even his enemies like
[1:20:19] really come on guys Israel you got
[1:20:22] better than that you just send me this
[1:20:24] kid did now not only he's insulted by
[1:20:27] his own people even his enemy is
[1:20:29] laughing even his enemy doesn't even
[1:20:31] believe
[1:20:33] him if you want to be discouraged you'll
[1:20:35] be discouraged before you even start
[1:20:40] it well I knew he was not the
[1:20:43] Lord why well because it's difficult oh
[1:20:47] like that's a measuring
[1:20:51] line so he kills Goliath and then
[1:20:53] everybody gets exced excited ah finally
[1:20:56] I'm a national
[1:20:57] hero and then he gets invited in Sal in
[1:21:00] in the palace to play music and so
[1:21:03] finally is
[1:21:05] sitting in the
[1:21:08] palace with his music instrument
[1:21:12] harp and he's 10 feet from the
[1:21:16] trone and he's thinking now he remembers
[1:21:19] you know the straw with the
[1:21:21] Sheep now he says I'm 10t away the
[1:21:25] throne wow praise the Lord I'm almost
[1:21:28] there I'm anointed to be sitting in that
[1:21:31] chair and I'm actually like I'm so close
[1:21:34] and I'm I'm about to
[1:21:40] sit the king just tried to pierce him
[1:21:42] against the
[1:21:45] wall as he's thinking I'm not that
[1:21:49] close his World falls apart
[1:21:54] so he keeps playing was like I probably
[1:21:56] just dreamed that I mean that's wild
[1:22:01] imagination and then
[1:22:03] again and he
[1:22:05] realized he's in
[1:22:08] danger did I talk about that in gender
[1:22:10] confusion those of you remember I talked
[1:22:13] about that because finally David ran
[1:22:15] away at one point because he got this
[1:22:18] courage and he ran into a cave if you
[1:22:20] remember
[1:22:27] and so from being that close to the
[1:22:30] throne David ended up being a
[1:22:33] fugitive among his own
[1:22:35] people so
[1:22:38] unrecognized not
[1:22:42] appreciated but then
[1:22:44] sometime we build a complex against the
[1:22:47] people because we think the problem is
[1:22:49] the people but God did that for David on
[1:22:53] purpose amen because he's building a man
[1:22:57] inside David if he gives him the throne
[1:23:00] overnight you have a problem because you
[1:23:02] have a kid sitting on a throne but
[1:23:05] during that process God allowed all
[1:23:08] those people to give him a rough time
[1:23:11] because he's growing a character he's
[1:23:14] maturing through the trial and through
[1:23:18] through the to the
[1:23:19] tribulation but the problem is when we
[1:23:22] go through that we quit yeah and we're
[1:23:24] like it's not God it's too difficult
[1:23:27] it's too
[1:23:34] painful
[1:23:36] because the first step in
[1:23:39] childhood it's about having
[1:23:44] fun one sign of you want to know if
[1:23:46] you're mature or
[1:23:48] not if all you think about is having fun
[1:23:52] and having easy you you need to
[1:23:59] mature if you quit because it's
[1:24:02] hard you need to
[1:24:05] mature after seventh sermon I wanted to
[1:24:07] quit because it became too painful I was
[1:24:10] immature but God used that to teach me
[1:24:13] something when you feel discouraged your
[1:24:16] spirit is crushed your heart is broken
[1:24:18] and you're sick in your
[1:24:20] body it will pass
[1:24:24] you won't die there's another
[1:24:27] step and I went through that that cycle
[1:24:31] in my Ministry there's a death there's a
[1:24:34] come back to life there's a death you
[1:24:36] know even the prophet in his life he had
[1:24:38] three pool and big valleys in
[1:24:40] between even before the third pool he
[1:24:43] thought the vision he he he thought I
[1:24:45] will die he thought it was he would be
[1:24:48] die he would be because there in the
[1:24:49] vision was such an explosion he thought
[1:24:51] he would die and he was not that far
[1:24:55] because the third pull would make him
[1:24:57] diminish for Christ to increase so there
[1:25:00] was a death there was a death on many
[1:25:03] like we teach on Friday night the death
[1:25:04] through the old context the death
[1:25:06] through the old standpoint because God
[1:25:08] is about to bring him to another
[1:25:10] standpoint so there's going to be a
[1:25:12] death there's going to be a
[1:25:19] change so when we are a child we need
[1:25:22] rules because all we think about is
[1:25:24] about having fun and playing game but as
[1:25:27] we move to manhood or for our sister to
[1:25:30] get included when we move to
[1:25:33] maturity it's not
[1:25:35] about having games or having fun but
[1:25:39] it's about the purpose you have in your
[1:25:43] life when you have no purpose you need
[1:25:47] rules don't do this I know you want to
[1:25:49] have fun but don't go don't go too far
[1:25:51] you know fun at one point you know if
[1:25:54] you draw by you're drawn by Pleasure
[1:25:56] you'll get in
[1:25:58] trouble but as you're maturing God wants
[1:26:01] to give you a purpose in your life and
[1:26:03] now you're not seeking pleasure anymore
[1:26:06] you're seeking the
[1:26:09] purpose and that changes
[1:26:12] everything because now it's not about is
[1:26:15] it right or wrong for me to do that so
[1:26:19] the Bible says here that all things are
[1:26:21] lawful unto me but all things things are
[1:26:24] not expedient all things are lawful for
[1:26:27] me but I will not be brought under the
[1:26:29] power of any so as we preach Friday
[1:26:32] night and this morning maybe there's
[1:26:34] people are saying okay brother Steve
[1:26:35] you're removing all concerns about
[1:26:37] behavior and rules and law and so what's
[1:26:40] going to guide
[1:26:41] me and the answer is tonight what's
[1:26:45] going to guide you is the purpose that
[1:26:47] God gave you in saying follow
[1:26:52] me this will be become your
[1:26:55] vision and this is why when I talk to
[1:26:58] young people and it's like brother Steve
[1:27:00] do you think it's right if I do this I
[1:27:02] almost never answer a question about the
[1:27:05] present time like no you shouldn't do
[1:27:09] that I don't do that because if I if I
[1:27:11] do that I don't teach them how to take a
[1:27:16] decision so I always fall back when they
[1:27:18] ask me a question I did that with my
[1:27:20] children I do that with young people
[1:27:22] especially when they're difficult time I
[1:27:24] always have a step back and I ask them
[1:27:27] where do you want to be in five years
[1:27:29] and I want to fall back into their
[1:27:32] purpose if they have
[1:27:34] one then I ask them I asked the young
[1:27:37] young people I saids do you want to get
[1:27:38] married yes do you want to marry a
[1:27:40] Christian yeah I want to marry a
[1:27:42] Christian perfect you want to have kids
[1:27:43] I want to have kids do you want to bring
[1:27:45] your kids to church yes I want to bring
[1:27:47] my you want to raise them you know to
[1:27:48] love God and re yes that's what I want
[1:27:50] to do all right so to if that is your
[1:27:53] vision and this is your mission in
[1:27:56] life now reconsider that the decision
[1:28:00] you're taking today will that decision
[1:28:03] draw you closer to that purpose o away
[1:28:05] from that purpose and suddenly you're
[1:28:08] not judging on right or wrong or I'm
[1:28:11] allowed or I'm not allowed but you are
[1:28:13] judging on the purpose that God has put
[1:28:16] inside of your
[1:28:22] heart so Paul says I'm allowed to do
[1:28:26] whatever I
[1:28:28] want because I'm not under the law
[1:28:33] anymore so he's Guided by a higher
[1:28:37] purpose than the lawful or not but he's
[1:28:41] guided now and that's the mature level
[1:28:45] but when there's a kid you can't you
[1:28:46] don't ask a kid if he has a vision like
[1:28:50] what I'm hungry
[1:28:55] what's your purpose the next
[1:29:00] meal right what's your purpose I want to
[1:29:03] go play with my
[1:29:04] friends what's your purpose in life you
[1:29:07] know I want to go play hockey I want to
[1:29:08] go play this right it's the instant
[1:29:11] gratification instant pleasure it's
[1:29:13] about getting fed having fun and and
[1:29:15] avoiding pain at all
[1:29:17] cost
[1:29:19] immature so for that stage they need law
[1:29:23] cuz they don't have a
[1:29:25] purpose but as we mature we move away
[1:29:28] from lawful unlawful and we are moving
[1:29:31] into expedient which means does it
[1:29:35] profit
[1:29:36] me does it make me better is it good for
[1:29:39] me is it profitable for me concerning
[1:29:42] what concerning
[1:29:44] this cuz now I have a mission now I have
[1:29:47] a
[1:29:49] purpose you're with
[1:29:51] me so now you're taking your decision
[1:29:55] based on where you want to be in
[1:29:58] life now your Eternal destination is
[1:30:01] solved the question is
[1:30:03] solv eternal destination is solved so
[1:30:06] you're not making your decision to be to
[1:30:09] have eternal life cuz you have already
[1:30:11] eternal life so now your decision is
[1:30:15] based on now what's my purpose on Earth
[1:30:18] while I'm here God you have prepared
[1:30:20] works for me what is it Lord amen
[1:30:26] yes I was talking to a brother in F uh
[1:30:30] after the service and he said I don't
[1:30:32] know if he's here tonight but he says
[1:30:34] God has really you know I brought a
[1:30:36] Revival in my life lately and I'm I
[1:30:38] testify as much as I can't and I I give
[1:30:41] scriptures to people and it it can be
[1:30:43] such at a small it small it's not small
[1:30:46] it's big but small in a sense that when
[1:30:49] we talk about a calling everybody think
[1:30:51] about a position in the church or or
[1:30:54] being behind a Pulpit or it doesn't have
[1:30:56] to be in the church it's great if it
[1:30:59] is but maybe some of you God is calling
[1:31:02] you to witness somewhere to go in a part
[1:31:05] to end out tracks to testify whatever
[1:31:07] God is calling you there is a call
[1:31:11] am but it will cost you
[1:31:14] something it might change your life it
[1:31:17] might change the level of comfort that
[1:31:19] you have Because unless you're willing
[1:31:21] to give your life you're not ready to
[1:31:23] fight follow
[1:31:26] Jesus and it g across
[1:31:30] something it might change your
[1:31:32] habit what if afterward God ask you
[1:31:35] always to stop at a certain place to
[1:31:37] testify well no I don't I'm hungry I
[1:31:39] want to go back home whatever God is
[1:31:40] asking you it will change your habit it
[1:31:44] will it will bring some pain some
[1:31:46] discomfort true so you got to be ready
[1:31:49] to say Lord what and and and so that
[1:31:52] discomfort or that that fear of pain is
[1:31:55] a childish thing so God wants to grow
[1:31:59] you
[1:32:00] inside you know when when I went through
[1:32:03] that after seven service I was probably
[1:32:05] that small inside so when that backlash
[1:32:07] came
[1:32:08] I fell into
[1:32:10] pieces but when I got back up and God
[1:32:14] resurrected
[1:32:15] me cuz he had to do it that's right
[1:32:18] something had
[1:32:19] happened I was bigger how do we do
[1:32:22] muscle yeah you know how we do
[1:32:26] muscle we lift weight we do something
[1:32:29] and you know what happened the muscle
[1:32:32] being
[1:32:33] teared and it
[1:32:36] hurts then it heals and in that process
[1:32:39] it got bigger and
[1:32:41] stronger and so if in the natural you're
[1:32:44] willing if you want to go bigger and
[1:32:48] stronger you're willing to to tear your
[1:32:51] your muscle so they heal and they go
[1:32:53] bigger I said who created that well on a
[1:32:58] spiritual level it's the same thing
[1:33:00] there's going to be some heartbreak
[1:33:02] there's going to be some scars there's
[1:33:03] going to be some pain but that's how God
[1:33:06] is building us a character because we
[1:33:08] are called to
[1:33:11] rign
[1:33:19] am so that's a different perspective
[1:33:24] and this is how I try
[1:33:26] to even lead my family the
[1:33:30] children you know how do you make your
[1:33:32] children
[1:33:33] obey there's many ways you threaten them
[1:33:36] all the time do it because I'm spank you
[1:33:40] do that do it CU I'm going to tell Daddy
[1:33:41] when he comes home well that's fun for
[1:33:43] Daddy now all the kids are afraid every
[1:33:45] time dad comes home cu the mother spend
[1:33:47] all day threatening when daddy's gonna
[1:33:49] come home when daddy's gonna come home
[1:33:51] like Daddy comes home he's like thank
[1:33:53] you honey all the kids are afraid of
[1:33:56] me but you threaten you threaten because
[1:33:59] you're trying to make them
[1:34:02] move but when they start to to grow up
[1:34:05] and have a little bit of understanding
[1:34:07] you know what I did one day I made a
[1:34:08] contract with my
[1:34:10] children and I asked them I said what
[1:34:12] kind of home do you want us guys to
[1:34:15] have I went on the bigger purpose I
[1:34:18] didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't went
[1:34:19] to that event but I backed off and I we
[1:34:23] had that discussion what kind of a house
[1:34:26] do you guys want us to have do you want
[1:34:28] a house where Mommy and and Daddy are
[1:34:31] screaming all the time because you guys
[1:34:32] don't listen do you like a house where
[1:34:35] where parents scream no no no we don't
[1:34:38] like that we don't want that so okay so
[1:34:41] I said if you don't want that kind of
[1:34:42] house what can we do to have a peaceful
[1:34:46] house where there there's there's um
[1:34:51] coordination where it's not chaos
[1:34:55] so I said what
[1:34:57] if we ask you something for the first
[1:35:00] time with a with peaceful voice and
[1:35:02] quiet and you guys do it we're going to
[1:35:04] have a peaceful house here because
[1:35:06] there's going to be a flow and there's
[1:35:07] going to be Co cohesion between
[1:35:10] us and then later on you're sitting in
[1:35:13] the car and they're so noisy and this
[1:35:15] and that says okay kids please tone it
[1:35:18] down a little bit and they don't listen
[1:35:21] and then I raise my voice and then the
[1:35:23] third time I like okay time
[1:35:26] out you remember our
[1:35:28] conversation where I asked you what kind
[1:35:30] of house do you and when I recall the
[1:35:33] greater purpose of the house you know
[1:35:36] what it did to the kids oh yeah this is
[1:35:38] our
[1:35:42] vision and sometime they were going to
[1:35:45] visit maybe other family and it was
[1:35:47] chaotic sometime and so they knew and
[1:35:50] they saw us also that if if we re they
[1:35:53] didn't didn't like me they don't like
[1:35:54] brother Steve when he's
[1:35:55] angry my eyes you know and the pnut I
[1:35:59] would
[1:36:00] give my kids still talk about
[1:36:06] that Daddy you're look and your pish
[1:36:09] nut
[1:36:13] arm I said do you want us to yell do you
[1:36:16] want us to hurt you or we can
[1:36:21] talk when we train our children
[1:36:24] to hear
[1:36:26] only when you get punished do you know
[1:36:30] that it translate with
[1:36:34] God it was for me now I'm getting away
[1:36:37] from my notes but I just follow the
[1:36:39] leading the Holy
[1:36:42] Ghost I was raised with you know
[1:36:46] punishment
[1:36:48] and I got used to to this and later on
[1:36:52] when I became a Christian God
[1:36:54] I was I was I was preaching in a church
[1:36:56] and and one day Brother D called me to
[1:36:58] he says you know I want you to pray
[1:37:00] about coming at our church Andre is my
[1:37:03] wife's father it's my my father-in-law
[1:37:06] he was the pastor of the church and he
[1:37:07] says I want you to pray and consider
[1:37:09] moving in our church to help me in the
[1:37:12] ministry and I'm like
[1:37:15] well in my church I was slung song
[1:37:17] leading I was the youth leader I was
[1:37:19] preaching I was I was really involved
[1:37:21] because a smaller church and Warden had
[1:37:23] that was a church with many people and
[1:37:27] more staff I you could say so I didn't
[1:37:28] see I didn't realize the purpose so I
[1:37:30] prayed but I didn't really take that
[1:37:31] seriously and
[1:37:32] I and I called him like a few days later
[1:37:35] and I'm like no I don't think and he was
[1:37:38] like he was surprised like I didn't ask
[1:37:39] you to call me a couple of days later I
[1:37:41] wanted you to pray and take your time so
[1:37:43] finally it was a it was
[1:37:46] no and
[1:37:48] then in my mind I'm like I don't know if
[1:37:52] I took the right decision but
[1:37:55] if I didn't take if I took the bad
[1:37:58] decision nothing bad has happened to
[1:38:02] me so I'm
[1:38:05] expecting I'm expecting a
[1:38:08] punishment if I made a
[1:38:10] mistake because for me this is clear if
[1:38:13] I do something wrong God's going to
[1:38:15] spank
[1:38:17] me so I'm waiting for that instead of
[1:38:20] waiting for the Lord to tell me
[1:38:25] so I called for that you know what
[1:38:27] happened couple of days later after I
[1:38:29] called about Andre to tell him I'm not
[1:38:31] going my wife was pregnant with William
[1:38:34] she almost lost a baby she went to the
[1:38:38] hospital then she's in bed she has to
[1:38:40] stay in bed because she's about to lose
[1:38:41] the
[1:38:43] baby and then I go to work and I was
[1:38:45] working on night shifts I'm the one who
[1:38:47] put the alarm close the shop and go back
[1:38:49] home that day seems like I forgot to put
[1:38:51] the alarm system and they got robbed and
[1:38:53] stole the computer and all that and it
[1:38:55] was my fault and so now I'm starting to
[1:38:58] listening because now I almost lost my
[1:39:00] baby my wife is is in bed and now they
[1:39:03] got stole at my job because of my fault
[1:39:06] and now I'm now I'm going on my
[1:39:08] knees why because I got
[1:39:12] spanked some bad things has happened to
[1:39:15] me so I feel like this is a punishment
[1:39:17] so I probably made a wrong decision
[1:39:19] because I I was trained with punishment
[1:39:24] later on God showed me you don't have to
[1:39:27] go that far I I I can talk to
[1:39:32] you so God wants to talk to
[1:39:36] you but if you've been trained that he's
[1:39:39] going to slap you that something bad so
[1:39:42] nothing bad has happened to me so I
[1:39:43] guess I'm right don't go there you don't
[1:39:46] have to have that relationship with the
[1:39:48] Lord God wants to talk to you God wants
[1:39:51] to reveal it to you that you're made a
[1:39:53] mistake here look at my word and Lord oh
[1:39:56] I'm sorry and you go back in line that's
[1:39:59] are you with
[1:40:00] me so that's what I told the kids I says
[1:40:03] do you want a house where we spank we
[1:40:05] yell and where there's violence or a
[1:40:07] house where we
[1:40:10] talk and when it was going uh astray and
[1:40:14] the kids were I had to raise my voice I
[1:40:16] always fail back to the vision and you
[1:40:18] know I got five
[1:40:20] kids it always worked
[1:40:23] every time I fell back I didn't go back
[1:40:26] to the law to rules but to a principle
[1:40:30] that me and them and my wife had agreed
[1:40:33] it was our home
[1:40:34] contract we want this house to be
[1:40:37] peaceful we want this house not to yell
[1:40:40] and we're
[1:40:41] angry and we're fussing we're a house
[1:40:44] when we can talk understand that I need
[1:40:46] for you to do this I need you guys to do
[1:40:49] that because we we need to move forward
[1:40:51] we're all the family we're all in
[1:40:52] together
[1:40:54] and every time I said that it triggered
[1:40:56] something in my children I saw them in
[1:40:59] their eyes they like yep daddy y y y y
[1:41:02] this all what we
[1:41:06] want this is how we
[1:41:08] lead to maturity so it's linked to this
[1:41:12] it's not about what you're doing is
[1:41:13] wrong or right but are we going against
[1:41:17] the
[1:41:19] mission you're with me
[1:41:24] watching the clock
[1:41:28] here all right let's talk about
[1:41:31] Mary oh we love that story Mary hears
[1:41:34] the voice of the Angel she says Let It
[1:41:37] Be Done unto me then she's pregnant is
[1:41:41] it
[1:41:42] amazing how easy that look
[1:41:45] right nice Sunday School
[1:41:49] Story and we stopped
[1:41:51] there now what we have to to realize
[1:41:53] that after she
[1:41:55] obeyed the voice of God and she becomes
[1:41:59] pregnant she's there's some spiritual
[1:42:06] growth then she comes to Joseph and said
[1:42:09] honey I'm
[1:42:12] pregnant by the voice of God
[1:42:17] yeah she's wanted a woman who had such
[1:42:22] Faith to become pregnant Naturally by
[1:42:24] the voice of God now name me a woman in
[1:42:27] the Bible that can match
[1:42:29] that and we think it's glorious and it
[1:42:31] is and we think it's easy but it was not
[1:42:33] because the next day she almost lost her
[1:42:37] husband that's a hard part you get up in
[1:42:40] the morning and you hear that Joseph
[1:42:42] secretly is trying to get rid of you he
[1:42:44] like Lord why is this happening to me
[1:42:47] this is the man I love this is the man I
[1:42:48] want to spend my life with he's a man of
[1:42:51] God and and I obeyed I trusted you Lord
[1:42:54] I I've accepted your word I listen to
[1:42:56] the voice of the Angel and he's about to
[1:42:58] get rid of me cuz that happened maybe
[1:43:01] few hours maybe a couple of days but
[1:43:03] when we read the story we read it quick
[1:43:06] but we don't go through the process the
[1:43:08] emotion the downside the crushing of the
[1:43:10] heart the crying the begging God it's
[1:43:13] not written but these were real human
[1:43:15] beings with a real life
[1:43:19] story but when you take a stand for God
[1:43:22] he'll have your back that's right Mary
[1:43:25] didn't have to defend herself and that's
[1:43:28] why sometime we got it wrong when God
[1:43:30] ask us to do something and it turns back
[1:43:32] we're up there trying to defend oursel
[1:43:34] and try to stay quiet let God come on
[1:43:37] the
[1:43:39] scene you trusted God to do it Gideon
[1:43:42] didn't have to do nothing the father
[1:43:44] steps
[1:43:47] in David didn't even want to get rid of
[1:43:51] Saul twice he had the chance to kill him
[1:43:53] but he was not it was not for him to
[1:43:56] make way for his ministry for his
[1:43:58] calling he says I'm not touching he's in
[1:44:01] Saul is in between my calling and me I'm
[1:44:07] I could K kill him right now so I can
[1:44:09] move on but don't
[1:44:12] ever
[1:44:14] kill brutalize or make violence to
[1:44:17] defend your call let God do it for
[1:44:21] you so David says not touching Saul God
[1:44:24] took control of Saul and in the right
[1:44:27] time the door got
[1:44:29] open so we need courage we need patience
[1:44:33] and we need to fall back to our mission
[1:44:35] and we have to remember sometime we make
[1:44:37] it personal even in in the ministry God
[1:44:40] gave me sometime I made it personal I
[1:44:42] made it about
[1:44:44] me and when you make it about you you're
[1:44:47] making a mistake because if you're there
[1:44:49] it's God called you he's the author of
[1:44:52] this
[1:44:53] he wrote the book and he knows the end
[1:44:55] of the chapter you don't know the end of
[1:44:57] the book so you don't defend yourself
[1:44:59] and it's not about you it's about what
[1:45:03] God wants to do it in your life and he
[1:45:05] will do
[1:45:08] it hallelujah hallelujah so finally God
[1:45:12] talks to Joseph that's getting fixed
[1:45:14] they're getting but then the rumors in
[1:45:18] the
[1:45:19] streets now she becomes a woman of Shame
[1:45:23] yes but in our mind you know this novel
[1:45:26] romantic novel we think that if I take a
[1:45:28] stand for God everybody's going to
[1:45:30] applaud everybody's going to agree
[1:45:31] everybody we're not here to be cheered
[1:45:34] by a a crowd we are here to follow the
[1:45:37] will of the
[1:45:39] lord we got to have a revelation of our
[1:45:43] position amen all
[1:45:49] right let's move on
[1:45:58] and
[1:46:00] so the problem we have is that we read
[1:46:04] but we're not
[1:46:08] reading we are used to nice stories
[1:46:12] andwell and in our society our society
[1:46:15] is built on avoiding pain at all costs
[1:46:19] and seeking pleasure at all costs
[1:46:24] and you know what when they
[1:46:25] train military
[1:46:28] personnel they try to make
[1:46:31] it as much as realistic as
[1:46:35] possible because and that's why I'm
[1:46:38] preaching the way I'm preaching tonight
[1:46:40] I'm not trying to sell you an easy
[1:46:43] story because that's where I realize
[1:46:45] many Christian they get excited in
[1:46:47] church because oh praise the Lord we're
[1:46:48] the bride thank the Lord we're
[1:46:50] Victorious thank the lord we read the
[1:46:51] back of the wood the the book and we win
[1:46:54] and it's all true but we got to prepare
[1:46:57] the people that when we walk out of
[1:46:59] church it's War that's right and it's
[1:47:04] not war against the people it's not the
[1:47:06] war against the that neighbor at work
[1:47:09] that's against you it's a spiritual war
[1:47:11] but you got to be ready to be crushed to
[1:47:14] be brokenhearted to be discouraged and
[1:47:16] not
[1:47:19] quit I say that but I've quit many times
[1:47:22] or did I
[1:47:24] quit and that's where I realized that
[1:47:27] something something is holding
[1:47:31] me because what I realized you know I'm
[1:47:34] a I'm a I'm a strong will
[1:47:36] man but God has allow me to be broken to
[1:47:40] Pieces where I was not able I didn't
[1:47:42] have any strength to hold my Christian
[1:47:45] Life the ministry he gave me I remember
[1:47:47] 2016 2017 I had a meltdown burnout I
[1:47:50] quit the ministry for 6 months I was
[1:47:53] done I said Lord I
[1:47:58] quit it's like when you think you're
[1:48:00] holding onto
[1:48:02] something too many people here think
[1:48:04] that you're are you are holding onto the
[1:48:07] Lord You're not holding and if you think
[1:48:11] that God will allow a period of your
[1:48:13] life where you don't have the strength
[1:48:14] to hold anymore so Lord Lord do
[1:48:17] something I can't hold anymore Lord Lord
[1:48:20] I I'll have to let go Lord it Lord I'm
[1:48:22] warning you is too difficult I'm going
[1:48:24] to backslide Lord I'm going to quit or
[1:48:26] it's too difficult I warn you now it's
[1:48:28] too
[1:48:30] late I'm still
[1:48:33] here oh praise the
[1:48:35] Lord oh you're holding me my I wasted so
[1:48:39] many effort trying to hold on but and
[1:48:42] and I went through that experience when
[1:48:44] I quit I was still there when I said
[1:48:47] Lord I have enough and my wife saw me
[1:48:49] collapse at one point she saw she
[1:48:51] thought we won't have any Pastor anymore
[1:48:53] cuz I told him I I'm done I'm
[1:48:56] done but when I said I'm done I was
[1:49:00] still there and when I quit I realized
[1:49:03] that inside of my heart it was still
[1:49:06] there but what what what I die was me I
[1:49:11] died but the calling was still there
[1:49:14] then I realized my did I spend so much
[1:49:17] energy trying to hold this all this
[1:49:20] together well now you reveal tell to me
[1:49:23] that he's holding it
[1:49:25] together and if we don't realize that
[1:49:27] God's going to reveal it to you cuz it's
[1:49:29] really
[1:49:32] important so we need real
[1:49:37] training you know when I meet people and
[1:49:40] they try to do something for God and
[1:49:41] they get so discouraged I'm like this is
[1:49:44] what I was talking about it's going to
[1:49:46] be
[1:49:47] rough well I know but not that rough yes
[1:49:51] exactly
[1:49:53] that
[1:49:55] rough you'll want to quit you'll want to
[1:49:58] bargain with God you'll say Lord I I
[1:50:00] didn't know what I was getting into Lord
[1:50:02] I'm done now this and this and and and
[1:50:05] it will exploit every um
[1:50:09] weakness you have inside of you every
[1:50:12] complex every loose end in your inside
[1:50:15] of you will be exploit by the enemy but
[1:50:18] God allows that because all those loosen
[1:50:20] will get strengthen
[1:50:23] thank you Lord It's why are we preaching
[1:50:25] that cuz we're talking about spiritual
[1:50:28] growth we've done talking about we're
[1:50:31] Sons and Daughters of God we know that
[1:50:33] we're not perfect and it's exactly that
[1:50:36] before we go to war we got to realize
[1:50:38] I'm going to do mistake and if I do a
[1:50:40] mistake WIll I throw my gun and walk
[1:50:42] away from the from the combat or I pick
[1:50:45] myself up and I reload like the prophet
[1:50:48] is talking about the war I was how a
[1:50:50] bomb would miss and the other one would
[1:50:52] miss the prophet says keep trying until
[1:50:54] one goes
[1:50:56] off it's not time to quit We're All in
[1:51:00] This Together
[1:51:05] friends so the
[1:51:08] training has to be
[1:51:11] real it's good to encourage people we're
[1:51:14] the bride we're winning glory to God God
[1:51:16] sent a prophet we have the victory it's
[1:51:18] it's all good it's all good to encourage
[1:51:20] the people but at the other side we got
[1:51:23] to be truly
[1:51:25] honest the pastor has to be honest to
[1:51:27] say it is difficult right now church
[1:51:31] pray for
[1:51:32] me I took a couple of weeks of vacation
[1:51:35] in August and when I came back we did a
[1:51:37] prayer meeting I told the church I need
[1:51:40] prayer I'm coming back from vacation and
[1:51:42] I need the inspiration of God we're all
[1:51:44] in this together and so we kneeled
[1:51:46] together and all together I says church
[1:51:48] pray for
[1:51:50] me now they realized that that the
[1:51:53] pastor is is is not Invincible he's a
[1:51:55] man that's fighting his end and so all
[1:51:58] the church now got together to fight in
[1:52:00] prayer because we're all in this
[1:52:02] together there is no Invincible men
[1:52:08] here Ministry always like they're
[1:52:10] they're on the victory side because when
[1:52:12] we preach it's the better version of
[1:52:14] oursel because it's the anointing
[1:52:17] because it's the word and and we get
[1:52:19] caught up in that Supernatural
[1:52:21] atmosphere and it's the best version of
[1:52:24] ourself and when people see that
[1:52:26] sometime they're mistaken I wish I'd be
[1:52:28] like brother Steve I wish I'd be like
[1:52:30] brother already I wish I'd be like this
[1:52:32] minister they look so great they look so
[1:52:34] strong that's why the word has to be
[1:52:36] truly honest that yes the word is
[1:52:39] Almighty the anointing of God is
[1:52:41] extremely powerful but us a human being
[1:52:43] we going to go to the thick and to the
[1:52:46] difficult
[1:52:52] and if we're not doing
[1:52:54] that if we don't train the church and
[1:52:58] teach the church to the reality of the
[1:53:01] spiritual warfare we are creating
[1:53:04] trainings
[1:53:06] cars somebody heard about that training
[1:53:08] cars if you've been training uh a law
[1:53:11] enforcement firefighters
[1:53:14] paramedics they probably taught you
[1:53:16] training
[1:53:17] cars training cars is that
[1:53:22] when you go to school trying to learn
[1:53:25] your work it's
[1:53:27] practice and training SCS is that when
[1:53:30] you practice something but it's not
[1:53:33] perfectly fit for the real
[1:53:37] life I'll give you an
[1:53:40] example one of my friend in in Quebec
[1:53:43] he's a paramedic but he's also a teacher
[1:53:45] he teached a paramedics and he
[1:53:48] said at one point he says we were
[1:53:50] teaching the the student that they they
[1:53:52] had a um they would they would have to
[1:53:55] take the Pulse on a
[1:53:58] mannequin so he has no
[1:54:00] pulse take their arm and then the
[1:54:03] teacher would tell them you know the pul
[1:54:06] you know 75 or 85 and so they train all
[1:54:10] the time they take the Pulse take the
[1:54:11] arm take the Pulse and look at the
[1:54:13] teacher to get the
[1:54:15] number but then when they got in real
[1:54:18] life they took the arm and look at the
[1:54:21] teacher
[1:54:22] because now he was a real
[1:54:24] person and and and in real person in
[1:54:27] training like the teacher like you're
[1:54:29] looking at me but there's a real pulse
[1:54:31] now it's not a mannequin it's a real
[1:54:34] person that's training scars is that you
[1:54:37] create an habit of being of training but
[1:54:41] not in the real world and when you get
[1:54:43] in the real
[1:54:44] world you fail cuz you are not prepared
[1:54:53] I don't know if you heard about the new
[1:54:54] Hall
[1:54:56] shooting but some of the first
[1:54:58] identified fatal training scars is the
[1:55:01] law enfor enforcement context secured in
[1:55:04] a gunfight in 1970 later referred to as
[1:55:08] the new Hall Massacre during this
[1:55:10] gunfight four California Highway Patrol
[1:55:13] officers were killed in less than five
[1:55:15] minutes and the officers displaced
[1:55:18] several training scars that day which
[1:55:20] may have led to their death
[1:55:29] the prophet
[1:55:36] says he says it's what in the kid that
[1:55:38] made up the kid what's on the inside of
[1:55:41] you and what you are now is what you're
[1:55:43] to probably be the rest of your life
[1:55:45] you're on a changing
[1:55:47] spot do you know what 86% of the
[1:55:50] conversions to Jesus Christ is done
[1:55:52] before 21 years
[1:55:56] old it shows it statistics shows it 86%
[1:56:01] that come to Christ come before they're
[1:56:03] 21 after you pass that age you become
[1:56:07] more molded and set in your ways oh it's
[1:56:12] possible sure they come 70 80 years old
[1:56:14] but it's very rare why because what we
[1:56:18] keep doing
[1:56:20] repetitively we become
[1:56:22] that and after that we've been like the
[1:56:25] prophet says after we've been molded
[1:56:27] into that it becomes even harder to
[1:56:30] change our
[1:56:31] ways young people you got to be careful
[1:56:35] if you come to church just to play to
[1:56:37] church and you're not serious you are
[1:56:39] setting yourself
[1:56:41] up you're setting your ways that you are
[1:56:45] training yourself to be
[1:56:49] fake and and it becomes automatic you
[1:56:52] got to be
[1:56:57] careful so the officer were not used to
[1:57:00] recoil the rec of The Recoil for their
[1:57:02] three 57 Magnum hand guns having only
[1:57:05] fire 38 Special rounds in training and
[1:57:09] their lack of familiarity with the
[1:57:11] Magnum rounds may have contributed to
[1:57:13] their poor poor shooting performance so
[1:57:15] when they were practicing they were
[1:57:17] practicing with a with a gun that didn't
[1:57:19] have a lot of recoil but in real life
[1:57:21] when they started toot shooting for real
[1:57:22] they were not used because they were not
[1:57:25] trained in real
[1:57:28] world and I can't apply that to our
[1:57:31] church where if if we just want to get
[1:57:34] people happy and excited and oh God is
[1:57:36] good and praise the Lord and we are not
[1:57:38] preaching about the reality of life
[1:57:41] people are not prepared and they are
[1:57:43] clueless of the cost that's going to
[1:57:46] come for taking a stand for the
[1:57:50] Lord growing will come with a
[1:57:55] price one officer carried his shotgun at
[1:57:58] Port Arms positioned with the shotgun
[1:58:00] stock resting and so in in in in the gun
[1:58:04] range for safety purpose the cops had
[1:58:07] their shotgun resting on on the belt and
[1:58:10] the muzzle in the air yeah so while
[1:58:13] approach approaching the two dangerous
[1:58:15] armed criminal they had their gun like
[1:58:17] this approaching so he got shot before
[1:58:19] he was able because that's how they
[1:58:21] practice they practice they didn't
[1:58:24] practice for real danger they were not
[1:58:27] trained for spiritual
[1:58:29] war they were trained out praise the
[1:58:32] lord we believe a prophet everything's
[1:58:33] going to be automatic like David praise
[1:58:36] the Lord I listen to the prophet praise
[1:58:38] the Lord I believe the prophet praise
[1:58:39] the Lord the prophet has anointed me but
[1:58:42] he was not
[1:58:43] ready he didn't know that when he was
[1:58:45] going out I've listened and believe a
[1:58:47] prophet and anointing that now there was
[1:58:49] a war before he would be able to on the
[1:58:52] throne in
[1:58:57] rain it's less exciting to hear a sermon
[1:59:00] like
[1:59:01] that we're more excited to hear praise
[1:59:03] the Lord of sons of God and all that and
[1:59:05] you're still sons of God by the
[1:59:10] way but why am I preaching like that
[1:59:13] it's because when you're going to get in
[1:59:15] the thick of it God's going to bring
[1:59:17] back this sermon and then and because
[1:59:20] some of you are not understanding what
[1:59:22] I'm saying right now and it's it's not a
[1:59:24] problem God the holy spirit will bring
[1:59:26] back those words in a thick when you're
[1:59:29] going going to be in your room crying
[1:59:30] and Lord H it is so difficult I don't
[1:59:33] know I can make it then the Holy Ghost
[1:59:34] will say go listen again that sermon of
[1:59:36] Brother Steve that's what he was talking
[1:59:43] about and another officer fired
[1:59:46] Remington 870 so fast that he actually
[1:59:48] ejected a live round he was killed with
[1:59:51] an empty shotgun in his hand and it has
[1:59:54] been alleged that rapid fire shotgun
[1:59:55] training was not part of chp's firearms
[1:59:58] C curriculum at the time and the
[2:00:00] officer's lack of familiarity with the
[2:00:02] weapon led to his potential fatal error
[2:00:05] so when they studied that case all the
[2:00:07] four polic men made a mistake related to
[2:00:10] their
[2:00:12] training they had not been trained to
[2:00:16] face real
[2:00:17] situation and from that they wrote a
[2:00:20] book and and and police training has
[2:00:23] changed to get closer to the
[2:00:26] reality and we've been we've been around
[2:00:29] long enough I've been raised in church
[2:00:32] we I was not prepared in my generation I
[2:00:36] was not prepared to face life right we
[2:00:40] need a generation who is ready to go out
[2:00:44] there and carry the gospel and ready to
[2:00:48] go to war ready to have setbacks ready
[2:00:52] to have a failure and pick yourself up
[2:00:54] again and keep
[2:00:56] fighting oh I hope tonight we inspired
[2:00:59] some
[2:01:01] courage and another officer maybe not in
[2:01:05] that case but they found officer that
[2:01:07] were dead that had empty shell in their
[2:01:10] pocket you know why because at the gun
[2:01:12] range they were taught to get to pick
[2:01:14] their empty shells to keep the gun range
[2:01:16] clean so they were shooting and when
[2:01:18] they were reloading they were picking
[2:01:20] empty shells and got shot
[2:01:25] it's unfortunate for those
[2:01:29] men but we're not talking about them
[2:01:31] tonight we're talking about us
[2:01:38] amen I'm closing for those who
[2:01:43] worries shell shock
[2:01:54] when
[2:01:54] Peter was following the Lord he didn't
[2:01:58] have a clue how difficult it would
[2:02:01] become he had followed Jesus and every
[2:02:03] time there was a tough
[2:02:05] situation you have 5,000 men they want
[2:02:07] to be fed we don't have no food we ask
[2:02:10] Jesus he's going to take care of the
[2:02:14] situation we don't have money for the
[2:02:16] tax collector we go fish a fish there's
[2:02:18] money give it for me and you and every
[2:02:21] time they were with Jesus somebody dies
[2:02:23] he raised them up somebody comes he's
[2:02:25] sick and they're walking with Jesus and
[2:02:27] Jesus always has the answer for them
[2:02:29] because they're in their
[2:02:31] childhood Jesus do everything for
[2:02:35] them he Shield them they're they're like
[2:02:37] behind the Shar not Jesus is not the
[2:02:40] Shar but I mean they're
[2:02:42] sheltered but when Jesus is
[2:02:45] arrested Jesus warns
[2:02:48] them it's going to be tough
[2:02:52] and Jesus Peter is like no Lord I'm
[2:02:54] ready to die for you yeah
[2:02:59] wait you don't know what I'm talking
[2:03:02] about so when Jesus get
[2:03:06] arrested and the heat comes upon all the
[2:03:09] disciples and now suddenly Jesus is not
[2:03:11] the flavor of the hour
[2:03:13] anymore now it's a shame to be with
[2:03:16] Jesus it gets you in
[2:03:18] trouble
[2:03:20] Peter melt
[2:03:22] inside he is not ready to face the Heat
[2:03:27] and he denies knowing Jesus three
[2:03:30] times and when that
[2:03:33] happened he just collapsed those three
[2:03:37] years and a half doesn't mean anything
[2:03:39] for him now because he has collapsed
[2:03:41] first he had made for him three times
[2:03:44] the same
[2:03:46] mistake and so he melt and collapse and
[2:03:50] he run away and he bitterly cry and you
[2:03:53] know when hap what
[2:03:56] happened he falls back to his default
[2:04:04] program he goes back to his childhood
[2:04:10] stuff says well we'll go we're going to
[2:04:12] go
[2:04:19] fishing so many unprepared
[2:04:23] people got converted received the Holy
[2:04:25] Ghost they get all excited I want to do
[2:04:27] something for Jesus
[2:04:34] byang Shell
[2:04:36] Shocked you want to quit
[2:04:39] everything now it's the thick of it now
[2:04:42] it these are real
[2:04:44] bombs now there's real damages There's
[2:04:47] real Church division family uh this and
[2:04:51] that and Lord I like he I didn't know
[2:04:53] that was it was not to be Christian I
[2:04:55] thought that Christian would be and then
[2:04:57] we had imagination of something so
[2:05:03] easy but you got to go through that
[2:05:05] process and shake out of it maybe
[2:05:07] there's somebody sitting here tonight
[2:05:09] that inside of you that's who you are
[2:05:11] right now you're going to the thick of
[2:05:14] it and you say Lord I didn't expect it
[2:05:16] to be that
[2:05:18] difficult your pastor can talk about it
[2:05:21] we have men of God here that went
[2:05:22] through
[2:05:24] that you got married oh
[2:05:28] my for the better and the
[2:05:32] better for health and health and riches
[2:05:34] over
[2:05:36] riches we have no clue when we're 20 21
[2:05:41] 22 right we say for the better or the
[2:05:43] worse but worse we don't hear it it's
[2:05:45] just a word no for us it's going to be
[2:05:47] for the better for health and for riches
[2:05:49] Hallelujah
[2:05:56] and then goes the first argument under
[2:05:58] there goes the first situation and
[2:05:59] you're like who are you that girl I
[2:06:03] don't
[2:06:04] know why do you didn't show yourself in
[2:06:06] the
[2:06:07] courtship who are you guy like I I I
[2:06:11] thought you like in the courtship you
[2:06:13] look mature you always said the right
[2:06:14] thing and had the the right attitude you
[2:06:17] know what's my advice for young people
[2:06:18] in
[2:06:19] courtship take your time to see the
[2:06:22] worst of that
[2:06:25] person and you want to see the worst in
[2:06:27] that
[2:06:28] person delay them a little bit
[2:06:32] more and watch their
[2:06:37] reaction rub them on the other
[2:06:40] side the problem sometime in courtship
[2:06:43] oh I'm so out of my notes and I'm trying
[2:06:44] to quit honestly I'm trying to quit well
[2:06:46] you're responsible cuz you're pulling
[2:06:52] sometimes the problem with courtship is
[2:06:54] we're trying to show such a best the
[2:06:57] best version of
[2:06:59] ourself which is normal It's Perfectly
[2:07:05] Normal but we have to see and so you
[2:07:08] enter into marriage for the best for the
[2:07:10] riches for the
[2:07:12] health and suddenly one day there's an
[2:07:15] argument of situation and and and
[2:07:17] there's a serious crisis and you are so
[2:07:22] shocked inside of you that's how you
[2:07:25] look and then you want to
[2:07:28] quit you want to quit because nobody
[2:07:31] told me that we would we we would go
[2:07:33] through a crisis like that in our
[2:07:34] marriage nobody told me that we would go
[2:07:37] in a crisis like that in our
[2:07:39] church yes Crisis happen in the best
[2:07:43] churches Crisis happen in the best
[2:07:47] marriage but when that happened we call
[2:07:49] it to be shell shock we want to quit
[2:07:53] because we didn't count the cost that's
[2:07:55] why Jesus says before you build a tower
[2:07:57] before you go to war sit
[2:07:59] down and count the costs you got to know
[2:08:04] what you're getting
[2:08:06] into I'm not selling to you tonight an
[2:08:08] easy War we going to win brother and
[2:08:11] sister that's guaranteed all you have to
[2:08:14] do is show up and report for
[2:08:17] Duty God will fight for you the only
[2:08:21] thing God is asking you is report for
[2:08:24] duty but as we've seen you you've you've
[2:08:27] listened to the gender confusion series
[2:08:29] when men lose they go hide in the cave
[2:08:32] they
[2:08:33] quit but God doesn't want us to quit God
[2:08:36] wants us to report for Duty he want us
[2:08:39] to be men of
[2:08:43] Courage amen
[2:08:53] praise the
[2:08:56] Lord I'm closing with this verse Hebrews
[2:08:59] chapter
[2:09:00] 10 for ye need have for ye have need of
[2:09:06] patience that after ye have done the
[2:09:09] will of
[2:09:10] God ye might
[2:09:13] receive the
[2:09:15] promise so the Bible is saying is after
[2:09:18] you've done the will of God you need
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:26] Pence you're on a
[2:09:29] mission and you don't know what's the
[2:09:32] next
[2:09:33] step if You' have told me and this
[2:09:36] October it's going to be 25 years in the
[2:09:38] ministry for me that number is
[2:09:40] just I don't understand it because after
[2:09:43] seven service I was
[2:09:45] done and if You' have told me that I
[2:09:47] would become a pastor and it would this
[2:09:49] this this I was I would it's a good
[2:09:50] thing to God didn't tell me
[2:09:53] that because I was not big enough
[2:09:58] inside to carry that position so what he
[2:10:02] did to me is that he unloaded a little
[2:10:03] bit at a time if you're faithful in
[2:10:06] little thing I'll give you more is what
[2:10:07] Jesus says and it's not that we're
[2:10:10] faithful in little because I want more I
[2:10:11] don't really want more but God has a
[2:10:16] greater purpose for us and every time
[2:10:19] that you reach your calling and you're
[2:10:21] like okay I'm good praise the Lord I I
[2:10:24] got this don't stop God is about to add
[2:10:29] more God is about to add
[2:10:32] more because he wants you to
[2:10:34] grow this is spiritual growth
[2:10:38] time that's barhead musician can come
[2:10:51] while we have our heads bowed maybe
[2:10:53] musicians can play Softly and Tenderly
[2:10:56] Jesus is
[2:10:57] calling calling for
[2:11:00] you and for
[2:11:02] me Lord
[2:11:06] Jesus I hope Lord I was too negative
[2:11:10] tonight but it's something I've noticed
[2:11:12] Lord in many Christian
[2:11:16] people they're not ready for war
[2:11:22] because we are contaminated by the
[2:11:25] world where everything is about having
[2:11:27] good time be with the friends be with
[2:11:30] people we like having good time seeking
[2:11:33] pleasure seeking greatest comfort and
[2:11:36] every time something goes against that
[2:11:39] we Rebel we we hurt we don't understand
[2:11:42] we're confused because we're so wired
[2:11:45] with comfort and seeking
[2:11:48] pleasure and that goes against
[2:11:50] everything thing that the gospel is
[2:11:52] calling us which is to lay our life give
[2:11:56] our life husband loved your wife like
[2:11:58] Christ has loved the church that he gave
[2:12:00] his life it means there's a price to
[2:12:05] pay well sometime Lord many times we're
[2:12:07] not ready for that because we've
[2:12:11] been we've been contaminated by the
[2:12:17] world we may be in your house we may be
[2:12:19] as son and daughters of God and may be
[2:12:21] some of us tonight we realize yeah my
[2:12:23] life is built about around seeking
[2:12:25] comfort and seeking pleasure is that
[2:12:28] what you want from me Lord and it's not
[2:12:30] Lord that we're going to suffer for
[2:12:32] suffering that's not the
[2:12:34] purpose but we don't want to step out of
[2:12:36] your will because there's
[2:12:40] sufferings pray Lord as I leave these
[2:12:43] people that something tonight has
[2:12:45] inspired courage for mothers that are
[2:12:49] right now in the thick of it
[2:12:53] that they thought that raising kids was
[2:12:55] amazing and all romantic and all nice
[2:12:57] and it
[2:12:58] is but sometime there's deep
[2:13:01] valleys where we don't have the
[2:13:04] answer and then you're on your knees
[2:13:06] says Lord I didn't know it was that
[2:13:11] hard Lord I love this man he's my
[2:13:14] husband I know you gave it to me but I
[2:13:15] didn't know it would be that hard to for
[2:13:17] him to understand me and me
[2:13:19] understanding him Lord I'm confused new
[2:13:22] and then we doubt because it gets
[2:13:24] difficult we're like Lord was was all
[2:13:26] this from
[2:13:27] you I'm wondering if David
[2:13:30] sometime was watching the stars and say
[2:13:32] Lord was it really real that Samuel
[2:13:34] really anointed me
[2:13:36] like now I'm a run away my own people
[2:13:39] are my own Army is trying to kill me I
[2:13:41] live in cave I live like a
[2:13:44] renegade was it really real
[2:13:46] lord you never told me it would be that
[2:13:49] difficult
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:54] pray Lord that you send your Holy Spirit
[2:13:56] tonight a spirit of
[2:13:59] comforter we don't want to measure your
[2:14:01] call by the level of pain we don't want
[2:14:04] to measure our position in Christ by the
[2:14:06] level of difficulties never your Prophet
[2:14:09] never you told us it would be easy but
[2:14:12] you said Lord that you would be with us
[2:14:14] until the end of the world and you are
[2:14:17] faithful you stood with Mary you
[2:14:19] defended David never Saul was allowed to
[2:14:22] kill David it would have never
[2:14:24] happen because you had a
[2:14:27] purpose and Lord you have a purpose for
[2:14:29] these people
[2:14:30] tonight Inspire courage to your people
[2:14:34] renew hope and courage to everyone of
[2:14:37] them if somebody's in the valley tonight
[2:14:40] Lord may your voice reach that deep deep
[2:14:43] down in that Valley to tell them I have
[2:14:45] not forsaken you I am training you I am
[2:14:50] growing in inside of you for you to
[2:14:52] become the woman that I see I see a king

[2:15:34] Lord Hear My
[2:15:36] Cry hiding in a g in a
[2:15:40] cave

[2:15:46] wanted to die shell shocked
[2:15:51] the day before he had such a Revival
[2:15:53] killed all the prophet the anointing was
[2:15:55] there but then he got threatened he ran
[2:15:58] away hid in a cave he was Shell Shocked
[2:16:00] now his life is in danger now it's not
[2:16:02] fun to serve God anymore oh Mont Carmel

[2:16:07] great but then the next day was not that
[2:16:10] great and we don't cope right Lord with

[2:21:00] must be perfect like your heavenly
[2:21:02] father is perfect in terms of maturity
[2:21:05] you need to be mature amen but maturity
[2:21:09] comes at a
[2:21:10] price life is hard and life was meant to
[2:21:13] be
[2:21:15] hard when we accept that life is hard
[2:21:18] then it becomes less hard because we
[2:21:20] know that there's a purpose in us and I
[2:21:22] love that principle if you look at it
[2:21:24] from a vision perspective if you look at
[2:21:26] where you are heading and if you look at
[2:21:28] what the purpose is while you're here
[2:21:30] then you understand why you go through
[2:21:32] things the things is not easier just
[2:21:35] because we know they are expected I mean
[2:21:39] God works in us and God I mean like I I
[2:21:42] love the the the the balance here
[2:21:45] because this morning and and over the

[2:21:58] the rubbish out of the way amen yes sir
