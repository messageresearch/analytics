be here trust you've been enjoying the services amen I have certainly and trust that you all are not too tired not too sleepy um when I say my God richly richly bless you in 2023 amen and and the blessings to be after is not something to improve I mean the blessings I want to wish you is eternal blessings amen we we want to gather on the other side Hallelujah we want to we want to look forward to an eternity spent with one another but most of all with our blessed savior Hallelujah I um maybe I I wonder if I can is brother Tony Murray who is with his brother Tony brother Tony would you open the the meeting in Pre this morning if you don't mind um well brother Tony is coming I I just have a prayer request here a prayer request for Zoe he is heavily medicated for depression and this is like being in a prison cell and asks God for deliverance and also a request for Margaret manderson who's also suffering from depression so we'll pray for that and as brother Tony come up if you ever need this morning you can also express it to the Lord and we'll lift it up together to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we're we're just so glad we can gather in your presence Lord and look my head into 2023 we don't know what this year will hold but as long as we know that you're holding our hand it's the thing that we're relying on Lord Jesus you brought us thus far and even just seeing the Breather and here many of us come from many years ago we've been walking this way but we're so thankful Lord that you've been holding our hand Lord now as we gather for this service this morning just pray that you'd give a liberty to brother Marcus did he just better say those things that you've put on his heart Lord you brought him here I Believe by inspiration we're just uh we thank you for that Lord and just ask now that we would also enter into that same inspiration Lord where we can hear from you a lot of the different needs that are here you know us each one Lord and I just pray that you'd meet those needs draw us to yourself Lord help us to be in the right position so that we can hear from you now we ask and pray and ask your blessing in Jesus name amen God bless you praise the lord well I want to say a special welcome to all our visitors I know there's some people still driving and so forth but I'm going to say may God make each one feel very very welcome this morning um I this is always a a difficult thing to find the balance in um because I know different cultures and different Church cultures have different ways of dealing with it so I'll just I'll just say look we in a taranakinian we're going to do it you know the Stratford Way but but I'm one of those guys I don't like to be called Pastor and I don't want to be lifted up and you know that's and and we're not here to lift any man up or any man up amen but at the same time also we we want to acknowledge um you know Warriors of the faith and we want to acknowledge also many churches that have supported this weekend and we we want to acknowledge and say thank you to to pastors and to churches that have uh you know come here themselves and send people and then made announcements and all of those things so I wonder if I could just ask for a moment any ministers and bastards that are here can you just stand up and we just want to acknowledge you for a moment because it's not lifting up main but this is lifting up what God is doing in lives amen praise the Lord I think there's a few more that's just shy Amy thank you relatez amen God bless you Brothers may the Lord richly bless you amen may the Lord continue to to inspire you and Lead You use you for his flock amen we also have local visitors and we have visitors from all sorts of places I know that also these services are being streamed from from many places in the world so I want to also say to all those who are streaming live God bless you welcome we we want to want everyone to feel welcome this morning I don't know that yesterday there was just a Vibe here but this morning it seems like you're tired man I think we should get I think before Simon gets us going on singing he needs to do a few burpees with us or something that's his specialty but um I trust you're excited about the services this morning I mean I trust we come with your cups held our high to to receive what God has for us am I going to say again I know I'm I'm repeating myself but if there's any need that you have any any visitors that's unsure about where to find the bathroom or anything like that speak to the Deacon Brothers at the back and they can point you in the right direction but also say if you come here with with fears and you come here with you know self-pity and with complexes and with hurts and with all those things it's okay right because church is a place where we come for healing but don't come here one thing to feel sorry for yourself and one thing to hold on to your hurts and wanting to hold on to your complexes I mean the whole point of hospital is to get people healed time not to put a burden on the taxpayers money we can never be a burden for God right but we want to come for healing we want to come for a closer walk with God I mean we want to look forward to to 2023 and and you know I hope I don't embarrass people too much but these you know specific young men here and another lady sitting here somewhere that's also particularly excited about this year I mean getting married in couple weeks you know they have very specific requirements and I don't know if God Honors that kind of requirements you know if time just go fast and then certain date Let It Go Slow for a week or so amen praise the Lord but you know we just we just I know it's a little bit of humor but we we're just family and we just want to be you know honoring God and and serving God together we want to spend eternity together so we might as well get used to one another now Hallelujah um I just want to ask maybe can you guys just put that PowerPoint up again I shared these things on Friday and I'm just going to repeat that this morning there's a recently when we went to Vanuatu brother Adrian and I saw a um that brother pathio now I know many of you know brother pethio he's a solid message Minister has been serving the lord for for years got a solid revelation of the word and so he had a misfortune a few years ago that um the the island where his church was had a volcano and the whole island was basically evacuated and and he lost his congregation and and lost access to his building and so forth and they've been pottering on for a few years now they've got they basically get together in in his house and under very uncomfortable circumstances and they're really too many for the house as it is and so so we want to support them to build a church that you can see on the pictures they've they've done a lot themselves so far but they they need in the order of 12 000 New Zealand dollars in order to finish the church um and and fit out the church and so forth so I felt and I and I don't want to abuse this time together but I felt if if there's any one of you here that would love to support it we're not pulling for money this is not the focus of the of the convention and God has provided for us to to put up the convention and all of that we're not pulling for money at all but if God places on your heart to support this project I would really appreciate it if you can um put cash in the offering box and again I'll explain why we want to do this cache the the government has put limitations on how much money we can spend on overseas Mission work um and we are we are kind of very dangerously close to those limits so we we don't want to get ourselves in trouble but we found a sensible and government accepted way of getting the money there and and I promise you we'll treat that money very carefully we'll keep record of it and all of that but what it does mean is because it's not going to go through the charity we're not going to issue uh ird receipts which means you won't be able to claim that as a as a taxable donation to a charity so just so that everyone understands that process and the purpose for that and if you have any questions feel free to come speak to me um so but if you if you want to support that that would be lovely um I bring greetings from Brother Andrew Donaldson in the church in Auckland and they've asked me to to make an announcement about the Auckland Easter convention so we just want to make sure that you all especially that website web address make sure you get it so Brother David Seiler is coming God willing and and by waiting for another brother to confirm and I think the message is be quick if if the last few months is any indication time flies very very quickly until these things come around so make sure you get your your accommodation booked early and so forth and then there's some that I would like to um to just run past you and I guess specifically the streamers need to listen up very carefully to that brother Marcus is has asked if it would be possible for tomorrow morning service to be focused more on the youth and he wants to he wants to be himself he doesn't want to be inhibited by wondering who's watching from the other side of the world and how are they going to interpret it so what we're going to do is tomorrow morning's service other than we previously announced we're not going to live stream it um we're going to have the private stream available just for our you know people working in the kitchen and and so forth that won't be able to sit through the service but publicly we're not going to live stream the service tomorrow morning just so that he can you know not get himself in trouble so we all understand that we appreciate that and so and I think the other message is make sure the youth is here tomorrow morning because it's going to be focused a little on them all right any questions anything that we can do for you any help that you need on anything yes sir yes now in fact we'll put it stronger than that we want the older people here people here even though please don't be offended that we call you older it's just older right it's not old all right but we we want you here and and we'd love you to support the services maybe what we can do is we can reserve like the first three rows in front for the young people and we ask the young people to sit in front and then us all these will sit at the back I'll keep myself out of trouble by putting it that way I mean so I trust you really to have church I don't want to take too much time I know we have a few song items and things that that we want to get through so I don't want to carry on too much but let's just kick off with the song and

this new year we really want to thank you Father and ask you for grace and mercy and Lord may you reveal your plan may you change your father we don't want to be just message Believers and ugly in our

because those who bless Israel they are blessed father may you bless the church back home and father may you speak to our hearts so we ask for the blessing for the speaker mate I find the right words

God bless you all your ministry and may we open the word of the Lord in a wonderful way and really you want to greet you from all of my heart and if I'm not mistaken I see my good friend brother Paul here brother Paul is a pleasure to see I mean so I um really happy to see you my my brother my friend and all the ministering brothers that are here I really see that I just have to explain myself I came from far and uh two days to come two days to go and brought the arrowhead on his heart that I take all the services but it's not because I'm a better preacher because I know no New Zealand has very very good preachers you know and I wanted to come just preach Jesus love you but I found a better not do this if you have that kind of ministers that are here so I'm very very privileged and really uh wish you the very very best from my heart amen so so let us open the word of the Lord in the Book of Matthew and um Matthew chapter 12 verse 38 and Hallelujah I mean Matthew chapter 12 38. and he says then a certain of the scribes and the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation and brother Brandon made clear said that's this generation Jesus was speaking prophetically for our time that's what he says and even an adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was there three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they are repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold the greater than Jonas is here may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word we may be seated and again I want to thank brother El Rey for the nice invitation I want to be honest with you I didn't have on my heart to come I really wanted to make some holidays but he was pulling so strong and now I feel it I'm really really happy to be among you you know I could I cannot say it's the best place for me because maybe somebody from home streams in and then I have to give an answer when I'm coming back home but it has been a wonderful time so far and we we are really thankful to to our wonderful Lord Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now what I realized um on tomorrow morning I'm very happy that we have a real youth service and I'm really really practical and very dramatically with the young people and I thank for the array for for arranging it that way because not everybody understands it you know and so we have to pay attention that we are not calling critics and he said what is what is he doing here and there but sometimes we want to come a little bit on the level of the youngsters okay so it's so so to play certain things how it works in church maybe we see a little video and certain things and this evening I would like to call I I know I'm I'm I was repeating myself but I'm always involving that subject I want to speak about healing by the third pool I would like to talk about many many things that can happen to us if it's child abuse if it's if it's if it's traumas if it's uh misunderstandings if it's um hurted feelings if it's whatever it is um broken families broken hearts uh bitterness many many things pass our way and we are part of it though we have received the Holy Spirit but there's a part that we are struggling with okay so in and and and and we show a little bit the subconscious and things so far and so that nobody uh has the impression that we're seeking preaching psychology we preach everything out of the message of the hour but this morning I would like to speak about the most inner part of us which is the real answer and uh so that we see that the two Services just in one okay um for the service of of of uh that we had during the time okay uh different different different thoughts that we have it's it's so important you must understand brother Brian said if we're preaching Calvinism it leads to a dead end if we are preaching arminianism and we learned this I mean if we're preaching arminism brother Brahm said it leads you to a dead end so how you bring two things together you have to understand we have two groups of people we have the church and we have the bride I mean that is so important the bride has another Covenant than the church the church is whosoever let him come praise the Lord the bride she is part of him that's different but if you were not in him in the beginning you cannot come back to him Redemption is bringing back to your formal Estates that's not for the church that's for the bride many will receive eternal life at the white Throne judgment even by their deeds but he doesn't tell that they were with him in with him in the beginning but the bride will be with him all together and here I will prove it to you just by a little verse in the Bible you don't have to read it with me but you believe me that's here okay it says in Hebrews and you put on your spiritual jacket and you let let believe the Bible like the Bible is it says this Hebrews chapter 2 verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and though they who are Sanctified are all of One uh-huh for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers we come from the same source great Jesus is is he's the ma he's the Redeemer he's the Messiah he's everything but at the same time he's my brother and brother REM could sing he's my father he's my mother he's my brother my sister is everything to me because we come from the same family we don't have the same uh Ministry because he was the Redeemer and I'm the one who is redeemed he's the male and I'm the female he's the bright woman I'm the bride but we come from the same source blessed be the name of the Lord as we were hearing yesterday and you and and I will just repeat to make myself a little to warm me a little bit up uh we showed yesterday the family of God in the mind of God according to the logos and so forth and um brother Wayne makes a quote he says he says God was alone with his thoughts in other words he wasn't alone he was alone with his thoughts and we were saying as we were seeing yesterday God was not thinking his thoughts were already Eternal they were part of gods that's what brother blame says so in what form Ever you have your own fantasy about it I know that there's quotes that even uh brother Ram said we were those angels uh not believing Satan's side but I'm not preaching it here because then it brings more confusion than to help you leave it up to the local pastor but these things are there in God's in in the message of the hour and what I want to say this too is I see some visitors that we have way in the back and I really want to welcome you and it's a great thing that you are here I know that this morning we are we are using a little bit message vocabulary okay so don't be frustrated okay come back okay we have our a little bit our own speech if I if I go to some country and I always ask please uh please pick me up at the airport at the railway station or whatever and sometimes they don't know me and then they I do not know them so the thing is I'm watching in their eyes a little bit is a question mark and they look in my eyes with a question mark and if I don't know if the brother I said third pool you understand nobody understands Circle only who's in the message [Applause] and he said third pull okay code words uh so so by this and and let's let's let me do it like like I did all the time I'm more coaching this morning I'm talking to you it's quite a deep subject it's wonderful um please brothers and sisters I know that here is quite ministers here's Elders they know the message the same as me you understand one thing you cannot bring the whole balance of a subject in 90 minutes it's not possible okay I cannot nobody can do that okay you cannot bring every aspect in 19 minutes it's not possible please bear that there are some aspects that are not touched okay but we try to be as balanced as possible because we will see one thing we're dealing with the sign of Jonah and Jesus was asked the question please give us a sign he said and a wicked in adulterous generation asked for a sign and there is no sign to be given only the sign of the prophet Jonah as he will be in the in in the valley of as he was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights and we realize that this is a shadow on the Lord Jesus Christ definitely so but we are having right now a problem if we believe the Bible because Jesus wasn't in the grave for three days and three nights okay we are already in trouble and the Bible can only be open brother bear said by a prophetic type of people amen because Jesus he would he was crucified that is very sure on just before the Sabbath there was Friday evening and he was in his grave Friday night Saturday and he rose up Sunday morning that makes at maximum two nights and brother Ben was asked the question brother Brian said yes but in between of three days we know that this question but we believe that the Bible doesn't lie we believe God knows what he says and and so brother Abraham said prophecies have a compound meaning sometimes a double meaning and now let's see how how how Jesus how Christ how the word was in the veil in the Valley of the Earth for three days and three nights and how it came out okay can you say Amen to this okay so you lay so you lay back please oh do you have my no please if the technicians will help me please lay back and um enjoy the message of the hour I know some of the young teenagers I want to say here some quotes of brother Branham you're not frustrated okay I understand if you take five ten fifteen percent that's already wonderful just to have a certain overview um this morning we are not talking too much to the young people but we will but but you will have your place later I remember we came to the Holland convention and brother at basically was preaching there and I was always so frustrated I mean he talked about things that came out of the church I was frustrated why doesn't he talk about things that we understand and later what I was studying the message popped up what he said you have to understand that we're laying a seeds and then you read the message yourself and yet you remember okay that's what it is I never forgot I didn't understand but then I heard except that exist with something we lay a seed and and so never be frustrated if you just say your only thing I understand is railway station okay okay so so here's brother Branham and according to what we were seeing yesterday about the angel being our own theophany that's what brother Bremen said my personal Angel is our theophany and and it shows uh that is what sister Rebecca said she said when we left Jeffersonville to go to Tucson uh the car was packed and but brother Brandon his father her father just went into the car and she put up a little picture that uh she had over her bed and uh brought it into the car and they brought that picture up to Tucson and I want to say this if you want to get benefit of the message of the hour don't don't fall upon details I mean that person was discussing to me about there is no female angel and probably said there is no female angel though we can say yes there is our theophany amen but when he spoke he speaks about angel with two wings and there is no brother brain is right the Bible is right but still he made it that way because because the picture is more important god brother Ryan wanted to show his children look you are never alone there is a super there's a supernatural force and the Bible says only the redeem or brother REM said only the redeemed to have angels only day okay that's the difference already so there is someone who protects you along the way and he will protect you in 2023 that is the message not the critical part yes can it be uh is it is there a blunt Angel no matter how the angel but the message is so important it's the same for a minister you must wanting to understand the minister if not you're always hanging about the little little little Expressions here and there and and that's so important so we are not alone and you're not alone you have there's an angel that goes with you brother Branham never invented theophonies but he was the first messenger who could see in the other dimension he even if if Martin Luther if he would talk about Theophilus with Martin Luther now he would say uh stop that mystical nonsense it was not his time but here this is the time of the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God brother for us the Rapture is the most easy thing that is in the world the Rapture is just a normal step with us because we are already in the process they don't have a denominational thought of living in New Zealand and and just following the All Blacks all your life and here comes God is just changing you you are already in the process of the rapture you're already in it okay you're still living in laodicea but in your heart you're already in bright age you talk another language than every kiwi amen your heart is different and still you live here in that country can you say Amen make the next one please so we understand this I mean that that that before I answer to this uh this was the beginning of seven Church ages and we sold yesterday that the church was already a fallen Woman by the first messenger came though they had a true Pentecost but we understood that they did not know who they were I mean as Peter was the spokesman but Paul was the angel I'm and only the angel gets the mystery for the church age therefore she was a fallen woman right when Paul already came that that is so important to see God allowed it that the first church would fall Paul said uh because I showed it to you yesterday those who are here for today for the first time you look the book of Acts and they never said oh praise the Lord and first Messengers here they didn't know what the messenger was because that was installed on the Isle of Patmos in the vision that that John has for them Peter was the man of the hour but Peter never had the mystery it was Paul who had the mystery the first church never fell in sin because they had they were full of the Holy Ghost but they didn't know who they were and therefore amen it was like the second Eve who fell definitely so so this was the beginning now here is our story and it might Comfort your life because we have a Prophet by the name of Jonah and brother Brandon makes sure he was a prophet don't feel sorry with Jonah he was a prophet don't feel sorry please if you have a theophany don't feel sorry for yourself I'm not a great man because I'm coming to you from Germany to preach you I'm a great man because I'm a son of God at home I'm a janitor but I'm the same Marcus Becker the same Marcus back are cleaning the floors the same but in me I'm a son of a king I don't need audience to feel myself well amen because I know who I am and you know who you are this message showed us our true identity in the Garden of Eden nobody could even explain to Eve who she was amen she went to Mr elephant Mr elephant I would like to know what we are doing here an elephant said look I mean they're so wonderful to be in this God but I don't know where I'm coming from amen there was only one who could explain to Eve from where she comes and that was Adam and there is only one who can explain the the bride from where she comes and that is Christ himself no denomination could bring you that way can you say Amen that's so important to see so so we have a Prophet by the name of Jonah and he hears the voice and he knows what he should do and instead of going to Nineveh then he he he decided to to uh to go to take his ship to Tarsus and you said brother Ben something that is a paradox he said Jonah wasn't out of the will of God Jonah was in the will of the Lord so we think sometimes this brother is a pure disaster and this is a disaster but if you are a son of God nothing is a disaster God sees the end from the beginning God God knew one thing he's the father God knew I want I I'm not there to bless Jonah Jonah is blessed because he's a prophet of the Lord but there is a hundred and twenty thousand people that I want to save so they have a certain mind up so what I have to do as Jehovah God I have to come to them according to their understanding in other words they have to talk their language I have to come down so that they understand what I want to do but but I cannot send an arrogant uh israelian minister to them a man without the Holy Ghost he says look God told me for you to repent about you're not repenting anyhow so I'm happy that I see the fire falling man that was that because if you weren't Israel for them you were nothing you see so you can see how In Jonah he was so frustrated that God showed love and mercy even to the Gentiles can you say Amen definitely so no no I mean exactly God God is always correcting the error therefore he left Tarsus and Tarsus was the city where Peter came from exactly and Peter had the same opinion like like like like Jonah he said that's just wonderful but I will not go to these heathens amen and God showed him a vision God is always correcting the arrow the same city Tarsus blessed be the name but because God he had in his mind to be a father so he just thought he could flee God and sometimes God leads our way and it seems such a mistake and such a drama and such a disaster and God knows one thing I'm in control of everything it's my son so whatever happens to a person please do not frustrate nobody with your comments I mean because a man of God is in the hands of Gods and the daughter of God is in the hands of God we can pray for every situation but we always have to say Lord you know better brother brother I will deal with it this afternoon and I'm taking care of people who went left the message and who come back one of the curses in a local church is if there is a family problem or is there if there is a problem with young people or marriage or whatever and half of the church now tries to intervene into that situation it it makes it impossible to get a solution because I tell you if you're not equipped you will never see the picture you have your opinion you will just radicalize both sides you have to keep sometimes people out of that area so that God can speak to them personally can you say Amen so we see that God allowed for the first church to fall as Paul was not in the upper room brother Brennan was not in Azusa Street it had to be because if Paul would have been on the upper room and would have been recognized as the first messenger that church would have gone I would have went but God knew there are some kiwis some South Africans some Germans they want to be saved and God says we have to amen we have to stop the time a little bit I mean as as Paul said I'm a man born out of seasons in other words I came too late brother said I'm like Paul I'm a man born out of seasons um so first the outpouring of the Holy Ghost comes the falling of the church and here comes the messenger I mean God allows it because he has still people who should come in the future I mean make the next one please so we see this so we see how the Dark Ages come it's a spirit it's a Doctrine it's nicolasm it's it's it's it's it's it's um uh uh uh balamism whatever I mean and then it is a that little wife of Jezebel okay Dark Ages now this is German and I forgot to translate it but at least you can show how much I'm studying [Laughter] but when Reformation came the reason for reformation was not very spiritual at all that was just a money question okay you see for example you have the Anglican Church and I think it was one of the Kings Henry VII I'm not very very sure Henry the 8th or the sixth he wanted to he won he he was married to a young girl a queen from Spain so he wanted to be divorced from that little girl because she couldn't bear children and a king wants to have a successor he wants to have a Sons so he asked for divorce but the problem is they were catholic okay and normally he could now the Catholic church in Rome would have said there's no problem we were divorcing we are annuling that marriage but the problem is she came from Spain and Spain was more Catholic than England so the English king could only one say one thing um we feel on our hearts to have a Reformation but that was not spiritually because he wanted to marry again okay so so so we have the lutherans we have the those who are re-baptized and we have the calvinist now as we were learning Calvin was a man in he was a French living in in Switzerland that is correct yeah even the Swiss Swiss will not acknowledge it but he was French living in Switzerland that's what we learned from the Paul definitely so huh and for him that extreme Calvinism said you have to you are you are either chosen or you're not chosen yeah for the bride it's okay but not for the church okay your chosen your nachos and you have to prove your Choosing by being successfully in your uh business a true calvinist is working all day not spending money holiday is sin for them that is a calvinist life is working and praying nothing else amen that is the calvinist now you have to understand if I if we want to become calvinist let me say who wants to become calvinist nobody okay but I'm forcing you to become calvinist okay so what we are doing now we have in our wonderful church let me say maybe 200 people maybe some more some less no matter different one two three four no okay oh and I'm forced you to become calvinist if you want to change people's life without the Holy Spirit you can only do it by force that is the spirit of denominations in the message and out of the message or you have to give them an impression of we are so super special we are the Eagles of the message we are came out because we are more we are higher we are what we call an elite we have seen these things over and over I looked at the doctrines that came we are the Elite out of it we are the super Eagles and it sometimes Brother people say brother Marcus you are traveling please preach against false doctrines I always say this I will not waste my time because brother braeme said everything that had a beginning will have an end uh so let's read and if I'm forcing you I can only Force You by an extreme control and by fear definitely so and it came to pass that that in under Calvin families and people were observing one another I mean for example you go into uh you pass by the streets and you see a light a window and you see some blue lights flickering fluent and you could see that that must be a television oh oh Pastor I know something we have to pray for family Becca it seems they are looking they are looking Western John Wayne and so forth sin in the camp that was the thing so everybody was under under control one was controlling the other and you can imagine that pressure that was upon that people working making money if you were not successfully Spirit economically it means you are not chosen of Gods definitely so I mean therefore what I said yesterday please my range of possibilities is is a little bit limited as I said yesterday keep the Sunday keep it to be the Sunday I take care of people of young people I go to university they go to school I always tell them don't learn on a Sunday take take Monday to Saturday to do your work and leave it up to God for Sunday so I but if for example you have barbecue on Sunday that's not a sin if you invite me but that's not a problem but it's just an example I want to say don't make Sunday a common day please not Sunday is a holy day before the Lord every day is the holy day I know this but God has special times for us okay so we see that out of these kind of calvinistic thought Reformation thought the pilgrim fathers came out of it and these people they were holy and they were more holy and a real reformed person is extremely determinated amen he's determinated this was the beginning of what we call as a a Christian Christian or Evangelical or be Protestant working ethics that was the beginning you work you earn you have success you please God it was very successful in the world because you can see all the Catholic countries are poor and all the Protestant countries became rich because working was part of the religion uh have you ever heard do you have that word here in New Zealand what we call stealing God's time have you ever heard about that it's very common in Germany that is the typical thought of don't hang around don't sit around don't steal God's time do something work something that comes exactly from that Minds thought now here we have people they are holy they are clean and and they are determined they work they they they they they they they they they they they they they never hang around very disciplined it is the beginning of what we would call the Prosperity Gospel there it takes its beginning when brother Brahm said if God blesses you you got a Cadillac that was the beginning of that thought big church big Ministry big blessing small Church oh that's just brother Marcus God bless you that is the mindset more people more favor of God pure human way of thinking has nothing to do with a spiritual man not at all therefore I'm traveling sometimes to little groups and and just saying sharing but good people nine out of ten times I'm coming there and here comes the pastor the elders or some oh brother Marcus you have to you have to forgive but we are just a handful of people I said okay shall we now repent or what should we do about that do you feel sorry for yourself I'm not feeling sorry for myself because if you have five eagles so praise the Lord I tell you I prefer to five people who are who love the message instead 200 who sleep after 10 minutes already it's not the quantity brother it is the quality of people honest if you wanna if you want to be spiritual don't have a human way of thinking but these people are disciplined but I tell you one thing many people who are over disciplined who are successful they lose the feeling for the feeble person it is a winners religion it is for those who are strong who are brave but that Messenger changed that picture completely God allowed that he is a man who is standing in his own way to show that God has a way for the weak months Among Us for the feeble ones but from this kind of reformation now all the churches the Methodist the Baptists the Reformed Church the Mennonites all come out of them definitely so good people children of their time don't forget that was God's time for them it was not more revealed disciplined hearts if you are hard to yourself you become hard to others if you don't forgive yourself that is what some of the people I I cannot forgive me that I was forgetting this and this that is a typical form of being over disciplined with yourself you don't want to acknowledge that you live in a body who is not born again amen and you're now trying to change or to to to discipline that mammal and that brings you to a constant frustration if the Holy Spirit doesn't change you but you want to be changed to have a good appearance to other you choose the religious way that is now torture for your own children because the church does not wait until they are born again they must fit into the church that is a true disaster sometimes God calls us out into a disaster so that we think twice brother Branham said it like this and that is so nice you see job one day he he said to God if I could just knock at his door and God says in Revelation 3 you don't have to come to me to knock my door but I come to you I will knock at your door and brother mam said this job was perfect you know we all love to have families to have here's Papa Mama and then the children but God wants to move our clue make difficulties to see how we deal in the church with them I told you that little group that I'm taking care of I said if we treat people the right way God will send to us a lot of problems but but every church is a hospital but don't stay in that hospital amen be transformed and brother I have seen how God takes heals people from alcoholism from all kinds of perversion brings them back on their feet but takes a lot of love to do this can you say Amen so here's what brother brim said to to to to to to uh to to Joe about job he said job was such a perfect man but God said I would like to talk to you therefore he brought all that drama in his life everybody would say look what a Ministry and now that man is finished and he's finished and he's finished if you're a Son of God you're never finished never finished because I have a theophany I have a theophany I'm never finished maybe my Ministry is finished but that's not my most important thing I might see offer he doesn't become bigger because I get more invitation and it will not become smaller because I get no invitation anymore I live in another world can you say Amen so God sometime brings a lot of problems in our life because he likes to talk to us he feels that we are a little bit too religious every religious spirit is an arrogant spirit you can smear you can smell it you can feel oh first we despising all the unbelievers second thing we can walk over denomination like we want third we can walk about all the Pentecostals in the message in their word and nothing and and at the end it's only Us in my family who will make it's it it's a dead end can you say Amen so we are fighting against exactly this brother Marcus can that happen brother we come all out of these things I I preach about myself because we have that attitude and maybe we still have it but I said Lord I will not enter into heaven with that attitudes for me change me show me so much reality that I can bear with my brother who doesn't see it anymore the Bible says if somebody is is strong that he may help his weak brother not to despise and say oh man no revelation I tell you this and here you have it here my Eagle tie Eagle Bells Revelation 10 7. we we went through these things but the eagle must be in our hearts brother a loving Spirit you know who you are you know what Grace is now you can give Grace to your brother even you disagree but you say heavenly father the same one who gave me Revelation is the same who will give him revelation in his time can you say Amen amen make the next one please amen amen so here we have that is typical the what we call in Germany the pietists the Pirates loves to study the word which is not wrong in itself and to live a holy life which is okay which is fine only by the Holy Spirit but this is a typical picture of what we call the Puritans in the U.S okay the Puritans have their origin in the pilgrim fathers okay determined people so the picture speaks for itself the right one okay there's two things in life work and church and you can see how happy both are looking long hair long dress long face brother that is the spirit of denominationalism on what base will I enter into the into the Rapture because I'm more holy and I come to church Wednesday Sunday we're doing this that's fine but that's not the the Rapture is not a reward system it's not a bonus system God says okay how often and pain ties and brother you go to the Rapture because we have a theophany you were born with it it is older than you yourself if my Earthly body will be dissolved I have already a building which is eternal coming to church reading the message praying is expression of our gratitude to God blessed be the name of the Lord all the rest leads you into I want to be honest I want I want to kill that thing We Were Young in the message man we're still young but not young as we were so I was thinking we have a church a big church and I thought if God wants to choose who is going to the Rapture who will go and I thought by myself okay there's many people in the church that don't come on Wednesday and we have three services per week Friday Wednesday and even less come on Friday I was one who came Sunday Wednesday Friday so I thought okay okay it's not too bad it's not too bad okay then I went to Paris to a church because I thought God is just honoring our labor and then that is the that is our our entrance our ticket to go to to to to to to heaven or for the Rapture then I went to France and we had two services in uh during the day in Paris so morning service was over and we all went to a McDonald's to eat something and uh afternoon service was there a couple hours later like five or six and here was the wife of the pastor and I asked the pastor what is she doing he says now she all the time she's just sitting there and praying for the afternoon service so I saw by myself if God has to choose who prayed the most you see it's a dead end it must be the grace of God we don't have a chance Brothers we don't have a chance you don't have a chance and I don't have a chance because because I was talking to my my Congolese brother in France I said hey that's so wonderful we're making all night prayer meeting together you know what they told me was these white people after 20 minutes they're all sleeping anyhow and it's true try to make an all-night prayer meeting with the show you will see so I said Lord if you want to bring me home it must be on another level than this might be different than this okay okay here we go make the next one please so here we see amen and and I want you to now to be spiritual amen because who knows what the picture is definitely so okay definitely so here this is South Africa this is what we call the the tractors four trackers definitely so man these these people had a vision to inherit their land I mean they went with their dragons over mountains fighting whatever you want to speak about determination that is determination brother amen that is if you would tell to them we have now Church the whole day yes let's go for it more suffering was more blessing to them if I would say look I have for my heart if we're not eating this midday we're preaching till six in the evening and then I'm waiting can you say amen and halfway would say praise the Lord we're waiting for this they all thinking about oh I hope you get horse [Laughter] even more pressure to the people it works for some but not for Marcus not for me it must be love it must it must come automatically so please understand one thing don't be carnal I'm not a German I live in a German tent you're not a South African forget it Esther had two names she was Esther and she was Hadassah that was the true name you have a true ident you are not a KIVI forget about that All Blacks yes if you're a fan of All Blacks I would say nothing against it but that don't fight for New Zealand please not fight for your kingdom have you ever seen that Jesus said okay let's make a demonstration those Romans we have to kick them out of Jerusalem and come all and what an injustice Jesus said my my kingdom is from above I'm just a little Pilgrim here on Earth but I'm not a KIVI I'm not a German that's what I always tell this I said I I I'm a very sympathetic type of person you say okay now full body control I said my only problem is I live in a German tent for 70 years but I live if I leave that tense I will be my true in my true identification don't look too much on that German tent that's not me I live in it but I'm another person you are not a don't fight for New Zealand don't fight for South Africa don't fight for Maori don't fight for German fight for your true Kingdom amen can you say Amen so determination is great but it will not help us for the rapture can you say Amen okay let me see somebody the brother who you're looking strong okay you come with me okay okay no no I find so we are now both going into the Rapture okay we are going up okay so let's try to go up okay you you help yourself like me okay okay come on no no I I can't do this the same but you have to put your feet on okay okay you get it you make it no so we're in the same league okay you understand God has to pick us up it must be God if not determination is fine but it will not help you for the rapture determination is part of our religious part but it's not the main thing Holiness is part of the message but it's not the main thing of the message it's part of Christianity but it's not more holy more rapture because every Muslim can be holy no that's not what it is I mean God takes back his nature next one amen so here we go I mean here's what brother Graham says he sees it in closing our comments on this verse thou has to name that thou livest and are dead Lutheran H I cannot impress upon you too strong that this stage through it was brought the Reformation was most sternly rebuked by God instead of being praised because it sought the seed of denominations that organized direct right back to the halot after God had opened the door okay I would continue a little bit thus instead of this being a great spiritual move with all the earmarks of Holy Spirit influence as when God you use purely spiritual means to accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was indeed a work wherein the wrath of man was the wrath of men praise God and the results parallel the history of Israel when they when they left Egypt and so forth so these people were holy but full of Wrath brother sometimes you have a you have a you have a city with two message churches and they cannot shake their hands brother I tell you something is wrong something is is deeply wrong and in death soul and in this heart brother the other problem you are too much a Lutheran you better convert yourself and become like your father but they don't believe like we believe but there is certain Fellowship that you can show your respect and show your friendship and show look we believe we have the same father can you say Amen blessed I don't speak about strange doctrines that's about something else but sudden believing the same thing pure canality purely amen next one please amen here we go here's brother Branham and he takes the Hebrew series he says therefore and he reads Hebrews chapter 3 leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ the atoned one which pushed towards thee now I can read it's blowed out and not laying again the form here we are says brother Abraham in the Hebrew serious not laying again the form of reformation from Works causing death now this lexicon is absolutely not in any interpretation at all it's just a Greek word for what the English says it says now we don't want listen here not laying down foundations of reformation from Works causing death now if you will get that in your mind that he's speaking here forms of reformation causes death Paul said leaving the principles go to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from that works to Faith towards God's doctrines of baptism laying offense resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment reforming Reformation from from forms Reformation forms causing death that's the right words that's actually what Paul wrote see what he's trying to do they were children of their time but brother Brian shows in the Hebrew Syria if you want to enter into Perfection you have to forget these principles completely understand what went wrong in seven Church ages and buried that thing and says hey we have children of our father we one day will inherit the Kingdom can you say Amen make the next one please here we go amen so we have seen the Reformation at his time and we see the Pentecostal age and I want you to put on your spiritual jacket justification sanctification look at a man like John Wesley extremely determined fully disciplined amen but he didn't know what Grace was he came his mother was Susana Wesley Brothers speaks about him her I mean Susanna Wesley was extremely disciplined with 12 children she had time half a week for a half a half an hour every week everything in the life of John Wesley was a to-do list three hours prayer in the evening he had to fulfill his to-do list there were two things that changed the course of of John Wesley the first one was this John Wesley was was was was asked to pray for somebody who will be hanging to the next day and delinquent okay John Wesley five Services per day five times per day he was preaching forget our Wednesday and Sunday forget it amen come come please to church and please make your family alter and please have every day time with the with your father eating the book amen but don't think that God is just saying wonderful you are there you were there you were okay you make the Rapture because you get the bonus program no five times John Wesley John Wesley is invited now for a delinquent who will be hanged the next day look and here he comes his whole day his whole life is professionally serving God every half hour something else that was John Wesley so he comes to that delinquent and he thinks and according to his own memories he says look I will give him the gospel he will refuse I would say okay I did my best Shalom God bless you heavenly father I'm so sorry for that man so sorry sorry okay what is the next program but the problem was when John Wesley gave Testament that man gave his heart to the Lord amen so he said himself that he was troubled what about this because he will be hanged the next day and gave his heart to the Lord so he could not say you are not saved because you never come to church because he knew one thing he's safe because of the blood of Jesus Christ so John Wesley thinks I mean if this man is safe he never paid his tithings he never came to church and I'm coming five times a day you understand he got a big problem in his son all his legalism had to crumble down God allows those things that we sometimes we are superior to those who don't come you don't do that I'm not saved by anything even not by brother Brandon but I'm safe because I have a father who paid the price for me can you say Amen so John Wesley continued in his own memory continued to serve the Lord the way how he did but he said himself I've knew now that I couldn't do anything to marriage salvation but I do it in order to thank God for what he did for my life that takes all religious Spirits away forget it every religious spirit is a spirit of of arrogance somehow we are better because of yeah amen all right you know the story of of of of of Martin Luther can you say Amen so far Martin Luther he hated gods because of Romans I think 1 21 where he says which speaks about the justice of God Martin Luther said I was praying more I was fasting more and I was hating that God because I found out whatever I do is not sufficient to enter into the kingdom of God have you ever seen this the more you want to be holy the more you see something in you which is not fitting into that picture for many many years we were young people in the message we we thought we were not born again because we have that kind of imagination we have this and we have this and we have that and and and and we were not really instructed to understand your new birth is deep in your hearts and then God takes a lot of time to now mold us into that image that he wants to have the new birth and the adoption is completely different amen but we were we were every prayer line we were there who wants to have the Holy Ghost we were there amen and it just hindered us I mean because there is a time when you have to have faith in what God did already for you amen look look so he was a German Professor for German language and he knew one thing and this seems to be technically but it's not technically it's very easy if you know German because the what we call the genitive has two possibilities I mean from the Latin okay to subject or object that means for if somebody say the fear of the Germans was great the fear or the German sphere was great was big can mean two things it means the Germans were fearing amen or we were fearing the Germans same genitive but completely different and and he was thinking about that he said the justice of God can mean I must be just to please God or God is my Justice [Music] and when he found out this he said now the gates of paradise opened for me my Justice is the Lord's and in the that is the second thing that that that that that that John Wesley found out because he went to the church to eldest Gates and in that little church they were reading the preface of Martin Luther and Martin Luther for the book for the letter of the Romans and Martin Luther said look it's not our Justice to achieve something with God but it's God's justice that Sanctified us there and when they were reading this John Wesley said this I was strangely warmed in my hearts and he called this his second conversion can you say Amen amen so you see how God is showing it's him not us so here comes now the Pentecostal move that's what I said Reformation never produced The Bride legalism never worked amen the beginning of the Pentecostal movement was not Azusa Street everything is apart but in reality it started with the Welch Revival the Welsh Revival was not initiated by Evan Roberts he was the first prominent to enter is with but he was initiated by a young girl amen you put on your spiritual jacket because the Sunday school teacher asked her asked the class question what does Jesus mean to you and the first boy says Jesus he's the savior of the world he died at Calvary he he paid for my sins and then and the teacher said I don't want to hear some slogans I want to know what Jesus means to you and the girl stands up he said I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart and the spirit fell upon that whole group that was the beginning of what we call the Welsh Revival brother you ask a young person what does brother Brian mean for you I see he's the seventh angel I have here some uh we believe in all these things brother that's just slogans that's just slogans you must bring them to a reality who said that man brought me really to Christ that man opened the way so that man was elegator to find my heavenly bridegroom can you say Amen but that was the beginning the Welsh Revival of a concept and you put on your spiritual jacket because we were at the beginning more Pentecostal of a concept if the Holy Spirit Falls he falls upon a whole group and you feel it and you you you you you you you jump you shout you have a sensation you have an emotion you have all kind of things because that was the Outburst of the Holy Spirit on Azusa Street and in the Welsh Revival that was their time and it can happen all the time what we do today is to try some Bay limits we try by music to bring that same emotion but if the holy ghost fails you don't need music that must be sure amen you can use music not a problem amen but here comes that thing here's what brother Ben shows us that that all these things are fine all the emotions all the the blessings the baptisms of the Holy Ghost you know our spirit all these things absolutely amen but he shows us a human being is like a tabernacle and we are showing on Friday the first one who had a tenth Vision was Moses he was taking up in the presence of God and he saw the Tabernacle of God and build it on Earth and brother Brian said that's a human being in that Tabernacle is the Shekinah Glory is the Eternal Light now you put on your spiritual jacket brother Brian said in the message the unveiling of God he says you remember in the Bible it is said that that he had to cover his face because he was the glory of the Lord was so much shining upon Moses that correct and brother Abrahim said it was not so much that he was his skin was shining that's what we all thought he was in the presence of God and his skin was still shining from the presence of God but brother bear said this it was the word in him Shining that is our difference to the Pentecostal world therefore you are not searching just an emotion a good feeling a blessing you search that word that it will shine in your heart you search a substance not we had great meetings and nothing changed you search something that quickens that Eternal part that is in you and it can come with loudness and it can come in silence loudness is not volume it's not a indicator for blessing Jesus could just sit there and says blessed are the poor and brother Birmingham said the greatest anointing was upon him that is our difference to all Pentecostal thing thinking we love the emotional part a lot but I know one thing emotions come and emotions will go when I go to the church I and I'm reading I said Lord put something into my soul that this one was shining and brother Braham said Moses had a message and when he delivered that message amen he was Moses completely again blessed be the name of the Lord can you say Amen what what a different make the next one please so we see amen that brother blame said this amen he said we remember and he refers Exodus and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same months and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening that lamb in the message the totem was kept from the 10th till the 14th day exactly four days or on the fourth day three days complete on the fourth day in the evening it was killed okay the token now remember and it doesn't matter what you are how good you are how many times you jumped up and down please young people keep that in your mind when you come from a youth camp it was so tremendous okay what was tremendous okay you can jump up it won't mean one thing to you if that token isn't applied this is the evening time that worked on that worked all right in the days of Luther that worked all right in the days of Wesley but it don't work now no yeah keeping up the lamp was right then what does it say for democracy you make a jump I don't make a jump as Jonah was three days in the Valley of the whale through the justification sanctification baptistification three days that land was just kept it was there but it was kept but it was not the time yet to apply the token is what not their time in reality what the reformer said what Wesley had what Azusa Street had was not the real thing what we have today it is pointing to our time they had the shadow we have the substance seven Church ages is the negative we are that positive because this is rapturing time this is the time when the shadow becomes the original therefore the church and the Luther the church and the West the church even in Pentecost had not rapturing Grace and not rapturing faith it was just keeping for a time that would come God watched it he said and and they were just jumping and shouting the Lord come soon the Lord comes soon the Lord comes to it and God says yes he comes soon but first something has to come in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God must be revealed God shows who he is so that your bride can understand that's the way foreign God allowed all things and he says they don't know better it was the time of ignorance said brother Branham make okay next one please so here we see as it was for three days this their generation we're not giving a sign only the sign of Jonah because the son of man will be in the grave on the earth in the belly of the Earth for three days and three nights amen so Jonah was in that belly according to the Bible for three days and three nights that Veil had a mystery in him that Veil had redemption in him that whale had a had a great treasure in him a man I don't know if the whale was aware of it I don't know if you are aware who lives in you are you just a church member are you just a message believer or you say no no I have a mission in my heart brother blame said brother Brian said this message you are the lights of the world therefore I said on Friday we are the coming of the Lord and still we are meeting him in the air keep a balance in all things not a problem we are more than just some some amen so what happens how did God start to bring to a world the things that is so precious to us you can say this just brother Brian yep if I would tell you I would tell of one of the youngsters brother I gave you ten thousand dollar if you go tomorrow to a Lutheran Church that says no way no way do you understand despite of all of our human problems we are like Peter we don't go back to a church or denominational place because we know one thing this place have words of eternal life do you understand you are on a way where you cannot go you you reach the point of no return no way even no matter in what social situation you are right now but you know one thing my father calls me you understand even the young people they you can give them a million no no I know this is the truth so here comes the message for ninevee and how did that message start God comes on their way and the first thing that these people see that that of this messenger of this let me call him an angel is a man standing in the water and his name is Noah Jonah and the first thing how this message started that we believe started with the man standing in Ohio River you see how the picture is fulfilled and out of that Ohio River comes a man with a mission not only a Baptist preacher a pastor he said as John the Baptist was forwarding the first coming of Christ your message will foreign the second coming of again Jonah comes out of the water and he has a message to bring it's right in his heart right in his mouth you say brother Marcus uh what what what what if we preach thousands 100 messages we we we we preach them we read them we translate them we copy them we write them down but where were all these messages before all in the mouths of William Branham they were all in him everything that we preached was sealed in one man and he preached it amen and that takes us home so for three days and three nights justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost it's still in the Valley of the Earth but the prophet now comes out of nothing no denomination no church out of nothing God has the man of the hour and where does he come out of the river like Jonah that should be the name of the Lord do you speak about brother Brandon we speak about our father we speak about scripture fulfilled as Jonah was three days in the valleys and now look you put on your spiritual jacket okay I told you yesterday that that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem there was no room in the Inns and in the hotels so you had to go in some kind like a cave when he messaged when he when the seals were open the churches were closed brother Brian said I'm for three years right here now in in Tucson and nobody invited me there was only one who invited him brother outlaw I said praise God for some Outlaws because these churches were thinking politically God help us that we're not coming into this message in that same trance a brother is a brother no matter if I disagree with his life still if he was a brother he is a brother if he was a friend he is a friend I can say brother I'm not agreeing with you but one thing is sure here is something between us okay we are not just brothers because we come to the same local church brother that is pure denominational thinking do you want to see us at the sign of a sect in a sect is oh let me say here's one of the brothers and said oh my brother before the foundation of the world we were already family and there's something in us and and we are so friends and we are this and and pray I want to all these I want to have Thousand Years with you when I'm on the other side and blah blah blah and here that brother comes into problem he leaves the church say Amen oh yeah I mean he left us because he was never one of us in between our five minute brother you leave the church and people will forget you but I believe God does not forget you people forget you brother and and you have to see and that is a sect and God help us never to become a sect because the same brother same sister comes to her own mind comes back to church and here the brother said oh an eagle we were always with God together whatever and you think by yourself hey brother I would have need your help in that time that time because if I'm an eagle of God I will always be an eagle of God nobody can preach you in and nobody can preach you out they say Amen sometimes it's not that we are wrong people but sometimes we are we don't have that maturity that we should have in our churches to deal with difficult situations amen so what happened is this brother Brahm there was no church which was open but God opens the full the business the Full Gospel businessman the Full Gospel businessman were not around the ministry of William brand but around the ministry of our robots that was their main speaker but brother Branham always was invited to be a Healer the Full Gospel businessman never met in a church they always met in hotels amen so when brother Brennan was invited he said I'm in chapter zones I'm in chapter zones one of our precious sermons that we believe were not preached in a church but in Clifton's Cafeteria holiday in Phoenix amen Ramadan Tucson look all the messages after 63 there's hardly any church in it everything is Hotel uh Ballroom so-and-so Clifton's Cafeteria who invited them the Christian businessman quote brother Branham you look it over and you look it over he said when Jonah came out of that Veil all the businessmen were at the seashore quote brother Branham quote brother Branham he said because the fishermen at that time were the businessmen the church had no place but the businessman fulfilling the scripture of Jonah can you say Amen God so much in control God doesn't make mistakes then and then you see how there is a development I'm not 1933 I'm see the life of Joseph we're not entering Joseph born 17 years later the pillar of fire Joseph 17 he was led he was he was brought to Egypt at the age of 17. 13 years later Joseph was 30. um he came for in front of the king everything portrayed God showed us these things he said look in thy Bible I am the Gods the Almighty Joseph was 30 13 years after he went to Egypt he was brought before the king as I said on Friday can you say Amen give me just some minutes as I said on Friday maybe we don't see everything maybe you don't see please remember we as Minister we're living in those things I don't expect that everybody now said praise the lord we live in those things that's our daily bread two three day hours per day just the message of the hour therefore we see all these pictures don't be frustrated if you don't see it that's fine but believe your brother okay but maybe you don't see everything in the message but there's one thing that I can guarantee you you can say I have seen the star can you see amen and the star brother Graham said these three stars it was God shows in the heaven what he does on Earth three men in line three stars in line that star never LED them to Jerusalem that star LED them to the king in Bethlehem which is Christ we have seen the seven star that was William Branham and William Branham never led us to Jeffersonville he led us to the king to the word itself to the bridegroom to our father I mean therefore we have that after these years Joseph comes in front of his father of of the new king can you say Amen next one please amen going through hear the proof amen amen finishing two three two three examples amen Jonah three days and three nights old man old woman don't be discouraged if you are a representation up there the attribute of God if you are represented here you cannot you are Eternal and if you cross from the seventh into the eighth you got it Eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you are included into this now if you are just trusting upon a sensation or jumping up or down I'll do this I keep the seventh day I don't eat meat we could continue I try to drink alcohol I go to church I have long hair I have all these fine that's okay things going to perish so it is in the Eternal this is the Eternal the feast after the Feast of Tabernacle see the Feast of Tabernacles was the last three the seventh Feast we are now worshiping we are speaking now under the Feast of Tabernacles the seven Church age now look at this to understand God does these things to separate us from Reformation completely all of our good doings brother I know more I see more I'm deeper I tell you forget it forget it because we talk now about a theophany not about our knowledge what we can see but you see the picture amen how great amen amen here is Israel and we have what we call the Yom Kippur and between the New Year and Yom Kippur you have 10 days to bring your life in order and that is the great day of atonement after Yom Kippur we have the Feast of Tabernacles it's a Feast of Joy okay and I make it simple that you and that you understand what God did in our time when that cloud came so here comes the Holy Spirit of the priest he enters into the holiest of holies with the blood all these things okay with the belts huh brother blame said as long as Israel was listening to that sound they knew that the holy that the high priest was still living and he says if your religion doesn't produce sound you have to bury it because it's dead anyhow that's what he says okay amen so that means the high priest for some moments he's out of the sight of Israel they don't see him anymore do you have only have to wait and they know one thing if he doesn't come back we have a big problem because God didn't forgive our sin the wrath of God comes upon us so you can form Heavenly Father and what happened when he came out everybody was rejoicing our sacrifice is accepted we are forgiven look what God did in our time the last people who saw Jesus of Nazareth the way he looked like were the disciples who were on the amount of Ascension on the Mount of Olives um and then for 2 000 years he just goes Amen to make an intercession we're not speaking about that subject because then then I'm in trouble I mean I'm making an intercession we don't know him we believe the Bible everybody believed the Bible it's God's words Luther believed the Bible Wesley believe the Bible we have no other report we have Pentecostalism baptism of the Holy Ghost okay nobody knows exactly where he is but we believe the Bible and the big person he himself is not be seen but then came the time where brother Ben said I saw him when he when he went when when he appeared to me at the place where I would build a tabernacle and he looked like Hoffman's head of Christ that's the way how Jesus looked like like Hoffman's head of Christ and then God's on Sunset Mountain comes Amen in seven angels amen with a picture amen and you turn the picture to the right and you see his face in other words the high priest shows that that the sacrifice is accepted so I know one thing I'm free I'm free brother brother sometimes I I have to deal I have to counsel the situation all kinds from sexual problems to perversions to to to to to to to to bitterness to Crime to hatred whatever and I speak to people who are advanced in the message I said before we are saying anything we just make a statement that you are redeemed yes I'm redeemed amen okay now let's deal with these little problems that will leave you so fast there is three things that I'm not fighting for I'm not working for it because that is God alone the first thing that I'm not fighting for is to have a sacrifice because I believe that was already I I believe when Jesus said it is finished that is finished I believe the Bible second one I'm not fighting together theophany because it's there God will not think five minutes before I'm going home oh it does Marcus back and get a theophany how often was he in church and did he read the Bible and My Philosophy was there before I was here on Earth third thing I will not take care of the Rapture because that's God's choice anyhow there's nothing for us prepare yourself the Lord comes to unprepared I'm because I believe the Bible the price is paid the ferry has paid the way it's paid the thing that God does he's just now molding me to fit into that image can you say Amen and all the rest of my problems my mind my psyche my problems my births my genes now let's take care of these little problems that we still have but the major three things God solved them all for me can you say Amen so the high priest can be seen and we can't say one thing Calvary has its effect yes amen therefore this message didn't take away Calvary this message brought Calvary right at the same thing we think if we sing the song There's an Old Rugged Cross we sing it different than all denominations can you say Amen make the next one please I'm amen here we go amen as again I'm in all kind of of of of things keep one thing in mind you and me we are children of our time please understand one thing when we came into the message we were not blank we had already our denominational thinking when we came into the message and God takes a lot of years to take that thing out of us amen as first the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth he was the first fruit of those that slept in the bright coming of Christ here you have the bright coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waved against the last day oh my waving off the Sheaf what was the chief the first one that come to mature the first one approved it was a a wheat that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominational message denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders what he did back there this message is not there to polish up denominational denominationalism this message is to bury it and raise up according to the words brother Brian speaks about a new birth according Malachi 4. this message is not continuation the nonsense that we had for 2000 years this is changing of dispensation and so that we change God showed himself that's me that's my character that's how I feel I mean you know I'm a father and brother Brian said in in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed God is a father now you come home from your work okay so now here's your children okay I hope that you don't want to have this okay so you come home and here's your children father comes home father comes home he brings the money we can go to McDonald's thank you Father brother we are not called to have a muslimic worship oh Lord how great you are God knows that he is great we don't have to tell him he says there is none beside me he knows it God is not a narcissist but God wants to have children who says what do you believe in me heavenly father I love you so much I hope we can say this when we are just alone like brother Graham said he was running around that tree I hope I hope we have time when we say heavenly father I cannot express it but I love you so much it's such an honor to be your child mold me correct me take me but I know you mean well with me God doesn't want you all how great do all the angels can repeat this but when you pray that your heart speak such an honor to be part of your family God wants your hearts your soul Hallelujah you can't say if somebody comes like a Pharisee Lord I'm so thankful I see deep things and my poor Chicken around me feel so sorry that they are not Eagles you see how stinking is this in the eyes of God how stinking God wants Hearts One Soul he's amen so therefore this message is a Resurrection on the eighth day not age Church age there is no age Church age but this is bright age spiritual AIDS day and look brother blames Tabernacle God knows what he does Penn Street Penn was the the author of Pennsylvania was a reformer pen and Avery God says this I make a corner I'm not continuing with denomination and listen brother Graham said the church always wants to continue but brother babe said we are making a corner right now take the corner with us and it's the corner of love it's a corner of finding yourself of really your brother who has fallen really hug you say hey man I disagree with you I want to say I want to say I love you man really you are my friend you're my brother and I pray honestly not this uh I don't know if you can have Fellowship you have to understand we have the Holy group and um they say Amen I remember I remember I would never forget this and I pointed that I come to me to the end please please don't I'm not too long but I'm long enough okay I know I remember I I came to the kindergarten when my when my little girl was in kindergarten and she was just sitting there and normally the children are a little bit embarrassed when the father came Papa bring me to the kindergarten but but 100 Peter before you can just okay the older they get the farther distance become if if there are 50 in the kind that the school is in this direction I said please bring me in this direction they prefer to work not just to embarrass them you know but I remember that thing I came and my little girl was just sitting with your other children and when she sees me she just stands up hello Daddy and I thought by myself I will never be ashamed of her never ever happened if she becomes a Muslim if she becomes a lesbian whatever she becomes amen she will always be my daughter I will not be ashamed of her I'm not agreeing with her lifestyle although she is a Christian really serving a lot but I told you honey we are always friends in life no if you choose to become a Muslim that's up to you okay if she comes next time okay but I said I don't agree but we are always friends that's the way how God thinks about his children brother God is not ashamed we make a lot of features amen make the next one hurrying through amen here we go next one please amen now I'm a Finnish bodies time this is a special time this is rapturing time this is theophany time this is not only Holiness movements but it brings Heaven and Earth together now Paul says here notice his enroll in Hebrews notice his title king of righteousness and king of peace that's what Paul says in the book of Hebrews only two kings but this message is more than just what Paul taught it took Paul was a tremendous man building a foundation as a wise master builder but this message brought a Capstone upon the whole building amen amen so it takes us higher he says king of righteous and also king of Peace here's two kings there now since he has come into flesh and received his body up in Revelation 21 16 he's called King of Kings all three together see King God King theophany King Jesus he is king of all Kings Paul uses a subject here that brother Brahm that Paul never used now to show the time that we're in make it fast you see the balance and you see the greatness in it you remember that brother Branham says when he was in JCPenney he saw the same picture that he saw in Hell he saw now right on that escalator quote brother Graham Souls that are in prison hell is on Earth did he say this quote brother Brandon hell is on earth now did Brother Brian say The Fifth Dimension is empty never said this that's our own interpretation about this hell is em hell is on Earth he never said The Fifth Dimension is now empty because they're all on Earth the devil said this amen so if we say I mean Heaven is on Earth we never say the seventh Dimension is empty because the Bible says if the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord will raise up a standard against this so when brother what does Brothers say the effects of the five Dimensions Fifth Dimension is so strong that we can see it in our dimension so if Satan enters into our Dimension with his power what about God he comes with his power Angelic power theophany power right into our dimension and nobody preaches that seventh Dimension is empty but if if Satan comes imaginism we would hope I see this after is nothing ugly but if Satan comes with demonic power God doesn't tell the church only okay have long dresses and long hair that will not change that will not defeat the challenge of this day when Satan is on Earth God must be on earth the same way can you say Amen so it's it's nice to be outwardly nice but that's not the question what we're talking about we talk about something deep inside some mystical part amen next one please I'm in we're going through amen amen skip it because it's been too long it's about the question that brother brand was asked please explain the transition of the Bride I mean it's so tremendous okay next one amen amen he will come to the end soon is there another one or is it the last another one this is the last one no he look at this that's what I told you yesterday what are you searching you young people you're older one you want to have a religion you want to feel a little bit better by having some brighter Brandon pictures at the wall that's that's not our Revival our Revival is we have a father we are the only religion in this earth who have a father who has a father amen this man is not grandfather this man is her father of that young girl but he has cancer he would soon die and he fills in his heart and they were arranging it that he will not have enough time to bring that little girl his own daughter to the altar one day but he knows in his heart that father is a special person in Every Girl's Life and mother is a special person in every person's life nobody can replace you amen as I said yesterday our children are our brothers and sisters they are not our animals they are not our pets they are our brothers and sisters definitely so so he feels he's an unbeliever no doesn't believe amen but he feels on his heart that I want don't want to go and my girl was not brought to the altar by her own father so what they were doing is this they were playing marriage and he brings her to the Altar and at that moment the ceremony stops and when in many many years later that girl will marry they will continue exactly at that part where father left him only that she can say my father brought me to the altar brother I thought by myself if a man without the Holy Ghost can have that feeling for his children What About Us we must be the best parents out there in the world because we understand our father but do you understand how legalism and how religion makes us miserable and makes the people around us even more miserable do we understand that we have all the religious problems because we don't understand our father and we will not continue with denominationalism in this message because this has to be buried and raised up right from you too and they have a clear picture that is my father he paid a price and he made a way for me can you say Amen just go just go back for the last two one because I feel it would be that good next one okay just finish by this just reading without comments amen that's difficult for free why do you laugh repent the altar is open for you my daughter said always said oh hey daddy you are so embarrassing man he said I'm I'm hip I'm cool what do you want to say now you're so embarrassing hahaha please brother Brandon explain the mystery of the translation of the brides oh that's a good question please explain just to change our bodies let's say you know what I mean when I say that I don't want to be sick or religious I don't say I don't mean to say to this church I mean say every Abraham he was looking for a promise Sunday was promised to him it was right and the church is looking for a prophet's son the bride is that right the bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be changed is that right she was too old to have a baby had no milk grains in her breasts and so forth and we cannot receive the promised son that's promised to us in these bodies therefore stop renovating that we live in these bodies are sin next one so potentially it's in here what is it the words promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word your own theophany see and the same thing is for the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around the world and the same thing did by Sarah when the old body that she had was the first body had to be changed in order to produce a sun you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it will have to be changed in the same way how do we get that word amen God placed it before the foundation of the world God placed the Rapture already in his children as I said yesterday amen the resurrection is an event and is a person Jesus said I am the resurrection the Rapture is an event and is a person the bride can say I am the rapture do you see and I'm happy that I don't know about this thing but I'm traveling a lot if this is true that the true Rapture is the words in us and brother Brahma said the body will materialize throughout that word so don't pay too much attention about that body I say in a positive way don't fuss about vaccination or no vaccination because your Eternal destination is not determined by any vaccination my my my theophany is not vaccinated anyhow I see Church split about things like this and I asked myself did you understand what brother Brian says your body will be changed anyhow can you say Amen a person comes he said brother Marcus I feel to be vaccinated I said praise the Lord that's wonderful do it next one comes brother Marcus I feel that I don't want to be vaccinated I said praise the Lord do it that's exactly right because faith is personal we are not a sect we are not a sec if you feel do it I did it directly and I felt it I had complete conviction do it but if somebody said I will not do it fully respected I will not convert you to anything but don't spiritualize these things the Rapture is not a question of my body the Rapture is a question of the word that is sowed into my heart can you say Amen so therefore I I I I I you can eat what you want but let me go to McDonald's okay please don't don't don't despite me I maybe I'm not as okay somebody says brother Marcus and and I I we're eating healthy we're living healthy but when our time is up on Earth we die healthy amen I'm not dying because of Coca-Cola I die because my father calls me my life is in the brother he gave us an advice everything is fine never mind or on a major and major on a minor brother you go to American churches you cannot even preach something you can't even mention Trump you cannot even imitate him that's a tremendous tremendous [Applause] person gets upset and I think by myself hey who is your president Trump or Jesus print out Republicans we are not this we are not Miss Arnold against Arden leave everything Our God a place that our kingdom is another kingdom [Applause] respect authorities he said amen oh what a time when the musicians would come maybe you say brother Marcus you I don't agree with that interpretation but for me it was too clear because Jesus was not in the Earth for three days and three nights but the Bible is right but the word the son of man Christ was for three days and three nights in the belly of the Reformation sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost three nine and on the fourth day a prophet comes out of the water amen and brings us Hallelujah can you say Amen maybe we have the song I Love You Lord do you see do you see how this message take us away from the concept of the men of the hour the bride found her men of the hour amen somebody somebody that's so wonderful Minister I'm streaming you all the time I said foot feels sorry for you you didn't understand what I said I don't say become fan of Marcus I said find your own identification with Christ I'm streaming nobody I have the message of the hour he said Lord you have a message and speak to my heart you can use anything not wrong all these things are not wrong but many many things that we do are not helpful I've seen young people they become fans of this and fans of that and they never growed spiritually they always were just seat us in the church it's not helpful for you you must take that book yourself I said heavenly father dead angel must come to me personally amen change be moved me you know that brother blame said only the lamb can can open the book is that correct amen that means you must become a lamb in the book for yourself we must become a lamb amen I love that that that that thought so much because [Music] Jonah is a special type in the Bible God always in the Old Testament he was that judgmental God but in the in the Book of Jonah he showed who he really was he said hey Jonah don't you think that I feel for these unbelievers in Sodom in in in individual do you think so Jonah his name means dove that's the signification no wonder their brother blame said on the wings of a snow white dove comes this message it takes some meekness somebody said [Music] we're Eagles an eagle strong it's aggressive that you know I agree I agree I'm an eagle too but Brothers it takes all aggression out of us we don't have to be aggressive anymore we don't have to compare to one another because I know hey I have a theophany I'm in myself and nobody will get it preserved for me you have a place nobody can take your place brings us into a piece it's a way and he was in the valley of the whale for three days and three nights and sure God was somehow speaking to him and when the time was over the wind came a person might leave the church a person might leave God but one thing is sure you might leave but God put something in you that you want to have to come back he's not forgetting you not forgetting you no no you're his son if you were his son you always his son definitely and so when these waves went up and down Jonah knew one thing God called me back and here is a fish he especially prepared a man following the shipment Noah was Jonah was and while that that that kind of storm comes up they take all the furniture and throw it over into the water amen but that that fish was a special fish because the fish was just thinking look I'm not interested in furnaces soon a man will fall down and my commission is to pick up that man do you understand that we all have a commission to help our brother we are that way that way sometimes they're taking up a person said hey there's still hope for you okay amen they're still cross they're still Calvary for you okay you pay for your mistake you pay for them know what but it does not take you away from the plan of God let us be that way I'm having a feeling for somebody who cannot help himself amen [Music] I love you Lord [Music] ship oh my God [Music] like [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I [Music] am remember [Music] am I allowed to sing this episode [Music] I love you [Music] it's sweet [Music] I'll be if that's fine for you let us sing again the song As the deer pants for the water I feel just to have a little time and give it over to brother do brother Airway As the deer you see my range of songs is limited so you say the man cannot preach and you cannot sing what can he do praise the Lord amen I'm just being a blessing to one another God bless you richly As the deer repent for the water the great Shalom from my side this sorry if I'm always leaving after church but when the service is over much more cooler okay but I'm always in you can you know how that means how it is okay God bless you all together [Music] alone are my hearts desire and I love to worship you [Applause] know to you despair Hallelujah sing it to your father now you are alone are my heart is [Music] thank you Father oh you're my friend and you are my brother even though you are wide [Music] I want you more than anything for you for you experience [Music] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah or silver only you can satisfied you are alone Joy Giver at the end of my eyes [Music] everything thank you [Music] hearts desire and I long two words [Music] hallelujah amen amen I trust that we can receive the word we had this morning I mean you know I was discussing with brother Marcus one of the most difficult things as a minister is people listen to things through their own filters the filters are very obvious so I just don't agree with that so we block it out and we ignore it other times we actually think we hear what's being said but we actually interpret it through our pretty defined filters you know and the things that rather refer to you know we can interpret things through denominational filters and our cultural filters and our perspectives and so forth and we actually hear what we want to hear because that's how we think and that's what we believe and my prayer is that God will shake us out of that so that we can actually hear what the spirit says to the church so if we can hear what God intends with his word and then if there's one thing I'm praying for this weekend is that we will hear what God sees I'm here with your mind says God says amen but here What God Says in our soul praise the Lord I thoroughly enjoyed this morning I mean having a wonderful time amen [Music] amen that's for the Lord praise the Lord so two more services to go we we uh we're being fed very very well and just really excited and thankful to be here this weekend and thankful for each one of you that are here I I also want to just take the opportunity we didn't really do it last night and a handful of us prayed over the Over Midnight and so forth I don't want to say my god really bless you this year my God give you a wonderful 2023. and and we're not saying wonderful from a Prosperity Gospel perspective if you're saying it for me from an eternal perspective my God draw each one of us closer to him may may our walk get real I made more than just our little pet Doctrine or our little issue or our little attitude or whatever maybe you have a real relationship with our heavenly father I mean may I walk be be the most important thing of our lives but not in a religious spirit way but because of a love for our savior I mean because of a love for what he's done for us that's why we can sing I love him because he first loved me I mean May that just become more and more a reality in US yeah I know it's usually not something we do at the end of a service but I'm gonna just ask you to not everyone in the building right that's going to take an hour but just those around you to shake their hands and say God bless you in the year to come I mean we have a father and we're family amen
