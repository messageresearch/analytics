truly have a father and he knows each and everyone here by your name and he knows the inward depth parts of the parts that you didn't know he knows amen so he's a father you can really trust in and really trust in that he will come on the seen this morning and just be a blessing to each and everyone we'll be going into some Dark Places today but we need to go into those places so the Lord can heal those places so uh you just the deal we made a deal yesterday I'm going to be open and then you have to be open so just let the barriers fall you have a father that cares about you and as we go through some things may the Lord just be with us and really undertake cuz you really need him in some of of these things you will not figure it out yourself you will need him to help you get through so may the Lord help us may you be with us amen I'm sorry I'm so underdressed some of you are making me feel really bad but um when I spoke to brother Al was hey this is casual just come on and so uh yeah I didn't bring a suits and a tie so forgive me those that are looking so fine but uh yeah I will uh I will by God's grace amen still be under that anointing amen just the way I'm dressed amen so thank you austa the song items Everything the song leader what a lovely time amen you're just such a a a really talented group amen and just keep giving your talents to God Amen so brother Joe you can bring up the the presentation amen we're going to be call talking this morning on I have a father he calls me his own and that's why I ask that we especially sing that song Amen so we going to turn to opening scripture you can go to the next one brother Joe oh yeah I've got the the one the remote here amen a bit of a strange scripture but there's just so much that is in the scripture Lamentations 5 1-7 amen for us that don't even know we there where that is in the Bible don't worry we got it on the projection amen Lamentations we'll read from chapter 5 1-7 amen and this is just a cry out to the Lord remember oh Lord what is come upon us consider consider and behold our reproach our inheritance is turned to strangers so what was meant to be ours by default we've lost and has been turned away to others our houses to aliens no and this is not aliens in a UFO this is things that don't belong in your life they're not supposed to be be there we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows you can be married and have a husband you can be a a daughter or a son and have a father and still be fatherless and be a widow because if that father is not there for you it doesn't help he can be in the household but if he's not a present father doing what a father should do it's still the same as not even having a father or not having a husband we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold to us so things that should have just been natural things that should have been a natural family structure suddenly we are paying for these things water should just be something that's free for us you know wood should be something easy together but now we have to pay for these things our necks are under persecution we labor and we have no rest we have given the hand now that hand is strength portion of land support for a labor that means when you used to have a wash bucket in the olden days where you'd clean there would be like a support structure so we've lost this support structure we've given it away what to the Egyptian to to things out there to the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread our fathers have sinned that is to miss the goal or path of right and Duty when you go into the original that sinned and are not that is to have not of your possession and we have borne their iniquities so because of the father's action because of what father hasn't been you suffer and this goes from the youngest right through to the oldest that is present in this building because of fathers that haven't come into their Poss of what they meant to be let's Close Our Eyes in a word of prayer dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we realize these things Lord go beyond Lord what a human can handle Lord these things go beyond psychology as much as Lord It's good to talk about things Lord we know ultim that heeding lays with you and Lord God we ask that by your grace and mercy that you just come down in a mighty way and undertake for each and everyone Lord there's doors and hearts that are firmly shut that people are not prepared to go to but Lord I ask by your grace and your mercy that you'll loosen the bars over those doors in people's hearts this morning and allow you to come in and healed by your grace and mercy we ask these Mercies in your precious and wonderful name amen amen amen so you may be seated amen so we have a we have a far crisis in this world um you know the stats are staggering U most I don't know how it is a New Zealand but sou Africa generally the law always favors the mother as opposed to the father I think that's most of the world is similar to that you'll naturally find and and obviously generally the dads are to blame that's why it will happen but unfortunately you can get a situation where you will then because of father not coming to where he should be you can crucify father in the family structure and when you do that you break the sequence of how God wanted things to work so this is the biblical order of the family obviously having Christ as the ultimate head underneath that the husband which is the head of the home and he's there to protect the family lead the family provide for the family and then underneath that the wife who will be the comforter the teacher the nurturer but brandom talks about the mother being the Fifth Gospel amen and then of course the children under that they should be loving the parents and obeying the parents that is how God wanted things Amen to be but of course we see that that has not happened in this generation for many many households and yet again I'll say this just because you have a father in the house even in a message home if he's not doing what fathers are meant to do and in the place they meant to be you break the natural sequence of how things are meant to be so you see Christ I mean obviously Christ we all we all fall under Christ they children we fall under Christ so yes God is faithful he is the ultimate guide the ultimate protector our ultimate father but if you want to hurt the children what do you break next what is next in line well Satan knows that the next in line is the Father the husband and if I can hurt the husband if I can damage the husband and the father I will hurt all the rest under there because now we have a place where things are not as God ordered to be and like I say we have a father a father crisis in this world and I am talking to to to not only show you what it brings but I'm also here to say to the young men who will be fathers one day you need to stand up and realize you are called to a higher calling and that you're going to have to one day take your rightful position as a father and remember these things so as much as you may say oh this doesn't apply to me I'm not a father you one day will be and you need to make sure that you're in the place you're meant to be as a father and be the protector the guide the comforter the provider and all those things as what a a father should be so fathers young young men there's certain things you'll have to remember and those that are even listening online and the parents in the back this applies to us all now it's fascinating the Bible no matter what when it often always when it refers to generational problems it will always refer to your the fathers it just it's incredible you can go do it it almost never refers to the mothers it always is the fathers and it can maybe seem a bit unfair because we know there's also unfortunately women that don't do the best of things but the way the Lord has has created a woman if she's just in a right place place and is subjected to a man that is Led of the Lord you'll naturally see things will work out how they meant to be cuz God has given us a great solution he's given us the way it should be so often you'll see the the Bible hits hard on the fathers and you young men I hope you take note of this and ye fathers provoke not your children to wroth you know we have to be careful even I as a dad I have to be careful because it's S as it's just so nice to tease and and have fun at the kids and sometimes as you can push them a bit too far and you can get you can see they'll lash out and frustration so I have to be very careful as a father to have fun with the kids tease them you know have a lot of you know cool stuff we do together but there comes the point where you have to watch the reaction and every child is something different and many of you sitting here have multiple times been provoked by your father unto wroth and uh don't be too harsh on him heo we had came with all his Hang-Ups and his misunderstandings and his complexes but and maybe he was doing in the best of intentions but he didn't quite understand and what happens is when you provoke people to wroth you start hurting the heart you start damaging core structures of the heart and you start finding children becoming rebellious and the fathers can s be so harsh on you when you start being rebellious meanwhile the problem lays back at base camp which his father so we need to say that his is but at the same time I'm saying to you as youth as much as it's going to hurt and you're going to have to deal with things you can't let that overcome cuz my question to you is this what if your father never comes to the place he's meant to be cuz that can happen you'll have to resort back then to your heavenly father and there's some beautiful things you'll bring out now because God understood this and he came for a purpose to sort out the missing Gap so you would have come through some hard times and and and you know the the oldtimers of the message you know the fathers they really came with a very strong approach very legalistic you know not understanding that we we we grow in and we need time to grow that would just kill us and pretty much you know like we were saying last night you know the end of the day is I as a father must believe that my children are children of God they bride of of God and I need to respect them in that way that they're still little bride members and I must be careful to treat them right because ultimately if I don't I risk hurting them and I can't say things like to them you know if you're going to do that you know you better be careful cuz you're going to go to hell if that happens and and you know try and push fear on them because ultimately that is not the bride's language as we spoke last night because the true bride cannot be the yes there will come a time when I'm going to have to sit down with my child and say listen you have to give your heart to God it's very important so yes is a time of of like I said last night there's very very much a time of evangelism and I want to say this whenever you see your pastor which I believe we want to really trust that the Pastors in this message have moved on far enough to to know uh you know we need to speak Brad language but at times you might see your pastor will be a bit Evangelistic and even son is in the youth and the reason is he maybe knows there's a lost soul out there he has to go after but you need to then process that and not take it on board and say this is this is for me no it's it's just a case of me having to realize this is for someone else and I just have to let this go past and find that lost soul so what is a father meant to do yeah don't provoke your children to Roth but bring them up what in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord now notice nurtured admonition what of the Lord so the Lord is our example he is the one we need to resort to as our our model you know this is where we have to go as fathers and young men when you fathers you have to do this so when you treat your kids you have to be DED in the same ways how does God treat you as a Christian and so you as the father must try as best as possible to mirror that onto your kids because ultimately look how much God is so kind to you how many times is he forgiven you when you were nothing you deserve nothing but fire and condemnation but God comes in he forgives you many times thousands of times through my life God had to be kind enough you need to start showing that same thing but and you have to show the nature of Christ that you can ask forgiveness cuz some parents I've messed up my wife has messed up with our kids and we have to be big enough to go back to our kids and say we sorry we shouldn't have done that and that is the spirit of Christ unfortunately many of you have never heard your parents ever say sorry to you and it left a lot of scars it Le a lot of confusion but when they do say sorry you must also have Grace enough to say Lord I need to help help me to forgive them because they also as I said come with a lot of background stories and as I said the early days of the message it was very muddy and very messy and there was just pulls going in all Direction and they had such limited material by God's grace we have access to so much but just remember you have to be kind and forgiv giving as best you can and yes the Lord's going to have to help you through some things children obey your parents in the Lord for this is well pleasing unto the Lord so yes that's we heard I'm sure you heard that all the times you know you should obey the parents but it's a twofold because fathers also mustn't provoke not your children to anger what lest they be discouraged so it's a twofold that's happening here and obviously you guys as the youth I'm sure you've you've you've felt the second part so much and like I said the the it's a twofold yes respect your parents and that is really your duty irrespective of what they do always show them respect as best you can don't become rebellious try and be understanding but ultimately just remember that you young men in the future must make sure you do your best not to provoke them because then they become discouraged and they can go through some very confusing times so yeah there's some interesting stats out there and this is this is not this is not message this is purely done out there and some of the stuff's even out of date some of it is is more than it it it it it it used to be some of these things as I said from years ago but just to go through some of this I know it's small but uh children who grow up with an involved father are 90 uh 39% more likely to earn mostly A's in school 45% less likely to repeat a grade 60% less likely to be suspended or expelled from school two times as likely to go to college or find stable employment After High School 75% less likely to have a teen birth 80% less likely to spend time in jail and then uh it goes here in the bottom children who grow up with absent fathers are at greater risk of infant mortality literally they actually the the when a child is born in birth those that have no father present there and then that child has succumbed to diseases Etc and it's just so fascinating what would that child know you would think but there's a a knowing more likely to have behavioral problems more likely to to abuse drugs and alcohol more likely to drop out of school more likely to become pregnant as a teenager more likely to commit a crime and go to prison so this is a some big stats here I mean the the that one of the the gel I mean it's we we'll go into that just now but that L one is fascinating when you go and see what actually happens behind there this is African stat so excuse me but we have a problem back there I don't know what is like in New Zealand but about 1/5 21% of all children sa did not live with their parents but never mind that as I said there's more to this so we in sou Africa only have 4% with these divorce cases that actually land up with the father 96% doesn't happen 42% live with parents others live L up with the the parents parents and uh we got a stat here of about 32 so think of it only oneir is technically Healthy Families but as we know like I said many of those one-third families have fathers that are not fathers they there but they're not there they're there but not present dads are important fathers make important contributions to their child's well-being children growing up without fathers face greater risk and account for 90% of homeless and runaway youth they interview with them they find out the backstory 90% of them was because they didn't have a present father or the father wasn't there of House High School Dropout 71% 63% of Youth suicides come because there wasn't a father so what happens let me go back here so let me refer to the sisters here a bit so what happens when you don't have the love and and the the the the necessary respect and attention from your dad what happens within you you're naturally born to to want affirmation from dad to have the support to tell for him to tell you you're beautiful and you're smart and and he loves you so much that is normal that is what has been inbuilt into you from God but what go what has happened now because dads through their unfortunately own complexes and insecurities they come to a place where they don't know how to give that now Satan comes in that door he now knows your hurt you're lacking something and he wants to replace it and this is where it gets so hard it becomes so dangerous because there's multiple ways for you to express it because the reality is you're going to try and find attention elsewhere cuz you want it so if Daddy doesn't give it to you you're going to try and dress in a way to get attention or you're going to go on social media and other places to try and get attention or the other way people deal with great hurts in their hearts is they say well listen this person has hurt me my father has hurt me so the only way for me to feel better about myself is to try and make myself higher and bigger than this hurt because then I have control and that's unfortunately where we get p uh situations where you know female dominating spirits come out and say well we are bigger better than the men and it doesn't mean you're not as I say from an intelligence point of view but that spirit will unfortunately drive you to try and make yourself bigger and better than your dad or men around you and that's where unfortunately we get these spirits of lesbian and homosexuality coming in and wanting to be Butch and tough and they just career driven they just want to get to the very top why they'll Fe eating something that was lacking all along and the only way they can feel better about themselves is to make themselves better than the thing that hurt them I hope I'm making sense so you're going to run two ways you're either going to look for attention from the boys or you're going to try and make yourself better than the thing that hurt you and it's such a dangerous territory because God didn't make you to be like that he didn't want you to be like that so obviously family is on the attack as we know if the way the laws are coming out family is being attacked at the moment the the the the sanctity of the family is just under this wall like we've never seen before so what is it happening remember the olden days family was was normal the divorces were so low the divorce rate now is ridiculously high broken families and uh what do we have now watch as things are changing now because more than ever before we finding that there's a a a sexual activities taking place way before God was meant to let it take place cuz God is meant for you to keep your body until that time you've said I do at the altar that is what God's plan is for you and it's beautiful those things are beautiful in its place under the banner of what God gave you but what we have now is this this drive and do you notice the women are above the trend line than men why it's women trying to find except love from something else and technically the man being a red hot blooded man should have a higher stat because that's sometimes more ticking in his brain yes the the spirits will be more and more mingled and there's more going on but realistically but why is the woman so driven it's because there's something she's trying to get and unfortunately what happens is this we find the amount of sexual partners before marriage is just becoming bigger and bigger so this is only go until the two 2000 what the 2010s we're now 2024 I can tell you now these graphs have have have changed even worse than what we see so to have one partner not even zero Partners it used to be back in 1970s that about what is that about 45% of of women would have only had one partner before married we're not even talking about no Partners we'll go down to the other side just now uh and then you can see how it increases four to five Partners 6 to9 Partners two to above 10 Partners this is 2010s guys 2010s we're talking about roughly what 20% of the population has had over 10 Partners before they've even said I do at the altar well these days they don't even say I do they just live together now it's fascinating this is clinically proven so you don't have to this is not Mage but do you know when you sleep with someone let me shock you a bit and hopefully it'll shock you to really keep yourself in place and for those that have gone that way God has got Grace for you but you're going to have to then walk a walk they've proven you know your DNA it's it's you know obviously we we quite familiar with the DNA principle everyone has their own unique DNA do you know when you when you're with someone they actually that's when the Bible says you become one you don't understand how far that goes because when you actually become one that person you're with they actually jump into your DNA literally and you carry them for the rest of your life literally they will find a trace of that person you're within your DNA never mind just exchange of fluids or whatever you you guys are adults you know what I'm talking about but never mind that just you'll carry that person's DNA for the rest of your life and you'll be struggling with things and having things in your life and you wonder how on Earth did this happen well you've unfortunately allowed so when the Bible says they become one flesh you literally join joining yourself you you you got a connection and all those terrible spirits and stuff that are on that person will get transferred to you and literally your your DNA structure changes this is scientific I don't it's just you can go research it yourself it's it's it's the it's just black and white but you can see as things are changing how things are going and look at virgins before marriage at 2010 we're sitting at only 5% that's the black line uh the middle black line what is that green actually that goes down that's 2010 are we down to maybe half a percent in 2024 and remember this is the world you know some cultures especially some of the African cultures they don't dare be with a partner so I think in the more First World countries that stat is I think ridiculously high but thank God for the message that we can still have virgins come to the Altar and say I do amen but like I said if you've not if you're not in that caty don't lose hope God's got amen a solution for you so look what the bra brother Bram talks about here about remember we've seen him telling you about the sisters that are looking for exceptions now look what he says here or the woman that smokes or that dresses immorally what ises she he says yeah trying to draw her Comfort a comfort she's trying to get a comfort she's trying to satisfy something that dads were meant to be but unfortunately dads haven't done from being so well put together that she wants to cause a man to look at her there's no other reason she and I know this sounds horrible when she says she is partially insane and and obviously that's referring to not necessarily that you you know you but you've been hurt your mind and your heart is Damaged unfortunately and now there's a a way you're not thinking clearly anymore and you're going to the wrong source for satisfaction no sensible woman would know to strip herself before a man that was in her her right mind but of course there's hurt now and she's not see there's no reason for it at all and these women have no other reason but just they don't know it they don't realize it I'm not saying that they do in other words he's not saying they purposely bad people but they don't understand what has happened the damage and why they are looking for these other things because it's normal you are meant to get affirmation and beautiful words set upon you and to build you up that's what were made for many of them fine women and I'm not saying it to be rude I'm saying it to try wake them up and that's what we're trying to say this morning understand who you are accept it don't fight it and if you're not got it you're going to have to allow God to deal with the hurt heart and that daddy wasn't there now this is so beautiful when Christ came on Earth amen he came for a purpose amen and thank God for that but Psalms Are So Beautiful cuz it says here that my God will be a father to the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation amen so that's the solution with this sisters brothers cuz Brothers also you need a father son us to guide you and be able to raise you well and you haven't had that and you're going to have to make God your father in some of these cases cuz like I said sometimes you're not going to get Daddy coming right but God can't let you live in that condition and keep it as a crutch you have to get over it and allow him to replace the channel That was missing the Lord is nigh unto them that are brokenhearted and Savor such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord will deliver him and her out of them all now this is the the scripture that Christ quoted when he was on on Earth cuz Christ came for a purpose and when he was in the temple and he was he was speaking to the he opened the book and started to read the scroll this is what he said the spirit of the Lord has come upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he hath sent me this is part of the big purpose of God coming yes to preach the gospel Good Tidings to the meek but what else he has sent me to bind up that's like a Band-Aid a plaster the Brokenhearted so God Has Come with a purpose and he wants to help us that was part of his coming that's why he died on the cross for you so that you can have a way out what to Proclaim Liberty to the captives remember the opening scripture because father's haven't been there it bound Us in certain things it hurts us in certain things but God by his grace has come to Proclaim Liberty to those that are in captive to break every chain and the opening of the prison to them that are bound many of you are bound in your hearts and in your spirits and the devil just been working on that all along and you're wondering why do I feel like this why do I feel the need why do I feel the need to try and show off why do I feel the need for acceptance maybe you need to go back a step and say what has hurt me that I need this so now this is part of the problem because now you must remember Satan understands hurt he understands how to get to you now fathers is one of the biggest ways Satan will get to hurt you he's one of the biggest things he's going to use like I like I showed the the family structure but maybe like me I was raised in an amazing Christian family and I had very balanced parents and my parents didn't leave scars with me so how did Satan get to me well guess what remember I told you yesterday about the friends and how I felt alone that objection he used to get to me so he's going to find it might be a friends it might be a you know School situation it might be a teacher that that really says terrible things to you someone you really trusted you looked up to that has said horrible things to you and it created a great hurt and now with that hurt is a damaged heart a damaged mind and now Satan has an Avenue so he knows that if he can get you to to somehow uh find a crutch find a way to satisfy that hurt he'll keep getting you to run to the same thing because we all very I mean we sit in Youth Camp we all feeling an amazing Victorious but come Tuesday when you leave you it gets real again right and yeah maybe the emotions will ride you high for a week or two but it's you're going to hit like they say when the the tire what the rubber is going to hit the road eventually you're going to feel it things are going to come pressure is going to come and more than ever before I think even in a beautiful peaceful place like New Zealand I believe believe you can feel the pressures are rising in the world you look at the Middle East you look at the Ukraine war you look at the stocks the the the the inflation the interest rates you know you know it's coming you can feel like like brother B says it's like trying to ignore whistling in a graveyard but you know you're not comfortable something's up cuz if we honest about it you would know it so my question is this when you feel the pressure what do you run to the of the day is I don't care if it's an elderly brother of 80 years old or sister they don't understand Som your struggles your struggles is maybe like we' talked about pornography and social media and all these other things we'll maybe tackle just now but at the end of the day is no matter what you run to when the pressure gets high besides God it's wrong he is the one that's meant to help you with your heart that's hurt and your your mind and all these things that are damaged him but even the elderly run to other things you say what well they run to calming pools and you know reading a book or whatever they don't go to God cuz they're trying to shut down the hurt and whatever is their outlet they use but they don't go to God for the hurt they go to something else now the manifestations have become shall we say more Vivid more more in your face because there's some like studies of these things that have come out we'll we'll show some of this but at the end of the days my question is where do you run to when the pressure gets high because this is where Satan gets you he's going to create a situation family pressures work pressures you know political pressures there will be pressures that will come upon you and you're going to feel it and he knows that if he can somehow damage the connection between you and God you're going to run to something else besides God I believe we've all heard of dopamine Rush okay so dopamine is not a bad thing it's a it's a hormone that God gave to you and there's nothing wrong with it there's many hormones in our body um I'm sure our uh sister Becky at the back being a nurse knows this stuff well but ultimately you know there's different things in our bodies and God has made us and it's nothing wrong you you got emotions you got these different um uh uh what's the word I'm looking for but these there's different uh H hormones thank you yeah great so there's different hormones and and and obviously the one that Satan and there's many ways he'll get into but the one big thing he will use is a called dopamine and why because he's figured out something and science has also figured this out and this is why like things like drugs is so powerful so how you break don't me is not a bad thing you know if you go for a walk and you enjoy a nice meal and whatever you release happy hormones you're feeling good you know you feel you feel feel nice and it has a nice feeling and it's nice God made you to do that be like that but now what Satan has come and done is he's got you to have a quick fix with things that are not right so what happened you meant to just have a normal dopamine cycle now you can see dopamine is happy and it's all these technical things Ventra Teck Tech mental area nucleus you know whatever it just goes along but just to simplify it you know there's a normal way you're supposed to go but what Satan comes and do remember your brain is lazy your brain always will take the shortest path so if you're under stress your brain knows you need to feel good so whichever way it knows you're going to get feel happy soonest it's going it's going to make like a a connection a joint so what Satan has tried to trick everyone I believe everyone sitting here has fault this in some way he's created a scen scenario where you got tricked or like me got hurt and you went and ran to something else for Dr rush and he's now damaged your brain literally it's brain damage physical you can see it under sonar they can show you you got brain damage so let me show try and explain it to you think of a river up top a mountain and it's flowing down your brain is meant to just flow down through the natural crevices that God created and there's also the dopamine windes and everything's fine what Satan comes and does is through the dopamine Rush he cuts a massive Gorge down a a side of the mountain in your mind it just goes and it literally becomes brain damage so what your brain does instead of following the natural path that God had made you now have a shortcut to feel good so when the pressure Rises you immediately want to run to that pornography because your brain knows that's my fastest quickest way to feel good and you have this massive Rush sensation and you feel good for that moment but as you know our dear friend the devil not first causes you to get into the problem and then he comes this side and says oh if you a Son of God you would have never done that so he's just the the Vicious Cycle and you guys know yourself how these things work yes it feels great for the moment and whatever else but as the the hours pass and the days pass you feel as terrible as a dog and you think yourself man how could I even have love with that but you have a damaged brain that the devil got a chance and has created in your head you literally have a damaged brain and God has to help us and we're going to show you by God's grace but we first have to go through some things but I first need to understand how dopamine rushes work and like I said it manifests in many many different ways so just some quick stats on pornography and stuff like that you know 90% of kids aged 8 to 16 have viewed it you know it's it's there's so many stats you know um it's a huge industry it's unbelievably big and and yeah it says one and six of women do you know that has increased drastically it's almost now two to three3 uh yeah two yeah roughly 2/3 of women now also have and have had their struggles so don't think it's it's exempt from the message it can get into us all and we need God's help this is very small but I'm just going to try and uh read but the average age that kids now view pornography is 11 years old um it's the number one uh sex is the number one searched thing in the world that's number one search subject um two 2.5 billion emails per day of pornography that's 8% of all emails two out of three of college students have had friends with benefits relationships um this is America Alone by the way 94% of Americas actually it's funny enough cuz they know people you know what see what we've have now is and when you go and research about these things there's been a massive drive by Satan to try to say it's okay there really is he's trying to say no it's healthy and you know you should you can even bring it in your relationship and all this nonsense there's a big drive and they they you know just when you go and research these things you need to filter through God's word because ultimately the devil's going to try and tell you it's fun it's not fun because if you're just honest with yourself you'll see your reaction and I mean there's so many bad side effects we won't go into all of that but it's been proven clinically we don't need to fight the the Devils that that have been raised up to try and make this acceptable but anyways um there's some more stuff here but I think you guys are well versed you can go uh you know go this s but I'm I'm not going to go too much so yeah we we we so often we'll talk about pornography and stuff but there's another thing that's on the rise like never before gaming now I know I'm going to hit some hard points here but just hear me out okay hear me out okay because it's now yet again it's been clinically proven that gaming is a serious problem and it's starting to influence in a massive way I mean it's crazy to see the growth of game G in I mean we now sitting where we are now 2024 I mean the the market the market uh uh hold what the the amount the the the what's the word I'm looking for you know just the size of the market and this is in in US billions currently 2024 was predicted to go to $278 billion it is a huge market and it's getting so uh amongst the public because it's the ultimate way to escape I mean think about it I could be this huge overweight guy you know like you know a society weirdo you know and just muddle along but I can get into a gaming chair log in and suddenly I become Superman literally and I can live for hours in this world where I go and Conquer levels and I become this God of the universe of wherever I'm based and I can feel so good and then obviously when reality strikes ah not so bad but I can get back into the gaming I'm the hero and you know I can go and this this thing has so captured you know there's certain uh uh places I think it's Austria that have now got rehab centers for gaming literally it's rehab centers never mind for drugs gaming rehab centers and it's just becoming so big and and I mean I've went I I I kind of half regret it but you know as a minister you must go to Dark Places to understand what's happening so I went and checked last year what is the number one 2023 game and I can't remember what it was now but man the stuff that's in there is demonic of the next level you know when B Bram says that you know these cartoons and stuff is going it's going to like soften the mind for the great Onslaught that the devil's going to bring you have to understand it's not just about that but when you start doving in these demonic dragons and these stuff and these these zombies and whatever else it's softening your mind to the devils and it's going to lower your your your guard so Game Addict facts 60.8% of respondents said they considered themselves gamer 80 out of 128 respondents said they put off sleeping or eating to play video games and I'm sorry to say I've been there done there got the T-shirt when I used to be in games used to enjoy it you log on whatever I can't remember what I used to play but anyways and uh you know you get there and you really have good intentions you know kids are on bed going to play for an hour or two and then you know 1:00 that morning Next Level Next Level what is going to happen and it cap it pulls you in I know it you can't you can't tell me it doesn't cuz I've been there and I've done that and I got the T-shirt it really pulls you in that thing pulls you in like it's saying you you I need to work the next day you guys some of you need to go to school the next day and you walk to school looking like a zombie or to work because you've had so little sleep and then how does that affect your productivity at work and where you mean to actually you know come to the the the the party as such one out of 100 out of 128 respondents said they put off their tasks to play video games mommy says please take out the the rubbish and whatever else and Junior stuck in the room 76 out of the 128 respondents said they play games to escape from real life problems anxiety or depression and the reality is it makes it worse you think you escape when you come out is worse than where it was 35 out of 128 respondents said they considered gaming as a future job because it is now a big thing you get all these gaming tournaments and whatever else you can log on and it's become a huge thing so maybe gaming is something you need to be realistic about and like I said we are just asking for Honest Hearts we not yet to say don't go play a game it's of the devil I'm just saying you this is the facts and if you can't handle it then you have to be honest with God and say I need to maybe just be honest that's all I'm saying I'm not here to say don't play games I'm saying you be honest with yourself and if you see you can't control it or then be realistic and honest and step back health risk of video gaming lack of social engagement problems concentrating poor hygiene yeah cuz you're not going into the shower you want to just play your game lack of adequate sleep failure to complete School family and work rated obligations anxiety it actually adds anxiety irritability anger you know Mom I'm coming I know you told me just I'm just need to get through the level I'm so close you know I know these things agitation loss of appetite reduced physical exercise which is what you meant to be you sp to get out there and get some fresh air now this is something you guys it's just yet again social media it's it's something that's part of our Lives I mean many of us it's just what we we we on stuff and but if you can't control it yet again be honest with yourself what are you trying to get out of it what what are you where where is your heart going experts estimate that over 210 million people worldwide suffer from social media addiction that's a lot of people 210 million people and I'm sure that's even gone up 15 of people aged 23 to 38 admit they are addicted to to social media that's only 15% when we know that the stat should be way higher that's the problem is they can't admit to it teens who spend more than 5 hours a day uh phones are two times more likely to show depressive at side effects to show depression cuz that's unfortunately what these things do you go on there like I said to feel boost to get your likes to to get something inside of you that little hunger satisfied but actually causes more Depression more anxiety and all these things s out of 10 teens who use social media for more than 5 hours a day have a significant greater risk of committing suicide these are stats I'm I'm not pulling this up this is from World Health guys that do all this stuff okay yet again we're not condemning social media I'm not saying get off Facebook and get off Tik Tok or whatever you are but if you can't control it you need to then be real 27% of people spend more than 3 hours a day on social media uh displayed poor mental health facts it's not me it's not brother Michael it's facts from the health side of the world now this is as I said we this thing this thing as we know gets into everything I can get into anything I want practically on this thing it's open device I mean for the used to talk against television we now have television we now have games we now have you know internet we have everything on this phone and we Carri it with us even went into church how dangerous that this thing has been put amongst us and the devil has made it that you almost don't have a choice now so many of us are jobs we have to have our phone we have to talk with clients so he's forced this thing upon us yet this is the worst Little Weapon that has ever been given to mankind because you can be alone in your bed no one knows about it and you can can be anywhere in the world looking at anything you want to the deepest darkest stuff the first question tonight brother brandom I think television is a curse to the world what do you think about it well whoever wrote it remember yeah now we don't even talk about television it's just all this other stuff that has come I'm going to agree with you they have made it a curse to the world it could be a blessing to the world but they've made it a curse that's the point it's not that TV is bad it's what they do on the TV that's a problem anything like that my dear people is what you look at yourself cuz yeah is the true truth of it if television is a curse then the newspaper is a curse then the radio is a curse and many times the telephone is the telephone is a curse CCC it's what you make out of it that's the big thing if you can control it it's fine but if you can't control it then you going to have to put some blockers blocks blockages in place cuz that's ultimately what you need to do and and get obviously Deliverance which we'll we'll finish off on so yes it's not so much about that but it's about what you do with it but by God's grace we have a Christian anesthetic amen there's opium comes from a Lily and the Christian church has some opium and it's from the lily of the valley amen uhhuh sues all the pains and it's all over then when you get this Christian opium this new wine that they have had on the day of Pentecost see it soes out the pain people so arrogant and they're doing things that they ought not to do instead of trying to get rid of the cause now this is so important remember we spoke about causes how Satan gets a cause and then he can get in and if you don't identify your cause it can sometimes hinder your healing that's why I say we're going to go to some dark we have to go to some dark places because if you can't admit my dad has hurt me you won't be able to get healing you have to sometimes be honest with yourself if you can't admit I've been hurt and my hurt has drove me to pornography and all these things you're not going to be able to get it and and yes the Lord can be gracious because we don't know these things sometimes we have generational problems that have been handed down but by God's grace let's just open our hearts and be honest instead of trying to get rid of the cause they're just putting another cause with it so you're not acknowledging the problem so you're replacing it with something else you can never find the cure until you get rid of the cause you see in the prayer lines people come to brother Brandon and what does he do where he wherever it's necessary he'll go to the course oh I see you as a young girl walking down the street and a dog started chasing you and since then you've been a nervous person why did the prophet have to say that why could he say you're a nervous person Lord help the sister deliver of nervousness and mental issues no he went to the cause and identified it and then the the Satan was exposed we know that story about that woman that uh committed adultery and uh she was trying to get prayed and brother B no matter how much he prayed he couldn't get her he couldn't help her she couldn't get deliverance and she got sick and sick and sick and eventually all the years passed and then it came to the prophet that she had committed adultery and never made it right with her husband and that hindered her healing so you want to you want to put in a a front and and build Wars around you not allow the Lord to get to the cause well then he can't help you but if you can be honest and go back to the cause he can help you man is trying to find something to satisfy and he thirsts cuz you've been hurt and your your Nature's within you like that and God made him to thirst that he was built up that way but God built him that way so he thirst after him not other things but he tries to satisfy it and hush that Holy core in him with things of the world and we have no right to do that now but the people do wrong constantly constantly instead of going to the place to get rid of the cause we try to Hass it with anesthetics with pornography with social media with gaming and liquor and smoking and putting more to it heaping it up all the time making it worse and all this only builds up pressure it makes it worse all the time I want to help you with your addictions and your problems because this is something that I had to go through remember I said that even though I received the Holy Ghost I still had my addiction problem I told you that the Lord had to show me a walk of how to get rid of it this is where I want to help you brother and sisters so I want you to take note amen we're going to go through something very critical and by God's grace I trust this will be the day that many here will get Deliverance of the things that are bothering you and those things but you're going to have to walk a road and I need to explain this so take note carefully of this part because it's so important to understand okay so you get two things how God heals you okay God is the Healer he died on the cross to heal you he is the Healer you just have to accept it that's it's done this you're you're overcoming your addiction your issues your heart problems it's done God has already said he died on the cross for you but now you need to accept it and find a way how he can help you now Miracles and Divine Healing is two different things you need to understand this okay a miracle is I come and I pray for the sister with cancer on her neck and instantly the cancer drops off and she's healed we would love to have that amen I would love God right now to just come down and all of you and say all the pornography all the addictions are gone in Jesus name and it's out the window wouldn't that be wonderful but you see there's another way God heals and that's through Divine Healing now how Divine Healing works we're going to go through and brother brandham says that God now mostly deals in Divine Healing he says that so yes we love the Miracles and that's often what we always play when we hear a little sermon clip how this person instantly receives their sight or whatever yeah it excites us but the reality is most of the time God deals in Divine Healing so to get Divine Healing first of all you have to acknowledge you need healing if you can't acknowledge you need help it's not going to help so yes it's easy when you got an outside thing to say oh I've got uh you know cancer or I've got low blood pre uh high blood pressure or I've got this disease or that disease because you feel it it affects you right not so easy when it goes into the heart realm and the spirit realm because you also need healing from the spirit realm and the Heart realm so first you need to acknowledge you need help and you need healing for both physical and emotional disease it doesn't just stop at the Physical Realm so through prayer as I said it's it's a fact if if if a minister of the Gospel or even you amongst each other can pray for each other you will that demon leaves it's it's of God it's commanded of God that that demon leaves but what happens this is what happens is brother bam shows that initially you might feel fine but as a few days pass you'll feel worse than ever that's what he says so he talks like about a cancer inside of you you pray that demon leaves the cancer but that cancer is still within you and now your blood has to purify out that cancer and he says you'll feel worse and more sick than ever and he says almost some as he says there that you almost feel like you're going to die and you're going to have some serious things you're going to have to do but pretty much it's the body cleaning out and repairing he talks about beh having almost torture physically mentally and you could feel like you can just go go die or go insane however he says that's the time to praise him because that's evidence that the demon has left you but what happens many times that we doubt our healing and our faith wavers then the devil Returns what happens he prays the demon out and the Bible says he goes walk the demon goes walking in dry places and if he comes back and he finds that the house is empty he comes straight back in and brother Bram says if you doubt it then the devil com straight back in so I'm done but now I need you to ready to pay attention remember we spoke about the dope mean damage of the brain okay your brain has been damaged by Satan it needs healing so what is happening many times brothers and sisters you've come up to for prayer many times am I right some of us have come up to the prayer line or we've prayed out to God asking him for deliverance and like I said God is the deliverer he is the Healer and God will heal you but what happens is because your mind is damaged and like I said it's maybe easier if you had a cancel something but this is in the spirit realm this is in your mind realm that is damaged remember I explained it's scientific your brain is actually had damage done now that water that wants to keep flowing down when the pressure Rises wants to come there and yes you prayed away the demon that the devil got in V porography or whatever it's in that channel that is damaged but now we need healing and now what has to happen is you're going to have to understand brothers and sisters that if like brother BR says many times you're going to have to go through he healing and I would love like I said just to have a miracle but now your brain being damaged it needs to build a bridge back where the damage is so that your mind can start running normal again like it should so understand you're going to have to maybe go through some intense struggle and mental battles when you're delivered of your thing and your evens slip up why because remember it's damaged but you no matter even if you slip up even if you find yourself going back if you you already believe God has delivered you of that problem you're going to have to hold fast in faith that even when things come to say I believe that you have done this for me God I believe I'm delivered and haltered and not doubt that is hard that is going to be hard but I believe if you're really sincere if you really want to walk the road of healing and we're going to pray over each other now amen by God's grace Grace and and if there's some ministers are like to come if you are like to come forward to be to pray it if you want to really commit but you're going to have to be committed I'm I'm going to tell you now it's going to not be easy like the prophet says that when you get healing it's horrible you almost want to die imagine a brain that is damage that you're going to have to allow God over his time to build the bridge back it's going to be so difficult but if you want to trust God and believe God for your deliverance he can do it I had to walk that road I didn't understand it I knew that Spirit was gone I could feel it but I'll now and again finding myself tripping up and I was questioning the Lord how can this be I know that is gone how can this be and he said to me son I'm healing you it will take time so there's 100% power in prayer to deliver of that that demon that spirit that is bothering you and oppressing you but now you're going to have to walk a road of healing I know maybe it's challenging in your mind or what I'm saying because you you just you think physical healing remember we're talking in the mental realm but as I say if you put your brain under a Sona you would see the damage they could show you the damage that has been created God needs to heal that and there's currently demons locked into the damage cuz that's how a spirit gets upon you that's how the sickness gets upon you Satan uses a damaged cell then he can enter the damaged cell and that's how sickness gets in or through your your genes Etc brothers and sisters God is the deliverer he is the Healer we want to help you and silence it's going to be hard and I said I know you want the miracle I want you I know you want the instant Del deliverance and I pray it over as many as possible but what if God wants you to walk a road of healing are you going to trust him are you going to believe him and let him take you through let's stand to our feet together amen can I ask brother to brother sister to sister just to put your arm on if you're not next to someone just move around I just want everyone to be touching someone Amen brother to brother sister to sister amen let's have let's have everyone just touching I want a touching Point amen God has said that like we said in you is is a well of Living Waters amen when he when he when he gave us you know his promise he said that same power he'll invest in all of us so yes you're welcome if you want for minister to come up and be prayed for amen that's fine we don't have an issue but within you the person that you're connected to has also the right to pray for you and have the exact same results amen so don't doubt the person next to you so I want you to do me a favor I don't want you to pray for yourself I want you to pray for the one that is next to you and say Lord Heal that person help that person because you're now going to intercede for them and you're going to by your by God's grace you will deliver that person of that thing and then you must trust God Amen are you prepared to walk the road of healing let's pray for each other and ask God to give us strength during this what lies this time that lies ahead amen let's close our eyes and I want to hear you pray amen don't pray softly pray out loud because don't worry you're not hiding any anything within but pray for that person let's hear it let's raise our voices to God at this time amen let's pray to together dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you at this time lord just realizing Lord God that we need you so very very much Lord God standing before you as the children that desperately want to serve you Lord but the devil has gotten amongst them he hurt them he's damaged them Lord Lord he's he's got an Avenue where he's got into Lord their their mind

of these young people that have been tormented Ed by the devil lord that they've been so struck low that the devil has manipulated them that has Lord just treated them with such with such disdain and so harshly Lord I pray that in your name Lord God that the power of the Holy Spirit may come down this morning Lord and touch each and every life that's present here and even those that are streaming

Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain make every chain hallelujah amen hallelujah I'm so thankful that the chain breaker is also our Heavenly husband our Heavenly lover our heavenly father amen it is it is such a wonderful blessing I I'm just I don't want to take more time but I just want to just want to share one or two thoughts and that is that you know Jesus could have grown up and identify with with a Mary and a Joseph Jesus could you know today we go back we read in Matthew 1 AM mean David was the son of Jesse and Solomon was the son of David and the lineage and so forth and he could look at his natural lineage or Jesus could go to John one and find his spiritual lineage and see in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and identify with himself there I want to encourage you this morning identify with your heavenly father you know brother random got to a point where he said I recognized I'm no longer the son of Charles and Ella Brenham because before I was the son of Charles and Ella Brenham I was the son of God H Allelujah in fact when the logos was expressed I know this is maybe deep but when the logos was expressed on Earth already I was expressed as a Son of God right there hallelujah amen and when we battle through this earth when our Earthly parents haven't haven't been what they should have been because of like our brother said because of their own hurts because of their own complexes because of their own experience we have a heavenly father who really really does care amen also just want to mention something quickly about that principle of Divine Healing there's this a very beautiful symbol that I also always love looking at you know the time of the Jubilee year you know the principle right so in when the Jubilee year comes and there's been a squatter on the land when the Jubilee year comes the land is restored but sometimes when the land has been restored the squatter didn't look after the land very much and sometimes when that land has been restored now the original owner that the land has been been restored too has a lot of hard work to do to pick up the stones to to recultivated the land to trim All The Vines and sometimes that takes time and that's how Divine Healing works you know sometimes it's restored to you but there's work to do I mean there's a time there's Faith to have there's a testimony to have I mean it's like that John Ryan that brother Bram speaks about you know he was he was healed but he had to go confess his healing and that blind man you remember the story when eventually he sat in that barber's chair one day he got the manifestation of his healing but it didn't just happen immediately am mean may the Lord give you that Grace I mean that that revelation will strike your heart that I am healed I'm set free the the the chains have been broken and trust the Lord and working the testimony even if you do not see one symptom of it because like a brother said yesterday that's the sign of a mature person is when we when we walk in faith even when we do not see the evidence Hallelujah let's sing one more Song without music because I suspect not many would know it it's a old old song but it goes for the old old people hiding in thee my saor hiding in the my Lord thou bless Rock of AES I am hideing in thee let sing it with me
