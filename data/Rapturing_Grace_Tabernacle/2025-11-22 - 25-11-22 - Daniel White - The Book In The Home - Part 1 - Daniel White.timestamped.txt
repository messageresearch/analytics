[33:43] word of prayer. Um, so just an
[33:45] announcement. Please remember the
[33:47] potluck lunch tomorrow between services
[33:50] in case you're wondering. We're not
[33:51] expecting many visitors. Uh [music]
[33:53] prayer requests.
[33:55] So please pray for brother Steven and
[33:57] sister Julene for their trip to South
[33:59] Africa that the Lord will protect them
[34:01] and keep them and bless them with a
[34:03] wonderful trip. Amen. And request from
[34:06] brother Vera. Um Judah's unwell with a
[34:11] tummy bug and is quite weak. Um I
[34:14] definitely miss him when he's not here
[34:16] in a song service. So um and sister
[34:20] Leone as well has started to come uh
[34:22] start to feel a bit nauseous and a sore
[34:24] tummy. So pray for them and the rest of
[34:27] the household that the Lord will protect
[34:29] them.
[34:32] Sorry. Heavenly Father, we love you
[34:34] Lord.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Lord we [music]
[34:38] thank you Father that we can come here
[34:39] on a Saturday night. Father, it's not
[34:42] our usual service, but Lord, we thank
[34:44] you that we can come here and just come
[34:48] to a place where we know you reside,
[34:51] Father. You're here all the time,
[34:53] Father. And
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, we
[34:56] thank you, Father, that we can spend
[35:00] this time together in your word and
[35:02] singing praise and worshiping [music]
[35:03] you, Father. And Lord, we ask that
[35:06] you'll be here tonight, Father. Speak to
[35:09] us, Lord. you know our hearts and what
[35:12] we have need of, Father. And Lord, I ask
[35:15] that you'll meet each one and
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, as brother Daniel brings the word,
[35:19] just speak through them and just reveal
[35:23] more of yourself to us, Father, that we
[35:25] can see you in a clearer picture,
[35:27] Father. Lord, we also bring the prayer
[35:30] requests to you and Uncle Steven and
[35:33] Tulene as they head over to South
[35:35] Africa. I know there are a number of
[35:36] others going over in the next little
[35:38] while. I ask that you'll keep them all
[35:40] as they travel, Father. Keep them safe
[35:42] and have your protecting hand over them,
[35:45] Father. Lord, I also pray for
[35:49] little Steven's brother-in-law, Father
[35:51] Rick, and the family, Lord. Just carry
[35:55] them through this time, Father. Continue
[35:57] to
[35:58] have them close to your heart and just
[36:01] really show your love and mercy to them,
[36:04] Father. Lord, we also pray for Judah and
[36:07] Sister Leone. Touch their bodies,
[36:10] Father. Restore them and bring them back
[36:12] to full health and protect the rest of
[36:15] the family. Father, we ask these things
[36:17] in your precious name. Amen. [music]

[57:26] It's a very exciting, very special
[57:29] services this weekend and we've just had
[57:32] an absolutely wonderful time so far.
[57:36] Just really thankful for [music] the
[57:38] youth service we had last night. I can
[57:40] highly recommend it to those who were
[57:42] wasn't [music]
[57:43] able to fit into the category to come to
[57:47] uh to have a listen to it. It's uh
[57:48] [music] we've sent out the link this
[57:50] morning as you would have seen. Um so
[57:52] highly recommend it and we just had a
[57:54] lovely time with the breakfast also this
[57:57] morning. I wonder if I can ask you to
[57:58] take your seats just for a moment if you
[58:01] don't mind.
[58:03] Um, so, uh, it kind of feels strange to
[58:06] welcome brother Daniel and Sister Cheryl
[58:08] halfway through the weekend because
[58:09] we've we've had had a bit of them
[58:11] already, but um, it's just a real
[58:13] privilege to have you both here and may
[58:15] God just make you feel very welcome
[58:18] among us. you're just [music] very very
[58:21] close friends of the church and um we
[58:23] just want to recognize you and
[58:26] appreciate you just love you to bits
[58:28] [music] and um it's um
[58:33] I I put the the um in fact Bella put the
[58:36] request on the chat on what was it
[58:39] Thursday night? Yes. effort that I was
[58:42] going to go through to Oakuckland and
[58:44] pick Brother Daniel up and and I was so
[58:47] aware of your prayers um [music] driving
[58:50] through there was just a real real
[58:52] privilege and I want to say thank you to
[58:53] to you for your prayers and thank you
[58:55] Lord for [music]
[58:57] um for keeping me and I um I got there
[59:00] good time. There was obviously not a lot
[59:02] of traffic on the road that time of
[59:04] night. [music] Um but we uh we left and
[59:06] came back um Friday morning and man I
[59:11] enjoyed the trip. It was so good.
[59:14] [laughter]
[59:14] Brother Daniel and I didn't stop talking
[59:16] for a second. We just going and going
[59:19] and going just sharing different things
[59:21] that we've been looking at and so it's
[59:23] just been absolutely wonderful and we've
[59:25] just had a wonderful time with him so
[59:27] far. Um just really excited about the
[59:29] weekend also. Um so just a little bit of
[59:33] background. Um, where this weekend came
[59:36] from was I think it was was it at the
[59:39] youth camp that you that you did a a a
[59:42] service.
[59:43] Um, [music]
[59:44] and uh and a few of you who were there
[59:48] or listened to it recommended it to me.
[59:51] Um, and I went and listened to it and I
[59:53] phoned brother Daniel. I said, "Man,
[59:55] this is [music] so good. Do you think
[59:56] you can spread it over three services
[59:58] and and come preach it here by us over
[1:00:00] [music] a weekend?" And brother Daniel's
[1:00:02] answer was, "Well, brother Chad has
[1:00:04] asked me to come preach to his family
[1:00:05] camp." Um, so and it's the same topic.
[1:00:09] So, absolutely, we we'll do that, God
[1:00:12] willing. So, of course, then after that
[1:00:14] one service, he's expanded it to a whole
[1:00:16] weekend worth of services um over a
[1:00:18] family camp. So, it's um it's obviously
[1:00:21] the Lord [music] grows the thought as
[1:00:23] you go and just really excited to what
[1:00:26] what what the Lord is going to say to us
[1:00:28] tonight. Um [music] and really this
[1:00:30] morning and last night we had glimpses
[1:00:32] of the thought, I believe. So, just be
[1:00:35] yourself and let the Lord use you. We we
[1:00:38] uh we want you to be at home among us.
[1:00:40] You are really you're part of the
[1:00:41] family. Um, something else that I forgot
[1:00:44] to give feedback of on Wednesday night
[1:00:46] and someone asked me afterwards and I
[1:00:48] could kick myself was I asked you to
[1:00:50] pray last Sunday for the
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; um, barbecue we had with the ministers
[1:00:54] in town. Um, and I I just wanted to say
[1:00:57] I'm so thrilled how it went. Um, we had
[1:01:00] a really positive time with them and um,
[1:01:05] they uh, they were all surprised that
[1:01:07] um, it was the biggest turnout
[1:01:09] apparently they've ever had for an end
[1:01:11] of year function which is pretty good. I
[1:01:13] think the barbecue invite had something
[1:01:14] to do with it maybe. I don't know. Um
[1:01:17] but yeah, we it was just a very relaxed
[1:01:20] time and I I guess it would have been
[1:01:21] helpful for them to see [music] that we
[1:01:24] are normal people with normal ways and
[1:01:27] so forth and just [music] let the light
[1:01:29] shine. Um we had I hope that's not going
[1:01:32] to embarrass her, but we we had Amanda
[1:01:34] there [music] too who was um very kindly
[1:01:37] offered to help us with getting things
[1:01:40] [music] done and so on. And she was the
[1:01:42] light of the party. She was so good and
[1:01:45] uh they loved her to bits and she um she
[1:01:49] made such a difference. So it was it was
[1:01:51] lovely to see that um that gift in her
[1:01:53] life [music] shining too. So it was real
[1:01:55] special.
[1:01:58] Praise the Lord. So I don't want to take
[1:02:01] any further time. We we [music] want to
[1:02:03] give the word all the time. So I I have
[1:02:06] to say thank you so much for those those
[1:02:08] song [music] items. It was really
[1:02:09] special. and Sister Julia, I think that
[1:02:11] was your best best item ever. Proud of
[1:02:15] you for playing and singing in the same
[1:02:17] item. That that takes courage. [music]
[1:02:20] So that was real special. Thank you.
[1:02:23] Praise the Lord. Let's stand together.
[1:02:24] Maybe let's just sing that same song
[1:02:26] again as I call brother Daniel up.

[1:02:33] you promised. [music]

[1:04:36] reveals to us. Um the focus of life is
[1:04:41] him. He he is our focus. You know that's
[1:04:43] the the bride's focus is is always her
[1:04:47] groom and uh we are thankful that we
[1:04:52] know who we are focusing on. We are
[1:04:56] focus we are are thankful that we know
[1:04:58] who we are looking at who is present who
[1:05:01] is here with us who is guiding us and
[1:05:04] who is leading us. Uh I trust that the
[1:05:08] services uh will be a blessing to you.
[1:05:12] Um they they certainly been a tremendous
[1:05:16] help to me and you know sometimes these
[1:05:20] type of things don't come without
[1:05:24] experiences
[1:05:26] uh trials,
[1:05:28] tears, laughter, joy, all those good
[1:05:32] things. But uh we thank the Lord for who
[1:05:37] he is
[1:05:39] uh in our lives. Amen. So, we're not
[1:05:42] we're not strangers to one another by by
[1:05:44] any means. So, um we we will just um go
[1:05:50] go into the the word this morning this
[1:05:54] evening, isn't it?
[1:05:57] Um so, um yeah, we we thank the Lord for
[1:06:02] the opportunity just to to share these
[1:06:04] things with you. And this this evening I
[1:06:06] may just be building up a little bit. Um
[1:06:10] just and then just beginning to to uh to
[1:06:14] to touch on the things [clears throat]
[1:06:16] that we will look at over the next
[1:06:18] couple of services. And once again, I'm
[1:06:21] just going to start my stopwatch.
[1:06:24] So, uh praise the Lord. Um I think I've
[1:06:28] got this thing worked out. Yeah, there
[1:06:31] we go. So, um, the thought tonight,
[1:06:34] well, it's really going to be over the
[1:06:36] weekend, but is the book in the home,
[1:06:40] the book in the home, and then as a as a
[1:06:43] subtitle, the the changing of the scene.
[1:06:47] Uh, so we want to pick this up in Luke
[1:06:50] chapter chapter 19. And, uh, the picture
[1:06:54] before this is kind of the the story
[1:06:56] here. This is the uh Luke Luke um sorry
[1:07:00] 19 is the the uh story of of Zakius
[1:07:07] at least the part of it that we're we're
[1:07:09] going to to read about. Um so we'll
[1:07:12] we'll read here from from verse verse
[1:07:15] one
[1:07:17] of uh Luke 19.
[1:07:20] And Jesus entered and passed through
[1:07:22] Jericho. And behold, there was a man
[1:07:26] named Zakius,
[1:07:28] which was the chief among the publicans,
[1:07:32] and he was rich.
[1:07:34] And he sought to see Jesus,
[1:07:37] who he was, and could not for the press,
[1:07:42] because he was little of stature.
[1:07:46] and he ran before and climbed up into a
[1:07:51] sycamore tree to see him, for he was to
[1:07:56] pass that way.
[1:07:58] And when Jesus ca came to the place, he
[1:08:03] looked up and saw him and said unto him,
[1:08:08] "Zakius,
[1:08:10] make haste and come down,
[1:08:14] for today I must abide
[1:08:18] at thy house."
[1:08:21] And he made haste and came down and
[1:08:24] received him joyfully.
[1:08:27] And when they saw it, they all murmured
[1:08:30] saying that he was gone to be a guest
[1:08:34] with a man that is a sinner.
[1:08:38] So we want to just draw the the thought
[1:08:40] here this evening from uh verse five
[1:08:45] there where Jesus said in in halfway
[1:08:48] through he says Zakius make haste and
[1:08:50] come down for today I must abide at thy
[1:08:56] house.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; So we'll we'll catch up with that in a
[1:09:00] little bit. Let's just turn to the book
[1:09:02] of Revelation chapter 5. uh this will
[1:09:07] will be our our this is our focus. This
[1:09:10] is where we will end up over the next
[1:09:13] couple of services. Uh Revelation 5
[1:09:17] uh 1 through to 7.
[1:09:21] It says, "And I saw in the right hand of
[1:09:23] him that sat upon the throne a book
[1:09:26] written within and on the backside
[1:09:29] sealed with seven seals.
[1:09:32] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:09:34] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[1:09:38] the book, and to loose the seals
[1:09:41] thereof? And no man in heaven nor in
[1:09:45] earth, neither under the earth, was able
[1:09:47] to open the book, neither to look
[1:09:50] thereon. And I wept much, because no man
[1:09:54] was found worthy to open the book, and
[1:09:57] to read the book, neither to look
[1:10:00] thereon. And one of the elders saith
[1:10:03] unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of
[1:10:05] the tribe of Judah, the root of David,
[1:10:08] hath prevailed to open the book, and to
[1:10:12] loose the seals thereof. And I beheld,
[1:10:17] and lo, in the midst of the throne of
[1:10:19] the four beasts, and in the midst of the
[1:10:21] elders stood a lamb, as it had been
[1:10:24] slain, having seven horns and seven
[1:10:28] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[1:10:30] God, sent forth into all the earth. And
[1:10:34] he came and took the book out of the
[1:10:36] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:10:40] throne. Amen. So, we're going to look at
[1:10:43] that a little bit this even this this
[1:10:45] evening um and just work our way through
[1:10:48] that over the next couple of services.
[1:10:50] But let's just bow our hearts in a word
[1:10:52] of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord
[1:10:55] God, you know our needs, Lord, you are
[1:11:00] the only one Lord who can rightly divide
[1:11:03] the word. You are the only one who can
[1:11:07] reveal this book. And Lord Jesus, you
[1:11:11] know how much that we need you tonight.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And Lord God, may we just
[1:11:20] identify that.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; May we connect with that, Lord, to the
[1:11:23] best of our ability. Lord, we we may not
[1:11:27] know to the extent of how much we
[1:11:29] actually need you,
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; but Lord God, we do know that we need
[1:11:34] you here tonight. Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we pray heavenly father
[1:11:39] that you would do what only you can do
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; and that is Lord reveal the contents of
[1:11:46] this book
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; that Lord you might receive glory and
[1:11:50] honor through the revealing. We pray in
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ's precious name.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can take your
[1:11:59] seats uh tonight.
[1:12:03] So, we just want to just just want to
[1:12:06] speak on this Luke chapter 19 a little
[1:12:09] bit here. And you'll see it before Luke
[1:12:12] 19. I've got Luke 4 uh 14-22. And you
[1:12:16] probably understand that that is the
[1:12:18] scripture where Jesus goes to the
[1:12:21] synagogue as it were custom. I think
[1:12:24] last time I was here, I ministered on
[1:12:26] ministered on rising by revelation.
[1:12:30] And uh that's where that this thought um
[1:12:33] uh part of that thought came from. But
[1:12:36] we understand that that Jesus went went
[1:12:38] to church. He went to the synagogue as
[1:12:40] it was his custom to do. And uh he he
[1:12:44] sat down and uh then he was um asked to
[1:12:50] to read the scroll. So he stood up and
[1:12:54] took the book which was closed
[1:12:58] and he opened the book in order to find
[1:13:02] where it was written of him. And he
[1:13:05] begin to read the scripture concerning
[1:13:08] himself.
[1:13:10] Um
[1:13:11] the spirit of the lord is upon me etc
[1:13:15] etc. So what he did in that in that uh
[1:13:19] in that Luke uh chapter 4 was he was
[1:13:23] revealing himself
[1:13:25] to be the book.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; he was the word. We understand that uh
[1:13:31] John 1 in the beginning was the word.
[1:13:33] The word was the the word became flesh
[1:13:36] and the word was God and the word became
[1:13:38] flesh and dwelt among us. He was the
[1:13:41] word but here he was identifying himself
[1:13:45] as the book. He was the word made flesh.
[1:13:50] Now that book is the book that said
[1:13:55] Zakius I come down make haste for today
[1:14:01] I must abide at your home. All right.
[1:14:04] So, we're looking at the book in the
[1:14:07] home
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; because the book
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; beautiful
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; invited himself
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; to Zakius's house.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Now, he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:14:20] bodily. You may not remember it. I don't
[1:14:24] think you do. But you went to Zakius's
[1:14:27] house.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. [laughter]
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Because you was in him.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. [clears throat]
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; All right. because you were a part of
[1:14:35] him. God had not separated the bride
[1:14:38] from the groom yet. So you actually
[1:14:41] visited Zakius's house. Uh we don't
[1:14:44] recollect it. We don't we don't remember
[1:14:47] it happening. But revelation can say I
[1:14:50] was there.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; All right. By revelation we can say I
[1:14:54] was there. So at at that point there
[1:14:59] there was Jesus was the manifestation
[1:15:04] of the book.
[1:15:06] All right? He was the book in the home.
[1:15:12] But now we know because of the actions
[1:15:16] of that book, the death, burial and
[1:15:20] resurrection of that book, that act has
[1:15:24] made it possible
[1:15:26] for the other parts of the book
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; to come forward.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; All right. So we understand that that
[1:15:36] that book the the Jesus the fullness of
[1:15:39] the godhead bodily he understood his
[1:15:43] purpose
[1:15:45] and he acted according
[1:15:48] to his understanding.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Uh he he acted according to the
[1:15:54] revelation
[1:15:56] of who he was.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] He stood as the lamb of God before
[1:16:02] Pilate at the judgment hall. He did not
[1:16:06] try to defend himself. He did not try to
[1:16:10] escape
[1:16:12] because he knew who he was. He knew that
[1:16:16] was his purpose,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; right? So he he had no need to avoid his
[1:16:22] purpose, but he actually had to battle
[1:16:25] to remain in his purpose.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He he never fought to to avoid the
[1:16:34] purpose, but his fight was to remain as
[1:16:38] the lamb of God
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; because he didn't have to do it.
[1:16:44] He had a choice
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; whether to do it or not to do it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; But he chose to do it. All right? He
[1:16:52] chose to stay there. He chose to die for
[1:16:55] you and I. And I'm speaking in these
[1:16:58] terms of the book chose because that is
[1:17:02] that is who he was. He he was the book
[1:17:07] made flesh. Yes.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Right now, the reason that we're we're
[1:17:11] focusing and we're we're saying
[1:17:13] particular things is because there was a
[1:17:16] there was a a part of that book in
[1:17:18] Revelation 5
[1:17:22] that was going to also be made flesh.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; The revelation of that book was going to
[1:17:30] reveal that book made flesh.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; All right? So if the book is on earth
[1:17:37] today,
[1:17:39] he's not on earth in the form that he
[1:17:42] was.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But he is he is here in a form that he
[1:17:48] had predestined. He had ordained himself
[1:17:50] to be in. I think that's beautiful that
[1:17:53] that God ordained himself to be here in
[1:17:57] a in another form other than what he was
[1:18:01] 2,000 years ago.
[1:18:03] uh not by your will
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; that is he here but by his own will.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It's his own will to be here in a form
[1:18:13] that he wasn't 2,000 years ago. All
[1:18:17] right. So if if the book is on earth
[1:18:21] today,
[1:18:23] then the book God desires the book to
[1:18:28] know its purpose.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] Yeah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; God desires
[1:18:34] the book, the book's purpose
[1:18:39] to be revealed
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; to the book
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; because this portion of the book
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; suffered
[1:18:51] with spiritual amnesia.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; The first portion did not.
[1:18:59] The first manifestation of the book did
[1:19:03] not suffer with spiritual amnesia.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; But the second portion of the book
[1:19:12] suffers with spiritual amnesia.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; So she needs
[1:19:18] her purpose to be revealed to her.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:19:26] So that's that's where we're we're we're
[1:19:28] going to be to be heading because we are
[1:19:32] living in an extremely special time.
[1:19:36] [clears throat]
[1:19:37] You know, a lot of people wish they
[1:19:39] could live in the days of the first
[1:19:42] manifestation
[1:19:43] of the word. But we understand that
[1:19:45] there is another manifestation of the
[1:19:48] word.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; There there has been prophesied to be
[1:19:52] another manifestation of the word. And
[1:19:56] we understand that we are living in the
[1:19:58] day of the second manifestation of the
[1:20:01] word. All right? There's a lot more to
[1:20:04] it than that. We're we're we're more
[1:20:06] it's it's more than living in a day of
[1:20:09] the second manifestation of the word.
[1:20:11] There's a lot more to it. But in this
[1:20:14] manifestation,
[1:20:16] he is not restricted
[1:20:20] to one office.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; he is not restricted to the office of
[1:20:27] lamb.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; He is not restricted to the office of
[1:20:32] groom
[1:20:34] because in the form that he comes in in
[1:20:37] the second manifestation,
[1:20:39] he comes in a many membered form. Yeah,
[1:20:43] beautiful
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; one body
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; but many members of that one body
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; right? So the members of that body are
[1:20:55] actually family
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; father,
[1:21:02] mother,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; husband,
[1:21:05] wife, son, daughter.
[1:21:10] Right? So it's God as a masterpiece
[1:21:14] family
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; in this manifestation.
[1:21:19] [snorts]
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; He he w he he was a family in the first
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; but not revealed
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; because you were in him,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; right? So you you were there. That's why
[1:21:31] we could say the whole the whole family
[1:21:33] of God visited Zakius's house.
[1:21:36] [laughter] You know, um you have no
[1:21:38] idea. You you don't know what it looks
[1:21:40] like. We can only go on Google and try
[1:21:42] and find something that in our mind
[1:21:44] looks like it, but we really have no
[1:21:46] idea. But but the family of God was
[1:21:49] there.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; All right. So God didn't have a family.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; He became a family.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And the reason he became a family now is
[1:22:02] because he was a family.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. because in him was attributes
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; that needed to be expressed that he
[1:22:11] desired to be expressed uh in the second
[1:22:17] manifestation
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; of himself.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Right? So the family of God is a
[1:22:24] manifestation of himself.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; All right? And this is why adoption, God
[1:22:31] doesn't adopt a foreign body into his
[1:22:34] family.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; All right? Adoption is a place of of
[1:22:40] maturity for a son of God.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; No one comes to adoption other than the
[1:22:47] family of God. All right? the no there's
[1:22:50] there's no other seed that comes to
[1:22:53] adoption just just um the family the
[1:22:57] family of God. Amen. So tonight we're
[1:23:00] going to we're we're going to follow um
[1:23:04] through with this in in Revelation 5
[1:23:07] because Revelation 5 is actually a
[1:23:13] family scene.
[1:23:17] Now, I could I I like saying this, but I
[1:23:20] don't expect you to answer. All right?
[1:23:22] Let me ask you a question. That That
[1:23:24] doesn't mean you have to answer out
[1:23:26] loud. All right? But I I like to ask
[1:23:29] questions because when I'm asking you,
[1:23:31] I've already asked myself. All right?
[1:23:34] Like,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; can can the book be in the home?
[1:23:41] What what does this scene in Luke 19
[1:23:46] look like today?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Because the book is in the home.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't matter whether we think it
[1:23:56] is or not. The book is in the home.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; This is this is something that that I
[1:24:02] don't argue about. The book is in the
[1:24:04] home. All right. But what what does it
[1:24:07] look like? In what form does it does it
[1:24:10] manifest itself and how does it act?
[1:24:15] All right. So we want to look at this in
[1:24:18] this in in the context of of Revelation
[1:24:21] 5 because Revelation 5 is actually a
[1:24:25] family scene. All right. So we'll we'll
[1:24:28] get to that soon. Um
[1:24:32] we could ask the question, you know,
[1:24:34] we've read we read Revelation 5. There
[1:24:37] was a um a book in the hand of him that
[1:24:40] sat upon the throne and no one was found
[1:24:43] worthy to open the book to read the book
[1:24:47] nor to look thereon. Um there was there
[1:24:50] was there was elders on the scene and
[1:24:54] there was a lamb on the scene. You know
[1:24:57] what what does Revelation five look like
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; today? Because when it to the bride, the
[1:25:07] opening of the seals was the greatest
[1:25:10] event
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; in the bride's life.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; It transformed her life. It she was
[1:25:16] going this way and the opening of that
[1:25:18] seals called her back the total opposite
[1:25:20] way. It it's it's it's a personal event.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Um but but can can a heavenly scene
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; become a earthly scene?
[1:25:34] Or now that the seals are open, do we
[1:25:37] just forget about it? Or or does the
[1:25:40] scene of Revelation five
[1:25:45] become a scene in our homes?
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I think it I I think it does.
[1:25:55] Okay. I believe it does. I believe that
[1:25:59] this scene is something that when we see
[1:26:03] the pattern
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; of what God has done spiritually,
[1:26:10] then it becomes something that we see
[1:26:13] happening naturally. Yeah.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; You remember when God asked Moses to
[1:26:18] build a tabernacle that he might meet
[1:26:21] them in there and and and the prophet
[1:26:23] says how how Moses saw a heavenly vision
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; and then that I don't believe he just
[1:26:31] saw the mechanics,
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; but I believe he actually saw the
[1:26:38] dynamics.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I believe he actually saw the tabernacle
[1:26:43] in action.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. working,
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; right? And when he come down, what that
[1:26:49] heavenly scene became was an earthly
[1:26:52] scene,
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; right? So, Revelation 5 is no doubt a
[1:26:57] heavenly scene.
[1:27:00] But can that scene become a natural
[1:27:04] scene in our homes
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; where the family of God is expressed in
[1:27:12] Revelation 5 1-7.
[1:27:16] Um I I I I know I know it can um because
[1:27:23] it it is in Revelation 5 is in my home.
[1:27:28] this that scene
[1:27:30] of Revelation five is actually happening
[1:27:35] in my home as we speak.
[1:27:41] And we'll get to that uh uh a a little
[1:27:44] more into that as as we as we go
[1:27:47] through. Um,
[1:27:50] I'm going to skip a couple of things
[1:27:53] here because, you know, some sometimes
[1:27:56] you don't know how people are going to
[1:27:58] respond.
[1:27:59] Um, but when you hear the response,
[1:28:02] you're you're saying, "Okay, we can I
[1:28:04] can leave this out. I can they're with
[1:28:06] me on this, you know, but some sometimes
[1:28:09] people aren't as well taught and you've
[1:28:11] kind of got to build a bit more of a
[1:28:13] platform uh before before you bring you
[1:28:16] bring the thought." So, thank you,
[1:28:18] brother.
[1:28:33] So,
[1:28:37] before something can become an earthly
[1:28:39] scene,
[1:28:41] it must be
[1:28:43] a heavenly
[1:28:45] experience. Before
[1:28:48] Revelations
[1:28:50] 5 1-7
[1:28:52] can become a scene in our home,
[1:28:56] it must be something that we experience
[1:28:59] ourself
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; first.
[1:29:03] Okay. the the example that I had of this
[1:29:05] and now I'm going back on my word was
[1:29:08] when when um Jesus uh sorry Peter was
[1:29:14] walking through gate beautiful and there
[1:29:16] was that lame man there and the the lame
[1:29:18] man said to to Peter um you know what
[1:29:22] what have you g give me something and uh
[1:29:25] Peter said silverilver and gold have I
[1:29:27] none but such as I have give I thee
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; right so the the the principle here is
[1:29:33] that we can only give what we have,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; right? We can only give what we have.
[1:29:41] And and Peter didn't have any um wealth
[1:29:44] or anything that he could give this man
[1:29:47] to help this man out. But he had
[1:29:49] something that God had given him.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Because God had given him revelation.
[1:29:56] And because God had given him
[1:29:59] revelation, he could then apply that
[1:30:02] revelation on a natural level.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; All right? So, so Peter had the
[1:30:08] experience of receiving revelation. And
[1:30:11] because he had the experience of
[1:30:14] receiving revelation, he then was also
[1:30:17] able to apply the revelation to the
[1:30:21] people around them.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; All right. So if we take that scene into
[1:30:25] Revelation 5, Revelation 5 must be a
[1:30:29] personal experience to you.
[1:30:32] And once it's a personal experience to
[1:30:35] you as a let's let's say from my point
[1:30:38] of view as a father once revelation 5 is
[1:30:41] a personal experience to me as a father
[1:30:45] then I can apply revelation 5
[1:30:49] to my home through the experience that
[1:30:55] God has given me. All right. So, so God
[1:30:59] leaves some things to our imagination,
[1:31:01] but but there's some things that he
[1:31:04] doesn't leave to our imagination, but
[1:31:07] there's some things that he gives us by
[1:31:10] revelation, and he wants us to apply
[1:31:13] those things to our natural home.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, it's a it's it's a wonderful
[1:31:21] wonderful thing. Um, I'll just skip over
[1:31:25] the scripture here, but but uh Jesus
[1:31:28] says uh sorry, brother Brandham says
[1:31:30] here, Peter said, "Silver and gold have
[1:31:33] I none, but such as I have. Give me that
[1:31:37] and take all your money. Silver and gold
[1:31:40] have I none, but such as I have give I
[1:31:43] thee in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:31:46] That's what he had. Revelation of it.
[1:31:49] Yeah,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I give I thee in the name of Jesus
[1:31:54] Christ, rise up and walk. All right. So,
[1:31:57] so Peter had the revelation of the power
[1:32:01] within the name.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And because he had the revelation of the
[1:32:04] power within the name, he he he was able
[1:32:08] to apply it to someone who was in need
[1:32:12] of that revelation. So God doesn't give
[1:32:16] us revelation just for ourselves.
[1:32:19] But God has a purpose in giving us
[1:32:23] revelation.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:26] Um,
[1:32:31] you know, sometimes
[1:32:35] sometimes I think
[1:32:37] we're in too much of a hurry
[1:32:41] to change dimensions.
[1:32:46] It's like we want to become untouchable,
[1:32:51] but God wants to become tangible.
[1:32:54] [laughter]
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; You know, we're in a hurry to get there.
[1:32:58] We're in a hurry to go up and he's
[1:33:00] coming down.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You You understand what I mean?
[1:33:03] Sometimes we can be in such a hurry to
[1:33:06] to change dimensions
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; that we can miss what God's desires are
[1:33:14] because God's desires are actually
[1:33:18] to become tangible
[1:33:21] in this dimension.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; He he his desire is to become flesh in
[1:33:29] your flesh. which means to do that
[1:33:32] you've got to wait a little while. All
[1:33:34] right? So, we're in a hurry to go up and
[1:33:37] he's coming down. It's like we pass him
[1:33:39] on the way up, you know.
[1:33:42] [laughter]
[1:33:43] But if we can understand what God
[1:33:45] desires, God's desire is to be a family.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; God's desire is to be flesh
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; in every member of his predestinated
[1:33:55] body.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; All right. So, um
[1:34:01] I just want to I I think I touched on
[1:34:04] this maybe with the youth last time. Um
[1:34:07] but I just want to just uh remind you of
[1:34:11] it again.
[1:34:13] Um
[1:34:18] if the Holy Ghost
[1:34:21] is in a father,
[1:34:24] how's the father going to act?
[1:34:27] or sorry, how's the Holy Ghost going to
[1:34:29] act?
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; I got a little picture here.
[1:34:35] If the Holy Ghost is in a mother,
[1:34:39] how's the Holy Ghost going to act?
[1:34:44] If the Holy Ghost is in a son or in a
[1:34:46] daughter, this is the this is the family
[1:34:49] of God.
[1:34:51] If God is in his family,
[1:34:55] then how is God going to act?
[1:35:00] Because this is where he is.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I know that you know that. But how does
[1:35:05] the Holy Ghost act in a husband?
[1:35:10] How does the Holy Ghost act in a father?
[1:35:13] How does the Holy Ghost act in a wife?
[1:35:17] How does the Holy Ghost act in a mother?
[1:35:19] How does the Holy Ghost act in a son?
[1:35:22] How does the Holy Ghost act in a
[1:35:24] daughter?
[1:35:26] God's
[1:35:28] God is not restricted by many things,
[1:35:31] [snorts]
[1:35:35] but he is restricted.
[1:35:40] He's restricted by the mask
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; that he's in. Yes.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; God in me as a father is restricted by
[1:35:54] the mask
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; that he's operating from.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; It would be the same if you went to a
[1:36:01] school play. There's characters in that
[1:36:04] play. Yeah.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Let's say you you you were playing you
[1:36:08] you went and saw a um uh a play at um at
[1:36:13] the beginning of the book of Joshua
[1:36:15] where Moses uh was commissioning uh
[1:36:19] Joshua and Caleb and you had a a Moses,
[1:36:23] you had a Joshua and you had a Caleb.
[1:36:26] The person in the mask mask of Moses
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; is restricted to his mask. That's right.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He cannot play the part of Joshua.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; In the mask of Moses,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; right? And it's the same with a father
[1:36:45] and a mother or a husband and a wife.
[1:36:49] God in the husband is restricted
[1:36:55] by who he is dwelling in.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; God in a husband is not going to act
[1:37:02] like a wife.
[1:37:07] That would be a perversion.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And that's what this world is,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; perverted.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; If you work in people's homes, you know,
[1:37:17] I've worked in many people's homes,
[1:37:19] worldly people's homes. You you go into
[1:37:21] a home and you have two married men.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; They're married together as husband and
[1:37:27] wife.
[1:37:28] And one of them is acting like a woman.
[1:37:33] He's speaking like a woman. That is a
[1:37:36] perversion.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; It is a wrong spirit in a wrong body.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Right? So God in a woman, God in a wife
[1:37:49] does not mean that she is now the head
[1:37:52] of the home.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Because the husband is the head of the
[1:37:58] home,
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; right? The wife can never be the head of
[1:38:02] the home if there's a husband in the
[1:38:04] home.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Why? So God God in the wife is going to
[1:38:09] act like a wife.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; God in the husband is going to act like
[1:38:14] a husband. God in a son is going to act
[1:38:17] like a son. God in a daughter is going
[1:38:20] to act like a daughter. And the reason
[1:38:22] I'm saying this is because this is
[1:38:24] actually the scene we will see in
[1:38:27] Revelation 5 that each one of these
[1:38:31] characters are in Revelation 5.
[1:38:38] So God desires to be a family, but God
[1:38:41] does not desire to be a perverted
[1:38:45] family.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh this this is something my
[1:38:49] my wife and I have have uh been learning
[1:38:55] about because we're we now have five
[1:38:58] grandchildren
[1:39:00] and we we realize
[1:39:04] that
[1:39:07] the children
[1:39:10] are the parents
[1:39:14] responsibility.
[1:39:18] Right. The the children the the my my
[1:39:21] children have children.
[1:39:24] I am my children's parents.
[1:39:27] [clears throat]
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:39:30] right? And the the commission to the
[1:39:34] parents
[1:39:35] is to teach your children.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I have a question for you. When do your
[1:39:41] children not become your children?
[1:39:44] cuz I still look at my 29year-old son as
[1:39:47] my child
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; because that is what he is though he be
[1:39:51] an adult he is my child
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; right so so if if God in the wife
[1:40:04] God as in my wife my my children's
[1:40:07] mother God in her
[1:40:10] acts as a mother
[1:40:13] to to her children. But now we have a
[1:40:17] daughter who has children.
[1:40:21] So how is my daughter as a mother, how
[1:40:26] is God in her going to act?
[1:40:31] Because she is the mother to her
[1:40:33] children.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; We are the parents to our children. They
[1:40:38] are the parents to their children. It's
[1:40:40] not our duty to teach their kids.
[1:40:45] It's our duty to teach our kids,
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; right? Because each one of our children
[1:40:51] has a purpose in our life.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And if I become the parent of a child
[1:41:00] that's not mine,
[1:41:03] then I am taking the place of someone
[1:41:05] else.
[1:41:08] Because your children have a purpose.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; They have a purpose. They have a way of
[1:41:14] molding you
[1:41:16] that nothing else does. [laughter] All
[1:41:18] right? They have a a way of bringing out
[1:41:21] the good in you that nothing else does.
[1:41:25] They have a way of bringing out the bad
[1:41:27] in you that nothing else does. All
[1:41:29] right? They they they they have a
[1:41:32] purpose. So God, my my purpose to my
[1:41:36] children is to teach my children how to
[1:41:40] bring up their children so that they can
[1:41:42] bring up their children.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; When my children got married, it doesn't
[1:41:47] mean they were no longer my
[1:41:49] responsibility.
[1:41:52] But if the opportunity arises and they
[1:41:56] need a little instruction,
[1:41:59] then that is what we are there for.
[1:42:02] Sometimes we just let him figure things
[1:42:04] out and that's just the way it has to be
[1:42:07] sometimes. All right. So God is
[1:42:10] restricted by the mask that he embodies.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Remember God was in Christ reconciling
[1:42:21] the world to himself.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; So that was God in the form of a groom.
[1:42:27] It was the it it was God, but he was
[1:42:31] restricted to that mask.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; But now he's not restricted to a mask
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; because now there are masks
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; that he has embodied himself in. There
[1:42:47] are offices
[1:42:49] that he has now taken as a result of the
[1:42:54] word becoming flesh.
[1:42:56] All right. So if we look at this uh
[1:43:01] picture here
[1:43:03] and don't don't don't look too much. Oh,
[1:43:05] there's six seal there's seven seals of
[1:43:07] shammy. Just don't just don't go there.
[1:43:09] All right. Just don't don't get caught
[1:43:11] up in the details that aren't too
[1:43:13] important at this stage. All right. If
[1:43:16] we were to to describe this scene,
[1:43:21] what would be one word
[1:43:25] that we could describe it with?
[1:43:31] The word that came to my mind was
[1:43:35] relationship.
[1:43:41] Revelation 5 is all about relationship.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; There's a relationship between the book
[1:43:49] and the hand that holds it. There's a
[1:43:52] relationship between the book and the
[1:43:54] hand that's coming to take it. There's a
[1:43:57] relationship between the hand and the
[1:44:01] hand that holds the book and the hand
[1:44:03] that's coming to take the book.
[1:44:06] This whole scene
[1:44:09] is relationship.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; What what what is one word that
[1:44:15] describes family?
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Relationship.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; You can't be a part of a family and it
[1:44:24] not you not have relationship.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; All right. So this is a uh a wonderful
[1:44:31] thing here that that we are we are
[1:44:34] looking at here. Revelation 5 is all
[1:44:37] about relationship. All right.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Um, as I've said that the lamb who is
[1:44:46] coming to take the book has a
[1:44:47] relationship with the book. It doesn't
[1:44:49] matter what you want to connect with.
[1:44:52] What does this have a point? I think it
[1:44:54] does. It doesn't matter whether you want
[1:44:56] to if you connect that the hand with the
[1:44:59] book, there's a relationship. This hand
[1:45:01] with the book, there's a relationship.
[1:45:03] this hand with this hand there's a
[1:45:05] relationship. It doesn't matter which
[1:45:08] way you want to put it.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; There's a relationship. All all these
[1:45:14] three here which are really four, but
[1:45:17] we'll get to that. But all these three
[1:45:19] are are connected have a relationship
[1:45:22] with one another.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? So we could go back oh back to to
[1:45:29] this one and see the same thing. This is
[1:45:32] all about relationship.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; All right? You You can't be one of these
[1:45:38] and not be in a relationship, right? And
[1:45:41] you can't be one of these and not be in
[1:45:44] a relationship. If you if you are one of
[1:45:47] these, you are in a relationship. And
[1:45:50] this is what I believe that God wants us
[1:45:53] to to to see is where where am I?
[1:45:59] Where am I in this in this scene? Right?
[1:46:03] Because remember the the book in Luke 4
[1:46:06] took the book and turned to where it was
[1:46:09] revealed where where it was written of
[1:46:11] him and he said, "This day this
[1:46:14] scripture is revealed." So if that's
[1:46:16] what the groom did, won't the bride be
[1:46:18] able to pick up the same book?
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Right. And turn to a page where it is
[1:46:24] written of her and saying, "This is me
[1:46:27] spiritually. this is where I am. But
[1:46:30] also naturally,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; naturally, I want my son to be able to
[1:46:37] pick up this book and be able to turn to
[1:46:40] the to Revelation 5 and see himself in
[1:46:45] this scene. I want my daughter to be
[1:46:48] able to do the same thing. I want every
[1:46:50] husband and every every wife to be able
[1:46:54] to do the same thing, to be able to turn
[1:46:57] to the same uh scripture and see
[1:47:00] themselves there. And this is an
[1:47:03] incredible thing because this is just
[1:47:05] one account, one place, Revelation 51-7.
[1:47:09] In that in that one scripture, the whole
[1:47:12] family of God can turn there and see
[1:47:15] themselves in that that those seven
[1:47:17] scriptures.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I think that's magnificent.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Magnificent.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; So, just to enter into a little bit um
[1:47:28] on this on this uh scene that we have
[1:47:32] here, the focus
[1:47:36] of the lamb, oh, sorry. The focus of the
[1:47:40] lamb
[1:47:42] is the book.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:47:49] The focus of the book is the lamb.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; We understand in this day that the lamb
[1:48:05] has taken possession of the book and
[1:48:09] revealed the book. The question is who
[1:48:12] is the book?
[1:48:19] Who was the book revealed to?
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 24, we touched on this this
[1:48:28] morning at the men's meeting, but in
[1:48:30] Genesis 24, the story of Eleazar, when
[1:48:33] he when he prayed, what was he praying
[1:48:37] for?
[1:48:42] He was praying
[1:48:44] for the mystery of Isaac.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; To be revealed.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Not He wasn't just praying for her.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Because Elea had a purpose.
[1:49:01] And that was to go and fetch
[1:49:04] call out
[1:49:07] a bride for Isaac.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; So when Isaac prayed, what he was
[1:49:12] praying for was for the mystery of Isaac
[1:49:17] to be revealed.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Now you say, well, that's that's that's
[1:49:21] a good thing for Isaac to do. You know,
[1:49:24] that's that's very that's very um
[1:49:26] honorable for Isaac to pray. But uh
[1:49:29] Eleaza to pray, but Eleazar prayed
[1:49:33] specifically
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; because he didn't want to make the
[1:49:37] choice.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; But he wanted God to reveal the choice.
[1:49:47] You remember when the prophet was about
[1:49:49] to bring forth the seals and he said,
[1:49:51] "Oh," he said, "I would have made a
[1:49:54] great mistake,
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for the angel coming down
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; and revealing the mysteries to me,
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Eleazar didn't want to make a mistake.
[1:50:06] Elea knew that there was there were many
[1:50:08] fine ladies that looked fine by the eye.
[1:50:13] They perhaps were there were many
[1:50:15] virgins that that went out to to the
[1:50:17] well,
[1:50:20] but but he didn't want to make a carnal
[1:50:23] choice.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to make a natural choice.
[1:50:27] He wanted God to reveal Isaac's other
[1:50:33] part.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; All right? Which could not be known just
[1:50:38] by looking upon. Yes,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; it had to she had to be revealed.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; It wasn't enough to go through the
[1:50:49] internet and look at look at um um uh
[1:50:52] what do you call those things? You know,
[1:50:54] your your your what's that statuses?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; It wasn't enough to get a reference
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; from her dad or from her pastor. It
[1:51:04] required a revelation.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It required a revelation. So he
[1:51:11] prayed for the mystery of Isaac to be
[1:51:15] revealed. All right. So in this scene,
[1:51:19] who's the mystery
[1:51:24] in the scene of Eleaza? Who's the
[1:51:26] mystery? That's right.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Because she came forward. She was now
[1:51:32] visible
[1:51:34] but a mystery to herself.
[1:51:37] Eza knew who she was, but she had no
[1:51:40] clue who she was.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; So, she was a mystery, but now she was a
[1:51:44] mystery revealed to Elea, but she wasn't
[1:51:48] revealed to herself.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Right? The the mysteries God does
[1:51:53] nothing but that he first reveals the
[1:51:55] mysteries to his prophets first.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. First, not only I say that all the
[1:52:03] time, first. Yes.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Secondly, he reveals the mystery to the
[1:52:09] mystery.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; It's it's the message
[1:52:21] that reveals the mystery
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; that God revealed to the messenger.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so Rebecca knew nothing
[1:52:36] about who she was. She knew nothing
[1:52:39] about that. She was a part of Isaac. I
[1:52:42] think this is beautiful.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Going off the youth meeting last night,
[1:52:46] you know, like what what did she have to
[1:52:49] do to become Isaac's bride.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; She was Isaac's bride before she knew
[1:52:56] Isaac was looking for a bride.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; It's not what we do. and what we don't
[1:53:04] do. It's who we are.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; We say, "Yeah, that's true, Brother
[1:53:14] Dan." But she had to say, "I will go."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; She did.
[1:53:19] But that that I will go didn't make her
[1:53:22] bride. The reason she said I will go is
[1:53:25] because she was bride.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; She couldn't say anything else.
[1:53:30] [applause]
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:53:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; So, who's the mystery in Revelation
[1:53:39] five?
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; It's the book
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; that is sealed.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; It's the book he died for.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; It's the book he came to redeem.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; It's the book that he is to reveal.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh do you think that we should
[1:54:03] call it uh say like what is the book or
[1:54:08] who is the book?
[1:54:13] Is the book a book or is the book a
[1:54:16] person?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Because in in Luke chapter 4, the book
[1:54:23] was revealed as more than a book,
[1:54:26] [laughter] right? They were waiting for
[1:54:28] the book to become flesh, but the book
[1:54:30] had been flesh for 31 years,
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; right? And they not known it. But and
[1:54:35] then the book takes the book and reveals
[1:54:38] himself as the book and they still
[1:54:39] didn't know he was the book.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; This is why this type of thing once once
[1:54:46] God shows you who you are and you can
[1:54:49] pick up the book and identify yourself
[1:54:51] as the book, it doesn't matter what
[1:54:53] anyone else says. You don't get offended
[1:54:56] if people don't see what you see.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't get offended that after he
[1:55:02] did what he did this day the scripture
[1:55:04] is fulfilled in your ear. They all
[1:55:06] looked at him and wi with with with
[1:55:08] stern eyes and with focused eyes and
[1:55:10] said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; But that didn't bother him.
[1:55:19] And nor will it bother us when we fully
[1:55:23] understand who we are. When our identity
[1:55:26] is made clear to us, it won't matter
[1:55:29] what family thinks. It won't matter what
[1:55:31] the Pope thinks. It won't matter what
[1:55:33] anyone else thinks.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; True. It won't even matter what your own
[1:55:39] memory thinks
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; because faith is greater
[1:55:49] than all other forms of communication
[1:55:53] within your body.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Do you always
[1:55:57] feel like bride?
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Well, if you're anything like me, you
[1:56:00] won't. You probably you're probably on
[1:56:03] the other side where you feel less like
[1:56:06] bride. You spend more time feeling less
[1:56:09] like the bride than what you do when you
[1:56:12] do feel like the bride. But but but your
[1:56:15] feelings
[1:56:17] are a form of communication.
[1:56:20] The senses of your body and your spirit
[1:56:24] are a form of communication. True. But
[1:56:28] once you have the revelation of who you
[1:56:30] are,
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter what every other form
[1:56:35] of communication wants to tell you. That
[1:56:39] faith form of communication
[1:56:43] rises up above every other form and
[1:56:46] says, "Look, you're right. I don't feel
[1:56:50] like it.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; But just because I don't feel like it
[1:56:53] doesn't mean I'm not it."
[1:56:57] When Jesus took the book, let me ask you
[1:56:59] this. How did he take it?
[1:57:03] Had he had a good day,
[1:57:06] you know, did he feel like the lamb of
[1:57:08] God?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he contended with
[1:57:14] himself.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; So, let's let's look at this. So, let's
[1:57:21] look at um who the hand is on the on the
[1:57:25] lower left side there coming to take the
[1:57:27] book.
[1:57:28] Um we can just jump down if you like to
[1:57:30] to verse to verse six. And I beheld and
[1:57:33] lo in the midst of the throne and four
[1:57:35] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[1:57:37] stood a lamb
[1:57:40] as it had been slain.
[1:57:43] All right. So we we understand we we
[1:57:46] know these things. Um this the the hand
[1:57:50] on this.
[1:57:53] So this is this is diff opposite to my
[1:57:56] one at home. The bottom button is
[1:57:58] forward. This one up is back. But this
[1:58:00] one is the other way around. So the the
[1:58:02] the lamb of God here. This is this hand
[1:58:07] is the lamb of God. And I I kind of wish
[1:58:11] that it um had some scars on it
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; because the scripture says as it had
[1:58:17] been slain.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so the picture is never
[1:58:22] right. It's ne it's never right because
[1:58:26] it the word requires revelation.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're not looking for a
[1:58:31] perfect picture. We're looking for
[1:58:33] perfect revelation.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; All right. and your your the revelation
[1:58:37] that you have of the word can add to the
[1:58:39] picture
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; and make the picture perfect.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; All right. So, um this this lamb here is
[1:58:48] the same lamb that John revealed
[1:58:53] and I saw and bear record that this is
[1:58:56] the son of God.
[1:58:58] Again the next day after John stood and
[1:59:03] the and two of his disciples looking
[1:59:05] upon Jesus as he walked he said behold
[1:59:10] the lamb of God.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; So the lamb of God is the son of God.
[1:59:17] Right?
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; All right. The lamb of God is the son of
[1:59:22] God.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; All right. the in in John 1 here, this
[1:59:27] was the lamb before he was slain. In
[1:59:30] Revelation five, it is the lamb after he
[1:59:33] had been slain. All right? So, these
[1:59:36] these two here in John 1 and Revelation
[1:59:39] 5, they're they're not they're not
[1:59:42] different people. They're the same
[1:59:44] people, but one was before he was slain
[1:59:48] and one was after he was slain. All
[1:59:51] right? So the the lamb that was the lamb
[1:59:55] the hand in the bottom left corner there
[1:59:58] we can identify that as by the word as
[2:00:01] being the son of god
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; the lamb the groom of the bride
[2:00:08] the her it's the he's the redeemer
[2:00:13] he's the word all right so now let's
[2:00:16] let's move forward and look at the hand
[2:00:20] that is um holding holding the the book.
[2:00:24] And he came, this is this is um
[2:00:27] Revelation 5:7.
[2:00:30] And he came and took the book out of the
[2:00:34] right hand of him that sat upon the
[2:00:38] throne. All right. So
[2:00:42] who whose hand is this?
[2:00:47] Because this hand has abilities.
[2:00:51] It has strengths.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; It has keeping power.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm just going to give
[2:00:59] you one quotation
[2:01:01] um for for this uh here in the fourth
[2:01:06] seal.
[2:01:07] No one could open the book. No one
[2:01:10] understood it. It was a book of
[2:01:13] redemption. And God the father spirit
[2:01:18] had it in his hand because Christ was on
[2:01:22] was at the throne of meteor the only
[2:01:26] mediator.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; All right. So we see here that this
[2:01:30] brings uh into into very clear view of
[2:01:36] who that hand was.
[2:01:40] So we see the lamb as the son, we see
[2:01:45] the hand as the father,
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; right? So
[2:01:52] um
[2:01:54] no no surprise here
[2:01:59] but the mystery in this scene is the
[2:02:03] book.
[2:02:06] The word
[2:02:08] tells us who the the the hand whose hand
[2:02:14] it is coming to take the book.
[2:02:17] The word tells us whose hand is holding
[2:02:21] the book.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; But the book is the mystery.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; All right? The groom is not the mystery.
[2:02:33] The one holding the book is not the
[2:02:36] mystery.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; The book itself
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; is a mystery that has not yet been
[2:02:44] revealed.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; All right. So
[2:02:49] remember, I say remember, I haven't
[2:02:51] mentioned it, but Genesis 2,
[2:02:57] Adam, we know,
[2:03:00] God, we know.
[2:03:02] But who is this?
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; That's in my words. It's not scripture.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; All right. It's reading in between the
[2:03:09] lines.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Adam, we know.
[2:03:13] God, we know.
[2:03:15] But who is this?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Two parts of the picture we know. One we
[2:03:23] don't.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; How? By the word.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says that God laid
[2:03:32] Adam to sleep,
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; a deep sleep, and took a part out of
[2:03:37] Adam. Right? So, we know who Adam is.
[2:03:42] We know who God is because it says in
[2:03:44] Genesis 2:22 that God bought the woman
[2:03:48] to the man,
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; but it was the woman
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; that was sealed.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; It was Rebecca
[2:03:58] who was sealed.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; It's the book
[2:04:04] that is sealed.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; So what is the book or who is the book?
[2:04:20] The mystery in Genesis 2
[2:04:25] was a part of Adam.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Remembering that Genesis is the seed
[2:04:34] chapter.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[2:04:38] is the harvest chapter.
[2:04:41] What happened happens in Genesis
[2:04:45] comes to fullness
[2:04:47] in Revelation
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; because you don't harvest an immature
[2:04:52] crop.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we have the beginning of
[2:04:57] the book, we have the end of the book.
[2:05:00] Yeah.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; So the question we could ask here
[2:05:07] was
[2:05:10] why was the book
[2:05:13] so important to the lamb?
[2:05:19] Why did
[2:05:22] his
[2:05:24] I'll just say it like this. His love for
[2:05:27] the book
[2:05:30] caused him to lay himself down.
[2:05:34] I mean, it must have been some book.
[2:05:46] field.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Now you see the seals
[2:05:49] when he was in his meteoral work back
[2:05:52] there redeeming,
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; but someday he comes forth to get this
[2:06:00] book."
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; That he's redeemed.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; You see, there's the experience.
[2:06:11] Yeah,
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; there's the experience that God wants
[2:06:14] you to have.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; He want God desires
[2:06:20] to come back
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; and break the seals
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; from your life.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; But he can't break the seals until he
[2:06:32] takes possession.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; He the seal [screaming] cannot be
[2:06:38] broken.
[2:06:40] This is all in the message. Listen to
[2:06:42] the breach. It's fabulous.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; The seal cannot be broken
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; until the groom, the lamb takes the book
[2:06:55] takes possession of the book.
[2:06:59] Once he has taken possession of the
[2:07:02] book, then he has a right
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; to break that seal.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; He has no right
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; until he has taken possession of the
[2:07:16] book.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; And this is why we are living in the day
[2:07:21] of the manifest the second manifestation
[2:07:23] of Christ. But God has come
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; and taken possession of the book.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; He's taken possession of me.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; And as a result of him taking possession
[2:07:37] of me, he has a right
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; to break the seal of my life and reveal
[2:07:43] me to me.
[2:07:46] [applause]
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:07:53] I tell you brother and sister, once you,
[2:07:55] as we say, once you see it, you can't
[2:07:57] see it.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; But let me say this, once you've
[2:08:00] experienced, you can't unexperience it.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Once you've experienced it, it becomes
[2:08:06] alive.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Once you've experienced it, it becomes
[2:08:10] alive in your home.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where I believe God wants it.
[2:08:19] Yes.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; I believe God wants Revelation 5 to be a
[2:08:23] manifestation in our home. I believe
[2:08:25] that's why he did it to us personally. I
[2:08:28] believe that's why he gave Peter the
[2:08:30] revelation of his name so he could pass
[2:08:32] on that revelation so he could apply it
[2:08:34] to people in need.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; And our children are in need.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our children need parents
[2:08:47] with experience
[2:08:50] of God.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; You know, we can Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[2:08:58] This goes on. This same quote goes on.
[2:09:01] All right. I got dot dot dot because it
[2:09:03] continues on.
[2:09:09] And all that's in the book
[2:09:13] would be him
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; for that's
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; the believer.
[2:09:23] The words in the book
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; and the word
[2:09:29] is him
[2:09:33] [snorts]
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; and all that's in that.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; He came forth for this book of
[2:09:39] redemption whose names are written on
[2:09:42] the book before the foundation of the
[2:09:44] world when he was slain as a lamb.
[2:09:49] So, you are a part of this book.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; And we're looking at it a bit more
[2:09:55] personal than that to say that you are
[2:09:57] the book
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; because you are the book.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; You absolutely are the book. But but but
[2:10:04] who is the book?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; All that's in the book would be him.
[2:10:23] Can I ask you this? Remember what I
[2:10:25] said? All right.
[2:10:27] When God
[2:10:30] When God bought Adam's wife to Adam,
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; What did he bring him?
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:44] He bought him
[2:10:47] him.
[2:10:56] [laughter]
[2:10:59] He bought Adam.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Adam.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; This is why you can identify yourself
[2:11:12] by revelation
[2:11:14] with Hebrews 13:8.
[2:11:20] Jesus Christ
[2:11:22] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Can I put that in another way?
[2:11:34] Let's go back to Eleaza
[2:11:38] and let's put it in a natural speech.
[2:11:42] What could we say about Rebecca?
[2:11:48] Because Rebecca
[2:11:51] was Isaac,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; yesterday,
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; today,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[2:11:59] [applause]
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; You mean like 24 hours? Yes. No, I mean
[2:12:05] eternity,
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; time, eternity.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; She didn't become
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Isaac's bride.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. She was
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Isaac's bride
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; always before she was conceived, before
[2:12:23] she became the the little baby um that
[2:12:26] her her mother gave suck to before in
[2:12:29] eternity.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; So, what can we say?
[2:12:37] I'll put it another way. What can you
[2:12:40] say about you?
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you know what I believe
[2:12:45] Isaac wanted Rebecca to do?
[2:12:49] He wanted her to say what he was saying
[2:12:52] by revelation, not as a parrot.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe God wants you by
[2:13:01] revelation
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; to be able to say the same thing
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; that he has already said by revelation.
[2:13:12] Amen.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to come a time
[2:13:16] where these tapes, these messages that
[2:13:18] we love are not going to be available.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be able to search it
[2:13:23] up and look up she is him.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Do you know when that's
[2:13:29] going to happen? When you're ready.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; And what I mean by ready? When God has
[2:13:37] made you ready.
[2:13:40] When God has revealed his word to you,
[2:13:44] he'll put a boycott on all message
[2:13:46] material.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; When that happens, praise the Lord.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Because that's a sign that you're in a
[2:13:53] place of maturity where you don't you
[2:13:56] don't need his voice
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; because his voice is in you.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; You by revelation can say what's on the
[2:14:05] tapes without researching it.
[2:14:11] That's good.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; That's that's really good. So So God God
[2:14:15] wants you to be able to say
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; I I am him.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we feel like, well, I
[2:14:23] don't I don't know if we should re
[2:14:25] really say that, you know. No.
[2:14:27] [clears throat] God wants you to say it.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; That I am a part of Jesus Christ who is
[2:14:33] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; I've always been a part of him. I will
[2:14:40] [screaming] always be a part of him.
[2:14:42] There's nothing I can do to make me not
[2:14:44] a part. There's nothing I can do to make
[2:14:46] me be a part. I've always been a part.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:55] My see see how we need him.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we really do. We really do.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So So
[2:15:09] who
[2:15:10] is the book?
[2:15:14] It's him.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Well, by then if it's him, that means
[2:15:18] it's not me because I'm a her,
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:24] But that's not correct, is it?
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Right. Because she is him,
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; So the the revelation of the book is
[2:15:33] that it's him.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; But it's her.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Or we could say it's him in a her form.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:15:45] God um a prophet of God will say that
[2:15:48] when God uh separated the woman from the
[2:15:52] man in Genesis 2, he took out the
[2:15:55] feminine spirit
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; and placed it in the woman,
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; right? So that that woman was him,
[2:16:05] but it was actually her. It was him in a
[2:16:10] female form.
[2:16:12] right now
[2:16:14] that Adam's bride was sealed.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; She was sealed to herself.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; She didn't have an any idea of who she
[2:16:25] was.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; She had to rely upon someone who knew
[2:16:29] her.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; She was sealed. Rebecca was sealed.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; She had no clue who she was even though
[2:16:37] she was.
[2:16:39] which shows us that you can only have
[2:16:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ if you're
[2:16:43] a part of Jesus Christ. It shows us that
[2:16:46] receiving the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:16:48] doesn't make you Jesus a part of Jesus
[2:16:50] Christ. But because you are a part of
[2:16:52] Jesus Christ, you can receive the
[2:16:54] revelation of Jesus Christ because that
[2:16:57] is what the new birth is. And the dude
[2:16:59] birth doesn't make you seed. But because
[2:17:01] you are seed, you can be reborn.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:17:09] So Eza,
[2:17:11] sorry, Isaac's bride was a mystery
[2:17:16] to herself.
[2:17:18] She was sealed.
[2:17:21] This book is sealed.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; In a in a in a natural man and woman,
[2:17:30] who is sealed?
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Naturally.
[2:17:36] That's right.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; The the woman comes sealed.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; The man doesn't.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; The woman does.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Why would God do that?
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe
[2:17:54] because he wanted Revelation 5 to become
[2:17:57] down into a home level.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe
[2:18:11] So, we can see
[2:18:13] everyone here. We can see
[2:18:17] um not on this one, the bride,
[2:18:23] the father,
[2:18:26] and the son.
[2:18:30] We can put the bride as daughter
[2:18:42] because my daughters are sealed.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; I am their father
[2:18:50] and they're waiting for their lamb.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Who is a son?
[2:18:58] See, this does away with samesex
[2:18:59] marriages. Just like that.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Just gone.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; The
[2:19:06] the lamb.
[2:19:10] I've got a big stop sign. Look.
[2:19:14] [laughter]
[2:19:17] I think I've even got it on here.
[2:19:20] No. Here. Look. [laughter]
[2:19:23] You ought to be proud of me, Don.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Now we said there was four remember mom,
[2:19:38] dad, son, daughter. All right in that in
[2:19:42] in this in this scene we have three.
[2:19:48] All right. But how we are applying
[2:19:52] this, how we will apply this over the
[2:19:54] next couple of services is that the hand
[2:19:58] that holds the book
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; is the hand of the parents.
[2:20:04] Because it's not the father alone that
[2:20:08] sits on the throne,
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; but it is the the the mother and the
[2:20:15] father
[2:20:17] sitting on the throne
[2:20:19] need meeting the needs of the home
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; together.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; All right. It is the relationship
[2:20:30] between the parents
[2:20:34] and the book,
[2:20:37] right? So, remember how we said it's all
[2:20:39] about relationship.
[2:20:41] There's a relationship between the
[2:20:43] parents
[2:20:45] and their daughter.
[2:20:48] There's a relationship between the
[2:20:50] parents
[2:20:52] and the son, the young man who is coming
[2:20:58] forward to take the book.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:21:02] There's a relationship between the the
[2:21:05] the the lamb and the book.
[2:21:10] There's a relationship
[2:21:12] between the lamb and the parents
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; of the book
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; because the book must be released.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Not
[2:21:32] not taken,
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; not stolen.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; The book must be released.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; So in and in order for the book to be
[2:21:46] released,
[2:21:49] the parents are not going to give
[2:21:53] their daughter
[2:21:55] to anyone.
[2:21:58] That's right.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Right. Because in Revelation five,
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; the book was kept
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; in the hand of him that sat upon the
[2:22:12] throne.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; We'll get into this tomorrow. I'm just
[2:22:15] using up my time. It it it was it was
[2:22:18] guarded.
[2:22:20] It was protected.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; There was a relationship
[2:22:25] between the hand and the book.
[2:22:28] Because the hand was not going to give
[2:22:30] the book to anyone,
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Right. The the hand had to release the
[2:22:38] book,
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but it sounds a
[2:22:44] little bit like a wedding scene.
[2:22:54] So there's just relationship.
[2:22:59] There's this relationship, relationship,
[2:23:02] relationship.
[2:23:04] And this is this is what I believe
[2:23:07] what God wants
[2:23:10] is for Revelation 5
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; to become manifested
[2:23:17] in the home.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; And if I understand who I am
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; as a part of the book,
[2:23:29] then I can act. I can do according to
[2:23:34] the revelation of who I am.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; The same as the the the the lamb of God
[2:23:42] 2,000 years ago knew who he was and he
[2:23:46] was able to act according to the
[2:23:49] revelation of who he was.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Now that that God makes that possible in
[2:23:58] each one of our lives.
[2:24:01] It is in each one of our lives that God
[2:24:05] wants to be manifested in. God wants to
[2:24:09] be expressed in. That's why I ask you,
[2:24:12] if God is in the parents, how is God
[2:24:16] going to act?
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; If God is in the daughter,
[2:24:23] how is the daughter going to act?
[2:24:27] If God is in the son, the boy, the male,
[2:24:31] the man, how is he going to act?
[2:24:35] One of the greatest questions that I
[2:24:37] have
[2:24:39] um
[2:24:41] with young people
[2:24:43] is
[2:24:46] how do we know
[2:24:48] if this how do I know as a as a lady as
[2:24:52] a man if this lady that I'm
[2:24:56] um interested in has the Holy Ghost.
[2:25:02] And from a lady's perspective,
[2:25:04] how do I, as a young lady, know whether
[2:25:08] this young man has the Holy Ghost or
[2:25:10] not?
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Because, you know, I'm I'm not I'm not
[2:25:16] old,
[2:25:18] but I'm old enough.
[2:25:22] And I have seen some things that you
[2:25:26] wonder how how could it end this way?
[2:25:33] How can
[2:25:35] people who claim to have the Holy Ghost
[2:25:41] end up shacking up with some other woman
[2:25:44] while they're married to their first
[2:25:47] wife and have children by it?
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; You know, the these these we we
[2:25:53] shouldn't fear it, but God is raising
[2:25:57] the standard that we live to.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. by the opening of the word. And
[2:26:04] look in in my life, I am not interested
[2:26:06] in how I lived 10 years ago.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; I am not interested in how I thought 10
[2:26:12] years ago. How what I am interested in
[2:26:14] now is living to the level of revelation
[2:26:17] that God has revealed to me personally
[2:26:21] and applying that revelation in the
[2:26:24] office that I hold as pastor etc.
[2:26:28] um uh uh
[2:26:32] father,
[2:26:34] all these things. Um God God expects us
[2:26:39] to apply his word.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Dan, you're a
[2:26:44] legalist.
[2:26:46] You mean applying the word is being a
[2:26:48] legalist? You mean doing? If I'm a
[2:26:51] legalist, God is.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Because I I I am not doing anything that
[2:26:57] he didn't do. Let me ask you this. What
[2:26:59] is legalism?
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Because often times we put things in the
[2:27:06] legalistic basket. It's not legalistic.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; You know, just just because my
[2:27:10] boundaries are a little bit tighter than
[2:27:12] Brother Adrian's boundaries doesn't make
[2:27:14] me a legalist.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:17] Because God deals with me as a sovereign
[2:27:20] father.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; God deals with me, right, with the
[2:27:24] understanding that he has of my
[2:27:27] children's weaknesses.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; It's like people say, "Well, you take
[2:27:31] your kids 10pin bowling, you know, and
[2:27:33] we do." So, and and then I I they say,
[2:27:37] "Well, we don't go 10pin bowling, so I
[2:27:39] Well, you're a legalist.
[2:27:42] Now, hang on a minute.
[2:27:44] Maybe their ch there's an influence in
[2:27:47] that place that their children that
[2:27:50] could affect their children but not
[2:27:52] yours.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Because they might take their kids ice
[2:27:57] skating and you don't and you you that
[2:27:59] then you call they call you a legalist.
[2:28:03] But maybe there's something in that
[2:28:05] arena.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; That that may affect my children. So God
[2:28:11] deals with me personally. to meet the
[2:28:14] needs of my children. So just because my
[2:28:17] boundaries are a little bit tighter than
[2:28:20] Billy Joe's doesn't make me a legalist.
[2:28:22] How do you know it's not God
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; protecting my children?
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Legalism
[2:28:34] is your approach to salvation.
[2:28:39] If you think that you can do something
[2:28:42] to help save your children,
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; you're wrong.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Because your children are under the same
[2:28:52] covenant you are.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; And if you are Jesus Christ the same
[2:28:59] yesterday, today, and forever, your
[2:29:01] children are Jesus Christ the same
[2:29:03] yesterday, today, and forever. So the
[2:29:05] same covenant that applies to you
[2:29:07] applies to your children. So my children
[2:29:10] aren't saved because I was a good
[2:29:11] parent.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; My children aren't unsaved because I'm a
[2:29:18] bad parent.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; My children are who they are because of
[2:29:25] who they are before the foundation of
[2:29:27] the world. The same reason I am.
[2:29:38] So,
[2:29:39] I'm going to call this the end
[2:29:47] and we'll continue with this
[2:29:50] uh tomorrow
[2:29:53] um in in two services. It's it's it's
[2:29:55] just such a tremendous tremendous topic
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; and [clears throat] uh some of the the
[2:30:02] things that the the responses that I
[2:30:05] have um from young sisters and young
[2:30:09] brothers a and and older ones um say man
[2:30:14] you know the older ones say man you know
[2:30:15] I wish I I knew that when I was that age
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; you know but you know what your
[2:30:23] responsibility is now is to teach your
[2:30:26] children the ways of the Lord.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; And then you know the young the young
[2:30:33] sisters the same, the young brothers the
[2:30:35] the same. You know when you can see
[2:30:37] yourself in the word
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; it makes all the difference.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; When when a sister can see herself in
[2:30:45] the word and see how he is supposed to
[2:30:49] act.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; She won't fall for anything less.
[2:30:56] You understand?
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; And it's the it's the same if a man is
[2:31:00] looking for a woman and he knows how he
[2:31:04] is supposed to act and he knows how she
[2:31:07] is supposed to act. He won't he won't he
[2:31:12] won't yoke himself with anything less.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Now you can call me a legalist.
[2:31:21] All right. But courtship is a form of
[2:31:26] yoking.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; I wish you didn't say that. I wish I
[2:31:37] didn't have to.
[2:31:41] But it's the truth
[2:31:45] that God does not want you to join
[2:31:48] yourself
[2:31:49] with something
[2:31:51] that you are not meant to be joined
[2:31:53] with.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Sorry to leave you with that, brother
[2:32:02] Elray,
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; but that's where I'm going to leave it
[2:32:05] because the slide said stop.
[2:32:12] Amen. God bless you, brother. If you'd
[2:32:13] like to come,
[2:32:21] God bless you, brother.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[2:32:30] Praise the Lord.
[2:32:32] Trust we got got the picture. Um, as as
[2:32:36] brother Daniel was was speaking, it was
[2:32:39] just so beautiful to see that
[2:32:42] if you if you look at it from that
[2:32:44] perspective, 2,000 years ago,
[2:32:47] there was a part of the book revealed.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; And in our day in Revelation 5,
[2:32:55] the revealed part
[2:32:58] was there, but he was hidden. And it
[2:33:00] didn't come on the scene until the call
[2:33:02] was made
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; because there was another part of that
[2:33:05] same book that had to be revealed. And
[2:33:07] then when the call came came forward for
[2:33:10] for the female part for the bride part
[2:33:12] of that book to be revealed then the one
[2:33:15] the part that had already been revealed
[2:33:17] the lamb part came forward and revealed
[2:33:20] the other part which is exactly what
[2:33:23] happened in the garden of Eden
[2:33:26] where God brought Eve to Adam and Adam
[2:33:30] could say this is bone of my bone and
[2:33:32] flesh of my flesh and by him saying that
[2:33:35] Eve got the revelation of who she was
[2:33:37] and he was revealing to Eve that she was
[2:33:40] him and so beautiful. Just all all these
[2:33:44] things coming together. It's just so
[2:33:46] lovely. Trust that we uh that we could
[2:33:50] absorb everything and and if if you
[2:33:52] couldn't if there was too much
[2:33:53] information, well, go back and listen to
[2:33:55] it again. I highly recommend it. Make
[2:33:58] sure you get a good night's rest tonight
[2:34:00] to come with [music]
[2:34:02] cups held held high and ready for the
[2:34:05] Lord to to feed us more. Amen. Let's
[2:34:09] just stand together. I'm going to I'm
[2:34:11] going to just pray and then I'm going to
[2:34:13] hand over to Simon um and then we can
[2:34:16] sing that song.
[2:34:18] Most wonderful and loving heavenly
[2:34:20] father.
[2:34:21] Oh Lord, I want to thank you for the
[2:34:23] word that we receive [music] tonight.
[2:34:24] Lord, I just
[2:34:28] Oh Lord, we have done nothing to deserve
[2:34:32] being the book, Lord Jesus. But
[2:34:36] Lord, it's just such a [music] beautiful
[2:34:38] thought. We are the same yesterday,
[2:34:40] today, and forever. Lord, we are part of
[2:34:42] you. We're part of that word. We were
[2:34:45] always part of the word.
[2:34:48] Hallelujah. Lord, we were always the
[2:34:52] Rebecca. who were always the
[2:34:55] predestinated wife,
[2:34:58] who were always from your perspective
[2:34:59] that virtuous sinless bride, oh God. And
[2:35:02] we are so thankful, Lord, that you
[2:35:04] revealing it to us and making it more
[2:35:06] and more real, Father. Lord, and the
[2:35:08] more we know who we are, the more we can
[2:35:12] just let your word through us be the
[2:35:15] expression in the mask that you called
[2:35:17] us, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:21] We commit the rest of the weekend to you
[2:35:23] and pray that you will just have [music]
[2:35:24] your way. God, I pray for brother
[2:35:26] Daniel. I pray that you will anoint him,
[2:35:28] that you will strengthen him, that you
[2:35:30] will protect his voice, his [music]
[2:35:32] heart, Lord Jesus, and that you will
[2:35:34] lead him down the path you want him to
[2:35:36] say to [music] us, Lord. We thank you.
[2:35:39] We give you all the glory. Ask it in the
[2:35:42] name of our Lord Jesus [music] Christ.
[2:35:44] Amen.
[2:35:46] Amen. Who I am. Oh, glorious [singing]
[2:35:49] victory.
