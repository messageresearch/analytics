slightly different place and it's exciting to see a few extra Faces tonight I know there's quite a few more that's going to be coming tomorrow morning and so forth but it's it's good to be and I you know it's uh it's good to feel the expectation and the excitement in the air and I trust that we all come with our cups how they're High I mean trust that we all come prayed up and ready to receive what God has for us this weekend I trust that especially our visitors well actually all of us I mean those that worked so hard here and those that traveled far that you're not too tired I trust you can can get absolutely everything we can and and that includes all of us out of this weekend services and I trust that that the Lord's blessings will rest upon it I know a lot of prayer has gone up and we just trust the Lord to have his way I wonder if I can ask you to just take your seats for a little while [Music] or give the musicians a little bit of a wrist you've done well it's probably a little bit of a marathon session in terms of in terms of actual song service but your practices are longer longer than this isn't it praise the Lord well I would like to say welcome to taranaki those of you who are not local but also welcome to all the taranaki people and all of us trust that the Lord will make you feel really welcome and I trust that that you come with an open heart and with all the right attitudes and the right perspectives to to come receive What the Lord Has for us amen I really trust that the Lord is going to touch each one of us that the Lord is going to meet us where we're at I mean we're in different places in our walks and different places in our maturity and and all of that but may God meet each one of us exactly where we're at Hallelujah so we just want to welcome you I also want to give a special welcome I know brother Andrew wise and the group there in Nelson they are streaming these services from church and they're going to be with us in spirit this weekend so I would like to welcome them also and I trust that that it will be a blessing to you likewise also just want to take a moment I was just really blown away when I walked in here today and saw what what the brothers and sisters have done and thank you so much for all the effort that has gone into getting it all ready and beautiful and and I just really appreciate each one of you God bless you richly and and my prayer for you for this weekend is May you not be too tired to receive the word amen may the Lord bless you amen yes now these Services praise the Lord you can give it a few keys [Laughter] praise the lord well what you might not know is that well some of you know I know but um these Services have been coming for quite a long time I know last year April I thought was it 2020 already I can't remember we were going to have a convention and it turned out to be a virtual convention but even before that brother Marcus and I had been speaking about him coming and brother Marcus promised me that in his own words as soon as sister Adin allows him to come he will come so at some point I contacted him earlier this year and said to him brother Marcus sister I didn't says you can come so praise the Lord he's uh he's here and we thank for that sister then let him to come so it's good it's good to be here um I would like to go over a few uh practical things and and I will apologize now and not again hopefully not again um but I will probably repeat some of these things tomorrow tomorrow evening when the um when when a lot of the other people are here um so I'm sure some of you have figured that out but we've already had a bunch of people ask the questions where the bathrooms are or toilets or restrooms whatever you prefer to call it so when you come in the glass doors here in the foyer area on your right hand side you will find the the toilets there so that's where you'll find them then for the mothers there's a cry room so if you just go down the passage here again in the glass doors and turn left there's a there's a cry room there obviously we're asking that only mothers with with small kids make use of that but that's for your availability there there's also a screen there where the services will be streamed live all the time so you trust that that will be a blessing to you then one other thing that we always have to do is in case of an emergency these evacuation or if evacuation is required the assembly point is the netball courts most of you would have seen them as you came past but they just next to the road so out here turn right and go towards the net netball courts so that's the assembly point if that should be needed then we have a fire Warden here and you would have seen him already with Simon wave no everyone needs to see you Simon okay right so his Simon is the fire warden so if there's a fire just look what he does and follow him right okay and then we also have a medical officer she's family of the firewood by the way and so if you have any need there then just see sister Julie for those things um also and I know this probably is not necessary to say but but you know I would like to ask these little steps uh they've just got a very awkward kind of inclination so be careful when you use the steps that you that you don't fall so just use them carefully if you are not so confident use the steps at the end so you can you can happily use either of them um then I would like to also ask please don't wander around on the schoolyards we have access to the hall and the entrance to the hall and obviously you're welcome to use the parking area but let's stay away from everything else it's not and disturb anything here and let's just come in have our time here worship stay as long as you like but when we go let's just go and leave everything understood you if you can and then I'm sure by now the program is fairly clear for everyone but if there's any uncertainties around that there's a copy of the program on that board there just behind the the technician brothers and there's also another copy of it on the glass doors where you where you come in so if you're uncertain about service times over the weekend that's where you'll find it and then again brother Simon but you know who he is now if if you need if you want to do any song items there's probably still a few spots open is there yes there's a few spots open so if if anyone still wants to do song items please see brother Simon for that um then anything in the in the church here anything that we can do to make you more comfortable any any need that you have here anything please see one of the deacon Brothers you would have met two of them as you came in the the front door but there's another one here by the mark and then brother John and Brother Bruce at the back so if if you need anything if you don't have your Bible with you anything like that um please go see our Deacon brothers and they will make you feel welcome and so forth and then any other practical Arrangements anything that's that's going wrong or anything like that any any anything you will need to blame on someone see Brothers right it's all his fault can you just raise your hand so everyone sees who you are okay praise the Lord has been project managing all of this and done a wonderful job just really appreciate that and then the other thing that I don't know there's so many things in the foyer that that you could have possibly missed that there's one and sorry I'm going to be naughty now there's one particular thing in the foyer that you must please not miss right and there's on a table I'm kind of looking at it straight there there's a little trophy that's got a name on of a young lady that's sitting here tonight because she's in this High School so please look at the trophy but that's not what I wanted to say right there's a table there with message material that you can that's free to take for anyone so feel free to help yourself so just in that foyer area there there's there's um there's a few things that I think quite a few people would want and there's limited numbers so be quick if you wanted I won't give a give that away too much um then practical things um so meals we we're providing lunch and a supper and the supper will be slightly more substantial than than just the coffee and cake um so it should should be able to fill the little spot you uh you might have after the service and the meals will be at the War Memorial Hall the War Memorial Hall is in Miranda Street or between Miranda Street and Portia Street um if if you need directions they just ask any of the locals there we're obviously all very familiar with with that so um suppers or food will be served there and then another really important practical thing is um if I remember and if we remember the idea is that we will say grace over the food here before we leave um and the reason for that is that as you get to the War Memorial Hall please go directly get your food and you can duck in so long um so that you um so so really just a bit of pressure on the number of comfortable seats available they for us to sit and eat so that as you get there have your food and then if when you see the the tables are running out of spaces then you can maybe just move on a little bit to give another wave of people an opportunity to sit at the tables obviously that won't be an issue tonight but maybe towards Sunday that that will become a little bit of an issue there so if you understand that I'll appreciate that and then also at the War Memorial Hall the big basketball courts and and Stadium area is available for recreation so if any of the young ones want to kick a ball they obviously not doing service but between services and after Services um then feel free to to use that we have that we have access to that and then um Kick our time at the War Memorial Hall we'll we'll kind of play it by ear but we obviously want to get a rest also so that we can get maximum out of the services so we'll leave it to the the deacons to Grumble at you when it's time for you to leave but we're just kind of letting you know that brother John is pointing at Brother Bruce Brother Bruce Will Grumble when it's time for you to leave but yeah at some point we'll we'll probably close that up just in the services here I want to say we'll we'll uh we'll sing couple of songs afterwards and then this mess Simon so just just take note of that and then those of you who want to stay and keep on worshiping feel free to do that you know we'll say grace over the food dismiss and then then you can keep on singing not quite as long as you want to but quite long we'll try not to to take food into the gymnasium as far as possible whether permitting will trust trust that that works here um then there's something else I would like to share can you put that PowerPoint on for me Justin um so I'm sorry to to do this to you and please forgive me I hope this doesn't frustrate you upsake you but there's a there's a mission um opportunity that I want to share with you and I want to ask while we have visitors here over this weekend if the Lord places on your heart to support this financially we would be appreciative of that obviously the whole point is not to leave here to to give us money for something but this is a worthy call so when um I'll just give you a little bit of background and then just show you a few pictures so brother petio many of you have met him uh very dedicated lovely humble brother from from Vanuatu and he he had a beautiful Church um and I can't remember the island but there was a volcano on that island and they had to evacuate the whole island a few years ago and his church basically dispersed some of the church went with him to Santo another the island to a town called lugenville and they have they are at the moment gathering in his home and in in quite uncomfortable circumstances and they are too many people really for for the home and so on and he's started building a little church and he needs um I think memory serves me right still around 12 000 New Zealand if if I can remember right um dollars to to finish this church building so what I would like to ask and maybe I'll just show you the pictures first so these uh brother pith Hill and brother Adrian when we were there recently so you can see how far they are with the place already there's just a few pictures of what it looks like so far you'll see I've put a poster up there by the by the table with the message material also so as you can see a really small little little place um but um that would be sufficient for them so what I would like to ask is if anyone feel to support this can you please I need to explain this now um can you please we've got an offering Boxley at the back but can you maybe just give us cash in an envelope and write on the Vanuatu if if you do that and just to answer that question before you ask it the reason why we're asking cash is with the charity rules that have come in over the last few years we are limited to how much money we can spend on overseas work and especially religious Mission work so we we have found and and I won't share the detail of that right now but we found a way to get the money there if we get it in cash now of course we'll we'll be very responsible with that money it will be recorded properly and we'll deal with it as as detailed as as we can and have all the recording of that money and so forth but it's just not going to officially go through the charity what that does mean is that we won't be issuing you with a receipt for that money to claim from the ird because it's not going through a charity so I trust that's that's clear and I trust that the the motive and the purpose for that is also clear for you so if you would like to support this that would be that would be really appreciated these Saints the wonderful Saints believing the same message we do with the depth of understanding of the message and just a just a lovely spirit and everything I can highly recommend them so if you are if the Lord is tugging on your heart to support it in any way we will really appreciate that praise the Lord so I think that's um probably everything I needed to say anything that I forgot anyone any questions no praise the Lord I don't want to take unnecessary time while the time flies real quick so then of course I want to welcome brother Marcus very special friend and a very special brother and just really looking forward to how the Lord is going to use the gift in our brother and we've had we've had magnificent Fellowship over the last day or so and just really really appreciate you my brother and be free speak about the little places on your heart and just have your Liberty my brother so what we're going to do now is I'm going to hand back to brother Simon with a song and then we'll do the song items and then after that one more song and we'll go to the uh to the preaching so let's see Nikki would be born I'm not sure what what number that is that you would be born in the manger of my heart did I pick a song that we don't know three five two thank you Joseph I heard the voice [Laughter] [Music] they stand together and sing that let your word be born in the manger of my heart foreign let you know [Music] it's good to be here it's nice just to have a little family here to sing too in this song is one that I trusted blesses you it's it's one of the few songs that the Lord ever gave me so it's about 30 years old but it means as much to me today as it did when the lord gave it to me so I trusted the blessing foreign [Music] until dear Lord in our hearts and lives whenever no never alone [Music] we have for faith in you you've never ever failed us though sometimes [Music] [Music] you pick us up and hold us in your River [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] for we have confidence in you I pray that I do make sure [Music] to revealing what you've shown to me Jesus your life makes life easy to say fine thank you for your gift to me [Music] thank you for your gift to me dear Lord thank you for your gift to me the greatest gift you gave to me dear Lord was the gift of Calvary I pray that I too May shed your light on others revealing what you've shown to me [Music] Jesus your light makes life easy to say bye thank you for your gift to me thank you for your gift to me dear Lord thank you for your gift to me the greatest gift you gave to me dear Lord [Music] foreign [Applause] it was a tiny little stable

word be born an amazing of my heart what music is Softly playing a little about our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for the start of this Services of these meetings and Lord may be the end of the year father and the beginning of the new year with a Clear Vision as for me and my house we want to serve the Lord fathers being speak to us you know your humble servant we need you father we can talk

their comfort be there be be their help in that situation father we help them bless them and care for them Father so we lay everything into your hands ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you amen thank you very much for the musicians and while we while we're standing let's open the word of the Lord wishing you God's blessing thank you very much for the wonderful songs in the Book of Matthew Matthew 21 verse 1. Matthew 21 1. and when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come to Bethpage unto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus two disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straight away you would find a donkey tight and a cold with her lose them and bring them unto me and if any man say art unto you you shall say the Lord has need of them and straight away he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell you the daughter of Zion behold that King cometh unto thee Meek and sitting upon a donkey and a cold full of a donkey and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated now I'll greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and bring greetings from my pastor by the road World in Germany and from my family and from different brothers and sisters that know you very very well and it's a great honor for me to be here for this services for the end of the year and thank brother uh array for the nice invitation and it seems to be of the Lord normally my pastor is very keen about being the whole church at home when there is a New Year's Eve and so forth but this time he said directly it's fine for you to go and well we will lay everything into God's hands and we really trust that we God speak to us okay and as the brother said we're waiting for some people still to come that is very very perfect but I always say even if we are not too many please don't feel sorry for yourself okay so we really want that our father talks to us is it fine for you so so uh I I had a quite a number of sermons and thoughts I always prepared them new even if the title is a little bit always the same or nearly the same but almost take the time and I believe that there is some titles and some sermons before us that is helping you on on your way everybody has a certain specialty and God gave me a certain way of approach to his word and approach to his people and let me be myself if that is fine for you okay I realize I got all the services and uh because they said that man is in the airplane for just for two days to come and two days to go so don't let him sit around though I know he's very very able ministers not only but the array but brother brother Adrian and uh maybe different others so I don't know all of you but I know that there is quite a capacity and the snipers are already there so I know I cannot just preach Jesus loves you and Jesus understands and some denominational thing that will not work here I got a couple of years ago I got really some quotes of brother Adrian about the theophany really really blessed me it was really wonderful inside and and was wonderful to how we worked together and we share visions and and that was just wonderful and yes I thank you for the for the Friendship to brother Airway and um to the brother Adrian different ones and I assure that we received the Esau and I don't know brother Malcolm will come good friends may the Lord richly bless all of them the bride in New Zealand and my brothers and sisters uh I mean this is this is an International Convention it's it's kiwis and South Africans you got it okay and as we heard that that sister Arden she she had made some good decisions and we heard already soon there will be no any more smoker in in New Zealand so somebody is thinking twice about certain things and we we thank God for this we pray for the authorities this should be done that way we should be thankful to live in a country of freedom of Liberty don't be too critical they could be different last year exactly at that time I was preaching in the Ukraine and we were just thinking about having a convention for next year but these plans are already history you know so if we can gather if we can happy be free let's be thankful to God and say Lord this is a day this is my day today I don't know what tomorrow holds but I'm thankful for today okay blessed be the name of the Lord whenever I I I I will go into certain subjects um uh be pleased to understand tomorrow between the two service I will be just fast eating a little bit and then prepare for the next service but anyhow you can always ask me okay for brother Marcus did you mean this and that please understand when we are when we are dealing with a subject uh in 90 minutes you can never bring the whole balance in all things nobody can do that okay so you cannot bring every aspect okay nobody can do that it takes quite a while I have quite some services but I found that it is not enough to bring a balance in all things sometimes you're just bringing one point we try to be as balanced as possible because I realized we speak to many many people and we are we are not we don't want to be the author of confusion we want to be the author of of the help of people a sound Doctrine in a sound mind but sometimes sometimes certain things could be misunderstood and you let me know okay you please let me know brother Marcus do you mean exactly this or that I'm very happy for this because we talk to so much to too much people and we as ministers we we should never forget that one day we stand before the Lord we cannot preach our opinions for forget it if you can the time is over for preaching our opinions I mean we have to have the mind of God God has an opinion and as I always said that there's a quote that brother Brahm said you have to protect this message we protect it by leaving our own interpretations out if not nobody will know what is now Marcus perfect a personal uh a stand whenever I say something that the prophet never said that way I said this is no Marcus and you can reject it without having bad feelings about that but don't reject the message okay but you can reject my ideas about certain things for sure because I could come back next year I have another idea about the same subject so so and therefore we learn certain things in life to never make people under pressure and blessed be the name of the Lord let me just directly start okay do you feel well always felt all is well with you I feel it's a good atmosphere for the first day already I think for the musicians for the song leader for you you can lean back uh uh and and just Rejoice okay because because um many of you will not know me um just by name maybe but um brother the message that we believe does not come from America it comes from the presence of God that's what we have to understand it's not an American message that's our father talking to us the message that we believe is not a denomination why should we become denominational the message that we believe is not a cult why should I become cultish amen we see these things coming up a little bit with the Next Generation there's a lot of nonsense coming up in what we call the message frame I mean but the message will never be a denomination the message will never be a sect why should I be sectarian amen what is the message then the message is not an information the message is not a religion amen the message is our father talking to us I mean we are we are and I say this boldly but humbly at the same time we are the only religion in the world which is not a religion we're the only ones who have a father every other religions Buddha six and whatever it's fine people respect them let them be who they are but it's just a code of ethics is just a a way of life it's just a following some rules not more we have a father look all Christianity look at all the baptism whatever that's fine I will not take away salvation from for many of these people but they don't have a father they don't have a bright room they don't have a they don't have a they don't have an uh uh when your creator becomes your father they have many times a Bible and a code of ethics they have a portion of the Holy Spirit but it doesn't have to they don't have the person of the Holy Spirit they don't have the person because they don't have elieza who led the bride to that person can you say Amen we are not better but we're different you cannot compare with any denomination because we are not a denomination amen we don't have the best singers we don't have uh we don't have Jimmy swaggarts I'm gonna sing it again brother foreign we don't have the most Miracles there's people who have there's groups and denominations who have more miracles than us we don't have the most anointed people we don't have even the most numbers of people so you say if if we don't have deals in this what do we have we have thus say as the Lord amen and our many say I'm preached you into very very small group I said hey don't have don't feel don't feel now don't feel uh sorry for yourself because we are 10 people here that feel privileged if you're privileged that you're invited to the Feast of the king so we understand that the Bible became a new book through the opening of the word amen for 2000 years we never understood God we tried everything we tried we tried churchianism it never worked we tried a a legalism and it never worked we tried reformation and it never worked we even tried Pentecostalism but it never worked but the Bible says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God will be revealed not Mysteries Schofield had already Mysteries but the mystery is God is opening his heart who he is how he feels how how what's in the back part of his Minds how he is a father and brother Abraham preaches the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and if you see the nature of your father you can find out that is a Christian because he's like his father everybody can be legalistic every Muslim can be legalistic I mean to have long hair and a long dress is part of our message but it's not the message every Muslim can have long hair and long dresses and sometimes we will see it in the next Services sometimes you can have long hair long dress and long face it's not very very helpful huh so we see that did I say it always like this the message is the heart of the Bible amen now here's brother Branham and and and and brother when he was a simple man and and uh he was around people that went to uh to Bible schools and they could speak Latin and Greek and Hebrew and they told brother Brian and brother Brahm you don't know your Bible very well and we know what brother Brandon says he said maybe I don't know well very well the Bible but I know the author very well and I mean I come from a Pentecostal background for us okay know the author in the in the in the power of his resurrection let the signs and wonders come in we were a little bit that way but what did he say he said my brother if if I'm writing a book Marcus Becker writes a book you will never understand the book but if you know who I am if you know my nature if you know my heart then you understand my book you understand everybody can quote the Bible but you must understand the mind of God and now you understand the book you can read between the lines but it's the same which is in the lines but it makes sense to what is in the lines can you say Amen so we see that that that uh um that that we have here Jesus and uh it was time for the king to come and I would like the brothers if you help me a little bit with the with the first picture and I would just you know my Ministry is always liking to visualize it a little bit we have a lot of young people here and sometimes it becomes too I wouldn't call the world boring but it becomes a little bit boring foreign becomes boring okay and these pictures give you a little interpreter interpretation okay because okay so so the time came that that that that that Jesus came down from that mound of olives this is the the view to Mount of Olives and when he appeared on that Mount of Olives brother random takes that picture and he preaches the message what is the attraction on the mountain and he says on that mountain appeared Jesus on a white donkey and the question is how could brother Brandon know that it was a white donkey I mean he was a seer he could see things therefore he could see what happened in the Garden of Eden it's not clear by the Bible but the Seer sees the scenery and he then takes it back to the Bible said here it is true we had a testimony about the brother biscuit gave us one time and and he said they had a brother I think it was brother suswick and he was a hidden smoker and people didn't know that he was a hidden smoker and uh but on the camp he he was taking care of the horses and uh what happened is uh Whitey was taking care of these horses he was secretly smoking and the church didn't know but he and everybody thought he's just a kind brother but he had his second second thought about that so he was smoking secretly and brother Sussman says I came back to that camp and I arranged something in the kitchen and brother Brennan was laying like this in his tent he said Hey Brother Sussman for how long are you a Believer he said oh brother answer many many years I go to church and it was some minutes past past away your past and brother man laying there he said brother Sussman but I think brother Fred he says uh did you ever smoke when you were an unbeliever and he said yes and he just continued to work in the kitchen and after some minutes brother Brian just shouted to him and said brother brother brother brother brother brother Fred when did you stop smoking and brother Fred said right now and he said this he said he knew that brother Brahm saw him but you see God is a gentleman God is correcting us but he's never hurting our feelings but but but he saw him so so so how much can we see how how he saw the scenery now Jesus was sending his disciple to a to a uh to some donkeys I know the the Bible says another expression but I'm a German with my accent anyhow and if if I'm pronouncing this in the wrong way then we have a then we have a message for this evening okay then then I will be on YouTube tomorrow okay so let's call it a donkey okay I'm happy that I feel already you have that kind of humor I'm I'm I'm not a clown not at all but but humor breaks the ice you know but humor makes people comfortable and I mean this is the house of God you feel home exactly so so what happens is he send them to these donkeys and Jesus knows exactly where they are and he says and if you will ask about his donkeys he said the Lord is in need of them so you must understand that for the world you are nothing else than a donkey with those long hair and somebody else what are you doing for the end of the year that you say I go to church okay another donkey we have party but these donkeys they are just listening and somebody's just shouting at them and whatever but it's not not important what the world thinks about you it's so important that you find your place that you are proud of yourself of Who You Are standing for it so they find these donkeys and they are arising on the summit of Mount of Olives and here they were standing and brother Abraham said what happened on on on on on on Mount of Olives he said history was made prophecy was fulfilled and when he was just writing down Meek and humble from that Mount of Olives he he there was a crowd waiting for him and brother Brian said this he said they were all in expectation he said some were for him some mostly most they were against him but some were in between and they were just waiting for him to come down and I always tell the question if you want to if you want to preach doctrinally you must be keeping a balance if not you end up in a dead end and it's so hard for a preacher to to to admit mistakes and it's so hard sometimes for a church to admit mistakes or to forget forgive mistakes of a minister because I always say this now aren't that donkey who was sitting on that donkey the lamb or the lion said both at the same time I mean because the prophecy says behold daughter signed your king coming down on a donkey at the same time he was the lamp taking away the sins of the world so pay attention when we when when we're nailing certain things down the deeper you clinch down a nail the more you have to make effort to remove that same nail if you clinch it down too deep because we grow in Revelation and these people and why he is coming down the Bible says in uh second Moses in in Exodus 13 verse 13 I'm just quoting it in myself he says you have to kill the firstborn of of of um um of a donkey if you kill it and if you don't kill it you have to take a lamp instead as a sacrifice for the Donkey now how could these people stand there and and just shout Hosanna who comes in the name of the Lord because they could now take a Biblical picture in the modern events and could see this is scripture fulfilled because now here's a donkey sitting or a lamb sitting on a donkey and they could make it out he said this must be the Redeemer for Jerusalem amen they were not just sitting and ah I'm not talking now about I'm not talking about emotionalism come on let's a little bit I mean Jimmy Swagger can do this shout a little bit of a noise I want to hear it must be how you call it uh stimulation by revelation and you can be sitting there very very quiet and still you are stimulated anointing and noise is a difference because when Jesus was sitting down to preach these noble words uh uh on Mount of of of Beatitudes but remember him said he was sitting down but noble words proceeded out of his mouth and he was fully anointed but he was not that type of charismatic preachers now come on say your name amen must our heart must say Amen but when they saw it on the other hand side they were not just standing there and said oh wow that's the Messiah that's great that's deep man we never heard it like this that's tremendous I mean it's they took their their clothes and throw it on the floor and said praise me to God blessed be the who is coming in the name of the Lords some that we have young people and I would certainly go in the next Services about that fact that Pentecostal searching emotionalism and sometime our people they say we don't want emotionless we want the words and they think they are better but some of the people they don't search the word they search the kick you must preach something that nobody else preached before that way in a sense that even brother Branham ever said it and then people say wow that was the word no that was the kick that we got something special very special amen they're in the same category because the words will change us the rest is just enthusiasm about the kick amen sometimes young people come and they say brother Marcus man we come from a convention and we heard things I mean I mean that was tremendous it was deep and then I say okay what did you understand is it nothing and then they say and and he said things that we never heard before I said yes because you never heard it before because brother Brian never said it therefore you never heard it before amen but we're not called to just impress people and then everybody claps on our shoulder and said my as a mighty man it was tremendous it was tremendous we want people that say I I have a change in my life and changes I I have a father and now I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm transformed exactly in that image can you say Amen so so so they were just enthused about that because they find the time in which they were living this is the view now from the Mount of Olives down to Jerusalem the only problem is the building okay in the time of Jesus it was the time where the the Temple of Solomon was there and we are looking now straight west from the Mount of Olives to the temple in Jerusalem straight west and brother Ryan said oh I have it in mind that brother Brian said it that way he said when you open the door of the temple you could see even the curtain of the high of the holies the holies you go straight west right now blessed be the name of the Lord so he came down on that donkey and went directly to his Temple so there is a meaning behind it because what happened is this brother Remy said uh the coming of Christ of the son of man is like is going from the East to the West and he says like the sun traveled from the East to the West he said the messenger traveled from the East to the West and it went over three seas Mediterranean Sea Atlantic Ocean or art channeled to England and the Atlantic Ocean and brother Brahm said justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost but that was not the end because brother Branham was born on the east coast of America when you see the picture of the pillar of fire then then it was made by a Kodak Eastman film the woman the witch that could determine the date of birth of brother Ibraham he said you are you're you're born under a certain sign there's a star there's a light following you what did she say she said your success will be in the West and brother man Remembered in in the message sirs is this the time he said it's now time to go to the West amen that which that that Medium said your success will be in the west all these Ministry brother Brian was in the east 500 000 people in in in in Bombay India so much people in Durban South Africa we would say this is Success this is great ministry but what is great in the eyes of man is sometimes small in God's eyes and what is small in men's eyes is great in God's eyes because all these people who were healed in Durban if they didn't give their heart to the Lord they are all dead amen but the opening of the word of the word is something Eternal for the bride it's the minority of quantity but it's bringing the whole church up Hallelujah so what happens is this that we find out that the Garden of Eden was in the area of ham I think even brother Ben wasn't wasn't wasn't very clear not North North North North Africa up to uh uh a Tigris river Euphrates River that's what the Bible says in that area of what we call the near East according to Jewish tradition the gates of the Garden of Eden was exactly where the Temple Mount is the Great it's the stone what they said the stone between uh where Revelation comes from the Eternal for the world therefore it has a higher signification when Jesus said amen your name is Peter and Upon This Rock amen I will build my church because according to Jewish tradition exactly where the temple Dome is right now that is the rock where Revelation where eternity or where Heaven meets with the Earth for them it is a local place for us it's a place in our hearts blessed be the name of the Lord but here's what happens he said he when when when when when Cain left the Garden of Eden he went East that's what the Bible says and it's exactly so the Bible is right because because uh the first civilization was China in the east and the Bible says this Cain left the presence of the Lord and the prophet said that is the proof that the presence of God was not only in heaven but it was on Earth already because how can you leave the presence of God if the presence of God is not there it was exactly at the altar is what exactly at the gate at the door and brother Brian said there he made his mistake there is where people make their mistakes when things are going wrong they are leaving the church they stay home they want to stream a little bit here in a stream a little bit there and this and this is the time where you should come into the house of the Lords when everything goes wrong when you did the biggest mistakes in your life that's the time to talk to your father that is where people again make that big mistake so we see there is a progression there is a far justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Brian said makes way for the person of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord that is where Pentecost will have their big problems so here we see Jesus coming and and and and uh brother Branham in the message what is the attraction on the mountain he is now projecting what happened on Mount of Olives he's projecting in our time he shows a parallel he says oh there will be a true former and letter reign in the last days upon that little group that come with him on this little donkey low and humble no denomination and I always say this no denomination in the message or outside of the message crying Hosanna to the king that comes in the name of the Lord what's the matter today what is the attraction on the mount what does he speak about Mount sunset what happened on Mount Sun said the king came down the words came down the light came down amen can you say Amen amen I hope that we don't have just a picture of the cloud in our in our in our bedroom in our in our dining room and don't know what it is it's the coming of Christ it's Revelation chapter 10 one fulfilled a greater than Solomon is here why should I go back to another age if the king of all Kings is here why should I have Nostalgia about Pentecostalism whatever if we are in living a time like never before I always tell the young people I said look brother Branham said it like this he said God shows first in the heavens what he's doing on Earth so please don't waste your time trying to find your theophany in the in in in that Circle because there's already too many people trying to find that theophany in it it's like it's like sometime and you forgive me that kind of humor sometimes people believe in in in rebirth I was another person uh born thousands of years ago and you can bring them into any kind of of conditions you can use hypnosis and under hypnosis they reveal what type of person they were and they were always Cleopatra [Laughter] I was Julius Caesar I was this and I was dead and nobody was a farmer and and and you understand people want to be special and people wanna and but one thing is true I mean maybe you find your theophany right in it we will deal in the next days about that but one thing is sure now and now brother Ben never understood that picture but you have to understand according to the message we have this is a double picture okay rainbow means that means brother Brandon was a star in the night he was the seventh Church age Angel and the star is shining in the night but there was a changing of dispensation there was a changing of ministry there was a changing of time so that brother Branham started 1964 what does he say shalom good morning church what does he say the night is over good morning in Finnish salaam the night is over good morning what does it mean the night is over and brother Birmingham said this there's a man who can turn on the light he said he said the the son is the king of all lights the night is over who appears the king of all Kings the son himself the church is just a reflection it's just like the Moon so we don't live in the darkness today we live in in in in in the day of our light and you turn the picture to the right and you find out Hoffman's head of Christ what does it mean God shows in the heaven what he does on Earth there is a church now who received their head their Capstone their headstone the church is not with without leadership anymore can you say Amen it's a special time it's it went sometimes you know I was in the world for many many years all my life we were not Christians at that time I showed you different time I was a Michael Jackson fan I could dance like Michael J I could make the the moon walk but I promised my family not to do it behind the pulpit okay but I could do that really in discotheque and whatever and Mr Robot and we but this was it was our time I know that I'm repeating myself but but let me just talk a little bit from heart to heart yeah I'm I'm I was I was smaller like all the girls in my class for many many years since Omar you I was smaller and just a little teeny boy which is okay God allowed these things and I was fan of of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and I remember one time I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger I think it was Conan and and he was just using his breast muscle so so I so I started bodybuilding foreign like this I know that I'm repeating myself because I always say he always comes in my mind without preparing myself as you understand I'm always preaching without notes I have my preparation with the things all the rest is just in between what God puts on my heart okay but you don't have to that's my way of preaching I always say this everything that you see here was here true honest honest it's just it's just a changing of dispensation foreign so therefore young boy you can make bodybuilding but don't invest too much time in it because you end up like this definitely so okay so I remember I I I'm a bodybuilding and I went before the mirror and nothing moved but I found out as a young person already exactly what brother Brahman says he says he says the natural types of spiritual if you want to have muscles you cannot eat McDonald's you need a steak and if I do a favor to brother to brother areas that you need a keto steak [Laughter] no matter what stake if you want to have muscles you cannot eat McDonald's if you want to have spiritual muscles you cannot eat Facebook you cannot eat Harry Potter and what you need is spiritual food in due season to have a real muscle man on the inside brother man said uh faith has hair on his chest I mean I remember I was in the U.S and I said a face has hair on his breast and then the brother said we understand you are a German but please use the right kind of words yeah I would do no problem but he says have to have hair on his chest that means you must eat some spiritual food so that muscles can grow so we see that that if I see the next one so we see it's a special time that we live I mean it's a time of of what we call the bride age it's not an eighth age we don't have eight Church ages but what happens the heads set himself upon the body that means the Capstone set himself upon the church there's no Gap so we are in the seventh churches which is the loudest sea in church age but we are not in darkness we're not blind we are not wretched because we're in bright age part of laodice he has no contradiction amen is look at this here's brother Brian he explains himself he says now friends I believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever I believe he's just as able this afternoon to cause in his building a and look at the word a paradox because that he promised it would happen and how much more has he promised how much more is it leaving in the Bible to this very age that we are living the Ephesian age of the church ages we got seven church and we are promised that at the loud is here Church age there would be another Ephesian aha exactly where brother Graham says it Lord now you put on your spiritual jacket brother blame him not never said we wouldn't have another Ephesus because Ephesus is is aim and relaxed but we will have an Ephesian there's a difference and our brother Mark is what is the difference Ephesians we read for every marriage we read Ephesians I think chapter five husbands love your wife amen because a type is a mystery it's a secret says Paul but you type it on the church and on Christ so what is that time of if Ephesians it's a marriage between the invisible bride room and the and and or the Heavenly bright when the Earthly bright the church gets her head it's a marriage time it's a time like never before therefore God showed the Hoffman's head of Christ and he does it in the air to show that's what I'm doing right now but it's not a public show it is individual it's for you it's for those who wait for his coming can you say Amen so we see that if I continue in that way that when the ministry of brother Branham started you have to understand that brother Brahm was like David all of Israel they were afraid of Goliath but when David came and had that Revelation and he slew Goliath that the Bible says all Israel now start to to to to to to have Warfare against the Philistines and the ministry of brother Branham comes and here is somebody who cannot pronounce his English therefore please when you read the message you must read it with your hearts brother Brahms sometimes was mixing words and mixing sentences I think on one time I would I try to check it out but he said Berlin is the capital of Switzerland something like this I mean I will not repeat this this was the man William Branham that was not God no not known geography there was the man who was nervous behind the pulpits don't if if something is that he says is is not that way in the Bible then just say that was the man who was nervous not more you don't have to repeat all things that are wrong when it comes that he was misplacing some words of scripture or whatever not not at all huh but here comes that simple many and and and and and and and he's the greatest messenger of all because there's two Messengers they are outstanding Paul and brother Brandon Paul was the only one who could add to the Bible all the rest were just reformers they could just point back to Paul but brother Brandon was the only one who could open the Seven Seals amen Paul was the one who could lay the foundation as a wise master builder but brother Brandon brought the Capstone upon upon the building two were special but we are not brenamites we're Christians we're not Brandon fans we're Christians my savior is Jesus Christ can you say Amen amen but what happened is like every father is the head of his own home every Pastor is the head of a local church I'm under a headship I have a pastor as an older man it's brother wrote the world some of the things I see a little bit different than him but I would never misuse the pulpit to bring discredit to the man I must find my role but we are not in a sect sometimes we talk with one another I said brother yeah to be honest I see a difference but brother Brandon said everything that has more than one heads is a monster quote brother Brennan so one is the final voice for the church because one day you will stand for God for the local church not me I can give you an advice but I will never try to interfere to Sublime whatever you say because then I will stand before God one day we have to know our calling our position and in our calling is a limitation if I don't see it my ministry will never be successful I will stand in my own way all my life but if a normal limitation I can fill it up to the maximum huh so a pastor is the head of his local church but brother Branham uh the messenger is the head of a church age therefore there will be a people who will be the final voice for the final age and brother Graham said this under their messenger quote brother Lynn so therefore I am not in to heal my tapes honestly not because I say if you have time why don't you listen to The Prophet's voice amen we are not promoting our names what for amen but the head of all seven Messengers is Christ himself I was one time to ask the question he said brother Marcus does somebody have the right to correct the prophet I said sure God has a right but not us I'm in because if not we are we are misrespecting headship but God also the Bible he was correcting His prophets sometimes their men dwell Here Comes Nathan he goes to David he said David praise the Lord build that building it seems wonderful in the night God comes to him and said hey stop that nonsense go back to him and tell him I said in my own in my own words amen so you see when the ministry of brother Branham Comes Here Comes others are a robots I mean here is a man like like like uh not A.A Allen uh Tommy Osborne he was sitting and he said I saw Jesus in the Bible I saw Jesus in in Walking In Alfred and I saw Jesus and the Man by the name of William Branham and when he saw him in Oregon he said I can do the same thing I heard the voice that's what Tommy Osborne says and tremendous ministers came out by the inspiration of William Branham A.A Ellen Tommy Osborne uh Aura Roberts and and and and and and there was something they were even mightier than the prophet when it comes to signs and wonders but only one had a message there was only one messenger amen so what happens is this they have now a gift and Christianity became a entertainment program for the people a show I mean here is here is here is for example our Roberts he had 50 Shape TV channels at the same time and it costed in billions of dollars therefore he had to call for money to support these television chains that's the reason all that kind of nonsense please don't let repeat us these things in the message of the hour you take an altar call of of Jimmy Swaggart okay so everything is emotionally built up and the people on the front that's fine everything has its time but you can see the camera going to find somebody who's crying I mean something for me that is so disrespectful there is such a lack in sensibility for the Holy Spirit here's somebody between life and death and we make a show to promote how effective my preaching was sometimes the world has more decency than this and then why why well somebody some girl some boy he is filmed then you can always see the bank accounts support and God is blessing you all these kind of things so it became a a show that was the beginning when they found out when they were inviting special singers uh uh at that time red folly forgot some other names they were now the the program before the preaching came and that was the beginning of of of of that everything has to be professional everything every every tone every note every you can you can't imagine somebody okay we're we're now on air amen then you see a man and you see and you see the man Jesus [Music] and the Very sins of that thing got lost the sincerity the honesty behind us man being a real man everybody became now A Champion every television preacher is a good-looking Joel Osteen Jesus loves you and there was no place for the messenger because he was not feeding in that program can you say Amen so so so God now inspires brother Brahm he says in brother sister I've been back in the cave long enough and you have to to know there has been a lot of earthquake and brother Ben speaks about the Pentecostal revivals in the 50s and the 60s shaking around faster since you things like that in big meetings but where has been God out of it remember what he says that was fine but it was just entertainment spiritual entertainment for the people brother we we always say this and please face for your personal life Faith reality I have to do it I have a child I never problem with it she was serving the lord I always say she was born already with the Holy Ghost somehow for those who gave her heart to the Lord but never made the problem but it could have been different and sometimes we want to raise up our children in the message and we do our best but they need Christ if not we are educating them or we bring them up to become rich young rulers you understand they know how to behave in the church they dress right they do right they act right they pray somehow but they were never born again because they never knew what it is therefore there you find that bitterness in people rather sometimes you have people they are dressed so perfectly but you find that bitterness in their heart you said Hey brother you're missing something you can even find it in Preachers amen you find young people and brother Graham said that Rich Young Ruler he woke up in hell so it became a a a some kind like a like an entertainment program and he says that's the reason that I said this morning there has to come something deeper than a healing service there has to come something deeper than the gift of speaking with tongues there has to be something deeper than a rushing Mighty Wind and brother brain preached us at the end of the 50s in the message uh what does thou hear Elijah exactly so so it's a danger that is what I want to say you see if the Holy Spirit wants to say something then then he will do forgot it but he comes back amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen we don't want you but there it is amen amen so you see brother Raymond said there is if you go and I want you all to put on your spiritual jacket we want to have Harmony over Harmony and everything is fine but sometimes life is tension because you must struggle for truth and the prophet said if you come into a church service uh you either go back out warmer or colder but there is a certain way too a person can become religious and that is the worst thing a religious person thinks that he is right and doesn't understand that he's so wrong a person who goes who becomes worldly that is very obvious amen so we are at the end of the 50s and here comes the opening of the word amen Here Comes The Seven Seals here comes the Capstone Here Comes Revelation 10 fulfilled here is the third the third pull and then brother Branham explains what is going to happen March March 63. remember keep in mind there must come something deeper than just a healing service he just picked me up and took me set me way up to where a meeting was going on it looked like a tent or a Cathedral of some art of some sort and I looked and there was a little white box little place over there on the side and I've seen that light was talking somebody up to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it welled away from me like that and went over to that tent and said I will meet you there and said this will be the third pool and you won't tell nobody and in Sabino Canyon he said this is the third pool so if there is a place where God says I will meet you there let's find that place can you say Amen because it's so important to meet him there amen so we understand that that means it is a tense that's what the Bible says sometimes brother Abraham says it is a little wooden building now you must understand one thing and it will help you you must read the message you cannot live by quotes you must see the picture amen and you must must read that message with a lot of reverence with a lot of respect said heavenly father I know you are right maybe my understanding is wrong a man don't never put a a full stop always say I put a comma maybe I'm learning more amen because it's a question of life and death to find that place if you see a vision of a prophet a vision can be natural when brother Branham had that Vision about Marilyn Monroe that was a natural vision pure natural but when Pharaoh had a dream about the seven cows and so forth that was a symbolic dream you understand when Nebuchadnezzar had their dream about that statue that was symbolic so dreams and Visions can be natural and can be symbolic with a spiritual understanding or spiritual explanation about it amen so we see people in South America they mean well it's good people they love the message they love the Lord they are building a huge building and in that huge building they're making a little tent and say that's the place where God will come down one day I said that's the problem we have too much Muslims in this message they're putting on a white a white horse so when when the prophet comes back he will write on that white horse around the world that's what Muslims believe amen but this message is for the bride I don't believe it's it's a natural tent because I mean if it's a tent natural where we'll meet God what if the trend is in Europe Only You millionaires can afford the only one who is blessed by that Doctrine is Lufthansa you say about America that's just funny we had this kind of convention you have to come to that Firefall uh Rapture in faith convention to get something brother I need nothing because he promised me to meet me there in that little room [Applause] that time is over brother that is bright age is a new age there is no me no Minister who comes today like Superman sure okay super preaching goodbye next year and people say we have to invite this man because he has holy hands that time is God wants to stir the part of Eternity that he placed in your hearts foreign that's the time of adoption for children of God not to find the next man of the hour it never worked in the future it will never work can you say Amen brother brother I'm so happy about about talking to people who really understand what about you must have good Ministries but let me let me let me let me make that little example I don't know if I will preach about it in the next days but brother Beckett made years ago a very nice picture I've never forgot it God made a picture of his family before the foundation of the world and here we were not arrogant brother REM said if you want to continue with God never have an arrogant spirit amen but we are proud of our father and we have a right to be proud I remember one day yesterday as a testimony of brother Billy Paul brother Billy Paul he says his son or his grandson he was in Jeffersonville IN some in some shop and the older man looked to him and say you're looking like like that William Branham it was a pastor many many years ago in Jefferson was he was he a pastor was he a preacher and the boy said no and then then he said wasn't it Brandon Brandon was this is there a tabernacle wasn't your grandfather wasn't he not a preacher he said no but what was he then he was the prophet of the age not ashamed so here God makes a picture a man and he takes our souls I mean and throws them in seven Church ages all over the in seven continents and God knows one thing my sheep will hear my voice and he knows one thing when God when seven Church ages are over the whole family of God is together that's the reason brother Wayne was the first messenger who said God is not complete anymore without you brother there is a big difference between the bride and the church the church is whosoever will let him come there is many people who will get be saved on the white Throne judgment many people I believe Millions but the bride is part of Christ right from the beginning can you say Amen amen that is one of the teachings that is so different to all the messengers that brother Brandon explained to us he said he said Eve was part of Adam did you ever think about that when God came in the Garden of Eden in the night and he called Adam where are you two people came because Adam was two people male and female God called Adam and ether because if had no name um Even Adam didn't call her Eve he called her just a helper or God called her a helper her name was taken from the man so when God called Adam Eve came with him because it was her name so as the bride was in Christ like Eve was in Adam he was part of him hey amen I mean sister said to me brother Marcus when God separated the female out of Adam he took the best out of man I said Okay that was your interpretation [Laughter] but she was she but she was she was him she was part of him but not all of him was in here there was still part in him the male part so when when when when when the bride was in Christ and brother Abraham said even we prayed for our own sins at the cross of calvary who will understand that amen amen so if we were in Christ amen and Christ was Melchizedek right before then we were making amen can you say Amen and when Melchizedek was the pillar of fire before then we were in the pillar of Fire in what form ever and with the pillar of fire comes out of the bosom of God we were in God right in the beginning [Music] we are part of that whole thing but only the bride is it can you say Amen there's a big difference you understand one thing nobody can preach you into the bride and nobody can preach you out of it [Applause] can you say Amen amen you can reject my preaching but you cannot reject my origin maybe the church doesn't understand you but God understands you I'm therefore when we were born God placed part of himself already into us David said in the Psalms he even placed eternity into us and there's only one who is eternal there's God so you were you were born with a calling already blessed be the name of the Lord can you say Amen only the bride the rest is whosoever come let him come we were happy about that so what happens so we are searching now the tense where is it is it in New Zealand or is it in Germany is it in Jeffersonville or is it in Tucson so everything that brother Graham says you have to bring back to the Bible and the question is who was the first one in the Bible who had a tent vision that was Moses because Moses was taken up in the presence of God and when he comes down he said you built me a tabernacle according to the picture the image that you saw in heaven can you say Amen the first one was a tent Vision was Moses himself and he was building that Tabernacle and it was perfectly symbolically a human being Body Soul and Spirit our body Spirit Soul however you want to take it I know brother Brandon said it this way that way never me I want to say this if you want to continue if you want to be happy in your message never make issues about little details you must see the picture and then it's clear I mean there's something even certain quotation of brother I have to let them stand I can I say I don't understand it right now okay leave it like this amen but here it is so what does he do amen he built a tabernacle according to the vision that he had in heaven no matter what he saw maybe theophanus or whatever let it be like this okay and he's transforming it into a tabernacle but this is representing a human body brother sister nothing in the in the whole universe is like a human being because the human being is the only creature which is made in the image of God so therefore you can always have respect even if somebody is an unbeliever respect him to be a human being say man we we were young in the message and our parents will not believe us like we like us so we were despising the parents despising grandparents everybody was a jezebel I mean and we learned to respect people amen because if we despise unbelievers the next thing we will despise denominations the next thing we despise is everybody in the message who is not in our Doctrine that is a spirit it's an attitude and they will respect they will be despised even in the local church everybody who's not agreeing with us and at the end we end up in a one-man denomination give people their place that God gave them if somebody is Born To Be A Baptist say God bless you the way how God made you because God is the judge at the end amen you know that story of of that man with the lizard eye brother Raymond said Bert that question now when he said lead me to that Jesus that you know what does brother Ram say today he is a deacon in the Baptist Church leave him there God has a place it's not Pride bride is led by the messenger but God has many different vessels leave them there God decides what to do with it so nice it's so nice and it helps me a lot it keeps me such a such a respect because brother Graham said this he said lot was a of Abraham was a silver dollar lot was just a penny or some pennies but if you go shopping and you have to pay one dollar and three cents you say okay here's the dollar and the grocer says okay where are the three cents it's not one dollar is one dollar three cents and then brother Graham said this he said some people are just pennies but God uses those Pennies from time to time ah a and then another I will not make a wrong connection but but give a little bit Grace to people let the messenger say what he says and then brother man said this everyone who served God's purpose will have a resurrection brother bride is bright but give a little bit of Grace for the rest they will have their place in God's economy amen so here we have Solomon was building exactly the same Temple and brother Brandon said the curtain between uh the the holies and the holies of holies is our self-will perfectly a human being can you can you say Amen so far can I just continue a little bit is it fine for you that is the reason and I and I will not speak about the self and the self-curs curtain remember if you're now closing that curtain and brother braeme said it's the self of a person when you close that curtain that was the situation when the worshiper came and in the temple of Jerusalem so the The Temple at that time in the time of Jesus that was a big business when two million people came three times a year for the three big Feasts so the temple was closed and everybody thought the Shekinah Glory is behind that Temple but it was not anymore behind that Temple because the Shekinah Glory the pillar of fire appeared over a man on Jordan River it changed from a building to a person by the name of Jesus Christ and behind that curtain in the time of Jesus Christ was just furniture so because he left that place and came over Jordan River to dwell in the man was just Furniture just history just amen but it was a business and you must understand once in Yom Kippur the the high priest goes in and he's looking and whatever he comes back he comes out and he tells his colleagues he said okay gentlemen I the high priest was was just a political uh uh political voted by the Sadducees which was more of a political sect so he comes to his friend he says gentlemen I don't think that I'm not spiritual I'm really spiritual honestly but I want to share something with you okay uh yesterday was Yom Kippur and um you know I was behind the curtain he said yes tremendous yeah tremendous but there was nothing and they said we all know that there is nothing but if we tell the people there's nothing they will come to worship and pay that's the reason that Jesus said you met the house of God a den of Thieves and therefore brother Graham said the words Pharisee means an actor he plays something which is not really there so the curtain is closed and here I hear the ashes don't touch the curtain don't touch your the presence of God is here don't touch it I mean that reminds me sometimes if you have Pentecostal so-called Revival if you want to just make our people to make that convention a big success tremendous what a success I mean oh I feel he's right now here he is here because you are here it's no need now to to mysterious the situation to feel everybody a little bit more spiritual I feel really his yeah if he's here because he's in the children I hope there's some Christians here I believe all of you and you can't imagine here's the high priest and the children come and Mr high priest um we have a question um um can you explain what is behind that curtain and he knows there's nothing it's just furniture he says children I cannot tell it it can I cannot put it into words yeah it's true hypocrisy playing to be spiritual and knowing there's nothing behind that thing brother don't let this start in our places in our churches to play something which is not there I mean just to have a good mood good feeling and so when when when Jesus died at the cross you have to understand that that that that he opened he was he was he was renting that way from the top to the bottom and everybody could see there is nothing behind and the thing about the high priest did it was this exactly so they continued their game but it was changing of dispensation can you say Amen so we see that God has a temple he will meet us in a tent and where is that tent let me say it like this what about that thought that we are the tent because the Bible says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle what is it a tense we're dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens second Peter said we are now living in a tent in a tabernacle so you search here and you search there and you want to stream here and you want to stream there and somebody has something to say and you're missing the real thing which is here the real streaming is here is not to all let's hear Marcus back a tremendous breath fine but the real streaming is in your hearts nobody can preach you into that Fellowship we can impress people what we know but it will not help you on long-term effects can you say Amen so so so here is a meeting place and it's right in your heart therefore David said in the psalm he said the Lord is my light and my salvation who should I fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the week find the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle do it my anchor is not the local church my anchor is Christ because one day our doors will be close brother and the streaming will not function and the cell phone will not work and then I have still connection to God who lives in me can you say Amen look at this amen you put on your spiritual jacket who came down in our time the king the heads The Brew the bridegroom the messenger left the scene but the message is there a man who is that King he's the king of all lights he's the one who can put turn on the lights he is the light and we are children of the lights look at this and you put on your spiritual jacket David said the Lord is my light but for the people David was the light for Israel because you remembered when he wanted to go into war the people said no David you are the Lamb of Israel David said the Lord is my light for the people David was their light aha that means was God in David and they're recognized that was not David's capacity there was God in David's look now Shalom now those who will not turn to light then their own is one thing I can say for in the coming year you're going to stoop darker and darker as the year goes on but to those who will turn on this New Year's to the lights 64. then you will get brighter and brighter that is your promise for next year on to the perfect day that we look for he's appearing where all Darkness will be faded away and the reason of that is why I say to the Church of the Living God today Shalom because we are his lights you say the Lord is my light the message is my light and God said you are the lights yeah yeah can you say Amen I mean I say now a sentence and you don't reject it directly you lay it under the pillow maybe it was not as as dumb as we think if the coming of the lights is the when the coming of Christ is the coming of the light is the coming of the Sun amen amen when he says Darkness covers yours but the light appears over over the Isaiah 60. what is the light it's Christ himself and brother bran said you are the lights that means we are the coming of the Lord we will meet him in the air it's not a question about this future but there is a coming of Christ there is a coming of the Capstone there is a coming of the person of the Holy Spirit where is he in Tucson in Jeffersonville in the grave of William Branham the bride is the light you can say I am the coming of the Lord of Christ not the Lord as we see the illumination we will meet him in the air future no problem but there is a secret coming where in me and why you become the light you are the lights nobody can if you preach or no preach there's nothing to do with that you become a light for a Dying World Jesus said you are the light of the world and you say Amen now now I'm reading just to you don't have to read with me but you believe me okay and first Thessalonians chapter 10 verse of chapter 1 verse 10. when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that belief because our testimony among you was belief in that day again when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints aha there is a coming of God where we'll not meet him in the air because it's a twinkle of an eye there's a coming of the Lord to be glorified in his Saints when will it be I believe that is that was that is is right on track we are right in foreign therefore you cannot dress like you want brother I see I and I will deal with the next Services about it we have young people that told me very clear brother Mark we were in a sect everything was controlled we were forced to put these things on they went into the things of the world and by God's grace they came back and now they wear long hair and long skirt as in the same person says me brother Marcus now it's my conviction now the long skirt and long hair is my honor before God amen because I found a father I didn't found a religion I found a father I found who I was but still before I found it was just pressure of a sect amen what happens blessed be the name of the Lord amen there it is the resurrection is an event but at the same time the resurrection is a person Jesus said I am the resurrection the Rapture is an event but the Rapture is a person the bride can say I am the rapture he cannot somebody said pay attention Raptor come no no I'm part of it brother that is a true story a true story of of Tony apma he missed the he missed the plane he was too late coming to the plane was just and then beside him was an official of the airport he's just walking on the gate and Tony is like a little bit of a nervous man like me brother I have to go to the fight this gate zone so God fly to Atlanta whatever man said yes it's Gage gate zone so and Tony said okay I have to get the flight because in the Mainstay you will get the flight no problem Antonio yeah but I have to hurry up because it's going the message you get the flight I'm the pilot you understand Rapture doesn't work by fear you must know who you are yeah nobody can preach you in brother brother brother you put on your spiritual jacket you can become fan of Marcus Becker you can have your Apple of Marcus Becker now every Wednesday Marcus Becker but that doesn't make us bright it just makes you Marcus Becca fan please don't become this because you will be you you will be frustrated sooner or later but find yourself in the book and you know who you are okay saving I'm blessed be the name of the Lord amen if I put Marcus back you know put every Minister within amen there it is look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible a complete revelation of of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God's trying to do amen show you your position amen you love the Lord these things can only preach to Eagles denominations would think we're crazy saying these things they would say we create for us it's food spiritual food into your season it's it's something that says that sounds good that sounds right brother I'm very careful about any kind of pre-existence I know there is certain there's no but I'm not preaching especially when I'm not trying but when I'm traveling because I will leave more questions than answers that is up to the pastor okay but somehow we were there somehow in what form ever because God says to job where were you what forever I have my opinion about but leave it in my heart okay but you know brother Brennan was with the Christian businessman and you know how they made fun about him about his stories amen about the squirrel story and here he says he said this one of the brothers said okay if you want to hear that squirrel squirrel story you come to me they made fun of brother Brennan we believe everything that brother Abraham says all the creation because we were with God when he created in the beginning we know it was not a problem in the beginning the same God does whatever he wants in what form ever like we write in his Minds can you say Amen let me come to the end let me to come to the Finish amen hallelujah so here we have the three wise men amen any and any that little little Christmas Story so they were three men over there in Babylon the brother Brandon and they looked through that um glasses and they saw three stars in one line that's what brother Brian says and they understood that something would be happening in Jerusalem that the Messiah is born because they realized that these stars were the burst out of Shem Hammond jeford and all the others could look through the same glasses but it just saw three stars but God opened their understanding we say that is so tremendous but I tell you one thing the same Holy Spirit opened your understanding the same way you are not less than them amen your understanding is your it is your identification your origin will be your future talking about the bride amen you know that that that that that little story amen I because God is so much in humor amen here's brother Brandon and the upline could not leave Memphis and he hears the voice just go and he just goes and he says and while I was just going and brother Brian used the word a negro woman I hope I'm if it's politically correct or not that'd be called a black person people said use this word or whatever but let me say what brother Graham said Here Comes the colored lady an African African native lady okay you understand okay and he was like this over the fence and she says hello Parson and brother Graham said how do you know that I'm a minister you see God is in humor normally it was brother Branham revealing those people your name is Eva I can see you in that car accident I can see this but here that woman reveals the prophets brother Bram does not know who she is but she knows who he is you must be the Prophet Elijah and then she says something which is great this is the bride and I am the shunamite woman brother there's many people who can't who can find William Branham in the Bible and it's not very difficult to find it but you must find yourself in the Bible too this speaks of me this is my scripture here I am I am that shunamized woman amen hallelujah and then brother Brian said this amen how do you know I I end up shoot a mad woman and when they went into their home brother Ben said you could feel it was a House of Prayer God reveals himself you let you let the family altar go I tell you troubles will enter your home a family that stays together is a family that prays together you must you must take your children you say brother Marcus I don't have time we have to have to work God had many many things to do in the time of the Garden of Eden I mean a lot of angels a lot of seraphims a lot of this a lot of a lot of things to do but every evening daddy took care of his family came down in the Garden of Eden brother Benham explains you know we made Family alter and we made it horrible for our children they were sitting down and here comes around there's a prophet and a prophet around they don't understand things in the church how would they understand at home okay the only thing is that they learn to be nice so amen full body control I mean so now we make that church service now seven days a week but brother brim said this he said in that kind of family order God came down and asked his children how was your day he let the children speak that was my day daddy Adam came and said that was the day that happened to me they were expressing themselves that's our father that's our God not not putting a Doctrine into the mouths of these children but getting to know a father who loves them he said you can say hey children I love you because I have a father who loves me the same way and that father will become your father the same way you say Amen so they just go on their way and brother Raymond said this three men in one line and three stars in one line that is the point when brother Blenheim says God shows first in the heavens and then he makes it he manifestes on Earth that's the cloud you can try you find yourself and you write in it good luck amen so when they were just going they didn't have a message the only service the only preaching that they had was we have seen a star amen so when they had family altar between the three brothers every evening somebody else was preaching but they had only one subject but somehow the subject was not boring because the subject was their life and he said who who has a subject this evening on his heart I mean one brother said hey I got an inspiration brother sit down Brent okay what is inspiration I don't understand very much but I have seen his stars and the other said praise the Lord enthusiasm has nothing to do to do that we hear always something new enthusiasm means you understand what was said and you can sell the same thing a thousand times in a thousand times you say praise the Lord that's me so they were just following encouraging one another and they entered into Jerusalem and brother Abraham said this when they're mixed with the wrong kind of crowd the Pharisees and the Sadducees they didn't see the star anymore show me your friends I show you who you are or who is influencing you brother I made an experience in my life never forget people have Spirits never forget this amen if if you are always the wrong people that doesn't like Marcus Becker you don't like Marcus Becker you don't you have no reason it's just the spirit of those people once somebody starts to speak negative that you must your alarm must go hey stop stop no no there is an anointing I don't want to have that anointing brother can you say amen amen I I give me give me just five minutes okay that's fine can you say Amen just I'm in the food is not good anyhow therefore okay tomorrow I Repent okay yeah we were young and we were legalists that was so in the beginning when you're me you you see what our problem was and maybe the brother brother Adrian and brother Eric they can confirm uh we we brother brame had different anointings in his ministry and one of the anointing was the Prophet Elijah but he was more than the Prophet Elijah he was the church age Angel he was the angel too loud to see her he was the angel of Revelation 10 he was the Moses Ministry he was the Joshua Ministry he was the elieza ministry a lot of ministry that he had but he was the Prophet Elijah so part of his ministry was just scolding the people make it harder and and if the Holy Spirit Come he tells it clear there is the doors I told Brother Elroy I said look here's brother Brian he said and these girls when they don't come home and they and they address Emory you know these mothers they should take a whip and should we should should give them the streams on their back quote of brother Brian I was just recording but when the daughter of brother blame had their problems what did he say she needs a friend he found out as the Prophet Elijah I cannot lead a family amen I have to now change that amen amen the same Prophet you said you have to really beat them up nobody that don't do that what she needs is a friend you see we have to pay attention under what anointing we do certain things we can say the prophet said yes but what was the anointing okay so we were young and we we were listening to the messages and many times it was the Prophet Elijah just quoting the eliminations just just scolding them so I thought preaching is scolding because the prophet did it so often but I didn't understand he had a Ministry to school denomination but I'm not called to Scott illumination I thought I'm called to speak to the bride I mean to speak a little bit about love about Romance amen I mean imagine that picture I'm here's now Rebecca I mean on the way with with elieza and we are the further voiced that so because we have to prophesy again and and Rebecca said tell me something about Isaac and Elise I said look uh uh uh who is this milk Hasidic I will explain to this okay then he says the token and he says that the Mighty God unveiled before us so he was creating that love to her it is I didn't say hey look how fat you are man poor elieza when he sees you I put Isaac when he sees him did you didn't you did you brush your teeth this morning or whatever he knew how to deal with her that was the future bride of the king you understand we were sometimes under anointed but therefore not helpful we meant well but it was not helpful can you say amen amen amen so here they are on the way amen finishing they enter into Jerusalem and they are mixing with the wrong kind of people amen and while their mix was the wrong kind of people they cannot see the star anymore we have a slogan in Germany which says if you are going if you go into a train with five smokers and you don't smoke one cigarette but if you come out of that train you smell like all the smokers the company of people it's a company of spirits where you have to pay attention that family that I said when you said is is a legalist and we were in the beginning more there was sitting sitting just in the back when I was preaching it was just can you say Amen you can say Amen if you want and we think we have to say Amen because you want us to say Amen amen the body language was relatively clear now I break the eyes with some of the young people I don't say shalom I said hey give me five dig it doing hey good hey just to break sometime the eye but the children of that family wouldn't even greet me it's the anointing of the parents falling upon the children without saying so one day you could see there was there was between us it was like a complex but Summer by the word of God that context was broken and the brother and I tell you the truth is an honest testimony brother comes to me said brother Marcus that was just wonderful we became friends was just a complex between us the next day the same children who never greeted me saw me hello brother Marcus can you say do you understand what I want to say the reservation sometimes it comes from us oh man it's it's the anointing of people so I always say Lord keep my heart clean I'm Gonna Keep My Heart clean you don't have to even say but if you think wrong it will have an effect on the people around us when brother Brahman said Elvis Presley these young girls they were putting off their under address putting up on the stage and he was signing up give it back to that girls brother Elvis Presley never sang undressed yourself there was there's no quote but in the Unseen World there was a connection between his thoughts and their them as a receiver the same in the spiritual I always pray Lord heavenly father I got my scars that's super Lord I'm Gonna Keep My Heart clean it's sometimes not easy I want to be honest with you but that's the battle that we always have to fight to overcome these things and you say heavenly father don't let me be an emitter of wrong spirits so brother name said this when they left Jerusalem they saw the star again you leave false company and you see the star again amen pay attention on Friends pay attention on people that influence pay attention of even in the social medias and so forth pay attention but Spirit goes along with those things can you say Amen so they arrive to that little child normally we would have bought something at Toys R Us because the child was not two years old but the three wise men they knew who was in that boy by Revelation so the first comes and brings gold showing he is the king he's Divine the second one brings fragrance amen you will suffer the second one the third one brings myrrh I mean you will suffer death for our Redemption the presence the gifts that they brought were the expression of their revelation the way we come to church brother I know I'm always making the same things but if you are just a guest business it's so so wonderful I wouldn't dare it in our own church you know but that was one time I was new in our in the church that I go to there were two two boys coming like this in the Sunday School and I wanted myself who the parents were I find out who the parents were definitely two weeks later two people coming to the sanctuary whether the way we come they will come if we always come too late it shows our disrespect to God I mean it shows we we as Elder ones we didn't understand some lessons and we expect now the children they will just follow us you say Amen took my little child and and and with my wife and every Sunday morning we went as three persons kneel down at the altar like brother Brian said together with our little one he said praying we were the only one in the church everything must be of Revelations cannot be law he said Heavenly Father speak to our little girl may you touch her may you may you bless her may you give her the Holy Spirit may you bless the preacher may you bless the Sunday we thank you Father amen every Sunday and we have confidence that our prayers was not forgotten no no it's not for God we never and our girl was 13 14 15 16 7 we were not nervous because we know one thing God doesn't come too late no we were not nervous brother Brian said to 20 21 is 85 of all converted to 21. and then you still have 15 for your child our prayers is not forgotten brother he said amen the way we treat the message the way we read it at home is is the revelation of it is our action is a revelation of how we see the message of the hour can you say Amen sometimes you see people and you have the Bible the Bible lays on the floor and all these things I don't believe too much in those things not in form of a legalism but to honor God you honor God and God will honor you can you say Amen so brother are you blessed is that fine for you for the first day um what what what what a Heavenly Father we have and if the musicians would come I I thank you very much even for my my little jokes in between I'm sure that that the food is very very perfect if not I will let you know I know because we must be honest amen but I'm sure we have wonderful Cooks here and I mean what a father we have I mean this message is not a denomination why should I become denominational this message is not a sect why should I become sectarian brother bran never told us legalism why should I become a legalist what's the reason amen I I do I please God more we will see in the next day that brother Brian said our Angel is our theophany that's what he says so if he does if our angels are free that means he has nothing to do with our outside amen hallelujah it's just the reflection of my of my insight between God and Me Myself but to make myself outwardly more holy does not give me a a theophany you say Amen maybe you have the song I we have I have a father do you know that then we sing two three songs and we pray together amen yes I have [Music] before [Music] [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] what a father we have is it fine for you we sing the nice song As the deer pants for the water and that we're praying and I will make an altar call

condemn me every Pharisee can do this but somebody can reach out a hand and can take me out of my situation not just a quote book not a message book but he became the message foreign father we raise our hands and it was a strange evening for me too but I sure know that you talk to people and I'm not opening my eyes in respect to these people they are your children but if my own hand says Heavenly
