[57:18] Welcome to Sunday morning. We are
[57:21] halfway through the weekend and just
[57:24] what a wonderful, wonderful weekend it
[57:26] has been. Maybe I can just ask you to
[57:28] take your seats for a moment.
[57:31] Um just an absolutely special time.
[57:34] I trust that that each one of us are
[57:38] refreshed this morning, ready to receive
[57:40] what the Lord has for us. Um, just the
[57:44] the types and shadows and the principles
[57:46] are just wonderful and I uh I'm excited
[57:50] to see how we're going into the
[57:51] application and the practical side of it
[57:53] today. I assume I have no idea. Praise
[57:56] God. But I'm just really excited about
[57:58] the day. So, uh, thank you everyone for
[58:01] coming. Um just looking forward to
[58:05] excuse me just a really good day of
[58:06] fellowship with everyone. Um
[58:10] there's just a couple of things I I want
[58:12] to mention. Firstly
[58:16] um I announced we're going to have those
[58:18] special um Wednesday night services in
[58:21] the war memorial hall on the 3rd and the
[58:23] 10th. um the dear lady at the district
[58:28] council um had not looked properly and
[58:31] came back to me and said oh sorry the
[58:33] 10th is not available so what we'll do
[58:35] is we'll move the 10th to the 17th
[58:38] um so the two two Wednesday night
[58:40] services that will be moved to the war
[58:42] memorial hall will be the 3rd and the
[58:45] 17th of December so the youth focus
[58:48] service on the 3rd the coup's focus
[58:50] service on the 17th um so just remember
[58:53] that that Wednesday night is moved out
[58:55] with a week, but the rest of the
[58:57] services go on as usual, but it's just
[59:00] that we changed the location for those
[59:02] two services.
[59:04] Um, and then something else that I just
[59:07] feel is is um useful to mention, we've
[59:10] just had a a wonderful wonderful
[59:13] response for the youth camp um
[59:16] announcement this year and thanks to the
[59:19] the amazing team that's involved,
[59:21] various various ones and um
[59:26] this is this is 2025 technology. I'm
[59:29] still in the 1900s,
[59:32] but um it's been really really amazing
[59:35] to see um the response that we've had
[59:37] and we've we out of places we've we've
[59:39] had to stop registrations. Um we've all
[59:42] the places have been filled um and just
[59:45] really excited about it. I spoke to
[59:47] brother Steven Coffee um again this
[59:49] morning and um he's he's really gearing
[59:53] up to come and seeking the Lord and
[59:55] asking for prayer that we keep him
[59:57] before the Lord to make sure that he
[59:58] gets the the direction that the Lord
[1:00:00] wants him to go in and yeah just all
[1:00:03] around just very exciting and just
[1:00:05] looking forward to that that time in
[1:00:07] February um that will come around really
[1:00:09] really quickly once we hit December it's
[1:00:13] crazy month um so we're Just thank the
[1:00:17] Lord that everything has come together
[1:00:18] so far.
[1:00:20] Praise the Lord. Yeah, I just wanted to
[1:00:22] share that with you this morning. So,
[1:00:24] maybe we can stand together and sing one
[1:00:26] more song and then I'll just hand
[1:00:28] straight over to brother Daniel.
[1:00:32] Um,
[1:00:40] he became me.
[1:00:43] He became me
[1:00:48] so that I
[1:00:51] could become him by grace.
[1:01:00] He
[1:01:02] became me
[1:01:05] so that I
[1:01:07] could become him by grace.
[1:01:16] And he
[1:01:19] took my place
[1:01:22] so that I
[1:01:24] through his love could take he
[1:01:33] Oh, he
[1:01:35] became me
[1:01:38] so that I
[1:01:41] could become him by grace. He became me.
[1:01:50] Oh, here he
[1:02:15] Come here
[1:02:18] by
[1:02:26] my gra.
[1:02:45] so that I
[1:02:48] could become him by grace.
[1:02:55] Amen.
[1:02:57] You thankful for that this morning.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you musicians.
[1:03:02] Praise the Lord. Amen. and good to be
[1:03:04] back in service with you again this
[1:03:06] morning and uh really just uh looking
[1:03:10] forward to continuing with our our
[1:03:12] thought from from last night and uh
[1:03:15] trust it was a a blessing to you and
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; and uh sometimes these type of topics
[1:03:23] uh stimulate a bit of fellowship which
[1:03:26] is always nice. Uh it's the good thing
[1:03:30] about having questions, you know,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; um if the wife has a question, then she
[1:03:37] can um ask a husband and if the husband
[1:03:39] has a question, then he can uh ask his
[1:03:42] wife about, you know, what what did you
[1:03:44] think about this or what did you think
[1:03:46] about that? And and uh it's it's great.
[1:03:48] I love it. There's there's something
[1:03:50] about fellowship that uh even a church
[1:03:54] service can't do. So uh we thank the
[1:03:56] Lord for the opportunity to gather here
[1:03:59] again this morning in his presence
[1:04:03] uh with his guidance to us all and uh
[1:04:07] just really really relying on our on our
[1:04:09] Lord this morning. So, um, we're going
[1:04:13] to continue, but we're going to recap a
[1:04:15] little, not much, just a little, um,
[1:04:18] simply because, um, if if we just start
[1:04:22] off and you weren't here last night,
[1:04:24] then it could, uh, it could seem a
[1:04:28] little bit odd perhaps, um, to you if
[1:04:31] you could put that first slide up there.
[1:04:33] Thanks, bro. Yeah. Uh, opening slide.
[1:04:37] Um, but we're going to turn in our
[1:04:38] Bibles here to the the book of Luke.
[1:04:42] Um, which is the got a bit of a picture
[1:04:47] of at least what an artist has um
[1:04:50] attempted to capture
[1:04:53] um the event of what go is going on in
[1:04:56] Luke chapter 4. Um but we understand
[1:05:02] by God's grace
[1:05:04] um through the revelation that he has
[1:05:08] given us that we can see details
[1:05:12] in the story
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; that the greatest artist
[1:05:18] can't actually paint
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; or put together. It's actually it's
[1:05:23] actually not not possible.
[1:05:26] um they can they can see the mechanics
[1:05:28] of of what is going on but the the
[1:05:32] dynamics is a whole another thing. The
[1:05:35] they they can't see the mystery.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And um I was speaking to a brother, a
[1:05:41] minister one time and he was just
[1:05:43] telling me about his concern with AI and
[1:05:47] its ability to be AI to be able to
[1:05:50] generate sermons.
[1:05:52] and uh he was a little bit concerned and
[1:05:54] I I said to him I said brother there's
[1:05:56] one thing that AI can't do
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; and that is it can't see the mystery
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; it cannot see the mystery behind the
[1:06:05] letters it can just see the mechanics it
[1:06:08] can only take what is written it can't
[1:06:10] read in between the lines amend
[1:06:15] has given his bride the ability to be
[1:06:19] able to read in between the lines 's not
[1:06:22] not making his not taking his word out
[1:06:26] of context,
[1:06:28] but she is by his grace able to see the
[1:06:31] mystery written within the lines
[1:06:35] uh of the event that uh that that we're
[1:06:37] speaking about here in Luke 4. And so
[1:06:40] let's just let's just read it here from
[1:06:42] verse uh 14. It says Jesus returned in
[1:06:46] the power of the spirit into Galilee.
[1:06:49] And there went out a fame of him through
[1:06:53] all the region roundabout.
[1:06:56] And he taught in their synagogues
[1:06:59] being glorified of all. And he came to
[1:07:03] Nazareth where he had been bought up.
[1:07:06] And as it his c as his custom was, he
[1:07:10] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:07:13] day, and stood up for to read.
[1:07:17] And there was delivered unto him the
[1:07:20] book of the prophet Isaiah.
[1:07:24] And when he opened the book, he found
[1:07:27] the place where it was written, "The
[1:07:31] spirit of the Lord is upon me, because
[1:07:34] he hath anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:07:37] to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[1:07:40] brokenhearted,
[1:07:42] to preach deliverance to the captives,
[1:07:46] and recovering of sight to the blind,
[1:07:49] and to set at liberty them that are
[1:07:51] bruised.
[1:07:53] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:07:56] Lord. And when and he closed the book,
[1:08:00] and he gave it again to the minister,
[1:08:02] and sat down. And the eyes of all them
[1:08:05] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[1:08:08] fastened on him. And he began to say
[1:08:11] unto them, "This day is this scripture
[1:08:15] fulfilled in your ears."
[1:08:18] And all bear witness and wondered at the
[1:08:21] gracious words he that which proceeded
[1:08:25] out of his mouth. And they said, "Is not
[1:08:30] this Joseph's son?"
[1:08:34] Amen. We'll come back to that. Let's uh
[1:08:36] turn to the book of Revelation.
[1:08:39] Uh Revelation chapter 5. We're just
[1:08:41] going to read this again
[1:08:44] this morning.
[1:08:47] Uh, Revelation 5:es
[1:08:50] 1:7.
[1:08:56] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:08:58] sat upon a throne a book written within,
[1:09:01] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:09:04] seals.
[1:09:05] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:09:08] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[1:09:12] the book, and to loose the seals
[1:09:16] thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in
[1:09:20] earth, neither under the earth was able
[1:09:24] to open the book,
[1:09:26] neither to look thereon. And I wept
[1:09:30] much, because no man was found worthy to
[1:09:33] open the book. and to read the book,
[1:09:37] neither to look thereon.
[1:09:41] And one of the elders saith unto me,
[1:09:43] weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe
[1:09:45] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[1:09:48] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[1:09:52] the seals thereof.
[1:09:54] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[1:09:56] the throne, and of the four beasts, and
[1:09:58] in the midst of the elders, stood a
[1:10:01] lamb, as it had been slain, having seven
[1:10:06] horns, and seven eyes, which are the
[1:10:08] seven spirits of God, sent forth into
[1:10:12] all the earth. and he came and took the
[1:10:16] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:10:21] sat upon the throne. Amen. Maybe we
[1:10:25] could just flip over to uh chapter 8
[1:10:28] verse one.
[1:10:31] This is this is that same one when it
[1:10:33] says a and when he opened this is that
[1:10:38] lamb that was talking about in uh in in
[1:10:42] verse 5 oh sorry chapter 5 7 that was
[1:10:46] coming to take the book. So we see here
[1:10:49] in revelation 8:1 that he now had
[1:10:52] possession of the book.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And because he now had possession of the
[1:10:57] book remember he was the only one
[1:10:59] worthy. He was the only one able.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; But because now he had possession of the
[1:11:04] book,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; it says, "And when he opened the seventh
[1:11:08] seal, there was silence in heaven about
[1:11:11] the space of half an hour."
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add the blessing to the
[1:11:17] reading of his word as you take your
[1:11:19] seats this morning. So just to um draw a
[1:11:23] bit of a a a context here from the story
[1:11:26] that we read uh in in uh Luke 4 here.
[1:11:33] We we spoke about this uh here and there
[1:11:37] last night and just we saw how what was
[1:11:41] happening here was that the book took
[1:11:44] the book
[1:11:46] and revealed himself as the book.
[1:11:50] Because Jesus, he he was the word. So he
[1:11:54] took the word and he revealed himself as
[1:11:59] the word. All right? He didn't pick up
[1:12:02] the book. And I remember if you I better
[1:12:04] put the timer on. I um re remember last
[1:12:08] time I was here, we we focused on this
[1:12:11] scripture. But he did not pick up the
[1:12:14] book as a mystery to himself.
[1:12:17] He picked up the book as a mystery to
[1:12:19] the public.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He picked up the book as a mystery to
[1:12:24] the priest that gave him the book. The
[1:12:27] priest that gave him the book didn't
[1:12:29] know who he was.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; But he was not a mystery to himself. And
[1:12:34] the evidence that he was not a mystery
[1:12:37] to himself is what is that he could take
[1:12:41] the book that was given to him
[1:12:44] which was closed.
[1:12:47] He which was the book of Isaiah. We know
[1:12:49] that he took the book
[1:12:53] he opened the book and he found the
[1:12:58] place where it was written of him.
[1:13:03] The only way that he could find the
[1:13:05] place that was written of him
[1:13:09] is if he knew who he was.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; He was revealing himself by the word.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Right? So that's the book.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Now, as we said last night when we
[1:13:26] looked at the story of Zakius and Jesus
[1:13:28] said, um, I'm coming to your house. You
[1:13:32] know, we were there then.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; We we were in Christ when he went to
[1:13:40] Zakius's home.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And we understand that in this event
[1:13:44] here, you was in him.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You were in him as a mystery.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; He was both bride and groom. And we
[1:13:56] understand that through the return of a
[1:13:58] son of man ministry or the son of man
[1:14:02] ministry there was going to be a another
[1:14:05] manifestation of the word again
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; but but not in this form.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He was going to take on another form.
[1:14:16] And what I mean by form is he was going
[1:14:18] to be flesh again,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; but he was not going to be in the the
[1:14:22] form of flesh that he was here
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; in the second manifestation.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; He was going to be in another
[1:14:30] manifestation of him. It was going to be
[1:14:32] another manifestation of himself
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; in another form. Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And we looked at that last night um off
[1:14:40] and on again looking at Adam um and and
[1:14:43] his wife, how when God bought
[1:14:48] Adam's wife to Adam, it was actually the
[1:14:53] second coming of Adam
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; because that's who that was,
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; right? So the second coming, he is not
[1:15:05] coming in a masculine form.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; But he is coming in a in a in a feminine
[1:15:14] form.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He is coming in a bride form.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And we can say he's coming, but there
[1:15:21] should be something in you that says,
[1:15:23] "Brother Dan, you're wrong. He's he's
[1:15:24] he's come."
[1:15:26] And and that is true, but it's also not
[1:15:29] true.
[1:15:31] Because there's some people that he
[1:15:33] hasn't come to.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; There's some people he hasn't revealed
[1:15:38] himself to.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; He's come and he's coming.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; All right. Because the I I have a I have
[1:15:44] a son who's not serving the Lord.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And I believe that my son was in him
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; as a member of the body of Christ.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; But God hasn't revealed himself
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; to him yet.
[1:16:00] So he hasn't come to him yet.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And we understand that the the coming of
[1:16:05] the Lord and when we think about in a in
[1:16:07] a many membered body, it's a progressive
[1:16:10] coming. It's not just a coming, but it's
[1:16:13] a progressive coming because he comes to
[1:16:16] every member
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; at an appointed time
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't deal with us as a
[1:16:21] church. He doesn't deal with us as as a
[1:16:24] group of message believers. He deals
[1:16:27] with us on a on a very personal level
[1:16:30] and at a and a at appointed time at an
[1:16:33] appropriate time he comes.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we I I I believe that
[1:16:42] because the bride is a part of the same
[1:16:46] book.
[1:16:48] Brother Brandon said this is the
[1:16:50] complete revelation
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Right. That means that this the
[1:16:58] revelation of Jesus Christ in also
[1:17:00] includes him in bride form.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; So because you are a part of this book,
[1:17:08] I believe that he wants you to pick up
[1:17:10] this book the same way that he picked up
[1:17:12] the book.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; We could say it like this. He's going to
[1:17:16] pick up the book again.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; All right? Because we've got to stop
[1:17:21] separating us from him somehow. And it's
[1:17:25] very difficult in our through our
[1:17:27] natural minds and our natural tongue to
[1:17:30] sometimes speak a a heavenly language.
[1:17:33] But he is he is he is picking up the
[1:17:36] book again
[1:17:38] and he is opening the book again and she
[1:17:42] is turning to where it is written of him
[1:17:46] and saying this day this scripture is
[1:17:49] fulfilled.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so Revelation 5 um
[1:17:54] through to Revelation 5 through to the
[1:17:57] opening of the seals in Revelation, the
[1:17:59] seventh seal and Revelation 8 is
[1:18:01] something that the bride the bride picks
[1:18:04] up the book and she says, "This day this
[1:18:08] scripture is fulfilled."
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's a it's a wonderful thing
[1:18:13] when we when we look at this because
[1:18:16] what we find is that the book is in the
[1:18:19] home. The book is in the home. That's
[1:18:22] the this is this part two of what we
[1:18:24] looked at yesterday. Uh the the the book
[1:18:27] in the home. And so, the breaking of the
[1:18:30] seals has a spiritual application.
[1:18:35] But is it possible for Revelation 5 to
[1:18:39] be in a natural application in our home?
[1:18:43] Can those principles
[1:18:46] be be expressed be applied to our homes
[1:18:50] to our to ourselves as fathers uh
[1:18:53] mothers, sons and daughters. Absolutely
[1:18:56] 100% in in my opinion there's there's
[1:19:00] absolutely no doubt in my mind that God
[1:19:04] wants us to live by the principles of
[1:19:07] his of his word.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it doesn't matter what we
[1:19:11] think. It doesn't matter how difficult
[1:19:14] they might might seem like
[1:19:18] uh to live by.
[1:19:20] They are life.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; The principles of God are life. The
[1:19:25] principles of God are something that God
[1:19:28] wants to see in our homes.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; All right? God wants to see these
[1:19:34] principles played out in our homes
[1:19:36] because this is the level that God has
[1:19:39] condescended to.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; God has condescended to a level beyond
[1:19:45] I'll say it like lower than a prophet.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; He's condescended now to mom's dads,
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; sons, and daughters.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; All right. He's kind of saying he he I
[1:20:01] say this, he can't go any lower,
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; but really he can't go any higher
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; because the way up is down.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You know, the the he couldn't condescend
[1:20:11] into our lives until he had condescended
[1:20:15] into a prophetic office. He couldn't
[1:20:18] take the office of of a father until
[1:20:21] he'd taken the office of of prophet. So
[1:20:25] what what you call up or down, I'm not
[1:20:27] really sure, but the statue of a perfect
[1:20:30] man goes like this,
[1:20:32] right? And it gets closer to him as it
[1:20:35] gets to the top.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So we we are up at that
[1:20:40] capstone and God is now expressing
[1:20:43] himself and manifesting himself as his
[1:20:47] family.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Not in a man but in a many membered
[1:20:52] body. God in his family. All right. So
[1:20:57] we looked at these characters.
[1:21:00] Um
[1:21:03] we looked at these the the characters in
[1:21:05] Revelation 5. Uh we have the lamb. We
[1:21:10] have the book and we have the one who is
[1:21:13] holding the lamb.
[1:21:15] The the lamb we know
[1:21:18] it's the son. The hand holding the book
[1:21:22] we know that's the father. But the book
[1:21:26] is the mystery.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; All right. Adam, we know, God, we know.
[1:21:32] But who is this?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Right. Speaking of Adam's bride.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Adam, we know. The the word
[1:21:41] identifies Adam as Adam. The word
[1:21:45] identifies the one that bought the
[1:21:47] mystery to Adam as being God.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; But the mystery, who is this? All right.
[1:21:55] And it was the same with uh Eza. A
[1:21:59] Abraham. We know Isaac. We know. But who
[1:22:03] is this?
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Rebecca.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Right. Rebecca was the mystery.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Rebecca was the one that was
[1:22:11] sealed.
[1:22:13] Uh Adam's wife was the one that was
[1:22:15] sealed. This book is sealed. All right.
[1:22:19] It's the It's the females that are
[1:22:22] sealed. Yeah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; It's not the males that are sealed.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; It's the females that are sealed. And we
[1:22:28] we looked at that a little bit last
[1:22:30] night of why why would God put a seal in
[1:22:34] a woman
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; that only one man is worthy to open.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; When this book was sealed with seven
[1:22:43] seals, but there was only one man who
[1:22:46] was worthy to open it.
[1:22:48] I I I believe God God is wanting us to
[1:22:52] connect
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; that seven sealed book
[1:22:57] with our daughters
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; cuz they're sealed.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; So that's that's where we're going to
[1:23:05] go. That's that's the direction we're
[1:23:07] going to head. And we we we are going to
[1:23:10] look at the the application uh of this
[1:23:13] um tonight uh this morning.
[1:23:17] So there we have it. We have the on the
[1:23:19] left lower we have the lamb coming to
[1:23:21] take the book. We have the um the hand
[1:23:25] holding the book and we have the book.
[1:23:27] The book is the mystery.
[1:23:30] All right. The the book is female.
[1:23:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; We spoke about relationship. This is all
[1:23:46] about relationship. There's a
[1:23:48] relationship between the hand and the
[1:23:50] book.
[1:23:51] There's a relationship between the book
[1:23:53] and the hand. There's a relationship
[1:23:56] between the lamb and the hand holding
[1:23:59] the book. And there's a relationship
[1:24:02] between the lamb and the book and the
[1:24:05] book and the lamb. It doesn't matter
[1:24:07] which way you want to connect it. You
[1:24:09] can just go back and forth, back and
[1:24:11] forth, back and forth. It's it's all
[1:24:13] about relationship.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; All right. But we we understand that the
[1:24:18] the seals here
[1:24:21] belonged to someone.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; The seal belongs to someone.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; All right? And and really that's what a
[1:24:34] sister desires.
[1:24:38] A sister desires to come into contact
[1:24:41] with the one who that seal belongs to.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; All right. And the brother wants to come
[1:24:50] into contact with the seal that belongs
[1:24:53] to him.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; So let let's just read some uh I had had
[1:25:01] these on there as sorry.
[1:25:05] What am I doing here, man? Slow down.
[1:25:08] All right.
[1:25:10] We read this quote last night. Now you
[1:25:13] see the seals when he was in his
[1:25:15] meteoral work back there redeeming. But
[1:25:19] someday he comes forth to take this book
[1:25:22] that he's redeemed.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And all that's in the book would be him.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; For that's the believer. The words in
[1:25:34] the book.
[1:25:37] Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; The the and the word is him.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Right. She is him.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she is the words in the
[1:25:47] book and the word is him. And all that's
[1:25:52] all that's in that he came forth for
[1:25:56] this book of redemption whose names are
[1:25:58] written on the book before the
[1:26:02] foundation of the world when he was
[1:26:05] slain before when he was slain as a
[1:26:09] lamb. All right. So here we we have the
[1:26:12] picture here looking at it how we we saw
[1:26:15] it last night. It's all about
[1:26:16] relationship. Sorry I haven't got father
[1:26:18] there. I don't know maybe on the next
[1:26:20] slide. Yeah, I do. So, uh in in this
[1:26:25] slide in verse seven and this could be
[1:26:28] just you can take this or you can leave
[1:26:30] it whatever but in verse seven is the
[1:26:33] only verse
[1:26:35] where all three are mentioned
[1:26:39] together in one verse.
[1:26:43] We're in verse seven.
[1:26:46] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:26:49] angel,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:26:53] mystery of God,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; the mystery of the book
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; shall be finished.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we see here it says, "And
[1:27:04] he," it's the lamb, I've got them
[1:27:06] colorcoded. You can connect them. came
[1:27:09] and took the book, the bride,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; out of the hand of him, the father
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; that sat upon the throne.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so in in in the days of
[1:27:20] the voice of the seventh angel, what's
[1:27:23] actually going to be revealed here is
[1:27:25] that these three are one.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; not the mystery of gods. Remember John
[1:27:36] saw one sitting upon the throne,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; right? So, so what what we are re what
[1:27:42] God is revealing to us here is this is
[1:27:46] this is one person in three offices.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; God the father,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; God the son,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; are you ready for it?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; God the bride.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Right? These three are one. Yeah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; When in the when when is this revealed?
[1:28:05] When is when do we see them as one? In
[1:28:08] verse seven,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; when do we see them as one? When the
[1:28:13] mighty angel's message comes forth,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; it reveals all three as being one.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's all the word.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's it's this
[1:28:29] as a revelation.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's all of this
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; revealed.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The complete revelation of Jesus
[1:28:39] Christ.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:42] So, just to um again, we I'm not sure if
[1:28:46] I said this last night or not. I
[1:28:48] couldn't I know I had stop written very
[1:28:50] clearly, but um I'm not I can't remember
[1:28:53] where I actually stopped even though it
[1:28:54] says stop. But
[1:28:58] we want to bring this scene
[1:29:01] into the home.
[1:29:04] We have father, son, bride.
[1:29:07] Right. Let me go to the next slide here.
[1:29:11] Parents,
[1:29:13] daughters,
[1:29:14] sons.
[1:29:16] So we want to bring this this scene into
[1:29:19] the home.
[1:29:21] What the hand of God is to the book. Can
[1:29:25] you see it there? What the hand of God,
[1:29:28] hand of the father, the parents. All
[1:29:32] right? It's not just the father. The
[1:29:34] parents need a relationship with their
[1:29:38] children.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; All right? Because the the the parents
[1:29:43] are the one that um govern the home. And
[1:29:49] yes, the father is the head of the home.
[1:29:52] The father is the one who traditionally
[1:29:55] gives away the bride,
[1:29:58] right? Who gives this woman to marry
[1:30:00] this man?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And the father says I do. But he he's
[1:30:06] not saying I do when his wife's saying I
[1:30:09] don't.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; All right. He's actually it's it's one
[1:30:13] voice,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; but it's two opinions.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Right. He's he's saying what she is
[1:30:20] saying, right? Not because happy wife,
[1:30:23] happy life, but because they have a
[1:30:26] revelation
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; of the individual. All right? So what
[1:30:31] what the father is to the book, the
[1:30:35] parents are to the book.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; What the parents are?
[1:30:46] Sorry. What the father is to the son,
[1:30:50] the parents are to the son.
[1:30:54] Because you know he has parents too,
[1:30:57] right?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Right. The the the the young man who's
[1:31:03] interested in my daughter, he has
[1:31:04] parents,
[1:31:07] right? So there's a relationship between
[1:31:10] the hand, the the son and his parents.
[1:31:16] But there's also a relationship between
[1:31:19] the son and the parents of
[1:31:23] who the parents of the book.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; There has to be
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; it it it shouldn't it does happen but it
[1:31:32] should not happen
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; unless there is
[1:31:37] and we'll find out why later. Okay. Um,
[1:31:42] what the lamb is to the book,
[1:31:48] the young men are to their lady.
[1:31:55] All right. What the young men are,
[1:31:59] sorry, what the lamb is to the book, the
[1:32:03] young men are to their lady.
[1:32:09] That's right.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; What the book is
[1:32:20] to the lamb.
[1:32:23] You sisters are
[1:32:25] to your men.
[1:32:32] What the book is?
[1:32:36] Oh, this this book is something else,
[1:32:38] man.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; I mean, when you think about what the
[1:32:42] lamb had to go through,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; what he had to go through
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; speaks
[1:32:51] about the book.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; THE THE BOOK IS SOMETHING ELSE. That's
[1:32:58] right.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; My the book is just
[1:33:04] you sisters are a type of the book.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; What the book is to the lamb, you
[1:33:12] sisters are to your man.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; What the book is to the father or the
[1:33:24] parents.
[1:33:26] The sisters, you sisters are to your
[1:33:30] parents.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; The
[1:33:41] how the father is seeing the book
[1:33:47] is the same way that the son is.
[1:33:58] I'm just jumping ahead here.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; If the boy the man is not seeing the
[1:34:06] book
[1:34:07] the way that the father sees the book,
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; then he's not worthy of the book.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN THE BOOK'S NOT HIS.
[1:34:19] HE'S JUST got to grow
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; into the revelation
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; of the book.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So in this scene,
[1:34:31] the father
[1:34:34] was the keeper of the book. Let me let
[1:34:37] me go back here.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. in in this this scene in
[1:34:43] Revelation five, the father is the
[1:34:46] keeper of the book.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we want to look at that a
[1:34:51] little bit because in the home,
[1:34:55] the parents
[1:34:57] are the keeper
[1:35:00] of their daughters or daughter.
[1:35:04] The book is sealed.
[1:35:07] The daughter is sealed.
[1:35:10] The relationship
[1:35:13] that God had with the book in Revelation
[1:35:16] 5 was the protection of the book
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; and
[1:35:27] so it needs to be in the home.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; It's the father's relationship.
[1:35:38] I say say father but parents
[1:35:42] it's the parents
[1:35:44] relationship
[1:35:46] with their daughter
[1:35:50] that protects
[1:35:52] the daughter
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; because this is why we say can
[1:36:00] Revelation 5 be in the home and I'm
[1:36:03] telling you it can. And I'm telling you,
[1:36:06] it's not that it can, it is.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; If you can understand, if you can see
[1:36:10] it, if if it this is a personal
[1:36:12] experience to you, then you can bring it
[1:36:15] into your into your home. Now, I am the
[1:36:18] father
[1:36:20] because this is the level that God has
[1:36:24] CONDESCENDED TO. AND WHY WOULD GOD
[1:36:26] CONDESCEND TO THIS level and not fulfill
[1:36:29] his word in this level?
[1:36:35] So we we talk about it. We've talked
[1:36:38] about it. It's it's all about
[1:36:40] relationship,
[1:36:42] right? So what this scene is showing us
[1:36:46] is the parents position
[1:36:50] to their daughter.
[1:36:54] But it also shows the the daughter's
[1:36:58] position to their father
[1:37:02] or their parents,
[1:37:04] right? Because a relationship is two
[1:37:07] ways.
[1:37:09] So it shows you the position
[1:37:13] of a parent and the position of you as a
[1:37:17] daughter. All right? We understand that
[1:37:20] the hand of God which is right up here
[1:37:24] the father's hand the book was in the
[1:37:27] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:37:28] throne right which was God the father
[1:37:32] god as a father right and that the hand
[1:37:35] of God
[1:37:37] represents power
[1:37:41] and authority
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; this hand in revelation five that the
[1:37:48] book is in is the same hand
[1:37:51] THAT THE SEVEN STARS WERE in
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; in Revelation 1.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Because God doesn't have right hands.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have powers
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; AND AUTHORITIES. HE HAS POWER
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and authority. Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; So the same hand that the seven angels
[1:38:13] were in
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; are the same hand that the book is in
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; which is power and authority.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this IS THIS IS MIGHTY
[1:38:26] BECAUSE the reason that those seven
[1:38:29] angels were in the right hand the the
[1:38:33] Lord's right hand is because they were
[1:38:35] valuable.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. They had purpose,
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; SO, ANYTHING THAT IS IN THE RIGHT HAND
[1:38:47] OF THE OF GOD HAS VALUE,
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; he was THE SEVEN ANGELS PROTECTOR,
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. He kept them. They were kept
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; BY THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF GOD.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO HERE WE HAVE A BOOK THAT IS
[1:39:07] kept
[1:39:09] a bride
[1:39:12] WHO IS KEPT BY THE SAME POWER AND
[1:39:16] AUTHORITY
[1:39:18] THAT THE SEVENTH ANGEL WAS.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Showing us
[1:39:26] that YOU ARE OF THE SAME VALUE.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; THAT THE SEVENTH ANGEL WAS.
[1:39:33] HE LOOKS at you like he LOOKS AT HIM.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A DIFFERENT PURPOSE, BUT THE IT'S
[1:39:40] NOT THE PURPOSE THAT BRINGS VALUE.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; That brings value.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; All right. So the prophet of God, he he
[1:39:51] said this question and answers, God, I I
[1:39:54] came from God and I go back to God. Is
[1:39:56] that right? after his death, burial,
[1:39:59] resurrection, and ascension, when the
[1:40:01] body was taken up and set at the right
[1:40:04] hand of God. Now, I don't mean God's got
[1:40:07] a right hand.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; God's a spirit.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; But the right hand means means in power
[1:40:16] and authority of God. that in that name
[1:40:21] everything in heaven is named after it
[1:40:24] and subject to it. Everything in heaven
[1:40:28] in earth is named after it and subject
[1:40:31] to it. A name above all names Jesus
[1:40:35] Christ.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO IT'S IT'S POWER AND AUTHORITY.
[1:40:41] Now if we if we understand
[1:40:45] who we are
[1:40:48] as fathers,
[1:40:51] WHERE IS THE POWER AND authority of God
[1:40:55] today?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Wherever God is,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; SO IF GOD IS IN YOU,
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; THEN THE POWER OF GOD AND THE AUTHORITY
[1:41:08] OF GOD IS in you. Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAID HE HAS no hands but
[1:41:13] your hands.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Right. So, so who are these hands?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm speaking to THE FATHERS
[1:41:23] BECAUSE WE'VE GOT to understand what
[1:41:25] level God is condescended to and what
[1:41:28] level of relationship that you can have
[1:41:31] with your daughters
[1:41:33] when they are a mystery to themselves.
[1:41:41] In first Peter
[1:41:43] 1:3, it says, "Blessed be the God and
[1:41:45] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[1:41:46] according to his abundant mercy hath
[1:41:49] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[1:41:51] the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and
[1:41:54] from the dead to an inheritance
[1:41:56] incorruptible and undefiled, and that
[1:42:00] fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for
[1:42:04] you." Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:42:09] who are kept
[1:42:12] BY THE POWER OF God
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; through FAITH
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; UNTO salvation
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; ready
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; to be revealed in the last time.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; So what do what what does God do for us?
[1:42:31] He keeps us.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; How does he KEEP US? BY HIS POWER AND
[1:42:36] AUTHORITY.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE WE ARE IN the right HAND OF
[1:42:41] GOD. WE HAVE BEEN in the right hand of
[1:42:44] God. WE HAVE BEEN KEPT BY THE POWER AND
[1:42:48] AUTHORITY of God because there's a
[1:42:51] purpose
[1:42:53] for keeping you.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:42:58] AND THE PURPOSE OF HIM KEEPING YOU is so
[1:43:01] that
[1:43:03] you through salva through faith unto
[1:43:06] salvation so that you are ready
[1:43:10] to be revealed in the last time.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the last days in the last
[1:43:16] hour the you are going to be revealed.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; So there's there's two things here that
[1:43:22] ARE IMPORTANT WHICH IS KEPT and ready.
[1:43:27] Because a woman needs to be ready.
[1:43:32] Before she becomes
[1:43:36] unsealed,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE seal is broken, she needs to
[1:43:43] be in a position
[1:43:45] that testifies
[1:43:47] she is ready for that seal to be broken.
[1:43:52] IF SHE'S NOT IN A POSITION THAT
[1:43:55] TESTIFIES THAT SHE'S READY, then she's
[1:43:58] not ready.
[1:44:02] So, WE UNDERSTAND THE POSITION of the
[1:44:04] book.
[1:44:06] THE POSITION OF THE BOOK WAS IN the hand
[1:44:11] of the father.
[1:44:14] All right.
[1:44:16] That word kept there it means um keep
[1:44:21] keep with a garrison to guard protect by
[1:44:25] a military guard
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; EITHER TO PREVENT HOSTILE invasion
[1:44:32] or to keep the inhabitants of a besieged
[1:44:35] city from flight.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; All right. So to to keep
[1:44:42] we are kept
[1:44:44] by the power of God. All right. We are
[1:44:48] guarded
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; by the power of God.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; All right. We are protected by the power
[1:44:56] of God.
[1:44:58] HE HAS PREVENTED
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; HOSTILE INVASION.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:07] MEANING THAT HE HAS PREVENTED someone
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; invading
[1:45:14] the book,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; BREAKING THE BOOK, OPENING THE SEALS ON
[1:45:20] the book. HE HAS PREVENTED
[1:45:23] SOMEONE ENTERING THE BOOK THAT IS NOT
[1:45:28] DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY or the right
[1:45:32] to enter the book.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Right? So now you can see this as
[1:45:37] THERE'S A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. THIS is
[1:45:40] this is I say this is the problem but
[1:45:41] it's not really a problem but this is
[1:45:43] the problem with the opening of the word
[1:45:45] because as the word opens it puts more
[1:45:48] responsibility onto us BECAUSE WE ARE
[1:45:51] INVOLVED in the opening of the word.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Right? SO THE PURPOSE OF A FATHER the
[1:45:57] parents to their DAUGHTER IS TO PREVENT
[1:46:01] HOSTILE INVASION. IT'S TO PREVENT
[1:46:05] SOMEONE BREAKING THE SEAL WHO DOES NOT
[1:46:10] HAVE the right
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; to break that seal.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Because that seal belongs to one person,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; right? THERE WAS NO ONE FOUND IN HEAVEN.
[1:46:22] THERE WAS NO ONE FOUND IN EARTH. THERE
[1:46:24] WAS NO ONE FOUND UNDER THE EARTH. NO ONE
[1:46:26] WAS FOUND WORTHY. BUT THERE'S A MESSAGE
[1:46:28] that came THAT SAID THERE WAS ONE. AMEN.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, AND JOHN JOHN WEPT
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NO ONE WAS found worthy.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Now, this may be a I don't this may be a
[1:46:40] little bit embarrassing, but for the
[1:46:42] sisters, but sisters weep
[1:46:46] sometimes
[1:46:48] BECAUSE THEY FEEL THERE'S NO ONE WORTHY,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; there's no one eligible,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; right? in in the message,
[1:47:00] we lack men.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's like here, but I
[1:47:06] know at at home, I think we have uh one,
[1:47:09] two, three, four in our youth group, we
[1:47:13] have four four boys,
[1:47:15] five boys and about 15 sisters.
[1:47:22] SO, SOMEONE'S GOING TO WEEP.
[1:47:29] just putting it logically if you know
[1:47:31] what I mean. I don't know where their
[1:47:33] husbands are but or who they are but you
[1:47:36] you understand what I mean because they
[1:47:39] the and so the the um
[1:47:44] part of the meaning of to guard there is
[1:47:47] to keep the inhabitants of a pre uh
[1:47:50] besieged city from flight.
[1:47:54] So the the relationship that the father
[1:47:58] has with his the I say father because
[1:48:01] this is the first time I've put it as
[1:48:03] parents because I believe it is a
[1:48:06] parents role. If I say father moms just
[1:48:09] include yourself in there. All right
[1:48:11] because you are him.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; All right. So the the relationship that
[1:48:16] the parents have
[1:48:19] with their daughter
[1:48:22] prevents her
[1:48:25] from flight
[1:48:29] FROM RUNNING OUT. SO THERE'S NO ONE
[1:48:32] HERE. I'VE GOT TO GO INTO THE WORLD AND
[1:48:36] FIND ME A HUSBAND. LOOK, IF YOU'RE a
[1:48:39] sister looking for a husband, you're in
[1:48:41] the wrong place anyway.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. All right? Because it's
[1:48:44] the man that that searches you out.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; You you pray for your husband and he'll
[1:48:50] come to you. God, I promise you, God
[1:48:51] will bring him to you.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; All right? So, so the the the
[1:48:55] relationship that the the father has
[1:48:59] with the book stops THE BOOK FROM JUST
[1:49:04] HAVING AN IDEA THAT OH, anyone will do.
[1:49:07] Yeah, exactly.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't know about you
[1:49:11] fathers, but I can only speak from my my
[1:49:13] own experience that you know that we we
[1:49:17] if we see that our our daughters are
[1:49:20] getting a bit flighty,
[1:49:22] a bit worried, there's no one around,
[1:49:26] right? Then you through the relationship
[1:49:29] that you have with him sit down with
[1:49:30] them. You don't you don't call a
[1:49:33] meeting, you know, you need to come into
[1:49:34] my office. You know, it's just like go
[1:49:36] and buy an an ice cream and sit on the
[1:49:38] beach and talk about it and say, "Look,
[1:49:40] look, look, don't worry.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; There there is one.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're a daughter of God.
[1:49:49] If you're a daughter of God, God has
[1:49:51] someone for you. You just we just need
[1:49:54] to be patient and uh allow God to bring
[1:49:58] him to you. All right? It's through that
[1:50:01] it's through that relationship. But at
[1:50:03] the at the same time um his his his
[1:50:08] purpose is to to prevent um hostile
[1:50:12] invasion.
[1:50:13] So the f the parents stand as the door
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; that
[1:50:23] you can't come to my daughter
[1:50:26] but through me.
[1:50:30] H how how are you going to get Now this
[1:50:33] this is a topic that people will totally
[1:50:35] disagree with me especially young men.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Especially young men. All right. HOW CAN
[1:50:42] YOU GET TO THE book
[1:50:46] but through the hand?
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF GOD. IF IF
[1:50:55] YOU WANT TO GET TO THE BRIDE, YOU'VE GOT
[1:50:57] TO BREAK THROUGH THE power of God.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; BUT THE POINT IS HERE THAT WHEN A YOUNG
[1:51:05] MAN CAN SEE HIMSELF IN REVELATION 5,
[1:51:08] HE'LL UNDERSTAND HIS DUTY. HE'LL
[1:51:11] UNDERSTAND HIS ROLE THAT HE'S A THE ONLY
[1:51:14] ACCESS THAT HE HAS TO THAT BOOK IS
[1:51:17] THROUGH THE FATHER OF THE BOOK.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT IS THE PARENTS DUTY
[1:51:26] TO PREVENT HOSTILE INVASION.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; AND FATHERS, THE DEVIL WANTS YOUR
[1:51:33] DAUGHTERS.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't Look No, it's not the
[1:51:39] devil. It's It's a GUY IN CHURCH. LOOK,
[1:51:42] THE DEVIL COMES TO CHURCH.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT? SO WHAT? BUT DAN, HE'S A HE'S
[1:51:49] BEEN COMING TO CHURCH FOREVER. IT
[1:51:51] DOESN'T MATTER. THE HOSTILE INVASION
[1:51:54] DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S A BAD PERSON.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; It means HE'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; He can be a good man,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; right? But there THERE IS A SEAL FOR
[1:52:08] HIM. YEAH.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; BUT
[1:52:13] HIS SEAL MAY NOT BE MY DAUGHTER'S SEAL.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? There is a
[1:52:20] seal,
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ANY seal will do.
[1:52:27] AND IT'S THE SAME WAY THAT THE DAUGHTER
[1:52:30] needs to think
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; that not any man will do
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY MAN HAS THE ABILITY TO
[1:52:38] BREAK THE SEAL. BUT I DON'T WANT A MAN.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; I WANT A MAN WHO IS WORTHY.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; I WANT A MAN WHO IS ABLE.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST ABLE, BUT WORTHY AND ABLE.
[1:52:55] AND THAT'S WHO THE HAND
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; WAS WAITING FOR.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; THE HAND THAT WAS HOLDING THE BOOK WAS
[1:53:03] WAITING FOR HIM WHO WAS WORTHY AND ABLE.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just waiting for a man.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; HE WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO was
[1:53:17] worthy and able. And we're going to look
[1:53:19] at that because what makes a man worthy
[1:53:21] and what makes a man able?
[1:53:27] The relationship you see uh here is not
[1:53:32] a relationship of fear.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You see the the the book
[1:53:41] is not deformed.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; THE BOOK IS HOW IT is meant to be. All
[1:53:49] right.
[1:53:54] This hold
[1:53:56] that the book has keeps it in its
[1:54:00] perfect order.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; We're going to come to this a a little
[1:54:05] later. It's it's not a relationship
[1:54:09] of fear.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; It's not a legalistic hold
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; AND NOR IS IT A COMPROMISING HOLD.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:21] Because a legalistic hold will deform
[1:54:24] the book.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; A compromising hold will not be able to
[1:54:29] hold the book.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; By a compromising hold,
[1:54:36] you lose the book.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we compromise out of fear.
[1:54:43] Yes.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; So both a legalistic hold and a
[1:54:48] compromising hold or a liberal hold
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; are stimulated or they are the result of
[1:54:56] fear
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; because with a legalistic hold you hold
[1:55:02] it in fear of losing it.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; In a COMPROMISING HOLD YOU HOLD IT in a
[1:55:07] way of fear of losing it but lose it.
[1:55:11] SO THE HOLD here that the HAND HAS OF
[1:55:15] the book holds it in its POSITION
[1:55:19] WITHOUT DEFORMING IT.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A HOLD BUT IT'S NOT A hold a
[1:55:26] hold that applies pressure and then
[1:55:30] brings uh it does apply PRESSURE BUT NOT
[1:55:32] A PRESSURE TO a level that causes a
[1:55:35] deformity
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; in the book.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; All right. So when the lamb took the
[1:55:42] book, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PRESS OUT the
[1:55:44] wrinkles,
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Each one of these thoughts is a service
[1:55:53] in itself and and trying to reduce this
[1:55:57] down um to three services, but we're
[1:56:01] doing our best. Um
[1:56:04] now let let's let's look at the book.
[1:56:07] And the book uh here represents
[1:56:10] uh the the sisters.
[1:56:14] Okay. Um
[1:56:18] in the position that the book is in
[1:56:23] in this scene,
[1:56:27] she is ready
[1:56:30] to be revealed.
[1:56:34] The book is in a position of readiness.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:56:41] The book is not its own protector.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:56:50] the book is not its own headship.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's under headship.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; It's under leadership.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; The right type of leadership.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; The right type of headship, not a
[1:57:12] liberal headship,
[1:57:14] not a legal headship.
[1:57:16] The right type of headship. It's
[1:57:19] actually a headship that she desires to
[1:57:22] be.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:25] Now there's a challenge for the fathers
[1:57:28] to create a headship
[1:57:31] that your daughters want to be under.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; That can be challenging,
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; but it is possible.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] The
[1:57:47] the book
[1:57:49] is there
[1:57:51] as a free moral agent.
[1:57:57] THE BOOK IS NOT TIED THERE.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; It's the book is actually a free moral
[1:58:04] agent. the the the the book has decided
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; to stay under the headship
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; of its father.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Until
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; he
[1:58:21] comes along
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; and takes her in marriage.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; The book is loved
[1:58:32] by her father.
[1:58:36] parents,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; right? Your sisters should feel loved
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; by your father, by your parents, you
[1:58:48] know, and sometimes a good little
[1:58:50] exercise
[1:58:52] for your parents to do for your children
[1:58:56] is to ask them,
[1:58:59] "What makes you feel loved?
[1:59:04] Now, obviously,
[1:59:06] you can be tried on that because if they
[1:59:09] say, "Well, I want to go to the blue
[1:59:11] light disco." Well, you know, um, you
[1:59:14] can go, but I'm coming with you. You
[1:59:17] know, if you're dancing, I'm going to be
[1:59:19] the one who dances with you, you know,
[1:59:21] but
[1:59:25] you you understand what I mean, you
[1:59:27] know?
[1:59:29] But but she she cuz we're our our
[1:59:33] daughters are different. If you've got
[1:59:35] more than one daughter, you'll you'll
[1:59:36] quickly understand that your daughters
[1:59:39] are different from one another and they
[1:59:41] respond differently um to different
[1:59:44] things because of they're different. My
[1:59:47] two daughters are are ve are very
[1:59:49] different in their personalities and
[1:59:52] what their likes are and and dislikes.
[1:59:55] So, you know, God the Father, he knows
[1:59:59] us.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Um, we don't even need to tell him. He
[2:00:02] know he knows us. BUT HE STILL LIKES US
[2:00:05] TO TELL HIM.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; You have not because you ask not,
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; you know. So, sometimes it's a good idea
[2:00:11] even though the spirit of God is within
[2:00:13] you that that you don't always know what
[2:00:16] your daughter likes and what she doesn't
[2:00:18] like and what she needs and doesn't
[2:00:20] need. Okay? But the book is loved by her
[2:00:24] by her father. And it is the father's
[2:00:27] love for the book that becomes the
[2:00:30] book's protection.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; All right? Your your love for her needs
[2:00:38] to be stronger than anyone else's love.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Anyone else's anyone else's. BECAUSE IF
[2:00:48] SOMEONE CAN CAN can love her
[2:00:53] more than you,
[2:00:55] then the the potential is that that one
[2:00:59] who is loving her more than what you are
[2:01:02] will pull her out from under your
[2:01:05] authority.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; So your love for her is your protection.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Um the book is under the
[2:01:13] headship of her father. THE BOOK IS not
[2:01:16] a free roaming book.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:01:26] the book
[2:01:29] is not her own headship.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; The book is never
[2:01:38] without the need of headship.
[2:01:45] A woman can never be the head.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; She is always the body.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Right? So
[2:01:56] remember that God is not restricted by
[2:01:58] many things but he is restricted by one
[2:02:01] thing
[2:02:03] and that is the mask that he embodies
[2:02:06] himself in.
[2:02:08] And in this case what we are looking at
[2:02:11] is the daughter
[2:02:13] the book and how if God is in our
[2:02:17] daughters then how will God act through
[2:02:20] our daughters
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; right now this is a good one for you
[2:02:25] brothers because the question that
[2:02:27] brothers have is the same as the sisters
[2:02:29] but vice versa the brothers have well
[2:02:31] how do I know if she has the Holy Ghost?
[2:02:35] HOW DO I KNOW IF CHRIST is in her? Well,
[2:02:38] how does she act?
[2:02:41] How does she respect her daddy?
[2:02:44] HOW DOES SHE RESPECT HER PARENTS?
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Why she she respects mom and and DOESN'T
[2:02:50] RESPECT DAD? WELL, THERE'S A PROBLEM.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; All right. So the the way that we can
[2:02:56] one of the ways that we can figure or or
[2:02:59] find or see how um a daughter has a
[2:03:02] sister has the Holy Ghost or not is her
[2:03:05] relationship
[2:03:07] to her father.
[2:03:09] Now her father may not be in a This is
[2:03:12] where it kind of blows out but her
[2:03:14] father may not be a believer
[2:03:17] BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT GIVES the
[2:03:19] sister a right to disrespect him.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. You have your boundaries. If your
[2:03:25] if your father says cut your hair, you
[2:03:27] don't have to cut your hair because
[2:03:29] there's a higher authority than him that
[2:03:31] has said you don't have to. He doesn't
[2:03:34] want you to.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Right? So that we understand that
[2:03:37] there's boundaries in these things and
[2:03:39] sometimes the father has been taken off
[2:03:41] the scene
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; and the mother is raising the children.
[2:03:46] And as a result of that, what what
[2:03:49] happens here? This is why I've changed
[2:03:50] it from just being father to being
[2:03:53] parents. Because if THE FATHER IS TAKEN
[2:03:56] OFF THE scene through some some accident
[2:03:58] or something that that's happened and
[2:03:59] it's just mom raising the children, then
[2:04:02] then it is the m it's the hand of the
[2:04:04] mother that the relationship that the
[2:04:06] mother has with their children that
[2:04:08] actually keeps their children.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so because God is in the
[2:04:16] daughter, he operates as a daughter.
[2:04:19] Yes.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Right. God in the daughter is not going
[2:04:25] to be head of the home.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; If the daughter is head of the home,
[2:04:30] it's not God
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; because simply it's a perversion.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:04:43] So even from the from the parents of the
[2:04:48] of the um the groom
[2:04:52] you you should be interested
[2:04:57] in your
[2:05:00] son's
[2:05:01] the one that your son has interest in.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; You should be interested. Ah it's his
[2:05:08] choice. Let him do what? No. No. You
[2:05:12] should be interested, right? Because the
[2:05:14] father of the son was interested in the
[2:05:18] performance one of the son but also the
[2:05:22] position of the daughter.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE YOU AS the as parents of the
[2:05:29] son have a responsibility.
[2:05:31] You need to watch OVER HIM.
[2:05:34] YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT HE ISN'T
[2:05:37] being entangled with some Delilah,
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; right? Because when when someone is in
[2:05:44] the arena, SOMETIMES THEY NEED SOMEONE
[2:05:47] OUTSIDE OF THE arena looking into the
[2:05:49] arena to see what is actually going on.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:05:55] So the just because the Holy Ghost IS IN
[2:05:58] THE DAUGHTER DOESN'T mean the daughter
[2:05:59] doesn't need headship.
[2:06:02] And this is not often a problem with the
[2:06:05] daughter. It's a problem with the
[2:06:06] parents.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're old enough.
[2:06:11] THEY'RE ACCOUNTABLE. IT'S THEIR PROBLEM
[2:06:13] NOW.
[2:06:15] WELL, THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE
[2:06:17] THIS PICTURE.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THE ATTITUDE THAT GOD HAD.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; HE WAS STILL HAD AN INTEREST IN HIS
[2:06:26] DAUGHTER. He still had AN INTEREST IN
[2:06:29] WHO SHE WAS CONNECTING WITH.
[2:06:33] UH YOU KNOW and and it it it it rials me
[2:06:37] because I I've heard it often
[2:06:40] that IT'S OH IT'S THEIR CHOICE NOW.
[2:06:43] WELL, IT IS THEIR CHOICE. THEY DO GET to
[2:06:46] that age. But does that mean that you
[2:06:48] just have no responsibility to your
[2:06:50] children anymore?
[2:06:53] I don't believe so.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I absolutely 100% don't believe so. I
[2:06:58] believe we have a responsibility to our
[2:07:00] children no matter how old they are.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:07:07] It is it's uh let me just skip a bit
[2:07:10] here
[2:07:13] again. You know it's the same Holy Ghost
[2:07:16] that's in the daughter is in the father.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Right? The same Holy Ghost that's in the
[2:07:24] father is in the son.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:27] But God in the father is acting as a
[2:07:29] father. God in the daughter is acting as
[2:07:31] a daughter. God in the groom is acting
[2:07:33] as a groom. So how how do we know if
[2:07:36] they have the Holy Ghost or not? Well,
[2:07:39] give them a word test.
[2:07:41] Try them out
[2:07:43] and see if even by you provoking them,
[2:07:46] they'll still respect their parents.
[2:07:50] Oh, your dad, you know, he's a bit of a
[2:07:52] funny daddy.
[2:07:55] You know what, sister?
[2:07:58] That's my dad.
[2:08:00] And no matter how much of a fuddy duddy
[2:08:02] we think he is, he's my dad.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; And I respect him.
[2:08:10] And it's the same same the other way.
[2:08:12] The sister can the the brother can say
[2:08:15] something about the the sister's dad and
[2:08:17] I can't believe it. YOU KNOW, HE WANTS
[2:08:19] US HOME BY 9:00. I MEAN WHAT IS GOING I
[2:08:22] MEAN YOU I MEAN YOU CAN PLAY THIS
[2:08:26] YOU CAN YOU CAN PUT THIS on
[2:08:30] because acting is not enough
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; but the acting needs testing
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; to SEE IF IT IS AN ACT OR IS THERE THE
[2:08:40] GENUINE HOLY GHOST IN THERE
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR
[2:08:46] DAD WANTS US HOME BY 9:00 AND WE'RE NOT
[2:08:48] ALLOWED TO GO HERE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
[2:08:49] GO THERE and And and you sisters can
[2:08:51] say, "Listen, that's my dad,
[2:08:55] and I respect his decisions. He may be a
[2:08:59] a little bit trying at times, but he is
[2:09:03] my keeper."
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; He is my headship,
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; right? And when she submits to that
[2:09:12] headship, brothers, go home happy.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Cuz it's testifying of
[2:09:19] something. is testifying of someone.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:09:26] So for for a young man who's looking for
[2:09:30] for a wife or a young sister who's
[2:09:32] looking for a for a husband's there
[2:09:35] there are there are certain things that
[2:09:36] you can do and there's certain things
[2:09:39] that the father of the daughter can do
[2:09:42] and there's certain things that the
[2:09:44] father of the groom can do. I mean
[2:09:47] groom, but this is way before groom. All
[2:09:50] right? This is when this is when their
[2:09:52] boyfriend and girlfriend or courtship.
[2:09:54] This is before engagement.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; All right? That this this all this all
[2:09:59] happens. Um
[2:10:03] so I'm just trying to skip a little
[2:10:04] here, but um
[2:10:08] the book the sister
[2:10:12] uh is is never without headship.
[2:10:17] You'll notice here that the book is
[2:10:20] going to be transferred
[2:10:24] from one hand
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; to another hand.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; There's not a time
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; When the book is not in a hand.
[2:10:41] There's not a time when THE BOOK IS NOT
[2:10:45] UNDER SOME FORM OF PROTECTION.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; BEAUTIFUL.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Even after marriage,
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; But there is a transfer. The book is
[2:10:59] transferred
[2:11:01] from one hand to the other. All right.
[2:11:05] She is moving
[2:11:07] from one form of headship to another
[2:11:11] form.
[2:11:14] From the headship of her father
[2:11:18] to the headship of her groom.
[2:11:23] Now there's a reason for that and we'll
[2:11:26] get to that. It's all it's it's all in
[2:11:28] the scripture. You you remember the
[2:11:30] scripture says in verse 7 that he came
[2:11:33] and took the book
[2:11:36] OUT OF THE HAND of him that sat upon the
[2:11:40] throne. Right? So he took the book.
[2:11:45] There was a there was a transfer
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; of hands
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; from the BOOK OF HIM THAT SAT UPON THE
[2:11:54] THRONE TO THE BOOK OF THE THE hand of
[2:11:56] the lamb. from the hand of him that sat
[2:11:58] upon the throne to the hand of the lamb.
[2:12:01] There was a transfer.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHERE THE BOOK
[2:12:06] WASN'T in a hand.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; And the hand represents headship.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; The hand and headship is protection.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; All right? IT'S IT'S NEVER THERE'S NEVER
[2:12:19] A TIME WHERE THE BOOK WASN'T LOVED
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT THE HAND REPRESENTS
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; IS LOVE.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; HEADSHIP IS AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; HEADSHIP IS NOT DOMINANCE.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; HEADSHIP IS AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE. IF A
[2:12:40] IF A HUSBAND HAS THE RIGHT TYPE OF
[2:12:43] HEADSHIP, HE WON'T NEED TO PRESSURE OR
[2:12:47] CHAIN HIS WIFE TO THE POSITION OF BEING
[2:12:51] UNDER his headship. IT'S A PLACE SHE'LL
[2:12:54] WANT TO BE.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A PLACE THAT SHE WILL TRY AND
[2:12:59] ESCAPE,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A PLACE THAT SHE DESIRES TO BE.
[2:13:05] SO WHEN WE AS FATHERS HAVE THE RIGHT
[2:13:08] TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR DAUGHTER,
[2:13:12] THEN SHE WANTS TO BE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING
[2:13:14] WE TIE HER TO. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE
[2:13:16] HAVE TO FORCE HER TO. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR
[2:13:19] RELATIONSHIP THAT WE have with her,
[2:13:24] it it it BECAUSE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP,
[2:13:27] she desires
[2:13:29] to be under THAT HEADSHIP. SHE DESIRES
[2:13:32] TO BE IN THE HAND. BUT THERE IS COMING A
[2:13:35] TRANSFER of hands.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Right. There's coming is she's moving
[2:13:42] FROM ONE FORM OF HEADSHIP
[2:13:45] TO ANOTHER form of headship.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONE FORM OF HEADSHIP CANNOT DO
[2:13:52] FOR HER WHAT THIS FORM THAT IS COMING TO
[2:13:55] TAKE HER can do.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; All right. So it's it's it's wonderful.
[2:14:02] Remember, IT'S IT'S THE SAME HOLY Ghost
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; in the Father.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IN THE SON.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S COMING TO TAKE THE BOOK.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; All right. It's It's the IT'S A CHANGE
[2:14:15] OF HEADSHIP. IT'S A CHANGE. NO, IT'S NOT
[2:14:18] A CHANGE OF HEADSHIP. IT'S A CHANGE OF
[2:14:20] THE FORM OF HEADSHIP
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS THE HEADSHIP
[2:14:25] OF THE DAUGHTER THROUGH THE H through
[2:14:28] the father. BUT NOW THE HOLY GHOST IN
[2:14:30] THE IN THE BOY in the MAN IS THE
[2:14:34] HEADSHIP OF THE THE THE BOOK THROUGH A
[2:14:37] SON THROUGH THE OFFICE OF SON.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; We'll get to some pictures maybe tonight
[2:14:48] on that because it's just absolutely
[2:14:51] fabulous. Um,
[2:14:54] in Genesis 2, Adam's wife was originally
[2:14:58] under the leadership of God.
[2:15:04] God the Father.
[2:15:08] It was God
[2:15:11] that brought her to Adam.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Leadership.
[2:15:19] She was under leadership.
[2:15:22] RIGHT.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T FIND HER OWN WAY TO ADAM.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE SAYS GENESIS 2:22 THAT GOD
[2:15:31] BOUGHT THE WOMAN UNTO UNTO ADAM, UNTO
[2:15:33] THE MAN,
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; LEADERSHIP,
[2:15:37] HEADSHIP.
[2:15:39] AND THEN WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? Adam
[2:15:42] was going to step forward
[2:15:45] and take the book. YES,
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN THE
[2:15:49] FORM OF LEADERSHIP.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE THERE HAS TO BE A CHANGE
[2:15:55] IN THE FORM OF LEADERSHIP BECAUSE THE
[2:15:58] CHANGE IN THE FORM OF LEADERSHIP ALLOWS
[2:16:02] THE BOOK TO BE UNSEALED.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; SO, she's going from one hand to another
[2:16:14] hand.
[2:16:16] Um just to tell you a bit of a a story.
[2:16:19] um in had a brother, young brother come
[2:16:21] to me one time and and um he was he was
[2:16:26] courting or or not courting but he was
[2:16:29] just friends with this with sister and
[2:16:31] he'd approached the the the father of
[2:16:34] the daughter and got his approval and
[2:16:37] and uh he he come into my office and he
[2:16:40] said he said uh brother Dan he said I I
[2:16:44] don't think she's the one.
[2:16:46] I said, "Well, that's okay.
[2:16:49] That's that's if she's not the one,
[2:16:51] that's a good revelation to come to."
[2:16:54] But I said, "Tell me why she's not the
[2:16:56] one. Why what what brings you to that
[2:16:59] conclusion?" He said, "Well, well, he's
[2:17:02] he she's she's not coming under my
[2:17:04] headship."
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, boy.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Well, who said she had to?
[2:17:17] Because you're boyfriend and girlfriend,
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; right? This transfer
[2:17:23] is not at boyfriend girlfriend.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; It's it's not at engagement.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; No, this is at the altar.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; This is THIS IS A WEDDING CEREMONY.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. So I explained to him, brother,
[2:17:39] the thing that you are disqualifying her
[2:17:41] for should be the thing that YOU THAT
[2:17:43] QUALIFY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT QUALIFIES
[2:17:46] HER
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE YOU'RE TEMPTING HER. YOU'RE
[2:17:49] TRYING TO PULL HER OUT FROM UNDER HER
[2:17:51] HEADSHIP AND SHE'S SAYING NO. SHE KNOWS
[2:17:54] HER POSITION
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S READY TO BE REVEALED.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ah, he got a bit of a
[2:18:06] surprise and went out of that room
[2:18:07] pretty happy. But
[2:18:09] praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:18:14] So, let's let's look uh at why it is
[2:18:20] important that she is under the
[2:18:23] protection
[2:18:25] by relationship.
[2:18:29] Revelation 5:1. And I saw in the right
[2:18:31] hand of him that sat upon a throne a
[2:18:32] book written with within and on the
[2:18:34] backside sealed with seven seals. And I
[2:18:36] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[2:18:39] loud voice, who is worthy to open the
[2:18:43] book, and to loose the seals thereof.
[2:18:45] And no man in heaven, nor in the earth,
[2:18:48] neither under the earth was able to open
[2:18:50] the book, neither to look thereon. and I
[2:18:53] wept much because no man was found
[2:18:56] worthy to open and to read and neither
[2:19:00] to look thereon. Now I've I've
[2:19:02] highlighted these things down here
[2:19:04] specifically
[2:19:06] because here John here is is saying that
[2:19:10] the one who is worthy will be worthy to
[2:19:13] open.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; He'll be worthy to read her and he'll be
[2:19:18] worthy to look her look look on her.
[2:19:21] only one.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; So, let me just um
[2:19:30] take you to a quotation here.
[2:19:34] And the events that we're we're we're
[2:19:36] seeing taking place is absolutely showed
[2:19:38] in the Bible of every age. We think
[2:19:39] we're all out of cada, but we're not.
[2:19:42] Everything's moving just exactly with
[2:19:43] God's word. Now, the Bible is a
[2:19:46] different book from any other sacred
[2:19:48] book.
[2:19:50] That's right.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; There's not a book like the Bible.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; The book picked up the book
[2:20:05] and revealed the himself as the book in
[2:20:09] Luke 4.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BIBLE,
[2:20:15] we're talking about this. But who is the
[2:20:18] revelation of this?
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Right. We're talking this this is he
[2:20:23] he's I BELIEVE GOD SAID THINGS through
[2:20:25] the prophet just to provoke us to think.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Um but he he he goes on here. There's no
[2:20:32] book like the Bible because the Bible is
[2:20:34] God in word form. It's a word is a
[2:20:38] thought expressed. God's thinking
[2:20:40] expressed it. his words through the
[2:20:44] prophets and they they wrote the Bible
[2:20:47] which is in word form. Okay. So he's
[2:20:52] going as far as the thought. So yeah the
[2:20:56] thought the word but he's not he does
[2:20:59] but in this quote as far as I've gone
[2:21:01] with it he's not talking about the
[2:21:04] manifestation of the word
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; and you are the manifestation of the
[2:21:09] word.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So, SO THIS BOOK IS A SACRED
[2:21:13] BOOK.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; The thought
[2:21:17] that was in the mind of God was a sacred
[2:21:19] thought.
[2:21:21] THE MANIFESTATION of the book is also
[2:21:25] sacred.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this in the FORM OF
[2:21:31] THE BOOK BEING our daughters, IT MEANS
[2:21:34] THAT OUR DAUGHTERS ARE SACRED.
[2:21:41] All right, let's go another step.
[2:21:45] A woman was not even in the was not even
[2:21:47] in the beginning of creation because God
[2:21:50] knowed that she would fall. All other
[2:21:52] females could not commit adultery. She
[2:21:54] is the only one that could commit
[2:21:56] adultery. If she had been made like the
[2:21:59] original, that would be discomplementary
[2:22:01] to God's great wisdom. She's made a
[2:22:04] byproduct of a man. But because she was
[2:22:07] cast over in that side, she has ALSO
[2:22:10] BEEN GIVEN A SACRED CHARGE from God for
[2:22:14] redemption. She's got characteristics
[2:22:16] that she must not defile.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're looking at the
[2:22:22] thought of why why is it why is it that
[2:22:26] she needs protection?
[2:22:30] I mean, is it that because
[2:22:33] I don't want to say the wrong thing, but
[2:22:37] is it because she's clueless?
[2:22:40] IT'S BECAUSE OF HER VALUE.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; The reason that SHE NEEDS HEADSHIP IS
[2:22:48] BECAUSE OF HER VALUE.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; The reason she NEEDS TO BE LOVED IS
[2:22:52] BECAUSE OF HER VALUE.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. CHRIST LOVED YOU
[2:22:59] BECAUSE YOU WERE VALUABLE TO HIM. IT'S
[2:23:02] NOT SOMETHING HE HAD TO DO. IT'S
[2:23:04] SOMETHING HE DESIRED TO DO. IT'S
[2:23:06] SOMETHING THAT HE CHOSE TO DO. IT'S
[2:23:08] SOMETHING THAT he wanted to do.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; All right? Her body is given to her a
[2:23:15] sacred trust from God. NO FEMALE DOG, no
[2:23:19] bird, no other animal, no other creature
[2:23:21] LIKE IT. NO, SHE IS THE only one. But
[2:23:24] but she the reason it is so sacred she
[2:23:26] is to bring forth life into the world
[2:23:30] into the earth. Her body is the bedding
[2:23:34] grounds of life. Therefore that's the
[2:23:37] reason she is given this sacred trust.
[2:23:40] Look what Hollywood has done to the
[2:23:42] women. Look how it is. It's robbed the
[2:23:45] sacred virtues of the women. On and on
[2:23:49] we could go see. All right. So the there
[2:23:52] is the the the re the reason that that
[2:23:55] the father needs to have that loving
[2:23:58] relationship is because of her value and
[2:24:02] her purpose on earth.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:24:06] So I hope the parents are seeing this. I
[2:24:09] I hope you see your daughters as sacred
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; and not just another female on the
[2:24:14] street or another female in the house.
[2:24:17] But I hope you're SEEING YOUR DAUGHTERS
[2:24:19] AS GOD SEES THEM.
[2:24:21] BECAUSE GOD SEES YOUR DAUGHTERS AS
[2:24:23] SACRED VESSELS.
[2:24:26] And when we understand what they are to
[2:24:30] God, then we can form A LEVEL OF
[2:24:33] PROTECTION around them because we
[2:24:36] understand who they are and what they
[2:24:39] are. It's like anything. If you had a
[2:24:42] gold bullion, you wouldn't leave it
[2:24:43] sitting on your letter box,
[2:24:46] right? you would you would HAVE A A FORM
[2:24:48] OF protection around a thing that that
[2:24:52] is valuable to you TO STOP A HOSTILE
[2:24:55] INVASION.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; You you you see you see if if if if
[2:25:01] um someone knew you had 10 uh blocks of
[2:25:05] gold in your house, WELL, YOU'RE YOU'RE
[2:25:07] YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF UP FOR AN
[2:25:09] INVASION,
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE SOMEONE KNOWS THE value
[2:25:13] of WHAT'S THERE. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE AT
[2:25:16] MORE RISK OF BEING INVADED THAN THE GUY
[2:25:21] NEXT DOOR THAT THE BEST THING HE'S GOT
[2:25:23] IS AN OLD RICKETY BIKE,
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S VALUE IN THE
[2:25:27] HOME,
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WELL, THERE'S VALUE IN THE
[2:25:31] BELIEVER'S HOME. THERE'S THERE'S VALUE
[2:25:33] IN MY HOME. AND AND AND AND WHAT I NEED
[2:25:37] TO TO DO IS TO PROTECT MY HOME BECAUSE
[2:25:41] OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I HAVE OF THE
[2:25:43] VALUE THAT'S IN MY HOME.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT'S IN MY HOME, I can
[2:25:53] expect
[2:25:55] someone TO ATTEMPT TO PLUCK THEM OUT OF
[2:26:01] MY HAND. YES,
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; I CAN EXPECT IT
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY'RE VALUABLE.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; WHY ISN'T THE HOUSE UNDER UNDER THE SAME
[2:26:12] SIEGE, UNDER THE SAME ATTACK? THERE'S
[2:26:14] NOTHING VALUABLE THERE.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; BUT MY DAUGHTERS ARE VALUABLE BECAUSE
[2:26:19] THEY'RE DAUGHTERS OF THE LIVING GOD.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; AND SATAN WANTS MY DAUGHTERS.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:30] So, I said this before and I just want
[2:26:32] to give you a little bit of an
[2:26:33] illustration here of the hold that the
[2:26:37] the book um has
[2:26:41] um
[2:26:44] which I'm sure your imagination has
[2:26:46] already gone there but you you you will
[2:26:49] notice in this picture that the book
[2:26:53] holds sorry the hand holds the book
[2:26:57] in such a way that it's not deforming
[2:27:00] the book.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; All right. When fear comes into our
[2:27:05] life, when we try and protect
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; with fear
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; instead of love, we put a grip
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; on that deforms the book,
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; right? It's a it's when you grip when
[2:27:22] you try and hold someone
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; with a legalistic
[2:27:27] hand,
[2:27:28] a legalistic strength, it deforms
[2:27:33] the book, right? And this this is what
[2:27:36] has happened
[2:27:38] in the past
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; in the message.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Right. And then the the
[2:27:44] groom comes forward, takes the deformed
[2:27:49] book
[2:27:51] and he has to take her and restore
[2:27:54] hermen,
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; right? He he has to have a different
[2:27:58] approach. He if he holds her with the
[2:28:02] same grip that her father had,
[2:28:05] the hand will just get stronger and
[2:28:08] it'll continue to deform her, right? But
[2:28:11] but on the on the other hand
[2:28:14] um you know because fear can be
[2:28:17] expressed in two ways and legalism is
[2:28:19] one way but liberalism is actually
[2:28:22] another way.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; All right because because liberalism
[2:28:27] will cause you to compromise
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; on the word because well if I do that
[2:28:35] I'm going to lose my children. Look, if
[2:28:38] you don't do that, you're going to lose
[2:28:40] your children. The the things that GOD
[2:28:43] ASKS YOU TO DO WILL NOT CAUSE YOU TO
[2:28:47] LOSE YOUR CHILDREN.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO. THE THINGS THAT GOD ASKS
[2:28:52] YOU TO DO will not cause you to lose
[2:28:54] your children. So when you have a
[2:28:56] liberal hold, A COMPROMISING HOLD WHICH
[2:29:00] IS STIMULATED FROM FEAR,
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; you loosen the hold
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; and you lose your children
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HOLD them
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; with a compromising hand.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HOLD them with a liberal
[2:29:18] with a liberal hand. So you've you've
[2:29:21] the the hold that we have that we need
[2:29:24] to have is the is a hold that we have by
[2:29:29] revelation.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Because perfect love cast out for you.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; It's by revelation.
[2:29:38] BY THE REVELATION of who they are,
[2:29:42] you can have a relationship with them.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THE FATHER KNEW WHO THE
[2:29:47] BOOK WAS?
[2:29:49] That's right.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. IT WAS THE FATHER'S
[2:29:52] REVELATION OF THE BOOK IS WHY THE BOOK
[2:29:55] REMAINED in the hand of the father.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Right. So you can have a relationship
[2:30:01] with your children that will cause them
[2:30:04] to remain in your hand through the
[2:30:07] revelation of who they are AND THAT THEY
[2:30:10] ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I have a son who's not
[2:30:17] serving the Lord.
[2:30:19] Does that mean I didn't have a right
[2:30:22] hold somewhere?
[2:30:24] Well, potentially
[2:30:27] it could mean that. Potentially it could
[2:30:30] mean that I was one way or the other
[2:30:32] way. But generally, you know, just
[2:30:35] because YOUR CHILDREN GO OUT INTO the
[2:30:37] world doesn't necessarily
[2:30:40] mean that you have had a wrong hold.
[2:30:46] Right?
[2:30:48] BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP
[2:30:51] THAT I HAVE WITH MY son and I've had
[2:30:54] with my son is one of the things that IS
[2:30:59] GOING TO CAUSE HIM TO TURN around and
[2:31:02] come back out of the world that he
[2:31:04] walked into.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; All right? And again, we can go many
[2:31:09] places with with this, but um we we need
[2:31:14] to to finish
[2:31:16] very soon. Um
[2:31:39] So we don't we we want a revelation of
[2:31:42] our children.
[2:31:45] And this is kind of an interesting
[2:31:46] thought because you know when God come
[2:31:50] to Abraham Abram and said you shall be a
[2:31:53] father of many nations and you're going
[2:31:54] to have a son and the promise the
[2:31:57] covenant that I've made with you is with
[2:31:59] you and your children.
[2:32:03] Abraham could look at Isaac
[2:32:06] with the revelation of who he was
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; as a child in in in
[2:32:18] um in in his hands. Isaac could take
[2:32:22] that child and look at that child and
[2:32:25] and know that there was a promise
[2:32:27] attached to that child.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:31] through the word.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; Right. And this promise
[2:32:36] is to you and your children.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; So your your Isaac become a revelation
[2:32:43] was a revelation to Abraham.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; That no it it doesn't matter. I don't
[2:32:50] need to worry. I don't need to fear. I
[2:32:53] don't need to be legal. And I don't need
[2:32:55] to compromise. This this child has the
[2:32:58] same promise attached to it that I have
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROMISE SAME PROMISE that
[2:33:04] was given to Abraham was also given to
[2:33:06] Isaac and the same promise that is given
[2:33:09] to me is also given to my children. So I
[2:33:13] can look at my son in the condition that
[2:33:15] he IS AND DENY ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
[2:33:20] EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN HIS LIFE,
[2:33:22] the the moods, the whatever ELSE THERE
[2:33:25] IS. I I CAN PUT THAT THERE ARE SIMPLY
[2:33:27] JUST CIRCUMSTANCES because I have a word
[2:33:30] that says this promise is to you and
[2:33:33] your children. SO I CAN LOOK AT MY child
[2:33:37] as someone the same as what I am a son
[2:33:41] or a seed of the most high.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the the same promise. So when
[2:33:47] our children become a revelation to us
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; then we don't need to worry. BUT THAT
[2:33:53] MEANS THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE can
[2:33:55] compromise,
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; right? But it doesn't mean that we need
[2:33:58] to be legal BECAUSE PERFECT LOVE CASTS
[2:34:02] out fear. Perfect love casts out
[2:34:04] legalism. PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT uh
[2:34:07] liberalism, the compromising spirit. All
[2:34:10] right? SO, BUT PERFECT LOVE KEEPS YOU ON
[2:34:12] THE WORD. You live by the word. You
[2:34:15] apply the word. You teach the word
[2:34:18] knowing that within them is a seed that
[2:34:20] is able to receive the word. A AND
[2:34:23] EVERYTHING MAY TESTIFY THAT THERE'S NOT.
[2:34:29] Think about the Apostle Paul.
[2:34:32] What what WAS THERE TO TESTIFY that he
[2:34:35] had something within him that was able
[2:34:37] to receive the word for his day?
[2:34:42] There was nothing.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; NOTHING FROM OUTSIDE. WHAT WAS THERE IN
[2:34:46] GIDEON? WHAT WAS THERE IN ABRAM? WHAT
[2:34:49] WAS THERE IN SARAI? WHAT WAS THERE IN
[2:34:51] MOSES? WHAT WAS THERE IN NOAH? WHAT WHAT
[2:34:54] WAS THERE IN MARY? WHAT WHAT ON THE
[2:34:56] OUTSIDE ON THE ON THE EXTERNAL? WHAT WAS
[2:34:58] WHAT DID ANYONE HAVE THAT COULD TESTIFY
[2:35:01] that they had the ability TO SEE THE THE
[2:35:04] WORD FOR THEIR DAY AND ACCEPT IT?
[2:35:08] No one had anything. And neither did
[2:35:10] you. Neither did you. That's right.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, YEAH. BUT MY DAD WAS A PREACHER. MY
[2:35:14] DAD WAS SO WHAT?
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE THE THAT
[2:35:18] THAT'S NOT YOUR GATEWAY TO HEAVEN.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; Right. None of us had anything that
[2:35:26] testified that we had the ability to
[2:35:29] receive the word for our day. But when
[2:35:31] the word of God spoke, there was
[2:35:33] something in us that connected with that
[2:35:35] word.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did Jesus have a revelation of the
[2:35:38] woman at the well? Was there anything
[2:35:42] that the that that in the woman at the
[2:35:44] well's life that testified that she had
[2:35:46] anything to receive the word for her
[2:35:49] day?
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely 100% not. But he could see
[2:35:53] it.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; He could see it. AND WHEN HE SPOKE THE
[2:35:57] WORD, HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; in her.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; He actually introduced himself to her in
[2:36:08] her.
[2:36:12] because it wasn't her,
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; it was him in her
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; responding to the word.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:36:21] So, I'm going to finish in a moment here
[2:36:23] on the on the daughters and we're going
[2:36:25] to um move into the to the to the sun.
[2:36:31] But the the point we we just want to
[2:36:33] finish with here is that the the the
[2:36:36] when the book is under headship,
[2:36:42] if the right one when the right one
[2:36:44] comes along, she's ready for the change
[2:36:47] in headship.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; If the book is a free floating book,
[2:36:55] I don't need a man. I don't need a dad.
[2:36:58] I don't need this. I don't need that.
[2:37:00] Well, I have a question for the brother.
[2:37:01] What on earth are you doing marrying
[2:37:03] someone who doesn't need a man?
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Right. But a woman that is a free
[2:37:08] roaming woman, not under headship, is
[2:37:11] not ready for headship.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; It's not even that she she It's not even
[2:37:17] that she may not be yours.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; I can tell you another story. This is
[2:37:24] Yeah. I I can tell you another story of
[2:37:26] a young man who who um who went to
[2:37:29] another part of Australia. Um he he he
[2:37:33] just connected with this this uh lady
[2:37:38] who had been in church uh all her life
[2:37:41] backsliden out in the world. Um nothing
[2:37:45] to testify on her at all um that she was
[2:37:49] a a message believer or in the message.
[2:37:53] I don't think she cut her hair. That was
[2:37:54] about the only thing. But but um this
[2:37:57] young man comes back to me and he says,
[2:37:59] "Uh, brother Dan," he says, "I've I've
[2:38:01] I've seen someone and for some reason
[2:38:05] I've connected um with her. We were in a
[2:38:09] in a group. They went out to a
[2:38:10] restaurant for for dinner and and um he
[2:38:13] just got talking to her over the table
[2:38:16] and he didn't get her number. He didn't
[2:38:18] text her, anything like that." All
[2:38:20] right. So, but uh but um he said I've uh
[2:38:25] I don't I don't know. I don't know. But
[2:38:28] he said, "Is it possible for me to
[2:38:30] connect with someone
[2:38:33] um and
[2:38:35] and she be the right right one but not
[2:38:38] in the right place?"
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, as a type of the bride of
[2:38:43] Christ, weren't we all that way?"
[2:38:47] like did did God come to any of us
[2:38:50] because we were in the right place? Not
[2:38:53] a one.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Not a not a one. So I said so I said
[2:38:57] yeah there there there is that
[2:38:59] possibility. But he said he he said well
[2:39:02] he said I guess I'm just going to have
[2:39:04] to wait to see what happens.
[2:39:08] I said yeah you are. You're going to
[2:39:12] have to wait to see what happens. Cuz
[2:39:15] this is this is just my opinion. I don't
[2:39:18] I don't think a man or a woman should
[2:39:20] join themselves as boyfriend or
[2:39:23] girlfriend until
[2:39:26] you know who they are
[2:39:29] because emotions can run.
[2:39:32] Um she can come to church and this is
[2:39:34] what happened.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. this this young girl ended up
[2:39:38] ended up coming to church and and um so
[2:39:42] he he he comes back to me, the young man
[2:39:45] comes back to me and just wants to fill
[2:39:47] me in and he says, "Bro Dan," he says,
[2:39:49] "I know that she's come to church, but I
[2:39:51] want you to know that that doesn't mean
[2:39:53] anything to me."
[2:39:56] I said, "Praise the Lord.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord."
[2:40:00] Um he he wanted more than a churchgoer,
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; right? But you you think the devil's not
[2:40:06] cunning.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; You know that you think the devil's
[2:40:09] trying to woo our children in the bars
[2:40:11] and at and at at the parks. NO. HE COMES
[2:40:14] TO church
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; in the FORM OF A FEMALE AND THE FORM OF
[2:40:19] A MALE.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; He comes to get both our sisters and our
[2:40:23] brothers
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; any way that he can.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; So So the young man he he says, "Look,
[2:40:28] that that doesn't mean anything to me."
[2:40:30] So she comes to church Sunday,
[2:40:32] Wednesday, Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday,
[2:40:34] every service, every service. Um, she
[2:40:37] she comes to me after a little while and
[2:40:39] tears rolling down her face and she
[2:40:41] says, "I want to get baptized."
[2:40:44] Young man comes back to me and says,
[2:40:45] "But Dan, I'm thankful that she got
[2:40:47] baptized, but I just want you to know
[2:40:49] that that doesn't mean anything to me."
[2:40:53] That my what is GOING ON? THIS IS
[2:40:56] FANTASTIC,
[2:40:58] RIGHT? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU SEEN
[2:41:01] BAPTIZED?
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; You go down a sinner, you come up a wet
[2:41:05] one.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; So, he wanted more than a churchgoer.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; All right. He he wanted HE WANTED MORE
[2:41:14] THAN SOMEONE WHO who had tears rolling
[2:41:17] down her face. And this is WHAT I'M
[2:41:19] SAYING. YOU BE CAREFUL, BROTHERS AND
[2:41:21] SISTERS. YOU BE CAREFUL. AND SOMETIMES
[2:41:24] IT'S THE PARENTS
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; THAT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE emotion
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; of what is happening. BUT LET ME TELL
[2:41:32] YOU, this is a good sermon title. The
[2:41:35] difference between emotion and
[2:41:37] revelation.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; EMOTION. THERE CAN BE EMOTION in
[2:41:41] revelation. There should be, RIGHT? BUT
[2:41:43] EMOTION BY ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY
[2:41:46] REVELATION. OH, I LOVE YOU.
[2:41:52] All right. So, the young man goes on and
[2:41:56] so she gets she gets um
[2:42:00] see she's changed from shorts, I mean
[2:42:03] short shorts to to long long long
[2:42:08] dresses. Um she's changed from skimpy
[2:42:11] tops to um moral tops and you know every
[2:42:16] everything looks right.
[2:42:19] everything is just it it LOOKS RIGHT,
[2:42:23] BUT IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN LOOK RIGHT.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; SO, time went on and time went on and
[2:42:28] time went on and time went on and and uh
[2:42:32] the brother comes back to me and he
[2:42:33] says, "Bad Dan,"
[2:42:36] he said, "I've even tried to ignore her
[2:42:42] deliberately
[2:42:44] to see if she would leave church."
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:42:48] But he said after a little while he said
[2:42:51] I realize
[2:42:53] that she has become a revelation to me.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. beautiful
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; and I believe that she is mine.
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; Not because of this and because of that,
[2:43:10] because of this and because of that,
[2:43:13] but she became a revelation to him.
[2:43:19] I wonder
[2:43:21] if the lamb, the book was a revelation
[2:43:24] to the lamb.
[2:43:26] I wonder if it was the revelation that
[2:43:30] the lamb had of the book that caused him
[2:43:33] to do what he had to do to get the book.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; We're going to go into that this this
[2:43:39] this evening. But what about the book?
[2:43:46] What about can the book become a have a
[2:43:49] revelation of the lamb?
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:43:55] Can Can that be the reason that she does
[2:43:58] what she does?
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; Because he's a revelation to her.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:44:08] though that that couple,
[2:44:12] they got together and they started their
[2:44:14] courtship and went through their
[2:44:16] engagement and now they're they're
[2:44:18] happily happily married. But one one one
[2:44:23] thing that happened with with her is she
[2:44:25] didn't have
[2:44:27] a a father that was in a position to
[2:44:32] um know whether she could accept
[2:44:34] headship or not.
[2:44:37] And uh her mother wasn't around either.
[2:44:41] So
[2:44:44] my query was how do I know if she can
[2:44:48] respect headship?
[2:44:51] So what happened was
[2:44:54] I became
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; her father.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; I took the position
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; of father in her life.
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; And I set boundaries deliberately
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; for her that
[2:45:10] she she
[2:45:12] just didn't she Yeah. No problem. if
[2:45:16] that's what you want me to do that I was
[2:45:18] I was expecting retaliation, right? But
[2:45:21] clearly this woman was a revelation to
[2:45:24] herself
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; because once she becomes a revelation to
[2:45:28] herself and she knows that she needs
[2:45:30] headship because the book can't can't
[2:45:34] change hands unless it's in a hand.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Because the book is in a hand, it can
[2:45:41] change hands. But until the book is in a
[2:45:44] hand, it can't change hands.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; So, so this Yeah, that that that story
[2:45:53] is actually my son
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; and now my daughter-in-law who happy
[2:45:59] married with three kids.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; And this is what I'm saying. Is the book
[2:46:04] in the home?
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; The book is in the home.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; The book is in the home. My my my
[2:46:11] daughter Charity, she's very different
[2:46:13] to Melody. Mel Melody would dress in
[2:46:17] anything like as in she didn't have to
[2:46:21] look nice. She would always dress
[2:46:24] morally, but she didn't care whether her
[2:46:26] hair was
[2:46:28] whether she had morning hair or
[2:46:30] afternoon hair or she didn't care.
[2:46:35] the charity. My youngest daughter, she
[2:46:39] she she
[2:46:41] dresses
[2:46:44] very nicely. She's got to look nice all
[2:46:48] the time. If she's had a hat on, she
[2:46:52] won't take her hat off under any
[2:46:55] circumstances unless she's in her room
[2:46:58] so she can redo her hair,
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; right? She's just got to look that way.
[2:47:03] And John's very happy about that because
[2:47:06] he he likes to see her looking that way.
[2:47:08] So that's that's the one that she's
[2:47:10] cing. They're cording each other at the
[2:47:12] moment. But um just a bit of a story
[2:47:15] about your power of relationship
[2:47:20] uh with the with the parents to the to
[2:47:22] their daughter. Um because she likes to
[2:47:26] dress nice. She likes to shop.
[2:47:30] Because how can you dress nice unless
[2:47:32] you like Melody's happy to go to the op
[2:47:34] shop? Well, Charity's not happy to go to
[2:47:36] the op shop. I'm not wearing someone
[2:47:38] else's stinky clothes, you know. I want
[2:47:40] I want new stuff. Yeah. So, and because
[2:47:45] because she likes to stop shop, she
[2:47:48] comes into contact with spirits,
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; right? Because Hollywood is the designer
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; of of the clothing. So, you know,
[2:47:58] because because of who she is, she is
[2:48:01] she is tempted in a way that Melody
[2:48:04] wasn't. We had to look after Melody in
[2:48:06] other ways. All right. But but so so um
[2:48:11] Charity would go shopping
[2:48:13] and she knew what I liked and didn't
[2:48:17] like. We talked about clothes.
[2:48:20] Don't leave it to your daughter to guess
[2:48:22] what you like.
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; Fathers, mothers, talk about it. Tell
[2:48:26] Tell them if I don't mean sit them down,
[2:48:29] come into my office. Um, I've got a
[2:48:31] slideshow of the clothes I like and
[2:48:33] don't like. No, no. Take them to the
[2:48:35] beach, buy them an ice cream, say, "Hey,
[2:48:37] you you look really nice this morning."
[2:48:40] JUST DON'T MAKE IT OFFICIAL. Don't make
[2:48:42] it formal.
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; All right. BUT YOU'RE BY TELLING THEM,
[2:48:46] YOU'RE LETTING THEM KNOW. IT'S THE SAME
[2:48:47] WITH MY I DO THE WE SHOULD DO THE SAME
[2:48:48] WITH OUR WOW, DARLING, YOU LOOK nice to
[2:48:51] the to the today. You know what they'll
[2:48:53] do when they'll go shopping? They'll go
[2:48:56] shopping looking for the clothes that
[2:48:57] you said they look nice in.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; So, Charity goes to the shop as she does
[2:49:03] and she she pulls out a a dress. Ah, I
[2:49:07] don't know the difference between dress
[2:49:08] and a skirt, but she pulls out a dress
[2:49:11] and and it looks nice and she goes into
[2:49:14] the the the change room and she puts it
[2:49:16] on and this is her telling the story.
[2:49:17] Okay, she she puts it on and and um it's
[2:49:21] it's it's tight,
[2:49:25] right? But because she likes to look
[2:49:28] nice, she's looking at herself as
[2:49:29] looking nice with this tight dress on.
[2:49:34] BUT THEN SHE remembers me,
[2:49:38] right? The power of relationship
[2:49:42] because because she knows what I like.
[2:49:47] Because she knows as she's looking in
[2:49:50] the mirror, she's thinking,
[2:49:52] "Dad's not going to like this."
[2:49:57] She takes it off, puts it back on the
[2:49:59] hanger, puts it back in the rack because
[2:50:03] of our relationship.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; Because of the power of relationship. Do
[2:50:09] not underestimate the power of
[2:50:12] relationship that you have with your
[2:50:16] daughters and sons
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; for that matter.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; I believe it's it for my son. I believe
[2:50:23] we we do the same. We we we we've done
[2:50:26] the same when they were growing up. We
[2:50:27] taught them what we like and what we
[2:50:29] don't like. And now, you know, he's
[2:50:31] living at home with with us has been for
[2:50:33] the last year and a half, you know, and
[2:50:35] and he knows what we like in the home
[2:50:37] and what we don't like in the home. I
[2:50:39] don't have to tell him what I don't like
[2:50:41] in the home. He just doesn't bring it
[2:50:42] into the home.
[2:50:45] &gt;&gt; So, there there is that respect. Yeah.
[2:50:47] His room just looks like a total pigsty
[2:50:49] at times. And sometimes I feel like
[2:50:51] taking the door off so it can just air
[2:50:53] out a bit. But but you know that's just
[2:50:55] boy things.
[2:50:58] It's just men men can live in a in a I
[2:51:01] guess some men can live can live in
[2:51:04] conditions that a sister would just run
[2:51:06] from. But that's why we get married. H
[2:51:09] they're they straighten us out a bit in
[2:51:11] that way. They that's why we have help.
[2:51:13] They're our helpmate. You know, my my my
[2:51:16] cuz. Cuz I can guarantee you none of you
[2:51:17] sisters would sleep on the bed that he
[2:51:19] sleeps on.
[2:51:21] It's filthy.
[2:51:24] But praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:51:28] Amen. So, the power of relationship.
[2:51:31] Amen. Sisters,
[2:51:34] what's your position in relationship to
[2:51:37] your parents? Because the the position
[2:51:41] the the position in relationship to your
[2:51:43] parents testifies
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; of whether you are ready for marriage or
[2:51:50] not. Okay. Now you're you may not have
[2:51:54] parents but you have a if you attend
[2:51:56] this church you have a wonderful pastor.
[2:52:00] wonderful pastor and he would be more
[2:52:03] than happy
[2:52:05] to take that position in your life if
[2:52:08] you don't have anyone else to take that
[2:52:10] position. It's the same with sister uh
[2:52:13] sister Priscilla. She she's as the
[2:52:16] pastor's wife. If you don't if you don't
[2:52:18] have a mom,
[2:52:20] she's happy to be your mom.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; All right. She's happy to to to take
[2:52:26] that role in your life. And my wife and
[2:52:30] I, we do it. We do it. And the amount of
[2:52:36] times
[2:52:39] um we we have it it has See, you know,
[2:52:44] you know how the enemy works, huh? The
[2:52:46] enemy picks out the vulnerable.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; You you watch a story of a of a hyena or
[2:52:52] someone who's who's looking for for a
[2:52:54] meal. you know, they they're they're
[2:52:56] able to sense
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; the weak ones,
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; the ones who who who uh don't have the
[2:53:04] protection that they need to be. And
[2:53:06] then they get that herd running and then
[2:53:09] the weak one falls back
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; and it becomes isolated and then the
[2:53:14] they come in for the kill,
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; you know. And that's that's the same
[2:53:18] thing that can happen in a in a church
[2:53:20] scenario where it's it's often the weak
[2:53:23] ones that that that fall back. Those
[2:53:26] that don't have the protection that they
[2:53:29] need, those that don't have the the
[2:53:31] support that they need, the mother and
[2:53:32] father that they need. It's them that
[2:53:35] that fall back. And it's it's them that
[2:53:37] the te the the devil attempts
[2:53:41] attempts to take because as a pastor the
[2:53:45] pastor is the door.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; As a father you fathers are the door to
[2:53:51] your home.
[2:53:53] &gt;&gt; No one no one can gain no one should be
[2:53:56] able to gain access to your children but
[2:53:59] they come through you.
[2:54:02] Amen.

[2:54:05] brother.
