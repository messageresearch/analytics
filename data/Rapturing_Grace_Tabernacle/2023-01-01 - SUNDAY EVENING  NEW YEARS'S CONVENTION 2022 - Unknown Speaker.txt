And while we're standing, let's open the word of the Lord. Amen. And um what a what a wonderful time we have. And hallelujah. Thank really all the those who work behind the scenes and before the scenes. And my prayer is that we are not too to too to too to too tired this afternoon, but we're just fixing our eyes to to the Lord Jesus. And we we are reading in First Kings chapter 19 verse 10. First Kings chapter 19 verse 10. And he said, "I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts. For the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I only am left, and they seek my life to take it away." And he says, "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord." And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind the mountains, and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice. And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle, went out and stood in the entering of the cave. And behold, there came a voice unto him and said, "What dust thou hear, Elijah?" May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his word. We may be seated. Hallelujah. It's a great honor for me to minister again this afternoon to you. I really thought that uh part of you were already would it have went home but it seems that we are that many many people still left. May the Lord richly bless you and uh it's a great honor for me to be among here. Uh I told brother Away I really didn't had had on my heart to come. I was just tired and I wanted to stay home and wanted to be with the family and so forth. I I came just by friendship to him because he was asking different times and and I said come you cannot let your friend down but today I'm happy that I came [laughter] really happy and so God bless you all richly and it's a great honor for me to be just part of the family of God and uh happy to see the new faith brother east and brother Ferdy and their families and really really wonderful people here in New Zealand. I I don't know why all the sympathic people are here in New Zealand. I I sometimes sometimes we have to mix it a little bit worldwide but God has a wonderful bride wherever they wherever wherever God's word is revealed and God has wonderful people everywhere. God bless you richly. If you wouldn't mind I enter directly into the subject and because I have something on my heart which is very very dear this afternoon and for tomorrow. I mean all the services are very dear but uh I would like to talk something that I never read in books but something that I found in the message and which is part of my ministry for the moment and before I entering into this I just always want to say please keep in mind uh uh when when when we have 90 minutes I mean we spoke speak about the theophony there's a lot of things that brother blame a lot of aspect we cannot cover them okay it's it's it's it's it's just to give a give a general thought about the what we call the general the changing of dispensation and uh please keep all these things in mind brother said many many things about that and there's a lot of aspects that could not be covered like this but here is a thought that I would like to to to to share with you uh what I was saying this morning about you have to understand God thinks from the end to the beginning he does not only know the end but he thinks back. Huh? And here is uh here is a little proof in the Bible. It's the it's it's the song of Moses. The song of Moses is not actually Moses song. It was God's song that he dictated to Moses. It was God's song and it tells the story of the Jews from the beginning till the end. Okay? It tells how God chosen them, how they will fall back, all these things. the whole story of the Jews till the end is in the is in the song of Moses. And he even says and you can see Revelation 19. I can see everything right in if you just read with an open heart. But here he says for example in verse 26 in in Deuteronomy he said I would scatter them into corners. I would make the remembrance of them to seize from among men. Look, even the Holocaust is foreshadowed. That's right. Amen. Because the Holocaust was not Hitler's idea. It was God's idea. Amen. The Jews are the only people. They always try to be scattered away and always tried tried to to to seize their remembrance from among men. But then there is a little left over and God continue his way. Amen. So, so Hitler and all these people, they were just fulfilling [clears throat] what God had already prophesied over them. Huh? But then at the end, at the end of the book of Moses, you see everything in God has a happy end. He says, "Rejoice all you nations with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance to his adversaries. He will be merciful unto his land and to his people. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Therefore, I think it was Ben Gurion. He said, "We are the the people of the book and of the land." All right. Amen. God never forgot what he's told about them to bring them back to give them to to to be merciful at the end to them. So, that is how God sees the bride. Therefore, what we're hearing this morning, therefore, brother Ben Brandon could say, I I do not know if you understand what I'm saying now, but I call you now bride in the seventh seal. Not only church, I call you bride. And you would say, I don't feel like a bride, but God says, I see you already. You the the thing that you perceive of yourself is nothing else than a mirage. You are not the one that you think that you are. You are the one that God thinks you are because life messed you up. Life life messed me up. Therefore, we are never talking. We were not preaching to polish the outside man. Amen. We are preaching to in inspire the inside man. If the inside man is right, the outside man comes into subjection. But it takes its time. So don't think that somebody says, "My theophony is working. and I'm still smoking that we're not talking about this. If if if the inside mind is fed up if it's fed and you will nourish it and it will grow I mean it will have an effect on the outside man. But the more you polish the outside man doesn't mean that the inside man is growing becomes just more religious not more. So be a dove and start from the inside to the outside. Can you say amen? Amen. That's so important because because uh now here I give you an example or here I give you a proof for every young person if he if if he has the Holy Spirit or not. Brother Bram said there is an inner man who is craving for those vitamins. That's the reason you love to eat to read the message. Amen. and to read the book and to write read the Bible and to pray and to come to church because there's something inside who needs these kind of vitamins. Can you say amen? Blessed be the name of the Lord. So you will see how God works and and I will start directly go into into some kind of of of a of a of a of a of a coaching this morning. Okay. again. So, we have a little bit of a special service with a little bit of a video, but it's just wonderful. And I thank you too that you take me the way I am. You know, God made me a little bit special, a little bit a jokey a jokey German. You don't find always a jokey German. You [laughter] when I'm going sometime to the US, I say I always say I have more haha spirit than you. [laughter] But behind be behind my jokes is always a serious message. Do you remember? I'm not a clown. I have something to say. But I have a certain way of sometime breaking a little bit the ice and take the tensions away and and and and Okay. So what we have is is I will especially I want to speak to all of you but especially to young people who want to marry. Okay. That means to all young people, all who will marry, all who will think to have children one day. I want to speak especially to you. I have one couple here. Amen. Uh uh haha, brother Mary's daughter and our precious brother. But I certainly there are different others in the pipeline. Okay. Wants to marry. So we wish you already from this side the very very best. God bless your marriage. I want to speak all of you h who are in the start of their journey of life. Now brother Brandham preaches about that scripture in the message 1959 what does thou hear Elijah and there is two titles which are similar. He preaches what does thou hear Elijah and what does thou hear? What are you doing here? What does thou hear Elijah? That was the last year when brother Brandham mentions his life testimony after the opening of the seals. Brother Brenham doesn't speak about himself anymore. All right. I mean because now a greater than William Brandham is here. Brother Bren doesn't give his life story after the opening of the seal because you know one thing the ministry of Eleaza now is there to connect the bride with the bridegroom. It's a difference and I learned it from brother from our brother. Once you find your position, once you find your purpose in life, you stop chasing your own tail. As a minister, as a brother, as a father, as a mother, once you find your place in God, you stop chasing your own tail. And I want to say this, you can only help people if you stop chasing your own tail. You can only be affected in God's economy if we're not constantly standing in our own way. Can you say amen? We have to come to peace with ourselves. Then I can take care of others. Blessed be the name of the Lord. This message has a transforming power. I've seen it over and over. I can today say there is nothing too hard for God. But it is a process. It's not that that Santa Claus comes from Germany, lays hands on you and then and then and then the problems will be solved. It will be your fighting with the angel yourself. There is nobody who comes with some special meeting and here comes Superman. He has some super preaching and he has an S and and then he goes and we have to invite the man back next year so that we are Superman. It's not so we are inspiring one another but you have to wrestle with that angel yourself. Therefore, maybe I'm a little bit strong. I'm a little bit hard. You have a right to stream but be sure it has no value because it will become entertainment for you. Hallelujah. You must take your time of prayer and eating the book and getting into the message and whatever. If not, you are just entertained by some and you and you get the new kick. Oh, tremendous, tremendous, tremend. Amen. You have a right to do everything, but it's not prophetist many times. Amen. We see that the prophet Elijah, he was a melancholic type of a person. And we see that he was a tremendous man who killed 400 of these priests. And when he did this, he got an email from Jezebel. I told when I was preaching Esther was a very special person. Amen. Martin Luther said uh the book of Esther should be uh thrown into into into the river because for him Esther the book of Esther first it was too Jewish was his her first problem. that it was too feminine and then it was too there was the name of the Lord God was never mentioned in the book of Esther and Jesus never mentions the book of Esther. Paul never mentions the book of Esther. Amen. But brother Brennan was the first messenger preaching about Esther. And he and he calls it the marriage of the lamb in typing this is a special time. This is bride age. This is a special time. Blessed be the name. And Esther was the only in a positive sense only woman in the Bible who was called a queen. David never had a queen. He had women. Solomon had never a queen. He had women. Amen. Amen. Jezebel was never called queen Jezebel. Just Jezebel. Esther was the only queen in a pos there was queenalia but but in a positive way. Esther was the only queen because Esther types the bride. Amen. But but but when he got that email, he he was running into the desert and brother Bram said this. The same man, the same religion, the same God, but now the anointing left the man and he was just running away. Amen. And he took his friend Ghazy with him. And after some time he told Ghazy, "Ghazy, look man, [clears throat] let you stay here. Let me go into the wilderness for a for for for for a day to be by myself." Brother Ram said there was nothing wrong with the prophet Elijah, but his nerves were at the end. You must understand we are we are consisting of body, soul, and spirits. You can take it either way. spirit body. We know what we want. We we know if we want to understand the message, we understand. Okay. So he said people who are in that condition, frustrated, depressed, overworked. Brother Brandham in the 60s speaks about a sickness what we would call today burn out. He says people in that condition they want to be alone. That is the moment when they leave church. That is the moment when they need a veil, a big fish to take them over and carry them a little bit through. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So he said, "Let me be alone." Brother Bam said, "The stress of today makes the people tired in the message, what what dust thou hear, Elijah?" And brother Bam said this, "I never spoke to so much tired people than today." Oh, hallelujah. We eat better than ever. Better more more calories. More green food, whatever. Which is fine. We are better fed than ever, but we are more tired than ever. It's not the It's not the food. It's not the coke. Amen. But it's the pressure from an unseen world that makes people tired. Therefore, I said this morning, you must find your oasis on Sunday. To really slow down to to come down and to deal with things that are eternal. And brother Bam says, "Our bodies are strong, but they need rest from time to time." Quote of the prophet Hallelujah. In this message, he said there is some people they think they can always run and run and run and run and they will find out that they that they will break down soon because these bodies need rest from time to time. Life is a balance of all things and everyone has to charge his battery from time to time. And here is that prophet. He's he left the anointing. He's so depressed. And brother Bram said he he he he he he uh uh uh uh his nerves were at the edge. In reality, brother Bram speaks about himself in that message. He said, "I'm exactly there under that juniper tree." Speaks about himself. I could now waste my time, but I will not do about 400 prophets, 400 people in Chicago that that that that always the same parallel. Okay? But we we're wasting not. Amen. So what happened is this while he was in that situation he wanted to die and sometimes it's not a dying physically but sometime people want to die spiritually. Amen. Amen. Is that brother Gloin? Oh wow brother gone. Good to see you. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They want to die spiritually. Okay. So what happens is and here is something that you have to keep in your mind. God never sent a social worker. I was preaching this morning about the theophony and about the word that is in the bride which brings a transform transformation. So that you understand psychology is not our way. But you have to understand the psyche of a person to understand to help that person. Amen. Huh. From there on, we see that God sent an angel down. And the and the Bible says he just made him to sleep. Amen. And brother Ram said the the the trees around him were full of angels. I hope that you know that you're never alone. Even if you don't see, if you don't feel, you're never alone. Brother Ramy said when Moses arrived at the Red Sea, he said those angels were everywhere just waiting for a command. In 2023, you're not alone. Hallelujah, brother. If you have a website or no website, you're not alone. If you have if you have uh whatever Amen. If you have hotspot or not, here is your hotspot anyhow. Amen. [applause] So he woke up and he let him sleep again. And then when he woke up again, that angel had a special food. And brother Bam said, "I want to know what kind of vitamins were in those cookies." Because the prophet Elijah, he was running for 40 days and 40 nights. Hallelujah. And you must understand the message that we believe is Red Bull. [cheering] The message we are not a sect. Why should we become sectarian? We are not a denomination. Why should we become denominational? We are not a cult. Why should we become a cultish? What is the message of the hour? Is it a doctrine? Is it a religion? It's our father speaking to us. Brother, brother, we Germans, we don't cry much, honestly. Only in football. [laughter] But but and and I'm sure you're not crying. You're not too emotional here. See the man here? You're a real masculine man. You're not crying too much. Amen. But one thing is sure, when we were reading the life story of Brother Ben, we start we cried. Is that correct? When about me and whatever, we were crying because that was our story because we find out we're in the family of brother Brian. That's our brother. Can you say amen? We were crying because that was something that touched our heart. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You find out that that when a person passes away when he dies and he said and is so said by medicine the last the last sense that he has is the hearing and they found out if a young boy falls into a coma or a girl and for example the boy is a Michael Jackson fan you put Michael Jackson on his ears and by the voice that he likes so much She comes back eventually. I told the church if I fall into coma, you know what you put on my ears [laughter] because it's not the voice of brother Brandham. But we have something in us to have the voice in the voice brother. That's our father speaking to us. Amen. So the message is red bull for our hearts. Yeah. With that word we are running to the rapture and to the millennium and to the great times hereafter. Now what happened to the prophet Elijah tied to Revelation chapter 10 when the mighty angel comes down and he has something to eat for the brides. Ah he here you have something to eat. Eat it and you can run. Can you say amen? Amen. So, so, so in that sense, this message has the answer for all our question because it's not William Brennham's idea. It is not William Brandham's wisdom. It is God speaking to a dying generation. Brother Brandham was just a voice. But receive it as God's word. Now the second thing as an introduction that we go through these slides is to is to share a testimony which is tragic but it's true. A minister in our in our a good friend of mine is a pastor. He has a clear orientation to Pentecostalism but it's a good friend of mine. He came to me and said, "Brother Marcus, we had a we had an affair in my in our church that we had a youth camp. We were all rejoicing and a young girl uh started crying hysterically and she came to my wife and then she confessed she was abused by her own uncle. Both are in the message. Both are in the same church. I mean there was even a picture of brother Blam and of Christ and all these things in the room where she was abused different times. She goes now to the parents and the parents as as it was an African family, a central African family, the parents said, "You shouldn't say anybody about that." H and the girl found out that the uh that the reputation of the family was more important for them than the soul of their own daughter. And that made them her to crack. And the pastor is a more Pentecostal orientated person. But he told me this to me. He said, "Marcus, I tell you one thing. I believe in laying on of hands. I believe in healing." There's not a question at all. But that girl was not wounded in her body. That girl was wounded in her soul. And I found out I cannot take that girl, lay hands, and say, "God bless you. Never done. The Lord be with you." I said, "We have now to deal with that situation." Hallelujah. That girl doesn't need a slogan. That girl needs healing. And now the question is, it must be in the message. And this message gave us a lot of tools to deal with situation. Brother, we were we were we were Pentecostals before. For us was everything was laying on our hands and [snorts] and and an altar call. That was the only instrument that we know like in the middle ages the only thing that you could do is uh cutting a person that he loses a little bit of blood. Whatever sickness what it was always we take a little bit of blood and that that's what it but now we have a range of possibilities and therefore put on your spiritual jacket. Okay. Can you say amen? Amen. There's no problem. And I want to tell you one thing. We will be confronted with situations in our churches that we not dreamed about 10 years ago. And you should not be naive about that. It comes. It's on the way. But if the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord prepared already. Okay. Amen. So please if if the technician help me. So every everybody is doing fine. I'm you are leaning back. All is well. It's just a message. Okay. So the the the very message that we believe started with healing. Do not fear. I'm sent from the presence of God to tell you that your peculiar birth and peculiar life has been to indicate that you are taking a gift of divine healings to the people of the world. If you will get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray, there will be nothing standing before your prayers. Hallelujah. That is God's nature. Amen. Brother, young person, God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you desire it because God loves to give. That's his nature. That's again, keep this in my in mind. I know that I said a a sentence this morning that came back to me. I have to correct it. A village can have two message churches, can have three message churches, can have five message. That's not the problem. But the way how we are dealing with one another, brother, we have young people. They left we say they they they uh [snorts] uh uh uh they are just renegades. No, no. You know what their testimony is? Amen. We saw people that we know from random tabernacle and we were not allowed even to greet them because they didn't belong to our local church. Brother that is in the message today. Amen. Amen. So the question is if there's different message churches are we praying for one another? Because look our children they are watching us. We cannot fool them. We cannot tell them a story. Can we say look here is another group but uh let's visit them from time to time. Let's invite them from time to time. Let's pray together. Let's have a communion together. We differ on certain things but we are family of God. Can you say amen? So I hope that I could correct myself because because the nature of our father as brother Brandham when these people came you could feel that he knew who was standing before him. He said young lady. Sometime he says here is a sister. Sometime he says here's a brother that comes here. Here's a minister. He knows who he is. But he doesn't say okay man you're not a believer so no time for you. Brother Ram never asked do you pay your tithings? Do you go to church? Here is a person who needs help. And God loves to help. He doesn't ask. Why should we ask? Amen. Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Why should we become a sect? If we are not called to be a sect, why should we be this? Amen. Amen. That's what I said. If sometime people if we we we can speak about the eagles and the elect and supersede of God, it's all fine. But the more you supersede, the humbler you become. [clears throat] If we cannot talk to our brother because he doesn't have the same level of understanding that us, something is wrong in our heart, brother. Because if somebody is strong, he helps the little one a little bit up. Come on. Here we go. Next one, please. Amen. And that is this. It's changed from a healing in the flesh to the healing in the soul. And that is where many message believers, they just stay with the flesh. We know that God does great things, but it is not a a a a a public show anymore. I seen what is the vision. I seen bringing them a lady upon a stretcher. There was a lady there talking her name and things on the paper and there someone come and God pushed her through. The next man comes through with crutches. I see them go through that little building. tense vision and on the outside the lady come out scream on the top of her voice pushing the stretcher and then there was another lady on the other side looked like kind of a darkhaired woman she said what happened she said I just don't know I couldn't tell you what happened I have been paralyzed for 20 years and look I feel I was never sick and then just out came a man leaping and jumping with his crutches in his hand I looked at that in the vision what we call the tent vision Yeah. Look, here is people they are getting healed without knowing how they got healed. Got it. Got it. It was not a minister. They couldn't say somebody laid hands said we went into a building, came out, and we were healed. Everything is a vision. You get it? Do you know that we have to change a little from Pentecostal thinking now to come in a higher message realm? Because for the first two pulls, the man William Brennham was needed. Brother Brandham could not say, "Brother Neville, take their hands." That was the gift in the man William Brham. But at the at the third pull, at the 10th vision, Brother Brandham said, "I just looked and there was that pillar of fire over that went to that building and these people came out to be healed." It had nothing to do with the man, William Brham. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. We can have prayer lines. Nothing is is right. But I believe that we are called to something higher than this. We are called, we are called that everybody takes the word personally. Blessed be the name. But it's nothing wrong. Somebody needs a prayer line. Young people is no problem. But you come to an age where we think I we should rise a little bit higher. Amen. Okay. Next one, please. So exactly this. Here's a person. Listen closely. We're coming to that girl who was who was abused. The person who dreams a dream is not a dream is a subconscious. Let's say the normal man. He is his first conscious and here is subconscious. When this one becomes inactive, inactive, this one is active. Now you people that's dreamed a dream. You dreamed dreams years ago that you still remember today very prominently. Is that right? Well, there was some part of you somewhere. Amen. Talk about for us the theophony is already mystic. But look what does brother say here. Amen. Some part of you was somewhere because you still it's it isn't conscious. You remember the things you saw in some other conscious in our subconscious. Next one please. Amen. Why we're not a denomination. And when you let your faith run out to its end till you begin to believe, then let your subconscious go to acting. Then the faith of God will back it up and you will go outright. See, cause your faith won't do too much. Your subconscious has to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God's faith moves behind it and confirms it. Oh wow. Talk about psychology. Brother Brandham said God is the greatest psychologist. Quote brother Brandham. Amen. And we are we do good to try to understand what is the subconscious most of our again this is a teaching in 90 minutes just just a little fragment out of that teaching. But the subconscious is like a big CD ROM. Everything, every impression that you got through your five senses is stored somewhere. That's right. Deep in you. Amen. Every good word and every bad word. Therefore, if you are a person, brother, you take a a father who has two sons. He takes the first one. And I can even show it in the Bible by the parable, but I don't have time. I want to have the first son. Daddy says, "Boy, we believe in you. You're a wonderful young man. We make we stand behind you. Amen. And the same father says to the other boy, "Boy, I tell you one thing. You're nothing than a loser." Brother, sister, you have to understand our words have power. Especially for the bride because we have the spoken words. Amen. The same man is now developing in a different direction. If I if he if he believes me, you know, it's a joke. Amen. But if he would believe me and I said, "Oh, I will be your father." I said, "You are nothing else. You are shamed for the family. You are nothing else then and you believe." He built up a complex for all his life. Amen. [clears throat] Do you see why God is always speaking positive to us? Do you see why brother Bl is good news? Yeah. So all things that we that we that we receive in our life, it's somewhere stored. 10% of our conscious is conscious. 90% is on subconscious. Brother, you cannot tell your heart to stop beating. It's in the subconscious. You cannot tell your stomach to stop uh digesting. Is in the sub subconscious. All our feelings, everything is in the subconscious. We cannot even manipulate it. It's there. And it is like a little bomb that will explode one day. Amen. If we have enough accumulated enough traumatas, it will it will it will destroy. It will explode. Yeah. Imagine those Catholic boys that were raped by a by a priest. [crying] A man the boy he he thought that priest is a holy man, somebody to counsel and now that holy man takes him and we know what that means. Many of these youngsters take their life because they cannot live with that. Yes. You understand? Words, action, all these things. So somebody is deeply hurt in his feelings. Many times different times he has a in in in in in in extreme he has a trauma in her soul in her subconscious. Now we come and we say, "Look, uh, all your sins and all your problems, throw them in a sea of forgetfulness and put on a a little a little a a little frame which says fishing forbidden." Hah, praise the Lord. Everybody says, "Even the church, but you cannot do this." These are nice slogans that will not work. These are slogans that will not work because if something is in us, it comes up. The time comes sooner or later. Amen. It waits for an opportunity. It's there latin deep in us. Therefore, these things have to be dealt with by the Holy Spirit by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Bring it to the surface. And brother, I deal with people where I know that it works. Bring it to the surface. people now can digest it and then bring it under the blood and then it's over. But brother, these things is not a little prayer line. Forget it. This is not a a a healing in the flesh. This is a healing in the soul. This is a process from Sunday to Sunday. Can you say amen? It's so important. So all our impressions is deep in us. That explains many many many reactions of believers. Amen. Amen. Brother, I'm taking care of people now in the third generation. I'll tell you one thing. You see strains in families from grandpa to to grandson. The same problems. Sometime in sexual ways, sometime in in in any way. Amen. And people I tell you uh they mean well they explode or they act they they spiritually they slap in your face and the next day they say oh I'm so sorry for them really and they really feel sorry but it's too late. There is certain things that you cannot repair anymore. So it's so important that we are healed from the inside to the outside. Hallelujah. Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. So important. H definitely. So, so we see uh to to to give a little demonstration, we see a little bit of of brother Brandham. Okay. This is in the journal of what we call the only belief magazine. This is brother and sister I think way if I'm if I if I'm not miston man and his wife. Now sister man, she has their testimony. She had always was extremely afraid like a like a phobia when it came to storms. She had phobias and she thought it is a demon according to a testimony in the only belief magazine. She said, "I want to speak to brother that he's chasing out that demon out of me." Okay. And we were driving in the car one day and brother Bram looked through the rear mirror and he looked me in my face and he said, "Sister man, I will now explain why you have that kind of phobia. 7 years before you were born, your father was in a storm and he had a trauma there." Hallelujah. And you inherited these things in those genes. Yes, sir. And then brother Brandham explains and you see here's a sister who's born again but it's still in his subconscious. That's what we that is what we never understood as Pentecost. We thought the Holy Ghost comes and we are new creation. Therefore we always ask if we are born again or not. Amen. But there's two different levels. Amen. What happens is then that that he said, brother Blie explains if a horse gets bitten by a snake. All the children of that horse are afraid of snakes though they never seen one. It's already in their genes that kind of fear. Amen. Amen. for this uh achievement, spiritual achievement about the inheritance of traumas in our genes as a person got in the beginning of the year 2000s the Nobel Prize of psychology. This is what brother said already in the 60s. Amen. I forgot the the the expression for it. And then that woman said this and that will help you a lot to come to peace with yourself. She said, "I still had those phobias when I saw the storm, but I now knew from where it came and I could rest." Yeah. Amen. It I I didn't I didn't dramat it didn't dramatize me anymore. I knew it was not me. It was something just in my jeans. It wasn't a demon because nothing is worse if you think that you are demonpossessed and there is no demon. Yeah. Can you say amen? Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now we see now an example of brother Bram, can you say amen so far? Maybe it's not for everyone, but all you young people who want to marry, make sure that your hearts are clean because your children will pay for the complexes that we never came over. Therefore, two young ben people want to marry, forget it until you are born again. Forget that story because you will bring your life mess and your life disaster. You bring it into the marriage. and now your children can pay for it. Wait until you are really filled with the Holy Spirit and and and and that God really cleansed our hearts and our soul and our minds. Can you say amen? Amen. It's not a law, but it's a good suggestion that brother Brandon gave us. Make the next one, please, to support. Okay, here we go. Please do so. Listen carefully, please. Excuse me, sister. have [music] to relax my mind one. Now we are these strangers. I see that you are strictly a stranger to me. Yes, sir. [music] You're from away from here. Yes, sir. You come from another city. You've got a lot of trouble on your heart. You got hard troubles to begin with. Is that right? There's a whole lot of blackness. I see a black sheet keep following you like that. Or it's a lie. Somebody stole a lie on you. And that was a man was professing divine healing. Yes, sir. He said you was the witch. Is that true? And you got a forester in your church or something to God. Isn't that right? Your pastor's sick right now. He's got polio. Is that right? Sister, don't pay no attention to what them people tell you. They're alive. And the only thing wrong with your heart, that nervous condition, got your heart worked up. Go on, home in peace. And God bless you. You're all right. God bless you. Hallelujah. Talk about psychology. Huh? Talk about psychology. Okay. Look at this. How stop you can stop it. Okay, brother. Therefore, we cannot play brother Brham. These things are over. I I feel brother. We cannot play with souls. These things are holy. These things are full of responsibility. Because look at this. Now here comes that woman. She doesn't know what what's wrong with her. But something is completely wrong. She has problem with her heart. Now brother Bram said this. Okay. Now imagine brother Brennham would have been a Pentecostal preacher. What is the problem? [laughter] I'm so nervous and they say I'm a witch in my church and everybody in my church says I'm a witch. Now what you you know what every Pentecostal preacher does? Satan come out of that person for the glory and the honor of Jesus Christ. The thing is she doesn't have a demon. [clears throat] She doesn't have there's nothing to cast out because she's not demonpossessed. She's nervous. You understand? But if you think she has a demon, she will go back to her place. Nothing changed. But now she knows I have a demon. That will drive her crazy. Amen. Amen. You see the responsibility even in prayer lines. I've seen too much nonsense. People I I made one time a thing like this. I said, "Marcus, you will never do this again. I don't believe in in playing church. I mean God gives the Holy Ghost even on your seat. Whatever we can do prayer lines but not trying to discern. I mean I mean uh I see on this site [snorts] marriage problems. [laughter] I mean if you have 10 marriages you have five problems. Huh? You understand? But here it is. Look. Do you think that girl felt directly better? Oh, everything. No, no, no. She still had the stir in the church. She still had that complex. She still But here is the prophet of God said everything is right with you. That would be sufficient for me. I feel bad. I feel sick. I feel this. But the prophet said everything is okay. God will change it in his time. Yeah. Do you know what God said when I said when we say everything is so bad and everything and brother R said quickening powers let me see behind the curtain of time and I saw all of you there. I make it by God's grace. Because I believe God more than I believe my own feelings. You got you get it. But where does do if you go home you watch the video again. That woman is at the beginning she starts but there is a moment when she starts crying because he said now oh there's there is there's a lie I see a black shadow following you oh it's it's it's a it's a minister who confess uh uh divine healing and she starts crying from where does brother Brennan pick that thing up out of her subconscious takes it and when she knows that was deep in my heart she knows that is God it's air. Do you understand why we have to clean ourself while we and not only in Germany but in New Zealand the same we are so easily build up complexes one to another. It happens to me. It happens to you. Let's be honest with that thing. Amen. You have to doubt your own thoughts, your own feelings. Amen. And then the time comes that that that you are only greeting in the church those uh with a special relationship. All right. But that's the wisdom of talking to people where you know there is tensions between us. Something is not really going well and you must be spiritual to take that over. Can you say amen? Amen. Therefore, whatever is deep in us, I've seen people who brought these things constantly before the Lord. He said, "Heavenly Father, that is really bothering us." Oh, they just said, "Heavenly Father, something is just wrong in me. Is it the genes? Is it is it is it my upbringing? Is it my is it a trauma? Blood reveal it to me." Amen. And sooner or later, these people got helped because God loves to heal his children. For us, healing is always, "Oh, I had a broken leg in the Lord." No, healing is for the soul more important than for the body. Because you can only be a happy Christian if your if your inner person is healed. And you can only bring your children to a healthy gospel if you live a healthy life because they watch us. Can you say amen? Amen. And if we have that kind of things in our mind, I mean, don't think of marrying. Say first, I want to find Christ. I want to find the Lord. Next one, please. Okay, next one. Here we go. No, back. Here we go. [laughter] New Zealand technique. No, no, no. That was There he is. There he is. Here's brother Brandon. You see one thing and Brother Brandon tells a story about his family. He doesn't tell these things to entertain us. You remember that story? He comes from a mission trip and here comes Becky and she's faster than her sister and she was first coming to daddy and sitting on the lap and here comes here comes the second one and the older one says Becky I want to let you know uh I got daddy all for me alone. Um and then I think Sarah said Sarah my sister want to let you know but but my daddy has me all for his own. What does brother Ben talk about about God? [snorts] He speaks about relationship of a heavenly father with his family. That's what I told you this morning. God is not interested in in Islamic worship. Amen. Father is home. Thank you for the money. Maybe we can go to McDonald's. God wants your heart. God wants your soul. God says, "I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice even if there is no music." Amen. So you see how the two girls how they were grabbing daddy. Poor sister Ma. She's a little bit you have to understand one time one thing that you you you mothers your father one day will love your daughter. My wife told me one time in in a in a pure way. My wife told me one time Marcus because we we're talking my daughter and me we're talking spiritual things and so forth I want to be a friend brother if our children becomes our friends then we have won something okay and man and husband sometime husband and wife something a little bit common but um and then she says Marcus sometime I think you are married to our daughter I said yeah me and my daughter we have the same genes you are a stranger [laughter] Therefore, we have to watch. Therefore, I said what I said yesterday. That's the difference between the logos, the creation, homoius in the first church age. Is Jesus a creation or is he birthed? Because a creation is a different person. Burst means part of me is in her and in him. It's a strong connection. Don't break it. All right, brother. Your children need you. Amen. They need you. They really need you. They need your friendship. Yeah. Amen. They will not show because we never showed it to our parents. When we were in the age of the young people, we could never speak about sex with our parents. It was not possible. No way. That's true. There was no way. You see, so we were reading magazines of how everything we were in the world at that time. But I want to say let's be friends to our children. Hey, how are you doing, my girl? How are you doing, my boy? Amen. And let's be wise to understand. I mean, every young girl wants to know that she's pretty. Every girl wants to have a compliment. That's normal. You say, "Brother Mark, no. Only the word. The word. The word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Make an alter call for all those who lie. Okay. [laughter] Sometimes sometimes you have you have a I I'm completely against it. But the world is the world and message world is message world. They have some kind like like platforms to find the boys and the girls to marry one another. I'm completely against it. But I have to keep it like it is. Cannot change the world. So a boy presents himself. You see? I mean on that picture he has a basketball. If you ask him what is your hobbies praying and reading the message. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We we had one time a sister an older sister yet she she just made fun about the boy and here was the boy with his new car you know hanging a hanger and she's right. Oh we have wonderful and nice picture and uh really really great wanted to get acquainted with you. And the boy in his dumbness, [laughter] he's writing, "And what did you like most on the picture?" And she's writing back the car. [laughter] So, it's a little bit funny. I'm completely against these kind of platforms, but things are like they are. So, here's the connection. Make the next one, please. Amen. Okay. Please. It's a church service, but this is not a church room. Please just get the connection between the girl, the boy and their father. Please see the reaction and then you see how you how much you are important and then transform it to God and his children. Okay. Next film. [music] I close [music] my eyes and [singing] in the dark I try to see his [music] face from memories in my heart. It's been [music] some time, some months or more [music] since my father went to fight the foreign war. [music] And I know he'll be home sooner than [music] we thought. And I know he'll hold me tighter [singing] than before. Oh, [music] but I'm not sad. [music] You know I'm proud. You'll be home [music] soon to hold me tight and hold my hand. [music] Turn into yours. still be [music] waiting for my father to return. And I [music] know he'll be home soon about me. And [music] I know you have to fight forever. And I [music] know you hold me tighter than [music] And I know you hold me tighter [music] than before. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] [music] And I know [music] I know we have to fight forever. [music] [music] And I know he'll hold me tighter when he's back. He'll [music] hold me [singing] tighter than before. Amen. Amen. Buddy, I missed you. I miss you. I miss you, too. Yeah. Amen. Do you understand how we are important are for our children? Do you know how it's so be important that we have the Holy Spirit as parents to create that connection to them? Hallelujah. Because bring that plus the message of the hour plus the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hallelujah. Make the next one, please. Amen. Amen. Here's this. That's what Jesus said. Honor thy father and mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Brother, if we don't love ourself, how we can love our children? How we can love our brother? Amen. We can scold to them. We can talk to them. We can preach to them. We can if we don't love ourselves in a biblical healthy way, we will just bring misery upon our whole family. That's right. Amen. Our preaching is is will be will be characterized by this. Our family will be characterized by those things. And then you can build up a sect of and we are this and we are eagles and so forth. It's so important God. We don't come to church because Sunday morning is church time. We come that the Holy Spirit makes an operation in our hearts because we were all born the wrong way. Staying in our own way. Amen. having our complexes, having this, but here comes God and shows us a vision, changes us. Can you say amen? Who wants to be changed from from you? Amen. Is that so? We all of us want to be more like him. Next one. Next one, please. Now, here it is. Put on your spiritual jacket for people want to marry. Amen. Don't marry if somebody is not spiritually fit. Don't do it. No. He said, "We love one another. Forget it." Amen. How can you have divine love without the Holy Spirit? Amen. You have pure felio love and it will have an end. It will have its limitation. Amen. Amen. Look, this is Conrad Adnau. That is the German chancellor 1955. And these are the men who came out of Russian prison. They were 10 years after the second world war in a Russian prison from 45 to 55. Okay, that means 10 years they didn't see a woman. 10 years they didn't see one child. I mean, they were not the same after 10 years in a Russian prison. The same personalities as they were when they went into that prison. They became sometime I'm missing a lot of word but you understand they became beasts because that was important to survive in a Russian prison. If they are fathers and many times they were fathers. If the child was one year old, now the child is is 10 or 11. When the child was five and papa comes home, he is 15. [clears throat] 15. He was 10 years just among cruel men fighting to survive. Do you understand that these people have to learn to become fathers? You have to learn this. You cannot come. Here is daddy. No. No. Because he's now brainwashed for 10 years in a Russian prison. Amen. He's a stranger for the children. Children have will fear him. His words, his ways, his approach to people is completely beasty because that he was was was bringing up a person a father. There is three definitions of a father. If you have children, I agree you are the bi biological father. That's fine. Then there is what we call the guardian. Guardian when it comes to the law. That's not always the biological father. But many times it is like this if you don't know your father. But the third father is your emotional father. That's your true father. Amen. That is the one that you call daddy. That is your true father. That is the one where your heart is beating the same way. Maybe you don't know your biological father. I know my biological father but he wasn't a father. How can you help a next generation if you're always chasing your own tail? Can you say amen? Amen. Do you know how how God wants to form our character that we're not only biological fathers, but that we become daddies? That we can say, "Honey, I am the message of the hour." Amen. And that the children will say, I don't understand that he often is saying, I don't understand the seventh seal, but I have a father and I want to become like him one day. Hallelujah. This is more than just I'm in the message. This is a person who was molded by the Holy Spirit. This is somebody who works on him with the Holy Spirit. [snorts] Can you say amen? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Because we are entering into that dimension. Amen. Hallelujah. This is a person who realize I will never be a good father if I don't have the right picture of God. Amen. And if I still have that judgmental God that we had for 2,000 years, the only thing that I know is either you get one beatings or you get two beatings. Amen. And brother, we have young people that I'm dealing with. They tell me blunt. They say, "Brother Marcus, we were in a sect. We were in a cult. We had to do things that we didn't want to do. But we were forced to come to church, forced to wear those dresses, forced to do this. And when I was 18, the first thing that I did, I went and we meant well and we tried to do well. And I said yesterday today all these people who left us I kept in touch with them via WhatsApp and I said hey how are you doing and they all write me back brother Marcus I wasn't in church on Sunday I said I know this I mean I'm over 50 but at least I know who coming or not but I want to ask you how are you doing the next thing she asks she answers is brother Marcus I will come next next Sunday it's a lie anyhow Amen. Because if somebody says he comes, he he he will be there and then sooner or later she gets a picture that somebody of the church is interested in her. The thing that I was showing this morning is a denominational trend is that you're only accepted if you're functionally working in the local church. And if you are a troublemaker or you're not, you better go and nobody ask where you are. And then we call ourselves family of God. Forget it. Forget that thing. That is that's a sect that has nothing to do. A family of God [laughter] says, look, if you come or not, we stay together. We're friends together. Can you say amen? And then you see how how how God is not forgetting his attributes because brother you know the Bible says and the rich and and the and the and and the prodigal son what does the Bible says he came to himself brother if somebody leaves the church we should go with him in our prayers and never forget that person brother and and a young girl he leaves the church the first thing that she has she will cut her hair the next thing she will have sex how can you live in this world without the Holy Spirit. Forget these things. We we have young of these young people with blue hair and and and and and sometime we we we we have people we said oh these people are ashamed they were in our Sunday school. I said they are not ashamed but if we cannot reach out to them then it's a shame we are that shame because we have the Holy Spirit not them. They need a new birth. They are just honest with themselves. More not more. Can you say amen? You see, it's not enough to be in the message. God wants to mold our character to become a mother, to become a father, to become a minister, to become a brother. Again, I repeat myself. How will we help others? If we are always always, how do you see if we are so easy easily to be how do you call it? uh uh easily hurt. All right, brother. A person who is easily hurt, God cannot help the person. Amen. Amen. Amen. So what can be done? A person who is easily always offended, always easily hurt, you must tell him, hey, there is some complex in your heart and I'm not helping you by always stretching your back. What you need is an operation by the Holy Spirit that you can get some get get uh receive some some beatings and still stand up and love a person. Hallelujah. That that that message changes us to sons and daughters of God. Hallelujah. Next one please. Can you say amen? Now here we go. Amen. And also look at this brother. It's in the in the subconscious. We speak now about the world, but I bring it into the church. It's a sick world that we live in. So be prepared that the world becomes sicker and sicker because every generation that now comes comes from a sick generation. And if there is no Holy Spirit and if there's no message and if there's no insight, it becomes sicker and sicker. And they found out these young people they are shooting these brothers and sisters in their school. All of them they were listening to rock music. All of them were playing computer games. But not everybody who's listening to rock music and playing computer games is killing his schoolmates. Not at all. But they found out there was a defect in their minds, a complex. And the moment came where where where the last where where there was one drop too much and now he takes he he he he tries to comfort himself by revenge and so he goes to his schooler those who humiliated him all the time they just killing him. Brother and you have to watch this because brother Brandham said it like this we have responsibility for one another. Amen. said, "Brother Marcus, these are just demons." Yes, they are demons. I agree with you. But brother Bram said in a message demonology, he said that demon needs needs a bruised cell. That's right. It needs a situation so that the demon can now take control of a person. And the natural types, the spiritual. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And now it enters in and fulfilled. And most of these young people that are killing others in the school, you know what they who they kill last themselves. It's the same spirits that were in the swine who killed themselves is the same that are living today. Brother Brand was asked a question. We had a a a journalist who was a wise girl. She wrote about about a German school massacre of 16 young people who killed who were killed. And she said there were not 16 victims, there were 17 victims because the murder himself killed himself later. He said not 16 mas lost their boys but 17. Yeah. The murderer was a victim himself. You understand that? So a person leaves the church. I'm not a and my whole family and we're doing this and he builds up his anger, his pride, whatever. He doesn't know what he does. I've seen many people leaving the church but always I have seen they do not they do not improve spiritually by staying home. They do not improve it and they say they heard it so much my feeling in the church so I stay home. Yes, but that doesn't change the problem because the problem is in us and if I'm staying home I'm staying home with my own problem. I whatever happens to my life I have to come in the presence of God is that heavenly father they hurt heard it so much my feeling but I need something to override that thing but the human reaction is you can do you can stay home you can blow and this and this but if you have children brother you stay with those children yes my lord amen can you say amen you must give them a vision don't bring your complex upon your own children. We don't go because this and because no, let's say we go into the house of the Lord, brother. It's it's a thing for our generation of life and death. Church is not a playground. Church is life and death. Honestly, those who missed the rapture, they will go into the great tribulation. Brother Brham said, and and the Holocaust was just a pre-tribulation. That's what he says. Look why it is so important. Can you say amen? Amen. Amen. Spiritual healing Lord. Clean my heart. Clean my mind. Clean my subcon. Clean everything. Amen. Make me make me make me like you, father. You say what was the greatest thing in Jesus? The miracles. No, the greatest thing is when we at the cross, he said, "Father, forgive them." That is where God brings us to. Forgive my brother. Forgive my sister. [applause] Hallelujah. Look at this. You put on the spiritual jacket. Give Give me just a minute. So to because I I feel that's so important, man. So important, man. We must be changed by the renewing of our mind. That's what Paul says. Really changed. Amen. Here is here's Golden Gate Bridge. And maybe I'm talking to I I I brother, I speak to young people who try to take her life, their life. They are back in track. I there was one case where I was actually there. God led me the right moment there. front of our youngsters now back in the church now song leading brother we are not talking about so this is in in the message don't be naive these things come it's spirits at all around I told some of our parents I said okay you mourn about your young people in the world how much time do you come together to pray for these youngsters and ask God for for grace to bring them back but sometime we're a little bit lazy about that a little bit too much comfort comfortable. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Look, here is Golden Gate Bridge. I'm I'm a little bit Can you say amen? Talking to myself. Okay. Amen. Preach it. Don't teach it, man. Yes. Because man, we have children. I have a daughter. I want to see her on the other side. Want to see her there. Whatever it costs, I am her intercessor. Amen. I am that Abraham. And brother Ram said when when when when when God came to to to to to Sodom [laughter] and and and and and and and that city had to be destroyed, brother Ram said, the Bible says God remembered Abraham, not Lot. Lot was just some but the prayers of Abraham were the intercessor for Lot. Hallelujah. Therefore, the bride is an intercessor. Sorry for this. Look, this is Golden Gate Bridge. This is pure statistic. Glory. In all these years, 2,000 people, I know from the 60s to 2,000 people were were killing themselves, jumping from that bridge. 2,000. I don't know from the 70s up to just a number 10% official statistic of the US survived or 1% sorry 1% survived. 20 people out of 2,000 survived. All of them, all gave the same testimony. All of them. They said, "We heard a voice which says you just jump up. You jump and you will land in a nice country. All your problems will be solved. All your problems will be away." And all of them said, "When we left that bridge, we knew it was a mistake." But it was too late. Hallelujah. Brother, do you hear sometimes do you have sometimes thoughts? I have them. You have them. You must understand is nothing else and nothing at psychological warfare and you just bring it before the Lord. And what the young people think you call upon the name of the Lord. Don't question yourself if you have these thoughts. Question those thoughts. That's the difference. First, don't question yourself. Then Satan one question these thoughts and said that's are not my thoughts. Satan, you can get them back. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Next one, please. I'm I'm going now. Here's brother Ren. Same thing. Amen. He's a He's a small man. I'm not answering too much. Yeah. God God brought us in a body that we don't like. And God allowed that. Brother Ben was an extreme small man. And you understand when he stands beside Aurora Roberts, brother Brandon stand on his toes. You see the picture? He's aware that he's extremely small. Brother Brandham passes by Oral Roberts University. And here comes some thoughts. If he got those thoughts, you get those thoughts. Be sure. And I get the same thoughts. But we learned that spiritual warfare. Hallelujah. Because we're a little bit older now to to learn spiritual warfare. And he and he thinks about look this is Ara Robert's entrance. And then he hears some some some thought which says yes uh this is he has 200 secretaries and you have only one typewriter. And brothers he start he said I was starting to cry. He was still under denominational thinking. Yes. What I was preaching this morning, big church, big favor. Small church, please pastor, have a complex because God couldn't give you much people. You must have a be very very humble because you just have 20 people. No, no, no. Amen. Amen. Pure denominational thinking. Amen. So, so, so Danny has a thought that says, "Yes, God couldn't trust your money, brother. The message that we believe [snorts] there are seven messengers. Two were special. Paul could write the Bible. He was the one laying a foundation as a wise master builder. Amen. Brother Brandon was the one bringing the capstone upon the whole building. Different ministry. Amen. None of them had the capacity like William Brandon. Yes. Amen. None of the me seven messengers could go into a room and says, "I now take everything under under my control for the glory and the honor of God." None of them had a third pull. None of all the prophets in the Old Testament could look farther than William Brandham. Before the logos, he could see these things. But in that moment, he watched that nonsense. And if we start crying, he said, "Yes, God really couldn't trust me money. God could trust him more than than anybody else in this world." But he builds up a complex. God cannot trust with money. And it's the moment when God speaks to him. He said, "Look up." You therefore we go to church. Look up. Look up. I am your portion. Here we go. Brothers, sisters. Sometime even we are a little bit in a fog. Yes sir. Sometime we a little bit foggy. You and me. And then God says, "Look up, boy. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Here we go. Amen. Make the next one. Amen. Amen. Amen. Make the next one. Come on. If not, Amen. Here. Here it is. I mean, go back. [laughter] Marilyn Monroe. I told you she became a Jew. I'm a Jewish religion. Is not an evangelistical religion, but you can become a Jew. Here's what brother said. I read of her life story in the magazine. She was an illegitimate child and how that she had washed so many dishes and her mother in the insane institution and she had longed she was the most perfectbodied woman I guess in the world but she had longed for something that money wouldn't buy. Sisters you must understand if that body didn't make Marilyn Monroe happy then makeup will not make you happy neither. You must find your joy in Christ. It's not legalism, it's revelation. Amen. Maybe members of the churches of fame, famous famous Hollywood where all the decoration and tins is on. They seen all but seen those people. She could see they lived no different life than what she did. It takes influence. It takes the power of the resurrection of Christ among these people that they see that Christ is not a statue hanging a building but he's a living being in the form of a Holy Spirit living in man and women bringing peace contentment and happiness. Oh, if we could only get to that young lady before she left the world. And brother here you are and God says I can get can can come to you. Do you understand? We as parents, we as olders, brother, the young people, they are observing us. They are I tell you, I'm a I'm a minister. I take care of people. I'm not a pastor, but sometimes you can call an associate pastor, but I'm not have that official thing. Okay? I'm more of an evangelist taking care of a lot of people, brother. [snorts] I'm not I'm not sharing nothing with my wife. Amen. Because I don't believe that a minister should share all things with his wife. No, it's not right. because I'm built to bear that burden. She's not built for that. And I've seen how ministries were destroyed when the church knows that you tell something confidentially to a pastor and he tells his wife that that pastor is over. Hallelujah. If the church get knows that, Amen. then the confidence is away. Definitely. So, and even my wife is not sharing certain things with me. If a sister says, "I want to talk with you about this." And she will not, she will tell me, "Talk about the weather." And I know that's not for me. That's fine. Huh? I will not share critical things with my daughter. She's not 19 years old. But brother, these youngsters today are not as naive as we were when we were 19. They can even read body languages in the church. They pick up where tensions are. We cannot tell them no story. They are professionals. Hallelujah. Praise you, brother. We cannot play theater before them. They pick these things up. That is genuine and that not. And praise God for it. Because it puts me on the spot to be as transparent as I could be. And even tell your child and even ask for forgiveness. Say, "Honey, papa was just nervous. Forgive me. Papa has no problem. I've forgiven." [laughter] You understand? But we were naive at that time. But this generation is not naive anymore. They can pick these things up. Amen. So, so how we talk another about another group, another church. Hallelujah, brother. I tell you, whatever you do, respect people. Thank you, my Lord. Hallelujah. I see people you can we can disagree. Let me say for example about the Brandham family or about voice of God. We can disagree. Not a problem. But never preach against death. Never do that because it's still the family of the prophet. Leave them in God's hands and says leave it up to them because the more you attack them, the more you attack yourself because the people would say okay there is no respect in that thing. Leave things in the message like they we don't have to give a command about everything. If somebody ask we can say this is my good brother is a wonderful family but we disagree in this and this. That's okay. But not that kind of declaring war because you saw a storm. You saw a wind, I tell you. And you will reap a storm in your own family, in your own church. Can you say amen? Next one, please. Amen. Here we go. Amen. Amen. Give me some minutes. Hallelujah. But there is a change. There is a solution. There is a way. Amen. You say, brother Marcus, what is the way? Jesus is the way. He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." And he is specialist for your situation. He is the great navigation system. Bringing you back home because there's a theophony already waiting for you. There's already something of eternity right in your heart which brings you home. You pay for your own mistakes. Be sure sometimes the navigation system says new calculation because by our own mistakes we have to make some detours. But you come, you arrive at the right thing. Because why? The Bible says this. For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as no shall all the proud. Yeah. All that do wickedly shall be stubbled. And the day that cometh shall be burned. Damn up, said the Lord of host, that he shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing under his wings. Thank you Lord. That is what we were showing brother Brandham in Laa. He is a star in the night. But he preaches 1964. Shalom. Sorry. Shalom. Good morning church. What does it mean? The night is over. The day arrive. Shalom. Good morning. Who rises up? The son of righteousness. What does it bring? knowledge quotes. Amen. Pictures of a cloud. Amen. No healing. But healing different than we had it in the past. Another form of healing. Much deeper, much better, much greater, but it doesn't fit in any denominational program anymore. It's God. The sun rises and calls the water up. God in silence does great things. It's not a public show. It's not anymore we have to invite brother so and so and he lays hands and he he he he and the all the problems will be solved. God is dealing with his family right now. And your own pastor has the same capacity. Your own father in the house has the same capacity. You itself have the capacity to to to call that healing out of you. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Brother, I made that same that same experience. Let me share that with you. I know I'm I'm a little bit over. Give me some. Is that fine for you? Because we will maybe not have another possibility in in that way. Every psychologist said this. I I I I went into a into a uh hospital because I had a slip disc. So, I had to make some kind of uh senatorium. And they said, "Do you want to have a talk with a psychologist?" I said, "Yes. I was interested. I'm not not for me. I'm in good shape. Honestly, I'm in. But I would So I asked that that psychologist, how do you help people? And she said, "Mr. Becker, there is two different problems. No neurosis and u no and forget the second one. One is to be treated with medicine." Okay. Others is just to be treated with talking. All right. And this great success. And she said to me this, "Mr. Becca, many times I talk with somebody at the phone who has mental problems, mental illness, and we are talking on the phone." And you have to understand that the solution in a person's life lays right in him. As long as it's not a problem in his chemical base or whatever way she needs medicine, but normally the problem lays in him. And I made exactly on the point exactly the same experience. She said I'm talking and now I was a person. I was talking 10 words. The rest just a person was talking bringing out from the inside what lays to the surface. And then the person says to me, "Oh, I'm so thankful for the conversation. You really helped me." In reality that person helped himself but we were the person giving him the room to express himself. Rather I had a boy who tried to commit suicide and he sp he spoke about his family his religious family. It was like a it was like a tape that went over and over for an hour was listening an hour listening next day an hour for for months and months. And he called me again. He said, "Brother Marcus would like to call talk to you." I said, "I had such a difficult use and I thought by myself, okay, now the tape starts." And then he said this, "But brother Marcus, I have to change my future by God's help." And I knew now the healing process starts supernaturally. That same boy is a song leader right now for me. Brother, we need to have patience with people. I would be happy if New Zealand sends somebody who lays hands and these problems are solved. But these are problems that lay deep in the soul of a person and it takes some time, a process. It takes time, brother. And therefore, a church is a family. A church is a hospital. A church is a place where the Holy Spirit should be so present that a person who is so much loaded or uh such a bloat in his mind that he just sits down. He said I don't know what it is but I feel somehow good that is already wonderful. Hallelujah. Next one please. Amen. Why is it so important? Okay, go back. Go back. I'm I'm I'm I'm hurrying through. Here it is. The sun goes up. Amen. And healing under his his wings. Now you take that story of Jacob. Jacob in the night wrestled with the angel. And when the morning came, when the sun came, that angel changed his name. Not in the night, but when the sun came up. Right. And brother Brmond said, "The name is the nature that we have." Brother, that message, the opening of the word, if you once know who you are really, and brother Brmond said it like this, if you want to be healed, you must see a healed man right before you. And you are walking yourself into that healed man. And the last step is that is exactly what you are. That is the that is the rapture for us. So the name was changed from Jacob to Israel. Yeah. When the sun came up, you put on now your spiritual jacket. All right. We must be so honest in God's in God's presence. You don't have to call your problems loud out. I will not call my complexes loud out, but you have to talk with your father. You have to make business. said, "Lord, that's me." Because now you put on your spiritual jacket. Amen. The angel when he was wrestling with Jacob did not ask, "In which church do you go?" Which message do you believe? Amen. Um, do you love Brother Brham? The angel asked, "What is your name?" Amen. In other words, who are you really? And then a person must be in the presence of God. said, "Heavenly Father, I'm a man full of envy. That's me. I'm standing in my own way, but I don't want to have it. That's not me. But I got it with all these complexes." And God says, "Okay." Amen. And you wrestled so long until you get a new name. Hallelujah. Brother said, "Brother Marcus, did you wrestle it out?" I'm still wrestling. But I see in my own life there's a changing. See it and you see it for yourself. I say amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Therefore, please I know I'm repeating myself. You just translate it into your own language. You cannot sit and make a little bit screaming to the US and say, "Oh, tremendous, man. Tremendous." That will not change you, man. will not change you. You can do it, but it's just entertainment. Don't forget it. You must come in the presence of God and Lord change me. Do something for my heart. Hallelujah. [applause] You say and therefore that message came to reveal our true identity so that we can say that's not me. I'm a wonderful man on the outside. The the man who stands in his own way is just the outside man. But by the grace of God, we will kill that beast. That mammal, we will kill him. Amen. So, we have a nice message for you. We kill you, man. I'm going hang you up, destroy you. And I'm because inside is the true being who you are really, [cheering] brother. But that's a fight. That's a fight. That is not ignoring. That's not out. You know, I'm 20 years in the message. That is nothing. How much were were you already transformed? Did you become old in the message or did you become wise in the message? That's the difference. Hallelujah. And you can only help your children if we change ourselves. And speak to your youngsters. They said, "Hey boy, I tell you one thing. You have my jeans. You know I love you, but I was always a man standing in my own way. Pray for me. I pray for you. Because our children are our brothers and sisters in reality. Speak with them. Be honest with them. Make the next one. I'm hurrying through. Amen. Here. I'm opening the seat. Now there is another one greater far greater than all the rest of them put together already confirmed and ready. I hope pull I hope it happens tonight. I just might say that I don't have the time to explain to you but the brethren who know does know know about it's wonderful it be it would be such a great thing for the people I'm grateful to God that the hour is soon at hand when God is going to help his children especially it will be for those who can't master the faith to raise up and get a hold of God like they should do. I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them also. Some runs into faith that they can just reach over and receive anything. Why? That's great faith. Some of them has mustard seed faith and has to wait so long to get through. I believe the Lord is making a way for these people now. And I don't know when it will be, but it will be just as certain as I'm standing. Do you understand that with all kind of prayer lines you must be very wise because if somebody needs a lot of time you will frustrate that person. Some people have express faith but if it's not your time you can come in all kind of prayer line but you must understand God's mechanic. You must it will come in his time. Can you say amen? Amen. Amen. That's therefore you see the nature of God. The rapture is not God sitting up and look we will see from New Zealand. Maybe God takes his children home. Amen. Next one please. I'm I'm I'm hering. Amen. Amen. Here's the man. Amen. Last two. I think I think it's two and then we're going. Yeah. Here we go. Now put on the spiritual jacket. Last one. Spiritual healing and spiritual growth go along side by side. Amen. And you put again the spiritual jacket. I don't question your new birth and my new birth, but that's not the end of our journey. That's the beginning of our journey. And there is a process. And no moving of the Holy Spirit will take away that process. That's what we were hearing this morning. Um, it's not the anointing on the outside. It must be the words on the inside that's shining through us. Therefore, we are not Pentecostals anymore. But we need the Holy Spirit. Definitely. So, look, put on a spiritual jacket. Can you say amen? Amen. Really, last point. Amen. Huh? We know that Elijah was the prophet and Elisha was his follower. We can see the picture, but this is just Marcus. I don't know if brother Brandham says it that way, but it's Marcus. But Elijah is the prophet in Elijah. Elisha typing the bride because she is doing the double portion. She has to prophesy again. That's Marcus. If there is a quote, send it over to me. I don't have it but I let me see that picture. Okay. Now, here comes Elijah and he calls Elisha. He has a calling. That's true. But brother Bram said it took 10 years to change Elisha to fit the mantle of Elijah. Hallelujah. Got it. Got it. We're the bride. We're William Brennan. We speak he's the wish she yes we talk like brother Brandham but God wants to see the same character in us the same formation the same graduation and then brother Brandham said this when it came to that mantle and we will take that mantle and some of us take it today already we take the mantle of William Brennham it's not a question at all he was just a we shave the the the the the sheave wave amen we We'll take it. We take it maybe today already. But brother Remy said this, God never changed the mantle to fit Elijah. God changed Elisha to fit into that mantle. We want to do the miracles of William Brennan. Brother God says wonderful, but you are fitting now into the caliber of that man. And I will and I will I will form you. I will transform you. I will mold you. I will do something with you. Amen. So that I can trust you. That sword in your own hands. Can you say amen? Here's brother Brenham. Amen. I let standing in the gap a man who was born again when he was 20. Twice he wanted to take his life with the Holy Spirit. Amen. The seals are open and he is building up a complex. That's right. He said, "I let the sick lay. I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not. That is wrong. I built myself a complex. A man full of the Holy Ghost and says I have a complex. Uh-huh. Psychology. If you want to call it psychology, then it's psychology. But that's life. Because the people didn't hear my message. And if you and God forbid that I have tried to compare my life now with Moses, but exactly what Moses did, the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them. So he just left them alone, went into the wilderness. And here we have the prophet Elijah again. Here we have the people leaving the church. They don't like me. They don't like my ministry and and and just stay home. The same response went into the wilderness. But God turned him around and he went long. Forget to the suffering people. There's two things to kill a man. Not only a minister. Too much applause is not helpful. Too much applause is not helpful. Never. Amen. But too much criticism is not helpful neither. Amen. We have a slogan for the children. If you criticize them once, you have to give them a little compliment 10 times. 10 times a compliment, once a criticism. That's for the pastor the same way. Amen. Just let him know that you love the man. Amen. I know it's a it's a mixed audience. Just let him know we see your labor. We have a slogan in Germany which says one mother can take care of 10 children but 10 children cannot take care of one mother. Emotionally she takes care of 10 children but all these 10 children will not have enough space for one mother together. Let's be wise. Let's be children of God. Let's understand that our compliments must be a spoken word. Amen. Amen. Then he said, "And here comes God." He said, "Then let that stand. If there is ever a doubt in your mind, remember this place. Come back here." And I showed you the last time. Amen. These seven mountains are the life of William Brandham in the message. Stand in the gap. Your name is written all over. I tell you one question. When did God create these mountains? 1963. No. No. They were created when God created the earth. Amen. And God knew I have a messenger who is a neurotic and he's a melancholic type of a person. And he already portrayed his life. And he showed one thing. We have our ups and downs the same way. And if you are on the mountaintop, don't become arrogant. Oh, I don't understand these families and I don't understand because because the next valley is waiting for you and brother but when you are in the valley don't give up don't you have those valleys don't give up because the next mountain is waiting for you okay you must see the bigger picture in your life and then you see the big bigger picture in another person's life who left the church in all kind of extremes all kind of perversions but you don't see the perversion. You see the heart of that man and you become an intercessor. He said, "Heavenly Father, that's my brother. I'm not agreeing into nothing. But I I I pray for that boy that he comes back and comes back in his own mind." Can you say amen? Here is a man. I build up a complex. We could go on, but but but but amen. Next one. Amen. Here, two years later, God made many things for his men. Amen. Brother Weey comes back to life. Uh what happened in between is everything in the message companion. I hope everybody read it. If not, we're sending some. Amen. God spoke to his prophet. Amen. In that in that bruised condition and he wanted to shoot these three deers and he didn't do that. And he said, "And here comes the presence of the Lord and I put off my head." And God says, "You remember your promise that you will not shoot these three deers." I said, "Yeah, yes, I will do it." And he said, "And God told me, you remember your promise, so I will remember my promise. I will never leave you and never forsake you." Brother Bla said, "I'm I was not the same man anymore." Brother, in between of that time, there were a lot of miracles. Brother Way came back to life, but it never changed the prophet. But he was changed when he heard that still small voice. I never leave you. I will never forget you, brother. We can have every Sunday three miracles here on that platform and that is just wonderful. But it will not change our problems. It will not change our character. Our character will be changed when we are going in intimacy with our heavenly father. Can you say amen? Amen. Two years later on the wings of a snow white dove, here we have Jonah. Why me? An old man suffered all my life. Why did he heal me? Now I believe I will write this trail again. Now that's Christ. I got to bring a message and I say to my father tonight, uh, Lord, your servants reporting for service. Amen. I'm ready. In between of two years, the seals are open. God changes the man from a person who wants to give up to a person says Lord here I am I'm ready he made that changing therefore after the opening of the seal brother never spoke about his life story anymore because he speaks of a bigger picture amen amen you think that God does the same for usmen do you think that the rapture is heavenly Father, take me home. I cannot see those kies anymore and those for trackers and whatever. I hate to see those people. Take That's not the rapture. The rapture is the glorious going home of people who are made in the image of God, victorious. They died to themselves and God could take room in their hearts. Can you say amen? Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If the musicians would come, do you love the Lord? Amen. Do do you want to have Dr. Barna and making a heart transfer transformation at heart? Can you say amen? Do you understand? Message is not entertainment. Message is changing from where we came to a complete new creature. But it's not laying on of hands. Sorry for this. If you know that person who changes you by laying of hands, please send it to Germany. I need it. But it's taking the word, getting that angel said, "Change me, mold me. I want to be the same like I am." It's not even a question of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That is for your salvation. But it's now taking maybe your own theophony. I'm coming in the same line with your own theophony. Whatever you can call it. Amen. Can you say amen? Do you understand young people? How can we be happy parents if we are not happy? Do you know a a couple wants to marry? There's nothing wrong with it. But you need the Lord first. Because you will make your children miserable. I and we who are longer on the way. Amen. We cannot change our our past. Honestly not. But we can change our future in 2023. Don't Lord don't let me be the same. Amen, brother. And sometime I was talking about things I didn't read these things in in a book. I was experienced all these things because and taking care of people bring them out of nothing and the church is so surprised what a person said to me we we we got a boy back and they told me brother Marcus who laid hands upon that boy I said nobody laid hand he he understood who he was in the presence of God and by that he changed himself by the renewing power of this word. Amen. We are just helping in the process, not more. But but but life is so brother brother you you get sometimes the hit. We all get it from time to time and we're just down. Even in our ministry sometime we think we uh everybody stop born does nobody wants to listen. It's it's a complex that we build up. No. But we think sometimes so and we get our beating and I love that picture. Here comes Satan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and at seven we are eight [snorts] nine 10 and we are back. Brother Bam said it like this. He said to fall down is human to stand up as godly brother. [applause] There is something in you that stands up. Your heavenly father. Can you say amen? What a father we have. Don't stay to be the same. Be transformed by the renewal of your minds. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe maybe we sing the song uh uh in moments like this. I have only five songs to sing. Okay. So you say the man cannot preach. He cannot sing. Why did he come? Just to be a blessing for one another. Do you love the Lord? [applause] Therefore, brother, [cheering] that angel came down. I preached a message which says the rapture comes to you. That angel come down to pick you up and equip you for that flight. That's our heavenly father in moments like this. God bless you. Was a great honor for me. Tomorrow we will be a little bit practical for the youngsters, okay? To be a little bit how we have victory in little things of our life. It's only for the young people. But let me set the young people up to 80. Okay? [laughter] And in moments [singing] like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song for Jesus [singing] in moments like these. [music] I lift up my hands. I lift up my [music and singing] hands to the Lord. singing [singing] I [music] love you Lord. [singing] Singing I [singing] love you Lord. singing. I [singing] [music] love you, Lord.

[singing] Sing [music] you Lord. [singing and music] Sing. [singing] [music] Oh Lord, [singing] I love you. [singing and music] Oh, if your music softly plays, heavenly father, [music] it was an unusual service, even with a little bit of video in it. Father was not very conservative but it showed us father if these youngsters there's [snorts] so much their daddy that we saw in the film Lord is an an example for us [music] to understand so much does God love his children. We say we love Jesus, but Jesus loves his bride so much, his children so much. And father, when all that is in us, we want to serve you. [music] Amen. All that is in us, Father, and change us and mold us, Father. Let us grow, Father, because the opening of the word brought healing under your wings. Now we see our true identity, who we are really. Nope. psychologist in the world can give what this message brings to us but we understand principles that a person has a psyche and we must understand it father clean our hearts and I know sometime it's a process but when we enter into 2023 let us have inventory and said heavenly father there is a little bit of complex in my heart there's a little bit of bitterness in my heart there's a little bit of frustration in my heart but heavenly father just take it out of me. I want to be happy with myself and with the next generation and with the people around me. Father, I thank you so much for your presence and may you bless the ministry that is here that was so patient with me all these services. May you bless the bride in New Zealand. Father, may you bless your children, Father. May you bless Israel, Father. And Father, like your prophet said, we are waiting for the new Jerusalem, but the bride is the new Jerusalem. At the same time, Father, what time of people we are, please let us understand who we are. And if things in our life just burdens us, let us understand that's not my burden. Give it back to Satan. You gave it to me. I don't want to have it. Thank you very much. I'm a child of God. Father, it takes a process. It took for me sometimes many, many years to be honest. But I know that you're working still and you're working in my brother and my sisters. And please father continue to work on our hearts and our minds so that one day we can say I am the message of the hour. I can I I have the caliber that we are seeing in the ministry of William [music] Brandham. Amen. So father we thank you for this evening. May you Amen. If I can say it. I don't know if somebody preaches praise behind it. May you bless the food and the fellowship father. And may you continue to bless us if we have some songs. And father may you bring us back tomorrow happy uh wells slept in good shape and ready to listen what you want to say what the spirit wants to say. Thank you so much for that audience.

And I ask you, Father, that you [music] will just take their hands this evening. I'm will take them and lead them home. Father, [music] let their young age when they're in their teenage years, Father, may you just lead them by the Holy Spirit, fill them, Father. If you're not if they're not baptized yet, Father, lead them to a true baptism. If they don't have the Holy Ghost yet, Father, fill them with the Holy Ghost, Father. The only satisfying portion, Father. So, we thank you, Father, for this moment. [music] Why don't you give an a situation a possibility for each and everyone? Father, so that nobody goes [music] out of this convention without taking that advantage to take him by his hand. Hallelujah. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Is there somebody else who feel that's my calling to serve the Lord? Hallelujah. [music] Just raise your hands to God. Hallelujah. God bless your brother in the back. Hallelujah. So, Father, we thank [music] you for this time of consecration. I I believe there's a lot of insincerity right behind it, Father. [music] And you may guide them and lead them into your perfect will, Father. You said all that received you, you gave power [music] to become sons and daughters of God. So we thank you, Father. You started that process [music] with their hand lifted up. So we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. You please sit down. Hallelujah. [music] God bless you. Thank you for the song be. Amen.
