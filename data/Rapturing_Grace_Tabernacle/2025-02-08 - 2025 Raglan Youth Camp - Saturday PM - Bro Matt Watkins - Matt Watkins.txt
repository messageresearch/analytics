Give the Lord Jesus a hand clap of Praise hallelujah amen God bless you amen sister Deborah if you could come and make your way I just have a special I'd like her to sing she be playing the piano thank you God bless you have you enjoyed your time here at Camp amen how many have received a blessing something from the Lord already how many still say Lord I still got a cup that's empty I've received something this morning but I want to say Lord I've got an empty cup and I want you to fill it up how many say that Lord here's my need you know I believe that's important we did it the first night I wonder if we'd do that again just to say Lord I'm going to represent my need by an uplifted hand why don't you do that right now just raise it up to the Lord say God this is my hand representing my specific need you know sometimes you need to be specific with the Lord tell him what's on your heart brother Al did uh was did such an awesome job this morning with those questions and showed how that even God knowing the will yet we still have to ask think of when Jesus is saying that the laborers the Harvest is plenty remember that and he says but the laborers are few and then here's Jesus and he says so ask the lord of the Harvest and he is the lord of the Harvest and he says so ask the lord of the Harvest to send laborers what is it it's showing the relationship that brother brandham said that many times we don't have things from the holy holy spirit because we don't ask for them and so the even in the Book of Mark chapter 3 it says that Jesus had not done many miracles at that point because they had not asked him to so if all he's doing is waiting for us to ask then I think we ought to ask like the Bible says that your joy may be full brother brandham said it this way ask big things don't ask little things ask big things ambitious bold faith I believe is the faith of Believers amen God bless you you can be seated just a song that sister de Road I believe will be a blessing to you and it just goes with my service here tonight the road is long your birden Gra I see your sorrow each step that you [Music] take when all hope is gone if you will just hold on I'll cover you with my hand give you another chance when you've lost it all my word can never fail sayth the Lord I will restore look up ahead [Music] this Valley will end blessing I'll bless you again and [Music] again when all hope is gone if you will just hold on I'll cover you with my hand give you another [Music] chance when you've lost it all my word can never fail sayth the Lord I will restore and I'll bring back Revival salvation to Lost Souls my people shall prosper healed and delivered by my name I promise for nothing is greater I'll bring back Revival salvation to Lost Souls my people shall prosper healed in delivered by my name I promise for nothing is greater I'll bring back Revival salvation to Lost Souls my people shall prosper healed and faed by my name my promise for nothing is [Music] greater when all hope is gone if you will just hold on I'll cover you with my hand give you another chance when you've lost it all my word can never fail sayth the Lord I will restore when you've lost it all my word can never fail sayth the Lord l i will [Applause] restore are you thankful for that promise amen how many believe the Lord's word will never fail amen God bless you stand to your feet with me amen Ephesians chapter 6 if you have your Bible we'll just turn there Ephesians chapter 6 and we'll just begin reading verse 10 real familiar scripture amen praise the Lord amen I would just like to take this last service and the Lord before I came here to New Zealand uh the Lord showed me I would preach this it's the only service that I was sure about on what I would speak and when I would speak it would be here tonight so I believe the Lord does that not always sometimes he leads you and you just have to trust him entirely and just go with the best uh way that you know as a minister but other times the Lord just quickens something it makes it so real and I believe when he does that God's got a real specific purpose in mind so I wonder if maybe you just would say by an uplifted hand Lord Make My Heart sensitive to what your voice wants to speak to me tonight amen God bless those hands that are up why don't we just go before him here B before we read our scripture we'll pray I wonder if You' just put your hand over on that one if it's appropriate there beside you boy to boy girl to girl let's just bind our hearts together and faith brother brandham said when you touch with your hands another believer that light leaves your body goes into them and light leaves their body goes into yours and we unify our faith all one together and the enemy if he could accomplish anything it would be to try to prevent what the Lord wants to do so why don't we just bind him by faith here tonight and let the Holy Spirit just have his way from the pull pit all the way to the back door Lord Jesus father we are your children Lord you're the one who placed a desire to serve you in our heart Lord you said no man has has sought me but I've sought you no man comes to the father unless he's drawn so God this is your word this is your people and this is your promise Lord but we just want to identify ourselves tonight that we are believers we believe it with all that is within us God I pray Lord Jesus that you would bind every evil Spirit Lord that would try to prevent or hinder the moving of your spirit tonight we know Lord God that there's nothing greater nothing greater father no gift that's greater Lord than the preaching of the word of God that could go forth and discern even greater than the gift of a prophet and discernment that would discern what disease we have or what sickness we have Lord but the word the Bible says is is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart dividing us under both B Soul and Spirit so I pray God that you would come with a word that would discern our heart Lord father and may when we hear that word may we not just be apathetic to it Lord not just an observer or a spectator tonight Lord but may we hear recognize and act upon the word of God each one of us Lord are responsible only for ourself and the response that we have father I pray that you would find a heart a a fertile bedding ground for your word to take root I pray God that you would Deliver Us From Any evil Lord I pray God that your angels would encamp about us now tonight Lord May the word go forth in power and demonstration Lord father I pray that you would speak to us in a special way Grant it Lord bless this Camp bless brother alr's Church his family God for putting this on and may above all else may you receive Glory and Honor all of it Lord for it's only due to you we thank you for it now in the name name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians chapter 6 I'm going to minister to you something here tonight that is uh in some ways will be a little difficult on me to preach as I even just preparing for it there before I came out here just fell under the weight of the sermon here tonight as we recently just in our family lost a a dear loved one a young man 28 years old and uh he he was a wonderful young man we didn't lose him I shouldn't use that word because he's our Eternal treasure now but the devil just uh got a foothold in his life and and um just watched uh just watched a life that was so precious that uh just uh much like the the the um the story of the man Legion in the Bible who who the Bible speaks about that he had just a a legion of demons and you know brother brandham when he he talks about Legion he said it it started maybe with his temper maybe just something maybe a lie he says in another place that he told and you say how could a man get 2,000 demons How could a person end up like that one at a time and and but what's so powerful about that story is me and a brother was fellowshipping this afternoon on it is it's amazing because we got to be careful how we tell that story because Legion was not his name actually Legion was just the name of the demons that he had upon him and many times when you look at a person and they're addicted or they're they're a drug addict or they're an alcoholic a lot of times we can if we're not careful we can tend to identify them with that Spirit but just always remember they are not that Spirit who Legion was was a Son of God a man of God a husband had children he was a family man but the devil had got a stronghold in his life but when he found the Lord Jesus the the Bible says he came back to himself and so I I just want to say here tonight that this is very real to me what I'm going to preach here tonight is uh very real if I'm extra passionate you just uh give me Grace here tonight because it it means a lot to me it comes from the bottom of my heart Ephesians chapter 6 I'm going to speak to you here tonight on influenced by Angels influenced by angels finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now that word high is not in the sense of altitude but it's actually the the Greek word there is for atmospheres so we wrestle against it's not that we don't battle the first thing you must realize as a Christian is that you are in a war for your life and you've got a real enemy who if he could would destroy you tonight if he could brother bham said he would take your life like that but there's a protection upon the life of a Believer and and brother bandam said that Satan can't touch a hair on your head until he gets Mission from your father in Heaven and so notice it's a battle it's a real struggle a real a real war that we're in and he says it's in high places or other atmospheres verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor that you may be able to stand in the evil day how many young people can just say we're in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gir about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet Shaw with with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always yes prayer is a part of your army your armor it's it's a part of the armor friends not just praying you know uh you know just while you're eating your food or before you go to bed but the Bible says pray and always with all prayer and supplication and the spirit walk watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints Lord Jesus we just bow our heads before you God recognizing this Divine appointment Lord that you made father and I'm so grateful Lord that you care so much Lord that you we could be here tonight and we could be recipients of Grace once again Lord once again father here's another opportunity for maybe one person Lord that tonight maybe something Lord that would be said that they would respond to Lord and tonight you could rewrite their whole life God I'm so aware right now at this moment Lord that there's a struggle taking place Lord and the devil if he could he he'd love just to take that life and snuff it out early it'd love to fill that mind with continued doubt and fear Lord but I just ask that you'd help me tonight Lord if I could just present you in such a way that would break the grip of the enemy out of that young man out of that young lady Lord and tonight they can say from that time I was changed forever I pray God that you would just come right now Lord and maybe a life God it was in Youth meetings like this I'm reminded very similar to this just years ago a young lady came to that camp and her life had taken a wrong turn and was upside down and going the wrong direction and in relationship she shouldn't have been in but somehow Grace somehow Grace intervened and she found herself there amongst Believers lord and there could be just a young lady just like that here tonight maybe a young man who Satan is head bound but he maybe's not what he should be doesn't look the part and he feels A Million Miles Away much like that girl did Lord it would be at that youth camp that she would come home Lord it would be at that Youth Camp Lord where the preaching of the word of God would so stir her heart she'd come to an altar and surrender her whole life to the Lord Jesus and little did she know that on her way home to her natural home she'd be in a car accident and she'd go to her Heavenly Home little did she know Lord that that service she was in was her last opportunity your Prophet said there will be a last sermon that we hear a time when we turn our Bible for the last time I pray God if there'd be anybody that would be here tonight Lord let them hear the voice of your of your of the Beloved let them hear the the voice of their father speaking Lord and may they respond to Grace we ask it now Lord may your word go forth we pray have Liberty and have your way in Jesus name amen you can be seated the Apostle Paul here in Ephesians chapter 6 and I know this scripture is very familiar to you what he's saying here is that there's a real struggle it's a very real battle it's invisible you could say in some ways though sometimes we can see the external manifestations of it but internally there's a real struggle a real battle a real war that's taking place and I just want to say that the battle that you fight is not against it's not a battle of flesh and blood it's not a physical problem at all in fact no matter what you would name me here tonight if you were to list some of your struggles that you have and you could say brother Matt these are some of the some of the battles that I face and sometimes when I have defeat it's in these areas of my life and I'm struggling with this area and I'm struggling over here and I need the Lord to give me victory in fact it wouldn't matter what you put on that list none of those things would be confined to what you listed but actually beyond that physical Struggle No matter what it is is a spiritual problem and that physical attribute is only the manifestation of something that's taking place supernaturally you see you may look at addictions and you can look and think that that problem is a real physical problem and so you treat that physical symptom you could look at addictions of alcohol and we give people good programs for that you know Alcoholics Anonymous or you could take a psychologist route you could have addictions to drugs and you could try to get them help and I'm not saying anything sometimes that's all the help that some people can get but I'm so glad that we've got more weapons to fight the devil with than just what are made by human hands but our weapons the Bible says are not caral but they're spiritual they're Mighty to the pulling down of all strongholds and so you can look at addiction and you could see it as that physical problem but what we must understand as Christians is that actually it's a demon spirit that has been given access to the vessel of that person in their life through unbelief because brother said that's the only channel that the devil can get to a Christian is through doubt or unbelief how many can say Amen to that and so anytime that you see a problem whether it's addictions to pornography drugs alcohol wouldn't matter what you can name here tonight it is all a stronghold that is only the result of that individual taking on a spirit or giving way to a stronghold in their life and now that stronghold that they have has produced an outward problem and then we label that problem depression we label it anxiety we label it fear we label it doesn't matter if it's a physical disease the way that brother bham taught us about healing when he preaches what cancer is is that cancer actually is only the outside physical body that tumor is just the outside physical substance of the life of that spirit that is living off of the life of that host as brother Al and different Brothers the Travis last night talked about that that Satan must have an object he must have a vessel he must have something that he can work through to express himself sounded good brother uh you could keep it where it was sounded good up here um just a moment ago you can bring that up just some so we we as Believers understand this that it's not a it's not a flesh and blood battle but it's a spiritual problem it's a spiritual wickedness in other dimensions what we must realize is that that spirit that we feel as the prophet of God said it this way he said that when you come to church sometimes you come there and maybe a song is sang maybe maybe a sister or a brother gets up and sings a special and you just feel that warm feeling come over you and and sometimes you can't explain it you don't know why uh but you it just makes you just want to just raise your hands up to the Lord and something within you just raise his hands up and you start to enter in how many ever felt that way other times you you hear the preaching of the word of God and you could just feel it at that moment and something within you just wants to agree with the word of God and you you you might mutter it under your breath and no one could hear it but you say amen and because you believe it you know sometimes it do you good to to get a little bit more vocal with that I believe it do you some good and it back the devil off of some of us if we'd start confessing and start pulling on the word of God it it it liberates it has the power to liberate you as we said it can change your atmosphere it can change everything around you if the devil can do anything he'll just get you to shut up don't say anything and just give in and back you into a corner sometimes we ought to stand up to the bully in our life and say Satan you're not going to push me around anymore I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm not who you say I am I'm who the word says that I am and so many times we take this and we need to realize brother bam said you feel that under the preaching of the word and you start to feel that feeling and he said other times you you don't know why you can't explain it but you just begin to cry and you begin to weep and he says you don't know why nothing but what whatever it was brother the prophet of God says you don't know why you're crying but you just find yourself feeling something that's beyond what you see it's beyond what you're even hearing you know sometimes the word of God is more than what you hear preached it's what you feel in your soul as the prophet of God said you hear from your theophany and many times the prophet says when you feel that he says what is is doing that and he says it this way you're bumping into that other dimension Hallelujah and he says you're bumping into it you don't realize it but you're bumping into Angels oh I I just believe here tonight if there's anything I want to bump into it's Angelic spirits to say Lord let me bump into that other dimension so if it's true that way with angels then how much more is it true when we start to feed on the wrong things get in the wrong atmospheres and suddenly we feel depression we feel worry we feel fear we feel anxiety we're bumping into that other dimension and so you can find this here and I just want to take time just to lay this Foundation through and make it real clear what we understand is that these problems are not flesh and blood but they're actually Spirits in another dimension you could find that in the book of Jude and it talks about the Angels which kept not their first estate now I want you to know notice something here because in the Book of Revelations chapter 9 and I know I'm not here to teach on that here tonight but just to drop this in for a moment it talks about Lucifer and also in Revelations 12 and it talks about how that Lucifer uh the the first battle that took place how many knows brother bandham says that the battle happens in three places it starts in heaven and it starts with Michael it starts with Lucifer and and the Devil deceives the angels and he says then that battle when Lucifer is cast out of Heaven he says moves into the Earth and that's your dimension it's your spiritual warfare you're facing now and he says in one day that same battle that started in heaven and is now in Earth will finally end up in the battle of Armageddon in the valley of Armageddon when all the armies of the world will Encompass Jerusalem and the prophet says it this way that battle of Armageddon will only be the final battle from the war that started in heaven and so we must need to realize that just as much as that's a very real physical battle that would take place there's a battle very real that's happening today yes sir and you are caught in the midst of influence from either Angels or demons you know brother Brandon points this out in the church age book and he says that notice how that the scripture talks about second Peter chapter 2 talks about it also how that a how that Lucifer deceived the angels angels are given free moral agency they have the ability to choose and the Bible says that Lucifer LED 2/3 of the Angels now this is incredible because the Bible says he drew them with his tail the Tail of the Dragon but brother brandham by prophetic Insight says it's not his tail t a i l but it was his tail t a l e it's what he told them you see the devil has preachers it's not just gospel preachers but the devil has many agents or vessels that he uses to influence us it could be music it could be the wrong movies it could be the wrong friends it could be the wrong things on Facebook uhoh don't get quiet on me could be the you don't use Facebook that's for old fogies well what about Instagram and and and now they banned Tik Tok so I can't say that and and and Snapchat and all these others I don't want to show my age but listen here's what I know I know that the that what's not changed is the battle television is what brother brandham identified as the fourth dimension where demon Spirits operate through television and they bring influence to homes he said that's why now you don't have family life anymore is because the influence from that fourth dimension through television has destroyed the family structure now a man doesn't know what a man is a woman doesn't know what a woman is my goodness friends are we not living in Satan's Eden we are living at the manifestation of what a prophet seen years and years ago when he prophesied in the fourth vision of the seven that he has and he says one of the things I seen before the go before the destruction of the Earth was that women begin to get out of their place and he says and men were sissies don't think that this entire agenda of a man's bathroom and a woman's bathroom we don't know what a woman is don't know what a man is happened by accident a prophet already seen it by vision and you're living in the manifestation of it I am so glad that I don't have to listen to the nonsense and the confusion of the world but I've been given the mind of Christ and I know what the Bible said and it doesn't matter what a professor says it doesn't matter what scientists say I wish somebody would help me preach it only matters what the absolute word of God says that's the truth not a truth it is the only truth and so notice this was a spirit and it's amazing because the Bible says that he leads them as Jude says the Angels which kept not their first estate so you say brother Matt what is a demon Spirit a demon is an angel that has fallen now I want you to notice because brother Brandon makes this so clear in the church age book and another when he preaches especially demonology I I just want to I want to make sure I cover What the Lord Has us to cover and I I just don't I'm not going to be able to get to all of this so we just have a certain amount of time but I want you to I want to make you aware of something you could go to the next slide brother and just hold that up here for a moment I want you to notice something because the scripture teaches us that there are real beings real angels these are creatures intelligent creatures Crees not just some figment or some story that somebody made this is real creatures that have the ability to bring influence and so the Bible says that they're Supernatural beyond our human senses but can I just say this and I want you to remember it they are there all the time they are there when you wake up they are there when you go to bed they are there when you are at church hearing the preaching of the word of God oh yeah the devil sometimes is the most faithful church member that we've got he's there early he's there waiting on you to get there to try to do everything he can to distract you from receiving from the Holy Spirit but he's there all the time a demon spirit is always there but I can also remind you angels are always there also and the prophet of God said what do we have here in the building tonight we have the preaching of the word of God we have God's family here he says we have demon Spirits here trying to affect the people's minds as the preaching Goes Forth and he says but also we have Angels encamped about us and he says they're trying to energize our faith oh I wonder if we just invite them tonight and say angels of God energize my faith I'm a vessel who can receive I'm going to close the door of the demons and I'm going to open the door to Angels I might have came here down and cast down and worried and with anxiety and depression of this camp but today I'm going to leave them here and I'm going to go on with joy with happiness with peace you don't have to leave here with that God can deliver you from it and so notice it's a spiritual host around us both of good angels and bad angels I want to say this you will not choose whether you are influenced by Angels you will only choose what Angels influence youtiful because we live in a world today to where the B brother baram says the lid of hell has been torn off I know I I know that I'm preaching to young people but I just be honest I don't believe I got to preach to you any different than I do anybody I believe I I I believe that we've got a generation of young people that listen to the message and read their books listen to their tapes and read their Bibles and if you don't I would encourage you to do it did you ever notice your feed it's called a feed whether it's Facebook Instagram doesn't matter what it is anybody ever notice that it's called a feed why do you think it's called a feed that's right they're feeding you something it's so incredible to me how many times we're so wanting to be freed of anxiety and depression and yet yet we don't realize the very thing we want to be free of is the very thing we are feeding because I know it's not just in the United States of America North America it's covered SE to Sea and it's amazing because it's one of the things I preached youth camps last year and the Lord just gave me Grace never done it before in as many countries as I did I I I just country after country preach You Youth Camps I don't consider myself to be honest a good youth preacher a good Youth Camp preacher but um but the Lord was was able to use me uh the last year and it was incredible Even in our own youth camp we had prayer lines and prayer lines at every Youth Camp I was in Honduras I was in Poland I was in Belgium I was all kinds of places and and it was didn't matter what country does it matter what language they spoke it over overall 90% of the needs were needs of depression needs of uh uh spirits of anxiety it's it's like it's a pandemic in this generation and I'm going to tell you it's not an accident the prophet of God when he's talking about scientific achievement and he says this and I'm just going to paraphrase this he says that science has advanced at such a rapid Pace that he says that Humanity can't handle it the senses can't handle it and it's producing neurosis and a neurotic age of neurotic people because of the rapid development of technology and so we know that we're living in the in the day of progress where things are rapidly coming on the scene not just it's not not doesn't take years to develop something anymore now it just happens just immediately it's just just year just a few years ago we were joking about artificial intelligence and robots well listen friends it's a reality now it's not it's not it's not a it's not just something that we we talk about you know it's going to be in the year you know this year 2090 and it's it's right here upon you right now now artificial intelligence and and the prophet of God says that he says that beyond the when the horse and buggy came he said that was a type there then it went from there to the automobile then it went from there to the jet aircraft and he says but that wasn't the end progress would continue into astronauts and the prophet of God says it was a type of the word that God was restoring to his people that science is only one step behind God because whatever science is doing in the natural God is doing in the Supernatural That's why it says about the time man Wright brothers were coming off the ground in North Carolina my home state and they were learning how to fly he says there about that same time and California there was a little group of in a dingy Hall that no one really cared about no one was insignificant to everybody a group of Pentecostals and he said they begin to speak in tongues into that isua Street Revival and he says what was it as man was coming off the ground God's family was starting to get off the ground and learning how to fly and brother bam says but that's not where it stopped we're not in that course and buggy age we're not in the the the jet aircraft age he says now there's an astronaut age and we're spiritual astronauts going beyond the dimensions of this world and we soar like eagles in other dimensions but did you know brother bandam says it doesn't stop there and he says the only thing left to come is him himself the intelligence so beyond the mouth the hands is the eyes and brother bam says what was that it was a type of the prophetic Vision a prophet of Mali 4 but beyond that you see many people stop there but you don't stop there you got to keep progressing with the word brother brandham says but as The Headstone comes down it brings the intelligence listen friends artificial intelligence is only artificial but I got something that's not artificial I've got the mind of Christ and you've got access to that mind here tonight and so it's amazing to me because so many times we feed on those things and people feed and feed and feed and they get more depressed and more depressed and more anxiety more worry they won't deliver listen friends can I just make it so simple you will never get freed from a demon that you're feeding you will never no matter how much you cry and scream and beat at this altar ask brother brother after brother seek brother to lay hands on you you will never get freed from it so long as you are are feeding it I should have get a big old amen as long as you're feeding it it's so amazing to me you know it's so amazing to me because people feed and feed and feed and feed and feed you know brother Vern it's so incredible can I just testify tonight never one time have I ever turned on a tape of the prophet and when the tape is over I feel anxiety depression I'm worried it's never happened I've never got on done reading my Bible got up off my knees and knees and my heart's pounding because I'm so fearful and so anxiety and so much worry and so much stress and friends can I just say can we make it not so complicated make it simple I think it's time we stop feeding on the things that make us depressed and anxiety and worried and we start feeding on the things that give us faith and give us hope and give us life and give us joy we ought to shut the dimension of the devil and say I'm opening the door to angels to come and min Minister down to my spirit and so this is another dimension it's a very real one the Bible says that there's good ones and bad ones a a host of an army that's all around us in Revelations chapter 9 it talks about those 200 million demon Spirit Chargers that were bound at the river Euphrates and the brother Adam says but at the sounding of that six trumpet they were released to cross the Euphrates river and he says they begin to stream into the Earth that's what that's the anointing that Hitler came under Stalin ikan it's what he says in the six seal musolini they come under the spirit of those demon Chargers because they were Unleashed upon the Earth and they attacked the Jews now brother bandam says that was th those spiritual Chargers that had been bound at that River and they were Unleashed upon Humanity into what dimension brother Matt the fourth dimension now you say what is that fourth dimension that fourth dimension is the dimension of science now I got a question for you does anybody hear voices of radio movies television anybody hear that right now no you just hear my voice you maybe hear the sound of the crashing waves out there but you don't hear any of that anybody hear the voice of someone performing in a a music uh Symphony in an orchestra anybody hear that right now I hope you don't no one hears that but yet the prophet of God says it's here right now and he says all you'd have to do is get a crystal or a receiver to input that signal and it would display for you on the television how many remember that when brother bam talks about that and so he says those Spirits are only here in that fourth dimension it's that dimension of science brother bandham said that's the dimensions prophets operate in by by Vision it's also where diseases move through it's that channel of travel that you can move from one place to the next you see brother vam says that man lives in a multi-dimensional environment I just I just want to to take this because I believe it's so basic but I I think it we ought to just remind ourselves sometimes of these things in this other dimension because these bad angels are not in some deep dark layer somewhere in an underworld but the Bible says they are in other dimensions in Heavenly places that's where all angels are the good and the bad ones so the real battle taking place right now is not necessarily happening on this Dimension but it's actually happening in another dimension a dimension that we're affected by at all times because brother bam says that man lives in a multi-dimensional environment how many remember brother B I'm saying that seven dimensions all around us heaven and hell are just across the chasm and that's why brother Adam says that when we die we don't go A Million Miles Away we only change dimensions and so you say where did all this start from Brother Matt just take break it down here for a moment you can see that this was the Book of Ezekiel and I'm just going to read this to you Lucifer you could you could Advance it it talks about Lucifer which is that word Lucifer is actually a transliterated word it just means the Morning Star the light says in the Book of Ezekiel you were the signant talking about Lucifer of perfection full of wisdom perfect in Beauty you were in Eden the Garden of God and every precious stone was your covering you were an anointed Guardian cherub I placed you you were on the Holy Mountain of God in the midst of the stones of fire you walked you were blameless in all of your ways from the day thou were created until unrighteousness or iniquity the King James says was found in you so this was where it all began this is where evil started it started in a battle and this Angel who had free moral agency had a desire in his heart to be worshiped just as God is worshiped he doesn't want a bar stool he's already got it he doesn't want the the dance hall he's already got it what he wants is a church because what he wants is worship and so he starts with this ambition to be like the most high God as it says Thou said in your heart I will Ascend to the hill of God I will be like the most high this was his ambition so he deceives angels that were in heaven and they become fallen angels look at how Jude says it in Jude chapter 1 verse 6 and the angels who did not stay I'm reading this from the uh Amplified it's very brings out just a very good uh uh understanding of and the angels who did not stay with their own position of authority King James says who left their first estate but left their proper dwelling he has kept in Chains under gloomy darkness and till the Judgment of the great day 2 Peter 2:4 for if God did not spare Angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy Darkness to be kept until the Judgment Revelations 12:9 and the Great Dragon was thrown down where was Satan cast to your dimension so he leaves heaven and now what was a Heavenly battle has became an Earthly battle and so the Bible says he was cast down thrown down that ancient serpent who's called the devil and Satan the deceiver of the whole world he was thrown down to the Earth and his angels were thrown down with him Matthew 12 speaks of the ruler of the Demons when the Pharisees heard it they said it's only beable the ruler of the demons that this fellow cast out demons so notice even Daniel I don't have time to pick it up but when Daniel's praying you remember the scripture when Michael the Bible says the Archangel came to Daniel and said Daniel I heard you when you prayed the first time I've came for your words with the very first moment you begin to pray all Heaven dispatched an army unto you but the Prince of Persia hindered me so what was it it's not just listen friends when you pray you're not just repeating a prayer you're not just doing it because you than you should you need to recognize that every time you is a Christian bow your head and pray the prayer of faith you are leaving this Dimension and you're moving into another dimension where God can hear your prayer and dispatch angels on your oh you may not feel it you may not think it you may not see it but you can have faith tonight that the same God who heard Daniel's prayer he's the prayer of the faintest Cry of a Believer it doesn't matter if you are the brother bam said it don't matter how weak you feel as a Christian you may be the skin on the bottom of the feet in the body of Christ but that still means you got every devil underneath your feet and the Bible says he hears the prayers of the righteous and so we have you say brother Matt oh there's demons and there's another dimension and you're speaking about beable well can I just remind you just so much brother bham says as those 10 200 million demons I love this were loosed at the river Euphrates who had been bound there for thousands of years brother bham says but also the Holy Ghost was also Bound by Creeds and denominations and dogmas of men but by the preaching of the word of God and the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the Holy Ghost was Unleashed and unloosed and what does it mean my brother my sister he is accessible to you as a Christian you can bow your head and pray to your father you don't need a priest you don't need a preacher you don't need a your mother your father you have access as a son or daughter of God to your father's name oh we ought to rejoice in that tonight that we have a tower we have a refuge we can run to when we're overwhelmed David said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I don't give me just man's Solutions I I'm done with man's Solutions don't even give me my own ideas lead me to the rock that is higher than I Hallelujah so notice I just we just hear for a moment Mark chapter 9 I I don't know if we'll cover all of these you can keep going the Bible speaks of this someone from the crowd answered him teacher I brought my son to you for there has a spirit that makes him mute and whenever it seases him it throws him down and he Foams and grinds his teeth this is a very real problem this is a physical manifestation of a demon spirit in a young boy and this his dad is saying every time that that he has a spirit makes him mute and it seizes him and throws him down he Foams and grinds so I asked your disciples to cast it on they were not able and he answered and said said oh faithless generation how long am I to be with you how long am I to bear with you bring him to me so they brought the boy to him and when the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy and he fell on the ground and rode about foaming at the mouth and Jesus asked his father and said how long has this been happening to him and he said from childhood and it has often cast him into fire and into water and to destroy him but if you can do anything I love this but if you can do anything have compassion on us and help us I am so glad that they found the right person to bring their problem to friends we so many times bring our problems to the wrong source of help but you've got a source of help you can bring your issues too and your problems too and he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble he's a he's a strong tower that the righteous can run into and be saved and he can deliver and save how many believes that here tonight he is still a deliverer of the bound he is still a Healer of those that are sick yes sir he still sets free and so notice this here they they come to him again Jesus said I love this so much Jesus said to him if you can all things are possible for one who believes immediately the father of the child the of the child cried out and said I believe how many can say this I believe help my my unbelief and when Jesus saw that the crowd came running he rebuked the unclean Spirit saying you m and mute and deaf spirit I command you he doesn't notice this this is what we were saying here the first night he doesn't say thou sudden sensor neural hearing loss thou vestibular tubes that have locked up and now audal nerve Jesus never gets into the science at all because the doctors deal in that Dimension but to get real Freedom you've got to deal in really what it is and they might give it a name but what it actually is is is a demon spirit and until you call it for what it is you listen friends as long as we pet our problems and we don't identify them and we and we pet our anxiety and that's just my anxiety don't call it your anxiety that's just how I Was Made that's just the family I was raised in well what does that have anything to do with the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus stops the Bloodlines of humanity brother brandham says that I realized I'm not the son of Charles andella brandham I'm a child of God and I have access to my father's name I don't have anything hereditary except this I've got a name in Heaven by where with the whole family of Earth of in heaven is named the after the name of Jesus that means I have his inheritance I'm a join a with him and his promises we we quoted this from our scripture I'm just going to skip it brother you can go to slide dine notice now light matter and time I love this and our five senses contact them Dimensions our sight contacts light our feelings contact matter and so forth but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact but yet they have a tuber Crystal that picks up those ether waves and manifest them so you see right in this building now is live actions of people in the air live voices they're here we know it they're absolutely truth the only thing they catch it on I don't understand the mechanics of those things that science has invented but we know that it proves to us that there's a fourth dimension now I could take an entire teaching on that because I believe we should as Believers have dimensional discernment and in other words we should discern the things that we're feeding upon what are they doing and what effect are they having in our life I believe one of the greatest problems and one of the greatest reasons why we fail the Lord the way that we do sometimes all comes down to our spiritual diet and appetite I know that's so profound isn't it it's so simple it all comes down to what are we feeding on listen friends if the only time you hear quotes of God's Prophet is when you are in church I promise you you will be a spiritually unhealthy believer the prophet of God said in the church AG book no believer no believer is any more spiritually healthy than he than his adherence to the word of God mhm is not an answer no believer is any more spiritually healthy than his than his ad adherence and obedience is adherence brother random says to the word preached to the word of God and so I believe with all my heart and I just I'm just going to lay this in because I feel it from the Lord I believe that if we would begin as a church as young people not just to go throughout the day and do our normal things that we do and we get in the same routines of life but I believe that as as Believers if we would have a life dedicated to feeding on the word of God it would fix 99% of our problems if you would hear the voice on the tape I'm talking about the voice of God's Prophet if you would make that more than just the times you come to church but have a daily appetite a daily diet it would fix 99% of your problems that you have in your life come on everybody wants a one quick quick solution while I just gave it to you it'd fix most of the problems if we'd start communing with the Lord Opening Our Bibles hearing the voice of God hearing the voice of the Lord more than just a devotion H devotions are great but actually spending time with the Lord amen is that all right New Zealand and so notice because brother Adam says that man lives in this environment I just want to put the take the the the shifter here and take it out of fifth gear and we're going to put it in neutral here for a second all right all right brother Brandon teaches us man lives in this multi-dimensional environment and we as human beings are subjected to these seven dimensions around us at all times as the prophet says if you're a Christian and a Believer and you've been born again and he says if you're a Christian and you die he says you go into that sixth dimension of a place of paradise where the dead in Christ go waiting to be and go back to being young again in a Celestial body waiting for the day when Christ shall come back to earth in the Rapture and pick up and raise up their mortal bodies from the dust of the earth to one that's Incorruptible Immortal as brother bam says the Christian when he dies he's at rest he goes to a paradise there's no more struggle there's no more suffering in if he died his brother alary did such a beautiful job on that here today on what happens to those that die of their sickness listen friends at the moment that they breathe their last breath they enter into a very real place it's a place with mountains it's a place with beautiful Skies it's a place with beauty it's a place of peace there's no trouble there's no worry there's no anxiety there there's no stressing out over problems there's just perfect peace all the time and that Christian if he's born again he goes into that land of rest into that theophany body a body not made with hands but a body that's prepared the Bible says that Paul said it this way if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one waiting prepared for us in the heavens and so there's no kind of Meandering or just stuck or lost somewhere that Christian goes to a real place and brother bandham says oh my brother my sister he says to when I got over there and I seen that he says no word could describe it no no word in the human dictionary could describe that place Sublime wouldn't even begin to touch it the prophets begin to get so wrapped up in it he says all I can say to you is whatever you do in your life don't miss it whatever you do in your life no matter what you think is important right now oh I just want to preach here for a moment you might think your education is the most important thing you might think your spouse or who you're going to marry or what where where you're going to live I just want to say to you there is nothing more important than you meet the Lord Jesus for yourself there is nothing that you can give up nothing that you can turn aside and sacrifice that is worth heaven and Eternity it's a real place it's a real land a land just beyond this reach of mortal King just beyond this Dimension the prophet of God said they enter into that real place it's a Believer where a Believer goes and brother Bram says oh they're at rest they're in that body of rest one day they'll come back to that body we laid in the grave and stored that body and the prophet says they'll take that body it'll be glor it'll be it'll be it'll be changed and he says and that theophany body and that Earthly body will come together and make up a glorified body Incorruptible Immortal brother bam says oh but if you die a sinner if you die having never surrendered your life to the Lord Jesus now remember the prophet of God said I'm going to make this so so so so it may seem narrow but I'm going to make it just the way brother brandham did remember remember that to to be apathetic towards him not to not to just say I don't want anything to do with him but just to shun him and not respond to Grace the prophet say is the same as rejecting him yeah right so just to have an apathetic heart or to say uh not right now maybe later but not right now because brother Adam says if you die and you're a sinner and you never in your life you've missed or failed to heed the grace that God has extended to you I think sometimes we're not aware of how many times Grace knocks on our door amen I think we're not aware of how many times you you just you you you think it's Mom and you think it's Dad and oh it's just just just what the way that they are you don't recognize that behind that voice of that mother that father that Pastor that preacher behind all of their behind all of what you see externally is the outstretched arms of the Lord Jesus trying to reach you by Grace if you're a sinner and you never repented of your sins and accepted the Lord as your personal Lord and Savior you go to a place called The Fifth Dimension it's where the souls of the wicked are imprisoned awaiting the great final great white Throne judgment to be judged according to the Deeds Done in their body I just want to say this because the Apostle Paul said all of us shall stand before the Judgment seat of Christ doesn't matter how rich you are doesn't matter how educated you are rich man will stand there popular men will stand there movie stars will stand there presidents will stand there dictators will stand there doesn't matter what their stature was in life death does not discriminate all of us the Bible says will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ you will not choose whether you stand before the judgment seat you will only choose when you stand before that judgment seat of Christ because to the born again the Judgment seat is the word of God and it's judging your life now and you in this Dimension have the opportunity right now to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and say judge me oh God and if there's anything in my life that is displeasing to you then strip it out of my life strip it out of my spirit oh God I don't want it anymore I take my pride as the prophet said and I stomp it under my feet I take all of my anger and my temper and my jealousy and my lust and I say I don't want it anymore God Judge Me Oh God by your word and let me be judged by a righteous God who can give me his righteousness but one day those who have never heed that will stand before the Judgment seat of God and brother bam says this this way in the next slide this Fifth Dimension is where the center the unbeliever dies and goes to The Fifth Dimension is the kind of well the horrible Dimension when a Christian dies he goes to the sixth Dimension and God is in the seventh Dimension now then you see the Christian when he dies he goes under the altar of God right into the presence of God Under The Altar and he's at rest to break it down when a man has a nightmare and he's not altogether asleep nor is he awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on the earth he can't go into the presence of God he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught he can't come back to earth because his time's finished on Earth and he's caught between couldn't imagine that there would be people that sat in church services and with their mortal ears heard the voice of God and for whatever they valued more like Felix when he heard the preaching of Paul and Paul the Bible says he fell under the conviction of his sermon and right at the moment at that that moment when he was ready to surrender the Bible says Felix said leave me Paul for at a more convenient time I'll call for you the Bible never records whatever happens to him only God knows but I couldn't imagine that a person who could live and sit in message churches and hear sermons and hear the preaching of the word of God have mothers and fathers who pray for them and talk and pray for them and send them to camps how could they ever end up caught stuck he's in a nightmare he can't go into the presence of God to rest he can't come back to earth because it's time up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment prophet of God sees it and he's shot with the gun he's in that hospital bed and going in and out of Consciousness and he says I then began to fall out and he says I just fell through the bed and he says and it just felt like I was falling and falling and falling and he says down in there I seen the faces of those women with that dark makeup around their eyes and hands reaching out and brother Bron begins to cry out to God and he says oh god oh if you'll just deliver me out of here out of this place he said all I could say to God at that moment was Lord I I've tried to do good I I I've tried to never tell a lie and he says oh he says every time I tried to get something out I couldn't hardly get it out of my mouth and he just begin to cry out to God he says God if you could ever if you'd just save me from this Lord I'll serve you the rest of my life life brother bams later in tucon and he's in JC Pennies and he sees those Hispanic sis women coming down the escalator speaking another language and he says I fell right back under that Vision seeing that horrible place of Hell friends I don't think it's an accident that we had a messenger who not only went to the other side beyond the curtain of time but he also went to hell and he went there to tell you don't ever find yourself there young person don't ever find yourself fall there is a it's a bottomless pit you don't ever want to find yourself there and he says oh but here in that same place the BAM talks about this and he says I had my hands there on my bed and he says I had my hands behind my head and he says I laid down on my pillow and says oh oh Bill brandom if you're ever going to do anything for the Lord you better get started I think of that brother Al and I think my goodness if he ain't done nothing for the Lord at that point then what have I done if I was there in that room I'd say brother brandham what are you talking about you're the ministry that's went around the world seven times raised the dead blind eyes open crutches and hospital beds and Cs and and and and and he's looking to do more for the kingdom of God and brother bandam says he's just lay there he says he says I heard that voice and he says I begin to he starts singing that song to feel Lonesome and blue and and he says I heard that voice and it just spoke to me and says would you like to look beyond the curtain and I love how brother brandom says that he says oh it would help me so much I just want to tell brother brandham one day it helped me so much and the prophet of God says I believe that in this Vision I I believe I was called to that sixth Dimension you go to the next one if you could and he says looking back down here I could see back and you see sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's Earthly but sight is greater thing the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses would contact and so brother Bron begins to relate this how that he goes there and he says I seen people and the begin he says they were long flowing hair the sisters had and gowns flowing down and he says and there he says they they were running up to me saying oh our our precious brother our precious brother oh I don't I don't want to take too much time but we could just preach on this here all all night tonight it was such a wonderful place brother brandham says he says oh I just didn't want to go back and and and here and I was just reading it here today and that mean by the hour Fellowship hour is fellowshipping on this what brother randam sees there and there's his wife and and you know all the things that he seen there was his chair there was his chair that he lost couldn't pay the bill and they took it from him but you see everything you lose on this side you gain on that side you see that's a land without loss it's a land of only gain and brother bham says oh he says uh he says do I have to go back he says he yes you you have to go back and and and and he says and one day we'll come to you you know that you know the story very very well the way he tells it and the prophet of God begins to relate that and he begins to talk about how that that voice told him and he says I don't understand and he says all that you loved and all that you ever loved God has given it to you what a contrast this was between that place of hell and that place beyond the other curtain just on the other side the prophet of God says I just want to say to you whatever you do lay aside everything doesn't matter what you put in that bucket doesn't matter what you put in that list lay aside everything until you get perfect love in your heart to where you can love everybody you can love even your enemy and brother bham says whatever you do friend don't miss it don't miss it don't fail to heed the opportunity when Grace reaches out and stretches out a arm a hand of Mercy to pick you up don't think that you'll have another moment I have more life to live you don't have that promise in fact none of us have that promise none of us have a promise everyone thinks they'll just live and go on and on and on and on and on never never would have dreamed that a life could be cut off so short that a life could just be just like that could just be taken you don't know what's happening you don't know what faces you tomorrow you don't know what Waits you when you leave this Youth Camp yeah that's right the prophet of God says that even he himself I know I quoted this the first night says I should have came to the Lord long before I did but a spirit hung over me and told me I had more time I could not imagine much things worse as I sat here and pondered as the Lord began to deal with my heart on this sermon and I was just writing these notes and just so affected by the by the the loss that we experienced and I just said I could I could not imagine you know something worse could you imagine anything worse than going to hell could you imagine living your whole life and then ending up in this place that wasn't even made for you the prophet of God says it this way he says God will never condemn a man and send him to hell for being a sinner because he had no choice but he says what will condemn the man is that he remained a sinner and he didn't have to he says in another place if you ever do go to hell you will have to climb over every barrier you will have to Bar barge over every barricade oh friend sometimes I wonder sometimes what are we doing with our life a and and you wouldn't get in the car and go down the road and and say road closed and barricade and just take your car and just Barrel through those barricades and Barrel through those signs Broken Road broken bridge do not enter do not cross wrong way when any of us get in our car and just Barrel over but how many times does God send warning sign after warning sign after warning sign in our life and he saying sermon after sermon after sermon and yet we just keep going through it and keep going through it and keep going through it today as the Bible says is the day of salvation Harden not your hearts couldn't imagine anything worse then I said no no there's something much worse than hell there's something so much worse you say how could it be worse for the that that place in that horrible Dimension like a nightmare and he's stuck what could be worse what would be worse than hell would be the voices like that rich man in Lazarus was like that rich young ruler who brother Brandon says Jesus looking upon Him loved him and he says what must I do to inherit eternal life sell all you have that may not been the the remedy for everybody but God knew what his God was and he knew what he wasn't willing to let go of and you could imagine as he he hears the voice brother Bram says you don't change death doesn't change you it only changes your dwelling place and who you are here you will be there and the prophet of God says couldn't even he could hear that voice the voice of him telling go get Lazar go get a go go you know go go send them Lazarus and and the the the voice says even though one raised from the dead they still wouldn't believe I couldn't imagine anything worse than hell until I imagine having to be there and think about all the opportunities that I had in my life to surrender my whole heart to God I couldn't imagine anything worse than hearing the voices of preachers and ministers and parents and people that loved me and prayed for me and yet knowing I missed my opportunity you say surely brother Matt that's terrible oh but there's something much worse you say worse than going to hell worse than knowing the opportunities you miss what could be worse than that what would be worse than that is not just me being there but all of those that would be with me there who I failed to tell about Jesus who I failed to tell about his love and his compassion and his Mercy it would be all those who I left an imprint in my life and an impact and my impact of my life never affected them in a way that they would come to the Lord Jesus themselves I couldn't imagine anything worse than my family who I had led and who I had loved and my children couldn't imagine brother Al anything worse until I think of the voices and the people that would be there in that place with me oh my brother and my sister can I just stay here tonight there's nothing more important in your life that you know him not about him not his dress code not his Doctrine not his teachings but you know the author for yourself because when you know him you have all of his promises you have all of his benefits you say brother Matt do you live a perfect life no I don't do you ever have trouble trouble all the time tribulation on a daily basis trials weekly but here's what I have I have precious promises I have hope that my hope is not in this life and in this world and in this government and in this world system but I have a promise of a home just beyond the reach of mortal kin just beyond the last breath is a real place and a real home with real people living real lives as brother bam says that life is just a continuation of this life but without the struggle without the pain without the torment oh don't you want to go to that place my brother my sister and I thought about my I thought about this as I just the Lord begin to deal with my heart I couldn't imagine anything better than Heaven I couldn't imagine anything better than heaven but can I tell you that just as there's something worse than hell there's something better than going to heaven you say what is something better going to heaven brother Matt all those that I love and that loved me all my children all my family all of my loved ones you say what's better than going to heaven all of those that I've prayed for there in that Eternal home with me and there's no more pain and there's no more struggle oh does anybody feel the way that I feel here tonight there will be nothing greater on that day I'm looking forward uh to that place but it's not the place it's who's in that place because beyond all my loved ones is the Lord Jesus and one day I'll look upon him the one that's loved me when I was unlovable the one that saved me when I was unsavable and one day when I see him oh I can only imagine what I will do on that day when I see my Lord Jesus when I look upon his face oh I want to go I wonder if You' just buy your heads with me here tonight every head bowed every eye closed thank you Lord thank you Jesus he cares he cared enough for a woman it was a little girl she rejected the Lord as a teenager she then entered her 20s and never came to the Lord entered her 30s and still never surrendered her heart only got harder as the further she went in her 50s she strayed from the Lord still running as hard as she could even past her 50s she went into her 60s that way but can I tell you about a god who's full of grace he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to life brother bandham sees that woman there and he doesn't recognize her and she says brother brandom you led me to the Lord when I was past 90 years old you want to talk about a God full of grace who a woman who had turned him and rejected him her whole life but right at the moment when it was almost too late Mercy stepped in and rewrote that woman's life at 90 years old oh my brother and my sister if that's the god of Grace how much more is God's grace for you here tonight sitting at this Youth Camp a Grace that's reaching out in a mercy trying to reach you I wonder if you just respond and say Lord I'm reaching out my hands to you right now saying God I res God bless those hands up everywhere God I am responding to the grace that I've heard about tonight Lord I don't do it out of fear I don't serve you out of fear but I I I serve you out of love lord it's because I want the things of righteousness I want the things of Holiness I don't want this world and its wickedness and its evil and its toxicity and its hatred and its Neurosis I don't want anymore God I don't want to be influenced how many could say Lord I don't want to be influenced by a dimension of depress depression and fear and worry and doubt and struggle I want to open the dimension to angels and say angels of God come and Quicken my spirit minister to my soul God bless those hands I wonder with those you could stand to your feet here tonight with those hands raised everybody in the building stand with those hands raised and say Lord Jesus I choose to be influenced by angels from above I choose to be influenced by that Dimension where there's love and peace and hope and Harmony and joy forgiveness is there that unforgiving heart Jesus can heal it right now don't let that thing that root of bitterness the Bible says spring up and Def thereby defile many don't let it take you brother don't let that root of hatred don't let that that root of bitterness don't let that Spirit of lust brother don't let it take you down to a sinner's hell God can set you free from that right now now you don't have to leave here you don't have to leave this Camp the same oh hands up everywhere Lord you see them both of my hands are up God just as a sign of surrender surrendering to you Lord I wonder if there' just be one maybe more than one and not to me but to the Lord in a personal way you just say Lord I want to know you you in the way I heard tonight if Lord I want to know you I want to know that I know Salvation true salvation is not a hope so my brother it's a no so and you might have came to this camp with a hope so but God can give you a no so you can live with a knowing faith that you know you have passed from Death unto life you say brother Matt does that mean I'm free from faults no it doesn't the battle just begins does that mean I'm free of struggles no it doesn't that just means the struggle really begins it only means now you have a helper you have a teacher you have a guide you have a redeemer you have a savior you have one who can deliver you from Temptation when you need to Deliverance he can make a way of Escape all you got to do is Surrender Your Heart To That Loving Lord Jesus he can change what you can't change he's not going to reform you he comes with transform transforming power that'll transform you from who you was to who God really made you to be I want wonder if you'd surrender to that God here tonight I pray Lord that the words that we've spoken tonight God I believe that they found their resting place they hit their Mark Lord and maybe even here tonight God maybe one life came in this building and it was on a course a road going down a highway maybe unbeknownst to them a Highway leading to burdens and scars and maybe even some unrecoverable but tonight Lord I wonder if they just say God would you rewrite my life would you rewrite let Mercy come and rewrite my story my story is not going to end I just want to tell you young person your story doesn't end with that failure your your story doesn't end there where the devil's told you it ended and you it's it's passed you it's in the past The Best Is Yet To Come for You young person the best is not behind you the best is right in front of you oh don't you believe that lie of that demon Spirit trying to tell you that the best is right in front of you young person if you'd only surrender to the plan that God's made for your life your failure is not final it's just the beginning of God right in your testimony and you might be a future preacher you might be a future Deacon you might be might be that you are the future family of the Living God God wants something he wants to express out of your life but first he just needs a heart that'll fully surrender to him musician just the piano player if she could come now just at this time maybe just one just for now just
