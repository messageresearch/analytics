long tonight and to do my best but um just want to um say it's been a real honor and privilege to be able to minister to you over the last couple of days it um certainly a an easy group of people to minister and to and i just thank the lord for you all and just want to encourage you to to keep pressing the battle keep pressing on keep supporting one another keep encouraging one another because uh i don't i think we all feel the same way it won't be too long and we'll me be meeting on the other side of the river yeah i had a just a testimony on behalf of someone else as a young a brother in our church um his name's boaz and he's gone over to the to canada [Music] and um he didn't know it but on his way over his grandmother fell sick and they um had to change their travel plans a little bit and he went straight to his grandmother who was in canada at that time and and um she was okay for a couple of days and then she kind of declined and and um she she gone she drifted off and and she come back and she said she said i've been to the river and she said i want to go back i said i've been to the river and she started to sing and she was she was hoping that her singing would take her back to the river i think well that's just so so beautiful that you know brother brown talks about that river and we want no trouble at the river and here god gives a testimony of this elderly lady she's been to the river and come back and she's got a testimony there is a river amen and was only a couple of days later she went back to that river and crossed over but what a testimony amen amen one day we'll all cross that river and we uh we look forward to it amen so just want to say god bless you and and um and you just let you know how much of encouragement you are to us just to see you serving the lord the way that you serve the lord and your dedication to him your dedication to one another is just so encouraging the lord has really blessed this this fellowship with the ministries the musicians the the the cooks and every er all of you he's just blessed the church with you so so um we we um we granted a a real privilege to be here and um we are going home blessed and and encouraged so we we thank the lord for that and that's how it works a lot of the time how you you come to be a blessing and you end up being blessed because it's all about your attitude amen you come to church to be a blessing you'll be blessed amen if you if you come to church to get a blessing well i don't know how that ends but but the idea is that you come to church to be a blessing amen and then you're blessed so we thank the lord amen amen thank you for all the items amen lord bless you um they're just they're special they help the meeting to be what it's meant to be amen let's stand to our feet tonight open our bibles to the book of romans romans chapter 12. the thought this evening is the revelation of the evening sacrifice just a really a continuation but just kind of bringing it down quickly as i can into the time in which we are living in we could literally preach a series of sermon on on this this thought here but the lord can develop his word within your own hearts and uh we'll just commit the service to the lord and and give him preeminence tonight romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service amen the book of matthew we want to be able to do what god asks us to do amen revelation uh sorry matthew 16 verses 24 and 25 then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it amen book of esther esther chapter four starting from verse 13 tonight we know this story here very well esther chapter 4 verse 13. then mordecai comma commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this why don't you just take your seats no doubt you're a little bit weary just keep your bibles open we'll continue to read here mordecai here is a is a type of the holy ghost and and esther here has been encouraged or stimulated we could say by by the holy ghost there was a message that was sent to to esther here and prompting esther just to think about where she's at just to think about the time in which she is living in think about how she got to the place that she's got and perhaps perhaps think a little bit deeper than what she was thinking about what is my purpose in the position that god has placed me in so then esther in verse 15 made them return mordecai this answer so we want to notice here that esther now was being was being inspired to give the holy ghost an answer esther was being inspired esther was queen right she wasn't to be positioned she already was in her right position but now there was something inspiring esther and this is what esther said go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor threa nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish something was inspiring esther something was causing esther to say what she was saying and to do what she was doing amen i believe that this end time bride is not self-inspired but she's holy ghost inspired she's inspired by the dove by the spirit of the dove is inspiring her because we understand that esther here is already married to the king amen and the the the thing that was inspiring esther was the spirit of her king it was the spirit of her husband that was inspiring her to think the way that she was thinking and to act the way she she was acting and i believe that this bride of christ also the spirit of god is inspiring her to think in a certain way and when we begin to think in a certain way we begin to act in a certain way if our thinking doesn't change our acting doesn't change but god's got to stimulate us god's got to cause us to to think in a different way in a deeper way perhaps than what we're thinking in relationship to our position with the king but she was not being inspired by another man's spirit she was being inspired by her husband's spirit amen that's what a wife is a wife is inspired by her husband's spirit right this bride of christ the queen of christ is inspired by her husband's spirit not another man's spirit amen if we're inspired by another man's spirit then we're going to fall amen but when we're inspired by the spirit of the holy ghost in our lives the spirit of our husband then we find that there's always a purpose behind it what is amazing about this in verse 17 it says so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him brother branham said god wants you to speak the word and he will perform it amen esther spoke the word and now the holy ghost went forward to perform what esther had spoken now it came to pass chapter 5 verse 1 on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house so it so it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to escort esther the golden sepka that was in his hand so esther drew nigh and touched the top of the septa then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to half of the kingdom amen man so we want to look at this in the light of the thought tonight the revelation of the evening sacrifice what you're going to find is the that the revelation of the hour meets the need for the hour the revelation of the hour will meet the need of the hour the revelation of another hour will not meet the need for this hour amen it must be the revelation of this hour that that that is the revelation of this hour will meet the need for this hour whatever need you have in your life the revelation of this hour will meet the need of this hour amen the revelation of the hour in 1st kings 18 the revelation of the evening sacrifice met the need of the hour the revelation of the evening sacrifice in john 1 as we looked at this morning he met that that revelation met the need for the hour amen and the revelation of this hour will meet the need of this hour the revelation of the evening sacrifice will meet the need of this hour esther said i will go unto the king i understand it's not according to the law but whether if i perish i perish amen the revelation of the hour will meet the need for the hour amen and there is a need in this hour amen and there's a there's always been a need in every hour but the particularly in this hour we want to receive from god the revelation for this hour so that it is able then to meet the need of this hour we could spend a lot of time and go through a a lot of examples here um just on that one thought but tonight we're looking at the the thought of the evening sacrifice for for this for this day because we understand that we're in a another gen another junction we are in a in a time where we are about to progress into the the wedding supper but it's going to require a revelation the thing that will get us there is a revelation but god holds revelation in his hand amen so when we realize the need for the hour and we call out to god lord we need a revelation that is going to that that is going to meet the need of the hour then it's like god lets go of that revelation and brings it down to us so that we can progress in our walk with the lord amen so this is what is going to change the course is revelation so as we saw this morning god is not going to or we can say god has not and he will not unequally yoke himself but god is joining himself with a part of himself amen he's joining himself with a part of himself therefore the bride is a lamb because he was a lamb she will be a lamb also with the same nature the the the same temperament allowing the the spirit of god to descend upon her like it descended upon him amen now god is working through his bride he is now working through the you god fulfilled the ministry that was required and could only be fulfilled in the realm and now god has a has he didn't finish his earthly ministry but that portion of his earthly ministry that he did not finish he he can now finish that portion of his earthly ministry through the bride amen this is just it's just so beautiful it's god working through his bride the prophet of god says he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen so what we see here is that the evening sacrifice of of um the evening sacrifice was a revelation to elijah because like john that the baptist brother branham was also a forerunner so the evening sacrifice to our elijah was a revelation because the revelation of the evening sacrifice must come through an elijah ministry first kings 18 elijah ministry john 1 elijah ministry and now we have a we have had an elijah ministry on this earth that reveals the evening time sacrifice again because a lamb is a is an animal it's a it's a animal of sacrifice it's a sacrificial animal okay so it's the revelation of the evening sacrifice must come through an elijah ministry and this is what we're reading here we're reading about the revelation of the evening sacrifice we're reading about the revelation of how or who who god is going to work through in this time as john the baptist said this is he who baptizeth with fire it it was it was john the baptist the elijah ministry revealing the evening time sacrifice and now it is we have had an elijah ministry that also reveals the evening time sacrifice present your bodies as a living sacrifice amen a living sacrifice why because we're sheep we're lambs and god wants to use us amen he that tries in safe is his his life shall lose it but he that that is willing to lay down his life shall find it amen it's a it's a sacrificial walk that god wants for that god has for his bride amen when god took the woman out of adam the wood woman was adam expressed and so is the bride of christ she is him expressed she is not different to him she is him in the office of wife it is god expressed as a wife to her husband now when god looked at elijah's sacrifice that he he had that he had prepared in first kings 18 god said the sacrifice is perfect amen it was a perfect sacrifice amen when god looked at the sacrifice in john 1 god said he is a perfect sacrifice amen now god has another evening time sacrifice so what is his what is his verdict of this sacrifice it's got to be the same it's got to be perfect amen and he has deemed her perfect yes amen why because she has been washed by the blood of the lamb amen she has been washed by the blood of the lamb and now god looks at her through that blood and god sees her as the perfect sacrifice your weaknesses are meant to be there your your insecurities are meant to be there god looks at her and he says she is perfect now i can come down and abode on her now i i can come down and dwell with her this is my perfect queen a god don't marry anything but perfection but god just happened to marry perfection amen because she is a part of him amen washed in the blood of the lamb so it's interesting now because now god is using another office god was using the groom for his earthly ministry and god accomplished through the groom what he sent to accomplish but now god is working through another office and that offers his wife that office is queen if the if the youth can remember god expresses himself through the office amen god doesn't express himself through a wife as a husband i trust you can just grasp that thought quickly enough god doesn't express himself through a wife as a husband god doesn't express himself through a husband as a wife but god works through the office so if god is in the wife god will express himself as the wife if god is in the husband god will express himself as the husband god was in his son and god expressed himself as a son but now now god is god is in the wife let me say that again so make sure we can connect this together a little bit better god was in the groom god was in the husband jesus christ and god expressed himself as the husband through the office but now god is in the wife right so how is god going to express himself he's going to express himself through the office because if god were to express himself through the wife as a husband that would be a perversion i mean the world is perverted i meant the wife is the husband and the husband is the wife the kids are the parents the parents are the kids it's the truth i'm not saying in every case but my kids work in child care i hear the stories i see it in the shopping centres it's the kids that control the parents not the parents who control the kids it's a perversion but god is not one who allows himself to be perverted god doesn't stoop that low he can't stoop that low because god can't fail amen he can't fail it's not possible for him to fail so god is expressed in in this day through the sacrifice through the revelation of the sacrifice which is wife it's god expressing himself as wife you'll notice when esther went into the king she put on her royal apparel she didn't put on his she put on her royal apparel all right why because god was working through esther amen and putting it into our time into where we're living now god was working through esther and god was going to express himself in the office that esther held and that office was queen so esther didn't esther didn't try and make her own way esther didn't try and make her own uh you know well i i don't need the king i'll i'll just go i'll just go the way that that i i'll just follow my heart i'll just do what the world does i'll do what the majority does no because that would be a perversion right because because christ in esther was going to express himself as queen and the queen comes subject to the king there's that headship again headship is nothing to fear headship is something you should cherish headship is protection okay it's something that you need to come to terms with it's actually something that you need to fall in love with is his headshield so god was expressing himself the through esther as esther it wasn't god expressing himself through esther and then like vashti well i don't need the king that grieved the king and it caused the king to put vashti away because she didn't understand headship she didn't understand that the value of it oh she did understand later but it was too late then amen but this bride won't fall this bride is not vashti this bride is esther this bride knows her position this bride knows who she is this bride is a revelation unto herself just the same as esther was a revelation unto herself vashti was not a revelation unto herself because if she was a revelation unto herself she would have done what the king asked her to do but because she thought well you know i'm i'm just as powerful as he is i'll do what i want to do he's having his meetings i'll have my own meanings but that's not this queen this queen is expressed as esther esther you you are you are the one that's casting the shadow of esther we're actually looking at your shadow because in order for there to be a shadow there must be someone someone that casts it so when we look at esther we're looking at your shadow amen because you are the reality of esther you are the reality of the shadow you are the one who is causing the shadow amen and because you are the one who's causing the shadow really we we our lives we should be able to fill in the blanks of the story of esther because the reality is much more clearer than a shadow there's more details in the reality than what there is the shadow amen so your life should be able to fill in the blanks of the shadow or the story of esther esther put on her royal apparel esther came to her headship esther was inspired esther was being led esther was being called esther was being challenged god had a purpose for all of this it's god expressing himself through his wife yes it was the spirit of esther's king that was causing esther to do what she was doing because the king was on the throne you know what the king was doing he was waiting for esther he was waiting for esther to push through the sound barrier oh esther what are you doing here no he was waiting for esther he was expecting her at any time perhaps he was dealing with business and and not knowing when exactly it was going to be but she knew that he knew at some particular time those curtains were going to come in and someone was going to come come in uninvited but really she was invited it was just a secret invitation that not everyone heard there was a deep calling and the deep was calling esther into himself amen yeah it's it's just so just so wonderful but the point here is that it was it was the spirit of her king in esther acting out the part of esther amen let's read this again those in the bride do only his will that's a challenge but the prophet here is ministering this through the revelation of esther today no one can make them do otherwise they have thus said the lord they stand still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word now let's just look at that they know it doesn't say i know that it has to be god in them it says they know they know they are a revelation unto themselves they know it's not me doing the works but it's god in me doing the works fulfilling his own word amen we'll come back to that but let's just go forward here jesus said believe us thou not that i am the father and the father in me the words that i speak i speak not of myself but the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works amen he doeth the works the son the groom had a revelation that it was his father in him that was doing the works well let's go back because the revelation now is that it's god in the bride doing the works they know as jesus knew they know as as the husband knew the wife knows that it's god in them doing the works it's a continuation or we could say it's an unfolding of the revelation of jesus christ because she is him it's the marriage of the lamb not the marriage of the lambs the revelation that he had of himself now she has of herself yeah it came through an elijah ministry yeah it did it has to according to god's word but now the many-membered body of christ they know once he knew i'm talking about the elijah once elijah knew the same as when elijah in first kings 18 put that put that sacrifice together once he knew before the fire even fell he knew that this was god's evening time sacrifice this was god's mind expressed this was the manifestation of god's mind once he knew and once elijah knew and no one else knew elijah held this mystery but but now it's time for us to be known as elijah knew us and this is how this is written they know that it has to be it has to be why because i understand my inability i understand my weaknesses amen i understand that i can achieve nothing i stand up here as a vessel that can achieve nothing it has to be god it's not this is not a question anymore it has to be god why because i can do nothing of myself i've come to terms with my weakness amen i'm not talking about sin okay i've come to terms with my weakness i've come to terms with my inabilities and therefore i know the things that happen around me are not me doing them it's god doing the works it has to be god in them doing the works and fulfilling his own word amen so it's it's very interesting here that jesus had this same revelation because it was god expressed through the song god fulfilling his own word through his son it was god in christ reconciling the world unto himself amen god in christ doing the works it's not me that doeth the works but it's my father that doeth the works amen jesus was a revelation to himself he was absolutely he was and we sometimes we struggle in our mind to think well why would jesus have to be a revelation to himself but he was a revelation to himself the groom was a revelation to himself the wife needs to be a revelation unto herself gone are the days when we are relying upon elijah holding the revelation now we are living in the time now where we are the revelation the thing that elijah said that we are that we are [Music] nothing more and nothing less amen i've run ahead of myself a little bit in john 1 god was masked behind the ram god was masked behind let's say it this way the ram of god ram is a lamb this is the male lamb and god fulfilled in him the ministry of the realm but now god has changed his mask and he has now masked behind the you of god now he's masked behind the female lamb now his mass once he was masked behind the ram once he was masked behind the husband but now he's taken on a mask and that mask is the mask of a wife his wife yes not just our wife his wife the person behind the mask controls what the mask does i thought about making a mask it's not the mask expressing itself but it's the person behind the mask expressing himself as the character of the mask amen it's not the mask expressing himself itself but it's the person behind the mask and the person behind the mask expresses himself or acts out the role that the mask is amen he was masked behind the ram and when god was hidden behind the the mask of the ram he acted out the role of the ram god acted out the role of the ram the the mask could not express itself the mask could do nothing of itself you can lay the mask down on the uh if you had a mask you could lay it on the floor and say stand up it wouldn't do nothing it couldn't do nothing of itself it's a lot like a sheep it can't do nothing of itself if it needs to do anything it needs to be put in the hands of the cat of the person whose mask it is and the son of god the realm of god was god's mask for that period of time but we're not living in that period of time even though we rejoice about the things that god achieved through that mask because we he could not dwell behind the mask of his wife until he had fulfilled the things that were necessary in the role of the ram so this is why we rejoice this is why we have communion this is why we have foot washing this is why we sing about the blood this is why we sing about calvary this is why we sing about redemption it's all it because without that we couldn't have this but because he has fulfilled all the ministry that he was meant to finish he's laid down the mask of the ram and he's picked up another mask and this mask just happens to be the mask of his wife and now he has veiled behind his wife and now he is fulfilling his own word he is fulfilling he is acting out the role of a wife amen we are the mask and we are sheep amen and we can do nothing of ourself it's christ in you the hope of glory it's christ in you veiled behind the veil failed behind the wife mask god acting his role god acting as a wife because he's changed his mask i just love that i just i just i just love that so much god laid down the mask of his son and he stepped into another mask god's always masked amen and that mask in his idea was when he laid down the mask of his son that there was another mask that he was about to step behind it's the same god that was veiled behind the groom is the same god that is now veiled behind the mask of his wife the same same god not a different god but now it's god acting out the role of his wife i'm just going all over the place tonight but this is why those in the bride do only his will you can't do this i'm sorry but you can't do this it's not possible for you to only do his will amen but when you surrender when you become as a sheep when you surrender yourself to god it's no longer you trying to fulfill or trying to do his will now when you completely surrender god now it's him behind you fulfilling his own word and that's why the bride do only his will is because it's not the bride acting out her part but it is god behind the bride acting out her part it's magnificent the prophet of god says in trying to do god a service without it being his will he says i was going to speak this morning on satan's eden many of you's got the tape of it satan's eden he has made another garden of eden six thousand years has taken him to make it just like god did his at the beginning god made his eden and satan corrupted it now satan's made his own eden and god's going to destroy it that's right and put his own something said to me he's talking about the picture of the cloud turn it right i thought i think i'm looking at it right said turn it right see i thought maybe the voice means turn it to the right and when i did you see what it is hoffman's head of christ at 33 here look in here see this black beard his face his eyes his nose everything else see the part of his hair here coming down and he's wigged with the white angel wig to show that the message of him being god is the truth he is the supreme judge of the universe supreme judge of heaven and earth he is god and nothing else but god he is god expressed in human form called the son of god which the son was the mask god behind a mask the eternal judge the the the supreme judge of heaven and of earth was veiled behind the mask of his son and that son is our groom so we can we we can say amen we can say that the god was veiled behind my groom amen just the same as what esther could say ested by the revelation of who her king was to say god that's that's god veiled in flesh amen the son was the mask god was masked as a son with that mask on that's the part he played but that is not the mask today his mask today is wife the point that i'm majoring on here is whatever mask god chooses to mask himself behind that is also the part that he plays behind the mask if you don't go home with anything else go home with that yes whatever mask god decides to mask himself behind that's the role he plays it's not us fulfilling his word it's god in us fulfilling his own word if let me go back this is a with with without revelation we'll we'll be condemned here those in the bride only do his will oh but what we want is the revelation of jesus christ for this hour because the revelation of jesus christ for this hour meets the need for this hour amen so the revelation of jesus christ a part of the revelation of jesus christ is to identify the mask because if you can't identify the mask then how do you know what party's planned if you went to a play and you didn't know who the characters were and there were all these people on the stage playing their part but you didn't know who the character was what's the point of going to the play so you've got to know who the character is so that you understand the purpose behind the character you've got to understand the mask and then you'll understand what the purpose of the person behind the mask is going to fulfill those in the bride do only his will the reason is is is is because it's not the bride doing his will it's god in the bride doing his own will it's god in the bride fulfilling his own word it's not the bride fulfilling the word it's the groom it's the it's god in the bride fulfilling his own word it was god in moses it was god in david it was god in noah it was god in sarah it was god in abraham it was god in jesus it was god in you fulfilling his own purpose no wonder she can rest no wonder the bride can rest no wonder the mask can rest because it's not her fulfilling fulfilling anything she just needs to rest and allow god to do his part and i i believe well in in my own life this is where i believe my experience with the lord is coming to a greater level where i can just relax i can just rest like i can just surrender myself to him and say lord however you want to use me tonight you just use me tonight is for your glory it's not up to me to come out here and put on a show no i'm the mask i need someone behind me i need someone in me so that this mask can fulfill what it's meant to fulfill so that it can fulfill its purpose as the mask as the mask the mask has a purpose as a mask god is is expressing himself as a wife we might jump around a bit here and there but that's okay yeah amen now in my home i'm three different people in my home my wife has claims on me as husband my daughter out there she doesn't have any claims on me as husband i am her father and my little grandson there i'm grandfather to him so he has no right to call me father i'm not his father my son is his father i am his grandfather but i'm still the same man this kind of gets interesting because there's probably people here who are the gentlemen here who are their sons and their fathers and their grandfathers so now we can bring this right down to another level because as a husband to my wife god is expressing himself as a husband to through through this vessel also the same as what god is expressing himself through my wife to me you understand when when i see my wife giving me the respect that the bible says that she ought to give me it's christ in her when my wife experiences the love that god said that that i ought to love her with it's what she's experiencing is the love of christ in me because it's christ in me expressing himself through this office i just hold the office it's the same with a daughter if a a a daughter when a daughter shows her parents the respect that god says she ought to what they're experiencing is christ in her without christ in her there won't be that respect but when christ is in her christ will express himself through my daughter he she will respect my wife she will respect me it's and what am i experiencing i'm experiencing christ christ is expressing himself through that office it's it's just so glorious it's just so so wonderful it's it's life-changing and god does what he does he just changes himself to to become to that generation to make known himself to that people and that's what we're finding out tonight in what way is god supposed to make himself known to this people and in this time he changes his mask he changes his act he doesn't change his disposition he doesn't change his nature he just changes his mask from one to another he does it to reveal himself he does it to reveal himself god wants to be known god wants you to see him and the way that god is is known or the way that god has decided to express himself is through humanity he does it to reveal himself more plain to the people that they might know who he is and what he is when the prophet of god stood on the platform and you understand that the story behind the story that when melchizedek came to abraham he discerned the thoughts and intents of sarah's heart when sarah was in the tent behind him so when the prophet of god turns his back to the congregation and he says there's someone on the fourth right back and da da da da da got this problem and this problem and this problem what's what's god doing who was that because we can take that story back to the bible and say that was melchizedek amen so now when uh when when when a son shows respect to the father lord i don't i don't do my will i do your will when a son shows respect to the father here on earth we can take that back to the word and say i know who that is i know who that is that's christ in that son when a husband loves his wife as christ loved the church we can take that experience we can take what we are looking at as me as an onlooker i can take what i am seeing a man loving his cr loving his wife as christ loved the church and i can look at that and i can take that back to the bible and i can prove who that is by the word it's the same christ who laid down his life for his wife 2000 year ago is now here doing things for his wife that she could not do for herself you see it's not just all about what the prophet did it's christ in you it was christ in the prophet but now it's christ in you amen and why is it christ in you because he wants to reveal himself not just in a prophet but he wants to reveal himself in you in your office fulfilling the role that you have fulfilling your office god fulfilling your office god as husband we could probably go a little bit overboard here but let me do it okay god is my wife's husband when i become fully surrendered fully dedicated christ in me becomes my wife's husband if we can see this we will see many things there's a principle here if we can grasp this principle we can apply it to every office son daughter husband wife grandfather grandmother dad mother etc etc there's a principle behind here that god wants us to catch and that is that god wants to reveal himself in your office amen and the way that he can the only way that he can do that is if we understand who we are if we understand we are the mask and we are the mask that god has chosen to avail himself behind and express himself through in this mask amen i don't even know how far i got there to reveal more plane to the people that they might know who he is and what he is his whole purpose is to be known and he could have done this in many different ways but he chose to work through humanity he chose to redeem humanity through humanity once upon a time god was masked behind a mask but in this day god is masked behind masks god is masked behind masks god is playing many parts of his play at the same time one time he was marks behind one mask now he has a many membered body in whom he is masked behind and he is playing every part in his play amen it's not our play it's his play amen is god mast behind you it's god mass behind the mum it's god masked behind the dad it's god mass behind the sun it's god mass behind the daughter it's god masked it's god masked it's god must it's not us playing the part it's him playing the part amen because let's face it we we can't play our part we can't play the part of the mask the character of the mask we are just the mask it takes the owner of the mask to come on the scene the masks that he purchased is the masks that he's going to play behind he purchased his bride and he's going to play behind every member of his body god must god mask behind the musicians god mass behind the song leader god mass behind ministry amen a ministry is an office it doesn't matter which one of the five-fold ministries it is it's an office but it's it's the the person that god has placed that gift within he's the mask it's god who comes in and operates the gift that he's placed within the mask amen so it's got veiled behind ministries it's got veiled behind deacons etc etc etc the weakness is in the mask which is humanity the mask is humanity and what we need to do is accept our weaknesses instead of trying to remove them because god made me the way he's made me and it's like really cosmetics god made us the way he made us but today people don't like the way that they're made so they apply cosmetics to change the way that god made them i guess we have pink lips i don't know just as an example but people aren't happy with that people want red lips green lips blue lips yellow lips they're not happy they're not happy with the natural color of their fingernails they want different colors and sometimes we're the same in our spiritual walk we try and change ourselves thinking that would be more usable thinking that we'd be more attractive perhaps we're to get invited overseas to preach in other people's churches more often if if i could just remove this weakness or just remove i'm not talking about sin please understand me okay i'm just talking about the way that god made us god made us as the weaker vessel god made us as sheep god god tells us that we're sheep we just need to accept that we're sheep the very thing that we're trying to remove we need to accept that this is how god made me and god made me different to you but god made me the way he's made me and through the way that he's made me he's going to receive glory so the thing that we try and remove we really need to accept paul prayed three times for the thorn in the flesh to be removed but god said no at least paul had the understanding to ask god to remove it sometimes we take it upon ourself we don't even ask god we go and we get on youtube and we we look at all these motivational videos and you come away from those motivational videos feeling like you could rip a dozen lines to pieces and then half an hour later you're back right where you started trying to make yourself something that you're not god made you weak for a reason god made you with the inabilities for a reason god made moses with that speech impediment for a reason god made david as the smallest of his family the weakest of his family for a reason but instead we try and pump ourselves up you know we go to the spiritual gym and you know pumping pumping messages you know i'm just trying to make myself big you know i i ought to be bigger than what i am yeah let god do for you what he wants to do for you god made you that way god made you weak yes what the world calls strong god calls weak what the world calls weak god calls strong god can use a strong man because in god's economy a strong man is a weak man david was weak but david was god's chosen naturally saw samuel uh sorry jesse offered his biggest son first surely this is the one that god's gonna use look at the size of him no no no no is there another one oh yeah but you know we didn't even consider him in there in the in in god's economy well god did god did go and get him and bring him here and the lord says this is him this is the one that the weakest of the bunch the weakest of who was available god chose to use the weaker that we can get the more god can use us the more we recognize that we are just a sheep we're not aligned with just a sheep a sheep can't find its way home a sheep can't lead herself she can't defend herself a sheep is the most insecure human that there is on earth a sheep is dependent upon god brother branham said god never god never ordained man to shift for himself but he made man to be totally reliant upon god the thing that we run from the thing that we try and remove the thing that we say well god can't use me because of this or god could use me better if i didn't have if i wasn't this week is the very thing that we need to accept like god told paul paul my grace is sufficient for thee amen my grace is sufficient for thee and his grace is sufficient for you it's god's desire we don't need to worry we don't need to say well if only i could get rid of this insecurity who said you had to you can become secure through your union this is why you know brother and tells us how we can grieve the holy ghost and the holy ghost will flutter off onto a branch you don't lose your seal but you can backslide you know the the moment the moment the holy ghost flooded off we'll we'll try and fend for ourself we'll try and shift for ourselves and all we do is become worse and worse and worse and worse until we realize hey what what what am i doing what what am i doing trying to find my way home what am i doing trying to try trying to act out the role of the mask i'm the mask we need to understand ourselves we need to understand how god designed us this is why the revelation of jesus christ to me it's it's a lot of the time it's distorted because the revelation of jesus christ is both in weakness and in strength it's the lamb and the dove it's a two-fold revelation of god the husband and the wife the wife is the weaker vessel the husband is her protection we understand who we are we understand our weaknesses we understand that we are the weaker vessel in this relationship god was masked behind his son but now through an elijah ministry god has been revealed behind the minute behind his bride mast behind his bride god is now acting out the role of wife i love that god is now acting out the role of wife behind the mask of his wife god in you redeeming humanity through you god in you redeeming humanity through you i can give you that on a quote mary the mother of jesus in the city of nazareth as this is as we close tonight the meanest city there was in the land but out of there god chose a little lady to give birth to his son an incubator a womb that he had to had a baby had to be born by he took such a person to do it god works through human beings to redeem human beings what what what did god have to take moses out on the back side of the desert for so that he could realize he was human why because god chose before the foundation of the world to redeem human beings through human beings it's not human beings redeeming human beings it's god working through human beings redeeming human beings the human being is the mask he can take you work through you to redeem humanity if you completely dedicate everything you are if you'll completely dedicate everything you are are you a revelation to yourself because you can only dedicate to him what you know yourself to be amen and when you are a revelation unto yourself then you can dedicate everything you are your your weaknesses well let me ask you what are you you are the mask that god has chosen to redeem humanity through you do you realize tonight god is here redeeming humanity through humanity this is why especially sorry ministry for the ministers it is very important that they understand who they are so that it allows god to work through them because they can dedicate who the everything they are when they know who they are and i am just the mask i am the mask in which god hath chosen to work through you are the mask that god has chosen to work through it's not up to the mask to redeem to redeem humanity but it's up to god to redeem humanity it's up to god in humanity to redeem humanity because when he redeems humanity it's like the field with the treasure when he bought the field he got the treasure when he bought your when he bought you he got the treasure because within you there was a predestinated seed so he paid the price for you and in paying the price for you he got the treasure so he's redeeming humanity to redeem back unto himself the part of you that is a part of him this is this is god's choice god god works through human beings to redeem human beings god worked through his son to redeem human beings god worked through his son god god it was it was god behind the sun who who caused the sun to lay himself down on the cross amen it was god behind the sun that caused the sun to lay himself down on the cross it's god in you that causes you to deny yourself take up your cross and follow him it's christ in you that causes you to do that amen if you completely dedicate everything that you are if you're a young woman dedicate your morals you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all you are and let christ work through that what a glorious thing got some rivers to cross got some bridges to go over got the got the briar patches got the thickets got you got the woods you got the dark places you got the high hills you got the high climbs what are you doing someday you'll have to stand and look back see where you came from and you're going to be judged by the course you take put your all your mind and your thoughts on that north star the center of god and don't move from it stay right with it it will bring you straight like like it did the magi right straight to christ god is masked in this building we're not looking for a god that is masked he's here he is a revelation to us amen he is what causes the mask to do what it does the actions of the mask if christ is in the mask are the actions of christ if christ is not in the mask then the actions of the mask are the actions of the mask but if christ is in you then the actions of the mask are the actions of christ this is why christ today is identifiable by his actions behind the mask we know that it's god doing the works because the works that are being done are out of our reach we know it's not us because we know we can't do it we know it's him because we know that we can't do what he is ordained to do despite our best efforts sarah put her own interpretation to god's promise but it didn't work out the way she thought it would because her interpretation was different to god's to god's word so we want to allow god to use us as masks as masks lord use me in a way that would bring glory unto yourself i hope you just don't see christ behind your pastor i hope you see him behind your pastor but i hope you just don't see christ behind your pastor because then you're in no better place than people who just see christ behind william brown but christ was it wasn't his idea to be masked behind one person it was his idea to be masked behind his many membered body his many-membered bride amen his wife so we thank god for this opportunity amen to know who we are and to be able to recognize him she knows it's not her well if it's not her who is it it's got to be someone yeah if if there's there's there's works happening i said it this morning are we being led are we are we going deeper into the word well who led us how did we get there leadership that what i just spoke of is supernatural that is supernatural for you to go deeper into god's word is a supernatural event in your life and the purpose of the supernatural is so that the supernatural one can be identified because he wants to reveal himself he wants to be known so when we get to the place where i i i know it's not me well praise god that's exactly where he wants you to get it's not me raising my kids it is sometimes when i don't get myself out of the way but it's christ how do these things happen why do these things happen why do we see the works of god around us because god wants to identify himself as being present not not looking back to experiences of the sixties but looking back looking present tense that it must be god here in my soul because i feel the poor i i see things happening and man cannot do this i've heard lots of testimonies from the congregation here how how that people will say it just has to be god hallelujah that's exactly what god wants you identify it has to be god it can't be anyone else that this has happened and this has happened this i didn't even know how it happened i don't even know when it happened all i know is something has happened god has done something why because god wants to be identified among you personally god wants you to know him personally not of someone else's experience god is in your midst absolutely he is god is here amen he is here in the form of the holy ghost veiled behind his bride working behind his bride doing the impossible behind the bride doing something and she just stands in awe she just stands in amazement how are these things happening i tried to do that for 10 years and he does it in 30 seconds how is this happening well you were never meant to do it sarah that's god's job let god be god he doesn't need your help now let me just act this bit out no let him act just that bit out amen god is in your midst here in this fellowship in the little town of taranaki god is in taranaki amen because the idea of the revelation of the evening lights of the evening sacrifice is lord god first kings 18 lord reveal yourself as being the god in israel and now we're in a time where the purpose of god revealing himself is not to reveal himself in a form of a day gone by behind a mask of a day gone by even though we cherish those times we're encouraged by those times we're encouraged by the story of david and joshua and caleb and moses and noah and sarah and hannah et cetera et cetera but but what we have today is god mask behind present tense joshua's present tense rebecca's present tense sarah's god is in our midst and it's in the midst of god here now that we are to draw courage from if god if the government takes our bible it don't matter it just don't matter because the god of this bible is in the bride the god of this bible is now masked in a bride they can take the they can take the bible they can take the sermons they can take the tapes they can take the computers they can shut down websites it's not going to make any difference because the god of the message is the god in the bride they can imprison you they can abuse you they can they can whip you they can flog you they can do whatever they want to do but it ain't going to remove god behind his bride because god will be expressed like joseph was expressed when joseph went into the pit it was god in joseph when joseph was falsely accused he was god in joseph when joseph went to prison it was god in prison yeah it was god in prison it was god in the pit it was god who was falsely accused god expressed why because it wasn't joseph joseph was the mask it was god behind the mask it doesn't matter what god doesn't matter what this government does they can't control god they couldn't control the disciples the disciples were happy that they got flogged for the cause of god they were happy big whoop did he do now don't you go and preach any more next day jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever who are these guys it was god in the disciples amen it wasn't the disciples peter was a coward before christ came in but when christ came into into peter now it was christ being expressed through peter christ being expressed through you as an individual amen the the god you can't put god in a box people have tried many many times you can't you can't put god in a prison and expect him to stay there if it's not his plan to stay there it just won't work because you can't put god behind bars and god will go god will go with the mask through the bars god will take his mask and move outside of the prison and the prison doors not even be open why because it's god the eternal one and this is where the world is coming to the world is coming to a place where they think they control god they think they are god but i'm sorry you're wrong even if you want to chop my head off chop it off but there's come in a day where this body that you cut into pieces will rise again you might think you've defeated god at this time but there's come in a time where you're going to realize you're wrong because god cannot be defeated god masked behind you god must god fulfilling your role god working through your office girlfriend boyfriend husband wife whatever it is god god is acting out that role if christ is in you and when christ is in you what do we see we see christ as a son christ as a daughter christ as a husband christ as a wife god in the wife doesn't make the wife a husband but it's christ in me yes it's christ in you christ in you fulfilling your role acting out in the office that you are in as wife and that's why the story of esther is so significant because it was god in esther that pushed through that veil she didn't come with a heart now listen here old king oh you better listen to me for a moment no she came in humbly she came in showing him respect why because it was christ in esther that that that met king of hazarus out on the throne and it's going to be christ in us that causes us to walk through into those those places through that veil and into a into a place where no one else can go this place is reserved for the bride amen so we we are a privileged people i say lord god just let let me know continue to reveal to me who i am so that i can completely dedicate everything that i am reveal to me who i am clearly lord so that i can dedicate everything that i am amen let's stand to our feet amen let's just offer a word of prayer i'll ask brother elroy to come and close the service our loving and gracious heavenly father oh lord god what a what a rest it is what a rest we can enter into lord when we understand heavenly father that you are not calling us lord god to fulfill your word but lord god you will fulfill your own word through us oh heavenly father lord god we we take up our cross we deny ourselves we offer ourselves to you this evening lord god is a living sacrifice lord we humbly approach you lord as esther approached her king lord with our needs recognizing heavenly father that we cannot fulfill our own needs but lord god you are the fulfiller of all our deeds you are the healer of all our diseases lord you are our redeemer and lord god we just approach you we approach your your throne of grace lord we approach it boldly lord we approach it humbly lord through the revelation of who we are at this time lord god you can meet the need of the hour lord you can meet our needs here this morning this evening lord no matter what they are perhaps lord god we've been trying to fulfill our own needs lord god perhaps tonight lord jesus you've just spoken to some people's hearts and lord god you've you've said unto them lord god i am the fulfiller of your needs i am your provider i am the one who can give you what you have need of i am the one who can fulfill your heart's desire lord god we approach you now in in the through the humility of the revelation that you've given us lord god we ask you now lord please fulfill our desires lord perhaps haman is on our heels but lord god we cannot put haman under our feet lord god you will put haman under our feet and heavenly father we pray lord god for each and every person that's here in these services this this evening lord that you would be expressed through each and every one lord there is not an individual here that you don't wish to be expressed through from the youngest to the oldest or god your desire is to be the preeminent one within that individual and lord god our desire is for you to be the preeminent one in me lord is i hold many offices lord god there's not one office that i hold that i don't wish you to be expressed through so lord god we we dedicate all that we are to you we surrender everything that we are to you every office that we hold whether it be in church or whether it be at work or whether it be family life lord we dedicate all that we are to you lord god that you might use us through those different offices to redeem your predestinated lord god if our revelation lord is not where it needs to be then lord we come to you and lord we come to you and we ask heavenly father lord take us deeper take us lord into the to the holiest of holies take us into the the deep things of your word lord god that we might know lord who we are and be able to dedicate who we are to you lord god that is our desire heavenly father the days of of trying to be something to gone lord your scripture says when the son of man be lifted up i will draw all men unto me lord god it is you that we desire to lift up and lord god we just surrender ourselves dedicate everything that we know of ourselves to you for your glory that you might lord god have the opportunity tonight tomorrow through our life here on this earth to express yourself freely through these masks that you have purchased with your blood lord we just commit this church into your hands lord continue lord to lead it continue lord to stimulate the ministers continue lord to open your word heavenly father to each and every one of them lord may they become lord this dedicated heavenly father to your cause may the congregation lord just become dedicated to this portion of the body of christ heavenly father lord may it be that their purpose for living lord is just to come into your house and call upon your name and worship you lord we ask these very special things in your precious name we want to thank you

chains lord god you are here and you are loosing the chains lord from those that have been bound for many years lord god continue lord to do this lord that that we might testify of your presence in this little church here in taranaki we thank you for your grace and your forgiveness lord and your love to us and your mercy that is new every day in jesus christ's name amen amen amen the lord bless you thank you brother hillary amen praise the lord it was good to be here amen i say there's no way else where i wanted to be you know just thank god for what he did for us this weekend um you know we didn't have everyone at the altar and so forth and nothing wrong with it i'm not saying anything against that but but i really believe god dealt with us in a supernatural way i mean i really believe that god was was working in a in an amazing supernatural way this weekend and i also stand stand so blessed to see how the things that our brother minister just fit handing glove with a direction that we've been focusing on over the last while and and and i just you know only god can do that and and i just i just can want to say thank you god thank you lord for this weekend and you know this this i i loved how brother brought it so personal you know you can speak about the role of you know you refer to wife and mother and husband and different ones you can speak of that but then there's a generalization because there's many wives and there's many mothers and so forth but then he brought her to the individual each one of us but then he took it a step further and he said each one of us have various roles in various places you know you can be a musician and a mother and a you know a daughter and a and a sister and a friend and whatever it is many roles that we have and in each role god wants to reflect himself i love that i love that i will really treasure that amen can we sing you ask me why i'm happy sorry i didn't don't know the number 60 okay praise the lord you ask me why i'm happy and i [Music] i say oh some of you don't look very happy hey man some of you look very sad right i want to say there's something to be happy about i mean you ask me why i'm happy [Music] is is i am oh jesus darknesses amen do you know that song i know it was the blood you might know different to me so maybe listen to how i sing it and then we sing it again right i know it was the blood i know it was the blood i know it was the blood for me one day when i was lost he died upon the cross i know it was the blood for me i know it was the blood i know it one day when i was lost he died
