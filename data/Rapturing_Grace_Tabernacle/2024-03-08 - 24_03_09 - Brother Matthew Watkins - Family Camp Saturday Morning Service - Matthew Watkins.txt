with fears worries whatever it is amen just ask the Lord to give you Grace to open your heart am mean each one of us need it and and it's my prayer this morning that God will let us see beyond the people around us and beyond our own past and our history and our ideas that the Lord will just speak to us to our souls and change lives amen I wonder if you would be seated just for a moment I don't want to take up a lot of time um but I want to say now for those of you joined us for the first time this morning welcome to to Family Camp 2024 and and uh trust that the Lord will continue to bless us we've already had a wonderful time last night and I'm really thankful that the Lord has allowed us to see a little bit of a glimpse in the heart of brother Matt and uh to to uh allow him to make himself a little vulnerable and testify um of how the Lord had to show him to look Beyond himself and so forth um so really really blessed by that thank you very much for everyone's lovely attitudes and help and so on um and uh I want to say may the Lord bless each one of you but may the Lord also continue to bless our fellowship and bless our togetherness and may the Lord's presence be here and may the Lord make each one feel really welcome amen you know it's so easy for us depending on how we are wired um you know I know some people are wired that the bigger the crowd the lonelier they get um and some people are just like that um I'm very happy to be in the crowd but I like to sit somewhere and keep my mouth shut and let everyone else talk and listen that's just how I'm wired and we're all different but I know for some people you know coming into a group environment like this is a little bit of a challenge and I want to say may the Lord work beyond that complex I mean may the Lord make it just um safe enough for each one of us just to to appreciate the fellowship and and let the Lord be welcome and I want to say may may the Lord get through your walls and my walls amen praise the Lord I's say thank you to all those lovely young Oliver talents that was on display praise the Lord that was very special really enjoyed that um also you would have seen on the program that on Monday we have um Monday morning there's not a service a normal service we have a a singing and testimony service so um you know um Simon says that I think most Services um we're going to have at least two song items which is wonderful praise the Lord Lord for that would love that to happen also in church on normal services or just hint hint um but also it would be lovely for even if you've done song song items throughout the weekend if you can do another one on Monday that would be even even extra special though right praise the Lord um so welcome to Camp trust that that we come with Open Hearts to receive what the Lord has for us um we also have a very special day today um God willing after service Joshua SAR will be will be baptized so we thank the Lord for that um so again I'll just kind of warn you what's going to happen so as the song service starts Josh Joshua and I will slip out and go get the baptismal clothes on and as soon as the service stops here please make your way down to the to the dam to the lake and uh we'll we'll do do the baptismal the so really exciting amen so I don't don't want to take any any extra time um I'm going to call Brother Matt up soon

from yourself right we we heard on Wednesday night to entertain the Lord um let's entertain the Lord and he'll take care of the rest I mean focus on him don't focus on I am this and I am that that and I'm battling with this or that or people around me or no one loves me or whatever it is I mean Focus away from those things and focus on the Lord and I and I believe with all my heart that he will touch you amen let's stand together and take our needs to the Lord first first and then we'll sing a song If you have a need on your heart this morning you can express it to the Lord now as we pray

and I just want to um Express how much how grateful I am to brother Al for having us and um I've only got to know him just over the he was there with us in Buford and got a little bit of fellowship and then but my goodness just a couple days uh just felt like I've known him my whole life and so I just appreciate his spirit and uh him and his his family got to be with him uh in their home and theyve just made me feel so welcome and um I just want to um be a be a vessel amen that can be used for you now I don't know you I don't uh I don't know any of you that I that I you know just very except for just you know very little and you don't know me and that's a good thing sometimes I could just come in here un knowing of brother Al didn't sit me down and give me some kind of Intel and all the problems in the church and everything that's going on and I know you got problems uh you're a group of people so whenever there's a group of people there's problems There's issues there's circumstances and challenges um but I believe that God is more than enough amen his word is more than enough for us and so I just want to to uh relax this morning that'll be all the music thank you amen God bless you I want to say how much we appreciated just the worship we got to be in just for the little bit um all of the sound Texs and the musicians and all of those that made this Camp possible may God bless you richly and um I pray God pour out something special for you this morning and this weekend God would be uh very close and very real to you amen Judges chapter 13 if you have your Bible we just want to go straight to the word this morning amen Judges chapter 13 and I just want to um just obeying the Lord this morning and I'll uh tell you straight honestly and um that I struggled just with the the Lord on what direction he'd have me go for this weekend and you know you could you could go so many directions and you're pulled naturally you know in so many ways and I just uh with the Lord just uh consulted with the Lord so much and ask God just to give us a just perfect leadership and so I'm going a way that I probably wasn't expecting to go and uh in any way uh at all and sometimes I just have learned just to follow the lord and uh don't try to figure it out don't try to make sense of of it um you know why why I would go a certain direction but I believe the Lord knows amen and I I've I've I've watched that already on this trip how much he's in control and I just believe he has something very special for us amen this this weekend I just want to minister to you today and I really I don't uh have necessarily a theme that I would go with for this weekend as I thought I was going to I had a theme I had a theme but God had other plans and so it just seems the way the the Lord has led me uh last night early this morning up just praying and waited on the Lord and it just seems like I I just don't really have a a theme maybe where every service will just you know tie into the next one uh in that way but you know uh maybe we have you know different portions of a meal you have you know a seven course meal and not everything ties together and so we just want to begin with this portion this morning and I'm going to just try to try my best to be studious brother houry about the time it's 10:39 now so 10:40 and I'll try to be done um as soon as possible when the Lord is done we'll be done amen I'm going to minister you today and I'm just going to uh title this the cost of a choice the cost of a choice verse two of Judges chapter 13 13 and there was a certain man of Zora of the family of the danites whose name was monoa and his wife was Barren and bore not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God notice from the womb so not at the moment that he recognizes the call of God in his life not at the moment he comes to you know per se an alter as we would say and you know and surrenders and submits his life but actually the call that God was going to place upon him was going to be before he even was born that's right and it says from the womb he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines then the woman came and told her husband and said a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible that word means awesome but I asked him not whence he was neither told me his name but he said unto me behold and she repeats these words here cons that behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death I want you to notice this here this morning how far the plan of God over a life spans it goes from before you're born until you breathe your last breath breath and so God was saying knowing the end from the beginning Samson's going to go a lot of places God didn't tell him to go Samson's life is going to be something that God never intended for it to be but yet the promise or the call that God put on his life never left him let's read a little bit further here then Theo entreated and said oh Lord oh my Lord let the man of God which thou did s come again un us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born God hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of God came again unto the woman and she sat in the field but manoah manoah her husband was not with her and the woman made haste and ran and showed her husband and said unto him behold the manath appeared unto me that came unto me the other day manoah Rose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him thou the man that speaketh unto the woman and he said I am and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him the angel of the Lord said unto manoah of all that I said unto the woman let her beware so he repeats this commission again unto her and in verse 15 and manoah said unto the angel of the Lord I pray thee let us detain thee until we shall have made ready kid for thee Lord Jesus father we just now Lord bow in your presence God I'm in great need of you this morning Lord father I stand Here Lord as just an empty vessel Lord waiting to be filled I pray God that each one would have that testimony this morning Lord we empty out our self now we raise up our hand Lord as just a sign of surrender this morning and Lord we just want to say empty up us father oh the spirit of God ever waiteth an empty vessel Lord and I believe Lord that you can fill us Lord father with all of your self this morning from our head to our toes I pray God that you would instruct us now Lord I pray may your spirit is the word says it's a teacher it's a tutor Lord may it come and teach Lord father as we sit at your feet Lord we desire to listen we pray that you would speak Now Grant it Lord to each person this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated this morning life is such an amazing uh as such an amazing thing that you know the aspects of life that uh so intricate in and in so many phases you know all the way from the time that you're born and you you you're raised in a home and and you're you're LED brother Brandon would take it in leadership and would say that you're LED you know in one day you're led by your mother and then you change from that dispensation to your father and then you change maybe to your employer and and and and your boss and maybe someone that's over you and then he he asked the question but who's leading you now and I think it's an amazing thing that life is tight that way it's very much uh even biblically we we understand Life as a journey we can see this through Abraham as Abraham journeyed and he left his father and and he left everything that he ever knew left a land and a home and houses and and and he and the Bible said he he left it all he sojourned he was seeking he was looking he was journeying and his journey starts there in the you know when when he leaves everything that he ever known and then God continues to move in his life and and then he asks him to leave and separate himself from his father and Abraham passes that test and he and he comes to many different Crossroads in his life and many different intersections or Junctions that he goes through and and and and he comes to the place in his life where now he's he's he's he's came up to this point and God tells him to separate himself now again from his brother lot and I think it's so incredible because as you study this man Abraham's life what you'll find is it's you can relate so much uh to it in your own journey in your own life that life is all about a journey that we're on our way to somewhere that we're on a line that we're on a path that we're not just going around in circles but God has a purpose for our life God has a plan he has a direction and in fact over every life God anoints that life with a certain specific purpose and an anointing is is we could say is not you know it's the word sha if you ever look up that word anointing it's so amazing how different it is from what we get when we think of the word anointing and we think of an anointing as some filling or some you know some kind of thing that we fill over our flesh and it can be that the anointing of God you can say I feel his anointing I could say that as a minister preaching the gospel Jesus would say the anointing of the Lord the spirit of God is upon me and so but you notice that that word sha and anointing actually it just simply means to smear or to rub with oil in other words what it saying is is that the anointing is the transfer it's the transaction it's it's God taking something that he has a burden you could say and God would make a transaction he would transfer that burden onto a vessel and then when that anointing would come upon that vessel that would be the purpose that God had called that vessel to for the purpose he was born into the Earth listen friends I just want to say this you're not random you're not just randomly here this morning in fact I'll go further it wasn't an accident that you were not born in the days of Jesus it's not an accident that you weren't born in the days of Martin Luther or John Wesley but you were not born in the days when brother Brandon was here there there was a generation that served that purpose there was a generation that was anointed for that dispensation but let me just say God has not left us without an anointing but we're here for a purpose you were born at the right time at the right season at the right moment in the right condition you may not feel like it you may feel like you're Lord why was I brought into such a a broken world and it's so messed up and there's just a curse upon it and it seems like the World As We Live is getting darker but let me just say friends God has given you the provision of everything you will face in your life in this generation God has already provided what you need and so God would anoint a life he would he would take a man like Jeremiah and God would have a burden upon his heart and and and God wanted to transfer that burden so Jeremiah would would receive the burden as he would say that it was like fire shut up in my bones and what was he referring to that God had passed down his purpose he had he had transferred a vision something that he had for Jeremiah's life and God would take that man and even as Samuel anoints David and and the Bible says it this way that that the the the you know in Psalms it says that oh how beautiful is fellowship for Brethren to to dwell in Fellowship it's like the oil that flowed from Aaron's head down to his beard and and down to His Garment even the urum and thumb and then flowed down all the way down to his feet and what was he doing he was he was drenching he was he was saturating from his head to his toes he was saying this is going to be a consecrated vessel not just a a feeling that you get on the flesh not just an emotion or or just an outward you know of phenomenon but God was saying I'm literally going to baptize this vessel and this vessel will receive a baptism of my anointing and and this is exactly what the angel was saying to manoah about Samson that I'm going to before he was ever born before he ever does anything in his life before he ever makes the First Choice before he ever comes to the first cross Ro of the first decision I just want to let you know I've placed a call upon his life and the call upon his life oh friends when God anoints a vessel it's a very powerful thing it has nothing to do with the mother nothing to do with the father nothing to the m parents were saying what do we do how do we raise him and and what kind of choices do we make and God was saying I want you to understand that I've placed this vision and this burden and it's a powerful thing when I call a man to a job you see life is very much this way it's it's a it's an array of choices I I realize this now you know and I'm not old I just want to go Ahad and say that now I turned 40 back in January and I'm not old and I have kids I have I have four as I told you last night and they're streaming I think today and I I told my you know I said it last night and I you know I I I I I I realize now I may have grandchildren I'm looking at my son who's 20 and he's you know and and I'm just thinking no not possible don't even think about it I'm too young I'm too young called my dad I'm so sorry I made you a grandpa so young but life is life is that way it's it it it it comes I look now back and Survey even from just my little short 40 years and I and I look back and I realize that where I'm at today and the station of the the the the the where I'm at in my life no matter if it's a if that's a good thing or a bad thing because it's a mixture of both and there's many things I could go back and I would say today I I would go back and I would change this and I would change that and and oh I wish I could just make a decision differently and I'll be honest with you today friends if you're not careful the devil will just put you in a spot to where you just live a life of regret and you regret what's your decision was and you wish you would have made a a difference and and oh if I could have just changed that if I could have just raised them differently if I would have just been present at that moment and you know sometimes one of the most painful things that you could do is go back and pull up a photo album how many here raise your hand if you got children that are you know teenagers or or older than teenagers you know one of the most painful things you can do is to go back in an album and look at your little children and when they were small and two and three and four and five and six and and you just ask yourself what happened where did you go how how so quickly life changed so fast and and you can get such a an overwhelming feeling uh of of of of pain just to say that and you know that just the devil will begin to do that to you by looking back and looking to yesterday and oh if I could just go back to that time and I and I'll never forget the moment that I I did that I was ministering somewhere and I I was just uh on my laptop just trying to pull up some notes and I seen a little folder in my in my uh in my on my desktop and it was called precious pics I know it did what what it was big mistake I should have never opened that folder and I open that folder and here's pictures that I'd forgotten I'd put of my children when they were at the zoo and they were two and they were three and four and and and and my goodness I just couldn't believe and and I started looking at these photos and thinking where did time go what's happened how and I I just begin to be overwhelmed by such a feeling of regret of where was I and what was I doing at that moment what was what was I just asked the question to today even even now I I I I just feel the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and I asked myself as I look the those pictures and I just remember saying out loud what were what were you doing in those moments what was so important that you seem like it if if you didn't accomplish it if you didn't if you didn't do this or that and now now look now now how important really was it how important really was it those things that you were chasing those things that you were doing the things that you were giving your time to things that you were spending your time CU you spend it like money and you don't get it back and I just thought to myself and I thought what was so important in your life at that moment and now look now like sand through your hands it's gone you never go back you can't rewind it you can't replay it and the Holy Spirit just began to deal with me so much and I just thought to myself life is you know in it I just say like the Apostle Paul if in this life only I had hope I would be of all men most miserable thank God there's a land beyond the river and there is no time and I just begin to think of that that you know what was so important what was so valuable I challenge you here today friends consider your choices think about your life here for a moment the cost of a decision the cost of a choice the choices that we're making as I look back and Survey that of my children and think what was what was so important in in in my life at that moment and now the time is just flown by and now your children are older and now you can never go back and and I it just calls me as David would would say these words and I think they're so profound he said Lord teach me to number my days teach me to number my days that I may apply my heart unto wisdom teach me Lord to take every moment every moment and here we are at Family Camp 2024 and I just ask you just for a moment to look around look around to those people that you love and those children that you love and your wife and your husband and your your mother and your father and your grandfather and your grandmother just than for a moment what is really valuable what is really what really lasts because if you're not careful you'll blow right through life and you'll just spend all your time and chasing the wrong wrong things going after the wrong things and the devil will get you on a rat race in a circle and you're just repeating the same thing every single day the same patterns every single day and it gets you into such a cycle and you miss you miss the flowers that are growing and petals that are falling and you could live such a life to where you're so overwhelmed with such regret of how I would have done it different oh if I could just go back and I had a brother and I and he was at our at our church and he was just he had reminiscing over the time that I had expressed that and now he had faced the same thing with his children and he said I'm looking at a picture of my son and he's got a bass he's just called and he's just 7 years old and and he said and I just look back now and think oh I wish I could just go back to that moment I wish I could just go back to that moment and really live really live that moment and he said I just you know I'm so overwhelmed by the regret of yesterday I'm so overwhelmed it's almost suffocating me it's I'm so overwhelmed by the regret of what I've done with my life in the past and and the Lord just quickened something to me so powerful and actually to that brother and I just wrote these words and I just said the greatest weapon that you have to fight the pain of yesterday do you want to know what the greatest weapon God has giving you to fight the regret of yesterday today today is the day today is God's day this morning his Mercy was new you have another chance the greatest power to fight yesterday is today what will you do today forget about what you didn't do yesterday and make the right choice today amen life is like that an array of choices small large little ones large ones things that we pray over and we stress over and and choice is such an important aspect of our life every decision we make actually large and small ultimately holds a consequence of where we're at today where we'll be at tomorrow choices big ones little ones I'll go further and I'm just going to say that a lot of things I say this weekend will apply to every generation I'll say things that will apply to you that are teenagers you that are older you that are older than that I won't call out ages but the choices that we make every little decision ultimately has some impact or some consequence some decision in our life that we make and and and and the things that we do the places that we go the things we listen to the music that we listen to the things that we choose to allow to come into our gates the schools the the friends let me say this you choose the friends that you have no one makes you have them as friends the people that we surround oursel with the choice that we have to go to a church the choice of what job where we'll be employed the vocation we have in life and all of these choices no matter how big or how small ultimately has some type of consequence that it bears with it and you know that brother brandham would say that God made it this way God actually predestinated us before the foundation of the world and called us chose us but yet he leaves us with the ability to make a choice you see overcome the prophet of God would say God could not push us through a pipe and then pull us out on the on the other end and say blessed is he that overcometh what did you have to overcome you didn't make any choice but brother bam says but God left us with the ability to make a choice are you with me this morning to make a decision to make a a a you know a a a to make a to make the right choice to make the right decision and in the larger Grand picture you could almost portray it as a graph and you could almost almost like if you've ever studied ballistics and if you ever look at the ballistics of a bullet you have the Velocity you have the energy at the muzzle and then they show the graph of where it will be in a 100 yards 100 meters and then you would the bullet would have dropped this much and the energy would be this much and then at 200 yards it would be this much and life is very much that way that overall the decisions and the choices that we make on a daily basis hold a trajectory of our life of what way which direction we're going whether up or down and Samson's life we can see moves from choices and after you move further you move into Beyond choices and you notice a pattern and there's a certain pattern of his choices and there's like an e or or we would say a flow and you could look at your life now and understand where you're at and where you're going to be and what you realize is that at the end of your life when you finish your race and you come to the end of your journey your life is at a spot and it's only the result of the choices that you've made in life even serving the lord is very much that way Samson learns this very early as we said God anoints his life and we know that Samson was not filled with the Holy Spirit as we're filled you'll read that in the Bible and especially as a young person you can get confused even when you read things as John the Baptist was full of the Holy Ghost from the womb and you can read how Samson was full of the Holy go was you know that had the Holy Spirit upon his life but we know that there was something very different uh uh by the feeling that Samson had and the feeling that the New Covenant brings even the word that is used in the Bible for Breath of God is actually the word ruach and it's the what we would refer to as the spirit of God can I take just a moment to lay this in here it's 1104 I'm watching closely we know that if you were living in the Old Testament you wouldn't have asked the question you know what is the holy spirit because the Holy Ghost was the ruach it was it was the the the invisible power of God it was the same word for breath or for uh wind or for moving air the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters that was what we call the spirit the ruach the breath Genesis 81 refers to this wind that God sends over almost 400 times in the Old Testament this word is used the spirit of God the spirit of Life the spirit of of uh of creation uh Moses speaks of it in numbers 27 and and he says that God gives the breath or the ruach to all living creatures job understands it and says as long as I have life within me the Breath of God in my nostrils eliu tells job the spirit of God the breath the ruach of the almighty gives me life God used the phrase Yu rawe when when he when he tells uh the promise that the Messiah would be uh empowered or endued the spirit of the Lord the Bible says that this way will rest upon him the spirit of wisdom the spirit of understanding the spirit of counsel the spirit of Might the spirit of power the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord that's Isaiah 21 and he refers to this is what was the breath or the lifegiving source that out of God out of that l Goos was the life or the breath and he would give it to all living creatures and so when when Samson's filled with the spirit what was it it was the enabling ruach or the Breath of God that God would Breathe Into the life of Samson the prophet of God would say it this way uh when the spirit of God was upon Samson Samson could take 2,000lb Gates and carry them 30 miles and he says but when you remove the spirit of God from Samson he was like any other man he says that as says that about Israel they were just a he says when you remove the shout of the king from the camp Israel was just like any other nation and so what was it it was the enabling power that the God would Breathe upon the people and it would enable them to do things that they otherwise could not have done it would also enable them to be what they could otherwise not have ever been it would allow a prophet to say what he otherwise wouldn't have said but the the spirit of God let me just say this friends the spirit of God makes all the difference I said the spirit of God makes all the difference and so you say what do you say brother matter I'm saying if we remove that what do we have Samson was just like any other man when you remove the spirit of God from him and so so this was this was the promise that the Old Testament left us with two simple promises that there would come a man a man that was so full of the spirit he was so anointed that he would have all of these abilities all of the gifts all of the fruit of the spirit in one human life the Bible would say it this way he would have the spirit the ruach the breath without measure and so there would be no limitations as Samson was only given a portion of it but it also left us not with just Jesus who the spirit of God would rest upon but that after that that same ruach or Spirit of the Lord would be poured out on God's family so that from one man who had everything the spirit of God would come and a many membered body would be made up of that great eternal spirit and so notice this as Samson is is as we said he's filled with this enabling Force this is how what you know he how he accomplished I want to skip some of this just to save time this morning and get to something before we close but he was Samson's anointed from birth from the very moment he's born it's a very special anointing upon his life life God says he shall begin to deliver in fact if you ever look up the word judges and if you ever study the Book of Judges from the Hebrew Bible if you ever study it all and not saying you need to but if you ever just look at the Hebrew Bible even if you just pull open a tanak and you take the Book of Judges as actually not the word judge but actually saviors is actually the English word because these men were saviors not savior in the sense of our savior who saved us from our sins but but they were saviors they would begin to save the people and so Samson was at the calling upon his life was a a Deliverance anointing a saving anointing to begin to deliver the people from their oppressors and so we know that Samson's life the Bible says that they were living under oppression and even the barrenness of manoah's wife was just a signifying the barness of of Israel and it was a result of their backsliding and and so they begin to cry out to God and God hears the cries and and and so he he he begins to deliver them and he uses as the Bible says judges or saviors and so it was something I want to say this that he was born with brother benam in in in in and I'm trying to remember the name of the message but he's speaking what uh um uh about mo why Christ speak and he's speaking about Moses and he was showing how that Moses had all of his intellectuals and he said all of his he says he says he knew God from his intellectuals and he says oh but what a difference it was when he meets the burning bush and the anointing comes upon his intellectuals and now it's not just a God that he heard about but it's a God that spoke and spoke he spoke and it spoke back to him and brother bam says that he says I think any man or woman boy or girl to have the gospel or the knowledge of the word on his intellectuals is a good thing but it's got to go further than that it's got to move from the intellect and he's got to be anointed or consecrated in his heart and brother bham says oh he says notice Moses I love this was born with the equipment born into him yeah notice that he was born with the equipment another words he says every son or daughter of God is born with the equipment in other words God has already got a job for you and before he ever gave you that job he already equipped you you might not feel equipped mom but God's already equipped you if he gave you a child then he gave you the equipment needed to make that child who we ought to be and brother vam says he equips you for the job long before you ever started your course God already charted your journey do you realize that my brother my sister before you ever came into the world God already wrote a blueprint for your life and in that blueprint is everything that you will ever need the prophet of God would say it this way in this life's journey everything you have need of is already in the seed of God that was placed in you before you ever were born he was born with the equipment his journey is charted he's already charted the course for Samson from his birth unto his death now that doesn't mean that Samson will ever surrender to that remember we're preaching to you on the cost of a choice although God had blueprinted he had charted from the end from the beginning everything Samson would ever go through every challenge he ever had everything he would ever face every every decision he would ever make every trial he would ever go through every bit everything God had already predestinated it God had already ordained it God had already seen it God had already watched over do you realize friends that's how God treats your life God has never I want you to to get this through to you God is never worried about what worries you God is never stressed over what's stressing you today God is never in anxiety he never has a panic attack he's never up there wondering going oh no what did they do what am I going to do now and now I've got to go to plan B Plan B then work go to plan C God doesn't run things that way but before you're ever born he already made a provision for everything you would ever go through in your life the lows the highs the ins the outs God already made a way for it if you'd ever get a revelation from that you'd live your life a lot different and sort of like you know the the man who's you ever watched a a man who's watching a you know a I remember never forget walked into a restaurant and I was preaching and and and I walked to get me some take my me and my wife some takeout food and it was so amazing because when I walked in there I realized you know that that the that the restaurant was just completely silent I couldn't believe it I didn't know what was going on I noticed everybody was watching the TV screens of some football game not football like you guys play football but like football that kind of football and they were watching some kind of football game and and it was just like they were they were mesmerized I mean I couldn't believe it I walked in there to walk up and it's dead silent a restaurant that's normally loud in commotion and everybody's just Frozen on the screen and they're watching Tennessee play some college game and it was some big game and big moment and then you could just feel the tension you know you can sense tension in an atmosphere you really can you know when you walked in on something you're like oh boy what did I just walk into you could feel that tension and I could feel it the second I walked in there I thought my goodness and you could tell the score was tied and there was like 13 seconds left and they were about to kick a field goal and and everybody was just frozen and it was so amazing and I just watching that and I watched this there was so much stress and they have all their shirts on and here they have their team you know and they're wearing their shirt they're Insignia and their team is is kicking the winning goal and there's several of them that go I can't even watch I can't even watch and they just walk out of the room and they just walk out they literally leave the restaurant don't even tell me I don't even want to know just want to walk out they couldn't watch that moment I thought my goodness could you imagine here's the big moment here's the moment you've been waiting for your team's about to kick the winning field goal and you're so worried and so stressed and so bothered I know none of y'all are like you New Zealand people no I don't do that and they're so worried and so stressed I couldn't believe it I mean it was such worry you could just feel the Panic they were waiting just don't don't want to know what's going to happen they almost don't want I'm thinking here's your team is on the winning goal line they're about to win the game and you're so troubled you know where fear comes from I'm going to tell you fear is only based on the unknown cuz you don't know what's going to happen and when you don't know what's going to happen listen friends until you get a revelation of your life as already called by God anointed by God chosen by God you're already glorified your your life your entire Journey has already been seen by God unless you get that Revelation you'll live every day saying I don't know if I'm saved I don't know if I'm born again I don't know what's going to happen and the devil will get you and just like those people couldn't watch that moment they couldn't be there was so stressful what's going to happen you know what's so powerful though you ever watch a man who's watching the game as a replay yeah that same man who was so stressed out he's just eating popcorn oh just watch this part watch right here but they just fumbled oh that doesn't matter he watches the game entirely differently what is it it doesn't matter if he fumbles Hallelujah it doesn't matter if he throws an interception he already knows I win in the end oh my brother if you could ever get a picture of the book you're already a winner you've already won in Christ Jesus and nothing can happen to you that can separate you from your destination in Christ Jesus if you ever get a picture you'll live your life completely different Hallelujah Jeremiah would say for I know the thoughts that word means the plans yeah I know the plans that you have for me oh than he says I know the thoughts that you think towards me saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil but to give me an expected end that means pre-planned not random not oh you might make it might not might make it might not what the Bible is saying is that God charts the course of every life with a specific plan let me say it this way Specific Instructions and the instructions he has over my life won't work for yours and the course he's charted for me I can't you can't walk that I can't walk your course in fact you'll go through things that I will never go through because I'm not not made to go through them and you'll face challenges that I'll never face in my life because God has not equip me to face that challenge but let me just say I want to give you confidence today if you're if God has called you to it God will see you through it if God has called you to it he will see you through it he's already equipped you regardless of how you feel today even Pharaoh was raised up the Bible says for a purpose you know even Judas was raised up for a purpose but let me just say my purpose is not a pharaoh it's not a Judas I'm not here to walk away from the truth I've been called to be an overcomer in Christ Jesus the prophet of God would say if he called me then he must have had a purpose in calling me and I intend to serve the purpose God has placed in my life life and so let me just take just a turn here before we close it's 11:20 Samson's life is chared it's blueprinted it's you say my what more could he need brother Matt what more did he need he had an anointing he had a calling God had even before he was ever born and God said I'll never remove that calling from your life even all the way to your death that calling will stay right there waiting waiting waiting waiting you say what more what more did Samson need he had everything wow you see but here's where the problem here's where the trouble comes in man though he's anointed though he's called though he's chosen though he's predestinated he's also made up of memories conscience reasonings imaginations affections and God has given him the ability to make a choice to make the right decision we know his story very well I don't want to take time just to read through it but you know the story in judges I think it's four the next chapter CH chapter 14 he's telling his parents to you know to take this woman of Timnath and and get her for me for a wife and as Samson's parents are saying Samson is there not a woman from amongst the daughters of our people but you've got to go to the Philistines and and and and and and and all of this you see then his life goes from there and he's in Gaza and and he's you know sleeping with a harlet there and then he raises up and God you know gives him God gives him a great Victory but you notice this pattern in his life and it seemed like he would just for a season he would for that moment for That season a time you know he was faithful to the Lord and then he would dip right back down go right back into that same rut and then he would Shake himself and then spirit of God would come and he delivered out of that and then he'd go right back up and then right back down you go all the way through his life and you see this life of never making a firm decision you know brother bam says that you've got to make a clearcut decision a clearcut decision he preaches that message forsaking all and says any man or son or daughter of God would have to come to that place in their life to where they're willing to forsake all mother father brother sister husband wife willing to forsake all you know it's a it's a let me just say this it's a powerful thing for a son or daughter of God when they could ever get to that place in their life when God knows their heart that they are willing to forsake all to follow him I tell you what it'll bring a power in your life like you've never known it'll bring an anointing upon your life when God ever gets a man to a place or a woman to a place where he knows they're willing to forsake it all for the Lord Jesus and Samson's you know his life very well the Carnage that follows his life we don't have time to get through all of it but it's just a life of chaos and Carnage you find the same exact thing in Genesis if you have your Bible turn with me to Genesis chapter 28 quickly if you could Genesis chapter 28 you find the very similar life in this man Jacob and I want you to notice this as Jacob says this here and it's such a powerful thing when God in Genesis chapter 28 he appears to Jacob and out of a dream and and I just want you to notice here is let's just pick it up here and let me find my place let's just pick it up here in verse 12 and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angel of God ascended and descended on it behold the Lord I want you to see this the Lord stood above it I love that the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father the god of Isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it into thy seed thy shall thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and shall spread abroad to the west and to the east to the north the South and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee behold Jacob I am with thee do you know God says this and this is when he makes a covenant promise to his children he says in the book of Isaiah can a woman forget her suckling babe yay they may but I'll never forget you behold I have Graven you in the palms of my hands I'll never forget you and and and he says this here to Jacob behold I am with thee and I will keep thee in all the places all the crossroads all the turns all the left turns all the right turns Jacob you're going to go a lot of places God never told you to go you're going to find in Jacob's life God said go right and Jacob went left they're going to find go God tells Jacob to go straight and Jacob does a U-turn and goes back the other way but you know what's so powerful about that is God says I'm with you in all of the places that you go in other words I'm not going to stand there and wait when you go right I'm just going to stand there and wait and let you go God says I'm going to go with you I'm going to tell you Jacob I'm going to give you my instruction I'm going to give you my word but I want you to notice the Covenant of the promise I'm placing upon your life will be one that never departs from you behold notice this read it together I am with thee verse 15 and I will keep thee in all the places that thou go and I will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee [Music] Hallelujah until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of Jacob woke up and Ja Jacob says oh surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not takes a pillar and a stone and he takes oil and he anoints it and he's memorializing this place and Jacob says oh he says surely the Lord was here and I knew it not and this is none other than the house of God and he names this place notice this is his original calling his commission his experience and he names this place bethl the house of God notice this here in verse the verse 17 he was afraid how Dreadful is this place none other than the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven he takes the St pours oil upon it calls the name verse 19 the name of that place bethl but the name of the city was called lse at the first and Jacob vow to vow saying if God be with me and keep me in this way that I go I will give me give me bread to eat and raign to put put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God and the stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee God is you notice what happens he places his promise he joins himself to Jacob in fact if you ever look up the word When God Says behold I have Graven thee in the Palms this is Isaiah 49 I will not forget thee I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls Isaiah 49 are continually verse 16 before me thy walls are continually before me how alone you know sometimes you can feel so alone and so so so such Solitude in in our own personal strength struggles I don't care what struggle it is if it's a besetting sin if it's some addiction if it's some something that's tripping you up and you can sometimes feel so alone oh and sometimes you think of God as an anger that God is just ready to strike you and he's just left you all alone because you're worthless and we you know we think that God has just been on giving us wrath or judgment but do you realize what God is actually saying is such the contrary I'll never leave you your walls are continually before me I will not forget you your walls the word here is choma which means joined to a wall it's like a brick mason when he lays a brick upon another brick and upon another brick before you had bricks that were separate but now they become one piece and God says when I made the promise to you I want you to understand how powerful it is Jacob I'm joining myself to you in other words your captivity is my captivity your prison becomes my prison your anguish becomes my anguish your sorrow becomes my sorrow let me give you the language of the New Testament he is a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities I'm join to you Jacob and no matter where you go I'll go no matter where you stay I'll stay and God makes this promise now 40 years Jacob from this moment that Jacob sees this dream Jacob wakes up and 20 oh long years 20 long years of time elapsed from that experience you say what was it brother Matt surely it was years of prosperity and years of serving the lord and years of accomplishing things for God no you'll find 20 long years of backslid in Jacob trials and tribulations and sorrows and but you know what God was always joined to Jacob just as he gave the promise to Samson I'm join to you Jacob after leaving bethl Jacob settles down quickly forgets that glorious Supernatural moment in that dream that he has he becomes cold he becomes carnal he becomes backslid and lustful and then God Appears to Jacob again notice this in Genesis 31 could you turn there quickly Genesis 31 I want you to notice what God says here to Jacob he comes to him and he visits him again Genesis chapter 31 look at verse 13 I am the god of bethl where thou anointest the pillar where thou vow to vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land in other words I don't need to discuss what you've done you already know what you've done wrong we don't need to rehearse it I just want to give you my message get up Jacob go back to bethl I'm not the god of your coldness I'm not the god of your backslid andness I'm the god of bethl where th vow to vow and return go back to bethl Jacob go back to bethl this was God saying remember Jacob how I touched you remember how I spoke to you remember that experience that you had now get back to the altar get back to bethl where you made a vow unto me instead Jacob sh settles down in Sheck instead of listening to God instead of heeding the voice of the Lord Jacob goes to sheam sheam means two things if you look up the word it means going back not back to bethl but backsliding and also means a place of burdens a place of burdens burdens God never intended for Jacob his wife his children his sons his daughters this wasn't part of the blueprint this wasn't part of the plan this was a deviation this was a detour and Jacob goes to Sheck them the place of burdens and oh oh Jacob do you realize what burdens that choice the cost of your choice do you realize who it was going to affect it's not just you but now your house is going to become Dishonored one of your daughters going to to be defiled your sons do you did you did you survey any of this before you ever made that choice oh friend sometimes if we'd ever weigh as Jesus said count the cost did you weigh it out Jacob when you were reasoning and rationalizing and you were going to make that decision yeah you knew that job was going to take you away from church but you needed to make the money and you Justified it because of this and because of that need but did you you really weigh the cost of what it was going to cost you did you really ever realize Jacob that now your choices are having a collateral effect they don't just affect you they affect the mother they affect the children they affect the church oh but I feel led you know I I feel led you know it's amazing sometimes what we will attach to I feel led yeah I feel led and sometimes you look at the decision that people make and you think there is no way you felt led I feel led to take this job that takes me out of the house of God let me just say this the leadership of God will never lead you away from his word the leadership of the holy spirit will never lead you away from the spirit of God is that all right did you realize your sons are going to have to become murderers to save your daughter what happened what happened you had a plan you had a promise you had a calling you had a vision you were chosen God ordained you God predestinated you how do you end up here Jacob what are you doing do you realize the effect this is going to have the burdens that you so needlessly are going to have to bear did it ever cross your mind did it ever did you ever stop I promise I promise that God warned you why long before you ever made it I promise he was faithful to warn you he will never tempt you above that which you can be tempted but with that Temptation he'll make a way of Escape Samson he warned you he wasn't he was faithful in telling you when you took that girl and you knew that she wasn't a Believer and you knew that you tried to justify it in your mind and I'll persuade her and I'll get her to church and oh you knew when you took him as your boyfriend and you knew what you were oh well I'll get him into church and I know what God can do but you were warned Samson you were told by your parents you were warned do you know what the problem was with Samson is all Samson seen was Mom oh it's just Mom it's just Mom it's just Pastor you know I know I know I know I know he preach going to preach it going to preach the same thing you know what the problem was is that Samson failed to heed the warning signs do you know God always puts the warning signs in your life he puts the barricades he he puts the warning signs it'd be like going over a road and and there are signs that would any of us get in our car and just you know broken road closed don't don't enter do not enter all caution red light caution turn around go the other way how many of us would just get in our car and just blow through them and just pit barricade and sandbags and barrels flying this way and lights flashing this we're just going right through them warning turn around you say that's funny and how many times does the Lord warn us and warn us and warn us and warn Us in sermon after sermon and service after service and mother after father after brother after your friend don't do it don't go that way and God warns us and warns us and warns us and we just keep going and going and going friends this is just what the Lord I didn't expect to preach this but I'm just obeying the Lord go back Jacob what are you doing you're going to this place of burdens did you ever did you ever consider what it would cost you Jacob did you ever know what kind of mess you would create by disobeying the Lord God comes to him in Genesis chapter 33 I want you to notice this here you know let me just stop here and say had we been there had you been his daddy we would have treated him so much different that had been my son that had been your daughter oh had we been there we' have straightened him out I'm going to straighten you out son going to straighten you out Jacob you're a mess your life's a mess because of your Disobedience look at what shame you've brought look at the sorrow look at how much torment you brought to your family and your family oh how different our heavenly father treats us how differently a heavenly father treats this child Jacob in Genesis chapter 35 turn there if you could Genesis chapter 35 we're going to close Genesis chapter 35 I want you to notice how differently God treats him Genesis CH 35:1 and God said unto Jacob arise go up to bethl what was it it was the same thing he had been saving the whole time his message doesn't change he just keeps repeating it arise Jacob arise no word no word about sheam no word about Dena no word about her sons no wor about his sons no wor about no word about anything you say God are you not going to mention anything to him are you not going to say anything about the mess that he made are you not going to scold him for it God every had every right to scold him for it are you not going to say anything why didn't you ignore me why' you ignore my instructions why didn't you do what I told you to do why didn't you listen why are you so disobedient why are you such a why are you so weak Jacob why do you refuse to listen but God didn't say any of that God never even mentions it he just simply says you know what to do child get up get up get up Jacob get up off the ground get up stop graveling on the dirt stop growling around child get up arise go back to bethl go back to your first love go back to your first experience Jacob go back to where I appeared to you from you say what is it brother Matt what what what do we need to get back you don't need nothing other than a repented heart to say Lord I'm sorry I made the wrong choice I'm sorry I made the wrong decision but today is the day of salvation today I'm going to choose to make a different Choice oh how many can say that today and say Lord today let me make the right choice for my life today let me arise and go back to bethl you know what Jacob did I love this jacob picks up all of his garments all of his idols and he and he burns them takes all the earrings and takes all of the garments of that land and he burns them and the Bible says there he creates an altar notice this let us arise Jacob said un his household verse two of Genesis 35 and all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean I love that and be clean and change your garments let us arise and go to bethl go up to bethl and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods that were in their hand all their earrings which were in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by sheam and they journeyed and the terror of God was upon all the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob in verse 7even and he built an altar he built an altar and he called The Place El bethl notice before notice the name change because before Jacob named it bethl he names it bethl but now it's going to be El bethl in other words not House of God but God's house a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit to dwell in and God says Jacob Jacob put away all your strange garments Jacob put away all of your past come back to bethl arise Jacob I'm not here to scold you I'm not here to rebuke you oh I'm here to restore you Jacob I'm here to bring restoration to your home restoration to your family restoration to your children how many want it here today restoration to everything the devil has taken from your life and your children and your family and your home oh could you stand to your feet when raise your hand say Lord I accept it today Father I'm coming back today Lord Lord with a simple with just a simple plea Lord I come coming back to bethl putting away all my strange Gods putting away all the things Lord father and today Lord I make a choice I make a decision Lord to go back to bethl musicians could you come to arise and go back to heed the voice of the Lord friends every head bowed every eye closed such a simple thing such a simple thing obedience but I just want to tell you today that one of the greatest things that'll unlock unlock the power of God in our life is just simple obedience to his word sometimes we pray and we pray and we pray and we're seeking God and we're seeking the direction of God and seeking the will of God but do you realize God will never show us what's next if we're not faithful in doing what he's already told us to do you'll never find the channel of what's next until you submit to what God has said now I wonder if there'd be somebody here on this Opening Service even before we start this these meetings there's a lot of things that we might need in our life a lot of things that we're looking for a lot of things we're praying for a lot of decisions a lot of burdens and things that we carry friends I don't care what state I don't care how messed up your house is I don't care how great the task seems I don't care how impossible it seems I want to tell you this morning in such a simple way the Lord just put this upon my heart this morning even before I came to service and I want to tell you that everything St starts here's what I know you say how do I get to the finished product how do I how do I get back to full restoration how do I how does I come back to full reconciliation here's what I know it starts with repentance it's got to there's nothing you'll never get anywhere in God until you come to this place of bethl come to the altar of repentance and say God I just want to start right here Lord I want to turn around and go the other direction Lord save my home save my house save my children where does it start revival can only begin at the place of repentance to say God I've been wrong but today I Want to Be Right Lord oh my hands up I rais both of my hands today and say Lord if there'd be anywhere in my life that I'm be I'm not obedient Lord to what you've showed me if I'm come to any spot in my life Lord where I've been disobedient Obi to a word that you've spoken I don't want to continue down the same pattern with the same choices but today I I want to fight yesterday with one choice today that could change my entire life one decision to say today God I want to make a choice Lord and I just want to say would you forgive me Jesus would you forgive me Lord I want to be clean wash my mind wash my memory wash my conscience wash my spirit Lord I I I I want to stand before you without condemnation I wonder if that'd be the prayer of a young man maybe a mother father maybe you'd pray that and raise a hand and say Lord I just want to stand before you Justified I don't want the devil to the accuser to be able to fight me or bother me in my mind from these meetings from receiving the word and trying to tell me what I did and how what I did yesterday today Lord I want the the washing of the Water by the word to come and justify me Lord and as though I never did it in the first place I raise my hand and say God wash me clean me Lord God that I may stand before you white pure unadulterated untouched Lord where I could stand before you as the Bible says if our hearts condemn us not then we can have faith to ask for whatever we ask whatever we need Lord if our hearts condemn us not I pray Lord you would give us that this morning Lord as we close this beginning service we give you all the praise all the glory we thank you for
