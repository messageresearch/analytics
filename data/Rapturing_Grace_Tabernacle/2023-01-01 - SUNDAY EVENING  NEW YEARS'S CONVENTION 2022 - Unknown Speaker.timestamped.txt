[9:28] you already ordained it before the
[9:30] foundations were laid. And Lord, we've
[9:33] heard from our theophanes.
[9:35] And Father, we want to see you because
[9:37] your word [music] promises that when we
[9:40] shall see you, we shall be like you. And
[9:43] you said at that day,
[9:46] the day that we're living in

[9:54] invite your presence. We invite the Holy

[10:04] May it touch every soul.
[10:06] May it change our lives. May we leave
[10:08] this place a different person. Father
[10:10] God, that is our desire

[20:40] Amen. God bless you all.
[20:44] Um it's Amy's like, "Oh, Kim, don't say
[20:47] what you always say, but I can't help
[20:48] it. It's such an honor and a privilege
[20:49] to be here.
[20:53] and we're so glad that we could have
[20:54] made it just to be with family here in
[20:56] um beautiful Stratford and we've just
[20:59] been so so blessed. Um been watching the
[21:02] services online and managed to squeeze
[21:04] in for the last little bit of this
[21:06] morning and we just oh God is so good. E
[21:08] so so so good.
[21:09] Amen. Amen.
[21:10] What a way to start 2023. [laughter]
[21:13] And um like the song before just said,
[21:15] you know, he is God alone. And this song
[21:17] just speaks about how um you know
[21:19] despite our failures and our letdowns
[21:23] and how we just yeah just must make him
[21:26] cry, Jesus never fails.
[21:28] Amen.
[21:29] And we just trust that you'll be blessed
[21:30] by this song. Amen.
[21:40] Is it on?
[21:53] So many souls have tested him throughout
[21:57] the course of time.
[22:00] So [music] many still reach out to him
[22:03] with broken hearts in mind. And every
[22:07] [singing] one of them will say
[22:10] without exception that they [music]
[22:12] fight.
[22:14] Jesus
[22:16] never
[22:18] fails. He never [music] fails.
[22:22] Even in the days of old, he brought his
[22:27] people through.
[22:29] And then he came to show his love
[22:32] [music] and died for me and you. Then he
[22:36] rose [music] again to prove that every
[22:40] story had been true.
[22:44] Jesus [music]
[22:46] never
[22:48] fails.
[22:52] Jesus [music]
[22:54] never fails.
[22:59] Jesus
[23:01] [music] never [singing]
[23:02] fails.
[23:06] You might as well get thee behind
[23:09] [music] me, Satan. You cannot prevail
[23:13] because [music]
[23:14] Jesus
[23:16] never
[23:18] fails. [music]
[23:30] Sometimes [music]
[23:31] this world brings troubles.
[23:34] I find so [music] hard to bear. I know I
[23:39] could not make it without Jesus being
[23:43] there.
[23:44] It's so encouraging [singing]
[23:45] [music]
[23:46] to know however deep we're in this
[23:52] Jesus
[23:54] [music] never [singing]
[23:55] fail.
[23:59] So what [music] can I do to prove to
[24:02] you? Tell me how can you [music] deny
[24:07] no one told facts, no mysteries
[24:11] and oh so [music] cut and dry. And I'm
[24:14] in the stand of your life. [music]
[24:17] I'll be the first to testify
[24:23] that [music] Jesus
[24:26] never
[24:30] [music]
[24:31] Jesus
[24:33] never fail.
[24:37] [singing]
[24:37] [music]
[24:38] Jesus
[24:40] never fails.
[24:44] [music] You might as well get deep
[24:47] behind me, Satan. You cannot prevail
[24:52] because Jesus
[24:55] never
[25:01] [singing]
[25:04] Jesus [music]
[25:07] never fails.
[25:12] Jesus
[25:13] he never fails.
[25:18] [music] You might as well be behind me.
[25:22] Satan, you [music] cannot prevail
[25:26] because Jesus
[25:28] never. [music]
[25:34] My Jesus
[25:38] never
[25:40] [music] he never fails.
[25:47] He [music] never [singing]
[25:49] [screaming] fails.
[25:55] [screaming]
[25:59] [music]
[26:10] Praise the Lord.
[26:12] Amen.
[26:14] Amen.
[26:14] And alive.
[26:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. [laughter]
[26:19] actually it is worth it all. A I think
[26:22] it is. We'll sing that and then so
[26:27] [laughter]
[26:28] praise the Lord. Uh so then we have
[26:30] Sister Shalom and the choir will come
[26:31] up. So if they start making their way up
[26:33] now, then we have the Rapture and Grace
[26:35] Tabernacle. We've got a song and then
[26:37] the Rapture Grace Grace Youth got
[26:40] [music] a song. So we'll just sing
[26:44] it is worth it all. as they come up now.
[26:46] It will
[26:49] [music and singing] be worth
[26:51] it all
[26:54] [music] when we see [singing] Jesus.
[26:59] [music]
[27:03] Life's [singing] child
[27:05] [music] will see
[27:07] so soon.
[27:10] [music]
[27:11] Can we see
[27:18] [music]
[27:19] what
[27:26] Oh, [music]
[27:27] sorrow
[27:30] with.
[27:34] [music] So let [singing]
[27:37] us run the race [music]
[27:42] till we see
[27:46] him. [music]
[28:23] [music]
[28:31] [music]
[28:34] Rejoice
[28:37] upon [music] the Lord. Lord [singing]

[29:31] We [music] know the [singing] enemy is

[29:37] [singing]
[29:39] He [music] always seems to point us to
[29:41] everything that's going wrong. [singing]
[29:46] But if we'll only keep our eyes on the
[29:50] message [music] he has brought us, the
[29:54] joy will begin to swell up and we sing a

[30:38] around me so I could clearly see my way

[50:10] richly. And while we're standing, let's
[50:12] open the word of the Lord.
[50:13] Amen.
[50:15] And um what a what a wonderful time we
[50:18] have. And hallelujah. Thank really all
[50:20] the those who work behind the scenes and
[50:23] before the scenes. And my prayer is that
[50:25] we are not too to too to too to too
[50:28] tired this afternoon, but we're just
[50:31] fixing our eyes to to the Lord Jesus.
[50:34] And we we are reading in First Kings
[50:36] chapter 19 verse 10.
[50:39] First Kings chapter 19 verse 10.
[50:48] And he said, "I've been very jealous for
[50:51] the Lord God of hosts.
[50:54] For the children of Israel have forsaken
[50:56] thy covenant, thrown thine altars and
[50:58] slain thy prophets with the sword, and
[51:01] I, even I only am left, and they seek my
[51:04] life to take it away." And he says, "Go
[51:07] forth and stand upon the mount before
[51:10] the Lord." And behold, the Lord passed
[51:12] by, and a great and strong wind the
[51:15] mountains, and break in pieces the rocks
[51:18] before the Lord, but the Lord was not in
[51:21] the wind. And after the wind, an
[51:23] earthquake, but the Lord was not in the
[51:25] earthquake. And after the earthquake, a
[51:27] fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.
[51:30] And after the fire, a still small voice.
[51:34] And it was so when Elijah heard it that
[51:36] he wrapped his face in his mantle, went
[51:39] out and stood in the entering of the
[51:42] cave. And behold, there came a voice
[51:45] unto him and said, "What dust thou hear,
[51:48] Elijah?"
[51:49] May the Lord add his blessing to the
[51:51] reading of his word. We may be seated.
[51:53] Hallelujah.
[51:54] It's a great honor for me to minister
[51:57] again this afternoon to you. I really
[52:00] thought that uh part of you were already
[52:04] would it have went home but it seems
[52:06] that we are that many many people still
[52:08] left. May the Lord richly bless you and
[52:11] uh it's a great honor for me to be among
[52:13] here. Uh I told brother Away I really
[52:16] didn't had had on my heart to come. I
[52:18] was just tired and I wanted to stay home
[52:20] and wanted to be with the family and so
[52:22] forth. I I came just by friendship to
[52:24] him because he was asking different
[52:26] times and and I said come you cannot let
[52:28] your friend down but today I'm happy
[52:30] that I came [laughter]
[52:33] really happy and so God bless you all
[52:35] richly and it's a great honor for me to
[52:37] be just part of the family of God and uh
[52:40] happy to see the new faith brother east
[52:42] and brother Ferdy and their families and
[52:45] really really wonderful people here in
[52:47] New Zealand. I I don't know why all the
[52:49] sympathic people are here in New
[52:50] Zealand. I I sometimes sometimes we have
[52:53] to mix it a little bit worldwide but God
[52:56] has a wonderful bride wherever they
[52:58] wherever wherever God's word is revealed
[53:00] and God has wonderful people everywhere.
[53:03] God bless you richly. If you wouldn't
[53:05] mind I enter directly into the subject
[53:07] and because I have something on my heart
[53:09] which is very very dear this afternoon
[53:11] and for tomorrow. I mean all the
[53:12] services are very dear but uh I would
[53:15] like to talk something that I never read
[53:18] in books but something that I found in
[53:20] the message and which is part of my
[53:22] ministry for the moment and before I
[53:25] entering into this I just always want to
[53:28] say please keep in mind uh uh when when
[53:31] when we have 90 minutes I mean we spoke
[53:34] speak about the theophony there's a lot
[53:35] of things that brother blame a lot of
[53:37] aspect we cannot cover them okay it's
[53:40] it's it's it's it's just to give a give
[53:42] a general thought about the what we call
[53:44] the general the changing of dispensation
[53:48] and uh please keep all these things in
[53:50] mind brother said many many things about
[53:52] that and there's a lot of aspects that
[53:54] could not be covered like this but here
[53:56] is a thought that I would like to to to
[53:58] to
[54:01] share with you uh what I was saying this
[54:03] morning about you have to understand God
[54:07] thinks from the end to the beginning he
[54:09] does not only know the end but he thinks
[54:11] back. Huh? And here is uh here is a
[54:14] little proof in the Bible. It's the it's
[54:16] it's the song of Moses.
[54:19] The song of Moses is not actually Moses
[54:22] song. It was God's song that he dictated
[54:24] to Moses.
[54:25] It was God's song and it tells the story
[54:28] of the Jews from the beginning till the
[54:31] end. Okay? It tells how God chosen them,
[54:34] how they will fall back, all these
[54:36] things. the whole story of the Jews till
[54:38] the end is in the is in the song of
[54:40] Moses. And he even says and you can see
[54:43] Revelation 19. I can see everything
[54:45] right in if you just read with an open
[54:47] heart. But here he says for example in
[54:50] verse 26 in in Deuteronomy he said I
[54:54] would scatter them into corners. I would
[54:58] make the remembrance of them to seize
[55:01] from among men. Look, even the Holocaust
[55:04] is foreshadowed.
[55:06] That's right.
[55:07] Amen. Because the Holocaust was not
[55:09] Hitler's idea. It was God's idea.
[55:12] Amen. The Jews are the only people. They
[55:15] always try to be scattered away and
[55:18] always tried tried to to to seize their
[55:21] remembrance from among men. But then
[55:25] there is a little left over and God
[55:27] continue his way.
[55:28] Amen. So, so Hitler and all these
[55:31] people, they were just fulfilling
[55:33] [clears throat] what God had already
[55:35] prophesied over them. Huh? But then at
[55:38] the end, at the end of the book of
[55:40] Moses, you see everything in God has a
[55:43] happy end.
[55:44] He says, "Rejoice all you nations with
[55:48] his people, for he will avenge the blood
[55:51] of his servants. He will render
[55:52] vengeance to his adversaries. He will be
[55:56] merciful unto his land and to his
[56:00] people.
[56:01] Amen.
[56:02] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[56:04] Therefore, I think it was Ben Gurion. He
[56:06] said, "We are the the people of the book
[56:08] and of the land."
[56:10] All right.
[56:10] Amen. God never forgot what he's told
[56:13] about them
[56:14] to bring them back to give them to to to
[56:18] be merciful at the end to them. So, that
[56:20] is how God sees the bride. Therefore,
[56:23] what we're hearing this morning,
[56:24] therefore, brother Ben Brandon could
[56:26] say, I I do not know if you understand
[56:29] what I'm saying now, but I call you now
[56:31] bride in the seventh seal. Not only
[56:33] church, I call you bride.
[56:35] And you would say, I don't feel like a
[56:37] bride, but God says, I see you already.
[56:41] You the the thing that you perceive of
[56:44] yourself is nothing else than a mirage.
[56:47] You are not the one that you think that
[56:50] you are. You are the one that God thinks
[56:54] you are
[56:57] because life messed you up. Life life
[57:00] messed me up. Therefore, we are never
[57:01] talking. We were not preaching to polish
[57:04] the outside man.
[57:07] Amen. We are preaching to in inspire the
[57:11] inside man.
[57:12] If the inside man is right, the outside
[57:14] man comes into subjection.
[57:17] But it takes its time. So don't think
[57:18] that somebody says, "My theophony is
[57:20] working. and I'm still smoking that
[57:23] we're not talking about this. If if if
[57:25] the inside mind is fed up if it's fed
[57:28] and you will nourish it and it will grow
[57:30] I mean it will have an effect on the
[57:31] outside man.
[57:33] But the more you polish the outside man
[57:36] doesn't mean that the inside man is
[57:37] growing
[57:38] becomes just more religious not more.
[57:40] So be a dove and start from the inside
[57:42] to the outside.
[57:44] Can you say amen?
[57:45] Amen. That's so important because
[57:48] because uh now here I give you an
[57:50] example or here I give you a proof for
[57:52] every young person if he if if he has
[57:54] the Holy Spirit or not. Brother Bram
[57:57] said there is an inner man who is
[57:59] craving for those vitamins.
[58:03] That's the reason you love to eat to
[58:05] read the message.
[58:06] Amen. and to read the book and to write
[58:09] read the Bible and to pray and to come
[58:10] to church because there's something
[58:12] inside who needs these kind of vitamins.
[58:15] Can you say amen?
[58:17] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So you
[58:19] will see how God works and and I will
[58:21] start directly go into into some kind of
[58:24] of of a of a of a of a of a coaching
[58:28] this morning. Okay. again.
[58:30] So, we have a little bit of a special
[58:32] service with a little bit of a video,
[58:34] but it's just wonderful.
[58:37] And I thank you too that you take me the
[58:40] way I am. You know, God made me a little
[58:41] bit special, a little bit a jokey a
[58:43] jokey German. You don't find always a
[58:44] jokey German. You
[58:48] [laughter]
[58:49] when I'm going sometime to the US, I say
[58:51] I always say I have more haha spirit
[58:53] than you. [laughter]
[58:57] But behind be behind my jokes is always
[58:59] a serious message. Do you remember?
[59:01] I'm not a clown. I have something to
[59:03] say. But I have a certain way of
[59:04] sometime breaking a little bit the ice
[59:06] and take the tensions away and and and
[59:08] and Okay.
[59:10] So what we have is is I will especially
[59:14] I want to speak to all of you but
[59:16] especially to young people who want to
[59:18] marry.
[59:19] Okay. That means to all young people,
[59:23] all who will marry, all who will think
[59:26] to have children one day. I want to
[59:28] speak especially to you. I have one
[59:30] couple here. Amen. Uh uh haha, brother
[59:33] Mary's daughter and our precious
[59:34] brother. But I certainly there are
[59:37] different others in the pipeline. Okay.
[59:40] Wants to marry. So we wish you already
[59:42] from this side the very very best. God
[59:44] bless your marriage. I want to speak all
[59:46] of you h who are in the start of their
[59:49] journey of life. Now brother Brandham
[59:51] preaches about that scripture
[59:56] in the message 1959
[59:59] what does thou hear Elijah and there is
[1:00:02] two titles which are similar.
[1:00:05] He preaches what does thou hear Elijah
[1:00:09] and what does thou hear? What are you
[1:00:11] doing here? What does thou hear Elijah?
[1:00:15] That was the last year
[1:00:18] when brother Brandham mentions his life
[1:00:22] testimony
[1:00:23] after the opening of the seals. Brother
[1:00:26] Brenham doesn't speak about himself
[1:00:27] anymore.
[1:00:28] All right.
[1:00:29] I mean because now a greater than
[1:00:30] William Brandham is here.
[1:00:33] Brother Bren doesn't give his life story
[1:00:35] after the opening of the seal because
[1:00:36] you know one thing the ministry of
[1:00:38] Eleaza now is there to connect the bride
[1:00:41] with the bridegroom. It's
[1:00:43] a difference
[1:00:45] and I learned it from brother from our
[1:00:47] brother. Once you find your position,
[1:00:50] once you find your purpose in life, you
[1:00:53] stop chasing your own tail.
[1:00:59] As a minister, as a brother, as a
[1:01:01] father, as a mother, once you find your
[1:01:04] place in God, you stop chasing your own
[1:01:07] tail.
[1:01:08] And I want to say this, you can only
[1:01:10] help people if you stop chasing your own
[1:01:13] tail.
[1:01:15] You can only be affected in God's
[1:01:17] economy if we're not constantly standing
[1:01:20] in our own way.
[1:01:22] Can you say amen?
[1:01:24] We have to come to peace with ourselves.
[1:01:28] Then I can take care of others.
[1:01:31] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:01:33] This message
[1:01:35] has a transforming power.
[1:01:40] I've seen it over and over. I can today
[1:01:43] say there is nothing too hard for God.
[1:01:47] But it is a process.
[1:01:50] It's not that that Santa Claus comes
[1:01:53] from Germany, lays hands on you and then
[1:01:57] and then and then the problems will be
[1:02:00] solved. It will be your fighting with
[1:02:03] the angel yourself.
[1:02:06] There is nobody who comes with some
[1:02:08] special meeting and here comes Superman.
[1:02:10] He has some super preaching and he has
[1:02:13] an S and and then he goes
[1:02:16] and we have to invite the man back next
[1:02:18] year so that we are Superman. It's not
[1:02:20] so we are inspiring one another but you
[1:02:23] have to wrestle with that angel
[1:02:25] yourself.
[1:02:28] Therefore, maybe I'm a little bit
[1:02:29] strong. I'm a little bit hard. You have
[1:02:31] a right to stream
[1:02:34] but be sure it has no value
[1:02:41] because it will become entertainment for
[1:02:43] you.
[1:02:44] Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] You must take your time of prayer and
[1:02:47] eating the book and getting into the
[1:02:49] message and whatever. If not, you are
[1:02:51] just entertained by some and you and you
[1:02:53] get the new kick. Oh, tremendous,
[1:02:56] tremendous, tremend.
[1:02:59] Amen.
[1:03:00] You have a right to do everything, but
[1:03:02] it's not prophetist many times. Amen. We
[1:03:05] see that the prophet Elijah, he was a
[1:03:10] melancholic type of a person. And we see
[1:03:14] that he was a tremendous man who killed
[1:03:18] 400 of these priests.
[1:03:22] And when he did this,
[1:03:25] he got an email
[1:03:29] from Jezebel.
[1:03:32] I told when I was preaching Esther was a
[1:03:36] very special person.
[1:03:38] Amen. Martin Luther said uh the book of
[1:03:42] Esther should be uh thrown into into
[1:03:45] into the river
[1:03:47] because for him Esther the book of
[1:03:49] Esther first it was too Jewish
[1:03:52] was his her first problem. that it was
[1:03:54] too feminine
[1:03:56] and then it was too there was the name
[1:03:58] of the Lord God was never mentioned in
[1:04:00] the book of Esther
[1:04:02] and Jesus never mentions the book of
[1:04:04] Esther.
[1:04:06] Paul never mentions the book of Esther.
[1:04:08] Amen.
[1:04:09] But brother Brennan was the first
[1:04:11] messenger preaching about Esther.
[1:04:14] And he and he calls it the marriage of
[1:04:16] the lamb
[1:04:18] in typing this is a special time. This
[1:04:21] is bride age.
[1:04:23] This is a special time.
[1:04:25] Blessed be the name. And Esther was the
[1:04:27] only in a positive sense only woman in
[1:04:30] the Bible who was called a queen.
[1:04:34] David never had a queen. He had women.
[1:04:37] Solomon had never a queen. He had women.
[1:04:40] Amen.
[1:04:41] Amen. Jezebel was never called queen
[1:04:43] Jezebel. Just Jezebel.
[1:04:46] Esther was the only queen
[1:04:49] in a pos there was queenalia but but in
[1:04:51] a positive way. Esther was the only
[1:04:53] queen
[1:04:54] because Esther types the bride.
[1:04:57] Amen.
[1:04:57] But but but when he got that email, he
[1:05:00] he was running into the desert and
[1:05:02] brother Bram said this. The same man,
[1:05:05] the same religion, the same God, but now
[1:05:09] the anointing left the man
[1:05:12] and he was just running away.
[1:05:15] Amen. And he took his friend Ghazy with
[1:05:18] him. And after some time he told Ghazy,
[1:05:21] "Ghazy, look man, [clears throat]
[1:05:24] let you stay here. Let me go into the
[1:05:26] wilderness for a for for for for a day
[1:05:29] to be by myself."
[1:05:32] Brother Ram said there was nothing wrong
[1:05:34] with the prophet Elijah, but his nerves
[1:05:38] were at the end.
[1:05:40] You must understand we are we are
[1:05:42] consisting of body, soul, and spirits.
[1:05:46] You can take it either way. spirit body.
[1:05:49] We know what we want. We we know if we
[1:05:51] want to understand the message, we
[1:05:53] understand.
[1:05:54] Okay. So he said people who are in that
[1:05:57] condition, frustrated,
[1:06:00] depressed,
[1:06:02] overworked.
[1:06:04] Brother Brandham in the 60s speaks about
[1:06:06] a sickness what we would call today burn
[1:06:08] out.
[1:06:09] He says people in that condition they
[1:06:11] want to be alone. That is the moment
[1:06:14] when they leave church.
[1:06:17] That is the moment when they need a
[1:06:19] veil,
[1:06:20] a big fish to take them over and carry
[1:06:23] them a little bit through.
[1:06:25] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:27] So he said, "Let me be alone."
[1:06:30] Brother Bam said, "The stress of today
[1:06:34] makes the people tired in the message,
[1:06:37] what what dust thou hear, Elijah?" And
[1:06:39] brother Bam said this, "I never spoke to
[1:06:42] so much tired people than today." Oh,
[1:06:45] hallelujah.
[1:06:47] We eat better than ever.
[1:06:50] Better more more calories.
[1:06:57] More green food, whatever. Which is
[1:06:59] fine.
[1:07:00] We are better fed than ever,
[1:07:05] but we are more tired than ever. It's
[1:07:07] not the It's not the food.
[1:07:09] It's not the coke.
[1:07:11] Amen. But it's the pressure from an
[1:07:13] unseen world that makes people tired.
[1:07:17] Therefore, I said this morning, you must
[1:07:19] find your oasis on Sunday.
[1:07:23] To really slow down
[1:07:26] to to come down and to deal with things
[1:07:30] that are eternal.
[1:07:32] And brother Bam says, "Our bodies are
[1:07:34] strong,
[1:07:36] but they need rest from time to time."
[1:07:39] Quote of the prophet Hallelujah.
[1:07:42] In this message,
[1:07:43] he said there is some people they think
[1:07:45] they can always run and run and run and
[1:07:47] run and they will find out that they
[1:07:49] that they will break down soon
[1:07:52] because these bodies need rest from time
[1:07:54] to time.
[1:07:55] Life is a balance
[1:07:58] of all things
[1:08:00] and everyone has to charge his battery
[1:08:03] from time to time. And here is that
[1:08:05] prophet. He's he left the anointing.
[1:08:07] He's so depressed. And brother Bram said
[1:08:10] he he he he he he
[1:08:12] uh uh uh uh his nerves were at the edge.
[1:08:17] In reality, brother Bram speaks about
[1:08:19] himself in that message. He said, "I'm
[1:08:21] exactly there under that juniper tree."
[1:08:24] Speaks about himself.
[1:08:26] I could now waste my time, but I will
[1:08:28] not do about 400 prophets, 400 people in
[1:08:31] Chicago that that that that always the
[1:08:33] same parallel. Okay? But we we're
[1:08:35] wasting not. Amen.
[1:08:38] So what happened is this while he was in
[1:08:40] that situation he wanted to die
[1:08:43] and sometimes it's not a dying
[1:08:46] physically
[1:08:47] but sometime people want to die
[1:08:49] spiritually.
[1:08:51] Amen.
[1:08:52] Amen. Is that brother Gloin?
[1:08:54] Oh wow brother gone. Good to see you.
[1:08:56] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They want to die
[1:08:59] spiritually.
[1:09:00] Okay. So what happens is and here is
[1:09:05] something that you have to keep in your
[1:09:06] mind. God never sent a social worker.
[1:09:11] I was preaching this morning about the
[1:09:13] theophony and about the word that is in
[1:09:16] the bride which brings a transform
[1:09:18] transformation. So that you understand
[1:09:20] psychology is not our way.
[1:09:24] But you have to understand the psyche of
[1:09:27] a person to understand to help that
[1:09:30] person.
[1:09:31] Amen. Huh.
[1:09:34] From there on, we see that God sent an
[1:09:37] angel down.
[1:09:39] And the and the Bible says he just made
[1:09:41] him to sleep.
[1:09:44] Amen. And brother Ram said the the the
[1:09:47] trees around him were full of angels.
[1:09:51] I hope that you know that you're never
[1:09:52] alone.
[1:09:54] Even if you don't see, if you don't
[1:09:55] feel, you're never alone. Brother Ramy
[1:09:58] said when Moses arrived at the Red Sea,
[1:10:00] he said those angels were everywhere
[1:10:02] just waiting for a command.
[1:10:07] In 2023, you're not alone.
[1:10:09] Hallelujah,
[1:10:10] brother. If you have a website or no
[1:10:12] website, you're not alone.
[1:10:14] If you have if you have uh whatever
[1:10:17] Amen. If you have hotspot or not, here
[1:10:19] is your hotspot anyhow.
[1:10:23] Amen. [applause]
[1:10:25] So he woke up and he let him sleep
[1:10:28] again.
[1:10:29] And then when he woke up again, that
[1:10:31] angel had a special food.
[1:10:36] And brother Bam said, "I want to know
[1:10:38] what kind of vitamins were in those
[1:10:41] cookies."
[1:10:43] Because the prophet Elijah, he was
[1:10:45] running for 40 days and 40 nights.
[1:10:48] Hallelujah.
[1:10:50] And you must understand the message that
[1:10:53] we believe is Red Bull.
[1:10:57] [cheering]
[1:11:00] The message we are not a sect. Why
[1:11:03] should we become sectarian?
[1:11:05] We are not a denomination. Why should we
[1:11:07] become denominational?
[1:11:09] We are not a cult. Why should we become
[1:11:11] a cultish?
[1:11:13] What is the message of the hour? Is it a
[1:11:15] doctrine? Is it a religion? It's our
[1:11:17] father speaking to us.
[1:11:20] Brother, brother, we Germans, we don't
[1:11:22] cry much, honestly. Only in football.
[1:11:27] [laughter]
[1:11:30] But but and and I'm sure you're not
[1:11:32] crying. You're not too emotional here.
[1:11:33] See the man here? You're a real
[1:11:35] masculine man. You're not crying too
[1:11:36] much.
[1:11:37] Amen.
[1:11:39] But one thing is sure, when we were
[1:11:42] reading the life story of Brother Ben,
[1:11:44] we start we cried. Is that correct?
[1:11:47] When about me and whatever, we were
[1:11:49] crying
[1:11:49] because that was our story
[1:11:52] because we find out we're in the family
[1:11:53] of brother Brian. That's our brother.
[1:11:56] Can you say amen? We were crying because
[1:11:58] that was something that touched our
[1:11:59] heart.
[1:12:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[1:12:03] find out that that when a person
[1:12:07] passes away when he dies and he said and
[1:12:10] is so said by medicine the last the last
[1:12:14] sense that he has is the hearing
[1:12:19] and they found out if a young boy falls
[1:12:22] into a coma or a girl and for example
[1:12:25] the boy is a Michael Jackson fan you put
[1:12:28] Michael Jackson on his ears and by the
[1:12:30] voice that he likes so much She comes
[1:12:32] back eventually.
[1:12:35] I told the church if I fall into coma,
[1:12:38] you know what you put on my ears
[1:12:40] [laughter]
[1:12:40] because it's not the voice of brother
[1:12:42] Brandham.
[1:12:43] But we have something in us to have the
[1:12:45] voice in the voice
[1:12:48] brother. That's our father speaking to
[1:12:50] us.
[1:12:51] Amen. So the message
[1:12:54] is red bull for our hearts.
[1:12:56] Yeah. With that word we are running to
[1:13:00] the rapture and to the millennium and to
[1:13:03] the great times hereafter.
[1:13:06] Now what happened to the prophet Elijah
[1:13:10] tied to Revelation chapter 10 when the
[1:13:13] mighty angel comes down and he has
[1:13:16] something to eat for the brides.
[1:13:18] Ah he here you have something to eat.
[1:13:20] Eat it and you can run.
[1:13:22] Can you say amen?
[1:13:24] Amen. So, so, so in that sense,
[1:13:28] this message has the answer for all our
[1:13:32] question
[1:13:33] because it's not William Brennham's
[1:13:36] idea.
[1:13:37] It is not William Brandham's wisdom. It
[1:13:39] is God speaking to a dying generation.
[1:13:44] Brother Brandham was just a voice. But
[1:13:46] receive it as God's word.
[1:13:48] Now the second thing as an introduction
[1:13:51] that we go through these slides is to is
[1:13:54] to share a testimony which is tragic but
[1:13:58] it's true. A minister in our in our a
[1:14:02] good friend of mine is a pastor. He has
[1:14:04] a clear orientation to Pentecostalism
[1:14:08] but it's a good friend of mine.
[1:14:11] He came to me and said, "Brother Marcus,
[1:14:14] we had a we had an affair in my in our
[1:14:16] church that we had a youth camp. We were
[1:14:18] all rejoicing and a young girl
[1:14:21] uh started crying hysterically
[1:14:25] and she came to my wife and then she
[1:14:28] confessed
[1:14:29] she was abused by her own uncle.
[1:14:33] Both are in the message. Both are in the
[1:14:36] same church. I mean there was even a
[1:14:39] picture of brother Blam and of Christ
[1:14:41] and all these things in the room where
[1:14:42] she was abused different times.
[1:14:46] She goes now to the parents
[1:14:48] and the parents as as it was an African
[1:14:51] family, a central African family, the
[1:14:53] parents said, "You shouldn't say anybody
[1:14:55] about that."
[1:14:57] H
[1:14:59] and the girl found out that the uh
[1:15:04] that the reputation of the family was
[1:15:07] more important for them than the soul of
[1:15:09] their own daughter.
[1:15:11] And that made them her to crack. And the
[1:15:14] pastor is a more Pentecostal orientated
[1:15:17] person. But he told me this to me. He
[1:15:20] said, "Marcus, I tell you one thing. I
[1:15:23] believe in laying on of hands. I believe
[1:15:25] in healing." There's not a question at
[1:15:27] all. But that girl was not wounded in
[1:15:30] her body. That girl was wounded in her
[1:15:32] soul.
[1:15:33] And I found out I cannot take that girl,
[1:15:38] lay hands, and say, "God bless you.
[1:15:40] Never done. The Lord be with you."
[1:15:42] I said, "We have now to deal with that
[1:15:45] situation."
[1:15:46] Hallelujah.
[1:15:47] That girl doesn't need a slogan. That
[1:15:49] girl needs healing.
[1:15:51] And now the question is, it must be in
[1:15:53] the message. And this message gave us a
[1:15:58] lot of tools
[1:16:00] to deal with situation.
[1:16:02] Brother, we were we were we were
[1:16:04] Pentecostals before. For us was
[1:16:06] everything was laying on our hands and
[1:16:08] [snorts] and and an altar call. That was
[1:16:10] the only instrument that we know like in
[1:16:12] the middle ages the only thing that you
[1:16:14] could do is uh cutting a person that he
[1:16:17] loses a little bit of blood. Whatever
[1:16:18] sickness what it was always we take a
[1:16:21] little bit of blood and that that's what
[1:16:22] it but now we have a range of
[1:16:24] possibilities and therefore put on your
[1:16:27] spiritual jacket. Okay. Can you say
[1:16:30] amen?
[1:16:30] Amen.
[1:16:31] There's no problem. And I want to tell
[1:16:33] you one thing. We will be confronted
[1:16:36] with situations in our churches that we
[1:16:39] not dreamed about 10 years ago.
[1:16:42] And you should not be naive about that.
[1:16:45] It comes. It's on the way. But if the
[1:16:48] enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord
[1:16:50] prepared already.
[1:16:52] Okay. Amen. So please if if the
[1:16:54] technician help me. So every everybody
[1:16:58] is doing fine. I'm you are leaning back.
[1:17:00] All is well. It's just a message. Okay.
[1:17:03] So the the the very message that we
[1:17:05] believe started with healing. Do not
[1:17:07] fear. I'm sent from the presence of God
[1:17:10] to tell you that your peculiar birth and
[1:17:13] peculiar life has been to indicate that
[1:17:16] you are taking a gift of divine healings
[1:17:18] to the people of the world. If you will
[1:17:20] get them to believe you and be sincere
[1:17:22] when you pray, there will be nothing
[1:17:24] standing before your prayers.
[1:17:26] Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] That is God's nature. Amen.
[1:17:31] Brother, young person, God wants to give
[1:17:33] you the Holy Ghost more than you desire
[1:17:36] it
[1:17:37] because God loves to give.
[1:17:40] That's his nature.
[1:17:42] That's again, keep this in my in mind. I
[1:17:45] know that I said a a sentence this
[1:17:47] morning that came back to me. I have to
[1:17:49] correct it.
[1:17:51] A village can have two message churches,
[1:17:56] can have three message churches, can
[1:17:58] have five message. That's not the
[1:18:01] problem. But the way how we are dealing
[1:18:05] with one another,
[1:18:07] brother, we have young people. They left
[1:18:09] we say they they they
[1:18:12] uh [snorts] uh uh uh they are just
[1:18:14] renegades. No, no. You know what their
[1:18:16] testimony is? Amen. We saw people that
[1:18:19] we know from random tabernacle and we
[1:18:20] were not allowed even to greet them
[1:18:22] because they didn't belong to our local
[1:18:24] church. Brother that is in the message
[1:18:26] today.
[1:18:27] Amen.
[1:18:29] Amen. So the question is if there's
[1:18:31] different message churches are we
[1:18:34] praying for one another?
[1:18:36] Because look our children they are
[1:18:38] watching us.
[1:18:40] We cannot fool them. We cannot tell them
[1:18:42] a story. Can we say look here is another
[1:18:44] group but uh let's visit them from time
[1:18:47] to time. Let's invite them from time to
[1:18:49] time. Let's pray together. Let's have a
[1:18:51] communion together.
[1:18:53] We differ on certain things but we are
[1:18:54] family of God.
[1:18:56] Can you say amen?
[1:18:58] So I hope that I could correct myself
[1:19:01] because because the nature of our father
[1:19:03] as brother Brandham when these people
[1:19:05] came you could feel that he knew who was
[1:19:08] standing before him. He said young lady.
[1:19:12] Sometime he says here is a sister.
[1:19:14] Sometime he says here's a brother that
[1:19:16] comes here. Here's a minister. He knows
[1:19:18] who he is. But he doesn't say okay man
[1:19:21] you're not a believer so no time for
[1:19:23] you.
[1:19:25] Brother Ram never asked do you pay your
[1:19:27] tithings? Do you go to church? Here is a
[1:19:30] person who needs help. And God loves to
[1:19:32] help.
[1:19:34] He doesn't ask.
[1:19:36] Why should we ask? Amen.
[1:19:38] Amen.
[1:19:39] Can you say amen?
[1:19:40] Amen.
[1:19:41] Why should we become a sect?
[1:19:43] If we are not called to be a sect,
[1:19:45] why should we be this?
[1:19:46] Amen.
[1:19:47] Amen.
[1:19:49] That's what I said. If sometime people
[1:19:51] if we we we can speak about the eagles
[1:19:53] and the elect and supersede of God, it's
[1:19:55] all fine. But the more you supersede,
[1:19:58] the humbler you become. [clears throat]
[1:20:00] If we cannot talk to our brother because
[1:20:03] he doesn't have the same level of
[1:20:04] understanding that us, something is
[1:20:06] wrong in our heart, brother.
[1:20:08] Because if somebody is strong, he helps
[1:20:11] the little one a little bit up. Come on.
[1:20:14] Here we go. Next one, please. Amen. And
[1:20:16] that is this. It's changed
[1:20:20] from a healing in the flesh to the
[1:20:23] healing in the soul. And that is where
[1:20:26] many message believers, they just stay
[1:20:28] with the flesh.
[1:20:32] We know that God does great things, but
[1:20:34] it is not a a a a a public show anymore.
[1:20:38] I seen what is the vision. I seen
[1:20:41] bringing them a lady upon a stretcher.
[1:20:43] There was a lady there talking her name
[1:20:45] and things on the paper and there
[1:20:47] someone come and God pushed her through.
[1:20:50] The next man comes through with
[1:20:51] crutches. I see them go through that
[1:20:52] little building. tense vision and on the
[1:20:55] outside the lady come out scream on the
[1:20:57] top of her voice pushing the stretcher
[1:20:59] and then there was another lady on the
[1:21:01] other side looked like kind of a
[1:21:03] darkhaired woman she said what happened
[1:21:07] she said I just don't know I couldn't
[1:21:09] tell you what happened I have been
[1:21:11] paralyzed for 20 years and look I feel I
[1:21:14] was never sick and then just out came a
[1:21:16] man leaping and jumping with his
[1:21:17] crutches in his hand I looked at that in
[1:21:20] the vision
[1:21:21] what we call the tent vision Yeah.
[1:21:24] Look, here is people they are getting
[1:21:27] healed without knowing how they got
[1:21:29] healed.
[1:21:32] Got it. Got it. It was not a minister.
[1:21:34] They couldn't say somebody laid hands
[1:21:36] said we went into a building, came out,
[1:21:38] and we were healed.
[1:21:40] Everything is a vision.
[1:21:44] You get it?
[1:21:45] Do you know that we have to change a
[1:21:47] little from Pentecostal thinking now to
[1:21:49] come in a higher message realm? Because
[1:21:52] for the first two pulls, the man William
[1:21:55] Brennham was needed.
[1:21:57] Brother Brandham could not say, "Brother
[1:21:58] Neville, take their hands." That was the
[1:22:00] gift in the man William Brham.
[1:22:03] But at the at the third pull, at the
[1:22:05] 10th vision, Brother Brandham said, "I
[1:22:07] just looked and there was that pillar of
[1:22:10] fire over that went to that building and
[1:22:11] these people came out to be healed." It
[1:22:13] had nothing to do with the man, William
[1:22:15] Brham.
[1:22:17] Uh-huh.
[1:22:19] Uh-huh. We can have prayer lines.
[1:22:20] Nothing is is right. But I believe that
[1:22:22] we are called to something higher than
[1:22:24] this.
[1:22:26] We are called, we are called that
[1:22:28] everybody takes the word personally.
[1:22:32] Blessed be the name. But it's nothing
[1:22:33] wrong. Somebody needs a prayer line.
[1:22:35] Young people is no problem. But you come
[1:22:36] to an age where we think I we should
[1:22:39] rise a little bit higher.
[1:22:40] Amen. Okay. Next one, please.
[1:22:42] So exactly this. Here's a person. Listen
[1:22:46] closely. We're coming to that girl who
[1:22:48] was who was abused.
[1:22:50] The person who dreams a dream is not a
[1:22:53] dream is a subconscious.
[1:22:56] Let's say the normal man. He is his
[1:22:58] first conscious and here is
[1:23:00] subconscious. When this one becomes
[1:23:02] inactive, inactive, this one is active.
[1:23:06] Now you people that's dreamed a dream.
[1:23:08] You dreamed dreams years ago that you
[1:23:10] still remember today very prominently.
[1:23:12] Is that right? Well, there was some part
[1:23:16] of you somewhere.
[1:23:19] Amen.
[1:23:20] Talk about for us the theophony is
[1:23:22] already mystic. But look what does
[1:23:24] brother say here.
[1:23:25] Amen.
[1:23:27] Some part of you was somewhere because
[1:23:29] you still it's it isn't conscious. You
[1:23:31] remember the things you saw in some
[1:23:34] other conscious in our subconscious.
[1:23:37] Next one please.
[1:23:38] Amen. Why we're not a denomination. And
[1:23:41] when you let your faith run out to its
[1:23:44] end till you begin to believe, then let
[1:23:47] your subconscious go to acting. Then the
[1:23:51] faith of God will back it up and you
[1:23:53] will go outright. See, cause your faith
[1:23:56] won't do too much. Your subconscious has
[1:23:59] to move in the direction that your faith
[1:24:01] is moving and then God's faith moves
[1:24:03] behind it and confirms it.
[1:24:06] Oh wow. Talk about psychology.
[1:24:10] Brother Brandham said God is the
[1:24:11] greatest psychologist.
[1:24:13] Quote brother Brandham.
[1:24:15] Amen. And we are we do good to try to
[1:24:17] understand what is the subconscious
[1:24:21] most of our again this is a teaching in
[1:24:25] 90 minutes just just a little fragment
[1:24:28] out of that teaching.
[1:24:30] But the subconscious is like a big CD
[1:24:34] ROM.
[1:24:36] Everything,
[1:24:38] every impression that you got through
[1:24:40] your five senses is stored somewhere.
[1:24:43] That's right.
[1:24:45] Deep in you. Amen. Every good word and
[1:24:48] every bad word.
[1:24:50] Therefore, if you are a person, brother,
[1:24:54] you take a a father who has two sons.
[1:24:57] He takes the first one. And I can even
[1:24:59] show it in the Bible by the parable, but
[1:25:00] I don't have time. I want to have the
[1:25:02] first son. Daddy says, "Boy, we believe
[1:25:04] in you. You're a wonderful young man. We
[1:25:06] make we stand behind you. Amen. And the
[1:25:08] same father says to the other boy, "Boy,
[1:25:10] I tell you one thing. You're nothing
[1:25:12] than a loser." Brother, sister, you have
[1:25:14] to understand our words have power.
[1:25:19] Especially for the bride because we have
[1:25:21] the spoken words.
[1:25:23] Amen. The same man is now developing in
[1:25:26] a different direction.
[1:25:28] If I if he if he believes me, you know,
[1:25:30] it's a joke. Amen. But if he would
[1:25:32] believe me and I said, "Oh, I will be
[1:25:35] your father." I said, "You are nothing
[1:25:36] else. You are shamed for the family. You
[1:25:38] are nothing else then and you believe."
[1:25:40] He built up a complex for all his life.
[1:25:44] Amen. [clears throat]
[1:25:45] Do you see why God is always speaking
[1:25:47] positive to us?
[1:25:49] Do you see why brother Bl is good news?
[1:25:53] Yeah.
[1:25:54] So all things that we
[1:25:58] that we that we receive in our life,
[1:26:01] it's somewhere stored.
[1:26:03] 10% of our conscious is conscious. 90%
[1:26:08] is on subconscious.
[1:26:10] Brother, you cannot tell your heart to
[1:26:12] stop beating. It's in the subconscious.
[1:26:15] You cannot tell your stomach to stop uh
[1:26:18] digesting. Is in the sub subconscious.
[1:26:21] All our feelings, everything is in the
[1:26:23] subconscious. We cannot even manipulate
[1:26:26] it. It's there.
[1:26:29] And it is like a little bomb
[1:26:33] that will explode one day.
[1:26:35] Amen. If we have enough accumulated
[1:26:39] enough traumatas,
[1:26:42] it will it will it will destroy. It will
[1:26:44] explode.
[1:26:45] Yeah. Imagine those Catholic boys
[1:26:49] that were raped by a by a priest.
[1:26:53] [crying] A man the boy he he thought
[1:26:57] that priest is a holy man,
[1:27:00] somebody to counsel and now that holy
[1:27:02] man takes him and we know what that
[1:27:03] means. Many of these youngsters take
[1:27:05] their life
[1:27:07] because they cannot live with that.
[1:27:08] Yes.
[1:27:09] You understand?
[1:27:11] Words, action, all these things.
[1:27:14] So somebody is deeply hurt in his
[1:27:17] feelings.
[1:27:19] Many times different times
[1:27:22] he has a in in in in in in extreme he
[1:27:26] has a trauma in her soul in her
[1:27:28] subconscious. Now we come and we say,
[1:27:31] "Look, uh, all your sins and all your
[1:27:35] problems, throw them in a sea of
[1:27:37] forgetfulness and put on a a little a
[1:27:40] little a a little frame which says
[1:27:43] fishing forbidden." Hah, praise the
[1:27:45] Lord. Everybody says, "Even the church,
[1:27:48] but you cannot do this." These are nice
[1:27:49] slogans that will not work.
[1:27:52] These are slogans that will not work
[1:27:54] because if something is in us, it comes
[1:27:56] up.
[1:27:58] The time comes sooner or later.
[1:28:01] Amen.
[1:28:01] It waits for an opportunity.
[1:28:05] It's there latin deep in us.
[1:28:08] Therefore, these things have to be dealt
[1:28:11] with
[1:28:13] by the Holy Spirit
[1:28:16] by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:19] Bring it to the surface. And brother, I
[1:28:22] deal with people where I know that it
[1:28:23] works.
[1:28:25] Bring it to the surface. people now can
[1:28:28] digest it and then bring it under the
[1:28:31] blood and then it's over.
[1:28:33] But brother, these things is not a
[1:28:36] little prayer line. Forget it.
[1:28:38] This is not a a a healing in the flesh.
[1:28:42] This is a healing in the soul.
[1:28:44] This is a process from Sunday to Sunday.
[1:28:47] Can you say amen?
[1:28:49] It's so important. So all our
[1:28:51] impressions
[1:28:52] is deep in us. That explains many many
[1:28:56] many reactions of believers.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:28:59] Amen. Brother, I'm taking care of people
[1:29:02] now in the third generation.
[1:29:05] I'll tell you one thing. You see strains
[1:29:07] in families from grandpa to to grandson.
[1:29:10] The same problems. Sometime in sexual
[1:29:12] ways, sometime in in in any way.
[1:29:15] Amen. And people I tell you uh they mean
[1:29:18] well they explode or they act they they
[1:29:23] spiritually they slap in your face and
[1:29:26] the next day they say oh I'm so sorry
[1:29:28] for them really and they really feel
[1:29:30] sorry but it's too late.
[1:29:33] There is certain things that you cannot
[1:29:35] repair anymore.
[1:29:36] So it's so important that we are healed
[1:29:39] from the inside to the outside.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] Amen.
[1:29:43] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:29:45] So important. H definitely. So, so we
[1:29:48] see uh to to to give a little
[1:29:50] demonstration, we see a little bit of of
[1:29:53] brother Brandham. Okay. This is in the
[1:29:55] journal of what we call the only belief
[1:29:58] magazine.
[1:29:59] This is brother and sister I think way
[1:30:01] if I'm if I if I'm not miston
[1:30:05] man and his wife. Now sister man, she
[1:30:08] has their testimony. She had always was
[1:30:12] extremely afraid like a like a phobia
[1:30:16] when it came to storms.
[1:30:18] She had phobias and she thought it is a
[1:30:21] demon according to a testimony in the
[1:30:23] only belief magazine. She said, "I want
[1:30:26] to speak to brother that he's chasing
[1:30:28] out that demon out of me." Okay. And we
[1:30:32] were driving in the car one day and
[1:30:33] brother Bram looked through the rear
[1:30:35] mirror and he looked me in my face and
[1:30:37] he said, "Sister man, I will now explain
[1:30:40] why you have that kind of phobia.
[1:30:43] 7 years before you were born, your
[1:30:46] father was in a storm and he had a
[1:30:49] trauma there."
[1:30:50] Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] And you inherited these things in those
[1:30:54] genes.
[1:30:55] Yes, sir.
[1:30:56] And then brother Brandham explains and
[1:30:58] you see here's a sister who's born again
[1:31:00] but it's still in his subconscious.
[1:31:03] That's what we that is what we never
[1:31:05] understood as Pentecost. We thought the
[1:31:06] Holy Ghost comes and we are new
[1:31:08] creation. Therefore we always ask if we
[1:31:10] are born again or not.
[1:31:12] Amen. But there's two different levels.
[1:31:15] Amen.
[1:31:16] What happens is then that that he said,
[1:31:19] brother Blie explains if a horse gets
[1:31:22] bitten by a snake.
[1:31:24] All the children of that horse are
[1:31:26] afraid of snakes though they never seen
[1:31:28] one.
[1:31:30] It's already in their genes that kind of
[1:31:32] fear.
[1:31:32] Amen.
[1:31:33] Amen. for this
[1:31:36] uh achievement, spiritual achievement
[1:31:40] about the inheritance of traumas in our
[1:31:43] genes
[1:31:45] as a person got in the beginning of the
[1:31:47] year 2000s the Nobel Prize of
[1:31:49] psychology. This is what brother said
[1:31:51] already in the 60s.
[1:31:54] Amen. I forgot the the the expression
[1:31:56] for it. And then that woman said this
[1:31:58] and that will help you a lot to come to
[1:32:01] peace with yourself. She said, "I still
[1:32:04] had those phobias when I saw the storm,
[1:32:07] but I now knew from where it came
[1:32:10] and I could rest."
[1:32:12] Yeah.
[1:32:13] Amen. It I I didn't I didn't dramat it
[1:32:15] didn't dramatize me anymore. I knew it
[1:32:18] was not me. It was something just in my
[1:32:20] jeans.
[1:32:21] It wasn't a demon because nothing is
[1:32:24] worse if you think that you are
[1:32:25] demonpossessed and there is no demon.
[1:32:27] Yeah.
[1:32:28] Can you say amen?
[1:32:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now we
[1:32:31] see now an example of brother Bram, can
[1:32:33] you say amen so far?
[1:32:35] Maybe it's not for everyone, but all you
[1:32:37] young people who want to marry, make
[1:32:40] sure that your hearts are clean because
[1:32:42] your children will pay
[1:32:44] for the complexes that we never came
[1:32:46] over.
[1:32:48] Therefore, two young ben people want to
[1:32:50] marry, forget it until you are born
[1:32:53] again. Forget that story because you
[1:32:55] will bring your life mess and your life
[1:32:58] disaster. You bring it into the
[1:33:00] marriage. and now your children can pay
[1:33:02] for it. Wait until you are really filled
[1:33:06] with the Holy Spirit and and and and
[1:33:08] that God really cleansed our hearts and
[1:33:11] our soul and our minds.
[1:33:13] Can you say amen?
[1:33:14] Amen.
[1:33:14] It's not a law, but it's a good
[1:33:17] suggestion that brother Brandon gave us.
[1:33:19] Make the next one, please, to support.
[1:33:21] Okay, here we go.
[1:33:23] Please do so.
[1:33:26] Listen carefully, please.
[1:33:27] Excuse me, sister. have [music] to relax
[1:33:30] my mind one. Now we are these strangers.
[1:33:33] I see that you are strictly a stranger
[1:33:35] to me. Yes, sir. [music]
[1:33:36] You're from away from here. Yes, sir.
[1:33:39] You come from another city.
[1:33:42] You've got a lot of trouble on your
[1:33:43] heart. You got hard troubles to begin
[1:33:46] with. Is that right?
[1:33:49] There's a whole lot of blackness. I see
[1:33:50] a black sheet keep following you like
[1:33:52] that. Or it's a lie. Somebody stole a
[1:33:54] lie on you. And that was a man was
[1:33:56] professing divine healing. Yes, sir.
[1:33:59] He said you was the witch. Is that true?
[1:34:02] And you got a forester in your church or
[1:34:04] something to God. Isn't that right? Your
[1:34:06] pastor's sick right now. He's got polio.
[1:34:07] Is that right?
[1:34:09] Sister, don't pay no attention to what
[1:34:11] them people tell you. They're alive. And
[1:34:13] the only thing wrong with your heart,
[1:34:15] that nervous condition, got your heart
[1:34:16] worked up. Go on, home in peace. And God
[1:34:18] bless you. You're all right. God bless
[1:34:20] you.
[1:34:21] Hallelujah. Talk about psychology. Huh?
[1:34:24] Talk about psychology. Okay. Look at
[1:34:26] this. How
[1:34:28] stop you can stop it. Okay,
[1:34:31] brother. Therefore, we cannot play
[1:34:33] brother Brham.
[1:34:34] These things are over. I
[1:34:37] I feel
[1:34:39] brother. We cannot play with souls.
[1:34:42] These things are holy.
[1:34:44] These things are full of responsibility.
[1:34:48] Because look at this. Now here comes
[1:34:50] that woman. She doesn't know what what's
[1:34:51] wrong with her. But something is
[1:34:52] completely wrong. She has problem with
[1:34:53] her heart. Now brother Bram said this.
[1:34:55] Okay. Now imagine brother Brennham would
[1:34:57] have been a Pentecostal preacher.
[1:35:00] What is the problem? [laughter] I'm so
[1:35:03] nervous
[1:35:04] and they say I'm a witch in my church
[1:35:07] and everybody in my church says I'm a
[1:35:08] witch. Now what you you know what every
[1:35:10] Pentecostal preacher does? Satan come
[1:35:14] out of that person for the glory and the
[1:35:16] honor of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:19] The thing is she doesn't have a demon.
[1:35:22] [clears throat] She doesn't have
[1:35:24] there's nothing to cast out because
[1:35:25] she's not demonpossessed.
[1:35:27] She's nervous.
[1:35:29] You understand? But if you think she has
[1:35:31] a demon, she will go back to her place.
[1:35:33] Nothing changed. But now she knows I
[1:35:34] have a demon.
[1:35:36] That will drive her crazy.
[1:35:39] Amen.
[1:35:40] Amen. You see the responsibility even in
[1:35:43] prayer lines. I've seen too much
[1:35:44] nonsense. People I I made one time a
[1:35:48] thing like this. I said, "Marcus, you
[1:35:49] will never do this again. I don't
[1:35:52] believe in in playing church. I mean God
[1:35:55] gives the Holy Ghost even on your seat.
[1:35:57] Whatever we can do prayer lines but not
[1:36:00] trying to discern.
[1:36:02] I mean I mean uh
[1:36:06] I see on this site [snorts]
[1:36:10] marriage problems.
[1:36:13] [laughter] I mean if you have 10
[1:36:14] marriages you have five problems. Huh?
[1:36:19] You understand?
[1:36:21] But here it is. Look. Do you think that
[1:36:24] girl felt directly better? Oh,
[1:36:27] everything. No, no, no. She still had
[1:36:28] the stir in the church. She still had
[1:36:31] that complex. She still But here is the
[1:36:33] prophet of God said everything is right
[1:36:35] with you.
[1:36:37] That would be sufficient for me.
[1:36:39] I feel bad. I feel sick. I feel this.
[1:36:42] But the prophet said everything is okay.
[1:36:44] God will change it in his time. Yeah.
[1:36:47] Do you know what God said when I said
[1:36:49] when we say everything is so bad and
[1:36:52] everything and brother R said quickening
[1:36:53] powers let me see behind the curtain of
[1:36:55] time and I saw all of you there.
[1:36:57] I make it by God's grace.
[1:37:01] Because I believe God more than I
[1:37:02] believe my own feelings.
[1:37:05] You got you get it. But where does do if
[1:37:08] you go home you watch the video again.
[1:37:10] That woman is at the beginning she
[1:37:12] starts but there is a moment when she
[1:37:15] starts crying
[1:37:17] because he said now oh there's there is
[1:37:19] there's a lie I see a black shadow
[1:37:21] following you oh it's it's it's a it's a
[1:37:23] minister who confess uh uh divine
[1:37:25] healing and she starts crying from where
[1:37:27] does brother Brennan pick that thing up
[1:37:30] out of her subconscious takes it and
[1:37:33] when she knows that was deep in my heart
[1:37:37] she knows that is God
[1:37:39] it's air.
[1:37:41] Do you understand why we have to clean
[1:37:43] ourself while we and not only in Germany
[1:37:47] but in New Zealand the same we are so
[1:37:50] easily build up complexes one to
[1:37:52] another.
[1:37:55] It happens to me. It happens to you.
[1:37:58] Let's be honest with that thing.
[1:38:02] Amen.
[1:38:02] You have to doubt your own thoughts,
[1:38:05] your own feelings.
[1:38:07] Amen.
[1:38:08] And then the time comes that that that
[1:38:11] you are only greeting in the church
[1:38:12] those uh with a special relationship.
[1:38:16] All right.
[1:38:16] But that's the wisdom of talking to
[1:38:19] people where you know there is tensions
[1:38:21] between us. Something is not really
[1:38:22] going well
[1:38:24] and you must be spiritual to take that
[1:38:26] over.
[1:38:27] Can you say amen?
[1:38:28] Amen.
[1:38:29] Therefore, whatever is deep in us, I've
[1:38:32] seen people who brought these things
[1:38:36] constantly before the Lord. He said,
[1:38:38] "Heavenly Father, that is really
[1:38:40] bothering us." Oh, they just said,
[1:38:41] "Heavenly Father, something is just
[1:38:44] wrong in me. Is it the genes? Is it is
[1:38:48] it is it my upbringing? Is it my is it a
[1:38:51] trauma? Blood reveal it to me."
[1:38:54] Amen. And sooner or later, these people
[1:38:57] got helped because God loves to heal his
[1:39:01] children.
[1:39:03] For us, healing is always, "Oh, I had a
[1:39:05] broken leg in the Lord." No, healing is
[1:39:07] for the soul more important than for the
[1:39:10] body.
[1:39:12] Because you can only be a happy
[1:39:15] Christian if your if your inner person
[1:39:18] is healed.
[1:39:19] And you can only bring your children to
[1:39:22] a healthy gospel if you live a healthy
[1:39:25] life
[1:39:26] because they watch us. Can you say amen?
[1:39:28] Amen.
[1:39:29] And if we have that kind of things in
[1:39:31] our mind, I mean, don't think of
[1:39:33] marrying. Say first, I want to find
[1:39:36] Christ. I want to find the Lord.
[1:39:38] Next one, please. Okay,
[1:39:40] next one. Here we go. No, back.
[1:39:44] Here we go.
[1:39:47] [laughter]
[1:39:48] New Zealand technique. No, no, no. That
[1:39:49] was There he is. There he is. Here's
[1:39:51] brother Brandon.
[1:39:54] You see one thing and Brother Brandon
[1:39:56] tells a story about his family. He
[1:39:58] doesn't tell these things to entertain
[1:40:00] us. You remember that story? He comes
[1:40:02] from a mission trip and here comes Becky
[1:40:04] and she's faster than her sister and she
[1:40:08] was first coming to daddy and sitting on
[1:40:10] the lap and here comes here comes the
[1:40:12] second one and the older one says Becky
[1:40:15] I want to let you know uh I got daddy
[1:40:17] all for me alone.
[1:40:19] Um and then I think Sarah said Sarah my
[1:40:22] sister want to let you know but but my
[1:40:24] daddy has me all for his own.
[1:40:27] What does brother Ben talk about about
[1:40:29] God?
[1:40:30] [snorts]
[1:40:31] He speaks about relationship of a
[1:40:33] heavenly father with his family.
[1:40:36] That's what I told you this morning. God
[1:40:38] is not interested in in Islamic worship.
[1:40:41] Amen. Father is home. Thank you for the
[1:40:44] money. Maybe we can go to McDonald's.
[1:40:48] God wants your heart.
[1:40:51] God wants your soul.
[1:40:53] God says, "I love you, Lord, and I lift
[1:40:56] my voice
[1:40:57] even if there is no music." Amen.
[1:41:00] So you see how the two girls how they
[1:41:04] were grabbing daddy.
[1:41:06] Poor sister Ma. She's a little bit
[1:41:11] you have to understand one time one
[1:41:13] thing that you you you mothers your
[1:41:15] father one day will love your daughter.
[1:41:20] My wife told me one time in in a in a
[1:41:23] pure way. My wife told me one time
[1:41:26] Marcus because we we're talking my
[1:41:29] daughter and me we're talking spiritual
[1:41:30] things and so forth I want to be a
[1:41:31] friend
[1:41:33] brother if our children becomes our
[1:41:34] friends then we have won something
[1:41:37] okay and man and husband sometime
[1:41:39] husband and wife something a little bit
[1:41:40] common but um and then she says Marcus
[1:41:43] sometime I think you are married to our
[1:41:45] daughter I said yeah me and my daughter
[1:41:48] we have the same genes
[1:41:51] you are a stranger
[1:41:52] [laughter]
[1:42:00] Therefore,
[1:42:01] we have to watch. Therefore, I said what
[1:42:04] I said yesterday. That's the difference
[1:42:06] between the logos, the creation, homoius
[1:42:10] in the first church age. Is Jesus a
[1:42:13] creation or is he birthed?
[1:42:16] Because a creation is a different
[1:42:18] person. Burst means part of me is in her
[1:42:22] and in him.
[1:42:26] It's a strong connection.
[1:42:29] Don't break it.
[1:42:30] All right,
[1:42:31] brother. Your children need you.
[1:42:32] Amen.
[1:42:33] They need you.
[1:42:34] They really need you. They need your
[1:42:36] friendship.
[1:42:37] Yeah.
[1:42:37] Amen. They will not show because we
[1:42:39] never showed it to our parents.
[1:42:41] When we were in the age of the young
[1:42:42] people, we could never speak about sex
[1:42:44] with our parents. It was not possible.
[1:42:46] No way.
[1:42:48] That's true.
[1:42:48] There was no way.
[1:42:50] You see, so we were reading magazines of
[1:42:52] how everything
[1:42:55] we were in the world at that time.
[1:42:57] But I want to say let's be friends to
[1:43:00] our children.
[1:43:02] Hey, how are you doing, my girl? How are
[1:43:03] you doing, my boy? Amen. And let's be
[1:43:06] wise to understand. I mean, every young
[1:43:09] girl wants to know that she's pretty.
[1:43:11] Every girl wants to have a compliment.
[1:43:14] That's normal. You say, "Brother Mark,
[1:43:15] no.
[1:43:17] Only the word. The word. The word. Yeah.
[1:43:20] Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Make an alter call for
[1:43:22] all those who lie. Okay. [laughter]
[1:43:25] Sometimes sometimes you have you have a
[1:43:28] I I'm completely against it. But the
[1:43:29] world is the world and message world is
[1:43:31] message world. They have some kind like
[1:43:33] like platforms to find the boys and the
[1:43:35] girls to marry one another. I'm
[1:43:36] completely against it. But I have to
[1:43:38] keep it like it is. Cannot change the
[1:43:40] world. So a boy presents himself. You
[1:43:42] see? I mean on that picture he has a
[1:43:45] basketball.
[1:43:47] If you ask him what is your hobbies
[1:43:49] praying and reading the message. Yeah.
[1:43:51] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:43:55] We we had one time a sister an older
[1:43:57] sister yet she she just made fun about
[1:43:59] the boy and here was the boy with his
[1:44:01] new car you know hanging a hanger and
[1:44:04] she's right. Oh we have wonderful and
[1:44:05] nice picture and uh really really great
[1:44:08] wanted to get acquainted with you. And
[1:44:10] the boy in his dumbness, [laughter]
[1:44:13] he's writing, "And what did you like
[1:44:15] most on the picture?" And she's writing
[1:44:17] back the car. [laughter]
[1:44:21] So, it's a little bit funny. I'm
[1:44:23] completely against these kind of
[1:44:24] platforms, but things are like they are.
[1:44:27] So, here's the connection. Make the next
[1:44:28] one, please. Amen. Okay.
[1:44:32] Please. It's a church service, but this
[1:44:34] is not a church room. Please just get
[1:44:40] the connection
[1:44:42] between the girl, the boy and their
[1:44:47] father. Please see the reaction and then
[1:44:49] you see how you how much you are
[1:44:51] important and then transform it to God
[1:44:53] and his children. Okay. Next film.
[1:44:57] [music]
[1:45:05] I close [music] my eyes
[1:45:09] and [singing] in the dark
[1:45:12] I try to see his [music] face from
[1:45:16] memories in my heart.
[1:45:20] It's been [music] some time,
[1:45:23] some months or more
[1:45:27] [music] since my father went to fight
[1:45:30] the foreign war. [music]
[1:45:34] And I know he'll be home sooner than
[1:45:38] [music] we thought.
[1:45:42] And I know he'll hold me tighter
[1:45:45] [singing] than before.
[1:45:48] Oh, [music]
[1:45:52] but I'm not sad.
[1:45:54] [music]
[1:45:55] You know I'm proud.
[1:45:59] You'll be home [music] soon to hold me
[1:46:01] tight and hold my hand.
[1:46:06] [music]
[1:46:09] Turn into yours.
[1:46:13] still be [music] waiting for my father
[1:46:16] to return.
[1:46:20] And I [music] know he'll be home soon
[1:46:23] about me.
[1:46:27] And [music] I know you have to fight
[1:46:30] forever.
[1:46:34] And I [music] know you hold me tighter
[1:46:37] than
[1:46:40] [music]
[1:46:43] And I know you hold me tighter
[1:46:47] [music]
[1:46:50] than before.
[1:46:53] Heat. [music]
[1:47:02] [music]
[1:47:06] Heat.
[1:47:10] [music]
[1:47:21] [music]
[1:47:24] And I know
[1:47:29] [music]
[1:47:31] I know we have to fight forever.
[1:47:39] [music]
[1:47:46] [music]
[1:47:47] And I know he'll hold me tighter when
[1:47:51] he's back. He'll [music] hold me
[1:47:53] [singing] tighter than before.
[1:47:57] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:01] Buddy,
[1:48:02] I missed you.
[1:48:03] I miss you.
[1:48:04] I miss you, too. Yeah. Amen. Do you
[1:48:06] understand how we are important are for
[1:48:08] our children?
[1:48:11] Do you know how it's so be important
[1:48:14] that we have the Holy Spirit as parents
[1:48:17] to create that connection to them?
[1:48:19] Hallelujah.
[1:48:20] Because bring that plus the message of
[1:48:22] the hour plus the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:25] Amen. Hallelujah. Make the next one,
[1:48:28] please. Amen. Amen. Here's this. That's
[1:48:31] what Jesus said. Honor thy father and
[1:48:34] mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:48:37] as thyself.
[1:48:40] Brother, if we don't love ourself,
[1:48:43] how we can love our children?
[1:48:47] How we can love our brother?
[1:48:50] Amen. We can scold to them. We can talk
[1:48:52] to them. We can preach to them. We can
[1:48:54] if we don't love ourselves in a biblical
[1:48:58] healthy way,
[1:49:00] we will just bring misery upon our whole
[1:49:03] family.
[1:49:04] That's right.
[1:49:04] Amen. Our preaching is is will be will
[1:49:08] be characterized by this. Our family
[1:49:11] will be characterized by those things.
[1:49:14] And then you can build up a sect of and
[1:49:16] we are this and we are eagles and so
[1:49:17] forth. It's so important God. We don't
[1:49:21] come to church because Sunday morning is
[1:49:23] church time. We come that the Holy
[1:49:26] Spirit makes an operation in our hearts
[1:49:29] because we were all born the wrong way.
[1:49:32] Staying in our own way. Amen. having our
[1:49:35] complexes, having this, but here comes
[1:49:38] God and shows us a vision, changes us.
[1:49:41] Can you say amen?
[1:49:43] Who wants to be changed from from you?
[1:49:45] Amen. Is that so? We all of us want to
[1:49:48] be more like him. Next one. Next one,
[1:49:50] please. Now, here it is. Put on your
[1:49:52] spiritual jacket for people want to
[1:49:55] marry.
[1:49:56] Amen. Don't marry if somebody is not
[1:49:59] spiritually fit. Don't do it. No. He
[1:50:01] said, "We love one another. Forget it."
[1:50:03] Amen. How can you have divine love
[1:50:05] without the Holy Spirit?
[1:50:07] Amen. You have pure felio love and it
[1:50:10] will have an end. It will have its
[1:50:11] limitation.
[1:50:12] Amen.
[1:50:12] Amen. Look, this is Conrad Adnau. That
[1:50:15] is the German chancellor 1955. And these
[1:50:18] are the men
[1:50:20] who came out of Russian prison.
[1:50:24] They were 10 years after the second
[1:50:26] world war in a Russian prison from 45 to
[1:50:29] 55.
[1:50:31] Okay, that means 10 years they didn't
[1:50:34] see a woman.
[1:50:36] 10 years they didn't see one child.
[1:50:40] I mean,
[1:50:42] they were not the same after 10 years in
[1:50:44] a Russian prison. The same personalities
[1:50:47] as they were when they went into that
[1:50:49] prison.
[1:50:50] They became sometime I'm missing a lot
[1:50:52] of word but you understand they became
[1:50:55] beasts
[1:50:56] because that was important to survive in
[1:50:58] a Russian prison.
[1:51:01] If they are fathers and many times they
[1:51:03] were fathers. If the child was one year
[1:51:07] old, now the child is is 10 or 11. When
[1:51:12] the child was five and papa comes home,
[1:51:14] he is 15. [clears throat]
[1:51:17] 15. He was 10 years just among cruel men
[1:51:23] fighting to survive.
[1:51:25] Do you understand that these people have
[1:51:28] to learn to become fathers?
[1:51:32] You have to learn this.
[1:51:34] You cannot come. Here is daddy. No. No.
[1:51:37] Because he's now brainwashed
[1:51:40] for 10 years in a Russian prison. Amen.
[1:51:42] He's a stranger for the children.
[1:51:44] Children have will fear him. His words,
[1:51:46] his ways, his approach to people is
[1:51:49] completely beasty
[1:51:51] because that he was was was bringing up
[1:51:55] a person a father. There is three
[1:51:57] definitions of a father.
[1:52:00] If you have children,
[1:52:02] I agree you are the bi biological
[1:52:04] father.
[1:52:06] That's fine. Then there is what we call
[1:52:08] the guardian. Guardian when it comes to
[1:52:11] the law. That's not always the
[1:52:13] biological father.
[1:52:16] But many times it is like this if you
[1:52:18] don't know your father.
[1:52:19] But the third father is your emotional
[1:52:21] father. That's your true father.
[1:52:24] Amen. That is the one that you call
[1:52:26] daddy.
[1:52:27] That is your true father. That is the
[1:52:30] one where your heart is beating the same
[1:52:33] way.
[1:52:34] Maybe you don't know your biological
[1:52:36] father. I know my biological father but
[1:52:39] he wasn't a father.
[1:52:43] How can you help a next generation if
[1:52:46] you're always chasing your own tail?
[1:52:50] Can you say amen?
[1:52:51] Amen.
[1:52:52] Do you know how how God wants to form
[1:52:56] our character that we're not only
[1:52:59] biological fathers, but that we become
[1:53:02] daddies?
[1:53:04] That we can say, "Honey, I am the
[1:53:07] message of the hour." Amen.
[1:53:09] And that the children will say, I don't
[1:53:11] understand that he often is saying, I
[1:53:13] don't understand the seventh seal, but I
[1:53:15] have a father and I want to become like
[1:53:17] him one day.
[1:53:18] Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] This is more than just I'm in the
[1:53:21] message.
[1:53:23] This is a person who was molded by the
[1:53:25] Holy Spirit.
[1:53:27] This is somebody who works on him with
[1:53:30] the Holy Spirit. [snorts]
[1:53:32] Can you say amen?
[1:53:32] Amen.
[1:53:33] Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] Amen. Because we are entering into that
[1:53:38] dimension. Amen. Hallelujah. This is a
[1:53:41] person who realize I will never be a
[1:53:46] good father if I don't have the right
[1:53:49] picture of God.
[1:53:50] Amen.
[1:53:51] And if I still have that judgmental God
[1:53:53] that we had for 2,000 years, the only
[1:53:56] thing that I know is either you get one
[1:53:59] beatings or you get two beatings.
[1:54:02] Amen. And brother, we have young people
[1:54:04] that I'm dealing with. They tell me
[1:54:07] blunt. They say, "Brother Marcus, we
[1:54:09] were in a sect.
[1:54:11] We were in a cult. We had to do things
[1:54:14] that we didn't want to do. But we were
[1:54:15] forced to come to church, forced to wear
[1:54:18] those dresses, forced to do this. And
[1:54:19] when I was 18, the first thing that I
[1:54:22] did, I went
[1:54:25] and we meant well and we tried to do
[1:54:27] well. And I said yesterday today
[1:54:30] all these people who left us I kept in
[1:54:33] touch with them via WhatsApp
[1:54:35] and I said hey how are you doing and
[1:54:38] they all write me back brother Marcus I
[1:54:40] wasn't in church on Sunday I said I know
[1:54:41] this
[1:54:43] I mean I'm over 50 but at least I know
[1:54:45] who coming or not
[1:54:47] but I want to ask you how are you doing
[1:54:50] the next thing she asks she answers is
[1:54:52] brother Marcus I will come next next
[1:54:54] Sunday it's a lie anyhow
[1:54:57] Amen. Because if somebody says he comes,
[1:54:59] he he he will be there and then sooner
[1:55:02] or later she gets a picture that
[1:55:05] somebody of the church is interested in
[1:55:07] her.
[1:55:09] The thing that I was showing this
[1:55:10] morning is
[1:55:13] a denominational trend is that you're
[1:55:15] only accepted if you're functionally
[1:55:18] working in the local church. And if you
[1:55:21] are a troublemaker or you're not, you
[1:55:23] better go and nobody ask where you are.
[1:55:25] And then we call ourselves family of
[1:55:27] God. Forget it.
[1:55:31] Forget that thing. That is that's a sect
[1:55:33] that has nothing to do. A family of God
[1:55:36] [laughter] says, look, if you come or
[1:55:38] not, we stay together.
[1:55:40] We're friends together.
[1:55:42] Can you say amen? And then you see how
[1:55:44] how how God is not forgetting his
[1:55:46] attributes because brother you know the
[1:55:48] Bible says and the rich and and the and
[1:55:50] the and and the prodigal son what does
[1:55:52] the Bible says he came to himself
[1:55:56] brother if somebody leaves the church we
[1:55:58] should go with him in our prayers and
[1:56:01] never forget that person
[1:56:05] brother and and a young girl he leaves
[1:56:06] the church the first thing that she has
[1:56:08] she will cut her hair
[1:56:10] the next thing she will have sex
[1:56:12] how can you live in this world without
[1:56:14] the Holy Spirit. Forget these things.
[1:56:16] We we have young of these young people
[1:56:19] with blue hair
[1:56:21] and and and and and sometime we we we we
[1:56:24] have people we said oh these people are
[1:56:26] ashamed they were in our Sunday school.
[1:56:29] I said they are not ashamed but if we
[1:56:32] cannot reach out to them then it's a
[1:56:34] shame we are that shame
[1:56:37] because we have the Holy Spirit not
[1:56:38] them. They need a new birth. They are
[1:56:41] just honest with themselves. More not
[1:56:43] more.
[1:56:44] Can you say amen? You see,
[1:56:48] it's not enough to be in the message.
[1:56:49] God wants to mold our character to
[1:56:52] become a mother, to become a father, to
[1:56:54] become a minister, to become a brother.
[1:56:58] Again, I repeat myself. How will we help
[1:57:01] others? If we are always always, how do
[1:57:04] you see if we are so easy easily to be
[1:57:08] how do you call it? uh uh easily hurt.
[1:57:11] All right,
[1:57:12] brother. A person who is easily hurt,
[1:57:14] God cannot help the person.
[1:57:17] Amen.
[1:57:18] Amen.
[1:57:19] Amen.
[1:57:20] So what can be done? A person who is
[1:57:22] easily always offended, always easily
[1:57:25] hurt, you must tell him, hey, there is
[1:57:26] some complex in your heart and I'm not
[1:57:29] helping you by always stretching your
[1:57:31] back. What you need is an operation by
[1:57:33] the Holy Spirit
[1:57:36] that you can get some get get uh receive
[1:57:39] some some beatings and still stand up
[1:57:41] and love a person.
[1:57:44] Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] That that that message changes us to
[1:57:48] sons and daughters of God.
[1:57:51] Hallelujah. Next one please. Can you say
[1:57:53] amen? Now here we go.
[1:57:54] Amen.
[1:57:54] And also
[1:57:57] look at this
[1:58:00] brother. It's in the in the
[1:58:01] subconscious. We speak now about the
[1:58:04] world, but I bring it into the church.
[1:58:07] It's a sick world that we live in.
[1:58:11] So be prepared that the world becomes
[1:58:14] sicker and sicker
[1:58:16] because every generation that now comes
[1:58:18] comes from a sick generation.
[1:58:20] And if there is no Holy Spirit and if
[1:58:22] there's no message and if there's no
[1:58:24] insight, it becomes sicker and sicker.
[1:58:27] And they found out these young people
[1:58:29] they are shooting these brothers and
[1:58:30] sisters in their school. All of them
[1:58:33] they were listening to rock music. All
[1:58:35] of them were playing computer games.
[1:58:38] But not everybody who's listening to
[1:58:40] rock music and playing computer games is
[1:58:42] killing his schoolmates. Not at all. But
[1:58:45] they found out there was a defect
[1:58:49] in their minds, a complex. And the
[1:58:53] moment came where where where the last
[1:58:55] where where there was one drop too much
[1:58:58] and now he takes he he he he tries to
[1:59:01] comfort himself by revenge
[1:59:05] and so he goes to his schooler those who
[1:59:07] humiliated him all the time they just
[1:59:09] killing him.
[1:59:13] Brother and you have to watch this
[1:59:16] because brother Brandham said it like
[1:59:18] this we have responsibility for one
[1:59:20] another.
[1:59:21] Amen. said, "Brother Marcus, these are
[1:59:22] just demons." Yes, they are demons. I
[1:59:24] agree with you. But brother Bram said in
[1:59:26] a message demonology, he said that demon
[1:59:28] needs needs a bruised cell.
[1:59:31] That's right.
[1:59:34] It needs a situation so that the demon
[1:59:36] can now take control of a person.
[1:59:40] And the natural types, the spiritual.
[1:59:43] Amen.
[1:59:43] Amen.
[1:59:44] Hallelujah. And now it enters in and
[1:59:46] fulfilled. And most of these young
[1:59:48] people that are killing others in the
[1:59:50] school, you know what they who they kill
[1:59:51] last themselves.
[1:59:54] It's the same spirits that were in the
[1:59:56] swine who killed themselves is the same
[1:59:59] that are living today.
[2:00:02] Brother Brand was asked a question. We
[2:00:05] had a a a journalist
[2:00:09] who was a wise girl. She wrote about
[2:00:11] about a German school massacre of 16
[2:00:13] young people who killed who were killed.
[2:00:16] And she said there were not 16 victims,
[2:00:19] there were 17 victims because the murder
[2:00:21] himself killed himself later. He said
[2:00:24] not 16 mas lost their boys but 17.
[2:00:28] Yeah.
[2:00:28] The murderer was a victim himself.
[2:00:32] You understand that?
[2:00:33] So a person leaves the church. I'm not a
[2:00:36] and my whole family and we're doing this
[2:00:38] and he builds up his anger, his pride,
[2:00:40] whatever. He doesn't know what he does.
[2:00:46] I've seen many people leaving the church
[2:00:48] but always I have seen they do not they
[2:00:51] do not improve spiritually by staying
[2:00:53] home.
[2:00:54] They do not improve it and they say they
[2:00:57] heard it so much my feeling in the
[2:00:59] church so I stay home. Yes, but that
[2:01:03] doesn't change the problem
[2:01:05] because the problem is in us
[2:01:08] and if I'm staying home I'm staying home
[2:01:10] with my own problem. I whatever happens
[2:01:13] to my life I have to come in the
[2:01:15] presence of God is that heavenly father
[2:01:16] they hurt heard it so much my feeling
[2:01:18] but I need something to override that
[2:01:20] thing
[2:01:23] but the human reaction is you can do you
[2:01:27] can stay home you can blow and this and
[2:01:29] this but if you have children brother
[2:01:31] you stay with those children
[2:01:33] yes my lord
[2:01:34] amen can you say amen you must give them
[2:01:37] a vision
[2:01:38] don't bring your complex upon your own
[2:01:41] children.
[2:01:42] We don't go because this and because no,
[2:01:45] let's say we go into the house of the
[2:01:47] Lord,
[2:01:49] brother. It's it's a thing for our
[2:01:51] generation of life and death.
[2:01:54] Church is not a playground. Church is
[2:01:56] life and death.
[2:01:58] Honestly,
[2:02:00] those who missed the rapture, they will
[2:02:02] go into the great tribulation.
[2:02:04] Brother Brham said, and and the
[2:02:06] Holocaust was just a pre-tribulation.
[2:02:08] That's what he says. Look why it is so
[2:02:10] important. Can you say amen?
[2:02:12] Amen.
[2:02:12] Amen.
[2:02:13] Spiritual healing Lord. Clean my heart.
[2:02:16] Clean my mind. Clean my subcon. Clean
[2:02:18] everything.
[2:02:19] Amen. Make me make me make me like you,
[2:02:22] father.
[2:02:25] You say what was the greatest thing in
[2:02:27] Jesus? The miracles. No, the greatest
[2:02:30] thing is when we at the cross, he said,
[2:02:32] "Father, forgive them."
[2:02:34] That is where God brings us to.
[2:02:37] Forgive my brother. Forgive my sister.
[2:02:40] [applause]
[2:02:40] Hallelujah.
[2:02:42] Look at this. You put on the spiritual
[2:02:44] jacket.
[2:02:45] Give Give me just a minute. So to
[2:02:47] because I I feel that's so important,
[2:02:49] man.
[2:02:50] So important, man. We must be changed by
[2:02:53] the renewing of our mind. That's what
[2:02:54] Paul says. Really changed.
[2:02:57] Amen. Here is here's Golden Gate Bridge.
[2:03:01] And maybe I'm talking to I I I brother,
[2:03:03] I speak to young people who try to take
[2:03:05] her life, their life. They are back in
[2:03:07] track. I there was one case where I was
[2:03:09] actually there. God led me the right
[2:03:11] moment there. front of our youngsters
[2:03:13] now back in the church now song leading
[2:03:18] brother we are not talking about so this
[2:03:20] is in in the message don't be naive
[2:03:22] these things come it's spirits at all
[2:03:24] around
[2:03:26] I told some of our parents I said okay
[2:03:28] you mourn about your young people in the
[2:03:30] world how much time do you come together
[2:03:32] to pray for these youngsters
[2:03:34] and ask God for for grace to bring them
[2:03:37] back
[2:03:38] but sometime we're a little bit lazy
[2:03:39] about that
[2:03:40] a little bit too much comfort
[2:03:41] comfortable.
[2:03:42] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Look,
[2:03:45] here is Golden Gate Bridge. I'm I'm a
[2:03:47] little bit Can you say amen?
[2:03:50] Talking to myself. Okay. Amen.
[2:03:52] Preach it. Don't teach it, man. Yes.
[2:03:55] Because man, we have children. I have a
[2:03:57] daughter. I want to see her on the other
[2:03:58] side. Want to see her there.
[2:04:02] Whatever it costs, I am her intercessor.
[2:04:06] Amen. I am that Abraham. And brother Ram
[2:04:08] said when when when when when God came
[2:04:10] to to to to to Sodom [laughter]
[2:04:14] and and and and and and and that city
[2:04:16] had to be destroyed, brother Ram said,
[2:04:17] the Bible says God remembered Abraham,
[2:04:20] not Lot. Lot was just some but the
[2:04:23] prayers of Abraham were the intercessor
[2:04:25] for Lot.
[2:04:27] Hallelujah.
[2:04:27] Therefore, the bride is an intercessor.
[2:04:29] Sorry for this.
[2:04:31] Look, this is Golden Gate Bridge. This
[2:04:33] is pure statistic.
[2:04:36] Glory.
[2:04:36] In all these years, 2,000 people, I know
[2:04:40] from the 60s to 2,000 people were were
[2:04:43] killing themselves, jumping from that
[2:04:45] bridge. 2,000.
[2:04:47] I don't know from the 70s up to just a
[2:04:49] number
[2:04:53] 10%
[2:04:55] official statistic of the US survived
[2:05:00] or 1% sorry 1% survived.
[2:05:05] 20 people out of 2,000 survived.
[2:05:08] All of them, all gave the same
[2:05:11] testimony. All of them.
[2:05:14] They said, "We heard a voice
[2:05:16] which says you just jump up. You jump
[2:05:19] and you will land in a nice country. All
[2:05:21] your problems will be solved. All your
[2:05:24] problems will be away." And all of them
[2:05:26] said, "When we left that bridge, we knew
[2:05:28] it was a mistake."
[2:05:30] But it was too late.
[2:05:33] Hallelujah. Brother, do you hear
[2:05:35] sometimes do you have sometimes
[2:05:37] thoughts?
[2:05:40] I have them. You have them. You must
[2:05:42] understand is nothing else and nothing
[2:05:44] at psychological warfare
[2:05:47] and you just bring it before the Lord.
[2:05:49] And what the young people think you call
[2:05:50] upon the name of the Lord.
[2:05:55] Don't question yourself if you have
[2:05:56] these thoughts. Question those thoughts.
[2:06:00] That's the difference.
[2:06:03] First, don't question yourself. Then
[2:06:04] Satan one question these thoughts and
[2:06:06] said that's are not my thoughts.
[2:06:08] Satan, you can get them back.
[2:06:11] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:06:12] Hallelujah.
[2:06:13] Next one, please. I'm I'm going now.
[2:06:15] Here's brother Ren. Same thing. Amen.
[2:06:18] He's a He's a small man. I'm not
[2:06:20] answering too much.
[2:06:21] Yeah.
[2:06:22] God God brought us in a body that we
[2:06:25] don't like.
[2:06:26] And God allowed that. Brother Ben was an
[2:06:28] extreme small man. And you understand
[2:06:30] when he stands beside Aurora Roberts,
[2:06:33] brother Brandon stand on his toes.
[2:06:36] You see the picture?
[2:06:39] He's aware that he's extremely small.
[2:06:40] Brother Brandham
[2:06:43] passes by Oral Roberts University.
[2:06:47] And here comes some thoughts.
[2:06:51] If he got those thoughts, you get those
[2:06:53] thoughts. Be sure.
[2:06:54] And I get the same thoughts. But we
[2:06:56] learned that spiritual warfare.
[2:06:58] Hallelujah.
[2:06:59] Because we're a little bit older now to
[2:07:01] to learn spiritual warfare. And he and
[2:07:03] he thinks about look this is Ara
[2:07:05] Robert's entrance. And then he hears
[2:07:08] some some some thought which says yes uh
[2:07:11] this is he has 200 secretaries and you
[2:07:15] have only one typewriter. And brothers
[2:07:17] he start he said I was starting to cry.
[2:07:21] He was still under denominational
[2:07:23] thinking. Yes.
[2:07:24] What I was preaching this morning, big
[2:07:25] church, big favor.
[2:07:27] Small church, please pastor, have a
[2:07:29] complex
[2:07:31] because God couldn't give you much
[2:07:33] people. You must have a be very very
[2:07:35] humble because you just have 20 people.
[2:07:36] No, no, no. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:39] Pure denominational thinking.
[2:07:42] Amen.
[2:07:43] So, so, so Danny has a thought
[2:07:47] that says, "Yes, God couldn't trust your
[2:07:49] money, brother. The message that we
[2:07:53] believe [snorts] there are seven
[2:07:54] messengers. Two were special. Paul could
[2:07:59] write the Bible.
[2:08:00] He was the one laying a foundation as a
[2:08:03] wise master builder.
[2:08:04] Amen.
[2:08:05] Brother Brandon was the one bringing the
[2:08:07] capstone upon the whole building.
[2:08:09] Different ministry.
[2:08:10] Amen.
[2:08:11] None of them had the capacity like
[2:08:14] William Brandon.
[2:08:15] Yes. Amen. None of the me seven
[2:08:17] messengers could go into a room and
[2:08:19] says, "I now take everything under under
[2:08:21] my control for the glory and the honor
[2:08:22] of God." None of them had a third pull.
[2:08:26] None of all the prophets in the Old
[2:08:27] Testament could look farther than
[2:08:29] William Brandham. Before the logos, he
[2:08:32] could see these things. But in that
[2:08:34] moment, he watched that nonsense. And if
[2:08:37] we start crying, he said, "Yes, God
[2:08:39] really couldn't trust me money. God
[2:08:41] could trust him more than than anybody
[2:08:43] else in this world." But he builds up a
[2:08:45] complex. God cannot trust with money.
[2:08:47] And it's the moment when God speaks to
[2:08:49] him. He said, "Look up." You
[2:08:52] therefore we go to church. Look up.
[2:08:56] Look up.
[2:08:57] I am your portion.
[2:09:00] Here we go.
[2:09:01] Brothers, sisters. Sometime even we are
[2:09:03] a little bit in a fog.
[2:09:04] Yes sir.
[2:09:05] Sometime we a little bit foggy. You and
[2:09:07] me. And then God says, "Look up, boy.
[2:09:10] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:09:13] Hallelujah.
[2:09:14] Amen. Here we go. Amen. Make the next
[2:09:17] one. Amen. Amen. Amen. Make the next
[2:09:20] one. Come on. If not, Amen. Here. Here
[2:09:22] it is. I mean, go back. [laughter]
[2:09:26] Marilyn Monroe. I told you she became a
[2:09:28] Jew. I'm a Jewish religion. Is not an
[2:09:31] evangelistical religion, but you can
[2:09:32] become a Jew. Here's what brother said.
[2:09:35] I read of her life story in the
[2:09:37] magazine. She was an illegitimate child
[2:09:40] and how that she had washed so many
[2:09:42] dishes and her mother in the insane
[2:09:44] institution and she had longed she was
[2:09:47] the most perfectbodied woman I guess in
[2:09:49] the world but she had longed for
[2:09:51] something that money wouldn't buy.
[2:09:53] Sisters you must understand if that body
[2:09:57] didn't make Marilyn Monroe happy then
[2:10:00] makeup will not make you happy neither.
[2:10:03] You must find your joy in Christ.
[2:10:07] It's not legalism, it's revelation.
[2:10:12] Amen. Maybe members of the churches of
[2:10:15] fame, famous famous Hollywood where all
[2:10:18] the decoration and tins is on. They seen
[2:10:21] all but seen those people. She could see
[2:10:24] they lived no different life than what
[2:10:26] she did. It takes influence. It takes
[2:10:30] the power of the resurrection of Christ
[2:10:32] among these people that they see that
[2:10:34] Christ is not a statue hanging a
[2:10:36] building but he's a living being in the
[2:10:38] form of a Holy Spirit living in man and
[2:10:40] women bringing peace contentment and
[2:10:43] happiness. Oh, if we could only get to
[2:10:46] that young lady before she left the
[2:10:49] world.
[2:10:50] And brother here you are
[2:10:52] and God says I can get can can come to
[2:10:54] you.
[2:10:56] Do you understand? We as parents, we as
[2:10:59] olders, brother, the young people, they
[2:11:01] are observing us.
[2:11:03] They are I tell you, I'm a I'm a
[2:11:05] minister. I take care of people. I'm not
[2:11:06] a pastor, but sometimes you can call an
[2:11:08] associate pastor, but I'm not have that
[2:11:10] official thing. Okay? I'm more of an
[2:11:12] evangelist taking care of a lot of
[2:11:14] people, brother. [snorts] I'm not I'm
[2:11:16] not sharing nothing with my wife.
[2:11:20] Amen. Because I don't believe that a
[2:11:22] minister should share all things with
[2:11:24] his wife.
[2:11:25] No, it's not right. because I'm built to
[2:11:27] bear that burden. She's not built for
[2:11:30] that. And I've seen how ministries were
[2:11:32] destroyed when the church knows that you
[2:11:34] tell something confidentially to a
[2:11:36] pastor and he tells his wife that that
[2:11:38] pastor is over.
[2:11:39] Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] If the church get knows that, Amen. then
[2:11:43] the confidence is away.
[2:11:46] Definitely. So, and even my wife is not
[2:11:48] sharing certain things with me. If a
[2:11:50] sister says, "I want to talk with you
[2:11:52] about this." And she will not, she will
[2:11:53] tell me, "Talk about the weather." And I
[2:11:55] know that's not for me. That's fine.
[2:11:57] Huh? I will not share critical things
[2:12:00] with my daughter. She's not 19 years
[2:12:02] old. But brother, these youngsters today
[2:12:05] are not as naive as we were when we were
[2:12:07] 19. They can even read body languages in
[2:12:10] the church. They pick up where tensions
[2:12:13] are.
[2:12:15] We cannot tell them no story. They are
[2:12:17] professionals.
[2:12:19] Hallelujah. Praise you, brother.
[2:12:21] We cannot play theater before them. They
[2:12:23] pick these things up. That is genuine
[2:12:25] and that not. And praise God for it.
[2:12:29] Because it puts me on the spot to be as
[2:12:31] transparent as I could be.
[2:12:35] And even tell your child and even ask
[2:12:37] for forgiveness. Say, "Honey, papa was
[2:12:39] just nervous. Forgive me. Papa has no
[2:12:41] problem. I've forgiven." [laughter]
[2:12:43] You understand? But we were naive at
[2:12:46] that time. But this generation is not
[2:12:47] naive anymore.
[2:12:49] They can pick these things up.
[2:12:51] Amen. So, so how we talk another about
[2:12:54] another group,
[2:12:55] another church.
[2:12:58] Hallelujah,
[2:13:01] brother. I tell you,
[2:13:03] whatever you do, respect people.
[2:13:07] Thank you, my Lord.
[2:13:08] Hallelujah.
[2:13:08] I see people you can we can disagree.
[2:13:10] Let me say for example about the
[2:13:11] Brandham family or about voice of God.
[2:13:14] We can disagree. Not a problem. But
[2:13:17] never preach against death. Never do
[2:13:19] that
[2:13:20] because it's still the family of the
[2:13:21] prophet. Leave them in God's hands
[2:13:24] and says leave it up to them because the
[2:13:26] more you attack them, the more you
[2:13:28] attack yourself
[2:13:30] because the people would say okay there
[2:13:32] is no respect in that thing.
[2:13:34] Leave things in the message like they we
[2:13:36] don't have to give a command about
[2:13:37] everything.
[2:13:38] If somebody ask we can say this is my
[2:13:40] good brother is a wonderful family but
[2:13:42] we disagree in this and this. That's
[2:13:44] okay. But not that kind of declaring war
[2:13:48] because you saw a storm. You saw a wind,
[2:13:51] I tell you. And you will reap a storm
[2:13:53] in your own family, in your own church.
[2:13:56] Can you say amen?
[2:13:57] Next one, please. Amen. Here we go.
[2:13:59] Amen. Amen. Give me some minutes.
[2:14:01] Hallelujah.
[2:14:01] But there is a change.
[2:14:04] There is a solution.
[2:14:08] There is a way.
[2:14:10] Amen. You say, brother Marcus, what is
[2:14:12] the way? Jesus is the way. He said, "I
[2:14:15] am the way, the truth, and the life."
[2:14:19] And he is specialist for your situation.
[2:14:23] He is the great navigation system.
[2:14:25] Bringing you back home because there's a
[2:14:27] theophony already waiting for you.
[2:14:30] There's already something of eternity
[2:14:31] right in your heart which brings you
[2:14:33] home.
[2:14:34] You pay for your own mistakes. Be sure
[2:14:39] sometimes the navigation system says new
[2:14:43] calculation
[2:14:45] because by our own mistakes we have to
[2:14:47] make some detours.
[2:14:49] But you come, you arrive at the right
[2:14:52] thing. Because why? The Bible says this.
[2:14:55] For behold, the day cometh that shall
[2:14:57] burn as no shall all the proud. Yeah.
[2:14:59] All that do wickedly shall be stubbled.
[2:15:01] And the day that cometh shall be burned.
[2:15:03] Damn up, said the Lord of host, that he
[2:15:06] shall leave them neither root nor
[2:15:07] branch. But unto you that fear my name
[2:15:10] shall the son of righteousness arise
[2:15:13] with healing
[2:15:15] under his wings.
[2:15:19] Thank you Lord.
[2:15:19] That is what we were showing brother
[2:15:22] Brandham in Laa. He is a star in the
[2:15:25] night.
[2:15:27] But he preaches 1964. Shalom. Sorry.
[2:15:30] Shalom.
[2:15:32] Good morning church.
[2:15:33] What does it mean? The night is over.
[2:15:36] The day arrive.
[2:15:38] Shalom. Good morning. Who rises up? The
[2:15:41] son of righteousness.
[2:15:46] What does it bring? knowledge quotes.
[2:15:49] Amen. Pictures of a cloud. Amen. No
[2:15:53] healing.
[2:15:55] But healing different than we had it in
[2:15:58] the past.
[2:16:00] Another form of healing.
[2:16:02] Much deeper, much better, much greater,
[2:16:06] but it doesn't fit in any denominational
[2:16:08] program anymore. It's God. The sun rises
[2:16:11] and calls the water up.
[2:16:14] God in silence does great things. It's
[2:16:17] not a public show. It's not anymore we
[2:16:19] have to invite brother so and so and he
[2:16:21] lays hands and he he he he and the all
[2:16:23] the problems will be solved. God is
[2:16:25] dealing with his family right now.
[2:16:28] And your own pastor has the same
[2:16:30] capacity.
[2:16:32] Your own father in the house has the
[2:16:34] same capacity.
[2:16:36] You itself have the capacity to to to
[2:16:39] call that healing out of you.
[2:16:42] Amen.
[2:16:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:16:45] Brother, I made that same
[2:16:47] that same experience.
[2:16:49] Let me share that with you. I know I'm
[2:16:50] I'm a little bit over. Give me some. Is
[2:16:52] that fine for you?
[2:16:53] Because we will maybe not have another
[2:16:55] possibility in in that way.
[2:16:58] Every psychologist said this. I I I I
[2:17:00] went into a into a uh hospital because I
[2:17:04] had a slip disc. So, I had to make some
[2:17:07] kind of uh senatorium. And they said,
[2:17:10] "Do you want to have a talk with a
[2:17:12] psychologist?" I said, "Yes. I was
[2:17:15] interested. I'm not not for me. I'm in
[2:17:17] good shape. Honestly, I'm in. But I
[2:17:20] would So I asked that that psychologist,
[2:17:23] how do you help people? And she said,
[2:17:26] "Mr. Becker, there is two different
[2:17:29] problems. No neurosis and u no and
[2:17:33] forget the second one. One is to be
[2:17:35] treated with medicine." Okay. Others is
[2:17:39] just to be treated with talking.
[2:17:41] All right.
[2:17:42] And this great success. And she said to
[2:17:44] me this, "Mr. Becca, many times I talk
[2:17:48] with somebody at the phone who has
[2:17:51] mental problems, mental illness, and we
[2:17:55] are talking on the phone." And you have
[2:17:57] to understand that the solution in a
[2:18:00] person's life lays right in him.
[2:18:04] As long as it's not a problem in his
[2:18:06] chemical base or whatever way she needs
[2:18:08] medicine, but normally the problem lays
[2:18:10] in him. And I made exactly on the point
[2:18:14] exactly the same experience. She said
[2:18:16] I'm talking and now I was a person. I
[2:18:19] was talking 10 words. The rest just a
[2:18:22] person was talking bringing out from the
[2:18:26] inside what lays to the surface. And
[2:18:28] then the person says to me, "Oh, I'm so
[2:18:30] thankful for the conversation. You
[2:18:32] really helped me." In reality that
[2:18:34] person helped himself
[2:18:37] but we were the person giving him the
[2:18:39] room to express himself.
[2:18:42] Rather I had a boy who tried to commit
[2:18:44] suicide and he sp he spoke about his
[2:18:47] family his religious family. It was like
[2:18:49] a it was like a tape that went over and
[2:18:52] over for an hour was listening an hour
[2:18:54] listening next day an hour for for
[2:18:56] months and months. And he called me
[2:18:59] again. He said, "Brother Marcus would
[2:19:01] like to call talk to you." I said, "I
[2:19:03] had such a difficult use and I thought
[2:19:05] by myself, okay, now the tape starts."
[2:19:07] And then he said this, "But brother
[2:19:09] Marcus, I have to change my future by
[2:19:11] God's help."
[2:19:12] And I knew now the healing process
[2:19:15] starts
[2:19:17] supernaturally.
[2:19:19] That same boy is a song leader right now
[2:19:21] for me.
[2:19:22] Brother, we need to have patience with
[2:19:24] people. I would be happy if New Zealand
[2:19:27] sends somebody who lays hands and these
[2:19:29] problems are solved. But these are
[2:19:31] problems that lay deep in the soul of a
[2:19:34] person
[2:19:35] and it takes some time, a process. It
[2:19:37] takes time,
[2:19:39] brother. And therefore, a church is a
[2:19:41] family. A church is a hospital. A church
[2:19:44] is a place where the Holy Spirit should
[2:19:47] be so present that a person who is so
[2:19:51] much
[2:19:53] loaded or uh such a bloat in his mind
[2:19:56] that he just sits down. He said I don't
[2:19:59] know what it is but I feel somehow good
[2:20:01] that is already wonderful.
[2:20:04] Hallelujah. Next one please. Amen. Why
[2:20:07] is it so important? Okay, go back. Go
[2:20:09] back. I'm I'm I'm I'm hurrying through.
[2:20:11] Here it is.
[2:20:12] The sun goes up.
[2:20:15] Amen. And healing under his his wings.
[2:20:19] Now you take that story of Jacob.
[2:20:24] Jacob in the night wrestled with the
[2:20:26] angel.
[2:20:29] And when the morning came, when the sun
[2:20:32] came,
[2:20:34] that angel changed his name.
[2:20:37] Not in the night, but when the sun came
[2:20:39] up. Right.
[2:20:42] And brother Brmond said, "The name is
[2:20:44] the nature that we have."
[2:20:47] Brother, that message, the opening of
[2:20:49] the word, if you once know who you are
[2:20:51] really, and brother Brmond said it like
[2:20:54] this, if you want to be healed, you must
[2:20:56] see a healed man right before you. And
[2:20:59] you are walking yourself into that
[2:21:01] healed man. And the last step is that is
[2:21:04] exactly what you are.
[2:21:05] That is the that is the rapture for us.
[2:21:08] So the name was changed from Jacob to
[2:21:11] Israel.
[2:21:12] Yeah.
[2:21:13] When the sun came up,
[2:21:17] you put on now your spiritual jacket.
[2:21:19] All right.
[2:21:20] We must be so honest in God's in God's
[2:21:25] presence.
[2:21:26] You don't have to call your problems
[2:21:28] loud out. I will not call my complexes
[2:21:31] loud out,
[2:21:32] but you have to talk with your father.
[2:21:35] You have to make business. said, "Lord,
[2:21:37] that's me." Because now you put on your
[2:21:40] spiritual jacket.
[2:21:41] Amen. The angel when he was wrestling
[2:21:44] with Jacob did not ask, "In which church
[2:21:47] do you go?"
[2:21:51] Which message do you believe? Amen. Um,
[2:21:54] do you love Brother Brham? The angel
[2:21:57] asked, "What is your name?"
[2:21:59] Amen.
[2:22:00] In other words, who are you really?
[2:22:03] And then a person must be in the
[2:22:04] presence of God. said, "Heavenly Father,
[2:22:06] I'm a man full of envy.
[2:22:08] That's me. I'm standing in my own way,
[2:22:10] but I don't want to have it. That's not
[2:22:12] me.
[2:22:13] But I got it with all these complexes."
[2:22:15] And God says, "Okay."
[2:22:17] Amen.
[2:22:17] And you wrestled so long
[2:22:20] until you get a new name.
[2:22:23] Hallelujah.
[2:22:25] Brother said, "Brother Marcus, did you
[2:22:28] wrestle it out?" I'm still wrestling.
[2:22:32] But I see in my own life there's a
[2:22:34] changing.
[2:22:36] See it and you see it for yourself.
[2:22:39] I say amen.
[2:22:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:22:44] Therefore, please I know I'm repeating
[2:22:47] myself. You just translate it into your
[2:22:49] own language. You cannot sit and make a
[2:22:52] little bit screaming to the US and say,
[2:22:54] "Oh, tremendous, man. Tremendous." That
[2:22:56] will not change you, man.
[2:22:59] will not change you.
[2:23:02] You can do it, but it's just
[2:23:03] entertainment. Don't forget it.
[2:23:05] You must come in the presence of God and
[2:23:08] Lord change me.
[2:23:09] Do something for my heart.
[2:23:13] Hallelujah.
[2:23:15] [applause]
[2:23:16] You say and therefore that message came
[2:23:18] to reveal our true identity so that we
[2:23:21] can say that's not me.
[2:23:24] I'm a wonderful man on the outside. The
[2:23:27] the man who stands in his own way is
[2:23:28] just the outside man. But by the grace
[2:23:31] of God, we will kill that beast.
[2:23:34] That mammal, we will kill him.
[2:23:37] Amen. So, we have a nice message for
[2:23:38] you. We kill you, man. I'm going hang
[2:23:40] you up, destroy you. And I'm because
[2:23:43] inside is the true being who you are
[2:23:45] really,
[2:23:47] [cheering]
[2:23:47] brother. But that's a fight. That's a
[2:23:50] fight. That is not ignoring. That's not
[2:23:53] out. You know, I'm 20 years in the
[2:23:54] message. That is nothing. How much were
[2:23:57] were you already transformed?
[2:24:04] Did you become old in the message or did
[2:24:07] you become wise in the message? That's
[2:24:09] the difference.
[2:24:13] Hallelujah. And you can only help your
[2:24:15] children if we change ourselves.
[2:24:19] And speak to your youngsters. They said,
[2:24:20] "Hey boy, I tell you one thing. You have
[2:24:23] my jeans. You know I love you, but I was
[2:24:25] always a man standing in my own way.
[2:24:27] Pray for me. I pray for you. Because our
[2:24:31] children are our brothers and sisters in
[2:24:33] reality.
[2:24:34] Speak with them. Be honest with them.
[2:24:36] Make the next one. I'm hurrying through.
[2:24:38] Amen. Here. I'm opening the seat. Now
[2:24:42] there is another one greater far greater
[2:24:44] than all the rest of them put together
[2:24:46] already confirmed and ready. I hope pull
[2:24:50] I hope it happens tonight. I just might
[2:24:52] say that I don't have the time to
[2:24:54] explain to you but the brethren who know
[2:24:57] does know know about it's wonderful it
[2:24:59] be it would be such a great thing for
[2:25:01] the people I'm grateful to God that the
[2:25:04] hour is soon at hand when God is going
[2:25:07] to help his children
[2:25:10] especially it will be for those who
[2:25:13] can't master the faith to raise up and
[2:25:15] get a hold of God like they should do. I
[2:25:18] believe the Lord is providing a way for
[2:25:20] us now to take care of them also. Some
[2:25:24] runs into faith that they can just reach
[2:25:26] over and receive anything. Why? That's
[2:25:28] great faith. Some of them has mustard
[2:25:31] seed faith and has to wait so long to
[2:25:34] get through.
[2:25:36] I believe the Lord is making a way for
[2:25:38] these people now. And I don't know when
[2:25:41] it will be, but it will be just as
[2:25:43] certain as I'm standing.
[2:25:48] Do you understand that with all kind of
[2:25:50] prayer lines you must be very wise
[2:25:52] because if somebody needs a lot of time
[2:25:54] you will frustrate that person.
[2:25:58] Some people have express faith but if
[2:26:01] it's not your time you can come in all
[2:26:04] kind of prayer line but you must
[2:26:06] understand God's mechanic. You must it
[2:26:08] will come in his time.
[2:26:11] Can you say amen?
[2:26:12] Amen.
[2:26:14] Amen. That's therefore you see the
[2:26:16] nature of God.
[2:26:17] The rapture is not God sitting up and
[2:26:20] look we will see from New Zealand.
[2:26:24] Maybe
[2:26:26] God takes his children home.
[2:26:29] Amen. Next one please. I'm I'm I'm
[2:26:30] hering. Amen. Amen. Here's the man.
[2:26:33] Amen. Last two. I think I think it's two
[2:26:36] and then we're going. Yeah. Here we go.
[2:26:39] Now put on the spiritual jacket. Last
[2:26:41] one.
[2:26:42] Spiritual healing and spiritual growth
[2:26:46] go along side by side.
[2:26:49] Amen. And you put again the spiritual
[2:26:52] jacket.
[2:26:53] I don't question your new birth
[2:26:56] and my new birth, but that's not the end
[2:26:59] of our journey.
[2:27:02] That's the beginning of our journey.
[2:27:06] And there is a process. And no moving of
[2:27:09] the Holy Spirit will take away that
[2:27:11] process.
[2:27:12] That's what we were hearing this
[2:27:13] morning.
[2:27:14] Um, it's not the anointing on the
[2:27:16] outside. It must be the words on the
[2:27:18] inside that's shining through us.
[2:27:21] Therefore, we are not Pentecostals
[2:27:23] anymore. But we need the Holy Spirit.
[2:27:25] Definitely. So, look,
[2:27:28] put on a spiritual jacket. Can you say
[2:27:30] amen?
[2:27:30] Amen.
[2:27:31] Really, last point. Amen.
[2:27:34] Huh?
[2:27:35] We know that Elijah
[2:27:38] was the prophet and Elisha
[2:27:42] was his follower.
[2:27:44] We can see the picture, but this is just
[2:27:47] Marcus. I don't know if brother Brandham
[2:27:48] says it that way, but it's Marcus. But
[2:27:51] Elijah is the prophet in Elijah. Elisha
[2:27:54] typing the bride because she is doing
[2:27:58] the double portion. She has to prophesy
[2:28:00] again. That's Marcus. If there is a
[2:28:02] quote, send it over to me. I don't have
[2:28:03] it but I let me see that picture. Okay.
[2:28:07] Now, here comes Elijah and he calls
[2:28:10] Elisha.
[2:28:13] He has a calling. That's true. But
[2:28:16] brother Bram said it took 10 years
[2:28:20] to change Elisha
[2:28:24] to fit the mantle of Elijah.
[2:28:27] Hallelujah.
[2:28:28] Got it.
[2:28:30] Got it. We're the bride. We're William
[2:28:32] Brennan. We speak he's the wish she yes
[2:28:34] we talk like brother Brandham but God
[2:28:37] wants to see the same character in us
[2:28:40] the same formation the same graduation
[2:28:45] and then brother Brandham said this when
[2:28:47] it came to that mantle and we will take
[2:28:49] that mantle and some of us take it today
[2:28:51] already we take the mantle of William
[2:28:53] Brennham it's not a question at all he
[2:28:55] was just a we shave the the the the the
[2:28:58] sheave wave amen
[2:29:01] we We'll take it. We take it maybe today
[2:29:04] already. But brother Remy said this, God
[2:29:07] never changed the mantle to fit Elijah.
[2:29:12] God changed Elisha
[2:29:14] to fit into that mantle.
[2:29:18] We want to do the miracles of William
[2:29:19] Brennan. Brother God says wonderful, but
[2:29:21] you are fitting now into the caliber of
[2:29:23] that man.
[2:29:24] And I will and I will I will form you. I
[2:29:28] will transform you. I will mold you. I
[2:29:30] will do something with you.
[2:29:33] Amen. So that I can trust you. That
[2:29:35] sword in your own hands.
[2:29:38] Can you say amen? Here's brother
[2:29:40] Brenham. Amen. I let standing in the gap
[2:29:43] a man who was born again when he was 20.
[2:29:46] Twice he wanted to take his life
[2:29:48] with the Holy Spirit.
[2:29:50] Amen. The seals are open and he is
[2:29:53] building up a complex.
[2:29:55] That's right.
[2:29:56] He said, "I let the sick lay. I want the
[2:29:58] Lord to tell me where to go and not.
[2:30:00] That is wrong. I built myself a complex.
[2:30:02] A man full of the Holy Ghost and says I
[2:30:05] have a complex. Uh-huh.
[2:30:08] Psychology. If you want to call it
[2:30:10] psychology, then it's psychology. But
[2:30:12] that's life.
[2:30:14] Because the people didn't hear my
[2:30:16] message. And if you and God forbid that
[2:30:19] I have tried to compare my life now with
[2:30:22] Moses, but exactly what Moses did, the
[2:30:25] people wouldn't listen to him when he
[2:30:26] come to deliver them. So he just left
[2:30:28] them alone, went into the wilderness.
[2:30:30] And here we have the prophet Elijah
[2:30:32] again. Here we have the people leaving
[2:30:34] the church. They don't like me. They
[2:30:36] don't like my ministry and and and just
[2:30:38] stay home. The same response
[2:30:42] went into the wilderness. But God turned
[2:30:44] him around and he went long. Forget to
[2:30:46] the suffering people.
[2:30:49] There's two things to kill a man. Not
[2:30:51] only a minister. Too much applause is
[2:30:54] not helpful. Too much applause is not
[2:30:57] helpful. Never.
[2:30:58] Amen. But too much criticism is not
[2:31:01] helpful neither.
[2:31:03] Amen. We have a slogan for the children.
[2:31:05] If you criticize them once, you have to
[2:31:08] give them a little compliment 10 times.
[2:31:10] 10 times a compliment, once a criticism.
[2:31:12] That's for the pastor the same way.
[2:31:17] Amen.
[2:31:18] Just let him know
[2:31:20] that you love the man.
[2:31:22] Amen.
[2:31:22] I know it's a it's a mixed audience.
[2:31:24] Just let him know we see your labor.
[2:31:27] We have a slogan in Germany which says
[2:31:30] one mother can take care of 10 children
[2:31:34] but 10 children cannot take care of one
[2:31:36] mother.
[2:31:38] Emotionally she takes care of 10
[2:31:40] children but all these 10 children will
[2:31:41] not have enough space for one mother
[2:31:43] together.
[2:31:45] Let's be wise. Let's be children of God.
[2:31:47] Let's understand that our compliments
[2:31:49] must be a spoken word.
[2:31:51] Amen.
[2:31:52] Amen. Then he said, "And here comes
[2:31:54] God." He said, "Then let that stand. If
[2:31:57] there is ever a doubt in your mind,
[2:31:59] remember this place. Come back here."
[2:32:02] And I showed you the last time. Amen.
[2:32:05] These seven mountains are the life of
[2:32:07] William Brandham in the message. Stand
[2:32:09] in the gap. Your name is written all
[2:32:11] over. I tell you one question. When did
[2:32:14] God create these mountains? 1963. No.
[2:32:18] No. They were created when God created
[2:32:21] the earth.
[2:32:22] Amen.
[2:32:23] And God knew I have a messenger who is a
[2:32:25] neurotic and he's a melancholic type of
[2:32:27] a person.
[2:32:29] And he already portrayed his life.
[2:32:33] And he showed one thing. We have our ups
[2:32:36] and downs the same way.
[2:32:39] And if you are on the mountaintop, don't
[2:32:41] become arrogant.
[2:32:43] Oh, I don't understand these families
[2:32:45] and I don't understand because because
[2:32:47] the next valley is waiting for you
[2:32:50] and brother but when you are in the
[2:32:52] valley don't give up
[2:32:54] don't you have those valleys don't give
[2:32:56] up because the next mountain is waiting
[2:32:59] for you
[2:33:00] okay you must see the bigger picture in
[2:33:03] your life and then you see the big
[2:33:05] bigger picture in another person's life
[2:33:07] who left the church in all kind of
[2:33:09] extremes all kind of perversions but you
[2:33:12] don't see the perversion. You see the
[2:33:13] heart of that man
[2:33:15] and you become an intercessor. He said,
[2:33:16] "Heavenly Father, that's my brother. I'm
[2:33:18] not agreeing into nothing.
[2:33:20] But I I I pray for that boy that he
[2:33:22] comes back and comes back in his own
[2:33:24] mind."
[2:33:25] Can you say amen?
[2:33:27] Here is a man. I build up a complex. We
[2:33:30] could go on, but but but but amen. Next
[2:33:33] one. Amen. Here, two years later,
[2:33:38] God made many things for his men. Amen.
[2:33:44] Brother Weey comes back to life.
[2:33:47] Uh what happened in between is
[2:33:49] everything in the message companion.
[2:33:51] I hope everybody read it. If not, we're
[2:33:53] sending some.
[2:33:54] Amen.
[2:33:55] God spoke to his prophet. Amen. In that
[2:33:58] in that bruised condition and he wanted
[2:34:01] to shoot these three deers and he didn't
[2:34:03] do that.
[2:34:04] And he said, "And here comes the
[2:34:05] presence of the Lord and I put off my
[2:34:07] head." And God says, "You remember your
[2:34:09] promise that you will not shoot these
[2:34:10] three deers." I said, "Yeah, yes, I will
[2:34:13] do it." And he said, "And God told me,
[2:34:15] you remember your promise, so I will
[2:34:17] remember my promise.
[2:34:19] I will never leave you and never forsake
[2:34:21] you." Brother Bla said, "I'm I was not
[2:34:24] the same man anymore."
[2:34:26] Brother, in between of that time, there
[2:34:28] were a lot of miracles. Brother Way came
[2:34:30] back to life, but it never changed the
[2:34:33] prophet.
[2:34:35] But he was changed when he heard that
[2:34:37] still small voice.
[2:34:39] I never leave you. I will never forget
[2:34:41] you, brother. We can have every Sunday
[2:34:44] three miracles here on that platform and
[2:34:46] that is just wonderful. But it will not
[2:34:48] change our problems.
[2:34:50] It will not change our character. Our
[2:34:52] character will be changed when we are
[2:34:54] going in intimacy with our heavenly
[2:34:56] father.
[2:34:57] Can you say amen?
[2:34:58] Amen.
[2:34:59] Two years later on the wings of a snow
[2:35:01] white dove, here we have Jonah. Why me?
[2:35:04] An old man suffered all my life. Why did
[2:35:07] he heal me? Now I believe I will write
[2:35:09] this trail again. Now that's Christ. I
[2:35:11] got to bring a message and I say to my
[2:35:14] father tonight, uh, Lord, your servants
[2:35:18] reporting for service. Amen. I'm ready.
[2:35:22] In between of two years, the seals are
[2:35:24] open. God changes the man
[2:35:28] from a person who wants to give up
[2:35:30] to a person says Lord here I am I'm
[2:35:32] ready
[2:35:36] he made that changing therefore after
[2:35:39] the opening of the seal brother never
[2:35:41] spoke about his life story anymore
[2:35:44] because he speaks of a bigger picture
[2:35:46] amen
[2:35:47] amen you think that God does the same
[2:35:49] for usmen
[2:35:51] do you think
[2:35:52] that the rapture is heavenly Father,
[2:35:56] take me home.
[2:35:58] I cannot see those kies anymore and
[2:36:01] those for trackers and whatever. I hate
[2:36:04] to see those people. Take That's not the
[2:36:07] rapture. The rapture is the glorious
[2:36:10] going home
[2:36:12] of people who are made in the image of
[2:36:15] God, victorious. They died to themselves
[2:36:19] and God could take room in their hearts.
[2:36:23] Can you say amen?
[2:36:24] Amen.
[2:36:25] Blessed be the name of the Lord. If the
[2:36:27] musicians would come, do you love the
[2:36:28] Lord?
[2:36:29] Amen.
[2:36:30] Do do you want to have Dr. Barna and
[2:36:33] making a heart transfer transformation
[2:36:35] at heart? Can you say amen?
[2:36:38] Do you understand? Message is not
[2:36:40] entertainment. Message is changing
[2:36:43] from where we came to a complete new
[2:36:47] creature. But it's not laying on of
[2:36:49] hands. Sorry for this. If you know that
[2:36:52] person who changes you by laying of
[2:36:53] hands, please send it to Germany. I need
[2:36:55] it. But it's taking the word, getting
[2:36:58] that angel said, "Change me, mold me. I
[2:37:01] want to be the same like I am."
[2:37:04] It's not even a question of the baptism
[2:37:06] of the Holy Ghost. That is for your
[2:37:07] salvation. But it's now taking maybe
[2:37:10] your own theophony. I'm coming in the
[2:37:12] same line with your own theophony.
[2:37:14] Whatever you can call it.
[2:37:15] Amen.
[2:37:16] Can you say amen?
[2:37:18] Do you understand young people? How can
[2:37:20] we be happy parents if we are not happy?
[2:37:24] Do you know a a couple wants to marry?
[2:37:27] There's nothing wrong with it. But you
[2:37:28] need the Lord first.
[2:37:30] Because you will make your children
[2:37:32] miserable.
[2:37:34] I and we who are longer on the way.
[2:37:36] Amen. We cannot change our our past.
[2:37:39] Honestly not.
[2:37:40] But we can change our future
[2:37:44] in 2023. Don't Lord don't let me be the
[2:37:46] same.
[2:37:46] Amen,
[2:37:47] brother. And sometime
[2:37:50] I was talking about things I didn't read
[2:37:52] these things in in a book. I was
[2:37:54] experienced all these things because and
[2:37:56] taking care of people bring them out of
[2:37:59] nothing and the church is so surprised
[2:38:01] what a person said to me we we we got a
[2:38:04] boy back and they told me brother Marcus
[2:38:07] who laid hands upon that boy I said
[2:38:09] nobody laid hand he he understood who he
[2:38:11] was in the presence of God and by that
[2:38:14] he changed himself by the renewing power
[2:38:16] of this word. Amen. We are just helping
[2:38:19] in the process, not more.
[2:38:22] But but but life is so brother brother
[2:38:24] you you get sometimes the hit. We all
[2:38:26] get it from time to time and we're just
[2:38:29] down. Even in our ministry sometime we
[2:38:32] think we uh everybody stop born does
[2:38:34] nobody wants to listen. It's it's a
[2:38:36] complex that we build up. No. But we
[2:38:39] think sometimes so and we get our
[2:38:41] beating and I love that picture. Here
[2:38:44] comes Satan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and at seven
[2:38:51] we are
[2:38:53] eight [snorts]
[2:38:56] nine
[2:38:58] 10 and we are back.
[2:39:01] Brother Bam said it like this. He said
[2:39:03] to fall down is human
[2:39:06] to stand up as godly
[2:39:09] brother.
[2:39:10] [applause]
[2:39:12] There is something in you that stands
[2:39:15] up.
[2:39:16] Your heavenly father.
[2:39:19] Can you say amen? What a father we have.
[2:39:23] Don't stay to be the same. Be
[2:39:24] transformed by the renewal of your
[2:39:26] minds.
[2:39:28] Hallelujah.
[2:39:29] Amen. Maybe maybe we sing the song uh
[2:39:34] uh in moments like this.
[2:39:37] I have only five songs to sing. Okay. So
[2:39:40] you say the man cannot preach. He cannot
[2:39:42] sing. Why did he come? Just to be a
[2:39:44] blessing for one another. Do you love
[2:39:46] the Lord?
[2:39:48] [applause]
[2:39:50] Therefore, brother, [cheering] that
[2:39:52] angel came down. I preached a message
[2:39:54] which says the rapture comes to you.
[2:39:58] That angel come down to pick you up and
[2:40:02] equip you for that flight.
[2:40:05] That's our heavenly father in moments
[2:40:07] like this. God bless you. Was a great
[2:40:09] honor for me. Tomorrow we will be a
[2:40:11] little bit practical for the youngsters,
[2:40:12] okay? To be a little bit how we have
[2:40:14] victory in little things of our life.
[2:40:17] It's only for the young people. But let
[2:40:18] me set the young people up to 80. Okay?
[2:40:22] [laughter]
[2:40:24] And
[2:40:26] in moments [singing]
[2:40:29] like these,
[2:40:32] I sing out a song.
[2:40:37] I sing out a love song for Jesus
[2:40:47] [singing]
[2:40:48] in moments
[2:40:51] like these. [music]
[2:40:54] I lift up my hands.
[2:40:59] I lift up my [music and singing] hands
[2:41:03] to the Lord.
[2:41:09] singing [singing]
[2:41:11] I [music]
[2:41:13] love
[2:41:15] you Lord. [singing]
[2:41:20] Singing
[2:41:21] I [singing]
[2:41:24] love
[2:41:26] you Lord.
[2:41:30] singing.
[2:41:32] I [singing]
[2:41:34] [music]
[2:41:35] love
[2:41:38] you,
[2:41:40] Lord. [music]
[2:41:42] I love
[2:41:46] you,
[2:41:48] Lord. In moments like these,
[2:41:53] in moments
[2:41:56] like these,
[2:41:59] I
[2:42:01] [music]
[2:42:02] song.
[2:42:04] I sing out a [singing] love song
[2:42:09] for Jesus. [music]
[2:42:12] [singing]
[2:42:15] In moments
[2:42:18] like these, [music]
[2:42:20] I lift [singing] up my hands.
[2:42:26] I lift up [music and singing]
[2:42:29] my hands to the Lord. [music]
[2:42:36] [singing]
[2:42:37] I
[2:42:40] love [music]
[2:42:42] you. [singing]
[2:42:46] Sing [music]
[2:42:53] you Lord. [singing and music]
[2:42:57] Sing.
[2:42:59] [singing]
[2:43:03] [music]
[2:43:06] Oh Lord, [singing]
[2:43:09] I love
[2:43:13] you. [singing and music]
[2:43:15] Oh, if your music softly plays, heavenly
[2:43:18] father, [music] it was an unusual
[2:43:20] service, even with a little bit of video
[2:43:22] in it. Father was not very conservative
[2:43:25] but it showed us father if these
[2:43:28] youngsters there's [snorts] so much
[2:43:30] their daddy that we saw in the film
[2:43:34] Lord is an an example for us [music]
[2:43:38] to understand so much does God love his
[2:43:42] children.
[2:43:44] We say we love Jesus, but Jesus loves
[2:43:46] his bride so much,
[2:43:48] his children so much. And father, when
[2:43:51] all that is in us, we want to serve you.
[2:43:54] [music]
[2:43:54] Amen.
[2:43:55] All that is in us,
[2:43:58] Father, and change us and mold us,
[2:44:00] Father. Let us grow, Father, because the
[2:44:03] opening of the word brought healing
[2:44:06] under your wings.
[2:44:08] Now we see our true identity, who we are
[2:44:11] really. Nope. psychologist in the world
[2:44:14] can give what this message brings to us
[2:44:17] but we understand principles that a
[2:44:21] person has a psyche and we must
[2:44:23] understand it father
[2:44:25] clean our hearts and I know sometime
[2:44:27] it's a process but when we enter into
[2:44:29] 2023 let us have inventory and said
[2:44:33] heavenly father there is a little bit of
[2:44:35] complex in my heart there's a little bit
[2:44:37] of bitterness in my heart there's a
[2:44:39] little bit of frustration in my heart
[2:44:41] but heavenly father just take it out of
[2:44:44] me. I want to be happy with myself and
[2:44:47] with the next generation and with the
[2:44:49] people around me. Father, I thank you so
[2:44:52] much for your presence and may you bless
[2:44:53] the ministry that is here that was so
[2:44:56] patient with me all these services. May
[2:44:59] you bless the bride in New Zealand.
[2:45:00] Father, may you bless your children,
[2:45:03] Father. May you bless Israel, Father.
[2:45:05] And Father, like your prophet said, we
[2:45:07] are waiting for the new Jerusalem, but
[2:45:09] the bride is the new Jerusalem. At the
[2:45:12] same time, Father, what time of people
[2:45:14] we are, please let us understand who we
[2:45:17] are. And if things in our life just
[2:45:20] burdens us, let us understand that's not
[2:45:23] my burden. Give it back to Satan.
[2:45:25] You gave it to me. I don't want to have
[2:45:27] it. Thank you very much. I'm a child of
[2:45:29] God.
[2:45:30] Father, it takes a process. It took for
[2:45:32] me sometimes many, many years to be
[2:45:34] honest. But I know that you're working
[2:45:37] still and you're working in my brother
[2:45:39] and my sisters. And please father
[2:45:41] continue to work on our hearts and our
[2:45:43] minds so that one day we can say I am
[2:45:46] the message of the hour. I can I I have
[2:45:50] the caliber that we are seeing in the
[2:45:52] ministry of William [music] Brandham.
[2:45:53] Amen. So father we thank you for this
[2:45:56] evening. May you Amen. If I can say it.
[2:45:58] I don't know if somebody preaches praise
[2:46:00] behind it. May you bless the food and
[2:46:02] the fellowship father. And may you
[2:46:04] continue to bless us if we have some
[2:46:06] songs. And father may you bring us back
[2:46:08] tomorrow happy uh wells slept in good
[2:46:14] shape and ready to listen what you want
[2:46:18] to say what the spirit wants to say.
[2:46:20] Thank you so much for that audience.
[2:46:22] Thank you father for your greatness. Ask
[2:46:24] it in Jesus name. Amen. [music]
[2:46:31] God bless you my precious brother. God
[2:46:33] bless you together.
[2:46:34] In moments [singing]
[2:46:36] like these,
[2:46:39] I [singing] lift up my hands.
[2:46:45] I lift up my hands to
[2:46:50] you Lord
[2:46:54] singing
[2:46:56] I [singing]

[2:46:58] love
[2:47:00] you.

[2:47:09] Heat.
[2:47:16] [music]
[2:47:23] Heat. [music]
[2:47:32] [music]
[2:47:39] I'm amazed
[2:47:42] that you love [music and singing] me.
[2:47:47] I'm amazed
[2:47:50] [music] how you came.
[2:47:55] Your [music] preious
[2:47:58] blood
[2:48:00] [singing]
[2:48:07] [music]
[2:48:09] [singing] wash away
[2:48:11] my
[2:48:14] wash [music]
[2:48:15] away.
[2:48:22] [music]
[2:48:23] I was feeling
[2:48:28] [music]
[2:48:29] I tried so hard to
[2:48:36] my love [music]
[2:48:38] life was fine without you.
[2:48:43] I [music] was [singing] covering up the
[2:48:46] secret
[2:48:48] I [music]
[2:48:48] cry.
[2:48:51] May one [singing] day
[2:48:54] [music]
[2:48:55] of your mercy.
[2:49:00] [music]
[2:49:06] [music]
[2:49:09] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:49:12] [music and singing]
[2:49:17] [music]
[2:49:19] Heat.
[2:49:23] Heat. [music and singing]
[2:49:34] Yeah.
[2:49:37] Heat. [music]
[2:49:45] [music]
[2:49:50] Yeah.

[2:50:01] [music]
[2:50:02] Heat. Heat.
[2:50:06] [music]
[2:50:14] Many times [music] I

[2:53:48] Father, we thank you for those young
[2:53:49] people who are [music] standing in your
[2:53:51] presence. Father, that was the great
[2:53:53] desire of one of the deacons that God is
[2:53:55] touching the young ones, Father. And I
[2:53:58] ask you, Father, that you [music] will
[2:53:59] just take their hands this evening. I'm
[2:54:02] will take them and lead them home.
[2:54:04] Father, [music] let their young age when
[2:54:08] they're in their teenage years, Father,
[2:54:10] may you just lead them by the Holy
[2:54:12] Spirit, fill them, Father. If you're not
[2:54:14] if they're not baptized yet, Father,
[2:54:16] lead them to a true baptism. If they
[2:54:18] don't have the Holy Ghost yet, Father,
[2:54:20] fill them with the Holy Ghost, Father.
[2:54:22] The only satisfying portion, Father. So,
[2:54:25] we thank you, Father, for this moment.
[2:54:27] [music]
[2:54:27] Why don't you give an a situation a
[2:54:29] possibility for each and everyone?
[2:54:31] Father, so that nobody goes [music] out
[2:54:33] of this convention without taking that
[2:54:36] advantage to take him by his hand.
[2:54:39] Hallelujah. [music]
[2:54:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Is
[2:54:41] there somebody else who feel that's my
[2:54:44] calling to serve the Lord? Hallelujah.
[2:54:47] [music] Just raise your hands to God.
[2:54:49] Hallelujah. God bless your brother in
[2:54:51] the back. Hallelujah. So, Father, we
[2:54:53] thank [music] you for this time of
[2:54:55] consecration.
[2:54:56] I I believe there's a lot of insincerity
[2:54:59] right behind it, Father. [music] And you
[2:55:01] may guide them and lead them into your
[2:55:03] perfect will, Father. You said all that
[2:55:05] received you, you gave power [music] to
[2:55:07] become sons and daughters of God. So we
[2:55:10] thank you, Father. You started that
[2:55:11] process [music] with their hand lifted
[2:55:13] up. So we ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:55:16] Hallelujah. You please sit down.

[2:55:20] you for the song be. Amen.
