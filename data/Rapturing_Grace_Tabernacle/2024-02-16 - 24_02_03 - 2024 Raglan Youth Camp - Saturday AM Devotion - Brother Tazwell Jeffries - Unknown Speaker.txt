TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Give the Lord a hand of Praise now you see that that's your confession for this weekend because we know we are in a spiritual war and the devil wants you but God wants you and over this weekend and going forward God is going to win because you are on the winning sight so let's just pray quickly and then we'll go into this little devotion Lord Jesus we so thankful to be with this beautiful young people we pray oh God for this little devotion that you would just lead us this morning and help us oh God as we'll plant Little Seeds oh God lord into into our young people and even into us as adults Lord and we just want to commit all things into your hands in jesus' name amen you may be seated this morning um so uh I've just got a little I've got a little little thought uh which the Lord laid on my heart and I'm going to try to be as brief as I can and I actually came with some slides I don't always use slides but I thought maybe this time around I'll try to use some slides and some pictures and we'll see how the Lord leads right but I youan know as I look at you and I was this morning as I was waking up and realizing that I'm going to be speaking to these beautiful young people and I actually thought to myself my how how privileged I am Judah you know just to you know you guys are just simply awesome I'm I'm I'm so uh blessed to be associated with you and I want you to know that you know and and you know you know how it is I I know that you know there are people even amongst the young people that that can can look at somebody and can see whether they they telling the truth or whether they're being a fake so I'm hoping as you looking at me you can see I'm telling the truth and I love you guys man you're just so simply awesome there's there's greatness within you there's so much potential within you and you know like like the the the theme says we are in this together and I know you know as as young people the brothers and the sisters you are there to help each other and support each other so God bless you um brother um Joseph if you could just put on that slide so my my my this is my my opening scripture right so the Bible says uh in Jeremiah 17:9 it says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it so when I looked at that word Wicked it doesn't really mean evil it just means uh the heart is weak and you can go have a look in the in the in the in the Lexicon he says I the Lord search the heart I try the reins so the Lord comes and he examines our hearts and I want to encourage you as we're going to go through this this little quickly through the slides um you know just just um listen to what is being said and you're going to hear my voice right but but listen to the voice behind my voice because I believe it's God that loves you I mean I brother T said he loves you right but God loves you so much that brother you know he led on the heart of brother Al to do this and it's for you but it's not only for you it's for me also cuz I'm also here to receive from God Amen so I I've titled this the healing of your heart and I believe you know many many of us and some of us might look at and say ah I don't I don't need healing in the heart but really when we dig deep there are things that we we need the Lord to come and just to to come and and and and and strengthen within us so I I spoke about the heart and I'm going see if this works now yeah so so if you go and and I like I like to do this um if you go back sort of into the the back meanings like the Hebrew lexicon and then the Greek you you discover really what the words in the Bible is sort of referring to so now when when you look at the heart the Bible speaks about the heart of man and I always struggle when the Bible says you know as a man thinketh in his heart and I could never understand that because I thought you I'm thinking you're in my mind but anyway so I discovered you know when when when you go and you look at these things when when the Bible speaks about the heart of man it it refers to you as as a as a living being it it it it speaks about your your desires that you have it it speaks about the passions that you have and Passions is um you know sometimes it's emotions that you cannot control um it speaks about the inner being of man it says there the seat of the appetite so the appetites that you have right and as you can see whe the Taz is struggling because he has some natural appetites um especially when I was in South Africa right I just I just I just come from South Africa and man I enjoyed the South African food with the Michael I realized what I miss so I picked up quite a lot and and I realized you know I got to deal with my appetite but that's my physical appetite so here it talks about you know the heart is the seat of the appetite now we can also have appetites for you know for things out there you know and and and you you as you you know listening to me you can know what what are the things that you desire and you have an appetite for you know like I mean in my home I know that my kids have an appetite and we and we're dealing with that they got an appetite for gaming you know so fortn night and all those kind of things um so you know and also the heart is you know the seat where where where your emotions and your passions come from you know so just uh I thought I wanted to just drop that when we're speaking about the heart of man when the Bible speaks about the heart of man right and then in in the Greek and and and this is again in the New Testament again the Greek looked at it as that physical boom boom boom that we have right a physical heart um but also it says again they talk about you know that's where your thoughts and and the passions and your desires and your appetites come from and and and the affections and and you know the innermost part of you and that is why you know the this message that has come our way it's a message to the heart it's a message that's transforming the heart so anyway I thought I'll just drop that in and all of the stuff is available right so I've got two hearts there and we're going to we're going to chat a bit more about that but so on on the left hand side I've got the grayish heart on the right hand side I've got the white heart and whatever is in the heart we see it manifested in the desires that we have right so so the desire that I have for certain things it's coming from within right um you know passions the appeti so so on the left uh the gray heart there are certain grayish kind of desires and things that comes up right and and on the right it's nice white and pure stuff that that that just comes and radiates out of us as individuals now brother brandom says man always trying to achieve something by his head now he says he's supposed to achieve now I look at you young people you at in your Prime of life and I want to encourage you be Achievers you know you know at least when I grew up in the in the message Community we were told you know at least our parents were told you mustn't study and you mustn't you mustn't better yourself but I believe that you know God wants us to achieve and and and you the BAM says we are supposed to achieve and then he says but our achievement he says is by the heart um and he says that's the control tower where God controls you and me right so God he directs our thoughts directs our walk and directs our emotions but we need to submit that to him we need to surrender that to him right so I'll just go on here then brother bandam goes he says with our heads bowed how many will lay your heart upon the altar so we know an altar and I'll just I've got a slide there an altar is something where sacrifice was made unto God so he says how many of us will lay our hearts our everything our desires our passions our emotions just lay it before God right and make it a feel to God that he might swow his word um upon the altar of our hearts now over this weekend we're going to hear Ministry we're going to hear God speaking to us and it's important that as we sit here right and I know we might get distracted by the beautiful scenery out there and they might the AL might end up closing the curtains if he sees we distracted out there but you know just allow God to speak and and and and we don't know how the Lord's going to do things right but he might touch on certain specifics that we might be going through that we might be experiencing maybe certain emotions that we can't handle and we don't know how to handle it and we know that those emotions is it's it's pulling us away from God or maybe certain appetites that we have and that appetites is is it's pulling us away from God and we know it so let's over this weekend let's allow God right to to come and identify certain things um and when he identifies it we've got to respond to him right she's not going to respond to by the Taz or whoever's going to minister by the Michael you're going to respond to God and he's a God that can change your life and I I stand here and I mean I don't know some of you would have heard my testimony I'm a I'm a product of a God that can change lives and and and and I've seen in my life how God has taken my desires and the passions that I have and the appetites that I used to have for certain things I seen how God changed that and he can do that to you right because you know what as look man you you guys are just beautiful sorry beautiful sisters and handsome Brothers you know and and uh man they they I I look at you and I say man you guys can shake New Zealand now I don't mean Shake New Zealand as in being loud and crazy and because brother brandom comes and he says he says it is that Sanctified life he says that is the Thunder against the devil he says it's that life he says you want to hurt the devil just live just live surrender to God and you know he will then allow you you to that life will just flow and it will just smash the devil so and I think it's not only New Zealand that's here there's Australia I think there's us and don't know who else is here you guys have the potential if not yet you guys have the potential to shake the world right but we need to be surrendered I I believe that you know surrender is a it's a key attribute of a Christian and that's what God wants of us so it's just one thing about the random says you know he says your heart is the altar right so many times we you know we have meetings and we have an altar call right and I used to hear the minister say many times um when you you know as as the Lord is leading make your heart your altar I don't know you've heard that before right I've I've heard that many times and I never understood it until I realize you know even when I'm sitting in my seat I can be speaking to him and just saying Lord I want to surrender I want to surrender this thing that's really Lord is bothering me and you you can make your heart an altar for God for the fire of God because you know as we go back into the Old Testament they would do an altar and the fire of God would come and consume the sacrifice so as we sit here and I just I want to plant the seed in you just for this weekend but not only for this weekend for you going forward you know just allow God you know he's he's an amazing God so anyway your heart is the altar right so we all have an altar as we sit here we all have an altar and there's some things on our Altar and there are some things that we need to give to God there are some things that we need to say Lord um I I I need you to help me I I I need Grace I need strength and and also I think was the theme we in this together right so you and I we are our Brother's Keeper so you guys might know what I'm going through or I might know what you're going through so over this weekend as you're praying for yourself because we're in this together we pray for each other so you're walking outside there and you see brother T maybe one side just say Lord you know for the T mentioned this to me Lord can you just meet with him can you just do something special in his life and then brother Taz is standing there and he sees you know brother Al there and he's also saying Lord you know where they meet with him so will you guys do that over this weekend you know just just support each other pray with each other pray for each other even even while and I think after this we're going to have some fantastic uh physical activities whatever even through all of that you know I believe the Lord will still continue to lead and help you and encourage you and you can encourage someone else so anyway so the heart is the altar right so just there we find the first altar that was that that was erected was um with Noah and the Lord was pleased with what Noah did right and the Lord smelled the sweet Savor and because of Noah's sacrifice what he sacrificed God was pleased um and then he said I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake right so that was the first uh place where an altar was erected and an altar now remember your heart is an altar now an altar if you go back into the Hebrew it's a place of Slaughter so they put the animal on the Altar and you know they would kill it it's it's a it's a place of killing it's a place of sacrifice now as we sit here and and our hearts is our altar there might be things that we are going to be presenting to our Lord Jesus Christ and we just we we present and say Lord this thing has got to die and Lord I'm giving it to you I'm you know sometimes it's something that we love so I don't forget one time Minister said you know there's sometimes you get these guys or even the sisters right you've got this charm about you man the the the if it's a guy the girls just love you when you come into their presence it's like they get all weak in the knees or then maybe the sister you know has got this thing and the the whenever she comes into the presence of the brothers the brothers just go crazy now sometimes that thing which you love because man it's it makes you feel popular but maybe that thing can be your D bful right and and I we we know personally of of of personal friends of mine that had this man he just had away with with women and the devil used that and he was and and and he's right now he's not in a good state so even those kind of things let's let's just give it to the Lord and and that is the sacrifice because I don't want to let go of being popular right but let's just surrender that to the Lord and think of it as you know what heaven is so much more important to me than this you know um temporary um you know sort of attention that I get I mean attention is good and I'm not sort of hitting against that but sometimes we just need to be kind of careful and watchful that certain things don't pull us down I hope you get what I'm what I'm saying right so I'll just I'll just touch on this one right now we for those of us and I'm sure all of us know our Bibles right we read our Bibles every single day right we Christians we are message Believers so um in the Bible and you can go read it I'm not going to go into the detail of it right but this is where Elijah had the Mount Carmel Showdown where he you know he had with the prophets of Bal and he told them you know what if you can get your God to call fire from uh bring fire down from heaven you know we'll serve your God or if my God does it you'll serve my God and so anyway so the prophets of B they built the Altar and they were going crazy and Elijah mocked them and they never ended up pulling fire down from from heaven right but here the Bible then says once they were all done now Elijah comes and the B and there's something that I want to just hit on here so Elijah comes and you see there he's busy repairing the Bible says repairing the altar of the Lord that was broken down now remember I said earlier your heart is the altar right so here Elijah comes in the First Kings 18 and he comes and he repairs the altar that was broken down okay now again and sorry I I like going into the Hebrew and the know apologize if you you feel that's too much but so he repaired the altar of the Lord and when I looked at that word repair so now if you look back here right he's got this physical bricks and he's building and he's fixing up things but if you look at that word repaired in the Hebrew you will find out it actually talks about healing so Elijah really went to that physical Altar and he went to go whatever he did provided some healing and this message is a message of healing healing to our hearts so yeah I just I want to bring that out so that you know he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down you know so so as as we're going to go through the meeting and God is going to be dealing with you and maybe some of us you know even though we're young people some of us just got to deal with hurts and we got to deal with pains and we got to deal with history and we've been hurt by this person and that person did this to me and then I walk around and I got this person what's the word we use I've got him on my heart cuz how could brother Canan have said that about me so now I walk around and all I can think about is brother Kanan did this so I'm carrying him on my heart and it's hurting me now God is able to come and he's able to provide healing now that is not only to the adults but that's to us I'm part of the young people that's to us as young people because God cares about young people if you go back brother bandam said you know I think was when he when he met the angel and things and something was said for the young people so God God loves you man God loves me as well obviously but what he did was so he repaired the altar so there were things that needed to be made right there was healing that needed to be that needed to happen and then the Bible says and then the fire of the Lord came down right so obviously that takes me to our scripture right and I'm sure all of you can quote the scripture closed eyes right I hope so that's my scripture I grew up with it you know behold I send you Elijah the prophet and what what does it say and he will turn the hearts so it's back to the heart and it's it's about taking you and me and turning us back to the revealed word so it's about you know so that's why I I just wrote there I said this message don't underestimate it and and and don't think it's just like another cult or another this is a message that is healing us this is a message that is strengthening us this is a message that is helping brother tears to overcome so this is a message to the heart so as we're going to hear God speaking and he's dealing with us re receive it you know I think brother brother Steven came to minister for us one time I'm going to finish soon brother Steven came to minister for us one time and he read a quote which man it just blew me away where he said brandom talks about we have to receive the word right it's important so we we sitting here and we we listen to brother T speaking and as long as brother T is speaking the word of God which I believe I am we've got to receive the word right but what I love brother the brandham says is that we might have come in here right all sad and Droopy and tired but he says as we receive the word right the Bible brother brandom says as you receive the word you become the word right so you become a Powerhouse but what I love brother the bandam said is as we sitting in the meeting right and he says as the the word is going forth and as you sitting here something Supernatural is happening it's not just brother the Michael coming up here and preaching the word and saying stuff but we are Supernatural young people and matur adult people right and and and and and and and we we we we we live in the Realms of the supernatural even right now so brother bandam says as as as the word Goes Forth and as you receive the word it has an impact on you so he uses he says he says your eyes that was droopy and tired cuz I didn't have enough sleep last night he says it starts to brighten up because you as you receive the word and the god reveals the word to you you start realizing wow this is powerful stuff and it's not only stuff about that it's it's it's talking about me and it's saying how what Authority I have that's within me and and I hope you you know that right this this message this message comes and it tells us who God is right and it tells us who the devil is because we need to know our enemy but it also tells you who you are and that's I believe it's also so important Michael we need to know who we are because when we leave this beautiful atmosphere and this beautiful camp and we go out there the devil is going to challenge us but what did you sing earlier he didn't let the devil win I purposefully made you s it because I want it to come from your lips he didn't let the devil win and the devil will not not not win over this weekend God is going to win and God is already winning okay so this is the message to the heart so I'll just go through this and then we'll finish so this brother the Brandon really just talks about these things right so he talks about the the he says um he he draws he he actually goes and draws on the white board and he says he's a human heart on the left and and there's a human heart on the on the right so now we spoke earlier about the heart that you know from the heart your desires your emotions your appetites and all these sorts of things right so but talks about that now I put that up there's a disclaimer if you don't like snakes if you don't like looking at snakes you can't close your eyes right cuz there's some pictures of snakes but listen so don't close your ears close your eyes if you want to right now brother Brandon this is brother Brandon sort of tells us he says so he talks about the one heart he says this heart has got a snake in it and it's sin and it's it's a life right so this is somebody that's got a you know it's and and that snake really is kind of the the nature so that snake has got a snake nature so the desires and the passions and the appetites And the emotions and all those things that comes out of you or the the person is kind of the characteristics of a snake right so brother B talks about that then oops what's happening here now what did I just do next one next one can you go okay next one so then he says on the other side there's another heart right and then he says this one here has a dove in it right and he says that has got a life and then from that heart on the right the desires the passions the appe has the emotions and the way we do things it's influenced by what's on the inside on the right and obviously there are people that's on the left that's got that characteristics but at the end of the day God wants us to have the characteristics which is on the right and that is why we go to church that is why the Lord speaks to us constantly because he wants to change us he wants to transform us us right so now by the goes on and he talks about the one with the snake which is not not such a kind of good nature and he says you know this malice and this hatred and this Envy so that is the characteristics that comes out right but then on the right with the dove it's just love that flows Longs suffering and joy and man it's just awesome to be a Christian so God wants us to move from wherever we are to that side and he makes a way and he makes it possible right so now brother Brandon says now when you are so you repent and you say Lord I'm sorry so he forgives you right forgives you of the sins and then those things like malice and hatred and envy you know it goes away but the root cause is still there so there needs to be an inside change right and that's what God wants to do with us but we need to be be willing we need to say Lord I want a change right so he says that made you're still there he forgives you but that that nature needs to change right and then he talks about uh you know you being clean and set aside for service and then he says then comes the baptism of fire and the holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts so I believe you know as we're going to be in these meetings and as the Lord is going to speak to us and as we're going to sit with surrendered Hearts we're going to allow God right to deal with us right and we're going to allow God to maybe highlight certain things I I'll finish I've got one more slide right so if you picture this a big a big drum a big drum right and in this drum if you go to it it's been standing stagnant for a long time and in this drum there's water that's laying there so when you go and look at that drum and man the water looks clear but if you go and you just give that drum a big kick what happens the rubbish that's at the bottom starts coming up right now I believe over this weekend God might kick you allow him I think it's good because then he's going to start showing hey T that temper and you know what I'll just I'll finish over this and um um so question is what is on the altar of your heart right now over this weekend that we need to give to God or that God can come and heal right it's about healing this this week weekend it's we all in this together and it's about God coming in healing right let's allow him to consume what's on your heart allow him that's it's about surrender right that's important you forget a lot of things the T said today remember that one word surrender okay surrender allow him to heal just give it to him speak to him say Lord I I'm struggling with this and you see I got that at the bottom there Satan has got no power over you after confession cuz that's the devil does e he he we do things we make things we make mistakes and we fail God and we you know do stuff we shouldn't do and then the devil keeps us there and uh you want to you want to you know um get up from there but he says nah just remember but he doesn't tell you that God has made a way for us to to break out of that right so say so it's about you know we we we we need to repent and we need to make things right because we want to be free we want to en you know what being a Christian is not boring being a Christian is not being bound by chains being a Christian is being free and those of you that know by the T I love being free I love to dance I love to sing and I said I know I sing false but it's okay I don't care you know I want to be free because it's wonderful to be a Christian don't let anybody tell you it's boring and I you know man once once you've had an that experience with God and once he's transformed he's genuinely transformed your life you will realize that the stuff that I was doing there was really keeping me in bondage because now I am free and just speak to these ministers there and the adults they can tell you it is awesome and I know I'm taking too much time but I'm going to finish off here now you see we can be guilt-free cu the devil wants to put us on a guilt trip but you this weekend you can be you can walk away from this you might have come you guilty but there's a song that we sing Jesus drop the charges but we have to give it over to him we have to surrender last quote this is my last thing I put that Mouse strap there because that's what happened to many of us the enemy dangles that piece of cheese that we just love and it's so irresistible and we go and we take a bite just a little bite not realizing when we take that little bite bam the Trap hits us and we find ourselves trapped in something and we want to get out but oh man it's so hard and then the devil tells us just stay there remember this quote there might be many things in this life that the enemy has trapped you in cuz the enemy does I want you to know who you are trapped you into but remember my brother and my sister you still have the right to have a conference with God use this opportunity use this and I'm hoping it's okay that this devotion I just thought I wanted to make it kind of to make us really look into ourselves right because this is a matter of life and death you know this is a battle it's a fight and God told me the AL to have these meetings for you and again I came to a meeting like this and was there when my life was changed so you might and I look I know there's some of you here that I know that came to meetings like this and your lives were changed and I see you today and I say Lord thank you that you're still holding them cuz you're still holding me so you have the right so don't don't let the devil tell you that you know when God wants to deal with you and he pulls you and he calls you don't let the devil tell you know you can't you can't make right you can't repent you can't don't listen to him cuz he's going to tell you he's going to preach to you all the time because you mean if if you're going and listen to by the brandham services meetings the enemy was in the meetings so the devil is going to want to stop you don't don't let him and like again we're in this together so if you know that you know the devil is trying to push your brother down pray for him Devil's trying to push your sister down pray for her support him love love each other this weekend right he's a very present help in times of trouble so I'm hoping that devotion was okay and I'm hoping it just sets you you know sets us sets us up for the weekend and uh you know and and just let's let's just surrender that's all can we pray Lord Jesus thank you for this opportunity thank you my God for these wonderful beautiful young people my God as I looked at them and look into their eyes my God you you see that there's a longing for you and I pray that you come in the way that you know best and you touch the hearts of every single one Lord you don't there mustn't be anyone that's on the sideline or anyone oh God Lord that you're going to miss you're not going to miss anybody father every single one is going to be impacted by the this weekend so father we just commit Our Lives to you we commit this weekend to you the day of activities whatever is going to be planned Lord we're going to maybe go go crazy and run and play games and but through all of it we are Christians and through all of it we are conscious that we are in the presence of God and that there are angels all around so we say thank you in Jesus name amen go God bless you let's give the Lord a hand of Praise love you love you very much thank you very much brother Dez God bless you I trust that we uh that we take that on board and I have a little bit of an idea where brother Michael is going to go and I know that the Lord is working the platform has been set this is very exciting very very exciting so now just one or two things before we go have breakfast um I just want to make sure so did everyone see the programs that we stuck up everywhere okay so have a look at that and um so if if you've seen the program you will know that we are going to have breakfast now and then at 8:30 no 9:30 sorry it's 8:30 already past um at 9 :30 I would like to ask please be here 9:30 sharp here in this Hall okay so then we'll uh do the official welcomes and introductions and all those fun things and we will we will let you know what's going to happen over the weekend but I want to say up front thank you for coming it's awesome to have you um I trust that we can enjoy this time together time of Fellowship time of enjoyment and we'll say a lot of other things later but um main thing right now is um is that we gather here the other thing is has anyone not got a hoodie yet can you just raise your hand two three four okay five six so if you if you don't have a hoodie yet please see p now okay I'll tell you a secret right if you want to get her angry call her sister priscella [Laughter] she prefers to be called pillar right and and I'm El you don't have to brother or Pastor I'm El right um anyway I want us to be free and to enjoy the time together um so I I'm going to maybe just before we say grace can someone just call step oh there you are maybe we'll um just let Steph needs to tell us a few things that the camp has instructed us to do regarding the food rules so while I have you here sorry to do this here in the sanctuary but let Steven tell you what's going on there morning God bless you all right just a few little things Logistics just to keep things flowing easy in the kitchen area so the dishing up process is going to be when they call you to canish up is come around that side and collect a plate and then you'll get your food and the knives and forks and Cat on right then you come back into this side of the hall this side and then take up seating from there um once you're done with the meal um basically back you'll see where you did the serving up there is a table with some trays where you put your C in um knives and forks and spoons is separate trays for those and they go with a handle up so the the the place that the part that you put in your mouth goes in the hot water so it starts to um clean that a little bit before we have to wash them in the back so and then also there's two different color BNS the red the red bin out the front there is for food scraps so that's ones that goes to the pigs after it so just make sure that that's with all your food scraps no papers Plastics or anything like that will go in that bin and I think the other one's a green color one is for your liquid so if you've got leftover coffee water throw it inside there turn the cup upside down inside the tray provided on the table um and there's also little spatulas please clean off your plates as clean as you can and then just put it on on the where you collected the plates um it's up on the server there and then we'll deal with it from there um and then also there's no go areas in the kitchen so where we're dishing up behind that is where the dishes get washed um if anyone is interested in assisting the kitchen staff there we happy for you to come and help us there with the the washing up but anything beyond that um is Staff only so that's health and safety reasons and those kind of issues so no one in the back section of the kitchen at all all right so I think that kind of covers that if you got any questions didn't understand just come and see me or any of the kitchen staff will be able to point in the right direction well good thank you very much maybe we should already give the kitchen staff ahead okay so a quick quiz what goes in the red bucket SC food scraps what goes in the green bucket liquid liquids so what do you do with all your servat and Plastics and stuff there's a black burn he didn't tell you that part okay all right so please don't put your little butter packets or servat or anything into either of the two buckets put them in the black bin Okie doie so you got that one right pH okay let's just say grace for the food precious father thank you Lord for this morning thank you for this beautiful day father we just want to
