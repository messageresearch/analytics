[1:05:33] want to give a special welcome I know
[1:05:35] brother Andrew wise and the group there
[1:05:37] in Nelson they are streaming these
[1:05:39] services from church and they're going
[1:05:42] to be with us in spirit this weekend so
[1:05:44] I would like to welcome them also and I
[1:05:46] trust that that it will be a blessing to
[1:05:49] you likewise
[1:05:51] also just want to take a moment I was
[1:05:54] just really blown away when I walked in
[1:05:56] here today and saw what what the
[1:05:58] brothers and sisters have done and thank
[1:06:00] you so much for all the effort that has
[1:06:01] gone into getting it all ready and
[1:06:03] beautiful and and I just really
[1:06:05] appreciate each one of you God bless you
[1:06:08] richly and and my prayer for you for
[1:06:10] this weekend is May you not be too tired
[1:06:13] to receive the word amen may the Lord
[1:06:15] bless you
[1:06:17] amen yes
[1:06:22] now these Services praise the Lord you
[1:06:24] can give it a few keys
[1:06:25] [Laughter]
[1:06:31] praise the lord well what you might not
[1:06:34] know is that well some of you know I
[1:06:36] know but um these Services have been
[1:06:38] coming for quite a long time I know last
[1:06:41] year April I thought was it 2020 already
[1:06:43] I can't remember we were going to have a
[1:06:45] convention and it turned out to be a
[1:06:46] virtual convention but even before that
[1:06:49] brother Marcus and I had been speaking
[1:06:50] about him coming
[1:06:52] and brother Marcus promised me that in
[1:06:56] his own words as soon as sister Adin
[1:06:58] allows him to come he will come
[1:07:02] so at some point I contacted him earlier
[1:07:05] this year and said to him brother Marcus
[1:07:07] sister I didn't says you can come so
[1:07:10] praise the Lord he's uh he's here and we
[1:07:12] thank for that sister then let him to
[1:07:14] come so it's good it's good to be here
[1:07:18] um I would like to go over a few uh
[1:07:21] practical things and and I will
[1:07:23] apologize now and not again hopefully
[1:07:25] not again
[1:07:26] um but I will probably repeat some of
[1:07:29] these things tomorrow tomorrow evening
[1:07:31] when the
[1:07:33] um when when a lot of the other people
[1:07:35] are here
[1:07:37] um so I'm sure some of you have figured
[1:07:39] that out but we've already had a bunch
[1:07:41] of people ask the questions where the
[1:07:42] bathrooms are or toilets or restrooms
[1:07:45] whatever you prefer to call it so when
[1:07:47] you come in the glass doors here in the
[1:07:49] foyer area on your right hand side you
[1:07:51] will find the the toilets there so
[1:07:53] that's where you'll find them then for
[1:07:56] the mothers there's a cry room so if you
[1:07:59] just go down the passage here again in
[1:08:02] the glass doors and turn left there's a
[1:08:05] there's a cry room there obviously we're
[1:08:08] asking that only mothers with with small
[1:08:11] kids make use of that but that's for
[1:08:15] your availability there there's also a
[1:08:19] screen there where the services will be
[1:08:22] streamed live all the time so you trust
[1:08:26] that that will be a blessing to you then
[1:08:28] one other thing that we always have to
[1:08:30] do is in case of an emergency
[1:08:33] these evacuation or if evacuation is
[1:08:37] required the assembly point is the
[1:08:39] netball courts most of you would have
[1:08:41] seen them as you came past but they just
[1:08:43] next to the road so out here turn right
[1:08:46] and go towards the net netball courts so
[1:08:49] that's the assembly point if that should
[1:08:51] be needed
[1:08:53] then we have a fire Warden here and you
[1:08:57] would have seen him already with Simon
[1:09:00] wave no everyone needs to see you Simon
[1:09:04] okay
[1:09:05] right so his Simon is the fire warden so
[1:09:08] if there's a fire just look what he does
[1:09:10] and follow him right
[1:09:14] okay and then we also have a medical
[1:09:16] officer
[1:09:20] she's family of the firewood by the way
[1:09:23] and so if you have any need there then
[1:09:26] just see sister Julie for those things
[1:09:30] um also and I know this probably is not
[1:09:32] necessary to say but but you know I
[1:09:35] would like to ask these little steps uh
[1:09:38] they've just got a very awkward kind of
[1:09:40] inclination so be careful when you use
[1:09:43] the steps that you that you don't fall
[1:09:45] so just use them carefully if you are
[1:09:47] not so confident use the steps at the
[1:09:49] end so you can you can happily use
[1:09:52] either of them
[1:09:54] um then I would like to also ask please
[1:09:57] don't wander around on the schoolyards
[1:10:00] we have access to the hall and the
[1:10:02] entrance to the hall and obviously
[1:10:04] you're welcome to use the parking area
[1:10:05] but let's stay away from everything else
[1:10:08] it's not and disturb anything here and
[1:10:10] let's just come in have our time here
[1:10:13] worship stay as long as you like but
[1:10:16] when we go let's just go and leave
[1:10:18] everything understood you if you can
[1:10:21] and then I'm sure by now the program is
[1:10:24] fairly clear for everyone but if there's
[1:10:27] any uncertainties around that there's a
[1:10:29] copy of the program on that board there
[1:10:32] just behind the the technician brothers
[1:10:33] and there's also another copy of it on
[1:10:36] the glass doors where you where you come
[1:10:38] in so if you're uncertain about service
[1:10:40] times over the weekend that's where
[1:10:41] you'll find it
[1:10:43] and then again
[1:10:45] brother Simon but you know who he is now
[1:10:47] if if you need if you want to do any
[1:10:50] song items there's probably still a few
[1:10:52] spots open is there yes there's a few
[1:10:54] spots open so if if anyone still wants
[1:10:57] to do song items please see brother
[1:10:58] Simon for that
[1:11:01] um then anything in the in the church
[1:11:03] here anything that we can do to make you
[1:11:05] more comfortable any any need that you
[1:11:07] have here anything please see one of the
[1:11:09] deacon Brothers you would have met two
[1:11:11] of them as you came in the the front
[1:11:13] door but there's another one here
[1:11:16] by the mark and then brother John and
[1:11:19] Brother Bruce at the back so if if you
[1:11:22] need anything if you don't have your
[1:11:23] Bible with you anything like that
[1:11:25] um please go see our Deacon brothers and
[1:11:27] they will make you feel welcome and so
[1:11:30] forth and then any other practical
[1:11:32] Arrangements anything that's that's
[1:11:33] going wrong or anything like that any
[1:11:36] any anything you will need to blame on
[1:11:37] someone see Brothers
[1:11:40] right it's all his fault
[1:11:43] can you just raise your hand so everyone
[1:11:45] sees who you are okay
[1:11:47] praise the Lord
[1:11:49] has been project managing all of this
[1:11:52] and done a wonderful job just really
[1:11:54] appreciate that
[1:11:56] and then the other thing that I don't
[1:11:58] know there's so many things in the foyer
[1:12:00] that that you could have possibly missed
[1:12:01] that there's one and sorry I'm going to
[1:12:04] be naughty now there's one particular
[1:12:05] thing in the foyer that you must please
[1:12:07] not miss
[1:12:09] right
[1:12:10] and there's on a table I'm kind of
[1:12:11] looking at it straight there there's a
[1:12:13] little trophy
[1:12:15] that's got a name on
[1:12:17] of a young lady that's sitting here
[1:12:19] tonight
[1:12:20] because she's in this High School so
[1:12:22] please look at the trophy but that's not
[1:12:24] what I wanted to say right
[1:12:27] there's a table there with message
[1:12:29] material that you can
[1:12:32] that's free to take for anyone so feel
[1:12:34] free to help yourself so just in that
[1:12:36] foyer area there there's there's um
[1:12:39] there's a few things that I think quite
[1:12:40] a few people would want and there's
[1:12:42] limited numbers so be quick if you
[1:12:44] wanted I won't give a give that away too
[1:12:46] much
[1:12:49] um then practical things
[1:12:52] um so meals we we're providing lunch and
[1:12:55] a supper and the supper will be slightly
[1:12:58] more substantial than than just the
[1:13:00] coffee and cake
[1:13:01] um so it should should be able to fill
[1:13:03] the little spot you uh you might have
[1:13:06] after the service
[1:13:07] and the meals will be at the War
[1:13:10] Memorial Hall the War Memorial Hall is
[1:13:12] in Miranda Street or between Miranda
[1:13:14] Street and Portia Street
[1:13:17] um if if you need directions they just
[1:13:19] ask any of the locals there we're
[1:13:21] obviously all very familiar with with
[1:13:23] that so um suppers or food will be
[1:13:26] served there and then another really
[1:13:28] important practical thing is
[1:13:31] um if I remember and if we remember the
[1:13:36] idea is that we will say grace over the
[1:13:38] food here before we leave
[1:13:40] um and the reason for that is that as
[1:13:42] you get to the War Memorial Hall please
[1:13:45] go directly get your food and you can
[1:13:48] duck in so long
[1:13:50] um so that you um so so really just a
[1:13:54] bit of pressure on the number of
[1:13:55] comfortable seats available they for us
[1:13:58] to sit and eat so that as you get there
[1:14:01] have your food and then if when you see
[1:14:04] the the tables are running out of spaces
[1:14:06] then you can maybe just move on a little
[1:14:08] bit to give another wave of people an
[1:14:10] opportunity to sit at the tables
[1:14:12] obviously that won't be an issue tonight
[1:14:14] but maybe towards Sunday that that will
[1:14:16] become a little bit of an issue there so
[1:14:18] if you understand that I'll appreciate
[1:14:20] that
[1:14:22] and then also at the War Memorial Hall
[1:14:24] the big basketball courts and and
[1:14:27] Stadium area is available for recreation
[1:14:30] so if any of the young ones want to kick
[1:14:32] a ball they obviously not doing service
[1:14:34] but between services and after Services
[1:14:37] um then feel free to to use that we have
[1:14:40] that we have access to that
[1:14:43] and then
[1:14:45] um Kick our time at the War Memorial
[1:14:47] Hall we'll we'll kind of play it by ear
[1:14:50] but we obviously want to get a rest also
[1:14:53] so that we can get maximum out of the
[1:14:54] services so we'll leave it to the the
[1:14:57] deacons to Grumble at you when it's time
[1:15:00] for you to leave but we're just kind of
[1:15:02] letting you know that brother John is
[1:15:04] pointing at Brother Bruce Brother Bruce
[1:15:06] Will Grumble when it's time for you to
[1:15:07] leave but yeah at some point we'll we'll
[1:15:10] probably close that up just in the
[1:15:12] services here I want to say we'll we'll
[1:15:14] uh we'll sing couple of songs afterwards
[1:15:16] and then this mess Simon so just just
[1:15:19] take note of that and then those of you
[1:15:23] who want to stay and keep on worshiping
[1:15:25] feel free to do that you know we'll say
[1:15:27] grace over the food dismiss and then
[1:15:29] then you can keep on singing not quite
[1:15:33] as long as you want to but quite long
[1:15:40] we'll try not to to take food into the
[1:15:43] gymnasium as far as possible whether
[1:15:45] permitting will trust trust that that
[1:15:47] works here
[1:15:50] um then there's something else I would
[1:15:52] like to share can you put that
[1:15:53] PowerPoint on for me Justin
[1:15:57] um so I'm sorry to to do this to you and
[1:15:59] please forgive me I hope this doesn't
[1:16:01] frustrate you upsake you but there's a
[1:16:03] there's a mission
[1:16:05] um opportunity that I want to share with
[1:16:08] you and I want to ask while we have
[1:16:11] visitors here over this weekend if the
[1:16:14] Lord places on your heart to support
[1:16:16] this financially we would be
[1:16:18] appreciative of that obviously the whole
[1:16:20] point is not to leave here to to give us
[1:16:23] money for something but this is a worthy
[1:16:26] call so when
[1:16:27] um I'll just give you a little bit of
[1:16:29] background and then just show you a few
[1:16:30] pictures so brother petio many of you
[1:16:33] have met him uh very dedicated lovely
[1:16:36] humble brother from from Vanuatu and he
[1:16:39] he had a beautiful Church
[1:16:42] um and I can't remember the island but
[1:16:44] there was a volcano on that island and
[1:16:47] they had to evacuate the whole island a
[1:16:49] few years ago and his church basically
[1:16:51] dispersed some of the church went with
[1:16:54] him to Santo another the island to a
[1:16:57] town called lugenville and they have
[1:17:00] they are at the moment gathering in his
[1:17:03] home and in in quite uncomfortable
[1:17:06] circumstances and they are too many
[1:17:09] people really for for the home and so on
[1:17:12] and he's started building a little
[1:17:14] church
[1:17:15] and he needs
[1:17:19] um I think
[1:17:21] memory serves me right still around 12
[1:17:24] 000 New Zealand if if I can remember
[1:17:26] right
[1:17:28] um dollars to to finish this church
[1:17:31] building so what I would like to ask and
[1:17:33] maybe I'll just show you the pictures
[1:17:34] first
[1:17:35] so these uh brother pith Hill and
[1:17:38] brother Adrian when we were there
[1:17:39] recently so you can see how far they are
[1:17:42] with the place already
[1:17:45] there's just a few pictures of what it
[1:17:47] looks like so far
[1:17:49] you'll see I've put a poster up there by
[1:17:52] the by the table with the message
[1:17:53] material also
[1:17:57] so as you can see a really small little
[1:17:59] little place
[1:18:01] um but
[1:18:03] um that would be sufficient for them
[1:18:06] so what I would like to ask is if anyone
[1:18:09] feel to support this can you please I
[1:18:13] need to explain this now
[1:18:14] um can you please we've got an offering
[1:18:16] Boxley at the back but can you maybe
[1:18:19] just give us cash in an envelope and
[1:18:22] write on the Vanuatu if if you do that
[1:18:25] and just to answer that question before
[1:18:28] you ask it the reason why we're asking
[1:18:30] cash is with the charity rules that have
[1:18:34] come in over the last few years we are
[1:18:37] limited to how much money we can spend
[1:18:39] on overseas work and especially
[1:18:41] religious Mission work
[1:18:43] so we we have found and and I won't
[1:18:48] share the detail of that right now but
[1:18:50] we found a way to get the money there if
[1:18:53] we get it in cash now of course we'll
[1:18:55] we'll be very responsible with that
[1:18:57] money it will be recorded properly and
[1:18:59] we'll deal with it as as detailed as as
[1:19:03] we can and have all the recording of
[1:19:05] that money and so forth but it's just
[1:19:07] not going to officially go through the
[1:19:09] charity what that does mean is that we
[1:19:12] won't be issuing you with a receipt for
[1:19:14] that money to claim from the ird because
[1:19:18] it's not going through a charity
[1:19:21] so I trust that's that's clear and I
[1:19:24] trust that the the motive and the
[1:19:26] purpose for that is also clear for you
[1:19:29] so if you would like to support this
[1:19:30] that would be that would be really
[1:19:32] appreciated these Saints the wonderful
[1:19:35] Saints believing the same message we do
[1:19:37] with the depth of understanding of the
[1:19:39] message and just a just a lovely spirit
[1:19:42] and everything I can highly recommend
[1:19:45] them so if you are if the Lord is
[1:19:48] tugging on your heart to support it in
[1:19:49] any way we will really appreciate that
[1:19:53] praise the Lord so I think that's um
[1:19:56] probably everything I needed to say
[1:19:59] anything that I forgot anyone
[1:20:02] any questions
[1:20:04] no praise the Lord I don't want to take
[1:20:06] unnecessary time while the time flies
[1:20:08] real quick
[1:20:10] so then of course I want to welcome
[1:20:12] brother Marcus
[1:20:13] very special friend and a very special
[1:20:15] brother
[1:20:22] and just really looking forward to how
[1:20:24] the Lord is going to use the gift in our
[1:20:26] brother and we've had we've had
[1:20:28] magnificent Fellowship over the last day
[1:20:30] or so and just really really appreciate
[1:20:33] you my brother and be free speak about
[1:20:35] the little places on your heart and just
[1:20:37] have your Liberty my brother
[1:20:39] so what we're going to do now is I'm
[1:20:41] going to hand back to brother Simon with
[1:20:44] a song

[1:23:08] me so I trusted the blessing

[1:32:50] wishing you God's blessing thank you
[1:32:51] very much for the wonderful songs
[1:32:57] in the Book of Matthew
[1:33:00] Matthew 21
[1:33:06] verse 1.
[1:33:11] Matthew 21 1.
[1:33:14] and when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem
[1:33:18] and were come to Bethpage unto the Mount
[1:33:21] of Olives then sent Jesus two disciples
[1:33:24] saying unto them go into the village
[1:33:27] over against you and straight away you
[1:33:29] would find a donkey tight and a cold
[1:33:33] with her lose them and bring them unto
[1:33:36] me and if any man say art unto you you
[1:33:40] shall say the Lord has need of them and
[1:33:44] straight away he will send them
[1:33:46] all this was done that it might be
[1:33:48] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:33:51] prophet saying tell you the daughter of
[1:33:54] Zion behold that King cometh unto thee
[1:33:57] Meek and sitting upon a donkey and a
[1:34:01] cold full of a donkey and the disciples
[1:34:05] went and did as Jesus commanded them may
[1:34:09] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[1:34:11] of his word you may be seated
[1:34:16] now I'll greet you all in the name of
[1:34:18] the Lord Jesus Christ and bring
[1:34:22] greetings from my pastor by the road
[1:34:24] World in Germany and
[1:34:26] from my family and from different
[1:34:29] brothers and sisters that know you very
[1:34:31] very well and it's a great honor for me
[1:34:34] to be here for this services for the end
[1:34:37] of the year and thank brother uh array
[1:34:41] for the nice invitation and it seems to
[1:34:44] be of the Lord normally my pastor is
[1:34:46] very keen about being the whole church
[1:34:48] at home when there is a New Year's Eve
[1:34:51] and so forth but this time he said
[1:34:53] directly it's fine for you to go and
[1:34:56] well we will lay everything into God's
[1:34:58] hands and we really trust that we God
[1:35:01] speak to us okay and as the brother said
[1:35:04] we're waiting for some people still to
[1:35:06] come that is very very perfect but I
[1:35:09] always say even if we are not too many
[1:35:10] please don't feel sorry for yourself
[1:35:12] okay
[1:35:14] so we really want that our father talks
[1:35:16] to us is it fine for you
[1:35:18] so so uh I I had a quite a number of
[1:35:23] sermons and thoughts I always prepared
[1:35:25] them new even if the title is a little
[1:35:27] bit always the same or nearly the same
[1:35:29] but almost take the time and I believe
[1:35:31] that there is some titles and some
[1:35:33] sermons before us that is helping you on
[1:35:36] on your way everybody has a certain
[1:35:38] specialty and God gave me a certain way
[1:35:41] of approach to his word and approach to
[1:35:43] his people and let me be myself if that
[1:35:46] is fine for you okay I realize I got all
[1:35:50] the services and uh because they said
[1:35:53] that man is in the airplane for just for
[1:35:55] two days to come and two days to go so
[1:35:58] don't let him sit around though I know
[1:36:00] he's very very able ministers not only
[1:36:03] but the array but brother brother Adrian
[1:36:05] and uh maybe different others so I don't
[1:36:09] know all of you but I know that there is
[1:36:12] quite a capacity and the snipers are
[1:36:15] already there so I know I cannot just
[1:36:18] preach Jesus loves you and Jesus
[1:36:19] understands and some denominational
[1:36:21] thing that will not work here I got a
[1:36:25] couple of years ago I got really some
[1:36:27] quotes of brother Adrian about the
[1:36:29] theophany really really blessed me it
[1:36:30] was really wonderful inside and and was
[1:36:33] wonderful to how we worked together and
[1:36:36] we share visions and and that was just
[1:36:38] wonderful and yes I thank you for the
[1:36:41] for the Friendship to brother Airway and
[1:36:43] um to the brother Adrian different ones
[1:36:46] and I assure that we received the Esau
[1:36:49] and I don't know brother Malcolm will
[1:36:51] come good friends may the Lord richly
[1:36:53] bless all of them the bride in New
[1:36:55] Zealand and my brothers and sisters uh I
[1:36:58] mean this is this is an International
[1:36:59] Convention it's it's kiwis and South
[1:37:03] Africans
[1:37:06] you got it okay
[1:37:09] and as we heard that that sister Arden
[1:37:13] she she had made some good decisions and
[1:37:17] we heard already soon there will be no
[1:37:19] any more smoker in in New Zealand so
[1:37:22] somebody is thinking twice about certain
[1:37:25] things and we we thank God for this we
[1:37:27] pray for the authorities this should be
[1:37:29] done that way we should be thankful to
[1:37:32] live in a country of freedom of Liberty
[1:37:34] don't be too critical they could be
[1:37:37] different
[1:37:38] last year exactly at that time I was
[1:37:40] preaching in the Ukraine and we were
[1:37:43] just thinking about having a convention
[1:37:44] for next year but these plans are
[1:37:47] already history you know so if we can
[1:37:49] gather if we can happy be free let's be
[1:37:52] thankful to God and say Lord this is a
[1:37:54] day this is my day today I don't know
[1:37:56] what tomorrow holds but I'm thankful for
[1:37:58] today okay blessed be the name of the
[1:38:01] Lord whenever I I I I will go into
[1:38:04] certain subjects um uh be pleased to
[1:38:07] understand tomorrow between the two
[1:38:09] service I will be just fast eating a
[1:38:11] little bit and then prepare for the next
[1:38:13] service but anyhow you can always ask me
[1:38:15] okay for brother Marcus did you mean
[1:38:17] this and that please understand when we
[1:38:20] are when we are dealing with a subject
[1:38:22] uh in 90 minutes you can never bring the
[1:38:26] whole balance in all things nobody can
[1:38:29] do that okay so you cannot bring every
[1:38:33] aspect okay nobody can do that it takes
[1:38:36] quite a while I have quite some services
[1:38:37] but I found that it is not enough to
[1:38:40] bring a balance in all things sometimes
[1:38:42] you're just bringing one point we try to
[1:38:45] be as balanced as possible because I
[1:38:48] realized we speak to many many people
[1:38:50] and we are we are not we don't want to
[1:38:52] be the author of confusion we want to be
[1:38:54] the author of of the help of people a
[1:38:57] sound Doctrine in a sound mind but
[1:38:59] sometimes sometimes certain things could
[1:39:02] be misunderstood and you let me know
[1:39:04] okay you please let me know brother
[1:39:05] Marcus do you mean exactly this or that
[1:39:07] I'm very happy for this because we talk
[1:39:10] to so much to too much people and we as
[1:39:13] ministers we we should never forget that
[1:39:15] one day we stand before the Lord we
[1:39:17] cannot preach our opinions for forget it
[1:39:20] if you can the time is over for
[1:39:22] preaching our opinions I mean we have to
[1:39:24] have the mind of God God has an opinion
[1:39:27] and as I always said that there's a
[1:39:29] quote that brother Brahm said you have
[1:39:31] to protect this message
[1:39:33] we protect it by leaving our own
[1:39:35] interpretations out
[1:39:37] if not nobody will know what is now
[1:39:40] Marcus perfect a personal uh a stand
[1:39:43] whenever I say something that the
[1:39:45] prophet never said that way I said this
[1:39:47] is no Marcus and you can reject it
[1:39:49] without having bad feelings about that
[1:39:52] but don't reject the message okay but
[1:39:56] you can reject my ideas about certain
[1:39:58] things for sure because I could come
[1:40:01] back next year I have another idea about
[1:40:03] the same subject
[1:40:07] so so and therefore we learn certain
[1:40:09] things in life to never make people
[1:40:12] under pressure and blessed be the name
[1:40:14] of the Lord let me just directly start
[1:40:16] okay do you feel well always felt all is
[1:40:18] well with you I feel it's a good
[1:40:20] atmosphere for the first day already I
[1:40:22] think for the musicians for the song
[1:40:24] leader for you you can lean back uh uh
[1:40:28] and and just Rejoice okay because
[1:40:31] because
[1:40:33] um
[1:40:34] many of you will not know me
[1:40:37] um just by name maybe but
[1:40:40] um brother the message that we believe
[1:40:43] does not come from America
[1:40:45] it comes from the presence of God that's
[1:40:48] what we have to understand it's not an
[1:40:50] American message that's our father
[1:40:52] talking to us
[1:40:54] the message that we believe is not a
[1:40:56] denomination why should we become
[1:40:57] denominational
[1:40:59] the message that we believe is not a
[1:41:01] cult why should I become cultish
[1:41:04] amen we see these things coming up a
[1:41:07] little bit with the Next Generation
[1:41:08] there's a lot of nonsense coming up in
[1:41:10] what we call the message frame I mean
[1:41:13] but the message will never be a
[1:41:14] denomination the message will never be a
[1:41:17] sect why should I be sectarian
[1:41:19] amen what is the message then the
[1:41:22] message is not an information
[1:41:24] the message is not a religion amen the
[1:41:27] message is our father talking to us
[1:41:30] I mean we are we are and I say this
[1:41:33] boldly but humbly at the same time we
[1:41:35] are the only religion in the world which
[1:41:38] is not a religion
[1:41:40] we're the only ones who have a father
[1:41:42] every other religions
[1:41:45] Buddha six and whatever it's fine people
[1:41:48] respect them let them be who they are
[1:41:51] but it's just a code of ethics
[1:41:54] is just a a way of life it's just a
[1:41:58] following some rules
[1:42:00] not more we have a father
[1:42:03] look all Christianity look at all the
[1:42:05] baptism whatever that's fine I will not
[1:42:08] take away salvation from for many of
[1:42:10] these people but they don't have a
[1:42:13] father
[1:42:14] they don't have a bright room they don't
[1:42:16] have a they don't have a they don't have
[1:42:18] an uh uh when your creator becomes your
[1:42:21] father they have many times a Bible and
[1:42:25] a code of ethics
[1:42:27] they have a portion of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:29] but it doesn't have to they don't have
[1:42:30] the person of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:33] they don't have the person because they
[1:42:34] don't have elieza who led the bride to
[1:42:38] that person
[1:42:39] can you say Amen we are not better but
[1:42:42] we're different
[1:42:43] you cannot compare with any denomination
[1:42:46] because we are not a denomination
[1:42:49] amen we don't have the best singers we
[1:42:51] don't have uh we don't have Jimmy
[1:42:54] swaggarts I'm gonna sing it again
[1:42:56] brother
[1:42:57] foreign
[1:43:00] we don't have the most Miracles there's
[1:43:03] people who have there's groups and
[1:43:05] denominations who have more miracles
[1:43:07] than us
[1:43:08] we don't have the most anointed people
[1:43:12] we don't have even the most numbers of
[1:43:14] people
[1:43:15] so you say if if we don't have deals in
[1:43:17] this what do we have we have thus say as
[1:43:20] the Lord
[1:43:22] amen and our many say I'm preached you
[1:43:25] into very very small group I said hey
[1:43:27] don't have don't feel don't feel now
[1:43:29] don't feel uh sorry for yourself because
[1:43:32] we are 10 people here that feel
[1:43:34] privileged
[1:43:36] if you're privileged that you're invited
[1:43:38] to the Feast of the king
[1:43:40] so we understand that the Bible became a
[1:43:43] new book through the opening of the word
[1:43:46] amen for 2000 years we never understood
[1:43:50] God
[1:43:51] we tried everything we tried we tried
[1:43:55] churchianism it never worked we tried a
[1:43:58] a legalism and it never worked we tried
[1:44:02] reformation and it never worked we even
[1:44:05] tried Pentecostalism but it never worked
[1:44:08] but the Bible says but in the days of
[1:44:11] the voice of the seventh angel
[1:44:14] the mystery of God will be revealed not
[1:44:18] Mysteries
[1:44:20] Schofield had already Mysteries
[1:44:23] but the mystery is God is opening his
[1:44:27] heart who he is
[1:44:29] how he feels
[1:44:31] how how what's in the back part of his
[1:44:34] Minds how he is a father and brother
[1:44:37] Abraham preaches the message Christ is
[1:44:40] the mystery of God revealed and if you
[1:44:44] see the nature of your father you can
[1:44:46] find out that is a Christian because
[1:44:48] he's like his father
[1:44:50] everybody can be legalistic every Muslim
[1:44:52] can be legalistic I mean to have long
[1:44:55] hair and a long dress is part of our
[1:44:57] message but it's not the message
[1:45:00] every Muslim can have long hair and long
[1:45:02] dresses and sometimes we will see it in
[1:45:05] the next Services sometimes you can have
[1:45:08] long hair long dress and long face
[1:45:13] it's not very very helpful huh
[1:45:16] so we see that did I say it always like
[1:45:19] this the message is the heart of the
[1:45:22] Bible
[1:45:24] amen now here's brother Branham and and
[1:45:27] and and brother when he was a simple man
[1:45:29] and and uh he was around people that
[1:45:31] went to uh to Bible schools and they
[1:45:35] could speak Latin and Greek and Hebrew
[1:45:37] and they told brother Brian and brother
[1:45:39] Brahm you don't know your Bible very
[1:45:41] well
[1:45:42] and we know what brother Brandon says he
[1:45:45] said maybe I don't know well very well
[1:45:47] the Bible but I know the author very
[1:45:49] well
[1:45:50] and I mean I come from a Pentecostal
[1:45:53] background for us okay know the author
[1:45:55] in the in the in the power of his
[1:45:57] resurrection let the signs and wonders
[1:45:59] come in we were a little bit that way
[1:46:01] but what did he say he said my brother
[1:46:05] if if I'm writing a book Marcus Becker
[1:46:07] writes a book you will never understand
[1:46:10] the book but if you know who I am if you
[1:46:13] know my nature if you know my heart then
[1:46:16] you understand my book
[1:46:18] you understand everybody can quote the
[1:46:21] Bible but you must understand the mind
[1:46:23] of God and now you understand the book
[1:46:25] you can read between the lines but it's
[1:46:28] the same which is in the lines but it
[1:46:30] makes sense to what is in the lines can
[1:46:33] you say Amen
[1:46:34] so we see that that that uh
[1:46:38] um that that we have here Jesus
[1:46:42] and uh
[1:46:44] it was time for the king to come and I
[1:46:48] would like the brothers if you help me a
[1:46:49] little bit with the with the first
[1:46:51] picture
[1:46:54] and I would just you know my Ministry is
[1:46:56] always liking to visualize it a little
[1:46:58] bit we have a lot of young people here
[1:46:59] and sometimes it becomes too I wouldn't
[1:47:02] call the world boring but it becomes a
[1:47:04] little bit boring
[1:47:06] foreign
[1:47:09] becomes boring okay and these pictures
[1:47:12] give you a little interpreter
[1:47:13] interpretation okay because okay
[1:47:16] so so
[1:47:18] the time came that that that that that
[1:47:21] Jesus
[1:47:23] came down from that mound of olives
[1:47:26] this is the the view to Mount of Olives
[1:47:30] and when he appeared on that Mount of
[1:47:33] Olives
[1:47:34] brother random takes that picture
[1:47:38] and he preaches the message what is the
[1:47:41] attraction on the mountain
[1:47:44] and he says on that mountain
[1:47:47] appeared Jesus on a white donkey
[1:47:52] and the question is how could brother
[1:47:53] Brandon know that it was a white donkey
[1:47:57] I mean he was a seer
[1:47:59] he could see things
[1:48:01] therefore he could see what happened in
[1:48:04] the Garden of Eden it's not clear by the
[1:48:06] Bible but the Seer sees the scenery and
[1:48:09] he then takes it back to the Bible said
[1:48:11] here it is true
[1:48:14] we had a testimony about the brother
[1:48:17] biscuit gave us one time and and he said
[1:48:20] they had a brother I think it was
[1:48:22] brother suswick and he was a hidden
[1:48:24] smoker
[1:48:25] and people didn't know that he was a
[1:48:27] hidden smoker and uh but on the camp he
[1:48:30] he was taking care of the horses
[1:48:33] and uh what happened is uh Whitey was
[1:48:36] taking care of these horses he was
[1:48:38] secretly smoking and the church didn't
[1:48:42] know but he and everybody thought he's
[1:48:44] just a kind brother but he had his
[1:48:46] second second thought about that
[1:48:48] so he was smoking secretly and brother
[1:48:50] Sussman says I came back to that camp
[1:48:53] and I arranged something in the kitchen
[1:48:55] and brother Brennan was laying like this
[1:48:58] in his tent he said Hey Brother Sussman
[1:49:01] for how long are you a Believer he said
[1:49:04] oh brother answer many many years I go
[1:49:06] to church
[1:49:07] and it was some minutes past past away
[1:49:11] your past
[1:49:12] and brother man laying there he said
[1:49:13] brother Sussman but I think brother Fred
[1:49:16] he says uh did you ever smoke when you
[1:49:20] were an unbeliever
[1:49:21] and he said yes and he just continued to
[1:49:24] work in the kitchen and after some
[1:49:27] minutes brother Brian just shouted to
[1:49:28] him and said brother brother brother
[1:49:30] brother brother brother Fred when did
[1:49:32] you stop smoking
[1:49:34] and brother Fred said right now
[1:49:38] and he said this he said he knew that
[1:49:41] brother Brahm saw him
[1:49:44] but you see God is a gentleman
[1:49:47] God is correcting us but he's never
[1:49:49] hurting our feelings
[1:49:51] but but but he saw him so so so how much
[1:49:55] can we see how how he saw the scenery
[1:49:57] now Jesus was sending his disciple to a
[1:50:01] to a uh to some donkeys I know the the
[1:50:05] Bible says another expression but I'm a
[1:50:07] German with my accent anyhow and if if
[1:50:09] I'm pronouncing this in the wrong way
[1:50:12] then we have a then we have a message
[1:50:15] for this evening okay
[1:50:16] then then I will be on YouTube tomorrow
[1:50:19] okay
[1:50:20] so let's call it a donkey okay
[1:50:25] I'm happy that I feel already you have
[1:50:28] that kind of humor
[1:50:31] I'm I'm I'm not a clown not at all but
[1:50:33] but humor breaks the ice you know but
[1:50:36] humor makes people comfortable and I
[1:50:38] mean this is the house of God you feel
[1:50:40] home exactly so so what happens is he
[1:50:45] send them to these donkeys and Jesus
[1:50:47] knows exactly where they are
[1:50:49] and he says and if you will ask about
[1:50:52] his donkeys he said the Lord is in need
[1:50:54] of them
[1:50:55] so you must understand that for the
[1:50:58] world you are nothing else than a donkey
[1:51:02] with those long hair and somebody else
[1:51:05] what are you doing for the end of the
[1:51:06] year that you say I go to church okay
[1:51:08] another donkey we have party but these
[1:51:11] donkeys they are just listening and
[1:51:13] somebody's just shouting at them and
[1:51:15] whatever
[1:51:16] but it's not not important what the
[1:51:19] world thinks about you it's so important
[1:51:21] that you find your place
[1:51:24] that you are proud of yourself of Who
[1:51:28] You Are standing for it
[1:51:31] so they find these donkeys and they are
[1:51:34] arising on the summit of Mount of Olives
[1:51:38] and here they were standing and brother
[1:51:40] Abraham said what happened on on on on
[1:51:42] on on Mount of Olives he said history
[1:51:45] was made
[1:51:47] prophecy was fulfilled
[1:51:50] and when he was just writing down Meek
[1:51:54] and humble
[1:51:56] from that
[1:51:58] Mount of Olives
[1:52:01] he he there was a crowd waiting for him
[1:52:04] and brother Brian said this he said they
[1:52:07] were all in expectation he said some
[1:52:10] were for him
[1:52:13] some mostly most they were against him
[1:52:16] but some were in between
[1:52:20] and
[1:52:22] they were just waiting for him to come
[1:52:24] down and I always tell the question if
[1:52:26] you want to if you want to preach
[1:52:29] doctrinally
[1:52:31] you must be keeping a balance if not you
[1:52:34] end up in a dead end and it's so hard
[1:52:36] for a preacher to to to admit mistakes
[1:52:41] and it's so hard sometimes for a church
[1:52:43] to admit mistakes or to forget forgive
[1:52:47] mistakes of a minister because I always
[1:52:49] say this now aren't that donkey who was
[1:52:51] sitting on that donkey the lamb or the
[1:52:53] lion
[1:52:55] said both at the same time
[1:52:58] I mean because the prophecy says behold
[1:53:01] daughter signed your king
[1:53:04] coming down on a donkey at the same time
[1:53:07] he was the lamp taking away
[1:53:11] the sins of the world
[1:53:13] so pay attention when we when when we're
[1:53:16] nailing certain things down
[1:53:19] the deeper you clinch down a nail the
[1:53:22] more you have to make effort to remove
[1:53:24] that same nail if you clinch it down too
[1:53:27] deep
[1:53:27] because we grow in Revelation
[1:53:30] and these people and why he is coming
[1:53:33] down
[1:53:34] the Bible says in uh
[1:53:37] second Moses in in Exodus 13 verse 13
[1:53:41] I'm just quoting it in myself he says
[1:53:44] you have to kill the firstborn of of of
[1:53:49] um
[1:53:50] um of a donkey
[1:53:53] if you kill it
[1:53:55] and if you don't kill it you have to
[1:53:58] take a lamp instead as a sacrifice for
[1:54:02] the Donkey
[1:54:03] now how could these people stand there
[1:54:06] and and just shout Hosanna who comes in
[1:54:10] the name of the Lord because they could
[1:54:13] now take a Biblical picture in the
[1:54:17] modern events and could see this is
[1:54:19] scripture fulfilled
[1:54:21] because now here's a donkey sitting or a
[1:54:25] lamb sitting on a donkey and they could
[1:54:27] make it out he said this must be the
[1:54:29] Redeemer for Jerusalem
[1:54:31] amen they were not just sitting and
[1:54:35] ah I'm not talking now about I'm not
[1:54:39] talking about emotionalism come on let's
[1:54:41] a little bit I mean
[1:54:43] Jimmy Swagger can do this
[1:54:47] shout a little bit of a noise I want to
[1:54:49] hear
[1:54:52] it must be
[1:54:56] how you call it uh
[1:54:59] stimulation by revelation
[1:55:02] and you can be sitting there very very
[1:55:04] quiet and still you are stimulated
[1:55:08] anointing and noise is a difference
[1:55:12] because when Jesus was sitting down to
[1:55:15] preach these noble words uh uh on Mount
[1:55:19] of of of Beatitudes but remember him
[1:55:22] said he was sitting down but noble words
[1:55:24] proceeded out of his mouth and he was
[1:55:27] fully anointed
[1:55:28] but he was not that type of charismatic
[1:55:31] preachers now come on say your name
[1:55:35] amen must our heart must say Amen but
[1:55:38] when they saw it on the other hand side
[1:55:41] they were not just standing there
[1:55:43] and said oh wow that's the Messiah
[1:55:46] that's great that's deep man
[1:55:48] we never heard it like this that's
[1:55:49] tremendous I mean it's they took their
[1:55:53] their clothes and throw it on the floor
[1:55:55] and said praise me to God
[1:55:58] blessed be the who is coming in the name
[1:56:00] of the Lords
[1:56:02] some that we have young people and I
[1:56:06] would certainly go in the next Services
[1:56:07] about that fact
[1:56:09] that Pentecostal searching emotionalism
[1:56:14] and sometime our people they say we
[1:56:16] don't want emotionless we want the words
[1:56:19] and they think they are better
[1:56:22] but some of the people they don't search
[1:56:23] the word they search the kick
[1:56:26] you must preach something that nobody
[1:56:28] else preached before that way
[1:56:31] in a sense that even brother Branham
[1:56:33] ever said it and then people say wow
[1:56:35] that was the word no that was the kick
[1:56:38] that we got something special very
[1:56:40] special amen they're in the same
[1:56:43] category because the words will change
[1:56:46] us
[1:56:47] the rest is just enthusiasm about the
[1:56:50] kick
[1:56:51] amen sometimes young people come and
[1:56:54] they say brother Marcus man we come from
[1:56:56] a convention and we heard things I mean
[1:56:58] I mean that was tremendous it was deep
[1:57:00] and then I say okay what did you
[1:57:02] understand is it nothing
[1:57:05] and then they say and and he said things
[1:57:09] that we never heard before I said yes
[1:57:11] because you never heard it before
[1:57:13] because brother Brian never said it
[1:57:15] therefore you never heard it before
[1:57:18] amen but we're not called
[1:57:21] to just impress people
[1:57:25] and then everybody claps on our shoulder
[1:57:27] and said my as a mighty man it was
[1:57:29] tremendous it was tremendous we want
[1:57:31] people that say I I have a change in my
[1:57:34] life
[1:57:37] and changes I I have a father and now
[1:57:40] I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm transformed exactly
[1:57:42] in that image
[1:57:43] can you say Amen
[1:57:45] so so so they were just enthused about
[1:57:49] that
[1:57:50] because they find the time in which they
[1:57:53] were living
[1:57:55] this is the view now from the Mount of
[1:57:58] Olives down to Jerusalem
[1:58:02] the only problem is the building
[1:58:05] okay in the time of Jesus it was the
[1:58:09] time where the the Temple of Solomon was
[1:58:11] there
[1:58:13] and we are looking now straight west
[1:58:17] from the Mount of Olives to the temple
[1:58:21] in Jerusalem straight west and brother
[1:58:23] Ryan said oh I have it in mind that
[1:58:25] brother Brian said it that way he said
[1:58:27] when you open the door
[1:58:29] of the temple you could see even the
[1:58:31] curtain of the high of the holies the
[1:58:33] holies
[1:58:35] you go straight west right now
[1:58:38] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:58:41] so he came down
[1:58:43] on that donkey and went directly to his
[1:58:46] Temple
[1:58:48] so there is a meaning behind it
[1:58:52] because what happened is this brother
[1:58:54] Remy said uh the coming of Christ of the
[1:58:57] son of man is like is going from the
[1:59:00] East to the West
[1:59:03] and he says like the sun traveled from
[1:59:06] the East to the West he said the
[1:59:07] messenger traveled from the East to the
[1:59:10] West
[1:59:12] and it went over three seas
[1:59:14] Mediterranean Sea Atlantic Ocean or art
[1:59:18] channeled to England and the Atlantic
[1:59:20] Ocean and brother Brahm said
[1:59:22] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:59:25] the Holy Ghost but that was not the end
[1:59:31] because brother Branham was born on the
[1:59:34] east coast of America
[1:59:36] when you see the picture of the pillar
[1:59:38] of fire then then it was made by a Kodak
[1:59:42] Eastman film
[1:59:46] the woman the witch
[1:59:49] that could determine the date of birth
[1:59:51] of brother Ibraham he said you are
[1:59:53] you're you're born under a certain sign
[1:59:55] there's a star there's a light following
[1:59:57] you what did she say
[1:59:59] she said your success will be in the
[2:00:02] West
[2:00:04] and brother man Remembered in in the
[2:00:06] message sirs is this the time
[2:00:09] he said it's now time to go to the West
[2:00:14] amen
[2:00:15] that which that that Medium said your
[2:00:18] success will be in the west all these
[2:00:21] Ministry brother Brian was in the east
[2:00:23] 500 000 people in in in in Bombay India
[2:00:27] so much people in Durban South Africa we
[2:00:31] would say this is Success this is great
[2:00:34] ministry
[2:00:36] but what is great in the eyes of man is
[2:00:39] sometimes small in God's eyes
[2:00:43] and what is small in men's eyes is great
[2:00:46] in God's eyes
[2:00:47] because all these people who were healed
[2:00:49] in Durban if they didn't give their
[2:00:51] heart to the Lord they are all dead
[2:00:54] amen but the opening of the word of the
[2:00:58] word is something
[2:00:59] Eternal for the bride
[2:01:01] it's the minority of quantity but it's
[2:01:05] bringing the whole church up
[2:01:07] Hallelujah so what happens is this that
[2:01:11] we find out that the Garden of Eden was
[2:01:14] in the area of
[2:01:16] ham I think even brother Ben wasn't
[2:01:18] wasn't wasn't very clear not North North
[2:01:21] North North Africa up to uh uh a Tigris
[2:01:26] river Euphrates River that's what the
[2:01:28] Bible says in that area of what we call
[2:01:31] the near East
[2:01:33] according to Jewish tradition the gates
[2:01:36] of the Garden of Eden was exactly where
[2:01:40] the Temple Mount is
[2:01:45] the Great it's the stone what they said
[2:01:48] the stone between uh where Revelation
[2:01:52] comes from the Eternal for the world
[2:01:55] therefore it has a higher signification
[2:01:58] when Jesus said amen your name is Peter
[2:02:02] and Upon This Rock
[2:02:05] amen I will build my church because
[2:02:06] according to Jewish tradition exactly
[2:02:09] where the temple Dome is right now that
[2:02:11] is the rock where Revelation where
[2:02:13] eternity or where Heaven meets with the
[2:02:15] Earth
[2:02:16] for them it is a local place
[2:02:20] for us it's a place in our hearts
[2:02:23] blessed be the name of the Lord but
[2:02:25] here's what happens he said he
[2:02:29] when when when when when Cain left the
[2:02:32] Garden of Eden he went East that's what
[2:02:34] the Bible says and it's exactly so the
[2:02:36] Bible is right because because uh the
[2:02:40] first civilization was China in the east
[2:02:45] and the Bible says this Cain left the
[2:02:49] presence of the Lord
[2:02:51] and the prophet said that is the proof
[2:02:54] that the presence of God was not only in
[2:02:56] heaven but it was on Earth already
[2:02:59] because how can you leave the presence
[2:03:02] of God
[2:03:03] if the presence of God is not there it
[2:03:06] was exactly at the altar is what exactly
[2:03:09] at the gate at the door and brother
[2:03:11] Brian said there he made his mistake
[2:03:15] there is where people make their
[2:03:17] mistakes when things are going wrong
[2:03:19] they are leaving the church they stay
[2:03:21] home they want to stream a little bit
[2:03:23] here in a stream a little bit there and
[2:03:25] this and this is the time where you
[2:03:27] should come into the house of the Lords
[2:03:31] when everything goes wrong when you did
[2:03:33] the biggest mistakes in your life that's
[2:03:35] the time to talk to your father
[2:03:38] that is where people again make that big
[2:03:41] mistake
[2:03:42] so we see there is a progression there
[2:03:45] is a far justification sanctification
[2:03:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother
[2:03:51] Brian said makes way for the person of
[2:03:52] the Holy Ghost
[2:03:54] blessed be the name of the Lord that is
[2:03:56] where Pentecost will have their big
[2:03:57] problems
[2:03:59] so here we see Jesus
[2:04:02] coming
[2:04:04] and and and and uh brother Branham in
[2:04:08] the message what is the attraction on
[2:04:10] the mountain he is now projecting what
[2:04:14] happened on Mount of Olives he's
[2:04:16] projecting in our time
[2:04:19] he shows a parallel he says oh there
[2:04:22] will be a true former and letter reign
[2:04:25] in the last days upon that little group
[2:04:27] that come with him on this little donkey
[2:04:30] low and humble no denomination and I
[2:04:34] always say this no denomination in the
[2:04:37] message or outside of the message
[2:04:39] crying Hosanna to the king that comes in
[2:04:42] the name of the Lord what's the matter
[2:04:44] today what is the attraction on the
[2:04:45] mount what does he speak about Mount
[2:04:47] sunset
[2:04:51] what happened on Mount Sun said the king
[2:04:54] came down
[2:04:55] the words came down the light came down
[2:05:00] amen
[2:05:02] can you say Amen
[2:05:05] amen I hope that we don't have just a
[2:05:07] picture of the cloud in our in our in
[2:05:10] our bedroom in our in our dining room
[2:05:12] and don't know what it is
[2:05:14] it's the coming of Christ
[2:05:16] it's Revelation chapter 10 one fulfilled
[2:05:20] a greater than Solomon is here
[2:05:23] why should I go back to another age if
[2:05:26] the king of all Kings is here
[2:05:28] why should I have Nostalgia about
[2:05:30] Pentecostalism whatever if we are in
[2:05:33] living a time like never before
[2:05:36] I always tell the young people I said
[2:05:38] look brother Branham said it like this
[2:05:41] he said God shows first in the heavens
[2:05:46] what he's doing on Earth
[2:05:48] so please don't waste your time trying
[2:05:51] to find your theophany in the in
[2:05:55] in in that Circle
[2:05:58] because there's already too many people
[2:06:00] trying to find that theophany in it
[2:06:04] it's like it's like sometime and you
[2:06:07] forgive me that kind of humor
[2:06:09] sometimes people believe in in in
[2:06:10] rebirth I was another person uh born
[2:06:15] thousands of years ago and you can bring
[2:06:17] them into any kind of of conditions you
[2:06:21] can use hypnosis
[2:06:23] and under hypnosis they reveal what type
[2:06:26] of person they were and they were always
[2:06:28] Cleopatra
[2:06:31] [Laughter]
[2:06:35] I was Julius Caesar I was this and I was
[2:06:38] dead and nobody was a farmer
[2:06:42] and and and you understand people want
[2:06:44] to be special and people wanna and
[2:06:48] but one thing is true I mean maybe you
[2:06:50] find your theophany right in it we will
[2:06:52] deal in the next days about that but one
[2:06:55] thing is sure now and now brother Ben
[2:06:57] never understood that picture
[2:06:59] but you have to understand according to
[2:07:02] the message we have this is a double
[2:07:04] picture
[2:07:05] okay rainbow means that means brother
[2:07:08] Brandon was a star in the night
[2:07:12] he was the seventh Church age Angel and
[2:07:15] the star is shining in the night
[2:07:18] but there was a changing of dispensation
[2:07:22] there was a changing of ministry there
[2:07:25] was a changing of time
[2:07:27] so that brother Branham started 1964
[2:07:29] what does he say shalom good morning
[2:07:32] church what does he say the night is
[2:07:34] over
[2:07:38] good morning in Finnish
[2:07:41] salaam the night is over good morning
[2:07:43] what does it mean the night is over
[2:07:48] and brother Birmingham said this there's
[2:07:50] a man who can turn on the light he said
[2:07:52] he said the the son is the king of all
[2:07:55] lights
[2:07:57] the night is over who appears the king
[2:08:00] of all Kings the son himself
[2:08:03] the church is just a reflection it's
[2:08:05] just like the Moon
[2:08:06] so we don't live in the darkness today
[2:08:08] we live in in in in in the day of our
[2:08:11] light
[2:08:13] and you turn the picture to the right
[2:08:15] and you find out Hoffman's head of
[2:08:18] Christ what does it mean God shows in
[2:08:20] the heaven what he does on Earth there
[2:08:21] is a church now who received their head
[2:08:27] their Capstone their headstone the
[2:08:31] church is not with without leadership
[2:08:32] anymore
[2:08:34] can you say Amen
[2:08:36] it's a special time it's it went
[2:08:40] sometimes you know I was in the world
[2:08:43] for many many years all my life we were
[2:08:46] not Christians at that time
[2:08:48] I showed you different time I was a
[2:08:51] Michael Jackson fan I could dance like
[2:08:53] Michael J I could make the the moon walk
[2:08:55] but I promised my family not to do it
[2:08:57] behind the pulpit okay but I could do
[2:09:00] that really in discotheque and whatever
[2:09:01] and Mr Robot and we but this was it was
[2:09:04] our time
[2:09:05] I know that I'm repeating myself but but
[2:09:08] let me just talk a little bit from heart
[2:09:10] to heart
[2:09:11] yeah I'm I'm I was I was smaller like
[2:09:15] all the girls in my class
[2:09:17] for many many years since Omar you I was
[2:09:20] smaller and just a little teeny boy
[2:09:21] which is okay God allowed these things
[2:09:24] and I was fan of of Arnold
[2:09:27] Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone
[2:09:30] and I remember one time I saw Arnold
[2:09:32] Schwarzenegger I think it was Conan and
[2:09:34] and he was just using his breast muscle
[2:09:39] so so I so I started bodybuilding
[2:09:43] foreign
[2:09:45] like this I know that I'm repeating
[2:09:47] myself because I always say he always
[2:09:49] comes in my mind without preparing
[2:09:51] myself as you understand I'm always
[2:09:52] preaching without notes I have my
[2:09:54] preparation with the things all the rest
[2:09:56] is just in between what God puts on my
[2:09:58] heart okay but you don't have to that's
[2:10:00] my way of preaching
[2:10:01] I always say this everything that you
[2:10:03] see here
[2:10:05] was here
[2:10:07] true honest honest
[2:10:11] it's just it's just a changing of
[2:10:13] dispensation
[2:10:16] foreign
[2:10:18] so therefore young boy
[2:10:21] you can make bodybuilding but don't
[2:10:22] invest too much time in it because you
[2:10:24] end up like this
[2:10:26] definitely so okay
[2:10:29] so I remember I I I'm a bodybuilding and
[2:10:32] I went before the mirror and nothing
[2:10:34] moved
[2:10:37] but I found out as a young person
[2:10:39] already exactly what brother Brahman
[2:10:41] says
[2:10:43] he says he says the natural types of
[2:10:45] spiritual if you want to have muscles
[2:10:48] you cannot eat McDonald's
[2:10:52] you need a steak
[2:10:55] and if I do a favor to brother to
[2:10:57] brother areas that you need a keto steak
[2:11:01] [Laughter]
[2:11:03] no matter what stake
[2:11:07] if you want to have muscles you cannot
[2:11:10] eat McDonald's
[2:11:12] if you want to have spiritual muscles
[2:11:14] you cannot eat Facebook
[2:11:17] you cannot eat Harry Potter
[2:11:20] and what you need is spiritual food in
[2:11:23] due season
[2:11:25] to have a real
[2:11:27] muscle man on the inside
[2:11:30] brother man said uh faith has hair on
[2:11:34] his chest
[2:11:36] I mean I remember I was in the U.S and I
[2:11:38] said a face has hair on his breast
[2:11:42] and then the brother said we understand
[2:11:44] you are a German but please use the
[2:11:46] right kind of words yeah I would do no
[2:11:47] problem
[2:11:49] but he says have to have hair on his
[2:11:52] chest
[2:11:53] that means you must eat some spiritual
[2:11:56] food
[2:11:57] so that muscles can grow
[2:12:01] so we see that that
[2:12:07] if I see the next one so we see it's a
[2:12:10] special time that we live
[2:12:12] I mean it's a time of of what we call
[2:12:17] the bride age
[2:12:19] it's not an eighth age we don't have
[2:12:22] eight
[2:12:23] Church ages
[2:12:25] but what happens the heads
[2:12:30] set himself upon the body that means the
[2:12:34] Capstone set himself upon the church
[2:12:39] there's no Gap
[2:12:41] so we are in the seventh churches which
[2:12:43] is the loudest sea in church age
[2:12:45] but we are not in darkness
[2:12:48] we're not blind
[2:12:50] we are not wretched because we're in
[2:12:52] bright age
[2:12:54] part of laodice he has no contradiction
[2:12:56] amen is look at this here's brother
[2:13:00] Brian he explains himself he says now
[2:13:02] friends I believe that he is the same
[2:13:04] yesterday today and forever I believe
[2:13:07] he's just as able this afternoon to
[2:13:09] cause in his building a and look at the
[2:13:12] word a paradox
[2:13:14] because that he promised it would happen
[2:13:17] and how much more has he promised how
[2:13:19] much more is it leaving in the Bible to
[2:13:22] this very age that we are living the
[2:13:25] Ephesian age of the church ages
[2:13:28] we got seven church and we are promised
[2:13:31] that at the loud is here Church age
[2:13:33] there would be another Ephesian aha
[2:13:38] exactly where brother Graham says it
[2:13:41] Lord now you put on your spiritual
[2:13:43] jacket brother blame him not never said
[2:13:45] we wouldn't have another Ephesus
[2:13:48] because Ephesus is is aim and relaxed
[2:13:52] but we will have an Ephesian
[2:13:55] there's a difference and our brother
[2:13:58] Mark is what is the difference Ephesians
[2:14:00] we read for every marriage
[2:14:03] we read Ephesians I think chapter five
[2:14:06] husbands love your wife
[2:14:09] amen because a type is a mystery it's a
[2:14:12] secret says Paul but you type it on the
[2:14:15] church and on Christ
[2:14:17] so what is that time of if Ephesians
[2:14:19] it's a marriage
[2:14:21] between the invisible bride room and the
[2:14:25] and and or the Heavenly bright when the
[2:14:27] Earthly bright
[2:14:28] the church gets her head it's a marriage
[2:14:31] time
[2:14:33] it's a time like never before
[2:14:35] therefore God showed the Hoffman's head
[2:14:39] of Christ and he does it in the air to
[2:14:41] show that's what I'm doing right now
[2:14:45] but it's not a public show
[2:14:48] it is individual it's for you
[2:14:51] it's for those who wait for his coming
[2:14:56] can you say Amen
[2:14:58] so we see that if I continue
[2:15:03] in that way that when the ministry of
[2:15:07] brother Branham
[2:15:09] started
[2:15:11] you have to understand that brother
[2:15:14] Brahm was like David
[2:15:17] all of Israel they were afraid of
[2:15:21] Goliath
[2:15:23] but when David came
[2:15:26] and had that Revelation and he slew
[2:15:29] Goliath
[2:15:31] that the Bible says all Israel now start
[2:15:34] to to to to to to have Warfare against
[2:15:37] the Philistines
[2:15:39] and the ministry of brother Branham
[2:15:41] comes and here is somebody who cannot
[2:15:44] pronounce his English
[2:15:47] therefore please when you read the
[2:15:48] message you must read it with your
[2:15:50] hearts
[2:15:51] brother Brahms sometimes was mixing
[2:15:53] words and mixing sentences
[2:15:55] I think on one time I would I try to
[2:15:58] check it out but he said Berlin is the
[2:16:00] capital of Switzerland something like
[2:16:02] this
[2:16:03] I mean I will not repeat this this was
[2:16:05] the man William Branham
[2:16:09] that was not God no not known geography
[2:16:12] there was the man who was nervous behind
[2:16:14] the pulpits
[2:16:16] don't if if something is that he says is
[2:16:20] is not that way in the Bible then
[2:16:23] just say that was the man who was
[2:16:26] nervous not more
[2:16:28] you don't have to repeat all things that
[2:16:30] are wrong
[2:16:31] when it comes that he was misplacing
[2:16:34] some words of scripture or whatever not
[2:16:36] not at all
[2:16:38] huh
[2:16:39] but here comes that simple many and and
[2:16:42] and and and and and
[2:16:44] he's the greatest messenger of all
[2:16:48] because there's two Messengers they are
[2:16:50] outstanding Paul and brother Brandon
[2:16:52] Paul was the only one who could add to
[2:16:55] the Bible
[2:16:57] all the rest were just reformers they
[2:16:59] could just point back to Paul
[2:17:01] but brother Brandon was the only one who
[2:17:03] could open the Seven Seals
[2:17:06] amen
[2:17:08] Paul was the one who could lay the
[2:17:10] foundation
[2:17:11] as a wise master builder but brother
[2:17:14] Brandon brought the Capstone upon upon
[2:17:16] the building
[2:17:18] two were special
[2:17:20] but we are not brenamites we're
[2:17:23] Christians
[2:17:25] we're not Brandon fans
[2:17:27] we're Christians
[2:17:29] my savior is Jesus Christ
[2:17:31] can you say Amen
[2:17:33] amen but what happened is like every
[2:17:36] father is the head of his own home
[2:17:39] every Pastor is the head of a local
[2:17:41] church
[2:17:42] I'm under a headship I have a pastor as
[2:17:45] an older man it's brother wrote the
[2:17:46] world
[2:17:47] some of the things I see a little bit
[2:17:49] different than him but I would never
[2:17:51] misuse the pulpit to bring discredit to
[2:17:54] the man I must find my role
[2:17:58] but we are not in a sect sometimes we
[2:18:00] talk with one another I said brother
[2:18:01] yeah to be honest I see a difference
[2:18:04] but brother Brandon said everything that
[2:18:06] has more than one heads is a monster
[2:18:10] quote brother Brennan so one is the
[2:18:13] final voice for the church because one
[2:18:15] day you will stand for God for the local
[2:18:17] church not me
[2:18:19] I can give you an advice but I will
[2:18:21] never try to interfere to Sublime
[2:18:23] whatever you say because then I will
[2:18:25] stand before God one day
[2:18:27] we have to know our calling our position
[2:18:29] and in our calling is a limitation
[2:18:33] if I don't see it my ministry will never
[2:18:36] be successful I will stand in my own way
[2:18:40] all my life
[2:18:41] but if a normal limitation I can fill it
[2:18:45] up to the maximum
[2:18:46] huh so a pastor is the head of his local
[2:18:52] church
[2:18:53] but brother Branham uh the messenger is
[2:18:56] the head of a church age
[2:18:59] therefore there will be a people
[2:19:03] who will be the final voice for the
[2:19:05] final age and brother Graham said this
[2:19:07] under their messenger
[2:19:12] quote brother Lynn so therefore I am not
[2:19:15] in
[2:19:16] to heal my tapes honestly not
[2:19:20] because I say
[2:19:23] if you have time why don't you listen to
[2:19:26] The Prophet's voice
[2:19:28] amen we are not promoting our names
[2:19:31] what for amen
[2:19:34] but the head of all seven Messengers is
[2:19:39] Christ himself
[2:19:41] I was one time to ask the question he
[2:19:43] said brother Marcus does somebody have
[2:19:44] the right to correct the prophet I said
[2:19:46] sure God has a right
[2:19:50] but not us
[2:19:52] I'm in because if not we are we are
[2:19:55] misrespecting headship but God also the
[2:19:57] Bible he was correcting His prophets
[2:20:00] sometimes their men dwell Here Comes
[2:20:02] Nathan he goes to David he said David
[2:20:04] praise the Lord build that building it
[2:20:06] seems wonderful in the night God comes
[2:20:07] to him and said hey stop that nonsense
[2:20:11] go back to him and tell him I said in my
[2:20:14] own in my own words amen
[2:20:16] so you see when the ministry of brother
[2:20:18] Branham Comes Here Comes others are a
[2:20:21] robots I mean here is a man like like
[2:20:23] like uh not A.A Allen uh Tommy Osborne
[2:20:27] he was sitting and he said I saw Jesus
[2:20:30] in the Bible I saw Jesus in in Walking
[2:20:33] In Alfred and I saw Jesus and the Man by
[2:20:35] the name of William Branham and when he
[2:20:37] saw him in Oregon he said I can do the
[2:20:40] same thing
[2:20:41] I heard the voice that's what Tommy
[2:20:43] Osborne says
[2:20:44] and tremendous ministers came out by the
[2:20:48] inspiration of William Branham
[2:20:51] A.A Ellen Tommy Osborne uh Aura Roberts
[2:20:56] and and and and and and there was
[2:21:00] something they were even mightier than
[2:21:02] the prophet when it comes to signs and
[2:21:03] wonders but only one had a message
[2:21:09] there was only one messenger
[2:21:11] amen
[2:21:13] so what happens is this they have now a
[2:21:16] gift
[2:21:18] and
[2:21:20] Christianity became a entertainment
[2:21:24] program for the people
[2:21:26] a show
[2:21:27] I mean here is here is here is for
[2:21:30] example our Roberts he had 50 Shape TV
[2:21:33] channels at the same time and it costed
[2:21:36] in billions of dollars therefore he had
[2:21:38] to
[2:21:39] call for money
[2:21:41] to support these television chains
[2:21:44] that's the reason
[2:21:46] all that kind of
[2:21:50] nonsense please don't let repeat us
[2:21:53] these things in the message of the hour
[2:21:56] you take an altar call of of Jimmy
[2:21:59] Swaggart okay so everything is
[2:22:01] emotionally built up and the people on
[2:22:04] the front that's fine everything has its
[2:22:06] time but you can see the camera going to
[2:22:09] find somebody who's crying
[2:22:11] I mean something for me that is so
[2:22:14] disrespectful
[2:22:16] there is such a lack in sensibility for
[2:22:22] the Holy Spirit
[2:22:23] here's somebody between life and death
[2:22:26] and we make a show to promote how
[2:22:29] effective my preaching was
[2:22:33] sometimes the world has more decency
[2:22:36] than this
[2:22:39] and then why why well somebody some girl
[2:22:42] some boy he is filmed then you can
[2:22:44] always see the bank accounts support and
[2:22:47] God is blessing you all these kind of
[2:22:49] things
[2:22:51] so it became a a show
[2:22:55] that was the beginning when they found
[2:22:58] out when they were inviting special
[2:23:00] singers
[2:23:01] uh uh at that time red folly
[2:23:08] forgot some other names they were now
[2:23:11] the the program before the preaching
[2:23:15] came
[2:23:17] and that was the beginning of of of of
[2:23:19] that everything has to be professional
[2:23:23] everything every every tone every note
[2:23:26] every you can you can't imagine somebody
[2:23:28] okay we're we're now on air
[2:23:36] amen then you see
[2:23:42] a man and you see and you see the man
[2:23:44] Jesus
[2:23:48] [Music]
[2:23:52] and the Very sins of that thing got lost
[2:23:57] the sincerity
[2:24:00] the honesty behind us
[2:24:03] man being a real man everybody became
[2:24:06] now A Champion every television preacher
[2:24:09] is a good-looking Joel Osteen
[2:24:13] Jesus loves you
[2:24:17] and there was no place for the messenger
[2:24:19] because he was not feeding
[2:24:22] in that program
[2:24:24] can you say Amen
[2:24:26] so so so God now inspires brother Brahm
[2:24:30] he says in brother sister I've been back
[2:24:32] in the cave long enough and you have to
[2:24:35] to know there has been a lot of
[2:24:36] earthquake and brother Ben speaks about
[2:24:38] the Pentecostal revivals in the 50s and
[2:24:41] the 60s
[2:24:43] shaking around faster since you things
[2:24:46] like that in big meetings
[2:24:48] but where has been God out of it
[2:24:50] remember what he says that was fine but
[2:24:53] it was just entertainment spiritual
[2:24:55] entertainment for the people
[2:24:58] brother we we always say this
[2:25:01] and please
[2:25:03] face for your personal life Faith
[2:25:07] reality I have to do it I have a child I
[2:25:09] never problem with it
[2:25:11] she was serving the lord I always say
[2:25:13] she was born already with the Holy Ghost
[2:25:15] somehow for those who gave her heart to
[2:25:18] the Lord but never made the problem but
[2:25:20] it could have been different
[2:25:23] and sometimes we want to raise up our
[2:25:25] children in the message and we do our
[2:25:28] best
[2:25:29] but they need Christ
[2:25:32] if not we are educating them or we bring
[2:25:37] them up to become rich young rulers
[2:25:41] you understand they know how to behave
[2:25:43] in the church they dress right they do
[2:25:46] right they act right they pray somehow
[2:25:48] but they were never born again because
[2:25:50] they never knew what it is
[2:25:52] therefore there you find that bitterness
[2:25:55] in people
[2:25:57] rather sometimes you have people they
[2:25:58] are dressed so perfectly but you find
[2:26:01] that bitterness in their heart you said
[2:26:02] Hey brother you're missing something
[2:26:05] you can even find it in Preachers
[2:26:08] amen you find young people
[2:26:11] and brother Graham said that Rich Young
[2:26:13] Ruler he woke up in hell
[2:26:15] so it became a a a some kind like a like
[2:26:20] an entertainment program and he says
[2:26:21] that's the reason that I said this
[2:26:23] morning there has to come something
[2:26:25] deeper than a healing service there has
[2:26:28] to come something deeper than the gift
[2:26:29] of speaking with tongues there has to be
[2:26:31] something deeper than a rushing Mighty
[2:26:33] Wind and brother brain preached us at
[2:26:35] the end of the 50s in the message uh
[2:26:39] what does thou hear Elijah
[2:26:43] exactly so so it's a danger
[2:26:46] that is what I want to say you see if
[2:26:48] the Holy Spirit wants to say something
[2:26:50] then then he will do
[2:26:54] forgot it but he comes back
[2:26:56] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:26:58] amen we don't want you but there it is
[2:27:02] amen amen so you see brother Raymond
[2:27:05] said there is if you go and I want you
[2:27:08] all to put on your spiritual jacket we
[2:27:11] want to have Harmony over Harmony and
[2:27:14] everything is fine but sometimes life is
[2:27:16] tension
[2:27:18] because you must struggle for truth
[2:27:21] and the prophet said if you come into a
[2:27:23] church service
[2:27:25] uh you either go back out warmer or
[2:27:28] colder
[2:27:31] but there is a certain way too a person
[2:27:33] can become religious
[2:27:36] and that is the worst thing
[2:27:38] a religious person thinks that he is
[2:27:41] right and doesn't understand that he's
[2:27:43] so wrong
[2:27:44] a person who goes who becomes worldly
[2:27:46] that is very obvious
[2:27:49] amen
[2:27:50] so we are at the end of the 50s and here
[2:27:53] comes the opening of the word
[2:27:57] amen Here Comes The Seven Seals here
[2:27:59] comes the Capstone Here Comes Revelation
[2:28:01] 10 fulfilled here is the third the third
[2:28:03] pull and then brother Branham explains
[2:28:06] what is going to happen
[2:28:08] March March 63. remember keep in mind
[2:28:12] there must come something deeper than
[2:28:14] just a healing service he just picked me
[2:28:17] up and took me set me way up to where a
[2:28:19] meeting was going on it looked like a
[2:28:21] tent or a Cathedral of some art of some
[2:28:24] sort and I looked and there was a little
[2:28:26] white box little place over there on the
[2:28:29] side and I've seen that light was
[2:28:30] talking somebody up to somebody above me
[2:28:33] that light that you see there on the
[2:28:35] picture it welled away from me like that
[2:28:37] and went over to that tent and said I
[2:28:40] will meet you there and said this will
[2:28:43] be the third pool and you won't tell
[2:28:45] nobody and in Sabino Canyon he said this
[2:28:47] is the third pool
[2:28:50] so if there is a place where God says I
[2:28:53] will meet you there let's find that
[2:28:55] place
[2:28:57] can you say Amen because it's so
[2:28:59] important to meet him there
[2:29:02] amen
[2:29:03] so we understand that that means it is a
[2:29:06] tense that's what the Bible says
[2:29:08] sometimes brother Abraham says it is a
[2:29:11] little wooden building
[2:29:13] now you must understand one thing and it
[2:29:16] will help you
[2:29:18] you must read the message you cannot
[2:29:20] live by quotes
[2:29:22] you must see the picture
[2:29:24] amen and you must must read that message
[2:29:27] with a lot of reverence
[2:29:29] with a lot of respect
[2:29:32] said heavenly father I know you are
[2:29:33] right maybe my understanding is wrong
[2:29:37] a man don't never put a a full stop
[2:29:40] always say I put a comma maybe I'm
[2:29:42] learning more
[2:29:44] amen
[2:29:45] because it's a question of life and
[2:29:47] death to find that place
[2:29:50] if you see a vision of a prophet
[2:29:53] a vision can be natural
[2:29:57] when brother Branham had that Vision
[2:29:58] about Marilyn Monroe that was a natural
[2:30:01] vision
[2:30:02] pure natural
[2:30:04] but when Pharaoh had a dream about the
[2:30:07] seven cows and so forth that was a
[2:30:10] symbolic dream
[2:30:13] you understand when Nebuchadnezzar had
[2:30:15] their dream about that statue that was
[2:30:17] symbolic
[2:30:20] so dreams and Visions can be natural and
[2:30:25] can be symbolic
[2:30:28] with a spiritual understanding or
[2:30:30] spiritual explanation about it
[2:30:33] amen so we see people in South America
[2:30:36] they mean well it's good people they
[2:30:39] love the message they love the Lord they
[2:30:40] are building a huge building
[2:30:43] and in that huge building they're making
[2:30:45] a little tent and say that's the place
[2:30:47] where God will come down one day
[2:30:50] I said that's the problem we have too
[2:30:52] much Muslims in this message
[2:30:55] they're putting on a white a white horse
[2:30:57] so when when the prophet comes back he
[2:30:58] will write on that white horse around
[2:31:00] the world that's what Muslims believe
[2:31:04] amen
[2:31:05] but this message is for the bride
[2:31:08] I don't believe it's it's a natural tent
[2:31:12] because I mean if it's a tent natural
[2:31:15] where we'll meet God
[2:31:18] what if the trend is in Europe
[2:31:21] Only You millionaires
[2:31:25] can afford
[2:31:27] the only one who is blessed by that
[2:31:29] Doctrine is Lufthansa
[2:31:34] you say about America that's just funny
[2:31:36] we had this kind of convention you have
[2:31:38] to come to that
[2:31:40] Firefall uh Rapture in faith convention
[2:31:43] to get something brother I need nothing
[2:31:47] because he promised me to meet me there
[2:31:50] in that little room
[2:31:52] [Applause]
[2:31:54] that time is over brother that is bright
[2:31:58] age is a new age
[2:32:00] there is no me no Minister who comes
[2:32:03] today like Superman
[2:32:05] sure
[2:32:07] okay super preaching goodbye next year
[2:32:14] and people say we have to invite this
[2:32:16] man because he has holy hands that time
[2:32:19] is God wants to stir the part of
[2:32:22] Eternity that he placed in your hearts
[2:32:24] foreign
[2:32:26] that's the time of adoption for children
[2:32:29] of God not to find the next man of the
[2:32:31] hour
[2:32:32] it never worked in the future it will
[2:32:35] never work
[2:32:36] can you say Amen
[2:32:38] brother brother
[2:32:40] I'm so happy about about talking to
[2:32:43] people who really understand what about
[2:32:45] you must have good Ministries but let me
[2:32:48] let me let me let me make that little
[2:32:50] example I don't know if I will preach
[2:32:52] about it in the next days
[2:32:53] but brother Beckett made years ago a
[2:32:56] very nice picture I've never forgot it
[2:32:59] God made a picture of his family before
[2:33:02] the foundation of the world
[2:33:04] and here we were
[2:33:08] not arrogant brother REM said if you
[2:33:11] want to continue with God never have an
[2:33:13] arrogant spirit
[2:33:15] amen but we are proud of our father
[2:33:19] and we have a right to be proud
[2:33:22] I remember one day yesterday as a
[2:33:24] testimony of brother Billy Paul brother
[2:33:25] Billy Paul he says his son or his
[2:33:28] grandson he was in Jeffersonville IN
[2:33:30] some in some shop and the older man
[2:33:32] looked to him and say you're looking
[2:33:34] like like that William Branham it was a
[2:33:36] pastor many many years ago in Jefferson
[2:33:38] was he was he a pastor was he a preacher
[2:33:40] and the boy said no
[2:33:43] and then then he said wasn't it Brandon
[2:33:45] Brandon was this is there a tabernacle
[2:33:47] wasn't your grandfather wasn't he not a
[2:33:49] preacher
[2:33:51] he said no but what was he then he was
[2:33:53] the prophet of the age
[2:33:55] not ashamed so here God makes a picture
[2:33:59] a man and he takes our souls
[2:34:02] I mean and throws them
[2:34:05] in seven Church ages
[2:34:07] all over the in seven continents and God
[2:34:10] knows one thing my sheep will hear my
[2:34:12] voice
[2:34:15] and he knows one thing when God when
[2:34:18] seven Church ages are over the whole
[2:34:20] family of God is together
[2:34:26] that's the reason brother Wayne was the
[2:34:28] first messenger
[2:34:30] who said God is not complete anymore
[2:34:32] without you
[2:34:35] brother there is a big difference
[2:34:37] between the bride and the church
[2:34:42] the church is whosoever will let him
[2:34:45] come
[2:34:46] there is many people who will get be
[2:34:48] saved on the white Throne judgment many
[2:34:50] people I believe Millions
[2:34:53] but the bride is part of Christ right
[2:34:56] from the beginning
[2:34:58] can you say Amen
[2:35:00] amen that is one of the teachings that
[2:35:04] is so different to all the messengers
[2:35:06] that brother Brandon explained to us he
[2:35:08] said he said Eve was part of Adam
[2:35:13] did you ever think about that when God
[2:35:16] came in the Garden of Eden in the night
[2:35:18] and he called Adam where are you two
[2:35:21] people came
[2:35:24] because Adam was two people male and
[2:35:26] female
[2:35:27] God called Adam and ether because if had
[2:35:31] no name
[2:35:32] um Even Adam didn't call her Eve he
[2:35:34] called her just a helper or God called
[2:35:37] her a helper
[2:35:38] her name was
[2:35:40] taken from the man so when God called
[2:35:42] Adam Eve came with him because it was
[2:35:44] her name
[2:35:46] so as the bride was in Christ like Eve
[2:35:50] was in Adam
[2:35:51] he was part of him hey amen I mean
[2:35:55] sister said to me brother Marcus when
[2:35:57] God separated the female out of Adam he
[2:36:01] took the best out of man
[2:36:03] I said Okay that was your interpretation
[2:36:06] [Laughter]
[2:36:08] but she was she but she was she was him
[2:36:13] she was part of him
[2:36:14] but not all of him was in here there was
[2:36:17] still part in him the male part
[2:36:21] so when when when when when the bride
[2:36:24] was in Christ and brother Abraham said
[2:36:25] even we prayed for our own sins at the
[2:36:27] cross of calvary
[2:36:29] who will understand that
[2:36:31] amen amen so if we were in Christ
[2:36:35] amen and Christ was Melchizedek right
[2:36:39] before then we were making
[2:36:43] amen
[2:36:44] can you say Amen
[2:36:46] and when Melchizedek was the pillar of
[2:36:48] fire before then we were in the pillar
[2:36:50] of Fire
[2:36:52] in what form ever and with the pillar of
[2:36:55] fire comes out of the bosom of God we
[2:36:57] were in God right in the beginning
[2:36:59] [Music]
[2:37:00] we are part of that whole thing but only
[2:37:03] the bride is it
[2:37:04] can you say Amen there's a big
[2:37:06] difference you understand one thing
[2:37:08] nobody can preach you into the bride
[2:37:12] and nobody can preach you out of it
[2:37:14] [Applause]
[2:37:16] can you say Amen
[2:37:18] amen you can reject my preaching but you
[2:37:20] cannot reject my origin
[2:37:23] maybe the church doesn't understand you
[2:37:25] but God understands you
[2:37:28] I'm therefore when we were born
[2:37:31] God placed part of himself already into
[2:37:34] us
[2:37:36] David said in the Psalms he even placed
[2:37:40] eternity into us and there's only one
[2:37:43] who is eternal there's God
[2:37:45] so you were you were born with a calling
[2:37:47] already
[2:37:48] blessed be the name of the Lord can you
[2:37:51] say Amen only the bride the rest is
[2:37:53] whosoever come let him come we were
[2:37:55] happy about that
[2:37:56] so what happens so we are searching now
[2:37:59] the tense where is it is it in New
[2:38:02] Zealand or is it in Germany is it in
[2:38:05] Jeffersonville or is it in Tucson
[2:38:09] so everything that brother Graham says
[2:38:12] you have to bring back to the Bible and
[2:38:13] the question is who was the first one in
[2:38:16] the Bible who had a tent vision
[2:38:19] that was Moses
[2:38:22] because Moses was taken up in the
[2:38:24] presence of God and when he comes down
[2:38:27] he said you built me a tabernacle
[2:38:29] according to the picture the image that
[2:38:32] you saw in heaven
[2:38:34] can you say Amen the first one was a
[2:38:37] tent Vision was Moses himself and he was
[2:38:40] building that Tabernacle and it was
[2:38:41] perfectly symbolically a human being
[2:38:46] Body Soul and Spirit
[2:38:49] our body Spirit Soul however you want to
[2:38:51] take it I know brother Brandon said it
[2:38:52] this way that way never me I want to say
[2:38:55] this if you want to continue if you want
[2:38:57] to be happy in your message never make
[2:38:58] issues about little details
[2:39:01] you must see the picture and then it's
[2:39:03] clear
[2:39:04] I mean there's something even certain
[2:39:06] quotation of brother I have to let them
[2:39:09] stand I can I say I don't understand it
[2:39:10] right now okay leave it like this amen
[2:39:13] but here it is so what does he do amen
[2:39:18] he built a tabernacle according to the
[2:39:21] vision that he had in heaven no matter
[2:39:23] what he saw maybe theophanus or whatever
[2:39:25] let it be like this okay and he's
[2:39:27] transforming it into a tabernacle but
[2:39:30] this is representing a human body
[2:39:35] brother sister
[2:39:37] nothing in the in the whole universe is
[2:39:40] like a human being
[2:39:42] because the human being is the only
[2:39:45] creature which is made in the image of
[2:39:47] God
[2:39:48] so therefore you can always have respect
[2:39:53] even if somebody is an unbeliever
[2:39:56] respect him to be a human being
[2:39:59] say man we we were young in the message
[2:40:02] and our parents will not believe us
[2:40:06] like we like us so we were despising the
[2:40:09] parents despising grandparents everybody
[2:40:12] was a jezebel I mean and we learned to
[2:40:15] respect people
[2:40:18] amen
[2:40:19] because if we despise unbelievers
[2:40:23] the next thing we will despise
[2:40:25] denominations
[2:40:27] the next thing we despise is everybody
[2:40:29] in the message who is not in our
[2:40:31] Doctrine
[2:40:32] that is a spirit it's an attitude and
[2:40:35] they will respect they will be despised
[2:40:36] even in the local church everybody who's
[2:40:38] not agreeing with us
[2:40:40] and at the end we end up in a one-man
[2:40:42] denomination
[2:40:44] give people their place that God gave
[2:40:47] them
[2:40:48] if somebody is Born To Be A Baptist say
[2:40:50] God bless you the way how God made you
[2:40:53] because God is the judge at the end
[2:40:56] amen you know that story of of that man
[2:40:59] with the lizard eye brother Raymond said
[2:41:01] Bert
[2:41:02] that question now when he said lead me
[2:41:04] to that Jesus that you know what does
[2:41:06] brother Ram say today he is a deacon in
[2:41:08] the Baptist Church
[2:41:12] leave him there
[2:41:13] God has a place it's not Pride bride is
[2:41:17] led by the messenger
[2:41:19] but God has many different vessels
[2:41:22] leave them there God decides what to do
[2:41:25] with it
[2:41:27] so nice
[2:41:29] it's so nice and it helps me a lot it
[2:41:30] keeps me such a such a respect because
[2:41:33] brother Graham said this he said lot was
[2:41:35] a of Abraham was a silver dollar
[2:41:39] lot was just a penny or some pennies
[2:41:43] but if you go shopping
[2:41:46] and you have to pay one dollar and three
[2:41:49] cents
[2:41:51] you say okay here's the dollar
[2:41:54] and the grocer says okay where are the
[2:41:56] three cents
[2:41:57] it's not one dollar is one dollar three
[2:41:59] cents
[2:42:00] and then brother Graham said this he
[2:42:02] said some people are just pennies but
[2:42:05] God uses those Pennies from time to time
[2:42:08] ah
[2:42:10] a and then another I will not make a
[2:42:12] wrong connection but but give a little
[2:42:15] bit Grace to people let the messenger
[2:42:17] say what he says and then brother man
[2:42:18] said this everyone who served God's
[2:42:22] purpose will have a resurrection
[2:42:27] brother bride is bright but give a
[2:42:30] little bit of Grace for the rest they
[2:42:32] will have their place in God's economy
[2:42:35] amen so here we have Solomon was
[2:42:38] building exactly the same Temple and
[2:42:40] brother Brandon said the curtain
[2:42:42] between uh the the holies and the holies
[2:42:46] of holies is our self-will
[2:42:52] perfectly a human being
[2:42:55] can you can you say Amen so far
[2:42:58] can I just continue a little bit is it
[2:42:59] fine for you
[2:43:01] that is the reason and I and I will not
[2:43:04] speak about the self and the self-curs
[2:43:06] curtain remember if you're now closing
[2:43:09] that curtain
[2:43:10] and brother braeme said it's the self of
[2:43:13] a person
[2:43:14] when you close that curtain that was the
[2:43:17] situation when the worshiper came and in
[2:43:19] the temple of Jerusalem
[2:43:22] so the The Temple at that time in the
[2:43:25] time of Jesus
[2:43:27] that was a big business when two million
[2:43:31] people came three times a year for the
[2:43:33] three big Feasts
[2:43:35] so the temple was closed and everybody
[2:43:38] thought the Shekinah Glory is behind
[2:43:41] that Temple
[2:43:42] but it was not anymore behind that
[2:43:45] Temple because the Shekinah Glory the
[2:43:47] pillar of fire appeared over a man on
[2:43:50] Jordan River
[2:43:52] it changed from a building to a person
[2:43:54] by the name of Jesus Christ
[2:43:57] and behind that curtain in the time of
[2:43:59] Jesus Christ was just furniture
[2:44:03] so
[2:44:07] because he left that place and came over
[2:44:11] Jordan River to dwell in the man was
[2:44:13] just Furniture just history just amen
[2:44:16] but it was a business and you must
[2:44:19] understand once in Yom Kippur the the
[2:44:22] high priest goes in and he's looking and
[2:44:24] whatever he comes back he comes out and
[2:44:26] he tells his colleagues he said okay
[2:44:28] gentlemen I the high priest was was just
[2:44:32] a political uh uh political voted by the
[2:44:36] Sadducees which was more of a political
[2:44:38] sect so he comes to his friend he says
[2:44:40] gentlemen I don't think that I'm not
[2:44:43] spiritual I'm really spiritual honestly
[2:44:45] but I want to share something with you
[2:44:47] okay uh yesterday was Yom Kippur
[2:44:51] and um you know I was behind the curtain
[2:44:54] he said yes tremendous yeah tremendous
[2:44:57] but there was nothing and they said
[2:45:00] we all know that there is nothing but if
[2:45:03] we tell the people there's nothing they
[2:45:04] will come to worship
[2:45:06] and pay that's the reason that Jesus
[2:45:09] said you met the house of God a den of
[2:45:11] Thieves
[2:45:14] and therefore brother Graham said the
[2:45:16] words Pharisee means an actor
[2:45:20] he plays something which is not really
[2:45:22] there
[2:45:24] so the curtain is closed and here I hear
[2:45:27] the ashes don't touch the curtain
[2:45:30] don't touch your the presence of God is
[2:45:32] here don't touch it I mean that reminds
[2:45:35] me sometimes if you have Pentecostal
[2:45:38] so-called Revival
[2:45:41] if you want to just make our people to
[2:45:43] make that convention a big success
[2:45:45] tremendous what a success I mean oh I
[2:45:48] feel he's right now here he is here
[2:45:50] because you are here
[2:45:54] it's no need now to to mysterious the
[2:45:57] situation to feel everybody a little bit
[2:45:59] more spiritual
[2:46:00] I feel really his yeah if he's here
[2:46:03] because he's in the children I hope
[2:46:04] there's some Christians here I believe
[2:46:06] all of you
[2:46:07] and you can't imagine here's the high
[2:46:09] priest and the children come and Mr high
[2:46:12] priest
[2:46:13] um we have a question
[2:46:15] um
[2:46:17] um can you explain what is behind that
[2:46:20] curtain and he knows there's nothing
[2:46:22] it's just furniture
[2:46:23] he says children I cannot tell it it can
[2:46:27] I cannot put it into words yeah
[2:46:32] it's true hypocrisy
[2:46:37] playing to be spiritual and knowing
[2:46:40] there's nothing behind that thing
[2:46:42] brother don't let this start in our
[2:46:44] places
[2:46:46] in our churches to play something which
[2:46:48] is not there
[2:46:49] I mean just to have a good mood good
[2:46:50] feeling and so when when when Jesus died
[2:46:53] at the cross you have to understand that
[2:46:55] that that that he opened he was he was
[2:46:58] he was
[2:47:00] renting that way from the top to the
[2:47:02] bottom and everybody could see there is
[2:47:04] nothing behind
[2:47:06] and the thing about the high priest did
[2:47:08] it was this
[2:47:14] exactly so
[2:47:15] they continued their game
[2:47:18] but it was changing of dispensation
[2:47:21] can you say Amen
[2:47:23] so we see that God has a temple
[2:47:27] he will meet us in a tent and where is
[2:47:30] that tent let me say it like this what
[2:47:32] about that thought that we are the tent
[2:47:36] because the Bible says for we know that
[2:47:38] if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[2:47:42] what is it a tense we're dissolved we
[2:47:45] have a building of God a house not made
[2:47:47] with hands
[2:47:49] Eternal in the heavens
[2:47:52] second Peter said we are now living in a
[2:47:54] tent
[2:47:55] in a tabernacle so you search here and
[2:47:59] you search there and you want to stream
[2:48:01] here and you want to stream there and
[2:48:03] somebody has something to say and you're
[2:48:05] missing
[2:48:07] the real thing which is here
[2:48:11] the real streaming is here is not to all
[2:48:13] let's hear Marcus back a tremendous
[2:48:16] breath fine but the real streaming is in
[2:48:20] your hearts
[2:48:22] nobody can preach you into that
[2:48:24] Fellowship
[2:48:26] we can impress people what we know but
[2:48:29] it will not help you on long-term
[2:48:30] effects
[2:48:31] can you say Amen
[2:48:34] so so so here is a meeting place
[2:48:37] and it's right in your heart therefore
[2:48:39] David said in the psalm he said the Lord
[2:48:41] is my light and my salvation who should
[2:48:44] I fear the lord is the strength of my
[2:48:45] life of whom shall I be afraid when the
[2:48:47] week
[2:48:48] find the time of trouble he shall hide
[2:48:51] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[2:48:53] Tabernacle
[2:48:54] do it
[2:48:56] my anchor is not the local church my
[2:48:59] anchor is Christ
[2:49:01] because one day our doors will be close
[2:49:04] brother
[2:49:05] and the streaming will not function and
[2:49:08] the cell phone will not work and then I
[2:49:10] have still connection to God who lives
[2:49:12] in me
[2:49:13] can you say Amen
[2:49:16] look at this amen
[2:49:18] you put on your spiritual jacket who
[2:49:21] came down in our time the king
[2:49:25] the heads The Brew the bridegroom
[2:49:29] the messenger left the scene but the
[2:49:31] message is there
[2:49:33] a man who is that King he's the king of
[2:49:36] all lights
[2:49:38] he's the one who can put turn on the
[2:49:40] lights
[2:49:43] he is the light
[2:49:46] and we are children of the lights
[2:49:48] look at this and you put on your
[2:49:50] spiritual jacket
[2:49:52] David said
[2:49:54] the Lord is my light
[2:49:57] but for the people David was the light
[2:50:01] for Israel
[2:50:03] because you remembered when he wanted to
[2:50:06] go into war the people said no David you
[2:50:08] are the Lamb of Israel
[2:50:11] David said the Lord is my light for the
[2:50:14] people David was their light
[2:50:17] aha
[2:50:18] that means was God in David and they're
[2:50:21] recognized
[2:50:22] that was not David's capacity there was
[2:50:25] God in David's
[2:50:27] look now Shalom now those who will not
[2:50:32] turn to light then their own is one
[2:50:35] thing I can say for in the coming year
[2:50:37] you're going to stoop darker and darker
[2:50:40] as the year goes on
[2:50:42] but to those who will turn on this New
[2:50:46] Year's to the lights
[2:50:48] 64. then you will get brighter and
[2:50:51] brighter that is your promise for next
[2:50:53] year
[2:50:54] on to the perfect day that we look for
[2:50:57] he's appearing where all Darkness will
[2:50:59] be faded away and the reason of that is
[2:51:02] why I say to the Church of the Living
[2:51:05] God today Shalom because we are his
[2:51:08] lights
[2:51:13] you say the Lord is my light the message
[2:51:17] is my light and God said you are the
[2:51:19] lights
[2:51:19] yeah yeah
[2:51:23] can you say Amen
[2:51:25] I mean I say now a sentence and you
[2:51:29] don't reject it directly you lay it
[2:51:30] under the pillow maybe it was not as as
[2:51:32] dumb as we think
[2:51:35] if the coming of the lights
[2:51:38] is the when the coming of Christ
[2:51:41] is the coming of the light is the coming
[2:51:42] of the Sun
[2:51:44] amen
[2:51:46] amen
[2:51:47] when he says Darkness covers yours but
[2:51:50] the light appears over over the Isaiah
[2:51:53] 60. what is the light it's Christ
[2:51:55] himself
[2:51:57] and brother bran said you are the lights
[2:52:01] that means we are the coming of the Lord
[2:52:09] we will meet him in the air
[2:52:11] it's not a question about this future
[2:52:14] but there is a coming of Christ there is
[2:52:17] a coming of the Capstone there is a
[2:52:19] coming of the person of the Holy Spirit
[2:52:21] where is he in Tucson in Jeffersonville
[2:52:24] in the grave of William Branham the
[2:52:26] bride is the light
[2:52:31] you can say I am the coming of the Lord
[2:52:34] of Christ not the Lord as we see the
[2:52:37] illumination we will meet him in the air
[2:52:39] future no problem but there is a secret
[2:52:42] coming
[2:52:45] where in me
[2:52:47] and why you become the light you are the
[2:52:50] lights
[2:52:51] nobody can if you preach or no preach
[2:52:55] there's nothing to do with that you
[2:52:57] become a light for a Dying World
[2:52:59] Jesus said you are the light of the
[2:53:01] world
[2:53:03] and you say Amen
[2:53:04] now now I'm reading just to you don't
[2:53:06] have to read with me
[2:53:08] but you believe me okay and
[2:53:12] first Thessalonians
[2:53:15] chapter 10 verse of chapter 1 verse 10.
[2:53:19] when he shall come to be glorified in
[2:53:23] his Saints
[2:53:25] and to be admired in all them that
[2:53:27] belief because our testimony among you
[2:53:30] was belief in that day
[2:53:33] again when he shall come
[2:53:37] to be glorified in his Saints
[2:53:42] aha
[2:53:43] there is a coming of God where we'll not
[2:53:46] meet him in the air because it's a
[2:53:47] twinkle of an eye there's a coming of
[2:53:49] the Lord to be glorified in his Saints
[2:53:55] when will it be I believe that is
[2:53:58] that was that is is right on track we
[2:54:03] are right in
[2:54:05] foreign
[2:54:06] therefore you cannot dress like you want
[2:54:09] brother I see I and I will deal with the
[2:54:12] next Services about it we have young
[2:54:13] people that told me very clear brother
[2:54:15] Mark we were in a sect
[2:54:16] everything was controlled we were forced
[2:54:19] to put these things on they went into
[2:54:21] the things of the world and by God's
[2:54:23] grace they came back and now they wear
[2:54:25] long hair and long skirt as in the same
[2:54:27] person says me brother Marcus now it's
[2:54:29] my conviction
[2:54:30] now the long skirt and long hair is my
[2:54:33] honor before God
[2:54:35] amen because I found a father
[2:54:37] I didn't found a religion I found a
[2:54:39] father I found who I was but still
[2:54:41] before I found it was just
[2:54:44] pressure of a sect

[2:54:50] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[2:54:52] there it is
[2:54:55] the resurrection is an event

[2:55:02] a person

[2:57:06] Christ in you makes you the complete
[2:57:09] revelation of the whole thing see what

[2:57:19] amen
[2:57:21] you love the Lord
[2:57:23] these things can only preach to Eagles
[2:57:26] denominations would think we're crazy
[2:57:28] saying these things they would say we
[2:57:30] create for us it's food
[2:57:32] spiritual food into your season
[2:57:35] it's it's something that says that
[2:57:36] sounds good that sounds right
[2:57:39] brother I'm very careful about any kind
[2:57:42] of pre-existence I know there is certain
[2:57:44] there's no but I'm not preaching
[2:57:45] especially when I'm not trying but when
[2:57:47] I'm traveling because I will leave more
[2:57:48] questions than answers that is up to the
[2:57:50] pastor okay but somehow we were there
[2:57:53] somehow
[2:57:54] in what form ever because God says to
[2:57:57] job where were you
[2:57:58] what forever I have my opinion about but
[2:58:01] leave it in my heart okay
[2:58:03] but
[2:58:05] you know brother Brennan was with the
[2:58:07] Christian businessman and you know how
[2:58:09] they made fun about him about his
[2:58:11] stories
[2:58:12] amen about the squirrel story and here
[2:58:15] he says he said this one of the brothers
[2:58:17] said okay if you want to hear that
[2:58:19] squirrel squirrel story you come to me
[2:58:21] they made fun of brother Brennan
[2:58:23] we believe everything that brother
[2:58:25] Abraham says all the creation because we
[2:58:28] were with God when he created in the
[2:58:30] beginning
[2:58:32] we know it was not a problem in the
[2:58:34] beginning the same God does whatever he
[2:58:35] wants
[2:58:36] in what form ever like we write in his
[2:58:38] Minds
[2:58:39] can you say Amen
[2:58:41] let me come to the end let me to come to
[2:58:43] the Finish amen hallelujah
[2:58:46] so here we have the three wise men
[2:58:49] amen any and any that little little
[2:58:52] Christmas Story
[2:58:56] so they were three men over there in
[2:58:59] Babylon the brother Brandon
[2:59:02] and they looked through that
[2:59:05] um
[2:59:06] glasses
[2:59:08] and they saw three stars in one line
[2:59:11] that's what brother Brian says
[2:59:13] and they understood
[2:59:15] that something would be happening in
[2:59:18] Jerusalem that the Messiah is born
[2:59:20] because they realized that these stars
[2:59:22] were the burst out of Shem Hammond
[2:59:24] jeford
[2:59:26] and
[2:59:27] all the others could look through the
[2:59:30] same glasses
[2:59:33] but it just saw three stars
[2:59:36] but God opened their understanding we
[2:59:39] say that is so tremendous but I tell you
[2:59:41] one thing the same Holy Spirit opened
[2:59:43] your understanding the same way
[2:59:45] you are not less than them
[2:59:51] amen your understanding is your it is
[2:59:55] your identification your origin will be
[2:59:58] your future
[3:00:01] talking about the bride amen you know
[3:00:04] that that that that that little story
[3:00:06] amen I because God is so much in humor
[3:00:10] amen here's brother Brandon and the
[3:00:12] upline could not leave Memphis and he
[3:00:16] hears the voice just go
[3:00:18] and he just goes
[3:00:19] and he says and while I was just going
[3:00:22] and brother Brian used the word a negro
[3:00:24] woman I hope I'm if it's politically
[3:00:26] correct or not that'd be called a black
[3:00:27] person people said use this word or
[3:00:29] whatever but let me say what brother
[3:00:30] Graham said Here Comes the colored lady
[3:00:32] an African African native lady okay you
[3:00:35] understand okay
[3:00:37] and he was like this over the fence
[3:00:39] and she says hello Parson
[3:00:42] and brother Graham said how do you know
[3:00:43] that I'm a minister
[3:00:45] you see God is in humor normally it was
[3:00:48] brother Branham revealing those people
[3:00:51] your name is Eva I can see you in that
[3:00:54] car accident I can see this but here
[3:00:56] that woman reveals the prophets
[3:01:00] brother Bram does not know who she is
[3:01:02] but she knows who he is you must be the
[3:01:04] Prophet Elijah
[3:01:06] and then she says something which is
[3:01:08] great this is the bride and I am the
[3:01:10] shunamite woman
[3:01:15] brother there's many people who can't
[3:01:18] who can find William Branham in the
[3:01:19] Bible and it's not very difficult to
[3:01:21] find it but you must find yourself in
[3:01:23] the Bible too this speaks of me this is
[3:01:27] my scripture here I am I am that
[3:01:29] shunamized woman amen hallelujah and
[3:01:32] then brother Brian said this amen how do
[3:01:34] you know I I end up shoot a mad woman
[3:01:35] and when they went into their home
[3:01:36] brother Ben said you could feel it was a
[3:01:39] House of Prayer
[3:01:41] God reveals himself you let you let the
[3:01:45] family altar go I tell you troubles will
[3:01:48] enter your home
[3:01:50] a family that stays together is a family
[3:01:53] that prays together you must you must
[3:01:56] take your children
[3:01:58] you say brother Marcus I don't have time
[3:01:59] we have to have to work
[3:02:01] God had many many things to do in the
[3:02:04] time of the Garden of Eden I mean a lot
[3:02:05] of angels a lot of seraphims a lot of
[3:02:08] this a lot of a lot of things to do but
[3:02:10] every evening daddy took care of his
[3:02:12] family
[3:02:13] came down in the Garden of Eden brother
[3:02:15] Benham explains
[3:02:17] you know we made Family alter and we
[3:02:20] made it horrible for our children
[3:02:23] they were sitting down and here comes
[3:02:25] around there's a prophet and a prophet
[3:02:27] around they don't understand things in
[3:02:29] the church how would they understand at
[3:02:30] home
[3:02:32] okay the only thing is that they learn
[3:02:34] to be nice so
[3:02:36] amen
[3:02:40] full body control
[3:02:43] I mean
[3:02:45] so now we make that church service now
[3:02:47] seven days a week
[3:02:48] but brother brim said this he said in
[3:02:51] that kind of family order God came down
[3:02:53] and asked his children how was your day
[3:02:56] he let the children speak that was my
[3:02:58] day daddy
[3:02:59] Adam came and said that was the day that
[3:03:02] happened to me they were expressing
[3:03:03] themselves
[3:03:05] that's our father
[3:03:07] that's our God not not putting a
[3:03:10] Doctrine into the mouths of these
[3:03:12] children but getting to know a father
[3:03:15] who loves them he said you can say hey
[3:03:17] children I love you because I have a
[3:03:19] father who loves me the same way and
[3:03:20] that father will become your father the
[3:03:22] same way you say Amen
[3:03:25] so they just go
[3:03:27] on their way and brother Raymond said
[3:03:29] this three men in one line and three
[3:03:31] stars in one line that is the point when
[3:03:33] brother Blenheim says God shows first in
[3:03:36] the heavens and then he makes it he
[3:03:38] manifestes on Earth that's the cloud you
[3:03:41] can try you find yourself and you write
[3:03:43] in it good luck
[3:03:46] amen
[3:03:47] so when they were just going
[3:03:50] they didn't have a message
[3:03:52] the only service the only preaching that
[3:03:55] they had was we have seen a star
[3:03:58] amen
[3:04:00] so when they had family altar between
[3:04:02] the three brothers
[3:04:04] every evening somebody else was
[3:04:06] preaching
[3:04:07] but they had only one subject
[3:04:09] but somehow the subject was not boring
[3:04:13] because the subject was their life
[3:04:16] and he said who who has a subject this
[3:04:18] evening on his heart I mean one brother
[3:04:22] said hey I got an inspiration brother
[3:04:24] sit down Brent okay what is inspiration
[3:04:27] I don't understand very much but I have
[3:04:30] seen his stars and the other said praise
[3:04:31] the Lord
[3:04:35] enthusiasm has nothing to do to do that
[3:04:38] we hear always something new
[3:04:41] enthusiasm means you understand what was
[3:04:44] said
[3:04:45] and you can sell the same thing a
[3:04:48] thousand times in a thousand times you
[3:04:50] say praise the Lord that's me
[3:04:54] so they were just following encouraging
[3:04:57] one another
[3:04:58] and they entered into Jerusalem and
[3:05:01] brother Abraham said this
[3:05:03] when they're mixed with the wrong kind
[3:05:07] of crowd the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[3:05:09] they didn't see the star anymore
[3:05:14] show me your friends I show you who you
[3:05:16] are or who is influencing you
[3:05:20] brother I made an experience in my life
[3:05:22] never forget people have Spirits never
[3:05:24] forget this
[3:05:25] amen if if you are always the wrong
[3:05:28] people that doesn't like Marcus Becker
[3:05:30] you don't like Marcus Becker you don't
[3:05:31] you have no reason it's just the spirit
[3:05:33] of those people
[3:05:36] once somebody starts to speak negative
[3:05:38] that you must your alarm must go hey
[3:05:40] stop stop no no there is an anointing I
[3:05:43] don't want to have that anointing
[3:05:44] brother can you say amen amen
[3:05:48] I I give me give me just five minutes
[3:05:50] okay that's fine can you say Amen just
[3:05:53] I'm in
[3:05:55] the food is not good anyhow therefore
[3:06:00] okay tomorrow I Repent okay
[3:06:11] yeah we were young and we were legalists
[3:06:13] that was so
[3:06:15] in the beginning when you're me you you
[3:06:17] see what our problem was and maybe the
[3:06:19] brother brother Adrian and brother Eric
[3:06:21] they can confirm uh we we brother brame
[3:06:24] had different anointings in his ministry
[3:06:26] and one of the anointing was the Prophet
[3:06:28] Elijah but he was more than the Prophet
[3:06:30] Elijah he was the church age Angel he
[3:06:31] was the angel too loud to see her he was
[3:06:33] the angel of Revelation 10 he was the
[3:06:35] Moses Ministry he was the Joshua
[3:06:38] Ministry he was the elieza ministry a
[3:06:41] lot of ministry that he had but he was
[3:06:42] the Prophet Elijah so part of his
[3:06:45] ministry was just scolding the people
[3:06:48] make it harder and and if the Holy
[3:06:51] Spirit Come he tells it clear there is
[3:06:53] the doors
[3:06:56] I told Brother Elroy I said look here's
[3:06:58] brother Brian he said and these girls
[3:07:00] when they don't come home and they and
[3:07:02] they address Emory you know these
[3:07:04] mothers they should take a whip and
[3:07:05] should we should should give them the
[3:07:07] streams on their back
[3:07:09] quote of brother Brian I was just
[3:07:11] recording
[3:07:13] but when the daughter of brother blame
[3:07:14] had their problems what did he say she
[3:07:17] needs a friend
[3:07:19] he found out as the Prophet Elijah I
[3:07:21] cannot lead a family
[3:07:24] amen I have to now change that amen amen
[3:07:28] the same Prophet you said you have to
[3:07:30] really beat them up nobody that don't do
[3:07:32] that what she needs is a friend
[3:07:35] you see we have to pay attention under
[3:07:37] what anointing we do certain things we
[3:07:39] can say the prophet said yes but what
[3:07:41] was the anointing okay so we were young
[3:07:43] and we we were listening to the messages
[3:07:45] and many times it was the Prophet Elijah
[3:07:47] just quoting the eliminations
[3:07:49] just just scolding them so I thought
[3:07:51] preaching is scolding
[3:07:54] because the prophet did it so often but
[3:07:56] I didn't understand he had a Ministry to
[3:07:58] school denomination but I'm not called
[3:08:00] to Scott illumination
[3:08:01] I thought I'm called to speak to the
[3:08:04] bride
[3:08:06] I mean to speak a little bit about love
[3:08:08] about Romance
[3:08:10] amen
[3:08:11] I mean imagine that picture I'm here's
[3:08:15] now Rebecca I mean on the way with with
[3:08:18] elieza and we are the further voiced
[3:08:22] that so because we have to prophesy
[3:08:24] again and and Rebecca said tell me
[3:08:27] something about Isaac and Elise I said
[3:08:29] look uh uh uh who is this milk Hasidic I
[3:08:33] will explain to this okay then he says
[3:08:36] the token and he says that the Mighty
[3:08:38] God unveiled before us so he was
[3:08:40] creating that love to her it is I didn't
[3:08:43] say hey look how fat you are man
[3:08:47] poor elieza when he sees you I put Isaac
[3:08:51] when he sees him
[3:08:53] did you didn't you did you brush your
[3:08:55] teeth this morning or whatever
[3:08:59] he knew how to deal with her that was
[3:09:01] the future bride of the king you
[3:09:03] understand we were sometimes under
[3:09:04] anointed but therefore not helpful we
[3:09:07] meant well
[3:09:08] but it was not helpful can you say amen
[3:09:11] amen amen so here they are on the way
[3:09:14] amen finishing
[3:09:16] they enter into Jerusalem and they are
[3:09:19] mixing with the wrong kind of people
[3:09:21] amen and while their mix was the wrong
[3:09:24] kind of people they cannot see the star
[3:09:26] anymore
[3:09:28] we have a slogan in Germany which says
[3:09:30] if you are going if you go into a train
[3:09:32] with five smokers and you don't smoke
[3:09:34] one cigarette but if you come out of
[3:09:36] that train you smell like all the
[3:09:37] smokers
[3:09:38] the company of people
[3:09:41] it's a company of spirits where you have
[3:09:43] to pay attention that family that I said
[3:09:45] when you said is is a legalist and we
[3:09:48] were in the beginning more
[3:09:50] there was sitting sitting just in the
[3:09:51] back when I was preaching it was just
[3:09:54] can you say Amen you can say Amen if you
[3:09:57] want and we think we have to say Amen
[3:10:00] because you want us to say Amen
[3:10:03] amen the body language was relatively
[3:10:05] clear
[3:10:06] now I
[3:10:09] break the eyes with some of the young
[3:10:10] people I don't say shalom I said hey
[3:10:12] give me five dig it doing hey good hey
[3:10:15] just to break sometime the eye but the
[3:10:17] children of that family wouldn't even
[3:10:18] greet me
[3:10:19] it's the anointing of the parents
[3:10:21] falling upon the children
[3:10:23] without saying
[3:10:26] so one day you could see there was there
[3:10:28] was between us it was like a complex but
[3:10:30] Summer by the word of God that context
[3:10:32] was broken and the brother and I tell
[3:10:34] you the truth is an honest testimony
[3:10:35] brother comes to me said brother Marcus
[3:10:37] that was just wonderful we became
[3:10:38] friends
[3:10:40] was just a complex between us the next
[3:10:43] day the same children who never greeted
[3:10:45] me saw me hello brother Marcus
[3:10:49] can you say do you understand what I
[3:10:51] want to say the reservation sometimes it
[3:10:52] comes from us
[3:10:54] oh man it's it's the anointing of people
[3:10:56] so I always say Lord keep my heart clean
[3:11:00] I'm Gonna Keep My Heart clean you don't
[3:11:02] have to even say
[3:11:04] but if you think wrong it will have an
[3:11:06] effect on the people around us when
[3:11:08] brother Brahman said Elvis Presley these
[3:11:10] young girls they were putting off their
[3:11:12] under address putting up on the stage
[3:11:14] and he was signing up give it back to
[3:11:16] that girls brother Elvis Presley never
[3:11:18] sang undressed yourself
[3:11:21] there was there's no quote but in the
[3:11:24] Unseen World there was a connection
[3:11:26] between his thoughts and their them as a
[3:11:29] receiver the same in the spiritual I
[3:11:33] always pray Lord heavenly father I got
[3:11:35] my scars that's super Lord
[3:11:37] I'm Gonna Keep My Heart clean
[3:11:40] it's sometimes not easy I want to be
[3:11:42] honest with you but that's the battle
[3:11:43] that we always have to fight
[3:11:45] to overcome these things and you say
[3:11:47] heavenly father
[3:11:48] don't let me be an emitter of wrong
[3:11:51] spirits
[3:11:52] so brother name said this when they left
[3:11:56] Jerusalem they saw the star again
[3:12:01] you leave false company and you see the
[3:12:03] star again
[3:12:06] amen
[3:12:07] pay attention on Friends pay attention
[3:12:09] on people that influence pay attention
[3:12:10] of even in the social medias and so
[3:12:13] forth pay attention but Spirit goes
[3:12:14] along with those things
[3:12:16] can you say Amen
[3:12:18] so they arrive to that little child
[3:12:21] normally we would have bought something
[3:12:24] at Toys R Us
[3:12:27] because the child was not two years old
[3:12:28] but the three wise men they knew who was
[3:12:32] in that boy
[3:12:34] by Revelation so the first comes
[3:12:37] and brings gold
[3:12:39] showing he is the king
[3:12:42] he's Divine the second one brings
[3:12:44] fragrance amen you will suffer the
[3:12:47] second one the third one brings myrrh I
[3:12:50] mean you will suffer death for our
[3:12:53] Redemption
[3:12:54] the presence the gifts
[3:12:57] that they brought were the expression of
[3:13:00] their revelation
[3:13:03] the way we come to church brother I know
[3:13:06] I'm always making the same things but if
[3:13:08] you are just a guest business it's so so
[3:13:10] wonderful
[3:13:12] I wouldn't dare it in our own church you
[3:13:14] know
[3:13:16] but that was one time I was new in our
[3:13:18] in the church that I go to there were
[3:13:20] two two boys coming like this in the
[3:13:21] Sunday School
[3:13:24] and I wanted myself who the parents were
[3:13:26] I find out who the parents were
[3:13:27] definitely two weeks later two people
[3:13:29] coming to the sanctuary
[3:13:32] whether the way we come they will come
[3:13:35] if we always come too late it shows our
[3:13:38] disrespect to God
[3:13:40] I mean it shows we we as Elder ones we
[3:13:44] didn't understand some lessons and we
[3:13:46] expect now the children they will just
[3:13:47] follow us
[3:13:49] you say Amen took my little child and
[3:13:52] and and with my wife and every Sunday
[3:13:54] morning we went as three persons kneel
[3:13:57] down at the altar like brother Brian
[3:13:58] said together with our little one he
[3:14:00] said praying we were the only one in the
[3:14:02] church
[3:14:03] everything must be of Revelations cannot
[3:14:04] be law he said Heavenly Father speak to
[3:14:07] our little girl may you touch her may
[3:14:08] you may you bless her may you give her
[3:14:10] the Holy Spirit may you bless the
[3:14:11] preacher may you bless the Sunday we
[3:14:13] thank you Father amen every Sunday
[3:14:16] and we have confidence that our prayers
[3:14:17] was not forgotten
[3:14:19] no no it's not for God we never and our
[3:14:23] girl was 13 14 15 16 7 we were not
[3:14:26] nervous because we know one thing God
[3:14:28] doesn't come too late
[3:14:30] no we were not nervous brother Brian
[3:14:31] said to 20 21 is 85 of all converted to
[3:14:35] 21. and then you still have 15 for your
[3:14:38] child
[3:14:40] our prayers is not forgotten brother he
[3:14:43] said amen the way we treat the message
[3:14:46] the way we read it at home is is the
[3:14:49] revelation of it is our action is a
[3:14:53] revelation of how we see the message of
[3:14:56] the hour
[3:14:57] can you say Amen
[3:14:58] sometimes you see people and you have
[3:15:00] the Bible the Bible lays on the floor
[3:15:02] and all these things I don't believe too
[3:15:03] much in those things not in form of a
[3:15:06] legalism but to honor God
[3:15:08] you honor God and God will honor you
[3:15:11] can you say Amen
[3:15:12] so brother are you blessed
[3:15:15] is that fine for you for the first day
[3:15:18] um what what what what a Heavenly Father
[3:15:21] we have and if the musicians would come
[3:15:23] I I thank you very much even for my my
[3:15:26] little jokes in between I'm sure that
[3:15:28] that the food is very very perfect
[3:15:31] if not I will let you know I know
[3:15:33] because we must be honest
[3:15:35] amen but I'm sure we have wonderful
[3:15:37] Cooks here and
[3:15:39] I mean what a father we have
[3:15:43] I mean this message
[3:15:45] is not a denomination why should I
[3:15:48] become denominational
[3:15:49] this message is not a sect why should I
[3:15:51] become sectarian brother bran never told
[3:15:54] us legalism why should I become a
[3:15:56] legalist what's the reason
[3:15:58] amen I I do I please God more we will
[3:16:02] see in the next day that brother Brian
[3:16:03] said our Angel is our theophany
[3:16:06] that's what he says so if he does if our
[3:16:09] angels are free that means he has
[3:16:11] nothing to do with our outside
[3:16:13] amen hallelujah it's just the reflection
[3:16:15] of my of my insight between God and Me
[3:16:19] Myself
[3:16:20] but to make myself outwardly more holy
[3:16:23] does not give me a a theophany
[3:16:29] you say Amen maybe you have the song I
[3:16:31] we have I have a father do you know that
[3:16:34] then we sing two three songs and we pray
[3:16:36] together amen

[3:22:11] I love you more than ever
[3:22:20] that's our confession
[3:22:25] for you
[3:22:44] [Music]
[3:22:46] foreign
[3:22:53] [Music]
[3:22:57] music is Softly playing let's bow our
[3:23:01] heads and I would ask if I'm allowed as
[3:23:04] a guest Minister that we're not filming
[3:23:05] right now I mean while our heads about
[3:23:08] and our eyes are closed and I will I
[3:23:10] close my eyes the same way and I don't
[3:23:13] ask enough for a religious act too it's
[3:23:16] now time to raise the hand there's no
[3:23:18] time to that everybody's happy no no no
[3:23:20] but if something was said and you know I
[3:23:25] have to grow in that point I have to I
[3:23:27] have to have to make my stand more in
[3:23:30] love
[3:23:32] I have to catch that Vision more I have
[3:23:35] to raise up your hands the heavenly
[3:23:38] father lead me to that point
[3:23:40] not only to be in the message not only I
[3:23:43] go to stretch forward or wherever so and
[3:23:45] so is my pastor but let me be that light
[3:23:48] for my family for my children let me be
[3:23:52] a light for a Dying World
[3:23:55] Lord control my temple Lord don't let me
[3:23:59] just become old in the message and never
[3:24:01] be changed let me become wise let me
[3:24:05] become an older brother where young
[3:24:07] people can say I want to become like him
[3:24:09] one day I can see a character not only
[3:24:12] in William Branham I can see that Divine
[3:24:14] character in my brother he is an example
[3:24:17] for me not only to restrict every
[3:24:20] legalist can be strict
[3:24:22] but giving him a vision for a Dying
[3:24:25] World
[3:24:26] [Music]
[3:24:28] a light for somebody who left the
[3:24:31] message that doesn't ever see him I see
[3:24:33] there's hope for me
[3:24:35] not somebody who can condemn me every
[3:24:38] Pharisee can do this but somebody can
[3:24:41] reach out a hand and can take me out of
[3:24:44] my situation
[3:24:46] not just a quote book not a message book
[3:24:49] but he became the message
[3:24:52] foreign
[3:24:53] father we raise our hands and it was a
[3:24:57] strange evening for me too but I sure
[3:24:59] know that you talk to people and I'm not
[3:25:02] opening my eyes in respect to these
[3:25:04] people they are your children but if my
[3:25:06] own hand says Heavenly Father we have
[3:25:08] just a very short time on this Earth
[3:25:11] let us be a reflection of you father let
[3:25:15] us be like our heavenly father Lord we
[3:25:18] tried so much things Pentecostalism
[3:25:20] emotionalism legalism nothing works
[3:25:23] really but let us have the nature of our
[3:25:26] father and Lord let us grow by this
[3:25:30] transforming power of this message I've
[3:25:33] seen people changed in a process from
[3:25:38] Sinners to examples in this message
[3:25:41] Heavenly Father mold our hearts change
[3:25:45] our hearts if it should be that we have
[3:25:48] understanding real brotherly love for
[3:25:50] people and Lord let us understand where
[3:25:53] people have to go through sometimes and
[3:25:56] Lord we thank you so much for each and
[3:25:58] every hand that's raised up for you Lord
[3:26:01] we miss some of the youngsters but we
[3:26:03] know one thing you just call them and
[3:26:07] their time comes they are called by the
[3:26:10] spirit of God because you don't forget
[3:26:12] none of your seeds father Lord we know
[3:26:15] calling is Supernatural you in your
[3:26:19] Divine wisdom will call each and
[3:26:21] everyone who should be called so we lay
[3:26:23] them just into your hand that you may
[3:26:25] take care of them
[3:26:27] we thank you Father and we thank you for
[3:26:29] everything that is be done here in that
[3:26:31] convention May you bless us may you
[3:26:34] bless those who will still come and let
[3:26:36] us have a feast day not because Marcus
[3:26:38] Becker is here but because we are just
[3:26:43] family of God we have different gifts
[3:26:45] but we understand this message makes us
[3:26:48] to princes and to princesses
[3:26:51] like the prophet said you are the light
[3:26:55] I'm a light of the world if I'm
[3:26:57] preaching or not but I became a light
