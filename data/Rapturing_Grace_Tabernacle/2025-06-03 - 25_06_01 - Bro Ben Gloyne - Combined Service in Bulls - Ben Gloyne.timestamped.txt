[6:03] Heat. Hey, heat. Hey,
[6:04] heat. Heat. Heat.
[6:10] [Music]
[6:46] Praise the Lord. Good afternoon
[6:48] everyone. God bless you all. How are
[6:50] you? You're all good. Feeling good. Had
[6:53] a good Have a good lunch. Yeah.
[6:56] wide awake, refreshed. Food gives you
[7:01] energy. It doesn't make you tired in the
[7:03] afternoon. It gives you energy.
[7:06] You should be so energized this
[7:07] afternoon to praise and worship and to
[7:10] stay
[7:11] alert. That's what we're declaring this
[7:13] afternoon. This is not one of those
[7:14] afternoon meetings where you get tired.
[7:16] No, no, no, no, no, no. Not
[7:19] today. No, no. Don't, don't say, "Okay,
[7:23] okay. No, Sister Rachel K, you just got
[7:25] back from um Italy, I believe, this
[7:28] morning. So, okay, there's one allowance
[7:31] in the room, but that's it. Okay, if she
[7:34] sleeps, it's okay. Nobody
[7:37] else. But we know the spirit is always
[7:39] willing.
[7:41] It's always willing. Sometimes this
[7:43] flesh just has to catch the revelation,
[7:45] too.
[7:47] So, in Bulls, they've got they do a
[7:49] funny pun on the words here in Bulls,
[7:51] you know, like they've got the police
[7:53] station, the
[7:55] comfortable, and then the church,
[7:57] there's a sign out there, it says
[7:59] believable, and then there's the
[8:01] community center is
[8:02] befriendable. I think after this
[8:05] morning's sermon, we are undefeable.
[8:09] [Applause]
[8:11] You
[8:12] know, whether you're up, whether you're
[8:15] down, you're undefeable. If you're
[8:17] happy, you're sad, you're undefeable.
[8:19] You know, we we are always a son of God
[8:21] or a daughter of God, we're always
[8:23] victorious. It it doesn't matter whether
[8:26] on the mountain top in the valley, we're
[8:27] always victorious. We're always we're
[8:30] always
[8:31] undefeable. Whether whether you're on
[8:33] the mountain, in the valley, healthy or
[8:36] sick, rich or poor, it doesn't actually
[8:38] matter.
[8:40] And you know, one thing I'm starting to
[8:42] notice is that I I'm embracing that more
[8:44] and more every day is that actually
[8:45] that's what I am. Regardless at all of
[8:47] anything I see around me, any of my
[8:49] circumstances, regardless of
[8:50] anything, that's who I am in Christ is
[8:55] undefeable. And then when you think like
[8:57] that, you think, well, I'm just going to
[8:58] go forward then and just walk into it
[9:01] with just believe and go forward because
[9:02] we have three options essentially. We
[9:04] got sort of two, but we could throw one
[9:06] in there. One as we go forward, another
[9:07] one as we stand here and do nothing.
[9:09] Another one as we go backwards. And I
[9:11] guarantee you if you were to say die
[9:15] later on today, I'm going to say you
[9:17] would probably prefer that you died
[9:18] moving forward. Yeah. You don't want to
[9:21] you don't want to die moving backwards
[9:23] or standing where you
[9:25] are. And who's to say you're not going
[9:27] to die this afternoon?
[9:32] [Music]
[9:35] So who cares? Just be bold and move
[9:37] forward then.
[9:41] You know, brother Brandham's theme song
[9:43] was only believe. All things are
[9:45] possible. A and faith is always moving
[9:48] forward. Like footsteps are possession.
[9:51] Faith doesn't faith is not activated
[9:53] until you go in and possess whatever
[9:54] that thing that faith says you possess.
[9:57] Like it faith is not activated standing
[9:59] still. like like they could have the
[10:01] children of Israel could have Joshua
[10:02] could have stood on the or Caleb could
[10:04] have stood at the border of the land for
[10:05] his whole life saying I'm going to get
[10:06] that land I'm going to get it praise the
[10:07] Lord it's mine but but nothing can
[10:11] substitute going like that the moment he
[10:14] did that was the the the foot the land
[10:16] that he stood on was his it always takes
[10:19] effort and energy and going outside
[10:21] where you currently are to move forward
[10:22] in the Lord or into into anything. It
[10:24] just you just move forward.
[10:27] footsteps are possession. And I believe
[10:29] we are we are a group of people that
[10:31] move forward in the Lord today. That's
[10:33] who we are. We're not we don't turn
[10:34] back. We don't have any armor on our
[10:35] back. We just have only armor on our
[10:36] front. So, we just move forward. Let's
[10:38] stand this afternoon and um just commit
[10:40] the service to the
[10:42] Lord. Lord, we're so grateful that we
[10:44] can be gathered together amongst the
[10:45] children uh the the children of God that
[10:47] are undefeable today, Lord. That's what
[10:49] we confess that we are, Lord. That we
[10:51] were chosen in you before the foundation
[10:53] of the world, Lord. Lord, and we're
[10:55] undefeatable this afternoon cuz we know
[10:58] that you've won every battle, Lord. You
[11:00] You conquered death, hell, the grave,
[11:02] Lord. You You overcame everything, Lord,
[11:04] and you made us undefeable, Lord. So, we
[11:07] just want to come to you in praise and
[11:09] worship. And we don't want the enemy to
[11:10] rob us this afternoon. But we just want
[11:12] to enter in, Lord, and possess all that
[11:14] you have for us this afternoon. May you
[11:15] forgive us of all of our sins, Lord. And
[11:17] may we we come with boldness before your
[11:20] throne of grace this afternoon. We come
[11:22] by faith knowing Lord that you made a
[11:24] way and you said for us to come Lord. So
[11:25] we come here today. We come. We worship.
[11:27] We believe you're already in the midst
[11:29] Lord. You said where two or three are
[11:30] gathered in your name. There you are in
[11:31] the midst. We thank you for these
[11:32] services we can have. We thank you we
[11:33] can we've got the means to come together
[11:35] and meet here and worship and
[11:37] praise. Other countries don't have this
[11:40] opportunity or the means or things like
[11:41] that Lord but we want to thank you so
[11:43] much that we could do this and just have
[11:45] this good time of fellowship here in
[11:46] Bulls. So we just want to commit the
[11:47] service to your hands in Jesus wonderful
[11:49] name. Amen.

[29:50] [Music]
[30:11] I sought the
[30:14] truth. Men gave their
[30:18] answers, but something just wasn't
[30:22] right.
[30:23] [Music]
[30:26] I couldn't explain it. They sounded like
[30:32] strangers. It just didn't meet my thirst
[30:39] inside. Then I heard an eagle's
[30:43] cry. Heard a word speak to my heart. I
[30:48] said, "Child, you don't belong down
[30:51] there. come up from where you are. Then
[30:55] I heard an eagle's
[30:58] cry. It told me I could fly. And I
[31:03] believe the word that I had heard and
[31:07] soared up to the sky when I heard an
[31:11] eagle's cry.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:19] Now I was
[31:21] thirsty and I was
[31:25] calling from somewhere
[31:28] deep
[31:32] inside the deep
[31:39] unveil the voice of the bridegroom
[31:42] calling to his bride.
[31:45] [Music]
[31:46] Then I heard an eagle's
[31:49] cry. I heard a word speak to my heart.
[31:54] He said, "Child, you don't belong down
[31:57] there. Come up where you are." Heat.
[32:00] Heat.
[32:04] [Music]
[32:23] Now I am flying above all the confusion
[32:29] below.
[32:31] Everything's clear and now I'm flying
[32:36] above. In every
[32:40] situation, whatever comes my way, I I
[32:45] have a peace with Jesus flying above the
[32:50] stor. There is a joy within me now that
[32:56] I'm so free.
[32:59] Word has set me free. I'll find my
[33:02] above. I want I
[33:07] want my
[33:11] soul. I feel to the
[33:16] heavenly for
[33:20] eternity. Then I heard an eagle cry.
[33:25] I heard a word speak to my heart. He
[33:29] said, "Sh, you don't belong down there.
[33:32] Come out the way you are." And then I
[33:36] heard an eagle
[33:38] cry. You told me I could fly. And I
[33:43] believe the word that I had heard so up
[33:48] to the sky when I heard an eagle cry.
[33:54] [Music]
[33:56] Then I heard an eagle's
[33:59] cry. I heard a word speak to my heart.
[34:04] It said, "Child, you don't belong down
[34:07] there. Come up from where you are. Then
[34:11] I heard an eagle's
[34:14] cry. It told me I could fly.
[34:19] I believe the word that I had heard
[34:23] soared up to the sky when I heard an
[34:27] eagle's cry.
[34:31] [Music]
[34:53] Oh, holy words. Oh, holy words.

[39:14] Lunch?
[39:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's good.
[39:19] Amen. Let's go to um the book of Luke,
[39:23] chapter 4. Sorry, I don't have a
[39:24] slideshow on me. Uh I didn't I didn't
[39:26] make one. Um but we're going to go to
[39:29] Luke um 4 and 16 down to verse 22. And
[39:33] just as you're turning there, I just
[39:35] want to read a a praise report from uh
[39:38] Sister Lzelle. Where's Sister Lzelle?
[39:40] She's there. Says, "I just want to thank
[39:42] the Lord for a near incident on our way
[39:44] to bulls yesterday. The Lord protected
[39:46] us and um and oncoming cars from a
[39:49] flying wheelbarrow."
[39:51] Praise the Lord. So, amen. Hallelujah.
[39:53] There's angels watching over us all the
[39:55] time, isn't there? So, praise God. We
[39:56] thank the Lord for that. Amen. Praise
[39:58] the Lord. Amen. to Luke uh 4 and 16 and
[40:03] then we're going to read down to verse
[40:05] 22. I know this is probably very
[40:06] familiar piece of scripture for everyone
[40:08] but just want to um yeah use this as an
[40:12] opening text here. So Luke 4 and uh 16
[40:16] says here, "And he came to Nazareth
[40:17] where he had been brought up. And as his
[40:19] custom was, he went into the synagogue
[40:21] on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to
[40:23] read. And there was delivered unto him
[40:25] the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when
[40:27] he had opened the book, he found the
[40:28] place where it was written, The Spirit
[40:30] of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
[40:32] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[40:34] poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[40:36] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[40:37] the captives and recovering of the sight
[40:39] to the blind, to set at liberty them
[40:41] that are bruised, to preach the
[40:43] acceptable year of the Lord. And he
[40:45] closed the book, and he gave it again to
[40:47] the minister, and sat down. And the eyes
[40:49] of all them that were in the synagogue
[40:51] were fastened on him, and he began to
[40:54] say unto them, "This day is this
[40:56] scripture fulfilled in your ears." And
[40:59] all bear him witness, and wondered at
[41:01] the gracious words which proceeded out
[41:03] of his mouth. and they said, "Is not
[41:05] this Joseph's son?" Amen. So, let's just
[41:09] bow our heads in a word of prayer this
[41:10] afternoon. Amen. If you have a need, you
[41:12] just want to lift your hands to the
[41:13] Lord. I believe the Lord could change
[41:15] all of our lives in this service. Amen.
[41:17] I believe our God is a God of moments.
[41:19] Amen. This is another moment in his
[41:20] presence. So, let's pray. Gracious
[41:22] Father, we love you, Lord. We thank you,
[41:24] Lord. We can sing that song, Word of God
[41:25] ever True, Changing Me, changing you,
[41:28] Lord. We're so thankful for your work in
[41:30] our lives, Lord. What you're doing,
[41:31] changing us from glory to glory. And
[41:33] father, as we have gathered here in this
[41:35] afternoon, Lord, we've read your word.
[41:37] We're asking, Lord, that you would
[41:38] anoint your word. Anoint, speaker, and
[41:40] hearer. Lord, I just want to get myself
[41:41] out of the way that you come and speak
[41:42] your word to your children, Lord God.
[41:45] May we just be lifted into heavenly
[41:46] places, Lord, in your presence. And may
[41:48] you have preeminence in our midst, Lord.
[41:50] Father, may you forgive us of our sins
[41:51] and our wrongs, Lord. Wash us, Lord, by
[41:54] your blood and just have your way in our
[41:55] lives. We love you, Lord. We thank you
[41:57] so much, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[41:59] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can you
[42:02] can have your seats uh this afternoon.
[42:04] So I want to speak if I could title this
[42:07] this afternoon. I want to speak about
[42:08] this day. This day is a very a very
[42:11] important day. Very powerful day.
[42:15] I always you know it always grips me
[42:18] very deeply when I read what we just
[42:19] read from Luke chapter 4. Because you
[42:21] think about this here is here is here is
[42:23] more than a prophet more than a
[42:25] religious leader but the God of the
[42:26] prophets God himself. the word made
[42:29] flesh went into the synagogue. It was
[42:31] his custom to go to church. He always
[42:33] went to church. Amen. And so there he
[42:35] was. He's standing there and he's given
[42:36] the he's given the scrolls. He's given
[42:38] the book of Isaiah. And he identifies
[42:41] the so the word made flesh identifies
[42:43] himself in the written word saying this
[42:47] is what I'm here to fulfill in this day.
[42:49] And he would read this and he would say
[42:52] this day is a scripture fulfilled in
[42:54] your ears. Now, it wasn't a it wasn't an
[42:57] argument, wasn't a discussion. He wasn't
[42:59] pondering these things. He knew by
[43:01] revelation that he was here to fulfill
[43:03] this piece of the scripture. Amen. So,
[43:05] when he said, "This day is a scripture
[43:07] fulfilled in your ears." Amen. He was
[43:09] making a declaration. What you see in
[43:11] front of you made flesh is the prophecy
[43:13] of Isaiah is no longer a prophecy no
[43:16] more, but it's manifested in front of
[43:17] you. First, it was the thoughts in the
[43:19] mind of God. Then, then it was spoken
[43:21] through the prophet. Now, it's become
[43:22] material in front of you. This day is
[43:24] this scripture fulfilled. It was the
[43:26] word made flesh I opening the word
[43:29] identifying himself in his own word. I
[43:32] think it's an incredible thing because
[43:33] we can stand here and I maybe I'll do
[43:35] you know maybe cover a few of them with
[43:37] the help of the Lord this afternoon but
[43:39] this day a lot of scriptures fulfilled
[43:42] this day. We're living the day of
[43:43] fulfilled prophecy this day. Amen. Is an
[43:45] incredible day that we'll be privileged
[43:47] to live in. You know so we sing that
[43:49] song word of God came to us through
[43:51] sacrifice. I sing that I feel this big.
[43:53] I think, Lord, you allowed your children
[43:55] to go through great trials and depths
[43:57] and dangers and things and I just
[43:59] received the benefit of it. Amen. It's
[44:01] like I've got a free pass almost of
[44:03] just, you know, just walking into glory.
[44:05] They did all the hard yaker and here I
[44:06] am. That's how I feel anyway. You know,
[44:08] because why? Cuz they went through great
[44:10] dangers for the word to be passed down
[44:12] into this age. Amen. And many of the
[44:15] prophecies that we have seen the
[44:16] fulfillment of and we're living out,
[44:18] they just maybe talked about, maybe they
[44:20] discussed it, but they never lived long
[44:22] enough to see it fulfilled. But this
[44:24] day, Amen. Every prophecy concerning the
[44:26] bride is fulfilled. Amen. This day,
[44:29] Amen. these scriptures are fulfilled.
[44:31] Amen. We're not we're not here to to
[44:33] debate if there's a bride. I can say
[44:35] this day. Amen. The prophecy of of of
[44:38] Revelations 19. Behold, his wife has
[44:41] made herself ready. The marriage of the
[44:42] lamb has come. Amen. This day that
[44:45] scripture is fulfilled. It was granted
[44:47] unto her that should be arrayed in fine
[44:49] lin and clean and white which is the
[44:50] righteousness of saints. This day is
[44:53] that scripture fulfilled. Amen. Why? Cuz
[44:55] God has given us grace. He's granted us.
[44:57] Amen. The robes of righteousness. We
[44:59] don't have to earn it. We don't have to
[45:01] work it out. It's given to us freely.
[45:04] Amen. I tell you what, friends, that's
[45:06] one way you know you're in the bride age
[45:07] or not. Is because you you realize it's
[45:09] the supreme grace of God. Amen. Because
[45:12] brother Ram said that he is always
[45:13] misunderstood and criticized for
[45:15] believing in grace. Why? Because he is
[45:17] living in a Pentecostal age. And brother
[45:19] Ram said the Pentecostals were great
[45:20] legalists. They were the arms in the
[45:23] body, right? And so so what did they do?
[45:26] They they thought they had to earn
[45:27] something with God to or do something to
[45:29] get his favor. What was that? Well, I
[45:32] speak in tongues. Therefore, I found
[45:34] favor with God because of something I
[45:36] have done. But we don't believe it that
[45:38] way. It's like the list of doctrines
[45:40] brother Ari put up. I believe servants
[45:41] in Godhead all these things. That's
[45:43] still a manage understanding of well I
[45:45] believe this therefore I have found
[45:47] favor with God. It's nothing you have
[45:49] done. It's all he has done. Hallelujah.
[45:52] So we're not saying well I believe this
[45:53] therefore I'm therefore I'm qualified
[45:55] for a rapture. No, it's the grace of God
[45:57] coming into our lives. Amen. The power
[45:59] of the blood coming into our lives and
[46:01] transforming us. Hallelujah. Makes us
[46:04] rapture ready.
[46:06] Yeah. If you think I'm too liberal, I
[46:09] don't care. I really don't care what you
[46:11] think. God found me in the depths of
[46:13] sin. I knew what I was and I know what I
[46:16] am. Hallelujah. You call me what you
[46:19] want. God found me and he found me to
[46:21] keep me. He found you to keep you as
[46:23] well. Amen. This day we can say God's
[46:25] grace works. Amen. This day we can say
[46:27] the blood of Jesus Christ is more than
[46:29] enough. Amen. We're not a people
[46:31] guessing and wondering if we're saved.
[46:32] We know in whom we have believed. Amen.
[46:35] We know. Amen. We're secure. Amen. We
[46:37] believe and we know eternal security is
[46:39] right. Why? Because he's holding on to
[46:42] you. Amen. It's not us holding on to
[46:44] God. It's him holding on to us. I mean,
[46:47] when brother had his great trial of his
[46:48] wife and and daughter dying, all these
[46:50] things, people say, "Bill, are you
[46:52] holding on to your religion?" He says,
[46:53] "No, God is holding on to me." I mean,
[46:56] when he wanted to let go, when he wanted
[46:58] to commit suicide, God said, "No, I've
[47:00] got a plan for your life. You're you're
[47:02] not allowed to get off yet." Amen. You
[47:03] got some scripture to fulfill. Well, I
[47:05] tell you what, friends, we're in the
[47:06] same category. God has word for you to
[47:09] fulfill. Amen. He's commissioned you to
[47:11] do it. He's anointed you to do it. I
[47:12] say, "This day, it'll be fulfilled."
[47:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. God is
[47:19] here to prove his own word. Amen. When
[47:22] God gave a promise of a bride in this
[47:24] age, he didn't back up when he knew the
[47:25] conditions of this age. Amen. He knew
[47:28] the state of this world. He knew it
[47:30] would fall apart. He knew the state of
[47:32] people would be degraded, too. But he
[47:34] said even in that kind of condition, he
[47:36] says, "No, I'm going to bring my bride
[47:37] bride out of that chaos." He brought us
[47:40] out of a lot of chaos.
[47:43] I was twisted up and turned around in
[47:44] every which way. But God, rich in mercy,
[47:47] I pray we just be more thankful what God
[47:49] has done. We really appreciate, Amen.
[47:52] what he's done in our lives. Even now,
[47:54] you say, "Well, I'm going through the
[47:55] worst trial of your life." He hasn't let
[47:57] you go. He hasn't forsaken you. Amen.
[48:00] He's still right with you. Amen. The two
[48:02] on the way to Emmas. Amen. They were
[48:04] they were walking in the season of the
[48:06] resurrection. Their whole world had
[48:07] fallen apart. When they were walking to
[48:09] Emmas, they weren't skipping. They
[48:11] weren't dancing. They weren't rejoicing.
[48:13] They were brokenhearted down. They had
[48:16] the whole thing had fallen apart in
[48:18] their eyes. It was right according to
[48:20] God's plan. It was right according to
[48:22] schedule. But they thought, "How could
[48:24] this happen?" But you see what happens
[48:26] is when you begin to talk about Jesus,
[48:28] he begins to walk with you. He begins to
[48:31] the atmosphere begins to change around
[48:32] you. You begin to talk about his
[48:34] promised word and the fulfillment of it.
[48:36] You know, because that's what they were
[48:37] doing. They were talking about Jesus.
[48:39] They weren't talking about the Romans.
[48:40] They weren't talking about the economics
[48:42] of this world. They were talking about
[48:44] what God was doing in their day. Even
[48:46] though they didn't understand it. And
[48:48] when they were talking about the Lord,
[48:50] he began to walk with them. I mean, they
[48:53] did not understand that the that the
[48:54] stranger that was walking with them was
[48:56] the very God. I mean, the very Lord of
[48:58] glory. He just withheld that knowledge
[49:01] from
[49:02] them. Then then then the Lord began to
[49:06] ask them, "Why are you sad?" as if he
[49:07] didn't know, you know, as if he didn't
[49:09] know. And then they would have looked at
[49:11] it with such a surprise. Don't you know
[49:12] what's happened in these days? See, they
[49:14] didn't know it was this day was the
[49:16] scripture fulfilled. I mean, of the
[49:18] crucifixion, of the of the true Passover
[49:20] lamb being given and all these things.
[49:22] They didn't understand it, but they were
[49:23] living in that scripture. And then here
[49:25] they are. And they begin to say to him,
[49:26] "Don't you know this man, Jesus of
[49:28] Nazareth? We considered him a prophet
[49:30] and all these things and you know but
[49:32] now he's been crucified and it's been
[49:33] three days and then he began to talk to
[49:35] them say oh fools and slow of heart to
[49:38] believe you see they were downhearted
[49:40] but God didn't want to leave them that
[49:42] way I tell you what friends you can go
[49:44] through a lot of hard trials and be real
[49:46] downcast God don't want to keep you that
[49:48] way amen but God wants to bring a bring
[49:51] a bring a fresh revival into your life
[49:54] to revive you. Amen. It's like Jacob,
[49:56] you know, Jacob in the Bible, it says
[49:58] his spirit basically departed from him
[50:00] when his son Joseph was, you know, he
[50:02] thought he was dead and he was down. But
[50:04] then after many years had passed and
[50:06] Joseph revealed himself to his brethren.
[50:08] And then when his brothers came back to
[50:10] to well well the sons came back to
[50:12] Jacob, they begin to tell Jacob how
[50:14] Joseph is alive and he's in Egypt and
[50:16] and then and then you know the Bible
[50:18] says when when Jacob saw the wagons of
[50:20] the goods that Joseph brought uh sent
[50:22] with his brothers, then his spirit begin
[50:25] to revive within him. Amen. So I pray
[50:27] God would send wagon loads of the Holy
[50:29] Ghost down into our lives. Amen. To
[50:31] revive us. Amen. To realize, sure, we've
[50:33] been through shock and loss, but God
[50:35] hasn't forgotten us. Hallelujah.
[50:37] Hallelujah. So, so you know the Lord be
[50:39] to walk with these two on the way to
[50:40] Emmas and then he begin to start from
[50:43] Moses. He begin to read down and you
[50:45] know brother Bram uh brings it out so
[50:47] nicely in uh events made clear by
[50:49] prophecy 1965. He says now let's hear
[50:51] him say turn over to Zechariah 11 and 12
[50:55] and wasn't the Messiah to be sold
[50:56] according to the prophet for 30 pieces
[50:58] of silver. Uh you just said that this
[51:00] man was sold for 30 pieces of silver.
[51:02] Turn over. You're getting them
[51:03] scriptures. Zechariah 11 and 12. Then he
[51:05] said, "Did you notice what David said in
[51:07] the Psalms, Psalms 41:9, that he is to
[51:10] be betrayed by his friends and then
[51:11] again in Zechariah 13:7 that he was
[51:13] forsaken by his disciples and in Psalms
[51:16] 35:11, accused by false witnesses." You
[51:19] just said he was. Isaiah 53:7, he was
[51:22] dumb before his accusers. Isaiah 506,
[51:25] they scorged him. The prophet said in
[51:27] Psalms 22, he was on the cross. My God,
[51:29] my God, why has thou forsaken me? Did he
[51:32] do that the day before yesterday? Psalms
[51:34] 22 again 18 his garments were parted
[51:36] among them. Did they do that? And Psalms
[51:39] 22:7-8 mocked by his enemies the church.
[51:42] Psalms 22 again that there was not a
[51:43] bone in his body to be broke but they
[51:45] pierced my hands and my feet. He said
[51:47] holding his hands behind him no doubt at
[51:49] that time. Isaiah 53 and12 said he would
[51:51] die between malfactors. Isaiah 53:9 said
[51:55] he was buried with the rich. Psalm 16
[51:57] and 10 said I will not leave a soul in
[51:59] hell neither will I suffer my holy one
[52:01] to see corruption. And was not Malachi 3
[52:04] the forerunner of this man? Oh, I'd like
[52:06] to heard him quote that. Look at the
[52:08] prophecies. Notice then all the types he
[52:10] might have went through about Isaac and
[52:11] Genesis 22. Our God foreshadowed Isaac.
[52:14] Our father Abraham took his own son
[52:16] packing the wood up the hill and offered
[52:17] up his own son. So he began to ask some
[52:19] questions after he quoted the scripture.
[52:21] Did he do that? Amen. And you know we
[52:24] could bring it into this day. Did he not
[52:26] say in Malachi 4 that he had sent Elijah
[52:28] the prophet before the great and
[52:29] dreadful day of the Lord? Did he do
[52:31] that? Amen. Amen. Was he not
[52:32] commissioned on on the Ohio River 1933,
[52:35] the pillar of fire came down, a voice
[52:37] spoke out, "As John the Baptist forun my
[52:39] first coming, so your message will
[52:41] forrun the second coming." Did he do
[52:42] that? Amen. Did you know did not the
[52:46] angel of the Lord commission brother
[52:47] Brandham? Amen. Took, you know, took the
[52:49] two signs and, you know, went to the
[52:51] world to spearhead a worldwide healing
[52:53] revival. Did he do that? Amen. Was he
[52:56] not told that he would meet seven angels
[52:58] north I think northeast of Tucson to
[53:00] fulfill Revelations 10:1? Did he do
[53:03] that? Amen. Was he not told? Amen. Did
[53:07] Did Was he not told to go back to
[53:09] Jeffersonville that the seven seals
[53:10] would be open? Did he do that? Amen. Did
[53:14] he do that? Amen. Did Did not the lamb
[53:16] step forth and take the title deed of
[53:18] redemption?
[53:20] You know, one of the biggest scarecrows
[53:21] around the opening of the book of
[53:23] Revelation, people say it's just
[53:24] information.
[53:25] It ain't just information. It's
[53:27] revelation. Gives you overcoming power.
[53:29] Amen. To overcome in this day. Amen.
[53:31] Because sure, we've been restored back
[53:33] to you, you know, the bride of Jesus
[53:35] Christ has been restored back to the
[53:36] original. But God has sent a power in
[53:38] this age to break the cycle of revival
[53:41] and death. Amen. Because we know through
[53:43] the church ages has been a cycle of
[53:45] revival and death and revival. And God
[53:48] would send a message. There would be a
[53:49] revival in the church. But a few
[53:50] generations later, it would cool off and
[53:53] then God would, you know, restart the
[53:55] process again. But there has to come a
[53:57] time when that cycle is broken. I mean,
[53:59] it doesn't go revival and death and just
[54:01] just just cabbageing down and just
[54:03] churchity. But God would come and live
[54:05] in his people, there'll be revival from
[54:07] one generation to the next. Amen. And so
[54:10] what happens now is when the lamb takes
[54:11] the book and those seven thunders out of
[54:13] their voices is whenever the word of God
[54:15] opens up, there's a power released in
[54:17] that word to overcome in that day. You
[54:19] say, "Well, I need an example." That's
[54:21] pretty easy. You know, Martin Luther,
[54:22] when the word came open to him, the just
[54:24] shall live by faith. You know, I just
[54:26] said to brother Al, he's preaching. I'm
[54:28] like, I'm just going to take the same,
[54:29] you know, the Lord put this on my heart
[54:31] to take the same thing basically, but
[54:32] from a different angle. Okay. So, I
[54:35] wasn't quickly changing things to make
[54:36] sure it match. No, it was already here.
[54:38] Okay. So, I think God wants to tell us
[54:40] something, you know. Praise the Lord.
[54:42] Amen. So, so, so, so when the word came
[54:44] open to Martin Luther, the just shall
[54:45] live by faith. There was a power in that
[54:47] word for him to live above trying to
[54:49] earn his own salvation. Right? And then
[54:51] the Wesleyans came along, John Wesley
[54:53] actually read uh Martin Luther's um
[54:57] writings on the book of Romans and he
[54:59] was already a preacher at that time,
[55:00] failed miserably. He heard he heard
[55:03] Martin Luther's writings on the book of
[55:04] Romans and he said a warming sensation
[55:07] warmed his heart and then God began to
[55:09] move in his life and he began to preach
[55:10] the second work of grace sanctification.
[55:13] And what happened? The power of God was
[55:15] released through that word for the
[55:16] people to live a holy life. Amen. And
[55:19] then it came around to the time of Isuza
[55:21] Street. There was a cry for the
[55:22] restoration of the gifts. God was
[55:23] restoring. Amen. And when the reality of
[55:26] the restoration of the gifts struck the
[55:28] struck the church, well, it was the word
[55:30] opening up to them to restore the gifts,
[55:32] a power came in. Amen. But after every
[55:34] one of those moves, there's been a
[55:36] revival. Then there's been a cycle of
[55:38] revival and death. Amen. But now with
[55:40] the opening of the word, Amen. Christ
[55:41] himself being fully unveiled in this
[55:44] day. What does that do? It releases a
[55:46] power into the church. Amen. To break
[55:48] the cycle of revival and death.
[55:51] Hallelujah. That's what's coming to your
[55:53] life. Amen. Hallelujah. It's not just a,
[55:55] you know, just a one-time experience, an
[55:57] excitement that cools off. No, God wants
[55:59] to give us, and I believe he has through
[56:01] the opening of the word, an unending
[56:02] revival. I mean, where you be that Welsh
[56:05] policeman, you say, "I am the bride's
[56:07] revival." You're looking at it when you
[56:09] come into my presence, you're looking at
[56:10] it right now.
[56:13] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. You know,
[56:14] the first time I listened to the seals,
[56:16] I just saw horse riders, tribulation,
[56:19] all those things. The second time I
[56:20] listened to it, all I saw was the lamb
[56:23] stepping forth to claim me. Hallelujah.
[56:26] And more than horse rides, more than
[56:28] symbols, it's Christ revealing himself.
[56:30] And I pray that it would happen to all
[56:31] of us. You'd see under those seals is
[56:33] what is it? It's a lamb taking the book.
[56:35] And what is that? That is the same as
[56:37] brother says about as as as Boaz
[56:40] claiming Ruth. You are that book. Hey,
[56:44] what what's happening through this
[56:45] message? God has said you're mine. Amen.
[56:47] And the devil has no claim on you no
[56:49] more. He strikes it all off by the power
[56:51] of his blood. Hallelujah.
[56:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, has he not
[56:56] done that? Did not brother Ram say that
[56:59] this message will introduce Jesus Christ
[57:01] to the world? Has it not done it? Amen.
[57:04] Has it not happened that there would be
[57:06] a people that would take the book, eat
[57:08] the book, and speak and prophesy again?
[57:10] Has that not happened? Has he done it?
[57:13] Amen. Does not the scripture say that
[57:15] there be a people that God would call
[57:17] out of the Gentiles for his name's sake?
[57:20] Let's bring it personal. Has he not done
[57:21] that? He's called you out. I trust he
[57:23] has. He's called you out. Amen. You're
[57:25] no longer a church person, a religious
[57:27] person. This ain't a religion. No, this
[57:29] is a call to a union. Hallelujah. Has he
[57:33] not done that? Amen. Did he not say
[57:35] there'd be a bride without spot or
[57:36] wrinkle? Has he done it? Has he done it?
[57:40] Amen. For it says in 2 Corinthians 5:21,
[57:43] "He who hath he hath made him to be sin
[57:45] for us, who knew no sin, that we might
[57:48] be made the very righteousness of God in
[57:51] him." Has he done it? Now, that's
[57:54] personal question. Has he done it? Oh,
[57:55] but I have all these faults and
[57:56] failures. Look beyond those things. Look
[57:59] beyond those things. It's on the way to
[58:00] Emmas didn't believe really what was
[58:02] going on in front of them. Did God quit
[58:04] on them? He walked with them until they
[58:07] saw they were part of the resurrection.
[58:10] And God goes with you until your eyes
[58:13] come open. Hallelujah. That you're part
[58:16] of this resurrection in the end time.
[58:19] Hallelujah. You know, Brother Brand
[58:21] would speak about ducks in this day. I
[58:24] like the story because you got to
[58:26] realize the bride has gone through a
[58:29] change. You go back 20 years. Would we
[58:32] have these kind of meetings? It would be
[58:34] a bunfight. A preacher would get up, say
[58:37] this. Now another preacher would get up
[58:38] to counter that guy and you know be like
[58:40] it'd be like a political like a
[58:42] parliament. Mr. Speaker, he said this
[58:45] and this is wrong here. It it was all
[58:47] this and what was it? It's like brother
[58:48] Ram said, there was a there's a bunch of
[58:50] ducks and a farmer put them in pens,
[58:53] right? And they and all they could hear
[58:55] is the honking or the quacking of the
[58:57] other ducks in the pens. They didn't
[58:58] trust what what they hearing. They
[59:00] didn't quite know who was saying it. as
[59:02] the same thing. There's all these
[59:03] man-made fences around people, specialty
[59:06] doctrines. If you don't see it my way,
[59:08] you ain't going. It's got nothing to do
[59:10] with it. Has God called you?
[59:14] Amen. Has this message found you? That's
[59:17] what it's about. Remember, it's not an
[59:19] exam to go to heaven. Brother Lamb says
[59:21] we're not saved by a checklist. We're
[59:23] saved by grace.
[59:25] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. Amen.
[59:27] That I can get in. But you see now there
[59:30] came a time when when see these ducks
[59:32] are walking around on the earth mud.
[59:35] They're just all carnal connected to the
[59:37] earth. But then the season changed and
[59:39] the rain begin to be poured out. Amen.
[59:42] The what is that rain? The spirit begin
[59:44] to pour out. And we can see you over the
[59:47] last I've been a believer since 2007. So
[59:49] I've just got this little space of time
[59:50] of experience. But I've seen from that
[59:52] time till now God's poured his spirit
[59:54] out more and more. The rain has come.
[59:59] It's raining. The former and latter rain
[1:00:01] are running together. The teaching and
[1:00:03] the quickening rain are running
[1:00:04] together. Hallelujah. It's not just a
[1:00:06] teaching then a nothing then a harvest
[1:00:08] rain. No, it's running together. Has he
[1:00:11] done it?
[1:00:13] Hallelujah. Yes, he has. And what has
[1:00:16] happened? The rain has come down. It's
[1:00:17] lifted us up out of the muck, out of the
[1:00:20] carnality. Well, that church does this
[1:00:22] and I do this and I'm different to this.
[1:00:24] That's all carnal comparison. We've been
[1:00:26] lifted up above that mouth. Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] We're all individual. Praise God. Amen.
[1:00:30] This ain't some McDonald's franchise all
[1:00:33] the same. We're all different.
[1:00:36] Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] This ain't this is more than a happy
[1:00:40] meal,
[1:00:41] folks. But you see, God is God has done
[1:00:43] such a work that the that the rain has
[1:00:45] come because eventually that rain poured
[1:00:46] in and it lifted the ducks up above the
[1:00:49] out of the mud, above the fences. Then
[1:00:52] they begin to see each other and say,
[1:00:53] "Hey, you're a duck, too." Amen. That's
[1:00:56] what happened. Hallelujah. So, now we've
[1:00:58] come into a season where we identify,
[1:01:00] I'm the word, you're the word. I'm a
[1:01:03] duck, you're a duck. I mean, you ain't a
[1:01:05] goose or a whatever. You're a duck and
[1:01:07] I'm a We're made out of the same
[1:01:09] material. We have the same father.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. So, now what is going to
[1:01:14] happen? There's a swarming going on cuz
[1:01:16] there's a season changing. Yes, sir.
[1:01:18] Then we're going to fly home. Amen.
[1:01:21] Hallelujah. Has he done it? Amen. Amen.
[1:01:25] This is where we are. You say, "Well,
[1:01:27] brother Ram's just telling a story to
[1:01:28] make a joke." No, he's actually in a
[1:01:30] parable saying this is where we would
[1:01:31] get to. Praise God. Has he done it? Yes,
[1:01:35] he's done it. That's This is why we come
[1:01:37] together. It's like we just Well, we are
[1:01:39] one big family. We're all ducks. Welcome
[1:01:42] to Duck
[1:01:44] Church. Praise God. Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:01:47] But it used to be it wasn't like that.
[1:01:50] I' I've been to conventions where I was
[1:01:52] first a believer it was like it there
[1:01:54] was no unity there. Why? People were
[1:01:56] still earthbound behind
[1:01:58] fences. Amen. And you got to realize if
[1:02:00] you know the water may lift you above
[1:02:02] the fence, but if your if your swim is
[1:02:04] just kick a bit of wood, you you feel a
[1:02:06] bit of separation, you got to realize,
[1:02:07] no, that's under you now. That's under
[1:02:09] you. You're swimming above it.
[1:02:12] Hallelujah. We don't have to put up with
[1:02:13] no man-made things. Remember, the devil
[1:02:15] makes fences. leave his architecture
[1:02:17] alone.
[1:02:19] You know, we're all one family. I'm
[1:02:21] going to You have to put up with me for
[1:02:22] eternity.
[1:02:24] Some of you are happy. So,
[1:02:26] anyway, but we're all one family. When
[1:02:29] one of us suffers, the other suffers.
[1:02:31] One rejoices, we all rejoice. We care
[1:02:34] for one another. We all want to make it.
[1:02:38] Amen.
[1:02:41] You say, "Well, one day." No, this day.
[1:02:45] This day. This has been happening for
[1:02:47] quite a long time. There's a unity
[1:02:48] around the world. What's happening? God
[1:02:50] is gathering his ducks together.
[1:02:52] Sometimes, you know, it's not, you know,
[1:02:53] rain may fall slow in different parts,
[1:02:55] but God will get everyone above the
[1:02:56] fence. He'll get all of his children
[1:02:58] above the fence, and he's determined.
[1:03:00] None of them will be stuck in the mud in
[1:03:01] the in the pens. They're all being
[1:03:03] lifted up. Amen. And that's exactly what
[1:03:05] God is doing. You say, "Well, one day,
[1:03:07] no, this day, this day, this is
[1:03:11] fulfilled." Hallelujah. The Bible says,
[1:03:14] "Now we are the sons of God." This day
[1:03:18] we are the sons of God. Amen. I'm going
[1:03:20] to say something. God will finish his
[1:03:22] bride how he started his bride. How he
[1:03:24] started his bride is how he's going to
[1:03:26] finish her. Amen. She ain't going to be
[1:03:28] a different material. She ain't going to
[1:03:29] be a different makeup. She's going to be
[1:03:31] exactly grain like the first because
[1:03:34] because we got to realize that on the
[1:03:35] day of Pentecost, there was 120 pieces
[1:03:38] of grain in the upper room. They're
[1:03:40] quickened by the Holy Ghost. And God
[1:03:42] would display briefly what the mature
[1:03:45] church would
[1:03:46] be. Amen. They were led by the spirit of
[1:03:49] God. God lived in them. More than an
[1:03:52] anointing. God lived in them. Amen. When
[1:03:55] you saw saw the believer, you saw God
[1:03:57] made flesh. The devil was cast out.
[1:04:00] Signs and wonders were done. The word
[1:04:02] was proven. Amen. That's how it was in
[1:04:05] the beginning. And we have gone through
[1:04:07] a process of a restoration.
[1:04:11] Amen. like like like uh brother Array
[1:04:13] said in the beginning he would say about
[1:04:15] the you know the Pentecostals that you
[1:04:17] know well I'll just read this here now
[1:04:20] through the Lutheran age through the
[1:04:21] Wesleyan age it's been the same thing
[1:04:22] through this Pentecostal age now notice
[1:04:24] but at the opening of the seven seals
[1:04:26] revelations 10 the full word is to be
[1:04:28] born into manifestation again and
[1:04:30] vindicated by the spirit of God has he
[1:04:33] done it you say well that was back in
[1:04:35] 1965 no has he done it in 2025
[1:04:39] has he not proved his word in your life
[1:04:41] today. Oh, if we could just go back
[1:04:43] there. No, this day. This day. Amen.
[1:04:46] Where the son of man, brother Ram said,
[1:04:47] the son of man is revealed in human
[1:04:50] beings. Many people want to put it the
[1:04:52] son of man. Luke 17:30 just on the
[1:04:54] prophet. No, that same ministry is
[1:04:56] continued on in you and I. Has he done
[1:04:59] it? Amen. Where all of us are, the
[1:05:00] manifestation of the son of man.
[1:05:03] Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] Amen. So, I'm I'm so thankful the same
[1:05:08] God back in the prophet's life is here.
[1:05:11] Same God, same quality, same Holy Ghost,
[1:05:15] same ability. He hasn't diminished. We
[1:05:17] don't have to look back in a rearview
[1:05:18] mirror and just say, "I wish I was back
[1:05:20] there." No, the same one is with you.
[1:05:22] Hallelujah. Amen. So, and vindicated by
[1:05:25] the spirit in the full strength as it
[1:05:27] was when he is here on earth. Uh here on
[1:05:30] earth, manifested in the same way, doing
[1:05:32] the same things that it did when it was
[1:05:34] here on earth. Amen. Hebrews 3:8 said
[1:05:36] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:05:37] today, and forever. In Luke 17:30, Jesus
[1:05:40] said, "In the last days, as it was in
[1:05:42] the days of Sodom, when the Son of Man
[1:05:43] will be revealing himself again, it'll
[1:05:45] be the same thing. The world is in a
[1:05:47] Sodom condition, the church has has went
[1:05:49] into Sodom with it, like Lot and his
[1:05:51] wife." And I say that there is an
[1:05:52] elected church somewhere in the world
[1:05:55] that's pulling out and set aside from
[1:05:57] those things. And the manifestation of
[1:05:59] God has attracted its attention where at
[1:06:01] the last days, the shook has give forth
[1:06:03] its strength into the seed. It's went on
[1:06:06] out. It was a good shook. It has served
[1:06:08] its time. But see, it's the bride. It's
[1:06:11] the word bride of the word groom. I say
[1:06:15] this day, this is fulfilled. I trust it
[1:06:18] ain't too strong. But the we're here. We
[1:06:20] have arrived. I mean, what? We're not
[1:06:22] waiting for another messenger to come.
[1:06:24] We're not waiting for someone to come
[1:06:25] and open the book. It's been opened. The
[1:06:28] the Bible's no longer a mystery. If
[1:06:30] someone preaches all the mysteries of
[1:06:32] the mysteries of the mysteries, no. It's
[1:06:33] made plain these days. Amen. The word
[1:06:36] has come open. What to do? To produce a
[1:06:38] word bride.
[1:06:40] Amen. And that is who you are. You say
[1:06:42] me and my problems.
[1:06:45] Absolutely. We have this humanity that
[1:06:47] we live in. Does that stop God? No. God
[1:06:50] wants to reveal deity within humanity.
[1:06:53] Amen. He wants to use you and manifest
[1:06:56] his word out of your life. Hallelujah.
[1:06:59] Brother Anne would say, "Now the seventh
[1:07:00] age is a very short age. It gathers up
[1:07:02] into itself for one quick work all the
[1:07:05] evil of every age and yet all the
[1:07:06] reality of Pentecost. Amen. Once the
[1:07:09] Philadelphiaian age has run its course,
[1:07:10] the Ladyian age quickly comes in
[1:07:12] bringing uh both the tears and the wheat
[1:07:15] to harvest this day. We're here. Amen.
[1:07:20] You know, some people will say, "Well,
[1:07:21] we're back to wheat again. We just got
[1:07:23] to lay in the presence of the sun."
[1:07:25] Absolutely. But what did the wheat do in
[1:07:27] the beginning?
[1:07:29] You know, some people say there's no
[1:07:30] manifestation anymore because we're not
[1:07:32] the tassel or the shook or whatever.
[1:07:34] It's just wheat. But what did the wheat
[1:07:36] do in the beginning? What did the first
[1:07:38] wheat do?
[1:07:41] Read the life of Jesus Christ. You'll
[1:07:42] see what the first week, the main thing
[1:07:44] is he was led by the spirit of God. He
[1:07:47] subjected himself to the word that he
[1:07:49] was to fulfill. That's the most
[1:07:51] supernatural thing you'll ever see is a
[1:07:53] man or woman that will surrender their
[1:07:54] full lives to the word of God. Above
[1:07:56] miracles, above anything will be God
[1:07:58] will be a man or woman surrendered
[1:08:00] completely to the word of God. Amen.
[1:08:03] Then you see you see in the day of
[1:08:05] Pentecost, you see the church before it
[1:08:07] fell. Amen. What what was it? It was it
[1:08:10] was the grain back again doing exactly
[1:08:12] the same life. Amen. Devils were cast
[1:08:14] out. The word was manifested. People
[1:08:16] were birthed into the kingdom. Amen.
[1:08:19] Revelation, you know, struck their
[1:08:20] souls. They you on the day of Pentecost,
[1:08:22] they forgot all their formality. Amen.
[1:08:25] as they staggered under the stimulation
[1:08:26] of the revelation that God who made
[1:08:28] heavens and earth was now in them. Amen.
[1:08:31] They were led by the spirit of God.
[1:08:33] Persecution didn't stop them.
[1:08:36] When persecution struck them, do you
[1:08:38] know what they did? They had a prayer
[1:08:39] meeting. They had a prayer meeting
[1:08:41] because they realized the enemy was
[1:08:42] trying to stop the life of God being
[1:08:44] expressed in their lives. They gathered
[1:08:46] together. They prayed. God came down,
[1:08:48] shook the place, and gave them boldness.
[1:08:50] And they w went out, Amen. Preaching
[1:08:52] more than they did before that ever
[1:08:53] happened. I pray we do the same thing.
[1:08:56] Amen. Because he is your source of
[1:08:57] strength. Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] Amen. That's what they did. They were.
[1:09:02] But more most importantly, the life they
[1:09:05] lived, the life they had was the life of
[1:09:07] Christ himself dwelling in them. That
[1:09:10] was the beginning. You say, "Well, I'm
[1:09:12] not a preacher, an apostle, or
[1:09:13] anything." Well, you know, we read in
[1:09:15] Acts chapter 9, there was a woman who
[1:09:17] was called Tabatha, and she, you know,
[1:09:19] she was full of good works and did arms
[1:09:21] and deeds. you know, you know, arms and
[1:09:23] deeds, which she did, and you know, she
[1:09:24] got sick and died. And, you know, they
[1:09:26] called Peter to come and raise her from
[1:09:27] the dead. And before he did, you know,
[1:09:29] they would show him of all the coats and
[1:09:31] garments that Dorcas or Tabitha made
[1:09:33] while she was with them. So, he was just
[1:09:35] a sister full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:37] she's being a blessing to the people
[1:09:39] everyday kind of life. I'm making this,
[1:09:41] I'm sewing this, I'm selling this, I'm
[1:09:43] doing this. She was part of the body. We
[1:09:46] all have a function. We're all important
[1:09:49] in the body of Christ. I I I I trust
[1:09:52] you're with me uh this afternoon. Amen.
[1:09:54] See, it's more than just preaching or
[1:09:55] anything like that. No, we're all part
[1:09:57] of the body. You see, and it doesn't
[1:10:00] matter what age we are, you're important
[1:10:02] to God. Amen. Every age, young, old, in
[1:10:05] between, you're all important. But the
[1:10:07] thing is, we get to a stage where, you
[1:10:09] know, there always comes a time when the
[1:10:10] next generation rises up. Amen. And
[1:10:14] that's a very exciting time for me, for
[1:10:17] a younger generation to step up and take
[1:10:19] their place. Amen. to see young people
[1:10:21] have a revival. I mean, see the same God
[1:10:23] that called us calls them. I mean, the
[1:10:25] same God gives you the same experiences
[1:10:27] now does the same thing for them. Where
[1:10:29] they see this word as a reality where it
[1:10:31] becomes more than your story, it becomes
[1:10:32] their story. More than your testimony
[1:10:34] becomes their testimony. Where they see
[1:10:36] the living God living in them. And I say
[1:10:40] we must be very careful how we treat our
[1:10:42] young people. We never want to sell them
[1:10:44] a gospel that doesn't work. I mean, we
[1:10:46] want to give them a gospel that produces
[1:10:48] what it says it will do. Amen. That they
[1:10:50] can stand and they can say, "This day,
[1:10:52] amen, the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:54] cleanses. This day, Calvary works. This
[1:10:57] day, the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:59] true. This day, God's word is right.
[1:11:01] It's true. And it's here to meet every
[1:11:03] need." Amen. You see, but what happens
[1:11:06] is many times we'll swing from one
[1:11:08] extreme to the other. David was a time
[1:11:10] when he was fighting and he got old and
[1:11:12] you know he was fighting against the
[1:11:14] Philistines and you know he got tired in
[1:11:15] the battle and one of one of the sons of
[1:11:18] Goliath nearly killed him and actually
[1:11:20] thought he did that Abashai um um got up
[1:11:23] his sword and he killed that giant and
[1:11:24] he helped David but then they told David
[1:11:27] after the battle he says thou shalt know
[1:11:29] thou shalt go no more out uh with us to
[1:11:32] battle that thou quench not the light of
[1:11:34] Israel you know what they should have
[1:11:36] done they should have said David don't
[1:11:38] be in the front anymore
[1:11:39] We need you in our ranks. Amen. We need
[1:11:42] you in our ranks. Cuz you think about it
[1:11:44] now. Here's here's David. What a
[1:11:46] powerful testimony just to be among
[1:11:50] them. Here's here's the king of Here's
[1:11:53] the king of Israel. Man after God's own
[1:11:55] heart. He slew a lion, slew bear, killed
[1:11:58] Goliath. H has these mighty testimonies.
[1:12:00] Would would pick up his harp and play a
[1:12:02] song and God would come down and amen do
[1:12:05] all these mighty things. But you see,
[1:12:07] they told him to stay home. We're not
[1:12:09] called to stay home. We're called to
[1:12:11] come to the battle, was that come to
[1:12:13] church. Come to church. Be part of a
[1:12:15] body. Amen. Don't stay home. Be part of
[1:12:18] a body. Say, "Well, I'm not important."
[1:12:21] Your testimony is important. I mean, you
[1:12:23] think about the testimony you carry. You
[1:12:25] may take it for granted, but someone may
[1:12:27] just be admiring what you've just come
[1:12:29] through, and you're still a believer,
[1:12:31] and it gives them strength. It
[1:12:32] encourages them. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:12:35] Lord. Goliath, you know, Goliath rallied
[1:12:39] or or or gave morale to the Philistines
[1:12:41] when he was in the battle. I I asked the
[1:12:43] question, how much more the Lord's
[1:12:45] anointed that's in our midst? You say,
[1:12:47] just little old me, what have I done?
[1:12:49] You've got a testimony. Your testimony
[1:12:51] is powerful. You say, "Well, I've I was
[1:12:54] just raised in church. I gave my life to
[1:12:56] God and God." That's powerful.
[1:12:58] Amen. God's kept you. Amen. God's
[1:13:01] protected you. God's been walking with
[1:13:03] you since a young child. Don't let
[1:13:04] anyone or the devil especially diminish
[1:13:06] that.
[1:13:08] Amen. I mean, you're an encouragement
[1:13:11] when you come to church. Amen. With your
[1:13:13] praying and with your amening being
[1:13:15] being part of the body. We all need one
[1:13:17] another. But you see that Israel came to
[1:13:20] a place in that in that season where
[1:13:21] there had to be more giant killers
[1:13:23] raised up. So David had to get a place
[1:13:26] where he wax faint because he had to
[1:13:27] diminish and then the others had to
[1:13:29] raise up to their position cuz you know
[1:13:31] you think about it what's more important
[1:13:33] well what's what's better one giant
[1:13:35] killer or four? Well five counting David
[1:13:39] I'd rather five you see so David had to
[1:13:42] diminish a bit for these young ones to
[1:13:44] step into their position. Amen. So we
[1:13:47] must not stop the young people raising
[1:13:49] up because there's giant killers in
[1:13:51] these few rows here. These young there's
[1:13:53] giant killers here. Amen. Have a
[1:13:55] testimony that God God lives.
[1:13:58] Hallelujah.
[1:13:59] Amen. See, my heart's desire is just say
[1:14:02] for argument's sake, someone comes into
[1:14:04] my church and they can take the with
[1:14:07] with a true pastorial gift and they can
[1:14:09] take the people further than I ever
[1:14:11] could. I'd say, "Praise God." Amen. Take
[1:14:15] us on further. And I'm not going to stay
[1:14:17] at home. I'll support unless God calls
[1:14:18] me somewhere else. But you know what I
[1:14:20] mean, right? We want we want the next
[1:14:21] generation to rise up above ourselves.
[1:14:24] Amen. We ain't the apex. There's more to
[1:14:26] grow in this thing.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah.
[1:14:30] Amen. But you see now what happens is is
[1:14:33] uh men are a funny creature. All the
[1:14:36] sisters said amen
[1:14:38] quietly. We're a funny
[1:14:41] creature. We go from extremes. You see,
[1:14:43] David went from the front line to
[1:14:45] sitting at home. He didn't he didn't
[1:14:48] actually weigh up the situation and said
[1:14:49] actually no no I'm valuable in the
[1:14:51] battle maybe not at the front but you
[1:14:53] know just I'm I'm valuable my presence
[1:14:55] just here is going to make an impact but
[1:14:57] you see he stayed at home now the thing
[1:14:59] is that men are funny in a way is that
[1:15:02] is that they want to if they're not
[1:15:05] careful we will become like Elohim the
[1:15:08] self-existing one with his
[1:15:13] thoughts if we're not careful and this
[1:15:15] is what this modern world wants to do.
[1:15:18] It wants to make us think there's no
[1:15:20] more adventure in life. Suburban,
[1:15:22] boring, you know, if you live I live in
[1:15:24] suburbia, but you know what I mean? Like
[1:15:26] like it's just this there's nowhere to
[1:15:28] explore in here,
[1:15:30] right? The devil has tried to sell the
[1:15:33] gospel to to to us as men, saying just
[1:15:36] be a good boy and you've made it. That
[1:15:39] ain't the gospel. We should be good
[1:15:42] boys, but it ain't just behaving. That's
[1:15:45] that that's even not it. No, no. There's
[1:15:47] brother Bram says there's untapped
[1:15:48] resources in God that men have not
[1:15:51] tapped into yet. So you see what happens
[1:15:53] is is is God See, see the devil wants to
[1:15:56] make us like God was before there was
[1:15:58] anything. God existed with his thoughts
[1:16:00] alone. Was he happy that
[1:16:03] way? No. Well, how do I know he wasn't
[1:16:06] happy that way? I'm here. He wanted
[1:16:09] someone to express himself to. You see
[1:16:12] he had
[1:16:13] see I don't any but you see what happens
[1:16:17] is man what the devil wants to make man
[1:16:20] alone with his thoughts God never
[1:16:22] intended us to to God never intended to
[1:16:25] stay that way he doesn't want us to
[1:16:28] become that way just alone or she does
[1:16:32] they don't understand me she doesn't
[1:16:33] understand me my nothing box is where I
[1:16:36] can bounce around in and that's all fine
[1:16:39] no we don't want to stay in our nothing
[1:16:42] Someone's got to break the cycle
[1:16:45] of this, right? So, because what happens
[1:16:48] is, you know, man comes to a certain age
[1:16:50] and then they think, well, you know,
[1:16:51] they've been pursuing for so long. They
[1:16:53] pursued their wife, now they got
[1:16:55] children, their children get to a
[1:16:57] certain age, their career comes to a
[1:16:58] certain plateau point and they just
[1:17:00] begin to say, I'm finished. I tell you
[1:17:02] what, now that's when you just start.
[1:17:05] Amen. That's when you just start. Don't
[1:17:07] start withdrawing within yourself,
[1:17:09] becoming a self-existing one just with
[1:17:11] your thoughts. No, we've got to go
[1:17:13] beyond that. See, David, see, see, you
[1:17:16] know, I was thinking about this driving
[1:17:18] here. What is more valuable to you? Your
[1:17:21] nothing box or your
[1:17:23] family. You make your actions actually
[1:17:26] prove what you value more. Because if
[1:17:29] you're alone with your thoughts, your
[1:17:30] nothing box is more important to you
[1:17:32] than your family.
[1:17:34] And that's how the devil wants you to
[1:17:36] be.
[1:17:38] We're not called to live in our nothing
[1:17:40] box. It's called a nothing box for a
[1:17:42] reason. You can fill out the rest of the
[1:17:45] sentence. There's no value. There's
[1:17:46] nothing of value in it. Okay? We got to
[1:17:49] go beyond that. Every part of life is a
[1:17:52] is is an opportunity to express the word
[1:17:56] of God, how we feel. I'm sorry we've
[1:17:58] gone pastoral here, but here we are.
[1:18:00] This is just I've been thinking about
[1:18:01] these things. See, we got to go beyond
[1:18:02] these things where we won't just settle
[1:18:04] down. Because you see, David had spent
[1:18:06] all these years fighting and building
[1:18:07] the kingdom. But then he decided to stay
[1:18:09] at home. And he spent too much time
[1:18:12] looking from his balcony at what his
[1:18:13] neighbors were doing. And that's where
[1:18:16] Bashibba came in because he decided to
[1:18:19] sit at home. He had to go beyond those
[1:18:22] things. We all have a position in the
[1:18:25] body. I'll tell you what, never let
[1:18:28] jealousy rob you. Amen. I maybe segueing
[1:18:31] somewhere, but the thing is, if you're
[1:18:32] jealous of someone else doing well,
[1:18:34] that's not the spirit of God. Amen. If
[1:18:36] you're jealous of people got a pay rise
[1:18:38] or a new job or a better house or a
[1:18:40] better car, that's a jealous spirit that
[1:18:43] came out of hell. That doesn't belong in
[1:18:45] your life. You don't need it. It ain't
[1:18:47] going to help you fulfill the word of
[1:18:49] God or live a happy, victorious life.
[1:18:51] Amen. You sit there with your own
[1:18:52] thoughts singing, "No one understands
[1:18:54] me." Get out of that comfort zone.
[1:18:57] Amen.
[1:18:59] Why? Because we're all a valuable part
[1:19:00] of the body.
[1:19:03] Amen. See, don't stay at home. See,
[1:19:06] brother Bam says this in Jehovah Jar 57.
[1:19:08] He says there's nothing good in any of
[1:19:09] us. But when you forget about preachers
[1:19:11] and personalities and look at the Lord
[1:19:12] Jesus Christ, then you're going to get
[1:19:14] somewhere. Take God at his word. See,
[1:19:17] people say, "Oh, but the preachers like
[1:19:18] this or the church is like this." Look
[1:19:19] beyond that. We all I've given you a
[1:19:23] lifetime ammunition of false right since
[1:19:25] I've been standing here. Something to
[1:19:27] criticize. Look beyond the the thing to
[1:19:29] criticize.
[1:19:31] Look beyond and look to the promise of
[1:19:32] God.
[1:19:35] Amen. But you see now, but we live in a
[1:19:37] time where man wants to be stuck in a
[1:19:40] nothing box. But I tell it's time to
[1:19:42] bust out,
[1:19:44] do
[1:19:46] differently. Amen. We live in a season
[1:19:48] where God is here to fulfill his word.
[1:19:50] So I'm just going to come back to what I
[1:19:51] was speaking about. Now, the armor
[1:19:53] company girl,
[1:19:55] she spent many years as a as an orphan
[1:19:58] working on her cousin's farm and all
[1:20:00] these things, just being basically their
[1:20:01] slave. But there came a moment in her
[1:20:03] life that changed her life forever. She
[1:20:06] was washing dishes. She wasn't part of
[1:20:08] the party, you know, with the, you know,
[1:20:09] the armor company boy came to the ranch
[1:20:11] and and and her cousins were trying to
[1:20:14] get him to marry marry them and all
[1:20:15] these things. They had a big hoown
[1:20:17] shindig and, you know, she wasn't
[1:20:18] invited. and she was she was pouring out
[1:20:20] dish water while the music's blaring in
[1:20:22] the barn and all these things and he
[1:20:24] slipped out and saw her and they begin
[1:20:27] to have a conversation and he said to
[1:20:29] her, "You know, I've been noticing you
[1:20:31] around and and and and and he just
[1:20:33] proposed to her. Will you marry me?" And
[1:20:36] she thought, "How on earth could this,
[1:20:37] you know, this kind of a guy want me?"
[1:20:40] Didn't you feel that same way the L when
[1:20:42] the Lord found you?
[1:20:44] But he said, "I see quality in you that
[1:20:46] they don't have." And there's a quality
[1:20:49] in you and I that is greater than what
[1:20:51] the world has. There's that gene seed of
[1:20:54] God in you. I mean, that quality, that
[1:20:56] God part of you that's in you before the
[1:20:58] foundation of the world. That thing is
[1:21:00] what the Lord is looking for. He's
[1:21:01] looking for parts of himself. You know,
[1:21:04] I know I've said this before, but you
[1:21:05] know, there are times when I would used
[1:21:07] to go to the girls primary school and
[1:21:08] pick them up from school and, you know,
[1:21:10] I would get to their classroom before
[1:21:12] the bell went. They couldn't see me
[1:21:13] there, but I could see them. When I went
[1:21:16] into that school, I wasn't looking for
[1:21:18] just any young girl. I wasn't looking
[1:21:20] even just for a girl the same age as my
[1:21:22] girls. I was looking for them.
[1:21:24] Hallelujah. And I wasn't leaving the
[1:21:26] grounds until they came home with me.
[1:21:29] It's the same thing with this, you know,
[1:21:30] with our Lord Jesus Christ. He ain't
[1:21:32] just looking for anybody. Anybody can
[1:21:34] come, but he ain't looking for anybody.
[1:21:36] He's looking for his bride. He's looking
[1:21:38] for people like you and I. Amen. Washed
[1:21:40] in his blood with that seat of God on
[1:21:42] the inside of them. Amen.
[1:21:44] Hallelujah. So now he came to her and
[1:21:48] said and said now will you marry me? And
[1:21:51] of course she said yes. And he said in a
[1:21:53] year's time I'm going to come back take
[1:21:57] you to Chicago. You won't live here
[1:21:59] anymore. So basically he said when you
[1:22:01] see the same season come back around
[1:22:03] again I'm going to come get you. Now she
[1:22:07] would live a year in the same house
[1:22:10] doing the same chores living the same
[1:22:12] old life. But he he had given her his
[1:22:15] word of promise and she believed that
[1:22:18] word of promise. And this message is the
[1:22:20] word of promise of almighty God to you
[1:22:22] saying, "I ain't going to leave you
[1:22:23] here. I ain't going to let you go
[1:22:25] through a great tribulation. My blood
[1:22:27] works." Amen. Calvary is Amen. has
[1:22:30] produced a people that will not taste
[1:22:32] death, but will go in a rapture. Amen.
[1:22:35] So, so she was given his word of
[1:22:37] promise. I'm coming back for you in a
[1:22:39] year. So, now she had a year now. Maybe,
[1:22:41] you know, I'd like to think that that
[1:22:43] that um uh it was springtime when he
[1:22:47] came and proposed to her. I just like to
[1:22:49] think it's
[1:22:50] springtime. Sounds nice. Not winter. No,
[1:22:53] springtime. Maybe that's just me. So,
[1:22:55] she realized when that same season comes
[1:22:57] back around again, he's coming back to
[1:23:00] get me. Amen. So, so you know, she
[1:23:03] realized that, you know, she goes
[1:23:04] through summer, she ain't going to live
[1:23:06] through it again. Autumn comes, she
[1:23:08] ain't going to live through another
[1:23:09] autumn again. There's a difference in
[1:23:11] her life now cuz she's got a word of
[1:23:13] promise, right? There become, you know,
[1:23:15] winter and doesn't and it didn't matter
[1:23:17] how cold the winter got. Didn't matter
[1:23:19] how much the wi, you know, cold winds
[1:23:21] blow of trouble and unbelief and all
[1:23:23] these things. She ain't going to go
[1:23:24] through it again. Amen. Why? Because she
[1:23:27] was holding on to his word of promise.
[1:23:30] Amen. Because his word of promise broke
[1:23:32] the cycle of the mundane in her life.
[1:23:35] Sure, she did the same thing. Sure, she
[1:23:37] lived the same kind of life, but it was
[1:23:38] different. Now, why? because he was
[1:23:40] coming back for her. I pray we have that
[1:23:42] same kind of thing anchored in our
[1:23:44] souls. He's coming back for me.
[1:23:47] Amen. He's coming back for me. So I say
[1:23:49] this, whatever season that your life is
[1:23:51] in, make the most of it. Enjoy being a
[1:23:55] child. Play till your heart's
[1:23:59] content. Okay. Okay. Well, children, you
[1:24:03] guys have toys. Help me out
[1:24:05] someone. We had to go buy some toys.
[1:24:09] Enjoy being a teenager.
[1:24:12] Amen. If you're a single adult, enjoy
[1:24:15] being single. Enjoy it. Amen. If you get
[1:24:18] married, enjoy marriage life. Enjoy
[1:24:20] every stage of it. Never let your spouse
[1:24:22] become common to you. Amen. When
[1:24:25] children come along, enjoy them. They
[1:24:27] will never be that age again. We know
[1:24:30] some with toddlers are saying, "Praise
[1:24:31] God," but for a different
[1:24:34] reason. But they'll never be that age
[1:24:36] again. I remember when my eldest I used
[1:24:39] to have to actually bend over to hold
[1:24:40] her hand as we walked. She ain't that
[1:24:42] age anymore. Why? She's grown up.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah. She was that age once. Enjoy
[1:24:48] that age. Whatever age they are. Well,
[1:24:50] you say now they're growing up children.
[1:24:52] Enjoy them as adults. Don't take it for
[1:24:54] granted. God has given us one life.
[1:24:57] Amen. You get grandchildren. Enjoy them.
[1:25:00] Spoil them real
[1:25:02] good. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, now
[1:25:05] I'm old. Now my best years are behind
[1:25:07] me. No way. I miss the good old days.
[1:25:10] Right now should be the best day. Right
[1:25:13] now should be the best day. Amen. This
[1:25:15] should be the best time of life right
[1:25:17] now. You know, it's like brother
[1:25:18] Bosworth, he was he was on his deathbed
[1:25:20] and you know, Brother Bram went to go
[1:25:21] see him and you know, brother Bosworth
[1:25:24] um you know was asked by brother Bram,
[1:25:25] "Can I pray for you?" And brother
[1:25:27] Bosworth said, "No, I'm not sick." And
[1:25:28] then so Brother Bram asked him, "Well,
[1:25:30] what's wrong?" Brother Bosworth just
[1:25:31] said, "Well, I'm just going home." And
[1:25:34] you know, And then he asked so so so
[1:25:36] brother asked him what is the greatest
[1:25:38] time of your life and your ministry? Is
[1:25:41] it when we're in South Africa? Is it
[1:25:43] when you saw demons cast out people heal
[1:25:45] people come to the Lord? All these
[1:25:46] things he said no right now is the best
[1:25:50] time of my life because all I've lived
[1:25:53] for brother has been Jesus Christ and
[1:25:55] any minute he'll walk in the door to
[1:25:56] take me home.
[1:25:59] We don't have to get old for that to be
[1:26:01] fulfilled. He could come in right this
[1:26:03] afternoon. That'll be fine by me. But in
[1:26:06] the meantime, live every day and cherish
[1:26:08] every day. Don't take every day for
[1:26:10] granted. There's a purpose in every day.
[1:26:13] Amen. This bride's revival should be
[1:26:15] lived in everyday life. Amen. No matter
[1:26:17] what you're going through, what you're
[1:26:19] facing, it's a precious moment. It's a
[1:26:22] precious season. You may never go
[1:26:24] through this season
[1:26:26] again. Amen. So, don't ever take it for
[1:26:28] granted. Well, I'm going through a
[1:26:30] trial. Yeah, you're going through a
[1:26:31] trial. You don't ending up in that
[1:26:33] trial. You're going through it. Amen. We
[1:26:36] should be living under expectation that
[1:26:38] at any moment he'll come and take us
[1:26:41] home. Because the armor company girl, he
[1:26:44] she got to the end of winter. And then
[1:26:47] the and then the wind begin to change.
[1:26:50] The daylight got longer. The buds begin
[1:26:52] to come on the tree. Life came back into
[1:26:54] the tree again. There's a restoration of
[1:26:57] the bride tree. Amen. In this season,
[1:26:59] God be to move again. It wasn't the
[1:27:01] coldness of winter and splits and fusses
[1:27:03] and fighters, you know, all these false
[1:27:05] doctrines. No, the sun had risen.
[1:27:08] Hallelujah. The sun, the word has risen.
[1:27:11] Amen. The word has risen again. The
[1:27:13] temperature has raised. I'm talking
[1:27:16] spiritually now because we know we're in
[1:27:17] autumn time, right? But spiritually, we
[1:27:18] ain't in an autumn time. Amen. We're in
[1:27:21] a season where the season has come back
[1:27:23] around again. Where the same God that
[1:27:25] was with the prophet is with us now in
[1:27:27] reality.
[1:27:29] Amen. We've come back into that season.
[1:27:31] Amen. Where all things are possible.
[1:27:33] We've come back into the season of the
[1:27:34] spirit of God moving.
[1:27:37] We've come back into a I say this day,
[1:27:40] I'm not I don't think I'm crazy. I think
[1:27:42] I know where I am in the scripture. I
[1:27:44] believe we've come back into that season
[1:27:45] where God where we've come back to a
[1:27:47] place where we realize we are saved by
[1:27:49] grace. God's found me. He's kept me.
[1:27:51] He's moving me. He's living in my life.
[1:27:53] It's nothing I have done. It's all him.
[1:27:55] What? That that's a springtime coming
[1:27:58] back again. Amen. It's a time when the
[1:28:00] first love has been restored back into
[1:28:02] the church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:04] Amen. Why? Because God is saying that
[1:28:07] now in this season, be under
[1:28:09] expectation. I'm coming to take you
[1:28:12] home. Amen. Where the full word is in
[1:28:14] manifestation again. Where we've gone
[1:28:16] back. We've gone back. Grain has
[1:28:18] returned again. We're living in a bride
[1:28:21] age, an age within an age as we heard
[1:28:22] this morning. Hallelujah. I'm so
[1:28:24] thankful for that. I'm so glad we're not
[1:28:26] in Lady Oia. We've been lifted up above
[1:28:28] it. We may be walking in it, but we're
[1:28:29] not part of it. Amen. Why? Because the
[1:28:32] anointing of God is so great. You know,
[1:28:33] God, I love it how he does it. God says,
[1:28:36] "I'm going to prove Calvary to his
[1:28:38] enemy." Well, how you going to do that?
[1:28:40] I'm going to make I'm going to let you,
[1:28:42] Satan, make this world the worst it's
[1:28:44] ever been.
[1:28:45] And I'm going to put her in that age.
[1:28:48] Everything's going to be against her,
[1:28:50] and she's going to walk out victorious.
[1:28:52] She's going to be an overcomer. She's
[1:28:54] going to put you under her feet. She's
[1:28:56] going to believe my word. She's going to
[1:28:58] go through many trials and dangers and
[1:29:00] hardship and pain and sorrow. Yet, she
[1:29:02] will still believe me. And there's
[1:29:04] nothing you can do, Satan, to stop her.
[1:29:06] You'll throw everything you can at her,
[1:29:08] but you can't stop her. Hallelujah. This
[1:29:11] day,
[1:29:13] amen. I say that is fulfilled. You know,
[1:29:15] brother Ram said that a man can be so
[1:29:16] surrendered to God, even the devil don't
[1:29:18] know what to do with
[1:29:20] him. He'll try everything he can. Still
[1:29:24] standing. Why? Because of your ability.
[1:29:27] No way. Because of his ability. Amen. We
[1:29:30] would all be gone if it wasn't for him
[1:29:32] without our Lord.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. You say,
[1:29:38] "Well, what happens when things go
[1:29:40] things just go seem to go so wrong?"
[1:29:43] Well, you know, there was a lady lady um
[1:29:45] you know, in the message her her husband
[1:29:47] Julius Stadcliffe wrote the book Prophet
[1:29:49] Visit South Africa. And you know, they
[1:29:51] had a baby. They were living in Germany
[1:29:52] at the time. They working for the
[1:29:53] American military. and they had this
[1:29:55] baby, but then the baby passed away. And
[1:29:58] and and they they they they spoke to the
[1:30:01] leader of the army or whoever it was
[1:30:02] that to to to arrange a jet plane to get
[1:30:05] brother from America, fly over to
[1:30:07] Germany, pray for the baby, come back to
[1:30:08] life, and then and then brother to go
[1:30:11] back home. That was all arranged. But
[1:30:13] the Lord told brother Bram, "Don't touch
[1:30:15] that. That's my hand." And so she has to
[1:30:18] uh sorry, he has to call Mrs. Stadcliffe
[1:30:20] and say, "Sorry, this is the hand of the
[1:30:22] Lord." and they bury their baby there in
[1:30:24] Germany. And I don't know how long
[1:30:26] later, you know, brother Brown meets
[1:30:28] them. And you know, she asked a
[1:30:31] question. Didn't I have enough faith for
[1:30:34] my baby to be to be
[1:30:37] raised? And you know, was it a weakness
[1:30:39] of my faith? But he said to her, you
[1:30:42] have great faith. You prayed for your
[1:30:44] baby and your husband held on to God to
[1:30:46] raise that baby and he refused to do it
[1:30:48] because he knows what is best. And still
[1:30:50] you love him. still you love him.
[1:30:54] I'm sure we could put maybe not that
[1:30:56] thing of that magnitude. Maybe some of
[1:30:58] us have been through it, but there's
[1:30:59] still there's things that have happened
[1:31:00] in life and it seems like God has not
[1:31:02] answered the prayer, but yet we still
[1:31:04] love him. I trust we can be Christians
[1:31:07] when God says no, we still love him.
[1:31:10] It's easy when when when when it's just
[1:31:12] yes and there's no problems, but when it
[1:31:15] comes to no, when God says no, we still
[1:31:18] love him. Brother M says that's real
[1:31:21] faith. Remember, we've been restored
[1:31:23] back to the faith of the fathers. That's
[1:31:24] real faith. Anybody when the mountains
[1:31:26] are moving and things can have faith,
[1:31:28] but let it go backwards one time and see
[1:31:31] how it works. That's when you'll prove
[1:31:33] whether you got faith or not. Praise
[1:31:36] God. Hallelujah. I'm so thankful that
[1:31:38] I'm going to I'm going to wind this up
[1:31:40] real soon.
[1:31:43] Amen. But you see
[1:31:45] now you know the unseen world. I was
[1:31:48] going to finish with this. We've had a
[1:31:50] prophet stand in this age and he's
[1:31:51] standing. He says, "I'm standing in two
[1:31:53] worlds. I'm standing on the platform,
[1:31:55] but then I can see the eternal world."
[1:31:58] And he said, and he said many times,
[1:31:59] "Can't you see that pillar of fire over
[1:32:01] that person?" Many people couldn't see
[1:32:03] into that world, but they felt the
[1:32:05] effects of the pillar of fire and they'd
[1:32:07] be very moved and God would speak to
[1:32:09] them and change their lives. Now, we
[1:32:11] know that that same pillar of fire is
[1:32:13] here. He He said, "I'll never leave you
[1:32:15] nor forsake you." He said where two or
[1:32:17] three are gathered there I am in the
[1:32:18] midst. So he's present in this room.
[1:32:20] We're gathered in his name are we not?
[1:32:22] Hallelujah. And then he and then he and
[1:32:24] then brother Ram would say you know
[1:32:25] people would say I just don't understand
[1:32:27] what's going on. And but then he then he
[1:32:29] would say and go awake Jesus certainly
[1:32:30] he lives. He says that what's this
[1:32:33] you're bumping into all the time? What's
[1:32:36] that condemn you when you're wrong? What
[1:32:39] makes you believe that's him? Amen. So,
[1:32:42] we're walking on in life and we're just
[1:32:44] bumping bumping into God. Amen. He
[1:32:47] convicts us when we're wrong to make
[1:32:49] things right. And he causes us to
[1:32:50] believe his word and it's us bumping
[1:32:52] into God. And I'll say, you know, he
[1:32:54] says, you know, I feel a strange feeling
[1:32:56] here tonight. Looks to me like, you
[1:32:58] know, I want to cry or shout or
[1:32:59] something. He says, that's the angels of
[1:33:01] the Lord affecting people. Amen. And to
[1:33:05] me now, what is it? It is it is it is
[1:33:07] eternity bumping into God's children. I
[1:33:11] say it's your theophony. Everyone put it
[1:33:12] this way. It's your theophony bumping
[1:33:15] into you. It bumps into you. You give
[1:33:17] your life. Bumps into you. Get baptized.
[1:33:19] Bumps into you. Make things right. Bumps
[1:33:20] into you. You receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:22] You know, but eventually, but you see
[1:33:24] now as God is pouring out his spirit
[1:33:26] more and
[1:33:27] more. We're being bumped into more and
[1:33:29] more. And what's going to happen then?
[1:33:31] One day, it's not just going to be a
[1:33:33] bump. It's going to be a molding
[1:33:35] together where it's going to carry us
[1:33:37] out of this dimension. You know, heaven
[1:33:39] is not that far away. It's just a faster
[1:33:41] dimension about this high, brother Ram
[1:33:43] said. And it's been influencing you your
[1:33:45] entire life. Hallelujah. And what's it
[1:33:48] going to do? Carry you away.
[1:33:54] Hallelujah. I say praise. I say this
[1:33:57] day. This day many more scriptures are
[1:34:00] fulfilled in this day. I say in your
[1:34:03] life many scriptures have been
[1:34:05] fulfilled.
[1:34:07] Amen. The full power of the blood has
[1:34:08] been displayed in your life this day.
[1:34:11] Why are you? Cuz you're a believer in
[1:34:12] Lady Oia. You're a believer in Satan's
[1:34:14] Eden. That's a victory in itself. It's a
[1:34:16] glorious thing. A to be a Christian in
[1:34:18] this day filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:20] That's a that's a glorious thing.
[1:34:24] Amen. Brother says, "How to overcome,
[1:34:26] keep life in you." I'm just going to
[1:34:28] close with these thoughts. Maybe we
[1:34:29] could have the musicians come. Don't
[1:34:30] want to be too long. He says to overcome
[1:34:32] is to keep life in you. Amen. So let the
[1:34:36] he said he said that's how so how do you
[1:34:38] keep the life of God in you? Keep the
[1:34:40] Holy Ghost around you. Never let a
[1:34:42] critical spirit get on you. Never be
[1:34:45] negative. Never be never be negative.
[1:34:48] Never never confess what the devil wants
[1:34:49] you to confess. No, you're more than an
[1:34:51] overcomer. You're more than a conqueror.
[1:34:55] Amen. This is the day when divine love
[1:34:57] is projected and sovereign grace takes
[1:34:59] its
[1:35:00] place. This is the day. this day. I know
[1:35:03] I've shared this before, but I'll share
[1:35:05] it again because you know, so I was in
[1:35:06] the Solomon Islands over a year ago in
[1:35:08] March and we were on this little island
[1:35:10] and you know, um I was there with a
[1:35:12] brother from Melbourne, Brother Jim
[1:35:14] Carman. And you know, I woke up one
[1:35:16] morning and he was praying for people
[1:35:17] downstairs outside and I heard this
[1:35:20] scream. It was a teenage girl, but it
[1:35:22] was unearly scream. It wasn't a human
[1:35:24] scream. And so I got up and I went down
[1:35:26] and you know, you know, he's dealing
[1:35:27] with this with this teenage girl and
[1:35:29] she's totally out of her mind. You can
[1:35:31] only see the white of her eyes. She's
[1:35:33] writhing and screaming and shouting. And
[1:35:35] I I asked her, "What is your name?" And
[1:35:37] she said, she just said, "My name is
[1:35:39] Satan." Screaming, "My name is Satan. My
[1:35:41] name is Satan." And so we prayed for her
[1:35:43] and she just passed out. And brother Jim
[1:35:46] Kman said, "Well, is she free?" I said,
[1:35:47] "No, I've seen this before. It's just
[1:35:49] the spirit making her cast out that I
[1:35:50] mean making her pass out that she won't
[1:35:52] be free." So prayed for her again. She
[1:35:54] came back just screaming and shouting
[1:35:57] and writhing and just so angry. And I
[1:35:59] thought to myself, what can I do,
[1:36:02] Lord? What can I do? But then such a
[1:36:06] love and compassion came over my life
[1:36:07] for her. This is just just anchored in
[1:36:09] my heart. The same blood that Jesus shed
[1:36:11] for me is the same blood was shed for
[1:36:14] her. And then I prayed for I just felt
[1:36:17] the love of God and that spirit was cast
[1:36:20] out of her life and she walked away from
[1:36:22] that normal healthy sound mind. Well,
[1:36:25] why? Because divine love was projected.
[1:36:28] and sovereign grace took its place.
[1:36:31] That's what go we live in this season
[1:36:34] this day and I'm sure it's happened many
[1:36:36] different people many different ways.
[1:36:38] But you see God wants sovereign divine
[1:36:40] love to be projected. That's why don't
[1:36:42] hate one another. Don't despise. Don't
[1:36:44] be resentful. Don't look down on anyone.
[1:36:46] Let the divine love of
[1:36:49] God take over and then sovereign grace
[1:36:52] can step in, take its place and do what
[1:36:54] God wants to do. Amen. We live in this
[1:36:56] season. I say this day all these things
[1:37:00] are fulfilled in our lives. So what can
[1:37:02] we do? We say thank you Lord. Thank you
[1:37:05] you found me. Thank you you've kept me.
[1:37:07] Thank you you're guiding me. Thank you
[1:37:09] you're opening your word to me. Thank
[1:37:11] you Lord. You've you you've saved me
[1:37:12] from many things. I've been in trouble
[1:37:14] and you and you saved me. I've been
[1:37:16] confused and you brought me a right
[1:37:17] mind. I was sick and you healed me. I
[1:37:20] was hungry and you fed me. I felt
[1:37:22] unlovable but you loved me, Lord. You've
[1:37:24] been so good. Hallelujah. Let's stand.
[1:37:27] Amen. This afternoon. Amen. I just pray
[1:37:29] God would take these bless chopped
[1:37:32] chopped up things and everything. We
[1:37:34] live in such a glorious day. Amen. You
[1:37:36] got a you got a song there, Brother
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:43] Isaac. Amen. I just want to speak the

[2:03:27] the Lord.
[2:03:29] Lord, we thank you that we have that
[2:03:31] great promise, Lord, that as we see,
[2:03:34] Lord, the unfolding and the unraveling
[2:03:36] of the world that we're in, Lord, we're
[2:03:39] so thankful that we don't rest our hopes
[2:03:41] here. We don't rest our dreams here. We
[2:03:43] don't rest our value here, Lord. But we
[2:03:45] rest our hope and our dreams and our
[2:03:47] value, Lord, in your everlasting
[2:03:49] kingdom, Lord. And in that in that
[2:03:52] realm, Lord, that's more real than this
[2:03:53] realm. So, we just want to pray you'll
[2:03:54] bless each one as we keep our minds
[2:03:56] focused upon you, Lord, and upon your
[2:03:59] work. As you said when you were here, I
[2:04:02] must be about my father's business. May
[2:04:04] each one of us be about our father's
[2:04:05] business while we're here. We know we've
[2:04:07] got to do this and do that to Lord to
[2:04:10] make things work and and things like
[2:04:11] that. But Lord, may our sole focus be
[2:04:13] upon you as even that what we heard this
[2:04:16] afternoon Lord that brother when he was
[2:04:18] on his FF Bossworth I believe it was he
[2:04:21] said all all my life I've labored for
[2:04:23] this I've labored for for the for you
[2:04:25] Lord and that one day you'll come
[2:04:26] through the door. May that be our
[2:04:28] testimony when we Lord when it's the end
[2:04:30] of the road we say all my life I've
[2:04:31] labored for the Lord and now he's going
[2:04:32] to come and meet me. May we not quickly
[2:04:34] try and shore things up just at the end,
[2:04:36] but may we serve you with all of our
[2:04:37] heart now, Lord, and and find what our
[2:04:40] calling is, Lord, and and serve you
[2:04:41] diligently in what you've given us and
[2:04:43] use all our talents for you, Lord. So, I
[2:04:45] just want to pray a blessing upon each
[2:04:46] one as we go away this evening. And may
[2:04:48] we just go rejoicing and walk in
