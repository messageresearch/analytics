[28:24] I'm not going to take a lot of time, but
[28:26] um for those of you who just joined us,
[28:28] I want to say welcome. Um I trust we all
[28:32] come with with cups held out to the Lord
[28:35] tonight, I trust that we all come with
[28:37] hearts ready to receive what the Lord
[28:39] has from for us.
[28:42] Amen. A lot of prayer has gone into
[28:44] this. there's some effort and planning
[28:46] and all sorts of
[28:48] things, but the main part is for us to
[28:51] receive what the Lord has for us in the
[28:54] meetings. So, I would like us to do do
[28:58] something a little different tonight.
[29:00] And um I'm going to let us sing welcome,
[29:02] welcome, and we welcome the Lord. And
[29:05] then after that, um, I'm going to pray,
[29:08] but I I also ask each one of you to
[29:10] pray, um, with me
[29:13] that I want to say, don't pray for
[29:16] yourself tonight. Pray for everyone
[29:19] else. Pray for maybe one that's here
[29:22] that doesn't really want to be here. Or
[29:25] maybe someone
[29:27] that has has gotten to the edge of fully
[29:32] surrendering to God but just never made
[29:34] that full surrender or someone that's
[29:37] battling with the beseing sin that's
[29:39] taking their joy away or whatever it is.
[29:41] We just want to bring all those ones to
[29:44] the Lord. So let's not rather than pray
[29:46] for ourselves tonight, let's let's pray
[29:47] for those around us. So let's just
[29:49] welcome the Lord now as we sing these
[29:51] words. Let these words be from our
[29:53] hearts, not just words. Amen. And we and
[29:56] we welcome the Holy Ghost among us and
[29:59] into our hearts as we sing it
[30:04] now. Welcome.

[31:38] Ghost we
[31:43] welcome
[31:46] thee. Let us pray and pray where you
[31:49] [Music]
[31:51] stand. Precious
[31:54] father, Lord Jesus, we come to you
[31:56] tonight.
[32:00] Father, we don't just want to have a
[32:03] campground experience, Father. Lord
[32:06] Jesus, your prophet preacher speaks
[32:08] about the campground cramps. We just go
[32:11] from revival to revival, from camp to
[32:14] camp. Father, that's not our desire,
[32:16] Lord. Father, we pray that tonight and
[32:19] throughout this weekend, Lord, that this
[32:21] will be a very special experience for
[32:23] each and every one of us,
[32:25] Lord. Oh, Father, we pray that your
[32:27] anointing will rest on these services.
[32:30] Oh Lord Jesus, I pray that your
[32:32] anointing will rest on the musicians
[32:33] that will play, the song leaders that
[32:35] will lead. Oh Lord, but Lord, more so
[32:38] your anointing on each one of us that
[32:41] will come in, Father, and sit under the
[32:43] ministry of your word, Father. Lord, I
[32:45] pray that your Holy Spirit will make,
[32:47] Lord, the word that you've inspired our
[32:50] brother to to speak to us, Lord. I pray
[32:52] that that same Holy Spirit, Father, will
[32:54] receive it in the hearts of each one of
[32:56] us, Father. Oh Lord Jesus, I bring to to
[32:59] you tonight, Father. Each one that's
[33:01] battling, Lord. Each one that's maybe
[33:03] had all sorts of things happen this
[33:05] week, Lord. No doubt Satan has attacked
[33:07] households and individuals, Lord, trying
[33:10] to steal our joy, break down our faith
[33:12] before we come, Lord. And tonight, we
[33:14] come against it in the name of our Lord
[33:16] Jesus Christ. Father, I pray that each
[33:19] one of us, Father, each one from the
[33:21] youngest to the oldest, Father, will
[33:22] come victoriously, Lord.
[33:25] Father, I pray that Lord, no tiredness
[33:29] or sickness or emotional downcastness or
[33:32] complexes or hurts or fears or
[33:35] indifference or anything, Father, will
[33:37] keep us away from that which you have
[33:39] for us. Lord, I pray, Father, that from
[33:42] this first service tonight, Lord, that
[33:44] we will have a a blessed experience,
[33:46] Father. that we will experience how you
[33:48] just take us and lift us up on your
[33:50] eagle wings, Father. And Lord, just let
[33:53] us fly with you, Lord. Oh, Father, I
[33:56] pray that you will set us free from our
[33:58] human thinking, our human attitudes, our
[34:00] human limitations, Father, each one of
[34:03] us, Father. Oh Lord, I just commit this
[34:05] camp to you. Lord, I also want to take a
[34:08] moment, Lord, to just dedicate this
[34:10] building to you, Father. If there's any
[34:12] lingering spirits from previous
[34:14] activities here, Lord, I I take it under
[34:17] control now in your name, Father. I
[34:19] pray, Lord Jesus, that your spirit will
[34:22] remove and cast out every evil spirit,
[34:25] Lord. Oh, Father, and I pray that you
[34:27] will just be free to move from the first
[34:29] moment, Lord. Oh, Father, I pray, Lord,
[34:31] that even if there's minds and hearts
[34:33] that's wondering, Lord, I pray, Father,
[34:36] that you will captivate it, Lord. And my
[34:38] father, I pray that you'll have our full
[34:40] attention on our full hearts, Lord.
[34:43] Father, I want to lift Brother
[34:44] Alistister before you tonight. Oh Lord,
[34:46] strengthen him, guide him, lead him, let
[34:49] him follow your leading as he as he just
[34:52] makes himself available. Father, we
[34:55] welcome you. We ask it in the precious
[34:58] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[35:02] Amen. Let's just sing that one more time
[35:03] as brother Alistister comes.
[35:05] [Music]
[35:07] Well, come
[35:10] well. Come
[35:12] [Music]
[35:17] well.
[35:23] Holy. We
[35:26] will come.
[35:30] [Music]
[35:32] Come with
[35:35] power this
[35:37] [Music]
[35:39] very
[35:42] hour.
[35:45] Holy
[35:47] Ghost we
[35:50] will come
[35:53] thee. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may
[35:55] be seated.
[35:59] I'd like to greet you in the glorious
[36:01] name of our Lord Jesus
[36:03] Christ and uh certainly happy to be here
[36:07] bring greetings from South Africa from
[36:10] Durban and uh from the saints there and
[36:13] we're thankful for this
[36:17] message that has uh united us and uh
[36:22] brought us together by the faith. I am
[36:25] always amazed when I have to travel. I'm
[36:29] not a great traveler, but I have been
[36:33] traveling of late and um it's just
[36:36] amazing when I see uh people from
[36:40] different lands and we meet together and
[36:43] it's like we know each other for
[36:46] forever.
[36:48] It's like we understand each other's
[36:50] lives
[36:52] and we can see each other's
[36:54] souls. It's just phenomenal.
[36:57] So, uh I just wanted to say I'm really
[37:00] uh grateful for brother Al's uh
[37:04] invitation and uh I know um I knew of
[37:09] him. I know his dad. His dad is in
[37:13] Margate and um in Durban or or just
[37:16] outside of Durban and we met I think it
[37:20] was 23 was it 23 and he came and uh
[37:24] preached in uh in Durban and did a youth
[37:27] meeting for us there and we met there
[37:29] for the first time.
[37:30] well met as you know spirits
[37:34] collided and we got to know each
[37:37] other and uh you know you you can be in
[37:40] church services and you can see someone
[37:42] and it looks like a familiar face but
[37:43] until your spirits come together you
[37:46] don't really know anybody and so uh I
[37:52] heard the things that he spoke and my
[37:54] spirit resonated with the things he
[37:56] spoke and what I saw without knowing too
[37:59] much about the man was the heart for
[38:01] people
[38:03] and that means everything to me.
[38:06] I going to speak about I think my
[38:09] testimony on the last service. So I'm
[38:12] going to try not to talk about
[38:14] it but so just quick introduction. Uh
[38:19] I'm a pastor for 25 years. I was
[38:22] pastoring since the age of 25 and I'm
[38:25] going to be 50 by uh
[38:27] December. And um I have a lovely wife
[38:31] who I love to bits and pieces and uh my
[38:36] three boys um and they're 20 going to be
[38:40] they're 22 19 and 8 and um so we have a
[38:46] very rockous loud house of normal
[38:50] people.
[38:52] I am probably the most abnormal of them
[38:55] all. And they call me
[38:58] grumpy and they tell me that the
[39:00] grandchildren are going to call me
[39:03] grandpa.
[39:05] So So I just want to let you know that
[39:09] uh I believe in being normal.
[39:13] There's a there's a quote where the
[39:15] prophet said, "God called us to be
[39:19] peculiar, not silly.
[39:22] That's a quote. And so that has really
[39:25] impacted my life because I've been in
[39:27] the message since a since a baby, since
[39:29] a toddler. And I have seen people take
[39:33] the truth and become silly instead of
[39:36] being
[39:36] peculiar. And you cannot affect the
[39:39] world or bring perfection to human life
[39:42] by being silly with the gospel, with the
[39:45] truth.
[39:47] So uh that's what is part of the passion
[39:51] of the ministry that God has given to
[39:54] me. I have no spiritual gifts. I do not
[39:58] see dreams or have visions or prophesy.
[40:01] All I can do is when I open the Bible
[40:03] and the message things just come alive.
[40:06] I can't explain it. And I just have this
[40:10] uh feeling inside that I have to make it
[40:12] simple to people. Make it
[40:14] understandable. make it uh easy to
[40:17] apply. And so being in the message um
[40:21] everything I'm talking about now is part
[40:23] of the service. So
[40:26] uh being in the message I have seen how
[40:30] things have progressed and I've learned
[40:33] one very important thing. Everything has
[40:37] to do with behaviors and
[40:39] natures. Everything.
[40:42] Because God's letter to the bride
[40:45] through the prophet when he said, "Pick
[40:46] up your pen and write." He starts with
[40:49] here's what I'm trying to say to you.
[40:50] I'm going to read the quote in a little
[40:52] while. It's all about
[40:55] seed and seed is about nature. And here
[40:58] you are in this life. You came through
[41:01] permissive will. You have a certain
[41:04] nature you're born with. But then God
[41:06] puts an eternal seed inside of you. And
[41:09] from there on, it's a battle of these
[41:11] two natures. One is the older twin and
[41:14] one is the younger. And they're both
[41:16] fighting inside this body. And you have
[41:20] a spurt that recognizes that seed and
[41:23] you want to submit to the Holy Spirit.
[41:25] But because you are your older twin is
[41:28] this human nature, it always seems to be
[41:31] winning the battle or it feels like it
[41:34] or maybe it's being bluffed into feel
[41:36] like feeling like it.
[41:39] The the thing though that that really
[41:42] bothered me is that the human nature has
[41:45] this ability to stagnate.
[41:49] And so when you find something exciting
[41:52] in the word or in the message, you stop
[41:54] there and have a revival around it. And
[41:56] you forget that the Christian life is a
[41:58] walk. You have to keep walking. You
[42:02] don't stop at some revival and make a an
[42:05] idea there. And so there's something
[42:09] that really uh bothers me about about
[42:12] the church. I feel like brother Bham
[42:15] said, I I'm no longer going to call you
[42:19] church. I'm going to call you bride so
[42:22] that you understand.
[42:24] And I think that's something that really
[42:27] needs to get a hold of us now in this
[42:30] capstone ministry. Look, we can talk
[42:33] about the mysteries. I can really
[42:35] there's so much I could spend the whole
[42:37] weekend and we could go through some
[42:38] fantastic slides and beautiful doctrines
[42:42] and and let me tell you by the end of it
[42:45] mostly those who have been reading and
[42:46] keeping in touch uh will be excited
[42:49] about a few things but the kids would be
[42:51] totally bored with us and we would have
[42:53] achieved
[42:54] nothing and I don't like achieving
[42:57] nothing.
[42:59] It really bothers me to leave a place
[43:01] and we've achieved nothing. Uh so I've
[43:04] resigned myself from now till the time
[43:07] that God is done with me to tell the
[43:10] truth
[43:12] and uh let the truth sort it out and
[43:16] speak that which is
[43:17] real. And the only way is like a good
[43:21] friend of ours in the message said we
[43:23] need to preach the seventh seal without
[43:26] saying seventh seal.
[43:28] You need to be able to preach the
[43:29] thunders without saying thunders because
[43:32] then it's not about buzzwords. It
[43:34] becomes something real. Amen. So the
[43:38] problem I see coming back to that is
[43:41] that if we are bride and not church, why
[43:46] is it that the church becomes our social
[43:50] crutch? Right? It's like we always keep
[43:53] depending on
[43:54] church and we even though we see a great
[43:58] revelation, it's like our human nature
[44:01] tugs us back. Yeah, but I still got to
[44:03] be church. I still got to keep that
[44:06] tradition. I still got to keep that and
[44:09] get stuck in it. So, what I'm saying is
[44:12] that do you believe you're in the
[44:13] capstone age? You're in the bride age?
[44:16] You believe you're the bride of Christ?
[44:18] But the tradition that we still keep is
[44:22] like we have to come to church and
[44:26] manage our mistakes.
[44:29] Exactly.
[44:31] That's church.
[44:34] Like why are we constantly fighting to
[44:37] manage our failures?
[44:40] Now most people in in the Bible had an
[44:43] objective. They had a purpose. They were
[44:45] going somewhere. They had a an ark to
[44:47] build. They had a land to get to. They
[44:50] had an enemy to defeat or they had an
[44:52] enemy chasing them. There was always a
[44:54] purpose. If you look at me churches
[44:57] today, what is the purpose?
[45:00] Everything about church is a one-man
[45:02] show. It's a the pastor preaches or
[45:04] whichever preacher is preaching and the
[45:07] people just sit and do nothing. When I
[45:09] say do nothing, I mean you all have your
[45:11] jobs. I mean, you can sweep the floors,
[45:14] you can clean the toilets, or you know,
[45:16] you can pass out him books if they still
[45:18] have that. We have it electronically
[45:20] now, I think. But we we all have
[45:23] different jobs, but church seems to be
[45:25] about
[45:26] managing issues. I don't know about you,
[45:29] but I'm tired of managing issues, right?
[45:33] Uh if you preach marriage and divorce,
[45:36] it's about preaching marriage and
[45:37] divorce to solve a problem. What about
[45:41] preaching so we don't get the problem?
[45:45] Right? We don't end up with that. And if
[45:48] we do, the solution is going to be
[45:50] argued about. Which school of thought
[45:52] are you with? Because I don't agree with
[45:54] that one and I don't agree with that
[45:55] one. That still sounds like church to
[45:57] me. It doesn't sound like people with an
[45:59] objective, with a purpose that they know
[46:02] where they're going, right? And so what
[46:04] happens is you have all these lovely
[46:06] young people here and they're kind of
[46:08] learning their what is my purpose? I got
[46:11] a purpose and their purpose they think
[46:13] is to to bluff all the elders that
[46:15] they're keeping the
[46:17] rules until they get married and then
[46:20] they you know and then they're done with
[46:22] that and then you got all the old people
[46:23] who said all right I've kept the rules
[46:25] long enough now you know now it's my
[46:28] time to just sit and be served you know
[46:30] I got nothing else to do now the
[46:32] ministry is over I'm a little feeble
[46:34] I'll just snap at someone here and there
[46:37] and you know what is what is our purpose
[46:41] And then the middle-aged people, men
[46:44] that you can see they're struggling with
[46:45] babies, they're tired, they're paying
[46:47] bills, they're going to to work. We
[46:49] basically don't know what there is that
[46:53] a message believer or a bride member has
[46:56] to do.
[46:58] And it's it's more like we're beating at
[47:00] the air and uh missing because we don't
[47:04] even know what is our enemy. We we even
[47:07] don't understand what it is that is
[47:10] happening with us and we're sitting back
[47:13] and confused like you know which one is
[47:15] really
[47:16] me the one who's faking it during the
[47:20] song service trying to show that I'm
[47:22] worshiping or the one that's really
[47:24] sincere when I'm alone praying to
[47:27] God which one should I bring out into
[47:30] the forefront and we end up being actors
[47:34] right that's not what the bride should
[47:36] be we should be truthful. We should be
[47:40] enjoying the word. We we should be so
[47:43] enjoying the word that we want the word
[47:45] to lead every part of our lives. Amen.
[47:49] So that's what I want to by the grace of
[47:52] God try to achieve this weekend. I want
[47:54] to stick try and stick to keeping it
[47:57] short so we don't I usually preach for 2
[48:00] hours per service. So this is going to
[48:02] be new for me and I'm usually in a suit.
[48:05] So, it's my it's my uh uh comfort. You
[48:08] know, I feel safe and confident when I'm
[48:11] there. But this is a camp. So, we're
[48:14] going to break all the rules and uh
[48:16] yeah, we're going to have some
[48:18] discussion and fellowship about it.
[48:20] Usually when when I also uh do camps as
[48:23] well, I get, you know, people to
[48:25] interrupt me and ask me a question and
[48:26] we have fellowship about it. But we'll
[48:28] just try and keep this to the way it is.
[48:31] So, I want to take a subject for the
[48:32] weekend. We're going to break it up
[48:34] into four parts and it's it's called how
[48:38] it all works. And this is going to be
[48:41] the teaching on the seed. How it all
[48:44] works. And as you can see there, I've
[48:46] got a wheat plant, right? Because the
[48:49] prophet speaks about it and how it all
[48:53] works because I want us to understand
[48:57] uh what is happening around you. Amen.
[49:02] Mhm. Don't beat at the air. Don't beat
[49:05] at an enemy that's not existing.
[49:08] Uh be accurate. Let the punches
[49:12] land. Know what you're dealing with.
[49:14] Know what know yourself. Know what God
[49:17] wants of you. So in this we're going to
[49:20] break things down and it's not going to
[49:22] be great mysteries. It's everything you
[49:24] know but just kind of put into a a place
[49:27] where we can simplify it for even the
[49:29] children to understand. All right. So, I
[49:32] want to begin by reading Psalm
[49:36] um 1 and verse
[49:39] 1-6. Uh you don't have to you can you
[49:42] read that on the screen over 50s.
[49:45] Okay. I'm still getting there right now.
[49:48] I'm denying my
[49:51] glasses.
[49:53] So, this is to me it's one of the most
[49:56] beautiful. I preached a whole message
[49:58] just on Psalm 11 1-6 and it was called
[50:00] the posture of a believer. I'm not going
[50:03] to do that because it says, "Blessed is
[50:05] the man that walketh not, standeth not,
[50:08] siteth not. The right posture is
[50:10] planted."
[50:12] Amen. So let's read verse one. Blessed
[50:16] is the man that walketh not in the
[50:18] counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in
[50:20] the way of sinners, nor siteth in the
[50:23] seat of the scornful. Each one you can
[50:26] take and understand. Walk walketh not in
[50:29] the counsel of the ungodly. To walk
[50:32] means to live in something like it's
[50:35] your philosophy, your way of life. Nor
[50:38] standeth in the way of sinners. That's
[50:40] not like blocking a sinner from doing
[50:42] his stuff. To stand in the way of
[50:44] sinners means to establish sinful ways,
[50:49] right? No siteth in a seat of the
[50:51] scornful. siteth in a seat means
[50:54] judgment as in those who scornful means
[50:58] to mock the truth, mock something,
[51:01] right? But his delight is in the Lord,
[51:04] the law of the Lord. That's the word.
[51:07] And in his law doth he meditate day and
[51:10] night. Look at that.
[51:13] So blessed is a man who does not do all
[51:15] those other things, but his delight is
[51:17] in the word. Amen. And in the word, he
[51:21] meditates day and night. That means he's
[51:23] always thinking about it. He's always in
[51:26] fellowship with it. Right? But this is
[51:29] where I want to get to. And he shall be
[51:31] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[51:34] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[51:37] his season. His leaves shall not wither,
[51:40] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
[51:43] The ungodly are not so, but are like the
[51:46] chaff which the wind driveth away.
[51:49] Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand
[51:52] in the judgment. What a stand. Not stand
[51:54] in the judgment means they will not
[51:56] endure. They'll not last. They're going
[52:00] to break up and fall away. I love
[52:02] Ephesians 6 where it says, "Having done
[52:04] all things, stand."
[52:07] It's amazing. Having done, put on the
[52:10] the helmet, the breastplate, take the
[52:12] sword of faith and all of that, but
[52:14] having done all things, stand, endure,
[52:18] stay to the end.
[52:21] For the Lord knoweth the way of the
[52:23] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[52:25] shall perish. So in this subject on the
[52:28] teaching on the seed, I want to point
[52:31] out to you that it says you shall be
[52:34] like a tree planted. Right? So what is a
[52:37] tree? A tree has its roots in the
[52:39] ground. It's got a stalk and trunk and
[52:44] branches and trees uh uh uh little uh
[52:48] branches coming out and leaves and and
[52:51] fruit. It you shall be like a tree
[52:55] planted by the rivers of water. That's
[52:56] our subject today uh this weekend,
[52:59] right? So for the Lord knoweth the way
[53:02] of righteousness, that's verse six. But
[53:04] the way of the ungodly shall perish. The
[53:06] Lord knoweth the way of righteousness
[53:08] that means that is the nature of God.
[53:11] Right? His way. What is righteous? What
[53:14] is righteous? Righteous means simply
[53:16] this. To do the right thing to be just.
[53:20] Okay. So here's the thing about our life
[53:24] in the
[53:25] message and trying to manage all our
[53:30] lives and our failures and our problems
[53:32] and our
[53:33] issues. People don't get
[53:39] planted. People don't realize you're a
[53:42] tree. You're a plant because there's a
[53:45] seed.
[53:47] Everything's about a seed. Everything's
[53:50] about a plant. It's about a nature. And
[53:52] that's what we want to discuss uh this
[53:54] weekend is about everything that
[53:57] concerns a plant. Are you with us? Let's
[54:01] go to Romans. I just want to get through
[54:03] the theory and then we'll start talking
[54:04] about it. Romans
[54:09] 8:28-31. And we know that all things
[54:12] work together. How many times have we
[54:14] heard this? For the good to them that
[54:17] love God, to them who are the called
[54:19] according to his purpose. I want to
[54:21] tweak that a little bit because I like
[54:23] those those that phrase all things work
[54:26] together. And that's why my subject is
[54:29] how it all works.
[54:33] All things work together for the good
[54:36] and everyone to them that love God, but
[54:40] to them that are called.
[54:42] Everyone claims to love God, but it's to
[54:44] them that are called. How are you
[54:46] called? By a seed.
[54:49] Amen. So for whom he did, and now he
[54:51] talks about fornowledge because he's
[54:53] telling you where that seed comes from.
[54:55] For whom he did forno, he also did
[54:57] predestinate. Such beautiful. He because
[55:00] he forneew something. He predestinated
[55:02] something. We're going to talk about
[55:03] that tomorrow, right? Uh what did he
[55:07] forno about you? And what did he
[55:09] predestinate about you? To be conformed
[55:12] to the image of his son that he might be
[55:14] the firstborn among many brethren.
[55:16] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[55:20] he also called. Whom he called, them he
[55:22] also justified. And whom he justified,
[55:24] them he also glorified. Are you seeing a
[55:26] process right? Whom he did predestinate
[55:29] them he also called. We thought he
[55:32] called then he
[55:36] predestinated. Which means something
[55:38] happens in your life. You're
[55:41] predestinated and then you feel a
[55:43] calling. There he also called and whom
[55:47] he called. So we got to know what that
[55:49] calling is. And then he also justified.
[55:52] We know what justified is.
[55:56] you never did it in the first place.
[55:59] You know what? That's a that's a battle
[56:03] because anyone can claim that in theory.
[56:06] Praise the Lord. I I did something
[56:08] wrong, but I never did it in the first
[56:09] place. And inside your head, of course,
[56:11] you did
[56:12] it. You did it. You're just trying to
[56:15] psych yourself out. Justification is a
[56:19] battle, saints. Sanctification is a
[56:22] battle.
[56:23] The baptism of the Holy Ghost, Brother
[56:25] Baron says, is the greatest battle. Says
[56:27] if you thought you were in the battle,
[56:28] just get the Holy Ghost. Every gun of
[56:30] the enemy is trained on you. They're all
[56:33] battles. In fact, if you go through the
[56:36] trumpets, you'll see there are like the
[56:38] fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpet before
[56:40] you take the
[56:43] millennium, right? Three wars. Three
[56:46] woes personally. Justification,
[56:49] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[56:51] Ghost are three woes before you get the
[56:53] person of Christ.
[56:56] Amen. The trumpets are not just stuff to
[56:59] read about about Israel. They're about
[57:00] your life. Very much
[57:03] so. And he says, "What shall we then say
[57:07] to these these things?" There's the
[57:08] consolation. If God be before us, who
[57:12] can be against us? Which means there
[57:14] must be a consolation in us that
[57:16] concerns the mystery of God. We have to,
[57:20] you know, this is the thing about
[57:21] church. Church is we feel it's like
[57:24] managing people's fears and failures and
[57:26] all their issues. But people need to
[57:29] have this consolation within them. If
[57:32] God be for us, who can be against us?
[57:35] You need to have that personal feeling
[57:38] because when you do, nothing can tear
[57:41] you away from him. Nobody can tell you
[57:44] otherwise. Nobody can condemn you. No
[57:47] false doctrine can condemn you. No issue
[57:49] in in life can condemn you because
[57:51] that's your consolation. If God be for
[57:54] us, who can be? This is this is amazing
[57:58] scripture. And this is what I tell you.
[58:00] I don't have uh supernatural gift but
[58:05] when I read the scripture I cannot tell
[58:07] you how it comes alive and it every
[58:11] phrase every word just opens up like
[58:13] volumes like I'm looking at an ocean and
[58:16] I don't know how to get all my thoughts
[58:17] together sometimes. Amen. Let's go to
[58:20] Isaiah 53. This is
[58:24] beautiful. Uh for he shall grow up. Now
[58:26] this is speaking about Christ the
[58:28] Messiah. He shall grow up before him as
[58:31] a tender plant and as a root out of dry
[58:34] ground. He has no form nor clumliness
[58:37] and when we shall see him there is no
[58:39] beauty that we should desire him. So
[58:42] this is actually telling us about Christ
[58:45] who is also a plant.
[58:48] Beautiful. You see why there's a seed he
[58:51] shall grow up. There's a development
[58:54] as a tender plant. A precious tender is
[58:57] precious. Amen. And as a root, I love
[59:01] this. A, this is where you
[59:04] people, message people need to really
[59:08] take a hold of a root out of dry ground.
[59:12] That means a plant that grew up under an
[59:15] impossible situation. A plant that
[59:18] should not have been a plant because a
[59:21] root in dry ground is an impossibility.
[59:24] It's a miracle.
[59:26] There's many of you sitting here today
[59:28] that's thinking it can't have been me.
[59:32] It couldn't have been me. How can it be
[59:35] me when this this ground is all messed
[59:38] up? It's
[59:40] impossible. This prophecy of the
[59:43] Messiah, we know it's impossible for a
[59:47] child to be born of a
[59:49] virgin. How could he he have sprung out
[59:52] of Judah?
[59:54] How could he have come under that
[59:55] situation? A root out of dry ground.
[1:00:00] And it's the enemy always telling
[1:00:04] you, you know, you you you you're not
[1:00:07] worthy. You didn't do it right. You came
[1:00:10] out of this doctrine. You came out of
[1:00:12] that church. You came out of this issue.
[1:00:13] There's always issues, you know, always
[1:00:16] failures, always thoughts. And it's like
[1:00:20] you have to go back to church. You have
[1:00:23] to pray five times a day. You have to
[1:00:26] read more of the
[1:00:28] message. People always want quick
[1:00:31] fixes. Pastor, pray for me. Lay your
[1:00:33] hands on me. I need You see, this this
[1:00:36] is what I have a problem with. And I was
[1:00:38] I was uh just mentioning that with
[1:00:40] brother Elry today. And I want to be
[1:00:42] able to say this. Like I said, let's
[1:00:44] tell the truth.
[1:00:46] We have had elders in the message and
[1:00:49] people for a very long time giving us
[1:00:55] uh testimonies. You know the Lord I
[1:00:57] prayed to the Lord. I was in a situation
[1:00:59] I prayed to the Lord and something
[1:01:00] miraculous happened. God did something
[1:01:03] great. And I grew up in the message half
[1:01:05] the time I don't know if those things
[1:01:06] were actually true or whether people
[1:01:09] claimed it, you know. But the problem is
[1:01:12] what it does to the next generation is
[1:01:14] they think to get a solution I need to
[1:01:18] have something like
[1:01:19] that. So when I'm in a problem, when I'm
[1:01:21] in a failure, I need to I need to pray
[1:01:24] to God. I need to have more prayer. I
[1:01:26] need to read more of the message books.
[1:01:28] And I know from experience of dealing in
[1:01:31] 25 years, it always ends in failure.
[1:01:35] There's no amount of prayer that's going
[1:01:37] to get it done because the Muslims pray
[1:01:40] five times a day. The Do you know how
[1:01:43] many denominational people outshine us
[1:01:47] with the amount of religiosity they
[1:01:50] have?
[1:01:52] What is then the
[1:01:54] problem? Th those people have to because
[1:01:58] there is no seed in there.
[1:02:01] They are using church to manage
[1:02:03] something.
[1:02:06] Amen.
[1:02:07] We are not as a root out of dry ground.
[1:02:10] He has no form no comeliness. You know
[1:02:13] what this no form no comeliness sounds
[1:02:16] like us, right? There's there's nothing
[1:02:18] about them that we should desire them or
[1:02:20] be attracted to them. In fact, anybody
[1:02:24] who knows them thinks, man, that group
[1:02:26] is just weird. They're just failures.
[1:02:28] That's just it sounds like it's speaking
[1:02:30] about us that when we shall see him
[1:02:33] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:02:34] him. They missed him in the first coming
[1:02:36] because they were looking for something
[1:02:39] attractive, something beautiful,
[1:02:41] something that made
[1:02:43] sense. Nothing about him made sense. A
[1:02:47] root out of dry ground. So it has become
[1:02:51] a problem now amongst Christians even in
[1:02:53] the message that people don't know what
[1:02:56] the purpose of things
[1:02:58] are. Do you know what the real purpose
[1:03:02] of church
[1:03:05] is? Why are we coming here
[1:03:08] then?
[1:03:09] Right. Most of the kids well my parents
[1:03:12] bring me here. You know I got no choice
[1:03:14] in
[1:03:15] this. Right. And someday I'll man I
[1:03:19] can't wait to get out of here, choose my
[1:03:21] own church, you know, my own convenient
[1:03:23] God and go somewhere where they allow me
[1:03:25] to do whatever I want or and I I I mean
[1:03:30] in the message be like we hop over from
[1:03:32] one place to another and go choose a
[1:03:34] convenient church that agrees with us in
[1:03:36] some way. So you know what are you
[1:03:39] doing? What is church really about? What
[1:03:42] is going on? What is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:43] really given for?
[1:03:45] Well, what is happening inside of me?
[1:03:48] Why am I struggling with my thoughts?
[1:03:50] How does it all
[1:03:52] work? That's what we want to get to. And
[1:03:55] that will bring us to the purpose. Amen.
[1:03:58] And how God set things out to work to
[1:04:02] perfect every son and daughter of God.
[1:04:05] Amen. So, people don't understand roles
[1:04:09] of certain things that are a part of
[1:04:11] God's plan. Like for example, most
[1:04:14] Christians I most message believers I
[1:04:16] know don't know whether they have the
[1:04:18] Holy
[1:04:19] Ghost. They don't. A lot of them claim
[1:04:22] it because they feel they have to.
[1:04:25] Because if they don't, then we will look
[1:04:27] down on them. And of course, if the
[1:04:29] people elected me for something, I have
[1:04:31] to I have to say I have it otherwise I'm
[1:04:33] in trouble. Right? Most people don't.
[1:04:37] It's the truth. Most people I said we're
[1:04:40] telling the truth, right?
[1:04:42] Most people don't know what to do with
[1:04:44] the message, with the word. In fact,
[1:04:46] most people are no longer reading the
[1:04:49] word with a purpose. It's like a
[1:04:53] tradition. Got to read 5:00 in the
[1:04:55] morning or have a certain devotion or
[1:04:57] something. But where's the
[1:05:00] purpose, right? Where am I heading to?
[1:05:04] What is chasing me? What do I have to
[1:05:06] build? What is there to do right here in
[1:05:08] Tanaki?
[1:05:11] What is my purpose? What is the purpose
[1:05:13] of the church here? Why am I here? What
[1:05:16] do I have to do here? Right? So the
[1:05:20] thing about it is they don't know people
[1:05:22] don't know how it all works. Therefore,
[1:05:24] many get discouraged so easily. That's
[1:05:28] the reason you get discouraged is
[1:05:29] because you don't know how it works. And
[1:05:31] many people faint. In the Bible, faint
[1:05:33] means they're running. They first
[1:05:36] started with a purpose. They had a
[1:05:38] bubble. they had an idea of where
[1:05:40] they're going and then they lose track.
[1:05:43] Okay. Uh right now in the message
[1:05:50] uh we our young people face two major
[1:05:54] things and you can skirt the issue as
[1:05:56] much as you want to. You can divert from
[1:06:01] it. You can wait till bad things happen
[1:06:04] or you can confront it. There's two
[1:06:07] major things they're facing right now in
[1:06:09] the world. One is the rejection of the
[1:06:10] prophet and the message on the internet
[1:06:14] in in the most the largest onslaught we
[1:06:17] have ever experienced.
[1:06:20] Number two is sexuality
[1:06:23] because of the
[1:06:25] weirdness of the message. people who
[1:06:28] expect people to get a revelation of
[1:06:31] their marriage partner without actually
[1:06:34] talking to
[1:06:37] people, without getting to know people.
[1:06:41] They want them to have successful
[1:06:43] marriages. They want them to and some of
[1:06:46] you are the culprits for keeping those
[1:06:47] laws and forcing it on them. And now
[1:06:51] you're
[1:06:52] learning, right? But this is the thing.
[1:06:55] When I go to youth camps, I ask um the
[1:06:58] young people, how many of you here heard
[1:07:00] about sexuality from your parents?
[1:07:03] Probably one person and usually not
[1:07:06] much. How many of you heard it from your
[1:07:07] friends?
[1:07:09] Everybody. Or from some other
[1:07:12] source. And and this and so I say to the
[1:07:15] elders, you see, they learned it from
[1:07:17] people without the Holy Ghost. They
[1:07:19] should it should have been you who are
[1:07:21] telling them everything there is to know
[1:07:23] about it. and to open it up so that they
[1:07:27] have the freedom to come and talk to
[1:07:29] you. But but if you people can't even
[1:07:30] say the word
[1:07:34] sex
[1:07:36] or use the words for
[1:07:39] uh everything that has to go to do with
[1:07:40] it, their private parts and all of that.
[1:07:43] If you can't say it and they don't have
[1:07:45] comfort to talk to you, they're going to
[1:07:46] talk to friends.
[1:07:48] I had one minister tell me, "No, no, no.
[1:07:51] I'm sorry. Brother Vanom did not talk to
[1:07:54] them together. He separated girls. He
[1:07:56] separated boys. Well, that's because in
[1:07:59] Brother Van's day, girls actually
[1:08:04] blushed. So, I asked this minister, I
[1:08:06] said, "Okay, when they're at school and
[1:08:08] learning sex education, do they separate
[1:08:10] them?" No. When they're at university on
[1:08:13] the phones, do they separate them and
[1:08:15] tell them, "Oh, you poor thing. You're a
[1:08:18] girl. You're a tender. Let's talk to you
[1:08:20] separately." No. They're learning it all
[1:08:23] together everywhere else. What's the
[1:08:25] problem with you?
[1:08:28] What's the problem with us, with the
[1:08:29] church? Why can we not talk to them
[1:08:32] together? Why do we not have the
[1:08:34] freedom? Why do we demonize something
[1:08:36] that the Bible speaks about as if it's
[1:08:39] normal?
[1:08:43] Do you know
[1:08:44] um I was sharing brother Steven last
[1:08:47] night. Uh this isn't in my notes. I
[1:08:50] don't know why I'm going this way,
[1:08:52] but Paul, the first apostle of the
[1:08:55] church ages in 1 Corinthians
[1:08:58] 7, he gives the solution for
[1:09:02] fornication. He says, "To avoid
[1:09:05] fornication, render unto one another due
[1:09:08] benevolence."
[1:09:11] For the adults, you know what that
[1:09:12] means, right? So that you don't get
[1:09:15] tempted. Yeah.
[1:09:18] Is that the solution for fornication?
[1:09:20] Get married and make sure you render
[1:09:22] unto each other due benevolence. He
[1:09:24] gives you a natural solution to avoid
[1:09:27] fornication. The first apostle, I mean,
[1:09:29] was that the best he could come up with?
[1:09:31] He didn't say, "Make sure someone shakes
[1:09:33] your head until you get the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:36] Make sure you you have so much
[1:09:38] spirituality that it removes the feeling
[1:09:40] from you." No, no, no. He said, "Make
[1:09:42] sure you have a very healthy sex life.
[1:09:47] so that you don't get tempted when it's
[1:09:49] time to do your work for God.
[1:09:52] Can you believe that? First apostle
[1:09:56] messenger to the church ages. And yet in
[1:09:59] the message, oh, it's too dirty. We
[1:10:02] can't talk about it. And these fellas
[1:10:05] are watching us, these youngsters,
[1:10:07] thinking we're all
[1:10:10] weird. And then we want them to become
[1:10:14] normal and have happy marriages and
[1:10:16] happy
[1:10:17] relationships. And we want them to
[1:10:19] become people who become the next
[1:10:21] elders. And when you can't talk about
[1:10:23] natural life, you what we're heading for
[1:10:27] is a group of young people that are
[1:10:28] going to mess their lives up and will
[1:10:31] not qualify to be pastors, deacons, and
[1:10:34] so on because we're not leading them in
[1:10:36] the right way. We're not showing them
[1:10:38] how to be normal. how that life can be
[1:10:42] lived with a proper baptism of the Holy
[1:10:45] Spirit and how we can just be normal
[1:10:47] people and happy
[1:10:49] together. Young people today don't
[1:10:52] understand and this is the tragedy.
[1:10:55] Young people don't understand what's so
[1:10:57] special about the message. Young people
[1:10:59] in message churches
[1:11:02] uh and the significance they don't know
[1:11:04] what church is about. it. They just like
[1:11:07] you go to go to school or something and
[1:11:09] they ask you uh what are you? Yeah, I'm
[1:11:11] a
[1:11:12] Christian. And they're scared to say I'm
[1:11:15] in the message. It's terrifying. They
[1:11:17] call you a cult or they mock you or
[1:11:20] something. But young people don't know.
[1:11:22] You know what I I even say to the young
[1:11:24] people? The the message is actually
[1:11:26] common
[1:11:27] sense. How many of you young people uh
[1:11:30] in public
[1:11:32] school? Yeah. Okay.
[1:11:35] Um, I I'm not going to ask them to tell
[1:11:38] me, but if they think about it, how many
[1:11:42] happy unbelievers do you
[1:11:48] know whose fathers don't swear, drink,
[1:11:51] smoke, beat up the kids? How many happy
[1:11:54] children do you know? How many families
[1:11:57] do you know that are not divorced? Or
[1:12:00] how many do you know? Just like barely
[1:12:02] any. I can do this in any school
[1:12:05] anywhere in the world. 50% of a primary
[1:12:08] school, they all have broken families
[1:12:11] in the world. The message is the only
[1:12:15] common sense on the planet that if you
[1:12:19] follow it, you will have a happy
[1:12:20] marriage, happy family, happy children.
[1:12:23] You will even live
[1:12:26] long because you won't smoke, drink,
[1:12:28] curse, swear, or do stupid things that's
[1:12:31] going to risk your life.
[1:12:33] It's even if you don't believe it, just
[1:12:36] follow it to live long and be
[1:12:38] happy. That's my
[1:12:41] point. It's always been that way. Go
[1:12:43] look in the gospel. The Hebrew children
[1:12:45] were more intelligent than the
[1:12:46] Babylonian Empire.
[1:12:48] It's literally the greatest common sense
[1:12:51] on the
[1:12:53] planet. And and beats me that young
[1:12:56] people look I'm I'm an educated person.
[1:12:59] I was I had a good education in South
[1:13:01] Africa. I'm not some brainwashed message
[1:13:04] zealot. I actually read the message and
[1:13:07] know what it is. I'm never brainwashed
[1:13:10] by my dad or my family. I'm not somebody
[1:13:12] who's been beaten on the head or
[1:13:14] something and made to use brother Bam is
[1:13:17] a prophet and Yahweh is God. Brother Bam
[1:13:19] is a prophet and Yahweh is God. Brother
[1:13:21] Bam. No, I never came up with that. I
[1:13:24] actually had an experience where I read
[1:13:25] the message and saw this is nothing else
[1:13:29] but the truth. the greatest value on
[1:13:32] earth. Amen.
[1:13:35] This this is the thing young people
[1:13:36] don't know. You are preserving your life
[1:13:40] if you follow after God's ways.
[1:13:43] You are guaranteeing yourself a happy
[1:13:45] family, a happy marriage. Life's going
[1:13:48] to be hard. You're going to have work to
[1:13:50] do. You're going to have to pay the
[1:13:51] bills. And all those friends of yours
[1:13:54] out there in the world, they always
[1:13:55] Friday comes, they're heading for the
[1:13:57] pub. They're heading for something. They
[1:13:59] need something to fill a gap in their
[1:14:01] soul. Oh yeah, but they're so rich. They
[1:14:03] go on holiday. They wear shorts. Yeah.
[1:14:06] And then they kill themselves with the
[1:14:08] stress and with all the stuff that's in
[1:14:11] their minds. They cannot keep one wife.
[1:14:14] They cannot keep one husband. They beat
[1:14:16] up their kids. You have the best
[1:14:19] opportunity to live the best life
[1:14:21] because you have the philosophy of of
[1:14:24] all philosophies in the message. Do you
[1:14:28] know why the Jews were taken captive by
[1:14:30] the Babylonians, the Meo Persians, the
[1:14:32] Greeks, the Romans? What was these small
[1:14:35] Jewish? What was so great about them?
[1:14:38] They had the only law on earth that kept
[1:14:42] tribes at
[1:14:44] peace. Nowhere else in the world, not in
[1:14:47] Africa, we know that for
[1:14:48] sure. Not in India, not not India had
[1:14:52] this great Hindu religion. They were
[1:14:55] still cutting each other's throats. Yes,
[1:14:57] China,
[1:14:58] every philosophy that the Babylonians
[1:15:02] and Grecian saw was this this law of
[1:15:04] Israel that kept 12 tribes in perfect
[1:15:07] harmony, had a single god, single
[1:15:10] religion, paid taxes, paid
[1:15:14] tithings, had children that were
[1:15:16] healthy, no veneerial diseases. Canaan
[1:15:19] was rot with veneerial diseases.
[1:15:24] I'm saying we literally have the
[1:15:26] greatest wisdom on earth in this
[1:15:29] message. Let's go to
[1:15:32] this pergame and churches. All right.
[1:15:35] So, everyone with us? I'm going to ask
[1:15:37] the children another question just now.
[1:15:39] So, stay
[1:15:41] awake. So, this
[1:15:44] is, you know, this is beautiful because
[1:15:46] you have
[1:15:48] uh unto the angel of the church of
[1:15:51] Ephesus, right?
[1:15:53] Unto the angel of the church of Smyrna,
[1:15:55] write unto the angel of the church of
[1:15:57] Pergamus, right? And on and on and on.
[1:16:00] But right here, we have a letter to the
[1:16:02] bride.
[1:16:06] Pick up your pen and write. This is what
[1:16:07] I'm trying to say to you. There was
[1:16:10] actually a change at the end here.
[1:16:13] There's a there's a letter to the bride.
[1:16:17] Amen. And look at this letter. Here is
[1:16:20] what I'm trying to say to you. Is it
[1:16:21] there on the screen? Here we go. Here is
[1:16:24] what I'm trying to say to you. The law
[1:16:25] of reproduction is that each species
[1:16:29] brings forth after its own kind, even
[1:16:31] according to Genesis
[1:16:34] 1:11. And God said, "Children, are you
[1:16:37] listening carefully? Don't yawn on me
[1:16:39] now.
[1:16:41] Let the earth bring forth grass and the
[1:16:43] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:16:46] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:16:50] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[1:16:53] so. All right, here it is. The part in
[1:16:56] yellow. Whatever life was in the seed
[1:16:59] came forth into a
[1:17:02] plant. You say, "Yeah, well, kids will
[1:17:04] be saying, "Yeah,
[1:17:06] duh." Huh? Seed grows into a plant. We
[1:17:09] know that. What are you missing? The
[1:17:12] seed of God in you has to become a
[1:17:15] plant,
[1:17:17] right? No. Duh. Now,
[1:17:22] right. And then into a fruit, which
[1:17:26] means it can't stay a hidden seed
[1:17:27] forever. It must be a plant and it must
[1:17:30] come out fruit, right? As if we didn't
[1:17:34] know. He then or we we were never going
[1:17:37] to know. He says next the very same law
[1:17:41] applies to the church today. What law?
[1:17:45] That a seed must bring forth a plant
[1:17:47] must bring forth fruit. Where are we?
[1:17:51] Whatever and this is this is phenomenal.
[1:17:53] Whatever seed started the church will
[1:17:56] come forth and be like the original seed
[1:17:59] because it is the same seed.
[1:18:02] This is the law of life and it never
[1:18:05] changes.
[1:18:07] Right? What I'm saying to you is if your
[1:18:10] your church begins with a particular
[1:18:12] seed, it's going to bring out the fruit
[1:18:14] of that seed. If your life had a a
[1:18:18] certain seed planted, it's going to come
[1:18:19] out with the fruit of that one. If
[1:18:22] you're a legalist, you're going to bring
[1:18:23] forth legalist fruit. If you're liberal,
[1:18:26] you're going to bring forth liberal
[1:18:28] fruit. Whatever seed is planted, it was
[1:18:31] going to produce a plant. It's the law
[1:18:33] of life. Something happens. It ignites.
[1:18:36] it comes to life, it's going to bring
[1:18:37] forth and it's going to bring something
[1:18:38] out in the end time. And you're going to
[1:18:40] stand there wondering what what just
[1:18:42] happened, right? So, whatever seed
[1:18:46] started the church will come forth and
[1:18:47] be like the original seed in these last
[1:18:50] days. I love this. The true bride
[1:18:54] church, Christ
[1:18:56] seed, will come to the headstone and she
[1:18:59] will be the super church, a super race
[1:19:02] as she nears him.
[1:19:06] Thank you, brother. I'm carried away. Uh
[1:19:11] and uh as she needs him with him, they
[1:19:13] will be
[1:19:15] one. Do you believe that?
[1:19:18] Amen. We will be one like Christ's seed.
[1:19:22] What is that? Like a root out of dry
[1:19:24] ground. Total mystery, an impossibility.
[1:19:30] Amen. He who is called, he's justified.
[1:19:33] and so on and they will be one. They
[1:19:36] will be the very manifestation. What is
[1:19:39] this telling us? This is telling us what
[1:19:41] the fruit is going to be. The
[1:19:42] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:19:45] God. Denominations cannot produce that
[1:19:48] this their wrong seed.
[1:19:52] They will produce creeds and dogmas and
[1:19:54] mixed with the word. This mongalizing
[1:19:56] brings forth a hybrid product. So young
[1:19:59] people if you ever end
[1:20:02] up okay look I
[1:20:05] know I don't know a lot of you I and in
[1:20:07] fact I don't know most of you I don't
[1:20:09] know what your life is or who your
[1:20:11] relatives are but this is happening
[1:20:13] everywhere there almost every family I
[1:20:15] know now
[1:20:17] uh has someone who has gone after
[1:20:20] believe the sign and fallen away or left
[1:20:23] the message or something like that. You
[1:20:26] know what's the amazing thing is I I
[1:20:30] I've talked to some of them and I talk
[1:20:32] to them with the attitude that I don't
[1:20:34] want to convince you because if someone
[1:20:38] is convinced they can just be convinced
[1:20:40] out again. Yeah. I'm not interested in
[1:20:42] convincing them but I'm I like playing
[1:20:44] with
[1:20:45] them because I like showing them how
[1:20:49] foolish they are. So I asked them so uh
[1:20:53] are you
[1:20:54] trinitarian? No. No, Trinity is wrong.
[1:20:57] Are you oneness? No, no, no. The oneness
[1:20:59] is so what are you? And they give me
[1:21:01] brother Brandham's answer. I'm like, uh,
[1:21:04] so you believe the the godhead like
[1:21:07] brother Brandham? Where did you get that
[1:21:08] from? You had your own epiphany. This is
[1:21:12] your own revelation. No, you got that
[1:21:15] from, brother Bam. Which means you
[1:21:17] actually believe inside of you. You're
[1:21:20] not you go sitting in some other
[1:21:21] denominational church, you just hate the
[1:21:24] prophet or you really hate the prophet
[1:21:26] because of feelings, because of how some
[1:21:28] people treated you. In the meantime, you
[1:21:30] actually know what the truth is. I asked
[1:21:33] them, "Oh, you know what? What happened
[1:21:35] in the Garden of Eden? Was it an apple?
[1:21:37] No, it was not an apple. U was it
[1:21:39] disobedience that threw us all into No,
[1:21:42] it was not disobedience. What was it
[1:21:43] then?" Um, it was, you know, like
[1:21:45] Nephilim, blah, blah, Enoch.
[1:21:49] Oh, so it's not something you just don't
[1:21:52] want to get it out. It's like stuck in
[1:21:54] your throat. You know, you know the
[1:21:56] reason Christ had to be born of a
[1:21:58] virgin. I say, "Oh, okay. How about um
[1:22:00] predestination? Are you Calvinist?" "No,
[1:22:03] no, Armenian." "No." "So, what are you
[1:22:06] like the middle of the road? Where did
[1:22:08] you get that from?" You know, like
[1:22:11] that's from the prophet. Which means
[1:22:13] even though you hate the message
[1:22:16] churches, Yeah. Yeah. We know all that.
[1:22:18] You hate the prophet. You This prophecy
[1:22:21] is wrong. That one is wrong. But you
[1:22:22] really believe the word the way we
[1:22:26] believe it.
[1:22:29] You hypocrite.
[1:22:32] You really know the truth. You're just
[1:22:35] going to some other kind of church cuz
[1:22:36] it's convenient.
[1:22:39] Right. That's the That's the real thing
[1:22:41] that's happening. They know the truth.
[1:22:44] That's right. They cannot deny and they
[1:22:46] they don't realize that's what we're
[1:22:49] attracted to.
[1:22:51] We're not interested in message
[1:22:53] terminologies or brother Brandham's
[1:22:56] miracles. I grew up under a third pole
[1:22:59] ministry. I I was not interested in in
[1:23:03] uh miracles and signs and wonders or
[1:23:06] anything. What grabbed me as a tender
[1:23:08] plant was the word. The only thing that
[1:23:11] was ever real and that's what I'm
[1:23:13] looking for. I want the truth of what
[1:23:14] happened in Genesis. When I read the
[1:23:16] book of Genesis and the days of
[1:23:18] creation, I'm celebrating. I want more.
[1:23:20] Oh, this is so exciting. And I get to
[1:23:23] chapter 2 and chapter 3 and I'm reading
[1:23:25] about serpent seed and the whole thing
[1:23:27] opens up like a like a story, like a
[1:23:29] picture. Like I'm seeing what's
[1:23:30] happening. This is so exciting. I'm not
[1:23:32] thinking, "Oh, praise the Lord for
[1:23:33] brother Bonham. Praise the Lord for
[1:23:34] brother B. Brandon this, Brandham that."
[1:23:37] The word is just opening. The truth is
[1:23:40] pouring out. and they stand there and
[1:23:43] and accuse us of being brandites. So I
[1:23:46] tell them, you know what, you're a
[1:23:48] branomite because you're the one who
[1:23:50] wakes up every morning with your coffee
[1:23:52] reading for something to attack William
[1:23:54] Brandham. I don't even do that. I don't
[1:23:58] I'm not interested in what his life was
[1:24:01] and what he did then, how this was then
[1:24:03] and whether he said this accurately.
[1:24:05] Then you're an obsessed person with
[1:24:07] William Brandham. I'm not. I am I am
[1:24:11] concerned with the word. I want more of
[1:24:14] the word. I want predestination to
[1:24:15] become more real. I want election to
[1:24:18] become more real. I want the the godhead
[1:24:20] to become more real. I want every aspect
[1:24:22] of the word to become more real. I'm not
[1:24:25] interested in message churches and and
[1:24:27] and and how they can uh uh prove to us
[1:24:30] that there's some kind of miracle church
[1:24:32] or something. There's plenty of that in
[1:24:33] the denominations. I am more interested
[1:24:36] in the word. Amen. And that's the truth
[1:24:38] of it. See this he says this
[1:24:41] mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[1:24:44] product they will have and produce their
[1:24:47] creeds and dogmas. So today is just the
[1:24:50] introduction right and we're going to
[1:24:52] get into everything else in the next few
[1:24:54] servers. The mystery of the kingdom was
[1:24:57] preached by Christ predominantly about
[1:25:01] seed. The kingdom of God is like unto a
[1:25:04] swer who went forth to sow seeds. and he
[1:25:07] swed seed here and he swed there on this
[1:25:09] ground and that ground. The kingdom of
[1:25:11] God is like unto a man who swed good
[1:25:13] seed in his field and while men slept
[1:25:15] the enemy came in and swed tears among
[1:25:18] the seed. The the the kingdom of God is
[1:25:21] like a man or like a a mustard seed
[1:25:24] which grow in into a big tree and the
[1:25:26] birds take root. Is that right? How many
[1:25:28] things Christ spoke about was about
[1:25:30] seed. The kingdom of God is like unto.
[1:25:33] The mysteries of the kingdom can always
[1:25:36] be spoken to by seed. So let's use
[1:25:40] that's what we're doing. Let's use the
[1:25:43] seed, the teaching on the seed to
[1:25:45] understand how it all works. All
[1:25:50] right. Okay, children. You ready for
[1:25:55] me? A seed needs four things to grow.
[1:26:01] Give me
[1:26:02] one. What does a seed need to grow?
[1:26:04] First one. Water. Yeah. Next.
[1:26:10] But you can't just drown it in water.
[1:26:14] What does it need? Sun. Sun. Good.
[1:26:17] Light. Anybody? Girls?
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:22] Soil. See? Otherwise, it's just swimming
[1:26:26] around in water, right? So, we got
[1:26:28] ground. We've got light. We've got
[1:26:32] water. What? One more very important
[1:26:35] thing. What is it?
[1:26:40] Sorry, brother. Food. Yeah. Well, it's
[1:26:43] going to get the food from the ground,
[1:26:45] right? One more
[1:26:47] thing. It needs something to breathe.
[1:26:49] Everybody needs something to breathe,
[1:26:52] right? Air. Four things. It needs
[1:26:56] ground. It needs air. It needs rain and
[1:27:00] it needs
[1:27:01] light. These are all the things that
[1:27:04] need to work for a seed to grow into a
[1:27:07] plant and produce fruit.
[1:27:10] Amen. This is
[1:27:12] important.
[1:27:14] So what is the seed? The seed is the
[1:27:17] carrier of the nature. That's the first
[1:27:19] thing we're going to understand
[1:27:20] tomorrow. It's the carrier of the
[1:27:22] nature. The seed has power in itself
[1:27:26] that you need to learn about. Amen. What
[1:27:30] is ground? It's not just ground. It's
[1:27:32] chosen ground.
[1:27:36] Do you appreciate that?
[1:27:39] Chosen ground. You're not going to
[1:27:41] You're not going to take a wheat seed
[1:27:43] and throw it on that volcano up there.
[1:27:46] As beautiful as it is.
[1:27:49] you you're going to want to choose the
[1:27:51] ground that you want to plant that seed
[1:27:53] in. And this seed is an eternal seed
[1:27:56] that's going to be planted by God.
[1:28:00] He doesn't make a mistakes with the
[1:28:02] ground.
[1:28:05] Amen.
[1:28:07] What is the light? The light is the
[1:28:10] power to transform. We're going to talk
[1:28:12] about that on Sunday morning. Light.
[1:28:15] What is light going to transform? is how
[1:28:17] does light even work in this plant? It's
[1:28:21] so beautiful when you look at the plant
[1:28:23] and then you're going to understand what
[1:28:24] light is to you and me. Why you need
[1:28:26] light? Why? That you cannot live in
[1:28:29] darkness with an eternal seed in your
[1:28:32] heart.
[1:28:35] What is darkness? What is light? And of
[1:28:38] course, there is rain.
[1:28:41] These were my best drawings I could do
[1:28:43] on the iPad, but we'll have some better
[1:28:46] diagrams
[1:28:47] tomorrow. There is rain. What is rain?
[1:28:50] Where do you where does your eternal
[1:28:51] seed get its water
[1:28:53] from? Right? That's what I'm saying. You
[1:28:56] have message people walking along,
[1:28:58] plotting along, singing songs, listening
[1:29:00] to sermons. How much of rain are you
[1:29:03] getting? Why do you feel dry
[1:29:05] sometime? Right?
[1:29:08] And of course, how it all works
[1:29:13] together. And and if you have the
[1:29:15] conditions all right, it's all working
[1:29:17] together. This plant is doing what it's
[1:29:20] supposed to do. This plant has a
[1:29:22] purpose. This plant takes root in the
[1:29:25] ground. This plant has a a meaning in
[1:29:29] itself and it's it's it's it's
[1:29:31] manifesting exactly the life that's
[1:29:33] inside the seed. Praise be to God. So,
[1:29:37] We're going to bring this together to
[1:29:40] you. All things work together. Light,
[1:29:44] air, rain, and ground. Why? Because some
[1:29:49] people think they can just have light.
[1:29:54] Light will burn you out.
[1:29:56] Without water, light's going to burn the
[1:29:58] whole plant out. Without air, you can
[1:30:01] have as much light as possible. You can
[1:30:04] have all most people, let me tell you,
[1:30:06] they want the rain. Rain down,
[1:30:11] brother. And there's something wrong
[1:30:13] with the ground. The seed gets washed
[1:30:15] away.
[1:30:17] Huh? See, it's just a simple thought.
[1:30:20] And I like New Zealand cuz lots of
[1:30:22] farming going on. We're speaking to the
[1:30:24] right people. Amen. You should be able
[1:30:27] to get this really good. So, the law of
[1:30:29] the seed, it's not just going to apply
[1:30:32] to a church. It's it if you understand
[1:30:35] how it all works, it's going to apply to
[1:30:37] you as an individual.
[1:30:40] It's going to apply to your family
[1:30:42] because at home you want to know how to
[1:30:44] raise children and those children are
[1:30:46] predestinated seed. What light do they
[1:30:49] have? What light are you providing as
[1:30:52] parents? Are you providing more rain
[1:30:54] than light? Are you providing more light
[1:30:57] than
[1:30:57] rain? How about air? Do they have air to
[1:31:00] breathe?
[1:31:03] See, so it's not just the individual,
[1:31:06] it's not just the family, it's also the
[1:31:08] church. Why do churches fail? Churches
[1:31:11] like to major on one of them. Churches
[1:31:15] uh like to believe they have this in
[1:31:18] them. They feel like pressurized to have
[1:31:20] that. And then we feel like, oh, you
[1:31:22] know, those people those people are too
[1:31:24] loud for us. Those people are too
[1:31:27] emotionless. Those people are So
[1:31:28] everybody kind of feels like they got
[1:31:30] something right. But to be the
[1:31:32] predestinated seed producing the
[1:31:34] manifested life, you need it all to work
[1:31:37] together for the good.
[1:31:40] Amen. This even happens with a country.
[1:31:45] A country can have the most fantastic
[1:31:48] constitution, most fantastic laws and
[1:31:52] and yet they're not bringing up the
[1:31:54] right people. The people are just going
[1:31:56] astray. People are losing the plot. They
[1:31:58] don't even become patriotic to the
[1:32:00] country. They're not fighting against
[1:32:01] each other. You have these two parties
[1:32:03] in every government p pitting the people
[1:32:06] against each other. It's everything. So
[1:32:09] what's happening? There's they don't
[1:32:11] have light or there's too much rain or
[1:32:14] the ground is just losing the plot.
[1:32:19] You, every one of you, you are a seed in
[1:32:23] this church.
[1:32:24] You are supposed to have a purpose, an
[1:32:27] individual unique purpose in every
[1:32:29] church that you are in. What is your
[1:32:32] plant? What is your place in there?
[1:32:36] There is finally the most important
[1:32:37] thing when we're done with it is in in
[1:32:39] an individual, every one of you,
[1:32:42] children, old
[1:32:44] person. Listen folks, it takes a visi a
[1:32:47] village to raise a child. Like like
[1:32:50] brother said in the beginning, don't
[1:32:52] pray for myself. pray for someone else.
[1:32:55] When you understand how it all works,
[1:32:57] you'll realize you're not even coming to
[1:32:59] church for yourself.
[1:33:04] So, what we're going to do over the
[1:33:06] weekend, have you
[1:33:08] identified what is your ground? If
[1:33:11] you're looking at yourself individually,
[1:33:13] do you even appreciate your ground? Do
[1:33:16] you hate your
[1:33:17] ground? A lot of people get to
[1:33:20] that. Amen.
[1:33:22] Do you see what how predestination
[1:33:25] works? Right? Have you identified what
[1:33:28] the air is? Have you identified what the
[1:33:30] rain is, what the light is, and how it
[1:33:33] should work according to the message?
[1:33:36] Anybody can choose ground, air, rain,
[1:33:39] light according to how Pentecost is.
[1:33:42] Pentecost is the safest cuz it's the
[1:33:43] nearest to where we came from. And yet
[1:33:46] it does not apply to the seed here of
[1:33:49] the seed of Christ. that doesn't
[1:33:52] mongrelize things, that does not bring
[1:33:54] forth a hybrid product. The seed here
[1:33:56] with the bride is a specific seed that
[1:33:59] is she will be like him as she nears
[1:34:02] him.
[1:34:04] It will be the very manifestation of the
[1:34:06] word of the living God.
[1:34:10] So saints in
[1:34:12] closing your m musicians can come up and
[1:34:14] we'll call brother Elry. People don't
[1:34:17] realize right now what is happening with
[1:34:19] them. Right? When you go to finding a
[1:34:24] church, finding a wife or a husband,
[1:34:27] finding a place to live, are you
[1:34:30] conscious that there is a seed that you
[1:34:33] are supposed to be watchful
[1:34:35] of? When a man chooses a wife, he's
[1:34:39] choosing a wife
[1:34:41] to help his purpose in life.
[1:34:45] Can you imagine a a farmer choosing a
[1:34:49] fashion model?
[1:34:52] How's that going to work?
[1:34:56] Honey, can you milk the cow
[1:34:58] today in my Louis
[1:35:03] Vuitton? Huh? That just that just
[1:35:06] doesn't work. You You can't go choosing
[1:35:08] a wife that's not going to support your
[1:35:11] life, your purpose. You have a purpose.
[1:35:14] So if you don't even know what the seed
[1:35:17] inside you is or the ground that you're
[1:35:20] supposed to have or the atmosphere
[1:35:21] you're supposed to live under, Amen.
[1:35:24] you're not going to appreciate. You're
[1:35:25] not going to have a successful life. We
[1:35:27] have to lead our children, our people to
[1:35:30] the truth. Amen. Finding a purpose, you
[1:35:34] know, it's like it's like
[1:35:37] animals. Animals seem to have an
[1:35:39] instinct. This is where I need to live.
[1:35:42] That's where food is. This is where I
[1:35:44] can bring up my children in peace. This
[1:35:46] is where I can protect them. Animals
[1:35:48] look for a habitat that that is
[1:35:50] conducive to their purpose. Amen. That's
[1:35:53] right. Right. And yet you got people
[1:35:56] going looking for churches and beliefs
[1:35:59] and philosophies that is not conducive
[1:36:02] to bringing up children in a wholesome
[1:36:04] way or to bring up healthy lifestyles or
[1:36:07] what is wrong with
[1:36:09] humans when animals know exactly what to
[1:36:13] do. Amen. And yet finding a purpose. You
[1:36:17] know what's going to happen when you
[1:36:19] take a hold of the life of the seed
[1:36:21] inside of you? You will never be
[1:36:23] satisfied until you are satisfied.
[1:36:27] You will keep moving. You will keep
[1:36:30] searching. You will keep working to get
[1:36:32] it right because you've got to get that
[1:36:34] life of that seed living the way it was
[1:36:37] predestinated to be. You are never going
[1:36:40] to be satisfied until you are satisfied.
[1:36:43] Amen. Amen. I love how Paul says it.
[1:36:46] This I love the scriptures. I am
[1:36:48] apprehended by that which I have
[1:36:50] apprehended. Amen. Amen. Praise be to
[1:36:54] God. And we're going to look this
[1:36:56] weekend at how things work together. The
[1:37:00] Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads for
[1:37:01] a little prayer before we
[1:37:03] sing. Heavenly Father, we're so
[1:37:05] thankful, Lord. You are wonderful to us.
[1:37:10] Lord, your word, your Holy Spirit, your
[1:37:13] love for us, it is beyond measure. It is
[1:37:16] beyond understanding. It is beyond
[1:37:17] anything we could have ever come up
[1:37:19] with. It is beyond all philosophies of
[1:37:22] man. It is beyond all laws that man have
[1:37:25] made up. It is even beyond the thoughts
[1:37:28] of humankind. Lord, it is just the
[1:37:31] treasure of the truth and the truth sets
[1:37:34] us free. Lord, I pray for this weekend
[1:37:38] that we are going to have fellowship
[1:37:40] around the things of the word. It's
[1:37:43] simple. It's the truth. It's what your
[1:37:45] prophet who is just a humble Kuckian
[1:37:48] preaching from his
[1:37:50] experience. Lord, but such great truths
[1:37:55] about life, about seed, about nature has
[1:37:58] come to us today and broken the very
[1:38:01] mystery of God to us and made it plain.
[1:38:05] Lord, we cannot thank you enough. We
[1:38:07] worship you from within our souls, from
[1:38:09] the deepest parts of us. We tell you we
[1:38:12] love you with all that is within us,
[1:38:14] with our heart and with our soul. We
[1:38:16] love your word. We love your Holy
[1:38:19] Spirit. We love the atmosphere. We love
[1:38:21] your people. We love the bride of
[1:38:23] Christ. We love the five-fold ministry.
[1:38:26] We love the good times. We love the bad
[1:38:28] times. We love and appreciate everything
[1:38:32] you have done for us. We're so excited
[1:38:34] to look at how all things work together
[1:38:37] for the good to them that are loved, to
[1:38:40] them that are called, and nothing can
[1:38:42] separate us from the love of God, which
[1:38:45] is in Christ Jesus. May you bless this
[1:38:47] church, Father. Bless these wonderful
[1:38:50] people, sincere hearts, sincere souls,
[1:38:53] tender children who are waiting for the
[1:38:56] opportunity for the Holy Spirit to fall
[1:38:58] upon them to make things real. uh older
[1:39:02] people who have walked through great
[1:39:05] experiences, difficult times, walked a
[1:39:08] road where it's been trials. They've
[1:39:11] pulled through. They've pulled through
[1:39:13] false doctrines. They pulled through
[1:39:14] family failures. They've pulled through
[1:39:17] difficult home lives, loss of jobs, loss
[1:39:20] of family members, loss of children.
[1:39:23] They've pulled through difficult
[1:39:24] marriages and difficult laws of
[1:39:27] countries. And they've some of them have
[1:39:29] crossed the seas Lord. Some of them have
[1:39:32] moved from towns to uh from cities but
[1:39:36] here they are Lord in a simple humble
[1:39:38] place. But your word your light has
[1:39:41] found us. Your word has called us. Your
[1:39:44] voice rings clear to us. There is
[1:39:47] nothing else in the world that brings us
[1:39:48] happiness but the truth of the word of
[1:39:51] God. And we know within our heart there
[1:39:54] is a there is a consolation that if God
[1:39:57] before us nothing can be against us.
[1:40:00] Bless us today we pray and for the rest
[1:40:03] of the weekend we ask it in your
[1:40:04] precious name with praise and

[1:41:25] tomb of
[1:41:27] sin. You were buried for three
[1:41:31] days, but then you walked right out
[1:41:35] again.
[1:41:37] And now
[1:41:38] death has no
[1:41:41] sting and life it has no
[1:41:45] end. For I have been
