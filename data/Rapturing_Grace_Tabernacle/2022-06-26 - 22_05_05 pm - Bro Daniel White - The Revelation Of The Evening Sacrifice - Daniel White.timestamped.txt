[1:09:28] starting from verse 13 tonight
[1:09:32] we know this story
[1:09:34] here very well
[1:09:37] esther chapter 4
[1:09:39] verse 13.
[1:09:43] then mordecai
[1:09:45] comma commanded to answer esther
[1:09:49] think not
[1:09:50] with thyself that thou shalt escape
[1:09:54] in the king's house
[1:09:57] more than all the jews
[1:10:01] for if thou altogether holdest
[1:10:04] thy peace at this time
[1:10:07] then shall their enlargement and
[1:10:10] deliverance arise
[1:10:12] to the jews
[1:10:13] from another place
[1:10:17] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[1:10:20] destroyed
[1:10:23] and who knoweth whether thou art come
[1:10:27] to the kingdom
[1:10:29] for such a time
[1:10:32] as this
[1:10:33] why don't you just take your seats no
[1:10:35] doubt you're a little bit weary just
[1:10:36] keep your bibles open we'll continue to
[1:10:39] read here
[1:10:40] mordecai here is a is a type of the holy
[1:10:44] ghost and
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:46] esther here has been encouraged or
[1:10:50] stimulated we could say by by the holy
[1:10:53] ghost there was a message
[1:10:55] that was sent to to esther here
[1:10:59] and prompting esther just to think about
[1:11:03] where she's at
[1:11:05] just to think about the time in which
[1:11:06] she is living in
[1:11:08] think about how she got to the place
[1:11:10] that she's got
[1:11:12] and perhaps
[1:11:14] perhaps think a little bit deeper than
[1:11:16] what she was thinking
[1:11:18] about what is my purpose in the position
[1:11:20] that god has placed me in
[1:11:23] so then esther in verse 15
[1:11:27] made them return
[1:11:30] mordecai
[1:11:32] this answer
[1:11:34] so we want to notice here that esther
[1:11:36] now
[1:11:37] was being was being inspired
[1:11:41] to give
[1:11:43] the holy ghost an answer
[1:11:48] esther was being inspired esther was
[1:11:51] queen right
[1:11:53] she wasn't to be positioned
[1:11:56] she already was in her
[1:11:58] right position
[1:12:00] but now there was something inspiring
[1:12:04] esther
[1:12:06] and this is what esther said
[1:12:09] go gather together all the jews that are
[1:12:11] present in shushan and fast ye for me
[1:12:16] and neither eat
[1:12:18] nor threa nor drink three days night or
[1:12:21] day
[1:12:22] i also and my maidens will fast likewise
[1:12:26] and so will i go in
[1:12:28] unto the king which is not according to
[1:12:32] the law
[1:12:33] and if i perish
[1:12:35] i perish
[1:12:37] something was inspiring esther
[1:12:41] something was causing esther to say what
[1:12:44] she was saying and to do
[1:12:47] what she was doing
[1:12:49] amen i believe that this end time bride
[1:12:52] is
[1:12:53] not self-inspired
[1:12:55] but she's holy ghost inspired
[1:12:58] she's inspired by the dove by the spirit
[1:13:02] of the dove
[1:13:03] is inspiring her
[1:13:05] because we understand that esther here
[1:13:08] is already married to the king
[1:13:10] amen and the the
[1:13:13] the thing that was inspiring esther was
[1:13:16] the spirit of her king
[1:13:19] it was the spirit of her husband that
[1:13:21] was inspiring her
[1:13:23] to think the way that she was thinking
[1:13:26] and to act the way she she was acting
[1:13:30] and i believe that this bride of christ
[1:13:33] also the spirit of god is inspiring her
[1:13:37] to think in a certain way and when we
[1:13:39] begin to think in a certain way we begin
[1:13:42] to act in a certain way if our thinking
[1:13:45] doesn't change our acting doesn't change
[1:13:48] but god's got to stimulate us god's got
[1:13:51] to cause us to to think in a different
[1:13:54] way in a deeper way perhaps than what
[1:13:57] we're thinking in relationship to our
[1:14:00] position with the king but she was not
[1:14:04] being inspired by another man's spirit
[1:14:07] she was being inspired by her husband's
[1:14:10] spirit amen that's what a wife is a wife
[1:14:13] is inspired by her husband's spirit
[1:14:16] right this bride of christ
[1:14:18] the queen of christ is inspired by her
[1:14:22] husband's spirit not another man's
[1:14:25] spirit
[1:14:26] amen if we're inspired by another man's
[1:14:28] spirit then we're going to fall
[1:14:30] amen but when we're inspired by the
[1:14:33] spirit of the holy ghost in our lives
[1:14:36] the spirit of our husband
[1:14:38] then we find that there's always a
[1:14:40] purpose behind it
[1:14:42] what is amazing about this in verse 17
[1:14:46] it says so mordecai went his way and did
[1:14:49] according to all that esther had
[1:14:52] commanded him
[1:14:54] brother branham said god wants you to
[1:14:56] speak the word and he will perform it
[1:15:00] amen esther spoke the word and now the
[1:15:03] holy ghost went forward to perform what
[1:15:06] esther had spoken
[1:15:09] now it came to pass chapter 5 verse 1 on
[1:15:13] the third day that esther put on her
[1:15:16] royal apparel and stood in the inner
[1:15:19] court of the king's house
[1:15:21] over against the king's house
[1:15:24] and the king sat upon his royal throne
[1:15:29] in the royal house
[1:15:31] over against the gate
[1:15:34] of the house
[1:15:36] so it
[1:15:37] so
[1:15:38] it was so
[1:15:40] when the king saw esther
[1:15:42] the queen
[1:15:43] standing in the court that she obtained
[1:15:47] favor in his sight
[1:15:49] and the king held out to escort esther
[1:15:53] the golden sepka
[1:15:54] that was in his hand so esther drew nigh
[1:15:58] and touched the top of the septa
[1:16:02] then said the king unto her what wilt
[1:16:05] thou
[1:16:06] queen esther
[1:16:08] and what is thy request
[1:16:11] it shall be
[1:16:13] even given thee to half
[1:16:16] of the kingdom
[1:16:18] amen
[1:16:20] man so we want to look at this in the
[1:16:22] light of the thought tonight the
[1:16:24] revelation of the evening sacrifice
[1:16:28] what you're going to find is the that
[1:16:30] the revelation of the hour
[1:16:33] meets the need for the hour
[1:16:36] the revelation of the hour
[1:16:39] will meet the need of the hour
[1:16:42] the revelation of another hour will not
[1:16:46] meet the need for this hour
[1:16:48] amen it must be the revelation of this
[1:16:52] hour
[1:16:53] that that that is the revelation of this
[1:16:56] hour will meet the need for this hour
[1:16:59] whatever need you have in your life the
[1:17:02] revelation of this hour will meet the
[1:17:05] need of this hour
[1:17:08] amen the revelation of the hour in 1st
[1:17:11] kings 18 the revelation of the evening
[1:17:14] sacrifice met the need of the hour the
[1:17:18] revelation of the evening sacrifice in
[1:17:21] john 1 as we looked at this morning he
[1:17:24] met that that revelation met the need
[1:17:27] for the hour
[1:17:28] amen and the revelation of this hour
[1:17:32] will meet the need of this hour the
[1:17:34] revelation of the evening sacrifice will
[1:17:38] meet the need of this hour esther said i
[1:17:41] will go unto the king i understand it's
[1:17:44] not according to the law but
[1:17:46] whether if i perish i perish
[1:17:49] amen the revelation of the hour
[1:17:52] will meet the need for the hour amen and
[1:17:57] there is a need in this hour
[1:18:00] amen and there's a there's always been a
[1:18:02] need in every hour but the particularly
[1:18:06] in this hour we want to receive from god
[1:18:10] the
[1:18:10] revelation for this hour so that it is
[1:18:14] able then to meet the need
[1:18:16] of this hour we could spend a lot of
[1:18:18] time and go through a a lot of examples
[1:18:22] here
[1:18:22] um
[1:18:24] just on that one thought
[1:18:26] but
[1:18:27] tonight we're looking at the the thought
[1:18:29] of the evening sacrifice for for this
[1:18:31] for this day
[1:18:33] because we understand that we're in a
[1:18:36] another gen another junction
[1:18:38] we are in a in a time where we are about
[1:18:42] to progress into the the wedding supper
[1:18:45] but it's going to require a revelation
[1:18:48] the thing that will get us there is a
[1:18:50] revelation but god holds revelation in
[1:18:54] his hand
[1:18:55] amen so when we realize the need for the
[1:18:58] hour and we call out to god lord we need
[1:19:01] a revelation that is going to that that
[1:19:04] is going to meet the need of the hour
[1:19:07] then it's like god
[1:19:09] lets go
[1:19:10] of that revelation and brings it down to
[1:19:13] us
[1:19:14] so that we can progress
[1:19:17] in our walk with the lord
[1:19:19] amen
[1:19:21] so
[1:19:23] this is what is going to change
[1:19:26] the course
[1:19:28] is revelation
[1:19:31] so as we saw this morning
[1:19:34] god is not going to
[1:19:36] or we can say god has not and he will
[1:19:39] not
[1:19:40] unequally yoke himself but god is
[1:19:44] joining himself with a part of himself
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:50] he's joining himself with a part of
[1:19:53] himself therefore
[1:19:55] the bride
[1:19:57] is a lamb because he was a lamb
[1:20:00] she will be a lamb also
[1:20:03] with the same nature
[1:20:05] the the the same temperament
[1:20:08] allowing the the spirit of god to
[1:20:11] descend
[1:20:12] upon her like it descended upon
[1:20:16] him amen now god is working through his
[1:20:21] bride
[1:20:23] he is now working
[1:20:26] through
[1:20:27] the you
[1:20:31] god fulfilled
[1:20:33] the ministry that was required and could
[1:20:36] only be fulfilled in the realm
[1:20:40] and now god has a has
[1:20:43] he didn't finish his earthly ministry
[1:20:45] but that
[1:20:46] portion of his earthly ministry that he
[1:20:49] did not finish he he can now finish that
[1:20:53] portion of his earthly ministry through
[1:20:56] the bride
[1:20:58] amen this is just it's just so beautiful
[1:21:01] it's god
[1:21:02] working
[1:21:03] through
[1:21:04] his bride
[1:21:06] the prophet of god says he says those in
[1:21:09] the bride do only his will
[1:21:13] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:21:16] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:21:19] keep still
[1:21:20] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:21:25] doing the works
[1:21:27] fulfilling his own word
[1:21:31] he did not complete all his work
[1:21:34] while in his earthly ministry
[1:21:37] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:21:42] she knows that
[1:21:45] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:21:49] certain things
[1:21:50] that he must do now
[1:21:54] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:21:56] bride
[1:21:58] that work which he left for this
[1:22:02] specific time
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:05] so what we see here is that the evening
[1:22:09] sacrifice
[1:22:11] of
[1:22:12] of um the evening sacrifice was a
[1:22:15] revelation to elijah
[1:22:18] because like john
[1:22:20] that the baptist brother branham was
[1:22:23] also a forerunner
[1:22:26] so the evening sacrifice
[1:22:29] to our elijah
[1:22:31] was a revelation
[1:22:34] because the revelation of the evening
[1:22:36] sacrifice must come through an elijah
[1:22:40] ministry
[1:22:42] first kings 18 elijah ministry john 1
[1:22:45] elijah ministry and now we have a we
[1:22:48] have had an elijah ministry on this
[1:22:51] earth that reveals the evening time
[1:22:55] sacrifice again
[1:22:57] because a lamb is a is an animal it's a
[1:23:00] it's a animal of sacrifice
[1:23:03] it's a sacrificial animal
[1:23:06] okay so it's the revelation of the
[1:23:09] evening sacrifice must come through
[1:23:12] an elijah
[1:23:14] ministry and this is what we're reading
[1:23:15] here we're reading about the revelation
[1:23:18] of the evening sacrifice
[1:23:20] we're reading about the revelation of
[1:23:22] how or who who god is going to work
[1:23:26] through in this time as john the baptist
[1:23:29] said this is he who baptizeth with fire
[1:23:32] it
[1:23:33] it was it was john the baptist
[1:23:36] the elijah ministry revealing the
[1:23:39] evening time sacrifice
[1:23:42] and now it is we have had an elijah
[1:23:45] ministry that also
[1:23:47] reveals the evening time sacrifice
[1:23:51] present your bodies as a living
[1:23:54] sacrifice
[1:23:56] amen a living sacrifice why because
[1:23:59] we're sheep
[1:24:01] we're lambs and god wants to use us amen
[1:24:05] he that tries in safe is his his life
[1:24:08] shall lose it but he that that is
[1:24:11] willing to lay down his life shall find
[1:24:13] it
[1:24:15] amen it's a it's a sacrificial walk
[1:24:18] that god wants
[1:24:20] for that god has
[1:24:22] for his bride
[1:24:28] amen when god took the woman
[1:24:32] out of adam
[1:24:35] the wood woman was adam expressed
[1:24:42] and so is the bride of christ
[1:24:46] she is him
[1:24:48] expressed
[1:24:51] she is not different to him
[1:24:56] she is him
[1:24:59] in the office of wife
[1:25:03] it is god expressed
[1:25:06] as a wife
[1:25:09] to her husband
[1:25:12] now
[1:25:13] when god looked at elijah's sacrifice
[1:25:16] that he he had
[1:25:18] that he had prepared in first kings 18
[1:25:22] god said the sacrifice is perfect
[1:25:26] amen it was a perfect sacrifice
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:32] when god looked at the sacrifice in john
[1:25:35] 1
[1:25:36] god said he is a perfect sacrifice
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:43] now god has another evening time
[1:25:45] sacrifice so what is his what is his
[1:25:47] verdict of this sacrifice
[1:25:51] it's got to be the same it's got to be
[1:25:54] perfect
[1:25:56] amen and he has deemed her perfect yes
[1:26:00] amen
[1:26:01] why because she has been washed by the
[1:26:04] blood of the lamb
[1:26:06] amen she has been washed by the blood of
[1:26:08] the lamb and now god looks at her
[1:26:11] through that blood and god sees her as
[1:26:14] the perfect sacrifice
[1:26:18] your weaknesses are meant to be there
[1:26:22] your your insecurities are meant to be
[1:26:25] there god looks at her and he says she
[1:26:29] is perfect
[1:26:31] now i can come down and abode on her now
[1:26:35] i i can come down and dwell with her
[1:26:38] this is my perfect queen
[1:26:41] a god don't marry anything but
[1:26:43] perfection but god just happened to
[1:26:46] marry perfection
[1:26:48] amen because she
[1:26:51] is a part of him
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:55] washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:26:57] so it's interesting now because now
[1:27:00] god is using another office
[1:27:06] god was using the groom
[1:27:10] for his earthly ministry
[1:27:12] and god accomplished through the groom
[1:27:15] what he sent to accomplish
[1:27:19] but now god is working through another
[1:27:21] office
[1:27:24] and that offers his wife
[1:27:28] that office is
[1:27:29] queen
[1:27:31] if the if the youth can remember
[1:27:34] god expresses himself
[1:27:37] through the office
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:41] god doesn't express himself
[1:27:45] through a wife as a husband
[1:27:49] i trust you can just grasp that thought
[1:27:51] quickly enough
[1:27:54] god doesn't express himself through a
[1:27:56] wife as a husband
[1:28:00] god doesn't express himself through a
[1:28:03] husband as a wife
[1:28:07] but god works through the office
[1:28:10] so if god is in the wife god will
[1:28:13] express himself as the wife
[1:28:17] if god is in the husband
[1:28:19] god will express himself as the husband
[1:28:24] god was in his son
[1:28:27] and god expressed himself
[1:28:30] as a son
[1:28:32] but now
[1:28:33] now god is god is in the wife
[1:28:37] let me say that again so make sure we
[1:28:39] can connect this together a little bit
[1:28:41] better god was in the groom
[1:28:45] god was in the husband
[1:28:48] jesus christ
[1:28:50] and god expressed himself as the husband
[1:28:55] through the office
[1:28:57] but now god is in the wife
[1:29:00] right
[1:29:01] so how is god going to express himself
[1:29:04] he's going to express himself through
[1:29:06] the office
[1:29:07] because if god were to express himself
[1:29:10] through the wife as a husband that would
[1:29:12] be a perversion
[1:29:14] i mean the world is perverted
[1:29:17] i meant the wife is the husband and the
[1:29:20] husband is the
[1:29:22] wife the kids are the parents
[1:29:28] the parents are the kids
[1:29:32] it's the truth i'm not saying in every
[1:29:34] case
[1:29:35] but my kids work in child care i hear
[1:29:37] the stories
[1:29:39] i see it in the shopping centres
[1:29:42] it's the kids that control the parents
[1:29:44] not the parents who control the kids
[1:29:46] it's a
[1:29:50] perversion but god is not
[1:29:54] one who allows himself to be perverted
[1:29:59] god doesn't stoop that low
[1:30:03] he can't stoop that low
[1:30:05] because god can't fail
[1:30:09] amen he can't fail it's not possible for
[1:30:12] him to fail
[1:30:14] so god is expressed
[1:30:18] in in this day
[1:30:21] through the sacrifice through the
[1:30:23] revelation of the sacrifice which is
[1:30:26] wife
[1:30:28] it's god expressing himself
[1:30:31] as wife
[1:30:33] you'll notice when esther
[1:30:36] went into the king
[1:30:39] she put on her
[1:30:43] royal apparel
[1:30:46] she didn't put on his
[1:30:50] she put on her
[1:30:53] royal apparel
[1:30:56] all right why because god was working
[1:30:59] through esther
[1:31:01] amen and putting it into our time into
[1:31:04] where we're living now god was working
[1:31:07] through esther
[1:31:09] and god was going to express himself in
[1:31:12] the office that esther held
[1:31:16] and that office was queen
[1:31:20] so esther didn't
[1:31:22] esther didn't try and make her own way
[1:31:28] esther didn't try and make her own uh
[1:31:30] you know well i i don't need the king
[1:31:33] i'll i'll just go i'll just go the way
[1:31:35] that that i i'll just follow my heart
[1:31:38] i'll just do what the world does i'll do
[1:31:40] what the majority
[1:31:42] does no because that would be a
[1:31:45] perversion
[1:31:48] right because
[1:31:49] because christ
[1:31:51] in esther
[1:31:55] was going to express himself as queen
[1:32:02] and the queen comes subject to the king
[1:32:07] there's that headship again
[1:32:09] headship is nothing to fear headship is
[1:32:12] something you should cherish
[1:32:15] headship is protection
[1:32:17] okay it's something that you need to
[1:32:19] come to terms with it's actually
[1:32:21] something that you need to fall in love
[1:32:23] with
[1:32:24] is his headshield
[1:32:27] so god was expressing
[1:32:30] himself the
[1:32:31] through esther as esther
[1:32:36] it wasn't god expressing himself through
[1:32:40] esther
[1:32:41] and then like vashti
[1:32:44] well i don't need the king
[1:32:47] that grieved the king
[1:32:49] and it caused the king to put vashti
[1:32:52] away
[1:32:53] because she didn't understand headship
[1:32:56] she didn't understand that the value of
[1:32:58] it oh she did understand later but it
[1:33:00] was too late then
[1:33:02] amen but this bride won't fall
[1:33:05] this bride is not vashti
[1:33:07] this bride is esther
[1:33:09] this bride knows her position
[1:33:12] this bride knows who she is
[1:33:14] this bride is a revelation unto herself
[1:33:18] just the same as esther was a revelation
[1:33:20] unto herself vashti was not a revelation
[1:33:23] unto herself
[1:33:25] because if she was a revelation unto
[1:33:28] herself she would have done what the
[1:33:30] king asked her to do but because she
[1:33:33] thought well you know i'm i'm just as
[1:33:36] powerful as he is i'll do what i want to
[1:33:38] do he's having his meetings i'll have my
[1:33:41] own meanings
[1:33:45] but that's not this queen
[1:33:49] this queen is expressed as esther
[1:33:53] esther you you are you are the one
[1:33:56] that's casting the shadow of esther
[1:34:00] we're actually looking at your shadow
[1:34:04] because in order for there to be a
[1:34:06] shadow there must be someone someone
[1:34:08] that casts it
[1:34:10] so when we look at esther we're looking
[1:34:12] at your shadow
[1:34:14] amen because you are the reality of
[1:34:17] esther you are the reality of the shadow
[1:34:21] you are the one who is causing the
[1:34:23] shadow amen and because you are the one
[1:34:27] who's causing the shadow really we we
[1:34:30] our lives we should be able to fill in
[1:34:33] the blanks of the story of esther
[1:34:35] because the reality is much more clearer
[1:34:38] than a shadow there's more details in
[1:34:41] the reality than what there is the
[1:34:43] shadow
[1:34:44] amen so your life should be able to fill
[1:34:47] in the blanks of the shadow or the story
[1:34:51] of esther
[1:34:54] esther put on her royal apparel
[1:35:02] esther came
[1:35:04] to her headship
[1:35:07] esther was inspired
[1:35:11] esther was being led
[1:35:15] esther was being called
[1:35:17] esther was being challenged
[1:35:20] god had a purpose for all of this
[1:35:28] it's god expressing himself
[1:35:32] through his wife
[1:35:34] yes
[1:35:34] it was the spirit of esther's king that
[1:35:37] was causing esther to do what she was
[1:35:39] doing
[1:35:42] because the king was on the throne
[1:35:45] you know what the king was doing
[1:35:48] he was waiting for esther
[1:35:54] he was waiting for esther to push
[1:35:56] through the sound barrier
[1:36:01] oh esther what are you doing here no
[1:36:05] he was waiting for esther
[1:36:07] he was expecting her at any time perhaps
[1:36:12] he was dealing with business
[1:36:14] and and not knowing when exactly it was
[1:36:16] going to be but she knew that he knew at
[1:36:19] some particular time those curtains were
[1:36:22] going to come in and someone was going
[1:36:24] to come come in uninvited
[1:36:29] but really she was invited it was just a
[1:36:32] secret invitation that not everyone
[1:36:35] heard there was a deep calling and the
[1:36:37] deep was calling esther into himself
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:42] yeah it's it's just so just so wonderful
[1:36:45] but the point here is that it was it was
[1:36:48] the spirit of her king
[1:36:51] in esther
[1:36:53] acting out the part of esther
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] let's read this again
[1:37:01] those in the bride do only his will
[1:37:06] that's a challenge
[1:37:10] but the prophet here is
[1:37:13] ministering this
[1:37:15] through the revelation
[1:37:18] of esther today
[1:37:23] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:37:26] have thus said the lord they stand still
[1:37:29] they know
[1:37:30] that it has to be
[1:37:32] god in them doing the works fulfilling
[1:37:37] his own word
[1:37:40] now let's just look at that they know it
[1:37:42] doesn't say i know that it has to be god
[1:37:45] in them
[1:37:46] it says they know
[1:37:50] they know
[1:37:52] they are a revelation unto themselves
[1:37:56] they know
[1:37:58] it's not me doing the works but it's god
[1:38:01] in me doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:38:06] word
[1:38:06] amen we'll come back to that but let's
[1:38:08] just go forward here jesus said
[1:38:11] believe us thou
[1:38:13] not that i am the father and the father
[1:38:15] in me the words that i speak i speak not
[1:38:19] of myself but the father dwelleth in me
[1:38:22] he doeth the works
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:28] he doeth the works
[1:38:30] the son
[1:38:32] the groom
[1:38:34] had a revelation
[1:38:36] that it was his father in him that was
[1:38:39] doing the works
[1:38:41] well let's go back because the
[1:38:43] revelation now is that it's god in the
[1:38:47] bride doing the works
[1:38:49] they know
[1:38:51] as jesus knew they know
[1:38:54] as as the husband knew the wife knows
[1:38:58] that it's god in them doing the works
[1:39:02] it's a continuation or we could say it's
[1:39:05] an unfolding of the revelation of jesus
[1:39:08] christ because she is him it's the
[1:39:11] marriage of the lamb not the marriage of
[1:39:14] the lambs
[1:39:16] the revelation that he had of himself
[1:39:19] now she has of herself
[1:39:27] yeah it came through an elijah ministry
[1:39:31] yeah it did
[1:39:34] it has to according to god's word
[1:39:40] but now
[1:39:42] the many-membered body of christ
[1:39:45] they know
[1:39:48] once
[1:39:50] he knew
[1:39:53] i'm talking about the elijah once elijah
[1:39:55] knew
[1:39:58] the same as when elijah in first kings
[1:40:01] 18 put that put that sacrifice together
[1:40:03] once
[1:40:04] he knew
[1:40:06] before the fire even fell
[1:40:08] he knew
[1:40:10] that this was god's evening time
[1:40:12] sacrifice this was god's mind expressed
[1:40:16] this was the manifestation of god's mind
[1:40:19] once he knew and once elijah knew and no
[1:40:23] one else knew elijah held this mystery
[1:40:26] but but now it's time for us to be known
[1:40:31] as elijah knew
[1:40:34] us and this is how this is written
[1:40:41] they know
[1:40:43] that it has to be
[1:40:47] it has to be why because i understand my
[1:40:51] inability
[1:40:53] i understand my weaknesses
[1:40:56] amen i understand that i can achieve
[1:40:59] nothing
[1:41:00] i stand up here as a vessel that can
[1:41:02] achieve nothing
[1:41:05] it has to be god
[1:41:10] it's not this is not a question anymore
[1:41:13] it has to be god
[1:41:15] why because i can do nothing of myself
[1:41:22] i've come to terms with my weakness
[1:41:26] amen i'm not talking about sin
[1:41:29] okay i've come to terms with my weakness
[1:41:32] i've come to terms with my inabilities
[1:41:36] and therefore i know
[1:41:40] the things that happen around me
[1:41:43] are not me doing them
[1:41:45] it's god
[1:41:47] doing the works it has to be god in them
[1:41:51] doing the works and fulfilling his own
[1:41:55] word
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:57] so
[1:41:58] it's it's very interesting
[1:42:02] here that jesus had this same revelation
[1:42:07] because it was god expressed through the
[1:42:12] song god fulfilling his own word through
[1:42:17] his son
[1:42:19] it was god
[1:42:20] in christ
[1:42:21] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:42:26] amen god in christ
[1:42:29] doing the works
[1:42:30] it's not me that doeth the works but
[1:42:33] it's my father that doeth the works
[1:42:37] amen jesus was a revelation to himself
[1:42:43] he was
[1:42:44] absolutely he was and we sometimes we
[1:42:47] struggle in our mind to think well
[1:42:49] why would jesus have to be a revelation
[1:42:51] to himself but he was a revelation to
[1:42:53] himself
[1:42:54] the groom was a revelation to himself
[1:42:57] the wife needs to be a revelation unto
[1:43:01] herself
[1:43:02] gone are the days when we are relying
[1:43:04] upon
[1:43:05] elijah holding the revelation
[1:43:07] now we are living in the time now where
[1:43:10] we are the revelation the thing that
[1:43:13] elijah said that we are that we are
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:18] nothing more
[1:43:20] and nothing less
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:31] i've run ahead of myself a little bit
[1:43:34] in john 1
[1:43:39] god was masked
[1:43:41] behind the ram
[1:43:50] god was masked
[1:43:53] behind
[1:43:54] let's say it this way
[1:43:57] the ram of god
[1:44:01] ram is a lamb this is the male lamb
[1:44:06] and god fulfilled in him
[1:44:10] the ministry
[1:44:12] of the realm
[1:44:16] but now god has changed
[1:44:20] his mask
[1:44:24] and he has now
[1:44:26] masked
[1:44:28] behind the you of god
[1:44:37] now he's masked
[1:44:39] behind the female lamb
[1:44:44] now his mass once he was masked behind
[1:44:49] the ram
[1:44:52] once he was masked behind the husband
[1:44:57] but now he's taken on a mask and that
[1:45:00] mask is the mask of a wife
[1:45:06] his wife
[1:45:07] yes
[1:45:09] not just our wife
[1:45:11] his wife
[1:45:16] the person behind the mask
[1:45:20] controls
[1:45:22] what the mask
[1:45:23] does
[1:45:26] i thought about making a mask
[1:45:31] it's not the mask
[1:45:33] expressing itself
[1:45:37] but it's the person
[1:45:39] behind the mask
[1:45:42] expressing himself
[1:45:45] as the character of the mask
[1:45:52] amen
[1:45:54] it's not the mask expressing himself
[1:45:58] itself
[1:46:00] but it's the person behind the mask
[1:46:04] and the person behind the mask
[1:46:07] expresses himself or acts out the role
[1:46:12] that the mask is
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:17] he was masked behind the ram
[1:46:22] and when god was hidden behind
[1:46:25] the the mask of the ram
[1:46:29] he acted out the role of the ram
[1:46:33] god acted out the role of the ram
[1:46:39] the the mask could not express itself
[1:46:42] the mask could do nothing of itself you
[1:46:47] can lay the mask down on the uh if you
[1:46:50] had a mask you could lay it on the floor
[1:46:52] and say stand up it wouldn't do nothing
[1:46:53] it couldn't do nothing of itself it's a
[1:46:56] lot like a sheep
[1:46:58] it can't do nothing of itself if it
[1:47:01] needs to do anything it needs to be put
[1:47:04] in the hands of the cat of the person
[1:47:07] whose mask it is
[1:47:10] and the son of god the realm of god was
[1:47:13] god's mask for that period of time but
[1:47:17] we're not living in that period of time
[1:47:21] even though we rejoice about the things
[1:47:24] that god achieved through that mask
[1:47:28] because we he could not dwell behind the
[1:47:31] mask of his wife until he had fulfilled
[1:47:34] the things that were necessary
[1:47:37] in the role of the ram so this is why we
[1:47:40] rejoice this is why we have communion
[1:47:43] this is why we have foot washing this is
[1:47:45] why we sing about the blood this is why
[1:47:48] we sing about calvary this is why we
[1:47:50] sing about redemption it's all it
[1:47:53] because without that we couldn't have
[1:47:55] this but because he has fulfilled all
[1:47:59] the ministry that he was meant to finish
[1:48:02] he's laid down the mask of the ram and
[1:48:05] he's picked up another mask and this
[1:48:08] mask just happens to be the mask of his
[1:48:11] wife and now he has veiled behind his
[1:48:15] wife
[1:48:16] and now he is fulfilling his own word he
[1:48:20] is fulfilling he is acting out the role
[1:48:24] of a wife
[1:48:29] amen we are the mask and we are sheep
[1:48:33] amen and we can do nothing of ourself
[1:48:37] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:48:41] it's christ in you veiled behind the
[1:48:44] veil failed behind the wife mask
[1:48:49] god acting his role
[1:48:52] god acting as a wife
[1:48:58] because he's changed his mask
[1:49:01] i just love that
[1:49:03] i just i just
[1:49:05] i just love that so much god
[1:49:07] laid down the mask of his son
[1:49:12] and he stepped into another mask
[1:49:15] god's always masked
[1:49:18] amen and that mask
[1:49:21] in his idea was when he laid down the
[1:49:24] mask
[1:49:25] of his son that there was another mask
[1:49:27] that he was about to step behind
[1:49:30] it's the same god
[1:49:32] that was veiled behind the groom
[1:49:35] is the same god that is now veiled
[1:49:37] behind the mask of his wife
[1:49:42] the same same god not a different god
[1:49:46] but now it's god acting out the role
[1:49:50] of his wife i'm just going all over the
[1:49:53] place tonight but this is why
[1:49:56] those in the bride do only his will
[1:50:01] you can't do this
[1:50:03] i'm sorry but you can't do this
[1:50:06] it's not possible for you to only do his
[1:50:10] will
[1:50:11] amen but when you surrender
[1:50:14] when you become as a sheep
[1:50:17] when you surrender yourself to god it's
[1:50:20] no longer you trying to fulfill or
[1:50:23] trying to do his will
[1:50:25] now when you completely surrender god
[1:50:28] now it's him behind you fulfilling his
[1:50:31] own word and that's why the bride do
[1:50:35] only his will is because it's not the
[1:50:37] bride acting out her part but it is god
[1:50:41] behind the bride acting out her part
[1:50:49] it's magnificent
[1:50:52] the prophet of god says in trying to do
[1:50:54] god a service without it being his will
[1:50:56] he says i was going to speak this
[1:50:58] morning on satan's eden many of you's
[1:51:00] got the tape of it satan's eden he has
[1:51:03] made another garden of eden six thousand
[1:51:06] years has taken him to make it just like
[1:51:08] god did
[1:51:09] his at the beginning
[1:51:11] god made his eden and satan corrupted it
[1:51:15] now satan's made his own eden and god's
[1:51:18] going to destroy it that's right
[1:51:21] and put his own
[1:51:23] something said to me he's talking about
[1:51:26] the picture of the cloud turn it right i
[1:51:29] thought i think i'm looking at it right
[1:51:32] said turn it right see
[1:51:34] i thought maybe the voice means turn it
[1:51:37] to the right and when i did you see what
[1:51:41] it is hoffman's head of christ at 33
[1:51:44] here look in here
[1:51:46] see this black beard his face his eyes
[1:51:49] his nose everything else see the part of
[1:51:52] his hair here coming down
[1:51:54] and he's wigged with the white angel wig
[1:51:57] to show that the message of him
[1:52:00] being god is the truth
[1:52:04] he is the supreme judge of the universe
[1:52:07] supreme judge of heaven and earth he is
[1:52:11] god and nothing else but god he is god
[1:52:16] expressed in human form called the son
[1:52:19] of god which the son was the mask
[1:52:26] god behind a mask
[1:52:29] the eternal judge
[1:52:31] the the the supreme judge of heaven and
[1:52:35] of earth was veiled behind the mask of
[1:52:40] his son
[1:52:42] and that son is our groom so we can we
[1:52:46] we can say amen we can say that the god
[1:52:50] was veiled behind my groom
[1:52:53] amen just the same as what esther could
[1:52:55] say ested by the revelation of who her
[1:52:57] king was to say god that's that's god
[1:53:01] veiled in flesh
[1:53:03] amen the son
[1:53:05] was
[1:53:06] the mask
[1:53:08] god was masked
[1:53:10] as
[1:53:11] a son
[1:53:13] with that mask on that's the part he
[1:53:17] played
[1:53:26] but that is not the mask today
[1:53:31] his mask today
[1:53:34] is wife
[1:53:42] the point that i'm majoring on here
[1:53:45] is whatever
[1:53:48] mask god chooses to mask himself behind
[1:53:53] that is also the part that he plays
[1:53:57] behind the mask
[1:54:02] if you don't go home with anything else
[1:54:05] go home with that
[1:54:06] yes whatever mask god decides to mask
[1:54:11] himself behind
[1:54:13] that's the role he plays
[1:54:20] it's not us fulfilling his word
[1:54:25] it's god in us
[1:54:27] fulfilling his own word
[1:54:31] if
[1:54:32] let me go back
[1:54:34] this is a with with without revelation
[1:54:37] we'll we'll be condemned here
[1:54:43] those in the bride only do his will oh
[1:54:51] but what we want is the revelation
[1:54:55] of jesus christ for this hour
[1:54:58] because the revelation of jesus christ
[1:55:00] for this hour meets the need for this
[1:55:03] hour
[1:55:06] amen so the revelation of jesus christ a
[1:55:09] part of the revelation
[1:55:11] of jesus christ is to identify the mask
[1:55:18] because if you can't identify the mask
[1:55:21] then how do you know what party's
[1:55:22] planned
[1:55:25] if you went to a play and you didn't
[1:55:27] know who the characters were
[1:55:29] and there were all these people on the
[1:55:31] stage playing their part but you didn't
[1:55:32] know who the character was what's the
[1:55:34] point of going to the play
[1:55:36] so you've got to know who the character
[1:55:38] is
[1:55:40] so that you understand the purpose
[1:55:42] behind the character you've got to
[1:55:43] understand the mask
[1:55:45] and then you'll understand what the
[1:55:47] purpose of the person behind the mask is
[1:55:51] going to fulfill
[1:55:54] those in the bride do only his will the
[1:55:58] reason is is is is because it's not the
[1:56:01] bride doing his will
[1:56:06] it's god in the bride
[1:56:09] doing his own will
[1:56:12] it's god in the bride fulfilling his own
[1:56:15] word
[1:56:17] it's not the bride fulfilling
[1:56:20] the word
[1:56:21] it's the groom it's the it's god in the
[1:56:24] bride fulfilling his own word
[1:56:28] it was god in moses
[1:56:30] it was god in david it was god in noah
[1:56:34] it was god in sarah it was god in
[1:56:37] abraham it was god in jesus it was god
[1:56:40] in you
[1:56:42] fulfilling his own purpose
[1:56:48] no wonder she can rest
[1:56:51] no wonder the bride can rest no wonder
[1:56:53] the mask can rest because it's not her
[1:56:56] fulfilling fulfilling anything she just
[1:56:59] needs to rest and allow god to do his
[1:57:01] part
[1:57:02] and i i believe well in in my own life
[1:57:05] this is where i believe my experience
[1:57:07] with the lord is coming to a greater
[1:57:10] level where i can just relax
[1:57:13] i can just rest
[1:57:15] like i can just surrender myself to him
[1:57:18] and say lord however you want to use me
[1:57:20] tonight you just use me tonight is
[1:57:24] for your glory
[1:57:26] it's not up to me to come out here and
[1:57:28] put on a show
[1:57:31] no
[1:57:33] i'm the mask
[1:57:38] i need someone
[1:57:40] behind me
[1:57:43] i need someone in me
[1:57:46] so that this mask
[1:57:49] can fulfill what it's meant to fulfill
[1:57:53] so that it can fulfill its purpose
[1:57:55] as the mask
[1:57:57] as the mask
[1:57:58] the mask has a purpose as a mask
[1:58:04] god
[1:58:05] is is expressing himself
[1:58:08] as a wife
[1:58:20] we might jump around a bit here and
[1:58:22] there but that's okay yeah
[1:58:24] amen
[1:58:26] now in my home i'm three different
[1:58:28] people
[1:58:29] in my home
[1:58:31] my wife has claims on me as husband
[1:58:34] my daughter out there she doesn't have
[1:58:37] any claims on me as husband
[1:58:39] i am her father
[1:58:42] and my little grandson there i'm
[1:58:44] grandfather to him
[1:58:46] so he has no right to call me father
[1:58:50] i'm not his father
[1:58:52] my son
[1:58:54] is his father
[1:58:56] i am his grandfather but i'm still the
[1:58:59] same
[1:59:00] man
[1:59:04] this kind of gets interesting
[1:59:06] because there's probably people here
[1:59:09] who are the
[1:59:10] gentlemen here who are
[1:59:12] their sons and their fathers and their
[1:59:14] grandfathers
[1:59:18] so now we can bring this right down to
[1:59:20] another level
[1:59:22] because as a husband to my wife god is
[1:59:25] expressing himself as a husband to
[1:59:27] through through this vessel also
[1:59:31] the same as what god is expressing
[1:59:33] himself
[1:59:34] through my wife to me
[1:59:39] you understand
[1:59:41] when when i see my wife
[1:59:44] giving me the respect that the bible
[1:59:47] says that she ought to give me it's
[1:59:50] christ in her
[1:59:53] when my wife experiences
[1:59:56] the love that god said that that i ought
[1:59:59] to love her with
[2:00:01] it's what she's experiencing is the love
[2:00:05] of christ in me
[2:00:07] because it's christ in me
[2:00:10] expressing himself
[2:00:12] through this office
[2:00:14] i just hold the office
[2:00:17] it's the same with a daughter if a a a
[2:00:20] daughter
[2:00:22] when a daughter shows her parents
[2:00:25] the respect
[2:00:27] that god says she ought to
[2:00:30] what they're experiencing is christ in
[2:00:33] her
[2:00:35] without christ in her there won't be
[2:00:38] that respect
[2:00:41] but when christ is in her
[2:00:44] christ will express himself
[2:00:47] through my daughter
[2:00:50] he she will respect
[2:00:52] my wife she will respect me it's and
[2:00:56] what am i experiencing i'm experiencing
[2:01:00] christ
[2:01:02] christ is expressing himself through
[2:01:06] that office
[2:01:10] it's it's just so glorious it's just so
[2:01:13] so wonderful
[2:01:17] it's it's life-changing
[2:01:21] and
[2:01:22] god does what he does he just changes
[2:01:25] himself
[2:01:28] to
[2:01:29] to become to that generation to make
[2:01:33] known himself to that people
[2:01:36] and that's what we're finding out
[2:01:38] tonight
[2:01:40] in what way is god supposed to make
[2:01:43] himself known
[2:01:45] to
[2:01:46] this people
[2:01:47] and in this time
[2:01:51] he changes his mask
[2:01:55] he changes his act
[2:01:59] he doesn't change his disposition
[2:02:03] he doesn't change his nature
[2:02:07] he just changes his mask
[2:02:11] from one
[2:02:13] to another
[2:02:15] he does it
[2:02:17] to reveal himself
[2:02:24] he does it
[2:02:26] to reveal
[2:02:28] himself
[2:02:31] god wants to be known
[2:02:34] god wants you to see him
[2:02:37] and the way that god is is known or the
[2:02:41] way that god has decided to express
[2:02:45] himself is through
[2:02:47] humanity
[2:02:53] he does it
[2:02:55] to reveal himself
[2:02:57] more plain
[2:02:58] to the people
[2:03:01] that they might know
[2:03:03] who he is and what he is
[2:03:08] when the prophet of god stood on the
[2:03:09] platform and you understand that the
[2:03:12] story behind the story that when
[2:03:14] melchizedek came to abraham he discerned
[2:03:18] the thoughts and intents of sarah's
[2:03:20] heart when sarah was in the tent behind
[2:03:22] him
[2:03:23] so when the prophet of god turns his
[2:03:25] back to the congregation and he says
[2:03:27] there's someone on the fourth right back
[2:03:29] and da da da da da got this problem and
[2:03:31] this problem and this problem
[2:03:33] what's what's god doing
[2:03:36] who was that
[2:03:38] because we can take that story
[2:03:41] back to the bible and say that was
[2:03:44] melchizedek
[2:03:46] amen
[2:03:47] so now
[2:03:49] when uh when when when a son
[2:03:53] shows respect to the father lord i don't
[2:03:57] i don't do my will i do your will
[2:04:01] when a son shows respect to the father
[2:04:05] here on earth
[2:04:08] we can take that back to the word
[2:04:11] and say i know who that is
[2:04:15] i know who that is that's christ
[2:04:18] in that son
[2:04:21] when a husband
[2:04:23] loves his wife
[2:04:25] as christ loved the church
[2:04:29] we can take that experience
[2:04:32] we can take what we are looking at as me
[2:04:35] as an onlooker i can take what i am
[2:04:37] seeing a man loving his cr loving his
[2:04:40] wife as christ loved the church and i
[2:04:43] can look at that and i can take that
[2:04:45] back to the bible and i can prove who
[2:04:48] that is by the word it's the same christ
[2:04:52] who laid down his life for his wife
[2:04:55] 2000 year ago is now here doing things
[2:04:58] for his wife that she could not do for
[2:05:01] herself
[2:05:04] you see it's not just all about what the
[2:05:06] prophet did it's christ in you it was
[2:05:09] christ in the prophet but now it's
[2:05:12] christ in you
[2:05:14] amen and why is it christ in you because
[2:05:17] he wants to reveal himself not just in a
[2:05:20] prophet but he wants to reveal himself
[2:05:23] in you in your office
[2:05:26] fulfilling the role that you have
[2:05:29] fulfilling your office
[2:05:32] god fulfilling your office
[2:05:36] god as husband
[2:05:40] we could probably go a little bit
[2:05:41] overboard here
[2:05:43] but let me do it okay
[2:05:49] god
[2:05:50] is my wife's husband
[2:05:55] when i become fully
[2:05:57] surrendered fully dedicated
[2:06:01] christ in me
[2:06:03] becomes my wife's husband
[2:06:10] if we can see this we will see many
[2:06:13] things
[2:06:15] there's a principle here if we can grasp
[2:06:17] this principle we can apply it to every
[2:06:20] office
[2:06:22] son daughter
[2:06:24] husband wife
[2:06:26] grandfather grandmother
[2:06:29] dad mother
[2:06:31] etc etc
[2:06:34] there's a principle behind here that god
[2:06:36] wants us to catch and that is that god
[2:06:38] wants to reveal himself in your office
[2:06:43] amen and the way that he can the only
[2:06:46] way
[2:06:46] that he can do that
[2:06:48] is if we understand who we are
[2:06:53] if we understand we are the mask
[2:06:59] and we are the mask that god has chosen
[2:07:02] to avail himself behind and express
[2:07:05] himself through in this mask
[2:07:15] amen
[2:07:21] i don't even know how far i got there to
[2:07:23] reveal
[2:07:24] more plane to the people
[2:07:26] that they might know who he is
[2:07:30] and what he is
[2:07:34] his whole purpose is to be known
[2:07:38] and he could have done this in many
[2:07:39] different ways
[2:07:41] but he chose
[2:07:43] to work through humanity
[2:07:46] he chose to redeem humanity through
[2:07:49] humanity
[2:07:58] once upon a time god was masked behind a
[2:08:01] mask
[2:08:03] but in this day
[2:08:05] god is masked
[2:08:07] behind masks
[2:08:13] god is masked
[2:08:15] behind masks
[2:08:20] god is playing many parts
[2:08:23] of his play
[2:08:25] at the same time
[2:08:29] one time he was marks behind one mask
[2:08:33] now he has a many membered body
[2:08:36] in whom he is masked behind
[2:08:39] and he is playing every part
[2:08:43] in his play
[2:08:46] amen
[2:08:47] it's not our play it's his play
[2:08:51] amen is god mast behind you it's god
[2:08:55] mass behind the mum
[2:08:57] it's god masked behind the dad
[2:09:00] it's god mass behind the sun
[2:09:03] it's god mass behind the daughter it's
[2:09:05] god masked it's god masked it's god must
[2:09:11] it's not us
[2:09:13] playing the part
[2:09:16] it's him playing the part
[2:09:19] amen
[2:09:20] because
[2:09:21] let's face it we we can't play our part
[2:09:27] we can't play the part of the mask
[2:09:31] the character of the mask we are just
[2:09:33] the mask
[2:09:36] it takes the owner of the mask
[2:09:41] to come on the scene
[2:09:45] the masks
[2:09:46] that he purchased
[2:09:48] is the masks that he's going to play
[2:09:51] behind
[2:09:53] he purchased his bride
[2:09:58] and he's going to play
[2:10:00] behind every member
[2:10:02] of his body
[2:10:06] god
[2:10:07] must
[2:10:08] god mask behind the musicians
[2:10:12] god mass behind the song leader
[2:10:15] god
[2:10:16] mass behind ministry
[2:10:19] amen
[2:10:21] a ministry is an office
[2:10:23] it doesn't matter which one of the
[2:10:24] five-fold ministries it is it's an
[2:10:26] office
[2:10:29] but it's it's the the person that god
[2:10:31] has placed that gift within he's the
[2:10:34] mask
[2:10:35] it's god who comes in and operates the
[2:10:37] gift
[2:10:38] that he's placed within the mask amen so
[2:10:43] it's got veiled behind ministries
[2:10:47] it's got veiled
[2:10:48] behind deacons
[2:10:52] etc etc etc
[2:10:56] the weakness
[2:10:58] is in the mask
[2:11:01] which is humanity
[2:11:04] the mask is humanity
[2:11:08] and what we need to do is accept
[2:11:12] our weaknesses
[2:11:15] instead of trying to remove them
[2:11:24] because god made me the way he's made me
[2:11:32] and it's like really cosmetics
[2:11:37] god made us the way he made us
[2:11:42] but today people don't like the way that
[2:11:44] they're made
[2:11:46] so they apply cosmetics
[2:11:51] to change
[2:11:52] the way that god made them
[2:11:56] i guess we have pink lips i don't know
[2:12:00] just as an example but people aren't
[2:12:02] happy with that
[2:12:05] people want red lips
[2:12:07] green lips blue lips yellow lips
[2:12:11] they're not happy
[2:12:14] they're not happy with the natural color
[2:12:15] of their fingernails they want different
[2:12:17] colors
[2:12:22] and sometimes we're the same
[2:12:25] in our spiritual walk we try and change
[2:12:28] ourselves
[2:12:30] thinking that would be more usable
[2:12:33] thinking that we'd be more attractive
[2:12:35] perhaps we're to get invited overseas to
[2:12:38] preach in other people's churches more
[2:12:40] often if if i could just remove this
[2:12:42] weakness or just remove i'm not talking
[2:12:44] about sin please understand me okay i'm
[2:12:47] just talking about the way that god made
[2:12:49] us god made us as the weaker vessel
[2:12:52] god made us as sheep god god tells us
[2:12:55] that we're sheep we just need to accept
[2:12:57] that we're sheep
[2:12:59] the very thing that we're trying to
[2:13:00] remove we need to accept that this is
[2:13:03] how god made me and god made me
[2:13:06] different to you but god made me the way
[2:13:08] he's made me and through the way that
[2:13:10] he's made me he's going to receive glory
[2:13:18] so the thing that we try and remove
[2:13:22] we really need to accept
[2:13:26] paul prayed three times
[2:13:30] for the thorn
[2:13:31] in the flesh to be removed
[2:13:34] but god said no
[2:13:38] at least paul had the understanding to
[2:13:40] ask god to remove it
[2:13:45] sometimes we take it upon ourself we
[2:13:47] don't even ask god
[2:13:51] we go and we get on youtube and we
[2:13:53] we look at all these
[2:13:55] motivational videos and you come away
[2:13:58] from those motivational videos feeling
[2:14:01] like you could rip a dozen lines to
[2:14:03] pieces
[2:14:04] and then half an hour later you're back
[2:14:06] right where you started
[2:14:09] trying to make yourself something that
[2:14:11] you're not god made you weak for a
[2:14:14] reason
[2:14:16] god made you
[2:14:18] with the inabilities for a reason
[2:14:21] god made moses with that speech
[2:14:23] impediment for a reason
[2:14:27] god made david as the smallest of his
[2:14:29] family the weakest of his family for a
[2:14:32] reason
[2:14:35] but instead we try and pump ourselves up
[2:14:37] you know we go to the spiritual gym and
[2:14:39] you know pumping pumping messages you
[2:14:41] know i'm just trying to make myself big
[2:14:44] you know i i ought to be bigger than
[2:14:46] what i am yeah
[2:14:47] let god do for you what he wants to do
[2:14:50] for you
[2:14:51] god made you that way
[2:14:54] god made you
[2:14:56] weak yes
[2:15:02] what the world calls strong god calls
[2:15:04] weak
[2:15:07] what the world calls weak god calls
[2:15:09] strong
[2:15:12] god can use a strong man
[2:15:15] because in god's economy a strong man is
[2:15:18] a weak man
[2:15:23] david was weak
[2:15:26] but david was god's chosen
[2:15:31] naturally saw
[2:15:34] samuel
[2:15:35] uh sorry jesse offered his biggest son
[2:15:37] first
[2:15:39] surely this is the one that god's gonna
[2:15:41] use look at the size of him
[2:15:44] no no no no is there another one
[2:15:48] oh yeah but you know
[2:15:51] we didn't even consider him in there in
[2:15:53] the in in god's economy well god did
[2:15:58] god did
[2:15:59] go and get him and bring him here and
[2:16:01] the lord says this is him
[2:16:03] this is the one that the weakest of the
[2:16:06] bunch
[2:16:07] the weakest of who was available god
[2:16:10] chose to use
[2:16:13] the weaker that we can get the more god
[2:16:16] can use us
[2:16:17] the more we recognize that we are just a
[2:16:20] sheep
[2:16:21] we're not aligned with just a sheep a
[2:16:24] sheep can't find its way home a sheep
[2:16:26] can't lead herself she can't defend
[2:16:27] herself a sheep is the most insecure
[2:16:31] human that there is on earth
[2:16:34] a sheep is dependent
[2:16:38] upon god
[2:16:41] brother branham said god
[2:16:43] never
[2:16:45] god never
[2:16:47] ordained man to shift for himself
[2:16:51] but he made man to be totally reliant
[2:16:55] upon god
[2:17:00] the thing that we run from
[2:17:02] the thing that we try and
[2:17:04] remove
[2:17:06] the thing that we say well god can't use
[2:17:08] me because of this or god could use me
[2:17:11] better if i didn't have
[2:17:13] if i wasn't this week is the very thing
[2:17:16] that we need to accept
[2:17:18] like god told paul paul my grace is
[2:17:22] sufficient for thee
[2:17:24] amen my grace is sufficient for thee and
[2:17:27] his grace is sufficient for you
[2:17:33] it's god's desire
[2:17:36] we don't need to worry
[2:17:39] we don't need to say well if only i
[2:17:40] could get rid of this insecurity
[2:17:44] who said you had to
[2:17:49] you can become secure through your union
[2:17:54] this is why you know brother and tells
[2:17:56] us how we can grieve the holy ghost and
[2:17:58] the holy ghost will flutter off onto a
[2:17:59] branch
[2:18:01] you don't lose your seal but you can
[2:18:03] backslide
[2:18:04] you know the the moment the moment the
[2:18:06] holy ghost
[2:18:08] flooded off we'll we'll try and fend for
[2:18:11] ourself
[2:18:12] we'll try and shift for ourselves and
[2:18:14] all we do is become worse and worse and
[2:18:16] worse and worse until we realize hey
[2:18:18] what what what am i doing
[2:18:21] what what am i doing trying to find my
[2:18:23] way home what am i doing trying to try
[2:18:26] trying to act out the role of the mask
[2:18:29] i'm the mask
[2:18:34] we need to understand ourselves
[2:18:38] we need to understand how god designed
[2:18:41] us this is why the revelation of jesus
[2:18:44] christ
[2:18:45] to me
[2:18:46] it's it's a lot of the time
[2:18:48] it's distorted because the revelation of
[2:18:51] jesus christ is both in weakness and in
[2:18:54] strength it's the lamb and the dove it's
[2:18:57] a two-fold revelation of god
[2:19:01] the husband and the wife
[2:19:03] the wife is the weaker vessel the
[2:19:05] husband is her protection
[2:19:08] we understand who we are we understand
[2:19:11] our weaknesses we understand that we are
[2:19:14] the weaker vessel in this relationship
[2:19:17] god was masked behind his son
[2:19:20] but now through an elijah ministry god
[2:19:23] has been revealed
[2:19:24] behind
[2:19:26] the minute behind his bride
[2:19:30] mast behind his bride
[2:19:33] god is now acting out the role of wife
[2:19:38] i love that
[2:19:40] god is now acting out the role of wife
[2:19:46] behind the mask of his wife
[2:19:50] god in you
[2:19:52] redeeming humanity through you
[2:19:59] god in you
[2:20:01] redeeming
[2:20:02] humanity
[2:20:04] through you
[2:20:08] i can give you that on a quote
[2:20:12] mary the mother of jesus in the city of
[2:20:14] nazareth as this is as we close tonight
[2:20:17] the meanest city there was in the land
[2:20:20] but out of there god chose a little lady
[2:20:23] to give birth to his son an incubator a
[2:20:26] womb that he had to had a baby had to be
[2:20:30] born by
[2:20:31] he took
[2:20:32] such
[2:20:34] a person
[2:20:35] to do it
[2:20:37] god works
[2:20:38] through
[2:20:39] human beings
[2:20:41] to redeem
[2:20:43] human beings
[2:20:50] what what what did god have to take
[2:20:52] moses out on the back side of the desert
[2:20:54] for
[2:20:56] so that he could realize he was human
[2:21:00] why because god chose before the
[2:21:02] foundation of the world to redeem human
[2:21:04] beings through human beings
[2:21:07] it's not human beings redeeming human
[2:21:09] beings
[2:21:11] it's god working through human beings
[2:21:15] redeeming human beings
[2:21:17] the human being is the mask
[2:21:22] he can take you
[2:21:25] work through you
[2:21:28] to redeem humanity
[2:21:33] if you completely dedicate everything
[2:21:36] you
[2:21:37] are
[2:21:42] if
[2:21:43] you'll completely dedicate everything
[2:21:47] you are
[2:21:49] are you a revelation to yourself
[2:21:54] because you can only dedicate to him
[2:21:57] what you know yourself to be
[2:22:01] amen
[2:22:04] and when you are a revelation unto
[2:22:07] yourself
[2:22:09] then you can dedicate everything you are
[2:22:14] your your weaknesses
[2:22:16] well let me ask you what are you
[2:22:21] you are the mask
[2:22:25] that god has chosen
[2:22:28] to redeem
[2:22:29] humanity through
[2:22:32] you do you realize tonight
[2:22:35] god is here
[2:22:39] redeeming humanity
[2:22:42] through
[2:22:42] humanity
[2:22:46] this is why especially sorry ministry
[2:22:48] for the ministers it is very important
[2:22:51] that they understand
[2:22:53] who they are
[2:22:56] so that it allows god
[2:22:58] to work through them because they can
[2:23:01] dedicate
[2:23:02] who the
[2:23:03] everything they are when they know who
[2:23:05] they are and i am just the mask
[2:23:11] i am the mask
[2:23:13] in which god hath chosen to work through
[2:23:18] you are the mask
[2:23:20] that god has chosen to work through
[2:23:25] it's not up to the mask
[2:23:28] to redeem
[2:23:30] to redeem humanity
[2:23:33] but it's up to god to redeem humanity
[2:23:37] it's up to god
[2:23:39] in humanity
[2:23:41] to redeem humanity
[2:23:44] because when he redeems humanity it's
[2:23:47] like the field with the treasure when he
[2:23:49] bought the field he got the treasure
[2:23:52] when he bought your when he bought you
[2:23:55] he got the treasure
[2:23:57] because within you there was a
[2:23:59] predestinated seed
[2:24:01] so he paid the price for you
[2:24:05] and in paying the price for you he got
[2:24:08] the treasure so he's redeeming humanity
[2:24:12] to redeem back unto himself the part of
[2:24:15] you that is a part of him
[2:24:22] this is this is god's choice
[2:24:26] god god works through human beings
[2:24:29] to redeem human beings
[2:24:32] god worked
[2:24:33] through his son
[2:24:35] to redeem
[2:24:37] human beings
[2:24:39] god worked through his son god god it
[2:24:42] was it was god behind the sun
[2:24:45] who who caused
[2:24:47] the sun to lay himself down on the cross
[2:24:52] amen it was god behind the sun that
[2:24:55] caused the sun to lay himself down
[2:24:58] on the cross
[2:25:01] it's god in you
[2:25:03] that causes you
[2:25:05] to deny yourself
[2:25:08] take up your cross and follow him
[2:25:11] it's christ in you that causes you to do
[2:25:14] that
[2:25:18] amen if you completely dedicate
[2:25:20] everything that you are if you're a
[2:25:23] young woman dedicate your morals
[2:25:26] you're a young man dedicate your morals
[2:25:30] dedicate your mind dedicate your
[2:25:33] thinking dedicate your heart dedicate
[2:25:36] your soul dedicate all
[2:25:39] you are
[2:25:40] and let christ work through that
[2:25:44] what a glorious thing
[2:25:47] got some rivers to cross got some
[2:25:49] bridges to go over got the got the briar
[2:25:53] patches got the thickets got you got the
[2:25:56] woods you got the dark places you got
[2:25:58] the high hills you got the high climbs
[2:26:01] what are you doing someday you'll have
[2:26:03] to stand and look back
[2:26:06] see where you came from and you're going
[2:26:09] to be judged by the course you take
[2:26:12] put your all your mind and your thoughts
[2:26:15] on that north star the center of god and
[2:26:19] don't move from it
[2:26:21] stay right with it it will bring you
[2:26:24] straight like
[2:26:26] like
[2:26:27] it did the magi
[2:26:28] right straight to christ
[2:26:35] god
[2:26:37] is masked in this building
[2:26:44] we're not looking for a god that is
[2:26:46] masked
[2:26:48] he's here
[2:26:51] he is a revelation to us
[2:26:55] amen he is what causes the mask to do
[2:26:59] what it does
[2:27:02] the actions of the mask
[2:27:06] if christ
[2:27:07] is in the mask
[2:27:09] are the actions of christ
[2:27:12] if christ is not in the mask then the
[2:27:16] actions of the mask
[2:27:18] are the actions of the mask
[2:27:24] but if christ is in you
[2:27:29] then the actions of the mask are the
[2:27:31] actions of christ
[2:27:35] this is why christ today is identifiable
[2:27:40] by his actions
[2:27:42] behind the mask
[2:27:48] we know
[2:27:49] that it's god doing the works
[2:27:53] because the works that are being done
[2:27:57] are out of our reach
[2:28:01] we know
[2:28:03] it's not us
[2:28:05] because we know
[2:28:06] we can't do it
[2:28:16] we know it's him
[2:28:20] because we know that we can't do
[2:28:24] what he is ordained to do
[2:28:27] despite our best efforts
[2:28:30] sarah put her own interpretation to
[2:28:33] god's promise
[2:28:35] but it didn't work out the way she
[2:28:37] thought it would
[2:28:39] because her interpretation was different
[2:28:41] to god's
[2:28:43] to god's word
[2:28:47] so we want to allow god
[2:28:51] to use us
[2:28:55] as masks
[2:28:58] as masks
[2:29:00] lord use me
[2:29:02] in a way that would bring glory unto
[2:29:04] yourself
[2:29:15] i hope you just don't see
[2:29:17] christ behind your pastor
[2:29:20] i hope you see him behind your pastor
[2:29:23] but i hope you just don't see
[2:29:25] christ behind your pastor
[2:29:28] because then you're in no better place
[2:29:30] than people who just see christ behind
[2:29:32] william brown
[2:29:38] but christ was it wasn't his idea to be
[2:29:41] masked behind one person
[2:29:44] it was
[2:29:45] his idea to be masked behind his many
[2:29:48] membered body his many-membered bride
[2:29:52] amen his wife
[2:29:56] so we thank god for this opportunity
[2:29:59] amen
[2:30:00] to know
[2:30:02] who we are and
[2:30:03] to be able to recognize him
[2:30:10] she knows it's not her
[2:30:12] well if it's not her who is it
[2:30:18] it's got to be someone
[2:30:20] yeah
[2:30:21] if if there's there's there's works
[2:30:24] happening i said it this morning are we
[2:30:26] being led are we are we going deeper
[2:30:28] into the word well who led us
[2:30:32] how did we get there
[2:30:35] leadership
[2:30:37] that what i just spoke of is
[2:30:39] supernatural
[2:30:41] that is supernatural for you to go
[2:30:43] deeper into god's word is a supernatural
[2:30:45] event in your life and the purpose of
[2:30:48] the supernatural is so that the
[2:30:50] supernatural one can be identified
[2:30:53] because he wants to reveal himself he
[2:30:56] wants to be known so when we get to the
[2:30:58] place where i i i know it's not me well
[2:31:01] praise god that's exactly where he wants
[2:31:03] you to get
[2:31:06] it's not me raising my kids
[2:31:10] it is sometimes
[2:31:15] when i don't get myself out of the way
[2:31:21] but it's christ
[2:31:24] how do these things happen
[2:31:28] why do these things happen
[2:31:31] why do we see the works of god around us
[2:31:36] because god wants to identify himself
[2:31:39] as being present
[2:31:43] not not looking back to experiences
[2:31:46] of the sixties
[2:31:50] but looking back looking present tense
[2:31:54] that it must be god
[2:31:56] here in my soul
[2:31:58] because i feel the poor i i see things
[2:32:01] happening
[2:32:02] and man cannot do this i've heard lots
[2:32:04] of testimonies
[2:32:06] from the congregation here how how that
[2:32:09] people will say it just has to be god
[2:32:12] hallelujah
[2:32:14] that's exactly what god wants you
[2:32:16] identify it has to be god it can't be
[2:32:19] anyone else that this has happened and
[2:32:21] this has happened this i didn't even
[2:32:22] know how it happened i don't even know
[2:32:23] when it happened all i know is something
[2:32:25] has happened god has done something why
[2:32:28] because god wants to be identified among
[2:32:31] you personally god wants you to know him
[2:32:35] personally not of someone else's
[2:32:37] experience
[2:32:41] god is in your midst
[2:32:43] absolutely he is
[2:32:45] god is here
[2:32:47] amen he is here in the form of the holy
[2:32:50] ghost veiled behind his bride working
[2:32:53] behind his bride doing the impossible
[2:32:56] behind the bride doing something and she
[2:32:58] just stands in awe
[2:33:02] she just stands in amazement
[2:33:05] how are these things happening i tried
[2:33:07] to do that for 10 years and he does it
[2:33:09] in 30 seconds how is this happening well
[2:33:12] you were never meant to do it
[2:33:15] sarah
[2:33:17] that's god's job
[2:33:20] let god be god
[2:33:22] he doesn't need your help
[2:33:25] now let me just act this bit out no
[2:33:28] let him act just that bit out
[2:33:31] amen god is in your midst here in this
[2:33:34] fellowship in the little town of
[2:33:36] taranaki god is in taranaki
[2:33:39] amen because the idea of the revelation
[2:33:43] of the evening lights of the evening
[2:33:45] sacrifice is lord god first kings 18
[2:33:48] lord reveal yourself as being the god in
[2:33:52] israel
[2:33:55] and now we're in a time where the
[2:33:57] purpose of god revealing himself is not
[2:34:01] to reveal himself in a form of a day
[2:34:04] gone by
[2:34:06] behind a mask of a day gone by
[2:34:09] even though we cherish those times we're
[2:34:12] encouraged by those times we're
[2:34:14] encouraged by the story of david and
[2:34:16] joshua and caleb and moses and noah and
[2:34:18] sarah and hannah et cetera et cetera but
[2:34:21] but what we have today is god mask
[2:34:24] behind present tense joshua's
[2:34:27] present tense rebecca's present tense
[2:34:30] sarah's god is in our midst and it's in
[2:34:33] the midst of god
[2:34:35] here now that we are to draw
[2:34:38] courage from
[2:34:41] if god if the government takes our bible
[2:34:44] it don't matter
[2:34:46] it just don't matter because the god of
[2:34:48] this bible is in the bride
[2:34:51] the god of this bible is now masked in a
[2:34:55] bride they can take the they can take
[2:34:58] the bible they can take the sermons they
[2:35:00] can take the tapes they can take the
[2:35:02] computers they can shut down websites
[2:35:04] it's not going to make any difference
[2:35:06] because the god of the message is the
[2:35:09] god in the bride
[2:35:13] they can imprison you
[2:35:15] they can abuse you
[2:35:17] they can they can whip you they can flog
[2:35:20] you
[2:35:22] they can do whatever they want to do
[2:35:24] but it ain't going to remove god behind
[2:35:27] his bride
[2:35:30] because god will be expressed like
[2:35:32] joseph was expressed when joseph went
[2:35:35] into the pit it was god in joseph when
[2:35:38] joseph was falsely accused he was god in
[2:35:40] joseph when joseph went to prison it was
[2:35:43] god in prison
[2:35:47] yeah it was god in prison it was god in
[2:35:50] the pit it was god who was falsely
[2:35:52] accused
[2:35:54] god expressed why because it wasn't
[2:35:57] joseph joseph was the mask it was god
[2:35:59] behind the mask
[2:36:03] it doesn't matter what god doesn't
[2:36:05] matter what this government does
[2:36:08] they can't control god
[2:36:13] they couldn't control the disciples
[2:36:16] the disciples were happy that they got
[2:36:18] flogged
[2:36:22] for the cause of god
[2:36:24] they were happy
[2:36:26] big whoop did he do now don't you go and
[2:36:28] preach any more next day
[2:36:30] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[2:36:33] and forever
[2:36:34] who are these guys
[2:36:37] it was god in the disciples
[2:36:40] amen it wasn't the disciples
[2:36:44] peter was a coward
[2:36:46] before christ came in
[2:36:50] but when christ came into
[2:36:52] into peter
[2:36:53] now it was christ being expressed
[2:36:56] through peter
[2:36:59] christ being expressed
[2:37:01] through you as an
[2:37:02] individual amen the the
[2:37:05] god you can't put god in a box
[2:37:10] people have tried many many times you
[2:37:13] can't you can't put god in a prison
[2:37:16] and expect him to stay there if it's not
[2:37:18] his plan to stay there
[2:37:22] it just won't work because you can't put
[2:37:24] god behind bars
[2:37:27] and god will go
[2:37:29] god will go with the mask
[2:37:33] through the bars
[2:37:35] god will take his mask
[2:37:38] and move
[2:37:39] outside of the prison and the prison
[2:37:41] doors not even be open
[2:37:44] why because it's god
[2:37:48] the eternal one
[2:37:51] and this is where the world is coming to
[2:37:53] the world is coming to a place where
[2:37:55] they think they control god
[2:37:57] they think they are god
[2:38:00] but i'm sorry you're wrong
[2:38:04] even if you want to chop my head off
[2:38:06] chop it off
[2:38:07] but there's come in a day where this
[2:38:09] body that you cut into pieces will rise
[2:38:12] again
[2:38:12] you might think you've defeated god at
[2:38:14] this time but there's come in a time
[2:38:16] where you're going to realize you're
[2:38:18] wrong
[2:38:19] because god cannot be defeated
[2:38:23] god masked behind you god must
[2:38:26] god fulfilling
[2:38:28] your role
[2:38:30] god working through your office
[2:38:34] girlfriend boyfriend husband wife
[2:38:36] whatever it is god god is acting out
[2:38:39] that role
[2:38:42] if christ is in you
[2:38:44] and when christ is in you
[2:38:47] what do we see
[2:38:49] we see christ
[2:38:52] as a son
[2:38:55] christ as a daughter
[2:38:58] christ as a husband
[2:39:01] christ as a wife
[2:39:06] god in the wife
[2:39:08] doesn't make the wife a husband
[2:39:15] but it's christ in me yes
[2:39:17] it's christ in you
[2:39:20] christ in you
[2:39:22] fulfilling your role acting out in the
[2:39:25] office
[2:39:26] that you are in as wife
[2:39:29] and that's why the story of esther is so
[2:39:31] significant
[2:39:33] because it was god in esther
[2:39:36] that pushed through that veil
[2:39:38] she didn't come with a heart now listen
[2:39:40] here old king oh
[2:39:42] you better listen to me for a moment
[2:39:45] no she came in humbly
[2:39:48] she came in showing him respect
[2:39:51] why because it was christ in esther
[2:39:55] that that that met
[2:39:57] king of hazarus
[2:39:59] out on the throne
[2:40:01] and it's going to be christ
[2:40:04] in us
[2:40:05] that causes us
[2:40:07] to walk through into those those places
[2:40:11] through that veil
[2:40:13] and into a into a place where no one
[2:40:16] else can go this place is reserved for
[2:40:17] the bride
[2:40:20] amen so we we are a privileged people
[2:40:24] i say lord god just
[2:40:26] let let me know continue to reveal to me
[2:40:29] who i am
[2:40:30] so that i can completely dedicate
[2:40:33] everything that i am
[2:40:36] reveal to me who i am clearly lord
[2:40:40] so that i can dedicate everything that i
[2:40:42] am
[2:40:44] amen let's stand to our feet
[2:40:48] amen let's just offer a word of prayer
[2:40:49] i'll ask brother elroy to come and close
[2:40:52] the service
[2:40:54] our loving and gracious heavenly father
[2:40:58] oh lord god what a what a rest it is
[2:41:03] what a rest we can enter into
[2:41:07] lord when we understand heavenly father
[2:41:09] that
[2:41:10] you are not calling us lord god to
[2:41:12] fulfill your word
[2:41:14] but lord god you will fulfill
[2:41:17] your own word through us
[2:41:20] oh heavenly father lord god we we take
[2:41:23] up our cross
[2:41:25] we deny ourselves
[2:41:27] we offer ourselves to you this evening
[2:41:29] lord god is a living sacrifice
[2:41:32] lord we humbly approach you
[2:41:35] lord as esther approached her king
[2:41:38] lord with our needs
[2:41:41] recognizing heavenly father that we
[2:41:43] cannot fulfill our own needs
[2:41:46] but lord god you are the fulfiller of
