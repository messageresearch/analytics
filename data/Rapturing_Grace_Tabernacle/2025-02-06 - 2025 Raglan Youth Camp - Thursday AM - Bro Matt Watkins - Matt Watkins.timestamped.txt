[15:51] you have your Bible let's go straight to
[15:52] the word this morning I just want you to
[15:54] turn to 2 Samuel CH
[15:57] 23:8 we just begin reading God bless you
[16:00] I'm going to to try to um just be as
[16:03] good as I can about my time and leaves
[16:05] very uh little time but that's all right
[16:08] just um just a little introduction today
[16:11] I I am in jeans and I've never preached
[16:13] in jeans so this will be a first for me
[16:16] but um we just uh had very little time
[16:18] to prepare and so uh you just forgive me
[16:21] this morning I I just wanted to feel
[16:23] casual anyway and be more uh just an
[16:26] opening service knowing that um I I do
[16:29] believe in miracles I want to make that
[16:31] clear but it would be a miracle for me
[16:33] to be able to preach uh in this little
[16:35] bit of a of a short time frame so we are
[16:39] at 8:15 so we have 45 now brother
[16:42] bandham said a good preacher will keep
[16:43] his sermon about 30 40 minutes so I
[16:45] learned a long time ago I'm not a good
[16:48] preacher but um my name is brother Matt
[16:51] Watkins for those of you that don't know
[16:53] me um uh I am from Buford South Carolina
[16:56] we got two uh young ladies here know
[16:59] very well and they are from my home uh
[17:02] country there in the United States and
[17:04] so I also brought with me my wife uh
[17:07] Rachel who uh is uh is is going to be
[17:10] here throughout the rest of this camp
[17:12] and also a good friend of mine uh
[17:15] brother Travis Jackson and his wife
[17:17] Deborah and then their little baby so we
[17:19] brought a little group with us um I am
[17:22] from Buford uh South Carolina way on the
[17:25] East Coast uh very much like this area
[17:28] here right on the coast and uh I have
[17:30] four kids I call them kids but my oldest
[17:34] is 21 and uh he just got engaged um just
[17:38] a few days ago so he's not here none of
[17:40] them were here but I so I would show
[17:42] pictures but I didn't have time to get
[17:44] them sent and I have a a a daughter two
[17:47] daughters and another son amariah uh Zoe
[17:50] and Ethan so um my quiver is full and I
[17:54] still consider myself a young person and
[17:57] and I am still a young young person I'm
[17:59] just not as young as you but I'm not as
[18:01] old as uh brother ALR and that's all
[18:03] right so somewhere in the middle so uh
[18:06] I'm still young I'm young at heart amen
[18:09] praise the lord well we we want to um we
[18:13] want to go to the scripture here and
[18:14] just have just a few things to say and
[18:17] then maybe just start a theme throughout
[18:20] um the rest of this Camp I would like to
[18:23] just ask just at the beginning and the
[18:25] opening here how many came with an
[18:28] expect ation something specific not just
[18:31] generic to say I believe the Lord's
[18:32] going to move that's wonderful but I
[18:34] wonder did you come with a specific need
[18:38] something on your heart and you you just
[18:41] could say this is what I'm praying for
[18:43] well if you don't have that how about
[18:45] you do that now how about you identify
[18:47] now before we start Why Don't We Just
[18:49] Close Our Eyes together anden we'll just
[18:52] open with prayer and I wonder if there
[18:55] would just be something as we just take
[18:57] a moment and you take inventory and and
[19:01] that's a good thing to do and you know
[19:03] brother brandham said that unfortunately
[19:06] is the case that so many times it takes
[19:09] crisis in our life for us to take
[19:13] inventory and really assess our own life
[19:16] and he said sadly that's what it takes
[19:18] sometimes so so maybe here we are and we
[19:21] could recognize with every head bowed
[19:23] that we're here in this moment and and
[19:26] we're here you you you you at the end of
[19:29] the day that's a victory you you made it
[19:32] you made it to camp and you you you may
[19:35] not feel like you're where you should be
[19:37] spiritually and you don't feel like
[19:39] you're on top of the world but I just
[19:41] want you to recognize small victories
[19:43] you're here you're in a youth camp
[19:45] you're in the The House of the Living
[19:47] God amongst God's people and God can do
[19:50] anything for you and so just at this
[19:53] moment while we're all in our all of us
[19:55] have our bodies Our we are we have our
[19:58] minds about us our wits we have an
[20:00] opportunity it's another fresh chance
[20:04] another fresh moment as the prophet said
[20:07] each generation has a chance uh at a
[20:10] Revival a chance at the word so here's
[20:12] your opportunity and I wonder if maybe
[20:15] if we could just look at our own lives
[20:18] introspectively and as David said in the
[20:20] Psalms as I thought on my way I turn my
[20:25] feet towards his testimonies so could we
[20:28] just for a moment just at the opening of
[20:30] this camp we think on our ways think on
[20:32] our lives and just for a moment we could
[20:35] maybe identify something and say Lord
[20:38] this is what I want out of this camp
[20:42] this year and maybe we just raise a hand
[20:45] and identify just by an uplifted hand if
[20:48] you have something specific and say Lord
[20:50] this hand that I'm raising is just
[20:52] representing God bless those hands this
[20:55] is representing Lord what I need you to
[20:58] speak to me about
[20:59] about Lord Jesus you see the hands up
[21:02] father my hands up now Lord as we just
[21:05] open this Camp open this first service
[21:09] Lord God doesn't take much time to do
[21:12] this Lord as we all father are so keenly
[21:15] aware of our own life our shortcomings
[21:18] our needs father that the needs Behind
[21:21] These Hands Lord would be too many Lord
[21:24] to Father the time that we have to to
[21:27] identify
[21:28] Lord Jesus but I'm so glad that you
[21:30] before we ever raise our hand Lord you
[21:33] already know our frame you know our
[21:36] makeup Lord father you remember that we
[21:39] are but dust Lord and beyond all of the
[21:42] layers and all of the layers and the
[21:45] facades that we all have Lord I believe
[21:48] that behind that hand is a Heart Lord
[21:51] that just wants to be closer to you Lord
[21:55] a heart that just wants to Father know
[21:57] you in a more real way a more personal
[22:00] way Jesus I pray that you would just
[22:02] have complete control Lord God direct my
[22:06] spirit my mind father Lord I I've waited
[22:10] on you now these months Lord and weeks
[22:12] leading up to this pulled Lord and so
[22:15] many directions and so many burdens
[22:17] you've placed upon My Heart Lord but I I
[22:20] just want to even identify my own need
[22:23] with my hands raised Lord how much I
[22:25] need you God now to come and use me Lord
[22:27] use the gift you you placed in my life I
[22:29] pray father speak and minister to every
[22:32] need every heart May We Go From This
[22:34] Moment Lord changed not who we were when
[22:37] we came Grant it Lord now we pray in
[22:39] Jesus Christ's
[22:41] name amen amen God bless you second
[22:44] Samuel chapter 23 and verse 8 I'm going
[22:47] to speak to you just with a little bit
[22:49] of time that we have and I just give
[22:51] maybe just a little bit of um personal
[22:54] about me just a little bit of moment for
[22:56] Testimony but at the same time just in
[22:58] this as some of the foundations of what
[23:01] we'll speak this weekend I want to take
[23:03] a theme for this whole weekend and the
[23:06] theme would be he cares that's just the
[23:08] way the Lord dealt with my heart the
[23:11] whole weeks leading up to this as I just
[23:13] laid before him I just kept coming back
[23:16] to this this word that this phrase he
[23:20] cares and so if the Lord would be our
[23:22] help we want to just demonstrate that
[23:25] through his word but before we we uh
[23:28] let's just read our scripture here in 2
[23:30] Samuel
[23:32] 23:8 I want you to notice here because
[23:35] Samuel this writer is going to list the
[23:38] men the Mighty Men Who were with David
[23:42] now we know that David we know the story
[23:44] in the life of David he was a mighty man
[23:46] of God he had great many things written
[23:48] about him in the word in fact there's
[23:50] fewer men that have more of a
[23:52] three-dimensional look at their life not
[23:54] just the high times but also the low
[23:57] times the mistakes that that he made and
[23:59] the Bible says that we these things were
[24:01] written for our examples but I want you
[24:04] to notice because it's going to speak of
[24:06] different around surrounding David was
[24:09] different
[24:10] categories and categories of men and
[24:13] there was something particular about
[24:16] them that made them or separated them
[24:20] from the rest of the people in David's
[24:23] Army I'm going to use the word men but
[24:26] that's all right because we're all sons
[24:28] and Daughters of the king and we all
[24:30] have a commission upon our life and we
[24:32] all have an anointing upon our life and
[24:34] we all have a purpose for our life and
[24:37] God's purpose is for you to find that
[24:39] purpose in that he's placed before the
[24:41] foundation of the world your journey is
[24:44] all about finding the center of the will
[24:47] of God for your personal life and the
[24:50] job and the objective of Satan is to
[24:53] disrupt that and to derail you and put
[24:57] you on a different path
[25:00] so let's look at it here in verse 8
[25:01] these be the names of the Mighty Men
[25:04] whom David had the taconite that sat in
[25:06] the seat Chief among the captains the
[25:09] same was adino the eite now listen to
[25:12] what he did here in verse 8 he lifted up
[25:15] a spear against
[25:16] 800 whom he slew at one time and after
[25:21] him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the
[25:24] ahite so you can be the son of a dodo
[25:29] but still a mighty man somebody say
[25:31] praise the
[25:33] Lord one notice here because it says
[25:36] here one of the three Mighty Men so I
[25:40] want you to pick up on something very
[25:42] quickly David had an entire Army an
[25:45] entire group of soldiers are an army
[25:47] that was trained these were selected men
[25:50] but within that Army there was a group
[25:53] of what was referred to as the Mighty
[25:56] Men but even Within that Circle there
[25:59] was a smaller group called the top three
[26:03] these were the three mightiest of all of
[26:06] them and Eleazar was one of them notice
[26:08] here and when they def he says one of
[26:11] the three mighty men with David when
[26:13] they defied the Philistines that were
[26:15] gathered together to battle and the men
[26:17] of Israel were going away he arose and
[26:18] smoke the Philistines until his hand was
[26:21] weary and his hand clave upon the Sword
[26:25] and the Lord wrought a great victory
[26:27] that day and the people returned after
[26:28] him only to spoil after him was sha the
[26:31] son of age the harite and the
[26:33] Philistines were gathered together into
[26:35] a troop where there was a piece of
[26:37] ground full of lentils and the people
[26:38] fled but notice he stood in the midst of
[26:42] the ground so here was one of the marks
[26:44] of a mighty man he can stand alone when
[26:48] everybody else is
[26:50] fleeing he stood all by
[26:54] himself and S the Philistines notice in
[26:57] verse 13 three of the 30 Chief went down
[27:00] let's just move on past this because
[27:02] David we know is is in a hold there in
[27:04] the Garrison and he Longs and says all
[27:06] that one would give me a drink of the
[27:09] Waters of The Well of Bethlehem and
[27:10] notice verse 16 and the three Mighty Men
[27:13] broke through the host of the
[27:15] Philistines and Drew out water out of
[27:16] the well of Bethlehem that was by the
[27:18] gate took it brought it to David
[27:20] nevertheless he would not drink it but
[27:21] poured it unto the Lord notice there and
[27:24] he said be it far from me oh Lord that I
[27:26] should do this is this not this the
[27:27] blood of the men that went in Jeopardy
[27:29] of their lives therefore he would not
[27:31] drink it notice these things did these
[27:35] three Mighty Men it goes on to list
[27:38] others in verse 19 and it says was he
[27:41] not the most honorable of three
[27:43] therefore he was their Captain how be it
[27:46] notice how be it he attained not unto
[27:51] the first three so it was awesome that
[27:55] he was named among the Mighty Men but he
[27:59] never attained to the level of the three
[28:02] bah look at it here in verse 20 son of
[28:05] jeia the son of a valiant man of cabil
[28:08] he had done many acts somebody say acts
[28:12] now how many remembers that word in your
[28:14] New Testament Bible he had done many
[28:18] acts and he slew two lionlike men man
[28:22] I've seen a lot of really bad guys Bad
[28:25] Dudes but I've never caught anybody man
[28:28] he's lionlike
[28:30] but this man faced men in his life that
[28:33] were lionlike that's what the scripture
[28:35] says here and he he says two lionlike
[28:38] men of Moab he went down also and slew a
[28:43] lion in the midst of a pit and the Bible
[28:47] gives this detail in the time of
[28:50] snow and he slew an Egyptian a goodly
[28:54] man that goodly means huge and the
[28:56] Egyptian had a spirit in hand but he
[28:58] went down with him with the staff and
[29:00] plucked the spear out of the Egyptian
[29:02] hand and slew him with his own spear
[29:05] these things did bah the son of jeod and
[29:07] had the name among the three notice
[29:09] let's look at verse 23 he was more
[29:12] honorable than the
[29:14] 30 praise the
[29:17] Lord but he attained not to the first
[29:23] three and David set him over his guard
[29:26] it goes on to list these in and goes all
[29:28] the way through in verse 39 euriah the
[29:31] hittite
[29:32] 37 and all you can be seated this
[29:36] morning I want to just stop that here
[29:39] for a moment because to unpack that
[29:41] would just we'd be out of time and so
[29:43] Lord will and will'll go further into
[29:44] that this evening but I want to talk to
[29:46] you here for a moment just about these
[29:49] Mighty Men of God and I'm just going to
[29:51] go quickly through this but we know that
[29:54] there was within David's Army categories
[29:56] of what we would call greatness based on
[29:59] what they attained or the acts that they
[30:03] performed in their life you know it
[30:05] would have been a powerful thing just to
[30:07] be named that I was in the army of David
[30:10] but could you imagine that within that
[30:12] Army you'd have a secret service or
[30:14] maybe just a special operations unit and
[30:18] you in somehow in your life you had a
[30:21] quality or some part of your character
[30:23] or some ability or something that you
[30:25] did and as David was going through
[30:28] resumes and he was looking at you know
[30:29] resumés of people and things and
[30:32] accomplishments that they did and here
[30:33] he's trying to find his mightiest men
[30:35] and he comes over this man bayah and he
[30:38] reads about bah and it says this man
[30:40] bayah here's his resume he went down
[30:43] into a pit on a snowy day and he slew a
[30:46] lion with his bare hands and David said
[30:50] that's the god that's the guy I want
[30:52] over my my my my my select group or my
[30:56] select Army we know that Within These
[30:58] categories of greatness beyond the 30
[31:01] there was also the top three these were
[31:03] the top three the greatest out of all of
[31:06] them you think well brother Matt that's
[31:08] just in the army of David how does that
[31:10] apply to us today well we're told in The
[31:12] Book of Mark chapter 4 it says and these
[31:15] are they which are swn on good ground
[31:18] how many remember the scripture such as
[31:20] hear the word and receive it and bring
[31:23] forth notice the categories here some
[31:26] 30-fold
[31:28] some 60-fold and some 100f so you mean
[31:34] that within the parable of the sewer the
[31:37] seed which we know the prophet of God
[31:39] told us that seed represents the word of
[31:41] God and it was cast on to four different
[31:44] types of humanity or soil and only one
[31:48] of which was considered good ground it's
[31:52] amazing because the word Goes Forth in
[31:54] the entire universe and the entire world
[31:57] and the entire world can bring forth
[31:59] different fruits or different evidences
[32:02] of the Life of Christ you take Christian
[32:05] Science and brother bham said that they
[32:07] had some of the greatest fruits of the
[32:08] spirit that you can see love and
[32:11] meekness and Temperance and they were
[32:13] self-controlled and you know they were
[32:15] kind and they gave to the poor and you'd
[32:17] think my goodness that's a that's a
[32:19] great fruit you know of the spirit of
[32:21] God and the prophet of God even in early
[32:23] in his life is is saying what is the
[32:25] evidence of the Holy Ghost what is the
[32:27] evidence that a person has truly been
[32:29] born of the spirit of God and the
[32:31] prophet in his own human thinking his
[32:33] natural reaction or reply was love it
[32:36] would be love how do I know that I'm
[32:38] born of the spirit of God it would be
[32:40] that I love because what's the greatest
[32:42] weapon the prophet says God ever gave to
[32:45] man in one place he says it was love but
[32:47] he says the Holy Spirit stopped him and
[32:50] corrected him and said no no no it
[32:52] couldn't be love though love is a fruit
[32:54] of the spirit yet the because the
[32:57] Christian Science had more love than any
[32:59] of the other denominations any of the
[33:01] symol of God people they had more of the
[33:05] humanity the human aspect of the life of
[33:08] this of Jesus yet Christian Science
[33:12] denies the deity of Jesus Christ so
[33:17] brother bam says well then what would it
[33:18] be how do I know that I'm truly born of
[33:20] the spirit of God it must be some gift
[33:23] some external gift of speaking in
[33:25] tongues the prophet says that's what the
[33:28] Pentecostal Church went away with I in
[33:30] order to say that you're truly born of
[33:32] the spirit of God you've got to have
[33:34] some outward manifestation and in the
[33:37] book of Acts they had an outward
[33:38] manifestation of speaking in tongues so
[33:40] it would mean that to be born again
[33:42] you've got to speak in tongues and the
[33:44] prophet says that sounded
[33:46] good but it couldn't be because he says
[33:50] I've seen Witch Doctors those that would
[33:52] drink blood out of a human skull speak
[33:54] it an unknown language and another would
[33:56] interpret it and you say that they would
[33:58] be born of the spirit of God and the
[34:01] prophet says no well then it couldn't be
[34:04] that then what would but I I just want
[34:06] to pause here for a moment brother
[34:08] brandham was not doing away with
[34:12] love hello come on somebody uh we have a
[34:16] show back home it's called Judge Judy
[34:18] and it's it's it's uh if you ever heard
[34:20] of Judge Judy she has a famous statement
[34:23] when she's talking to a plaintiff she
[34:25] says mhm is not an answer
[34:29] answer what is our answer amen
[34:33] amen so so notice here what I want to
[34:36] point out to you is that brother
[34:37] brandham was not doing away with the
[34:40] fruits of the spirit he weren't saying
[34:42] he was not saying that they were an
[34:44] Evidence he was just saying they were
[34:46] not the evidence of the Holy Ghost now
[34:49] if we can believe that he wasn't put in
[34:51] the way love then we must also believe
[34:53] he was not all he was not putting away
[34:55] gifts either he was not diminishing love
[34:59] nor was he diminishing speaking in
[35:01] tongues but he was saying away with
[35:04] experiences for a measuring line you
[35:07] must come back to the word of your hour
[35:09] because you can say that oh I would have
[35:11] defended Jesus and if I lived in that
[35:14] day you know when the Roman soldiers
[35:16] were crucifying him man if I would have
[35:18] lived there brother Matt I wouldn't have
[35:19] been in that crowd saying crucified him
[35:22] I would have been on his side I would
[35:23] have standed stood for him I would have
[35:26] defended the Lord Jesus and brother says
[35:28] now that's good big talk but he says I
[35:30] can tell you what you would have done in
[35:33] that day by showing you what do you do
[35:36] with the word revealed for your
[35:39] generation and it will identify what you
[35:42] would have done back there so notice
[35:43] here there's different categories of
[35:46] greatness because even within all of the
[35:49] so the word that was swed across the
[35:51] whole world what did it bring forth it
[35:54] brought forth denominations it brought
[35:56] forth Assemblies of God Church Church of
[35:57] Christ Church of God Presbyterian
[35:59] Anglican pres uh uh Catholic it brought
[36:02] forth all of this ground but yet within
[36:05] all of the manifested universal church
[36:09] yet there was only one ground that was
[36:12] called good ground
[36:15] yeah but even within that good ground I
[36:19] want you to notice there was different
[36:23] categories of
[36:25] Effectiveness or fruitfulness
[36:28] within the within the product that was
[36:30] brought forth can we look at it here
[36:32] again in Mark chapter 4 and if you have
[36:34] a Bible I want you to stay with me as
[36:36] close as you can uh Mark chapter 4 and
[36:39] you could just hold your place there and
[36:40] we're just reading for verse 20 but it
[36:42] says that some brought forth 30 some 60
[36:45] some 100 and so it shows that only one
[36:48] out of all of the ground was considered
[36:51] good ground even in this productive
[36:55] fruitful fertile another words potential
[36:58] to bring forth the Life of Christ let me
[37:00] close that Loop the prophet of God says
[37:02] then what is the evidence of the Holy
[37:05] Ghost it's it's being able to say Amen
[37:09] to every word of God that's one way he
[37:11] says it another way he says it this way
[37:14] he says it is the proof that your life
[37:17] comes subject to the word for your hour
[37:21] it is believing your day and its message
[37:24] not just a mental asense saying I
[37:26] believe it because the Devils believe
[37:28] and tremble but it's the ability to
[37:30] bring your life subject to the
[37:34] word so notice this here because even
[37:37] within this productive fertile potential
[37:40] in other words we could say seed of God
[37:42] elected predestinated before the
[37:44] foundation of the world even within that
[37:47] ground even within that soil it's
[37:50] amazing and no worthy that there was
[37:53] different degrees Yeah of fruit bearing
[37:59] denoting different categories of
[38:02] Christian the Christian Life Jesus says
[38:06] in St John I think it's chapter 15 and
[38:08] he says every Branch notice every Branch
[38:10] all of them every Branch Jesus says in
[38:14] me that beareth not fruit how many
[38:16] remember this scripture he says he takes
[38:19] it away and every branch that beareth
[38:22] fruit he purgeth it that it brings forth
[38:26] more fruit and he that abideth in me and
[38:28] I in him the same bringeth forth much
[38:31] fruit fruit fruit fruit what is the
[38:35] objective of the holy spirit in your
[38:38] life to get born again well that's
[38:41] wonderful but is the Lord done when
[38:44] you're born of the spirit of
[38:46] God ah we just put our feet back and you
[38:50] know stick them up on the Ste and we'll
[38:51] put it in cruise control we just cruise
[38:53] on to the coming of the
[38:55] Lord oh no
[38:58] no it's nowhere near
[38:59] complete but you see the holy spirit's
[39:02] activity even those even to the born
[39:05] again and when I say born again I I I
[39:07] don't mean Justified I don't mean it
[39:09] varying degrees of sanctification I
[39:11] don't even mean just the gift of the
[39:13] Holy Ghost meaning in your flesh but
[39:15] even those that are sealed born again
[39:17] which means to be baptized by the holy
[39:19] ghost means to be born again even within
[39:23] that group of the elected Quicken seed
[39:27] yeah
[39:27] yet there is still an operation of the
[39:31] Holy Ghost in your life purging out your
[39:34] old nature purging out your old self for
[39:38] this purpose to bring forth
[39:41] fruit can you say amen and so notice
[39:44] here this is the highest category and
[39:47] and and and and this is he says except a
[39:49] corn of wheat you know this in John 12
[39:52] except a corn of wheat die fall into the
[39:55] ground and die it Abid
[39:57] alone all by itself but if it dies then
[40:02] it brings forth much fruit so I want you
[40:07] to notice here because out of all of
[40:09] these men there was different categories
[40:12] of spiritual greatness I'm feeling the
[40:14] pressure of that clock
[40:17] now so let me just pause that can we can
[40:20] you freeze frame that here for a moment
[40:22] and I want to tell you that within all
[40:24] of these men you say how did they ever
[40:26] make this lists how did they ever I'm
[40:30] going to give you some principles if you
[40:31] have a pen and paper you can you're
[40:33] welcome to write it down I don't have
[40:35] time to unpack any of these I'm just
[40:36] going to say them and then we're going
[40:38] to Lord willing will be able to preach
[40:40] them how many know that brother bandam
[40:42] said character is not a
[40:44] gift it's a victory there's no Victory
[40:48] without a battle and so there was
[40:50] something about these people we could
[40:52] call it the marks of a mighty man what
[40:56] made him different what separated him
[40:59] from the rest of the pack what was David
[41:02] looking for and I'm going to give you
[41:03] some of these what I've labeled and the
[41:06] Lord's given me as marks of a mighty man
[41:10] one of the marks of a mighty man is that
[41:12] his core and his Center not the facade
[41:15] not what you see out here in front but
[41:18] at the center of his being at the core
[41:21] and the center is one desire to be in
[41:24] the presence of the Lord all the days of
[41:27] his
[41:28] life he has also one of the marks of a
[41:31] mighty man is that private
[41:35] Victory is more important than public
[41:38] victory
[41:40] yeah in other words a lot of people love
[41:43] to have the outside looking good but man
[41:46] the inside's just a
[41:48] mess one of the marks of this Mighty Man
[41:51] is that he has victory in his private
[41:53] life you could think of David and The
[41:56] Lion and the bear will we'll get to that
[41:57] later another Mark of a mighty man is
[42:00] that he's a giant slayer yeah David
[42:02] wasn't the only Giant Slayer but courage
[42:06] breeds courage and he was actually
[42:08] surrounded by other men who slew Giants
[42:12] another uh another Mark of a mighty man
[42:16] is that he can discern the anointed word
[42:20] for his age another Mark of a mighty man
[42:23] is that he isn't Fearless
[42:28] did you say that right brother Matt look
[42:30] back at your note make sure you said it
[42:32] right hold on we're talking about
[42:34] Supermen super
[42:36] women did you say that right yeah I did
[42:40] Mighty Men of God mighty mighty women of
[42:44] God are not
[42:47] Fearless they actually are people with
[42:50] great
[42:51] fear but they face their fears
[42:58] in fact one of the marks of a mighty man
[43:01] is that they depend their life they
[43:04] depend on the words fear
[43:07] not you see most Christians never have
[43:11] the luxury of his is a powerful
[43:14] statement I wrote down I took it from a
[43:16] just a little oneliner I read in a
[43:19] little devotional book that I have most
[43:22] Christians never have the luxury of
[43:25] hearing the word
[43:27] from their father saying fear not child
[43:31] because they never attempt anything
[43:33] great enough to Merit that
[43:37] command now fear we know is the
[43:40] beginning of wisdom how many know that
[43:42] and we know that the Bible says he's not
[43:44] given us the spirit of fear so you could
[43:48] spend your entire life fearing the wrong
[43:51] things in fact Satan's job is to get you
[43:53] to spend your life suffocating under the
[43:57] fear of what will happen and you're
[43:59] actually fearing things that will never
[44:01] take place in your
[44:02] life and if the devil can get you so
[44:05] paralyzed under that fear and he'll get
[44:08] you spinning your mind over something
[44:10] that'll never take place never actually
[44:12] happen it's a figment of your
[44:14] imagination so let me give you some of
[44:16] these fear knots and you could just
[44:18] remember these if you want to write them
[44:20] you better write quick cuz I got to say
[44:21] them
[44:22] quick fear not the attack of Satan but
[44:27] rather fear that you never make Satan's
[44:30] hit
[44:33] listow fear not the
[44:37] unknown but rather fear that you never
[44:40] find out what's beyond the
[44:42] unknown fear not a life with dark
[44:46] trials and tests some that will bring
[44:49] you to the brink of life itself fear not
[44:53] a life full of sorrow and trouble and
[44:58] trials and a cup of
[45:01] pain and distress but rather fear you
[45:05] say brother Matt I'm not to fear that
[45:07] type of life no the life that you ought
[45:09] to be fearing is a life of
[45:12] ease and
[45:14] complacency to where you're just rocked
[45:17] asleep I'm in the message I believe
[45:20] God's in a
[45:21] prophet and the devil says go to
[45:25] sleep go to sleep
[45:27] what to sleep little
[45:30] baby I'm I my mom and dad were in church
[45:33] I was raised in church I'm okay here's
[45:35] another Youth Camp just another
[45:38] opportunity meet my friends fear that
[45:42] type of
[45:43] life you see one of the greatest things
[45:45] the devil can put on you the prophet of
[45:47] God said if you didn't he says it's not
[45:49] cancer but it's the fear of
[45:53] cancer one of the greatest things that
[45:55] brother brandom said that Satan could
[45:56] put on on you is fear you say what is
[45:58] fear brother Matt fear is a distressing
[46:01] negative sensation I'm just reading this
[46:03] straight from Brother Wikipedia he's a
[46:05] good brother
[46:06] sometimes it's a stressing negative
[46:09] sensation induced by a perceived threat
[46:13] it's a basic survival mechanism this is
[46:15] fear occurring in response to a specific
[46:18] stimulus such as pain or the threat of
[46:21] danger fear is the ability to recognize
[46:24] danger leading to an urge to either
[46:27] confront it or flee from it also known
[46:29] as the flight or fight response in
[46:32] extreme cases of fear a terror or freeze
[46:36] of paralysis response is
[46:40] possible you know they they they they
[46:42] they bottle this made they made this
[46:44] bottle this up really easy to to
[46:46] identify that flight or fight um you see
[46:50] people will always respond one or two
[46:52] ways they'll either face it or they'll
[46:53] run from it and so they had a man in a
[46:56] dress uh not dressed but he was a man
[46:58] that was just uh hidden I should say in
[47:01] a trash can and and and he just hid down
[47:04] inside it there and so they had you know
[47:06] guys and uh going over and you know to
[47:08] take out the trash and they'd lift it up
[47:10] and man he'd just you know jump out and
[47:13] it was amazing because they had a super
[47:15] slow motion camera on the face of these
[47:18] big oh man guys just atess men just big
[47:22] you know tough looking guys and they'd
[47:24] walk over to there and they'd and you
[47:26] could just see the slow motion cameras
[47:33] they and they would just those big old
[47:36] guys man they would shrink and they'd
[47:38] fall backwards you know screaming like
[47:40] girls and most all of them did that and
[47:43] you can just see you know the out Outer
[47:45] veneer is really not an identification
[47:47] of the the real man that's on the inside
[47:50] but then this little old guy man he was
[47:52] just a little scny guy he walks right up
[47:54] there and he opens that thing and that
[47:56] guy it was just there was no fear was an
[47:59] instant
[48:00] [Laughter]
[48:04] bam he just gave was the natural
[48:07] reaction if you come at me you're going
[48:09] to get that kind of
[48:10] reply it's amazing because there's this
[48:13] is the fight or flight this is how we
[48:15] respond to fear some of the most common
[48:18] fears according to surveys some of the
[48:20] most common fears is the fear of
[48:24] ghosts the existence of evil power
[48:27] cockroaches do you have cockroaches here
[48:31] spiders some of y'all sisters says
[48:35] Heen some of y'all brothers would too if
[48:37] you were
[48:40] honest
[48:42] snakes some of the greatest fears is the
[48:45] fear of heights the fear of water some
[48:48] people fear water enclosed spaces
[48:51] tunnels Bridges needles social rejection
[48:55] failure greatest fear fear failure
[48:59] exams but of all of the fears that were
[49:03] listed the greatest fear that people uh
[49:07] Express that they have it's amazing you
[49:10] say what is it what is the greatest fear
[49:14] the fear of public
[49:19] speaking the fear of speaking out in
[49:23] public isn't that amazing that the
[49:25] greatest thing that the devil an attack
[49:27] is the ability to respond with your
[49:31] voice because the Bible says let the
[49:33] redeemed of the
[49:35] Lord say so Hallelujah you see there's
[49:38] something so powerful about using the
[49:42] voice God gave you to
[49:45] speak in fact your words when you
[49:48] confess it and when you speak it have
[49:52] the ability to freeze it and change the
[49:55] situation and atmosphere around you just
[49:58] your words will do that not thinking it
[50:00] but speaking it that's why it's so
[50:02] powerful that we don't just
[50:04] gohm but we say
[50:07] Amen it sounds so natural you know so
[50:10] what's the lord's spiritual and though
[50:13] the but the but but to the Greek mind
[50:15] that's true everything's just all either
[50:18] spiritual or natural but to the Jewish
[50:20] the Hebrew mind the natural and the
[50:22] spiritual are directly
[50:24] connected and brother Adam says the
[50:26] natural always types the spiritual right
[50:29] so your voice what did Brother brandham
[50:31] say in Jehovah Gyra when he's telling
[50:33] about the squirrels and sister Hade
[50:35] writes there and her two boys and
[50:37] brother Bram says sister Hattie I don't
[50:39] know what it was other than Jehovah Gyra
[50:42] and brother Bram says she spoke up and
[50:44] says Amen brother brandham that's
[50:46] nothing but the truth and brother
[50:48] brandham says when she spoke those words
[50:50] not thought
[50:51] him not just held him in but when she
[50:54] spoke those words she brother bam says
[50:58] it felt like the room was going to come
[51:01] apart and he says it moved Heaven my
[51:06] goodness when she spoke the words amen
[51:09] she agreed with the word and brother
[51:12] brandham says the voice of God spoke to
[51:14] him and says you tell that sister Hattie
[51:16] anything she asks for right now will be
[51:19] granted to her now what would have
[51:22] happened had she bottled that up and not
[51:25] let it out
[51:31] right say brother Matt that's CH that's
[51:34] really Elementary well it might be but
[51:36] why did Jesus spit on the ground why
[51:39] didn't he just heal the man but he
[51:41] bought up some some Earth and he put it
[51:43] on the man why did non have to dip in
[51:46] the not one time not two times not three
[51:48] times why was it why did brother
[51:51] brandham have to speak to the storm why
[51:53] did sister Hatty W have to speak and say
[51:56] Amen why was it that brother Welch
[51:59] brother Banks Woods is brother brandom
[52:00] and he picks up a stone he throws it in
[52:02] the air he did something physical and
[52:04] when he did something physical there was
[52:06] a supernatural reaction in another
[52:08] dimension you see this is how God has
[52:10] made us the natural types the
[52:13] spiritual and so one of the greatest
[52:15] things the devil can put on you is fear
[52:18] and one of your greatest weapons that
[52:20] you have to fight that fear is the voice
[52:22] God gave you to speak out and say Satan
[52:25] you're a liar Satan you're a bluff Satan
[52:29] I identify the spirit that's trying to
[52:31] affect me and I'm going to declare
[52:33] you're a liar and my God is is the God
[52:36] of all
[52:38] gods and so we have nine minutes praise
[52:40] the Lord and so it's amazing because
[52:44] that's one of the greatest fears is the
[52:46] fear to speak in public the fear to
[52:50] express the fear to name it or speak it
[52:53] out I I I think it's so powerful
[52:57] such a powerful thing that even within
[52:59] even within the Jewish uh culture even
[53:02] today and you'd look at hidic or uh what
[53:04] they call heric Jews and they pray
[53:06] reading Torah and you could watch them
[53:08] as they move and they move like this
[53:10] they don't just statically you know you
[53:12] know just read it very mundanely you
[53:14] know intellectually but they believe
[53:16] that when they read the word of God it's
[53:18] a supernatural Dynamic experience and
[53:21] they've got to interact with the text
[53:24] that they're that they're reading oh if
[53:25] we'd ever treat our Bibles that way I
[53:27] believe we'd get something more out of
[53:29] it that what you're reading when you
[53:31] read the word of God is not just a text
[53:33] that was written 4,000 2,000 years ago
[53:35] but it was actually it's actually a
[53:37] living organism it's a life it's not a
[53:41] thing it's not a Doctrine the message is
[53:43] not a Doctrine it's not a dress code
[53:45] come on somebody it's not just a way of
[53:48] life it's not a lifestyle it's a
[53:52] person and my question is do you know
[53:54] that person not do you know about him
[53:56] not do you know the message not do you
[53:58] know the quotes not do you know the
[53:59] dress code not do you know the right
[54:01] things to say but do you know
[54:05] him
[54:07] him him that's the most important thing
[54:11] we can know is him more than about him
[54:16] it's good thing to know about him but to
[54:18] know him personally for yourself what is
[54:21] the evidence what is the baptism of the
[54:23] Holy Ghost brother brandom would say it
[54:24] this way it is the Revel
[54:26] of Jesus Christ to
[54:29] you personally amen can we stand at our
[54:33] feet this morning we just laid a little
[54:36] Foundation Lord that's all we had time
[54:38] for and that's okay maybe that's all you
[54:40] needed this morning Lord just to express
[54:43] some of these things Lord I could
[54:45] already feel the the the urging Lord the
[54:49] the pulling of your spirit Lord on mine
[54:52] I I'm just thankful for that I already
[54:55] feel Lord God the
[54:56] the hearts of these young people Lord
[54:59] who came here father for the right
[55:02] reasons not not Lord just for another
[55:05] year and another camp

[55:11] just going through the motions and doing
[55:13] the same thing over and over
[55:16] again Lord and we just go from one
[55:18] meeting to the next one Camp to the next
[55:20] Lord let it not be I wonder if there'd
[55:23] be a hand here that identify and say

[55:28] year be different let me let me look at
[55:32] it different Lord I I want to be changed

[56:03] Lord if we would look at you as the
[56:05] unlimited untapped resources father you
[56:09] could do more father than we we could
[56:11] ever think or ask Lord I pray that you
[56:13] would do it bless every life bless every
[56:15] heart God I pray Lord God May these
[56:19] words father that we've spoken Lord in
