I mean, brother Tony, when whenever you ready, brother, just at your own time. Amen. Let's sing. I have a [Music] maker. I have a maker. [Music] before my [Music] heart.

Praise the Lord. I just really blessed by the songs this morning. So much along the line that uh I believe the Lord's put on my heart, the subject to speak on. And so you just kind of it's it's a nice thing, you know, you hear the song sing this is just right along the line that I believe the Lord wants us to to focus on this morning. So, uh, I'm pleased about that. Amen. It's good to see you. God bless you each one. We're, um, we're always pleased when we can catch up with brethren we haven't seen for a while, but see, we're still pressing on the upward way. We're getting closer to home. I think we can see that uh the situation in the world, God bless you, brother Paul, is uh that the situation in the world is just deteriorating so quickly, so badly. But um that's signs of home for us. Amen. So we're thankful to know that uh all the signs that the the scriptures given us, the prophet has pointed us to, we see them being fulfilled and we're we're on our way home. Amen. God bless you. Thank you, musicians. And maybe if you just take your scripture while you're standing, we'll read out of Romans. Romans chapter 11. I heard from brother Al this morning. He sent me a text from wherever he is over in South Africa. I just uh wishing us well and and so just pass on greetings from him and um know that they're thinking of us as well. Romans chapter 11 and verse 33. It says here, "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How uncarchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out. Who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counselor?" Verse 36. For of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever. Amen. Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just read the scripture, but Lord, I pray that you'd just break the the thought of these things to us, Lord, that we can truly grasp how great you are and the position that you've called for us to be into. We ask and pray in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. God bless you. May be seated. Now, the the subject that I've uh felt on my heart to speak on this morning is is a pretty big subject and uh not so much that it's long to preach, but uh that it's a it's a big subject. And I've entitled it comprehending the infinite mind. Comprehending the infinite mind. Here we know that we are we're in finite minds. We know that our thinking is limited. um our abilities are limited. But yet we're coming to a God who is infinite and that his thinking is infinite. He he doesn't he doesn't have anything that restricts him other than his own word. When he says I will do something, he's restricted. He has to do that. When he says I won't do something, he's restricted by that. But apart from that, he's unlimited. He's infinite. And it would seem like an impossibility for us to even broach this subject of comprehending the infinite mind apart from the fact that he says that's what I want you to do. I want you to know me. I want you to understand me. So how can finite creatures like us comprehend and understand him? But that's what he wants. So, he's got to make a way and he has made a way that we can come to him that we can interface with this the infinite God. And when we when we get to the end of the story, the end of the of even the service this morning, we should be able to see that not only is he wanting us that to to understand him, but he says actually you are like me. Wow. That that's a far cry from how we feel. when you got up this morning, did you feel like the almighty God? I didn't feel like that. But yet, that's who we are. And it's there's an amnesia. There's a there's something that's got to be broken away from understanding that we can actually see who we are in him. And so, Lord willing, that's where we're going to go with this this morning. Amen. So it is a paradox that we would come to this understanding of who he is and who we are in him. He's the great creator that created the whole universe. But he wants to be known. David in the Psalms he says when I consider thy heavens and the work of thy fingers, the moon, the stars which they hast ordained, what is man that thou art mindful of them? How come the great creator of the whole universe takes an interest in you? and takes an interest in me. But that's what the Bible says. He came and he himself came and became a man and died for you, the creator of heaven and earth. Amen. And the things I want to say this morning, you know, they they relate to people who are believers. If we're not a believer, we can't claim them. But he's given us the opportunity. He's he's opened the the the availability for us to accept him and accept his ways. And if we do, he says, "Now I want you to come up and stand with me and see your position in me." Amen. What is man that they are mindful of him and the son of man that they visit visitor him. And then Paul with all the different things that he writes, he gets to Philippians and he says, "Oh that I that I may know him may know him in the power of his resurrection." Wow. He wants to know this great Jehovah God. And I'm so thankful for the message that we've received. We know things that generations and uh thousands of years ago they wanted to know. Yeah, that's right. We know things that science is trying to figure out and it's just been handed to us. Amen. We should be such a thankful people. Amen. If we feel like sometimes we're down in the dumps, say, "Hey, what's going on here?" because that's that's the devil trying to put us in that position because actually we are kind of his kind. Amen. That's who we are. We're kind of of the kind of the Lord. It it's it's an amazing thing, but hopefully you're not quite convinced yet, but by the time we get to the end, hopefully he will be. Amen. So, that's where we're heading with that. But we have amazing insights into uh the mind of Christ. All right. Now just here we're we are three-dimensional beings ourselves. Not just so much that we live in a three-dimensional world, but we we have a body that's physically us. We have a spirit which is our human spirit. That's that's what we would say that's our human life. And then we have a soul realm which is that's God himself. That's our theophony. That's the eternal part part of us. And people when they're looking and trying to find answers to all sorts of things in in this life, it's science. They look in the physical world world. They look in this realm. They're looking everywhere to try and find God. But he is so complex. They can't find him. And he didn't intend that we would find him in the physical realm. We see his handiwork. We're in awe of what he's done. You can't interface with them because the level of his understanding to our understanding is the the the gulf is just too wide. Amen. And even in the spiritual realm, people often get they feel this and they go to all sorts of different things to try and get psychology and psychology and things trying to understand who we are and the you can't understand you know you know people say no one understands me. That's absolutely true because we don't understand ourselves. That's right. So so what about understanding somebody else in spirit realm? It's a complete waste of time. But supernaturally in the soul realm, we're part of him. Amen. And that's where we need to be focusing on. That's why we come to church. That's we need to know him in the power of his resurrection. Now, you know, Satan right now, Brother Random tells us, is in heaven and he's accuser of the brethren. He talks with God and and he and he say, "Oh, look what they're doing." And the Lord says, "It's under the blood. It's under the blood." He's saying that but you know Satan doesn't know God yet he talks to God. Brother Brandham said Satan the spirit of the devil which is now as the accuser of the brethren. He says when Satan when the church is taken up Satan's cast out and then Satan comes and incarnates himself Antichrist called the beast. But he says but the devil is religious as can be. Smart scholarly polished but yet he knows no more about God than a rabbit would know about snowshoes. So it's not the knowing that we're talking about. He can talk to God. He can interface with him, but he doesn't know him because it's not a relationship with him. Amen. So we need to have that relationship with him. And he's made one way that that's a possibility. Amen. So God doesn't just want us to to know about him. He wants us to know him. Amen. when he was uh talking to Moses, he said, you know, and all the great things happened to Moses' ministry, but he says, um, tell them to make a sanctuary. Make a place where I can dwell with them. Wow. Let them make me a sanctuary. Exodus 25:8, let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them. Wow. And then Steven in Acts 7 when he's giving his address to the council, he says, Solomon built him a house. How be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, is sth the prophet. Heaven is my throne, and earth is my foottool. What house will ye build me, saith the Lord. What is the place of my rest? Hath not my hand made all these things? But then in Corinthians 6, he says, what know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost? Wow. The temple, the place of the of rest for Jehovah God. He's chosen to be in you and chosen to be in me right here. And then brother Brandham says here, God is right here. He says, let's see if we can see him. And then he says, uh, by God's help, I'm going to try and prove to you that he's right, that God is right here. First, we're going to talk about God in his creation, a next God in his word, a next God in his son, a next God in his people. And let's see if we can see him. So, I kind of want to follow through this little uh the same sequence this morning. And we're going to talk sometime just a little while about some science facts. And I won't go too long cuz some of you will get really bored with that. But so maybe some of the children might find that a little interesting. So we're going to have a look at some of those things. God in his creation and God in his word, God in his son, and next God in his people. Amen. So that's where we're we're heading. You know, God is incredibly complex. Everything that he has made intersects and intertwines with everything else. I read recently somewhere that the planet Jupiter, which is five times further away from us than than we are from the sun. So, it's a long long way away, but they worked out that it is in exactly the right place in its orbit from the sun to protect Earth from asteroids and and comets and so forth. They said if it was 10% closer it would protect Venus. If it was 10% further away it would protect Mars. But where it is mathematically they've calculated it's it's saves us from a lot of trouble. And some years ago there was an asteroid that crashed into Jupiter called Schumaka Levy and it's it was in 10 pieces but the biggest piece that hit Jupiter it set up a firestorm that was bigger than the size of the whole earth. So if it hit us, we wouldn't be here. But he's got Jupiter just going around at the right place. So everything intertwines. Everything. If one thing was out of place, Brother Brim says that would throw the whole thing into chaos. But he knows what he's doing. Amen. Amen. So because it's so complex, the more that science works out, the more improbable that we would actually be here. They've calculated that it just got the more and more things that they discover the more and more this can't be. It's so precise that so they've said because it can't be by by chance they've come up with this theory they call the multiverse and the multiverse principle or theory is that there must be an infinite number of in of universes or at least an infinite number of trials at universes and we just happen to live on the lucky one. Now that this that sounds ridiculous, but that's actually what they believe. And and there must be an infinite number of dimensions that these trials have taken place in. And they fail fail fail hasn't worked. But we happen to be on the lucky one. And I got something here just to read to you in a second from uh a chap that you probably have heard of. Uh Stephven Hawking. Stephven Hawking. He was a English theoretical physicist and cosmin cosmologist. And he said, "They talk about the big bang, right? The big bang." Now, we actually believe in a big bang. It's called creation. It was under control. It was designed. Brother says, you know, when he made the the heavens and the earth and so forth, he said, "Yeah, that was billions of years ago." But he just let it play out in time till he got everything in the right place. He's in no hurry. That's the way it is. But I'm sure when he started it would have been pretty noisy if there been any any air for the noise to travel through. But it would have been a colossal bang when he started. But anyhow, science they believe in a big bang cuz they can see the the remnants of it uh in space even now. But he says here just and I'm not saying the science has got everything right. But this is just kind of gives you a bit of an idea how unlikely it is that we would be here by chance. If the rate of expansion 1 second after the big bang bang had been smaller by even one part in a 100,000 million million, it would have recolapsed before it reached its present size. On the other hand, if it had been greater by a part in a million, the universe would have expanded too rapidly for stars and planets to form. They know it's so highly unlikely. So, we've got to have another theory because uh they have to have an infinite number of tries to get what we've got because they won't they're not prepared to accept that there could be an infinite creator. The real answer is that the infinite mind of an infinite God just tweaked things exactly right so we could be here. But if you're not prepared to accept that, you've got to come up with a wild theory that there's just so many just universes just blowing up all over the show and we happen to be on the lucky one. That's insane really. All right. Another thing that's insane is that if uh if science sees something uh complexity is a marker of uh intelligent design. So if you see something that's that's complicated, you see a maybe a Ferrari go down the road, you don't go, "Wow, evolution's great, you know." But if an archaeologist finds a stone tool, and it's and it's actually it's been sharpened to a point. It's a rock, but it's been sharpened to a point. He goes, "This was a a very advanced civilization." It's very advanced. Look, it's stone tool. they've made it. And then if they find one that's got a wooden handle on it, that these were intelligent people. These were so intelligent. And yet when science discovered and decoded the genome, they found that our genome, the the DNA of us has three billion pairs of coded computer code. Three billion pairs in every cell in every 30 trillion cells that are in our body. and they go, "Oh, don't know where that came from." It's insane. Because intelligence, the the complexity of design speaks of a designer. Amen. I'm glad he's opened our eyes. We see those things. It seems so simple when you see it. But brother Brennham tells us that before the beginning, he says there was nothing. He said there was no light. There's no dark, no atoms, no nothing, nothing tangible, no time, nothing past, present or future. There was just nothing except the infinite mind of Jehovah God. That was it. Just that was all there was. The infinite mind of Jehovah God. You see, there's no light, no dark, there's no nothing. It just seems nothing. But in there is that great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space of all places of all times. And he says he wasn't even God then because God is an object to worship and there was nothing to worship him. He says and then he made angels. He says when he created angels there was something to worship him and then technically that that made made him under the definition of God. Amen. Now God can do all things. Brother M says and he can do things that are not written in the Bible because he's God. In Job he says God thunder marvelously with his voice. Great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend. I think if we're being realistic, that's it. He He does great things. We say, I can't work that out. That's how it is. And then in Psalms, he said, "He tellth the number of the stars, and he calleth them all by their names." Okay, that's a lot of names. You know, in our galaxy, which is the Milky Way, we have up to 400 billion stars. 400 billion. I tell you what a billion is. Does anybody know what a billion is? Okay, it's it's a real big number. It's hard to get your head around, but if you had a box that was a meter wide this way and that way, and a meter high and you filled it with granular sand like this, like salt filled it with sand, you'd have a billion. That's a billion. A box that big. A meter by a meter. A cubic meter filled with granular sand is a billion. Just so you got a bit of an idea. 400 billion in our galaxy and science believe that there's two trillion galaxies in the universe each with around about 400 billion stars in them. So a big number but I only say that to say this God says I know them all by name. His understanding is infinite. Amen. And some of them have probably got your name on them. Amen. Praise the Lord. And just while we're on the sciency line, the the complexity of even our galaxy, it's what's what's called uh it's considered to be a uh a quiet galaxy. And we live in a quiet place in our galaxy on one of the the radio arms. In fact, we're just slightly off the radio arm. We can see through out like a window up and down. We can see other galaxies outside because we're not in in too uh much of a a traffic jam of other stars. In fact, if there was any stars that were close enough to us that were going to supernova, um, we would within 50 light years of us, we'd be in trouble. But in our neighborhood, just as it turns out, we don't have any of those. But outside, the supernova is happening all the time and they would blow us to bits. But not here. He knows what he's doing. Amen. All right. The Earth is just the right distance from the Sun to be what they call a Goldilock zone. We've got a molten core which creates a magnetic field protect us from the sun. I think they say here every second one and a half million tons of solar material shoot out of the sun traveling at 100 miles per second and our magnetic field deflects them away cuz they're ionized. So they go either to one pole or the other and they miss us and go straight past. Otherwise we'd be fried by those uh their solar winds and so forth coming from the sun. the atmosphere that was is made up happens to be just right. I saw somebody saying that if we got 21% oxygen, but if we had 25% oxygen, there'd be wildfires everywhere. It's a it's a fine fine balance. And then the rest of it, most of it is nitrogen, which is an inert gas. It doesn't affect anything. But oxygen is is a is a really uh it's a pretty ferocious gas, but it just happens to suit us for us breathing and so forth. It'll do a lot of damage if we had too much of it. All right, there's a couple more things if you bear with me because I I find it interesting. The the the spin speed of the Earth, you know, you think, how does that just happen? You know, we're we're doing 1,000 mph at the equator, so 24,000 mi round, so we go around in 24 24 hours. But if the spin speed of the Earth just happened to be 10% faster, we'd have wind speeds up to 400 kilometers an hour. That's bad. Just by the way, it's that's not good. 400 km an hour. And if the spin speed happened to be 10% slower, we'd go to 60° in the daytime and -50° at night. They're both bad. Okay. So, so the the balance of everything and and you you could go on, you know, a scientist could could tell you these things for forever in a day. The the amazing coincidence that just happened to be the right the right balance for us to be here. Amen. So, that's why we're happy to say, "Thank you, Lord. You do do all things well." Amen. And after you've got through all of that, then we get to life. And science has no idea what life is. They say they they know what life does. They've got a definition of life, but life's not actually in this physical realm. So they cannot when somebody uh when when somebody dies, the body is still absolutely complete. But there's something missing. That's the spirit of life. Amen. It's the spirit of life. It's in a different dimension than what we're looking. So science can't explain what life is. They can't explain where life come from. and they can't explain certainly can't explain the purpose of life. They can just look at some of the biology and say we breathe air and we have chemical reactions and so forth and that keeps us ticking along. But and and they do that by what's really called reverse engineering. You know when you take reverse engineering is when you take something that somebody else has made and maybe like this piano here and you pull it all to bits. Oh, that's how it works. But it doesn't mean you're the designer. It means you are pulling it to bit somebody else's design and just working out how it works. And that's exactly what we do and what what science has done with biology. We work out how it works. But actually the the mind that was behind it that created it, we can't understand. We can't understand it from that point of view. And David just said in the Psalms, he said, "I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." That just sums it up. That's that's the way to say it. We can't understand it. Marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. Amen. All right. You know, when you're trying to decipher anything, particularly like from a scientific point of view, you're trying to analyze something, they talk about the five W's and the H. That's the who, what, where, uh when, why, and how. So, you have to go through all those different things and and um we won't go into too much detail, but if you miss out one of those, let's say you miss out the who I could tell you a story. There was uh somebody once and you know they they went to uh maybe he worked for NASA 1969. When 1969, where did he go? He went to the moon. And why did he go? He went for science. He went for because of the space race. How did he get there? He went in a Saturn 5 rocket. The story is not very satisfying, is it? Because you say who? It's just like who. The the who bit is missing. And you have all the other details, but without the who. It could be Neil Armstrong. It could be Buzz Uldren. It could be Michael Collins. But we want the who. And the thing is in science when they're looking at things they analyze everything they it's it's the who that they don't want to talk about. That's right. And if you don't have the who, you don't have the why. Because what's the purpose if you don't know who? See, that's the way it is. So, you know, people want answers. The whole world's looking for answers. They want world peace. What's the answer to world peace? What's the answer to controlling climate change? What's the answer to financial stability and equity? What what's the answer to these things? What's the answer to the cure for all of diseases or the big questions? Where did we come from? Why are we here? And where are we going? But without the who? If you don't know him, none of those questions make any sense. He is the answer to all of those questions. Amen. And we know brother Brennham, he brings out a lot that God is in his word. That's the place that he is determined that we can find him. Amen. We can't comprehend him by uh natural understanding or working him out, but God is in his word. And sometimes we forget that the same word that we're reading, the same word that we're hearing is the word of God that created absolutely everything. He said, "Let there be." And there was let there be light. And there was light. Let there be the sun, the moon, the stars. His His word just spoke that and it made it come to pass. But his word is the it's the same word that he says, I'm going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle. It's the creative power of almighty God. He says, "I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet." It's the same It's the same one. It's the same one doing the speaking. Amen. It has the same creative power. It has the same transforming power. Amen. It changes something from darkness to light. Amen. But you know, when he was alone, I'll just read a scripture here. He says, uh, Hebrews 1:3 says, "Who being in the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power." This is the power of his word, the word of his power. when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. Amen. The purpose of him coming to reveal himself is that by his word is that it might transform us into the image of himself. In fact, that scripture that we read here, if I read on another couple of verses out of Romans, it said, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, that you by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." just saying that's just that's just reasonable. Nothing great there yet. But be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. He wants to change us. He wants to transform us. Even our thinking, he wants to transform just from we think in natural terms. He's no that's not good enough. You have to think in my terms. He's he's he's wanting to raise us up to think as he thinks. Amen. Now, back in the beginning when he was alone with his thoughts, he was thinking. But what was he thinking? Many times, and I don't know, you probably do this. I do this. Even if I wake up in the middle of the night and I've got something that I'm wanting to do, something I'm wanting to build or design, I'll sit there and I'll think and think and think think. And if you go over it in enough detail, you can work something out just by thinking. You haven't actually done anything yet. You haven't gone to your workshop. You haven't picked up any tools, but you've you've thought about it and you worked it out how it works. But you know what? God couldn't do that. He's thinking, but he couldn't do that. The reason he couldn't do that is because he already knows all things. There's nothing he could think about and think, "Oh, I've I've worked out how to make stars now." No, he knew how to make stars, but he was thinking he's infinite. He's omnisient. Means he knows all things. The universe is going to make. Now, science says that the universe is 93 billion light years across. Now, I don't know that they've got that right, but that still sounds big. 93 billion light years. And a lightyear is equivalent to 9 trill 9 trillion kilometers. So every it's a measure of distance rather than time. A year it's how far light travels in a year. Travels 9 trillion kilometers in a year. Then you take that by 93 billion times. That's how big the the universe they say it is. Okay. With all the stars that we talked about before. So that that's how that's how massive this universe is. And he wasn't thinking about that cuz Elohim just like I know how to do that. You know the things are so far away now in the universe that if you traveled at the speed of light you'd never get to them. They're actually moving away from us faster than the speed of light. You there's things that are out of reach, but they're not out of reach to him because the speed of light is not limiting to him. He's watching them, calling them by name. You're okay over there? Long way. He's the master of extremes. He makes big things and he makes minute things. Galaxies and supernovas and nebulas and black holes, the massive things that he makes. But you know to make all those first he had to make electrons and quarks and lips and all the tiny tiny tiny little subatomic particles. In fact an electron is so small that if you if you enlarged it 150 billion times it would be the size of a small grain of rice. How do you make something that small? and everything relies on them. Wow. He is incredible. He is awesome. But he didn't have to think about that. He knew how to do that. What was on his mind was you and me. You and me. Because he couldn't just make us love him. That's right. He couldn't just make us like robots. you will love me. That's He had to give us a choice. He had to give us a choice and say, "I will I will give them my love. I will give them my word. And th those that love me, they will receive my word. They will believe me. They will believe who I send to them with my word." And he couldn't wait. He played the tape forward and he saw these people they love me. These people they responded to my word in 2025 sitting in Teranaki these people and he looked forward and brother Brandham says by his fornowledge he could predestinate he looked forward in time and so that's what they they are it's their decision not my decision it's their decision what they're going to do with my word and he looked forward and he saw what you do you do with his word and he said That's my bride. I chose them. I choose them now. He said we were chosen before the foundation of the world. He looked forward in time. And that's what he was thinking about for billions of years. Perhaps he was enjoying the moment. I'm going to have a bride that loves me, somebody like me, a mutual love relationship. Wow. The Bible says that God is love, but he needed a recipient for his love. Somebody who would receive his love. A one-way love relationship is not a love relationship. It had to be somebody that was going to respond back. That's what he was thinking of. Amen. And the Smyrna church age, brother says, "Watch carefully now and see this. Before there was even a speck of stardust and he was known only as the eternal spirit, the bride was already in his mind. Yes, she was. She existed in his thoughts. And what about those thoughts of God? They are eternal, are they not? God is infinite in his his abil in his abilities. So therefore, he is God must be omnisient. And if he's omnisient, then he then he's not learning. He's not now learning, nor is he taking counsel even with himself. Nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge. He's omnisient. He's never had a new thought about anything. So that's why I'm telling you, he wasn't thinking, "Oh, how am I going to No, he knew because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God. Thus the thoughts of God are eternal. They are real. And in Jeremiah 29:11 it says the Lord speaking says, "For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, sayith the Lord, thoughts of peacemen and not of evil to give you an expected end." What's an expected end? It's called predestination. Predetermined destination is an expected end. He has said before time you're going to be there. And to me it's like that means everything. That means everything. Praise the Lord. So yeah, he couldn't just he couldn't force the choice on us. He had to allow us to have a choice. But now the problem with having a choice, for his bride to have a choice, he had to open up the spectrum of choice that everybody has a choice. Because before he looked forward in time, he wouldn't he didn't know who was going to choose him and who wasn't before he looked. So he opens up the choice. Everybody, you can either choose the Lord or not. And because God is everything that is good and everything that is lovely and everything that is perfect, you don't have a choice until he makes something else which is not perfect and which is not good and which is not lovely and which is not honest. And he says I create evil. I form the light. I create darkness. I make peace and I create I create evil. I the Lord do all these things. People say, why did the Lord let Satan even exist? Why did why did the Lord let Lucifer create him in the first place knowing that he lifted up in pride and he'd become an enemy to God? Why would you create him? I need him. I need him. I need to give them a choice so they can say, "No, I don't want to go that way. I love the Lord. I want to go that way." That's why he had opened it up. So then there's going to be millions of people, billions of people that go the wrong way. He said, "I had to let that happen. I have to let that happen because otherwise they don't have a real free moral agency choice." Amen. And that's why it is the way that it is. All right. Now, in him, Brother Brandham tells us, he had many attributes that he wanted to be displayed. He wanted to be a father. He wanted to be a son. He wanted to be an overcomer so he could be an example to us. He wanted to be a savior. He wanted to be a healer. He wanted to be a comforter, a husband. He wanted to be one of many brethren. He wanted to be a king, the king. He wanted to be a judge. Amen. All those things that were in him, those attributes were in him. They needed the theater of a of a conflict to bring them out. He He couldn't do that in heaven. He had to say, "There has to be a battle." Brother says, "The greatest battle ever fought is in the human mind." He had to have a battle scene where this war could be fought so that there could be an overcomer. How can you overcome if there's nothing to overcome? So that you could have a choice. All these different things. It required this theater of conflict as I said to be that way. But he also said, "I know that man is frail. We're just we we're compassed with infirmity." The Bible says in Psalm 103:13, it says, "Like as a father, he pityth his children. So the Lord pityth them that fear him, for he knoweth our frame, and remembereth that we are dust." H Yeah. You know, he knew from the beginning that um there wasn't actually going to be anybody, nobody on the face of the earth was actually going to be able to be the deliverer. He's going to have to come himself. He's like, "They're all frail. They're all compassed with infirmity." Says, "If they if I make this choice, they're they're going to do wrong. They're going to be born in sin. In fact, it's going to start wrong. So, there's going to have to be somebody come to deliver them." And he says, "And that's going to have to be me." Isaiah 59:16, he says, "And he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore, his arm brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness it sustained him. For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and the helmet of salvation upon his head, and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was claded with zeal as a cloak. According to their deeds, accordingly, he will repay fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. To the islands, he will repay recompense. So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Amen. And that's us, him in us. Amen. So down through time, the Lord has appeared on the scene many different ways. And brother Benham says, uh, it's a drama to him. It's a drama. He said that's the same God all the time just changing his form, amorphe. He just changed it. It's a great drama to him. He's acting it out. Why? He He's He's fulfilling all these attributes that were in him, but he's just playing the part out. And while he's doing that, he's calling his bride. He's calling his people. You know, when he shows up to Abraham as just a dusty traveler, he's like, he'll know it's me. He's just acting apart. That's right. But Abraham says, "My Lord." Why? It was revealed to him. Maybe it was something he said like everybody else was saying, "How are you doing, Abram?" And this dusty traveler comes along and said, "Abraham." Oh, I've come to fulfill my promise for you and Sarah. Sarah. No one calls her Sarah. Something he said quicken. Yeah. Isn't that what happened to us? Something he said quicken and that's why we're here. Amen. All along the way, it's a drama to him. He's playing it out. Wow. But you know, he said the hardest thing that he ever had to do was to get one ma one mortal to believe another. Man is God's agent. And the hardest thing that God ever had to do, you think this is the creator of heaven and earth. He's done some pretty tricky things. We've talked about that. The hardest thing he ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another. When he sends his word, can I really believe him? Can I really believe this prophet that he sent in this day? The bride's going to say, "Yes." Amen. And that's really what faith is. Without faith, it's impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. It's faith in the word of the hour that's all important because we have a gene seed inside of us and that gene seed has to be quickened by something. It can't be quickened by our understanding of the natural world and the phenomena of his creation. It it is amazing and the more you look at I love it. But that doesn't quicken the gene se understanding if we could study psychology and understand how we think and how we work and in the human sense you won't find them. But faith in the word of the hour is what quickens the gene seed. Oh, I believe in Jesus. Yeah. But if they believe in Jesus, they'll receive Jesus the word of the hour. Amen. Because if somebody says they believe in Jesus and reject the message, they don't know him. It's no different than Satan talking to God, but he doesn't know him. Yeah. We need to know him. He's the living God. He's the word for the hour. Amen. And then you know when we accept that that's when the seals are broken to us personally that's when the veil is removed and we really h we we come into communion with him because to to the rest of the world even the Christian world he's still not known they don't even know that he's not three people most of them they think he's three people but he's the one Jehovah God who we know is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And he reveals himself to us. He reveals himself to his elect, the bride. And then there's going to be the 144,000 Jews also. They're going to know him as he really is. Amen. But by his design, revelation is the only way that a mortal can come to know him. Revelation, the revelation of the word for our day. Every other way, we're never ever going to match up to the infinite mind of Almighty God. Now, sometimes we think, you know, we go through battles in our in our daily lives as humans. We feel pretty inadequate most of the time. Um, we're often disappointed and maybe we let the devil even disappoint us and discourage us because of our inability, our our maybe a lack of commitment or whatever it is. Sometimes we just we just feel we don't feel like eternal creatures. We don't feel like kind of his kind. You know what? He designed it that way. So don't be too surprised. He designed it that way. And I'm going to tell you in a little while while Jesus didn't feel any different. Jesus himself felt like you and I feel. He felt just human. Okay. I'm going to have to convince you on that, but we'll see it in a minute. Okay. So, we're limited in our understanding. We're limited. Our cognitive ability is is strictly finite. You know, we can try if we if we might to understand what everlasting life was like. Maybe for Adam, he had everlasting life where every day was just the same. He was not getting older. It was just a paradise. That was great. That's that's everlasting. We can kind of get a little bit of a grasp on that. But eternal terms, we just cannot grasp. God is eternal. He never had a beginning and he never has an end. Can you understand that? Uh we can't think in those terms and he knows we can't think in those terms but that's actually who he is. So he has limited their understanding. Um you know God who is unlimited he he he never has a situation which is too complex for him to understand. Never. He never has a situation where there's too many things happening at once. You know, we don't have to say, "Okay, look, maybe just this half of the church pray and when you're finished, we'll let this half of the church pray just so that doesn't overwhelm the Lord." It's just not so. Everybody can be praying at the same time and he can hear. He you can never you can never over complicate a situation to where he can't understand it. Okay? Because his mind is infinite. But our mind is not infinite and we we've arrived here in an impaired form. You know, when we get to uh if we would come in our theophony form, if we come in a glorified body form, we would never be tempted by sin because you just you just know as God knows. But he says the only way I can let you come here and be tempted and it's actually his word that's being on trial. It's his word that's on trial, not us. That's true. Yeah. We're his workmanship. So, so at the end, he's going to take the credit, not you. He's going to say, "This is my greatest victory, my bride." So, we're his workmanship. That's what he's doing. But he had to put us here with a lack of understanding, a lot lack of comprehension. I was reading in the scripture in Job, I think it's Elhoo, and he talks about the ostrich and he says, he says uh uh God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. Ostrich, it's like he's done a bit of that for us. You know, he's withheld understanding from us. And we can't nut it out. So, so let's not try and do it that way because we'll never find him that way. I remember brother Perry Green talking about brother Brandham he used to reload um hand load shells, rifle shells and he had a set of balance scales and they were so accurate you could put he put a piece of paper on each side of the scales and it would balance and then he took one piece of paper and he drew a pen mark on it and he put that back on the paper and he called that pen mark a scratch. Put it back on the scales and the scales would go down. It was so it was actually weighing the ink on that piece of paper. But I I was just thinking about that thinking our understanding naturally is like that scratch compared to the other side the weight of the entire universe God's understanding cuz he he the universe is just his understanding spoken forth. So so we're never going to we're never going to get them worked out like that. Amen. Um the Bible says about us and our understanding it does not yet appear what we shall be. What we are now is not actually who we are. Beloved, now are we the sons of God. Not we're going to be the sons of God. Now are we the sons of God. But it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him. For we shall see him as he is. We're going to be like him. He's going to say, "Come up, stand by my side. Let's rule and reign together." The Bible says that we are joint ears with Christ. That's that's equal joint ears. Amen. Praise the Lord. Takes a bit of getting our our head around that. Now, when Jesus was here, I said that he felt the same way we do. The Bible says Jesus wept. Brother Ram takes it a step further. He said of all the human emotions that he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one. He wept often. Yet behind that weeping and that sorrow, there was still God. That's right. He didn't feel like He didn't feel like God. He wept as a man. Just the anguish that he went through so many times at some point as he was growing up because he was just born as a baby. He didn't have he didn't have the understanding of Jehovah God as a child. He just was growing up. But at some point, the revelation struck him of who he was. The amnesia of humanity was broken away. And by the time he was 12, he knew. And he was disputing with the scribes and so forth, saying, "But why did David say, you know, whose son whose whose son is, you know, um is the Messiah or whatever?" And they said, "Oh, the son of David." And he said, "Why does David say, "The Lord said unto my Lord, sit there on my right hand until I make thy enemies their foottool. How could he be his son and be his Lord?" And they, "Oh, I don't know. Can't they can't work that out." So, he was he was questioning them about who he was because he knew who he was. But if you think of it like this, one day he had to look out the window and say, "Wow, I made all this. Yeah, that's who I am. Who I am. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. We're part of him. Amen. But the amnesia gets broken away. You start to see actually where we come from, why are we here, and where we're going. The big questions that no one else knows. Praise the Lord. Some point that revelation came to him. But if you had asked him and said, "How did you create everything?" You know what he would have said? I don't know. Just by the spoken word. But I don't know. He would have seemed like an ordinary man to anybody else. The people of that day, brother Adam says, could not comprehend how him being a man could be God. How that an ordinary man without not even a forceful preacher he says the Bible said that his voice was not heard in the streets and there's no beauty that we should desire him. He could not present himself maybe as a minister or as an educated or smart as the smart could. In fact Jesus said the son can do nothing in himself. Son can do nothing in himself. He say I'm just I'm just like a man. But he wasn't. And yet the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in Jesus once he was baptized with John. The fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Jesus and he felt just like a man. You know just out of this if if I was designing this now just this is I'm not trying to be sacriiggious here but just for a moment if a man was born again he'd be a superman. What? Nothing would get in his way. the spirit of almighty God in him. He would feel like a superman. He'd spring. He only need an hour's sleep at night. He would spring out of bed in the morning. He he he is empowered by almighty God. And yet we feel very human that we say, but we know from the word that we're born again of his spirit. What about Jesus? the fullness of the godhead bodily. Now, Peter, James, and John did have a preview of him on Mount Transfiguration, how he actually is, who he actually is, his Raymond Shawn, his face shone. He he was Jehovah God standing there. They had a preview. That's who he is. But most of the time, he had to be a man. Most of the time he had to go to work in a carpenter shop. Most of his life he had three and a half years ministry but up until then he was just a man. Wow. He didn't feel like God. So let's not be too surprised that we feel how we feel. Let's let don't let the devil burden you with that. That's we're just in this realm for a reason. We're limited like the ostrich in our understanding. But the word is where we can come and we can fellowship. We can feel his presence. We can we can get to know him. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham tells us that Jesus, you know, when he was going to go to the woman at the well, and brother Ram tells that story so many times about the woman at the well, but he says Jesus didn't know what her problem was. He said he'd seen a vision that he was to go there and he said, "I have need to go via Samaria." But he said, "But he didn't know." And he's walking that extra way around the hill to get to Samaria thinking I'm going to meet a woman at the well, but I don't know what her problem is. And brother Ram says, "You have to believe me on this." But he says, "But he had to talk to her to catch your spirit to find out what her problem was." And then he says, "Now go and get your husband to come here." And she said, "I got I haven't got a husband." He said, "Yeah, yeah, you've told the truth, but you've had five, and the one you're with now is not yours." See, because he talked to her as a prophet, that that spirit of discernment was there, and he could tell what it was. But beforehand if you asked him why do you need to go and see this talk to this woman he would have had to say I don't know and yet he was the fullness of the godhead bodily limited in that way when he was when he went up to Calvary and he was carrying his cross he didn't have the human strength to carry the cross cross and he collapsed and Simon Serene had to come and carry the cross you think that that's not how you would write the story you know Jesus little man like Samson No, it's not how it was. He gave that strength to somebody, but not to him. He gave that to Samson. Yeah. Amazing, isn't it? Yeah. When he was here, the Bible says that he did uh he did only that which pleased the father. Only that which pleased the father. He deferred his natural thinking to his eternal thinking to the infinite mind. He said, "Not my will but thine be done." You know, he prayed that prayer three times in the garden of of Gethsemane. Lord, if if father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me, but not nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. He said three times. But he he submitted himself to the infinite mind because there's there's a there's a greater purpose than what we can see from a human perspective. Amen. He gave preeminence to the infinite mind. Amen. The Bible says that uh he was tempted in all all points like us and he became an overcomer so that we could he could be an example to us. He had to die to make a way back for us. And then even when he did, he said he gave the keys to the kingdom to another man. It's Peter. And you know, if you're choosing a man to give the keys of the kingdom, too. It wouldn't have been Peter. He denied him. He kept doing the wrong thing. He cuts off somebody's ear. He just seemed to get it wrong all the time. The humanity was the biggest part of the picture. But come the day of Pentecost, he took those keys and he turned them and he said actually Jesus name is the only way. You must be baptized. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And the promise unto you and as many as are coming from now on. Amen. He took those keys. He turned those keys. But as a man, you'd say, "Wow, I couldn't have chosen somebody else." But see, that's why I say it's his workmanship. We are his workmanship. He knows what he's doing. When Jesus died and he rose again, when when he was a man, he didn't know all things. But when he rose again and he went uh into glory, it was revealed to him then all things concerning himself from his eternal self. The eternal part of himself just just to say it like this. We are in three parts as I said before. We have a body, we have a spirit and we have a soul. The soul part is the eternal part of us. Brother Ron says you, the spirit of God, is a quote from him. you the spirit of God, the spirit of God is that is that soul realm. But um in in his humanity, he didn't know. But when he actually heard from that soul realm, which is the eternal part of himself, then he knew all things. I'll read it to you here from Revelation 1:1. It says, "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him." the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his angel unto his servant John. Amen. He's telling us through the book of Revelation through the rest of scripture things that he didn't actually know himself when he was here. He didn't know. They said, "When are you coming again?" He said, "I don't know." He didn't know. That's right. He said, "Only the father knows." That's in the eternal mind. But in my human mind, I don't know. H after his resurrection, he said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth." And brother Brandham says, Jesus said, "All power in heaven and earth is given into my hands." He said, "All power then God is powerless if he's another person." I just love that he's bringing out who this the godhead. He said if if you've got three people, then if all power is given to Jesus, then God's powerless. But if he's the same one, then we have an understanding. Then we get to know him. Amen. God's powerless if he's another person. For the Bible says Jesus said after his resurrection that all power in heaven and earth both was given unto my hand. Amen. And Jesus is now is the all knowing father. That's who he is. That's where he's gone. He said, "I come from God and I return to God." And brother says like this here. He climbs so high into power and glory until he sits in on the father's throne and looks down. There's not even a sparrow can fall to the street without him knowing it. He knows how sick you are. He knows your doubts. He knows your frustrations. We're in a terrible storm, but don't be scared. There's somebody watching. Which one? Which one is watching? He says, "The one that broke the bread. The one that knowed Peter and called him by his name. The one that told the woman of her sins. The one that touched that the woman touched the hem of his garment and told her blood is stopped. The one who perceived the thoughts of the mind. He hasn't laid down in the grave. So you can't see him, but he's climbed into glory and he can see even the sparrow that falls in the street. Amen. So why does it say he sit on his father's throne? And later on it says he's going to sit on his own throne. And brother Ran brings it out. He's sitting on his father's throne. Now he says, "And tonight Christ is not sitting on his own throne. He's sitting on whose throne?" The father's throne. This I think it's important so that we understand who we are in love with. It's important that we understand the deity of Jesus Christ. Amen. He is the one true living God and he wants a bride who is like him to stand by his side. He wants us to know him. Amen. He's sitting on whose throne? The father's throne. and he has overcome and sit down. He said, and then he said, and he that overcomemeth shall sit with me on my throne as I overcame and I'm sitting down on my father's throne. He, brother Random says, uh, I'm trying to do God a service without that as well. His physical being was raised up to the throne of God where the spirit was on the throne. Now Christ is on the throne, Jesus. A little while the world seeth me no more, yet you shall see me, for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. Amen. The throne of God of Christ is erected in your heart. Where is the throne of God that Jesus sits on? The father's throne is in your heart. That's where he is. He says, "A little while the world won't see me anymore, but you'll see me. I'll be with you even in you." That's where he is. But there's coming a time where he's actually going to be in a physical body. He's going to be in a glorified body just like we're going to be. And he's going to sit on his own throne, not not just a spirit. He's here in spirit form now in us. That's the throne that he's sitting on right now. That's why when we pray, pray heavenly father. Brother says, when you say heavenly father, I'll read it to you. He said when you say heavenly father, he said that's Jesus. That's who we're praying to. Amen. Praise the Lord. But there's going to come a time where he's going to sit on his own throne. He's going to be in a glorified body. And he says he's going to be like that forever more. And we're going to be with him in glorified bodies forever more. Amen. You're all with us just a little bit longer. Amen. All right. Uh now he's sitting on his father's throne. In other words, he's getting he's sitting in God's power in spirit now. But when he comes back, he'll be he'll sit in an earthly body. Amen. On David's throne. He's sitting in the majesty of father. Now when we say father, it's Jesus. It's a spirit of God by the Holy Spirit in us. Now he's on the father's throne at the right hand of majesty. And we use the body name Jesus who appeared. The Holy Spirit which is God. Whenever you ask the father anything in my name that I'll do for I and my father are one. Amen. But there's coming a time he says he will return in his body again and he will sit on a literal throne. He says, "A man that will eat and drink and shake hands." Yeah, I love him. A man, that's how he wants to express himself. This Jehovah God who covers all space of all time. He wants to express himself. A man who can eat and drink and shake hands and fellowship with us. Oh my. He said, "You're too emotional, brother." He said, "Why? It makes you emotional. You can't hold yourself when you think of it." Amen. Praise the Lord. That's our God. Amen. Praise the Lord. And now, right now, it's his purpose that he would be and he would live in us. And he wants by his word to be transforming us into his thinking, into his way. Amen. That scripture we just read, be not uh confformed to the world, but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind. The prophet says here in the power of transformation, he says, now we have been saved. Now that we've been saved as we are, there's three parts to this. Listen, now that we've been saved as we are and we've been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have, now we want the mind of Christ to be in us. Amen. You think, well, you know, I've got the I've been saved and I've got the Holy Spirit. I've arrived. He says, no, no. He said he's wanting the mind of Christ now to be in you. He's wanting you to actually start to think as he thinks because now that you're actually saved and now that you're actually filled with the Holy Ghost, he says, "Now I'm saying come up hither and think how I think." Yeah. Yeah. That's what revelation is. Revelation is catching the mind, the infinite mind of God. Yeah. That's what it is. It's a revelation. In fact, I say to you even this on natural things in this life, you think, I don't know what to do. I can't work this out. uh tap in to the infinite mind. Say, Lord, you already know what's the best decision to make here. It it might it might be a big thing like buying a car or getting a job or marrying a wife or husband, whatever. Big things, but what about little things? The Bible says uh pray without ceasing. Do you know that means just just ask me? I'm waiting. Just ask me. Just talk to me about every little thing. Lord, what would you have me do here? What would you have me do here? He's interested. He is vitally interested. And so so many times we can miss the blessing because we're not actually in the right channel. Say, Lord, what would you have me to do? He wants he wants to to to reveal those things to us. That's what revelation is. In Job 32:8, it says, "There is a spirit, but there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." Praise the Lord. The inspiration of the Almighty, the revelation from him, it gives us understanding, understanding in his terms. Amen. And that's what we need. And faith, you know, is accepting the infinite mind on something above our natural thinking. That's what faith really is. He said, he said it. Okay, that settles it. I believe it. Just accept it that way. That's really what faith is. Let the mind, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man. He says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." And the mind that was in Christ Jesus was he didn't think it's robbery to say he's equal with God. He says, "You need to think like that." He said, "What? What are you saying? Are you saying that you're equal with God? That's what he said we are." That's right. So, we might as well say what he said. Joint ears with Christ. So, if we're saying something less than that, who's the influence to try and say less than that? It's not the Holy Spirit. He says, "You need to think how I think." That's right. Let this mind be in you. Praise the Lord. It's a position that he has placed us in. And to say any less is denying the position that he wants his bride to be in. Joint ears with him, sitting with him in his throne. The prophet says, "Oh, if the church only knew its position, it will one day." If the church only knew that position that he's chosen for the bride, but it will one day. I'm so glad he said that bit. Amen. It says we're walking into this where we're close to every day. It will one day and then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. So that should be our goal for everything. That should be our focus. We want to know who he who he has made us and who he is making us. And he's changing our thinking. We are kind of his kind. By his word, we're becoming all that he is because he cannot marry a different species. We have to be kind of his kind. Mrs. Jesus Christ is going to be like him. We have brother Brandham says his very potentials. You know the potentials. It means that if you've got the infinite God and you've got one spoonful of the infinite God, that's infinite. He says, "That's the potentials I've put in you." In fact, I haven't got it here, but brother Ram says, he says, "In you is the potentials." He says, "If the power that's in you is enough that you could speak a world into existence and go and live on it, if there wasn't a law that says you not to do that right now. That's the power that he is vested in his bride. The members of the virgin bride will love him. They will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him." And in the message it's the rising of the sun 1965 he says she is flesh of his flesh. She is bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. Yeah. Husband and wife. Amen. We are the very thoughts, the eternal thoughts of God expressed. Amen. That's the way he was. This is who do you say this is? Just couple more quotes here and we're done. That's the way he was. He was in the beginning by himself. He dwelt alone with his thoughts. He'll never do that again cuz his thoughts are being made manifest. And that's why we're right here this day. God fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifested. Amen. You know Jesus when he came out from God, he was not created. He was expressed. He was begotten. He God didn't, oh I need to have a son. and I will um create one. No, he didn't do that. He was an expression of God himself. He did create a body for him to dwell in out of the dust of the earth. And I think this is important for us to understand too or this is a blessing if we if we get this right. But when he made a body for him out of the earth, so he he he grew in the womb of Mary and she ate food and so forth that was taken from the earth. But what he was doing, he was identifying himself with his own creation. He was becoming a part of his own creation. He didn't create himself. He became part of his creation. And brother Brandham says he did that for a specific purpose that he would redeem the part of creation that was in him. And by doing that, he would redeem the whole earth. Amen. All right. Uh and he says, I'll read it to you so you get it. He said that's why uh death has reigned on the earth ever since the fall. Heaven and earth, beast, atmosphere is all cursed of God because of it. That's the curse because Satan got to it first. But he says Jesus came to redeem it back to the father. In order to do this, he became part of it. He says, uh, and from that very dust, the part that Jesus was himself, being redeemed through him, all the attributes of God are redeemed with the earth. Amen. Praise the Lord. So that's why he did it that way. So he could redeem that. He created the earth. Actually, this is where we're going to live. This is where eternity is going to be. We're going to live with him here on the face of this earth. But he had to come and redeem the very earth. He said, "Only way I can do it, I've got to become part of that earth." And exactly the same for us. We we are not uh created beings, but our bodies are But we're an expressed image of the very thought of God. That's what it is. We're as eternal as God is. Amen. The prophet says just that way. Well, that's who we are. We We need to grasp that. Amen. But our bodies are taken from the dust of the earth. And we've been in a limited form. Sure, we are. But the life quotient that is in us, the eternal life quotient that's in us is none other than the gene seed of God. Amen. And in us right now, there's attributes which you know when Adam first came here, uh he was just just Adam was by himself. And God says, "It's not good for you to be alone." And Adam's like, "Yeah, I know. I'll get that." And he says, "Uh, but the answer to Adam's loneliness was in him." That's right. And he expressed Eve from out the side of him. Amen. The attributes that had previously been in Adam were now in Eve. And I think I've said this here before, but you know when when Eve got a vase and put some flowers in it and Adam went, "That's nice. I never thought of doing that." It was in him, but until it was expressed in Eve, it couldn't be demonstrated. There's things that the Lord is seeing in his bride, he says, "I I long to see this. Yes, I long to see this being manifest because it was in me, but it had to be in female form before it can be expressed. And he's enjoying that. Amen. And for for all eternity, he'll say, "I'm so proud of what you did." That's true. So proud. You know, even the manifestation of the third Paul in this last day, brother Ramon says about the manifestation of the the five manifestations that we had. The whole purpose of that, he said it's going to be used. It's going to be used by the bride. But he said it was manifest to show that the spoken word which was from Jehovah God was actually being made made manifest and demonstrated through a sinner saved by grace. It was no longer just in Jehovah God. It was now in a sinner that was saved by grace. speaking the very words of creation, of control of nature, of all the different things that took place. Amen. That's what it was all about. Praise the Lord. The prophet says, "All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church." That's him. It's Christ in you. He says, "Oh, if I could get the world to see that, there you are. There's the body of Christ living standing redeemed. Redeemed. Oh my." He says, "Justified in his sight. Why are we justified?" He says, "We are his victory." Wow. We are his victory. We are what he was thinking about at the beginning. Oh yes. This is this is the greatest vic. The greatest work that Jehovah God ever has done. Amen. As his bride, he was Calvary was his greatest victory. No, Calvary, he bought something, but what he bought was you. That's right. Yeah. Amen. He saw something, think of this, in you. God saw something in you that you don't see in you. You know the story in Hosea? Hosea wound up buying his wife back. And she was a mess. And he bought her back. But from that time on, she understood something of his love that she didn't understand before. It's like she probably was proud beforehand. Something like that. She might have been fancy looking. She might have thought she was something. But by the time she got to the lowest of the low and that she was being sold as a slave, when he bought her back, he understood something of her love, of his love that she hadn't understood before. God seen something in you that you didn't see in yourself. And he says, "I predestinated you before the foundation of the world to this glorious stand." Amen. He had to redeem her. He had to have her. He would die to achieve it. He predestinated her because he knew that he she would believe him, that she would love him, and she would receive whomsoever he sent. Amen. And that's why he sent his word to transform you and transform me. It's the greatest work. It's his final victory. Amen. Death is swallowed up in victory. That says, the Bible says that's the final victory when death is swallowed up in victory. But when the bride walks out immortal, like him, he'll say, "This is it. This is the final victory. This is my greatest work I've ever done." Amen. And he will rejoice. The Bible says that he will rejoice over you with singing. Can you imagine that? That's what the Bible says. He will rejoice over her with singing. And in Jeremiah 33:16, it says, "In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. This is the name wherewith she shall be called," speaking of the bride, "the lord our righteousness." The Lord Jesus, he will present to himself his virtuous bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. He's so in love with her, with you. He's so proud of you. He can't wait. But he has But he will wait. He looked before time. He because he couldn't wait. He had to look and see. Yep. She's going to be there. Yep. She's all that I wanted. She's all I had in my mind. The final victory. King and queen walk out together in the paradises of God. Amen. Then just two more quotes. Sorry. And uh he says uh this is good len church age. He says then we'll finally comprehend because here we're only comprehending partial understanding. But he says partial realization will be made perfect realization complete realization. We've been looking through a glass darkly but soon it'll be face to face. We've been go going from glory to glory but soon it'll be right in the glory. And in his glory, we'll shine because we shall be like him. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's what I want to be. I want to be all that he said for me to be. Amen. And I trust that it's encouragement to you, too, because don't don't look at the the frailties of the flesh. Don't look at the even the things that the thoughts, oh, you know, it's this is a hard day. He said, yeah, we're going through a storm. This is it's just we we live in the middle of a storm and it's going to get worse on the earth. It's going to get worse. But we're actually living in like a a little I like to think of like an oasis. We've got all that we need. Yeah. We've got we've got all the food we need through the message of the hour. We've got the long range vision to see where we wind up. He he he'll be here right on time. So, we don't have anything to worry about. And even like I said, you know, when we say heavenly father, he says that's Jesus. But he said he knows how sick you are. He knows what you're going through. He knows every detail. But just commit it to him. It's all going to pan out right. Amen. God bless you. Do you know? Do we know that song? Maybe we can stand. The musicians come sing the song. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. Oh, glorious victory. That day he set me free and made my heart as very thrown. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I live to praise his name. But we say who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. I'm a part of my savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Amen. We'll just start to sing this. I'll hand over to brother Mana. Oh, glorious victory. That day he set me free and made my heart his throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I need to praise his name. Amen. [Music] Who are you? I am [Applause] [Music] It's reus [Music] [Applause] the king of heaven. [Music] Heat. Heat.
