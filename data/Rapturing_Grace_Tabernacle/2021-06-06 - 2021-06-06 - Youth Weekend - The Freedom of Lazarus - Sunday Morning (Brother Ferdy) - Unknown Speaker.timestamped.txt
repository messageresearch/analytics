[1:04:07] that
[1:04:07] in heaven we're only going to eat fruits
[1:04:09] and vegetables he wasn't so impressed
[1:04:15] he said he said grandma isn't there
[1:04:16] anyone that can cook proper food
[1:04:18] [Laughter]
[1:04:20] but i'm sure you'll have will enjoy the
[1:04:22] fruit and vegetables i mean
[1:04:24] so i would like to say thank you very
[1:04:26] much to everyone that's here
[1:04:27] um i know that there's many sacrifices
[1:04:30] that were made just even to get here and
[1:04:32] my god really bless you for it
[1:04:34] just want to also take a moment to to
[1:04:36] thank all the different churches
[1:04:38] involved and
[1:04:39] and and families and so forth that is
[1:04:41] putting effort to get here and support
[1:04:43] these
[1:04:44] weekends of of uh just fellowship
[1:04:47] together and
[1:04:47] just appreciate you all just really
[1:04:49] privileged to to have you here
[1:04:52] um the church is kind of back to
[1:04:54] capacity and i
[1:04:56] trust there's enough oxygen and i trust
[1:04:58] is enough
[1:04:59] um space around you but if there isn't i
[1:05:01] just
[1:05:02] trust that that you can make the best of
[1:05:04] it and that that we'll just have a
[1:05:06] joyful time this morning i would also
[1:05:09] say thank you to the to the
[1:05:10] different song items and and just my god
[1:05:13] bless you i also want to just take a
[1:05:15] moment to thank our local church there's
[1:05:17] just so much that's gone into this
[1:05:28] i on just so many fronts
[1:05:32] there's been there's been hard work and
[1:05:34] there's been effort
[1:05:36] and there's still still some of that
[1:05:38] laying ahead but
[1:05:39] but my god just richly bless you thank
[1:05:41] you for all your support and
[1:05:42] contributions and
[1:05:44] and all the organizing and cooking and
[1:05:46] all the things that you
[1:05:48] all that my god just richly bless you
[1:05:49] for that
[1:05:52] i just want to excuse me highlight that
[1:05:55] themed scripture again that we that we
[1:05:57] have for the weekend behold they are
[1:05:58] good and how pleasant it is for brethren
[1:06:00] to dwell together in unity
[1:06:03] you know just recently i i listened to a
[1:06:06] sermon where brother venom
[1:06:07] speaks about the unity of god in his
[1:06:10] church
[1:06:11] and he speaks about how it's god's will
[1:06:13] for us to be in unity
[1:06:15] but not the ecumenical unity not a
[1:06:17] man-made political
[1:06:19] negotiated unity but a unity with god
[1:06:22] and therefore unity with each other
[1:06:23] because we become one with him and
[1:06:25] that's our desire
[1:06:26] it's really a desire that god will break
[1:06:28] down all the
[1:06:30] church barriers and attitude barriers
[1:06:32] and history barriers and whatever
[1:06:33] barriers they are i mean
[1:06:35] if we can all just be truly one that we
[1:06:37] can just
[1:06:38] walk forward and support each other and
[1:06:40] bless each other
[1:06:42] so i don't want to take up too much time
[1:06:43] but just um just one or two logistical
[1:06:47] things
[1:06:47] firstly we've had a number of brothers
[1:06:49] who prefer to visit the sisters toilets
[1:06:52] just because they don't know where the
[1:06:53] brothers toilets are
[1:06:55] so i'll just make sure that everyone
[1:06:57] knows the the
[1:06:58] when you go out the door the brothers
[1:07:00] toilets are on the far end
[1:07:02] so you go as far as you can and turn
[1:07:04] left and they're hiding there around the
[1:07:06] corner
[1:07:07] and then the sisters are just outside
[1:07:09] the door on your left hand side so
[1:07:11] just to make it easier and less
[1:07:13] embarrassing on everyone
[1:07:15] then also i trust the young fellows and
[1:07:17] and ladies remember your socks i've got
[1:07:19] mine on
[1:07:21] good stuff i see some lovely socks
[1:07:24] good work all right just have a little
[1:07:27] bit of fun
[1:07:28] that's good i'm just also a reminder we
[1:07:32] have a potluck at the war memorial hall
[1:07:35] after service so i'll just say again i
[1:07:38] know i
[1:07:39] i said that before but i'll just
[1:07:40] reiterate that our visitors don't have
[1:07:42] to bring anything
[1:07:43] um just bring yourselves and everyone is
[1:07:46] welcome to
[1:07:47] to come so if you don't know where the
[1:07:48] war memorial hall is if you just
[1:07:51] walk down the road next to the church
[1:07:53] here probably i don't know 200 meters
[1:07:55] maybe not even that much and the
[1:07:57] memorial hall will be on your left-hand
[1:07:59] side
[1:08:00] so you're all welcome there but there's
[1:08:03] an exit clause
[1:08:05] you only welcome until three o'clock
[1:08:09] and then only the youth and those
[1:08:11] involved directly are welcome after that
[1:08:14] so uh so please come make yourself at
[1:08:16] home and enjoy yourselves but then we're
[1:08:18] gonna
[1:08:18] just ask you to uh to let us let us
[1:08:21] alone with the youth for a little while
[1:08:23] still
[1:08:26] right so any any questions on that front
[1:08:28] anything that anyone is concerned or
[1:08:30] worried or
[1:08:32] unsure about praise the lord that was
[1:08:34] easier
[1:08:37] so now this morning um we have the
[1:08:40] privilege to have brother ferdi minister
[1:08:41] for us
[1:08:42] and i've never heard him minister so i'm
[1:08:44] really excited this morning
[1:08:46] and i think that makes him maybe a
[1:08:48] little more nervous
[1:08:50] praise the lord but um he's a he's a
[1:08:52] he's an old salt he's ministered heaps
[1:08:55] and he's

[1:21:38] we're going to heaven right
[1:21:40] and i like what one brother said he said

[1:21:55] always asked i said you know we um
[1:21:58] and i don't use the pulpit as humor but
[1:22:00] i always said i wonder
[1:22:01] when we get to heaven is everybody gonna
[1:22:03] have blue eyes and blonde hair and
[1:22:06] you know because we i i'm from south
[1:22:08] africa and uh

[1:22:11] bit backslidden
[1:22:12] you know i never had the straight hair
[1:22:14] and the long hair and
[1:22:16] and i wonder sometimes when i get to
[1:22:17] heaven what kind of hair will i have
[1:22:19] and then brother brandon says well what
[1:22:21] it he says that he says the hair is
[1:22:23] where it was before i had it
[1:22:26] right and i'm thinking man is it going
[1:22:28] to be like that or like that
[1:22:29] or just silly things you think about but

[1:25:52] just a man just to encourage you and
[1:25:55] like i was saying i was
[1:25:56] 12 years old when i got baptized and god
[1:25:59] filled me with the holy ghost when i was
[1:26:00] 18.
[1:26:02] amen and tell you the year
[1:26:05] 1983 then some of you also
[1:26:08] thoughts in the back part of god's mind
[1:26:10] amen 1983 on the 31st of december 1983
[1:26:14] god filled me with the holy ghost and
[1:26:17] that's going back
[1:26:18] many many many many many years
[1:26:21] and it was that one experience that
[1:26:23] changed my life
[1:26:24] i've had many more i want i want to an
[1:26:28] experience with god on a daily basis
[1:26:30] that's what i want but it was that one
[1:26:32] point in my life
[1:26:34] that he turned me around that one point
[1:26:38] i used to go to church i won't tell you
[1:26:41] about all those stories we used to go to
[1:26:42] church we used to go to a certain
[1:26:43] pastor's church back in south africa
[1:26:45] cape town
[1:26:46] and we used to listen to the messages of
[1:26:48] brother branham on a sunday morning
[1:26:51] and then a sunday evening the brother
[1:26:52] the pastor preached a sunday morning
[1:26:54] three-hour tape of brother branham
[1:26:56] sunday evening a three-hour sermon from
[1:26:58] the pastor
[1:27:00] and you growing up as a 12 13 year old
[1:27:02] it was a rough man
[1:27:04] it was rough you know and i always say
[1:27:06] parents
[1:27:07] and i think the worst punishment we as
[1:27:09] parents can give our kids
[1:27:11] is to sit them down and tell them listen
[1:27:12] to that tape and you don't move from
[1:27:14] there
[1:27:15] that's punishment you know and sometimes
[1:27:17] we think we're doing good
[1:27:19] but we're not really doing good we we
[1:27:21] we're developing a hatred inside of that
[1:27:23] kid
[1:27:24] for the message you know we're
[1:27:26] developing within that child
[1:27:28] a resentment to the word but i tell you
[1:27:31] but if you can meet god
[1:27:33] and and i i don't want to tell you what
[1:27:35] happened but i but what i do know i met
[1:27:38] god and he turned my life around
[1:27:41] so as an as i say as an 18 year old i
[1:27:44] started serving god
[1:27:46] i know i was on fire for god and i still
[1:27:48] am
[1:27:49] amen i i didn't care about the sisters
[1:27:53] amen as an 18 year old i didn't care
[1:27:55] about getting married after 18 year old
[1:27:57] i was on fire
[1:27:58] i was serving god i we were all over
[1:28:02] south africa
[1:28:03] man it was me and god and the young
[1:28:05] people
[1:28:06] and i got married when i was 27
[1:28:09] you know but those nine years i served
[1:28:13] god man i'm still serving him
[1:28:15] but as a young man you see this because
[1:28:17] when you married you care about how you
[1:28:19] keep your wife happy
[1:28:20] but as a young person you know it's all
[1:28:23] about you and god
[1:28:26] you know what i mean so don't always
[1:28:27] young people try to get yourself hooked
[1:28:30] and attached you know and a lot of times
[1:28:33] young people think
[1:28:34] when i get myself attached i'm going to
[1:28:36] serve god better no you won't
[1:28:39] if you as a young person can't give god
[1:28:41] your all
[1:28:42] you're not gonna give it to him as a
[1:28:43] married person
[1:28:45] but we for those nine ten years man we
[1:28:47] were all over
[1:28:48] when there was a youth meeting we were
[1:28:50] there amen when there was a youth camp
[1:28:52] in there and
[1:28:53] you know south africa the distances
[1:28:55] between cape town and kimberley a
[1:28:57] thousand kilometers or
[1:28:58] up to johannesburg i think it's 1800
[1:29:00] kilometers or something like that
[1:29:01] you know we traveled weekend not even a
[1:29:03] long weekend
[1:29:05] we'd leave a friday night we'd leave
[1:29:07] after work load a van full of young
[1:29:09] people

[1:29:13] we busy saturday busy sunday after lunch
[1:29:16] back in the vehicle
[1:29:18] drive back to cape town monday work
[1:29:21] that's how we lived because we loved god
[1:29:25] we we we loved to have fellowshipping
[1:29:27] with the sisters also
[1:29:29] but amen it was about god working for
[1:29:32] the kingdom
[1:29:33] achieving something for the kingdom
[1:29:35] being an annoyance in the devil's
[1:29:37] life that's right
[1:29:41] that's what i wanted to be i want to be
[1:29:43] an annoyance to the devil
[1:29:46] i want to be a household name in hell
[1:29:48] that the devil hates

[1:32:14] that's what we do with them we because
[1:32:15] we see the potential in them
[1:32:18] there's something inside of you young

[1:32:24] and you may not see it but we see it and
[1:32:26] we're trying to get it out of you

[1:32:34] be funny but there's something inside
[1:32:37] that needs to come out and i thank god

[1:32:48] introduction and i'll watch my time
[1:32:50] and then i get a test i gotta try and be
[1:32:52] like ua
[1:32:54] amen praise the lord amen 90 what was in
[1:32:56] somebody said 19 minutes and 58 seconds
[1:32:59] last night
[1:33:01] and that's always the hard thing for a
[1:33:02] minister hey i've heard ministers say
[1:33:05] brother you know
[1:33:05] your earlier years we used to ask
[1:33:08] brothers to greet the people brother
[1:33:09] already and they come and they greet the
[1:33:11] people
[1:33:11] and they preach for an hour and you know
[1:33:14] and they say oh no i felt the holy ghost
[1:33:16] on me and i felt inspired come on
[1:33:19] and come on but praise the lord i mean
[1:33:21] it's a little thought this morning and
[1:33:23] if you i'm not gonna pick on titles but
[1:33:25] a little thought i want to speak on you
[1:33:27] god
[1:33:27] help me man the freedom of lazarus
[1:33:32] i want to speak on the freedom of
[1:33:34] lazarus
[1:33:35] and and we know the story and i realize
[1:33:37] as young people and
[1:33:38] you know and we know the story of
[1:33:40] lazarus and we you know we know about
[1:33:42] mary
[1:33:43] and martha and you know and we know
[1:33:45] about lazarus that the bible says
[1:33:48] uh they told jesus lazarus is sick whom
[1:33:50] thou love us
[1:33:52] amen so jesus loved him and he was in
[1:33:54] bethany and
[1:33:55] then let jesus went away when lazarus
[1:33:57] was sick and
[1:33:59] emmanuel jesus was 15 fur longs away
[1:34:02] and i sort of googled it and thank god
[1:34:04] for google as i reckon they say about
[1:34:06] three kilometers away or something like
[1:34:07] that
[1:34:08] and uh you know and and so you've got
[1:34:11] mary and martha
[1:34:12] and and how that jesus came after four
[1:34:15] days i think it was or
[1:34:17] and martha's visitation says lord if
[1:34:20] thou had been here my brother would not
[1:34:21] have died and
[1:34:22] you know and so on you know we know the
[1:34:24] story and uh
[1:34:26] and then martha sort of says lord i
[1:34:28] believe in verse 27 of the chapter we
[1:34:31] read
[1:34:32] and then verse 28 she goes to call mary
[1:34:34] and
[1:34:35] mary tells mary sister the master has
[1:34:37] come and calleth thee and
[1:34:39] you know so you've you've got all these
[1:34:41] characters
[1:34:42] and that that's to play and and so when
[1:34:45] you look at
[1:34:46] and then you've got you've got the
[1:34:47] mourners in john 11 19
[1:34:49] they had their place amen and
[1:34:52] you've got lazarus you've got the people
[1:34:55] that rolled the stone away
[1:34:57] you've got the people that took off the
[1:34:59] grave clothes and and and i always and i
[1:35:02] wrote down you and i said the freedom of
[1:35:04] lazarus
[1:35:05] was a strategic military maneuver
[1:35:09] big words i know right and that's the
[1:35:11] biggest i'm going to get for that
[1:35:13] the words right if you think about it
[1:35:15] because everybody says well lazarus was
[1:35:17] raised from the dead and they'd
[1:35:18] lazarus the grave but if you look at
[1:35:20] that chapter
[1:35:22] you'll find there were the mourners
[1:35:24] there were the professional mourners
[1:35:26] there were people that had to roll the
[1:35:28] stone away there were people that had to
[1:35:30] take the grave clothes off
[1:35:32] there was mary there was martha there
[1:35:35] was jesus
[1:35:36] this whole group of people just to get
[1:35:40] lazarus free
[1:35:42] and that's why this morning we we're
[1:35:44] going to talk about the freedom of
[1:35:46] lazarus
[1:35:47] and you may say brother why freedom
[1:35:52] why not the resurrection of lazarus
[1:35:56] but you see jesus said in john 5 24
[1:36:00] he that heareth my word i'm telling you
[1:36:03] i'm not
[1:36:03] why i didn't call it resurrection he
[1:36:06] that heareth my word
[1:36:08] he that believeth on him that sent me
[1:36:11] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:36:14] into condemnation
[1:36:16] but is past from death and to life
[1:36:20] so here jesus tells him roll the stone
[1:36:22] away you know the story
[1:36:24] and he says lazarus come forth and
[1:36:27] lazarus raised out of the grave
[1:36:29] but when he came out of the grave he was
[1:36:33] alive but he wasn't free
[1:36:37] am i right because he had the grave
[1:36:40] clothes around him
[1:36:42] and so yes he had been resurrected but
[1:36:45] he came out and if you google it
[1:36:47] wrapped in glare grave clothes and if
[1:36:49] they had left
[1:36:50] him in grave clothes can you imagine the
[1:36:54] quality of
[1:36:55] life he would have had because he would
[1:36:58] have been going hopping all over the
[1:37:00] place
[1:37:00] wrapped in grave clothes and he would
[1:37:02] spend his life like that
[1:37:04] and so here we are this morning
[1:37:08] brother if jesus if you are a christian
[1:37:12] if you've be if you've repented and
[1:37:15] you've given your heart to the lord
[1:37:17] you have eternal life
[1:37:20] so if you drop dead now and no one is
[1:37:24] here anointed to pray for you back to
[1:37:26] life
[1:37:26] you're going straight into the arms of
[1:37:28] the lord
[1:37:30] full stop because you have eternal life
[1:37:35] and one or two people believe that the
[1:37:37] rest of the young people are yes let's
[1:37:38] try that again young people do you
[1:37:39] believe you have eternal life
[1:37:42] do you believe you have eternal life all
[1:37:44] right do you guys believe you have
[1:37:46] eternal life
[1:37:47] do you believe you have eternal life
[1:37:49] praise the lord
[1:37:50] so if you agree with me now and then a
[1:37:52] little amen
[1:37:55] this is your service right young people
[1:37:57] they put you right in front
[1:37:59] i would have loved brother andy because
[1:38:01] i know andy would
[1:38:02] you know what i mean but they put you
[1:38:04] young people right in front so if you
[1:38:06] agree with what i say
[1:38:08] no wink at me give me a thumbs up
[1:38:11] give me a smile nod your head no don't
[1:38:14] nod your head
[1:38:14] say amen brother but you're not aiming
[1:38:17] further you're aiming in the word
[1:38:19] all right so here was lazarus
[1:38:22] lazarus come forth and yet he came
[1:38:25] hopping out
[1:38:26] if jesus had left him like that
[1:38:30] imagine what kind of life he would have
[1:38:31] lived that's why we're saying
[1:38:34] we are not talking this morning on the
[1:38:37] resurrection of lazarus
[1:38:39] we are speaking on the freedom of
[1:38:42] lazarus
[1:38:43] because right now every one of you young
[1:38:46] people
[1:38:46] you are you are have passed from death
[1:38:50] and to life
[1:38:53] that's why you're here you're a
[1:38:55] christian
[1:38:56] you have eternal life if you drop dead
[1:38:59] you go to heaven
[1:39:00] we believe that but the question we have
[1:39:04] this morning is
[1:39:05] are you free
[1:39:10] yes brother i have eternal life
[1:39:13] but my question is do you have the
[1:39:16] freedom
[1:39:19] oh are you young people still hopping in
[1:39:21] grave clothes
[1:39:24] sunday morning you come to church

[1:39:36] around me brother i can't say no to the
[1:39:38] world i've got the grave clothes around
[1:39:40] me
[1:39:41] brother i can't i can't sing for god
[1:39:43] i've got grave clothes around me
[1:39:46] and that's why we're talking about the
[1:39:48] freedom
[1:39:51] the freedom of lazarus
[1:39:56] amen amen that's what a man
[1:39:59] and so this morning my question is

[1:46:04] nonsense
[1:46:06] who said listen i've grown up in the
[1:46:08] message right and i've heard so many
[1:46:10] brothers say
[1:46:11] when they talk about pentecost that's
[1:46:13] flesh
[1:46:14] how pentecost is flesh pentecost is
[1:46:16] emotion brother branham said we
[1:46:18] shouldn't have emotion
[1:46:19] brother branham said what
[1:46:23] problem said a church without emotion is
[1:46:25] dead
[1:46:27] no we're not pushing emotion like the
[1:46:28] pentecostals that shout shout shout and
[1:46:31] no word
[1:46:32] we we lay down the word and the
[1:46:35] anointing comes on the word
[1:46:38] that's what we do so we say word first
[1:46:42] so we are word fed
[1:46:45] what's the other part spirit spirit lead
[1:46:48] that's what we are but brother brown
[1:46:50] says a church without emotion is dead
[1:46:54] in the olden days when the baby was born
[1:46:56] him in the modern way they don't do it
[1:46:57] anymore olden days babies born
[1:46:59] they take the baby slap the baby on the
[1:47:01] bottom and the baby shouts
[1:47:03] that's baby's alive that baby's not
[1:47:06] stillborn apparently you're not supposed

[1:47:18] is
[1:47:19] but nowadays we say and you see what we
[1:47:21] do
[1:47:22] so we we present to the believers no
[1:47:25] emotion
[1:47:26] but then we present to the believers
[1:47:28] wildfire
[1:47:29] but we as believers we take that we take
[1:47:32] that
[1:47:32] we bring it to the middle of the road
[1:47:35] and we live a life
[1:47:37] a happy life i'm a happy christian

[1:54:29] this morning young people the life in
[1:54:31] the flesh
[1:54:32] now when we say flesh paul didn't say
[1:54:35] all foolishness
[1:54:36] paul was saying the natural life that i
[1:54:39] love
[1:54:39] he says what's the quality of that life
[1:54:42] is the world pulling you
[1:54:44] or is jesus pulling you what's the
[1:54:46] quality of
[1:54:47] what are you struggling with this
[1:54:49] morning
[1:54:52] what is hindering your quality of life
[1:54:55] today young people
[1:54:58] jesus said lose him and let him go
[1:55:02] yes he had eternal life yes he was just
[1:55:05] come from the dead
[1:55:07] yes you have eternal life but what's the
[1:55:09] quality of your life
[1:55:12] i was listening to that sister's
[1:55:13] testimony last i don't know where she is
[1:55:15] man she said when she was blindsided by
[1:55:17] that truck driver said man that happens
[1:55:19] huh
[1:55:20] that happens but you know he just wiped
[1:55:21] the dust off you and i always say
[1:55:24] i always this is what i say i said when
[1:55:25] i if i don't know
[1:55:27] something and i have to ask someone once
[1:55:30] i will make sure that i go and learn it
[1:55:33] but i will never ask again
[1:55:35] other than in church with some of the
[1:55:36] stuff these kids do with social media
[1:55:39] but i work because i work in the it
[1:55:40] industry right
[1:55:42] if i have to ask someone something i'll
[1:55:44] ask you once
[1:55:45] but i will make it my business never to
[1:55:48] have to ask you the same thing twice
[1:55:50] so i will go away and i'll go learn it
[1:55:53] and that's what we say so i'm saying if
[1:55:55] you are bound
[1:55:56] you can go free

[1:56:08] people so tossed about
[1:56:10] i'm going to read this for you he says
[1:56:13] the justified man
[1:56:16] oh that's the saved man he says the
[1:56:19] justified man
[1:56:21] he walks by daylight you know how we
[1:56:24] talk about the courts the
[1:56:25] outer court inner court holies of holies
[1:56:27] we're not going to go there and teach
[1:56:28] that
[1:56:29] we'll leave that he says the justified
[1:56:33] man now he's not talking about a sinner
[1:56:36] he said brother i've got so many dramas
[1:56:38] in my life
[1:56:39] but i thought i gave my heart to the
[1:56:41] lord no you did
[1:56:44] you did it's normal it's normal for
[1:56:47] pressures
[1:56:48] young people it's normal it's normal
[1:56:51] when the devil flies over
[1:56:52] and it drops a little thought in your
[1:56:54] head don't let him make a nest
[1:56:58] it's normal i want by the grace of god
[1:57:02] i want to normalize your christian work
[1:57:07] because we put christianity up now that
[1:57:09] we have to strive for that
[1:57:11] but i want to normalize christianity
[1:57:15] i know we are striving to be like jesus
[1:57:18] i know we are striving to attain
[1:57:20] specific goals in christ

[2:52:32] brother branham he makes a statement

[2:52:37] holy ghost keeps you saved
[2:52:39] amen he keeps us safe he keeps us every

[2:52:43] i just appreciate how
[2:52:46] the the i don't want to say the message
[2:52:49] but
[2:52:50] how us in the message i'm maturing by
[2:52:52] god's grace
[2:52:54] amen you know we i i grew up with this
[2:52:57] idea that you know no one in the message
[2:52:59] ever gets divorced no one in the message
[2:53:01] goes through real hard times no one in
[2:53:02] the messy
[2:53:03] message will you know die of sickness
[2:53:05] none of that kind of stuff
[2:53:07] but the reality is we're living the same
[2:53:09] lives as everyone else
[2:53:11] and it's and and if we if we create a
[2:53:14] false impression then we make it
[2:53:16] impossible to reach
[2:53:20] now is god a healer amen is god
[2:53:24] our peace amen is god our shepherd amen
[2:53:27] and and he wants to manifest those
[2:53:28] attributes to us
[2:53:30] but while we're living those things god
[2:53:32] allows things i was reading again this
[2:53:34] week where
[2:53:34] brother and just make statements about
[2:53:36] he says it pleases god it
[2:53:39] has put us through hardships it pleases
[2:53:41] god to allow his trials to come
[2:53:42] why because he needs to beat the gold so
[2:53:45] he can see himself in it
[2:53:47] i mean it's for our purpose for our
[2:53:49] benefit
[2:53:51] even brother andy will you close fasting
