[1:08:38] [Laughter]
[1:08:41] amen so yeah it was a bit awkward
[1:08:44] but we made it awkward for ourselves
[1:08:47] because we had all these thoughts before
[1:08:49] we even met
[1:08:51] and then it was such an anti-climax when
[1:08:53] we met the thing man this is just my
[1:08:55] brother here
[1:08:56] [Laughter]
[1:08:59] amen and brother Daniel is a bit naughty
[1:09:02] because he made us share
[1:09:05] I think it was the The Chalet that we
[1:09:08] were sharing so he had this bedroom
[1:09:09] there I had my bedroom there and then we
[1:09:12] have to share the lounge area I'm
[1:09:14] thinking okay this is interesting
[1:09:19] but anyway God is good amen it makes it
[1:09:23] all beautiful when you meet and you
[1:09:24] relate and you know you just you just
[1:09:27] love what God does Amen so I'm happy to

[1:09:37] invited him over we had such a
[1:09:38] tremendous time spent the weekend with
[1:09:40] him wonderful fellowship and the Word
[1:09:43] was wonderful we're still talking about
[1:09:45] it and still feasting from it so that
[1:09:49] was good amen happy also to see brother
[1:09:52] Moses I think I was trying to calculate
[1:09:55] it could probably be 20 years
[1:09:58] since we last seen each other yeah it's
[1:10:01] very strange yeah it's probably close to
[1:10:04] 20 years since we last seen each other
[1:10:06] and your wife but she hasn't changed
[1:10:08] much
[1:10:12] I'm sure the sister will enjoyed that
[1:10:14] comment
[1:10:17] so happy to see you happy to see you my
[1:10:20] brother it's the doings of God Amen we
[1:10:24] were young men then never thought of
[1:10:26] being past as especially this part of
[1:10:28] the world but God had the path all
[1:10:31] worked out and now we bump into each
[1:10:33] other here in New Zealand uh in the
[1:10:36] taranak region that's that's a bit
[1:10:38] strange
[1:10:39] but God is good
[1:10:41] amen praise the Lord I want to also
[1:10:44] great brother Alpha we've kind of
[1:10:45] communicated on the phone but I had not
[1:10:48] met in person I'm trying to look around
[1:10:51] and see familiar faces but uh I think we
[1:10:54] all know each other in one way or
[1:10:55] another amen but I want to salute you
[1:10:58] all the Elders of this church the pastor
[1:11:00] appreciate the invitation and the work
[1:11:03] that has gone on over the years here and
[1:11:05] you can see how God is with you and you
[1:11:08] are still standing in the faith so you
[1:11:11] really want to appreciate that amen want
[1:11:13] to also appreciate my brother in love
[1:11:15] with my sister in love brother Morgan
[1:11:17] and sister patients that have been
[1:11:19] tremendous host for me we took the long
[1:11:22] drive down from Auckland I didn't want
[1:11:24] to fly it's my first time in New Zealand
[1:11:26] so I really wanted to really experience
[1:11:28] New Zealand so it was a long drive for
[1:11:31] brother Morgan but I enjoyed myself
[1:11:35] just to enjoy the scenery take it all in
[1:11:38] and when I was coming everybody in Perth
[1:11:41] was like man this is the bad time to
[1:11:43] visit New Zealand right now
[1:11:45] but I was willing to take the risk amen
[1:11:48] and just to be able to come and meet
[1:11:49] with you brother so we thank the Lord
[1:11:52] for that the church sends the greetings
[1:11:54] I did ask and say how many of you want
[1:11:57] me to take greetings to New Zealand and
[1:11:59] everyone lifted their hands so I'm not
[1:12:02] just being diplomatic and saying things
[1:12:05] but the church said their greetings A
[1:12:08] man also greetings from my precious wife
[1:12:10] I'm married with the two children my
[1:12:13] daughter the oldest daughter is turning
[1:12:15] nine in July my young boy is turning
[1:12:18] three in May amen so I've got a young
[1:12:21] pretty young family and so yeah like
[1:12:25] brother every said I've been this
[1:12:28] December will be nine years in Australia
[1:12:30] and I'm sure everyone is trying to
[1:12:32] calculate and
[1:12:33] try and place my age
[1:12:38] praise the Lord
[1:12:40] I I turned 40 last September
[1:12:43] to save you the calculations
[1:12:46] amen so I I actually initially relocated
[1:12:50] to Western Australia to do work I'm an
[1:12:54] Auto Electrician by trade
[1:12:56] Sparky Auto Sparky by trade so when I
[1:12:59] relocated to Australia that was what I
[1:13:03] had to do to provide a living for the
[1:13:04] family and I got involved in the
[1:13:06] ministry laboring under brother Claude
[1:13:09] Porter some of you Old-Timers surely
[1:13:11] definitely still remember him and so I
[1:13:15] labored with him a while and the Lord
[1:13:17] took him home and the responsibility
[1:13:20] fell upon me and I was elected and
[1:13:23] ordained in June 2019 to be pastor of
[1:13:27] Spoken Word Fellowship in Perth
[1:13:30] in terms of numbers very difficult to
[1:13:32] say we we are mining mining State flying
[1:13:36] fly out probably we're talking about 80
[1:13:40] 80 100 people somewhere there the
[1:13:43] numbers fluctuate because people do fly
[1:13:46] and fly out but on a Sunday probably on
[1:13:49] a whale hasn't attended Sunday we are
[1:13:51] more like what you are here right now so
[1:13:53] God is giving us Grace we've got over 10
[1:13:56] nationalities in the church so we we are
[1:13:59] the United Nations
[1:14:01] [Laughter]
[1:14:03] from across the world Amen from the
[1:14:07] islands from the Asia Pacific from
[1:14:09] Africa from Europe New Zealand and
[1:14:12] obviously Australia so yeah but God has
[1:14:15] been good to us amen we speak one
[1:14:18] language that's the word of God one
[1:14:21] culture Christian culture amen and so
[1:14:24] that's what we try and do and God has
[1:14:25] been gracious it's been wonderful so I
[1:14:28] guess I've introduced myself now we can
[1:14:30] get to the word amen praise the Lord if
[1:14:33] we could stand on our feet for a
[1:14:34] scripture reading
[1:14:36] praise God
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:45] so we read from the book of Joshua the
[1:14:48] Book of Joshua chapter 2.
[1:14:50] the Book of Joshua chapter 2.
[1:14:54] I had some personal greetings from
[1:14:57] Brother Kuda brother Kuda knows quite a
[1:15:00] few of you here he called me just before
[1:15:02] I took off and he said man I know a lot
[1:15:04] of people that make sure you do greet
[1:15:07] them for me amen so I bring those
[1:15:10] greetings from Brother Kuda and I'm
[1:15:13] trying to remember somebody else who
[1:15:15] also sent personal greetings is the
[1:15:18] wrong time to try and remember things
[1:15:19] when you're buying the puppet about to
[1:15:21] preach but you know some people that you
[1:15:23] know they sent their greetings
[1:15:26] [Laughter]
[1:15:29] praise the Lord amen Joshua chapter 2
[1:15:32] start from verse 1.
[1:15:38] the Bible reads
[1:15:40] and Joshua the son of man sent out of
[1:15:43] two men to spy secretly
[1:15:46] saying go view the land even Jericho and
[1:15:50] they went and came into in Harold's
[1:15:52] house named Rahab and lodged there and
[1:15:55] it was told the king of Jericho saying
[1:15:58] behold there came men in hither tonight
[1:16:02] of the children of Israel to set out the
[1:16:05] country
[1:16:06] and the king of Jericho sent out sent
[1:16:09] Andrew saying bring forth the men that
[1:16:12] have come to thee which are entered into
[1:16:15] thine house for they become to search
[1:16:18] all the country
[1:16:20] and the woman took the two men and hit
[1:16:23] them and said thus they came men unto me
[1:16:26] but I wish not once they were and it
[1:16:30] came to pass about the time of the
[1:16:31] shutting of the gate when it was dark
[1:16:33] that the men went out whether the men
[1:16:36] went I what not pursue after them
[1:16:40] quickly for you shall overtake them
[1:16:43] but she's she had brought them up to the
[1:16:46] roof of the house and hit them with the
[1:16:48] stocks of flags when she had laid in
[1:16:51] order upon the roof and the men pursued
[1:16:54] after them the way of Jordan unto the
[1:16:56] Forts and as soon as they which pursued
[1:16:59] after them were gone out they shut the
[1:17:02] gate and before they were laid down she
[1:17:04] came up unto them up on the roof and she
[1:17:07] said unto the man I know that the Lord
[1:17:10] had given you the land and that your
[1:17:12] terror is falling upon us and that all
[1:17:15] the inhabitants of the land faint
[1:17:17] because of you for we have heard how the
[1:17:20] Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea
[1:17:22] for you when he came out of Egypt and
[1:17:26] what he did unto the two kings of the
[1:17:28] amorites that were in the other side of
[1:17:30] Jordan other side Jordan cehan and OG
[1:17:34] which he utterly destroyed and as soon
[1:17:37] as we had heard these things our hearts
[1:17:40] did melt neither did there remain any
[1:17:43] more courage in any man because of you
[1:17:46] for the Lord your God he is God in
[1:17:49] heaven above and in the earth beneath
[1:17:51] now therefore I pray you sway unto me by
[1:17:55] the Lord since I have showed you
[1:17:57] kindness that he will also show kindness
[1:18:00] unto my father's house and give me a
[1:18:04] true talking
[1:18:06] and that you save alive my father and my
[1:18:09] mother and my brethren and my sisters
[1:18:11] and all they have and deliver our lives
[1:18:15] from death and the men answered her our
[1:18:18] life for yours if he utter not this our
[1:18:21] business and it shall be when the Lord
[1:18:23] had given us the land that we will deal
[1:18:26] kindly and truly with thee then she let
[1:18:30] down by the cord through the window for
[1:18:33] a house was upon the town wall and she
[1:18:36] dwelt upon the wall and she said unto
[1:18:39] them get you to the mountain lest the
[1:18:42] pursuers meet you and hide yourselves
[1:18:43] there three days until the pursue has
[1:18:46] been retained and afterward may he go
[1:18:49] your way may the Lord blessing to the
[1:18:52] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:18:54] Saints
[1:18:57] praise the Lord
[1:18:58] and so tonight
[1:19:00] not tonight this morning we have we have
[1:19:05] an evening and a late afternoon service
[1:19:07] on Sundays
[1:19:09] so here I see you're privilege to have
[1:19:12] it on a Sunday morning that's great so
[1:19:14] this morning I would like to speak on
[1:19:16] rahab's true token
[1:19:18] rahabs true talking amen and we read
[1:19:22] there in the scripture
[1:19:24] that rehab was just an ordinary woman in
[1:19:27] the in the city
[1:19:28] but somehow it was very clear to her
[1:19:31] what the god of Israel was going to do
[1:19:35] it was very clear to Rahab that the god
[1:19:38] of Israel had pronounced judgment upon
[1:19:41] Jericho and she had no doubt that
[1:19:44] Jericho was under judgment and it was
[1:19:47] just a matter of time before judgment
[1:19:50] rested on Jericho and everything else
[1:19:53] was going to be destroyed and she knew
[1:19:56] that if she found a way she could appeal
[1:20:00] to the messages and The Messengers would
[1:20:02] be able to put in word for her so that
[1:20:05] she herself and their family could be
[1:20:08] saved amen and if we go to the
[1:20:12] scriptures if we can continue with a
[1:20:15] little bit of scripture reading we go to
[1:20:17] the book of Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews
[1:20:20] chapter 10 verse 30.
[1:20:23] so we find a relatively common woman
[1:20:28] in Jericho and yet you find she's
[1:20:32] mentioned several times in the
[1:20:34] scriptures
[1:20:35] amen she's one of the individuals that
[1:20:39] you find in the Bible who has a very
[1:20:41] strange nickname or reference amen she's
[1:20:45] referred to as Rahab the halot and so I
[1:20:49] hope you do not be offensive to any as
[1:20:51] we are just repeating what the Bible
[1:20:53] States about her
[1:20:55] amen so it's a very strange uh situation
[1:21:00] that you have a woman whose even past
[1:21:03] life is referred to and there's nothing
[1:21:05] glorious about your past life and yet
[1:21:08] she features several times in the
[1:21:11] scriptures
[1:21:12] so if she even features she's one of the
[1:21:15] two women that appear in the great
[1:21:18] Heroes of the faith chapter Hebrews
[1:21:21] chapter 11. it's only rehab and Sarah of
[1:21:26] all the mighty women in the scriptures
[1:21:30] in the Hall of Fame in Hebrews chapter
[1:21:32] 11. amen and it says yeah Hebrews 11
[1:21:35] verse 30 the Bible reads by faith the
[1:21:39] woes of Jericho fell down after they
[1:21:41] were compassed about seven days
[1:21:43] by faith the hallowed Rahab perished not
[1:21:47] with them that believed not when she had
[1:21:51] received the spies with peace and what I
[1:21:55] shall I must say for the time would fail
[1:21:58] me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and
[1:22:00] of Samson and of jephthah of David also
[1:22:04] in Samuel and of the prophets who
[1:22:07] through faith subdued kingdoms wrote
[1:22:11] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[1:22:15] the mouths of lions quenched the
[1:22:18] violence of fire escaped the age of the
[1:22:21] sword out of weakness were made strong
[1:22:24] Works Valiant in fight tend to flight
[1:22:28] the armies of aliens
[1:22:30] so even in the great faith chapter
[1:22:32] Hebrews chapter 11 Rahab appears amen
[1:22:36] and she gets even her own space but the
[1:22:40] others like David like Barack like
[1:22:42] Samson they are referred to if only we
[1:22:45] had time
[1:22:46] we could have talked about this Mighty
[1:22:48] Men but Rahab has their own portion
[1:22:51] he has their own sentences their own
[1:22:53] verse but great men like David did
[1:22:56] Barack and Samson if only with time we
[1:23:00] would have talked about them
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:03] so she occupies a very important place
[1:23:05] in Scripture
[1:23:07] let's go to the Book of James chapter 2.
[1:23:11] praise the Lord James chapter 2. and we
[1:23:14] start from verse 21.
[1:23:25] so I always say I try and wait as long
[1:23:28] as I hear Bible Pages flipping I try and
[1:23:30] wait for people
[1:23:31] I don't want to tempt people to just
[1:23:33] open a page and just
[1:23:35] wait there as if they are reading
[1:23:38] because they are too embarrassed to keep
[1:23:40] searching
[1:23:42] so I try and give it a bit more time
[1:23:46] um so I'm sure where most of us are
[1:23:47] there James chapter 2 verse 21 the Bible
[1:23:50] reads
[1:23:52] was not Abraham Our Father justified by
[1:23:55] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[1:23:59] upon the altar
[1:24:00] says Thou how Faith wrote with his works
[1:24:04] and by works was Faith made perfect
[1:24:07] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:24:09] said Abraham believed God and it was
[1:24:12] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:24:15] he was called the friend of God you see
[1:24:18] then how that by works and Men is
[1:24:20] Justified and not by faith only
[1:24:23] likewise also was not rehab the hallowed
[1:24:27] justified by works when she had received
[1:24:30] the messages and had sent them out
[1:24:33] another way
[1:24:34] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:24:37] dead so faith without works is dead also
[1:24:42] James in referring to Faith
[1:24:46] goes to the father of our faith Abraham
[1:24:51] and talks about his faith and we all
[1:24:53] know that the prophet says James is not
[1:24:56] contradicting any portion of scripture
[1:24:58] by talking about works but he's talking
[1:25:01] about what man sees
[1:25:03] the prophet says God sees our faith but
[1:25:06] men see our works and for a Christian
[1:25:09] people have to see the works of your
[1:25:12] faith so there's no contradiction there
[1:25:15] so he goes to the father of our faith
[1:25:17] Abraham and shows us that Abraham had
[1:25:21] the faith that God could see and also
[1:25:24] the faith that men could see
[1:25:26] amen and immediately after referring to
[1:25:30] the faith of Abraham of all the
[1:25:33] characters in The Bible he picks way up
[1:25:36] the halot and goes and mentions your
[1:25:38] faith also
[1:25:40] amen so the one thing that is
[1:25:43] outstanding about Rahab from the
[1:25:45] portions of scriptures that we have read
[1:25:47] the one thing that makes Rahab stand out
[1:25:51] over a lot of the women and a lot of the
[1:25:54] Mighty Warriors of God of our faith in
[1:25:57] the Bible was their faith
[1:26:00] rehab was a halot rehab was an ordinary
[1:26:03] woman in the city Rahab had no
[1:26:06] reputation rehab was just like any other
[1:26:10] Gentile but there is one thing that
[1:26:12] distinguished Rahab from everybody else
[1:26:15] that was in Jericho it was a faith
[1:26:19] praise the Lord and it was a faith that
[1:26:23] revealed to her that she could get a
[1:26:26] token
[1:26:28] the one thing that made it believe was
[1:26:31] the faith that was already in him though
[1:26:34] she did not know much though she did not
[1:26:37] understand the Mysteries and could not
[1:26:40] put the verses and the quotes together
[1:26:42] but somehow in a heart she understood
[1:26:46] that she could ask for a token
[1:26:50] amen and so there's a few places where
[1:26:53] the Prophet starts to drop certain
[1:26:55] things about this story that is in the
[1:26:58] Book of Joshua chapter 2 about the story
[1:27:01] of Rahab where the Prophet shows us that
[1:27:04] that is actually a very important story
[1:27:07] for the Gentile bride in the end time
[1:27:11] amen so it's not just some old story yes
[1:27:15] it's a reality this happened but it
[1:27:17] happened and it was a type of what God
[1:27:20] has done for the gentle bride in the end
[1:27:22] time
[1:27:23] and in the message as I was with Moses
[1:27:26] uh the prophet okay so I've got a
[1:27:30] picture there just to illustrate what
[1:27:32] actually happened so I'm not saying this
[1:27:34] was exactly what happened but it's just
[1:27:36] an illustration and so we see that she
[1:27:40] put uh uh the Scarlet thread down a
[1:27:43] window and the war everywhere else is
[1:27:47] crumbling down and the Levites are
[1:27:50] sounding the seven
[1:27:52] remhons and the circle the city seven
[1:27:55] times and then when the circle is seven
[1:27:58] times they sound the seven remones amen
[1:28:03] and we know that the realm is a male
[1:28:05] amen is easy it is a lamp that has grown
[1:28:08] to adulthood amen and so that in itself
[1:28:11] is very significant and the number of
[1:28:14] the horns is very significant to us who
[1:28:16] believe the message and know about God's
[1:28:18] Messengers amen and the shout that has
[1:28:21] been given amen and so when they sound
[1:28:24] it and they give the shout of Victory
[1:28:26] they then the woes come down and the
[1:28:29] walls crumble everywhere else apart from
[1:28:32] the house of Rahab who had put the
[1:28:36] Scarlet thread hanging down a window
[1:28:38] under the instructions of Messengers who
[1:28:42] were working under the Joshua Commission
[1:28:45] praise the Lord so it was The Messengers
[1:28:48] that were working under Joshua
[1:28:49] commission when the great prophet Moses
[1:28:52] had left the scene and these men were
[1:28:55] sent under the Joshua commission and
[1:28:57] they gave the instruction on how to
[1:29:00] apply the token and she followed their
[1:29:03] instruction on applying the token did
[1:29:05] exactly what they had said and God
[1:29:08] honored the word of The Messengers that
[1:29:11] ministered under the Joshua commission
[1:29:13] and the war did not crumble
[1:29:16] amen and so the war is very significant
[1:29:19] if you noticed in the scripture that we
[1:29:22] read it's actually very specific that
[1:29:26] the Bible mentions the location
[1:29:29] of halot of of rahab's house says she
[1:29:33] was living by the wall because the one
[1:29:36] outstanding structure in Jericho was the
[1:29:38] war
[1:29:39] amen the one defense that they had was
[1:29:43] the war and it was strong it was wide it
[1:29:48] was impenetrable it was something that
[1:29:51] gave them pride and even though they
[1:29:53] knew that they were under judgment yet
[1:29:55] they still had confidence that we have
[1:29:58] such a great wall
[1:30:00] they are not going to be able to pass
[1:30:02] the war
[1:30:03] and God chooses a woman whose house is
[1:30:07] by the wall
[1:30:09] amen where there's confidence where
[1:30:12] there's security where there is
[1:30:14] Assurance God says this woman has to be
[1:30:16] living by the world Amen because the one
[1:30:19] thing that God wanted to do was to show
[1:30:22] Jericho that he would go and Destroy
[1:30:25] even their very strength
[1:30:27] but in order to show Redemption he would
[1:30:30] destroy everything else except for the
[1:30:33] house of Rahab which is also under
[1:30:36] judgment but a token has been applied
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:42] so in the messages I was with Moses
[1:30:45] the prophet says here
[1:30:48] now rehab the halot known as a hallowed
[1:30:51] she was a type of the believer today
[1:30:54] the real believer so you notice the
[1:30:57] prophet is already taking the story of
[1:30:58] Rahab and bringing it to today
[1:31:01] a real believer she didn't say now I
[1:31:05] hear that Joshua can do signs because
[1:31:08] he's the success of Moses I would like
[1:31:11] to see those signs and if I could see
[1:31:13] those signs then I'll believe it well he
[1:31:17] didn't absolutely have to show those
[1:31:21] signs because she believed it anyhow
[1:31:24] she was a Thomas
[1:31:26] she believed it
[1:31:28] and so just like in the book
[1:31:30] of Hebrews just like in the Book of
[1:31:34] James the prophet goes back to rehab and
[1:31:37] refers to her faith
[1:31:39] that the kind of faith that Rahab had
[1:31:43] was not the type of faith that looked
[1:31:45] for signs
[1:31:47] she was one who was prepared could
[1:31:50] believe even without seeing any other
[1:31:52] fresh signs
[1:31:55] Amen in the message widely to Bethlehem
[1:31:57] in referring to Bethlehem the city or
[1:32:01] the village or the settlement is you'd
[1:32:03] want to refer to it he says and we find
[1:32:06] out that it was also became the home of
[1:32:09] the Harlot rehab when Israel had passed
[1:32:13] over the borderline of the Jordan River
[1:32:15] into Palestine we are acquainted with
[1:32:17] the story of Rahab the halot let's pick
[1:32:20] jahed this morning for a few minutes
[1:32:23] as a young lady a beautiful young woman
[1:32:27] whose some Misfortune in life he had
[1:32:30] been forced in being Pagan he had been
[1:32:33] forced into the life that she was living
[1:32:36] and many times people are forced into
[1:32:39] the life that they live
[1:32:42] so the prophet goes and addresses the
[1:32:46] hallowed Pact
[1:32:48] in the full name of Rahab
[1:32:51] and he says yes she was
[1:32:53] but it was not by choice
[1:32:56] yes she was she was not known for great
[1:32:59] morals
[1:33:01] she was not known for being upright she
[1:33:04] was known for other things other than
[1:33:06] her morality but yet it was not because
[1:33:10] she chose to be in that situation
[1:33:13] the voice says she was forced into that
[1:33:16] situation by circumstances
[1:33:20] in other parts of the message many of
[1:33:23] you message readers the prophet says
[1:33:25] both her parents were cripples
[1:33:28] and being unbelievers she was forced
[1:33:31] into prostitution in order to provide
[1:33:33] for a living for a family
[1:33:36] amen so she was not choosing of her own
[1:33:40] choice
[1:33:41] she was not enjoying it in fact you
[1:33:44] realize that she did not want to be in
[1:33:47] it she wanted out but there was no way
[1:33:50] to come out
[1:33:52] Redemption
[1:33:58] under those two Messengers was also a
[1:34:01] Redemption from the life that she had
[1:34:03] long wanted to come out of
[1:34:06] amen so the prophet points that one out
[1:34:10] she did not want to be like that but
[1:34:12] circumstances wrong teachings wrong
[1:34:16] environments
[1:34:18] doctrines of devils had put here in that
[1:34:21] situation
[1:34:22] and the message token the prophet says
[1:34:26] this
[1:34:27] and this hallowed now taking the issue
[1:34:29] the story of Rahab and bringing it today
[1:34:32] he says this harlot Gentile watch all
[1:34:36] her family
[1:34:37] she was a believer
[1:34:39] oh her family had to get under that
[1:34:41] Scarlet streak that token
[1:34:44] they had to go under it or they would
[1:34:47] perish
[1:34:48] they had heard the wrath of God they had
[1:34:52] heard the displaying signs and miracles
[1:34:54] of god amongst his people and they had
[1:34:57] to receive it she had to receive it
[1:35:00] God's destroying Angel was coming they
[1:35:03] knew it and Joshua was that angel they
[1:35:07] were in line so is every nation in the
[1:35:11] world in line of God's judgment
[1:35:14] and so God takes the the rehab story
[1:35:18] takes the time she's in takes the types
[1:35:21] there and brings them to today
[1:35:25] and he says Jericho was under judgment
[1:35:27] there was only one way of Escape that
[1:35:31] was to be under the token and he says
[1:35:34] it's the same case today the world is
[1:35:37] under judgment nothing is going to stand
[1:35:40] everyone the scientists the economists
[1:35:43] the politicians they know that the world
[1:35:46] is under judgment everyone is expecting
[1:35:49] something tremendous to happen
[1:35:51] people know at the back part of their
[1:35:54] minds they know that this civilization
[1:35:56] has come to an end
[1:35:58] they know that after this where are we
[1:36:01] going that understanding is there
[1:36:04] amen people know that there is Judgment
[1:36:07] coming
[1:36:08] but amongst all that cares confusion
[1:36:12] fear and everything else that's
[1:36:15] happening there is a small humble woman
[1:36:18] that has been abused that has been used
[1:36:22] that has been forced by circumstances to
[1:36:25] be part of this corruption to be part of
[1:36:28] this wrong teaching to be part of this
[1:36:31] broken civilization yet within her she's
[1:36:35] got a faith in her heart that the I can
[1:36:38] get a token that yes this civilization
[1:36:42] is judged yes everything that I see this
[1:36:45] Cosmos is judged but I am sure you can
[1:36:48] if I can find the messengers of this God
[1:36:52] of Israel I can be able to get a token
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:56] amen so there's a simple humble woman
[1:36:59] who's not much to look at yet there is a
[1:37:03] faith in him that believes that I can be
[1:37:07] able to obtain the token and if I obtain
[1:37:10] the token then I'm going to be spared
[1:37:13] the prophet in referring to the Scarlet
[1:37:16] thread
[1:37:17] amen just to show us that this story of
[1:37:20] Ray of the halot means much more than
[1:37:22] you look at it on the surface
[1:37:25] the red heifer was to be killed first
[1:37:29] the red denoted Christ
[1:37:32] red also is a danger sign
[1:37:35] and red is a sign of redemption
[1:37:38] God brings Redemption through the red
[1:37:42] blood Rahab the halot was Redeemed by
[1:37:45] the Scarlet thread that left down from a
[1:37:49] house red is a sign of danger and red is
[1:37:53] a sign of
[1:37:54] Redemption so in other words that
[1:37:58] talking that Rahab received was actually
[1:38:01] Christ
[1:38:04] because the prophet says that the red
[1:38:06] denoted Christ
[1:38:09] and Christ speaks of redemption
[1:38:12] so in the type of that story Rahab
[1:38:16] received Christ hair Redemption and it
[1:38:20] was Christ a Redemption that stood and
[1:38:24] made so that she did not receive
[1:38:26] judgment just like everybody else
[1:38:29] and in the end time there is a humble
[1:38:33] woman that is going to receive Christ
[1:38:36] Hallelujah and it is going to be the
[1:38:39] Christ that she receives that's going to
[1:38:43] stand with her and be able to to protect
[1:38:47] him from the judgment and redeem her
[1:38:50] amen I was looking at my sister and I
[1:38:53] was like that's a very familiar face I
[1:38:55] couldn't remember
[1:38:57] praise the Lord now it's just come to me
[1:38:59] praise God we've been together in Perth
[1:39:02] a couple of times yeah yeah praise the
[1:39:04] Lord are you sister flesh mother praise
[1:39:07] the Lord
[1:39:10] so I've got small eyes but they see
[1:39:14] praise God
[1:39:16] amen praise God so you start to see that
[1:39:21] the story of Rahab the hallowed
[1:39:23] is tremendous
[1:39:25] amen and we can see what God's plan is
[1:39:30] when you look at Realm brother just when
[1:39:33] we look at that story which can even
[1:39:36] start singing Amazing Grace
[1:39:38] just to think
[1:39:40] that God before the foundation of the
[1:39:44] world
[1:39:45] head rehabi in his thoughts
[1:39:49] just to think that God in his thoughts
[1:39:52] was not concerned about a profession
[1:39:56] he was concerned about your faith
[1:39:58] just to think that in the whole city
[1:40:01] with all the important people the
[1:40:03] religious leaders political leaders the
[1:40:06] business people in the city God had a
[1:40:09] place for one person
[1:40:12] and that was rehab
[1:40:13] and God in his planning sends two
[1:40:17] Messengers and of all the places they
[1:40:20] could ever lend they landed in rehab's
[1:40:23] house
[1:40:26] yeah
[1:40:27] hey man they were Angels involved
[1:40:31] in the moving of the Angels working
[1:40:34] under the Joshua Commission the Angels
[1:40:38] were leading them and guiding them not
[1:40:42] to a noble house but to the house of a
[1:40:44] halot
[1:40:45] known as rehab because God had a plan
[1:40:49] for Rahab because Rahab is the type of
[1:40:52] the end time bride
[1:40:55] amen and God brought the connection
[1:40:59] between the messengers and Rahab and
[1:41:03] made them come to an understanding and
[1:41:06] the relationship because the faith in
[1:41:09] the two was exactly the same
[1:41:14] oh the grace of God
[1:41:17] the grace of God
[1:41:19] coming for one woman doesn't it remind
[1:41:22] you of the story of Eliza
[1:41:24] Hallelujah in the whole city God sends
[1:41:28] Elisa and Eliza says a prayer and he
[1:41:32] says Lord the woman that will give me a
[1:41:35] drink but not only me but also my camels
[1:41:40] that's the woman you have chosen for my
[1:41:42] master
[1:41:43] Hallelujah and God visits the young lady
[1:41:47] gives you a revelation she comes to the
[1:41:51] world at that moment
[1:41:53] immediately after the words have been
[1:41:56] spoken in prayer
[1:41:58] she arrives and she gives him a drink
[1:42:02] but not only him the camels also
[1:42:06] a little bit
[1:42:08] God works on both ends
[1:42:10] praise the Lord God works on both ends
[1:42:13] and so God and His angels were involved
[1:42:17] in the Redemption of Rebecca and God and
[1:42:21] His angels were involved in the
[1:42:23] Redemption of rehab and God and His
[1:42:26] angels are involved in the Redemption of
[1:42:29] the Bride of the end time
[1:42:34] everything has been set up
[1:42:36] you are not born in this generation by
[1:42:39] mistake
[1:42:40] you are not where you are by mistake God
[1:42:44] has for ordained it
[1:42:46] from before the foundation of the world
[1:42:48] that you would be born in this
[1:42:50] generation and God sent his Messengers
[1:42:53] and he came with them cut them a certain
[1:42:57] way gave them a certain voice gave them
[1:43:00] a certain personality gave them a
[1:43:03] certain location everything was designed
[1:43:06] because it would somehow be able to
[1:43:09] catch you
[1:43:11] and you would bring the connection
[1:43:12] between you and his messenger
[1:43:17] Hallelujah in the message the Easter
[1:43:19] sealed the prophet says
[1:43:23] paragraph 84.
[1:43:25] the voice says and the same thing is
[1:43:28] with every True Believer
[1:43:31] when the preaching of God's word comes
[1:43:33] forth and it is Vindicated and proved
[1:43:36] that is God's word for this hour
[1:43:39] then there is something within the
[1:43:41] believer
[1:43:42] I don't care how loyal his father was to
[1:43:45] a church
[1:43:46] or how loyal his mother was or his
[1:43:50] grandparents if that church is teaching
[1:43:53] contrary to this hour of the baptism of
[1:43:57] the Holy Ghost message there is
[1:44:00] something in him that screams out
[1:44:03] he will leave the Banyan
[1:44:05] he's got to do it
[1:44:07] the chicken might have been all right
[1:44:10] one day but this is Eagle hour it is a
[1:44:15] different
[1:44:15] there is something that he must leave
[1:44:19] the old cook and fly away Into the Blue
[1:44:23] then this Earthly body is quickened and
[1:44:27] brought by the quickening spirit to The
[1:44:30] Obedience of God's word
[1:44:33] amen
[1:44:35] now when this Holy Spirit represented as
[1:44:38] the ego flying over the land and finds
[1:44:42] the believer no man can come to me no
[1:44:46] man can come to me as he wants to
[1:44:49] oh the father has given me will come to
[1:44:52] me but no man can come by himself it
[1:44:56] isn't your own thinking your own drawing
[1:44:59] it's God drawing see oh the father has
[1:45:04] given me will come to me
[1:45:07] now the holy spirit is here on Earth
[1:45:10] looking out those individuals that God
[1:45:14] has ordained to life in this age
[1:45:16] and as soon as it finds it it does just
[1:45:20] like he did on Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:22] amen I like
[1:45:24] that first part of that paragraph
[1:45:27] now the Holy Spirit
[1:45:29] Joshua a type of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:45:33] prophet is saying the holy spirit is
[1:45:36] here on Earth looking out those
[1:45:39] individuals that God has ordained to
[1:45:43] life in this age
[1:45:45] and as soon as it finds it it does just
[1:45:50] like it did on Jesus Christ the great
[1:45:52] super Son of God who redeemed us all it
[1:45:56] comes down and takes its place of Abode
[1:45:59] in the human life now notice brought the
[1:46:02] quickening power now that quickening
[1:46:06] power That Came Upon Jesus quickened him
[1:46:10] to manifest every promise of the word of
[1:46:14] that day
[1:46:15] amen so does the holy spirit that come
[1:46:19] upon us in this day if it's not a
[1:46:21] mockery Holy Spirit if it's not the
[1:46:24] devil mocking the Holy Spirit but it is
[1:46:27] the real true Holy Spirit it will
[1:46:29] manifest
[1:46:31] that promise
[1:46:33] of this hour
[1:46:35] when it fell upon Luther it manifested
[1:46:39] that promise
[1:46:40] of that hour when it fell upon Wesley it
[1:46:44] manifested the promise of that hour when
[1:46:48] it falls in this day it manifests the
[1:46:52] promise of this hour
[1:46:55] when it fell upon Moses it manifested
[1:46:58] the promise of that hour fell upon Noah
[1:47:01] it manifests the promise of that hour
[1:47:04] when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the
[1:47:07] promise of that hour
[1:47:09] is the holy spirit coming down to
[1:47:14] Quicken make alive
[1:47:17] those people that fall ordained of God
[1:47:21] to be in the rapture
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:25] now once you mention the word quickening
[1:47:28] you don't Quicken nothing yeah
[1:47:32] once you mention the word quickening you
[1:47:35] Quicken something that can be quickened
[1:47:39] now I want you to notice something that
[1:47:42] the two Messengers did not bring this
[1:47:45] colored thread to the house of rehab
[1:47:50] the Scarlet thread was already in the
[1:47:54] house of rehab
[1:47:56] the only thing that the two Messengers
[1:47:59] did was to show her how to apply the
[1:48:04] token oh yeah
[1:48:07] praise the Lord so your eternal life
[1:48:12] your salvation is already in you
[1:48:19] it's not coming from somewhere it's
[1:48:23] already in you
[1:48:25] the only thing that the word does it
[1:48:28] quickens the very life that is within
[1:48:31] you
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:34] so Rahab was born with the faith to
[1:48:39] believe
[1:48:40] she could believe for the token because
[1:48:43] she was born with the equipment in him
[1:48:46] to believe
[1:48:48] the only thing that Messengers did to
[1:48:50] her was to show her how to apply the
[1:48:53] token but the token was already there
[1:48:57] because the prophet shows us that the
[1:49:00] token today is not the chemistry of the
[1:49:04] blood
[1:49:04] it's the life that is in the blood and
[1:49:09] eternal life is God's life Zoe and if
[1:49:12] you are Eternal you were always Eternal
[1:49:14] you don't become Eternal that day that
[1:49:17] you believe
[1:49:20] how we're together
[1:49:22] so the only thing that happened with
[1:49:25] Rahab was that she was quickened
[1:49:28] that which was in her was brought and
[1:49:31] quickened made alive so that it could
[1:49:35] start growing
[1:49:39] and the prayer says that's exactly the
[1:49:41] same thing today
[1:49:42] he says the word
[1:49:44] has come to Quicken those that are
[1:49:48] already for ordained
[1:49:51] praise the Lord in other words there is
[1:49:54] a people today that have already been
[1:49:57] designed have got the equipment in them
[1:50:01] the only thing they need is to hear the
[1:50:05] ego scream
[1:50:08] the eagle scream is not bringing
[1:50:11] anything new to them
[1:50:13] the eagle scream is telling them that
[1:50:16] you are not a chicken that you have the
[1:50:19] equipment already that those wings can
[1:50:22] fly Hallelujah that that diet you are
[1:50:25] eating is wrong that the things that you
[1:50:28] are doing are wrong you are not an
[1:50:30] earth-bound creature you are an ego of
[1:50:33] the atmospheres
[1:50:36] but the potentials are already there
[1:50:43] amen
[1:50:44] the potentials are already there
[1:50:47] and if you want to receive the baptism
[1:50:49] of the Holy Ghost this is the Revelation
[1:50:52] that you need
[1:50:54] don't need you don't need to fight to
[1:50:57] fast the process you don't need to quit
[1:50:59] this and quit that and quit that he says
[1:51:02] all you need to do is receive Christ and
[1:51:06] then the Christ in you will start to
[1:51:08] grow and he will push out all these
[1:51:11] things
[1:51:14] amen
[1:51:19] he says the Holy Ghost today will
[1:51:22] manifest the promise of the day
[1:51:25] if you were born for this day you were
[1:51:29] designed for this day
[1:51:31] don't you worry when inflation goes up
[1:51:34] don't you worry when there's four D and
[1:51:37] 5G
[1:51:38] don't you worry about all these things
[1:51:40] you were born for such a time as this
[1:51:44] don't you worry when life seems to
[1:51:47] overwhelm you and it's so hard to
[1:51:50] understand where you're going to be and
[1:51:52] what tomorrow holder don't you worry
[1:51:54] about what's going to happen to my kids
[1:51:56] you are so afraid that you will lose
[1:51:59] your kids but I want you to understand
[1:52:01] if your kids are full ordained to
[1:52:04] eternal life you will never lose them
[1:52:07] they were designed for such a time as
[1:52:09] this
[1:52:10] I know it's crazy out there but our God
[1:52:13] is not the author of confusion Our God
[1:52:17] will not fail Our God brought us to this
[1:52:20] generation because he knew we have what
[1:52:23] it takes to deal with the challenge of
[1:52:25] the hour
[1:52:30] praise the Lord
[1:52:34] and the prophet says here
[1:52:38] in the Easter seal message
[1:52:41] he says let me say that again
[1:52:44] when this Spirit has found you
[1:52:47] that individual and has come upon you
[1:52:51] it is the potential of your Eternal
[1:52:55] inheritance that God thought of you and
[1:52:58] made for you before the foundation of
[1:53:01] the world
[1:53:02] is that is your potential
[1:53:04] like if you asked me for an oak tree and
[1:53:07] I give you an aircon now the life of the
[1:53:11] oak tree is in the Echo now
[1:53:14] but you have to wait
[1:53:16] till it grows up
[1:53:20] so do we when you receive the holy
[1:53:23] spirit of God
[1:53:25] it's God's potential
[1:53:27] waiting upon you that's already
[1:53:31] recognized you
[1:53:32] and you are sealed by the spirit of
[1:53:35] promise
[1:53:36] of God into the body of Christ when God
[1:53:40] looked down at Calvary and seen Jesus
[1:53:43] dying he not only he died for his bride
[1:53:47] the body which is the word church
[1:53:51] the church that believes the word of God
[1:53:54] for the age whether it's it's Fit Body
[1:53:59] head
[1:54:00] or wherever it is see it's Christ was
[1:54:04] bleeding and dying and God looking upon
[1:54:08] Him saw his resurrection and the church
[1:54:12] raised with him on Easter
[1:54:15] now I want you to get all this together
[1:54:18] because I got something here in a little
[1:54:21] bit I want to say now notice it's the
[1:54:24] earnest or potential the quickening
[1:54:28] power of your Resurrection when you
[1:54:31] receive the Holy Spirit
[1:54:33] is then dwelling in you the potential of
[1:54:36] it
[1:54:39] notice you are now on your way
[1:54:43] growing to the full Resurrection
[1:54:46] the prophet says the problem with the
[1:54:49] Pentecostals is that when they received
[1:54:52] the Holy Ghost they said this is all of
[1:54:54] it
[1:54:55] and the prophet what they didn't
[1:54:57] understand is what they didn't
[1:54:58] understand was that it is the beginning
[1:55:03] praise the Lord so if you are satisfied
[1:55:07] that you have received the baptism of
[1:55:09] the Holy Ghost you are getting to
[1:55:11] betrayed like the Pentecostals because
[1:55:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:55:15] actually the beginning of it
[1:55:17] now let me say this the receiving of the
[1:55:21] token that Rahab received amen was just
[1:55:25] the beginning of the second phase of her
[1:55:28] life
[1:55:29] the only thing that the token meant was
[1:55:33] that the days of hair being used and
[1:55:35] abused were over
[1:55:38] what the token represented was
[1:55:41] Redemption that I have set you free from
[1:55:45] a life of sin and bondage and I'm giving
[1:55:48] you a new life but she was not going to
[1:55:52] end by just remaining in that wall house
[1:55:56] and saying oh thank you Lord Jesus I was
[1:56:00] not destroyed with the rest of the city
[1:56:01] I can now live in my own house in peace
[1:56:05] but when she received the token applied
[1:56:08] the token displayed the token then she
[1:56:12] started to grow and she started to grow
[1:56:15] in the second phase of her life
[1:56:19] because we understand that after she was
[1:56:22] saved
[1:56:23] she did not remain with the Gentiles she
[1:56:27] was inducted into the Commonwealth of
[1:56:29] Israel
[1:56:30] she became a part of Israel she fell in
[1:56:33] love with one of the mighty captains of
[1:56:35] Israel salmon and through Salman she
[1:56:39] received a seed the seed that was going
[1:56:42] to be a revelation of the mystery of the
[1:56:46] coming of the son of man
[1:56:48] because she received their seed from
[1:56:51] salmon a son of Caleb and after she
[1:56:54] received the seed she did not fall
[1:56:57] pregnant and give birth in one day but
[1:57:00] she waited she waited she lived Time
[1:57:03] After Time ate drank lived a month two
[1:57:07] months three months four months nine
[1:57:09] months and then Boaz was born who became
[1:57:13] the lord of the Harvest who also in a
[1:57:16] type redeemed Ruth
[1:57:22] that's right
[1:57:24] God
[1:57:26] protected the womb
[1:57:28] of Rahab
[1:57:30] in a prayer in her asking you don't hear
[1:57:34] of rehab praying for your children
[1:57:37] she asked for Redemption for a father
[1:57:39] her mother her brothers and the family
[1:57:43] and with that kind of love if she had
[1:57:46] children
[1:57:47] she would have asked for their
[1:57:49] Redemption
[1:57:50] she did not have children before someone
[1:57:53] in other words God
[1:57:56] knowing the Plan of Redemption
[1:57:58] protected the womb of Rahab
[1:58:02] we do all that she went through God did
[1:58:06] not allow her to conceive the children
[1:58:09] of all the other Gentiles but the seed
[1:58:11] of someone
[1:58:14] does God do that is that Bible pattern
[1:58:17] God visited the king after said I was
[1:58:21] prepared about to be taken as a wife and
[1:58:25] God says to the king you are a dead man
[1:58:28] you are a dead man because this is
[1:58:30] another man's wife
[1:58:32] God could not allow that seed to be able
[1:58:35] to settle there and conceive because he
[1:58:39] had a plan
[1:58:40] and no matter what you have gone through
[1:58:42] in life no matter what wrong teachings
[1:58:45] you've been in no matter what kind of
[1:58:48] riotous living you've been in I assure
[1:58:50] you brother sister God is always
[1:58:53] protected you
[1:58:55] there's places that God never allowed
[1:58:58] you to go there's things that God never
[1:59:01] allowed you to do there is abuses that
[1:59:04] God never allowed you to suffer because
[1:59:07] he knew that would not work in his
[1:59:09] advantage to according to the Plan of
[1:59:12] Redemption because you are a chosen
[1:59:14] vessel
[1:59:16] [Music]
[1:59:18] so he protects
[1:59:19] so that he can work out his Plan of
[1:59:21] Redemption
[1:59:22] right so rehab when she applied the
[1:59:25] token that was not the end of it she
[1:59:28] said I'm not remaining in this place of
[1:59:31] unbelief I'm not remaining in this place
[1:59:33] that is under judgment I'm joining a new
[1:59:37] Commonwealth the Commonwealth of Israel
[1:59:39] I don't know how long she stayed in
[1:59:42] Israel but all the habits that had been
[1:59:46] acquired whilst in Jericho one by one
[1:59:49] they started to fall off
[1:59:51] Hallelujah all the slang started to fall
[1:59:55] off
[1:59:55] hallelujah oh that dressing in that
[1:59:58] dressing started to fall off all the
[2:00:02] other things that were unclean started
[2:00:05] to fall off and brother Ray of the
[2:00:08] hallowed started to be rare rehab
[2:00:11] they're gorgeous
[2:00:13] Hallelujah in the mighty Captain
[2:00:16] Hallelujah of Israel looked at her and
[2:00:19] did not see a harlot and he saw a bride
[2:00:24] foreign
[2:00:25] [Applause]
[2:00:37] and as you hear the word as you feed on
[2:00:40] the word your life is slowly transformed
[2:00:43] and you start to change all the habits
[2:00:46] start to go old shoes are thrown out old
[2:00:50] clothes are thrown out and the new
[2:00:52] clothes come in Hallelujah new things
[2:00:54] come in new language coming new habits
[2:00:58] coming Hallelujah what's happening you
[2:01:01] are being transformed by the renewing of
[2:01:04] your mind and your life starts to
[2:01:06] manifest the revelation of the coming of
[2:01:09] the son of man you have you receive your
[2:01:12] seed and that seed has got to be made
[2:01:15] manifest what's that seed the very Life
[2:01:18] of Christ
[2:01:21] praise to my
[2:01:23] mind Hallelujah
[2:01:25] so it's the earnest or the potential the
[2:01:27] quickening power of your Resurrection
[2:01:29] when you receive the Holy Spirit then is
[2:01:32] dwelling in you
[2:01:33] notice you are now on your way growing
[2:01:37] to the full Resurrection
[2:01:40] no tree just comes up overnight
[2:01:43] that's some of the frustrations that
[2:01:45] people have when they start doubting
[2:01:46] their experience
[2:01:48] they're expecting to be perfect in a
[2:01:50] single day
[2:01:52] I came to the altar
[2:01:54] I had that experience
[2:01:56] I know something happened to me but how
[2:01:59] come I still have these thoughts how
[2:02:01] come I still feel this way how come I
[2:02:03] still have this struggle keep growing in
[2:02:06] his grace
[2:02:07] you are not going to become an adult
[2:02:09] Tree in one day
[2:02:10] Enoch walked with God it was not
[2:02:13] overnight it was a walk over years and
[2:02:17] years and years but he kept walking with
[2:02:20] God until he was not
[2:02:24] amen so don't give up
[2:02:27] don't think I'm a failure I should
[2:02:29] change it flick of a switch like that
[2:02:32] look closely in the scriptures you will
[2:02:35] see how God works you are not going to
[2:02:37] become an adultery in one day
[2:02:40] amen and he says there
[2:02:44] you
[2:02:45] um it's got to grow
[2:02:48] as we grow in the grace and knowledge of
[2:02:50] God you are baptized into the Holy
[2:02:53] Spirit now as the Pentecostal Church
[2:02:57] baptized into the holy spirit it's begin
[2:03:00] growing limb says died they was pruning
[2:03:04] them off but the tree is still growing
[2:03:08] it's still going on because it's got to
[2:03:11] come to the resurrection they are led by
[2:03:15] the spirit to Quicken the word to you
[2:03:18] who is Believers the word keeps
[2:03:21] quickening as you come to First limp
[2:03:24] second limb third limb on out it just
[2:03:29] keeps quickening the spirit of God keeps
[2:03:32] quickening to you
[2:03:35] amen he says the spirit of God keeps
[2:03:38] quickening to you
[2:03:40] brother says how is the raw cold
[2:03:45] right and he says the role is not called
[2:03:48] out as in Oman never
[2:03:50] come up or as in live Veil come up he
[2:03:54] says but your name is called by the
[2:03:57] unfolding of the mystery
[2:04:00] are you understanding this in other
[2:04:02] words the revelation of the word is
[2:04:06] connected to your name
[2:04:09] amen so God doesn't to call doesn't have
[2:04:13] to call your name and say brother
[2:04:15] Michael it's now it's your time to live
[2:04:17] sin and come and start to live with me
[2:04:20] God directs his Messengers whether it's
[2:04:24] a brother whether it's a sister but he
[2:04:27] makes an appointment like he made an
[2:04:30] appointment with Rahab and you come into
[2:04:33] contact with one of his Messengers and
[2:04:36] the messenger tells you about the word
[2:04:39] of God in other words gives you the
[2:04:42] revelation of the mystery of the word of
[2:04:44] God and something in you resonates with
[2:04:48] what you hear you're like something
[2:04:51] connects to this it's like I've had this
[2:04:53] thing before I don't know why this
[2:04:55] church is a bit odd this church is
[2:04:58] called account by people but somehow
[2:05:00] when I hear what they say there is a
[2:05:02] connection the prophet says what is
[2:05:04] happening the unfolding of the mystery
[2:05:07] is the calling out of your name so God
[2:05:10] doesn't have to do much he just has to
[2:05:12] send his messenger and reveal the
[2:05:15] mystery and when you hear the mystery
[2:05:17] you are going to hear your name
[2:05:22] amen that's what rayab heard
[2:05:25] when she heard of the mighty works
[2:05:28] of God
[2:05:30] she heard the name
[2:05:33] they have heard their name
[2:05:35] she did not understand Israel but when
[2:05:38] she heard of the great things of God
[2:05:39] that he was doing somehow in a heart she
[2:05:44] knew that she belonged in Israel
[2:05:47] the great works of God
[2:05:50] spoke her name
[2:05:53] what did Rachel what did Rebecca see
[2:05:56] she hate their name
[2:05:59] she heard the name is aliens I was
[2:06:02] talking about his master
[2:06:04] oh he's like this oh he's like that
[2:06:08] in the depth of the mind of Rebecca she
[2:06:11] saw herself stand next to this master
[2:06:15] she started to see the vision and see
[2:06:18] that Isaac needed a wife and I am that
[2:06:21] wife
[2:06:22] and it was such a strong Revelation that
[2:06:26] when she was asked that shall you go
[2:06:29] with this man this strange guy who's
[2:06:33] coming with long tails shall you go with
[2:06:35] him she said clear cut I will go with
[2:06:40] him
[2:06:41] because it was revealed in him that she
[2:06:44] belonged next to Isaac and in this end
[2:06:47] time there is a people that are clear
[2:06:51] on who they are
[2:06:53] that are clear that they are a part of
[2:06:56] the Bride of Jesus Christ they have
[2:06:59] heard the ego Shout they've heard the
[2:07:02] unfolding of the mystery and in the
[2:07:04] unfolding of the mystery they've heard
[2:07:07] their names
[2:07:09] and though they are people of no
[2:07:11] reputation though they are not special
[2:07:13] people
[2:07:15] yet they are special before God
[2:07:19] and they receive
[2:07:21] instruction from The Messengers that are
[2:07:25] working under the Joshua commission and
[2:07:27] they know how to apply the token and
[2:07:30] they apply the token and they escape the
[2:07:33] judgments Hallelujah and when they
[2:07:36] escape the judgments
[2:07:38] that life that they've received which is
[2:07:41] Christ represented by this colored
[2:07:43] thread starts to grow within them and
[2:07:46] everything else of Jericho starts to
[2:07:49] fall off with each passing day and they
[2:07:52] get connected to their maid salmon and
[2:07:56] they bring out a seed that reveals the
[2:07:59] mystery of Christ
[2:08:03] that's you and I
[2:08:06] you were born for this
[2:08:08] you are equipped for this
[2:08:10] the prophet says when God said to to
[2:08:13] Moses why cry speak
[2:08:16] the Bible says God when he said that he
[2:08:18] knew that Moses was born with the
[2:08:21] equipment in him and the prophet says
[2:08:23] Moses was born with the gift of great
[2:08:26] faith
[2:08:29] so when God says speak and move forward
[2:08:31] he knew that he had that Faith to speak
[2:08:35] and move forward
[2:08:37] When God says there shall be a bride
[2:08:39] without Spoto wrinkle don't look around
[2:08:42] look in the mirror
[2:08:44] yes you may not look like much but God
[2:08:49] when he says there is going to be a
[2:08:50] bride without spot or wrinkle he knows
[2:08:53] you've got the equipment in you to
[2:08:56] overcome in this generation
[2:09:00] in this generation with all the websites
[2:09:03] with all the entertainments with all the
[2:09:06] World Cups with all the influence of the
[2:09:09] enemy God knows you are more than able
[2:09:12] to overcome this world yeah
[2:09:15] why because you were designed to live in
[2:09:18] this age
[2:09:21] you are like rehab
[2:09:23] God says yeah
[2:09:25] that's a mighty woman of villa
[2:09:28] and everyone else is standing and
[2:09:30] looking at each other like what's
[2:09:31] happening
[2:09:32] is he talking about
[2:09:37] but there was one thing that stood
[2:09:41] it was the faith of rehab
[2:09:46] there was something eternal
[2:09:49] in real
[2:09:52] there was something eternal
[2:09:55] in the woman in the world
[2:09:58] there was something eternal
[2:10:01] in Mary Magdalene
[2:10:04] there was something eternal
[2:10:07] in Ruth
[2:10:09] but they faced a husband
[2:10:11] had to die
[2:10:13] so that she could have a second husband
[2:10:17] there's always been something Eternal in
[2:10:19] the bride
[2:10:20] but the first husband is going to die
[2:10:24] because there's only one seed
[2:10:26] that reveals the mystery of the coming
[2:10:28] of the son of man
[2:10:31] is the seed of the second husband
[2:10:35] which is Christ
[2:10:39] the Lord and that's where we are
[2:10:42] growing in his grace
[2:10:44] the limbs are growing out the approach
[2:10:46] says everything that you need in this
[2:10:49] life
[2:10:50] and in the Rapture is already in you
[2:10:54] he says the only thing that you need to
[2:10:56] do is to make sure that you are planted
[2:10:59] By the Waters
[2:11:01] and you drink in so much so that you
[2:11:04] push out so much and everyone says all
[2:11:07] those bushels of apples
[2:11:09] where were they they were in the little
[2:11:12] seed
[2:11:13] the thing that you need to overcome
[2:11:15] right now is not out there it's right in
[2:11:19] you
[2:11:20] the only thing that you need to do is to
[2:11:23] take in so much
[2:11:24] so that you can push out so much and
[2:11:28] produce the fruit that meets the
[2:11:30] challenge of this generation I'll read
[2:11:32] this quote as I come to your close
[2:11:36] the Sun
[2:11:38] has got to be reviewed again
[2:11:41] in the bride in the last day
[2:11:45] that quickening power has got to come
[2:11:49] Quicken them out of these dead
[2:11:51] denominations and Creeds to a Living
[2:11:55] Word
[2:11:56] of the Living God oh
[2:12:00] that's the promise of the day
[2:12:02] a Living Word
[2:12:04] of the Living God
[2:12:06] who are we talking about you and I
[2:12:09] that's the promise of this generation
[2:12:12] the word living written Epistles that
[2:12:15] are read of all men Rahab the hallowed
[2:12:18] married to Salman the Great Captain
[2:12:20] coming together producing the seed
[2:12:23] that's the bride that's the son of man
[2:12:26] that's Christ coming together and his
[2:12:30] life
[2:12:31] coming forth through us which is the
[2:12:34] Living Word of the Living God that's the
[2:12:37] promise of today
[2:12:38] that's who we are there is no false
[2:12:41] matter in these things there's no
[2:12:44] cranking ourselves into it we were born
[2:12:46] into this
[2:12:47] there's no trying to force ourselves
[2:12:49] into the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[2:12:51] for us
[2:12:52] the Holy Ghost is for you you cannot
[2:12:54] force it in you were predestinated to
[2:12:57] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:59] you were born for that reason to receive
[2:13:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to show
[2:13:04] forth Christ in this generation that's
[2:13:07] why we are here to show Christ to this
[2:13:10] world amongst the Carpenters amongst the
[2:13:13] mechanics amongst the teachers amongst
[2:13:16] the students amongst the business people
[2:13:18] amongst all these people there is a
[2:13:20] people that God has said I am choosing
[2:13:22] you to show forth my life and the more
[2:13:26] we feed on this world the more we become
[2:13:28] like him the more we continue to feed
[2:13:31] the approach says the moment you receive
[2:13:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have
[2:13:35] received your potential for the Rapture
[2:13:37] in other words you are already a Rapture
[2:13:40] candidate
[2:13:43] whilst Peter yet speak these words
[2:13:47] the Holy Ghost fell upon them in other
[2:13:50] words as the Revelation was going forth
[2:13:52] that which is eternal that was in them
[2:13:56] was quickened up and there was a
[2:13:58] connection between the Revelation and
[2:14:01] the one receiving the Holy Ghost
[2:14:03] Hallelujah for full obedience to the
[2:14:06] full word of God entitles you to the
[2:14:08] token why because that token is
[2:14:12] connected to the message this is the
[2:14:15] prophet says in one place this is the
[2:14:18] message to apply the token
[2:14:20] amen this message is the unleashing of
[2:14:24] the Holy Ghost upon the people
[2:14:26] this message is what awakens you to what
[2:14:30] you already have and tells you that it
[2:14:33] just needs to be quickened this message
[2:14:36] this Holy Ghost message is the
[2:14:39] quickening power to Quicken that which
[2:14:41] is eternal already in you so that you
[2:14:44] come to life
[2:14:46] to become who you are supposed to be
[2:14:51] but the potential is already there
[2:14:54] that's you and I
[2:14:56] may the Lord reach to bless you as we
[2:14:58] invite the musicians forward praise the
[2:15:01] Lord
