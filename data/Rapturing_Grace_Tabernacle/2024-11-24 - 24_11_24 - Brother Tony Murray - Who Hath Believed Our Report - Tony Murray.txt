time and if anyone recognizes the song if you could let me know um it's from a cassette tape when I was first dating Julie 1500 years ago it was the first album I ever or first cassette I ever brought that was uh yeah just an instrumental one in a Christian Bookshop of course I've lost it since I don't know the name of the song otherwise i' put the words up [Music] okay [Music] [Music] f [Music] H hallelu Jesus king of kings [Music] [Applause] [Music] than for lord gave me this song it's got the date on the 28th of April 1989 and um it spoke of my experience of wandering around in the world and not um finding anything but all that mattered was finding the Lord [Music] well I wed around in a dry thirsty land and I looked for somewhere to dwell with a hope that I'd find some true peace of mind but there's none to to be found in this world oh where do I go to from here with a heart that is aching with fear and the night grows so dim and I'm lost in my sin tell me where do I go to from [Music] here to one who had TR with the footsteps of God and had walked in the dry we [Laughter] land whispered words in my ear that I now hold so dear as he reached out those nail pierced hands and he said I'll tell you you where to go to from here for your mind and your heart is sincere and I'll show you the way both by night and by day there is no need my child to [Music] feed now this life I have found with true peace does abound W and traded for riches no Fame for my heart is a rest and I now have the best and my friend you can have the same he'll tell you where to go to from here for he knows if your heart is that [Music] inere and he'll show you the way both by night and by day there is no need my child to Fe [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise the Lord thank you very much for those songs I U just really enjoyed the atmosphere that it brings and just thank the Lord for for his goodness and his presence with us amen I'd like to welcome each and everyone this morning I trust that you come with Open Hearts with uh excited Hearts about what the Lord has for us uh special word of welcome for brother Tony and sister Vicki and family and also for Brother Bruce and sister Marlene it's lovely to have you God bless you and everyone else may the Lord just give us a a very blessed time together this morning um we um after church today we'll we'll have another baptism which I'm very very very thankful for and the Lord has has worked on Caitlyn's heart and and she's indicated that she would like to be baptized so we thank the Lord for that amen um I just I just want to um kind of remind you I know I probably announced that a few months ago but God willing p and I will um be going to Canada in well not this coming Thursday but the Thursday after so on the 5th um we living for for 2 weeks um so just letting you know again um and this coming Wednesday night brother Adrien will be will be taking the service so please keep your brother in prayer also for that so this morning we have brother Tony um and let's just enter in and and let the Lord speak to us we just looking forward to What the Lord Has for us this morning so um let's stand together I want to sing a song that's probably a strange song to to call a minister up on but um I just happen to know the title of the service this morning who report do you believe you of oh whose report do you believe rep who report do you believe of oh whose report do you believe oh his report says I am he his report says I Am SE his report says I am free his report says Victory oh his report says I am he his report says I am still his report says I am free his Reports say Victory who report do you believe you believe the tell me who report do you believe oh who report do you [Applause] believe tell me who report do you believe oh his report says I am here [Applause] [Music] well you already know the end of the story amen as long as we're going to believe the report all is well praise the Lord so we're very thankful that uh in this day we have the the complete picture we know the end and the the beginning you know brother Brenham told us things that are before Genesis 1:1 and he told us what happens after the end of the book of Revelation so we know where we stand we're a blessed people but maybe we can just look into it a little bit more detail today and um get something from it that'll be a blessing to you so just let's just turn to the scripture here Isaiah 53 and verse 1 as we make a beginning and thank you musicians amen one little verse it's got two questions in it says who hath Isaiah 53:1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so firstly who's believed the report and who has the who to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed amen let's just pray at this time Heavenly Father Lord we just ask that you would break this to us today Lord seems like a simple scripture but yet there's a profound uh message and meaning in here I ask Lord that you just make it known to us and just feed us this morning we ask and pray in jesus' name amen amen God bless you you may be seated so firstly the what says who who ha believed the uh our report it's not so much speaking about the report it's speaking about who's actually going to believe it so we've identified we've already sung who's believed the report of the Lord and we've always SE that's us so um that's really I'm going to get right to that point at the end that this whole thing it points right back to our position our position in Christ so we're very thankful for that who has believed uh the report well we're that's us and uh even you all of the prophets really had this in mind if you think about it they came as Messengers and so is anybody actually going to believe what I'm what I'm going to say and even Jesus himself when he knew that he was going to be coming a second time he says when the son of man cometh will he find Faith he this is this is God himself but he says when I come the next time it's on his mind will I find Faith because it was always the case where people didn't believe the report that was given it's just the way that it's always been you know there's um uh a couple of times where we see in scripture the Lord talk about the arm of the Lord the arm the Lord actually means the strength and the power and the holy justice of God and you think about when uh um outside Jericho there Joshua standing there and he sees a man standing against the wall with a sword drawn on his hand and he says are you for us or are you against us and he says as the captain of the host of the Lord am I now come well that to me that that kind of typifies what the arm of the Lord looks like that's the strength and the power of the Lord you Joshua only reason Joshua could go up to that man was because he knew his commission the Lord says I'll be with you there won't be a man be able to stand against you all the days of your life amen so he believed that report I was reading in the message where brother BR talks about there was two times in his ministry where people challenged him one time somebody put out a whole lot of Fliers and said brother brandham said William brandham is Simon the the Sorcerer And the FBI are coming here today coming into the meeting and they're going to expose him and another time was with those 300 ministers they set up a trap for brother Brenham and both those occasions brother Brenham says you've seen him in his in uh in healing but he says you want to see him in battle he said he's marvelous in battle amen and you know when the saints talked about that the Lord was going to come lift up you Gates lift up you know Everlasting Gates he says the king of glory is going to come and says who is this king of glory he says the Lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle amen and I want to just read here out Revelation chapter 19 we get another picture of him just as we make a beginning it says and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness do he judge and make war and his eyes are as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood so we know it's the Lord Jesus and his name was called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses clothed and fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that's his word and with it uh that with it he should Smite the Nations and should rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness and wroth of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords amen and that's the one that Isaiah was saying who is the strength of the Lord this power this holy uh justice the Lord who is that going to be revealed to and I can tell you it's revealed to the bride not only is it revealed like in a head knowledge it's going to be manifest in the bride amen and that's the Revelation that he was talking about but I want to go right back now to the beginning back in the beginning brother Brenham says that uh God was in eternity and he dwelt alone he was by himself and he was there with his thoughts and he says his thoughts are Eternal and he was thinking of us and I'm glad that we know that he was thinking of us right back in the beginning but um brother bam says that all the attributes were in him he was just he was melling over these things in his mind to be a Healer to be a savior to be a father to be a son to be a husband he was thinking of all these things how he was going to have a bride and while he was thinking on all these things nothing moved nothing happened he knew that the moment that he spoke things were going to happen it was going to suddenly come into being but he was just enjoying the thoughts of what was going to be and nothing moved brother bam says it was always God's intention he wanted to become tangible it's always it's God becoming tangible he says you a part of God Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts that's what he come to redeem redeem means buy back you had to be in his thoughts before he can redeem you and when we realized that we're redeemed we go praise the Lord he was thinking of me before the foundation of the world you can't say that till you are redeemed but when you are redeemed you realize hey he was thinking me praise the Lord and that's why the bride cries Grace Grace amen praise the Lord the whole thing uh he says Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me the whole thing is God becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one together God and his church becoming one amen but by his full knowledge he could see us and he could see us even in this day and he could see what you would do with the word in this day so that's why he could predestinate you yes he says when they presented with my word in the day in which they live they will receive it he says so right back before he started to make anything he says I can already predetermine their destination because he knows what you do with the word he knows what's In You by the way that you react to the word in fact that's what the only way we know what's in US is by the way that we react to the word praise the Lord so while he was thinking on all this creation and all the attributes and things that he was going to make he also thought he was going to make angels and he's going to make one called Lucifer and he knew what Lucifer was going to do amen he knew he was going to make him beautiful the most beautiful of all of the angels and he's going to he's going to get lifted up in Pride and eventually he's going to be the enemy of God but God knew this from the beginning he knows all things so so it wasn't like oh suddenly the Devils arrived on the scene he knew that was going to happen and he had to allow that to happen and in his thoughts his thinking about how it's all going to transpire and how that he's going to be tested and tried himself but all of the Brethren down through the age are going to be tested and tried but it's actually the word in you that's being tested and tried amen and he can see the end that there's a victory amen so we're glad about that so we let all those things happen but the Bible actually says that he himself was perfected through the things that he suffered that's right and the bride is perfected by the things that we suffer the things that we go through the challenges that we have and we make a stand for the truth he says that goes to your credit that goes to your credit one day he's going to say Well done my good and faithful soon he can only say Well done if there's something done well so he has to put a challenge there so we have something to overcome he says now you're an overcomer but you couldn't be an overcomer without something to overcome so he said I got to have Lucifer he's got to be there because who else is going to put these hurdles in the way who else is going to be the challenge to you if I don't have a devil he's got to have him so he's thinking about all these things and he's thinking well but in the end I'm going to bring it to a great climax I'm going to bring it to the point where I will have a bride I'll have a gentile bride the love of my life she'll be with me throughout the eternities he said that's what it's going to be she'll be an overcomer just like me because I've overcome the world you'll overcome the world he it was in his thinking he was enjoying the moment amen the moment might have been long and he's thing he's going to have his Brethren the Jews he's going to have the New Jerusalem coming down the holy city the great king the Eternal Kingdom what what a what a great thing this is going to be great should we should be thinking this is going to be great I'm looking forward to being there amen amen and while he was enjoying all that still there was no light brother re said there was no Darkness there was no nothing just his thinking but then the moment that he spoke and said let there be the biggest explosion of energy that's ever been took place all of the energy that's in every Star and every Galaxy on the earth anywhere was created in that moment and you know what there's still evidence of that right now you can look out to space if you can look 13.8 billion uh light years you see what they call the cosmic microwave background radiation it's just like a haze at that point and that's the leftover from God saying let there be now God could have created something and he does does create things like he did squirrels and says Let There Be squirrels and it's there he could have just said let the sun be there and it is let the Earth be there and it is but brother R said that's not how he did it so he he can do that and he did do that with squirrels he probably is how he did it when he replenished the Earth in Genesis 1:2 as he let the animals be here and so forth but they a lot of those those animals were here previously but when he replenished the Earth that's probably how he did it I'm just saying probably but the reason is that God is a supernatural God and we need to break that into two words he's super and he's natural yeah and that's the way he often lets things play out so between Genesis 1:1 he said let there be and this massive explosion but slowly the gases coales into being planets and stars and galaxies and he just let it L out brother say billions of years and then he stopped everything where he wants it yeah and he's got to and there was life here on Earth previously and then we get to Genesis 1:2 and the Earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep he says now I'm ready to make this creation for a people to express that can be my bride and brother ra says God's in no hurry he just lets these things so he's super he does it but he lets it play out in a natural sequence and then he harnesses that amen so that's the way that he does it so then after our creation began he started speaking again and he actually spoke for 6,000 years and the creation came into being in fact brother R says even when he said let there be light he said the sun was already there been there for billions of years the sun was already there he said let there be light there was a fog like a Darkness over the face of the Earth and he said let there be light he said it might have been 800 years before the light came through that's just a quote from Brother renom but but moment he said let there be light he said it's good because when he spoke his word he knew it was going to take place he knew it's going to come to pass amen praise the Lord so in the beginning brother BR he's in the future home he says God in the beginning when he thought of you he thought of others like that he thought of himself becoming tangible that was his thoughts and so he expressed his thought by word and he Le said let there be let there be let there be and there was and there was he says and after a while he kept saying let there be till the people said one day don't let God speak he said now I'll speak to them through a prophet from this time on I'll speak to them through a prophet amen but just before we move on remember the very first form of expression of the thought of God was a word he spoke a word it went from thought to word to manifestation that's that's that's God's signature if you like that's what he does when he the very first expression of the Rapture went from a thought to a word which is called the shout in the Bible the message went forth the very first expression was word form but it will continue to unfold until the bride takes a body change amen so that's that's the what it is but because the word has already gone forth remember when it was just a thought nothing moved but now that he's spoken the message in this last days which is the rapture message the Rapture must take place amen it's absolutely a guarantee and I happen to believe it and that means I'm part of it amen I think we should just say we are the rapture because the Rapture can't go without us amen so when Isaiah's asking this question here who ha believed our report he's saying he he didn't doubt the word of the Lord but who's going to believe it when that word is spoken through me because it wasn't so much the that he was concerned about the word of the Lord he was concerned that they were going to believe me and and all of the prophets had exactly the same question and it wasn't surprising that Isaiah had this question because they rejected the people did they rejected him they rejected his message they killed him they so him up with SS so it was a valid question who's going to believe me he wasn't it wasn't just a a frivolous question he realized that it's very unlikely that anybody is actually going to believe me but you know what the Lord says his word will not return unto him void the word that Isaiah spoke We Now read it today many many scriptures that we have we say that Isaiah prophesied that all the Prophecies of Christ they came to pass that Isaiah prophesied 800 years before the coming of Christ he was a genuine Prophet the prophecies came to pass the word will not return unto the Lord void it will accomplish that for which it sent but it has it can only accomplish something in those that believe it amen so that's want to do so what it really means is that somebody is actually going to believe it amen and the prophet says here and what it's going to come to when when the Lord is creating everything he says God God had to believe his own word God said let there be and it was this is the message Jehovah Jara he believed his own word everything material come from the supernatural God spoke the world into existence amen and he believed it he believed his own word and then it came to pass so then throughout time and brother calls them Junctions in time the Lord sent prophets whenever he was going to do something remember he said the Lord God does nothing but he reveals it to servants the prophets first at those Junctions of time a prophet had to come and speak the word before it could be made manifest Noah had to come and say it's going to rain before it could rain Moses had to say speak about the Exodus that we're going to we're going to leave this land the Lord's going to come and Deliver Us with a mighty hand and it seemed like there was going to be an impossibility but because it was spoken it was the word of the Lord and it transpired just exactly that way now most of what we know about absolutely everything we have to believe somebody yes when you go to school children go to school if they don't believe the teacher you don't learn anything from the teacher if the teacher doesn't know what they're talking about well you wouldn't learn anything or even if you come to church and The Minister's ministering you think oh he doesn't know he's talking about you're not going to learn anything so whatever we learn we go to university or whatever we need to actually have confidence in the one that's bringing the message message before you can receive the message yeah if we read it in a book or I see people often these days they become experts while looking at something on YouTube oh yes I'm an expert now it means that they've given their they' they've handed over their confidence to this person who makes the video it's very easy to do and it's very easy to get trapped into the wrong thing by doing that so a question that we should all ask and we probably do ask but we maybe don't ask enough is is this actually a credible uh person or you know a credible um thing that's being said here because there are a multitude of voices in the world never ever before in human history have there been so many voices so many opinions and not only do people have those opinions because they probably had opinions before but they want to spread those opinions they want to put it on YouTube they want to put it want to get their own blog or they want to they want to tell you and they want to get people to agree like give me a thumbs up and the more people that agree it to them it means they must be right but you know who's got the most thumbs up Satan he's got the most people that agree with him way more than God has and he's wrong you you see things like in the news we reading this and they can make you mad but we know that the world has to go this way the the the news articles about Israel and the most of the news articles they absolutely just against Israel in every turn you know they should be letting uh gazin you know have from the river to the Sea and I don't know where Israel would go but you know everybody's trying to support the wrong thing but the there's there's still two polarized positions this the the UN or the ICC just recently said they want arrest warrants issued arrest warrants for nyaho and and Galant I think it was and uh then all of the different nations of the world they put out a statement whether they agreed with this or they disagreed with it agreed disagree agree disagree and there was no one in the middle that all either against Israel or for Israel polarized positions and we find that in everything in life and it's just it's just the age that we live in it's just the way that it is so what we need whatever we're dealing with we need a credible witness brother brandham says here and greater than Solomon is here he said God in all ages has never been without a witness God has sometimes got down to only one man but he's always had a witness somebody who believed him amen and God always Vindicated his Witnesses if you seen a prophet he Vindicated them and you know even when Jesus came and uh to the two on the road to Emmas he said fools and SL heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken you know you think he could have said fools and SL of heart to believe everything I told you but he didn't do that he said believe all that the prophets has spoken amen because God had identified them previously and they lined up with the word but there are many many other Witnesses B I calls them false Witnesses there's many many others out there so which witness We Believe makes all a difference we're here today because we believe a particular witness but there's other people gathered in other places and they believe a different witness Jehovah's Witness or whoever it is they think oh this is little there's a road goes up a hill and there's a bus there and it's crashed straight into the back of a car and you just come there after it's happened and you see this bus is running to the back of the car and uh somebody says wow that bus driver is going to get a ticket because you know obviously the car that's the vehicle that's behind that crashes in is at fault and he's going to get a ticket when the police get here cuz he smashed this car up really bad but somebody else comes maybe a child says no no no no the bus was stopped and the car rolled down the hill without the handbrake on and it crashed into the back of the car there not even a driver in the car yeah depending on who you believe makes the story completely different it's it's all dependent on which witness you're going to believe and that's exactly where we stand with regard to the word of God who whose witness are we going to believe who ha believed our report amen so right in the beginning God knew that man was going to fall he knew that before he created anything he knew the nature that was in mankind that he was going to fall and he made a plan from the beginning to redeem that man he intended to make a way back brother R says in the Ephesian Church age before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man he says now watch this improving his word now watch the wisdom of God no there would be unbelievers and how the majority would be unbelievers he by forn knowledge predestinated a seed for every age that would believe it amen every age there's going to be somebody that's going to believe it because he had a continual lineage he said he never got down to less than one man amen and he says he does it by his fulln knowledge do you know what that means he looks ahead I think I said when I was here last time thing that God does he remembers the future we only can remember the past but he can remember the future and he looks at you and goes when you get here in 2024 you are going to believe my word and because you've responded to my word now I go back before the foundation of the world and I will predestinate you and say I put my mark on you that you will be there in that Heavenly Kingdom to come amen he predestinate you and I found this quote and I really love this he says before there was a world you were in God's thoughts he says you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew that you'd be wanting it don't you love that he knew that you'd be wanting it before the foundation of the world he knew that's within you praise the Lord I love that I've love that now one thing that people have always had with the message of any age is if they don't want to let's say obey the message if they don't if they don't want to take the message wholeheartedly they find fault with the messenger always it doesn't matter what the messenger is uh I was a balum he found fault with his messenger was a donkey he was going to beat him with a stick but he was just a messenger yeah so now but God when he has spoken in each age he's spoken through human vessels it was his plan to do that way but the thing with human vessels are human vessels have human nature and human nature is a real Downer we've all got it and it's a problem but um God knew what he was doing you know when he chose the prophets brother BR says some of them their temper got away from them you think of Jonah you know he he he was reluctant to do what the Lord wanted him to do he wanted to go he's going to take a ship to tarish and then the then the Lord brings a storm and okay yeah it's me so throw me over gets thrown over and he goes in the well whales belly and and he he was a man of great faith and he prayed and the Lord you know made the whale take him up and spit him out on the shore but when he went went to preach to n brother say he he didn't like them yeah that's right they were not his people they were Gentiles he was a Jew he didn't want to be there he was an angry prophet he went in and preached Hellfire and brimstone and you're all going to die because you won't repent you know and he was so convincing cuz he was such an angry prophet and they repented and he got outside the city and he said I'm going to sit here and I'm going to watch the thing blow up cuz can't stand them anyhow and when the Lord didn't consume them he got more angry and then he had a little good thing like a a little plant that he set under for shade while he's waiting for this fireworks to come and then a worm eats it and kills the thing and he's more angry and the Lord says to them are you doing well to be angry and he says yes I'm doing well to be angry even unto death wow there's a lot of humanity in there but did he preach the word he did he did and they repented and that's why God sent him there but there was a lot of humanity in in there when when Elisha came and those um children came out 42 children says you know go up there Baldhead and he got offended and he got angry and he cursed them in the name of the Lord and two she beers came out and ate up 42 of them brother you shouldn't have done that but it was the humanity of it Moses he says you rebels shall I you know bring water out of this rock and he's smoke the rock a second time he shouldn't have done it that was the humanity but he was God's man and when somebody spoke against God's man they got in trouble with God but you can't help but empathize in some ways that but he did some human things he did but he have to see through the humanity to see the office that he held amen so when God decided to use man as his agent it wasn't an accident it wasn't oversight he didn't just like oops Bo I've chosen man no he knew exactly what he was doing he knew what he was getting in for he knew that the weakness and the fra of humanity was part of the package deal and really it's a filter because the elect see through the human Veil to see God behind the veil amen but it does seem a strange conundrum that God who's all powerful he's infinite he's perfect he uses the weakness of humanity the fallibility of humanity to preach his infallible word the words of eternal life are preached through a finite fallible vessel amen and those who accept it have got to actually accept that the words of this man are not the words of the man but they're the words of God Amen and that's what Paul says when you when you received my letters you received it as the word of God as it actually is in fact not as the words of a man so I've met a lot of people that are are religious but they don't want to come in line with the message and say I just believe the Bible I just believe the Bible well what the what they're saying is I believe my interpretation of the Bible for a stter but in Ephesians 4:11 it says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ unless we can receive whom he has sent we can never come to Perfection true yeah he sent he sent Ministries into the body they are there for the perfecting of the Saints without that there is no rapture amen sometimes I get a little side little rabbit hole here just a little sciency thing but you know there's there's 94 different elements in the world in in the earth and uh even this the experts say some say 90 and some say up to 98 so the experts they can't agree sometimes it's because elements can synthesize into a couple of other different elements but anyhow let's say 94 that's from hydrogen through to plutonium okay that's that's the elements that make up the everything that's here is made up of them why not get 94 jars of all these things and we need some we need some uh carbon take some carbon and we need some sulfur and if you just ate those things there that's everything that's on the earth is made up of them why don't we just do that because you would you die that's why you don't do that because it would poison you it would kill you but where we are actually made up of carbon and hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur that's the chops that's the main things that everything that is uh every living thing is made of and then there's some Trace elements of different things but you can't just take those elements and consume them and expect to live because they have to be synthesized by plants to make them into a form that we can actually digest that we can actually accept and it's the same with the word of God say I I just read the Bible and I'm no there's a way that it has to be synthesized so it's digestible in the age in which you live it's it's very very important just don't I'm just going to take the raw materials not the way she says you have to believe who whom I have sent amen I think that's a good good thing amen it all sounds uh pretty complicated if you look at the whole thing and it is complicated God is complicated but he doesn't ask us to meet him in a complicated way amen uh even you know when you eat something if you eat something maybe you eat some um protein oh young I'm just going to have a protein diet well your body's got to break that down and you can't you might eat a cow but you can't put that cow can't go into your bloodstream your your body's got to break it down back into amino acids which is just the building blocks that goes into your bloodstream then you make your own proteins so that you can live so it's got to be broken down so that it can work or the same with carbohydrates and so forth It's the breaking of those chemical bonds that actually gives us the the energy and the the strength of the day it has to be your body has to do all this but you don't have to think about it you just got to eat eat and you know when we consume the word of God it's doing lots of things that we don't really understand but all we got to do is just eat the little book and it'll do the job you know that every second of your life you produce 3 3.8 billion new cells in your body every second so you know if you're sitting here feeling tired I understand okay you're really really busy that's 330 billion new cells every day and 330 billion cell old cells they die they get stacked they get packed they get some of the components get reused but your body is really really busy right now so you know have have a bit understanding why you feel tired have a have a we CEST this afternoon because those things are taking place but you don't have to think about it and the Lord is doing great things in their life but we don't have to think about that we've just got to come to him the way that he says to come to him and the rest of it takes care of itself and I just like that he's he's incredibly complex he's doing things that we couldn't possibly understand but it's not how he says to come to him he says the scripture here in 1 Corinthians 1:21 says for after that in the wisdom of God in other words he in his wisdom arranged it this way that the World by wisdom knew not God so you can't learn enough to understand God by by wi by wisdom the world knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and God himself didn't come down and do the preaching he used vessels he took the foolishness of preaching a man comes stands behind a desk speaks the word of God some people believe it and other people don't I don't like the way that guy looks don't I don't like his tire don't like you know he's going Bal I don't know you all whatever see some can't can't see through the veil of the flesh to see the word that's coming behind it brother Brenham says in a message God and his people he said men are just men but it's God's agency God doesn't fall upon Den nominations God doesn't fall upon Mechanical Devices so he can't just click pray play um it's we should be listening to the tapes don't get me wrong but you should also be uh listening and and be active in the fellowship where where the Lord sent you um God doesn't fall upon denominations God doesn't fall upon Mechanical Devices God the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is God's agent and he says and the hardest thing that God has ever had to do I might have said this last time but you you remember this everybody know this quote what's the hardest thing that God has ever had to do and God's done some pretty hard things right and I told you what he's doing even in in our human body what's the hardest thing that God's ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another that's the hardest thing that's as far that's believing the report you know if somebody believe uh refuses to hear the messenger they will not hear the message have you ever had you're waiting on a letter to arrive waiting on a letter and you go out to the mailbox and oh the postman coming down the road no not this Postman I don't like this Postman he's not coming near my letter box well you're not going to get the letter yeah it's as simple as that if the postman's coming with the letter you got to let them come to your letter box when the message has been sent you've got to let the messenger come because if you nobody got on the ark who didn't hear Noah nobody came out of Egypt and entered into the promised land that didn't hear Moses nobody's going in the Rapture but those who hear the Rapture message from the vessel that the Lord has chosen which is the prophet in this day amen so without hearing the Messer they will not hear the message and brother renam says and the message is Christ John 13:20 says verily verily I say unto you Jesus said he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me all right uh and the world uh the word became flesh brother randman says here look this is just kind of finishing this thought of but um God through his prophet Isaiah a man who had his ups and downs like we do he made his mistake like we do but God got that man so yielded by being a prophet that his word God's thoughts Hallelujah God's thoughts expressed through those mortal lips of Isaiah a man with sin and things that I have and is ups and downs like I have like you have but a yielded vessel to God expressed the thought God's thought through word and no matter what he done Isaiah's words had to be fulfilled for it was God's thoughts expressed through Isaiah amen um you know all of the prophets and I'm going to try and skip over but here because this is a long study so I'm going to move as fast as I can but you stick with me um you think when when Moses came he he really was probably the perfect guy chosen for the job to go into Egypt he knew the language he knew the lay of the land he knew Pharaoh he knew the children of Israel um he you know he he was he was so educated that he could teach the Egyptians he he was just like he was ideal guy and when he came down and he when the Lord came down and met him in the burning bush and the Lord says I've seen all the trouble that's going on in Egypt and I have come down and I'm going to deliver them and Moses is probably like yeah praise the Lord that's I'm really really pleased because I because I'm glad to be out and I I hope that they they'll be glad to be out the Lord says Hey Moses I am come down to deliver them and behold I'm sending you oh that wasn't wasn't the part of the deal that Moses wanted to hear and Moses being the most capable for that job what do they say who me uh they they won't believe me you know uh who am I he says that I could go to Pharaoh well no one none of the other Israelites could go to Pharaoh could they Moses was brought up in the palace who am I but you know what it proved no matter how qualified we might think we are the the the fallibility the the inability of humanity is there unless God does the work unless God builds the house we build in vain it's God's work so he he he just said I'm not able and they said and by the way not only will Pharaoh not hear me but no nor will the children of Israel they won't believe me they will say your God has not spoken to you the Lord says I I know that so I'm going to give you two signs I gave him the sign when he put this rod down it became a snake and when he put his hand in his bosom and took it out was leis and he put it back and it came back again and of course the stick came back from the snake so he gave him two signs but brother renam says you know those signs were not the commission they only pointed they only Vindicated the prophet so that they would believe the commission and the commission was The Exodus come out of Egypt and enter into the promised land and even Moses didn't take them into the promised land but as message sure did Joshua he just continually said as the Lord God commanded Moses as the Lord God commanded of Moses Joshua didn't have any new message he just said the same thing that the prophet said and we're doing exactly the same when the prophet came in this day and he preached let just backtrack a little bit when the angel of Lord came to brother Brenham and said you're sent with a message what did Brother Brenham say they won't believe me it was just a constant the prophets all said that they won't believe me he said as Moses given two signs you'll be given two signs yeah sign in the hand and then the discernment to know what was in the hearts and he said Moses was actually given three signs and brother brandham was given three three PS to his ministry Moses the first two were unto believing those the the stick that became a snake and the hand that was leprous and was healed but he says but if they won't believe the voice of those signs and they won't hearken to your voice then take the water out of the river and pour it out and it'll become blood it was judgment it was the water of Separation because the first two un believing but if they didn't believe it's judgment brother says warning then judgment and the same things happened in the message in this day there's two signs that brother Brandon was given the the sign in the hand as I said and the discernment but if people didn't believe those signs they certainly didn't get the message the third poll is the opening of the word it's only for the Believers the Bible says that it is a secret to the to the bride the reason the secret is because everybody else has walked away and only those that stayed to look upon that pyramid Rock remember when he took the top off he said not many stayed to look amen but we've stayed to look and that's why it's a secret it wasn't that it was unavailable to everybody else but they didn't stay to look because they didn't believe the first two signs so they can't receive from the third amen ah it's it's a a mystery that's been open to us amen the little book is open in this day we're not just to look on the little book I said we need to eat the little book so that all of the goodness from that which is the Life of Christ can be made manifest through us you can't work out how it's going to work you just got to eat the little book and it'll work out brother R says don't just come this far and say I believe the message you obey the messenger whoa did he say that that's how he said it don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ you say well I believe every word said brother Bram he said that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you when I see that I will pass over you amen the life that is in the word himself the power of almighty God must come into the bride before the Rapture can take place and he says here in the rising of the sun Satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine wow that means message Doctrine believe serpent seed believes in the see how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches youve belong to or will belong to it doesn't make matter one thing unless you have been born again amen going to fog one of these Waters here is that right now one thing a lot of people don't think this way but everybody is actually a Believer and something everybody believes somebody in something because if people don't believe God's word they will believe Satan's lie when Jesus was here some believed him and some followed him and others didn't believe him but the ones that didn't believe him they did believe the scribes and Pharisees and Jesus said because I tell you the truth you do not believe me because I tell you the truth in other words if somebody comes tell you a lie you will believe that but because I tell you the truth the truth just doesn't gel with you so you can't believe it but to the to the elect it was precious amen some people are predisposed to believe the truth and some are predisposed to reject the truth and as I said earlier we don't even know of ourselves which camp we would be in until we're presented with the word and then we say you know what I believe that so well no one else around me believes but but I there's something in me I just not I hear that voice it's like man that just Rings true to me see and that's why we're here today amen but it also tells us a lot about ourselves it tells us where we come from it tells us our origin it tells us who our father is amen it tells us which camp we belong to and it shows us where we're going so I'm glad about that but believing is not just agreeing with the word you know you could meet a drunk man on the road and he's drunk as drunk can be and you can say to him that's killing you he says I believe you but it doesn't do anything about it see believing is not just agreeing if he really believed he say I need help I have to I've got to get a away from us I just never go where we're alcohol is anymore see that would be believing not just agreeing see so it's not just believing in God that's important it's believing God and believing God when he speaks through the or that he chooses to speak through amen so to believe in God Satan believes in God you the Bible says that and he trembles the Devils they believe in God and tremble so not believing in God it's very different from believ in God believing in prophets is very different from believing the prophet to believe in pastors is very different from believing your pastor to receive from the Lord we must be able to believe uh that the chosen vessel we must place our confidence confidence in the in the chosen vessel that the Lord has placed for us brother says if we don't we can't actually receive any help from that vessel I'll read it to you here he said that's the reason your pastor can't do nothing for you you've got to have faith in him this as a man remember we talked about how how fallible humanity is now maybe not brother ELR but men in general okay just think about it that that we all are that we're just we're just made the same we have the same issues to deal with the reason your pastor can't do nothing for you you've got to have faith in him and confidence in him as a man of God but I know this you've got to have confidence in the man you're dealing with or it won't do you any good to do any dealing that's true you've got to believe your pastor he's a good God saved man preaching the gospel stand behind him with everything you got if he isn't go somewhere where they do do it that's right now that clears it up for both sides now remember this if he preaches the gospel stay with him help him cuz he's a man of sent from God ordained of God to feed your soul amen we should be like uh Aaron and her you know they held up moses' hands do something actually to support the cause to let the devil know at least which side you're on Amen every now and again when something stirs your heart let the you know let it be known which side you're on brother bam says here talking about a ball game he says it's football season season the thing we want to do is not everybody try and take the ball away from the man that's got it that's right is he says try and guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal amen so and this is not a sports game it is The Game of Life if you like but this is not a practice run this this is their one chance we want to make sure that we run this race with all that's in US amen so somebody's going to believe this report that we've received in this last days to finish this for that the Rapture can come on the Bible says that all of the rest of the saints that have gone on Hebrews 11 he talks about all the ones The Heroes of Faith he says they could not be made perfect without us we have to finish this course amen the whole plan of God is is reliant on and waiting on every last member of the body of Christ to be ready yeah that's why brother brandom in the preview of the Bride he says uh stay in line stay in line he said they were starting to step out of Line Stay in line stay in line with the with the message that's been sent our part in this whole program every single one is you think what is the value of your life what what are you worth oh I've got so many dollars to my name no no that's not it brother says our life we're worth 10,000 worlds but but even if we if we valued ourselves we think we're particularly important we're 15,000 worlds okay well there's no no such thing I come on um but whatever we value our life to be it's our position is more important than that because the whole program of God is riing on every last member being ready so the weakest Christian is more important than they could possibly imagine because everybody else is waiting am and all through history they're waiting for the last one to be ready amen now is everybody still with us okay got a we way to go but where I trust this is kind of I wanted to build all that so we can say what I'm going to say now but brother B says there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms in all of the universe only two powers and that's God's power and that's Satan's power I'll read it to you here out of the greatest battle ever 40 say do you realize that there's really only two powers in all the universe and there's only two kingdoms those Powers is God's power and Satan's power and everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power because that's the only two Powers there is That's The Power of life and the power of death and he says and Satan's power is is not really a real power it's a perverted power it's the perversion of God's power everything that Satan has death is only a perversion of Life Li a lie is only the truth must told adultery the righteous act misused everything that Satan has is something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today s sitting here and one or other power is going to control us amen and and God's kingdom is everything that's good and everything that's lovely and everything that's Eternal that's God's kingdom and Satan's kingdom is everything that's per perverted dishonest hateful and everything which must die two kingdoms and the moment that something fell from its original from the original word of God it fell from God's Eternal Kingdom and it fell into Satan's kingdom it fell from life to death uh Genesis 2:17 Jes uh the Lord says for the day that you eat thereof that day Thou shalt surely die it fell from being Everlasting to now death and in Romans 6 uh 16 it says know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness and then down to verse 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen now in the Book of Ruth it talks about that there was another Kinsman closer than than the Lord another Kinsman closer than Jesus you think how can that be but the reason was that when Humanity had fallen we fell into Satan's kingdom and he said look what I got he said I all the kingdoms of the Earth are mine yeah and that's exactly the way that was Satan could rightfully claim that the mess of humanity was his doing we would say ra he had the intellectual property rights he could say I actually caused all this the mess of hybrid humanity is my fault and Satan was right it was his fault and the fact that when it when anything fell from God's kingdom it lands squarely into into Satan's kingdom and it's Outcast from the presence of God and it's destined to perish it's destined to be destroyed but before it's destroyed it falls from God's kingdom it falls into Satan's scrap Heap kingom Kingdom and it stays there until it dies till it's eliminated gone but fortunately before we got cast out we got redeemed and that's why his kingdom was there because we fell from God's kingdom we fell there he says but I'm not going to leave it there because brother R talks about the moment that Adam and Eve walked out of the Garden of Eden God called after them he says uh I'm going to put enmity between thy seed and his seed and and and he's going to he'll bruise my heel but I'll bruise his head brother says he promising a savior he couldn't let them go out without promising them I'm going to redeem this it's okay it's going to come back it's going to work out in the end all right so as I said when when the devil first started tempting Jesus he he he says you know change the stones into bread and so forth and cast your down uh the angels will pick the up and so forth but then he says all poers given unto me all poers been delivered unto me I read it here out of Luke 4:5 it says the devil taketh him up to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it the if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine and Jesus answered and said get thee behind me Satan for it is written there shall Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve yeah so he had fallen a to all the kingdoms of the world but when Jesus died he came to buy it back he came to redeem it and when he comes and he died on the cross and he went down into hell and he says give me the keys of hell and death and Satan says but i f an ear to it I fell ear to to all of humanity and and Jesus said yeah but I came to redeem I'm not coming just as an ear I'm coming to buy it back and I've already paid the price and I'm here to redeem what was mine in the first place and brother R says he brought back ownership of the whole world when he did that he claimed his bride but he actually claimed ownership of the whole world and that's why when it comes to the time of the Judgment he is the judge of Heaven on Earth because he owns the whole lot he bought it back now Satan was a nearer Kinsman and he had the first right of redemption and when when when Lord Jesus went down and he say give me the keys Satan could rightfully say but I'm a near Kinsman and he was but when it came to paying the price of redemption he couldn't do that firstly he didn't have a sinless life obviously the devil doesn't have a sinless life and he also couldn't pay the price because if he had given his life he couldn't raise it up again it's just like there's just no way and part of the package deal was to get the bride and she was always been a problem to Satan so he didn't want her either because it was going to Mar his kingdom which it certainly would because we've always believed in God and he doesn't like that so he said okay I can't do the redeeming I'm going to have to leave it up to you and Jesus said thank you very much and I'll take the keys of hell and death and he redeemed Us Praise the Lord all right you know brother B tells us that Satan when Jesus was even dying on the cross he he couldn't really believe who Jesus was it's like he must be just another one of the prophets you know when he was tempting him he said if there be the Son of God if there be the Son of God but when he was on the cross and he's God wouldn't let this happen to him but he was fully he's fully submitted to the heavenly father fully submitted to the Eternal will yeah and he says when he died the devil stung with the the the bee of death brother random says but then he ripped out the Stinger of death Jesus did and he says that's why Paul could say death where is you know the where is the sting and so forth It's Gone amen all right so who we believe identifies the kingdom to which we belong now it might seem an easy thing to say um why does everybody just choose life why does everybody just choose good you know everybody wants their neighbor to do good well why doesn't everybody just choose good but it's not quite there simple because the whole thing right from the beginning was that Satan is a deceiver he he perverts things and he deceives the people they actually think they're doing the right thing and Cain thought he was doing the right thing right in the beginning Satan's not an originator he just chose to pervert what God makes and the moment he perverts something he gets it think about that if he Mars it it falls to his kingdom so he's been busy doing that forever that's what he's trying to do it reminds me of a sign I saw s of that's in a shop it says lovely to look at delightful to hold if you break it consider it sold but Satan if he can ruin something he gets it it falls into his kingdom and he's been doing that all along yeah that's what he tries to do now this battle that started in heaven and is now on Earth is not about who has the greatest power and I wanted to say this so we get this this clear you think there's a battle between God and and Satan going on who is the greatest power it's not even in the equation because Satan is just a an ant compared to God it's just nothing but the thing is that the Lord set it up so it's actually an even competition it's an even battle but yet Satan has no power compared to God and it's not about who is the most powerful and I want to have a look at that just in a second the reason that that caused it to be an even battle is because something that God did himself in the beginning and what he did was he made a partnership with man brother ROM says he said you're going to be part of this equation You and Me Against him well that weakened God's argument considerably you know you make a partnership with somebody who's not very strong it weakens your position quite considerably because for God to achieve his ultimate gain uh goal he has to have every one of us elect on side and Satan's like them like you guys you you are going to be perfect before the Rapture that's what the Lord said you're going to be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing then the Rapture Satan's going like whatever no chance this is going to be easy right but God God does does he does he does he think he's stronger than God no he doesn't think he's stronger than God but he knows humanity and he thinks this is actually a pretty easy competition now and I'm in I'm going to take this fight on now because although God's his creator he thinks the argument has been so weakened because of you and me but you know what God remembers the future yeah and he looked at you and said actually they're going to stand and when the pressure when the enemy comes in like a flood is that going to raise up and be a standard like wow he already knows see Satan can't remember the future yeah but we can remember the future Lucifer when he started off he wanted to if you read Isaiah 14 it says that he wanted to exalt himself he wanted to ascend above the stars of God he wanted to be above you that's what it says in Isaiah he wanted to be like the most high but he wanted to be above you the stars of God but if you get over into Thessalonians there it says wants to actually be uh says who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God oh now his real purpose is coming out he wants to be in the place of God and that's exactly what the World Church is trying to achieve amen so it's not by who's most powerful it's not by who gets the the majority of the votes god brother brandom says God don't count numbers he counts character so it's not uh what everybody else on the world is is doing it's the bride the the the position that we hold and the the the importance of this position cannot be overemphasized because the Lord has to achieve in his bride what he said he will achieve or there will be no Rapture the elect the sons of God the stars of God must and will respond to the word in their day and God has by his full knowledge he has predestinated them to that amen Jesus said of these he said I will not lose one I will not lose one everyone's going to be there and he's committed himself to that amen and brother Ram says if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is the word made manifest he said you'll see the message of the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it but there has to be something light that off inspiration has to strike you amen and that's taking place and I believe each one of us and I believe little sister being baptized today um just a few days ago I got a a photo that my mom actually had and it's of me when I was baptized I was seven years old brother rid s baptized me in the river in gbon and uh I know now I know as I'm coming up 59 in a couple of days time but I was sincere then as I've ever been in my life and the Lord's keeping power can keep you all the way through your life amen you commit your life into his hand you don't need to know how it all works out you don't need to be well sus all these things out just say put your life in his hands and it all works out amen all right I'm going to just skip ah head a little bit here yes so Satan thinks of this the Lord's never going to be able to do this but um the Lord's already seen the picture he's already seen you he's already seen the sons of God shouting for Joy saying praise God we here oh praise God it's great to see you again I knew we'd be here job and everybody else because the Lord says Jo Where Were You When the sons of God shattered for Joy job say I don't remember that but uh yeah God seen it amen God always intended brother Bram STS to dwell in mankind there was always his intention it was God above us the Creator it became when Jesus came god with us but he wants to be God in us he wants to have the preeminence in us and the prophet says that Satan knew that from the beginning that God wanted to dwell in humanity and Satan being a copycat he wanted to do the same but he couldn't get into Humanity Satan couldn't he could get into animals which he did through the serpent like he did at the swine at gadara but he couldn't get into Humanity so God somehow let Satan learn about the fact that he could get into the animals and that's where Satan come up with this plan in the Garden of Eden he said if I can make them both human and animal I can get into them and that's what he did so when he inspired the serpent to interbreed with Humanity all from then on all of humanity has been part animal and part human and Satan has been able to get into that Fallen Humanity ever since it made a pathway that he could get in brother R it says in a message it's Ephesian Church age now Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest that's what we was supposed to be the place of God's rest if I just say this brother ad says that in the Millennium Lord Jesus going to sit on his own throne but the Bible says that right now he sits on his father's throne and then brother BR says you know where his father's Throne is is in the human heart that's where he wants to dwell through the church ages he wants to be in the human heart amen and since the opening of the seals he you being able to do that that's where he wants to be to resting in the human heart Satan has known this all along and he wants to indwell man I'm going to read this quote here to you even as God does but God has reserved to himself that right Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh which was in Jesus Satan could could not and cannot do that he does not have creative Powers he Satan can't make a body for himself to step into like Jesus did the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted was uh wanted to do was to enter into the serpent in Eden even as he entered by the evil spirits into the swine at gadara God does not enter into animals but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he uh Satan could not have a child directly by Eve as God did by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled Eve and seduced her and by her did Satan have a child vicariously Satan uh Cain was born the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristics of the serpent now wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of the wicked one he was all right now Cain was actually a Believer he believed in God he spoke to God he didn't believe God yeah um and I read just a couple more things it's quite an important little part I want to get to here so I know it's a little bit longer and I said to brother it's a little bit of a longer study but stick with me I trust you'll be blessed I normally preach pretty short so I'm sorry I this a little bit longer than normal but I I want to get to this um this point here and I trust that's a blessing to you so just as Cain and Abel they also came together in a clash brother R says and them being Brothers both of them came of the same mother and we find that they realized that they were mortal they've been put out of life and put out of the garden of life and they were both trying to find a way to get back in there both Abel Cain and Abel were both trying to find how can I get back to life cuz I'm getting old I'm hey this this is this is not going to work we're going to die at this rate we got to find a way to get back so both finding a way to get back if you notice both boys were very religious Cain was just as religious as Abel was they both built altars otherwise a church they both made a sacrifice they both prayed they both served God both of them but one of them served him wrong he says now you can be ever so sincere and yet be wrong there's a way that seeth right but the end the D the ways of death and then if we read in Genesis it says the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Canaan his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art th wroth and why is our countenance Fallen if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door so Cain firstly he was very religious he believed in God the one true and living God the creator of Heaven and Earth he was the first to sacrifice to God he was sincere he made an offering that was beautiful he put a lot of effort into it he was he did it sincerely he built this altar to the Lord but when the Lord didn't appreciate his sacrifice and his offering he was very very upset he couldn't understand why that would be but then just to make matters worse he says his brother is offering he's setting up his altar his church and he's going to make a sacrifice to the Lord and he watches on and he sees his brother going and get a little lamb out of the flock a beautiful little lamb a perfect little lamb yeah and he ties it up and he puts it on his Altar and Kane's like what's he doing and then he sees Abel get a sharp Stone and hack at this lamb on its throat and Blood starts spting out and blood's going every he's like what are you doing what are you doing this the first time they'd ever seen anything die something had died previous cuz that's where Adam and Eve got the skins that God clothes them in but it's the first time and you know the message that we believe is this horrific to other people he sees and he's cutting his throat blood's going it would have gone all over Abel and I think Abel would have been crying because it was it was a sad thing that Abel was realizing that his sins were being there was a sacrifice being made on his behalf for his sin by the life of an innocent substitute yeah and he say probably is crying saying but God has revealed to me that this is his way and this is his plan that an innocent substitute had to die in my place and Cain he was speechless he was just that is the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life and then if that wasn't bad enough then God comes down and God says Abel I accept your sacrifice I have respect for that your sins are covered you did the right thing and he walks straight past Cain's offering and says nothing and Cain is beside himself with anger he's angry at God he's angry at his brother he's so frustrated look look at my beautiful sacrifice and his a mess and everybody's covered in blood and and the lamb was bleeding and kicking and died it seemed like the genuine message was horrific but it was the truth and it delivered him and that was the part that God because God accepted that that seemed to be the hardest thing Cain went away in a rage but then after a little while he thought and brother R says he did think on the thought of coming back to God and God said to him if you just do what your brother has done won't you also be accepted and the prophet tells us that God would have accepted him if he had come that way he says Cain was very religious and he thought on the thought of coming back to God and God was willing to receive him back but Cain wanted to come his way and God wanted him to come his way we find out there was a conflict completely with them amen and the Lord said to Kain if you don't do what your brother has done if you don't come that way he said sin Li at the door now we could say that every one of us Prophet tells us we're born in sin shaped in in iniquity come into the world speaking lies and Kane certainly was that he was a liar he said to God you know God said where's where's your brother he said I don't know so he knew of course he'd killed him but so he was all that but the sin that lith at the door that was not what the Lord was talking about that sin he was saying sin is unbelief right he said if you turn down the Vindicated word then there will come a time where you've crossed the line and you never even believe anymore you won't be able to believe anymore and that's exactly what Cain did because the moment that he he saw that that what Abel had was the Vindicated word for the hour God came down and proved it there was no doubt in Cain's in Cain's mind that that God had accepted Abel's sacrifice but he said but I'm not going to do it and he was cast out from the presence of the Lord Brother said the mark of the beast was put on him right then he was cast out of the pres of God forever because he crossed the line he saw the Vindicator word of the hour and said I'm not going to do it and that sin that was lying at the door then became a reality he goes out he kills his brother he he walks out he doesn't even believe God anymore God could speak to him he doesn't believe a word of it he said I'm going to make my own church and that's what he did and this should be good enough that's and that's the way that he went Cain thought that he was right he thought that he'd done all his religion he went to church he said his prayers he paid his ties he did a few extra dollars here he belonged to to the one the fine Church all a beautiful flowers and everything that's the way the devil's got the church today there a scripture says because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause God shall send a strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned to believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness the prophet says that Kan he went out uh seek uh he went out a willful sinner a willful sin he deliberately went out from the presence of Lord after it been Vindicated and then he says here and the true Easter seal Cain as much said here's what I've put together this is what I've got here's what I give you take this or leave this either one you want to do you just suit yourself that say he's talking to God that's the kind of attitude of people all the time in church life the Propet says they go to church I'll go to church I'll help the church I'll do this and if God can't accept that that's the best I can do take it or leave it w those people when they when they see The Vindicator word for this day and walk away from it you think how come people walk away from the message and they never come back because they cross a line that's if it's been proved by God and then they walk away from I'm not willing to do that the cross line now that's not backsliding and I'll just look at that in a second but here in John uh 12:37 speaking of Jesus said though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him that the saying of oah the Prophet might be fulfilled when he spake Lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed remember Nicodemus said we know that there are a teacher come from God that's a Sanhedrin they knew the people they knew that it was the The Miracles and so forth were of God but a willful sinner and they crossed the line they could not believe brother R says here ministers whoever you are I say this with Godly love you see it you know it's the truth and turn away from it he said there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a fearful looking for the judgment and the fiery indignation which shall Devour the adversary a man came to brother brandom says but I know it's right brother Brandon but if I did that I'd get kicked out of my church he said what of it he said if you don't they're going to kick you out up there so you've got to be kicked out somewhere so we're making a choice that's what we're doing all right so the whole world right now is waiting for the final we're waiting for the the final outcome of this whole battle and we're in the middle excuse me we're in the middle of it we we we cannot escape and say I just don't want to I just don't want to be involved because we're involved but yet the prophet tells us that the bride a manifestation of the power you know it said who hath believed their report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord is the power of almighty God because it's his life on display brother said that is going to be displayed in the bride just before the Rapture the power of almighty God is going to be displayed he said the Earth is crying and groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the world is waiting for the man to come back to his right estate and then in praying here in the indictment he says may there come forth a Revival of the just says 963 and the power come among the church just before it's going it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we're looking Lord for that third pole that we know will do great things for us in our midst amen and brother renon when he's talking about the third pole here he's not talking about the opening of the word which happened in 1963 he's talking about the manifestation of the third pole which was the spoken word back in humanity again the creative power of Jehovah God was manifest to us through a man that's the power that's the arm of the Lord being made manifest that's the arm of the Lord being revealed in a human vessel creation when he spoke Scrolls into existence who creates but God but he said but when you say with the squirrels will be and that's where they'll be said I'll have a squirrel over there have another one over there another one over there the squirrels came into existence the creative power of Jehovah God the resurrection little fish he says you speak to the little fish and give it back its life brother R says little fishy in the name of Jesus Christ to give you back your life thing flipped over it insides came in went back inside again and it swam off it went like that each of these things control of nature he says you speak to the storm storm go away let the sun shine for 4 days till we get out of here and that's the way it took place salvation for hot's two sons and the miracle healing for sister media from the tumor before the doctor's hand touches her the tumor will be gone and that's why it was I want to say this though each one of those manifestations five manifestations of the the spoken word in a human vessel brother REM says it was just done so that it would identify it its present but it won't be used in a great way until until the squeeze comes on and just before the catching away then the power the arm of almighty God will be manifest in the bride amen we're right on the brink of that now we're right there but each time there they were sovereignly given yes brother Bram didn't look at the little fish and go I feel sorry for the little fish and I'll pray maybe the Lord will no absolutely not it was absolutely sovereignly given because the mind was not the mind of a man the mind was the mind of God he was identifying a uh uh something that is a reality he says it's just being it's been done now so it's identified it's in existence but it won't be used in a great way until just before the catching away amen that's the full manifestation of the sons of God that's what we're looking for that's why you know when it says in the uh in the great white Throne judgment says that the bride sits with him with him in his throne that means that she actually is the judge with him of Heaven and Earth that sounds like the arm of God to me the power and the justice of almighty God it's vested in his bride Amen brother REM says oh if the church only knew its position that's right it will one day when the manifestation of the third Paul happens it'll be obvious who you are absolutely it will one day it's not so it might happen no if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is and when that manifest of the third pole or of the spoken word takes place in the bride I can tell you what the five foolish virgin will come knocking on your door so we want that oil but right now they don't but the same word that has that power is what we're feeding on that's the body word that we're feeding on it has that power in it but he says it's not going to be used in a great way to right at the end the full manifestation of who is and who isn't is going to be made known at that time amen we want to make sure we're inside the ark when the door closes on the ark because the five foolish virgin are going to say hey give us that oil we'll say it's on the tapes go and go and you know get it for yourself amen all right I think the right at this moment we're just coming towards the close now we're finally getting there but um right at this time the five foolish virgin think that the five wise virgins are a little bit too precious about the message you just take it too seriously it's life and death you know when the Bible talks about those that go out weeping and wailing nashing of teeth that's that's the foolish virgin that's not the lost that's the the foolish virgin go they go out weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth CU they know they had the message in their hand and they let it slip away and the only place for them to be for the Thousand Years the rest of the Dead live not for th years is in Hell brother Brandon brings that there's no other place for them to be and that's why when it comes to judgment they are actually given eternal life in the end they come up in the judgment and it says the righteous come up with the wicked to the Judgment but it's not the bride because the bride's with Christ in the throne so those that some of them that'll come up they are actually righteous they will be given eternal life at that time but in the meantime there's nowhere else for them to be because the bride's gone on the Rapture and and Armageddon will be here 3 and a half years later which kills all things nothing lives through that the prophet said so just remember the third pole in Noah's time the door was closed on the ark so we said we'd like to see the manifestation of the third pole but when it does it's it the door's closed so now is the hour of Salvation little sister giving a heart to the Lord and being baptized so praise the Lord the door's still open but it's probably starting to squeak on its hinges because it's it's time is running out when Jesus his third pole is preaching to the souls in prison they couldn't be saved amen time had run out for them so I just want to say as we close let let's not be on that side of the Ledger let's make sure that we do everything we can to say I believe his word I don't just say I agree with his word I believe it I want that to come into me have an outworking and everything in my life everything is will completely sold out the bride has no mind of her own but his mind what he says his word that goes and if we have that attitude because it is all really about attitude if we have the right attitude to his word it will do the right thing in our being and have it right outworking amen a love for the truth not it's the truth I love the truth you know something that we we say often in our home and it just comes up in conversation I'm so thankful for the message you see things going on in the world and we just say I'm I'm so thankful for the message we wouldn't know we we would be doing the wrong thing I wouldn't know I'm so thank that you know what that is that's a love for the truth and you hear yourself say things like you think I'm glad that I it just come from the inside I'm just so glad hear that amen we can be that resting place for almighty God he's looking for that and his ride that he reason he made you the reason he made me is for Fellowship true a lonely God wants to fellowship with his bride amen let's do that we do that through his word amen and then one day we'll walk together hand in hand through the paradise of God and say it's been worth it all amen amen so who has believed their report and to whom is the armor of the Lord revealed only to his bride amen what a privilege amen God bless you each one sorry of holding a little longer brother AR will hand back over to you now just think of the fact that you know all of those saints that have gone on they're waiting us to finish the course so let's run well and finish the course amen God bless you brother God praise the Lord it wasn't really that long brother Tony thank you we I really enjoyed it really appreciate the word um I was just thaning the the things brother Tony was sharing against the background of some of the of the things we've been speaking about we've been spending a lot of time on the on the seventh seal in Revelation chap 5 and 10 and um I was I was just thinking about you know how the book that we get is really it's Dominion it's about our restoring our position on this Earth and um I made the statement a few a few weeks ago that God's intention was for the bride to reign here on Earth for man to reain here on Earth but not just be in control of Earth like Satan is in control of Earth Earth now in Satan's Eden but in a way where we where we where we um take this Dominion by the spoken word and when the book is back in the hand of the Bride it's now the bride um ruling this Earth by the spoken word that's really what it's what it's coming back to so thankful for that God God bless you richly my brother I really appreciate that amen let's stand [Music] together so um we'll go get ready for the
