things in the most Wonder wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen wonder if I could ask you to sit for a for a few minutes if you don't mind musicians I'm going to keep you here for just a little bit I mean now um I know many of you have already caught up with that please forgive me let me just get my bearings together praise the Lord but we had a wonderful Camp uh a a exceptionally special special time the Lord was so gracious to us and and by God's grace um and and I want to say thank you for your praise I know that many have been praying we've been praying over the last few months and asking the Lord to come on the scene and really there was not a single issue that that stands out that was a major issue um by God's grace everything went well that the atmosphere was lovely the the preaching was was wonderful God kept his hand over us in so many ways you know even down to on the Saturday we it the weather was terrible but we didn't need good weather because we had we had um activities that we were doing indoors and then when it came to the outdoors activities and and the the swimming and water sliding and all of that stuff it was scorching hot so the Lord had his hand in everything we just thank the Lord for it and just just I want to say an exceptionally special time so I have a thankful heart um to the Lord and just really really thankful for answered prayer so we've had a few services with with Michael now last Wednesday you had the privilege and I'm I believe a few of you have been streaming over the weekend we've um we've had I think Saturday's service um nearly 420 or so so streams which is unusual for for our church um obviously we made those those um Services Public um and for all the other services also hundreds of people um streaming and I and I trust that it was a blessing and I also trust that people received everything that was said in context and the Lord was just really good to us in just so many ways um so tonight is goodbye to Michael um we'll have toita and the kids here still on Sunday but um God willing he's flying up to brother Tony's on Saturday to minister there and then from there he'll be heading out um by next week so uh tonight we we want to drag everything out of him he's nice and tired so just keep on sucking him dry amen pulling praise the Lord we're just looking forward to that I just thought I would give you uh a little bit of a feel for how Camp went um just by sharing just not I'm not going to take a long time but just four or five pictures that I want to just put up here so let's see if that works praise the Lord so there's the the camp group um I think this this includes most people so in the end we our numbers were just right it was just comfortable it was um it was you know enough people to make it to make it special but not so many that that we couldn't have contact with everyone so there was just a lovely atmosphere and I'll just put this one up just to emphasize the backdrop we could we could actually sit inside the church Hall and watch over that bay there and um by God's grace it wasn't a distraction from the services but just a wonderful wonderful atmosphere there lovely time um there's a picture of Michael ministering and the other the other Youth Camp Minister brother T was gracious to to fulfill that role at short notice so we just thank him for that there's a picture in case you think this looks a little strange we doing Father Abraham so this I think would be the chin up looking at everyone there um so then um we had this is the the gym Hall where the activities took place and so on so I just thought I would put a picture of that up and I deliberately put my Camp vest on here we identified all the counselors and and advisers with vests like this and it really really worked well because from a distance you knew exactly who was who and so on so that was that was really good and then lastly on the and I hope this is going to work um this little video will work but on the last morning I got an inspiration and I realized because okay so let me tell you the back story I had um you know started to to um you know just put things in place so that we we be able to pack up easily and so on so I had carried one of those polene containers along and drummed on it and I realized this is a really good drum so so then during during the um the we just had a singing and testimony service that last morning I S them grab all the poling containers and then we had a whole bunch of drummers in the uh in the group so this is what it looked like hopefully this works had a lot of fun praise the Lord anyway so thank you thank you very much for everyone's love and support over the last few weeks and so on it's um we obviously came back really tired shame as I I'm going to give away a secret but as we were driving out of thei I saw Joseph scar parked next to the road and having a sleep and I think there was a few of us that was Keen to do that but um by God's grace it's uh it's been so just worth the while we also have another goodbye tonight Grace is I think this is your last service here now Grace she's from Brother Barry coffe Church all the way from the us so we also want to say God bless you was lovely to have you please take our love to brother Barry and the Saints there and we're looking forward to see you again sometime so that's all I want to share right now I don't want to take more time um so as we call Michael up to come Minister let's sing one more song I have decided to follow Jesus actually actually let's do the camp version so Michael you come up and uh help song Lead this one I have decided to follow Jesus I have have decided to follow my Lord I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow my Lord no more turning no more turning back no more turning no more turning back no more turning no more turning back no more turning no more turning back the cross before me the World Behind behind me the

world but give me my Lord no more turning no more turning back no more turning no more turning back no more turning no more turning back no more turning no more turning back amen amen I trust that is also going to be the the implanted desire of every youth member after this Camp uh you know we really had a real special time you know the youth were so openhearted they it just really was a privilege and honor to preach to them they yeah they I believe as much as maybe they had something from the ministry we also in return got something really special and I've made so many friends now you know I'm looking over the orchestra and just some beautiful memories will linger forever just such a great team and I think uh LED so well by uh ALR and I believe the spirit of the church really came through because you could just see there was just such a desire for Unity and to to look out for each other and you know to Bear each other's burdens where it was necessary and there was just a beautiful spirit of Harmony and just it went so well so we just want to really say thank the Lord I really feel he came through in a mighty way and as our brother Al said or Al I know he doesn't like to be called brother um you know I believe it's the prayers of the saints that really made the difference and thank you all for that and it's been a privileged to know you I'm feeling so much more just relaxed now because uh you know half of the people you are now become friends and you know it's just um the Lord has just got a beautiful family of God and it it spread it spreads through the whole world and it was just such a privilege to get to know you all and uh you'll be dear to our hearts when we go back but thank you for opening up your arms thank you for being so kind and we really felt the love so God bless you all amen so yeah I think we'll we'll move on thank you musicians thank you for all the support the song leader got to know brother Michael here also pretty well my name's sake so I know he's a good guy already just by his name you know so uh but uh yeah we had a good time by God's grace and we just want to preach maybe a bit more I don't know if I'm going to be some preaching I might just do a bit more on the teaching side but we'll see how the Lord goes but you know as we said last week Sunday you know we called to to overcome our in all aspects of Our Lives you know we we obviously definitely are preaching that you know God sent a prophet we're definitely preaching that um you know you need to get the Holy Ghost those are all those things but you know we got all these tools that that came via the prophet and he showed so many wonderful tools so that we can really conquer things in all facets of our Liv so we don't want to miss out anything so it as I said it might be a bit more of a teaching but I believe by God's grace it can really help us because you're really in a in a in a r says this a neurotic age it's a it's so much there's so much mental distress and pressure upon us and you know even if you can live in such a calm place as New Zealand no doubt you'll feel even things from the outside coming in you know the the wars and all those things that's going on the the different uh you know pressures of the economies and Etc so so we need to we need to make sure that we watch ourselves that we we guard ourselves we guard our minds so that's what I want to preach on tonight I'm going to be preaching on as a man thinketh amen cuz it's so important that we control the the the tower up here because the tower up here uh is going to channel things down into the heart and yes we we believe in the Holy Ghost seeding that heart but still we know there's still a faith and a doubt that sits there and if you're going to accommodate the doubt too much that Faith man is going to get smaller and smaller amen so let the Lord just help us uh through these things and may the Lord just give the inspiration where it's needed so we're going to be turning to 2 Corinthians 10 if you can just turn to your Bible 2 Corinthians chapter 10 I also will have a displayed for those that need it amen a very well-known scripture but sometimes you can just see a little bit further than what meets the eye and let's by God's grace dig into these things amen I believe we're there 2 Corinthians 10: 3-5 it reads is thus and brother you can go to the next slide for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the Flesh and we're talking with the youth you know we have to make sure that we realize we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers you know and we must understand see the spirit behind the thing that is driving it we made a little analogy it's like a a driver behind a wheel and if the car hits a pedestrian and hurts them we don't prosecute the car even though the car did the damage we prosecute the driver so let's make sure we always keep our our mind where it should be because there is spirits that unfortunately can get upon us if we're not careful and it can do harm to to obviously our walk with God and to those around us amen for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds now what are some of these strongholds casting down imaginations that's some of these things that can come into us and upon us and every High thing what that exalt vth itself against the knowledge of God so anything that can come against what we know to be truth is a problem this thing is trying to push itself above what we need to make sure is embedded in us and fortified and confirmed and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of God Amen and this is most certainly No Easy Task you know the devil we're talking about how the devil can throw thoughts inside of you over the camp and you know sometimes you really just have to make sure that you you allow the spirit of God to to control those thoughts and to help you to identify because the devil's clever he doesn't just s like they say just come in straight with a bad thought he often will build it up little by little little and it just gets higher and higher before you know it you deep into things you should have never been in the first place but that's the devil but we trust by God's grace we'll be able to identify some of these things let's close our eyes dear heavenly father we just want to truly commit the service into your hands saying Lord God we are nothing without you we are but just weak flesh Lord and we know that we need a God that's Lord all powerful all knowing and Lord has quickening power that can be spoken upon this service Lord so may you speak quickening power upon this service may you Quicken me Quicken the people may we just have a portion from you we ask in Jesus precious name amen amen you may be seated if you don't mind I'll be taking also off my jacket amen so yeah as all said we all a little bit tender we all tired but amen we'll try not to keep everyone too long and uh hopefully be out pretty soon but um yeah these things are important we sure want to make sure we we don't forget these important parts which is part of the Christian Living and to help us so Romans 12 2:3 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed so how does this happen how how can we not how do we avoid to be conformed and rather be transformed but how does it happen by the renewing of your mind mind how that you may be that you may prove what is is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God CU God desires this of us that we will renew our mind that we will watch our thoughts for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is upon you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly CU that's often the first thing the devil will come and you can see just in the Garden of Eden what does he do he tries to offer Eve something bigger you'll be like unto God so one of the first things when it's things that try and lift you above where you should be where we should just be humble and just really under the the humility of the Holy Spirit allowing him and his thoughts to dominate our mind in the way we think but to think soberly according to God uh as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith amen so your mind now your mind is not your your brain it's two different two different things you know as much as we know the brain is obviously what houses the mind the brain is the actual organ but the brain has the ability to think and that is the mind and as we know the mind is also linked to the spirit realm so we talk about the mind it's the spirit realm and there's obviously joinings between the flesh the spirit and the soul and they all are influencing each other so we must understand it's like gateways as we move on so brother bam says God chose the heart where he would make sure he got to because he knows if he can first of all save you that is what counts but the devil also knows if he can get into the mind it can affect the heart and it can confuse the heart because we talk about also double-minded people so the greatest battle ever fought brother Bram says in my mind is in your mind it's the greatest battle so if we don't understand that and we don't understand how that shall we say Battle Ground looks and how the devil will use it then it's going to start affecting the inward man look at the prophet say here when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place so in other words obviously we know the flesh is sold under under sin and we know the soul belongs to God but what is the meeting place the in between the spirit realm the mind there's a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind is was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head now that never started in some organization that they never started from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there they careful that organization can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you now in this service there was a a crippled girl I think on a stretch or something brother bandam keeps referring to us when she when you see him say yeah this he says yeah I want this little girl here that's very sick to be sure to listen out to this real closely decisions are made in the mind the head there is where Satan meets you and the decisions are made because that God made a man that way it's part of what our makeup is but it's a bit harder sometimes because like we often say the body is the very easy one to see that's the that's the one you see in the mirror the one you pamper that made you you know made you look nice before you came to church Etc you know but the reality is you know that is that is just very much one layer of who you are and as we know the spirit real is getting into a very shall we say a Grace Place and it can be a very deceptive place because if you're not careful you're going to allow you're going to allow too much into that Spirit realm and that's why Satan in this in this age more than ever before is getting into that Spirit realm he's getting it through the fourth dimension through the through the things we look at that's why even like brother Tazo was talking to the youth about be careful what you watch like horror movies and stuff because that stuff without even realizing the the devil's so clever he's realized he doesn't even need to go via your flesh yes your flesh might have a sensation of fear and you might start sweating a bit when you had to watch some of these things but the reality is the devil has implants those things straight into your spirit realm without you even realizing it and you might feel all fine but then that night or whatever the next day you wake up and you can have suddenly this tormenting spirit that can come upon you so you have to understand these things are extremely powerful and the devil realizes the same with music you can just you know be be listening to music music and without even realizing it thoughts can suddenly start popping up into your mind and it's because these little seeds are being thrown and Satan has this way to get right past the body realm straight to the spirit realm and we don't even realize sometimes why we are struggling with certain things but they've been put in via the the Devil Himself so we have to watch these things you know there's been many good studies of this and I know some of the ministers and the messes have already gone into music and all these uh fascinating uh you know hidden messages and you know even the MS use it with the music we I'm sure you many of you know what I'm talking about but it's just fascinating to see how you know that Spirit realm has been affected in so many different ways so yeah we know the five cent is on the outside but look at that we got imagination conscience memory a reason affection all these little things the Satan can use to try and get in and then we have obviously the middle which is the sole third pull faith and doubt but like we say if you're not careful that doubt man can get way stronger than it's meant to be and you can start going through some really tough times times as a Christian where you start doubting yourself you start doubting your experience and all types of things because you didn't allow for the faith man to grow now I found this and forgive me if I'm wrong maybe some of you would know but from what I remember when I found this this was part of brother bram's uh sort of sketch he had drawn when he when he preached the greatest battle ever fought but if it is wrong just forgive me I'm not trying to uh push this as this is the message it's just that I'd found it and it seemed like this is part of his notes when I analyze some of his writings it looked like it was the prophets but it doesn't really matter but the point is I like the principle of it because yeah you have the mind and here you can see as whatever you're filtering Hing in that mind so it's been filtered down into the Heart by the different things so obviously yes God chose the soul praise him for that Satan has chosen up there in the flesh but we must understand if we don't control what is coming down there we can get into trouble so the world has very much got onto this mind thing the posit I'm sure you've seen all the positive thinking that's going on around I'm sure you've seen all the whatsap statuses you know believe in yourself and you know all things can happen and and there's a lot of truth behind that because the world has tapped into this incredible thing called the mind and positive thinking it's incredibly powerful and and if you want to just say it's nothing Well it it is because you can see results people have incredible results just by being positive having a good attitude Etc and I mean maybe some of these quotes will be familiar you might have seen you know when you think positive good things happen you know once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones you'll start having positive results these are true but like you'll see now how the prophet says the problem is they're missing an important ingredient the mind is everything what you think you become when you when you go through a negative situation don't think about it make it positive so all of these things are as I say have got the have got the the the good side but we need to as I say filter all of these through the world word because there's also the opposite where they'll say something on the lines of you know anyone that is negative in your life you must just cut them out and you know is that Christian is that how we meant to be no we meant to get through those things to work it out to join anything that is dividing us and there's any hurt between us to be happy is to think positively confidently and optimistically the most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any so absolutely these things are true but like brother bam says here you need to be careful because now he says yeah now there is where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will now remember it's not Christian Science Now mind over matter which is what we're going through now that the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there brings the life just your your thought doesn't do it but the word of God with it you see it's a combined effort yes we are because that's the we'll go through now this is the principle of faith we dealt with some of the young young people about this the principle of faith is still there that you must you know speak positive you know try and cut out all the negative thoughts that are coming but the reality is you have to filter that and have the word as the foundation of what you're doing and then it becomes perfect in the will of God but unfortunately the world is just tapping into the other side and it's just about the thought life broaden the channel of your thoughts see it's not the thought as Christian Science make it mind over matter no that isn't it but yes is it powerful 100% And and doctors even use it I'm sure many of you had heard about the placebo effect you know you can have a practically a sugar pull but you say this will sort out your headache and meanwhile it's just sugar but because you believed the doctor that that headache disappears it's a fact they've proven it it's a perceiver effect and it's actually incredible uh results that have come from it in principle they're pretty much saying if you believe it will affect you it will if you don't it won't very powerful these Minds incredibly powerful and Medicine understands it and like I said there's been a great study of the mind of late incredible studies there's incredible articles that I would advise that you even go and read about it because it's fascinating to see how things operate and how you know you can then hopefully identify when the devil wants to get in and use the channel the opposite of placea is the Noba so even if that medicine they given you has been proven in the clinic to 100% help you and it really will help you science says that if you don't believe it's going to help you well then it's grave time and then obviously the opposite the placea if you want if you believe even though it's sugar if you believe it you're going to you're going to get well so it's just fascinating look at some of these things and this is from FindMe cure.com you know facts about the placebo effect you know so it says your 48% of doctors have prescribed placeas at least 10 times in the past year lovely you thought the doctor was only there for uh with genuine medicine well it's not the fact this is not me this is this is a you know from medical things you know sources was medical news today so these These are stats out there you know uh 50 to 70% 75% of the anti-depressant trials include placebo 16% now this is fascinating now pistan disease obviously is quite a strong disease if you see the way way they react you know trying to can't keep themselves together but literally imagine that a 16% even though it's a quite a strong devil you could say uh they have they have showed improvements through just the sugar pool or at least extremely little amount that's supposed to help them up to 90% of the patients in anti- elipsy drug TOS I mean for those that have are familiar with the epsy I mean once a person is overcoming it I mean you can just almost see the devil working in that body it's really sad but the reality is you know just by giving a sugar pill look at the power of the mind they just believe it up to 19% that's fascinating for me you know and obviously this is the very common one 85% of the reduction in coughs and cough medicine trials are due to the placebo effect and only 15% to the active ingredients it's very high but yet when we have a cough we take the medicine we believe it and we recover fascinating fascinating how these things work but I want you to notice something are these 100% no see our God says you know I am the god that heals all your diseases amen and yes some of us will have it maybe as a bit of a thorn in the flesh like we spoke about last week but the reality is is God the Healer and he died on the cross and is by his stripes you healed absolutely and that covers 100% the thing look what he says here now you say I don't steal I don't drink I don't do these things that has nothing to do with it see it's the inside no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are these things are respected sure but Jesus said except a man be born again see there's got to be something happened inside if you don't that's artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyway it can't be artificial it's got to be real and there's only one Avenue that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency come into your soul by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that which is said will come to pass you can't have what he said you get it there you are see it's the Battlegrounds if you'd only get started first and that's what I want to say let's start turning on this this sort of a shall we say to be cognizant of our thoughts to to watch to God because you can just let things flow in without without filters without blockages and you can find yourself as we said earlier in places you never meant to be so may the Lord help us to get started first so that he can now allow these things and yes there's going to be free moral agencies part of it so you have to make a decision about these things you can't just sit back and say well I've got the Holy Ghost all of its time will sort itself out he is asking for your buying he's asking for you to show your commitment also and the devil is always trying to point you to someone else's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine because often we give up because we we we we we we see someone else with a similar case and they didn't get through we see they had a similar struggle and they're not getting through or why should I try but that's not supposed to be our our desire our desire must be positive our desire must be thinking on the right things he'll point you to a hypocrite sometime who went out impersonating something he didn't do do it because he was impersonating but if we come from the true source of the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word cannot pass away it's got to stay there and he's talking to that sister again you see it sis I'm it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up so we can allow ourselves to be exposed to the true thing to to allow ourselves to be focused on what God has given us his promises and not doubt them them if we can get ourselves into that channel well you know as they say the sky is the limit and by God's grace we'll be fortifying that Soul realm which is what we have that's our desire amen now we're discussing these things at the camp because we're trying to show the the youth that because unfortunately we have organs in our body now we know the prophet clearly explains and we'll see it now but he clearly explains how the devil works is he has to get into a damaged Soul a damaged part of your body and it can want to be hereditary so it could have come down you even go to the doctors they ask you you know does your mother have high blood pressure you know is there cancer in your family cuz they understand the principle of Devil's being carried down through weaknesses in the family so as we know brother Bram explains that the devil has an Avenue to get into us when there's a weakness and then I'll explain to the youth well what if there's a brain damage do you think the devil's not going to get into that of course the devil's going to get into that weakness and how do we get the brain damaged we'll explain it to them it's that dopamine rush so that when they look at that thing they shouldn't have looked at when they partake in that when they shouldn't have you know there's now damage it's actually been clinically proven you see it on the the sonas they do on the brain you can literally see it's and I explain to the youth it's like a river that's flowing down there's the natural way it's supposed to be because not dopam dopamine is not a bad thing but when you get a massive dopamine spike it literally causes damage in the brain so as the rivers would flow through the easiest path cuz just like the the brain's lazy and just like water going down we'll always find the easiest path so your brain is actually lazy and if it can find a way to feel good about itself quicker then another way it will take that path so what happens with them dopamine a a rush it literally like Gorges out like a channel in your mind it's as I say it's literally brain damage they can show you under Sona I've researched these things is a brain there's like brain damage and now there's this this this this habit this bad habit and addiction that can form because you as soon as you're feeling under pressure as soon as things are going wrong you're bored or whatever it is the devil and you want to just feel good about yourself you want to feel better you want to well what happens there the devil has got in and he's connected a pornography spirit in there he's connected maybe drugs alcohol and it goes on and on you know we so hit the the hard things and I speaking to about the alray the end of the day you must understand and even to the older folk that maybe don't understand the struggles of the younger people anything that replaces God in a time of need is a problem anything you can run to books you know you can run to tablets there's lots of things that we could run to besides God in a time of need and it'll make you feel better when you're supposed to first go to God and these things are hard these things are as I say it's it's it's it's very quick to stand on a pedestal and look down upon others and judge them but I ask are you where you should be in a time of need going to father to help you and not rushing to something else that makes you feel good but like I said don't think it only goes to the rough stuff it goes for anything cuz Satan knows this weakness and he's believe me he knows how to to access those channels so like we're explaining to the youth unfortunately now you have literally brain damage and we explaining to them and I was speaking to a young brother talking about even how you know if if if you if you've been with another woman or you know vice versa that actually will tell you the you how the DNA they actually shown these guys have proven there's actually that person's DNA forms part of your DNA and for the rest of the life you actually carry that person in your DNA this is scientific I've got nothing spiritual you can go research it yourself it's unbelievable but by God's grace yet again like I said to that young brother I fellowship with God can also heal the DNA Heen as much as you can heal the mind he can heal the DNA but we have to allow him to come and sort it out to sooth those areas over so the facts of the matter is now we have a situation we have a real Gorge as we can say damage in our brain which is not healthy which is which is where Satan now has implanted a a spirit and we need God's grace to help sort of dam that up to to to to fill that space because ultimately he's never meant for us to have these things and yes it's going to be hard because the fact of the matter normally starts with mental Faith let me just read this quote I think it's the best way to say it and the biggest part of our mental Faith uh faith is mental Faith how by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recogn recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes us there is a Godly spiritual Faith so brother bam you can see he's se he obviously was shown with his hands but he's obviously pointing to his the soul and he's saying oh man if that mental Faith up here can ever strike this the soul realm it can become a Godly spiritual Faith which is what we want to achieve amen and then you know there's a that great example about that man that came in the Prophet The Prophet's prayer line and he he had was blind as we all know that so well and what did the prophet say well go go confess him go go go telling everyone and then he he did it for a little bit he comes back he says but I'm not healed yet he says well you are you just have to keep you know confessing keep proclaiming and you know how it goes he used to sell newspapers shouting out thank thank the Lord I'm Healed and and then the barber shop moment happened amen and it's almost like the in that time of I just like it in almost that time of mockery when The Barbers like oh you know I hear you know you healed and nor a mockery that's when God stepped on the scene when he confessed yes I am healed and as we know he received his sight there so the same principle it starts with the mental faith and me many people this is the hard part because to get through mental faith is tough you have to actively apply it you have to be as as we said earlier thinking about it guarding the thoughts because as soon as you start doubting it then we know the brother B teach us the devil again can get in and it's hard because like I was teaching the youth you might still stumble you we we prayed over it was such a beautiful moment we the youth laid hands on each other we prayed for each other for God to deliver us of all these spirits but the fact of the matter is like even the Bible says that devil goes for walk in dry places and if he comes back and he and the God hasn't F filled that Gap and you're not keeping God there and your faith there we know Satan can get an Avenue back so yes it it can seem almost like tough work but if you can just cat the faith element if you can just believe in the word then then that healing can come then then we can see that we can get Deliverance of these things as we as you all know there's the Miracles we all want the Miracles I would love like I say to the youth I would love at a at a at a snap of the finger that that God just swooped over everyone and everyone was miraculously healed and there and then everyone just had instant healing of the brain and that Spirit left but the reality is another quote I don't I don't believe I have it yet but another quote brother Bram says God mainly deals in Divine Healing as much as we want the miracle the the instant healing that's I mean we're all human I would want it I'm sure you would want it but he says most of the time God deals in Divine Healing why because that's where so much of our character gets built because now you have to apply Faith over and over with with no direct results but in its time by God's grace we will get there like that blind man just keep confessing it keep believing it so when there when that when that devil struck you down again just don't accept it even though it looks like it's the same thing oh the pornography I I just looked at something I shouldn't oh now what well just ignore it say I had a moment with God I had a moment and I believe he delivered me and that is just my mind that is damaged that's been repaired and I'm not prepared to accept it and you have to besides what you see in front of you believe that the Lord has made a way and that is hard but he's called it for for us to do it and by his grace we will do it we just need to believe in him and fortify the white Faith dog within us but talks about the white to the black dog fortify the white dog you know get inside that word let the words of Life speak to you and you'll see your faith will rise but we have to invest in those things because the reality is like we that picture shows if you're going to let all other rubbish filter down well that Faith dog white dog is just getting smaller and smaller and then you're going to find it harder and harder to believe and if you can if Satan knows if he can just get you in that place of doubt that you no longer believe God delivered you well there we go you got that demon straight back in there but by his Grace amen he still can give you another chance even if you fell because I was sharing with the youth hey I struggled with some things and I just couldn't work it out I was in a vicious cycle vicious cycle many many years but at the point of time God really delivered me of that that that demon and I knew it was gone but then I still realized I had to realize I now need to repair my mind just as brother BR says that cancer within you yes that spirit is gone but that cancer lump is inside of you and often the third or fourth day afterwards you'll feel worse than ever he says like you want to die but actually it's just the blood blood cleansing out the cancer and if you can just push through you'll be fine and as much as that brain will be wanting to go mad because it's demanding a dopamine now and I want to be happy now if you by God's grace could just say well say I'm not going to give you that I'm going to stay back here and I'm not going down those Avenues by his grace I rather fed myy myself of the word and not allow myself to go and let the natural way of dopamine come which is by giving myself to God maybe go for just a more practical thing going for a walk or whatever there's many even natural ways get just get it out of your system and try and not let that that that thing and then slowly but surely that damn wall can build up again and it can be repaired but we need to allow time for these things amen may the Lord help us because these things like I said to the youth it's not easy it will be times when you really feel like you just you just can't keep pushing but by his grace he's given us a spirit of faith that can you just have to to keep believing irrespective of what you are seen in front of you amen where were we then the then what does faith do that Faith recognizes only the word amen and remember he suffered in all things amen he knows all things and there's just some beautiful things that was shared also on that even ALR touched on a beautiful story about a young man suffering with homosexual and he was just saying how you know the the pastor was de with him said um uh you know uh no one understands how I feel and the Pastor said but God does because the Bible says in all things he was tempted and tri so he does understand that maybe shocks some of us CU we we think certain things are Untouchable God touched everything when he was on Earth so he could understand you and have empathy with your struggle and that's so beautiful that's how we love our God so much because he was prepared to go to the lowest darkest place for us and meet us at our level that's just what a sort of a God we want and I believe we have and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and DT Among Us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith amen so that's how you get your faith element let the word itself pour into it get it there our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation just that that what's happening up here this mental Faith just suddenly can drop down into the soul realm and it becomes a revelation amen and what a day of victory that is when when it comes all right now we discussed some of this at the in the at the youth camp but it was more on it wasn't really streamed I touched it we touched it more when we were doing the questions answers but there's one thing you now my wife and I she doesn't mind me saying this but we went through extreme battles as a family because my wife uh struggled with depression at one stage and it wasn't actually that she she just you know it was just depressed and the problem was after my birth of my second son her her whole hormones and everything just collap it was the they call it the adrenal gland uh completely collapsed adrenal helps you to get hormones that help you to deal stress the daily their daily cares of life just to have the energy and her adrenal gland completely collapsed obviously got damaged and now the devil had a way to get in there and to describe it the best way I can it's almost like she said it's almost like you've been pushed into the bed and even to raise up your arm or your even a finger is it feels like it weighs a ton now obviously with someone like many of us that have never experienced it we will try we wouldn't be able to understand it but that is the reality of what it was so the end of the day is I just you know obviously you don't understand we I made many mistakes as the husband of the of the of the household but at the end of the days by God's grace because of what she went through I started just to go through some things and just study these things and we need to look out remember we said it's a neurotic age and if we think these things are not going to influence us us we we need to we need to just open our eyes because amongst us I remember even the young ones parents watch your your kids if you if you find watch out for each other because these things are becoming more and more prevalent amongst us and there is by God's grace amen Solutions we need to we we we know that medicine has improved back in the day we know there's some problems with some of these things but by God's grace there's been some real good medicines and I know your your your pastor Al has has delved in many of these things but let us not be let's be wise in all things let's not just cut out when the Lord has provided Escape means but these are the things that I want to just highlight to you that you better be careful of because we can so uh uh uh go the one extreme that you must have faith faith faith which I believe but that we don't CER for those that don't have the ability maybe to do it that the prophet just explained with the mental faith and you say what are you talking about Michael give me a give me a sec I'm going to show you now what the prophet says here and as I said if you don't you don't have to believe me I say upfront if you don't agree with me I don't I don't I don't mind but just just allow yourself to maybe just see the words that the prophet uses and remember when the prophet he we don't have he didn't have the terms like schizophrenic and you know uh whatever these other terms are that we we talk so much so quickly and easily about from a mental disease he would talk about nervousness mental depression and stuff like that those are the words he used so when you see these things understand where the the root cause is all right well come here sister you believe with all your heart ma you're having awful trouble aren't you fighting every day cuz those with mental you know deficiencies to know what we're talking about look what he says here you got the hardest thing the hardest thing to get over there is it's nervousness yes sir you got a mental distress nervousness you're always dropping things too aren't you I see you too always drop some dishes the other day stand there when you stand up at that sink but now God is yet to make you well do you believe that now look son nervousness is the hardest thing there is to fight worse than cancer we shared this with the youth worse than cancer why is it worse than cancer because you can't mentally balance yourself right you see you can't get your mind running right the quote we just read how it works mental Faith becomes a spiritual Faith now what if your mental side can't balance itself right and think right what's going to happen we're going to have crisises in the family so we have to be wise as Believers in these things to make sure that this first spiritual Revelation because maybe in such cases maybe they don't have the ability to have the mental faith and I know it because we went through it because why we called as Believers to have faith amen so my wife would hear something and say well I'm believe I'm I'm I'm delivered and she'll go up the pools and a few weeks later there's disaster back in the home now this might surprise you it might be a bit foreign it might be weird for you to hear but I'm just giving you my experience and then these things were shared by God's grace with me when I looked in this I said oh wait a second here we need to be wise and look out for each other with these things and because the devil has unfortunately attacked us I will say this if you have a revelation you healed I would never stop anyone from quitting their their prescription as such but until you have a spiritual Revelation be careful because you don't know how to practice the mental Faith side because you why you can't mentally balance yourself right you can't get your mind right running why right because why the chemicals are on balance and they've they've shown that with these mental diseases and I know it's a very foreign thing you know in the olden days we didn't talk much about this it was almost taboo but this has become a reality of those things around us and if we're not diligent and we don't look out for each other we're going to have unfortunately very unhappy homes unhappy spouses unhappy children so let's look out for each other let's make sure we consider all things amen but you you have a very strange nature that is a deep thinker we're talking to the youth about some of the different uh you know temperaments and stuff and certain people are more more likely to have this that is a deep thinker always Crossing Bridges before you get there it's always not sometimes it's always a bad thing cuz all the worry and the it just drains you you know all the the stresses Etc and then of course like it normally always it never happens the way you plan it to happen doesn't that so true I think we've all in some way been guilty of these things but the prophet says we shouldn't do that we should make sure there's a better way to go and by that is developed a peptic condition of the stomach because these things are linked give you stomach trouble that's right isn't that that's sir if that is right raise your hand which which if it is right couldn't be nothing else God Almighty knows us now look what he says you now throw aside every negative thought and will go home and eat your supper and praise God and give him praise for it amen so let's make sure sure that we get our mental channels going right let us clean up our mental channels by God's grace it's got nothing about the size of the man and how strong he looks because you can have a man that looks all big and tough but on the inside these issues you might your mighty fine strongl looking man to be suffering with a nervous condition but you can't help it you've had it pretty near all your life it just bothers you you got a mental nervousness that causes you weary and you're always thinking of things and Crossing Bridges before you get to them that's a nature of yours that's right isn't it not reading your mind but that's the truth you always plan things and never happens that way and upsets you and things like that taking other people's troubles to your heart and worry over them when you really ought to do it you see why because we need to take it to God take the person that you know is a need to God you don't have to worry let him sort it out because as much as you can think you know exactly how to sort it out it's God that needs to do it and he can give you the inspiration if you're going to be to Tool but wait on him but God is yet to make you well my Gallant brother amen and I believe that's the same for each and every one that could have these things by God's grace because the same God that an angel of the Lord was with with with the Elijah our prophet in our day brother bam brother B said that same Angel of the Lord will be wherever this message is preached by Grace and it's still here and you can help each and everyone that has this and I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude and you know this so it's such a common quote the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God he will bring it to pass but see here if you can get yourself in a position position to believe that that promise was to you cuz we do that so much oh that is for this one that is to that one what about you cuz it's to everyone you need to CL take it on board and hold it to your heart and then if you can have that mental attitude it can become amen a divine revelation within us may the Lord help us all because every Divine promise is for us and we need him you can see the Psalms how David is constant thinking of God look what the David was like too many of us today think of Our Own been something that we could do better ourself but David was constantly thinking of what he could do for God Amen what a wonderful thing and may the Lord help us just have be like David amen we know how much God loved David a man after my own heart why because his heart and his mind was where it should be may the Lord help us so a little testimony I want to share with you and part of my healing process when I needed things for deliverance was that you know I had this funny enough you know but brother bam had a inspiration from a cigarette pack as we know thinking man's filter well I once had a bit of a little moment with a little WhatsApp status and there was a little video and pretty much what the guy was saying you know I don't understand you smokers he says you said you quit okay but why do you keep counting the days since you've been clean I thought you quit if you quit what is there to count from this day forward nothing should happen and then he then then suddenly some dawned on me he said the I think he said it in there the problem is you got a what you call a um a victim mentality and so many times the reason why we hang on to these things is because we feel sorry for our situation and how bad we were treated and how this one did this and that friend hurt me here Etc and part of that healing was that I had to realize that I had a victim mentality and these are just some of the little things they talk about victim mentality that I think is so important stop validating your victim mentality shake off your self-defeating drama and think spiritually now and embrace your innner ability to recover and Achieve through obviously the word of God because we know he has made a way for us but stop feeling sorry for yourself oh because of this oh because of that give it over to him let him be the one that can help you those with a Perpetual victim men's mindset tend to create the situations from which they suffer and we know that's true that's scriptural you know if you're going to think all that negative brother you want to speak these things that are negative well guess what it's just going to become a reality may the Lord help us with these things amen there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God and miss so so miss do tried to trust God for healing one time and she failed but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in the memory no matter about Miss Jones and what she did it's not you and it's you and God together and nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning and this is one of the biggest problems we make with our thought life is we entertain things far too long and they take hold and brother man says when you identify it kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger it stop it right now that is our goal brother and sisters stop it now if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail I might not be right don't you do that at all that's the prophet speaking amen and yes we're human and we we have our things our our our shall we say our our little upsets along life's way but let us rise to the occasion sometimes and like I said in wisdom in wisdom because yes we some of us need to be careful with these things if you have those certain conditions we spoke about now it's a strange thing that is that so much thought of people so he says that that this is so much thought of people and that would be right amongst us now this is the problem they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you must never say that we watch our mouths brother and sisters watch what we say to each other watch your thoughts amen you must never say that don't let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time irrespective of what you seeing and feeling may the Lord help us all I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart this is what we should our anguage should be do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always in your thoughts everything never permits a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming yeah true you can't help it but for the Steven at the back should know what I'm talking about well that be like a farmer that said he couldn't he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting there's a difference you can't help the thought Satan is going to throw in you mind but you have a decision you can stop him that Crow buling a nest and roosting so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I am going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrew stre he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it believe it and receive it we have to take hold of these things brothers and sisters brother Perry green had such a beautiful testimony linked to this he said he was really struggling he was a married man knew the prophet good friend and he was really struggling he says with some thoughts from the past he says his parents really raised him well to be really respectful but around sisters young ladies to make sure that he he didn't step over any boundaries that weren't meant to be there and he says along life's way he got a few girlfriends but he was always respectful and he didn't do anything beyond what was decent then he says I went and got married and I realized what life was all about and what happens between a man and a woman he says then my thoughts would go back to the times I was with those girlfriends friends and then I would think on what I actually could have done knowing now what I know to maybe have enticed them and made them to fall so he says I used to think on these things in a bad way and he says you know it would affect him really bad and you'll find his mind going to places shouldn't be and it really was bothering him and then he went he went on a trip with brother brandham he said and he said to brother brandham he says I want to talk to you about something when you have a gap and brother Bram and I think it must have been so hard brother Braham said to him yeah I know what it is but I'll talk to you later that must have been tough and for brother perig anyways so he says a couple days past and he says walking and past brother Bam's room and the door was open and brother bam called him in and this is something we need to understand that's just how we are in life he said Billy Paul he says listen he says you know you need to understand something he says you are a red-blooded male okay and you're going to have to watch yourself and that's the principle of these of of us still on on Earth you have to realize you're still a red-blooded male you're still a female with emotions and you know there's lots of things that affect us all in different ways he says that's not going to change but he says and you can't help it when Satan plants those uh thoughts in you but you can sure stop it and this is right linked to you you can stop that thing roosting in it but then he says something so and he said something so important to brother perig green he says now you need to understand something that when you have allowed the crow to bring a a twig or two you know before maybe you identified it or even build a nest before you identified it's a problem and You' now swept it out he says then you have to realize you must confess it before God because remember we have to bring all our thoughts and everything under subjection to God and he would said that you've sinned you have dwelt upon things in your mind you shouldn't have and he said you need to make that right he says then he then he says and then you go to um I think he says the 911 uh scripture of the Bible but it's it's the other way around it's 1 John 1:9 and it says there you know you know it well that that that that if you confess your sins amen before God he will forgive each and everyone and he says every time you start going down paast you're never not meant to be and those crows were bringing sticks he says you need to get on your knees and repent of those thoughts and properly repent of those thoughts and then he says it was just a matter of time before you completely got delivered of that terrible thought pattern because every time time he started to find himself thinking too much upon it he would get on his knees and confess it and he says in it's time the devil just got tired and moved on so the you know we have lovely tools at this time that we can use you know we're talking about just you know modern day challenges but the reality is we can prevent certain things in the first place it can really help us yes we know like we discussed with the youth there'll be hurts there'll be things that will come you have a weak Avenue the devil will get in he'll trick you into looking at something you shouldn't have now a sudden you got something in your mind you can't help it but the reality is there's still wonderful things in the scripture that we can if we can apply it can help us because if we can't avoid these things it's wonderful job says I have made a covenant with mine eyes why then should I think upon a maid you know if I I can't think about a maid unless I've seen a maid you know what I'm I think you get where I'm going so if you can't avoid it in the first place that is always first prize and to the young ones coming through that by God's grace may have been able to prevent it or have very limited access as much as you can stay away from what Satan's going to try and throw at you because the more you're going to watch movies the more you're going to expose yourself to stuff now you're going to think about them why because your eyes have seen it the doorway to the Mind amen is Through The Eyes so be careful what you allow yourself and there's just wonderful principles you know we talk about getting the the white dog to grow and that comes these sort of a scriptures Draw N to God and He will draw n to you amen cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your heart you double-minded amen may the Lord help us why is it double-minded because you're allowing too much to get in and now there's this conviction yes you're a Son of God but now all these things you're allowing watching all types of things you shouldn't be ET we not about the dos and don'ts but we just saying you have to watch it watch what you expose yourself to watch what you watch amen uh Matthew 6:34 take therefore no thought of the morrow amen those brothers and sisters I love to cross their Bridges before you get there the Bible says take no thought of tomorrow and this is hard but when those things come trying to arest them and say no I'm not going to worry about tomorrow this is God's problem I will pray about it and then I'm going to try and leave it and this is something you going have to practice over and over before it changes you and it can work I'm a testimony it can work because the Lord did help me with many things because of my thought patterns but in this time he can help you and the more you do it you'll see the easier it becomes for the marrow shall take thought of itself of uh of the for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof Romans 8:56 for they that are after The Flesh to mind the things of the flesh you see you're going to go into the flesh Realms and and expose yourself your mind's going to go there but they that are after the spirit that's what we want to be the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death because it'll bring death with it but to be spiritually minded aen is life and peace amen I'm slowly drawing down to a close we starting to land amen blessed is the man that walketh not in the counil of the ungodly but standeth in the way of Sinners nor Seth in the seat of the scornful but is the light what is is in the law of God Amen put your Delight there and in his law do he meditate day and night amen as David meditated on the Lord let us also find ourselves meditating more and more on the things of the Lord amen and you can expose yourself more and more to it and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season amen his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doth shall prosper hey I want to be in those shoes may the Lord help us all amen and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ amen Christ Jesus finally Brethren and this is just such a beautiful thing we need to take note of because this is where it all comes and finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of good report if there be any value and if there be any praise think on these things Lord help us because that is where he wants us to be and he knows how these things will help us so much in our Christian walk because he wants us to overcome all aspects of Our Lives wherefore GD up the loins of your mind now many of us don't know it but it was quite interesting when it talks about GD up the loins how it would do in battle of the Old Testament ging up was when obviously they had those long sort of a robe things as We Know what it would do is they'll take it from the back they would sort of push it through or vice versa they'll bring it out and it'll free up the legs and then they would tie the the the their sort of long whatever you want to call it robe things around their waist and now their legs were free so they can jump up rocks and everything and slay the enemies and when it said go up it was to you know make yourself free get yourself ready for battle so I believe the Lord was seing us yet wherefor G up the loins of your mind why cuz you're in a battle you're in the greatest battle ever fought F in the mind so you need to be ready for fighting you need to be ready to go out there and tackle it be sober and hope to the end for the grace that be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashion yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as Heath called you to be holy so be you holy in all manner of conversation watch what you say because what you say is so powerful let it be positive as the brother B says speak positive things let that come upon you open up your mind that's the Battleground there's where the battle sets an array right here in the front line your mind we in a fight brothers and sisters open up and say Amen now you say this when things go wrong when your mind comes and tortures you every doubt I doubt my doubts amen we're going to come up against to the spirit of faith I'm going to going to doubt my doubts amen I'm doubting my doubts now I'm believing God's word here I come Satan have that attitude here I come Satan you're not going to win this mind of mine God is going to be the winner of this great battle Amen in the mind something is going to take place sure it will yes sir but you need to be ready to fight you have to G up your loins I'm coming and I'm going to watch my thoughts I'm going to be careful what I'm letting into this mind because I know what's l in the mind like we saw that picture is ultimately filtering down amen are we're going to have to make sure and it's not as I said about dos and don'ts but it's just about practical Christian Living if you want to overcome in life expose yourself more to him so that he can strengthen you because I can tell you those are the best times amen when I could find myself in his presence then that Spirit of Victory just comes upon you and it's so much easier I want to show you a video clip to finish off amen I trust it'll work but I saw El's video works so this should hopefully also work um I don't know if you need a press play or if it's something I would have to do just see brother if you can get a play going there oh there we go so you saw the thing but the Braham says Christian Science Christian Science uh you know it's just one part he says you need to get that with the word of God and then it can come right so here has a bunch of metronom is all ticking at different uh frequencies but get the word of God and get your mind thinking right and suddenly things will start going a bit better how they should and the Lord can really work with you and help you Amen in your walk but you need to get your foundations rested on the right things amen don't just be on the mental side amen you need to get God's word but alas we start drifting we start watching all types of things lying all types of things into our mind well unfortunately it still will Resort back to where it was so yeah we got everything go wonderful in Unis well let's stop thinking about the Lord let's start stop watching what we think and suddenly we become double-minded in our hearts again amen may the Lord help us all amen amen because it's so easy these things can happen but with God's grace I believe he can help us and he's called us for it brother s like we said last weekend we are called for a high calling he would not have required this of us unless he gave you the tools to use it amen so we need to we need to we need to Amen Let the the white dog become big in our loves amen feed that white dog make time for God we SP to the youth talks about read a chapter you know of the Bible in the morning and if the evening if you can't you know just put on 20 minutes surely we can spare 20 minutes a day listening to the prophet amen you know can you not just give God 20 or 30 minutes of your time in prayer you know I said to the youth uh you know even when I've been in my worst times I got such a kick out of just getting on my knees in my worst possible condition cuz I knew the prophet said that when a the worst weakest sinner gets on his knees all of hell trembles and it was just so nice to get one back on the devil you know and he had got me down amen so may the Lord help us in the road ahead may you help us with our thinking may we learn to guard our thoughts to Be watchful of our mind amen and that's something you're going to have to train and start to be cognizant start thinking about what you think amen that he can renew your mind and change your mind by his grace amen let's just bow in a word of prayer amen dear gracious and wonder Heavenly Father Lord Lord the things we' spoken about tonight Lord yes it's easy and principle Lord but you know we fighting a real war Lord and like the prophet said it's the greatest battle ever fought Lord and we know even when Jesus was on Earth Lord as he got tempted by the devil in the wilderness Lord it was on the same basis just trying to get there to make him think oh but if only you'll do this oh but if you only do that you can get that Lord help us to identify the devil lord help us to identify when he's misquoting when he's misrepresenting your word that we'll be able to put it in the right place Lord but Lord we know you desire us to have Clarity of mind that we would would renew our mind Lord that we may come into your perfect will Lord these things we really need your grace to intercede for us we really need you to help us Lord I stand your guilty many a time lord and no doubt my brothers and sisters before me Lord but we know that Lord we can do it through Christ that strengthens me Lord Lord may you just help us in the in the the days the weeks the years whatever how long it'll be that you T before we go with you Lord with us but Lord we just ask that you please just be with us be our strength our portion help us to make Time Lord more and more for the white dog Lord knowing that's where our strength will lie Lord God someons we just have to sacrifice all the movies we have to sacrifice the series we love so much just as maybe give time to you Lord many of us work long hard hours Lord and we have so little time in the evenings Lord but let us Lord be able to balance these things out real good Lord help my dear brothers and sisters that could maybe be having some real mental oppression Lord and mental challenges Lord God you know it's such a difficult Place Lord and even the medication that they are often has you know uncomfortable side effects Lord but I believe you can help our brothers and sisters to overcome those side effects if that's what your will is Lord and but let us be wise let us look out for each other Lord let us be our brother and Sister's Keeper Lord let us be conscience of all these things and make sure we trust in you in all things Lord we want to commit the rest of the this service into your hands and we just close it off Lord be with each and every one as we'd leave Lord and I want to just say thank you Lord God for this wonderful time I spent with your precious bride this side of the world lord it's been so beautiful such a beautiful people Lord I really want to pray a blessing upon them Lord may you just really increase spiritually speaking within each and every member of this church Church Lord may you make it prosperous that it can support others that are needy Lord may you there's so many wonderful ministers here may you just give them greater Revelation greater Lord faith in you may they be able to take this church to higher and higher Heights Lord and and thinking of Al and pillar Lord Lord they both need you so much Al as the as the pastor and and pillar to support her husband Lord they really need you Lord and I pray a special blessing upon them as they would lead this church Lord Lord such fine Wonder wonderful people here of God and I'm so looking forward Lord if it's not this side that we'll see each other on the other side be with each and everyone help us in our road ahead we pray these things in your precious and Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah you may we stand at your at this time together we'll call the musicians forward I think we all just sing that song think about his love amen think about his goodness think about his grace that has brought us through amen it's the key of f amen man sister oh think about his [Music] love yes think about his [Music] goodness oh think about his grace that has brought through you sing it different to me so I think you must amen take over godess you as the heavens above great is the measure of far is love great is the measure of Father think about his love oh think about his love think about his goodness think about his grace that has brought us through Hallelujah for as high as the heaven above great is the measure of Our Father's Love Yes [Music] Lord great is the measure of our father's love amen I trust we've all been blessed tonight am mean just really practical rubber hit the road kind of things just really love it and just thank the Lord for speaking to us tonight um I was just thinking we we have a term for some of the concepts that brother Michael shared and uh one of the terms that I spoke about a little while ago is self-fulfilling prophecy you know when we confess and we think in a some negative way we start living as if it's already true and we actually can cause those things to happen because of her attitude about it Hallelujah the other thing that that that really stands out to me also is every time we allow our minds to go down paths that they shouldn't we should take it a serious enough to spend time with God I often refer to that situation where brother randam went all the way to to Greens Mill to pray when when Dr Davis said nasty things about him and so forth and yet yes that was maybe an extreme case but brothers and sisters I believe it's important for us that you know when we catch ourselves thinking thoughts going down roads that that we shouldn't be going down it's really important that we clean those things out otherwise all we do is we just put more under the hood and more under the hood and more under the hood and in the end we don't understand why we're battling so [Music] much last comment I would like to make is um brother Michael just really opened the door on on something and and and it's it's really good that we that we also see this in perspective um and that is you know when you're a red blooded male you're a red blooded male but unfortunately and and unfortunately some people in this message has used that as an excuse right um I've come across men in this message that says well I'm just a red blooded male and men are going to last after woman or men are going to have a desire this that and the other and that's utter and total nonsense the reaction will be there that that I agree with but to nurture it and encourage it and think it's okay no that part I don't agree with that's something we have to fight it's something like like we heard tonight you know something that when those thoughts come in that we bring those thoughts captive how do we bring it captive take it to God Amen we cannot say and and and and and I will go a step further in brother brandom's time the whole homosexual scene and so forth hasn't gone as far as it is now and and I dare say and of course I can't can't show you a quote and I can't show you scripture but times have changed so much that women struggle with exactly the same things men do women battle the same lustful thoughts women battle the same kind of mind battles that that men do and and it's not any less right or any less wrong I mean we should take responsibility for those things I love the principle be your brother's keeper Michael referred to that over the weekend you know that's what Abel said to God am I My Brother's Keeper amen that's the wrong attitude to have let's be our Brother's Keeper by the Holy Ghost and not not us ourselves but let's let's apply the blood to one another encourage one another take hands with one another amen and let the Lord work through us praise the Lord I just love it thank you very much amen let's sing let's sing Jesus breaks every fet Jesus breaks every every F Jesus breaks hey every F yes Lord oh Jesus [Applause] PR every fet for
