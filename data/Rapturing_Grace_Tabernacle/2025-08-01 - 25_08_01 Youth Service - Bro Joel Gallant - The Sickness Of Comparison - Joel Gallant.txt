I'm kind of sorry that we have to meet in church, but I think we're just a little too many for for our house, but we uh we're going to pretend it's we're in a house environment. We just going to relax and just have a interactive time. Just a lovely time of fellowship. So, I'd like to welcome you and welcome our visitors all the way from the Manawatu. God bless you from uh Mongani. really just appreciate you making the effort of come. Um so I don't want to take any time but I need to introduce brother Joel. Um most of you have never seen him. I only met him in person two days ago but we've uh we've had wonderful fellowship so far and just really looking forward to what the Lord has for us tonight. I have been let into the secret of what my brother's going to be speaking of tonight and I believe it's very relevant and I'm very excited about it and uh you know we get what we what we expect. So if you if you come expecting tonight I believe God will meet that expectation. So let's just pray one more time. And maybe maybe you feel I'm I'm tired. I've had a long day. I've had a long week. Someone irritated me today at work, at school, whatever it is. Um, but let's just ask the Lord to get that stuff out of the way and give us that expectation in our hearts. Most wonderful father, oh God, we there's indeed none like you, Father. We worship you. We love you and appreciate you, Lord. But not as some distant God that we serve out of fear, Lord, but that that friend that that that friend that is closer than a brother, Lord. That's what we relate to you as, Father. And we are so thankful for that. And tonight, we just want to call you on the scene again. I pray, Father, that you will forgive all our weaknesses and shortcomings. Lord Jesus, I want to lift each of us up before you tonight. Lord, I pray that if there's any hindrances, every distractions, any mind battles, Lord, anything that's in the way of distracting us tonight, Lord, I pray that your Holy Spirit, Father, will capture our hearts. Help us to surrender our hearts to you completely, Father. Lord, I pray that you will grant us grace, Lord, to come with expecting hearts tonight. Lord Jesus, we just commit this time to you. I pray for brother Joel too. Lord, I lift him before you and pray that you will just use him for your glory. Father, Lord Jesus, we just commit every part of the service to you. I also want to pray for any requests among us tonight, Lord. Maybe there's some unspoken requests. Oh God, I'm going to also speak my request. Lord, I really need your touch for my health, Lord. Pray that you will come on the scene, Father. Oh Lord Jesus, we thank these things in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. So, I'm going to hand over to brother Joel, but let's just sing one more song before we before we do that. Um, maybe I'm not going to be able to type quick enough. Can you do that for me, Joseph? I'm going to let the glory roll. There we go. Thank you very much. I'm going to let the glory roll when the road is cold in glory. Come on, faster. I'm going to get beside myself when I get beside the king. That day I'm going to have the time of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away. when I get carried away. Well, I don't know why I become a little shy when I get around a hell lot of people. And I can't figure out why I never can shout about the love that floods my soul. I must confess I can't express the feelings deep inside me. The things I know and cannot show. One day we'll overflow. I'm going to get the glory roll when the roll is called in glory. I'm going to get beside myself when I get beside the king that day. I'm going to [Applause] [Music] Thank you. [Music] [Applause] Amen. You know, since it started, I knew all the songs and uh he had to keep the song I don't know for when I was coming up front. Amen. God bless you all. You could be seated. It's a pleasure. Thank you musicians. really it's a blessing to see you play and uh yes it's a pleasure for me to be here. This uh I never thought something like that could happen. I hope you can all bear with my French accent. Makes me feel good to see that many people have an English accent down here. So and uh yes. So tonight, since we're not in the living room, I figured we could uh maybe have the teaching side of the service here just a short while and then move across the street uh around snacks and maybe have the interactive part of the meeting where we can, you know, chat on what uh was thought and maybe ask you guys could ask any questions you have on your hearts. around snacks. I think it would be informal and and uh yeah. So anyways, let's just uh read a quick scripture. Um if you have your Bibles, let's turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 3. I took the liberty of a PowerPoint since we're in church, so &gt;&gt; you could as well follow on the PowerPoint. And um starting from verse 17 we have just uh we've planted a church in a new city in in Canada in Quebec actually. So as much as far as you can go on the other side of the globe is where I come from. And uh we've planted a church a year and a half ago and we have a wonderful youth group of about 15 15 youth. So pretty much the same size I I feel like you guys have here. So feel free. You should come down and visit one time. Canada is a beautiful bigger New Zealand. So yeah. Amen. So let's read. Now the Lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. Do you feel liberty tonight? &gt;&gt; But we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory just as by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. Let's pray. Father, thank you for this evening and this group of young people you have gathered here tonight to hear about you and to hear from you. And may you be the one who speaks tonight and use these lips of mine to be a blessing, Jesus. We commit this evening into your hands, into your name. Amen. Amen. And so tonight uh I want to speak about a sickness and uh a disease a sickness and this is a sickness that affects uh I uh and we never hear about this sickness you know we hear about cancer and different sicknesses in the body but this sickness affects maybe the most people of all sicknesses and uh I call it the sickness of comparison. &gt;&gt; The sickness of comparison. And uh we're all affected by this sickness of comparison. And it has uh devastating effects on the human beings. And so we just want to look at it from a biblical standpoint tonight just for a few minutes um and see how we do compare ourselves with others and how we do compare others with others and uh what this does uh to us as human beings and how this is contrary to God's plan for our lives and and the human being as always compared itself. It It always did. You know, we go to the Bible and we see Cain comparing his offering with Abel and and getting very mad that Abel's offering is accepted and his isn't. And uh I think about the spies in Jericho, they say um you know, we cannot do it. They're they're giants. The walls are too big. The people are too big. Um, you know, Saul compared himself to Goliath and didn't measure up. You know, he he's too big. Uh, he's too strong. He's a soldier. He's a a fighter. And kings always compared their kingdoms with other kings. Uh even the disciples, you know, Jesus disciples were there in the room with God made flesh uh to have a a supper and they were fighting over who was the greatest &gt;&gt; or who Jesus loved more. And so it's just uh it's just um in us to compare ourselves. But we do compare others as well. Um, we compare others amongst themselves. And I I think about about Samuel going to anoint a king. And he gets there and you know, Jesse just presents to him a whole bunch of his his sons. And uh when Samuel sees, you know, his taller and stronger son, he says, "Surely &gt;&gt; this is him." And and and the only way he can be the taller son is that you compare compare him with a shorter &gt;&gt; son. And so right there, the prophet compares the sons and thinks because this this one is taller and stronger, this surely must be him. And and Samuel is not the only one who compared his sons and to see if they were worthy of being a king. But Jesse compared his son is in a very special way, which is leaving David behind. &gt;&gt; He was not even esteemed worthy of being king. He was too small. He was too weak. And so we can see by this illustration that prophets can compare people, parents can compare people. Nobody is out of the picture when it comes to the sickness of comparison. And you think about the disciples of John the Baptist and and how they come to Jesus and compare themselves with the disciples of Jesus and say why do your disciples and they compare themselves with Jesus disciple &gt;&gt; and and it's just it's rooted in human nature to compare ourselves and to compare others &gt;&gt; and the technology has made it much worse you know I mean Before le let's just go back a hundred years. You could only compare with your neighbors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And now you can compare with the world. &gt;&gt; So it it's it has just technology has just magnified &gt;&gt; a problem that we already live in or live with. Before you could only compare with what you see. Now you see everything &gt;&gt; or you think you do right because you see in fact only what people want you to see but you feel like you see everything. Before you saw only your neighbor's cars, but now you see as vacation pictures and and you see everything really. And so it keeps you in a constant state of comparison. &gt;&gt; And you compare yourself and and you compare your wealth and you compare your beauty and you compare your life. You compare your car care carrier. You compare everything with everybody. &gt;&gt; People you know, people you don't know. Right? Am I right so far? But this sickness has very bad effects on a human being. In fact, and now these statistics I'm about to talk about are American statistics, but I think human being is human being. So they're fairly fairly good. 54% of young girls recognize that social media is bad for them. So over half of young girls in North America, they recognize that it's bad for them, that it's caused depression on the young girls and it's caused suicide on the young boys. And the reason why I don't know if you ever heard that young boys are more prone to suicide than young girls, but but the reason boys are are more prone to suicide than girls is they don't have the same outlet. A girl can talk it out, right? Uh the boy keep it inside and when he feels like he's lost at the game of life, then there's no there's no point in living anymore. And and so these are just side effects of this sickness we're talking tonight, the sickness of comparison. &gt;&gt; But all the while the Bible says, you know, count your blessings. &gt;&gt; Name name them one by one and and even Psalms 126 says, "The Lord has done great things for us and we are glad." But sadly uh not many people can say speak with their heart what is written on the screen. &gt;&gt; Many people can speak with their mouth. &gt;&gt; But not many people can speak it from their hearts because that is not how we feel. &gt;&gt; We don't feel like the Lord has done great things for us. &gt;&gt; We feel like the Lord has done great things for my neighbor. Look at this beautiful trip they've taken in that part of the country and look at that beautiful new car. They have a new house or beautiful life they have. Surely God has done great thing for them and not for me. The sickness of comparison. And so when our hearts are lusting because of the sickness of comparison, we cannot thank God for what he's done for us. But instead, we we are we feel sorry for ourselves and we feel let down by God in the depths of our hearts. We feel a let down because we compare ourselves and it places us in in in a state of unsatisfied desires. &gt;&gt; It focuses our attention on what we lack to be happy instead of everything we have and that should make us happy, &gt;&gt; right? How many of us each week, maybe each day, but at least each week, we focus on what we lack to be happy. Like, if only I could get or do or be &gt;&gt; get this, then I would be happy. &gt;&gt; But but why does that come from? Like where does that lack come from? It comes from the sickness of comparison &gt;&gt; because you know if you haven't seen nobody that has it and looks happier than you on social media or whatever then you don't see the need to have it to be happy. So it focuses this sickness of comparison focuses our attention on what we lack to be happy. And so let's see what that sickness creates. It creates mainly four things. It creates insat insatisfaction about our current life who we are and the life we live. We're we're insatisfied with the current state of our life and it also creates depression &gt;&gt; and we live in a depressed age. I mean these depression pills they sell man it's it's just most sometimes I feel most everybody has depression pills you and why is the world so depressed we haven't like in the history of the world we have never been as comfortable and wealthy and you know three meals a day and beds and amenities and but we've never been so depressed. There has to be a route to this depression and that root I believe is comparison. And then it creates lost, lost of our neighbor, lost of a a different life, a virtual life. And but lastly, it creates uh complexes. And um what is a complex? The dictionary says it's u feeling inferior, feeling of inferiority. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. That is what a complex is. So I look at someone playing the piano and I feel inferior. Right. Because I Why do I feel inferior? Because I look at somebody else playing the piano. Right? There's no feeling inferior without comparison. Without comparison, you cannot be inferior. &gt;&gt; Without comparison, you cannot be complexed. &gt;&gt; You cannot have a complex. This is impossible. But then we compare ourselves and we feel like our careers, the way we look, what we possess, the success we have, the trips, the marriage, the families, the kids, whatever. Put put whatever you want in that square. We feel inferior to someone somewhere and and and that creates a complex where you know I'm not good. You're not good. Compared to what? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Compared. Compare. For you to be not good at playing drum, you have to compare yourself with someone. If you don't compare yourself, then I mean you're just as good as you could be right now, right? Now I want you to get this. When you compare yourself, you create within yourself a complex. You do it to yourself. &gt;&gt; When you compare yourself, but when you compare others, you give away complexes. &gt;&gt; You distribute them like gifts. &gt;&gt; And we're so prone to compare others. No, &gt;&gt; we do. We always compare others, you know, and and we compare our kids. There's not much parents here, but we compare our kids and we compare our parents, you know. My my friends uh my friend's mom, she's not like you. Yeah. She comparing your mom with your friend's mom. It's just we do it all the time. We compare our kids. We compare our husbands and wives and our parents and our brothers and our sisters and our pastor and we just compare people with other people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that is bad. Very bad. Because these complexes that we put upon ourselves or that we give to others are strongholds &gt;&gt; in our hearts &gt;&gt; that most of the time paralyze us. &gt;&gt; Most of the time &gt;&gt; they are open doors for tormenting spirit. No wonder the world is tormented. &gt;&gt; The world is tormented because there is an open door to the heart. There is a stronghold within which the spirit, the evil spirit can can get in your heart and go at work tormenting you from the inside. Not from the outside now, from the inside of your heart, tormenting you with complexes and lust and depression and insatisfaction. This is an evil spirit doing these things. But but it all started when you left that door open through the sickness of comparison. &gt;&gt; And and um and so this sickness of comparison places the person in one of these two situations and most of the time these two situations consecutively like one after the other. The first thing that could happen to you when you have that sickness of comparison upon you is is a state of of lust, a state of of uh performance where you try to be better than your neighbor. Um a state of excess where you want to do, you want to own, you want to to succeed, you just want to be better. and um a thirst for possessions and and trying to be better than your labor and living in excess and living what I call the religion of perfection &gt;&gt; because it is a religion. I don't care if you go to church or not, but perfection is a religion &gt;&gt; and it comes from the sickness of comparison. This need to be perfect or to be better. And so there is that state of mind that comes with it that that keeps you self-centered and pushes you to cultivate an image of perfection. You kind of need to be perfect. &gt;&gt; But that is only one of the two states that sickness can bring you in. And the second state is a state of depression. &gt;&gt; You're in neutral. You you can't even move forward. &gt;&gt; You you're full of complex. You're paralyzed because you are not winning. It seems at the game of life. you're worth less. You're not winning at the game of life. You open your Facebook or your IG or whatever it is and and you look at the pictures and you think to yourself, "What a miserable person am I? I'm not winning at the game of life. Like, I'm going nowhere. I'm nobody." Um, and it then it it paralyzes you and it keeps you in a state of depression and complex like you're worthless, depressed. insufficient or uncapable to win at the game of life. And often these two state they are successive because for a while you're trying to make it right. For a while you're trying to be better than your neighbor. You're trying to be you know more successful and to own more and to travel more and to be more beautiful and whatever that is that you compare yourself. You're trying to be better. You're trying to live that religion of perfection for a while. But when you've been living that religion for a while and it still doesn't satisfy you, then you you often switch to that second mindset, which is being depressed and paralyzed. And some people just do that endless circle of being depressed for a while and then getting back on top trying to be the best and then being paralyzed again and depressed and they just go over and over in that vice circle. And uh this is what the sickness of comparison does to a human being. And that sickness has infected most every human being on planet earth honestly except you live somewhere in the jungle maybe you're and even then you know uh the tribe you I'm sure you compare yourself to the tribe leader and he kills more animals than you do or something. Yeah. It's rooted in our DNA. This sickness of comparison is rooted in our DNA. But I didn't come with bad news tonight. And I came with good news. &gt;&gt; And the good news is there is a remedy to this sickness. &gt;&gt; And you see I keep hearing over and over that the world now doesn't want Jesus and the world is atheist and and and and and it's it's like a a paradigm. So in a sense we hear pe the people don't want to hear about Jesus and they've rejected God and stuff and and then the opposite is they they change identities and they tried they try so many things to end up on top and get rid of this depression and this feeling of worthlessness and not being seen that comes with that sickness. And all the while, all the while, there is one remedy &gt;&gt; and that remedy is the word of God. &gt;&gt; It is, it truly is. And so even though the world might not be interested in a religion, you know, they you don't realize how much your friends they think when you say God, they hear religion. &gt;&gt; That's what they hear. You say God, they hear religion, but they don't need religion. I agree with them. I hate religion. &gt;&gt; But they need a relationship with their maker. &gt;&gt; That's what cures this sickness. &gt;&gt; The only thing that does, in fact, the only thing that does cure that sickness is to know where I come from, &gt;&gt; who I am, and whom I want to be pleasing to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. The cure to that sickness is to know where I come from, &gt;&gt; who I am, and whom I want to be pleasing to. &gt;&gt; There is the cure to that sickness. And uh let's read Psalms 139. David speaks. He says, "For you formed me. You formed my inward parts. You covered me in my mother's wombs. I will praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; And and let me just stop and ask you this question tonight as uh as it is very laid-back and I don't want an actual answer out loud, but uh I feel like I know the answer anyways. But when is the last time have you praised God for having made you, you know, for having been made fearfully and wonderfully made? When is it when is the last time you woke up and you you looked at yourself in the mirror and you said, "I praise you, oh God, &gt;&gt; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." When is it? All right, let's continue. Marvelous are your works, and that my soul knows very well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest part of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, yet being unformed, and in your book they were all written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them. Now, reading this verse, we could think like the person writing this must be, you know, the perfect person. Like if if David, we know David is a man, right? The person writing this must be so handsome. Like he must be tall and strong and handsome and just the days of his life must be perfect like a bed of roses, right? Because look at the praises he gives to his maker for how he is fearfully and wonderfully made. But the fact is that the guy that wrote these words is the guy that even his father has put aside. He wasn't even he wasn't even considered you know he wasn't even big enough or intelligent enough or strong enough for his father to put him in front of the prophet. He didn't even bother calling him &gt;&gt; like because for sure this little guy won't make it. You know, this is the guy who writes this David the small, David the feeble, &gt;&gt; David the shepherd, David the least of his family. &gt;&gt; But but David didn't compare himself. &gt;&gt; David didn't. Saul did, Samuel did, his father did, David didn't, he didn't, but we'll get back to this later. Um, so let's go back to the verse we started with. This is an amazing verse because Paul says, "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, but we all with unveiled face beholding as in the mirror the glory of the Lord." Now, I think we can all picture the glory of God, can we? &gt;&gt; I mean, we sing about God. We worship God. We praise God. God is mighty. God is glorious. God, you know, deserves all honor, worthy worship and praise. God, we can behold the glory of God. But then um Paul goes on to say, we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; That's beautiful. That hard that one is hard to accept. &gt;&gt; Can you accept? I mean, we've just all said that we can behold the glory of God. And you, we all agree. But then the next verse says, "But you are transformed &gt;&gt; from glory to glory into the same image." &gt;&gt; Can you accept that? that you are the glory of God and you are being transformed into the image of God. &gt;&gt; Can you accept it? &gt;&gt; And if you can, what good would would it do you to compare yourself with your neighbor? Right? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; What good would it do yourself to compare yourself with anybody on Facebook if you are being transformed to the glory of God and to the image of God? And so I would like for you tonight maybe to leave with a question, something you could ask yourself once in a while just to remind yourself of who you are. And that question would be, what do you see when you look in the mirror? &gt;&gt; What do you see when you look in the mirror? Because most of us, we look in the mirror each and every day. We do. We wake up and then we look at ourselves in the mirror and most of us we don't like what we see, right? There's a reason where where this the the Bible speaks about a mirror. Paul uses the analogy of a mirror and how we look at ourselves. And he says, "When you look in the mirror, what you actually see is the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; What do you see in the mirror?" But you see to to get rid of that sickness of comparison I said you you have first you have to know where you come from. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And you have to know who you are. &gt;&gt; And and now we've read Psalms 139. And we know where we come from. We know our maker. David says, "You made me &gt;&gt; and I worship you because when I wasn't even there in the depths of the earth, you saw me and you knitted me and you made me. So now I know where I come from and I know my maker and I praise him for him for it." And then this verse tells me who I am or who I am becoming. Now I know where I come from and I know who I am or who I am becoming because I am being transformed into the image of God &gt;&gt; from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; And so I I only need one last thing to to free myself from the sickness of comparison. Remember what I asked what I told you? I told you where I where I come from, who I am, and &gt;&gt; who I want to please, &gt;&gt; who do I want to be pleasing to? Because if I want to be pleasing to the world, if I want to be accepted by my friends or by my colleagues, if I want to please the world, then I will still have to kind of cope with that sickness of comparison &gt;&gt; because I'm trying to fit in. And to fit in, you have to compare yourself. &gt;&gt; You have to. So, you're not free yet. That's why Galatians chapter 1 says Paul says or do I seek to please men for for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please man for if I still pleased man I would not be bondervant of Christ. &gt;&gt; There's a choice here right? Not everything is a choice. Um the first two is really being conscious of it. It's just being conscious of the maker. You cannot choose your maker. It's not a choice. You have been fearfully and wonderfully made. It's already happened. It's now that now is just the time for us to be aware of it. &gt;&gt; Go back to our roots. realize that we have been made by God and and who you are is is not really a choice because you are being transformed not of yourself but you are being transformed by God into his image from glory to glory. But this third one is really a choice is where the choice is set before us is who do we want to please? Because we cannot please men and free ourselves from the sickness of comparison. Because the world wants us to compare ourselves. That's how we can please the world is by comparing ourselves to the world and fitting in. But Paul says, "I cannot be a servant of God and still want to please men." &gt;&gt; And there's a choice right here. And that choice is very important because it's a choice that frees you from the sickness that kept you bound and depressed and paralyzed and empowers you to walk by the spirit in the works that have been prepared beforehand by Christ so that you may walk in them. to fulfill God's plan for your life. It empowers you to be yourself. We call it be yourself, but I would say to be what God created you to be. &gt;&gt; It empowers you when you free from that sickness. &gt;&gt; And the the spiritual men in the Bible didn't compare themselves, right? We said Cain compared himself to Abel. But did Abel compare himself to Cain? No, he didn't. All he wanted, you see the problem Cain had is he wanted to make a more beautiful sacrifice than Abel. Cain was living in comparison &gt;&gt; and he he couldn't please God. I don't care how beautiful his sacrifice was, he couldn't please God. But Abel didn't want a more beautiful sacrifice. He didn't want to compare. He wanted to please God. That's what he wanted. &gt;&gt; And that is why his sacrifice was accepted. &gt;&gt; And we've talked about David quite a while. But it's Isn't that I mean, David should be our example. Really, David should be our example. Everybody compared David and esteemed him unworthy, uncapable, unfit. Yes, &gt;&gt; David never compared himself. David, the smallest, the weakest, the least of them all, the least. &gt;&gt; He didn't compare himself to his brothers, not once. He didn't compare himself to Saul. He didn't even compare himself to Goliath. &gt;&gt; Like, he didn't care how tall or big he was or strong or whatever. He didn't compare himself. No, he knew. He knew what? He knew where he came from. He knew who he was &gt;&gt; and he knew who he wanted to please &gt;&gt; and he just went right there in the valley and went straight to Goliath's face and killed him. But that would have been impossible if he had only compared him. I mean, think of think of it. Saul putting on him the armor Saul's armor on David. I mean, I'm sure the helmet went up to here. Like, &gt;&gt; you can even see his face with the helmet. &gt;&gt; What an opportunity to compare yourself trying to put somebody else armor. What an opportunity to compare yourself. He didn't. &gt;&gt; He said, "Your armor doesn't fit me. I'm not trying to fit your army. I'm not trying to fit the world. I'm not trying to fit my people. I'm trying to please God. I'm trying to fulfill God's plan for my life. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb didn't compare themselves. They said, "We are more than able. &gt;&gt; Not because we are stronger. Not because we we are faster or because we are taller." No, we are more than able. Why? &gt;&gt; Because we know who we are. &gt;&gt; We know where we come from. And we know what we are doing is pleasing God because it's fulfilling a promise. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't compare himself. He didn't compare his disciples either. The spiritual men of the B the Bible didn't compare themselves. Only the carnal men did it. These mens we've just spoke about, they knew they came from God. They knew they were sons of God. They knew they pleased God. They knew God was for them. They knew God was for them. When is the last time you told yourself, "God is for me?" &gt;&gt; Honestly, when is it? When is the last time you woke up one morning, you know, whatever, it's time for exams at school or something, and instead of being fearful, you look at yourself in the mirror and you say, "God is for me." When is it? I am fearfully and wonderfully made and I praise you, God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I count my blessings. &gt;&gt; God is for me. &gt;&gt; We don't do it. &gt;&gt; We tend to stay on the opposite side of the scope, which is I'm not good enough. &gt;&gt; I'm not beautiful enough. I'm not rich enough. I'm not intelligent enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not. That's where we tend to stay. And that shows we're still in that sickness of comparison. But God wants to take us out of that sickness and into his will and his plan for our lives. And even in church, if we don't uh watch, we start to compare ourselves in church and to compare our church with other churches and to compare our music with their music and our pastor with their pastor and and we compare our between ourselves, you know, we just compare ourselves in church. Church is a social network. Actually, we've talked about Facebook as a social network, but often church is just like a social network. These people, we we get close to them and and we see pretty much everything in their lives and we have a chance to get close and to see what's what they live and it creates all sorts of complex, you know, oh, she can play music good. Oh, she's beautiful. She's more beautiful than I am. and she's she's more intelligent and there's always something. And the funny thing is in that sickness of comparison, you never compare the thing you have better than somebody else to what they have worse. It's there's a funny thing u the guy that is taller will compare his muscles, not his height. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That the guy that is muscular will compare his height, not his muscles. It's just we always compare where we lose &gt;&gt; because that is a trick of the enemy &gt;&gt; to keep us paralyzed because he doesn't want us, you know, to to be empowered as sons and daughters of God and to just advance his kingdom and and and live a fulfilled life in Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't want to compare myself. I don't want to compare myself in a good way to feel better than y'all. And I don't want to compare myself in a bad way to feel bad about myself. I just don't want to compare myself. I want to please God and do his will. &gt;&gt; That's all I want. I want to be pleasing to God and do his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, we need to find our identity &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; In Christ. To heal of that sickness, we have to go back to our roots, our maker, &gt;&gt; where we come from, who we are, and what we're here for. And when we preach or teach and maybe it's a mix of both and I bet um a message like this one we what we fear the most I have to be honest with you preaching along those lines what we fear the most is that the people would leave and just resume with their lives &gt;&gt; and and I want everybody to understand that there is healing &gt;&gt; in the word spoken Tonight &gt;&gt; there is deliverance &gt;&gt; from the way people look at you. There is deliverance from depression. &gt;&gt; There is deliverance from that suicidal spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There is deliverance from the complex that that is holding you down. You don't have to feel less or inferior. Yes, &gt;&gt; you are not inferior nor superior to your brothers or your sisters. &gt;&gt; You are sons and daughters. Jesus said, "No one is great." You know, there's no one great. We're all equals in the eyes of God. But we have to learn to see ourselves through the word and through the eyes of Christ and not through the eyes of the world. I hope you realize there is deliverance &gt;&gt; if we put these words in practice. James says, and I finish with this verse. James says, "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a a mirror again." Yeah. for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. It just ties back in so perfectly. When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? And when you leave the bathroom or your room, do you forget immediately what kind of person you're called to be or does this stay with you like throughout your day? Can you just stay in that spirit of God is for me, I want to please God, God is for me, I want to please God. that will keep you, guard you from falling back in the same trap of this spirit of comparison and and you will feel, you know, fulfilled and you will feel important in the eyes of God and you will see God moving in your life in a mighty way because you will move. You will not be paralyzed anymore by your complexes. Complexes paralyze people. I assure you some very gifted people. The example of music is the easy example. But some very gifted people cannot serve God with their gift because of complex because of comparison. &gt;&gt; They are very gifted. But Satan was able to make them believe that this other person is more gifted &gt;&gt; and it created a complex that put them down and paralyzed them &gt;&gt; and now they cannot fulfill God's plan for their lives. But you can be free tonight &gt;&gt; from this sickness. No pills needed, no meds needed. Christ looking at yourself in the mirror but realizing that you are being transformed in the image of Christ from glory to glory never forgive it then never forget it rather never forget it will change your life let's pray thank you Jesus for this moment you've given us tonight and for this crucial topic you've placed on my heart for the youth. But my only prayer as this meeting comes to an end is that these words will not leave. &gt;&gt; But but we will meditate on these and &gt;&gt; that we would not be people that look in the mirror but forget instantly who we are as we move. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us to always remember to anchor our souls in where we come from, who we are. We come from you. We are your sons and daughters and we have been perfectly wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; And you are transforming us from glory to glory. And Lord, put in us this d desire to please you and no one else. May this be an anchor, a decision that is made tonight, &gt;&gt; an anchor. Lord, we want to please you. &gt;&gt; Help us to just remain focused on your will and your plan for our lives and and just keep our eyes on you, the author and finisher of all things. I ask it for your people here in New Zealand and these youths present tonight. May this may this meeting and this subject change their lives and allow allow them to walk in the path and the plans you have for their lives. This is my prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Can we just sing a song? Do you know the song? He knows my name. I have a maker. I have a maker. [Music] He formed my heart. [Music] Oh, before even time began, my life was in his hand. Oh, cuz he knows my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. He sees each that falls and he hears me where I call. I have a father. Think of that tonight. I have a father and he calls me his own. He calls me his own. And no matter what I do, he will never leave me. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows. [Music] He knows my day. [Music] He knows my every thought. [Music] He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. He calls. [Music] He called my name. [Music] He knew me in his thoughts. He saw me before time. And I heard him when he called. [Music] He knows my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. [Music] He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. Amen. What a powerful powerful service tonight. Amen. Like our brother said, it's not some deep revelation or anything, but this can and will change our lives if we submit to it. And I and I believe there's none of us spared from it. Like a brother said, it's natural for us to compare ourselves. It's in our DNA, in our makeup, to compare ourselves with others. But if you really look at who you are, if you really get the revelation that you're a son of God, that you come from God, that he put that perfect picture of you in his family album before time began. And when you then say, "I'm not good enough," you're telling God he's a liar. If you then say, "I will never match up," you make God a liar. If you compare your life with others, what you're doing is you're not looking at the picture of you that was in the book of life before the foundation of the world. And in very simple simple terms, whatever the path is that God cut out for your life, what you have, what you don't have, where you live, what you do, you know, what your circumstances are, if we can just recognize, in fact, I've recently preached about it. That's the power of the eagle anointing is to see who you are. If you just recognize who I am, and I love how a brother brought in tonight, if you know who you want to please. I mean, it's so dumb really. I'll use a Michael word. It's so dumb. It's so dumb that we that we want to impress our colleagues and we want to impress people around us because man, one of these days we're out of here in a rapture and then what what do we get from trying to impress our friends or our colleagues or whoever it is? It's so dumb. But that's just we all do it. We're all done, right? Amen. I need to find a way to use the suck word also. Like it sucks like that. be like that. Amen. But really, I would I I want to beg you to take this to heart tonight. And I've I've done the same. I I take it to heart tonight. You know, as as a minister, you sometimes compare yourself to others. You hear other people minister and you think, "Man, I wish I can do that. I wish I can preach like that." You know, it's just how we are. And and and we we we feel peer pressure and it's so dumb. you know, we we sit sometimes I sit with a bunch of other ministers and then I think, man, I don't even belong here. You know, these guys are so far ahead of me and it's so stupid because then it makes me ineffective. But if I can just find what God made me and use me for, then I can just relax in him and just say, I'm going to please my father and no matter who criticizes what or who's got whatever opinion, it doesn't matter. Amen. So, I encourage you as we go across the road to uh to fellowship and have a few snacks and stuff that you ask brother Joel a few questions and um let's let's go and fellowship a little bit. So, I'll I'll hand over to you Arnote and then you can sing a few songs and then come. We're going to go across Joseph will you lock up when we when you come. All right. Well, we'll see you all there God willing and thanks for coming again. [Music] They just stand on our feet. Sing that chorus one more time. He knows my name. [Music] Oh, he knows my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. Amen. Such a powerful fall. So simple but so powerful. We appreciate that. Thank you, brother Joel. Let's sing this. Uh God's got to prove we're one in a million. Eagles call weird. It's a faith to rise into. It's a way that God can show the world that Jesus Christ is true. Oh, it's a life to live a testimony blameless. Living for Christ standing every day. Oh, God's got to prove we're one in a million. He's got to show power of the blood. Oh, his love is pride is not the same. And he's going to show that we're a people that this world isn't worthy of represent representative of Christ in the field you've been playing. [Music] Always glowing on your face. Living humble following touch with the sunrise in this day. Oh, God's going to prove we're one in a million. He's going to show the power of the blood. Oh, his pro is brightest from Saint and he's going to show that we're a people that this world is worthy of by his grace. By his grace we are going to stand. We keep our in the midst of belieing. We keep looking to the unseen. Really know that we will overcome and receive his promise to sit on his throne. God's got a pro. We want a million. He's going to show the power of the pro is not from us. And he's going to show that we're a people that this world is worthy of. Oh, God's going to prove we want a million. He's going to show our life is not the same as he and he's going to show that we're a people that this world is worthy of. Amen. We'll sing God is good all the time. We won't do the bridge. We'll just uh I'll go easy on you guys. God is good. God is good all the time. The song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest night. His light shine.

God is good. God is good all the time. Amen. God is good. Jason, could I ask you to close in prayer for us if that's all right? If you could pray for the food as well, we would appreciate that. Thank you. Let's bow our heads. Thank you, Lord, so much for the word you've blessed us with tonight, Lord Jesus. I thank you for bringing Brother Joel safely all this way over from Canada, Lord. And I thank you for the word that you've blessed us with, Lord Jesus. I pray that it might speak to the people here tonight, Lord, because it affects so many of us, Lord Jesus. I pray that you might continue to reveal yourself to us, Lord Jesus, and what you have for us, Lord. May we, each of us, Lord God, try to be the best version of ourselves that you want us to be, Lord, and not to be some twisted version of what we see in someone else, Lord. We are each so unique and so individual. And God has made us for a special and specific purpose. And may you just continue to lead and guide us towards that purpose. I pray in the most precious and holy name. Lord God, may you bless the food and the fellowship later on, Lord God, in thy most precious and holy name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, bro. Thank you everyone. God bless you all. Hope you have a wonderful evening and sure everyone knows we've only got a few visitors, but just straight across the road by the Alres house and we'll meet together again for a few snacks and some fun and fellowship. Bless you guys. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
