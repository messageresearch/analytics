[0:01] Uh if you wouldn't mind, we'll just
[0:03] maybe pray one more time.
[0:06] Our dearest heavenly father, Lord,
[0:09] as we stand here tonight, Lord God,
[0:12] though we may not feel worthy to stand
[0:14] here, Lord Jesus, and
[0:17] though Lord, you know the road that
[0:19] brought us here, heavenly father, but
[0:22] Lord, this we're not looking to us or
[0:26] anything else tonight, Father God, but
[0:28] we're looking to you, Lord. The only one
[0:30] who can meet every single need that we
[0:32] have, Lord Jesus. Lord, and we know,
[0:36] heavenly father, as a as a human, we may
[0:38] want to help somebody else, Lord God, as
[0:40] a man, Lord, but we know we can do
[0:43] nothing without you, Lord God, but with
[0:45] you, we can do all things, heavenly
[0:47] father. Lord, so we just surrender
[0:49] ourselves to you tonight, heavenly
[0:50] father. And I pray, Lord, you touch the
[0:53] people, Father God. May you just
[0:57] may you speak to where they are. I pray,
[0:58] Father, and may they know it's you,
[1:00] Lord, for we know a man can't help. So,
[1:04] we thank you for it in the name of the
[1:06] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:09] Thank you guys.
[1:14] Just put that there.
[1:16] All right. Um, God bless you all.
[1:20] Uh, greet you in the name of the Lord
[1:22] Jesus Christ. Um, it's good to good to
[1:25] see all you guys and um want to thank
[1:28] brother Al for the opportunity to
[1:31] to be here.
[1:34] Um,
[1:42] see if we can get that to change real
[1:44] quick.
[1:47] There we go.
[1:51] All right. Praise the Lord.
[1:55] Um,
[1:58] pretty nervous, but we thank the Lord.
[2:01] Anyway, I um maybe before we start,
[2:04] we'll just we'll just start with the
[2:06] scripture.
[2:08] I like what the prophet always said, "My
[2:09] word might fail, but his never will."
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16] We'll just go to St. St. John 142 and um
[2:33] and um he brought him to Jesus and when
[2:36] Jesus beheld him uh speaking about this
[2:40] is Simon here and when Jesus beheld him
[2:43] he said thou art Simon the son of Jodah
[2:46] Jonah you know, thou shalt be called
[2:48] Caophosis, which is interpreted a stone.
[2:51] So, this is this is where um this is
[2:54] where Peter got his name. All right. Uh
[3:00] I just uh I'd like to ask if uh is is
[3:03] anyone
[3:05] um from Paris,
[3:11] anybody from the vintage area
[3:14] era?
[3:18] Oh, come on now. Ended in the 20s,
[3:23] but you all look like you're from there.
[3:26] So, what's what's going on? But you're
[3:28] not that. So, you see I think we can
[3:31] sometimes look like something that we're
[3:32] not, you know?
[3:34] &gt;&gt; And that that's our thought tonight. Um,
[3:37] I'd just like to maybe I'll leading into
[3:39] it, I just
[3:43] in praying to come here. um knowing that
[3:46] there's nothing I could say that would
[3:48] would help you.
[3:50] Um so we're we're completely dependent
[3:52] on the Lord tonight.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Um but
[3:57] a thought kind of came to me. It
[3:59] actually brought back a memory of a a
[4:01] pivotal time in my life when I was
[4:03] actually the same age as you guys, which
[4:05] I'm not far off from you now, but this
[4:07] is a little while ago. and um and um I'
[4:11] I'd been
[4:13] doing my thing. I was uh at the time I
[4:15] was actually uh a pipeliner in Canada
[4:18] and that's who I was. Um that's what I
[4:22] did for work and that's who I thought I
[4:24] was. And um I I got I ended up, you
[4:29] know, wasn't serving the Lord or
[4:30] anything like that, but I end up getting
[4:32] a phone call from an uncle of mine who
[4:34] was a Christian. And whenever I was
[4:36] around him or around Christians or
[4:39] whoever I was around, that's what I was
[4:40] doing. That's who I was. So,
[4:43] um, anyway, he he rung me up one day and
[4:47] he said
[4:49] he said, "Who are you? Do you even know
[4:51] who you are?" And this coming to to me
[4:54] at 22 years old, of course, I'm a
[4:57] pipeliner. I know who I am. Like, come
[4:59] on. Um, but but he asked me the
[5:03] question. He just said, "Who are you?"
[5:04] He said, "I'm not telling you to be this
[5:05] or be that." And I think that's that's
[5:08] an important thing. We you can't tell
[5:10] someone to be this or be that. You can't
[5:12] as much as I I could stand here and ask
[5:14] you to be
[5:16] Oh, yeah. Just up there. Good. Thanks,
[5:18] brother. All right. Bless you.
[5:26] As much as um I might ask you to be from
[5:28] Paris from the 1920s, you can look the
[5:30] part. I mean, we all look the part,
[5:32] don't we?
[5:33] But that's your efforts and that's how
[5:36] far it'll get you.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; And um you know how many we all go to a
[5:42] message church I believe, don't we?
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just look the part.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; And that's okay. That's what we do.
[5:50] We're humans. We blend.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; But at some point it's something's got
[5:56] to change
[5:58] &gt;&gt; cuz you can't just go around looking the
[6:00] part. What good does that do you
[6:02] &gt;&gt; know?
[6:03] And at some point you got to be asked
[6:05] the the the question comes at some
[6:07] point. See this is it's funny because
[6:09] this question who are you? If we look at
[6:13] um there was there's these guys in in in
[6:15] the Bible um and um I could go to the
[6:19] scripture but we'll just just stay with
[6:21] me here for time sake. Anyway, they go
[6:23] to cast out a devil and they said, you
[6:26] know, they they're using they say Jesus
[6:28] and whom Paul preached of. And the devil
[6:30] goes, Jesus I know and Paul I know, but
[6:33] who are you?
[6:34] &gt;&gt; And and what are you going to do? This
[6:36] is this is the question that Satan comes
[6:37] to you with. This is the question Satan
[6:39] came to me with. That's how I know.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; And um what are you going to do when the
[6:43] question comes to you?
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; You know, are you going to go, hey,
[6:47] don't you know who I am? My mom and dad
[6:49] been in this church this whole time. my
[6:50] dad preaches or you know my my mom and
[6:53] dad help set up the tables.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Your mom I know your dad I know but who
[6:56] are you?
[6:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; You know
[6:59] &gt;&gt; and and when the question comes here's
[7:01] the beautiful thing about it
[7:04] and and the question this is really what
[7:06] Satan was asking Eve in the garden. Who
[7:08] are you?
[7:09] &gt;&gt; You know but when the question comes
[7:14] you it's already been answered.
[7:20] This is the answer. This is the only
[7:23] answer. Okay?
[7:25] &gt;&gt; This is the only thing that can tell you
[7:27] where you came from,
[7:29] &gt;&gt; who you are. Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; And where you're going.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; God answered it for you. Now, the
[7:35] question, the problem is where we get in
[7:38] trouble is we try to answer the
[7:40] question.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; We try to answer the question, well, I'm
[7:47] Can you see who I am? I'm vintage Paris,
[7:49] man.
[7:51] But
[7:53] &gt;&gt; you were never called to answer the
[7:54] question. You were called to accept the
[7:56] answer.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; That's that's what you were called to
[8:01] do. This is you were born for this.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; You were born to accept the answer.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is pretty cool because, you
[8:11] know, in school
[8:14] I never I I was homeschooled, but I, you
[8:17] know, I played played the man, not the
[8:19] game. All right? So, I cheated.
[8:22] All right. But I I found the answer key.
[8:26] I didn't understand the answer. All
[8:28] right. And I didn't um I wouldn't say I
[8:32] I had uh
[8:34] Yeah, I did. I wouldn't say I understood
[8:36] the answer. I still don't. All right.
[8:38] But I the the point is I had the answer.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with the
[8:42] answer? You've been given the answer key
[8:44] to life.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm lazy. I don't like to study and
[8:49] this that and the other for especially
[8:51] when it comes to school. I like to study
[8:53] God's word. And I'm sure you all do. But
[8:56] it's still hard. But
[8:59] you've been handed the answer key to
[9:01] life.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with it?
[9:05] It's not
[9:08] mom was this, dad was this, or my
[9:10] brother was this, or
[9:12] &gt;&gt; I'm New Zealander.
[9:15] Like, you know what? New Zealand. I
[9:18] know. Who are you?
[9:24] &gt;&gt; You know, it's funny because Peter,
[9:28] if you'd asked Peter before Jesus came
[9:30] to him who he was, he'd have said, "I am
[9:33] Simon. I'm a fisherman. I'm this. I'm
[9:35] that. What you do isn't who you are.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Who you are is why you do what you do.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; All right. It's
[9:48] you know how Peter Peter backslid.
[9:51] All right. He denied Jesus. Denied Jesus
[9:55] you know three times before the
[9:56] cockcrow.
[9:58] Um, we could go back even, you know, a
[10:02] after Jesus passed away. Where did he
[10:04] where did he find him? He found him
[10:06] naked fishing in a boat.
[10:08] Did he go back to being called Simon?
[10:11] &gt;&gt; No.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Did he Did he lose his name?
[10:15] &gt;&gt; You've been given a name. You are the
[10:16] sinless, spotless bride of Jesus Christ.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; You have been given a name. Why? Why has
[10:22] Christ come? He's come to tell you your
[10:25] name,
[10:27] &gt;&gt; who you are. That's right.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; You just got to accept it.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; And
[10:42] yeah,
[10:44] it's just beautiful. You're not going to
[10:46] just cuz you backslid or whatever
[10:49] whatever state you're in. Um I don't
[10:52] know you guys and you probably don't
[10:54] know me. Maybe some of you do, but it um
[10:58] that doesn't change who you are.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; It's just a point in time in life.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; I might actually just read a quote here.
[11:08] Um
[11:11] on that um
[11:16] actually before that I'll just give a
[11:18] little personal testimony. You know, a
[11:21] about a week and a half ago, I backslid.
[11:23] You know, we do. I I went backwards. I I
[11:26] uh you know, you kind of life gets real
[11:29] busy and whatnot and then I you know,
[11:31] you get caught up in death scrolling on
[11:33] YouTube on the shorts and whatnot. And
[11:36] does that mean I'm not saved?
[11:40] Does Does that mean does that whether I
[11:42] backslid a week and a half ago or not?
[11:44] Whether I've stood here stood with the
[11:46] Lord for 50 years, does that any of that
[11:48] give me a right to be here?
[11:50] &gt;&gt; No. We're we're not it's not anything we
[11:54] can do.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; We just got to accept grace.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; We have to accept it.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; It's here's a quote from brother Brandon
[12:03] in the to in the token uh paragraph 178
[12:06] here friends. If you ever was healed, if
[12:08] you if you live long enough, you're
[12:11] going to get sick again. But you you if
[12:14] you take one time, take the token,
[12:17] you've had it forever. grieve not the
[12:20] Holy Spirit, whereby you are sealed unto
[12:22] the day of your redemption. Not to the
[12:24] next revival. You wasn't sealed. You You
[12:27] wasn't sealed until the day um whereby
[12:30] you were sealed until the day of your
[12:31] redemption. Not to the next revival. You
[12:33] wasn't sealed. I'm just having trouble
[12:36] here. You got emotionally worked up, but
[12:39] you are dead. And your life is hid
[12:42] through Christ. And you are sealed by
[12:45] the Holy Ghost. If you are once baptized
[12:48] into that Holy Spirit, now you can
[12:51] backslide. That's true. But you can't
[12:54] get away from that seal. You're sealed
[12:56] into it.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Whatever Whatever happens in life, stuff
[13:03] happens. Life happens. It does.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; It just does.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; But what are you going to do with the
[13:11] answer key?
[13:17] We thank the Lord. Eh,
[13:19] &gt;&gt; he knew. He knew we were going to fail.
[13:22] He knew we couldn't do it.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; He knew we would try to dress up and
[13:27] look the part.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; And he saw right through it.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Sometimes we even
[13:35] fool ourselves for a little bit.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; But
[13:40] we thank the Lord that he allows us to
[13:42] see through it, too. Yeah.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; You know, and only he can do that for
[13:46] us.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; You know,
[13:49] what could Peter do for himself? What
[13:52] would Simon do for himself? Is he going
[13:54] to just hop out of his fishing boat one
[13:56] day and call himself Peter?
[13:59] He he could have, but we we we see
[14:04] Christ coming.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; That's what brought about the change.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[14:19] in um
[14:21] just going to in Matthew 6:27.
[14:38] It says, "Which of you by taking thought
[14:41] can add one cubit unto his stature?"
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Do you want to make yourself better?
[14:49] &gt;&gt; You can't.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Only God can.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You got the cheat code.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:07] You know, it um this is something the
[15:09] Lord really dealt with me on. Um I've
[15:11] seen some of you um through the years at
[15:13] the youth camp and this last youth camp
[15:16] I was I was really struggling physically
[15:18] and everything else. Um I was just like,
[15:20] man, I don't know if I can keep doing
[15:21] this. Like I don't know if I'm going to
[15:22] be able to. We got we got two kids now,
[15:24] you know, and life gets busy.
[15:28] But the Lord really helped me with this
[15:31] cuz um if I'm never able to help out
[15:34] again, that doesn't change who I am.
[15:37] And if you're never able to do anything,
[15:40] if Brother Al is never able to preach
[15:42] another sermon,
[15:44] that doesn't stop him from being the
[15:46] bride of Jesus Christ.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; If
[15:52] if he could never serve another person,
[15:57] &gt;&gt; it doesn't change who he is.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; You see, what you do is not who you are.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; But who you are will make you do what
[16:06] you do.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; You see the difference? If somebody
[16:11] walked in here from the 1920s and came
[16:13] dressed the same as us, he'd be doing
[16:16] the same thing we're doing, but it's
[16:18] different.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; It's just different.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It'd be a lot easier
[16:24] on him than it is on some of us.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Because it's real.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what this word is. It's real.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; That's that's what that's what God is.
[16:37] He's real. And I I know you you all know
[16:39] this and I'm not gonna tell you anything
[16:42] you don't know,
[16:44] &gt;&gt; but
[16:47] the an the question of who you are is
[16:51] just not for you to answer.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; But point it to the answer. What did
[16:57] Jesus do when he was here? When he was
[16:59] tempted? When he was led away. And I'd
[17:01] like to add this part here. Jesus was
[17:03] led away into the desert by the spirit
[17:05] to be tempted.
[17:07] of Satan.
[17:10] You You think just because you fall into
[17:12] temptation, it's because of something
[17:14] you've done wrong. You're led there by
[17:15] the spirit of God. Sons and daughters of
[17:17] God are led of the spirit of God.
[17:33] I just love that because
[17:36] we just got to accept what he's done for
[17:38] us. Brother Brham tells a story about
[17:40] how his wife and um
[17:44] before he gets married, she had her her
[17:46] last name,
[17:47] &gt;&gt; but after the marriage, she had his last
[17:49] name. And then what she did was in the
[17:53] name of brother Brown, William Brown in
[17:56] in the name of Brown because that's his
[17:57] wife.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are?
[18:03] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; You know what you do is in the name of
[18:09] Christ.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; It's not your strength.
[18:19] And thank the Lord for that because we
[18:20] run out of it.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; We do. You if you haven't come to the
[18:23] end of your rope yet, you will.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; He lets us do that and that's his grace
[18:27] so that we know so that we can know that
[18:31] we can't do it
[18:33] &gt;&gt; but that he did.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; See my wife over there, there's things
[18:43] she can't do. She can't carry heavy
[18:45] load. She's a little woman.
[18:49] What kind of husband would I be if I if
[18:51] I tried to make her do it? If knowing
[18:53] she couldn't do it
[18:56] &gt;&gt; and if I as a natural man
[18:59] with the love that's in my heart for her
[19:01] wouldn't let her do it. How much more
[19:04] are loving our savior Jesus Christ
[19:08] when he sees you struggling under that
[19:09] load that you were never meant to carry
[19:12] &gt;&gt; that Satan tried to put on you.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; It's not yours.
[19:18] Yeah,
[19:19] &gt;&gt; it's not. And then Satan coming to you.
[19:21] Who are you? Who are you? I know this. I
[19:23] know this about you. I know that. It's
[19:25] like, do you know my Lord?
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Talk to him. He said it.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; I might not even see it.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; That's fine.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; He said it.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; You know, you could you could come up to
[19:39] my wife and say,
[19:41] you know, who are you? Who are you? Sort
[19:43] of thing. what you know what what
[19:45] business do you got hanging out with
[19:47] that guy? It would probably be the other
[19:48] way around, let's be honest. But but
[19:53] she just said, "Go talk to him."
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; And and I and I I believe that's what we
[20:01] need to do cuz the devil's just in our
[20:03] ear 24/7.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; You know what? Go talk to my husband.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; So he can recognize him. He just uses
[20:13] that approach. He's just slicker. Like,
[20:16] what kind of what kind of guy is going
[20:18] to come up and talk to my wife
[20:21] &gt;&gt; about about her and carry on?
[20:26] &gt;&gt; You just recognize it right there from
[20:28] their approach.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; It's not coming through the door.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Anyone that doesn't come through the
[20:35] door is a thief and a robber.
[20:58] Are you living off a past reputation,
[21:02] off a past experience?
[21:04] If you look at the children of Israel,
[21:06] God never respected them on what they
[21:09] had been.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; He treated them on how they were
[21:12] currently.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; But they were still the children of
[21:20] Israel.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; They were still his people.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Whatever state you're in doesn't change
[21:28] who you are to him.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:34] But we're not living off any
[21:38] past deposits in the bank.
[21:41] Let's get a fresh experience.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:45] It's
[22:00] in um
[22:03] in who do you say this is in um 64,
[22:08] brother Brandham paragraph 66 he says
[22:10] just notice how how few recognize him
[22:13] him to be the anointed word of that day.
[22:17] See God in the beginning being infinite
[22:19] and know all things from the beginning.
[22:21] And the only thing that these things are
[22:25] is the display of his attributes. An
[22:27] attribute. You have an attribute. That's
[22:30] your thought. You you think of something
[22:34] and then you speak it. Then you take it.
[22:38] That's God. He in the beginning. If
[22:40] you're if you ever was or ever will be
[22:43] in heaven,
[22:46] you was in heaven to start with.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; All right.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; You can't buy your way in.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Can't can't buy the right suit. Look the
[22:56] part.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; He did that for you.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[23:03] He's in heaven to start with. You're
[23:05] you're part of God.
[23:09] That's really what you are.
[23:13] You were his thought. He knew your name.
[23:16] He knew who you are. Who you were before
[23:19] there ever was a molecule.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Before there was a light, before there
[23:24] was anything, he knew you and your name.
[23:27] So this guy that's coming to you and
[23:29] asking you who you are,
[23:33] well, if he doesn't know, get lost.
[23:36] You were before him.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; And you are after him.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; It's who you are.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; He's got to get with the program.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; God said it.
[23:57] Before there was anything, he knew you
[23:59] and your name and put it on the Lamb's
[24:01] book of life. Before the world was ever
[24:03] formed. See, you were his thought and
[24:07] then uh then you became a word. And a
[24:10] word is a thought expressed and then
[24:15] you're manifest.
[24:18] That's who you are.
[24:21] The bride of Jesus Christ.
[24:29] You know the um I'm sure we all know the
[24:32] story about the the the slave when the
[24:36] the guy went to the markets and he
[24:37] seemed there's this one slave and he
[24:39] just kind of conducted himself a bit
[24:40] differently.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; You know if um I'm sure we all know that
[24:46] story you guys are all well taught, well
[24:49] raised.
[24:52] But see that that guy knew who he was.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; But he didn't come to the own
[25:00] conclusion. You know who told him who he
[25:02] was? His father.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; He's a son of a king.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; And that's that's that's who you are.
[25:10] Son of a king.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; You're kings and priests, chosen of God.
[25:15] Amen.
[25:27] you know, um
[25:31] yeah, it's it's it's just very easy to
[25:33] get caught up in thinking what we do is
[25:35] who we are. I I just really my whole
[25:38] life I was just looking for acceptance.
[25:41] Um just wanted to be whoever I I grew up
[25:45] I'll tell you a little bit about myself.
[25:47] I grew up kind of all over the place. Uh
[25:50] we moved around a lot as a kid
[25:53] and uh just always wanted to fit in. Um
[25:57] it's funny because when I I grew
[26:00] originally I was I was born in America
[26:02] and then to Canada and then America and
[26:04] then Canada and then America and but
[26:07] when
[26:09] wherever I went just just looking for
[26:11] that acceptance and I know that's what
[26:12] each and every one of us want. We just
[26:15] want that acceptance um from our from
[26:17] our peers, from the guys at work or
[26:20] whatever. We just want to be one of
[26:21] them.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; It's that's natural.
[26:24] But
[26:28] you you can't fit in with something that
[26:31] you're not.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; If you ever
[26:34] in woodworking or whatever, if you ever
[26:36] take a square peg and try to hammer it
[26:38] down a round hole,
[26:40] &gt;&gt; you wonder why you get so tied up in
[26:43] knots. And uh and it's just so hard to
[26:46] carry on. It's because it's not you.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; And um
[26:52] and you don't have to take my word for
[26:54] it. Just consult the cheat code.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; All right. It's a guaranteed 100% every
[27:00] time.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; It's pretty good.
[27:04] And I know it works.
[27:07] I could show you my grade my grade
[27:09] average at school. It was pretty good.
[27:11] Especially for somebody who's not
[27:13] educated.
[27:17] But you've been given the answer key to
[27:18] life. What are you going to do with it?
[27:22] I um
[27:25] won't take any more of your time. The
[27:28] help of the Lord.
[27:30] Just if you were helped at all tonight,
[27:32] just know it's not us, it's the Lord.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; We can't help each other. Only God can.
[27:42] [Applause]
[27:47] Amen. That's so good. That's uh it's
[27:51] just so real, brothers and sisters. You
[27:53] know, it's it's something that we that
[27:55] we so programmed as human beings is that
[27:59] we need to earn. We need to be good
[28:02] enough. We need to, you know, produce
[28:04] the goods. we need to um somehow meet a
[28:08] standard or meet a requirement or buy
[28:11] our access to God. You know, Brother
[28:12] Brandon makes statements. He says if if
[28:16] we could do anything
[28:19] if if we had anything to do with our
[28:20] salvation, Jesus Christ died in vain.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; And the his intention is not for for us
[28:27] to meet God halfway.
[28:29] God is not God is not giving a a cheat
[28:32] code in the sense that if you do your
[28:34] bit um then maybe it will be good enough
[28:37] and you'll be qualifying for me to then
[28:39] add my part. There's nothing like that.
[28:41] It's all him
[28:43] &gt;&gt; and and he chose us before the
[28:45] foundation of the earth and he we were
[28:47] in his mind and there already we were
[28:49] sons and daughters of God.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's so beautiful how
[28:54] brother Bo has brought out that once we
[28:57] identify who we are, we need to accept
[28:59] who we are. And that makes us who we
[29:02] are.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we are already that. But
[29:05] in our own minds, we, you know, we think
[29:07] we're a we're a Simon when really in
[29:09] God's mind, we're a Peter. And in our
[29:12] own minds, when we look at our when we
[29:14] look at our mistakes, we look at our
[29:15] weaknesses, we look at our battles and
[29:18] oh, all the highs and lows and the
[29:20] mountain tops that we think we we a son
[29:22] of God and then we get to the valley and
[29:24] oh, I must not have been a son of God.
[29:26] It doesn't work like that at all.
[29:29] From God's perspective, you were sealed
[29:31] before the foundation of the earth.
[29:32] Brother Rana makes that awesome
[29:34] statement where he says that the that
[29:37] wedding ring was put on our finger
[29:39] before the foundation of the earth.
[29:40] Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Already there.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; And really, we don't have a choice in
[29:47] the matter
[29:48] &gt;&gt; if God chose us.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, there's, you know, you
[29:52] remember that story of the guy who um
[29:55] who testified at work to another guy and
[29:57] he handed him a spoken word book and and
[30:00] the guy came back and he said, "Don't
[30:02] ever give me a book like that again."
[30:03] Because the man in that book called me a
[30:05] buzzard. And he said, "My goodness, I
[30:08] can't believe that. I read the same book
[30:10] and he called me an eagle.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; And that's really what it's about. You
[30:13] know, you can say, "Well, God is unfair.
[30:15] How does he give the cheat code?" Well,
[30:18] you'll only say that if you're a
[30:19] buzzard.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; The eagle is not going to complain about
[30:23] it.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're going to say, "Thank God."
[30:26] &gt;&gt; But really, it's God's grace. It's the
[30:28] beginning to the end. It's all God's
[30:30] grace.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; But brother makes a statement. He says
[30:34] when you preach like this, people think
[30:35] that, you know, we're going to we're
[30:37] going to um I can't remember his his
[30:39] specific words, but he says we we we get
[30:42] afraid that we people are going to get
[30:44] slack.
[30:46] Really, if you know who you are, if you
[30:49] know you're a son of God, you love him.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, you want to serve him with with
[30:54] all your heart.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the whole the whole thing is
[30:58] once you recognize what your identity is
[31:00] like that son of that that king even
[31:03] though he was in a situation where he
[31:04] worked as a slave
[31:06] &gt;&gt; he was still a son of a king
[31:09] &gt;&gt; and he and he and he
[31:12] interacted with his environment. He
[31:14] interacted with people around him as if
[31:16] he was a son of a king because he knew
[31:18] who he was.
[31:20] And it's so it's so good because you
[31:23] know brother Bo has referred to
[31:25] situations like um in our work situation
[31:28] we sometimes feel we want to fit in in
[31:30] our school we we try to fit in. I I take
[31:32] my own my own um young days, you know,
[31:36] and and well, not just young days. I
[31:38] mean, there's there's always someone
[31:40] that puts pressure on you to ah just
[31:42] just have a beer with us or just come
[31:44] out to to the pub with us or, you know,
[31:47] just come watch this game with us or
[31:50] whatever it is, you know,
[31:53] you know what whatever the situation is.
[31:55] And and as as human beings, we so try to
[31:58] fit in.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; But the reality is it's the grace of God
[32:03] that doesn't let you fit in.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; It is God's grace
[32:09] because you were not made for that.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; You were made for eternity. You come
[32:13] from eternity. You go back to eternity.
[32:17] Yeah.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; And really the only place where you can
[32:20] find your identity and where you can
[32:21] find uh that sense of belonging, true
[32:26] belonging, eternal belonging is in the
[32:28] word of God
[32:29] &gt;&gt; because that's where you get that
[32:30] revelation of who I am.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:34] I know as young people very often and
[32:37] and you know you're a range of ages, but
[32:41] growing up your your
[32:46] probably some of your biggest mind
[32:48] battles is about acceptance and about
[32:51] where do I fit in? Why do I feel like I
[32:54] not I don't fit in anywhere?
[32:58] And and I want to say this to you this
[33:00] evening. Take these things that our
[33:02] brother has spoken, take it on board and
[33:05] and ask the Lord to show you it doesn't
[33:09] matter if your closest friends agree
[33:11] with you or not.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.
[33:15] God just wants you to see who you are in
[33:18] his word. And not all of us others, you
[33:21] can be a son of God. Your brother, your
[33:24] sister, your your natural brothers and
[33:26] sisters
[33:28] may not even understand you. But that
[33:30] doesn't matter because God has made you
[33:33] in a unique and specific way because he
[33:36] has something for you.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; And ultimately when you find your
[33:40] identity in Christ then that identity
[33:45] guides your decisions
[33:47] &gt;&gt; and and it doesn't make your decisions
[33:49] dependent on whether people agree with
[33:51] you or not.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; But you you as a son or a daughter of
[33:54] God, you can live out the life that God
[33:57] has predestinated for you.
[33:59] Praise the Lord. I don't want to take up
[34:01] any more time. It's uh it's been just a
[34:04] a really special time. Thank you, Bo.
[34:05] God bless you.
