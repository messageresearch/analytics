[1:00:48] brothers and sisters like this and with
[1:00:51] the setup and with the prep and with
[1:00:52] everything there's so much hard work
[1:00:55] that went into these things. But I just
[1:00:57] want to say thank you to God for you and
[1:00:59] thank you for for your effort for those
[1:01:02] things. Really appreciate it.
[1:01:04] Um we had a we had an interesting
[1:01:06] mishap. I'm sure many of you have heard
[1:01:08] about it.
[1:01:09] Um, similar to last year, thankfully
[1:01:12] last year it was during the prep time,
[1:01:13] but um, last night halfway through the
[1:01:16] evening, the fire brigade was called out
[1:01:19] because the um, presumably again the
[1:01:22] steam in the kitchen set off the the
[1:01:24] alarms and the poor young ones stand
[1:01:29] stood out in the cold for I don't know
[1:01:31] 40 minutes or something. So that put a
[1:01:33] bit of pressure on your on your evening.
[1:01:36] Um but you know at the same time the
[1:01:38] Lord really undertook for us because it
[1:01:40] was supposed to rain yesterday. Um and
[1:01:42] even in that the Lord really undertook
[1:01:44] for us. So really thankful for that. The
[1:01:46] Lord is always gracious with these
[1:01:48] things. So we don't always understand
[1:01:50] why it happens and my flesh really
[1:01:53] struggled when it happened. I was quite
[1:01:55] frustrated especially when the people
[1:01:57] who were supposed to ring the keys
[1:01:59] didn't have the keys and then all sorts
[1:02:02] of things had just extended. But God
[1:02:03] knows God knew why we needed that and
[1:02:06] all up it was a wonderful wonderful
[1:02:08] time.
[1:02:10] Um just on that front and sorry to do it
[1:02:12] here but it's probably easier. Um
[1:02:15] there's a bunch of chair covers
[1:02:17] tablecloths etc that needs to be washed
[1:02:19] and pillars just asked if if any sisters
[1:02:22] up for doing some if you can just make
[1:02:24] contact with her directly and then um
[1:02:26] that would be much appreciated if that
[1:02:28] could happen.
[1:02:31] Also, um probably don't need to remind
[1:02:33] you from here, but it's maybe worth a
[1:02:35] while. I won't be here, so it won't
[1:02:37] affect me, but um daylight savings next
[1:02:39] Sunday. So, uh just remember that.
[1:02:44] And then since I I'm leaving on Tuesday,
[1:02:48] um going to the US for a week, um God
[1:02:51] willing, I'll be back Wednesday after.
[1:02:53] Um but, um I'm I'm not going to be here
[1:02:57] next Sunday. So I would like to wish the
[1:03:00] October birthday babies a happy birthday
[1:03:03] today. So we have a few. On the 4th,
[1:03:06] Sister Chavevel, on the 9th, Sister
[1:03:08] Tracy, on the 14th, um Joshua Sevenster,
[1:03:13] Simon Oliver, and on the 25th, Lzelle
[1:03:18] on Ferin. May God bless you each one on
[1:03:22] a on your day and give you a very
[1:03:23] special day also. Really blessed year
[1:03:26] ahead.
[1:03:29] Um,
[1:03:31] and then I I also will just
[1:03:35] um ask for your prayer for the trip.
[1:03:38] I've been battling with my health a
[1:03:40] little bit over the last week. Um, just
[1:03:42] really ask that the Lord will will keep
[1:03:44] his hand over me. Um, like I've I've
[1:03:47] said a couple of times, the motive is to
[1:03:49] attend those brothers meetings. So,
[1:03:50] thankfully, I'm only going to do one
[1:03:52] service uh preach one service there, and
[1:03:54] that's on Wednesday night there for
[1:03:55] brother Barry coffee.
[1:03:57] Um but um so it's not going to be a work
[1:04:00] trip in that sense. Um I'm going to
[1:04:03] really um spend some time in fellowship
[1:04:05] and go to learn and go to see how they
[1:04:07] do things. So really excited about the
[1:04:10] trip. But also please keep the brothers
[1:04:12] in prayer who will be ministering here.
[1:04:16] Brother Jonathan, do we still have that
[1:04:17] PowerPoint up that we had up before
[1:04:21] service?
[1:04:23] Um yeah, that's exactly the one there.
[1:04:25] Can you just put that slide up?
[1:04:32] Let me just grab that one. Whoops.
[1:04:37] How do you do that?
[1:04:43] There we go. Isn't that just amazing?
[1:04:49] It really struck me when I when I saw
[1:04:51] that. If we believe not, in other words,
[1:04:54] if we in a lie, if we battle, if we
[1:04:56] struggle with the flesh, if there's
[1:04:58] things that block our faith, yet he
[1:05:00] abideth faithful, he cannot deny
[1:05:02] himself. Now, there's two things that I
[1:05:05] mean, I just feel like preaching.
[1:05:08] There's two things that just jumped out
[1:05:10] at me. Firstly, he cannot deny himself.
[1:05:12] In other words, he can't deny his
[1:05:14] attributes
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; that towards us,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; but also he can't deny us because we're
[1:05:19] part of him.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whether we believe it or not,
[1:05:23] we're still part of him.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I so love the word. It's just so
[1:05:27] beautiful.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Just thought I would share that. And uh
[1:05:31] yeah, ah the Lord is so good. Okay, I'm
[1:05:34] not going to take any more time. Thank
[1:05:35] you, brother Jonathan. Um so, Brother
[1:05:39] Boaz, I don't know if you need any
[1:05:41] further introductions.
[1:05:43] There's a few people who asked how old
[1:05:45] you are. Is it going to be very
[1:05:46] politically incorrect to ask you? How
[1:05:48] old are you?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; 30.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; 30. Exactly right. That's probably the
[1:05:53] center of the guesses that that happen.
[1:05:56] So, let's just um let's just sing one
[1:05:59] song as we call you up. Um there is none
[1:06:01] like you. Let's stand together and sing
[1:06:03] that.
[1:06:06] Yeah. Let's just sing that chorus
[1:06:07] together.
[1:06:10] There is none like
[1:06:13] you.
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:18] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:06:23] do.
[1:06:27] I could search for all eternity,
[1:06:32] Lord,
[1:06:33] and find
[1:06:35] there is none.
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:44] Heat.
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:07:00] Heat.
[1:07:09] There is no light.
[1:07:15] Amen.
[1:07:17] Let's just uh go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:07:20] Our dearest heavenly father, Lord, as we
[1:07:22] come before you this morning, Lord, we
[1:07:25] just thank you for this opportunity
[1:07:26] you've given us to be here, heavenly
[1:07:28] father, to witness you, heavenly father,
[1:07:32] in all your glory. Lord, may you just be
[1:07:34] expressed to the people this morning. I
[1:07:36] pray heavenly father and to me Lord may
[1:07:39] we just come to know you and ourselves
[1:07:41] more Lord God may we just see the
[1:07:44] intertwining Lord God as you've woven us
[1:07:47] together Lord through all eternity
[1:07:50] Lord though Satan may try to unravel it
[1:07:52] in our minds we just accept it this
[1:07:54] morning heavenly father and we come on
[1:07:56] the basis of your word we thank you for
[1:07:58] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:04] thank you musicians
[1:08:06] Um, I'd just like to greet you all in
[1:08:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Um,
[1:08:13] bring greetings from the saints back
[1:08:14] home and brother Daniel, my pastor, and
[1:08:17] Sister Cheryl. I know they love you all
[1:08:19] very much. And, um, I just want to thank
[1:08:23] you for making myself and my wife so
[1:08:25] welcome here. It's been a real honor and
[1:08:29] a privilege.
[1:08:31] Uh if we could turn in our Bibles to um
[1:08:36] um to Matthew 3 verse 15.
[1:08:48] Want to thank brother Al as well and his
[1:08:51] wife for all their efforts for last
[1:08:53] night and for making it possible for us
[1:08:55] to be here this morning. God bless you.
[1:09:01] Um,
[1:09:03] now this is this is when um
[1:09:06] maybe we'll just go back one to verse
[1:09:08] 14. And this is when Jesus had come to
[1:09:12] John. But John forbade him, saying, I
[1:09:14] have need to be baptized of thee, and
[1:09:16] comest thou to me. And Jesus answered
[1:09:19] him, saying unto him, suffer it to be so
[1:09:22] now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill
[1:09:26] all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
[1:09:30] Uh you may take your seats.
[1:09:34] Now
[1:09:37] I just love how he put it here. He
[1:09:39] didn't say to to fulfill most
[1:09:41] righteousness, to fulfill my
[1:09:43] righteousness, but he said to fulfill
[1:09:45] all righteousness.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] And um just got to forgive me. I got to
[1:09:52] bring this up. Got this one on my phone,
[1:09:54] not the tablet.
[1:09:55] Um if we go into that righteousness you
[1:09:57] can through the direct translation of
[1:10:00] that word um the verdict of approval
[1:10:07] that that's that's what what was going
[1:10:09] on here to fulfill the verdict of
[1:10:11] approval. And if we go to St. John uh
[1:10:14] 19:30.
[1:10:25] When Jesus therefore had received the
[1:10:27] vinegar, he said, "It is finished." And
[1:10:30] he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.
[1:10:35] It's finished.
[1:10:38] In case you were wondering,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; all all righteousness has been
[1:10:43] fulfilled.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Now, see, John had to humble himself to
[1:10:52] the word that was standing in front of
[1:10:53] him.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Even though John himself, I mean, who
[1:10:56] who was worthy to baptize the Christ?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Well, John was cuz he came to him. But
[1:11:05] he had to get over what he thought of
[1:11:07] himself.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just got to get over
[1:11:10] what we think about ourselves.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Doesn't really matter
[1:11:14] what what your opinion is, what your
[1:11:16] thought is. If it's contrary to the word
[1:11:18] of God, it's got to come down.
[1:11:21] Sometimes it's a harder fall than other
[1:11:24] times.
[1:11:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:30] Um,
[1:11:36] I guess this is something that's just
[1:11:37] really really struck me is um the
[1:11:40] question that's being asked the bride
[1:11:42] today is who are you?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's that's what Satan's really coming
[1:11:46] to each and every one of us with.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; I know even though we might live in
[1:11:52] different geographical locations, we all
[1:11:54] we all face the same trials. Yeah,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; they come in different ways, but
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; you know, it's it's to them that
[1:12:01] overcome. We we all we're all
[1:12:03] overcomers.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; No big overcomers, little overcomers.
[1:12:06] Just say as overcomers.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:10] Now,
[1:12:12] it's good to see you, Stephen. Going to
[1:12:15] pick on you a little bit this morning.
[1:12:17] That's all right. I know you're tough
[1:12:18] and you can take it. Stephen's my buddy
[1:12:20] down there. Um, now, like you heard last
[1:12:24] night, we had the fire alarms. they went
[1:12:26] off and um when they went off in the
[1:12:29] building, I look and I seen Steven
[1:12:31] running out the door and I was like,
[1:12:34] "Okay, well, that's a bit weird." But he
[1:12:36] told me before that he's um he's on the
[1:12:40] volunteer fire department. He's you're
[1:12:42] not not quite there yet, but you're
[1:12:44] going through the training. Um, but yet
[1:12:48] even though Stephen's not a real
[1:12:50] firefighter yet, uh, when that truck
[1:12:52] showed up, guess who was sitting in
[1:12:54] there wearing the uniform?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's my buddy. And, um, and you know,
[1:13:02] you could come up to him and say, "Hey,
[1:13:04] I know you're not a firefighter yet."
[1:13:07] And all this, but I mean, he got to ride
[1:13:10] in the truck.
[1:13:12] He was wearing the un What are you going
[1:13:13] to What are you going to say? like you
[1:13:15] don't have a qual what qualifications do
[1:13:17] you have to be in that truck
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; to be to be wearing that uniform you
[1:13:21] know but if somebody wanted to come up
[1:13:23] to him I'm sure Stephen he's pretty
[1:13:25] tough guy he'd probably he'd probably
[1:13:27] tell you tell you right off but see
[1:13:29] that's the that's the temptation that
[1:13:30] we're all faced with whenever Satan
[1:13:32] comes to us who are you we want to we
[1:13:34] want to give an answer don't you know
[1:13:36] who I am this that and the other
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; well that's just not
[1:13:45] The word tells us who we are.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And if if Steven really wanted to shut
[1:13:50] anybody down, see the guy that was
[1:13:52] driving that truck, the guy that was in
[1:13:54] charge, he's a bit of a disagreeable
[1:13:56] fellow,
[1:13:57] kind of marched in there like he owned
[1:13:59] the place and marched back out the same
[1:14:01] way. But, you know, if if Stephen wanted
[1:14:04] to stand on his own, well, he'd be all
[1:14:06] right. Depending on how many people, you
[1:14:07] know, he might might find himself in a
[1:14:09] bit of trouble. But all Stephen's got to
[1:14:10] do is say when when you go, "What right
[1:14:13] do you have to have that uniform on?
[1:14:14] What right do you got to be in that
[1:14:16] truck? Go talk to the guy that drove the
[1:14:18] truck. He said I could be here."
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what we got to do to Satan
[1:14:21] when he comes to us with all this
[1:14:22] trouble. If you got a problem with me
[1:14:24] being in the bride, go ask the one that
[1:14:27] married me.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; If you don't think I'm worthy, that's
[1:14:33] fine.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Go ask him.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; I don't think you either.
[1:14:40] So,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; but what's that got to do with anything?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord for these
[1:14:47] things. Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Just make sure we get to get in the
[1:14:53] truck. Doesn't matter about your
[1:14:55] qualifications. All right.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Love you, buddy.
[1:15:03] See, every trial in our life has been
[1:15:05] handpicked by God.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; And it's been picked in such a way where
[1:15:09] we can't overcome it.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; It's perfect.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; So, he set upon the bride in this last
[1:15:19] day an impossible task. Well, it doesn't
[1:15:21] sound like a very just God,
[1:15:24] but we know that he is.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we go to Zechariah, you
[1:15:29] don't need to turn there, but Zechariah
[1:15:30] chapter 4. Um, I might just read this
[1:15:34] whole starting from the beginning. And
[1:15:36] the angel that talked with me and with
[1:15:38] me came again and waked me as as a man
[1:15:42] that is waked out of his sleep, and said
[1:15:45] unto me, What seeest thou?
[1:15:48] And I said, I have looked, and behold, a
[1:15:50] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[1:15:54] the top of it, and his seven lamps
[1:15:56] thereon, and seven pipes, and seven
[1:15:58] lamps, which are upon and upon the top
[1:16:01] thereof, and the two olive trees by it
[1:16:04] upon one upon the right side of the
[1:16:07] bowl, and the other upon the left side
[1:16:09] of the bowl. So, pardon me. So I
[1:16:13] answered him and spake answered and
[1:16:15] spake to the angel that talked with me,
[1:16:17] saying, "What are these, my Lord?"
[1:16:22] You know, sometimes we just need to stop
[1:16:25] and ask.
[1:16:27] We don't need to try and work out what
[1:16:28] it is.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Just stop and ask. Look at Look at the
[1:16:32] humility of Zachariah here. He said,
[1:16:35] "What are these, my Lord?"
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; He's seen the vision,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; but what what is it?
[1:16:42] Amen. And and that's that's like each
[1:16:44] and every one of us when the word comes
[1:16:46] forth, we see it. But okay, Lord, what
[1:16:48] is it? You know,
[1:16:52] then the angel that talked with me and
[1:16:53] answered said unto me, "Knowest thou not
[1:16:56] what these be?" Now, that's about when
[1:16:58] most of us pipe up and go, "Oh, yeah.
[1:17:00] No, see those those seven candlesticks.
[1:17:02] Yeah, no, they're you know, but and he
[1:17:05] said, "No, my Lord."
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Such humility. Then he answered and
[1:17:09] spake unto me, saying, This is the word
[1:17:11] of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying,
[1:17:13] "Not by might, nor by power, but by my
[1:17:16] spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; How do we do an impossible task? Do we
[1:17:22] train for it?
[1:17:24] You know, if I wanted to join the
[1:17:26] firefight department with Stephen and I
[1:17:29] went and trained in what I thought was
[1:17:32] required,
[1:17:35] it doesn't really do me any good.
[1:17:38] because that's not what's required. See,
[1:17:40] Steven's joined the firefighting
[1:17:42] department. The training's come after.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; And um a lot of times we think we got to
[1:17:50] do something, be something, whatever
[1:17:52] else. But
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; you just accept his word, get in, he'll
[1:17:57] worry about the training.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord for that.
[1:18:04] Because it's not by power, not by might,
[1:18:06] not by studying, not by this, not by
[1:18:08] that, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's no no more studying that
[1:18:16] probably has ever been done than by the
[1:18:17] Pharisees and Sadducees. And they missed
[1:18:19] it when he stood right in front of them.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And and we'll miss it, too, if he
[1:18:24] doesn't reveal it to us.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It's just the way it is. It's got to be
[1:18:28] God. All God, not the grace of God.
[1:18:32] That's his grace is this is what brother
[1:18:35] Daniel's been preaching on back home on.
[1:18:36] But the grace is God's works.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; It's not our works and God's works. It's
[1:18:42] just God.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; There's no place for us to get big in
[1:18:46] there.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; It's just him.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um our um our title tonight,
[1:18:54] if you could call it that or this
[1:18:55] morning is um the approach made by the
[1:18:58] spirit to who you are.
[1:19:00] It's a bit of a mouthful, but it's all
[1:19:02] we got. Um, praise God. Eh,
[1:19:09] but yeah. So, God set on us an
[1:19:11] impossible task. And I I really love
[1:19:13] this because if if um
[1:19:17] if you look at David, David had on his
[1:19:20] heart such a a a a beautiful thing to
[1:19:24] build the Lord a house.
[1:19:26] An impossible task. and he wanted to
[1:19:29] build build the Lord a house for the
[1:19:31] Lord to to live in. And and God said to
[1:19:33] him, he couldn't do it. There's too much
[1:19:35] blood on his hand. See, you can't do
[1:19:37] this work.
[1:19:40] You can't. It's got to be God.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; See, Solomon had to come and the work
[1:19:45] was done, but it was done by Solomon,
[1:19:48] not by David. And it's the same in our
[1:19:50] life. It's not us doing it. It's the
[1:19:51] spirit.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] says, um,
[1:19:57] if we go to, um, Matthew 6:27, I really
[1:20:01] love this one.
[1:20:12] Which of you by taking thought can add
[1:20:14] one cubit unto his stature?
[1:20:21] He set us an impossible task.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, might just go to that first
[1:20:27] slide.
[1:20:28] Psalm 65:4. Blessed is the man whom thou
[1:20:32] choost and causeth to approach unto
[1:20:34] thee, that he may dwell in thy courts.
[1:20:37] We shall be satisfied with the goodness
[1:20:39] of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
[1:20:44] um
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; the man see we think it's us coming to
[1:20:50] God but it's actually a bit more rigged
[1:20:53] than that whom now causes to approach to
[1:20:57] come near to approach enter into to draw
[1:20:59] near to I like this one if you go a
[1:21:03] little further down to be brought near
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; we are being brought near
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:21:11] praise the Lord
[1:21:13] whom thou chooses choose elect to decide
[1:21:16] for
[1:21:18] it's been decided for you.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Pressurees off.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Eh,
[1:21:31] but then when trials come,
[1:21:36] then we think we failed or we did
[1:21:38] something wrong to bring this trial upon
[1:21:39] ourselves.
[1:21:41] And this this right here has done
[1:21:43] wonders for me. Then was Jesus led up of
[1:21:46] the spirit into the wilderness to be
[1:21:48] tempted of the devil. See, when we when
[1:21:51] we get tempted, when we fall into
[1:21:52] temptation and whatever else,
[1:21:55] uh we think it's because we've we've
[1:21:57] sinned, we fall away from God or this,
[1:21:59] that, and the other. But he was led of
[1:22:02] the spirit. Sons and daughters of God
[1:22:03] are led of the spirit of God.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we we don't
[1:22:09] every time we're tempted, we don't get
[1:22:10] it right every time. That's why God gave
[1:22:13] us grace, he didn't give us something we
[1:22:14] didn't need.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have um tools in the tool
[1:22:18] belt we're not going to use. We're not
[1:22:19] getting weighed down by anything.
[1:22:22] And when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:22:24] nights afterward and hungered, and when
[1:22:27] the temp tempter came to him, he said,
[1:22:29] "If thou be the son of God, command that
[1:22:32] these stones be made of bread."
[1:22:35] See how
[1:22:37] that's the question that's on Satan's
[1:22:39] mind. It was on his mind when Jesus was
[1:22:41] here. It's on his mind with Eve and it's
[1:22:43] on his mind today. Who are you?
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And that's that's the one he he tries to
[1:22:49] get each and every one of us
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; to answer.
[1:22:54] But it's it's it's not
[1:22:57] it's not something for us to answer.
[1:22:58] It's already been answered in the word.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:03] So we can as Jesus did, we can just
[1:23:05] point them right back to it. Amen.
[1:23:09] When it says tempted, uh if you go down
[1:23:12] here, it says um to try whether a thing
[1:23:15] can be done, to try make a trial, a test
[1:23:18] for the purpose of ascertaining his
[1:23:21] quantity or what he thinks or how he
[1:23:23] will behave himself.
[1:23:26] to try the bottom one there to try or
[1:23:28] test one's faith, virtue, character by
[1:23:31] enticement to sin, hence to solicit sin,
[1:23:33] to tempt of the temptations of the
[1:23:35] devil. He was led of the spirit to that.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] See, it's by by grace that we are saved,
[1:23:56] not works, lest any of us could boast.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] I love this. Here's a quote right here
[1:24:03] from um the rising of the sun. He's the
[1:24:06] one who opened those seals. He's he's
[1:24:09] those seals. For the whole word of God
[1:24:12] is Christ, and Christ is the seals that
[1:24:15] was opened. What is the opening of the
[1:24:17] seals then? Revealing Christ. And when
[1:24:21] when and the very seven angels which
[1:24:23] represented the seven churches all
[1:24:26] completed and we couldn't even see it.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; They did. They took the picture not us.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And there he is standing there supreme
[1:24:35] judge showing that he is alpha and omega
[1:24:39] the beginning and the end. What an
[1:24:41] identification. What quickening power
[1:24:44] did that to us. Amen.
[1:24:48] What an identification we have.
[1:24:51] See, that's that's what everyone's
[1:24:53] looking for is identification in this,
[1:24:55] that, or the other, in a job, in
[1:24:58] in a country.
[1:25:00] Lord knew I would really lean on that
[1:25:02] one, so he didn't really give me one I
[1:25:03] could lean on.
[1:25:07] I'm a Canadian, American, and soon to be
[1:25:09] Australian, so praise God. Anyhow,
[1:25:16] um
[1:25:26] bear with me a second while I find this
[1:25:28] um scripture.
[1:25:53] Ah, here we go.
[1:25:57] That's it. That's the one. Praise the
[1:26:00] Lord. In the book of Acts,
[1:26:05] thank you, Lord. Verse uh chapter 19.
[1:26:19] We'll start from verse 11. And God
[1:26:22] wrought special miracles by the hands of
[1:26:24] Paul, so that his body were brought so
[1:26:27] that from his body were brought onto the
[1:26:29] sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the
[1:26:31] disease departed from them, and evil
[1:26:33] spirits went out of them. Then certain
[1:26:35] of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took
[1:26:38] upon them to call over them which had
[1:26:40] evil spirits. the name of the Lord
[1:26:42] Jesus, saying, "We adjure ye by Jesus,
[1:26:45] whom Paul preacheth."
[1:26:47] And there were seven sons of uh I can't
[1:26:51] say that word, a Jew, and a chief of the
[1:26:53] priest which did so. And the evil
[1:26:56] spirits answered and said, "Jesus I
[1:26:58] know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?"
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think this this fits perfectly
[1:27:04] to where we are. See, we've we've seen
[1:27:06] this here is the first messenger, and
[1:27:08] we've seen the last messenger. Amen. And
[1:27:12] it's just so beautiful how the these
[1:27:15] these guys come and you know Jesus we
[1:27:17] could do the same today. I come you know
[1:27:19] in the name of Jesus who who um William
[1:27:22] Brandon preached of
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; well Jesus I know William Brandom I know
[1:27:27] but who are you?
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; and that's that's you got to know where
[1:27:34] you're standing.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And you're not going to know it by your
[1:27:37] power. You're not going to know it by
[1:27:38] your might, but by the spirit.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Only God can reveal this to us.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; We just thank the Lord for what he's
[1:27:48] done.
[1:27:51] It didn't end up well for those guys.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And it won't end up well for us
[1:27:58] if we go out on our own.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But we don't stand here in our own
[1:28:03] power. We don't stand here in our own
[1:28:05] might, but by the spirit of the Lord.
[1:28:07] Amen. That's how this bride stands today
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; going on in in the same line. Quickening
[1:28:17] power lets us see is coming. Quickening
[1:28:20] power snatched us from death to life.
[1:28:23] Quickening power gives discernment to
[1:28:25] know what's wrong with you and what to
[1:28:27] do and what you have done and what you
[1:28:30] ought not have done and what you should
[1:28:32] have done and what you will be.
[1:28:34] Quickening power. all these things.
[1:28:39] Our Lord Jesus
[1:28:41] so full of quickening power. He was all
[1:28:43] of it together. He was so full of
[1:28:45] quickening power. He said, "You destroy
[1:28:47] this body and I'll raise it up in three
[1:28:49] days." Amen. Talk about confidence and
[1:28:52] quickening power. Destroy this body and
[1:28:54] I'll this temple and I'll bring it up in
[1:28:57] three days. Amen. And and it's the same
[1:29:01] today in the bride. We've been given the
[1:29:05] word. Now we just got to stand on the
[1:29:07] word that was given to us because it
[1:29:09] cannot fail.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was already spoken of him that
[1:29:13] I will not why how could he say this?
[1:29:16] Because it said I I will not suffer my
[1:29:17] holy one to see corruption. He knew the
[1:29:20] word that was spoken of him. And each
[1:29:21] and every one of us, this is what God's
[1:29:23] calling us to to know the word that is
[1:29:25] spoken of us. And you're not going to
[1:29:27] know it by power. You're not going to
[1:29:28] know it by your own might, but by the
[1:29:30] spirit of God. Amen. only he can reveal
[1:29:33] this to us.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; It's not not anything we can do, nothing
[1:29:37] less we could boast cuz we would.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; But it's by grace.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And we just thank the Lord for it.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Going on. Why? Why did he say that? He
[1:29:49] knew. Yeah. Here we go. It was written
[1:29:51] of him. See that? It was written of him
[1:29:53] by the word of God which could not fail.
[1:29:56] The word said, "I will not suffer my
[1:29:58] holy one to see corruption, neither I'll
[1:29:59] leave his soul in hell." And he knowed
[1:30:01] that quickening power would raise him up
[1:30:03] that there wouldn't be one cell corrupt.
[1:30:06] He said, "You destroy this temple and
[1:30:08] I'll bring it back again in 3 days."
[1:30:11] Why? It was prophecy, the word of God.
[1:30:14] And prophecy, if it's true, word of God
[1:30:17] cannot fail. And the same prophecy and
[1:30:20] word of God that said he'd raise him up
[1:30:22] says we are already raised with him. No
[1:30:25] wonder he said, "Fear not." And it is
[1:30:27] written that the spirit that is now was
[1:30:29] in him now in us also quickens our
[1:30:33] mortal body. Fear not friend. The sun is
[1:30:36] up. The sun is up.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I love this part here. Now
[1:30:50] look at trans look at transfiguration.
[1:30:53] We was everyone represented there.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; There was the living saints that had
[1:30:57] raptured. There was Elijah standing
[1:31:00] there and there stood Moses. The dead
[1:31:01] saints represented. Amen. If we're
[1:31:04] looking for represent representation,
[1:31:06] it's right there. Also, both of them had
[1:31:08] quickening power. Whether one died and
[1:31:11] whether one didn't die, they're all
[1:31:12] there. Amen. So, fear not, little bride.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; It's already been sorted.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Because it was becoming to fulfill all
[1:31:21] righteousness.
[1:31:22] Amen.
[1:31:27] Thank you, Father.
[1:31:33] I might just leave that one there.
[1:31:39] And um
[1:31:45] and going back to by grace we are saved,
[1:31:48] not by works, lest any of us can boast.
[1:31:50] See, we can't
[1:31:53] we can't give something we don't have.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; And it's it's grace that's been freely
[1:31:59] given to us, but we got to accept it.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; It it won't do any good if we don't
[1:32:07] accept it. See, Stephen had a seat
[1:32:10] waiting for him in that truck, but he
[1:32:11] had to accept it.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And each and every one of us, we got a
[1:32:16] seat waiting in that truck, but we just
[1:32:18] got to accept it.
[1:32:20] Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; One, the beautiful thing about it is
[1:32:24] once we accept it, see I think I seen
[1:32:25] one of the sisters get up in that truck.
[1:32:27] See, you can give freely as you've been
[1:32:30] given.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It's not just for us.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Who are you anyhow?
[1:32:46] um going on
[1:32:49] same sermon here. But remember, he went
[1:32:51] there with you in him. See, God had
[1:32:54] never separated the bride from the groom
[1:32:55] yet. So when God looked down upon the
[1:32:58] body of Christ, he saw both male and
[1:33:00] female. It was all redeemed in that one
[1:33:02] body. They are one same same word. The
[1:33:07] same word spoke of the groom, speaks of
[1:33:09] the bride. Amen. Well, how can the bride
[1:33:13] come and fail to manifest everything
[1:33:15] that was promised of him and the groom
[1:33:17] come and he wouldn't be the bride?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; But when he did everything, even to
[1:33:29] proving it by raising himself up from
[1:33:31] the dead afterwards, then don't the
[1:33:33] bride have to do the same thing? Have to
[1:33:35] be exactly what the word said she would
[1:33:38] be in these last days?
[1:33:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:46] I might go might go back on that. This
[1:33:48] is the the same service but um same
[1:33:51] sermon but a different quote. That's the
[1:33:53] paragraph 248. And when a man has said
[1:33:56] that he believes the word and when the
[1:33:58] Holy Spirit comes, it's the abstract
[1:34:01] title to the title and and gives you
[1:34:04] permission when you have that abstract
[1:34:06] that every bit of that belongs to you
[1:34:09] and everything is on it belongs to you.
[1:34:12] Amen. And that gives us the abstract
[1:34:15] when the Holy Ghost comes upon this
[1:34:17] title deed that God saw back yonder
[1:34:20] before the foundation of the world and
[1:34:22] put it name on the book of life but was
[1:34:26] born through a man and woman and subject
[1:34:29] to sin and guilty of sin. Um I get that
[1:34:34] subject to sin and guilty of sin. But
[1:34:37] when I believed on it
[1:34:39] I received the deed. But when the Holy
[1:34:42] Ghost come, it was the abstract that
[1:34:44] everything against me, whether my mother
[1:34:47] done it, my father done it, my
[1:34:48] grandmother done it, like little
[1:34:50] epileptic child I prayed for a few
[1:34:52] moments ago that had come through the
[1:34:54] grandparents. The epilepsy fell down
[1:34:57] upon the child and I said, "Oh, I've
[1:35:01] lost the next portion of that quote."
[1:35:02] See, that that child got his
[1:35:05] deliverance.
[1:35:06] Even though there's things that's been
[1:35:08] handed down to us from our parents, from
[1:35:11] other generations,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; it's not your fault.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; You don't have to bear that. You were
[1:35:17] never made to.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there's deliverance that's
[1:35:20] been provided to us in this age.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; We just got to accept it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; The devil likes to whisper in your ear
[1:35:27] and tell you he's got he's got rights to
[1:35:29] be on that land. Don't you know I was in
[1:35:31] your mom, I was in your daddy.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; He ain't got no rights.
[1:35:37] You're the purchased. You're the
[1:35:39] purchased bride of Jesus Christ. There's
[1:35:42] been a meeting at the gate.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care what he comes to you with.
[1:35:48] I don't care what your memories are.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Boaz went down to the gate and he
[1:35:52] settled everything for us.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not talking about this guy.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But our great great savior.
[1:36:01] He went down to the gate. Amen. at
[1:36:03] Gethsemane and he took back everything
[1:36:05] that was lost. Amen. He took back us.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; You are the purchased possession of
[1:36:12] Christ.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Going on, how can I overcome? In
[1:36:23] Jeffersonville, um 1963, paragraph 73.
[1:36:27] But in Noah's time, there was eight
[1:36:29] overcomers and that's what went in. They
[1:36:31] were caught inside. Now look friends, I
[1:36:34] believe they're typing this and if it's
[1:36:35] on the television or pardon type or
[1:36:37] whatever you do who is listening now or
[1:36:40] who will listen hereafter the hour is
[1:36:42] very late. This is 63 and you do have
[1:36:47] you do have good intention but be caught
[1:36:50] inside now. Don't struggle.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; This bit was for me.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Not him that willth or him that runth
[1:36:57] but God.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could just let God just just
[1:37:02] yield yourself to him and walk on with a
[1:37:06] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[1:37:08] has promised he will be able to perform.
[1:37:11] Amen.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Going to this church every day won't
[1:37:14] save you.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't if you're looking
[1:37:18] just to the church to save you.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] But let God,
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; we don't need to struggle. We don't need
[1:37:29] to try to be something we're not.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Just let God just yield yourself to him
[1:37:35] and walk on with a perfect satisfied
[1:37:38] faith.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:51] And in case we're wondering about where
[1:37:53] we may find ourselves,
[1:37:56] whether
[1:37:58] Psalms 139, whether shall I go from thy
[1:38:02] spirit or whether shall I flee from thy
[1:38:04] presence? If I ascend up into heaven,
[1:38:06] thou art there? If I make my bed in
[1:38:09] hell, behold, thou art there. If I take
[1:38:12] up wings of the morning and dwell in the
[1:38:13] uttermost parts of the sea, even there
[1:38:16] shall thy hand lead me,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; and thy right hand shall hold me.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; God's come down and he's weaved himself
[1:38:26] so into you.
[1:38:29] You are him.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; You know, when you braid two ropes
[1:38:36] together after a wall, you don't know
[1:38:38] which is which. It's cuz they're the
[1:38:40] same. That's all the rope is.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:48] In the Philadelphia church age book,
[1:38:52] uh yes, there he stands the Lord of
[1:38:54] glory. Once is the father. He was
[1:38:56] surrounded by the angels, the
[1:38:58] archangels, the cherubims and
[1:39:00] seraraphims, and the whole host of
[1:39:02] heaven crying, "Holy, holy, holy is the
[1:39:04] Lord God of hosts." Such was his
[1:39:06] holiness that no man could approach unto
[1:39:08] him. But now we see him in the church
[1:39:11] sharing his own holiness with him until
[1:39:14] in him we have become the very
[1:39:17] righteousness of God.
[1:39:20] The very righteousness of God.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Because someone had to suffer it to
[1:39:29] be so.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It behoove it becometh us to
[1:39:34] fulfill all righteousness. Amen. It was
[1:39:37] all fulfilled
[1:39:40] in him.
[1:39:43] Praise the Lord. If we just go um to
[1:39:45] Revelations
[1:39:48] chapter 19
[1:39:57] starting from uh verse verse 7.
[1:40:13] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:40:15] honor unto him. For the marriage of the
[1:40:17] Lamb is come, and his wife hath made
[1:40:19] herself ready. And to her was granted
[1:40:22] that she should be arrayed in fine
[1:40:23] linen, clean and white. For the fine
[1:40:26] linen is the righteousness of saints.
[1:40:29] Amen. We see this garment that we're
[1:40:32] clothed in,
[1:40:34] it was given to us.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You got to put it on.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to put it on. But it was
[1:40:42] given to you.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; This suit, I didn't pack it in my bag.
[1:40:47] My My precious wife did.
[1:40:51] But I still had to put it on.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; It'd be a bit of a side if I didn't.
[1:40:57] And it's the same for each and every one
[1:40:59] of us. We We got to put on what God's
[1:41:01] given to us.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; We put on his righteousness. He took our
[1:41:05] place.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That was our place.
[1:41:08] Surely
[1:41:11] surely we we could humble ourselves to
[1:41:13] take his
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; not by power, not by might
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; but by his spirit. Amen.
[1:41:30] I um
[1:41:32] just in closing here,
[1:41:36] I've always loved this This statue right
[1:41:38] here, that's Michelangelo's Moses.
[1:41:41] Brother Bram spoke about it and I've
[1:41:44] always just found it. I could just look
[1:41:45] at the photo forever.
[1:41:48] Um,
[1:41:50] this is each and every one of us. That's
[1:41:53] just a perfect masterpiece. And that's
[1:41:55] what you are. Amen.
[1:41:58] And it's just it's beautiful. And
[1:42:01] Michelangelo
[1:42:02] uh the sculptor he said he said the
[1:42:05] sculpture is already complete within the
[1:42:07] marble block before I start my work.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It is already there. I have I just have
[1:42:13] to chisel away the super flush material.
[1:42:18] Some of us got a bit more material than
[1:42:20] others.
[1:42:22] That doesn't matter.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; The masterpiece is there.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; It's in each and you are masterpieces.
[1:42:30] what you what you see when you look in
[1:42:31] the mirror does not matter
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; especially if it's contrary to the word.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Because that right there is a
[1:42:39] masterpiece.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Might not look like it, but it is.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; And he's still working on me. And I know
[1:42:49] he's still working on you cuz we're
[1:42:51] still here. Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; But you are all masterpieces whether we
[1:42:57] see it or not.
[1:43:00] You are the sinless, spotless,
[1:43:01] unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Whether it looks like it or not,
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; whether you got anything in this life
[1:43:10] that you can sink your teeth into and
[1:43:12] say, "Oh, it's this, that, or the
[1:43:14] other." You just sink your teeth into
[1:43:15] that word one time.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; You want to know about real life? You
[1:43:19] sink into that word and it doesn't
[1:43:21] matter what it looks like. You are the
[1:43:24] masterpiece. You are the sinless,
[1:43:25] unadulterated product of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:27] That's who you are. I don't care what
[1:43:29] Satan says about you. I don't care what
[1:43:32] your mom says about you. I don't care
[1:43:33] what your dad says about you, what your
[1:43:35] friends say about you. That's who you
[1:43:36] are. You just humble yourself to the
[1:43:39] word of God and you accept it. I don't
[1:43:41] care if you just look like that
[1:43:42] mountain. That mountain is full of
[1:43:44] masterpieces
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; and that's what I'm looking at tonight
[1:43:47] by the grace of God.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Let's humble ourselves to the word.
[1:43:51] Thank you, brother. God bless you all.
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:44:17] Praise the Lord. That was wonderful.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Absolutely wonderful. Amen. Things that
[1:44:24] we that we um so many different things
[1:44:28] that we look at often just came together
[1:44:30] so beautifully this morning and so many
[1:44:32] scriptures and really just reiterating
[1:44:35] for us. It doesn't matter what you think
[1:44:37] of yourself. It doesn't matter what I
[1:44:39] think of you, what I think of myself.
[1:44:41] Amen. And and the difficult part that we
[1:44:44] say as an individual is it doesn't
[1:44:46] matter what you think of me. Amen.
[1:44:49] because because we all so want to fit in
[1:44:52] and we all want to feel accepted and all
[1:44:54] of that. Amen. But ultimately there's
[1:44:56] one that has already accepted us.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Like the Bible speaks about Jacob and
[1:45:03] Esau. One have I loved, one of I hated
[1:45:05] before. Amen. Before either of them were
[1:45:08] born. Amen. And God is in the business
[1:45:12] of of chiseling off all the bits that's
[1:45:15] not his vision of us. I love that.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that we're all encouraged
[1:45:21] this morning.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; It's just lovely to have been here. It's
[1:45:24] just been a real privilege.
[1:45:28] Let me just pray and then I'll I'll ask
[1:45:30] Simon to come up. We'll sing I Have a
[1:45:32] Maker.
[1:45:34] Let's stand together.
[1:45:41] Most wonderful and loving father,
[1:45:45] Lord, I just appreciate the tender
[1:45:48] loving way in which you spoke to us this
[1:45:50] morning.
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:54] Father,
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:58] Lord, I pray that no one will go out of
[1:46:02] here
[1:46:03] that needs this to be applied to our
[1:46:07] souls, to be applied to our lives, Lord,
[1:46:11] without meeting that one,
[1:46:14] without meeting
[1:46:17] the eternal God who says it doesn't
[1:46:20] matter.
[1:46:22] Doesn't matter what you think. It
[1:46:24] doesn't matter where you think you are.
[1:46:25] It doesn't matter if you feel like
[1:46:27] you're in a valley. And at the same
[1:46:30] time, it doesn't matter if you think
[1:46:31] you're in a mountaintop
[1:46:35] because he's already taken care of it
[1:46:37] all for us. Father, you've taken care of
[1:46:40] it all for us. Oh God, we are so
[1:46:42] privileged, Lord. Father, as as human
[1:46:46] beings, we all want to work, work, work,
[1:46:48] work, work, work ourselves into
[1:46:50] something. We all want to try and
[1:46:52] present something to you. We all want to
[1:46:55] try and meet you halfway, Lord, but
[1:46:56] that's not how you work, Lord. Father,
[1:46:59] you've paid the price, Lord. You see the
[1:47:02] the masterpiece inside the block when
[1:47:05] all we see of ourselves sometime is just
[1:47:07] that ugly old block that's standing
[1:47:09] there.
[1:47:12] Father,
[1:47:14] Lord, I love how you see through our
[1:47:17] brother this morning. You've given us
[1:47:19] the robe. We just need to put it on,
[1:47:22] Father. Lord, help us just to submit.
[1:47:25] Help us just to put on the word. Help us
[1:47:28] just to put on the grace that you've
[1:47:30] given us. Help us just to surrender,
[1:47:32] Lord.
[1:47:35] Father,
[1:47:37] you've spoken it. You've given us the
[1:47:39] shout, Lord. Now, I pray that you'll
[1:47:42] give us grace to submit to the word that
[1:47:44] you've given us. Submit to the word what
[1:47:47] you say about us, Lord.
[1:47:50] Oh God, we just thank you so much. It
[1:47:52] was good to be here, Lord. I pray that
[1:47:55] you will bless us the rest of this day
[1:47:57] and that your presence will go with us,
[1:48:00] Lord Jesus. And I pray as we sing, as we
[1:48:04] enter into worship now, Lord, let this
[1:48:06] word that we've heard sink into our
[1:48:09] souls, Father, Lord Jesus, and that it
[1:48:12] will change our thinking even, Father.
[1:48:15] It will change our attitudes. It will
[1:48:18] change our lives and father raise our
[1:48:21] faith.
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:24] Give us a little more confidence, Lord,
[1:48:27] in who we are.
[1:48:30] I thank you, Father. We give you all the
[1:48:32] glory. I pray that you will bless my
[1:48:33] brother Richley.
[1:48:35] You will renew his strength, take him
[1:48:38] home with a testimony of your grace.
[1:48:41] God, we ask it in your precious name,
[1:48:43] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[2:10:22] Lord Jesus, Father, we thank you for
[2:10:24] your word today, Lord, for
[2:10:27] Lord, being so real. Lord Jesus, we ask
[2:10:30] for a blessed rest of the day. Father,
[2:10:33] we ask that these things that were
[2:10:34] spoken just so true to us, Father. Lord,
[2:10:37] that we realize, Lord, no matter shape,
[2:10:40] what shape we're in, Lord, we are part
[2:10:41] of your masterpiece, Lord.
[2:10:44] just keep chipping away at us, Lord.
[2:10:48] I love you so much. Just pray your
[2:10:50] blessings on us, Lord, as we head our
[2:10:52] way, Father. Safe journeys for everybody
[2:10:54] that needs to tread off home, Father,
[2:10:56] and your blessings upon us. In Jesus
[2:10:58] name we pray. Amen.
