[27:44] I'm kind of sorry that we have to meet
[27:46] in church, but I think we're just a
[27:48] little too many for for our house, but
[27:50] we uh we're going to pretend it's we're
[27:53] in a house environment. We just going to
[27:56] relax and just have a interactive time.
[27:59] Just a lovely time of fellowship. So,
[28:01] I'd like to welcome you and welcome our
[28:03] visitors all the way from the Manawatu.
[28:06] God bless you from uh Mongani. really
[28:08] just appreciate you making the effort of
[28:10] come. Um so I don't want to take any
[28:13] time but I need to introduce brother
[28:15] Joel. Um most of you have never seen
[28:17] him. I only met him in person two days
[28:21] ago but we've uh we've had wonderful
[28:23] fellowship so far and just really
[28:25] looking forward to what the Lord has for
[28:27] us tonight. I have been let into the
[28:29] secret of what my brother's going to be
[28:31] speaking of tonight and I believe it's
[28:33] very relevant and I'm very excited about
[28:35] it and uh you know we get what we what
[28:39] we expect. So if you if you come
[28:41] expecting tonight I believe God will
[28:43] meet that expectation.
[28:45] So let's just pray one more time. And
[28:48] maybe maybe you feel I'm I'm tired. I've
[28:52] had a long day. I've had a long week.
[28:53] Someone irritated me today at work, at
[28:55] school, whatever it is. Um, but let's
[28:58] just ask the Lord to get that stuff out
[29:00] of the way and give us that expectation
[29:02] in our hearts.
[29:06] Most wonderful father,
[29:08] oh God, we there's indeed none like you,
[29:11] Father. We worship you. We love you and
[29:15] appreciate you, Lord. But not as some
[29:19] distant God that we serve out of fear,
[29:22] Lord, but
[29:24] that that
[29:26] friend that
[29:28] that that friend that is closer than a
[29:30] brother, Lord. That's what we relate to
[29:33] you as, Father. And we are so thankful
[29:35] for that.
[29:37] And tonight, we just want to call you on
[29:39] the scene again. I pray, Father, that
[29:41] you will forgive all our weaknesses and
[29:43] shortcomings.
[29:45] Lord Jesus, I want to lift each of us up
[29:49] before you tonight. Lord, I pray that if
[29:51] there's any hindrances, every
[29:52] distractions, any mind battles, Lord,
[29:55] anything that's in the way of
[29:57] distracting us tonight, Lord, I pray
[29:58] that your Holy Spirit, Father, will
[30:00] capture our hearts. Help us to surrender
[30:02] our hearts to you completely, Father.
[30:05] Lord, I pray that you will grant us
[30:08] grace, Lord, to come with expecting
[30:10] hearts tonight. Lord Jesus, we just
[30:13] commit this time to you. I pray for
[30:14] brother Joel too. Lord, I lift him
[30:16] before you and pray that you will just
[30:18] use him for your glory. Father, Lord
[30:21] Jesus, we just commit every part of the
[30:22] service to you. I also want to pray for
[30:25] any requests among us tonight, Lord.
[30:27] Maybe there's some unspoken requests. Oh
[30:30] God, I'm going to also speak my request.
[30:32] Lord, I really need your touch for my
[30:33] health, Lord. Pray that you will come on
[30:36] the scene, Father. Oh Lord Jesus, we
[30:38] thank these things in the precious name
[30:40] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[30:44] Amen. So, I'm going to hand over to
[30:45] brother Joel, but let's just sing one
[30:48] more song before we before we do that.
[30:53] Um, maybe I'm not going to be able to
[30:55] type quick enough. Can you do that for
[30:56] me, Joseph? I'm going to let the glory
[30:58] roll.
[31:03] There we go.
[31:07] Thank you very much.
[31:09] I'm going to let the glory roll when the
[31:12] road is cold in glory. Come on, faster.
[31:16] I'm going to get beside myself when I
[31:19] get beside the king. That day I'm going
[31:24] to have the time of my life. When the
[31:26] time of my life is over,
[31:30] I'm going to get carried away. when I
[31:33] get carried away.
[31:37] Well, I don't know why I become a little
[31:40] shy when I get around a hell lot of
[31:43] people. And I can't figure out why I
[31:46] never can shout about the love that
[31:49] floods my soul.
[31:51] I must confess I can't express the
[31:55] feelings deep inside me. The things I
[31:59] know and cannot show. One day we'll
[32:02] overflow.
[32:05] I'm going to get the glory roll when the
[32:08] roll is called in glory.
[32:11] I'm going to get beside myself when I
[32:14] get beside the king that day. I'm going
[32:19] to
[32:23] [Applause]
[32:26] [Music]
[32:29] Thank you.
[32:31] [Music]
[32:31] [Applause]
[32:34] Amen. You know,
[32:37] since it started, I knew all the songs
[32:39] and uh he had to keep the song I don't
[32:42] know for when I was coming up front.
[32:46] Amen. God bless you all. You could be
[32:48] seated.
[32:50] It's a pleasure. Thank you musicians.
[32:53] really it's a blessing to see you play
[32:58] and uh yes it's a pleasure for me to be
[33:01] here. This uh I never thought something
[33:05] like that could happen. I hope you can
[33:07] all bear with my French accent.
[33:10] Makes me feel good to see that many
[33:13] people have an English accent down here.
[33:17] So
[33:19] and uh yes. So tonight, since we're not
[33:22] in the living room, I figured we could
[33:26] uh maybe have the teaching side of the
[33:29] service here just a short while and then
[33:34] move across the street uh around snacks
[33:37] and maybe have the interactive part of
[33:39] the meeting where we can, you know, chat
[33:42] on what uh was thought and maybe ask you
[33:46] guys could ask any questions you have on
[33:48] your hearts.
[33:50] around snacks. I think it would be
[33:52] informal and and uh yeah. So anyways,
[33:58] let's just uh read a quick scripture. Um
[34:02] if you have your Bibles, let's turn to 2
[34:05] Corinthians chapter 3.
[34:08] I took the liberty of a PowerPoint since
[34:10] we're in church, so
[34:12] &gt;&gt; you could as well follow on the
[34:13] PowerPoint.
[34:15] And um
[34:18] starting from verse 17
[34:23] we have just uh we've planted a church
[34:27] in a new city in
[34:29] in Canada in Quebec actually. So as much
[34:33] as far as you can go on the other side
[34:35] of the globe is where I come from. And
[34:38] uh we've planted a church a year and a
[34:40] half ago and we have a wonderful youth
[34:44] group of about 15
[34:48] 15 youth. So pretty much the same size I
[34:52] I feel like you guys have here. So feel
[34:54] free. You should come down and visit one
[34:57] time.
[34:59] Canada is a beautiful bigger New
[35:01] Zealand. So
[35:04] yeah. Amen. So let's read. Now the Lord
[35:09] is the spirit and where the spirit of
[35:12] the Lord is there is liberty.
[35:15] Do you feel liberty tonight?
[35:20] &gt;&gt; But we all with unveiled face beholding
[35:22] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are
[35:25] being transformed into the same image
[35:27] from glory to glory just as by the
[35:30] spirit of the Lord. Amen. Let's pray.
[35:36] Father, thank you for this evening and
[35:38] this group of young people you have
[35:40] gathered here tonight to hear about you
[35:43] and to hear from you. And may you be the
[35:47] one who speaks tonight and use these
[35:49] lips of mine to be a blessing, Jesus. We
[35:53] commit this evening into your hands,
[35:56] into your name. Amen.
[35:59] Amen. And so
[36:01] tonight uh I want to speak about a
[36:04] sickness
[36:06] and uh a disease a sickness
[36:09] and this is a sickness that affects uh I
[36:13] uh and we never hear about this sickness
[36:15] you know we hear about cancer
[36:18] and different sicknesses in the body but
[36:21] this sickness affects maybe the most
[36:24] people of all sicknesses
[36:27] and uh I call it the sickness of
[36:30] comparison.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; The sickness of comparison. And uh we're
[36:35] all affected by this sickness of
[36:37] comparison.
[36:39] And it has uh devastating effects on the
[36:43] human beings. And so we just want to
[36:46] look at it from a biblical standpoint
[36:48] tonight just for a few minutes
[36:51] um and see how we do compare ourselves
[36:55] with others and how we do compare others
[36:59] with others and uh what this does uh to
[37:04] us as human beings and how this is
[37:07] contrary to God's plan for our lives and
[37:11] and the human being as always compared
[37:15] itself. It It always did. You know, we
[37:18] go to the Bible and we see Cain
[37:21] comparing his offering with Abel and and
[37:24] getting very mad that Abel's offering is
[37:27] accepted and his isn't.
[37:30] And uh I think about the spies in
[37:32] Jericho, they say um you know, we cannot
[37:36] do it. They're they're giants. The walls
[37:38] are too big. The people are too big. Um,
[37:42] you know, Saul compared himself to
[37:44] Goliath and didn't measure up. You know,
[37:47] he he's too big. Uh, he's too strong.
[37:50] He's a soldier. He's a a fighter. And
[37:53] kings always compared their kingdoms
[37:56] with other kings. Uh
[37:59] even the disciples, you know, Jesus
[38:01] disciples were there in the room with
[38:05] God made flesh uh to have a a supper and
[38:09] they were fighting over who was the
[38:12] greatest
[38:14] &gt;&gt; or who Jesus loved more. And so it's
[38:18] just uh
[38:20] it's just um
[38:23] in us to compare ourselves. But we do
[38:26] compare others as well. Um, we compare
[38:30] others amongst themselves. And I I think
[38:33] about about Samuel going to anoint a
[38:36] king.
[38:37] And he gets there and you know, Jesse
[38:41] just presents to him a whole bunch of
[38:45] his his sons.
[38:47] And uh when Samuel sees, you know, his
[38:51] taller and stronger son, he says,
[38:53] "Surely
[38:55] &gt;&gt; this is him." And and and the only way
[38:58] he can be the taller son is that you
[39:00] compare compare him with a shorter
[39:04] &gt;&gt; son. And so right there, the prophet
[39:07] compares the sons and thinks because
[39:10] this this one is taller and stronger,
[39:13] this surely must be him. And and Samuel
[39:17] is not the only one who compared his
[39:19] sons and to see if they were worthy of
[39:23] being a king. But
[39:26] Jesse compared his son is in a very
[39:29] special way, which is
[39:33] leaving David behind.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; He was not even esteemed worthy of being
[39:38] king. He was too small. He was too weak.
[39:41] And so we can see by this illustration
[39:44] that
[39:46] prophets can compare people, parents can
[39:50] compare people. Nobody is out of the
[39:52] picture when it comes to the sickness of
[39:55] comparison. And you think about the
[39:59] disciples of John the Baptist and and
[40:02] how they come to Jesus and compare
[40:04] themselves with the disciples of Jesus
[40:06] and say why do your disciples and they
[40:10] compare themselves with Jesus disciple
[40:12] &gt;&gt; and and it's just it's rooted in human
[40:16] nature to compare ourselves and to
[40:19] compare others
[40:21] &gt;&gt; and the technology has made it much
[40:23] worse you know I mean Before le let's
[40:28] just go back a hundred years. You could
[40:31] only compare with your neighbors.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And now you can compare with the world.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; So it it's it has just technology has
[40:42] just magnified
[40:44] &gt;&gt; a problem that we already live in or
[40:46] live with. Before you could only compare
[40:49] with what you see.
[40:52] Now you see everything
[40:55] &gt;&gt; or you think you do right because you
[40:58] see in fact only what people want you to
[41:00] see but you feel like you see
[41:02] everything. Before you saw only your
[41:04] neighbor's cars, but now you see as
[41:06] vacation
[41:08] pictures and and you see everything
[41:11] really. And so it keeps you in a
[41:13] constant state of comparison.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; And you compare yourself and and you
[41:19] compare your wealth and you compare your
[41:21] beauty and you compare your life. You
[41:23] compare your car care carrier. You
[41:25] compare everything with everybody.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; People you know, people you don't know.
[41:33] Right? Am I right so far? But this
[41:36] sickness
[41:38] has very bad effects
[41:40] on a human being. In fact, and now these
[41:44] statistics I'm about to talk about are
[41:46] American statistics, but I think human
[41:49] being is human being. So they're fairly
[41:52] fairly good. 54% of young girls
[41:57] recognize that social media is bad for
[42:00] them.
[42:02] So over half of young girls
[42:05] in North America,
[42:08] they recognize that it's bad for them,
[42:10] that it's caused depression
[42:13] on the young girls and it's caused
[42:16] suicide on the young boys.
[42:20] And the reason why I don't know if you
[42:22] ever heard that young boys are more
[42:23] prone to suicide than young girls, but
[42:26] but the reason boys are are more prone
[42:29] to suicide than girls is they don't have
[42:32] the same outlet.
[42:35] A girl can talk it out, right? Uh the
[42:39] boy keep it inside and when he feels
[42:41] like he's lost at the game of life, then
[42:44] there's no there's no point in living
[42:47] anymore. And and so these are just side
[42:51] effects
[42:52] of this sickness we're talking tonight,
[42:54] the sickness of comparison.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; But all the while the Bible says, you
[43:01] know, count your blessings.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Name name them one by one and and even
[43:06] Psalms 126 says, "The Lord has done
[43:09] great things for us and we are glad."
[43:12] But sadly uh not many people can say
[43:17] speak with their heart what is written
[43:20] on the screen.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Many people can speak with their mouth.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; But not many people can speak it from
[43:27] their hearts because that is not how we
[43:29] feel.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; We don't feel like the Lord has done
[43:33] great things for us.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; We feel like the Lord has done great
[43:36] things for my neighbor. Look at this
[43:40] beautiful trip they've taken in that
[43:42] part of the country and look at that
[43:44] beautiful new car. They have a new house
[43:46] or beautiful life they have. Surely God
[43:50] has done great thing for them and not
[43:53] for me. The sickness of comparison.
[43:58] And so
[44:00] when our hearts
[44:04] are lusting because of the sickness of
[44:07] comparison,
[44:09] we cannot thank God for what he's done
[44:11] for us. But instead, we we are we feel
[44:15] sorry for ourselves and we feel let down
[44:17] by God in the depths of our hearts. We
[44:21] feel a let down because we compare
[44:23] ourselves
[44:25] and it places us in in in a state of
[44:28] unsatisfied desires.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; It focuses our attention on what we lack
[44:35] to be happy
[44:38] instead of everything we have and that
[44:41] should make us happy,
[44:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:45] How many of us
[44:49] each week, maybe each day, but at least
[44:51] each week, we focus on what we lack to
[44:56] be happy.
[44:57] Like, if only I could
[45:00] get or do or be
[45:03] &gt;&gt; get this, then I would be happy.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; But but why does that come from? Like
[45:11] where does that lack come from?
[45:15] It comes from the sickness of comparison
[45:18] &gt;&gt; because you know if you haven't seen
[45:20] nobody that has it and looks happier
[45:22] than you on social media or whatever
[45:25] then you don't see the need to have it
[45:28] to be happy. So it focuses this sickness
[45:31] of comparison focuses our attention on
[45:34] what we lack to be happy.
[45:38] And so let's see what that sickness
[45:40] creates. It creates mainly four things.
[45:44] It creates insat insatisfaction
[45:49] about our current life who we are and
[45:52] the life we live. We're we're
[45:54] insatisfied
[45:56] with the current state of our life and
[45:59] it also creates depression
[46:03] &gt;&gt; and we live in a depressed age. I mean
[46:07] these depression pills they sell man
[46:10] it's it's just
[46:13] most sometimes I feel most everybody has
[46:16] depression pills you and why is the
[46:19] world so depressed we haven't like in
[46:21] the history of the world we have never
[46:23] been as comfortable and wealthy and you
[46:27] know three meals a day and beds and
[46:30] amenities and but we've never been so
[46:33] depressed.
[46:34] There has to be a route to this
[46:36] depression
[46:38] and that root I believe is comparison.
[46:42] And then it creates lost, lost of our
[46:46] neighbor, lost of a a different life, a
[46:49] virtual life. And but lastly, it creates
[46:52] uh complexes.
[46:54] And um what is a complex?
[46:58] The dictionary says it's u
[47:01] feeling inferior,
[47:03] feeling of inferiority.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Right. That is what a complex is. So I
[47:09] look at someone playing the piano and I
[47:12] feel inferior. Right. Because I Why do I
[47:16] feel inferior? Because I look at
[47:18] somebody else playing the piano. Right?
[47:21] There's no feeling inferior without
[47:25] comparison.
[47:27] Without comparison, you cannot be
[47:31] inferior.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Without comparison, you cannot be
[47:35] complexed.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; You cannot have a complex. This is
[47:38] impossible. But then we compare
[47:41] ourselves and we feel like our careers,
[47:43] the way we look, what we possess, the
[47:46] success we have, the trips, the
[47:48] marriage, the families, the kids,
[47:50] whatever. Put put whatever you want in
[47:54] that square. We feel inferior to someone
[47:59] somewhere
[48:01] and and and that creates a complex where
[48:05] you know I'm not good.
[48:07] You're not good. Compared to what?
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Compared. Compare.
[48:14] For you to be not good at playing drum,
[48:16] you have to compare yourself with
[48:18] someone. If you don't compare yourself,
[48:21] then I mean you're just as good as you
[48:22] could be right now, right?
[48:25] Now I want you to get this.
[48:28] When you compare yourself,
[48:32] you create within yourself a complex.
[48:37] You do it to yourself.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; When you compare yourself, but when you
[48:42] compare others,
[48:44] you give away complexes.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; You distribute them like gifts.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And we're so prone to compare others.
[48:54] No,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; we do. We always compare others, you
[48:58] know, and and we compare our kids.
[49:01] There's not much parents here, but we
[49:03] compare our kids and we compare our
[49:05] parents, you know.
[49:07] My my friends uh my friend's mom, she's
[49:11] not like you. Yeah. She comparing your
[49:14] mom with your friend's mom. It's just we
[49:17] do it all the time. We compare our kids.
[49:20] We compare our husbands and wives and
[49:22] our parents and our brothers and our
[49:24] sisters and our pastor and we just
[49:26] compare people with other people.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; And that is bad. Very bad.
[49:34] Because these complexes
[49:37] that we put upon ourselves or that we
[49:41] give to others are strongholds
[49:45] &gt;&gt; in our hearts
[49:47] &gt;&gt; that most of the time paralyze us.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Most of the time
[49:52] &gt;&gt; they are open doors for tormenting
[49:54] spirit. No wonder the world is
[49:56] tormented.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; The world is tormented because there is
[50:00] an open door to the heart. There is a
[50:02] stronghold within which the spirit, the
[50:06] evil spirit can can get in your heart
[50:10] and go at work tormenting you from the
[50:13] inside. Not from the outside now, from
[50:16] the inside of your heart, tormenting you
[50:19] with complexes and lust and depression
[50:22] and insatisfaction.
[50:25] This is an evil spirit doing these
[50:26] things.
[50:28] But but it all started when you left
[50:30] that door open through the sickness of
[50:33] comparison.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; And and um and so this sickness of
[50:39] comparison places the person in one of
[50:44] these two situations and most of the
[50:46] time these two situations consecutively
[50:50] like one after the other. The first
[50:53] thing that could happen to you when you
[50:55] have that sickness of comparison upon
[50:57] you is is a state of of lust, a state of
[51:02] of uh performance where you try to be
[51:06] better than your neighbor. Um a state of
[51:10] excess where you want to do, you want to
[51:13] own, you want to to succeed, you just
[51:16] want to be better.
[51:19] and um a thirst for possessions and and
[51:22] trying to be better than your labor and
[51:24] living in excess and living what I call
[51:26] the religion of perfection
[51:31] &gt;&gt; because it is a religion. I don't care
[51:33] if you go to church or not, but
[51:36] perfection is a religion
[51:38] &gt;&gt; and it comes from the sickness of
[51:41] comparison. This need to be perfect or
[51:43] to be better. And so there is that state
[51:47] of mind that comes with it that that
[51:50] keeps you self-centered
[51:53] and pushes you to cultivate an image of
[51:56] perfection.
[51:58] You kind of need to be perfect.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; But that is only one of the two states
[52:04] that sickness can bring you in. And the
[52:06] second state
[52:08] is a state of depression.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; You're in neutral. You you can't even
[52:16] move forward.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; You you're full of complex. You're
[52:21] paralyzed because you are not winning.
[52:24] It seems at the game of life.
[52:27] you're worth less. You're not winning at
[52:29] the game of life. You open your Facebook
[52:31] or your IG or whatever it is and and you
[52:34] look at the pictures and you think to
[52:36] yourself, "What a miserable person am I?
[52:40] I'm not winning at the game of life.
[52:42] Like, I'm going nowhere. I'm nobody."
[52:46] Um, and it then it it paralyzes you and
[52:49] it keeps you in a state of depression
[52:51] and complex like you're worthless,
[52:54] depressed.
[52:57] insufficient or uncapable to win
[53:01] at the game of life. And often these two
[53:04] state
[53:05] they are successive
[53:07] because for a while you're trying to
[53:09] make it right. For a while you're trying
[53:12] to be better than your neighbor. You're
[53:15] trying to be you know more successful
[53:17] and to own more and to travel more and
[53:19] to be more beautiful and whatever that
[53:22] is that you compare yourself. You're
[53:24] trying to be better. You're trying to
[53:27] live that religion of perfection for a
[53:30] while. But when you've been living that
[53:33] religion for a while and it still
[53:35] doesn't satisfy you, then you you often
[53:40] switch to that second mindset, which is
[53:43] being depressed and paralyzed.
[53:46] And some people just do that endless
[53:49] circle of being depressed for a while
[53:53] and then getting back on top trying to
[53:56] be the best and then being paralyzed
[53:59] again and depressed and they just go
[54:01] over and over in that vice circle.
[54:06] And uh this is what the sickness of
[54:09] comparison does to a human being. And
[54:13] that sickness has infected most every
[54:15] human being on planet earth honestly
[54:18] except you live somewhere in the jungle
[54:20] maybe you're and even then you know uh
[54:24] the tribe you I'm sure you compare
[54:27] yourself to the tribe leader and he
[54:30] kills more animals than you do or
[54:31] something. Yeah. It's rooted in our DNA.
[54:35] This sickness of comparison is rooted in
[54:37] our DNA. But I didn't come with bad news
[54:41] tonight. And I came with good news.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And the good news is there is a remedy
[54:46] to this sickness.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; And you see I keep hearing over and over
[54:51] that the world now doesn't want Jesus
[54:55] and the world is atheist and and and and
[54:59] and it's it's like a a paradigm. So in a
[55:05] sense we hear pe the people don't want
[55:08] to hear about Jesus and they've rejected
[55:11] God and stuff and and then the opposite
[55:14] is they they change identities and they
[55:17] tried they try so many things to end up
[55:21] on top and get rid of this depression
[55:24] and this feeling of worthlessness and
[55:26] not being seen that comes with that
[55:30] sickness. And all the while, all the
[55:32] while, there is
[55:35] one remedy
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and that remedy is the word of God.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; It is, it truly is. And so even though
[55:45] the world might not be interested in a
[55:47] religion, you know, they you don't
[55:50] realize how much your friends they think
[55:53] when you say God, they hear religion.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; That's what they hear. You say God, they
[55:59] hear religion, but they don't need
[56:02] religion. I agree with them. I hate
[56:03] religion.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; But they need a relationship with their
[56:07] maker.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; That's what cures
[56:10] this sickness.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; The only thing that does, in fact,
[56:16] the only thing that does cure that
[56:18] sickness is to know where I come from,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; who I am, and whom I want to be pleasing
[56:26] to. Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. The cure to that
[56:32] sickness is to know where I come from,
[56:37] &gt;&gt; who I am, and whom I want to be pleasing
[56:40] to.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; There is the cure to that sickness.
[56:45] And uh let's read Psalms 139.
[56:50] David speaks. He says, "For you formed
[56:54] me. You formed my inward parts.
[56:59] You covered me in my mother's wombs. I
[57:02] will praise you for I am fearfully and
[57:05] wonderfully made.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And and let me just stop and ask you
[57:11] this question tonight as uh as it is
[57:14] very laid-back and I don't want an
[57:16] actual answer out loud, but uh I feel
[57:19] like I know the answer anyways. But when
[57:21] is the last time have you praised God
[57:25] for having made you, you know, for
[57:28] having been made fearfully and
[57:30] wonderfully made? When is it when is the
[57:33] last time you woke up and you you looked
[57:37] at yourself in the mirror and you said,
[57:39] "I praise you, oh God,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; for I am fearfully
[57:45] and wonderfully made." When is it?
[57:50] All right, let's continue. Marvelous are
[57:52] your works,
[57:54] and that my soul knows very well. My
[57:58] frame was not hidden from you when I was
[58:00] made in secret, and skillfully wrought
[58:03] in the lowest part of the earth. Your
[58:06] eyes saw my substance, yet being
[58:08] unformed, and in your book they were all
[58:11] written, the days fashioned for me,
[58:14] when as yet there were none of them.
[58:19] Now, reading this verse, we could think
[58:22] like the person writing this must be,
[58:27] you know, the perfect person. Like if if
[58:31] David, we know David is a man, right?
[58:34] The person writing this must be so
[58:37] handsome. Like he must be tall and
[58:40] strong and handsome and just the days of
[58:43] his life must be perfect like a bed of
[58:46] roses, right? Because look at the
[58:49] praises he gives to his maker for how he
[58:54] is fearfully and wonderfully made. But
[58:58] the fact is that the guy that wrote
[59:01] these words is the guy
[59:04] that even his father
[59:07] has put aside. He wasn't even he wasn't
[59:11] even considered you know he wasn't even
[59:14] big enough or intelligent enough or
[59:16] strong enough for his father to put him
[59:20] in front of the prophet.
[59:24] He didn't even bother calling him
[59:26] &gt;&gt; like because for sure this little guy
[59:29] won't make it. You know, this is the guy
[59:33] who writes this David the small, David
[59:36] the feeble,
[59:38] &gt;&gt; David the shepherd, David the least of
[59:42] his family.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; But but David didn't compare himself.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; David didn't.
[59:51] Saul did,
[59:53] Samuel did, his father did, David
[59:57] didn't, he didn't, but we'll get back to
[1:00:00] this later. Um,
[1:00:02] so let's go back to the verse we started
[1:00:06] with. This is an amazing verse because
[1:00:10] Paul says, "Where the spirit of the Lord
[1:00:14] is, there is liberty, but we all with
[1:00:17] unveiled face beholding as in the mirror
[1:00:20] the glory of the Lord."
[1:00:23] Now, I think we can all picture the
[1:00:26] glory of God, can we?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, we sing about God. We worship
[1:00:31] God. We praise God. God is mighty. God
[1:00:34] is glorious. God, you know, deserves all
[1:00:38] honor, worthy worship and praise.
[1:00:41] God, we can behold the glory
[1:00:45] of God. But then
[1:00:48] um Paul goes on to say, we are
[1:00:51] transformed
[1:00:53] into the same image from glory to glory.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; That's beautiful. That hard that one is
[1:01:04] hard to accept.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Can you accept?
[1:01:09] I mean, we've just all said that we can
[1:01:12] behold the glory of God. And you, we all
[1:01:15] agree. But then the next verse says,
[1:01:18] "But you are transformed
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory into the same
[1:01:24] image."
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Can you accept that?
[1:01:28] that you are the glory of God and you
[1:01:30] are being transformed into the image of
[1:01:32] God.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Can you accept it?
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And if you can,
[1:01:40] what good would would it do you to
[1:01:42] compare yourself with your neighbor?
[1:01:44] Right?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; What good would it do yourself to
[1:01:49] compare yourself with anybody on
[1:01:51] Facebook if you are being transformed to
[1:01:54] the glory of God and to the image of
[1:01:56] God?
[1:01:58] And so I would like for you tonight
[1:02:01] maybe to leave with a question,
[1:02:04] something you could ask yourself once in
[1:02:07] a while just to remind yourself of who
[1:02:10] you are. And that question would be,
[1:02:13] what do you see when you look in the
[1:02:16] mirror?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; What do you see when you look in the
[1:02:20] mirror? Because most of us, we look in
[1:02:23] the mirror each and every day. We do. We
[1:02:26] wake up and then we look at ourselves in
[1:02:29] the mirror and most of us we don't like
[1:02:32] what we see,
[1:02:35] right? There's a reason where where this
[1:02:39] the the Bible speaks about a mirror.
[1:02:43] Paul uses the analogy of a mirror and
[1:02:46] how we look at ourselves. And he says,
[1:02:48] "When you look in the mirror, what you
[1:02:52] actually see is the glory of the Lord.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; What do you see
[1:03:05] in the mirror?" But you see to to get
[1:03:09] rid of that sickness of comparison I
[1:03:12] said you you have first you have to know
[1:03:14] where you come from.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Right. And you have to know who you are.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And and now we've read Psalms 139. And
[1:03:24] we know where we come from. We know our
[1:03:26] maker. David says, "You made me
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; and I worship you because when I wasn't
[1:03:33] even there in the depths of the earth,
[1:03:36] you saw me and you knitted me and you
[1:03:39] made me. So now I know where I come from
[1:03:42] and I know my maker and I praise him for
[1:03:45] him for it." And then this verse tells
[1:03:48] me
[1:03:50] who I am or who I am becoming. Now I
[1:03:53] know where I come from and I know who I
[1:03:55] am or who I am becoming because I am
[1:03:57] being transformed into the image of God
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; And so I I only need one last thing to
[1:04:08] to free myself from the sickness of
[1:04:10] comparison. Remember what I asked what I
[1:04:12] told you? I told you where I where I
[1:04:15] come from, who I am, and
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; who I want to please,
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; who do I want to be pleasing to? Because
[1:04:28] if I want to be pleasing to the world,
[1:04:31] if I want to be accepted by my friends
[1:04:35] or by my colleagues, if I want to please
[1:04:37] the world, then I will still have to
[1:04:41] kind of cope with that sickness of
[1:04:43] comparison
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; because I'm trying to fit in. And to fit
[1:04:47] in, you have to compare yourself.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; You have to. So, you're not free yet.
[1:04:54] That's why Galatians chapter 1 says Paul
[1:04:57] says or do I seek to please men for for
[1:05:01] do I now persuade men or God or do I
[1:05:04] seek to please man for if I still
[1:05:08] pleased man I would not be bondervant of
[1:05:12] Christ.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; There's a choice here right? Not
[1:05:18] everything is a choice. Um the first two
[1:05:22] is really being conscious of it. It's
[1:05:26] just being conscious of the maker. You
[1:05:29] cannot choose your maker. It's not a
[1:05:31] choice. You have been fearfully and
[1:05:34] wonderfully made. It's already happened.
[1:05:37] It's now that now is just the time for
[1:05:40] us to be aware of it.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Go back to our roots. realize that we
[1:05:45] have been made by God and and who you
[1:05:49] are is is not really a choice
[1:05:53] because you are being transformed not of
[1:05:56] yourself but you are being transformed
[1:05:58] by God into his image from glory to
[1:06:01] glory. But this third one is really a
[1:06:04] choice is where the choice is set before
[1:06:08] us is who do we want to please?
[1:06:14] Because we cannot please men and free
[1:06:18] ourselves from the sickness of
[1:06:19] comparison.
[1:06:21] Because the world wants us to compare
[1:06:24] ourselves.
[1:06:26] That's how we can please the world is by
[1:06:30] comparing ourselves to the world and
[1:06:33] fitting in.
[1:06:35] But Paul says, "I cannot be a servant of
[1:06:39] God and still want to please men."
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And there's a choice right here. And
[1:06:45] that choice is very important because
[1:06:48] it's a choice that frees you from the
[1:06:50] sickness that kept you bound and
[1:06:52] depressed and paralyzed and empowers you
[1:06:56] to walk by the spirit in the works that
[1:06:59] have been prepared beforehand by Christ
[1:07:02] so that you may walk in them.
[1:07:05] to fulfill God's plan for your life. It
[1:07:07] empowers you to be yourself.
[1:07:10] We call it be yourself, but I would say
[1:07:12] to be what God created you to be.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; It empowers you when you free from that
[1:07:19] sickness.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And the the spiritual men in the Bible
[1:07:23] didn't compare themselves, right? We
[1:07:26] said Cain compared himself to Abel.
[1:07:30] But did Abel compare himself to Cain?
[1:07:32] No, he didn't.
[1:07:34] All he wanted, you see the problem Cain
[1:07:37] had
[1:07:38] is he wanted to make a more beautiful
[1:07:42] sacrifice than Abel.
[1:07:45] Cain was living in comparison
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; and he he couldn't please God. I don't
[1:07:51] care how beautiful his sacrifice was, he
[1:07:54] couldn't please God. But Abel didn't
[1:07:57] want a more beautiful sacrifice. He
[1:07:59] didn't want to compare. He wanted to
[1:08:01] please God. That's what he wanted.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And that is why his sacrifice was
[1:08:07] accepted.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And we've talked about David quite a
[1:08:11] while. But it's Isn't that I mean, David
[1:08:15] should be our example. Really,
[1:08:18] David should be our example. Everybody
[1:08:21] compared David and esteemed him
[1:08:23] unworthy, uncapable, unfit. Yes,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; David never compared himself. David, the
[1:08:31] smallest, the weakest, the least of them
[1:08:33] all, the least.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't compare himself to his
[1:08:37] brothers, not once. He didn't compare
[1:08:40] himself to Saul. He didn't even compare
[1:08:42] himself to Goliath.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Like, he didn't care how tall or big he
[1:08:46] was or strong or whatever. He didn't
[1:08:48] compare himself. No, he knew. He knew
[1:08:51] what? He knew where he came from.
[1:08:55] He knew who he was
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; and he knew who he wanted to please
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; and he just went right there in the
[1:09:03] valley and went straight to Goliath's
[1:09:06] face and killed him. But that would have
[1:09:10] been impossible if he had only compared
[1:09:13] him. I mean, think of think of it. Saul
[1:09:15] putting on him the armor Saul's armor on
[1:09:19] David.
[1:09:20] I mean, I'm sure the helmet went up to
[1:09:23] here. Like,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; you can even see his face with the
[1:09:25] helmet.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; What an opportunity to compare yourself
[1:09:31] trying to put somebody else armor.
[1:09:34] What an opportunity to compare yourself.
[1:09:38] He didn't.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your armor doesn't fit me. I'm
[1:09:42] not trying to fit your army. I'm not
[1:09:44] trying to fit the world. I'm not trying
[1:09:46] to fit my people. I'm trying to please
[1:09:48] God.
[1:09:49] I'm trying to fulfill God's plan for my
[1:09:52] life.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb didn't compare
[1:09:56] themselves. They said, "We are more than
[1:09:59] able.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Not because we are stronger. Not because
[1:10:03] we we are faster or because we are
[1:10:06] taller." No, we are more than able. Why?
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Because we know who we are.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; We know where we come from.
[1:10:16] And we know what we are doing is
[1:10:18] pleasing God because it's fulfilling a
[1:10:20] promise.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't compare himself. He didn't
[1:10:25] compare his disciples either. The
[1:10:28] spiritual men of the B the Bible didn't
[1:10:30] compare themselves. Only the carnal men
[1:10:34] did it. These mens we've just spoke
[1:10:37] about, they knew they came from God.
[1:10:40] They knew they were sons of God. They
[1:10:43] knew they pleased God. They knew God was
[1:10:46] for them.
[1:10:49] They knew God was for them.
[1:10:56] When is the last time you told yourself,
[1:10:59] "God is for me?"
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Honestly, when is it? When is the last
[1:11:07] time you woke up one morning, you know,
[1:11:11] whatever, it's time for exams at school
[1:11:14] or something, and instead of being
[1:11:17] fearful, you look at yourself in the
[1:11:19] mirror and you say, "God is for me."
[1:11:26] When is it? I am fearfully and
[1:11:28] wonderfully made and I praise you, God.
[1:11:31] Yeah,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; I count my blessings.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; God is for me.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; We don't do it.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; We tend to stay on the opposite side of
[1:11:42] the scope, which is I'm not good enough.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not beautiful enough. I'm not rich
[1:11:49] enough. I'm not intelligent enough. I'm
[1:11:51] not strong enough. I'm not. That's where
[1:11:54] we tend to stay.
[1:11:57] And that shows we're still in that
[1:11:58] sickness of comparison.
[1:12:01] But God wants to take us out of that
[1:12:03] sickness and into his will and his plan
[1:12:08] for our lives. And even in church,
[1:12:11] if we don't uh watch,
[1:12:15] we start to compare ourselves in church
[1:12:17] and to compare our church with other
[1:12:19] churches and to compare our music with
[1:12:22] their music and our pastor with their
[1:12:24] pastor and and we compare our between
[1:12:27] ourselves, you know, we just compare
[1:12:29] ourselves in church. Church is a social
[1:12:31] network. Actually,
[1:12:34] we've talked about Facebook as a social
[1:12:36] network, but often church is just like a
[1:12:39] social network.
[1:12:41] These people, we we get close to them
[1:12:44] and and we see pretty much everything in
[1:12:46] their lives and we have a chance to get
[1:12:48] close and to see what's what they live
[1:12:51] and it creates all sorts of complex, you
[1:12:54] know, oh, she can play music good. Oh,
[1:12:57] she's beautiful. She's more beautiful
[1:12:59] than I am. and she's she's more
[1:13:01] intelligent and there's always
[1:13:03] something. And the funny thing is in
[1:13:06] that sickness of comparison, you never
[1:13:08] compare
[1:13:10] the thing you have better than somebody
[1:13:12] else to what they have worse. It's
[1:13:15] there's a funny thing u the guy that is
[1:13:18] taller will compare his muscles, not his
[1:13:21] height.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That the guy that is muscular will
[1:13:25] compare his height, not his muscles.
[1:13:27] It's just we always compare
[1:13:30] where we lose
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; because that is a trick of the enemy
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; to keep us paralyzed because he doesn't
[1:13:38] want us, you know, to to be empowered as
[1:13:41] sons and daughters of God and to just
[1:13:43] advance his kingdom and and and live a
[1:13:46] fulfilled life in Christ.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want to compare myself.
[1:13:54] I don't want to compare myself in a good
[1:13:57] way to feel better than y'all. And I
[1:14:00] don't want to compare myself in a bad
[1:14:02] way to feel bad about myself. I just
[1:14:04] don't want to compare myself. I want to
[1:14:07] please God and do his will.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; That's all I want. I want to be pleasing
[1:14:13] to God and do his will.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] Friends, we need to find our identity
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; In Christ.
[1:14:31] To heal of that sickness, we have to go
[1:14:34] back to our roots,
[1:14:37] our maker,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; where we come from, who we are, and what
[1:14:43] we're here for. And when we preach or
[1:14:48] teach and maybe it's a mix of both and I
[1:14:51] bet um a message like this one we what
[1:14:55] we fear the most I have to be honest
[1:14:57] with you preaching along those lines
[1:15:00] what we fear the most is that the people
[1:15:02] would leave and just resume with their
[1:15:06] lives
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; and and I want everybody to understand
[1:15:11] that there is healing
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; in the word spoken Tonight
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; there is deliverance
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; from the way people look at you. There
[1:15:23] is deliverance from depression.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; There is deliverance from that suicidal
[1:15:28] spirit.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; There is deliverance from the complex
[1:15:32] that that is holding you down. You don't
[1:15:35] have to feel less or inferior.
[1:15:39] Yes,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; you are not inferior nor superior to
[1:15:43] your brothers or your sisters.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You are sons and daughters.
[1:15:50] Jesus said, "No one is great." You know,
[1:15:53] there's no one great.
[1:15:55] We're all equals in the eyes of God. But
[1:15:58] we have to learn to see ourselves
[1:16:01] through the word and through the eyes of
[1:16:04] Christ and not through the eyes of the
[1:16:06] world.
[1:16:09] I hope you realize there is deliverance
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; if we put these words in practice. James
[1:16:16] says, and I finish with this verse.
[1:16:18] James says, "For if anyone is a hearer
[1:16:21] of the word and not a doer, he is like a
[1:16:24] man observing his natural face in a
[1:16:29] a mirror again."
[1:16:33] Yeah.
[1:16:35] for he observes himself, goes away, and
[1:16:39] immediately forgets what kind of man he
[1:16:42] was.
[1:16:45] It just ties back in so perfectly.
[1:16:49] When you look at yourself
[1:16:53] in the mirror,
[1:16:56] what do you see?
[1:17:01] And when you leave the bathroom or your
[1:17:04] room,
[1:17:06] do you forget immediately
[1:17:10] what kind of person you're called to be
[1:17:14] or does this stay with you like
[1:17:16] throughout your day? Can you just stay
[1:17:19] in that spirit of God is for me, I want
[1:17:24] to please God, God is for me, I want to
[1:17:28] please God. that will keep you, guard
[1:17:31] you from falling back in the same trap
[1:17:34] of this spirit of comparison
[1:17:36] and and you will feel, you know,
[1:17:38] fulfilled and you will feel important in
[1:17:42] the eyes of God and you will see God
[1:17:44] moving in your life in a mighty way
[1:17:46] because you will move. You will not be
[1:17:48] paralyzed anymore by your complexes.
[1:17:52] Complexes paralyze people. I assure you
[1:17:56] some very gifted people. The example of
[1:17:59] music is the easy example. But some very
[1:18:01] gifted people cannot serve God with
[1:18:04] their gift because of complex
[1:18:09] because of comparison.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; They are very gifted. But Satan
[1:18:17] was able to
[1:18:20] make them believe that this other person
[1:18:22] is more gifted
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; and it created a complex that put them
[1:18:27] down and paralyzed them
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; and now they cannot fulfill God's plan
[1:18:31] for their lives.
[1:18:34] But you can be free tonight
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; from this sickness. No pills needed, no
[1:18:40] meds needed. Christ
[1:18:43] looking at yourself in the mirror but
[1:18:46] realizing that you are being transformed
[1:18:49] in the image of Christ from glory to
[1:18:52] glory
[1:18:54] never forgive it then never forget it
[1:18:56] rather never forget it
[1:18:59] will change your life
[1:19:02] let's pray thank you Jesus
[1:19:06] for this moment
[1:19:09] you've given us tonight and for this
[1:19:12] crucial topic you've placed on my heart
[1:19:16] for the youth. But
[1:19:18] my only prayer as this meeting comes to
[1:19:21] an end
[1:19:23] is that
[1:19:25] these words will not leave.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; But but we will meditate on these and
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; that we would not be
[1:19:36] people that look in the mirror but
[1:19:40] forget instantly who we are as we move.
[1:19:46] Lord, help us.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Help us to always
[1:19:51] remember to anchor our souls in where we
[1:19:55] come from,
[1:19:57] who we are. We come from you. We are
[1:20:00] your sons and daughters and we have been
[1:20:02] perfectly wonderfully made.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And you are transforming us from glory
[1:20:08] to glory. And Lord, put in us this d
[1:20:11] desire to please you and no one else.
[1:20:14] May this be an anchor, a decision that
[1:20:17] is made tonight,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; an anchor. Lord, we want to please you.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Help us to just remain focused on your
[1:20:28] will and your plan for our lives and and
[1:20:31] just keep our eyes on you,
[1:20:35] the author and finisher of all things.
[1:20:41] I ask it for
[1:20:44] your people here in New Zealand and
[1:20:47] these youths present tonight. May this
[1:20:50] may this meeting and this subject change
[1:20:52] their lives and allow allow them to walk
[1:20:56] in the path and the plans you have for
[1:20:59] their lives. This is my prayer in Jesus
[1:21:03] name.
[1:21:04] Amen. Can we just sing a song?
[1:21:10] Do you know the song? He knows my name.
[1:21:14] I have a maker.
[1:21:34] I have a maker.
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:43] He formed
[1:21:45] my heart.
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:50] Oh, before
[1:21:53] even time began,
[1:21:58] my life was in
[1:22:02] his hand.

[1:22:21] thought.
[1:22:24] He sees
[1:22:26] each
[1:22:28] that falls
[1:22:31] and he hears me where
[1:22:35] I call. I have a father. Think of that
[1:22:38] tonight.
[1:22:40] I have a father
[1:22:45] and he calls me his own.
[1:22:49] He calls me his own. And no matter what
[1:22:54] I do, he will never leave me.
[1:22:57] He'll never
[1:22:59] leave
[1:23:01] me.
[1:23:03] No matter
[1:23:05] where I go, he knows.

[1:23:44] He called my name.
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] He knew me
[1:23:55] in his thoughts.
[1:23:59] He saw me before
[1:24:03] time.
[1:24:05] And I heard him when
[1:24:08] he called.
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:14] He knows my name.
[1:24:20] [Music]

[1:24:26] thought.
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:29] He sees
[1:24:31] each tear that falls
[1:24:35] and he hears me when
[1:24:39] I call.
[1:24:42] Amen. What a powerful powerful service
[1:24:46] tonight. Amen.
[1:24:49] Like our brother said, it's not some
[1:24:51] deep revelation or anything, but this
[1:24:54] can and will change our lives if we
[1:24:56] submit to it. And I and I believe
[1:24:58] there's none of us spared from it.
[1:25:01] Like a brother said, it's natural for us
[1:25:03] to compare ourselves. It's in our DNA,
[1:25:05] in our makeup, to compare ourselves with
[1:25:08] others.
[1:25:09] But if you really look at who you are,
[1:25:12] if you really get the revelation that
[1:25:14] you're a son of God, that you come from
[1:25:17] God, that he put that perfect picture of
[1:25:20] you in his family album before time
[1:25:22] began.
[1:25:24] And when you then say, "I'm not good
[1:25:26] enough," you're telling God he's a liar.
[1:25:29] If you then say, "I will never match
[1:25:31] up," you make God a liar. If you compare
[1:25:34] your life with others, what you're doing
[1:25:36] is you're not looking at the picture of
[1:25:38] you that was in the book of life before
[1:25:39] the foundation of the world.
[1:25:42] And in very simple simple terms,
[1:25:45] whatever the path is that God cut out
[1:25:47] for your life, what you have, what you
[1:25:49] don't have, where you live, what you do,
[1:25:52] you know, what your circumstances are,
[1:25:54] if we can just recognize, in fact, I've
[1:25:57] recently preached about it. That's the
[1:25:58] power of the eagle anointing is to see
[1:26:01] who you are. If you just recognize who I
[1:26:04] am, and I love how a brother brought in
[1:26:07] tonight, if you know who you want to
[1:26:09] please.
[1:26:11] I mean, it's so dumb really. I'll use a
[1:26:13] Michael word. It's so dumb.
[1:26:16] It's so dumb that we that we want to
[1:26:19] impress our colleagues and we want to
[1:26:20] impress people around us because man,
[1:26:23] one of these days we're out of here in a
[1:26:25] rapture and then what what do we get
[1:26:28] from trying to impress our friends or
[1:26:30] our colleagues or whoever it is? It's so
[1:26:32] dumb. But that's just we all do it.
[1:26:34] We're all done, right? Amen. I need to
[1:26:38] find a way to use the suck word also.
[1:26:40] Like
[1:26:41] it sucks like that. be like that.
[1:26:47] Amen. But really, I would I I want to
[1:26:50] beg you to take this to heart tonight.
[1:26:52] And I've I've done the same. I I take it
[1:26:55] to heart tonight. You know, as as a
[1:26:57] minister, you sometimes compare yourself
[1:26:58] to others. You hear other people
[1:27:00] minister and you think, "Man, I wish I
[1:27:02] can do that. I wish I can preach like
[1:27:04] that." You know, it's just how we are.
[1:27:06] And and and we
[1:27:09] we we feel peer pressure and it's so
[1:27:11] dumb.
[1:27:13] you know, we we sit sometimes I sit with
[1:27:15] a bunch of other ministers and then I
[1:27:17] think, man, I don't even belong here.
[1:27:19] You know, these guys are so far ahead of
[1:27:21] me and it's so stupid because then it
[1:27:24] makes me ineffective.
[1:27:26] But if I can just find what God made me
[1:27:27] and use me for, then I can just relax in
[1:27:31] him and just say, I'm going to please my
[1:27:33] father and no matter who criticizes what
[1:27:36] or who's got whatever opinion, it
[1:27:38] doesn't matter.
[1:27:40] Amen. So, I encourage you as we go
[1:27:43] across the road to uh to fellowship and
[1:27:46] have a few snacks and stuff that you ask
[1:27:48] brother Joel a few questions and um
[1:27:51] let's let's go and fellowship a little
[1:27:52] bit. So, I'll I'll hand over to you
[1:27:54] Arnote and then you can sing a few songs
[1:27:57] and then come. We're going to go across
[1:27:59] Joseph will you lock up when we when you
[1:28:01] come. All right. Well, we'll see you all
[1:28:03] there God willing and thanks for coming
[1:28:04] again.
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:10] They just stand on our feet.
[1:28:14] Sing that chorus one more time. He knows
[1:28:16] my name.
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:20] Oh,
[1:28:23] he knows my name.
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:31] He knows my every
[1:28:35] thought.
[1:28:39] He sees each tear that falls
[1:28:45] and he hears me when I call. Amen. Such
[1:28:51] a powerful fall. So simple but so
[1:28:53] powerful. We appreciate that. Thank you,
[1:28:55] brother Joel. Let's sing this. Uh God's
[1:28:59] got to prove we're one in a million.
[1:29:03] Eagles call weird.
[1:29:06] It's a faith to rise into.
[1:29:10] It's a way that God can show the world
[1:29:13] that Jesus Christ is true. Oh, it's a
[1:29:17] life to live a testimony
[1:29:21] blameless.
[1:29:23] Living for Christ
[1:29:26] standing every day.
[1:29:30] Oh, God's got to prove
[1:29:34] we're one in a million.
[1:29:38] He's got to show
[1:29:40] power of the blood.
[1:29:44] Oh, his love is pride is not the same.
[1:29:51] And he's going to show that we're a
[1:29:53] people that this world isn't worthy of
[1:29:58] represent
[1:30:00] representative
[1:30:01] of Christ
[1:30:03] in the field you've been playing.
[1:30:07] [Music]

[1:30:16] following
[1:30:20] touch with the sunrise
[1:30:24] in this day.
[1:30:27] Oh, God's going to prove
[1:30:31] we're one in a million.
[1:30:35] He's going to show
[1:30:37] the power of the blood.
[1:30:42] Oh, his pro is brightest from Saint
[1:30:48] and he's going to show that we're a
[1:30:50] people that this world is worthy of
[1:30:55] by his grace. By his grace we are going
[1:30:58] to stand. We keep our
[1:31:04] in the midst of belieing.
[1:31:07] We keep looking to the unseen.
[1:31:11] Really know that we will overcome
[1:31:17] and receive his promise
[1:31:20] to sit on his throne.
[1:31:24] God's got a pro.
[1:31:27] We want a million.
[1:31:31] He's going to show
[1:31:34] the power of the
[1:31:39] pro
[1:31:41] is not from
[1:31:43] us. And he's going to show that we're a
[1:31:47] people that this world is worthy of.
[1:31:52] Oh, God's going to prove
[1:31:56] we want a million.
[1:32:00] He's going to show
[1:32:02] our
[1:32:07] life
[1:32:09] is not the same as he and he's going to
[1:32:13] show that we're a people that this world
[1:32:17] is worthy of.
[1:32:20] Amen.
[1:32:23] We'll sing God is good all the time. We
[1:32:24] won't do the bridge. We'll just uh I'll
[1:32:26] go easy on you guys.

[1:35:32] you to close in prayer for us if that's
[1:35:34] all right? If you could pray for the
[1:35:36] food as well, we would appreciate that.
[1:35:38] Thank you. Let's bow our heads. Thank
[1:35:42] you, Lord, so much for the word you've
[1:35:44] blessed us with tonight, Lord Jesus. I
[1:35:46] thank you for bringing Brother Joel
[1:35:47] safely all this way over from Canada,
[1:35:50] Lord. And I thank you for the word that
[1:35:52] you've blessed us with, Lord Jesus. I
[1:35:54] pray that it might speak to the people
[1:35:55] here tonight, Lord, because it affects
[1:35:58] so many of us, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:00] I pray that you might continue to reveal
[1:36:02] yourself to us, Lord Jesus, and what you
[1:36:04] have for us, Lord. May we, each of us,
[1:36:07] Lord God, try to be the best version of
[1:36:09] ourselves that you want us to be, Lord,
[1:36:11] and not to be some twisted version of
[1:36:13] what we see in someone else, Lord. We
[1:36:16] are each so unique and so individual.
[1:36:18] And God has made us for a special and
[1:36:20] specific purpose. And may you just
[1:36:22] continue to lead and guide us towards
[1:36:24] that purpose. I pray in the most
[1:36:26] precious and holy name. Lord God, may
[1:36:27] you bless the food and the fellowship
[1:36:29] later on, Lord God, in thy most precious
[1:36:31] and holy name. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[1:36:34] bro. Thank you everyone. God bless you
[1:36:37] all. Hope you have a wonderful evening
[1:36:38] and sure everyone knows we've only got a
[1:36:41] few visitors, but just straight across
[1:36:42] the road by the Alres house and we'll
[1:36:44] meet together again for a few snacks and
[1:36:46] some fun and fellowship. Bless you guys.
