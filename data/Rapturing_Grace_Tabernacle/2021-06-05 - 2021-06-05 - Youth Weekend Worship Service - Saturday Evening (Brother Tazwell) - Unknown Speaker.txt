to have you here and there's just a wonderful atmosphere i know some of you are tired i know some of you didn't sleep lots last night and you had a fairly busy day but i trust that you enjoyed the day and that you have been blessed and remember our scripture behold our good and our pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together and that's what we're doing we thank god for this opportunity and it's it's lovely to uh to have everyone here it's wonderful to have so many good sing voices tonight man we're going to have church but so tonight we just just to make sure that everyone is exactly on the same page so what we're going to have tonight is brother tazil is going to bring us a message and i've asked him to uh to keep it to a maximum of 20 minutes but don't time him on your watches now see how much you can suck out of him in that 20 minutes right okay so we suck him dry by the time he's done right but i'm just a real privilege to have you and uh so so just one or two logistical things that i don't want to bother you with afterwards um so firstly tomorrow morning we'll see you again here at church at 10 o'clock it church starts at 10 so doors open at 9 30 so ideally we'll be here at 9 30. if you want a seat you'll be here at 9 30 because we probably have more people than we have capacity for so we'll we'll be nice and cozy tomorrow in church we'll we'll see how many people we can squeeze in but um you're just looking forward to that remember your photo competition i trust that you've had some photos and groups will probably need to have a chat to decide what photos they're going to submit before 10 o'clock tomorrow morning um so probably a good idea to to consider doing that quickly afterwards then i also want to say um after we've had this time so so we're gonna let me ask this how many of you have song items that you would like to render over the weekend come on there we go we got one praise the lord we've got two we've got three i'm sure there's a lot more than

scriptures uh james chapter 4 verse 8 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you verse 7 says submit yourself therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you then one scripture first john chapter two it's just a couple of pages over first john chapter 2 and we'll just read verse 14 i've written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i've written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one father your word has been read it's all in your hands father in jesus name amen you may be seated tonight in the presence of god it's just so wonderful to be here and you know as i was spending the day today with all of you beautiful people i just there was just a love that just projected as i seen and i watched and i was so so proud brother of what i've seen viswathele of what i've seen you know just happening over today in fact i was so proud in the car today as you were i i hiked the lift with them with kim them and i told him i said you know what i'm so proud of you young people to know that you know that you love the lord and that you're standing for him and that you know there's there's so many other things out there but the fact that you guys are here tonight it's just so wonderful so i just got a quick thought you know and um i want i want to try to start it off with a with a story if it's okay um i think i've got now 19 minutes with a story um now in the story um i want to talk about a burger now i don't know is there is the i don't know i don't know this area right but can you give me a nice what is there what's a nice burger that that someone or one of us that we all like to eat i mean not mcds and stuff like that but this is nice come quickly just quickly anybody bacon vegan vegan penny okay okay vegan penny vegan petty vegan fairy and wait wait where would you go buy a vegan penny leonard where would you come by which planet where would you go buy a vegan patty count a countdown okay i was expecting something else but okay let's go let's go there so mike loves vegan patties right so mike and leonard they're going to countdown and mike's focus is i want a vegan patty that's what i want it's like he's salivating already and here they start they they come they come it's not usually don't let you stairs and mike and here tas and mike we come to countdown and all mike thinks is vegan paddy vegan patty i want the vegan party and we come to countdown and we find that there's a long line of people standing waiting to buy a vegan patty vegan patty a vegan patty and as we're standing in there we're standing in the line and tesla is standing next to mike and and after a while mike is just passing i can't wait to call way back on wait vegan patty vegan patty but after a while tess is standing there and taz is starting to get very agitated because this likes vegan patty as well but you know it's not really his style but anyway mike is focused mike wants the vegan patty and after a while tess says you know mike you know i can't handle this anymore there's too much people we're going to wait too long and you know what i'm just going to give up i don't i don't want this but mike says stairs stay with me man you're going to enjoy it you know when we get it i don't know how this thing looks there's when we get that man you're gonna you're gonna want to come back again but dez is just standing there after a while test is mike you know what i i can't i can't wait in this line it's too long look it's going all the way around then no no i'm not interested like i'm on the go and then tess goes and tears loses out on the vegan patty and mike goes and mike gets his vegan patty because he stands in line and i was i was i was thinking about the story you know and i realize that there's sometimes people that we we there is something that's available to us something that we desire and uh many times if if you're not if you're not focused on on that on what you want and and and you see all the you know the circumstances that comes your way there are people that will focus on the vegan patty that's what i want but then there are people that will focus they want the vegan petty but then they focus on all the other stuff and you know and then and that's all they see they don't see the vegan mic seasons and that's where he's going he doesn't care how long he's gonna wait but he wants to get there but then there are others that just stands you know and they you know it's uh it's going to take too long and then they give up and then mike because his perseverance he pushes ahead he wants it he gets it at the end but then tez loses out you know and i was i was actually thinking of that and i was looking at at the way the world is going and i was looking at the the culture of the world and there's this you know this is this concept you guys might know more about this is what i do but there's you know the you you cancel culture you hear about all the different kind of cultures and um when i look at it from my perspective and i and i look at it through the word of god i look at it and i see you know what these cultures and things that's happening today in the world it's actually it's trying to produce a bunch of weak people i remember i think it was 10 years ago i preached a sermon in the church called the power of desensitization and i was saying how you know the way things are working out in our i was talking about television sitcoms at the time and i was saying how it made the man of the house seem like a weakling and i was looking at the world today and i i find out that that is what the world and what the devil wants to do to everybody just make people a bunch of weaklings now i don't know brother brother um uh joseph i gave a quotation i don't know if you have it but i'm uh if you could get that code ready if you don't have it i will i will just read it but i want you know i as as i was looking at the young people today and and my heart just just went out to each one because i realized that all hell is against you all hell is against you the devil is not your friend he is your enemy he crazy he pretends to be your friend the song says he pretends to be so kind but his aim is to destroy you so his whole objective is he wants to have a bunch of weak people he wants to have a bunch of weak young people but that quote can you see it can you see that quote brother branham comes he says this is what god wants he says we're not building an organization i'm not here this morning to build an organization christ never sent me to bolt organization christened me to build individuals and i'm looking at the individuals here tonight to build individuals to the statue of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse and the abiding place of the spirit by his word that is what god wants that's not what the devil wants the devil wants to make you weak he wants you just to give in when that little thing come i think last time i was here i spoke about temptations and when when that little temptation comes then you you the devil tries to he uses his tricks he makes you so weak that when the thing comes you just struggle you you just give in but it's so important that you and i grow and you know as i talk to us your young people right i speak to myself as well whatever i say to you comes back to me now who knows and i'm assuming many of us reads the bible and reads the messages what does brother branham say in simple words what do you need to do to be a strong christian a strong believer anybody can anybody tell me what does brother branham say yes make read your bible and pray every day simple abcs simple things right but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not going to ask you to raise your hands right but i want you to raise your hearts if you do how many of us can say that monday last week tuesday wednesday thursday friday straight saturday it's saturday so it's monday tuesday i read my bible every day and i prayed you you can answer that to yourself right how many of us can say that now if there are some of us that can say yes i read my bible every day and i prayed i'm sure that you will see and you have seen the results in your life because you would have seen the devil will come and try to do things and try to do tell you things and try to pull you this way but because you just follow that simple abc read your bible every day and pray and it it it pulls you up it makes you it it makes you what is what the brandon says a powerhouse and then and and the more you do that as simple as it is the more you do it the more when the temptation and the situation and the trial come you will be able to say no maybe right now you can't say no and i know what it's like right i'm a young person and it's not only at the young people it's me also i've got to tell the devil every day no so i've got to read my bible every day i've got to pray i've got to feed on the word of god and you know when i read this this this this uh this quote i like to make it very personal so i put that actually individuals in square brackets and i put they in square brackets because when i read that quote i read it as christ sent me brother branham to build tesla to the statue of jesus christ you see where the branham says the more you receive the word the more you become the word you can go and go into the message app and just type that you will find what the branham says the more you receive the word that's why it is so important young people we've got to receive the word when we sit in church like this and the minister ministers he's not just saying stuff i believe he's speaking as god he's directing him and he is god saying sith i need you to hear this because seth next week you're going to face something and this is going to help you so and i read it christ sent me to build tesla to the statue of jesus christ that dez will might be the powerhouse and the abiding place of the spirit by his word young people the word of god is so precious but it's also so important when you leave here this weekend and whatever was going to happen i want you you know i want you just to remember by the time i said that the word of god it's an extremely important part and it must be an important part of my daily diet i need to eat the right things you know those guys that goes and pumps iron if they go and they pump and they pump and they want to make them big muscles it's good if they go in they're going pump and do whatever they do but if they just feed on chocolates and sweets and ice creams and all the bad stuff they actually going against what their objective is but if they go in and they go and they you know do the stuff and they feed on the word of god it will strengthen you it will help you and i i the lord laid on my heart to tell the young people that you are precious to tell you that you are not some down trodden something that you just a young person just coming to church and sitting in church and just you know doing what all young people do but that you guys and sisters you are special there's something great with inside of you and you know what maybe you sit here tonight and you don't know that but that is why the devil fights you and i can tell you as i look at all of you including me none of you can say the devil is not fighting me because if you say the devils are fighting you that means maybe he's got you where he wants you because this is a it's a fight it's a battle we've got to take the sword of the world and fight and fight and fight and fight because that is what you are that's what we are we are warriors brother andy what he is in the army of god and no devil is going doesn't matter how young you think you are no devil is gonna keep you down because you know what while we are fighting right so i'm fighting the devil and i'm fighting this my back might be exposed but mike is standing behind me he's standing back to back and as i'm fighting mike is fighting as well so we fighting we're feeding brother branu says word fed and spirit-led and at the same time while we are being word-fed and we are spirit-led and we are growing we also helping our other young people because you know what you young people know more about each other than what some of us older people do so sometimes some of you guys know hey you know that young brother tez he's actually really he's struggling a bit you guys know you guys know who's going through stuff and it's not your job to go now and tell someone else about it gossip in this but it's your job as a real son of god daughter of god to take them to the lord to encourage them help each other you know what we did when i was in london we we we were dealing with them and i finished off with this finish off the two things when we were dealing with young people we found that some of our smaller ones were really struggling so what we did was we we spoke to the more older and more established and more mature young people and we told them you know what come come up with friends with these young ones just get to know them a bit and as they got to know them they started realizing the struggles that they were facing and that these these older ones could help help that obviously you can't force someone to grow but they could help because they they were closer to them so they knew how to help and that is what they did and today back home in the london church there's a beautiful powerful group of young people that really loves the lord and you know what i know as i look at you and then i look at you know even us older folk you know the the the is tremendous pleasure facing many of us a lot of times you know it's like you've got the pleasure to perform and you know pleasure to be a good message brother or pleasure to be a good message sister and when i sit in church i need to be able to you know sit in such a way and that when people look at me they say man that's a wonderful message young person i was one of those right that used to come into church and i used to sit and i was very pious and i was really you know praised the lord and i you know did all those sort of things but i was doing my bad stuff in the back and i i used to think i fooled a lot of the the older people but obviously i know now in hindsight i know i didn't because a lot of those older people they had discernment but they all said wisdom so sometimes they would come to me and say hey father tears how are you god bless you man how are you and as you'd say how about the god is good but then the brother said but i didn't ask you god i know god is good i want to know how you brother tess you know and and and and then those because they could see that where the tears was you know they didn't come and bash me but they they used wisdom and they helped me and that is why i am the crazy brother tears that you see here because i love jesus and i love him so much [Applause] that i wish you know i sometimes wish i could just take him and just force him inside every one of you but i do realize you know we've got to have our own personal experience with god so i just want to close up with this you know and i was talking about pressures of life and we we get faced with so much pressure and i was thinking of brother branham and i remember how many how many have heard from the brandon's life story i think most of us should have known would know his life story how he was you know carrying the water and he came to the tree and he heard the whirlwind and he heard the voice say don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way and how brother branham tells you says he was nine years he says he was about nine or 10 years old and he was with his dad and and with his dad's friend and i'll finish off here with his dad and his dad's friend and and he says you know the dad's friend drank some whiskey and they passed on to the next person and took some whiskey and they passed it to brother branham but the branham said no i don't drink thank you and then they said what you were brand new and you don't drink something crazy there and so you know what brother brandon's daddy said he said yes he's a his own dad called him a and brother branham says you know it's probably probably i mean he was human right it affected him so much he said just give me that bottle or whatever it was and i'm gonna drink it he was under so much pressure and you know many times if we get faced with so much pressure friends looking at us and laughing and sniggering because we different if the plane said give it to me and he says as he was going to take it we know what happened right he heard that and then he dropped it and he ran and he says as he ran he heard laughing but you know what god was protecting him and that same god is protecting you and me i want to read this actually and then we'll then we'll then we'll go right we'll go we go read this and then what the brandon talks about he says he says um let me just find it yeah he says here he was about 17 18 years old and then he says he he met this um you know you had this this girlfriend i get this girlfriend and he says you know he says how pretty she was she had eyes like a dove he said she had teeth like pearl and and this was his girlfriend was talking about it and a neck like a swan you know when he says i just love them the prettiest thing you've ever seen and he talks about this girlfriend that he had and then he says how one day you know they they went out and then he had to go to turn some bottles and he came back and he says as he came back he seen his beautiful girlfriend sitting in the car then smoking a cigarette and he said oh that just broke him and then this was she was there and the friends were there and then they said she said billy you wanna take a puff and he said no ma'am i don't smoke you had to take a stand right and then she says well i don't smoke at that other day and she made fun of him and probably the other buddies made fun of him and then the priesthood probably hit brother brandon and he said just give me that cigarette and he took the cigarette and i think i think he put it to his mouth and he was gonna light it and he says as i was gonna do that he heard that it was god coming and he says i dropped it on the ground and i cried and i ran and he says if you read it some of them they were following him and they were laughing at him but you see god was protecting that gift and i thank god today that brother branham he he became a success to them but look at what because of brother branham you and i can say that god is building us into a powerhouse so when stuff come your way and when pleasure comes your way listen god has got great things in store for each one of you no exception you might think you're insignificant you might think you this and you're nothing and you're not popular and maybe i can't sing i'll go i'll end up with this ayada uh freddie knows him there was a brother in our church back in south africa his name was brother selwyn and brother selwyn he came from a gangster background in fact his head was skewed because he was hit in the gang fight and his head was skewed and the lord changed his life and the lord just gave him the desire to sin and then saul wouldn't come almost every sunday friday you would come and you would want to sing for jesus and then you take that mic i found his brother brother glenn would play the piano and someone would start singing but man that brother sang false false false i think i mentioned it here when i was here last time to the small group he's saying false false false that even the musician struggled to follow him and then when he was finished he walked off and he was so happy and so proud he from his ears he was singing like an angel and then every time you put a salad and you know what after a while some of us would sit in the seat and we would laugh because when we hear freddy's the song lead sometimes and further said but the show was going to come and sing and then some of us would certainly yourself was going to see he got sick but he had that desire and you know one day i look closer for this one day there was a sister in the church with andy that had suffered with a blood disease and this sister was in church and she had the proof that she had this blood disease and god laden by the servant's heart to come and sing a song about the blood of jesus and brother salvin came up and he started singing as false as ever musicians couldn't follow him but he started singing for jesus and as he started singing the atmosphere in the building started changing and then that sister under that atmosphere felt something is happening to me and then something told that sister come up to the front and she came up to the front the poster laid hands on her prayed for her a couple of weeks later the sister came back with a report to say that the blood disease was gone gone gone gone because a young brother he's a deacon today a young brother said you know what i'm not going to bow to pleasure this word is too precious and too powerful i have to stand and even if i sing false and by the sound if you're hearing this god bless you we love you even if i'm singing false i'm singing this for jesus and we've seen the results that it produced so in closing the world is trying to produce a bunch of weaklings but each one of you from marian right through you are going to prove to everyone and to the devil that you are not going to be part of that statistics of weaklings there's going to be some they say the definition of a weakling is somebody that just bows to pleasure not able to come against the flow of things with the grace of god and i want to encourage you if you forget everything else read your bible read the word of god listen to brothers listen to tapes and if you're struggling now i guarantee you there will still be struggles but god will give you the grace to stand as a son and as a daughter of god let's just pray lord jesus i probably went over my time and but lord god i want to just say thank you just for allowing this few words to be spoken lord i i just want to pray lord this young group of young people are so they're so beautiful lord they're so precious and lord god we will not lose one of them doesn't matter what comes their way lord god you're going to hold them but i pray that you help each one lord lord if they're not doing it just read the bible every day and pray and grow because that is what you require of us you want us to grow but we've got to also let god desire you so the obstacles as i was talking about that that that burger thing lord we we're not going to look at the obstacle towards it but we're looking at our goal which is jesus christ and lord the obstacles we're just going to push it aside and we're going to press forward because lord is a catching away there's adoption there's perfection lord god and we all thank you that we are part of it jesus name bless every young person here in jesus name amen god bless you we love we might you know we might not always say it but you know we love you and as i get i'm getting to know a lot of you lately i can see you know people like samuel and and and ben you know god bless you god bless you just keep on loving jesus christ and just keep on serving him and if you struggle and if you feel that you can't do what you you know go speak to the ministry you know by the way that's the reason he's even arranged these things you know because at the end of the day we want to help you as you know the previous helped us and at the end of the day it's all god that's helping us god richly bless

just stuck in my heart and uh the words of the chorus go it says that it's not in trying but in trusting it's not in writing but in resting it's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord and you know as as a christian brother branham said um our faith is based upon rest and um i just want to say this one thing that was that um that really um stands out to me is that if you don't have a desire for god just pray and ask god for desire and he will grant unto you um thought your desires of your heart and um yeah i'll just sing a song excuse me just be with me if you know the song you uh more than welcome to sing with me he is able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today [Music] he is able [Music] more than able to handle anything that comes my way

desires that you um that you seek for in your life just pray you know just stop trying my trust guiding praying then you'll find your wrists amen are we on yeah um i want to sing a song but i'm not

through the savings of god i will sing salvation song jesus christ [Music] oh [Music] testimony as a young kid um my dad always hated me losing his sockets and his spanish and on a drive i lost two sockets and i sort of just i just brushed it off i was like i'll just find them it'll be fine you always find your tools you know you just leave them out sometimes they turn up i've been like two weeks and i'm just like okay i'm just gonna have to humble myself and pray and then like ten minutes later i just there's this voice it's just like look there and i was like weird climbed up there looked up there's my 24 more hardened soccer side man that was so fast and i was like i was like what about the other one god and so taught me now i've been like two weeks later and i was like that's so weird and then i was just cleaning up and i just like had this funny feeling i should look behind this massive square rock bolt washer i did my other socket was in i was just like i was so happy with that praise god like i found it it was like it's not until you surrender and ask god to help that he actually will like if you just go along and think i can do it well it probably won't happen so good for you eh just just gotta surrender and ask god because he will help you and he's he's always hearing what your prayers are so just ask and he'll give you what you want [Applause] is there anyone else that had a yes getting all um so i'm not very good at standing up in front of people um i have a short testimony [Music] about let me think about this not this friday the previous friday i was um at work and where i work at work in a service center so you see a lot of different people but not a really a lot of different um i was in the smoker room getting coffee ready for the guys in the workshop and one of the truck drivers was waiting for his truck to be finished being fixed and i've seen him before and i know he's a christian and we've talked about it a couple of times when i've had to drop him off and things and this day he asked me you know what church do i go to and i said oh no rapture and grace tabernacle in stratford and then he started asking me these questions and i was just like i don't i don't like where this is going and i'm not a very open person i won't generally talk about the message or what i believe unless someone actually asks i'm just having grown up that way having it kind of forced down my throat and but making that decision for myself and just knowing how some people can find it i don't talk about unless someone asks and and i don't have a good way of explaining things to people so yes just not a good mix and um so this guy kept asking me and he said so why rapturing we're wrapped in grace and i was just like it's just the name of our building it's you know we believe in the rapture and i was just kind of like you know i'm i have to get back to work you know i don't actually have time to stand and talk and um so we're talking and talking and he asked me okay well what do you believe and i was like okay so you know so kind of trying to explain unless you know believe in the bible believe the whole bible we're bible believers and he said okay so what doctrine is like you know it's we believe in the bible you know it's there's no we don't you know yeah i don't have to explain it to you guys but uh and he always seems like so you read the bible i'm like yes i do and he says okay and he goes off on this tangent he says you know because the bible it's logical and i was like and i was like wait a minute that doesn't make any sense to me and he just like kept going on this way and and i said you know um well we believe you know we were seen a prophet an entire prophet so he kind of zeroes in on that and he just like goes off on this and so i say oh you know it's um we believe this man william branham you know he brought us his word and i could see on his face he knew exactly who i was talking about and i was just like oh no and he starts going off and i'm like okay and i was completely blindsided and i just like and he was going off and he's saying all these different things and and he's like saying how i don't even know how to explain it but everything he was saying i was like but that that doesn't make sense you know and he just keeps saying logic and all these different things and i was just like at one point because he started talking about brother brandon i was like i don't like what you're saying and i just said straight to him look i think we should just agree to disagree and he just kind of smiled and said he said okay i said yep right i have to go back to work so i live and i'm just like i'm actually angry and i'm just like it takes a lot to get me angry but i was so angry and i said slow because one of the things he said to me was i think you should rethink your belief what you believe i and i just like oh don't tell me what to believe you don't know me and i was just like i was so angry and then so i was just like thinking about this and i'm trying to work and i've got a lot on my plate at work and i'm trying to work and i'm not the whole time i'm just sitting i'm just like sitting in this like hi terry he's like and then he talks talk starts talking about brother branham and i'm like no and then all of a sudden i said well hang on one thing first the bible's not logic it's faith so i was like so i was sitting there at work having this little testimony there's a little revival and and then he was he was saying how um something about prophets and how it's like into the bible you know it's he went on a whole lot of different things and i just thought well hang on malachi 4 5 and 6. revelations 10 11 i was like thank you lord and then um bro andy was here last sunday and he was preaching and i was actually not being sick the weekend so i just streamed the service and everything he was saying is like thank you lord thank you lord that was for me thank you lord thank you and i was like exactly that's it and he mentioned being blindsided like yup that's yup so it was just it was like it was an amazing time was horrible at the same time but it was amazing and so yeah so i just want to praise the lord for just bring that little little bit to me but yes you know trees don't grow strong by sitting with no wind yeah we've got to live through those storms praise the lord is there anyone else that would like to share and we might just sing maybe one or two songs and then yep 405 psalms 34 magnify the lord i sought the lord and he answered me and

we want to believe with all your heart that there's a seed of god in our hearts that there's a predestinated part of god in our hearts that's our desire that's our vision that we will be able to from those 10 000 years and that will just be a very quick start amen praise god i wonder if you can just take your seats for a moment just really appreciated your attitudes today i really appreciated your

though a couple of things when we finish now i'm going to ask that you just take all your bibles and things and just take them into the foyer or somewhere else and if the young brothers can just quickly help us to get the pews ready for church tomorrow then we don't have to to sort that out before church tomorrow morning that's the one thing the other thing is did everyone get a welcome pack
