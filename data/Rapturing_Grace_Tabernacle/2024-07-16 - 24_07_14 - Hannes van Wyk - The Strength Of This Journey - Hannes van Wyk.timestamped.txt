[1:09:52] want to mention a couple of things he he
[1:09:54] preached on the power of
[1:09:57] decision and he made a statement that
[1:09:59] that I never heard in that way but it's
[1:10:01] so true he said when you need to make a
[1:10:04] choice you have complete free moral
[1:10:07] agency right so you can choose
[1:10:09] freely but once you've made the choice
[1:10:13] you surrender that that control so
[1:10:17] that's really good once you've made a
[1:10:18] choice then the consequences of that
[1:10:21] choice and the after effects and how it
[1:10:23] affects other people and the responses
[1:10:25] and the long-term impact of that you
[1:10:27] can't control that anymore now you've
[1:10:28] made the choice and and that's so so so
[1:10:32] important that we recognize the
[1:10:34] importance of choices um also um he made
[1:10:37] the statement then and it sounds
[1:10:39] contradictory but it's not says when you
[1:10:41] recognize that you've made the wrong
[1:10:43] choices don't be prideful and bold and
[1:10:46] just keep on Motoring in the same way
[1:10:49] amen be humble enough to recognize
[1:10:51] that's a wrong choice and say that was a
[1:10:53] wrong choice and ask God to forgive you
[1:10:56] and then make a right choice and go in a
[1:10:58] different direction you know you might
[1:10:59] still have some of those consequences
[1:11:02] but then at least from that point
[1:11:03] onwards go in the right direction
[1:11:04] otherwise you just keep on you know like
[1:11:07] a bul a china shop just go in the One
[1:11:09] Direction so really good really uh
[1:11:12] really appreciated that and I'm looking
[1:11:14] forward to What the Lord Has for us
[1:11:16] through our brother this morning and I
[1:11:18] trust that we come with expecting hearts
[1:11:21] and with their with their cups held out
[1:11:23] to receive from the Lord
[1:11:25] um I just just to kind of keep you in
[1:11:28] the loop um this is this is not
[1:11:31] something that that I'm really uh
[1:11:34] excited or interested in but um I shared
[1:11:37] a month or two ago I I just felt in my
[1:11:40] heart um brother shabaz from Pakistan
[1:11:42] asked me to to take a service for them
[1:11:45] and he again couple days ago asked me if
[1:11:47] I would do a youth service so this
[1:11:49] morning at 3:00 a.m. um I preached the
[1:11:51] youth service had to W out to the office
[1:11:54] in the ice cold weather
[1:11:56] which which was a bit of a sacrifice but
[1:12:00] we had a wonderful time in the Lord and
[1:12:01] just just really appreciate the the Lord
[1:12:03] coming on the scene but you know I I
[1:12:06] don't know for me there's there's few
[1:12:07] things as wonderful as when you're
[1:12:09] preaching something and the Lord
[1:12:10] actually reveals it you while you're
[1:12:12] while you're preaching it and I I think
[1:12:13] I enjoyed it more than them so it was it
[1:12:16] was pretty good it was definitely worth
[1:12:17] it um just just real
[1:12:21] special um we have a few prayer requests
[1:12:24] that I just want to share and then we'll

[1:12:38] and tired of it um and ask that we that

[1:15:46] amen amen so as brother Hannas comes
[1:15:49] let's let sing Reach Out And Touch the
[1:15:53] Lord re
[1:15:56] CH and touch the
[1:16:00] Lord as he
[1:16:03] passes
[1:16:05] by you will find he's not too
[1:16:11] busy to hear your hearts cry
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:30] to and touch the
[1:16:34] Lord as he
[1:16:37] passes
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:41] by
[1:16:43] amen I trust that's our desire this
[1:16:45] morning that we can reach out and touch
[1:16:47] the Lord as he passes by because we know
[1:16:51] certainly that God is more than able to
[1:16:53] help us to bless us and to give us the
[1:16:56] grace that we need every day of our
[1:16:58] lives and just to know that we live by
[1:17:01] his will by his desire we are here this
[1:17:04] morning because he has called us to
[1:17:07] gather under that mighty name we have
[1:17:09] sung the most beautiful songs of Zion
[1:17:12] and create the right
[1:17:14] atmosphere therefore we come now with
[1:17:16] our cups lifted up say Lord fill me this

[1:17:23] need and just the guide guidance answer
[1:17:26] my questions heal my sick body and uh
[1:17:29] give me direction in life that's the
[1:17:31] purpose and I believe God is the same
[1:17:34] yesterday today and forever and
[1:17:36] certainly we trust that the Lord knows
[1:17:38] our hearts and he understands what we
[1:17:41] need because he's a discerner of the
[1:17:43] thoughts and intents of the heart that's
[1:17:47] why we don't depend upon man we don't
[1:17:49] trust man's ability because man has
[1:17:52] proven to us time and time again again
[1:17:55] that uh we are failures but we look to
[1:17:58] the Lord Jesus Christ to say through our
[1:18:00] weaknesses he can become strong through
[1:18:03] our failings you know he can raise us up
[1:18:06] and make us stronger and give us the
[1:18:08] grace that we need this morning and uh
[1:18:11] that is our desire and that is why we
[1:18:13] come this morning as I greet you in the

[1:18:21] be with you all and wonderful to be back

[1:18:37] that the meeting this morning will not
[1:18:38] be in vain it has never been in vain you
[1:18:43] know the Lord has never failed us and uh
[1:18:45] we trust that he will add some value to
[1:18:48] our lives we give us um a Clarity of
[1:18:51] where we come from where are we going
[1:18:54] and um just be gracious to us this

[1:19:23] beautiful we really enjoyed it it's good
[1:19:26] to come into the house of the Lord uh to
[1:19:29] sing these kind of songs with from our
[1:19:31] hearts because it means something and
[1:19:34] it's not just words but there's an
[1:19:36] expression an expression of Love by
[1:19:39] God's grace amen thank you to the
[1:19:42] Musicians let us turn in our Bibles to
[1:19:45] Job chapter 7 from verse
[1:19:48] 17 job 7 from: 17 to
[1:19:52] 18 my title this morning I would love to
[1:19:55] call it the strength for this journey
[1:19:57] strength for this journey we are really
[1:20:00] on a journey a journey of life and life
[1:20:04] has got um you know things happen in
[1:20:07] life and the journey means that we are
[1:20:10] moving from one point to another
[1:20:12] point and as we journey you know there's
[1:20:15] not a stagnant position things change
[1:20:19] things go different
[1:20:20] directions um when you start this
[1:20:23] journey you know you maybe have got a an
[1:20:25] idea where you're going to end up and
[1:20:26] how life is going to treat you but after
[1:20:29] years and years you start to realize you
[1:20:30] know what you could have never planned
[1:20:32] it you could have never directed it the
[1:20:34] way that God planned it and we trust uh
[1:20:38] that we can depend and trust the Lord
[1:20:40] when he says the footsteps of the
[1:20:42] righteous are for ordained and that God
[1:20:44] leads us in very specific directions Job
[1:20:47] chapter 7 from verse
[1:20:52] 17 amen job 7 from: 17 what is
[1:20:58] man that thou should us Magnify
[1:21:01] Him and that thou should us set thine
[1:21:03] heart upon
[1:21:05] Him Verse 18 and that thou should us
[1:21:08] visit him every morning and try him
[1:21:11] every moment what a good
[1:21:14] question who am I Lord that you think
[1:21:18] about me that you should magnify me uh
[1:21:23] that you know you set your heart upon me
[1:21:26] that you should visit me every
[1:21:27] morning and try him every moment amen
[1:21:31] let's bow our heads again father as we
[1:21:34] bow this morning in your wonderful
[1:21:36] presence we are so blessed oh God to
[1:21:38] come and to call upon thy mighty name
[1:21:41] and to know Lord Jesus where two or
[1:21:43] three are gathered they will be in our
[1:21:44] midst We Trust and Believe oh Father God
[1:21:47] that you can take these words that you
[1:21:50] will Quicken it oh Father God and break
[1:21:52] the bread of life to everyone that's
[1:21:54] present here
[1:21:55] even those that are listening on the
[1:21:56] live stream oh Father God may you reach
[1:21:58] out to them as well and bless them oh
[1:22:01] Father God with their portion we commit
[1:22:04] the meeting to thee father I pray that
[1:22:06] every word that will be said will be
[1:22:07] seasoned with thy love and grace that
[1:22:10] thy holy spirit will take control of
[1:22:12] everyone present here that you will move
[1:22:14] from person to person oh God and that
[1:22:17] you will oh God set the captive free and
[1:22:19] let us be at Liberty this morning to
[1:22:21] worship you in spirit and in truth oh
[1:22:23] Father we commit ourselves to thee oh
[1:22:25] Father God praying thy blessing upon the
[1:22:27] service upon the words upon Thy Word in
[1:22:30] Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen
[1:22:35] you may take your seats this
[1:22:39] morning amen certainly wonderful to be
[1:22:42] back in um Stratford again you know the
[1:22:45] place never ceased to amaze me last time
[1:22:48] I was here it was snow it was wind it
[1:22:49] was rain this time I was prepared for
[1:22:52] that and there was no snow no wind no
[1:22:54] rain so we are ready for whatever it
[1:22:58] brings but it's wonderful and we are
[1:23:01] thankful for the grace that God gives us
[1:23:03] and that he helps us in this way job
[1:23:06] chap 10:2 as well Job chapter 10 vers2
[1:23:11] the word says thou has granted me life
[1:23:13] and favor and thy visitation has
[1:23:15] preserved my spirit so once we start to
[1:23:20] understand that we need strength to
[1:23:21] carry on in this journey we are in a
[1:23:23] journey when you came and the Lord
[1:23:26] called you your journey started and you
[1:23:29] your your life got a new Direction you
[1:23:31] know and things started to change around
[1:23:33] you and and um there there is really no
[1:23:35] control that you had once you gave your
[1:23:37] life to Jesus Christ he took it and he
[1:23:39] started to direct the conditions and
[1:23:42] circumstances around your life and in
[1:23:44] this journey many times you'll come to a
[1:23:46] point where you need where you need what
[1:23:49] we would call a strengthening a
[1:23:52] visitation God would not just call you
[1:23:55] and then leave you one side and say okay
[1:23:56] let's see who's the strongest who can
[1:23:58] make it let me see how much you can
[1:24:00] endure let me see that's not God's
[1:24:02] purpose God's purpose always was that in
[1:24:04] this journey at certain points and times
[1:24:07] in your life he will come with
[1:24:09] visitations and that visitation as job
[1:24:11] says here you know it it preserves my
[1:24:14] spirit because God wants to preserve you
[1:24:17] which means he wants to protect you
[1:24:18] which means he wants you to last this
[1:24:20] whole journey that his purpose is not to
[1:24:22] destroy you halfway because if you are
[1:24:25] called by God and your name has been
[1:24:27] placed in the Lamb's Book of Life God is
[1:24:29] obligated and he will look after you he
[1:24:31] will take care of you doesn't matter
[1:24:33] what life brings your way God Will Make
[1:24:36] A Way of Escape for you so the purpose
[1:24:38] of God's uh strength visitation he says
[1:24:41] thy visitation has revived my spirit so
[1:24:45] it is to preserve it is to revive it is
[1:24:47] to restore it is is to activate me into
[1:24:51] my position because as we sit here this
[1:24:53] morning every one of us has got a
[1:24:55] position in the body of Christ you have
[1:24:57] got a a a you've got a part to play you
[1:25:00] know there's really no Spectators in the
[1:25:02] plan of God yeah you are sitting in the
[1:25:05] Pew and I'm preaching but we all
[1:25:06] partaking we've all got some role to
[1:25:09] play you know at some point this morning
[1:25:11] it was my lot by the predestinated mind
[1:25:14] of God to come and stand here this
[1:25:16] morning before you and his play this
[1:25:18] thought on my heart and your your you've
[1:25:21] also got a part to play because the real
[1:25:23] coming to together is that God can
[1:25:25] impart and activate you that you find
[1:25:28] your place your position and that you
[1:25:30] can understand that Lord Jesus I am not
[1:25:32] just I'm not just a spectator I'm really
[1:25:36] a participant in the plan and program of
[1:25:38] the Living God I can be a singer I can
[1:25:41] be a musician I can be a lay member it
[1:25:43] doesn't matter but there is a purpose
[1:25:45] for me to be here and I'm proud and
[1:25:48] honored to be called to sit in the PE
[1:25:50] and say Amen Lord I believe it and I
[1:25:53] thank you for your word so it's why we
[1:25:55] come to church it is a there's a reason
[1:25:59] behind it we don't come to church
[1:26:01] because you know it becomes a tradition
[1:26:03] or you know somebody said I must do it
[1:26:05] or I'm forced to do it but we we come to
[1:26:08] church to be seated together in Heavenly
[1:26:11] places we come together to look at one
[1:26:13] another and understand where we come
[1:26:15] from because God has called everyone as
[1:26:18] an individual and he calls us different
[1:26:20] one from the other one you know we might
[1:26:23] even look at the word from different
[1:26:25] ways but we're looking at the same word
[1:26:27] and therefore we believe as the prophet
[1:26:29] says when God poured out the Holy Spirit
[1:26:31] he gave each one of us a
[1:26:34] portion you don't have the
[1:26:38] fullness amen so what does it mean the
[1:26:42] prophet says you can he gave us each one
[1:26:46] a portion he says that's why when we
[1:26:48] come together on a Sunday morning I
[1:26:50] bring my
[1:26:51] portion but I'm not complete
[1:26:55] but as soon as I look at my brother my
[1:26:57] sister here I see another portion and
[1:27:00] now my little portion has now growing in
[1:27:03] stature and in magnitude and in strength
[1:27:05] and it becomes a stronger portion and
[1:27:08] that's why I need you to be here so that
[1:27:10] we together can worship God he says that
[1:27:13] brings the supernatural presence of God
[1:27:16] back in the church again when we come on
[1:27:18] a Sunday morning and you bring your
[1:27:19] little leak of fire and I bring mine he
[1:27:21] says the Supernatural is present every
[1:27:23] me eating you might not see it but when
[1:27:26] I see you I see the supernatural
[1:27:29] presence and then we know all things
[1:27:31] become possible because you are here if
[1:27:34] you are not here we cannot do anything
[1:27:37] but with your presence here bringing the
[1:27:39] leak of fire that's why we don't look at
[1:27:41] one another's
[1:27:43] flesh I'm not interested in your flesh
[1:27:47] you know some of us got big
[1:27:50] beards some of us got no
[1:27:52] beards some got this some has got that
[1:27:55] some are white some are black some are
[1:27:57] purple you know we are different but we
[1:28:00] look beyond that and what we see behind
[1:28:02] that there there's a little leak of fire
[1:28:04] and when I see that it excites me to
[1:28:06] know Lord I have arrived and I'm sitting
[1:28:08] in Heavenly places father I don't care
[1:28:11] how they think or what they do if I see
[1:28:14] the pillar of fire I am happy I'm in
[1:28:16] Heavenly places but many times we come
[1:28:19] and we want everybody to look the same
[1:28:25] yes if I've got a certain style or
[1:28:28] something like that I want everybody to
[1:28:29] follow my style then we are happy then
[1:28:31] we are then we in Heavenly places are we
[1:28:33] United that's not God's uniting power
[1:28:35] God's uniting power is the Holy Ghost
[1:28:37] inside of you so the church you know I
[1:28:39] believe a mature Church look beyond that
[1:28:42] outer shell that badges skins you know
[1:28:45] which is nothing to be desired but what
[1:28:47] we desire is the holy ghost in your life
[1:28:49] because when we see that we are excited
[1:28:51] and we're happy to worship God together
[1:28:54] and that's the True Church of the Living
[1:28:56] God now remember for God's visitations
[1:28:59] and God coming on the scene there's
[1:29:00] always a time element to it God doesn't
[1:29:03] do anything
[1:29:04] haphazardly nothing everything God does
[1:29:07] has got a time element you know there
[1:29:10] there's a purpose behind it and that
[1:29:12] time element comes forward we've got a
[1:29:15] natural time and we've got a god time a
[1:29:17] Kronos time and a chyos time so a Kronos
[1:29:21] time is we have to be at 9:00 we have to
[1:29:23] do things at 10: we have to be at work
[1:29:25] Monday morning 7:00 but a kyos Time mean
[1:29:28] a Due Time a fixed time a season an
[1:29:31] opportune time is God's time so God has
[1:29:34] got a certain time and we've got a
[1:29:36] certain time element and they are
[1:29:38] completely
[1:29:39] different God has got a time for you to
[1:29:42] be born again that's God's time that's
[1:29:44] an opportune time that's his time is's
[1:29:46] God you know we can say man it must
[1:29:49] happen at that age or it must happen at
[1:29:51] that age that's got nothing to do with
[1:29:52] it it's God says that's the time I've
[1:29:55] got for you it is the time that you will
[1:29:57] be born again and nothing can move you
[1:29:59] before that time amen you can talk until
[1:30:02] you blew but until God's chyos time
[1:30:05] comes on the scene then that seeds get
[1:30:08] activated and there is a purpose in life
[1:30:11] and you can just find it because God has
[1:30:13] got a Time Jeremiah 2911 says for I know
[1:30:17] the thoughts that I think towards you
[1:30:19] say of the Lord thoughts of peace and
[1:30:20] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:30:24] a chyos Time an appointed time God's
[1:30:28] thoughts to you is a certain thought to
[1:30:29] bring you to an expected end God's God's
[1:30:33] not the author of confusion because the
[1:30:35] footsteps of the righteous are for end
[1:30:37] of the Lord now if we let's take an
[1:30:39] example let's go to acts
[1:30:42] 12:1 and we want to see you know God has
[1:30:45] got a way to do things and and many
[1:30:47] times we get
[1:30:48] confused because we're trying to
[1:30:50] understand God from our mind you can
[1:30:53] never understand God and the purpose of
[1:30:55] God and how God does things from here
[1:30:58] and and and and we need to move from
[1:31:00] here to Revelation to trust the Lord
[1:31:02] explicitly with every fiber of your body
[1:31:05] as the church move towards the Rapture
[1:31:07] we're going to need to trust him 100%
[1:31:10] not from our mind because you will see
[1:31:12] things which will not make
[1:31:14] sense you will see things like that
[1:31:17] let's take an example acts 12:1 now
[1:31:19] about that time Herod the king stretched
[1:31:21] forth his hands to Vex certain of the
[1:31:24] church now the church starts they are
[1:31:27] powerful they are so happy you know when
[1:31:29] God starts a new move everybody is
[1:31:31] excited everybody's happy it is so
[1:31:34] wonderful you know and here Herod looks
[1:31:37] at it and he started to stretch forth
[1:31:40] his hand to Vex certain of the
[1:31:43] church verse two and he killed James the
[1:31:45] brother of John with the
[1:31:47] sword so here is the first sort of
[1:31:50] casualty of a believer that an
[1:31:53] unbeliever could reach out take a sword
[1:31:55] and he slays
[1:31:57] him finish gone dead verse three and
[1:32:01] because he saw it pleased the Jews he
[1:32:03] proceeded further to take Peter also so
[1:32:06] what do we see here he was a man
[1:32:09] pleaser when he did the First Act he was
[1:32:11] inspired to kill him and now he says the
[1:32:14] church now
[1:32:16] rejoices and when when the church when
[1:32:19] he sees that the church really likes it
[1:32:21] now he also says okay let's take the
[1:32:22] next one let's take pet
[1:32:25] because he wants to please the crowd and
[1:32:28] remember we as children of God we are
[1:32:29] not crowd Pleasers we're not here to
[1:32:32] please the crowd we are not that That's
[1:32:34] what Satan wants to do because he wants
[1:32:36] to please the crowd because when you
[1:32:38] please the flesh you will have a
[1:32:41] magnitude of people around it amen
[1:32:44] because he saw it pleased the Jews he
[1:32:46] proceed further to take Peter also then
[1:32:48] were the days of the unleavened bread
[1:32:50] when he had apprehended him he put him
[1:32:52] in prison and delivered him to to four
[1:32:54] quadr of soldiers to keep him intending
[1:32:57] off the Easter to bring him forth to the
[1:32:59] people Peter therefore was kept in
[1:33:01] prison but prayer was made without
[1:33:03] seizing of the church unto God for him
[1:33:06] all right so here the scenario is
[1:33:09] clear the first one is killed James is
[1:33:14] killed now Peter is locked up but
[1:33:15] because it was Easter he says I can't
[1:33:18] kill a brother on Easter I'll kill him
[1:33:20] after Easter you know many times we
[1:33:22] think like that you know I come to
[1:33:24] church I'll just put my weapons away but
[1:33:26] Monday I'll take them up
[1:33:28] again well the war will rage again while
[1:33:30] we come to church God bless you brother
[1:33:32] God bless you Sister how are you this
[1:33:33] morning you know but Monday morning it's
[1:33:35] full on war again it's the same attitude
[1:33:38] we just put the weapons away that we
[1:33:40] should never be like that you should
[1:33:42] always be the mature Christian to say
[1:33:44] Lord let me be the one that breaks the
[1:33:47] cycle let me be the least I will do it
[1:33:51] oh Father God it doesn't matter who does
[1:33:53] it but now he's locked up he's in the
[1:33:54] church but now the church start to pray
[1:33:57] amen they without ceasing verse 6 and
[1:33:59] when Herod would have brought him forth
[1:34:01] the same night Peter was sleeping
[1:34:03] Between Two Soldiers bound with two
[1:34:06] chains and the keepers before the door
[1:34:08] kept the
[1:34:09] prison now notice he was
[1:34:12] sleeping can you imagine being locked up
[1:34:14] in prison between 16 gods in the middle
[1:34:18] of the prison chains and you
[1:34:21] sleeping I mean I would say you should
[1:34:23] be be
[1:34:24] praying but he knew the church was
[1:34:27] praying so if the church is praying I'm
[1:34:29] not going to pray because I know their
[1:34:31] prayer will sustain me there is people
[1:34:33] that will carry me when I'm weak when
[1:34:35] I'm low when I'm in that position that's
[1:34:38] how we want the Church of the Living God
[1:34:40] that when I'm in trouble you know I will
[1:34:42] know there's people that will back me
[1:34:44] right till the end they will pray for me
[1:34:46] that I can sleep in my
[1:34:48] troubles he was
[1:34:50] sleeping and behold the angel of the
[1:34:52] Lord came upon him and and a light
[1:34:54] shined in the prison and he smot Peter
[1:34:56] on the
[1:34:57] sight Peter was in such a deep sleep
[1:35:00] when that angel came as a light he had
[1:35:02] to kick
[1:35:04] him yes that's the kind of sleep that
[1:35:06] the believer should
[1:35:08] sleep because you not alone you've got a
[1:35:10] family you're not alone you are part of
[1:35:13] the many membered body of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:15] Christ you can never fight this battle
[1:35:17] alone you can never have Victory alone
[1:35:19] you need me I need
[1:35:22] you and the angels smoted Peter on the
[1:35:26] side and he raised up saying arise up
[1:35:28] quickly and his change fell over from
[1:35:31] his hands and the angel said unto him G
[1:35:34] thyself and bind on thy sandals and so
[1:35:37] he did so look at the angel the angel
[1:35:40] was in no
[1:35:42] hurry you know if you were in the prison
[1:35:44] there and you would see an angel wake
[1:35:46] you up and the change starting to fall I
[1:35:48] know what I would do I would run for
[1:35:51] That Door full speed but the angel said
[1:35:54] to Peter slow down we I know how we you
[1:35:57] know I'm in control of the situation
[1:36:00] that's why the prophet says if you know
[1:36:02] God is on the scene slow down take a
[1:36:04] deep breath and say Lord Jesus let me
[1:36:07] follow the footsteps of God let me not
[1:36:09] oh Father God get excited but let me
[1:36:12] look at it Lord and let me just take a
[1:36:13] deep breath and follow father God
[1:36:16] slowly because nothing is going to
[1:36:18] happen my running is not going to
[1:36:20] change he said to him you're not leaving
[1:36:23] any anything behind your sandals put it
[1:36:25] on and he waited your garments put it
[1:36:29] on and he waited until the man was fully
[1:36:32] dressed and so and he said follow me
[1:36:34] they were not running they were walking
[1:36:37] and as he walked the Bible says and the
[1:36:38] angel said unto him G thyself bind on
[1:36:40] thy sandals and so he did and he said
[1:36:43] unto them cast thy garment about thee
[1:36:45] and follow
[1:36:46] me don't take it in your hand dress
[1:36:48] yourself fully we've got time I'm in
[1:36:52] control yeah I am God sent I am here and
[1:36:55] I'm going to deliver you that's what I
[1:36:58] want to say to you if you trust the Lord
[1:37:00] and you've got a problem look at him and
[1:37:01] say Lord God I believe that you're going
[1:37:04] to do the perfect the impossible for
[1:37:08] me and he went out and followed him and
[1:37:10] wished not that it was true it was done
[1:37:12] by the angel but he thought he saw a
[1:37:15] vision I mean even maybe thinking I'm
[1:37:18] Dreaming is this really true but it was
[1:37:21] not a dream it was not a vision it was
[1:37:24] real it was true and it was real to him
[1:37:27] and when they were past the first and
[1:37:28] second ward they came unto the Iron Gate
[1:37:30] that leadth unto the city which opened
[1:37:32] to them of its own accord they went out
[1:37:35] and passed on through one street and
[1:37:36] forth with and the angel departed from
[1:37:39] him just
[1:37:41] disappeared now the question I want to
[1:37:44] ask you is why was James killed and
[1:37:48] Peter
[1:37:50] saved part of the same church
[1:37:53] part of the
[1:37:54] elect part of the called out because I
[1:37:58] man it was always James Peter and John
[1:38:01] they were the sort of the main main
[1:38:03] members of the church if you wanted
[1:38:06] somebody done if you wanted prayer
[1:38:07] that's the man you go to when Jesus went
[1:38:10] in and he needed to raise a de or pray
[1:38:12] for somebody that was severe he took
[1:38:14] Peter James and John with him faith hope
[1:38:16] and love with him so how would God allow
[1:38:19] the one just to be slain like like like
[1:38:21] like it's nothing Bible just say Herod
[1:38:23] took the sword and he killed him God
[1:38:25] doesn't even write anything further God
[1:38:28] doesn't even give us the full story God
[1:38:30] doesn't you know tell us how this mighty
[1:38:33] man that followed him so truthfully how
[1:38:35] he died and how he believed God just put
[1:38:38] it plain and simple but with Peter he
[1:38:42] saves him and he tells us how and he
[1:38:45] brings him out how is that possible
[1:38:48] because God decided I'm going to use
[1:38:50] James as a Martin and I'm going to save
[1:38:52] Peter because Peter still got work to do
[1:38:55] and that was God's decision and that's
[1:38:57] the way he does things and that's why
[1:38:59] it's it's dangerous when we start to
[1:39:02] compare
[1:39:04] amen you human reason would ask why
[1:39:08] would such preferences be given to Peter
[1:39:11] and when we bring it to the church why
[1:39:13] would God give that brother such a
[1:39:15] blessing and me
[1:39:17] not why would my why would I suffer and
[1:39:20] the other one you know just money is
[1:39:22] just thrown at him
[1:39:24] he doesn't know where to put the bags
[1:39:25] you know the cupboards are full the car
[1:39:27] is full the bank is overload every
[1:39:29] everywhere he turns there money but me I
[1:39:32] must beg for every sin why we are in the
[1:39:35] same church we believe the same God we
[1:39:37] follow the same message you know
[1:39:38] everything is the same why would God
[1:39:40] prefer one above the other God does not
[1:39:44] prefer one above the other God see us
[1:39:46] all the same we are all United we're all
[1:39:48] the same in front of God but God has got
[1:39:50] a purpose and a reason for our lives and
[1:39:52] we should learn to trust him to say Lord
[1:39:55] God whatever you give me father I'm
[1:39:57] happy with that that's why human
[1:39:59] reasoning is put aside because Faith
[1:40:02] rest on the wisdom and love that God
[1:40:04] loves me that's where Faith rests God
[1:40:08] loves me because all things work
[1:40:10] together for good to them that love the
[1:40:11] Lord who are called according to his
[1:40:14] purpose so it's very strange now acts
[1:40:18] 7:54 so we've spoken now about men that
[1:40:21] were disciples called the Inner Circle
[1:40:24] the chosen ones and in Acts 7:54 he
[1:40:28] speaks about a
[1:40:29] deacon so he gives more uh explanation
[1:40:33] God about a deacon than about than about
[1:40:36] James when he heard these things they
[1:40:38] were cut to their heart and they nashed
[1:40:39] him on their teeth but he being filled
[1:40:42] of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly
[1:40:44] unto heaven and saw the glory of God and
[1:40:46] Jesus standing on the right hand of God
[1:40:49] Steven and he said behold I see the
[1:40:51] heavens open and the son of man standing
[1:40:53] on the right hand of God then they cried
[1:40:55] out with a loud voice and stopped their
[1:40:57] ears and run upon him with one Accord
[1:41:00] and cast him out of the city and stoned
[1:41:02] him and the witnesses laid down their
[1:41:04] clothes at a young man's feet whose name
[1:41:05] was
[1:41:06] Saul amen the mind of
[1:41:09] God now here's a
[1:41:11] deacon and God has chosen him to do
[1:41:14] something very very special he preaches
[1:41:17] a wonderful message a testimony he tells
[1:41:21] them and they couldn't take it they said
[1:41:24] put their hands in their ears and now
[1:41:25] they're going to Stone him but why
[1:41:26] didn't God save
[1:41:28] him I mean we've got in our minds that
[1:41:30] once I accept God everything must be
[1:41:32] smooth everything must be perfect no we
[1:41:36] cannot think like that because your life
[1:41:38] there's a purpose and a reason now
[1:41:40] here's Steven and there's a young man
[1:41:42] standing there
[1:41:43] Saul this whole happening of Steven was
[1:41:46] for that
[1:41:47] man that would become a messenger to the
[1:41:50] first church Age The Prophet says this
[1:41:52] was the the beginning of Saul's
[1:41:55] conversion when he saw a man that could
[1:41:57] look to heaven and wor worship God in
[1:41:59] the middle of the greatest test as the
[1:42:01] Rocks come against his head he raises up
[1:42:04] his hand and he says Lord forgive them
[1:42:06] he looks into heaven and God takes him
[1:42:07] up he says it's such an effect upon Saul
[1:42:10] that it never left him that was the
[1:42:13] beginning and the preparation of Saul's
[1:42:15] conversion so Steven had a major part to
[1:42:18] play but he had to die to play the
[1:42:22] part for you to play a part you have to
[1:42:24] sacrifice something for you to stand as
[1:42:26] a witness things must happen in your
[1:42:29] life things that you can never explain
[1:42:31] that's right you would look at other
[1:42:32] people and say nothing happened to them
[1:42:34] don't worry they carry their cross every
[1:42:36] house got a cross every person has got a
[1:42:39] burden to bear but the purpose is always
[1:42:41] for
[1:42:42] somebody there is always reason behind
[1:42:45] it your your suffering is not without
[1:42:48] reason just always remember that when
[1:42:50] you want to give up no there's a reason
[1:42:52] behind it God knows why he allowed it
[1:42:55] because we can find these
[1:42:57] examples amen but that's why we never
[1:43:01] rank can I take off my
[1:43:04] jacket my we never rank people in
[1:43:11] church we should never do that um we
[1:43:14] should never look at it and we should
[1:43:16] always understand that once you start to
[1:43:18] rank people like you know the pastor the
[1:43:21] Deacon the pro the the apost OST or
[1:43:23] whatever you want to we don't rank
[1:43:26] people because it is
[1:43:29] dangerous we love everybody the same we
[1:43:33] honor gifts we respect one another but
[1:43:38] we don't have a ranking system where one
[1:43:40] believer is more important than another
[1:43:42] Believer from the highest to the lowest
[1:43:45] from the poorest to the richest from the
[1:43:47] most beautiful to the most ugly we are
[1:43:49] all the
[1:43:50] same is that true yes it's true I know
[1:43:54] I'm not the most beautiful person but I
[1:43:56] love the Lord amen so we trust the Lord
[1:43:59] because we are not in
[1:44:01] competition that's right we are not in a
[1:44:04] spiritual competition many times we
[1:44:07] think we're in a spiritual competition
[1:44:09] you are not in a spiritual competition
[1:44:11] you have been bought you have been
[1:44:13] sealed and you are a son and daughter of
[1:44:15] God and that settles the matter if
[1:44:17] you've read one spoken word if you read
[1:44:19] nothing this week it does not change
[1:44:21] your status we are not in a competition
[1:44:24] to see how much you have done how much
[1:44:26] you've listened because the devil can
[1:44:28] also listen to
[1:44:30] it the devil can listen to more tapes
[1:44:32] than you can listen to your
[1:44:35] life yes he's he's he's much more equal
[1:44:38] you know effluent he's much more um he's
[1:44:41] got much more of a capacity to do things
[1:44:44] that's why we're not in a competition to
[1:44:46] see who's the most
[1:44:48] spiritual in a church we are not in a
[1:44:51] competition to see who knows knows the
[1:44:53] the the the the most what does the Bible
[1:44:56] say if you've got a matter to address
[1:44:58] call the one who knows the least in the
[1:45:00] church let him judge it you know that's
[1:45:03] what the Bible says because if you've
[1:45:05] got the Holy Ghost God can speak through
[1:45:07] you things which can confine the wisdom
[1:45:10] of man so we're not interested who's the
[1:45:13] best we are not interested to know but
[1:45:15] we are here to celebrate gifts if God
[1:45:18] start to use somebody in the church we
[1:45:20] rally behind that gift and we lift up
[1:45:22] that gift and we pray for that gift and
[1:45:24] we support that gift that's what the
[1:45:26] church is supposed to do rather compete
[1:45:29] against your flesh if you are a
[1:45:32] competing person compete your
[1:45:37] flesh don't compete against your brother
[1:45:39] or
[1:45:40] sister take your flesh that right we're
[1:45:42] going to compete see who's the
[1:45:45] strongest you know who's going to win
[1:45:47] this battle and then you start a
[1:45:48] competition with your flesh you start to
[1:45:50] put him in sub you start to give him
[1:45:52] Direction you start to give him give him
[1:45:54] some some guidelines and some
[1:45:55] limitations and start to hone him down
[1:45:57] and then then you're in a good point to
[1:45:59] see and start to exercise your faith who
[1:46:02] can make the decisions Luke chap
[1:46:06] 22:40 Luke chap
[1:46:08] 22:40 Jesus going into
[1:46:11] Gethsemane now here's the word in
[1:46:14] flesh walking you know looking and
[1:46:18] understanding and has got all the mind
[1:46:20] of God the fullness of God in him and
[1:46:21] he's walking now he's is going to his
[1:46:24] greatest trial he's going to the the
[1:46:26] place of decision The Wine Press of God
[1:46:30] and when he was at that place he said
[1:46:32] unto them pray that you enter not into
[1:46:35] temptation and he was withdrawn from
[1:46:37] them about a stone cast and he kneeled
[1:46:39] down and prayed and saying father if
[1:46:41] thou be willing remove this cup from me
[1:46:45] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:46:49] done amen and there appeared an angel
[1:46:52] unto him him from Heaven strengthening
[1:46:55] him now can you imagine that the word in
[1:46:58] flesh when he was at his greatest test
[1:47:01] and trial of his life he needed an angel
[1:47:04] to visit him to impart strength so what
[1:47:07] about me and you living in 2024 when
[1:47:10] pressure starts to mount and so on we
[1:47:12] also need the visitations of God that's
[1:47:15] why when we come on a Sunday morning I
[1:47:17] always say Lord strengthen me oh God
[1:47:19] visit me oh God and Quicken me that I
[1:47:21] can face another week
[1:47:23] so we're not coming to church to be
[1:47:27] saved is that too
[1:47:29] strong maybe I should pull that back
[1:47:31] brother no it's true we are not coming
[1:47:34] to church to be saved church can never
[1:47:36] save
[1:47:38] you because if church can save you it
[1:47:40] will save the make believer and the
[1:47:43] unbeliever but we are coming here to be
[1:47:45] energized we are coming here to find our
[1:47:48] place we are coming here to have a
[1:47:50] visitation because as I said when we
[1:47:52] come together we bring the supernatural
[1:47:54] down and when the supernatural is here I
[1:47:56] can just reach out my hand and Touch the
[1:47:58] Hem of His Garment and I can be
[1:48:00] energized for my position my situation
[1:48:03] and Monday morning I can face the devil
[1:48:06] again that's why it's so wonderful when
[1:48:08] we're in Heavenly places that we are not
[1:48:10] in New Zealand this morning we are right
[1:48:12] in heaven because that's where we want
[1:48:13] to be to be
[1:48:15] energized so they appeared an angel unto
[1:48:17] him for he from Heaven strengthening him
[1:48:21] because it's a time of decision
[1:48:23] it was not an easy decision he knew what
[1:48:25] the price was involved and the prophet
[1:48:27] says this is where the victory was won
[1:48:30] not on Calvary but right
[1:48:31] here right here he says it was done
[1:48:35] because once he said I'll do it he took
[1:48:37] the cup of God's Wrath he drank it and
[1:48:38] he walked out there he was like a lamb
[1:48:40] to the
[1:48:41] slaughter he never argued he he took the
[1:48:44] decision and it's the same with us your
[1:48:46] Victory lies in your decision when you
[1:48:48] make the decision the victory is done if
[1:48:50] you make it the right way God will help
[1:48:53] you and back you up all the
[1:48:54] way God has never failed us and God can
[1:48:57] never fail us now remember a prophet was
[1:49:00] born with a special gift he was a
[1:49:04] prophetic gift he was the last Messenger
[1:49:07] to the last Church age we understand
[1:49:10] that he came and God chose him before
[1:49:13] his birth to be the prophet you could
[1:49:17] not apply for it because if you look at
[1:49:19] his parents it was a disaster
[1:49:23] yes they were drinkers murderers I don't
[1:49:25] know what else according to his own
[1:49:27] words his grandparents the
[1:49:29] disaster everything around him a
[1:49:32] disaster even the extended family
[1:49:35] disaster if I would choose the last
[1:49:37] messenger I would certainly not choose
[1:49:39] in that
[1:49:40] family because what can come out of that
[1:49:43] family but that's why God chose me and
[1:49:45] that's why God chose you he doesn't look
[1:49:47] at that he look at predestinated he look
[1:49:49] at his own world and he knows and he
[1:49:51] understands and that's why love him that
[1:49:53] it doesn't matter what my father has
[1:49:54] done my grandfather has done I am an
[1:49:56] individual that God chose me and he
[1:49:59] loved me and I appreciate that I
[1:50:01] embraced it that's why I walk with that
[1:50:04] and I'm free from the guilt and shame
[1:50:06] that the family would carry because I am
[1:50:08] a new creation I have been born again I
[1:50:10] have joined into another
[1:50:13] family am mean because if you look at
[1:50:15] your own family you know you if they ask
[1:50:16] you what family are you from no I'm not
[1:50:18] from that family I'm from the other one
[1:50:21] sometimes you're ashamed
[1:50:23] and I think that's the way the prophet
[1:50:25] were you know he was so so I would
[1:50:28] almost say
[1:50:29] humiliated by the circumstances which he
[1:50:32] had no control so on his birth when he
[1:50:34] was born you know he was almost killed
[1:50:37] because we know as his mother gave birth
[1:50:39] he was he and her was alone there and
[1:50:42] the fire dried up and you know the
[1:50:44] snowstorm was there it was dangerous and
[1:50:47] the Holy Ghost moved on the neighbor to
[1:50:48] say there's no smoke in the in the in
[1:50:50] the fire there there's no smoke there
[1:50:52] amen and the Holy Ghost moved him to go
[1:50:55] there and get wood so that they can
[1:50:58] survive because God could not allowed
[1:51:00] that his gift could be taken away
[1:51:02] prematurely because God is
[1:51:05] God and at 7 years old we know when he
[1:51:08] walks and he's carrying
[1:51:10] water now I like this when he he's
[1:51:13] carrying water to where not to the
[1:51:15] animals the the cows and stuff brother
[1:51:17] Steve or to the Sheep food he was
[1:51:20] carrying water to the Whiskey Still
[1:51:24] he's now he's now helping the devil
[1:51:27] creating whiskey so that people can
[1:51:29] become
[1:51:32] alcoholics is that true as a Young Man
[1:51:34] he'd know say his father told him this
[1:51:36] is what you'll do or I'll beat you so
[1:51:38] he's carrying the water as he's carrying
[1:51:41] the water the malberry trees start to
[1:51:43] move and there's a whirlwind which pulls
[1:51:44] his attention and he looks at that and
[1:51:46] the voice says to him don't smoke drink
[1:51:48] toile your body in any way because I've
[1:51:49] got a work for you to do God was not
[1:51:52] worried about him carrying the water to
[1:51:54] the Whiskey
[1:51:55] Still you know many times we want to put
[1:51:57] the cart before the
[1:51:59] horses but I believe you know when God
[1:52:01] has got a place and a time like I said a
[1:52:03] chairos time for the prophet to be
[1:52:06] ignited into his ministry he could not
[1:52:08] be ignited at seven years although it
[1:52:11] was the pillar of fire there speaking to
[1:52:14] him there's a time and many times we
[1:52:17] lose focus we want to push maybe our
[1:52:19] children into a certain time slot or
[1:52:21] this or that you should trust the Lord
[1:52:23] to say Lord Jesus if there is
[1:52:25] predestinated seed at your time it will
[1:52:28] be
[1:52:30] ignited you cannot change
[1:52:33] that but we are human we want to push we
[1:52:36] want to influence we want to we want to
[1:52:39] do certain things but trust the Lord
[1:52:41] you'll do much
[1:52:43] better then they go fishing after that
[1:52:45] some few years after that and now they
[1:52:47] are in the fishing boat and the man that
[1:52:49] fishes with his dad is he says it's a
[1:52:52] and I liked very much just I liked him
[1:52:55] because he paid me 10 cents per
[1:52:58] bottle per Empty Bottle I walked the
[1:53:01] streets he said that was my job I walk
[1:53:03] the streets looking for
[1:53:05] empty wine bottles or whiskey bottles or
[1:53:08] whatever and then I bring this to this
[1:53:09] man and then he pays me 10 cents per
[1:53:11] bottle so he was my favorite man he say
[1:53:15] and now they're on the ship or the
[1:53:16] little boat they're going fishing and
[1:53:17] the man pulls out the whiskey that they
[1:53:19] made he took a big big sup or whatever
[1:53:22] and he hands it to him to the Prophet
[1:53:25] The Prophet says no thank you I don't
[1:53:27] drink but he's still picking up those
[1:53:29] bottles he's still involved in the
[1:53:32] process as the young man there and uh
[1:53:34] the man was shocked he says a brandom
[1:53:36] that does not drink I've never met a
[1:53:38] person like that and the dad says to him
[1:53:42] you know what no I I raised one
[1:53:44] boy now that to any young man when your
[1:53:47] dad says you are a boy it breaks
[1:53:50] you it's got such a such an influence
[1:53:53] upon you and he says that was too much
[1:53:55] he says I said to the man give me that
[1:53:56] bottle I'll show you who's a boy
[1:53:59] and he took that bottle he says I'm will
[1:54:01] I was willing and ready to drink it but
[1:54:03] when I took it and I brought it to my
[1:54:05] lips he says that same
[1:54:07] wind no voice no just the wind say and I
[1:54:11] knew it was the supernatural visitation
[1:54:14] of God and I gave back the bottle and I
[1:54:16] started to cry and the man really said
[1:54:18] yes you are a boy and that's the
[1:54:21] effect upon him so you can understand
[1:54:22] the mental pressure that he growing up
[1:54:25] in a family that drinks from morning
[1:54:27] till evening they produce their own
[1:54:30] drinks because it was
[1:54:31] illegal so they're doing it undercover
[1:54:34] all the pressure mounts upon him and
[1:54:36] he's growing up he's now 14 15 16 in
[1:54:39] those years and his dad calls him a
[1:54:41] and he's under
[1:54:42] pressure
[1:54:45] amen and then he says when I was
[1:54:48] 18 says I found a lovely young girl my
[1:54:52] friend had her his his girlfriend and I
[1:54:54] had my girlfriend and we said we're
[1:54:55] going to go out on a
[1:54:57] date we got into the car I think it was
[1:55:00] a convertible and went beautiful they
[1:55:03] drove down the streets have a good time
[1:55:05] stopped at The Roadhouse or whatever
[1:55:08] went in he says we bought Cokes and
[1:55:10] sandwiches and we got into the car we
[1:55:13] had sandwiches and cokes and just a
[1:55:15] wonderful time just and this this lady
[1:55:18] was so
[1:55:19] beautiful he says you know how pretty
[1:55:21] she was she had eyes like a Dove
[1:55:25] Brothers have you ever seen
[1:55:27] that eyes like a dove these bachel
[1:55:30] brothers
[1:55:32] man teeth like
[1:55:35] pearls you can
[1:55:37] imagine you can almost see
[1:55:40] it neck like a
[1:55:42] swan so that's how he describes
[1:55:45] her you know and there we I I just loved
[1:55:49] her and the prettiest thing you've ever
[1:55:51] seen no no she was
[1:55:54] pretty and he says man I I was so I was
[1:55:57] so excited and and after eating the the
[1:55:59] the sandwiches and drinking the cokes he
[1:56:01] says I I went back to take the cokes
[1:56:03] back to get the money for the bottles
[1:56:05] back the deposit and so on he says and
[1:56:07] when I got out and I looked at the car
[1:56:08] and yet they were all sitting
[1:56:11] smoking now the beautiful swan
[1:56:14] neck P teeth Dove
[1:56:18] eyye girl with a stinking cigarette in
[1:56:21] the mouth
[1:56:22] I mean you know he says I was shocked
[1:56:26] and I came to them and she offered me
[1:56:28] the pack B here's a smoke for you he
[1:56:30] says no I don't smoke he says what do
[1:56:33] you do you don't smoke you don't drink
[1:56:34] what do you do for fun he says I fish
[1:56:35] and I
[1:56:36] hunt and she made a very bad
[1:56:40] comment and she said to him oh you're a
[1:56:42] boy now remember his dad already
[1:56:46] called him a
[1:56:47] now the love of his
[1:56:50] life you can maybe handle your dad but
[1:56:52] when a girl tells you that that's
[1:56:55] bad and she says you're a
[1:56:58] boy and my girl called me a and I
[1:57:00] said hand me that packet of
[1:57:02] cigarettes and I got a hold of one and
[1:57:05] just as determined to smoke it God is my
[1:57:07] judge and when I started to light that
[1:57:09] cigarette before I could strike the
[1:57:10] match I hear it to come
[1:57:14] again that's all he needed to hear God
[1:57:17] already told him so God didn't repeat it
[1:57:20] but when he heard that same wind he knew
[1:57:22] knew that same message was behind that
[1:57:23] wind am you know and he just looked at
[1:57:26] it and I turned and I got out of the car
[1:57:30] crying for a 18-year-old young strong
[1:57:34] man in front of the love that he thinks
[1:57:36] is the love of his life to start to cry
[1:57:38] is
[1:57:40] bir crying and they turned the lights on
[1:57:43] me and and they let me walk up that road
[1:57:45] follow me with their lights on singing
[1:57:47] to me and making fun of me can you
[1:57:50] imagine the lights behind him
[1:57:52] singing oh boy
[1:57:55] boy he says it just almost destroyed him
[1:58:00] singing to me making fun of me because I
[1:58:01] was too much of a to smoke a
[1:58:04] cigarette that's
[1:58:06] pressure that is peer pressure to the
[1:58:09] extreme limit you know you have been
[1:58:12] humiliated you have been you have been
[1:58:13] called names you have been just just and
[1:58:16] now you want to prove that you're a man
[1:58:18] and and you can't do it because God
[1:58:19] won't allow you I thank God that he
[1:58:22] didn't allow that Prophet to go his own
[1:58:24] way I thank God that he stepped on the
[1:58:26] scene I thank God that it was not
[1:58:28] negotiable amen for me and you we went
[1:58:31] different ways and God allowed it and
[1:58:32] you came back on the right road but for
[1:58:34] the prophet which had a such a unique
[1:58:36] Ministry God had to protect it for me
[1:58:38] and for you he was called a for me
[1:58:41] he cried for me he was rejected for
[1:58:44] me to bring a message so that I could
[1:58:47] see Jesus Christ in the reality and
[1:58:50] accept him as my personal savior
[1:58:53] amen he says it wasn't that I was too
[1:58:55] much of a but God was preserving
[1:58:58] the gift for this day that's all it was
[1:59:02] and me I was determined to do it what is
[1:59:05] the prophet saying here he's saying I
[1:59:07] wanted to do it it was not because I was
[1:59:10] a prophet that I didn't do it I wanted
[1:59:12] to do it but God took a control of the
[1:59:15] situation and he refused it and that's
[1:59:17] how I trust God that if I am part of the
[1:59:20] Bride of the Lord Jesus which I Believe
[1:59:22] by Grace he will take care of me he will
[1:59:25] prepare me he will have me ready when my
[1:59:27] name is called I'll say Lord I'm ready
[1:59:30] let's go it's not up to me it's not up
[1:59:33] to you but it's up to God now Jesus
[1:59:36] comes and he walks and and and and and
[1:59:39] you know Jesus had
[1:59:41] appointments the whole life of Jesus was
[1:59:43] directed by appointments he had a diary
[1:59:47] which was set before the foundation of
[1:59:49] the world he didn't just walk around and
[1:59:51] find somebody hdly on the street and say
[1:59:53] how are you God bless
[1:59:55] you before he was born every day of his
[1:59:58] life was written out every meeting was
[2:00:02] noted and one meeting I love especially
[2:00:05] the prophet speaks about it so so much
[2:00:07] is a woman at the
[2:00:10] well I mean he's busy it's not really a
[2:00:14] time and this but he's busy and all of a
[2:00:16] sudden out of the blue he says to
[2:00:19] disciples um go buy
[2:00:23] food now you don't send 12 disciples to
[2:00:26] buy food like I always tell the church
[2:00:29] you know I've got a few Brothers when we
[2:00:30] work there and they we need to buy
[2:00:31] Kentucky they all want to go together
[2:00:33] because then they take hours so I've
[2:00:35] learned to say no one only you choose
[2:00:37] who's going because the more they are
[2:00:39] together the longer they take you don't
[2:00:42] need five or 12 Brothers to carry a few
[2:00:44] bags of food but Jesus says all of you
[2:00:47] go buy
[2:00:49] food and they go
[2:00:52] and he goes and he sits out there on a
[2:00:54] little wall cuz he knew two minutes
[2:00:57] she'll be here and I don't want anybody
[2:01:00] around because this meeting was noted in
[2:01:02] my diary as a private
[2:01:06] meeting I thank God that he's a God that
[2:01:09] respects my privacy God will never
[2:01:12] humiliate you I don't care if if the
[2:01:14] poopit humiliates you you're in the
[2:01:15] wrong
[2:01:16] poopit the purpose of the poopit is not
[2:01:19] to humiliate you is to identify to help
[2:01:22] you to expose sin and to help you but
[2:01:23] not to humiliate you it is to raise you
[2:01:26] up and to build you and to place you and
[2:01:28] to give you the grace to know that Lord
[2:01:30] I feel so
[2:01:31] loved and here she comes private
[2:01:36] meeting all the all the all the
[2:01:38] disciples gone if he wanted them there
[2:01:40] to Witnesses he would have kept them but
[2:01:43] he knew this woman had done things in
[2:01:44] her life which nobody else should
[2:01:46] here it was not
[2:01:48] good and as she comes you know he he he
[2:01:53] initiates the
[2:01:54] contact says don't you want to get me
[2:01:56] water now she was not she was well
[2:01:59] spoken she she was not afraid to speak
[2:02:01] her
[2:02:02] mind is why you speak to me you're not
[2:02:04] allowed to speak to me you know
[2:02:06] that by the
[2:02:08] laws and he says if you knew who was
[2:02:10] speaking to you you'll ask me for water
[2:02:13] she say oh you're making jokes you don't
[2:02:15] even have anything to catch water with
[2:02:17] that was the conversation she was not
[2:02:19] shy in that way she was a very
[2:02:21] expressive she she knew certain things
[2:02:23] and then he says to her go get your
[2:02:25] husband she says I have no
[2:02:27] husband says you're right you had five
[2:02:30] the one you're living with now is not
[2:02:31] your husband M she looked at him and
[2:02:33] says do we know when the Messiah come he
[2:02:35] will do this he says it's me speaking to
[2:02:37] you and she runs and sets her down on
[2:02:40] fire because he has found her the Lost
[2:02:43] SP but it was
[2:02:45] Private maybe he said other things to
[2:02:48] her there we won't know but I tell you
[2:02:50] what he wanted it to be priv it he
[2:02:52] written it in the Bible for us to
[2:02:54] understand the discernment of the
[2:02:55] intents of the heart and we thank God
[2:02:57] for such a god such an expression of of
[2:03:01] Grace towards me and you I have never in
[2:03:04] my life felt humiliated by my
[2:03:07] God I have never ever felt
[2:03:11] belittled I have never ever felt that he
[2:03:13] does not love me unconditional love like
[2:03:17] you will never experience that's the way
[2:03:19] we feel to know Lord God I don't deserve
[2:03:21] it but Lord Jesus you loves
[2:03:23] us amen that's why the prophet many
[2:03:26] times says in the prayer line when you
[2:03:28] come in the prayer line confess your sin
[2:03:30] before you come to me because I won't be
[2:03:33] accountable for what I'm going to say
[2:03:34] because God's going to say it the way it
[2:03:36] is so even God there gave the people
[2:03:38] opportunity that as he comes you can say
[2:03:40] Lord Jesus I've done something terrible
[2:03:42] forgive me and when you enter that
[2:03:45] presence where the angel was that the
[2:03:47] Propet would say he can't see that taken
[2:03:50] away not even a glimpse the prophet had
[2:03:52] no idea what that person and he could
[2:03:54] have been an adulterer there but when he
[2:03:56] when he says Lord forgive me and he
[2:03:58] steps in front of into that presence the
[2:04:00] blood has already washed it
[2:04:02] clean that the prophet could look at him
[2:04:05] and just say I see you are sick I see
[2:04:06] you on the bed you see
[2:04:08] this the power and the wisdom and the
[2:04:12] grace and the the the wonderful way that
[2:04:15] God administers his gifts that's why we
[2:04:18] appreciate the gifts of God so so much
[2:04:21] but Satan will humiliate
[2:04:23] you he doesn't
[2:04:25] care he will spread stories about you he
[2:04:29] will gossip about you he will lie about
[2:04:32] you God's not like that God will never
[2:04:36] gossip about you God will never lie
[2:04:38] about you but the devil he doesn't worry
[2:04:41] he's not interested in that so we trust
[2:04:43] and believe that the Lord will help us
[2:04:46] now Job 1 verse 6
[2:04:52] job
[2:04:55] 1:6 there was a day when the sons of God
[2:04:58] came to present themselves before the
[2:05:00] Lord and Satan came also among
[2:05:03] them now this is a serious
[2:05:06] situation there was a
[2:05:08] day when the sons of God came to
[2:05:11] presents before the Lord and Satan also
[2:05:15] come among
[2:05:17] them so what are we doing this
[2:05:19] morning we are presenting ourselves
[2:05:22] before God we are approaching his throne
[2:05:26] we we are pulling needs everyone as we
[2:05:28] sit here we've got
[2:05:29] needs but guess what Satan also came in
[2:05:33] this
[2:05:34] morning we think that Satan has got no
[2:05:36] right to enter a church he's got right
[2:05:39] to enter the throne room of God not
[2:05:42] asking but God gave him the
[2:05:45] permission because God wanted him
[2:05:48] present God wants Satan to see what God
[2:05:51] God can
[2:05:53] do so here the sons of God present and
[2:05:55] Satan among them and the Lord says look
[2:05:57] at verse 7 and the Lord said unto Satan
[2:06:00] where comest thou the Lord engaged
[2:06:04] him doesn't say what are you doing here
[2:06:07] out that's why we must understand when
[2:06:09] we come together like this Satan also
[2:06:12] comes because he looks at
[2:06:13] us say my do you believe what's been
[2:06:16] preached or are you to already on Monday
[2:06:19] morning with the problem at the work
[2:06:21] you're in church but your mind is
[2:06:23] already on
[2:06:24] Monday or maybe
[2:06:26] Wednesday you know you can move around
[2:06:29] you can sit in church but you can be in
[2:06:30] South
[2:06:31] Africa or in America or in Hawaii on the
[2:06:36] beach looking forward to that lovely
[2:06:38] Holiday in the Sun you know your mind
[2:06:40] can take you
[2:06:42] places that's why Satan comes in with
[2:06:44] you he's here to destruct you he's here
[2:06:46] to keep you busy that's why it's
[2:06:48] important when you start to wonder know
[2:06:50] that there's an EV
[2:06:52] that try to push and just bring it back
[2:06:54] and find something that you can aim in
[2:06:55] and say Lord thank you
[2:06:57] Jesus and the devil will pull his hands
[2:07:00] back and he will go to your neighbor and
[2:07:02] if you see your neighbor start to sleep
[2:07:03] help him thank you
[2:07:05] Lord and He will wake up and he can help
[2:07:07] his neighbor so because we are
[2:07:10] one we're not yet to say but you that
[2:07:12] brother slept nicely in this service
[2:07:15] man I think it's a record it's 45
[2:07:18] minutes when we have lunch later today
[2:07:21] we'll discuss who slept the most no we
[2:07:23] are here we are Brothers Keeper and we
[2:07:25] are here because we know the enemy is
[2:07:27] also here God is here and where God is
[2:07:28] the enemy is
[2:07:30] also because the God allows him
[2:07:34] access because God has not limited him
[2:07:36] in that way but God limits him in other
[2:07:38] ways what he can do to you and the Lord
[2:07:42] said unto Satan hast thou considered my
[2:07:44] servant job there is none like him on
[2:07:47] the earth a perfect and upright man one
[2:07:49] that fear of God and ath Evil
[2:07:52] so God now puts out a testimony about
[2:07:54] job and and and because God wants Satan
[2:07:56] to take note because God wants Satan to
[2:07:59] act he needs him now to do certain
[2:08:02] things and you know how it goes and how
[2:08:04] God allows him to say you can go and
[2:08:06] take him because Satan says yes because
[2:08:07] you protect him that he loves you he
[2:08:09] says take him but don't take his life so
[2:08:11] God allows Satan God takes him gives him
[2:08:14] power but it's limited power Satan does
[2:08:17] not have power but God allows him under
[2:08:20] the condition s to do certain things so
[2:08:24] it's a power with limits now in the
[2:08:27] message of Testament on the SE the
[2:08:29] prophet says that's the way it is it's
[2:08:31] always a mixed crowd believer make
[2:08:35] believer and unbeliever always
[2:08:37] conglomerate together there they are
[2:08:39] even when the sons of God came up before
[2:08:41] God in the Book of Job he said Satan was
[2:08:43] sitting among them exactly right when
[2:08:45] the sons of God appeared in the presence
[2:08:47] of God they are always there now and
[2:08:50] here they were there there and one
[2:08:52] saying one thing and another saying
[2:08:53] another thing so what is the prophet
[2:08:56] telling us it says when God gathers in
[2:08:58] heaven Satan is
[2:09:00] there just
[2:09:02] always it it is a principle he still got
[2:09:06] free reign in terms of roaming around
[2:09:08] there will come a time where he will be
[2:09:10] destroyed but that time is not now he
[2:09:13] now there like a roaring line see you
[2:09:16] can devour so we must understand the
[2:09:18] role when we come in here we need to
[2:09:19] protect we need to create a wonderful
[2:09:21] atmosphere and we need to be focused in
[2:09:23] and and and tapped into God to receive
[2:09:26] what the Lord wants us to do now
[2:09:28] remember as we said visitations is
[2:09:31] important to revive our spirits to keep
[2:09:34] us going some of us has been in the
[2:09:36] message for 2 years or one year serving
[2:09:38] the lord received the grace of the Lord
[2:09:40] being born again some longer some
[2:09:42] shorter but in this journey you will
[2:09:45] always needs quickening power that's
[2:09:47] right because you'll become tired you'll
[2:09:50] become weary and you need some
[2:09:51] injections like Elijah after his Mount
[2:09:54] carel he could kill those prophets and
[2:09:56] he could call fire from heaven and the
[2:09:58] next day you find him running crawling
[2:10:00] under a bush say Lord let me
[2:10:03] die from this eye to that l in one
[2:10:06] day that's how it works but God does say
[2:10:09] are you worthless useless Prophet let me
[2:10:11] who's next in
[2:10:13] line no when God chooses you he sticks
[2:10:16] with you when God calls you he stays
[2:10:19] with you God doesn't give up on you God
[2:10:22] is not in the temporal thing when he
[2:10:24] takes you it's
[2:10:25] permanent it's it's completed it's
[2:10:28] sealed it's it's it's done so what does
[2:10:30] God do he sends an angel from heaven say
[2:10:33] yo my prophet he needs he needs
[2:10:35] something special and he finds him under
[2:10:37] the bush he doesn't wake him up he first
[2:10:40] prepares the
[2:10:41] meal then he wakes him up says
[2:10:43] eat Prophet eats he sleeps again he
[2:10:48] makes some more wakes him up again he
[2:10:50] says eat cuz this journey in front of
[2:10:52] you is heavy you're going to need what
[2:10:54] you are eating here the word of God
[2:10:56] that's why when you eat the word of God
[2:10:58] when you come together in church when
[2:10:59] you Feast on that Heavenly Mana it
[2:11:01] feasts you it gives you strength to face
[2:11:03] the battles that you've got no idea
[2:11:05] that's in front of you but it sustains
[2:11:08] you now
[2:11:10] remember like I said Satan has got a
[2:11:13] certain access to the throne of God he's
[2:11:15] got a way like if we take an example
[2:11:18] First Kings chapter 22:3
[2:11:21] yeah is where Micah the prophet is there
[2:11:24] aab and them wants to go and fight other
[2:11:26] kingdoms and they need to know from the
[2:11:27] Lord is this your will or
[2:11:30] not and 400 Prophet says go you will
[2:11:34] conquer go I see the enemy slaughtered
[2:11:37] who it's it's in your
[2:11:39] hands and the King says is there not one
[2:11:42] Prophet more left just to just to just
[2:11:45] to complete the prophecy why do you need
[2:11:48] one more if you already had 400
[2:11:51] because he himself
[2:11:53] knew deep from that inside that listen
[2:11:56] man there's an Elijah there is Elijah
[2:11:59] that prophesied something way back y
[2:12:01] back but I need another Prophet because
[2:12:03] I'm scared for my
[2:12:04] life he was worried for his life because
[2:12:07] Elijah remember what Elijah has done
[2:12:09] when when when aab was there and he
[2:12:11] wanted nebo's
[2:12:13] Vineyard now he looked at nebo's
[2:12:15] Vineyard was next to his house so he
[2:12:18] came to nebor he said to him can I buy
[2:12:20] The Vineyard from I'll give you a bigger
[2:12:22] Farm I'll give you a better Farm I'll
[2:12:25] give you something more I'll pay you
[2:12:26] money whatever just give the land to me
[2:12:28] because it's next to my Palace and I can
[2:12:30] at evening time Walk Through The
[2:12:32] Vineyards there so wonderful it's so
[2:12:33] it's so convenient for me and Ne came to
[2:12:36] him and he say to him no uh the Lord
[2:12:38] said to me not to do it I cannot give
[2:12:40] away my inheritance that's right you
[2:12:42] never negotiate with the devil he wants
[2:12:44] to give you something bigger something
[2:12:46] better a better message you say thank
[2:12:48] you I'm happy with my message thank you
[2:12:51] I have received what I
[2:12:52] need and ABAB went
[2:12:55] home and he went like many of us do when
[2:12:58] when when the answer is
[2:13:00] no he closed the door behind him he lays
[2:13:03] on his bed he turns to the to the
[2:13:06] wall like your children does when you
[2:13:09] say no to
[2:13:11] them and his wife they bring him food he
[2:13:14] says no I'm not going to
[2:13:16] eat why no because naov doesn't want to
[2:13:18] give me his lands and Jezebel said
[2:13:21] that's not a
[2:13:22] problem are you not King leave it to me
[2:13:26] here eat I'll sort it out man and aab
[2:13:29] was happy he ate his meal and he left it
[2:13:30] to his wife and she went she find two
[2:13:32] Liars sons of Bal which is Sons of liars
[2:13:35] and she said you go you make up a false
[2:13:37] confession about him and take the people
[2:13:39] and stone him and she write letters like
[2:13:42] that sealing it as it was the king
[2:13:44] written it and they go they kill him and
[2:13:47] now you know aab goes into the land and
[2:13:49] she says here it is for free don't have
[2:13:51] to pay a
[2:13:52] scent and as he's walking in The
[2:13:54] Vineyards the Lord came to Elijah and
[2:13:56] says go and speak to him and as he comes
[2:13:59] you know how ABAB greets him he says Oh
[2:14:01] My Enemy what are you going to do today
[2:14:03] to me remember the word is not your
[2:14:06] enemy The Prophet is not your enemy you
[2:14:09] might not agree it might say things that
[2:14:11] you cannot understand believe it accept
[2:14:13] it and say Lord Jesus I humbly made
[2:14:16] myself subject to it so that prophecy
[2:14:19] was done so he knew
[2:14:22] because he said to him the the dogs is
[2:14:23] going to liak your blood where nab's
[2:14:26] blood was leaked there your blood is
[2:14:27] going to be leaked so he had that in his
[2:14:29] back part of his mind now 400 prophets
[2:14:32] says go go you'll be
[2:14:34] successful he says no there's one more
[2:14:36] let's let's get him let's get Micah in
[2:14:39] and the messenger that was gone in verse
[2:14:41] 13 to call Micah spoke unto him saying
[2:14:44] behold now the word of the prophets
[2:14:46] declared good things unto the king with
[2:14:47] one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be
[2:14:50] like the word word of the one of them
[2:14:52] and speak that which is
[2:14:55] good so
[2:14:57] pressure just remember 400 men before
[2:15:00] you told it's going to be this way so
[2:15:01] all you need to do is just confirm just
[2:15:04] say yes it's true now look at him in
[2:15:07] verse 14 and Micah said as the Lord
[2:15:08] liveth what the Lord sa to me that will
[2:15:10] I speak that's why I love a prophet that
[2:15:13] is called a prophet from God he will
[2:15:15] only speak what God tells him to speak
[2:15:17] and that's why we love our Prophet so he
[2:15:19] only spoke what God wanted to speak amen
[2:15:22] so he came to the king and the King said
[2:15:24] unto him in verse 15 Micah shall we go
[2:15:27] against R of Gilead to battle or shall
[2:15:29] we
[2:15:30] forbear now listen to this
[2:15:34] answer and he
[2:15:36] answered go and prosper for the Lord
[2:15:40] shall deliver it unto the hand of the
[2:15:43] king
[2:15:45] wow to me that almost sounds like a
[2:15:49] lie because he I can read to you there
[2:15:52] have you read it he says to him go
[2:15:54] you'll Prosper you you'll win you the
[2:15:56] battle is yours go it's good cuz that's
[2:16:00] what he wants to hear say to him go you
[2:16:04] will forbear you'll be victorious you'll
[2:16:06] be the greatest King ever
[2:16:07] go
[2:16:09] go but the king wasn't happy why
[2:16:13] not there was an element
[2:16:16] missing there was a portion as he looked
[2:16:18] at this don't underestimate a he you
[2:16:21] know he would look at that and he would
[2:16:23] understand there's a missing part here
[2:16:26] many of us when you want to hear what
[2:16:27] you want to hear and somebody tells you
[2:16:28] like you'll run with
[2:16:30] it he told me I can do it and there you
[2:16:33] go because that's what you want to
[2:16:36] hear verse 16 and the King said unto him
[2:16:40] how many times shall I adure Thee that
[2:16:42] thou tell me nothing but that which is
[2:16:44] true in the name of the
[2:16:46] Lord there was no thus say of the Lord
[2:16:49] there
[2:16:52] he needed to add you'll go and forbear
[2:16:54] thus saith the Lord that's why when I
[2:16:57] read the message and there stands thus
[2:16:59] say of the Lord I raise my hands and I
[2:17:01] say thank you Lord Jesus it cannot but
[2:17:04] come to pass it nothing can stop those
[2:17:08] words and now the Micah start to speak
[2:17:11] again because before he just let him go
[2:17:13] you'll you'll make it he says no no no
[2:17:15] don't tell me stories tell me thus sayth
[2:17:16] the Lord that's all I'm interested in
[2:17:19] don't come and preach stories to me
[2:17:21] don't come and tell me fancy pies in the
[2:17:23] skies don't come and tell me a l story
[2:17:26] that you know this or that preach to me
[2:17:28] the unadulterated word of the Living God
[2:17:30] that is thus save the Lord and I'm happy
[2:17:32] and so every believer is the same way
[2:17:35] you can only make a Believer happy if
[2:17:37] you preach him the unadulterated word he
[2:17:40] will be happy he will be blessed he will
[2:17:42] say Lord thank you for speaking to
[2:17:45] me but these you know like I don't know
[2:17:48] how to call it but stories
[2:17:51] will not help you but the word will help
[2:17:53] you
[2:17:54] that's and now he starts says I
[2:17:58] saw God's counsel in heaven coming
[2:18:01] together and I saw God asking his
[2:18:04] counsel how are we going to make
[2:18:06] Elijah's prophecies come to pass because
[2:18:09] aab is ready to go to battle but he's
[2:18:13] scared because he knows that he's going
[2:18:15] to die and he's trying to circumvent to
[2:18:19] bypass death
[2:18:22] and the Lord says how are we going to do
[2:18:23] the Bible says some counselors said this
[2:18:25] some counselors said that there was a
[2:18:28] conversation and Micah says and then I
[2:18:30] saw a lying Spirit come out from the
[2:18:32] from the deeps of Hell into the throne
[2:18:35] room of
[2:18:37] God and he says I'll go and the Lord
[2:18:41] asked him how will you go tell me what
[2:18:43] you want to do that's how God is he
[2:18:45] wants
[2:18:46] specifics he wants detail he he directs
[2:18:49] these evil forces because he needs to
[2:18:52] guide the limits where they can operate
[2:18:54] in and that demon says I'll place a
[2:18:57] lying Spirit In The Prophet's mouth and
[2:18:59] the Lord says go you'll be
[2:19:01] successful man when Micah says that all
[2:19:04] the other prophets they got red they got
[2:19:07] blue they got purple they blood pressure
[2:19:08] through the roof you know they could
[2:19:10] just and the one walked up to him and he
[2:19:12] smacked him in the mouth he says where
[2:19:13] did the spirit of God go when it left me
[2:19:15] through you and this and that what a
[2:19:17] commotion and the King says look up this
[2:19:20] man's feed him the bread of misery till
[2:19:22] I come
[2:19:24] back and uh Micah said if you come back
[2:19:27] I God never spoke to
[2:19:30] me man when I think about our Prophet
[2:19:35] when he says if this does not come to
[2:19:37] pass put a Bo on my back parade me
[2:19:39] through the town and put their false
[2:19:40] prophet no man can do that but a man
[2:19:43] that's certain that God spoke to him
[2:19:45] like Micah says if you come back God
[2:19:47] never spoke to me did he come back no
[2:19:51] that was his day that was finished the
[2:19:53] prophecy were
[2:19:54] fulfilled but what does it mean it means
[2:19:57] that the principle is clear that
[2:19:59] influence can
[2:20:00] come from good or from bad you must
[2:20:04] always make sure that your influence
[2:20:06] your ignation what inspires you what
[2:20:08] what ministers to you what what what
[2:20:10] guides and feeds you is from the word of
[2:20:12] God from God himself then you'll have
[2:20:15] good proper results you'll be a settled
[2:20:18] established believer
[2:20:20] amen because you need to understand that
[2:20:23] your own righteousness cannot achieve
[2:20:25] anything your own righteousness cannot
[2:20:28] do anything let's go to Zechariah
[2:20:35] 3:1 Zechariah CH 3 from verse
[2:20:39] 1 and we'll just take the few first
[2:20:41] verses then we'll continue with that
[2:20:42] then the guiding Angel showed me Joshua
[2:20:44] I'll read from the
[2:20:46] Amplified then the guiding Angel showed
[2:20:48] me Joshua the high priest
[2:20:51] representing disobedient sinful Israel
[2:20:54] standing before the angel of the Lord
[2:20:56] and Satan standing at Joshua right hand
[2:20:58] to be his adversary and to accuse him so
[2:21:02] remember that's the great work that
[2:21:03] Satan does is to accuse you daily he's
[2:21:07] the accuser of the Brethren daily so
[2:21:09] here's Joshua the high priest dressed in
[2:21:11] his high priest garments he's standing
[2:21:14] before the Lord and the Satan is next to
[2:21:16] him and the Satan is accusing him now
[2:21:18] look how he accus him and the Lord said
[2:21:20] to the Lord rebuke you Satan even the
[2:21:23] Lord who now and ever has chosen
[2:21:25] Jerusalem rebuke you is this not a lock
[2:21:28] snatched and rescued from the
[2:21:30] fire now remember all of you were
[2:21:32] destined for
[2:21:33] hell he says but this log was rescued
[2:21:36] from the fire I am rescued from the fire
[2:21:39] I had nothing to do I had nothing to do
[2:21:41] with my salvation I was just just just
[2:21:44] not even interested in God but God
[2:21:46] pulled me from the fire and he changed
[2:21:49] my destiny amen now Joshua in verse
[2:21:52] three was clothed with
[2:21:54] FY nauseatingly vile garments and was
[2:21:58] standing before the angel of the Lord
[2:22:01] and he spoke to those who stood before
[2:22:02] him saying remove the filthy garments
[2:22:04] from him and he said to Joshua see I
[2:22:07] have caused your wickedness to be taken
[2:22:09] away from you and I will clothe and
[2:22:10] beautify you with Rich Robes of
[2:22:14] forgiveness meant that to
[2:22:17] me
[2:22:19] now Look at look at the scenario he's
[2:22:22] not just any man he's a
[2:22:25] priest and he's standing before God and
[2:22:28] when you come in the presence of God
[2:22:29] your own righteousness is like ffy
[2:22:32] Rags it's FY I don't care how long
[2:22:35] you've come to church I don't care how
[2:22:37] long you've been a pastor Prophet or
[2:22:39] whatever if you come in the presence of
[2:22:41] God with your own righteousness it's FY
[2:22:44] Rags so you'll say why didn't Joshua
[2:22:47] dress up before he met the Lord that was
[2:22:49] his best
[2:22:51] that was his best that he could present
[2:22:53] to God and still it was nauseating to
[2:22:56] the Lord when he looked at him he says
[2:22:57] it's
[2:23:00] FY because what look clean to me and you
[2:23:03] in front of God is
[2:23:05] dirty I can present my own righteousness
[2:23:07] you can think my man that brother that
[2:23:09] sister she's so
[2:23:10] holy that does not that does not statute
[2:23:13] that that it's a holy person because you
[2:23:16] can dress a certain way you can talk a
[2:23:17] certain way that's not what the Holiness
[2:23:19] and righteousness is what we are looking
[2:23:21] for because your best ability is FY Rags
[2:23:25] your best trying effort is FY Rags he
[2:23:29] says it looks clean to Men on earth
[2:23:31] looks clean when it comes in the
[2:23:33] presence of God Holiness it's
[2:23:35] FY but what do we do we compare to one
[2:23:40] another y I'm not that bad as that
[2:23:43] person they come to church once a month
[2:23:45] I'm here every Sunday brother no I'm
[2:23:48] feeling
[2:23:49] okay yo
[2:23:51] you find somebody that you compare to
[2:23:53] which is lower than you and then you
[2:23:54] feel
[2:23:55] better don't compare to anybody it's got
[2:23:59] nothing to do with you just look to the
[2:24:02] Lord and say Lord I don't want to
[2:24:04] compare myself to anybody I want to just
[2:24:05] find myself in the word let the word be
[2:24:08] my measure stick let me be found in the
[2:24:10] word because your even your most
[2:24:13] righteous Deeds are FY rags in God's
[2:24:15] presence amen so how do we get rid of
[2:24:18] this fess
[2:24:20] amen how do we want to get rid of it the
[2:24:23] problem is we want to be good
[2:24:26] enough as a human you want to be good
[2:24:28] enough in the eyes of
[2:24:30] God you can never be good enough for God
[2:24:34] in your own
[2:24:36] ability never but as a human we want to
[2:24:39] be good enough in the eyes of God so we
[2:24:41] try to be more and more to to to to to
[2:24:44] make up for the times we've messed
[2:24:47] up like let let me give you an example
[2:24:50] let's me and sister El had a big fight
[2:24:52] last night which we didn't have by the
[2:24:54] way and I walked out of the motel room
[2:24:56] and I slammed the door boom and here I
[2:25:01] go all right so I've left now we are had
[2:25:03] a big fight she's now not happy I'm not
[2:25:06] happy so I'm walking down the street and
[2:25:07] I'm wondering you know what can I
[2:25:09] do and then after some time you feel
[2:25:11] sorry and you go to countd down there
[2:25:13] and you buy a nice bush bush of flowers
[2:25:16] you come back and you knock on the
[2:25:19] door I so and she opens up and I give
[2:25:21] her the
[2:25:22] flowers I say this is for you I love
[2:25:25] you that's what we do as
[2:25:28] humans that has never canceled my bad
[2:25:32] deed I have not canceled it the only way
[2:25:34] I can cancel it is to go on my knees and
[2:25:36] say please forgive me it's the same with
[2:25:39] God we think if I've done something bad
[2:25:42] in the week and Sunday I come to church
[2:25:43] it
[2:25:44] cancels you cannot do anything to cancel
[2:25:47] a bad de in front of God you can give
[2:25:49] all money to the poor you can come to
[2:25:52] church every day you can pray 7 days a
[2:25:54] week for 24 hours a day it does not
[2:25:57] cancel bad
[2:25:58] Deeds the only thing that cancel a bad
[2:26:01] deed is on your knees with Eyes Crying
[2:26:03] to say Lord I've been wrong forgive
[2:26:06] me then it's cancelled and then on you
[2:26:09] cannot work for it you don't deserve it
[2:26:11] it's by grace and by grace alone so stop
[2:26:14] trying to work yourself into heaven and
[2:26:17] believe that God is in
[2:26:19] control and if You' done something wrong
[2:26:21] don't try and cancel it with a good
[2:26:24] deed God's not
[2:26:26] fooled just trust him and say Lord I
[2:26:29] Repent I ask you to forgive me I help me
[2:26:32] not to do it again and continue with
[2:26:35] your good deeds Good Deeds should be
[2:26:36] there as a Christian we want to live
[2:26:38] holy we want to live dedicated we want
[2:26:40] to do the right thing but don't be
[2:26:42] fooled to say you know I've stolen money
[2:26:45] this week from my company next week I'm
[2:26:46] giving to the
[2:26:48] poor so the one cancels the
[2:26:51] other I've treated my wife badly now I
[2:26:54] come with a little Bush of
[2:26:55] flowers we should buy our wife's flowers
[2:26:58] but not for
[2:27:00] forgiveness forgiveness is a talk I
[2:27:03] failed you I'm sorry forgive
[2:27:06] me you with
[2:27:08] me
[2:27:10] amen so that's what we need to do
[2:27:13] Solomon said in Proverbs who can say
[2:27:14] I've made my heart clean I'm pure from
[2:27:17] my sin nobody so Satan takes advantage
[2:27:19] of that
[2:27:20] that as we start to close Satan takes
[2:27:24] advantage of that human ability that we
[2:27:26] have to work for our
[2:27:28] righteousness to try and do good deeds
[2:27:30] to cancel the bad ones he works on that
[2:27:32] and he works he's a manipulator of that
[2:27:35] and we must be very because the Bible
[2:27:37] says we have an
[2:27:39] advocate Jesus Christ is an advocate he
[2:27:42] stands in my place he pleads my case and
[2:27:45] when I say Lord forgive me the Lord is
[2:27:47] faithful to forgive me now Joshua didn't
[2:27:50] when Satan accuses him Joshua doesn't
[2:27:52] say to Satan no you're wrong he doesn't
[2:27:56] say no my clothes are not dirty Joshua
[2:27:58] never said a word because he knew I'm in
[2:28:02] trouble he looked at he he smelled his
[2:28:04] stinking clothes he saw his FY
[2:28:09] Rags it is such a a thing that he
[2:28:11] realized I can do nothing for myself and
[2:28:15] the Lord said to the angel take off
[2:28:18] those clothes and dress him
[2:28:20] that's how God does it when you come in
[2:28:22] front of him you must come with his
[2:28:24] righteousness clothe with his word
[2:28:26] that's all he can accept and you said
[2:28:27] there is raise your hand and say Lord
[2:28:29] take these FY garments from me and dress
[2:28:31] me with your own garments Lord your
[2:28:34] righteousness amen so Joshua was guilty
[2:28:37] as
[2:28:38] charged doesn't matter how long he's
[2:28:40] been a priest doesn't matter when he
[2:28:42] came without God's righteousness with
[2:28:44] his own righteousness he was guilty and
[2:28:46] Satan accused him but God spoke on his
[2:28:49] behalf now listen to what the prophet
[2:28:50] says in the message e the
[2:28:54] seal the prophet's thoughts on his own
[2:28:56] righteousness he says my righteous is
[2:28:59] not I'm not trusting in my
[2:29:01] own I don't have
[2:29:05] any Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 Pillar of
[2:29:10] Fire
[2:29:11] Prophet breaking of the
[2:29:14] seals mighty mighty man of Valor
[2:29:17] powerful powerful son of the Living God
[2:29:20] Vindicated prophet he says I don't have
[2:29:23] any
[2:29:24] righteousness mine is
[2:29:27] FY dirty rags now listen to this I love
[2:29:31] this he says I'll hate to try to go to
[2:29:34] heaven on my
[2:29:37] preaching so what is he saying to me he
[2:29:39] says listen I'm not depending on what I
[2:29:42] preach to go to
[2:29:43] heaven I'm not going to heaven because
[2:29:46] I'm a pastor I'm not going to heaven
[2:29:48] because I preach every SU Sunday I'm not
[2:29:50] going to heaven on
[2:29:52] that gifts and callings are without
[2:29:54] repentance you get women preachers that
[2:29:57] can preach twice as good as I can
[2:29:59] preach with gifts from God in the
[2:30:03] world because gifts and callings can
[2:30:05] fall on everybody but the prophet says a
[2:30:08] son and daughter of God a daughter of
[2:30:10] God lays down that gift to come behind
[2:30:12] the pullit She lays it down she
[2:30:13] crucifies
[2:30:14] it but gifts and callings are without
[2:30:17] repentance which means it's there
[2:30:20] so here he says I hate to go well I hate
[2:30:22] to go to heaven on my preaching I hate
[2:30:25] to try to go to heaven on my
[2:30:27] Visions even the Visions he says I don't
[2:30:30] count on them for heaven it means
[2:30:33] nothing in terms of going to heaven I'm
[2:30:35] going to heaven because I hold his grace
[2:30:38] in my heart his grace that's why I'm
[2:30:40] going that's the end and the beginning
[2:30:43] of my story I'm going to heaven because
[2:30:45] he saved me by grace and by grace alone
[2:30:49] there is no no sermon I can preach that
[2:30:51] can save
[2:30:53] me nothing there is no amount of times
[2:30:56] you can come to church that can save
[2:30:59] you you're already saved you're already
[2:31:02] saved by grace you come to church to
[2:31:05] worship Him in spirit and in truth you
[2:31:07] come to church to just sit in Heavenly
[2:31:08] places to be ignited together with other
[2:31:11] people that believe like you because
[2:31:13] remember righteousness is a
[2:31:16] person righteousness is not Deeds
[2:31:18] righteousness is Jesus Jesus Christ if
[2:31:20] you have Jesus Christ you are righteous
[2:31:23] he is the righteous one now listen to
[2:31:26] this God doesn't tell Joshua to take off
[2:31:29] his FY clothes
[2:31:32] himself doesn't chase him out and say
[2:31:35] out go wash yourself go
[2:31:39] out no he He commands the
[2:31:42] angel says take off this
[2:31:45] clothes give him my Robes of
[2:31:47] righteousness my Robes of forgiveness is
[2:31:50] just dress the man
[2:31:52] properly that's the fivefold ministry
[2:31:55] that's the holy ghost in the church
[2:31:56] again and I come to church I raised my
[2:31:58] hand and I said Lord just take the fuffy
[2:32:00] rags of me this morning and dress me
[2:32:02] with your righteousness let that gift
[2:32:04] behind the poopet Lord anoint him and
[2:32:07] dress me even if I'm the only one oh God
[2:32:10] I want to walk out of this building oh
[2:32:11] God dressed in your
[2:32:14] righteousness that's how God works
[2:32:16] that's why we come to church that's why
[2:32:18] we need a visitation that ignites
[2:32:23] us but what does Satan do he God says to
[2:32:25] the angel take off the clothes he can't
[2:32:28] even undress
[2:32:29] himself he's got nothing to do in the
[2:32:31] matter now all he need to do is stand in
[2:32:34] the presence of God that's all you need
[2:32:36] to do is just to say Lord I'm in your
[2:32:38] presence Lord do with me what you want
[2:32:40] to do oh Father God I yield myself to
[2:32:42] thee oh Father you know
[2:32:45] best
[2:32:46] amen so it's only Grace that's all that
[2:32:50] God does to him is Grace now what does
[2:32:52] Satan do and and and listen to this
[2:32:54] carefully because I want you to remember
[2:32:56] this what Satan hold Satan likes to hold
[2:32:59] you hostage with your
[2:33:02] past he holds a big gun against your
[2:33:05] head how can you talk like this
[2:33:08] you you know what you done so he ought
[2:33:11] to hostage hostage is you cannot move
[2:33:14] you cannot express yourself the way you
[2:33:16] want to because he reminds you of where
[2:33:18] you go how dare you do that
[2:33:21] but he's holding you hostage and that's
[2:33:23] why I love in this specific verse you
[2:33:26] know Satan is the accuser Satan is the
[2:33:28] accuser he continues to accuse accuse
[2:33:30] the priest before God and he continues
[2:33:33] but now the Lord steps on the
[2:33:35] scene and the Lord says I rebuke you
[2:33:40] Satan and that's what God does for every
[2:33:42] believer when you confess your sin and
[2:33:45] it's under the blood and Satan comes
[2:33:47] against you and he reminds you of your
[2:33:49] sin you have to turn to him and to say I
[2:33:52] rebuke you Satan I have been forgiven
[2:33:54] and I'm under the blood I'm set free and
[2:33:57] you are not going to hold me hostage any
[2:34:00] longer because God himself can't
[2:34:02] remember
[2:34:03] it remember Satan does not have the
[2:34:05] ability to forget what you've done only
[2:34:08] God when you confess your sins it's out
[2:34:10] of God's mind so don't let Satan hinder
[2:34:13] your worship don't let Satan hinder your
[2:34:15] expression as a true son and daughter of
[2:34:17] God don't let him hold your hostage
[2:34:20] he's got no right to do it he's a
[2:34:23] liar that's why the Lord rebuked Satan
[2:34:27] on the priest's behalf on Joshua's
[2:34:29] behalf he says Satan I rebuke
[2:34:31] you and that's why I believe the bride
[2:34:34] is standing today amen that when Satan
[2:34:36] accuses her before him he continually
[2:34:39] tell him I rebuke you Satan she's my
[2:34:41] wife she's virtuous she's sinless she's
[2:34:44] righteous she's dressed by my word she
[2:34:46] has finded my grace I rebuke you Satan
[2:34:49] that's what he continuously say to him I
[2:34:51] rebuke
[2:34:53] you so you can't save yourself by Good
[2:34:58] Works amen but we are saved by
[2:35:01] grace and by grace
[2:35:04] alone now in closing there you know the
[2:35:07] prophet is flying he's
[2:35:10] going from one place to another place
[2:35:12] and he's in a plane up high in the air
[2:35:15] and just just just just busy with what
[2:35:17] he's doing there maybe reading his Bible
[2:35:19] or just
[2:35:20] thing and as they fly across over
[2:35:23] Memphis there is a a woman with a sick
[2:35:27] child all
[2:35:29] right now this child is dying and he's
[2:35:31] no more a child he's actually a young
[2:35:33] man but to the mother he will always be
[2:35:35] a
[2:35:36] child but he picked up a
[2:35:39] disease of sinful
[2:35:42] living all right so he didn't get a
[2:35:46] disease that he had no control over he
[2:35:49] went went out he did Evil things with
[2:35:52] women and he got a disease that that
[2:35:55] that was busy killing him because of his
[2:35:58] sinful
[2:36:00] life now he's laying there he's dying
[2:36:02] he's you know he's just going he's going
[2:36:04] going and she finds the Bible she reachs
[2:36:06] and she reachs about the shunamite woman
[2:36:07] who the child died and who she prayed
[2:36:09] and Elijah came on the scene and he gave
[2:36:12] her back the life of the child and she
[2:36:14] says Lord I am here the shunamite here
[2:36:16] is my son is dying but where is Elijah
[2:36:21] now remember Satan told her it's his man
[2:36:24] he deserves to die what with the man
[2:36:27] thinking now now but God's grace
[2:36:30] oversteep all those things God didn't
[2:36:34] care what kind of a disease and how he
[2:36:36] got it that's how far the grace of God
[2:36:38] can extend God can save any sinner I
[2:36:41] don't care what you have done God is
[2:36:43] more than able to reach out there and
[2:36:46] take you and pull you and change you
[2:36:48] amen it is that's God that's my
[2:36:52] God I remember when we got saved and we
[2:36:54] walked into that little church there
[2:36:56] brother you remember and I looked at the
[2:36:58] people me and my wife sister E's hair
[2:37:01] was shorter than
[2:37:03] mine red
[2:37:05] nails you know the way we come from the
[2:37:07] world and we sat right at the back of
[2:37:09] the church and I said to we can never be
[2:37:12] like these people the women look like
[2:37:15] Angels the brothers all look like
[2:37:18] preachers I think we we're not going to
[2:37:20] make it here I think God made a mistake
[2:37:21] here we can never look like these
[2:37:25] people but guess what matter of time
[2:37:29] then you look like them you speak like
[2:37:31] them because you have received the same
[2:37:32] Holy Spirit the same father and then God
[2:37:34] starts to change you and it's all
[2:37:37] Happening by God's grace that's how we
[2:37:39] look and that's how we live by the grace
[2:37:41] of God not what we have done
[2:37:42] ourselves when we look at ourselves we
[2:37:44] know oh God I'm a failure to begin with
[2:37:48] but today when you speak somebody speaks
[2:37:50] to you and tell he tells you a bit about
[2:37:52] his life you say are you're lying you I
[2:37:55] don't believe you you can never do
[2:37:58] that that's that's the
[2:38:00] power of God taking a sinner in the
[2:38:03] deepest mud and converting him into a
[2:38:06] saint that you cannot believe his own
[2:38:08] testimony say no brother I think you are
[2:38:10] you are you are putting it on too thick
[2:38:13] just just tone it down a bit I think
[2:38:15] you're adding too much you know but the
[2:38:18] principle is clear so this shite woman
[2:38:20] the Devil comes to and says you praying
[2:38:22] for Elijah do you think Elijah will come
[2:38:24] to a boy like
[2:38:26] that do you think that God will waste
[2:38:28] his time with a man that has fallen in
[2:38:31] sin and now dying because of his sin
[2:38:34] that's
[2:38:36] hostage he keeps her hostage and she had
[2:38:39] a decision to make to say yes I'm going
[2:38:41] to believe him yeah let's just leave it
[2:38:42] you know he deserves it I feel sorry for
[2:38:45] the young man but you know actually it's
[2:38:46] his own fault yes it was his own fault
[2:38:49] fault but God don't care whose fault it
[2:38:52] was God's grace is not based upon whose
[2:38:55] fault it was cuz it's always my fault
[2:38:58] but God's grace is based upon Grace by
[2:39:01] his own choosing by his own doing and
[2:39:03] she just refused to be kept hostage she
[2:39:06] goes to the Bible she prays she says
[2:39:07] Lord I want Elijah Lord here my son is
[2:39:11] dying I don't care what he has done he
[2:39:13] stays my
[2:39:15] son and guess what all of a sudden a big
[2:39:18] storm appears yeah out of
[2:39:22] nowhere even so that the pilot need to
[2:39:24] land in
[2:39:26] Memphis and down the plane
[2:39:28] comes a small humble shunamite woman
[2:39:32] with a son who is dying of a venial
[2:39:35] disease God stops a plane with a prophet
[2:39:40] midair now they land the prophet still
[2:39:42] had no idea because God don't tell him
[2:39:45] and then he comes the next morning he
[2:39:47] says they book them into a the next
[2:39:48] morning early he goes to mail some
[2:39:50] letters and as he comes to the mailbox
[2:39:51] he puts the and as he turns around God
[2:39:53] says to him no you continue
[2:39:55] walking and he goes he says and the tar
[2:39:58] roads become dir roads the big mansions
[2:40:01] become small
[2:40:02] mansions and the small mansions become
[2:40:05] even
[2:40:05] smaller and as he comes down the street
[2:40:08] he just walks and walks and walks and
[2:40:10] there's a woman at the fence and when he
[2:40:12] comes P he says good morning
[2:40:14] Parson wet with the
[2:40:16] Dew and he says to her how did you know
[2:40:19] I was coming how did you know I'm a
[2:40:21] preacher how did you know this he says
[2:40:22] last night I prayed for you yesterday I
[2:40:25] prayed I asked the Lord where is Elijah
[2:40:27] and he said to me go and wait by the
[2:40:29] gate I'll send him to
[2:40:31] you and I came out that very early hour
[2:40:33] of the morning and I refuse to go back
[2:40:36] how many times did Satan tell her you
[2:40:38] are crazy how many times did he tell her
[2:40:41] that he's not going to do it how many
[2:40:42] times did Satan tried to confuse her and
[2:40:45] tell her give up you're
[2:40:47] crazy but she ref news he said I'm not
[2:40:50] leaving this post my God told me that he
[2:40:53] will do it for me and it's the same with
[2:40:55] you I want you to believe the Lord that
[2:40:57] he says you'll be ready he will save you
[2:40:59] he will bless you he will keep you
[2:41:01] believe him don't look at what you have
[2:41:04] done don't look at your abilities don't
[2:41:05] look at your failures let Satan go tell
[2:41:08] him he's no more going to keep your
[2:41:11] hostage I am free and I'm free
[2:41:15] indeed the blood of Jesus Christ has
[2:41:17] made me free the blood of Christ has
[2:41:20] made you free and he says I went into
[2:41:23] the house with her the man was saying
[2:41:25] it's dark in here it's dark in here and
[2:41:27] I laid my hands on him and we pray
[2:41:29] together and all of a sudden he says
[2:41:30] it's getting light in you it's getting
[2:41:32] light in you and he sat up and he says
[2:41:34] who are
[2:41:36] you and he explained to him and he
[2:41:39] left and as he walked into the airport
[2:41:42] last call for flight so and so God kept
[2:41:45] that plane for that Prophet that plane
[2:41:47] could not leave without him because he
[2:41:49] was busy with God's work and that's the
[2:41:51] way as long as you're in the line of
[2:41:53] duty brother and sister God will take
[2:41:55] care of you just stay in the word he
[2:41:58] says and many years later I met the
[2:42:00] young man on the
[2:42:01] station serving God that's the key yeah
[2:42:07] that's the key not deal you know not
[2:42:10] living in sin anymore but now he's a Son
[2:42:13] of God and he shouted oh brother Bram
