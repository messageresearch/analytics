[58:27] very valid very pertinent very much to
[58:30] the heart amen so we appreciate these
[58:32] songs that were divinely given amen from
[58:33] above I believe just to place us and to
[58:36] show who we are you may be seated for a
[58:37] little bit amen it's real good to be
[58:42] this side of the world literally uh we
[58:44] are from the other side of the world
[58:46] practically um from South Africa I was
[58:49] born in Durban not far many of you would
[58:52] know about the Durban meetings brother
[58:54] brandham had at the race at the race uh
[58:57] the horse racing Place uh graville where
[59:00] we know many many Souls came to the Lord
[59:02] and all that that one few
[59:04] incidences and um then raised a little
[59:06] bit higher up the road in a place called
[59:08] pint town and then at a pretty young age
[59:10] we moved up to Johannesburg side so we
[59:13] very much established some of you might
[59:14] know brother vly retif that has gone on
[59:17] to be with the Lord he was a real stward
[59:19] of the Gospel he established many many
[59:22] different churches up in Africa he's
[59:25] very well known and he's just was such a
[59:27] tool that the Lord used and my uh shall
[59:29] we say my my uh the base of where I was
[59:33] sort of established in the message under
[59:35] him we have so many wonderful uh
[59:37] memories and uh shall we say um uh
[59:41] building up growth underneath them and
[59:43] then about 7 years ago the Lord just led
[59:45] me to be going to another church that's
[59:47] on the other side of Johannesburg called
[59:49] ran fontain uh and they I'm under
[59:51] brother Ruben Daniels and he sends his
[59:54] greetings to to the church from his side
[59:56] amen he uh he uh was just so happy that
[59:59] we could have this privileges to come
[1:00:01] this side and we just want to make sure
[1:00:02] that we amen just give God all the honor
[1:00:05] and glory for making this possible so
[1:00:06] may the Lord just be with us this
[1:00:08] evening we just don't want to keep you
[1:00:09] too long recognizing it's a Wednesday
[1:00:11] night there's many friends family Amen
[1:00:13] brother Adrian God bless you good to see
[1:00:15] you amen he's ministered for us a couple
[1:00:18] of times and we should been and blessed
[1:00:19] by his ministry and we had some
[1:00:20] wonderful Fellowship good to see you
[1:00:22] amen so that's about it I would say let
[1:00:24] all rise to our feet at this time as we
[1:00:26] would just turn to an opening scripture
[1:00:29] here amen Romans
[1:00:35] 8 is there something I don't know
[1:00:37] [Laughter]
[1:00:40] about did he read from there well there
[1:00:42] we go we'll take that as a sign amen so
[1:00:46] I can be right at home Romans 8 amen 15-
[1:00:53] 19 amen I do we also have a presentation
[1:00:55] I'd like to speak on tonight recognize
[1:00:57] your position amen recognize your
[1:00:59] position by God's grace and we trust
[1:01:02] that the Lord will will be amongst us
[1:01:04] amen also just want to obviously
[1:01:05] acknowledge our dear Al and pillar they
[1:01:08] very close to our hearts if we've come a
[1:01:10] long way together as our brother said
[1:01:12] and and we really just appreciate also
[1:01:14] just the Friendship his ministry has
[1:01:15] also blessed us and I believe he's
[1:01:17] really being a tool in God's hands
[1:01:19] amen so readers thus and you I like to
[1:01:23] often just refer to some of the origal
[1:01:24] so as we would read along if I just sort
[1:01:26] of stop going where I am and and sort of
[1:01:28] jump back in forgive me but I like to S
[1:01:31] go into the originals of many of these
[1:01:32] things so I actually had an opening
[1:01:34] quote I was going to read but we'll come
[1:01:36] back to that now
[1:01:38] amen for you have not receive the spirit
[1:01:41] of bondage again to
[1:01:43] fear now that fear when you go into the
[1:01:46] original it's referring to Terror dread
[1:01:49] and I believe brothers and sisters we
[1:01:50] truly live in a neurotic paranoid and
[1:01:54] anti Faith age at this time amen but
[1:01:59] thank the Lord for buts in the scripture
[1:02:01] amen which is the opposite you have
[1:02:03] received the spirit of adoption and when
[1:02:05] you go to the original of that adoption
[1:02:07] it's referring to understanding who you
[1:02:09] are and coming into your correct
[1:02:12] position amen whereby we you we cry AB
[1:02:19] father why because we understand our
[1:02:21] lineage amen we understand where we come
[1:02:24] from and who is our father amen our true
[1:02:27] father is above us hallelujah the spirit
[1:02:31] is bearing witness with our spirit that
[1:02:34] we are the children of God Amen so
[1:02:37] there's a a Unity there's a correlation
[1:02:39] between his spirit and our spirit it's
[1:02:41] the deep that causes the deep and it
[1:02:43] marries together amen and if children
[1:02:47] then HS Hallelujah CU that comes with
[1:02:50] the package hes of God and Joint air
[1:02:55] with Christ amen why due to the direct
[1:02:59] lineage we inherit all that's his if so
[1:03:03] be that we suffer with them that we may
[1:03:05] also be glorified together because
[1:03:08] surely we do walk a very similar if not
[1:03:11] the exact same path he had to walk for I
[1:03:13] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:03:15] present time are not worthy to be
[1:03:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:03:18] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:03:21] expectation that is the anxious and P
[1:03:24] consistent
[1:03:25] expectation of the cre the creature
[1:03:28] which is the creation waiteth for the
[1:03:32] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[1:03:35] all of creation is waiting for you the
[1:03:38] bride Amen to realize who you are amen
[1:03:43] let's just close our eyes for word of
[1:03:44] prayer dear heavenly father we just come
[1:03:45] before you humbly Lord knowing that we
[1:03:47] can't bring much of ourselves we're just
[1:03:49] vessels for you to be used but Lord God
[1:03:52] it would be all fruitless if we just
[1:03:53] stood Lord knowing all things but
[1:03:56] without your spirit anointing it Lord so
[1:03:58] we ask that you anoint me but not only
[1:04:00] me anoint the people Lord that what can
[1:04:02] come from here will just will Quicken
[1:04:05] Lord it will bring something to life
[1:04:06] that could be dormant Lord that we may
[1:04:08] see fruits that will come from the
[1:04:10] service we ask in Jesus precious and
[1:04:12] wonderful name amen and amen God bless
[1:04:15] you you may be seated at this time I'll
[1:04:16] remove my jacket if that's okay with
[1:04:23] everyone amen so I would like to just
[1:04:25] start with the opening quote
[1:04:27] here just sort of tying up with my my
[1:04:32] title the new birth is
[1:04:35] Christ is a revelation and everyone
[1:04:38] needs a new birth Revelation it is so
[1:04:41] important it's not something you can
[1:04:43] exchange it's not something that you can
[1:04:46] figure out one to another not even a
[1:04:48] husband and wife can truly know it has
[1:04:52] to be you and God it has to be
[1:04:54] Revelation between you and him God has
[1:04:57] revealed to you this great
[1:05:00] mystery and that's a new birth now what
[1:05:04] are you going to do when you get all
[1:05:06] that group together where the Revelation
[1:05:09] is perfectly in Harmony and God
[1:05:12] expressing it through his word by the
[1:05:16] same actions the same things that he did
[1:05:20] making the word manifest oh if the the
[1:05:24] church the bride only knew its
[1:05:29] position but praise God it will one day
[1:05:33] amen and then the Rapture will go when
[1:05:36] it knows what it is amen so that's where
[1:05:39] I'm just going to pull my inspiration
[1:05:41] amen of recognizing your position
[1:05:43] because I don't know about you I'm tired
[1:05:45] of this world Amen I I know we can't
[1:05:47] push things I know God will move in his
[1:05:49] own time but I believe there's a bit of
[1:05:51] a two-fold purpose because Christ is in
[1:05:53] US amen amen so he's he's got the hook
[1:05:56] he's got us and we need to just stop
[1:05:58] fighting against the current and let us
[1:06:00] let him reel Us in amen so that we can
[1:06:02] be the vessels he wants to be to use
[1:06:05] amen that we can be the love slaves amen
[1:06:07] the prisoners that he desires in these
[1:06:10] times amen so may the Lord help us that
[1:06:13] 2024 may it be a special Year may it be
[1:06:16] a year maybe that we can just go home by
[1:06:19] his grace amen but we would have to come
[1:06:21] to the position of recognizing and
[1:06:24] knowing who we are and may the Lord help
[1:06:26] us because sometimes we have
[1:06:28] distractions amen sometimes we have
[1:06:29] things that hinder us and sometimes it's
[1:06:31] it's not obvious you know Som we live we
[1:06:34] complex beings we we try un being and
[1:06:37] and the flesh is the man that you the
[1:06:39] the the woman that you pamper in the
[1:06:41] window before you the mirror before you
[1:06:43] go out to work and you know the spirit
[1:06:45] man well he he's he's a he's a
[1:06:47] complicated one he's he's pushing both
[1:06:49] sides sometimes and and then you got The
[1:06:50] Soul Man and he's often the most quiet
[1:06:52] of them all and that that's the most
[1:06:55] important one amen so we have these
[1:06:56] these Realms we are in and as a human it
[1:06:59] can get confusing and that's often what
[1:07:02] often leads us not to inherit and to get
[1:07:04] all these great blessings that God has
[1:07:06] desired us amen so may the Lord help us
[1:07:09] may he lead us may he take us to higher
[1:07:11] Heights amen now just to move
[1:07:14] on Colossians 1:25 to 27 it says as thus
[1:07:21] now I want you to listen to the words
[1:07:22] here and this is so important cuz this
[1:07:24] ties in directly with understanding and
[1:07:26] recognizing your position wherefore I
[1:07:28] made a minister according to the
[1:07:30] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:07:32] for you to fulfill the word of God even
[1:07:36] the mystery which has been hid from ages
[1:07:40] and all from Generations so this this
[1:07:43] mystery has been head for so long
[1:07:45] brothers and sisters but there was a
[1:07:47] prophecy going forth amen that there'll
[1:07:49] become a time when this would just come
[1:07:51] forward amen and revealed in its
[1:07:53] fullness
[1:07:54] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:07:58] and our dear brother Paul amen he was
[1:08:00] inspired when he wrote this and truly
[1:08:02] they had a portion of this but the full
[1:08:06] amen Revelation the full unveiling of
[1:08:09] this is now brothers and sisters we have
[1:08:11] come to the fullness of this but now is
[1:08:14] made manifest to his Saints amen so what
[1:08:17] is this Revelation this one that's been
[1:08:19] hid through all the ages to whom God
[1:08:22] would have known what is the Riches of
[1:08:24] the glory of this mystery amongst us the
[1:08:28] Gentiles amen what is this mystery
[1:08:32] Christ in
[1:08:34] you in you this is the hope of glory
[1:08:39] amen that Christ the deity the Divinity
[1:08:42] of Christ himself would come in humanity
[1:08:46] in its fullness brothers and sisters not
[1:08:48] in part but completely amen unveil
[1:08:51] behind a human flesh amen
[1:08:54] that that you can just see when you read
[1:08:56] the sermon Christ is the mystery of God
[1:08:58] and you just look at how the prophet his
[1:09:00] main focus we're going to talk about
[1:09:03] that sort of you could say as my
[1:09:04] subtitle the second fold purpose of God
[1:09:06] but how God was so Desiring that that we
[1:09:09] would come to understand our position
[1:09:11] that we understand who we are that the
[1:09:13] bride is actually the mystery of Christ
[1:09:16] revealed amen because we've moved on
[1:09:19] brothers and sisters we we we call to
[1:09:21] something more at this age and if you
[1:09:23] want to sit there and look at yourself
[1:09:25] and look at your your own failings and
[1:09:27] your flesh brothers and sisters it will
[1:09:29] hinder you you'll never move forward
[1:09:31] with God but you're going to have to
[1:09:33] find a divine inspiration and to be able
[1:09:36] to sacrifice what you seeing and and
[1:09:38] your feelings and come under that
[1:09:40] anointing amen that he can have the
[1:09:43] preeminence over your life it can seem
[1:09:47] some unreach unreachable but amen but
[1:09:50] God by his grace in this day has made it
[1:09:53] reachable amen he's come in Simplicity
[1:09:56] amen he's come with his arms wide open
[1:09:58] in love amen he's come in the the cool
[1:10:01] of the evening he's married us we're in
[1:10:04] his tent he's pregnated us with the word
[1:10:07] man you you don't even have a choice
[1:10:09] brothers sisters does does a woman have
[1:10:12] a choice you know to control the growth
[1:10:14] of the baby absolutely not once she's
[1:10:17] pregnant that baby just grows whether
[1:10:19] the woman likes it or not she can't stop
[1:10:22] it hey and there'll be signs there'll be
[1:10:27] the belly Gro amen there'll be morning
[1:10:29] sickness spiritually speaking amen yeah
[1:10:32] you got to feel some things brothers and
[1:10:34] sisters but by God's grace the word will
[1:10:37] be manifest in its time amen and it's
[1:10:39] such a privilege it's such an
[1:10:41] opportunity we have in this day amen and
[1:10:43] it as I said it was spoken about through
[1:10:45] all the ages and now it's coming into
[1:10:48] his fullness but we need to be the
[1:10:49] vessels that God can use by his grace
[1:10:52] amen so yes God didn't call you brothers
[1:10:55] and sisters to make it by the skin of
[1:10:56] your
[1:10:58] teeth I know the Bible says that in the
[1:11:00] last days there'll be so bad that you
[1:11:02] know it'll be even hard for the elect to
[1:11:03] make it and that he might even have to
[1:11:05] shorten the days and he and he is you
[1:11:06] just see how the time is flying but but
[1:11:08] the reality is brother and sisters as we
[1:11:10] called to a higher calling did you see
[1:11:12] Christ when he was here on Earth just
[1:11:15] making it just slipping through I made
[1:11:17] it thank goodness no in control of the
[1:11:21] situation knowing his position knowing
[1:11:23] who he was amen and as Christ was was
[1:11:27] the full representative of God and flesh
[1:11:30] so we have another dispensation that has
[1:11:32] changed over and there's a
[1:11:35] bride amen there's a bride that's fully
[1:11:38] representing Christ on Earth don't don't
[1:11:42] doubt who you are brothers and sisters
[1:11:44] don't doubt your
[1:11:45] abilities it's just a matter of
[1:11:48] subjecting yourself to him and then the
[1:11:51] word can flow and you become such a an
[1:11:53] example to this generation as Christ was
[1:11:56] an example will you have to bear a cross
[1:11:58] of course you will will there be tough
[1:12:00] times
[1:12:01] absolutely if someone wants to sell you
[1:12:03] a gospel that it's nice and easy and
[1:12:05] you're just going to have a happy joy
[1:12:06] ride to heaven I'm sorry to say it's not
[1:12:08] going to happen amen but he said I'll be
[1:12:11] with you amen I'll never leave you or
[1:12:13] forsake you he said I'll never give you
[1:12:16] anything more than you can bear so
[1:12:18] whatever he's given you brothers and
[1:12:20] sisters even though it may seem dark it
[1:12:22] may seem hopeless and may seem
[1:12:24] depressing he is there and he will take
[1:12:27] you through just trust him amen he's
[1:12:30] promised that all things amen would work
[1:12:34] to your good didn't say they would be
[1:12:37] good but they'll work towards your good
[1:12:40] amen so hang in there you will be
[1:12:43] manifest at the point of time you just
[1:12:45] have to learn to trust in him amen so
[1:12:48] what are you talking brother Michael
[1:12:49] what what why isn't this just this
[1:12:51] typical Christianity you know we must
[1:12:53] just be repent and baptized amen the
[1:12:55] Holy Ghost will come upon you absolutely
[1:12:57] that's 100% gospel but we've called for
[1:13:01] one more step in this hour amen look
[1:13:03] what it said here now that's the same
[1:13:05] thing that constitutes the new birth
[1:13:07] water blood spirit the elements that
[1:13:09] came from his body is what makes his
[1:13:12] body see it come from his body uh is the
[1:13:16] material that takes to make his bride
[1:13:18] because Adam had his bride taken from
[1:13:21] his body Christ has his bride taken from
[1:13:25] the body and when Christ died there was
[1:13:28] three elements that came from his body
[1:13:30] water blood spirit justification through
[1:13:33] believing water sanctification through
[1:13:36] the blood the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:39] but it doesn't end
[1:13:41] there now this last great
[1:13:46] step this last great step must come into
[1:13:50] the
[1:13:51] Perfection that the hope Holy Spirit has
[1:13:54] to live in that church so perfectly
[1:13:57] it'll make the head and the body unite
[1:14:00] together CC that's the body he is the
[1:14:03] head in the body now we find that he
[1:14:06] promised in these last days brother and
[1:14:09] sisters where we are living that that
[1:14:12] would be
[1:14:15] done we find it whether you believe it
[1:14:19] or not brothers and sisters it's
[1:14:21] happening and it's happening around you
[1:14:23] don't you want to join the party amen
[1:14:25] and let the Lord make you a vessel that
[1:14:28] he can be used amen because the the end
[1:14:31] of the day brothers and sisters if you
[1:14:32] can't see your value if you can't see
[1:14:34] your potential you can never be used the
[1:14:37] way God wants you to be used amen but if
[1:14:39] you can just change the way you think
[1:14:42] the way you look at things the way you
[1:14:44] know the promise just for the Holy Ghost
[1:14:46] itself the promise was that you become
[1:14:48] uh Living Waters you know when Christ
[1:14:50] met that woman at the well and he says
[1:14:52] do you want to drink you know you want
[1:14:54] some Living Waters that will never
[1:14:55] you'll never thirst again that is the
[1:14:57] exact same if you go to the original
[1:14:59] that's the exact same thing that he says
[1:15:00] when they receive the holy ghost out of
[1:15:02] their belly their soul if you go in the
[1:15:04] original shall flow rivers of Living
[1:15:06] Water the exact same thing he offer that
[1:15:09] woman at the well you possess inside of
[1:15:12] you brothers and sisters you can give it
[1:15:15] salvation is of the Lord absolutely
[1:15:17] there's predestination we know that
[1:15:19] absolutely but don't you want to be a
[1:15:21] vessel that can save someone
[1:15:23] you know there's different there's
[1:15:25] different Avenues brother and sisters
[1:15:26] yes there's there's the bride in in the
[1:15:28] temple but there's possibly going to be
[1:15:31] billions outside that Temple and how can
[1:15:34] they receive life through
[1:15:37] you someone can offer you a cup of
[1:15:41] water and they weren't even part of the
[1:15:44] original thoughts of God but just
[1:15:46] because inside of you you carry a living
[1:15:48] water you give life to someone that
[1:15:51] never had a hope some people make God an
[1:15:54] un unfair God God was only obligated to
[1:15:57] his family just like everyone here I'm
[1:15:59] obligated to my kids I'll help where are
[1:16:01] can absolutely but the reality is I'm
[1:16:04] I'm obligated as the father of my
[1:16:05] household to provide for my kids and my
[1:16:07] wife am I right when you with the
[1:16:10] original people were part when you
[1:16:12] originally part of God he was
[1:16:13] technically only obligated to you but my
[1:16:16] God just extends the borders as far as
[1:16:20] possible you know there's things that we
[1:16:22] we s can't comprehend we'll you'll be
[1:16:24] surprised who's going to be given life
[1:16:26] on that day and as you standing with God
[1:16:29] Amen on on this side remember you this
[1:16:31] side you're not going to be judged the
[1:16:33] sheep and the ghats that become before
[1:16:35] God is not you you you the predestinate
[1:16:37] you going to be judging with God and
[1:16:39] those that will come before you the
[1:16:41] Bible even says the people that will be
[1:16:42] given life won't even remember they'll
[1:16:44] say when did we help when did we clothe
[1:16:47] that one when they were naked and gave
[1:16:49] them water they won't even know Glory
[1:16:52] but there you'll stand forward and
[1:16:53] you'll say man that guy helped me change
[1:16:55] my tire when I had a flat and that one
[1:16:58] helped me at work when I didn't need it
[1:17:00] and you know what that man even though
[1:17:02] he's a homosexual wrote a song that so
[1:17:04] touched me in a time of depression and
[1:17:06] lifted me
[1:17:08] up and he gave me a spiritual cup of
[1:17:12] water blessed are the merciful for they
[1:17:15] shall receive
[1:17:17] Mercy that is Broad brothers and sisters
[1:17:19] how deep how far can that go you know we
[1:17:23] with our minds can so you know limit
[1:17:27] that you know we don't understand God's
[1:17:30] depth a basic action not even involving
[1:17:33] you just someone showing Mercy to
[1:17:35] someone a kind heart you know we don't
[1:17:37] want to make it cheap but I don't know I
[1:17:39] like a god that is willing to give favor
[1:17:41] in life to as many as possible amen
[1:17:44] that's my type of God Amen so let not
[1:17:47] Liber at God and remember he's used he
[1:17:48] wanting you to be used as a vessel that
[1:17:50] can reach out that can touch that can
[1:17:53] make the difference so next time maybe
[1:17:56] we in that heated
[1:17:58] argument maybe think well how can I
[1:18:00] maybe change the situation that this
[1:18:03] person can maybe receive something maybe
[1:18:06] they're not seed not all is C to seed
[1:18:09] but some people can receive life through
[1:18:11] you the Living Waters in this day and
[1:18:15] don't forget you'll also be used as a
[1:18:17] junction as a joiner for others that
[1:18:21] have got that seed cuz God wants to use
[1:18:24] you in this time amen so the Lord help
[1:18:26] us the Lord help us to have a bigger
[1:18:27] Vision not about me and my little my
[1:18:30] little you know little bubble as such to
[1:18:34] go out of the mall when you're in the
[1:18:35] mall and you see the roughest guy from
[1:18:37] tattoos from head to toe and and looking
[1:18:39] like you you don't want to step a step
[1:18:42] in this direction he's going to murder
[1:18:43] me or something but hey these people you
[1:18:46] don't know where the possibility is you
[1:18:48] know I know it may seem extreme but I'm
[1:18:51] just giving you some examples that we
[1:18:53] can have amen so Lord help us may he
[1:18:55] help us just to understand our idea amen
[1:18:57] of what we have because truly if you if
[1:19:00] you think you're a poper spiritually
[1:19:02] speaking amen you'll stay that way you
[1:19:05] won't you won't be able to to reach out
[1:19:06] you won't be able to go further hey man
[1:19:09] I didn't see many beggars but when I was
[1:19:11] in Oakland I saw a couple Beggars but um
[1:19:14] back in South Africa we have a lot
[1:19:16] more and you can imagine a beggar you
[1:19:19] know nothing you know there's we have
[1:19:21] real real problems back there there's
[1:19:23] there's real starvation issues and
[1:19:25] malnutrition amongst the the many of the
[1:19:27] folk back there because it's a there's
[1:19:29] some serious poverty back in South
[1:19:30] Africa and um there's people that canot
[1:19:33] eat for days that's just the reality of
[1:19:35] what it is back there it's it's harsh
[1:19:36] you know it's really really bad
[1:19:38] sometimes but I mean you can imagine a
[1:19:40] I'll I'll maybe just paint it in more of
[1:19:42] a as I say from where I come from but
[1:19:44] you can imagine a bigger side of the
[1:19:46] road he's never had a meal maybe for
[1:19:48] couple days now ragged Tatty hair is a
[1:19:52] mess
[1:19:53] hopeless got nothing imagine a a black
[1:19:56] limousine pulls up in front of him out
[1:19:59] of nowhere you know guy steps out the
[1:20:01] car full tuxedo looking the part it says

[1:20:43] car you imagine the guy in that
[1:20:45] condition stinky starving feeling
[1:20:49] terrible now it's stepping into a
[1:20:51] vehicle that is you know pristine in its
[1:20:54] way how uncomfortable would he feel he
[1:20:56] wouldn't know where to sit what did I do
[1:20:59] I don't want to touch anything I just
[1:21:00] want to sit you and how that you know
[1:21:04] you know he would not even know what to
[1:21:06] say not know what to p his P his face
[1:21:08] but meanwhile without whether he
[1:21:11] realizes or not that limousine is now
[1:21:13] his the shur driving the vehicle is his
[1:21:17] shaur the two bodyguards sitting next to
[1:21:19] him is his
[1:21:21] bodyguards
[1:21:23] you know but he doesn't realize who he
[1:21:28] is and you know what maybe as time goes
[1:21:30] on maybe he gets back to the hotel and
[1:21:32] they give him a good cleanup and he's
[1:21:33] look feeling a bit you know got to shave
[1:21:35] looking the part a bit better still
[1:21:37] uncomfortable not quite knowing where
[1:21:39] gets in a private jet flies back to
[1:21:41] Europe you can just imagine this guy is
[1:21:44] out of his comfort zone man he doesn't
[1:21:46] know if he's coming or going the B guy
[1:21:50] and the reality is this is what Christ
[1:21:52] has done for us brothers and sisters
[1:21:55] spiritually speaking with nothing but a
[1:21:56] beggar and a poer but he came and he's
[1:21:59] raised us up but within our minds
[1:22:02] spiritually speaking we struggle to
[1:22:04] reach to understand the place he's
[1:22:07] caught us that at all things you hold
[1:22:10] Amen in your
[1:22:13] hands you can imagine him sort of trying
[1:22:15] to learn the ways of the English pump
[1:22:17] back there you know the now he has to
[1:22:20] mix with some high society back in
[1:22:21] Europe you know and as you know some of
[1:22:23] you may been to these fancy places you
[1:22:25] know there's about four or five you know
[1:22:26] Forks this side and another four or five
[1:22:28] knives and they all have a purpose man
[1:22:30] the guy doesn't know what to use man
[1:22:32] he's used he's used to Fe eating with
[1:22:34] his hands and now he's but he gets
[1:22:37] trained he gets trade and he starts to
[1:22:39] become comfortable in his position and
[1:22:41] when there's checks that need to be
[1:22:42] signed off we don't really use checks
[1:22:44] anymore maybe a pin on the on the on the
[1:22:45] credit card you know it's he has it he
[1:22:48] has the power and slowly but surely he
[1:22:51] starts to feel comfortable in his
[1:22:53] position and we need to get there
[1:22:55] brothers and sisters but you can't get
[1:22:57] there until you engage with what's yours
[1:23:00] and so you start turning on your mind to
[1:23:02] to say it but yes we have clouds around
[1:23:05] us we we struggle some us to see
[1:23:08] that remember this message is not a
[1:23:10] tradition brothers and sisters it's not
[1:23:11] just a way of life it's not just
[1:23:12] something we do for fun and you know my
[1:23:14] my parents brought me here and this is
[1:23:15] what you all need an individual
[1:23:17] experience you didn't know this is me
[1:23:19] you need not be bored you need to be
[1:23:20] excited you must be willing what wow
[1:23:22] what do I have what a what an incredible
[1:23:25] purpose a vision like the Bible says you
[1:23:28] don't have a vision the people perish
[1:23:31] may the Lord help us amen so just to go
[1:23:34] through you know what you you're very
[1:23:36] familiar but let's just go through this
[1:23:38] quickly notice God has a had a three has
[1:23:41] had a threefold purpose in his great
[1:23:43] mystery secret God in his great mystery
[1:23:46] secret that he had before the world
[1:23:47] begun he has got a three-fold purpose in
[1:23:50] it and now what we got what we want to
[1:23:53] go upon this morning is what is that
[1:23:56] three-fold purpose see now I Believe by
[1:23:58] the help of God who is present he'll
[1:24:00] show it to us now if we had this
[1:24:02] threefold purpose we want to find out
[1:24:04] what is this threefold purpose the first
[1:24:06] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[1:24:09] the people which is through Christ on
[1:24:11] Earth God in Christ second to have the
[1:24:14] preeminence by this in his church which
[1:24:18] is his body the bride till you could
[1:24:21] have preeminence to express himself
[1:24:24] through them and then thirdly to restore
[1:24:28] the kingdom to its rightly position that
[1:24:30] fell by sin by the first Adam back to
[1:24:32] where he walked in the cool of the
[1:24:34] evening with his people talked with them
[1:24:36] fellowship with them to think brothers
[1:24:39] and sisters there's only been three
[1:24:41] purposes with God since the creation and
[1:24:44] you are one of them you are part of it
[1:24:48] am and where are we now we're at the
[1:24:51] second fold purpose purp of God at the
[1:24:53] moment the First full purpose of God has
[1:24:55] been accomplished Christ was on Earth
[1:24:58] God had the preeminence through him
[1:25:00] where has it gone to us and like a relay
[1:25:03] at a at atletics you know the kids we do
[1:25:06] the relay race and there's the Baton
[1:25:08] amen and Christ amen has handed the
[1:25:12] Batton to his bride amen God ran with it
[1:25:16] first while he cre well through creation
[1:25:18] all those things there came a point when
[1:25:20] he handed that to Christ andrist
[1:25:22] accomplished what he needed to
[1:25:23] accomplish amen and and ascended to the
[1:25:26] right hand of God Amen with the god of
[1:25:28] the power and the the the the the
[1:25:30] authority he needed and then from there
[1:25:33] he said my bride I want you to take the
[1:25:37] Baton amen the bats and lies with you
[1:25:40] brothers and sisters it s hard to to
[1:25:43] Fathom it SS hard to figure out but that
[1:25:46] is where it is and that was in the
[1:25:47] scripture we just read the great hope of
[1:25:50] glory Christ in you
[1:25:53] that's what he's looking for that's what
[1:25:54] heaven and it's a mystery because it's
[1:25:56] in a sinful flesh so you can see the P
[1:26:00] the perfect picture where brother bams
[1:26:01] talks about and the Bible talks about
[1:26:03] all that was in God he poured into
[1:26:04] Christ and all that was in Christ he
[1:26:06] poured into his bride
[1:26:10] amen let's just read some of these
[1:26:12] they're just beautiful because the bride
[1:26:14] amen has also got a Ministry and this
[1:26:17] batter that has been passed on you
[1:26:18] brothers and sisters you need to take it
[1:26:20] up and run with it yes the church is no
[1:26:23] longer the mouthpiece of God it is its
[1:26:26] own mouthpiece this is unfortunately
[1:26:28] what has happened out there the nominal
[1:26:30] Church they've just forsaken God's word
[1:26:33] they've not they've not they're not
[1:26:35] listening not prepared to to to submit
[1:26:37] to Humble themselves to what the word
[1:26:39] says so God is turning on her and how is
[1:26:43] he turning on her he will confound her
[1:26:45] what through the prophet praise God we
[1:26:48] all appreciate the prophets amen he
[1:26:50] formed such a beautiful part
[1:26:52] but it doesn't end there brothers and
[1:26:54] sisters and the
[1:27:00] briad for the voice of God will be in
[1:27:04] her yes it is for it says in the last
[1:27:07] chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[1:27:09] spirit and the bride say come once more
[1:27:12] the world will hear direct from God as
[1:27:15] at Pentecost but of course that word
[1:27:17] bride will be reputated which is to be
[1:27:20] rejected as in the first
[1:27:25] age look at the quote at the bottom from
[1:27:27] token it has to be because a woman and
[1:27:29] her husband become one they become one
[1:27:31] and so does the bride and Christ become
[1:27:33] one the ministry of the bride and the
[1:27:36] ministry of Christ is the
[1:27:43] same like we were saying Mercy lies with
[1:27:45] you brother sisters that River of of
[1:27:47] Life sits with you what will you do with
[1:27:50] it is my question what what are we doing
[1:27:53] it how do we think about these
[1:27:55] things because it's really
[1:28:05] powerful amen let me go back
[1:28:11] y so let's explore this all that was in
[1:28:14] God he poured into Christ and all that
[1:28:16] was chist important to God so we start
[1:28:18] with God you know the perfect God
[1:28:21] logos he he created that there was
[1:28:24] something to worship by the angels we
[1:28:26] know him as Elohim self-existing one
[1:28:29] creator of heavens and earth amen I
[1:28:32] don't know about you but this God and as
[1:28:33] when you read about God in the Old
[1:28:34] Testament he in times of great Mercy he
[1:28:36] shows but sometimes as God can seem a
[1:28:38] little bit harsh of the Old Testament a
[1:28:41] little bit distant a little bit out of
[1:28:43] touch but this God by his grace came and
[1:28:47] all that was in him he went and poured
[1:28:50] into Christ now it's starting to feel a
[1:28:53] bit closer to home brothers and sisters
[1:28:54] now it's starting to feel like something
[1:28:55] I can associate with because this Christ
[1:28:58] even though it was perfect God in flesh
[1:29:01] and yes he was no he had no sin but he
[1:29:05] was tested and tried in all
[1:29:10] things all things amen let me go back
[1:29:14] all things I know but um I suffer from
[1:29:17] this bad habit and this addiction all
[1:29:20] things but they didn't have incident
[1:29:22] back then yeah of course but Spirits
[1:29:23] don't die they just start manifesting in
[1:29:26] different
[1:29:27] ways don't you think it's funny that
[1:29:29] when Nathaniel was called uh by was it
[1:29:33] Simon and he said can any good thing
[1:29:35] come out of um you know
[1:29:39] Nazareth I mean why why you know is
[1:29:42] there was there maybe something going on
[1:29:44] back back back where Jesus grew up you
[1:29:46] know we don't know the situation we
[1:29:47] don't know how bad how you know what the
[1:29:50] situation was that Jesus brought up it
[1:29:52] could have been intense incredible
[1:29:53] things that he had to deal with that we
[1:29:56] wouldn't understand so when the
[1:29:57] scripture says all things it's all
[1:30:00] things he had to and that's why he has
[1:30:03] become the perfect mediator and high
[1:30:05] priest for us cuz he understands you
[1:30:08] brothers and sisters he understands your
[1:30:10] fight your struggle what you are going
[1:30:13] through he gets it it's not strange to
[1:30:15] him and he's now become a friend and a
[1:30:18] lover to us he's our helpmate he's one
[1:30:21] that can take us through but this is
[1:30:24] where the picture gets hot and this is I
[1:30:26] believe where the where the bride in
[1:30:27] this day is struggling because all of
[1:30:30] that we were all very comfortable to
[1:30:32] talk about that but then when we go to
[1:30:34] the next step that all that was in
[1:30:35] Christ that came into the bride o
[1:30:39] goodness this one is
[1:30:43] different this one arrived in a condemn
[1:30:46] condemns flesh and sold under
[1:30:49] sin this one came into the world World
[1:30:52] speaking lies amen born and shaped in
[1:30:54] iniquity man that's where we are
[1:30:56] brothers and sisters that's where we
[1:30:58] came and on top of that we come with
[1:31:00] spiritual Amnesia we don't remember
[1:31:01] where we came from am mean we don't we
[1:31:04] we we we heard we we we Sons and
[1:31:06] Daughters of God but we should have
[1:31:09] remember and we come with all this
[1:31:11] baggage all this this this interruptions
[1:31:13] these these veils before us that needs
[1:31:16] to slowly but surely Stripped
[1:31:20] Away so this thing is a problem for us
[1:31:23] and it hinders
[1:31:29] us but thank God that he's come to make
[1:31:34] us hopefully understand a little bit
[1:31:35] more so we will now leave God and we
[1:31:39] know God is Christ but let's just move
[1:31:41] off that old shall we say dispensation
[1:31:45] and let's move into Christ and the bride
[1:31:47] because there was a similarity that had
[1:31:49] to be accomplished with Christ as what
[1:31:51] is required with us so here's Christ and
[1:31:55] the bride and what has to happen with
[1:31:58] both
[1:32:01] adoption Christ even though he arrived
[1:32:03] perfect on Earth with no sin no mistakes
[1:32:07] he had to come to his place of adoption
[1:32:10] and the same thing is required of us in
[1:32:13] this day so now we have a direct link
[1:32:16] Christ couldn't get away with this he
[1:32:18] had to come to his adoption and we have
[1:32:21] to come to our adoption same thing so
[1:32:23] now we got something that is directly
[1:32:25] correlated between us and Christ and
[1:32:28] maybe this is where we can start to see
[1:32:30] amen maybe where these things are
[1:32:33] because it can actually understand what
[1:32:34] is adoption what is it all of and I know
[1:32:37] son's adoption it can be interpreted in
[1:32:40] different ways you know brother BR comes
[1:32:41] in adoption shares he talks about
[1:32:42] finding your position in the church as a
[1:32:44] form of adoption knowing who you are but
[1:32:46] then there's another step of adoption
[1:32:48] brother Braham talks about the word
[1:32:50] being fully manifested in you you
[1:32:51] through third pool and stuff like that
[1:32:53] coming out where you can you know you
[1:32:55] can you can speak amen things that
[1:32:57] aren't there another form of adoption
[1:33:00] where the the checkbook if you sign it
[1:33:02] is as good as as God's signature on that
[1:33:04] checkbook and then there's which you
[1:33:06] could call the ultimate adoption which
[1:33:08] reveals if you adopted or not is is the
[1:33:09] going of the Rapture so there's almost
[1:33:11] like a three-fold you know uh three-fold
[1:33:15] uh shall we say unveiling of
[1:33:20] adoption now adoption and and this
[1:33:23] Perfection that we we we talk about it
[1:33:26] it it has to be something we understand
[1:33:27] clearly because this is where we sudden
[1:33:29] getting very confused so adoption coming
[1:33:32] to the completion maturity and end goal
[1:33:36] now notice what I've written here not
[1:33:38] Perfection of the
[1:33:40] flesh as Christ was born perfect but
[1:33:44] still required adoption remember when
[1:33:47] Christ came on Earth he was born perfect
[1:33:49] as a babe if if if he if if Perfection
[1:33:54] that you do nothing wrong in this flesh
[1:33:55] was the requirement that you are
[1:33:58] thinking in your mind that you do
[1:33:59] nothing wrong well then the second
[1:34:00] Christ was born he should have been
[1:34:02] adopted but he wasn't only towards the
[1:34:04] end of his ministry in his 30s does he
[1:34:07] receive his adoption when he goes on
[1:34:09] Mount
[1:34:10] Transfiguration so you need to
[1:34:12] understand what this is what when the
[1:34:14] Bible talks about coming to your
[1:34:16] Perfection the adoption whatever it is
[1:34:18] you need to make sure you place it
[1:34:20] because if you focus on me doing nothing
[1:34:22] wrong and me always in control and and
[1:34:25] and you know I just got it all together
[1:34:27] and I never seem to slip up you you you
[1:34:29] focus on the wrong thing you will never
[1:34:30] get there that's
[1:34:34] right what is adoption it's getting the
[1:34:36] victory of character remember you have
[1:34:38] to rule and reign with him but he cannot
[1:34:40] let you rule and reign with him until
[1:34:42] you get character cuz character am man
[1:34:45] if you want to rule without character
[1:34:46] that's going to be just satanic you're
[1:34:48] going to abuse that but if the spirit of
[1:34:50] Christ amen you you will have
[1:34:51] forgiveness you'll have love you have
[1:34:53] compassion that is the spirit he's
[1:34:55] trying to get out of you and he's only
[1:34:56] going to get that through things you're
[1:34:57] going to go through and the maturity to
[1:34:59] handle the spoken word where your
[1:35:01] signature is as good as his in the
[1:35:03] checkboard third pull fruit amen now
[1:35:06] that third pull fruit is something we
[1:35:07] need to always remember we hear all
[1:35:09] these things that are coming those that
[1:35:10] are well versed know what I'm saying you
[1:35:12] hear about you know giving the your your
[1:35:14] farmer the the rain and and speaking
[1:35:16] things and and whatever else and I mean
[1:35:18] sort of thing that is the third pull
[1:35:20] well just hang on a second that's the
[1:35:22] fruits of the third pool the third pool
[1:35:25] is laying inside of you brothers and
[1:35:26] sisters if you got that word that word
[1:35:28] God himself in you it's laying there the
[1:35:31] seeds are there and at the appointed
[1:35:33] time God will use it he just wants you
[1:35:35] to be ready when the time is right you
[1:35:38] don't have to force it the the fruit
[1:35:40] will come out Amen in its way and how it
[1:35:44] should
[1:35:45] be so may the Lord help us to focus on
[1:35:48] the right thing let's just see some
[1:35:50] scriptures had so beautiful when you
[1:35:51] look at it though he were a son so yes
[1:35:54] though he were a son though we are Sons
[1:35:56] and Daughters of God yet learned he
[1:35:58] obedience by what the things which he
[1:36:00] suffered and that's why I said brothers
[1:36:02] and sisters we have no choice as
[1:36:03] Christians to know we will have to
[1:36:05] suffer but there's a purpose amen it's
[1:36:07] not just for fun is a
[1:36:10] purpose and what being made
[1:36:15] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:36:18] salvation unto them that obey him us
[1:36:22] that follow can have the same amen being
[1:36:25] made perfect for it became him for whom
[1:36:28] are all things about whom are um for
[1:36:32] whom are all things and by whom are all
[1:36:34] things in bringing many sons unto glory
[1:36:38] to make the make the captain of their
[1:36:40] salvation perfect through sufferings for
[1:36:44] both he that sanctifieth and they that
[1:36:47] are Sanctified are all one we the same
[1:36:51] category brother and sisters for which
[1:36:53] cause he is not ashamed to call you
[1:36:56] Brethren brothers and sisters bride of
[1:36:58] Christ amen so you have to understand
[1:37:00] brothers and sisters you will always
[1:37:01] have a sticky nature you will have
[1:37:03] thorns in the flesh you're not going to
[1:37:05] get rid of you know that can hit you
[1:37:07] sometimes it's hard it can it can blind
[1:37:10] you because you're so determined that I
[1:37:12] must form this perfect picture but it's
[1:37:15] not like that you have to look beyond
[1:37:18] that amen the prophet l some beautiful
[1:37:21] things here we would we would known it
[1:37:23] today is the law of conscious and where
[1:37:24] there is good there is evil where
[1:37:26] there's right there is wrong and we will
[1:37:29] never no matter what our environment may
[1:37:31] be ever be able to shake ourself from
[1:37:34] the presence of either because Paul said
[1:37:36] when I would do good evil is present
[1:37:40] amen so we're never going to get away
[1:37:41] from that and you can see Paul in Romans
[1:37:44] 7 getting so frustrated when I do good
[1:37:46] do EV I want to do this and then this
[1:37:48] happens you can see it builds up and
[1:37:50] builds up and eventually is like oh
[1:37:51] Wretched Man that I am who can deliver
[1:37:54] me from this flesh man he's frustrated
[1:37:58] as we get
[1:37:59] frustrated but then he answers it in
[1:38:01] pretty much the next verse but I thank
[1:38:03] God through Jesus Christ there's an
[1:38:05] answer laying right there we need to get
[1:38:07] ourselves out of the way amen and let
[1:38:10] him amen take over us I love pictures
[1:38:14] that I think brother Randon paints such
[1:38:15] a beautiful picture here how can I take
[1:38:18] a cockabur and make a grain of wheat out
[1:38:21] of it it's impossible for me to do it
[1:38:24] the only way it can be is because inside
[1:38:27] that Cocker has been transmitted from a
[1:38:29] cockabur to a germ called wheat
[1:38:32] life then you bury that cockabur and
[1:38:35] it'll produce a grain of wheat that's
[1:38:38] right see because there has been a life
[1:38:40] of wheat put in the cckar and the life
[1:38:44] of the cockabur has been taken out but
[1:38:46] the nature of the cockabur is sticky
[1:38:51] oh I don't want to hear this well you're
[1:38:53] hearing it sorry to say and it will be
[1:38:57] until this new life has fully been
[1:39:00] developed out of the ground and raised
[1:39:02] up again when it comes forth there is no
[1:39:05] more cockabur but wheat but while it's
[1:39:08] here on
[1:39:12] Earth amen out of the earth and a Cocker
[1:39:15] it's still sticky but it's got the
[1:39:17] nature of on the inside of it of Wheat
[1:39:20] and as long as you're in this life
[1:39:23] you're going to be sticky and have a
[1:39:26] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:39:28] as long as you
[1:39:33] live but the inside of you and that's
[1:39:36] where you need to
[1:39:37] focus you're born again amen and you're
[1:39:41] raised up you're in the likeness of
[1:39:43] Christ and
[1:39:46] all your sin has gone from you amen
[1:39:51] isn't that
[1:39:53] beautiful amen so you're going to have a
[1:39:55] cockabur and yes our job is to get rid
[1:39:57] of as many of those cockabur leaves as
[1:39:59] we possibly can while you're on Earth
[1:40:01] amen and we need God's help but you'll
[1:40:03] still have a portion of cockabur even if
[1:40:05] you get a rid of 99% of it until that
[1:40:08] Rapture goes you'll have a bit of
[1:40:10] cockabur on you so don't worry about it
[1:40:12] don't worry about your little mistakes
[1:40:14] he's looking for your reaction to the
[1:40:16] mistake not so much the mistake what is
[1:40:20] the re action is it excuses oh I had a
[1:40:24] right or is it Lord forgive me I didn't
[1:40:28] mean that I'm sorry oh that's my child
[1:40:32] and maybe five minutes later he does the
[1:40:34] same thing but his attitude's right Lord
[1:40:36] I'm so sorry I'm just trying forgive me
[1:40:38] that's my child this is my
[1:40:41] boy you see it's not about how perfect
[1:40:45] you can be but it's about making sure
[1:40:48] you just have the right spirit and
[1:40:49] attitude when you do make mistakes and
[1:40:52] then he can help you now I know brother
[1:40:54] bam at one stage alludes to what uh uh
[1:40:57] Paul's Thorn In the Flesh was and it was
[1:41:00] that his eyes he was struggling with his
[1:41:03] eyes now this is fascinating when you
[1:41:05] see this because if you understand this
[1:41:07] whole situation you can maybe get an
[1:41:09] idea of how hard it is sometimes to
[1:41:12] accept your Thorn In the Flesh to
[1:41:14] understand how hard it is to accept this
[1:41:16] this flesh part that you veiled
[1:41:18] in cuz Paul lays it out real
[1:41:21] good unless I should be exalted above
[1:41:25] measure and that's why God will leave
[1:41:28] thorns in your flesh and let you have a
[1:41:29] bit of cockabur cuz he knows your human
[1:41:31] nature is going to turn on you real
[1:41:33] quick because it's just we are like that
[1:41:36] unfortunately as much as we don't want
[1:41:37] to be we find ourselves very quickly get
[1:41:40] puffed up and we have to be get back
[1:41:43] down get on your knees that's where you
[1:41:46] belong through the abundance of
[1:41:49] Revelations CU sure brother Paul had had
[1:41:51] amazing Revelations I mean he wrote most
[1:41:52] wrote most of the New Testament but the
[1:41:54] Paul was an incredible amen prophet of
[1:41:57] that age there was given to me a thorn
[1:42:00] of the In the
[1:42:03] Flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[1:42:06] me now that Buffet you got in the
[1:42:08] original man it's not just
[1:42:11] like it's strike with the fist mild
[1:42:15] treat treat with violence that's what
[1:42:19] that that buff it means it's not nice
[1:42:22] it's not easy the devil throws you
[1:42:25] around like a ragd doll
[1:42:27] sometimes because you can imagine
[1:42:30] Paul Lord you know I'm your messenger
[1:42:33] right yes brother Paul You're My
[1:42:36] Messenger but Lord I'm I'm really
[1:42:38] struggling I'm trying to write letters
[1:42:40] to the different churches I'm struggling
[1:42:42] to see I keep having to I'm writing over
[1:42:44] my letters and I'm having to keep
[1:42:46] correcting it's just a mess I feel sorry
[1:42:48] for the churches having to receive my
[1:42:49] letters please can you take it away for
[1:42:52] your honor and Glory I'm doing this for
[1:42:54] you um
[1:42:59] no
[1:43:00] Lord I mean they I had to rewrite this
[1:43:05] page five times yesterday get I'm really
[1:43:07] struggling to see I I can't figure
[1:43:10] things out and I'm feeling the bubble in
[1:43:11] my heart but I can't get it down on
[1:43:13] paper quick enough please can you just
[1:43:15] heal my eyes it's for your honor and
[1:43:18] glory Lord I'm doing it for you a
[1:43:20] service to you
[1:43:23] no and again the says he asked him three
[1:43:28] times
[1:43:29] no but Lord no that's hard brothers and
[1:43:33] sisters when you're doing something for
[1:43:35] God and he says no I'll leave that
[1:43:37] infirmity I'll leave that thorn upon you
[1:43:40] that's difficult brothers and sisters
[1:43:42] but he's looking for character what is
[1:43:44] your reaction when you don't get it what
[1:43:47] are you going to do about it Lord even
[1:43:49] though I will trust you am but look at
[1:43:50] Paul's attitude I love this amen and
[1:43:53] this if you to take this to a School of
[1:43:55] Psychology they'll say man this guy's
[1:43:57] he's he I don't know if he's even
[1:43:59] medication to help this guy he's too far
[1:44:00] over the edge amen but look what he says
[1:44:02] here it's incredible because he can see
[1:44:05] what what the Lord was trying to show
[1:44:06] him so yes Buffett he's been hit by
[1:44:09] Satan violently lest I should be exalted
[1:44:13] above measure so he understands his
[1:44:15] nature even though he's a great prophet
[1:44:18] he realizes hey I've got a problem you
[1:44:19] have God you know God lets everything
[1:44:21] come my way for this thing I besought
[1:44:24] the Lord Thrice three times that it
[1:44:26] might depart from me and he said unto me
[1:44:28] my grace is sufficient for thee why for
[1:44:32] my strength is made perfect in
[1:44:37] weakness most gladly therefore I rather
[1:44:40] Glory man this is where PA you going way
[1:44:43] out of the norm I rather glory in my
[1:44:46] infirmities that infirmities is a lack
[1:44:49] of strength weakness sickness both
[1:44:53] spiritually and in the physical body but
[1:44:56] Lord I I believe in my healing I've been
[1:44:59] praying for my healing for 10 years it's
[1:45:02] your word Lord I believe your word what
[1:45:05] if he says no what are you going to say
[1:45:07] are you going to keep the right spirit
[1:45:09] and still believe that he's still the
[1:45:11] Healer amen that is difficult brothers
[1:45:13] and sisters but he's as I said we call
[1:45:16] to a higher place in this time it's no
[1:45:19] longer just average Christian Living and
[1:45:21] just getting through life it's about
[1:45:23] taking possession of who you are and
[1:45:25] understanding and understanding is
[1:45:26] trying to get a character out of you
[1:45:28] that irrespective of your circumstances
[1:45:30] that you say your word is true whether I
[1:45:32] receive it or not it's
[1:45:37] truth that the power of Christ May rest
[1:45:40] upon me therefore I will pleasure in
[1:45:43] infirmities in reproaches and
[1:45:46] necessities and persecutions and
[1:45:48] distresses for Christ's sake sake for
[1:45:51] when I am weak then I am strong because
[1:45:55] if you can just realize that if you can
[1:45:58] just get out the way brothers and
[1:45:59] sisters God can use you so
[1:46:02] mightily all the examples through the
[1:46:05] scripture yay look at Moses man comes
[1:46:07] out 40 years old man this guy has got it
[1:46:09] together he's trained up in the Army he
[1:46:12] has it all together to get the
[1:46:14] Israelites out of there out of Egypt but
[1:46:16] God says nope can't use this guy let's
[1:46:20] send him to the back side of the desert
[1:46:22] oh and he's got a temper so let me just
[1:46:24] give him a wife while I'm at it that's
[1:46:25] got a maybe a worse temper than
[1:46:28] him and things weren't so Rosy on the
[1:46:31] back side of the
[1:46:33] desert amen you can imagine for Moses at
[1:46:38] times amen but yeah the fact is that God
[1:46:43] wanted to get a character out of Moses
[1:46:45] that eventually said Lord I can't even
[1:46:49] speak this wife you gave me
[1:46:52] she's I don't have words anymore I'm I'm
[1:46:55] done I'm done oh wow I could use you
[1:46:58] Moses good job hey good job sapora you
[1:47:01] did what I needed now I can use this man
[1:47:04] and God will do the same but the brah
[1:47:07] shows a place he says you know we start
[1:47:08] say oh this woman this wife well maybe
[1:47:11] that woman that wife is exactly what God
[1:47:13] gave you to keep you humble and on your
[1:47:16] knees and vice versa so yeah you might
[1:47:19] think uh you know you're going to get
[1:47:20] the right one on the other side but the
[1:47:22] right one is sitting right next to
[1:47:28] you so yes let us let us let us just say
[1:47:32] Lord hey let me be used of you amen for
[1:47:36] when I'm weak then I am strong then I
[1:47:38] can be used of you because this little
[1:47:41] mind so quickly gets high and up there
[1:47:43] it's just so quick it happens man and
[1:47:46] you find yourself in places you could
[1:47:47] just never thought you could get so
[1:47:49] quickly but but we need to focus on the
[1:47:51] Lord amen and get our things around away
[1:47:53] from us you know the current picture of
[1:47:56] the Bride is so
[1:47:59] beautifully paralleled with Esther do
[1:48:02] you know the the some of the first
[1:48:03] Messengers they they even thought Esther
[1:48:05] should even be in the Bible because it
[1:48:06] doesn't even talk hardly about God
[1:48:08] doesn't even talk about God doesn't
[1:48:09] mention it it's just like a story yeah
[1:48:11] but then you go into the original and
[1:48:13] you see man this was prophetic this was
[1:48:17] what the bride would be going
[1:48:19] through think about it Esther is born in
[1:48:21] a foreign land are we in a foreign land
[1:48:24] brothers and sisters of course we are we
[1:48:25] just so jous she's a nothing and a
[1:48:27] nobody she doesn't have parents she's
[1:48:29] living with her
[1:48:32] cousin suddenly this person like the
[1:48:35] beggar is shot up to a possible
[1:48:37] candidate for the queen out of nowhere
[1:48:41] not long after that she is the queen
[1:48:46] crowned
[1:48:48] wow but as much as I'm sure Esther was
[1:48:51] sort of starting to realize she had
[1:48:53] power because she can call servants and
[1:48:54] they can do this you know what I see
[1:48:56] something there with Esther that she
[1:48:58] still doesn't understand who she is
[1:49:01] definitely not because when the crisis
[1:49:04] comes that she hears that her people are
[1:49:05] possibly going to become extinct and
[1:49:07] wiped out she gets
[1:49:10] fearful she's please let's call her fast
[1:49:13] pray three days we need a consecrate I
[1:49:17] I'm going to most probably
[1:49:19] die and he has Esther walking in the
[1:49:22] presence of the King after 3 days just
[1:49:25] praying and
[1:49:26] begging just to
[1:49:28] say Esther I will not kill you or
[1:49:31] something to that effect imagine this
[1:49:33] the shock when she hears Esther my
[1:49:36] beloved King what do you want up to half
[1:49:39] my
[1:49:42] kingdom did I hear right yeah up to half
[1:49:46] my kingdom me I just was hoping I would
[1:49:49] survive
[1:49:50] and that's the reality sometimes you
[1:49:53] know we caught to queenship brothers
[1:49:55] sisters but yet we just try to survive
[1:50:00] sometimes and then I can't help but
[1:50:02] Wonder yeah we we know that there was a
[1:50:04] reason but when she calls the king to
[1:50:05] the the feast and she you know I wonder
[1:50:08] did she lose did she just she did she
[1:50:11] she what did they say you lost you lost
[1:50:13] guts or what is the word I'm looking for
[1:50:15] but you sort of you lose your composure
[1:50:17] whatever it is that she she couldn't
[1:50:19] actually address it at first that she
[1:50:21] says uh can you please come rather
[1:50:23] tomorrow night and and you wonder why
[1:50:25] Esther yes we knew there's a purpose and
[1:50:27] the King had to the scroll that night
[1:50:29] and you know we know how what played out
[1:50:30] but the fact of the matter is from
[1:50:31] Esther's perspective why did you not
[1:50:34] just there and then address it why did
[1:50:35] you have to say Lord can you come again
[1:50:38] tomorrow night I want like another Feast
[1:50:40] maybe just Esther doesn't know who she
[1:50:44] is she doesn't know her position does it
[1:50:47] sound familiar hey it sounds familiar to
[1:50:49] me yeah because when I see myself
[1:50:51] sometimes I don't quite get how much God
[1:50:54] loves me how much he's given to me how
[1:50:56] I'm joint a Ester bride up to half my
[1:51:00] kingdom joint a with
[1:51:02] me we're going to March back through to
[1:51:05] eternity together
[1:51:08] Esther then you know what happened
[1:51:10] that's so beautiful brothers and sisters
[1:51:11] you know what we doubt the power we hold
[1:51:15] within us because you know what happened
[1:51:17] when Esther reveals the situation the
[1:51:19] King was what does he do he gives his
[1:51:21] Signet his ring that bears his Mark and
[1:51:24] says yeaha do with it as you want and
[1:51:28] Esther herself not the king Esther
[1:51:31] herself defeated the enemy cuz she had
[1:51:35] the power now of the king in Earth amen
[1:51:38] and the same brothers and sisters with
[1:51:39] us the power lies within you you can get
[1:51:43] over that bad habit you can destroy that
[1:51:46] enemy in your life amen he's given you
[1:51:49] the power you just have to be humble and
[1:51:51] subject yourself to him
[1:51:54] amen hallelujah I'm closing off
[1:51:57] you let's trust the process
[1:52:02] amen look at how high the stakes are
[1:52:05] brother and sisters in this quote but
[1:52:07] all this mystery is revealed only as he
[1:52:11] promised to his bride you are the
[1:52:14] special
[1:52:15] lady how this is what I want you to
[1:52:18] understand oh sorry
[1:52:21] Hull is against this
[1:52:27] truth I think you need to let that sink

[1:52:33] sure you don't understand who you
[1:52:36] are remember the stakes are high

[1:53:13] second-fastest is are raging hold fast I
[1:53:17] am his and he'll be made manifest
[1:53:20] through me that's her stand but listen
[1:53:23] this is where we have to be sober minded
[1:53:25] brothers and sisters cuz look what the
[1:53:26] prophet says here why do you hunger

[1:55:12] yourself in the presence unless you get
[1:55:14] in the presence of God you'll never hear
[1:55:17] him say Esther up to half my my kingdom
[1:55:20] is
[1:55:21] yours Esther had to first get in the
[1:55:23] presence of the king before she could
[1:55:25] hear and he could speak to her and tell
[1:55:28] her value back to her you're going to
[1:55:31] have to do it and you're going to have
[1:55:33] to just find the time sacrifice if you
[1:55:36] have to of course we still humans we
[1:55:38] still have to live through life we still
[1:55:39] have to have enjoyments we're not
[1:55:40] stopping that stuff but be fair to God
[1:55:43] also give him some time amen make sure
[1:55:46] you consecrate certain things to him
[1:55:50] don't put like the the prophet says you
[1:55:52] the cares of the world your family other
[1:55:54] things don't let it get blind and it's
[1:55:56] you and God forget about the rest I'm
[1:55:59] going to end with this scripture and we
[1:56:02] done I love the scripture I absolutely
[1:56:05] love it because this is actually what is
[1:56:08] happening look what the words is yeah
[1:56:10] it's beautiful but we are with an open
[1:56:13] faced unveiled amen if you can just see
[1:56:18] what he is seeing so you are the bride
[1:56:20] amen and what are you doing you beh
[1:56:22] holding as in a glass if you go to the
[1:56:23] original that's not a glass you can see
[1:56:25] through it's a mirror that reflects back
[1:56:27] so you are the bride amen and you're
[1:56:30] looking into a mirror imagine this think
[1:56:32] spiritually now you're looking into a
[1:56:33] mirror what is coming back at that
[1:56:36] mirror what are you seeing back in that
[1:56:38] mirror that's reflecting it is the glory
[1:56:41] of the
[1:56:43] Lord you don't see that you don't feel
[1:56:46] that but if you could have a spiritual
[1:56:48] window a mirror this evening and be able
[1:56:50] to see into it you would see God shining
[1:56:53] back at
[1:56:55] you all changed this is where we are at
[1:56:58] the moment cuz this is a process you're
[1:57:00] changed you're being
[1:57:02] transformed into the same image what you
[1:57:05] seeing in that mirror you are being
[1:57:07] changed in the same image from glory to
[1:57:10] glory even by the spirit of the
[1:57:15] Lord if you want to be changed from
[1:57:17] glory to glory you're going to have have
[1:57:19] to look in the
[1:57:21] mirror and this mirror amen is is one
[1:57:25] that is always going to help you to
[1:57:26] understand who you are amen we need to
[1:57:29] start becoming maybe a little bit more
[1:57:31] disciplined and as I say it's not about
[1:57:33] legalism it's about a love relationship
[1:57:36] and if you can just fall in love with
[1:57:37] him naturally something is going to want
[1:57:40] you to get into his presence because
[1:57:43] when you in your his presence you'll see
[1:57:46] God reflected back at you amen may the
[1:57:49] Lord help us all we all are struggling
[1:57:52] the minister behind this desk the pastor
[1:57:55] sitting in the Pew is also struggling we
[1:57:58] have our doubts we have our times where
[1:58:00] we just we we question as as Paul
[1:58:03] question Lord why can't you but if we
[1:58:06] can just see the bigger picture that the
[1:58:08] Lord is trying to get a character out of
[1:58:10] you he's trying to get you to the place
[1:58:12] where you know who you are that you know
[1:58:15] your position and then we're out of here
[1:58:18] brothers and sisters hey I want to get
[1:58:20] out of here brothers sisters this world
[1:58:22] is not my home amen and the more I'm in
[1:58:24] it the more it just doesn't feel
[1:58:25] comfortable may the Lord help us all at
[1:58:27] this time is our prayer amen you may be
[1:58:29] may just bow your heads amen at this
[1:58:32] time amen I believe this is opportunity
[1:58:35] just to be real honest with the Lord
[1:58:37] amen this is not the time to for the
[1:58:40] these and the THS where God is far away
[1:58:42] he's become a friend he's become a lover
[1:58:45] he's part of you you can speak to him
[1:58:47] literally like your best best friend as
[1:58:49] Frank as you want as honest as you want
[1:58:52] don't you want to just be honest with
[1:58:53] the Lord tonight and say Lord you know

[1:59:04] Lord I I just don't seem to know how to
[1:59:06] run with it I don't seem to know how to
[1:59:07] handle it I seem like I'm dropping it
[1:59:10] Lord may you help me to have your spirit
[1:59:13] that can lead me and that be able to do
[1:59:16] what you've called me to do at this time
[1:59:19] to become a love slave to become
[1:59:22] completely a prisoner to you Lord let's
[1:59:25] pray together you just pray to him in
[1:59:27] your own simp in your own simple way

[1:59:50] standard against what the enemy can

[1:59:55] shadow of a doubt that Lord you would
[1:59:57] said you would never leave us or forsake
[1:59:59] us that you would never give us more
[2:00:00] than we could bear and that you would
[2:00:02] definitely take us through to the end

[2:00:24] through our trying of our faith but Lord
[2:00:26] God we see the bigger picture that a bit
[2:00:28] of bit of trying this side is nothing
