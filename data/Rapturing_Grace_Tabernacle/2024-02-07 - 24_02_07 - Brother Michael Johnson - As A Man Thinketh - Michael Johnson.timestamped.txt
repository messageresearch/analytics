[47:23] let me just get my bearings together
[47:25] praise the Lord but we had a wonderful
[47:27] Camp uh a a exceptionally special
[47:32] special time the Lord was so gracious to
[47:35] us and and by God's grace um and and I
[47:38] want to say thank you for your praise I
[47:41] know that many have been praying we've
[47:43] been praying over the last few months
[47:44] and asking the Lord to come on the scene
[47:47] and really there was not a single issue
[47:49] that that stands out that was a major
[47:52] issue um by God's grace everything went
[47:55] well that the atmosphere was lovely the
[47:57] the preaching was was wonderful God kept
[48:00] his hand over us in so many ways you
[48:02] know even down to on the Saturday we it
[48:05] the weather was
[48:06] terrible but we didn't need good weather
[48:09] because we had we had um activities that
[48:12] we were doing indoors and then when it
[48:14] came to the outdoors activities and and
[48:17] the the swimming and water sliding and
[48:20] all of that stuff it was scorching hot
[48:23] so the Lord had his hand in everything
[48:25] we just thank the Lord for it and just
[48:27] just I want to say an exceptionally
[48:30] special time so I have a thankful heart
[48:34] um to the Lord and just really really
[48:37] thankful for answered
[48:39] prayer so we've had a few services with
[48:42] with Michael now last Wednesday you had
[48:45] the privilege and I'm I believe a few of
[48:47] you have been streaming over the weekend
[48:49] we've um we've had I think Saturday's
[48:52] service um nearly 420 or so so streams
[48:56] which is unusual for for our church um
[49:00] obviously we made those those um
[49:02] Services
[49:03] Public um and for all the other services
[49:07] also hundreds of people um streaming and
[49:10] I and I trust that it was a blessing and
[49:12] I also trust that people received
[49:15] everything that was said in context and
[49:17] the Lord was just really good to us in
[49:20] just so many
[49:22] ways um so tonight is goodbye to Michael
[49:25] um we'll have toita and the kids here
[49:28] still on Sunday but um God willing he's
[49:31] flying up to brother Tony's on Saturday
[49:33] to minister there and then from there
[49:36] he'll be heading out um by next week so
[49:41] uh tonight we we want to drag everything
[49:44] out of him he's nice and tired so just
[49:45] keep on sucking him
[49:48] dry amen pulling praise the Lord we're
[49:52] just looking forward to that I just
[49:53] thought I would give you uh a little bit
[49:56] of a feel for how Camp went um just by
[50:00] sharing just not I'm not going to take a
[50:02] long time but just four or five pictures
[50:04] that I want to just put up here so let's
[50:08] see if that works praise the Lord so
[50:10] there's the the camp group um I think
[50:15] this this includes most people so in the
[50:17] end we our numbers were just right it
[50:20] was just comfortable it was um it was
[50:23] you know enough people to make it
[50:26] to make it special but not so many that
[50:28] that we couldn't have contact with
[50:30] everyone so there was just a lovely
[50:31] atmosphere and I'll just put this one up
[50:34] just to emphasize the
[50:37] backdrop we could we could actually sit
[50:40] inside the church Hall and watch over
[50:42] that bay there and um by God's grace it
[50:45] wasn't a distraction from the
[50:47] services but just a wonderful wonderful
[50:50] atmosphere there lovely time um there's
[50:54] a picture of Michael
[50:57] ministering and the
[51:00] other the other Youth Camp Minister
[51:02] brother T was gracious to to fulfill
[51:05] that role at short notice so we just
[51:08] thank him for that there's a picture in
[51:11] case you think this looks a little
[51:13] strange we doing Father
[51:16] Abraham so this I think would be the
[51:18] chin up looking at everyone
[51:22] there um so then um we had
[51:25] this is the the gym Hall where the
[51:28] activities took place and so on so I
[51:31] just thought I would put a picture of
[51:32] that up and I deliberately put my Camp
[51:36] vest on here we identified all the
[51:38] counselors and and advisers with vests
[51:42] like this and it really really worked
[51:43] well because from a distance you knew
[51:45] exactly who was who and so on so that
[51:48] was that was really good and then lastly
[51:50] on the and I hope this is going to work
[51:52] um this little video will work but on
[51:54] the last morning I got an
[52:00] inspiration and I realized because okay
[52:03] so let me tell you the back story I had
[52:06] um you know started to to um you know
[52:09] just put things in place so that we we
[52:11] be able to pack up easily and so on so I
[52:14] had carried one of those polene
[52:16] containers along and drummed on it and I
[52:18] realized this is a really good
[52:21] drum so so then during during the um
[52:25] the we just had a singing and testimony
[52:27] service that last morning I S them grab
[52:30] all the poling containers and then we
[52:32] had a whole bunch of drummers in the uh
[52:35] in the group so this is what it looked
[52:37] like hopefully this
[52:54] works
[52:59] had a lot of
[53:01] fun praise the Lord anyway so thank you
[53:04] thank you very much for everyone's love
[53:07] and support over the last few weeks and
[53:10] so on it's um we obviously came back
[53:13] really tired shame as I I'm going to
[53:16] give away a secret but as we were
[53:18] driving out of thei I saw Joseph scar
[53:21] parked next to the road and having a
[53:24] sleep and I think there was a few of us
[53:26] that was Keen to do that but um by God's
[53:29] grace it's uh it's been so just worth
[53:32] the
[53:33] while we also have another goodbye
[53:35] tonight Grace is I think this is your
[53:37] last service here now Grace she's from
[53:40] Brother Barry coffe Church all the way
[53:41] from the us so we also want to say God
[53:44] bless you was lovely to have you please
[53:47] take our love to brother Barry and the
[53:48] Saints there and we're looking forward
[53:51] to see you again

[56:05] time you know the youth were so
[56:08] openhearted they it just really was a
[56:10] privilege and honor to preach to them

[56:18] really special and I've made so many
[56:20] friends now you know I'm looking over

[56:25] memories will linger forever just such a
[56:27] great team and I think uh LED so well by

[56:33] church really came through because you
[56:35] could just see there was just such a
[56:36] desire for Unity and to to look out for
[56:39] each other and you know to Bear each
[56:41] other's burdens where it was necessary
[56:43] and there was just a beautiful spirit of
[56:44] Harmony and just it went so well so we
[56:47] just want to really say thank the Lord I
[56:50] really feel he came through in a mighty
[56:51] way and as our brother Al said or Al I
[56:54] know he doesn't like to be called
[56:55] brother um you know I believe it's the
[56:57] prayers of the saints that really made
[56:59] the difference and thank you all for
[57:01] that and it's been a privileged to know
[57:03] you I'm feeling so much more just
[57:04] relaxed now because uh you know half of
[57:07] the people you are now become friends
[57:08] and you know it's just um the Lord has
[57:12] just got a beautiful family of God and
[57:13] it it spread it spreads through the
[57:15] whole world and it was just such a
[57:16] privilege to get to know you all and uh
[57:18] you'll be dear to our hearts when we go
[57:20] back but thank you for opening up your
[57:22] arms thank you for being so kind and we
[57:24] really felt the love so God bless you
[57:26] all amen so yeah I think we'll we'll
[57:29] move on thank you musicians thank you
[57:31] for all the support the song leader got
[57:33] to know brother Michael here also pretty
[57:35] well my name's sake so I know he's a
[57:36] good guy already just by his name you
[57:39] know so uh but uh yeah we had a good
[57:42] time by God's grace and we just want to
[57:43] preach maybe a bit more I don't know if
[57:45] I'm going to be some preaching I might
[57:46] just do a bit more on the teaching side
[57:48] but we'll see how the Lord goes but you
[57:50] know as we said last week Sunday you
[57:52] know we called to to overcome our in all
[57:55] aspects of Our Lives you know we we
[57:57] obviously definitely are preaching that
[57:59] you know God sent a prophet we're
[58:00] definitely preaching that um you know
[58:02] you need to get the Holy Ghost those are
[58:04] all those things but you know we got all
[58:06] these tools that that came via the
[58:08] prophet and he showed so many wonderful
[58:10] tools so that we can really conquer
[58:13] things in all facets of our Liv so we
[58:14] don't want to miss out anything so it as
[58:17] I said it might be a bit more of a
[58:18] teaching but I believe by God's grace it
[58:20] can really help us because you're really
[58:22] in a in a in a r says this a neurotic
[58:25] age it's a it's so much there's so much
[58:27] mental distress and pressure upon us and
[58:30] you know even if you can live in such a
[58:31] calm place as New Zealand no doubt
[58:33] you'll feel even things from the outside
[58:35] coming in you know the the wars and all
[58:37] those things that's going on the the
[58:38] different uh you know pressures of the
[58:40] economies and Etc so so we need to we
[58:42] need to make sure that we watch
[58:43] ourselves that we we guard ourselves we
[58:45] guard our minds so that's what I want to
[58:47] preach on tonight I'm going to be
[58:49] preaching on as a man thinketh amen cuz
[58:51] it's so important that we control the
[58:54] the the tower up here because the tower
[58:57] up here uh is going to channel things
[58:59] down into the heart and yes we we
[59:01] believe in the Holy Ghost seeding that
[59:03] heart but still we know there's still a
[59:05] faith and a doubt that sits there and if
[59:07] you're going to accommodate the doubt
[59:08] too much that Faith man is going to get
[59:11] smaller and smaller amen so let the Lord
[59:13] just help us uh through these things and
[59:15] may the Lord just give the inspiration
[59:17] where it's needed so we're going to be
[59:18] turning to 2 Corinthians 10 if you can
[59:20] just turn to your Bible 2 Corinthians
[59:22] chapter 10 I also will have a displayed
[59:25] for those that need
[59:26] it amen a very well-known scripture but
[59:29] sometimes you can just see a little bit
[59:31] further than what meets the eye and
[59:33] let's by God's grace dig into these
[59:40] things amen I believe we're there 2
[59:43] Corinthians 10:
[59:45] 3-5 it reads is thus and brother you can
[59:48] go to the next slide for though we walk
[59:51] in the
[59:52] flesh we do not war
[59:55] after the Flesh and we're talking with
[59:58] the youth you know we have to make sure
[1:00:00] that we realize we don't wrestle against
[1:00:02] flesh and blood but against
[1:00:03] principalities and Powers you know and
[1:00:05] we must understand see the spirit behind
[1:00:08] the thing that is driving it we made a
[1:00:09] little analogy it's like a a driver
[1:00:12] behind a wheel and if the car hits a
[1:00:15] pedestrian and hurts them we don't
[1:00:18] prosecute the car even though the car
[1:00:20] did the damage we prosecute the driver
[1:00:23] so let's make sure we always keep our
[1:00:24] our mind where it should be because
[1:00:26] there is spirits that unfortunately can
[1:00:27] get upon us if we're not careful and it
[1:00:29] can do harm to to obviously our walk
[1:00:32] with God and to those around us amen for
[1:00:35] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:00:38] carnal But
[1:00:40] Mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:00:43] of strongholds now what are some of
[1:00:45] these strongholds casting down
[1:00:47] imaginations that's some of these things
[1:00:49] that can come into us and upon us and
[1:00:52] every High thing what that exalt vth
[1:00:55] itself against the knowledge of God so
[1:00:58] anything that can come against what we
[1:01:00] know to be truth is a problem this thing
[1:01:04] is trying to push itself above what we
[1:01:06] need to make sure is embedded in us and
[1:01:09] fortified and confirmed and bringing
[1:01:12] into captivity every thought to The
[1:01:15] Obedience of God Amen and this is most
[1:01:18] certainly No Easy Task you know the
[1:01:20] devil we're talking about how the devil
[1:01:21] can throw thoughts inside of you over
[1:01:23] the camp and you know sometimes you
[1:01:25] really just have to make sure that you
[1:01:27] you allow the spirit of God to to
[1:01:29] control those thoughts and to help you
[1:01:31] to identify because the devil's clever
[1:01:33] he doesn't just s like they say just
[1:01:35] come in straight with a bad thought he
[1:01:37] often will build it up little by little
[1:01:39] little and it just gets higher and
[1:01:40] higher before you know it you deep into
[1:01:42] things you should have never been in the
[1:01:43] first place but that's the devil but we
[1:01:46] trust by God's grace we'll be able to
[1:01:47] identify some of these things let's
[1:01:49] close our eyes dear heavenly father we
[1:01:51] just want to truly commit the service
[1:01:52] into your hands saying Lord God we are
[1:01:54] nothing without you we are but just weak
[1:01:56] flesh Lord and we know that we need a
[1:01:59] God that's Lord all powerful all knowing
[1:02:02] and Lord has quickening power that can
[1:02:05] be spoken upon this service Lord so may
[1:02:07] you speak quickening power upon this
[1:02:08] service may you Quicken me Quicken the
[1:02:10] people may we just have a portion from
[1:02:12] you we ask in Jesus precious name amen
[1:02:15] amen you may be seated if you don't mind
[1:02:16] I'll be taking also off my
[1:02:19] jacket amen so yeah as all said we all a
[1:02:22] little bit tender we all tired but amen
[1:02:25] we'll try not to keep everyone too
[1:02:27] long and uh hopefully be out pretty soon
[1:02:30] but um yeah these things are important
[1:02:32] we sure want to make sure we we don't
[1:02:35] forget these important parts which is
[1:02:37] part of the Christian Living and to help
[1:02:38] us so Romans 12 2:3 and be not conformed
[1:02:42] to this world but be transformed so how
[1:02:45] does this happen how how can we not how
[1:02:48] do we avoid to be conformed and rather
[1:02:51] be transformed but how does it happen by
[1:02:53] the renewing of your mind
[1:02:55] mind how that you may be that you may
[1:02:57] prove what is is that good and
[1:03:00] acceptable and perfect will of God CU
[1:03:03] God desires this of us that we will
[1:03:05] renew our mind that we will watch our
[1:03:07] thoughts for I say through the grace
[1:03:09] given unto me to every man that is upon
[1:03:12] you not to think of himself more highly
[1:03:15] than he ought to think but to think
[1:03:18] soberly CU that's often the first thing
[1:03:21] the devil will come and you can see just
[1:03:22] in the Garden of Eden what does he do he
[1:03:24] tries to offer Eve something bigger
[1:03:27] you'll be like unto God so one of the
[1:03:30] first things when it's things that try
[1:03:32] and lift you above where you should be
[1:03:34] where we should just be humble and just
[1:03:36] really under the the humility of the
[1:03:39] Holy Spirit allowing him and his
[1:03:41] thoughts to dominate our mind in the way
[1:03:43] we think but to think soberly according
[1:03:45] to God uh as God hath dealt to every man
[1:03:48] The Measure of Faith amen
[1:03:51] so your mind now your mind is not your
[1:03:54] your brain it's two different two
[1:03:57] different things you know as much as we
[1:03:59] know the brain is obviously what houses
[1:04:01] the mind the brain is the actual organ
[1:04:04] but the brain has the ability to think
[1:04:06] and that is the mind and as we know the
[1:04:08] mind is also linked to the spirit realm
[1:04:11] so we talk about the mind it's the
[1:04:13] spirit realm and there's obviously
[1:04:15] joinings between the flesh the spirit
[1:04:17] and the soul and they all are
[1:04:19] influencing each other so we must
[1:04:22] understand it's like gateways as we move
[1:04:24] on so brother bam
[1:04:27] says God chose the
[1:04:30] heart where he would make sure he got to
[1:04:33] because he knows if he can first of all
[1:04:35] save you that is what counts but the
[1:04:38] devil also knows if he can get into the
[1:04:40] mind it can affect the heart and it can
[1:04:42] confuse the heart because we talk about
[1:04:43] also double-minded people so the
[1:04:46] greatest battle ever fought brother Bram
[1:04:48] says in my mind is in your mind it's the
[1:04:52] greatest battle so if we don't
[1:04:55] understand that and we don't understand
[1:04:56] how that shall we say Battle Ground
[1:04:59] looks and how the devil will use it then
[1:05:03] it's going to start affecting the inward
[1:05:06] man look at the prophet say here when
[1:05:09] this great battle started on Earth there
[1:05:11] had to be a mutual meeting place so in
[1:05:14] other words obviously we know the flesh
[1:05:15] is sold under under sin and we know the
[1:05:17] soul belongs to God but what is the
[1:05:19] meeting place the in between the spirit
[1:05:21] realm the mind there's a mutual meeting
[1:05:24] place there had to be a place selected
[1:05:26] for the battle to begin and for the
[1:05:28] battle to rage and that Battlegrounds
[1:05:30] begin in the human
[1:05:32] mind there is where the battle starts
[1:05:35] the human mind is was chosen for the
[1:05:37] place of the battle where it was begin
[1:05:39] and that is because that decisions are
[1:05:42] made from the mind the
[1:05:44] head now that never started in some
[1:05:47] organization that they never started
[1:05:49] from some mechanical Affair the grounds
[1:05:52] never started there they careful that
[1:05:54] organization can never never do the work
[1:05:56] of God because the Battlegrounds where
[1:05:58] you've got to meet your enemy is in the
[1:06:01] mind you've got to make your
[1:06:04] choice it meets you now in this service
[1:06:08] there was a a crippled girl I think on a
[1:06:10] stretch or something brother bandam
[1:06:11] keeps referring to us when she when you
[1:06:12] see him say yeah this he says yeah I
[1:06:15] want this little girl here that's very
[1:06:17] sick to be sure to listen out to this
[1:06:19] real closely decisions are made in the
[1:06:23] mind the head
[1:06:24] there is where Satan meets you and the
[1:06:27] decisions are made because that God made
[1:06:29] a man that way it's part of what our
[1:06:33] makeup is but it's a bit harder
[1:06:36] sometimes because like we often say the
[1:06:38] body is the very easy one to see that's
[1:06:40] the that's the one you see in the mirror
[1:06:42] the one you pamper that made you you
[1:06:43] know made you look nice before you came
[1:06:45] to church Etc you know but the reality
[1:06:48] is you know that is that is just very
[1:06:50] much one layer of who you are and as we
[1:06:52] know the spirit real is getting into a
[1:06:55] very shall we say a Grace Place and it
[1:06:58] can be a very deceptive
[1:07:00] place because if you're not careful
[1:07:03] you're going to allow you're going to
[1:07:05] allow too much into that Spirit realm
[1:07:06] and that's why Satan in this in this age
[1:07:09] more than ever before is getting into
[1:07:11] that Spirit realm he's getting it
[1:07:13] through the fourth dimension through the
[1:07:14] through the things we look at that's why
[1:07:16] even like brother Tazo was talking to
[1:07:18] the youth about be careful what you
[1:07:19] watch like horror movies and stuff
[1:07:21] because that stuff without even
[1:07:22] realizing the the devil's so clever he's
[1:07:25] realized he doesn't even need to go via
[1:07:27] your flesh yes your flesh might have a
[1:07:28] sensation of fear and you might start
[1:07:30] sweating a bit when you had to watch
[1:07:31] some of these things but the reality is
[1:07:33] the devil has implants those things
[1:07:34] straight into your spirit realm without
[1:07:37] you even realizing it and you might feel
[1:07:39] all fine but then that night or whatever
[1:07:41] the next day you wake up and you can
[1:07:42] have suddenly this tormenting spirit
[1:07:45] that can come upon you so you have to
[1:07:47] understand these things are extremely
[1:07:48] powerful and the devil realizes the same
[1:07:50] with music you can just you know be be
[1:07:53] listening to music music and without
[1:07:54] even realizing it thoughts can suddenly
[1:07:56] start popping up into your mind and it's
[1:07:58] because these little seeds are being
[1:07:59] thrown and Satan has this way to get
[1:08:01] right past the body realm straight to
[1:08:03] the spirit realm and we don't even
[1:08:05] realize sometimes why we are struggling
[1:08:07] with certain things but they've been put
[1:08:09] in via the the Devil Himself so we have
[1:08:12] to watch these things you know there's
[1:08:13] been many good studies of this and I
[1:08:15] know some of the ministers and the
[1:08:16] messes have already gone into music and
[1:08:18] all these uh fascinating uh you know
[1:08:21] hidden messages and you know even the MS
[1:08:23] use it with the music we I'm sure you
[1:08:25] many of you know what I'm talking about
[1:08:26] but it's just fascinating to see how you
[1:08:28] know that Spirit realm has been affected
[1:08:30] in so many different ways so yeah we
[1:08:32] know the five cent is on the outside but
[1:08:34] look at that we got imagination
[1:08:36] conscience memory a reason affection all
[1:08:38] these little things the Satan can use to
[1:08:41] try and get in and then we have
[1:08:42] obviously the middle which is the sole
[1:08:44] third pull faith and doubt but like we
[1:08:46] say if you're not careful that doubt man
[1:08:49] can get way stronger than it's meant to
[1:08:51] be and you can start going through some
[1:08:52] really tough times times as a Christian
[1:08:55] where you start doubting yourself you
[1:08:56] start doubting your experience and all
[1:08:58] types of things because you didn't allow
[1:09:01] for the faith man to
[1:09:03] grow now I found this and forgive me if
[1:09:07] I'm wrong maybe some of you would know
[1:09:09] but from what I remember when I found
[1:09:10] this this was part of brother bram's uh
[1:09:13] sort of sketch he had drawn when he when
[1:09:14] he preached the greatest battle ever
[1:09:16] fought but if it is wrong just forgive
[1:09:17] me I'm not trying to uh push this as
[1:09:19] this is the message it's just that I'd
[1:09:21] found it and it seemed like this is part
[1:09:23] of his notes when I analyze some of his
[1:09:25] writings it looked like it was the
[1:09:26] prophets but it doesn't really matter
[1:09:27] but the point is I like the principle of
[1:09:30] it because yeah you have the mind and
[1:09:33] here you can see as whatever you're
[1:09:35] filtering Hing in that mind so it's been
[1:09:38] filtered down into the Heart by the
[1:09:41] different
[1:09:42] things so obviously yes God chose the
[1:09:44] soul praise him for that Satan has
[1:09:47] chosen up there in the flesh but we must
[1:09:49] understand if we don't control what is
[1:09:50] coming down there we can get into
[1:09:53] trouble
[1:09:54] so the world has very much got onto this
[1:09:56] mind thing the posit I'm sure you've
[1:09:58] seen all the positive thinking that's
[1:10:00] going on around I'm sure you've seen all
[1:10:01] the whatsap statuses you know believe in
[1:10:03] yourself and you know all things can
[1:10:04] happen and and there's a lot of truth
[1:10:06] behind that because the world has tapped
[1:10:07] into this incredible thing called the
[1:10:10] mind and positive thinking it's
[1:10:11] incredibly powerful and and if you want
[1:10:13] to just say it's nothing Well it it is
[1:10:15] because you can see results people have
[1:10:17] incredible results just by being
[1:10:18] positive having a good attitude Etc and
[1:10:21] I mean maybe some of these quotes will
[1:10:22] be familiar you might have seen you know
[1:10:24] when you think positive good things
[1:10:25] happen you know once you replace
[1:10:27] negative thoughts with positive ones
[1:10:29] you'll start having positive results
[1:10:30] these are
[1:10:32] true but like you'll see now how the
[1:10:34] prophet says the problem is they're
[1:10:35] missing an important
[1:10:37] ingredient the mind is everything what
[1:10:40] you think you
[1:10:41] become when you when you go through a
[1:10:44] negative situation don't think about it
[1:10:46] make it
[1:10:47] positive so all of these things are as I
[1:10:50] say have got the have got the the the
[1:10:52] good side but we need to as I say filter
[1:10:54] all of these through the world word
[1:10:56] because there's also the opposite where
[1:10:58] they'll say something on the lines of
[1:10:59] you know anyone that is negative in your
[1:11:01] life you must just cut them out and you
[1:11:03] know is that Christian is that how we
[1:11:05] meant to be no we meant to get through
[1:11:06] those things to work it out to join
[1:11:08] anything that is dividing us and there's
[1:11:11] any hurt between us to be happy is to
[1:11:13] think positively confidently and
[1:11:15] optimistically the most common way
[1:11:17] people give up their power is by
[1:11:19] thinking they don't have any so
[1:11:22] absolutely these things are
[1:11:24] true but like brother bam says here you
[1:11:28] need to be
[1:11:29] careful because now he says yeah now
[1:11:31] there is where the battle begins right
[1:11:33] in your mind whether you
[1:11:36] will now
[1:11:38] remember it's not Christian
[1:11:41] Science Now mind over matter which is
[1:11:44] what we're going through now that the
[1:11:47] mind accepts the life which is the word
[1:11:49] of God and there brings the life just
[1:11:53] your your thought doesn't do it but the
[1:11:55] word of God with it you see it's a
[1:11:59] combined effort yes we are because
[1:12:03] that's the we'll go through now this is
[1:12:04] the principle of faith we dealt with
[1:12:05] some of the young young people about
[1:12:07] this the principle of faith is still
[1:12:08] there that you must you know speak
[1:12:10] positive you know try and cut out all
[1:12:12] the negative thoughts that are coming
[1:12:14] but the reality is you have to filter
[1:12:16] that and have the word as the foundation
[1:12:18] of what you're doing and then it becomes
[1:12:21] perfect in the will of God but
[1:12:22] unfortunately the world is just tapping
[1:12:24] into the other side and it's just about
[1:12:25] the thought life broaden the channel of
[1:12:28] your thoughts see it's not the thought
[1:12:29] as Christian Science make it mind over
[1:12:31] matter no that isn't
[1:12:34] it but yes is it powerful 100% And and
[1:12:37] doctors even use it I'm sure many of you
[1:12:39] had heard about the placebo effect you
[1:12:42] know you can have a practically a sugar
[1:12:44] pull but you say this will sort out your
[1:12:46] headache and meanwhile it's just sugar
[1:12:48] but because you believed the doctor that
[1:12:51] that headache disappears it's a fact
[1:12:53] they've proven it it's a perceiver
[1:12:55] effect and it's actually incredible uh
[1:12:58] results that have come from
[1:13:01] it in principle they're pretty much
[1:13:03] saying if you believe it will affect you
[1:13:04] it will if you don't it
[1:13:06] won't very powerful these Minds
[1:13:09] incredibly powerful and Medicine
[1:13:10] understands it and like I said there's
[1:13:11] been a great study of the mind of late
[1:13:15] incredible studies there's incredible
[1:13:16] articles that I would advise that you
[1:13:18] even go and read about it because it's
[1:13:19] fascinating to see how things operate
[1:13:22] and how you know you can then hopefully
[1:13:24] identify when the devil wants to get in
[1:13:26] and use the channel the opposite of
[1:13:28] placea is the
[1:13:29] Noba so even if that medicine they given
[1:13:32] you has been proven in the clinic to
[1:13:33] 100% help you and it really will help
[1:13:36] you science says that if you don't
[1:13:38] believe it's going to help you well then
[1:13:40] it's grave time and then obviously the
[1:13:42] opposite the placea if you want if you
[1:13:44] believe even though it's sugar if you
[1:13:46] believe it you're going to you're going
[1:13:47] to get well so it's just
[1:13:49] fascinating look at some of these things
[1:13:51] and this is from FindMe cure.com you
[1:13:53] know facts about the placebo effect you
[1:13:55] know so it says your 48% of doctors have
[1:13:58] prescribed placeas at least 10 times in
[1:14:00] the past year lovely you thought the
[1:14:02] doctor was only there for uh with
[1:14:05] genuine medicine well it's not the fact
[1:14:07] this is not me this is this is a you
[1:14:09] know from medical things you know
[1:14:10] sources was medical news today so these
[1:14:12] These are stats out there you know uh 50
[1:14:17] to 70% 75% of the anti-depressant trials
[1:14:20] include
[1:14:22] placebo 16% now this is fascinating now
[1:14:25] pistan disease obviously is quite a
[1:14:27] strong disease if you see the way way
[1:14:29] they react you know trying to can't keep
[1:14:31] themselves together but literally
[1:14:32] imagine that a
[1:14:34] 16% even though it's a quite a strong
[1:14:36] devil you could say uh they have they
[1:14:39] have showed improvements through just
[1:14:41] the sugar pool or at least extremely
[1:14:43] little amount that's supposed to help
[1:14:44] them up to 90% of the patients in anti-
[1:14:48] elipsy drug TOS I mean for those that
[1:14:51] have are familiar with the epsy I mean
[1:14:52] once a person is overcoming it I mean
[1:14:55] you can just almost see the devil
[1:14:56] working in that body it's really sad but
[1:14:58] the reality is you know just by giving a
[1:15:01] sugar pill look at the power of the mind
[1:15:03] they just believe it up to 19% that's
[1:15:06] fascinating for me you know and
[1:15:08] obviously this is the very common one
[1:15:09] 85% of the reduction in coughs and cough
[1:15:12] medicine trials are due to the placebo
[1:15:14] effect and only 15% to the active
[1:15:17] ingredients it's very high but yet when
[1:15:20] we have a cough we take the medicine we
[1:15:21] believe it and we recover
[1:15:24] fascinating fascinating how these things
[1:15:26] work but I want you to notice something
[1:15:29] are these
[1:15:30] 100% no see our God says you know I am
[1:15:35] the god that heals all your diseases
[1:15:38] amen and yes some of us will have it
[1:15:40] maybe as a bit of a thorn in the flesh
[1:15:42] like we spoke about last week but the
[1:15:43] reality is is God the Healer and he died
[1:15:46] on the cross and is by his stripes you
[1:15:47] healed absolutely and that covers 100%
[1:15:50] the thing look what he says here now you
[1:15:53] say I don't steal I don't drink I don't
[1:15:55] do these things that has nothing to do
[1:15:57] with it see it's the inside no matter
[1:16:00] how good you are how moral you are how
[1:16:02] truthful you are these things are
[1:16:04] respected sure but Jesus said except a
[1:16:07] man be born again see there's got to be
[1:16:10] something happened inside if you don't
[1:16:13] that's artificial put on for down in
[1:16:17] your heart you desire to do it anyway it
[1:16:19] can't be artificial it's got to be real
[1:16:23] and there's only one Avenue that can
[1:16:25] come down and that's by the way of free
[1:16:28] moral agency come into your soul by your
[1:16:31] thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:16:33] so is he if you say to this mountain
[1:16:36] move and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:16:38] believe that which is said will come to
[1:16:40] pass you can't have what he said you get
[1:16:43] it there you are see it's the
[1:16:45] Battlegrounds if you'd only get started
[1:16:48] first and that's what I want to say
[1:16:52] let's start turning
[1:16:54] on this this sort of a shall we say to
[1:16:57] be cognizant of our thoughts to to watch
[1:17:01] to God because you can just let things
[1:17:04] flow in without without filters without
[1:17:07] blockages and you can find yourself as
[1:17:09] we said earlier in places you never
[1:17:11] meant to be so may the Lord help us to
[1:17:14] get started first so that he can now
[1:17:17] allow these things and yes there's going
[1:17:19] to be free moral agencies part of it so
[1:17:21] you have to make a decision about these
[1:17:23] things you can't just sit back and say
[1:17:24] well I've got the Holy Ghost all of its
[1:17:27] time will sort itself out he is asking
[1:17:29] for your buying he's asking for you to
[1:17:31] show your commitment
[1:17:32] also and the devil is always trying to
[1:17:35] point you to someone else's failure but
[1:17:37] he tries to keep you away from the real
[1:17:39] testimony that's genuine because often
[1:17:42] we give up because we we we we we we see
[1:17:45] someone else with a similar case and
[1:17:47] they didn't get through we see they had
[1:17:48] a similar struggle and they're not
[1:17:50] getting through or why should I try but
[1:17:52] that's not supposed to be our our desire
[1:17:54] our desire must be positive our desire
[1:17:56] must be thinking on the right things
[1:17:58] he'll point you to a hypocrite sometime
[1:18:01] who went out impersonating something he
[1:18:03] didn't do do it because he was
[1:18:06] impersonating but if we come from the
[1:18:08] true source of the word of God heavens
[1:18:10] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:18:13] cannot pass away it's got to stay there
[1:18:16] and he's talking to that sister again
[1:18:18] you see it sis I'm it must be accepted
[1:18:21] in the mind then it's believed with the
[1:18:25] heart then the word of God becomes a
[1:18:27] reality then every senses of soul and
[1:18:30] body is just scoured out with the Holy
[1:18:32] Spirit then then your sense of God your
[1:18:35] conscience of God everything that's
[1:18:37] Godly flows through you there's not a
[1:18:40] doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise
[1:18:43] up so we can allow ourselves to be
[1:18:45] exposed to the true thing to to allow
[1:18:47] ourselves to be focused on what God has
[1:18:50] given us his promises and not doubt them
[1:18:52] them if we can get ourselves into that
[1:18:54] channel well you know as they say the
[1:18:57] sky is the
[1:18:58] limit and by God's grace we'll be
[1:19:00] fortifying that Soul realm which is what
[1:19:03] we have that's our desire amen now we're
[1:19:05] discussing these things at the camp
[1:19:07] because we're trying to show the the
[1:19:08] youth that because unfortunately we have
[1:19:11] organs in our body now we know the
[1:19:13] prophet clearly explains and we'll see
[1:19:15] it now but he clearly explains how the
[1:19:17] devil works is he has to get into a
[1:19:19] damaged Soul a damaged part of your body
[1:19:22] and it can want to be hereditary so it
[1:19:24] could have come down you even go to the
[1:19:25] doctors they ask you you know does your
[1:19:27] mother have high blood pressure you know
[1:19:28] is there cancer in your family cuz they
[1:19:30] understand the principle of Devil's
[1:19:33] being carried down through weaknesses in
[1:19:35] the family so as we know brother Bram
[1:19:37] explains that the devil has an Avenue to
[1:19:39] get into us when there's a
[1:19:41] weakness and then I'll explain to the
[1:19:43] youth well what if there's a brain
[1:19:44] damage do you think the devil's not
[1:19:46] going to get into that of course the
[1:19:48] devil's going to get into that weakness
[1:19:50] and how do we get the brain damaged
[1:19:51] we'll explain it to them it's that
[1:19:53] dopamine rush so that when they look at
[1:19:55] that thing they shouldn't have looked at
[1:19:56] when they partake in that when they
[1:19:57] shouldn't have you know there's now
[1:19:59] damage it's actually been clinically
[1:20:00] proven you see it on the the sonas they
[1:20:02] do on the brain you can literally see
[1:20:04] it's and I explain to the youth it's
[1:20:05] like a river that's flowing down there's
[1:20:07] the natural way it's supposed to be
[1:20:09] because not dopam dopamine is not a bad
[1:20:11] thing but when you get a massive
[1:20:12] dopamine spike it literally causes
[1:20:15] damage in the brain so as the rivers
[1:20:16] would flow through the easiest path cuz
[1:20:19] just like the the brain's lazy and just
[1:20:21] like water going down we'll always find
[1:20:22] the easiest path so your brain is
[1:20:25] actually lazy and if it can find a way
[1:20:27] to feel good about itself quicker then
[1:20:30] another way it will take that path so
[1:20:32] what happens with them dopamine a a rush
[1:20:35] it literally like Gorges out like a
[1:20:37] channel in your mind it's as I say it's
[1:20:39] literally brain damage they can show you
[1:20:41] under Sona I've researched these things
[1:20:43] is a brain there's like brain damage and
[1:20:45] now there's this this this this habit
[1:20:47] this bad habit and addiction that can
[1:20:49] form because you as soon as you're
[1:20:50] feeling under pressure as soon as things
[1:20:52] are going wrong you're bored or whatever
[1:20:54] it is the devil and you want to just
[1:20:56] feel good about yourself you want to
[1:20:57] feel better you want to well what
[1:20:58] happens there the devil has got in and
[1:21:01] he's connected a pornography spirit in
[1:21:04] there he's connected maybe drugs alcohol
[1:21:07] and it goes on and on you know we so hit
[1:21:08] the the hard things and I speaking to
[1:21:10] about the alray the end of the day you
[1:21:11] must understand and even to the older
[1:21:12] folk that maybe don't understand the
[1:21:14] struggles of the younger people anything
[1:21:16] that replaces God in a time of need is a
[1:21:20] problem anything you can run to
[1:21:24] books you know you can run to
[1:21:28] tablets there's lots of things that we
[1:21:31] could run to besides God in a time of
[1:21:33] need and it'll make you feel better when
[1:21:35] you're supposed to first go to God and
[1:21:38] these things are hard these things are
[1:21:39] as I say it's it's it's it's very quick
[1:21:41] to stand on a pedestal and look down
[1:21:43] upon others and judge them but I ask are
[1:21:45] you where you should be in a time of
[1:21:47] need going to father to help you and not
[1:21:50] rushing to something else that makes you
[1:21:52] feel good but like I said don't think it
[1:21:54] only goes to the rough stuff it goes for
[1:21:56] anything cuz Satan knows this weakness
[1:21:58] and he's believe me he knows how to to
[1:22:00] access those channels so like we're
[1:22:02] explaining to the youth unfortunately
[1:22:04] now you have literally brain damage and
[1:22:06] we explaining to them and I was speaking
[1:22:08] to a young brother talking about even
[1:22:10] how you know if if if you if you've been
[1:22:12] with another woman or you know vice
[1:22:14] versa that actually will tell you the
[1:22:16] you how the DNA they actually shown
[1:22:19] these guys have proven there's actually
[1:22:20] that person's DNA forms part of your DNA
[1:22:23] and for the rest of the life you
[1:22:24] actually carry that person in your DNA
[1:22:26] this is scientific I've got nothing
[1:22:27] spiritual you can go research it
[1:22:29] yourself it's unbelievable but by God's
[1:22:32] grace yet again like I said to that
[1:22:33] young brother I fellowship with God can
[1:22:35] also heal the DNA Heen as much as you
[1:22:38] can heal the mind he can heal the DNA
[1:22:40] but we have to allow him to come and
[1:22:42] sort it out to sooth those areas over so
[1:22:45] the facts of the matter is now we have a
[1:22:47] situation we have a real Gorge as we can
[1:22:49] say damage in our brain which is not
[1:22:51] healthy which is which is where Satan
[1:22:53] now has implanted a a spirit and we need
[1:22:56] God's grace to help sort of dam that up
[1:22:59] to to to to fill that space because
[1:23:02] ultimately he's never meant for us to
[1:23:04] have these things and yes it's going to
[1:23:06] be hard because the fact of the matter
[1:23:08] normally starts with mental Faith let me
[1:23:10] just read this quote I think it's the
[1:23:12] best way to say it and the biggest part
[1:23:14] of our mental Faith uh faith is mental
[1:23:17] Faith how by hearing the word it brings
[1:23:20] us to a mental recogn recognition of God
[1:23:23] but if this coming from above oh brother
[1:23:26] if it ever strikes us there is a Godly
[1:23:29] spiritual Faith so brother bam you can
[1:23:31] see he's se he obviously was shown with
[1:23:34] his hands but he's obviously pointing to
[1:23:35] his the soul and he's saying oh man if
[1:23:38] that mental Faith up here can ever
[1:23:40] strike this the soul realm it can become
[1:23:43] a Godly spiritual
[1:23:45] Faith which is what we want to achieve
[1:23:48] amen and then you know there's a that
[1:23:50] great example about that man that came
[1:23:52] in the Prophet The Prophet's prayer line
[1:23:54] and he he had was blind as we all know
[1:23:56] that so well and what did the prophet
[1:23:58] say well go go confess him go go go
[1:24:01] telling everyone and then he he did it
[1:24:03] for a little bit he comes back he says
[1:24:04] but I'm not healed yet he says well you
[1:24:05] are you just have to keep you know
[1:24:08] confessing keep proclaiming and you know
[1:24:10] how it goes he used to sell newspapers
[1:24:11] shouting out thank thank the Lord I'm
[1:24:13] Healed and and then the barber shop
[1:24:15] moment happened amen and it's almost
[1:24:17] like the in that time of I just like it
[1:24:18] in almost that time of mockery when The
[1:24:20] Barbers like oh you know I hear
[1:24:22] you know you healed and nor a mockery
[1:24:25] that's when God stepped on the scene
[1:24:26] when he confessed yes I am healed and as
[1:24:29] we know he received his sight there so
[1:24:31] the same principle it starts with the
[1:24:33] mental faith and me many people this is
[1:24:34] the hard part because to get through
[1:24:36] mental faith is tough you have to
[1:24:38] actively apply it you have to be as as
[1:24:42] we said earlier thinking about it
[1:24:44] guarding the thoughts because as soon as
[1:24:45] you start doubting it then we know the
[1:24:48] brother B teach us the devil again can
[1:24:50] get in and it's hard because like I was
[1:24:51] teaching the youth you might still
[1:24:53] stumble you we we prayed over it was
[1:24:55] such a beautiful moment we the youth
[1:24:57] laid hands on each other we prayed for
[1:24:58] each other for God to deliver us of all
[1:25:00] these spirits but the fact of the matter
[1:25:01] is like even the Bible says that devil
[1:25:03] goes for walk in dry places and if he
[1:25:05] comes back and he and the God hasn't F
[1:25:07] filled that Gap and you're not keeping
[1:25:09] God there and your faith there we know
[1:25:11] Satan can get an Avenue back so yes it
[1:25:14] it can seem almost like tough work but
[1:25:17] if you can just cat the faith element if
[1:25:19] you can just believe in the word then
[1:25:22] then that healing can come then then we
[1:25:24] can see that we can get Deliverance of
[1:25:26] these things as we as you all know
[1:25:29] there's the Miracles we all want the
[1:25:30] Miracles I would love like I say to the
[1:25:32] youth I would love at a at a at a snap
[1:25:34] of the finger that that God just swooped
[1:25:36] over everyone and everyone was
[1:25:37] miraculously healed and there and then
[1:25:40] everyone just had instant healing of the
[1:25:41] brain and that Spirit left but the
[1:25:43] reality is another quote I don't I don't
[1:25:45] believe I have it yet but another quote
[1:25:46] brother Bram says God mainly deals in
[1:25:49] Divine
[1:25:50] Healing as much as we want the miracle
[1:25:53] the the instant healing that's I mean
[1:25:55] we're all human I would want it I'm sure
[1:25:56] you would want it but he says most of
[1:25:58] the time God deals in Divine Healing why
[1:26:00] because that's where so much of our
[1:26:02] character gets built because now you
[1:26:04] have to apply Faith over and over with
[1:26:06] with no direct results but in its time
[1:26:09] by God's grace we will get there like
[1:26:12] that blind man just keep confessing it
[1:26:14] keep believing it so when there when
[1:26:16] that when that devil struck you down
[1:26:18] again just don't accept it even though
[1:26:20] it looks like it's the same thing oh the
[1:26:22] pornography I I just looked at something
[1:26:23] I shouldn't oh now what well just ignore
[1:26:26] it say I had a moment with God I had a
[1:26:28] moment and I believe he delivered me and
[1:26:30] that is just my mind that is damaged
[1:26:32] that's been repaired and I'm not
[1:26:34] prepared to accept it and you have to
[1:26:37] besides what you see in front of you
[1:26:39] believe that the Lord has made a way and
[1:26:41] that is hard but he's called it for for
[1:26:43] us to do it and by his grace we will do
[1:26:45] it we just need to believe in him and
[1:26:48] fortify the white Faith dog within us
[1:26:51] but talks about the white to the black
[1:26:52] dog fortify the white dog you know get
[1:26:55] inside that word let the words of Life
[1:26:57] speak to you and you'll see your faith
[1:26:59] will rise but we have to invest in those
[1:27:02] things because the reality is like we
[1:27:04] that picture shows if you're going to
[1:27:06] let all other rubbish filter down well
[1:27:07] that Faith dog white dog is just getting
[1:27:09] smaller and smaller and then you're
[1:27:11] going to find it harder and harder to
[1:27:12] believe and if you can if Satan knows if
[1:27:14] he can just get you in that place of
[1:27:16] doubt that you no longer believe God
[1:27:17] delivered you well there we go you got
[1:27:19] that demon straight back in there but by
[1:27:21] his Grace amen he still can give you
[1:27:23] another chance even if you fell because
[1:27:26] I was sharing with the youth hey I
[1:27:28] struggled with some things and I just
[1:27:29] couldn't work it out I was in a vicious
[1:27:31] cycle vicious cycle many many years but
[1:27:33] at the point of time God really
[1:27:35] delivered me of that that that demon and
[1:27:37] I knew it was gone but then I still
[1:27:39] realized I had to realize I now need to
[1:27:41] repair my mind just as brother BR says
[1:27:44] that cancer within you yes that spirit
[1:27:45] is gone but that cancer lump is inside
[1:27:48] of you and often the third or fourth day
[1:27:50] afterwards you'll feel worse than ever
[1:27:51] he says like you want to die but
[1:27:53] actually it's just the blood blood
[1:27:55] cleansing out the cancer and if you can
[1:27:58] just push through you'll be fine and as
[1:28:01] much as that brain will be wanting to go
[1:28:02] mad because it's demanding a dopamine
[1:28:05] now and I want to be happy now if you by
[1:28:07] God's grace could just say well say I'm
[1:28:08] not going to give you that I'm going to
[1:28:10] stay back here and I'm not going down
[1:28:11] those Avenues by his grace I rather fed
[1:28:14] myy myself of the word and not allow
[1:28:16] myself to go and let the natural way of
[1:28:18] dopamine come which is by giving myself
[1:28:20] to God maybe go for just a more
[1:28:23] practical thing going for a walk or
[1:28:24] whatever there's many even natural ways
[1:28:26] get just get it out of your system and
[1:28:28] try and not let that that that thing and
[1:28:30] then slowly but surely that damn wall
[1:28:32] can build up again and it can be
[1:28:34] repaired but we need to allow time for
[1:28:37] these things amen may the Lord help us
[1:28:39] because these things like I said to the
[1:28:40] youth it's not easy it will be times
[1:28:43] when you really feel like you just you
[1:28:45] just can't keep pushing but by his grace
[1:28:47] he's given us a spirit of faith that can
[1:28:51] you just have to to keep believing
[1:28:52] irrespective of what you are seen in
[1:28:54] front of you
[1:28:56] amen where were we then the then what
[1:28:58] does faith do that Faith recognizes only
[1:29:00] the word
[1:29:02] amen and remember he suffered in all
[1:29:06] things amen he knows all things and
[1:29:09] there's just some beautiful things that
[1:29:10] was shared also on that even ALR touched
[1:29:12] on a beautiful story about a young man
[1:29:14] suffering with homosexual and he was
[1:29:16] just saying how you know the the pastor
[1:29:17] was de with him
[1:29:19] said um uh you know uh no one
[1:29:23] understands how I feel and the Pastor
[1:29:25] said but God does because the Bible says
[1:29:28] in all things he was tempted and tri so
[1:29:31] he does understand that maybe shocks
[1:29:33] some of us CU we we think certain things
[1:29:34] are Untouchable God touched everything
[1:29:37] when he was on Earth so he could
[1:29:39] understand you and have empathy with
[1:29:41] your struggle and that's so beautiful
[1:29:42] that's how we love our God so much
[1:29:44] because he was prepared to go to the
[1:29:45] lowest darkest place for us and meet us
[1:29:47] at our level that's just what a sort of
[1:29:50] a God we want and I believe we
[1:29:52] have and the Word was with God and the
[1:29:54] Word was God and the word is still God
[1:29:56] and the Word was made flesh and DT Among
[1:29:58] Us and when the word itself is pouring
[1:30:00] into our faith amen so that's how you
[1:30:02] get your faith element let the word
[1:30:04] itself pour into it get it there our
[1:30:07] mental Faith becomes a spiritual
[1:30:11] Revelation just that that what's
[1:30:13] happening up here this mental Faith just
[1:30:15] suddenly can drop down into the soul
[1:30:16] realm and it becomes a revelation amen
[1:30:20] and what a day of victory that is when
[1:30:21] when it
[1:30:22] comes all right now we discussed some of
[1:30:27] this at the in the at the youth camp but
[1:30:29] it was more on it wasn't really streamed
[1:30:31] I touched it we touched it more when we
[1:30:33] were doing the questions answers but
[1:30:34] there's one thing you now my wife and I
[1:30:36] she doesn't mind me saying this but we
[1:30:38] went through extreme battles as a family
[1:30:40] because my wife uh struggled with
[1:30:42] depression at one stage and it wasn't
[1:30:44] actually that she she just you know it
[1:30:46] was just depressed and the problem was
[1:30:47] after my birth of my second son her her
[1:30:50] whole hormones and everything just
[1:30:51] collap it was the they call it the
[1:30:53] adrenal gland uh completely collapsed
[1:30:56] adrenal helps you to get hormones that
[1:30:58] help you to deal stress the daily their
[1:31:00] daily cares of life just to have the
[1:31:01] energy and her adrenal gland completely
[1:31:03] collapsed obviously got damaged and now
[1:31:06] the devil had a way to get in there and
[1:31:09] to describe it the best way I can it's
[1:31:11] almost like she said it's almost like
[1:31:12] you've been pushed into the bed and even
[1:31:14] to raise up your arm or your even a
[1:31:16] finger is it feels like it weighs a ton
[1:31:19] now obviously with someone like many of
[1:31:20] us that have never experienced it we
[1:31:22] will try we wouldn't be able to
[1:31:23] understand it but that is the reality of
[1:31:24] what it
[1:31:25] was so the end of the day is I just you
[1:31:28] know obviously you don't understand we I
[1:31:29] made many mistakes as the husband of the
[1:31:32] of the of the household but at the end
[1:31:33] of the days by God's grace because of
[1:31:35] what she went through I started just to
[1:31:36] go through some things and just study
[1:31:38] these things and we need to look out
[1:31:39] remember we said it's a neurotic age and
[1:31:42] if we think these things are not going
[1:31:43] to influence us us we we need to we need
[1:31:45] to just open our eyes because amongst us
[1:31:48] I remember even the young ones parents
[1:31:50] watch your your kids if you if you find
[1:31:52] watch out for each other because these
[1:31:53] things are becoming more and more
[1:31:54] prevalent amongst us and there is by
[1:31:57] God's grace amen Solutions we need to we
[1:32:00] we we know that medicine has improved
[1:32:02] back in the day we know there's some
[1:32:03] problems with some of these things but
[1:32:05] by God's grace there's been some real
[1:32:07] good medicines and I know your your your
[1:32:10] pastor Al has has delved in many of
[1:32:12] these things but let us not be let's be
[1:32:14] wise in all things let's not just cut
[1:32:15] out when the Lord has provided Escape
[1:32:18] means but these are the things that I
[1:32:19] want to just highlight to you that you
[1:32:21] better be careful of because we can so
[1:32:24] uh uh uh go the one extreme that you
[1:32:26] must have faith faith faith which I
[1:32:28] believe but that we don't CER for those
[1:32:30] that don't have the ability maybe to do
[1:32:32] it that the prophet just explained with
[1:32:34] the mental faith and you say what are
[1:32:35] you talking about Michael give me a give
[1:32:37] me a sec I'm going to show you now what
[1:32:38] the prophet says here and as I said if
[1:32:41] you don't you don't have to believe me I
[1:32:42] say upfront if you don't agree with me I
[1:32:44] don't I don't I don't mind but just just
[1:32:46] allow yourself to maybe just see the
[1:32:48] words that the prophet uses and remember
[1:32:50] when the prophet he we don't have he
[1:32:52] didn't have the terms like schizophrenic
[1:32:53] and you know uh whatever these other
[1:32:55] terms are that we we talk so much so
[1:32:57] quickly and easily about from a mental
[1:32:59] disease he would talk about nervousness
[1:33:01] mental depression and stuff like that
[1:33:02] those are the words he used so when you
[1:33:04] see these things understand where the
[1:33:06] the root cause is all right well come
[1:33:08] here sister you believe with all your
[1:33:09] heart ma you're having awful trouble
[1:33:11] aren't you fighting every day cuz those
[1:33:15] with mental you know deficiencies to
[1:33:17] know what we're talking about look what
[1:33:19] he says here you got the hardest thing
[1:33:21] the hardest thing to get over there is
[1:33:24] it's
[1:33:25] nervousness yes sir you got a mental
[1:33:29] distress
[1:33:31] nervousness you're always dropping
[1:33:33] things too aren't you I see you too
[1:33:35] always drop some dishes the other day
[1:33:36] stand there when you stand up at that
[1:33:38] sink but now God is yet to make you well
[1:33:40] do you believe
[1:33:42] that now look son nervousness is the
[1:33:46] hardest thing there is to fight worse
[1:33:49] than cancer we shared this with the
[1:33:51] youth worse than
[1:33:52] cancer why is it worse than cancer
[1:33:55] because you can't mentally balance
[1:33:57] yourself right you see you can't get
[1:34:00] your mind running right the quote we
[1:34:03] just read how it works mental Faith
[1:34:05] becomes a spiritual Faith now what if
[1:34:08] your mental side can't balance itself
[1:34:11] right and think right what's going to
[1:34:13] happen we're going to have crisises in
[1:34:15] the family so we have to be wise as
[1:34:18] Believers in these things to make sure
[1:34:20] that this first spiritual Revelation
[1:34:23] because maybe in such cases maybe they
[1:34:25] don't have the ability to have the
[1:34:26] mental faith and I know it because we
[1:34:28] went through it because why we called as
[1:34:29] Believers to have faith amen so my wife
[1:34:32] would hear something and say well I'm
[1:34:33] believe I'm I'm I'm delivered and she'll
[1:34:35] go up the pools and a few weeks later
[1:34:37] there's disaster back in the home now
[1:34:40] this might surprise you it might be a
[1:34:41] bit foreign it might be weird for you to
[1:34:43] hear but I'm just giving you my
[1:34:44] experience and then these things were
[1:34:46] shared by God's grace with me when I
[1:34:48] looked in this I said oh wait a second
[1:34:50] here we need to be wise and look out for
[1:34:52] each other with these things and because
[1:34:54] the devil has unfortunately attacked us
[1:34:56] I will say this if you have a revelation
[1:34:59] you healed I would never stop anyone
[1:35:01] from quitting their their prescription
[1:35:03] as such but until you have a spiritual
[1:35:05] Revelation be careful because you don't
[1:35:07] know how to practice the mental Faith
[1:35:09] side because you why you can't mentally
[1:35:11] balance yourself right you can't get
[1:35:14] your mind right running why right
[1:35:16] because why the chemicals are on balance
[1:35:19] and they've they've shown that with
[1:35:20] these mental diseases and I know it's a
[1:35:22] very foreign thing you know in the olden
[1:35:23] days we didn't talk much about this it
[1:35:25] was almost taboo but this has become a
[1:35:27] reality of those things around us and if
[1:35:29] we're not diligent and we don't look out
[1:35:30] for each other we're going to have
[1:35:32] unfortunately very unhappy homes unhappy
[1:35:34] spouses unhappy children so let's look
[1:35:37] out for each other let's make sure we
[1:35:38] consider all things
[1:35:40] amen but you you have a very strange
[1:35:44] nature that is a deep thinker we're
[1:35:47] talking to the youth about some of the
[1:35:48] different uh you know temperaments and
[1:35:50] stuff and certain people are more more
[1:35:51] likely to have this that is a deep
[1:35:54] thinker always Crossing Bridges before
[1:35:56] you get there it's always not sometimes
[1:36:00] it's always a bad thing cuz all the
[1:36:03] worry and the it just drains you you
[1:36:06] know all the the stresses Etc and then
[1:36:09] of course like it normally always it
[1:36:11] never happens the way you plan it to
[1:36:12] happen doesn't that so true I think
[1:36:14] we've all in some way been guilty of
[1:36:16] these things but the prophet says we
[1:36:17] shouldn't do that we should make sure
[1:36:20] there's a better way to go and by that
[1:36:22] is developed a peptic condition of the
[1:36:24] stomach because these things are linked
[1:36:26] give you stomach trouble that's right
[1:36:28] isn't that that's sir if that is right
[1:36:30] raise your hand which which if it is
[1:36:33] right couldn't be nothing else God
[1:36:35] Almighty knows us now look what he says
[1:36:37] you now throw aside every negative
[1:36:41] thought and will go home and eat your
[1:36:44] supper and praise God and give him
[1:36:48] praise for it amen so let's make sure
[1:36:51] sure that we get our mental channels
[1:36:54] going right let us clean up our mental
[1:36:56] channels by God's
[1:36:58] grace it's got nothing about the size of
[1:37:01] the man and how strong he looks because
[1:37:02] you can have a man that looks all big
[1:37:04] and tough but on the inside these issues
[1:37:07] you might your mighty fine strongl
[1:37:08] looking man to be suffering with a
[1:37:10] nervous condition but you can't help it
[1:37:13] you've had it pretty near all your life
[1:37:16] it just bothers you you got a mental
[1:37:19] nervousness that causes you
[1:37:21] weary and you're always thinking of
[1:37:24] things and Crossing Bridges before you
[1:37:26] get to them that's a nature of yours
[1:37:28] that's right isn't it not reading your
[1:37:30] mind but that's the truth you always
[1:37:34] plan things and never happens that way
[1:37:36] and upsets you and things like that
[1:37:39] taking other people's troubles to your
[1:37:41] heart and worry over them when you
[1:37:43] really ought to do it you see why
[1:37:46] because we need to take it to God take
[1:37:49] the person that you know is a need to
[1:37:51] God you don't have to worry let him sort
[1:37:54] it out because as much as you can think
[1:37:55] you know exactly how to sort it out it's
[1:37:58] God that needs to do it and he can give
[1:37:59] you the inspiration if you're going to
[1:38:00] be to Tool but wait on him but God is
[1:38:04] yet to make you well my Gallant brother
[1:38:06] amen and I believe that's the same for
[1:38:08] each and every one that could have these
[1:38:10] things by God's grace because the same
[1:38:11] God that an angel of the Lord was with
[1:38:13] with with the Elijah our prophet in our
[1:38:16] day brother bam brother B said that same
[1:38:17] Angel of the Lord will be wherever this
[1:38:19] message is preached by Grace and it's
[1:38:22] still here and you can help each and
[1:38:23] everyone that has
[1:38:26] this and I go on record I say this about
[1:38:29] the word of God being a seed if you can
[1:38:31] take the right mental attitude and you
[1:38:33] know this so it's such a common quote
[1:38:35] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:38:37] Divine promise of God he will bring it
[1:38:42] to pass but see here if you can get
[1:38:46] yourself in a position position to
[1:38:48] believe that that promise was to you
[1:38:51] cuz we do that so much oh that is for
[1:38:54] this one that is to that one what about
[1:38:56] you cuz it's to everyone you need to CL
[1:38:59] take it on board and hold it to your
[1:39:01] heart and then if you can have that
[1:39:03] mental attitude it can become amen a
[1:39:06] divine revelation within us may the Lord
[1:39:08] help us all because every Divine promise
[1:39:10] is for us and we need him you can see
[1:39:14] the Psalms how David is constant
[1:39:16] thinking of God look what the David was
[1:39:18] like too many of us today think of Our
[1:39:20] Own been something that we could do
[1:39:22] better ourself but David was constantly
[1:39:25] thinking of what he could do for God
[1:39:28] Amen what a wonderful thing and may the
[1:39:31] Lord help us just have be like David
[1:39:34] amen we know how much God loved David a
[1:39:36] man after my own heart why because his
[1:39:38] heart and his mind was where it should
[1:39:40] be may the Lord help us so a little
[1:39:43] testimony I want to share with you and
[1:39:44] part of my healing process when I needed
[1:39:47] things for deliverance was that you know
[1:39:49] I had this funny enough you know but
[1:39:51] brother bam had a inspiration from a
[1:39:52] cigarette pack as we know thinking man's
[1:39:54] filter well I once had a bit of a little
[1:39:56] moment with a little WhatsApp status and
[1:39:59] there was a little video and pretty much
[1:40:01] what the guy was saying you know I don't
[1:40:03] understand you smokers he says you said
[1:40:05] you quit okay but why do you keep
[1:40:09] counting the days since you've been
[1:40:12] clean I thought you quit if you quit
[1:40:14] what is there to count from this day
[1:40:16] forward nothing should happen and then
[1:40:19] he then then suddenly some dawned on me
[1:40:21] he said the I think he said it in there
[1:40:23] the problem is you got a what you call a
[1:40:26] um a victim
[1:40:28] mentality and so many times the reason
[1:40:31] why we hang on to these things is
[1:40:33] because we feel sorry for our situation
[1:40:35] and how bad we were treated and how this
[1:40:37] one did this and that friend hurt me
[1:40:39] here Etc and part of that healing was
[1:40:43] that I had to realize that I had a
[1:40:45] victim mentality and these are just some
[1:40:47] of the little things they talk about
[1:40:49] victim mentality that I think is so
[1:40:50] important stop validating your victim
[1:40:52] mentality shake off your self-defeating
[1:40:54] drama and think spiritually now and
[1:40:57] embrace your innner ability to recover
[1:40:59] and Achieve through obviously the word
[1:41:02] of God because we know he has made a way
[1:41:04] for us but stop feeling sorry for
[1:41:06] yourself oh because of this oh because
[1:41:08] of that give it over to him let him be
[1:41:11] the one that can help you those with a
[1:41:14] Perpetual victim men's mindset tend to
[1:41:16] create the situations from which they
[1:41:18] suffer and we know that's true that's
[1:41:20] scriptural
[1:41:21] you know if you're going to think all
[1:41:22] that negative brother you want to speak
[1:41:24] these things that are negative well
[1:41:25] guess what it's just going to become a
[1:41:27] reality may the Lord help us with these
[1:41:29] things
[1:41:32] amen there's nothing can come up in the
[1:41:34] memory and say well I remember Miss
[1:41:35] Jones tried to trust God and miss so so
[1:41:38] miss do tried to trust God for healing
[1:41:39] one time and she
[1:41:41] failed but if that channel has been
[1:41:43] cleared out and been purged and filled
[1:41:46] on the inside with the holy spirit that
[1:41:48] don't even come in the memory no matter
[1:41:50] about Miss Jones and what she did it's
[1:41:52] not you and it's you and God together
[1:41:55] and nobody else but you too there you
[1:41:59] are there's your battle kill him at the
[1:42:02] beginning and this is one of the biggest
[1:42:05] problems we make with our thought life
[1:42:07] is we entertain things far too long and
[1:42:10] they take hold and brother man says when
[1:42:12] you identify it kill him at the
[1:42:14] beginning stop him dead in his tracks it
[1:42:18] ain't how long you can make the war
[1:42:21] linger it stop it right
[1:42:24] now that is our goal brother and sisters
[1:42:27] stop it now if you'll come and you'll
[1:42:30] keep them memories and conscience and
[1:42:32] everything thinking about well I might
[1:42:34] fail I might not be right don't you do
[1:42:38] that at all that's the prophet speaking
[1:42:41] amen and yes we're human and we we have
[1:42:44] our things our our our shall we say our
[1:42:46] our little upsets along life's way but
[1:42:48] let us rise to the occasion
[1:42:51] sometimes and like I said in wisdom in
[1:42:55] wisdom because yes we some of us need to
[1:42:58] be careful with these things if you have
[1:43:00] those certain conditions we spoke about
[1:43:02] now it's a strange thing that is that so
[1:43:04] much thought of people so he says that
[1:43:07] that this is so much thought of people
[1:43:11] and that would be right amongst us now
[1:43:13] this is the problem they say well I'm
[1:43:15] weak my faith is not very much I'm not a
[1:43:20] very good
[1:43:21] Christian that's just what the devil
[1:43:24] wants you to
[1:43:25] say you're just talking his language
[1:43:28] right
[1:43:31] then see you must never say that we
[1:43:37] watch our mouths brother and sisters
[1:43:38] watch what we say to each other watch
[1:43:40] your thoughts amen you must never say
[1:43:43] that don't let your testimony be
[1:43:45] negative let it be positive all the time
[1:43:48] irrespective of what you seeing and
[1:43:50] feeling
[1:43:51] may the Lord help us all I am saved I
[1:43:55] have God in my heart I believe him with
[1:43:58] all my heart this is what we should our
[1:44:01] anguage should be do you believe in
[1:44:03] Divine Healing with all my heart let
[1:44:06] your testimony always in your thoughts
[1:44:08] everything never permits a negative
[1:44:10] thought to come in your mind if you can
[1:44:11] help it when it starts that don't
[1:44:15] entertain it well you say I can't help
[1:44:18] the thoughts from coming yeah true you
[1:44:21] can't help it
[1:44:24] but for the Steven at the back should
[1:44:26] know what I'm talking about well that be
[1:44:28] like a farmer that said he couldn't he
[1:44:31] couldn't stop the birds from flying over
[1:44:33] his place but he could sure stop them
[1:44:35] from
[1:44:36] roosting there's a difference you can't
[1:44:39] help the thought Satan is going to throw
[1:44:40] in you mind but you have a decision you
[1:44:43] can stop him that Crow buling a nest and
[1:44:46] roosting so that's a good thing you see
[1:44:49] you can't help the thoughts when they
[1:44:51] come but don't entertain them just pass
[1:44:53] it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior
[1:44:58] All Things Are Mine by God I am going to
[1:45:01] keep them I'm going to testify of them
[1:45:04] and God can only bless you as you
[1:45:07] confess that he has done it for you see
[1:45:10] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:45:13] is that right Hebrew stre he said that
[1:45:15] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:45:18] he can only do for us as we accept it
[1:45:23] believe it and receive it we have to
[1:45:27] take hold of these things brothers and
[1:45:29] sisters brother Perry green had such a
[1:45:33] beautiful testimony linked to
[1:45:36] this he said he was really struggling he
[1:45:39] was a married man knew the prophet good
[1:45:42] friend and he was really struggling he
[1:45:44] says with some thoughts from the past he
[1:45:48] says his parents really raised him well
[1:45:50] to be really respectful but around
[1:45:52] sisters young ladies to make sure that
[1:45:54] he he didn't step over any boundaries
[1:45:56] that weren't meant to be there and he
[1:45:58] says along life's way he got a few
[1:46:01] girlfriends but he was always respectful
[1:46:04] and he didn't do anything beyond what
[1:46:06] was decent then he says I went and got
[1:46:08] married and I realized what life was all
[1:46:11] about and what happens between a man and
[1:46:13] a woman he says then my thoughts would
[1:46:17] go back to the times I was with those
[1:46:20] girlfriends friends and then I would
[1:46:22] think on what I actually could have done
[1:46:24] knowing now what I know to maybe have
[1:46:26] enticed them and made them to fall so he
[1:46:29] says I used to think on these things in
[1:46:31] a bad way and he says you know it would
[1:46:33] affect him really bad and you'll find
[1:46:34] his mind going to places shouldn't be
[1:46:37] and it really was bothering him and then
[1:46:40] he went he went on a trip with brother
[1:46:42] brandham he said and he said to brother
[1:46:44] brandham he says I want to talk to you
[1:46:45] about something when you have a gap and
[1:46:48] brother Bram and I think it must have
[1:46:49] been so hard brother Braham said to him
[1:46:51] yeah I know what it is but I'll talk to
[1:46:53] you
[1:46:54] later that must have been tough and for
[1:46:56] brother perig anyways so he says a
[1:47:00] couple days past and he says walking and
[1:47:01] past brother Bam's room and the door was
[1:47:03] open and brother bam called him in and
[1:47:06] this is something we need to understand
[1:47:07] that's just how we are in life he said
[1:47:10] Billy Paul he says listen he says you
[1:47:13] know you need to understand something he
[1:47:15] says you are a red-blooded male okay and
[1:47:18] you're going to have to watch yourself
[1:47:20] and that's the principle of these of of
[1:47:21] us still on on Earth you have to realize
[1:47:24] you're still a red-blooded male you're
[1:47:25] still a female with emotions and you
[1:47:27] know there's lots of things that affect
[1:47:28] us all in different ways he says that's
[1:47:30] not going to change but he says and you
[1:47:32] can't help it when Satan plants those uh
[1:47:35] thoughts in you but you can sure stop it
[1:47:38] and this is right linked to you you can
[1:47:40] stop that thing roosting in it but then
[1:47:43] he says something so and he said
[1:47:44] something so important to brother perig
[1:47:46] green he says now you need to understand
[1:47:47] something that when you have allowed the
[1:47:50] crow to bring a a twig or two you know
[1:47:52] before maybe you identified it or even
[1:47:54] build a nest before you identified it's
[1:47:56] a problem and You' now swept it out he
[1:47:58] says then you have to realize you must
[1:48:00] confess it before God because remember
[1:48:04] we have to bring all our thoughts and
[1:48:05] everything under subjection to God and
[1:48:07] he would said that you've sinned you
[1:48:09] have dwelt upon things in your mind you
[1:48:11] shouldn't have and he said you need to
[1:48:12] make that right he says then he then he
[1:48:14] says and then you go to um I think he
[1:48:16] says the 911 uh scripture of the Bible
[1:48:19] but it's it's the other way around it's
[1:48:21] 1 John
[1:48:22] 1:9 and it says there you know you know
[1:48:24] it well that that that that if you
[1:48:26] confess your sins amen before God he
[1:48:29] will forgive each and everyone and he
[1:48:31] says every time you start going down
[1:48:33] paast you're never not meant to be and
[1:48:35] those crows were bringing sticks he says
[1:48:37] you need to get on your knees and repent
[1:48:39] of those thoughts and properly repent of
[1:48:42] those thoughts and then he says it was
[1:48:44] just a matter of time before you
[1:48:46] completely got delivered of that
[1:48:47] terrible thought pattern because every
[1:48:49] time time he started to find himself
[1:48:51] thinking too much upon it he would get
[1:48:52] on his knees and confess it and he says
[1:48:54] in it's time the devil just got tired
[1:48:57] and moved on so the you know we have
[1:49:00] lovely tools at this time that we can
[1:49:03] use you know we're talking about just
[1:49:06] you know modern day challenges but the
[1:49:08] reality is we can prevent certain things
[1:49:10] in the first place it can really help us
[1:49:12] yes we know like we discussed with the
[1:49:13] youth there'll be hurts there'll be
[1:49:14] things that will come you have a weak
[1:49:16] Avenue the devil will get in he'll trick
[1:49:17] you into looking at something you
[1:49:18] shouldn't have now a sudden you got
[1:49:20] something in your mind you can't help it
[1:49:22] but the reality is there's still
[1:49:23] wonderful things in the scripture that
[1:49:25] we can if we can apply it can help us
[1:49:27] because if we can't avoid these things
[1:49:28] it's wonderful job says I have made a
[1:49:30] covenant with mine eyes why then should
[1:49:32] I think upon a maid you know if I I
[1:49:35] can't think about a maid unless I've
[1:49:36] seen a maid you know what I'm I think
[1:49:40] you get where I'm going so if you can't
[1:49:42] avoid it in the first place that is
[1:49:43] always first prize and to the young ones
[1:49:44] coming through that by God's grace may
[1:49:46] have been able to prevent it or have
[1:49:48] very limited access as much as you can
[1:49:50] stay away from what Satan's going to try
[1:49:52] and throw at you because the more you're
[1:49:54] going to watch movies the more you're
[1:49:55] going to expose yourself to stuff now
[1:49:57] you're going to think about them why
[1:49:59] because your eyes have seen it the
[1:50:01] doorway to the Mind amen is Through The
[1:50:04] Eyes so be careful what you allow
[1:50:06] yourself and there's just wonderful
[1:50:08] principles you know we talk about
[1:50:09] getting the the white dog to grow and
[1:50:11] that comes these sort of a scriptures
[1:50:12] Draw N to God and He will draw n to you
[1:50:14] amen cleanse your hands ye Sinners and
[1:50:16] purify your heart you double-minded amen
[1:50:19] may the Lord help us why is it
[1:50:20] double-minded because you're allowing
[1:50:22] too much to get in and now there's this
[1:50:23] conviction yes you're a Son of God but
[1:50:25] now all these things you're allowing
[1:50:27] watching all types of things you
[1:50:28] shouldn't be ET we not about the dos and
[1:50:30] don'ts but we just saying you have to
[1:50:31] watch it watch what you expose yourself
[1:50:34] to watch what you
[1:50:36] watch
[1:50:38] amen uh Matthew 6:34 take therefore no
[1:50:41] thought of the morrow amen those
[1:50:43] brothers and sisters I love to cross
[1:50:44] their Bridges before you get there the
[1:50:45] Bible says take no thought of tomorrow
[1:50:47] and this is hard but when those things
[1:50:49] come trying to arest them and say no I'm
[1:50:51] not going to worry about tomorrow this
[1:50:52] is God's problem I will pray about it
[1:50:54] and then I'm going to try and leave it
[1:50:55] and this is something you going have to
[1:50:56] practice over and over before it changes
[1:50:58] you and it can work I'm a testimony it
[1:51:01] can work because the Lord did help me
[1:51:02] with many things because of my thought
[1:51:04] patterns but in this time he can help
[1:51:06] you and the more you do it you'll see
[1:51:07] the easier it becomes for the marrow
[1:51:09] shall take thought of itself of uh of
[1:51:11] the for the things of itself sufficient
[1:51:13] unto the day is the evil thereof Romans
[1:51:16] 8:56 for they that are after The Flesh
[1:51:18] to mind the things of the flesh you see
[1:51:21] you're going to go into the flesh Realms
[1:51:22] and and expose yourself your mind's
[1:51:24] going to go there but they that are
[1:51:25] after the spirit that's what we want to
[1:51:27] be the things of the spirit for to be
[1:51:30] carnally minded is death because it'll
[1:51:32] bring death with it but to be
[1:51:33] spiritually minded aen is life and peace
[1:51:37] amen I'm slowly drawing down to a close
[1:51:39] we starting to land amen blessed is the
[1:51:42] man that walketh not in the counil of
[1:51:43] the ungodly but standeth in the way of
[1:51:45] Sinners nor Seth in the seat of the
[1:51:47] scornful but is the light what is is in
[1:51:50] the law of God Amen put your Delight
[1:51:52] there and in his law do he
[1:51:54] meditate day and night amen as David
[1:51:58] meditated on the Lord let us also find
[1:52:00] ourselves meditating more and more on
[1:52:01] the things of the Lord amen and you can
[1:52:04] expose yourself more and more to it and
[1:52:06] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:52:08] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:52:10] fruit in his season amen his Leaf also
[1:52:13] shall not wither and whatsoever he doth
[1:52:15] shall prosper hey I want to be in those
[1:52:17] shoes may the Lord help us all
[1:52:20] amen and the peace of God which passes
[1:52:22] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[1:52:24] and Minds through Jesus Christ amen
[1:52:27] Christ Jesus finally Brethren and this
[1:52:29] is just such a beautiful thing we need
[1:52:31] to take note of because this is where it
[1:52:33] all comes and finally Brethren
[1:52:35] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:52:37] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:52:40] just whatever things are pure whatsoever
[1:52:43] things are lovely whatsoever things of
[1:52:45] good report if there be any value and if
[1:52:49] there be any praise think on these
[1:52:54] things Lord help us because that is
[1:52:57] where he wants us to be and he knows how
[1:52:59] these things will help us so much in our
[1:53:01] Christian walk because he wants us to
[1:53:03] overcome all aspects of Our
[1:53:05] Lives wherefore GD up the loins of your
[1:53:08] mind now many of us don't know it but it
[1:53:10] was quite interesting when it talks
[1:53:11] about GD up the loins how it would do in
[1:53:14] battle of the Old Testament ging up was
[1:53:16] when obviously they had those long sort
[1:53:18] of a robe things as We Know what it
[1:53:20] would do is they'll take it from the
[1:53:21] back they would sort of push it through
[1:53:23] or vice versa they'll bring it out and
[1:53:25] it'll free up the legs and then they
[1:53:27] would tie the the the their sort of long
[1:53:30] whatever you want to call it robe things
[1:53:32] around their waist and now their legs
[1:53:33] were free so they can jump up rocks and
[1:53:36] everything and slay the enemies and when
[1:53:38] it said go up it was to you know make
[1:53:40] yourself free get yourself ready for
[1:53:42] battle so I believe the Lord was seing
[1:53:44] us yet wherefor G up the loins of your
[1:53:46] mind why cuz you're in a battle you're
[1:53:48] in the greatest battle ever fought F in
[1:53:50] the mind so you need to be ready for
[1:53:51] fighting you need to be ready to go out
[1:53:53] there and tackle it be sober and hope to
[1:53:55] the end for the grace that be brought
[1:53:57] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[1:54:00] Christ as obedient children not fashion
[1:54:02] yourselves according to the former lust
[1:54:04] in your ignorance but as Heath called
[1:54:07] you to be holy so be you holy in all
[1:54:10] manner
[1:54:11] of conversation watch what you say
[1:54:15] because what you say is so powerful let
[1:54:17] it be positive as the brother B says
[1:54:19] speak positive things let that come upon
[1:54:22] you open up your mind that's the
[1:54:27] Battleground there's where the battle
[1:54:29] sets an array right here in the front
[1:54:32] line your mind we in a fight brothers
[1:54:35] and sisters open up and say Amen now you
[1:54:38] say this when things go wrong when your
[1:54:40] mind comes and tortures you every doubt
[1:54:43] I doubt my doubts amen we're going to
[1:54:47] come up against to the spirit of faith
[1:54:49] I'm going to going to doubt my doubts
[1:54:50] amen I'm doubting my doubts now I'm
[1:54:54] believing God's word here I come
[1:54:57] Satan have that attitude here I come
[1:55:00] Satan you're not going to win this mind
[1:55:02] of mine God is going to be the winner of
[1:55:04] this great battle Amen in the mind
[1:55:07] something is going to take place sure it
[1:55:11] will yes sir but you need to be ready to
[1:55:14] fight you have to G up your loins I'm
[1:55:17] coming and I'm going to watch my
[1:55:18] thoughts I'm going to be careful what
[1:55:21] I'm letting into this mind because I
[1:55:23] know what's l in the mind like we saw
[1:55:24] that picture is ultimately filtering
[1:55:26] down amen are we're going to have to
[1:55:28] make sure and it's not as I said about
[1:55:30] dos and don'ts but it's just about
[1:55:32] practical Christian Living if you want
[1:55:33] to overcome in life expose yourself more
[1:55:36] to him so that he can strengthen you
[1:55:38] because I can tell you those are the
[1:55:40] best times amen when I could find myself
[1:55:42] in his presence then that Spirit of
[1:55:44] Victory just comes upon you and it's so
[1:55:46] much easier I want to show you a video
[1:55:48] clip to finish off amen I trust it'll
[1:55:51] work but I saw El's video works so this
[1:55:53] should hopefully also work um I don't
[1:55:55] know if you need a press play or if it's
[1:55:56] something I would have to do just see
[1:55:58] brother if you can get a play going
[1:56:00] there oh there we
[1:56:03] go so you saw the thing but the Braham
[1:56:06] says Christian
[1:56:08] Science Christian Science uh you know
[1:56:11] it's just one part he says you need to
[1:56:13] get that with the word of God and then
[1:56:17] it can come right so here has a bunch of
[1:56:19] metronom is all ticking at different uh
[1:56:22] frequencies but get the word of God and
[1:56:25] get your mind thinking
[1:56:38] right and
[1:56:41] suddenly things will start going a bit
[1:56:43] better how they should and the Lord can
[1:56:46] really work with you and help you Amen
[1:56:48] in your walk but you need to get your
[1:56:50] foundations rested on the right things
[1:56:52] amen don't just be on the mental side
[1:56:55] amen you need to get God's
[1:56:57] word but alas we start drifting we start
[1:57:02] watching all types of things lying all
[1:57:04] types of things into our
[1:57:06] mind well unfortunately it still will
[1:57:09] Resort back to where it was so yeah we
[1:57:11] got everything go wonderful in Unis well
[1:57:14] let's stop thinking about the Lord let's
[1:57:15] start stop watching what we
[1:57:18] think
[1:57:25] and
[1:57:26] suddenly we become
[1:57:28] double-minded in our hearts
[1:57:34] again amen may the Lord help us all amen
[1:57:38] amen because it's so easy these things
[1:57:40] can happen but with God's grace I
[1:57:42] believe he can help us and he's called
[1:57:43] us for it brother s like we said last
[1:57:45] weekend we are called for a high calling
[1:57:47] he would not have required this of us
[1:57:49] unless he gave you the tools to use it
[1:57:52] amen so we need to we need to we need to
[1:57:54] Amen Let the the white dog become big in
[1:57:57] our loves amen feed that white dog make
[1:57:59] time for God we SP to the youth talks
[1:58:02] about read a chapter you know of the
[1:58:04] Bible in the morning and if the evening
[1:58:05] if you can't you know just put on 20
[1:58:07] minutes surely we can spare 20 minutes a
[1:58:09] day listening to the prophet amen you
[1:58:11] know can you not just give God 20 or 30
[1:58:13] minutes of your time in prayer you know
[1:58:14] I said to the youth uh you know even
[1:58:16] when I've been in my worst times I got
[1:58:18] such a kick out of just getting on my
[1:58:21] knees in my worst possible condition cuz
[1:58:23] I knew the prophet said that when a the
[1:58:24] worst weakest sinner gets on his knees
[1:58:27] all of hell trembles and it was just so
[1:58:29] nice to get one back on the devil you
[1:58:31] know and he had got me down amen so may
[1:58:34] the Lord help us in the road ahead may
[1:58:35] you help us with our thinking may we
[1:58:37] learn to guard our thoughts to Be
[1:58:39] watchful of our mind amen and that's
[1:58:42] something you're going to have to train
[1:58:44] and start to be cognizant start thinking
[1:58:46] about what you think amen that he can
[1:58:49] renew your mind and change your mind by
[1:58:51] his grace amen let's just bow in a word
[1:58:54] of prayer amen dear gracious and wonder
[1:58:57] Heavenly Father Lord Lord the things we'
[1:58:59] spoken about tonight Lord yes it's easy
[1:59:01] and principle Lord but you know we
[1:59:03] fighting a real war Lord and like the
[1:59:05] prophet said it's the greatest battle
[1:59:07] ever fought Lord and we know even when
[1:59:09] Jesus was on Earth Lord as he got
[1:59:10] tempted by the devil in the wilderness
[1:59:12] Lord it was on the same basis just

[2:04:45] love amen I trust we've all been blessed
[2:04:48] tonight
[2:04:49] am mean just really practical rubber hit
[2:04:52] the road kind of things just really love
[2:04:55] it and just thank the Lord for speaking
[2:04:57] to us
[2:04:58] tonight um I was just thinking we we
[2:05:01] have a term for some of the concepts
[2:05:02] that brother Michael shared and uh one
[2:05:05] of the terms that I spoke about a little
[2:05:07] while ago is self-fulfilling prophecy
[2:05:10] you know when we confess and we think in
[2:05:12] a some negative way we start living as
[2:05:15] if it's already true and we actually can
[2:05:17] cause those things to happen because of
[2:05:19] her attitude about
[2:05:22] it Hallelujah the other thing that that
[2:05:24] that really stands out to me also
[2:05:28] is every time we allow our minds to go
[2:05:31] down paths that they shouldn't we should
[2:05:34] take it a serious enough to spend time
[2:05:36] with God I often refer to that situation
[2:05:40] where brother randam went all the way to
[2:05:42] to Greens Mill to pray when when Dr
[2:05:45] Davis said nasty things about him and so
[2:05:47] forth and yet yes that was maybe an
[2:05:49] extreme case but brothers and sisters I
[2:05:52] believe it's important for us that you
[2:05:53] know when we catch ourselves thinking
[2:05:55] thoughts going down roads that that we
[2:05:58] shouldn't be going down it's really
[2:05:59] important that we clean those things out
[2:06:02] otherwise all we do is we just put more
[2:06:04] under the hood and more under the hood
[2:06:05] and more under the hood and in the end
[2:06:07] we don't understand why we're battling
[2:06:08] so
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:12] much last comment I would like to make
[2:06:14] is um brother Michael just really opened
[2:06:18] the door
[2:06:19] on on something and and and it's it's
[2:06:22] really good that we that we also see
[2:06:24] this in
[2:06:25] perspective um and that is you know when
[2:06:28] you're a red blooded male you're a red
[2:06:30] blooded male
[2:06:32] but unfortunately and and unfortunately
[2:06:35] some people in this message has used
[2:06:37] that as an
[2:06:39] excuse
[2:06:40] right um I've come across men in this
[2:06:44] message that says well I'm just a red
[2:06:46] blooded male and men are going to last
[2:06:48] after woman or men are going to have a
[2:06:50] desire this that and the other and
[2:06:53] that's utter and total
[2:06:56] nonsense the reaction will be there that
[2:06:59] that I agree with but to nurture it and
[2:07:01] encourage it and think it's okay no that
[2:07:03] part I don't agree with that's something
[2:07:06] we have to fight it's something like
[2:07:08] like we heard tonight you know something
[2:07:10] that when those thoughts come in that we
[2:07:12] bring those thoughts captive how do we
[2:07:14] bring it captive take it to God Amen we
[2:07:18] cannot say and and and and and I will go
[2:07:21] a step further in brother brandom's time
[2:07:24] the whole homosexual scene and so forth
[2:07:26] hasn't gone as far as it is now and and
[2:07:30] I dare say and of course I can't can't
[2:07:32] show you a quote and I can't show you
[2:07:34] scripture but times have changed so much
[2:07:37] that women struggle with exactly the
[2:07:39] same things men
[2:07:40] do women battle the same lustful
[2:07:43] thoughts women battle the same kind of
[2:07:45] mind battles that that men do and and
[2:07:49] it's not any less right or any less
[2:07:51] wrong I mean we should take
[2:07:53] responsibility for those things I love
[2:07:55] the principle be your brother's keeper
[2:07:58] Michael referred to that over the
[2:07:59] weekend you know that's what Abel said
[2:08:01] to God am I My Brother's
[2:08:03] Keeper amen that's the wrong attitude to
[2:08:06] have let's be our Brother's Keeper by
[2:08:08] the Holy Ghost and not not us ourselves
[2:08:10] but let's let's apply the blood to one
[2:08:12] another encourage one another take hands
[2:08:14] with one another amen and let the Lord
[2:08:17] work through us praise the Lord I just
[2:08:19] love it thank you very
