[54:06] we love to praise our god
[54:08] amen he is worthy of our praise
[54:11] amen we're just so thankful and
[54:13] privileged to be able to be here
[54:16] this morning not just to gather with one
[54:18] another but together with the presence
[54:20] of the lord jesus christ and
[54:23] with the revelation of our lord jesus
[54:24] christ amen so it's a real honor and
[54:27] privilege
[54:28] i just want to uh
[54:30] as brother elroy i just want to um
[54:33] thank brother elray for the invitation
[54:36] to um come over with kind of in debt to
[54:39] him a little bit we've had him over a
[54:41] few times now and
[54:42] haven't been able to return the favor
[54:44] and i know it's more than a favor but um
[54:47] i just appreciate your pastor very much
[54:50] brother rey and um
[54:53] just the french friendship and the lord
[54:55] his loyalty
[54:57] and uh he's
[54:59] the gift that god's placed within him i
[55:01] just appreciate it
[55:02] so much it's um
[55:04] it's been a real benefit to our little
[55:06] fellowship back at home
[55:08] and uh you know god places people around
[55:10] you for specific reasons to me
[55:13] to meet specific needs and
[55:15] we may not all see things the same way
[55:18] but nevertheless god
[55:20] has a way of providing people around us
[55:23] to help us encourage us
[55:26] and perhaps even meet the needs in our
[55:29] own lives
[55:30] through the gift that god has placed
[55:32] within us and
[55:35] we understand that as a body it's not
[55:37] just the pastor that has the gifting
[55:40] he's got a gift sure
[55:42] but every member of the body of christ
[55:44] is a gifted member of the body of christ
[55:48] and uh your gift may not be a pulpit
[55:51] ministry and you should be thankful for
[55:53] that
[55:54] but uh
[55:56] but nevertheless um
[55:59] if
[56:00] if god has placed you within the body of
[56:02] christ every member of the body has a
[56:04] part to play in every service
[56:07] whether you're here or not here you know
[56:09] if you're not here not able to be here
[56:11] perhaps you're working
[56:13] you know you can you can still pray
[56:15] while you're working lord just be with
[56:16] the service tonight and you know that's
[56:19] that's how you can
[56:20] help the service be what god
[56:23] ordained it to be because god does have
[56:25] a vision for today
[56:27] god has a vision for this morning and
[56:31] one man can't bring that vision to pass
[56:33] but god has seen who was going to be
[56:35] here
[56:36] who wasn't going to be here
[56:38] but everyone that he saw here this
[56:40] morning
[56:41] he knew they would be here therefore
[56:43] each one of you have a part to play in
[56:46] what the service might be
[56:48] because really we don't know what the
[56:49] service is going to be
[56:51] because what depending on what our
[56:53] sister's need is over here she can she
[56:55] can actually govern what comes out of
[56:57] the minister's mouth by pulling on the
[57:00] gift
[57:01] and then there's a brother over this
[57:02] side and he can go from from a to zed
[57:05] you know from left to right because
[57:07] there's a pull over this side
[57:09] you know it's not that we need to know
[57:12] each other's problems if god knows our
[57:15] issues god knows our needs
[57:18] and this is why
[57:19] we learn
[57:21] to surrender
[57:24] we learn to become the instrument
[57:27] and uh allow god to to to push the notes
[57:31] and
[57:32] and uh govern what comes out of the
[57:34] instrument
[57:35] and uh brother eric certainly been that
[57:38] in our fellowship just a real help
[57:41] uh to the brothers and sisters back at
[57:43] home
[57:44] his precious wife
[57:46] also just a real encouragement to
[57:48] to my wife and
[57:50] um i think if there's ever a wife that
[57:53] needs encouraging it's a pastor's wife
[57:56] but
[57:57] we we thank the lord for the people that
[57:59] he's put us in contact with brother paul
[58:02] god bless you this morning brother good
[58:04] to see you
[58:05] amen praise the lord
[58:07] i don't often catch everyone within the
[58:09] congregation my wife will ask would
[58:11] someone say there this morning and i say
[58:13] i don't know she said well you were
[58:14] standing up the front
[58:17] [Laughter]
[58:22] and then i'll say no she wasn't there
[58:24] and and she'll send a text and say just
[58:25] wondering if you're okay and she'll say
[58:27] no i was there
[58:30] i'm fine
[58:34] i praise the lord amen
[58:37] amen amen
[58:39] well i trust
[58:41] this morning will be a blessing to you
[58:43] and
[58:44] and uh as we discontinue with our a
[58:46] little thought this morning and
[58:48] and um i can only bring what god places
[58:51] on my heart and
[58:52] and um as simple as it might be to me
[58:56] that
[58:56] to me the simple because i'm a simple
[58:58] guy the simple things become really big
[59:01] and uh
[59:02] it's um we understand and
[59:06] how god hides himself in simplicity and
[59:08] reveals himself in the same
[59:11] and uh we just want to allow him to do
[59:13] that this morning so let's stand to our
[59:15] feet
[59:16] and turn to the book of uh john chapter
[59:19] one
[59:21] the thought this morning it's it is a
[59:24] continuation from from last night but
[59:28] just looking a little bit more in depth
[59:31] into
[59:33] um
[59:35] the evening time
[59:37] sacrifice as we saw in first kings 18
[59:41] last night
[59:42] so let's just read from
[59:44] did i say first john
[59:46] i meant john chapter 1 sorry
[59:51] john chapter 1 we'll read from verse 28
[59:56] we read from verse 29
[59:59] the next day john saith jesus coming
[1:00:02] unto him
[1:00:03] and saith behold
[1:00:06] the lamb of god
[1:00:08] which taketh away the sin of the world
[1:00:12] this is he of whom i said after me
[1:00:14] cometh a man
[1:00:16] which is preferred
[1:00:18] before me
[1:00:19] for he was before me
[1:00:23] and i knew him not but that he should be
[1:00:26] made manifest
[1:00:27] to israel
[1:00:29] therefore
[1:00:30] am i come baptizing with water
[1:00:34] and john bear record saying
[1:00:36] i saw the spirit descending
[1:00:39] from heaven like a dove and it abode
[1:00:43] upon him
[1:00:45] and i knew him not
[1:00:47] but he that sent me to baptize with
[1:00:50] water
[1:00:51] the same said unto me
[1:00:54] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:00:56] descending
[1:00:57] and remaining on him the same is he
[1:01:01] which baptizeth with the holy ghost
[1:01:05] and i saw and bear record
[1:01:07] that this is
[1:01:09] the son of god
[1:01:11] amen if we can also turn to luke
[1:01:14] chapter 4 just one verse there the first
[1:01:17] verse
[1:01:24] i thank you for your prayers my
[1:01:27] throat is uh doing very well it feels
[1:01:29] better today than what it did yesterday
[1:01:31] so
[1:01:32] it shouldn't shouldn't be that way but
[1:01:34] it is that way so praise the lord
[1:01:39] and jesus been full of the holy ghost
[1:01:43] returned from jordan
[1:01:45] and was led
[1:01:46] by the spirit
[1:01:48] into
[1:01:49] the wilderness
[1:01:52] romans
[1:01:53] chapter 8
[1:01:56] we'll read
[1:01:58] 13 and 14 no i've just got 14 up there
[1:02:01] but
[1:02:02] we'll read 13 and 14.
[1:02:10] for if ye live after the flesh
[1:02:13] you shall die pretty straightforward huh
[1:02:18] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[1:02:23] the deeds of the body
[1:02:25] ye shall live
[1:02:28] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:02:31] god
[1:02:32] they are the sons of god
[1:02:36] a heavenly father lord we just commit
[1:02:38] this service
[1:02:40] into your hands this morning
[1:02:42] lord god may you accomplish in this
[1:02:45] service lord

[1:02:50] the foundation of the world
[1:02:53] lord we come
[1:02:55] with needs in our lives
[1:02:57] perhaps lord god we come bearing the
[1:03:00] needs of others
[1:03:02] lord god you are the one who can meet
[1:03:04] our every need
[1:03:06] this morning
[1:03:08] lord god is instruments
[1:03:10] set aside for your service lord
[1:03:14] we ask heavenly father that you would
[1:03:16] lord just go forth and
[1:03:18] and use the instruments lord god that
[1:03:21] you have ordained for this time for this
[1:03:24] day
[1:03:24] for this service we pray
[1:03:27] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:03:30] amen you can take your seats this
[1:03:32] morning
[1:03:36] i just want to spend a little bit of
[1:03:38] time here
[1:03:41] in in john
[1:03:43] chapter 1.
[1:03:45] we um
[1:03:46] we understand that
[1:03:48] from first kings 18 that it was an even
[1:03:50] in an evening time sacrifice
[1:03:53] where
[1:03:54] that the lord come down upon
[1:03:57] in 1st kings 18.
[1:04:00] and we understand that jesus also was
[1:04:03] the evening time sacrifice
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:07] as the as the consuming fire came down
[1:04:10] upon the sacrifice that elijah had
[1:04:14] prepared
[1:04:16] according to the word of the lord
[1:04:18] now
[1:04:19] here in john chapter 1
[1:04:23] we have the word of the lord on earth as
[1:04:26] the evening sacrifice
[1:04:29] and the evening sacrifice we pick this
[1:04:32] up here where the spirit of the lord
[1:04:35] again comes down upon
[1:04:37] the lamb of god because this is who the
[1:04:40] sacrifice
[1:04:42] was or was revealed to be
[1:04:45] was the lamb of god behold
[1:04:48] the lamb of god who taketh away
[1:04:51] the sin of the world
[1:04:53] so we understand as there was an elijah
[1:04:55] ministry in first
[1:04:57] kings 18 so now is there an elijah
[1:05:00] ministry on earth here at this time
[1:05:04] through john the baptist the the elijah
[1:05:07] ministry we understand that from malachi
[1:05:10] 3 and malachi 4 but we we want to pay
[1:05:13] particular attention here
[1:05:15] to how or in in
[1:05:18] who he was revealed as because he was
[1:05:21] revealed as
[1:05:23] a lamb of god
[1:05:25] amen the lamb of god not our lamb but
[1:05:29] the lamb of god
[1:05:31] okay be because this is really important
[1:05:34] because if something is of something
[1:05:37] then it has the same characteristics
[1:05:40] the lamb of god had god's
[1:05:42] characteristics because it was of god it
[1:05:46] was the lamb of god
[1:05:48] okay the lamb of god that taketh away
[1:05:52] the sin of the world
[1:05:55] now we understand here also
[1:05:58] that john here
[1:06:00] speaks
[1:06:02] and he wants the people to understand
[1:06:05] that
[1:06:06] how the sacrifice was revealed has been
[1:06:10] revealed
[1:06:11] was not his idea
[1:06:16] because john said i wouldn't have known
[1:06:17] him
[1:06:19] i wouldn't have been able to identify
[1:06:21] him it's not possible it's not me that
[1:06:24] has said these things
[1:06:26] it's not me that has revealed the lamb
[1:06:29] of god i i did not reveal the lamb of
[1:06:31] god it was
[1:06:33] god who revealed himself
[1:06:36] god is the revealer of himself
[1:06:39] yes god can use instruments to reveal
[1:06:42] himself
[1:06:43] god can use nature to reveal himself
[1:06:47] but in this particular time as it was
[1:06:51] in the in the time of first kings 18 it
[1:06:54] was through the elijah ministry that the
[1:06:58] evening sacrifice was revealed
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:03] because in a shadow form in first kings
[1:07:06] 18
[1:07:07] that uh that that sacrifice
[1:07:10] was revealed in the form of a stones
[1:07:14] timber water and ox
[1:07:17] it was that's that was the mind of god
[1:07:20] expressed
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:24] as a as a sacrifice i don't know if i've
[1:07:26] got a let's let me just go forward i'm
[1:07:29] jumping around a bit here but that
[1:07:32] picture that we have here that's the
[1:07:34] mind of god expressed
[1:07:36] because it was revealed to elijah
[1:07:40] and all elijah did was make known what
[1:07:44] god had revealed to him
[1:07:46] none of this was elijah's work
[1:07:50] none of it
[1:07:51] none of it
[1:07:53] every part of it as we can see there i
[1:07:55] have done all these things at thy word
[1:07:59] so all these things everything that we
[1:08:02] could that we saw last night in our in
[1:08:04] our
[1:08:05] service last night it was the mind of
[1:08:08] god
[1:08:09] expressed so now when we come back here
[1:08:13] again there's an evening time sacrifice
[1:08:16] again
[1:08:17] and this evening time sacrifice
[1:08:20] was revealed through an elijah ministry
[1:08:25] very very important to understand this
[1:08:29] okay because
[1:08:31] it wasn't revealed by the clergy it
[1:08:33] wasn't revealed by anyone else it was
[1:08:36] revealed by the elijah ministry through
[1:08:39] an elijah ministry because god does
[1:08:42] nothing but that he reveals it to his
[1:08:45] prophets first and john was the ordained
[1:08:48] prophet for that time and john was the
[1:08:50] one who the forerunner john was the one
[1:08:53] who was going to introduce the evening
[1:08:56] sacrifice
[1:08:57] the lamb of god who was going to take
[1:08:59] away the sin of the world that was his
[1:09:02] duty to introduce
[1:09:04] the the lamb of god to the world
[1:09:07] to the people that were around him but
[1:09:10] someone had to introduce john to the
[1:09:13] evening sacrifice
[1:09:17] someone had to introduce john to the in
[1:09:21] to the sacrifice so that john could
[1:09:23] introduce the sacrifice to you and i
[1:09:28] is that right
[1:09:29] that's that's just exactly
[1:09:31] how
[1:09:32] how it works in verse 33
[1:09:35] john says i knew him not
[1:09:39] but he that sent me to baptize with
[1:09:42] water
[1:09:43] see john had a revelation of his
[1:09:45] position
[1:09:47] john had a revelation of what he was
[1:09:49] called to do
[1:09:51] john had a revelation that he was called
[1:09:53] to baptize with water
[1:09:55] john had a revelation that he was sent
[1:09:57] into the world to fulfill a certain part
[1:10:00] of god's program
[1:10:03] and the same one that sent him was the
[1:10:05] same one who said upon whom ye shall see
[1:10:09] the spirit of god descending and remain
[1:10:11] on him the same is he which baptizeth
[1:10:16] with the holy ghost
[1:10:22] so john was given something to look for
[1:10:26] john was given a a way that he was going
[1:10:30] to be able to identify
[1:10:33] the lamb of god
[1:10:34] and that was through the spirit of god
[1:10:37] descending upon him
[1:10:39] and
[1:10:40] remaining
[1:10:45] not an anointing
[1:10:48] that came and went
[1:10:50] but came upon him
[1:10:53] and remained
[1:10:56] amen this was the
[1:10:58] identification
[1:11:00] of the lamb
[1:11:01] this is how the lamb
[1:11:03] was identified
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] and the sons and daughters of god are
[1:11:10] they that are led by the spirit of god
[1:11:13] amen the identification of the bride
[1:11:17] is when the spirit of god descends upon
[1:11:20] her and remains that's the
[1:11:22] identification of the bride
[1:11:26] but the lord jesus here he was he was
[1:11:30] revealed as the lamb of god
[1:11:34] the dove coming down upon the lamb like
[1:11:36] the fire coming down
[1:11:38] upon the sacrifice
[1:11:41] because
[1:11:43] the sacrifice
[1:11:47] sorry
[1:11:48] solomon got the hang of this one
[1:11:51] the sacrifice
[1:11:53] couldn't do anything of itself
[1:12:02] the spirit of god needed to come down
[1:12:04] upon the sacrifice the consuming fire
[1:12:08] and it was through this union
[1:12:12] that the sacrifice achieved
[1:12:16] what it was able to achieve what it was
[1:12:18] sent to achieve
[1:12:21] without the union the sacrifice could
[1:12:24] not achieve what it was ordained to
[1:12:27] achieve
[1:12:29] jesus now been filled with the holy
[1:12:31] ghost was led into the into the desert
[1:12:36] to be tempted
[1:12:38] when jesus comes after that period he
[1:12:41] comes forth in my own words he says now
[1:12:44] i am anointed to preach the gospel
[1:12:49] so now he was because there was a union
[1:12:52] between the the the
[1:12:54] because there was a union between the
[1:12:57] lamb and the dove
[1:12:59] the sacrifice and the consuming fire now
[1:13:02] he was anointed to preach the gospel
[1:13:06] now he was able
[1:13:08] to go forward
[1:13:11] in the power of the spirit of god
[1:13:14] and accomplish the things
[1:13:17] that he was sent to accomplish
[1:13:23] as the lamb of god
[1:13:27] because we find as we did last night
[1:13:29] that the people were at a crossroad they
[1:13:32] were they were lame they couldn't move
[1:13:34] forward well this is the same
[1:13:37] exact same scenario here that the people
[1:13:40] were now were now at a place that unless
[1:13:43] god done something
[1:13:45] then they just continue in their
[1:13:47] traditional traditional ways
[1:13:49] continual you know monday tuesday is
[1:13:52] monday and wednesday is monday and
[1:13:54] thursday is monday and ever it's just
[1:13:56] the same stuff different day
[1:13:59] but but god wanted them to enter into a
[1:14:02] another dispensation where they didn't
[1:14:05] have to do the things that were once
[1:14:08] required of them he was going to bring
[1:14:10] them into a new day
[1:14:12] and the thing that was going to bring
[1:14:14] them into a new day was the revelation
[1:14:18] of the sacrifice
[1:14:20] the revelation of jesus christ will
[1:14:23] bring you into a new day the revelation
[1:14:26] of jesus christ here will bring was
[1:14:29] going to bring the people into a new day
[1:14:33] a new opportunity monday tuesday doesn't
[1:14:36] have to be a repeat of monday this is a
[1:14:39] new day amen this is a day that the lord
[1:14:42] has made and i know we just say that
[1:14:45] flippantly but it means so much
[1:14:47] when you receive a revelation of jesus
[1:14:50] christ it it brings you into a new day
[1:14:53] it's like you step into another
[1:14:55] dimension it's like you step into
[1:14:57] another world and it today is not the
[1:15:00] same as yesterday through the revelation
[1:15:03] of jesus christ
[1:15:14] we see here
[1:15:17] in the green there hope you can see that
[1:15:19] okay yeah it's pretty clear up there
[1:15:21] it's good
[1:15:22] in the green elijah's prayer was
[1:15:26] that
[1:15:27] that the god in israel would be revealed
[1:15:35] and we
[1:15:37] we also see here that
[1:15:40] john
[1:15:43] revealed someone
[1:15:45] who was present
[1:15:50] okay go elijah's prayer was not lord
[1:15:54] show the people that thou art the god of
[1:15:56] israel even though he was
[1:15:59] but more specifically
[1:16:01] god in israel
[1:16:04] amen and when elijah here
[1:16:08] by the spirit of god was able to
[1:16:11] reveal
[1:16:13] the evening sacrifice
[1:16:16] he revealed the evening sacrifice as
[1:16:19] someone who was present
[1:16:21] behold
[1:16:24] the lamb of god
[1:16:25] and perhaps the people who were standing
[1:16:28] around turned to look for a lamb and saw
[1:16:32] this carpenter's son
[1:16:34] walking down
[1:16:36] to john
[1:16:38] and they they they look back at john and
[1:16:40] john still had his hand out
[1:16:42] and they're trying they're looking past
[1:16:45] the carpenter's son
[1:16:46] the la the lamb of god
[1:16:49] the the
[1:16:50] get out of the way the lamb of god
[1:16:52] no he he was revealing someone who was
[1:16:55] present
[1:16:57] amen and god wants his presence
[1:17:00] known amen and because it's vitally
[1:17:04] important
[1:17:06] because it's it's the revelation of his
[1:17:09] presence
[1:17:10] that allows us to step into a new day
[1:17:14] not not a theological
[1:17:16] revelation of jesus christ
[1:17:19] but a revelation of jesus christ being
[1:17:22] present
[1:17:24] here amongst us
[1:17:26] amen not not just in letter form
[1:17:29] but in a living form
[1:17:31] amen because it's in the living form
[1:17:34] that allows you it's a revelation of the
[1:17:36] living form of
[1:17:38] jesus christ that allows you to step
[1:17:41] into a new day it it allows you to do
[1:17:45] things it allows things to happen in
[1:17:48] your life that you've wanted to happen
[1:17:50] for a long time
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:53] if you've been there we'll all say amen
[1:17:56] to that amen it allows things to happen
[1:17:59] in your life that you've wanted to
[1:18:01] happen in your life for a long time
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] because god has a purpose for each
[1:18:09] and every single one of us
[1:18:12] and it was through this revelation
[1:18:15] that was going to allow
[1:18:18] the people
[1:18:19] to move forward
[1:18:23] in god's program
[1:18:27] amen
[1:18:30] so the lord the lord was there
[1:18:34] but at 30 years old he was identified
[1:18:40] by or through an elijah ministry
[1:18:46] you can kind of imagine that
[1:18:49] what the people may have been thinking
[1:18:52] when the revelation struck them
[1:18:56] i mean
[1:18:57] he he works at joseph's carpenter's shop
[1:19:03] you know and trying to connect
[1:19:06] the lamb of god with the
[1:19:09] the natural side was a struggle
[1:19:12] for the people
[1:19:14] well it's just the same today
[1:19:18] it hasn't changed
[1:19:19] and i'm a carpenter
[1:19:23] but i'm a son of god
[1:19:25] yeah and i'm not saying that it's
[1:19:27] difficult for you it might be i don't
[1:19:29] know but it's difficult for me to come
[1:19:31] to terms
[1:19:33] with what god has spoken of me
[1:19:37] amen because it's not your revelation of
[1:19:39] me that helps me
[1:19:42] but it must be a personal revelation to
[1:19:45] me
[1:19:46] and it's me that struggles to connect
[1:19:48] the natural with the spiritual
[1:19:51] as it was in that day as they looked at
[1:19:53] jesus said this is joseph's son and now
[1:19:55] john the baptist the elijah ministry
[1:19:58] praise god we know who elijah is we know
[1:20:00] what he was sent for and now he's always
[1:20:03] said that there was coming one
[1:20:05] in whom shoe shoe latches i'm not worthy
[1:20:08] to loose and now he points him out and
[1:20:11] this is not what i was expecting
[1:20:14] [Laughter]
[1:20:16] you understand you see you see the
[1:20:18] struggle here when the when the
[1:20:20] revelation of jesus christ comes
[1:20:22] brethren said when the word is opened a
[1:20:24] war starts
[1:20:25] a war begins
[1:20:27] you know and when the revelation of
[1:20:28] jesus christ strikes
[1:20:31] a war starts
[1:20:33] amen but it's not me battling against
[1:20:34] you or you battling against me it's me
[1:20:36] battling against me
[1:20:38] yeah it's me battle against me trying to
[1:20:41] come to terms with what god has spoken
[1:20:44] and you know then we go down this track
[1:20:46] of trying to look for some evidence that
[1:20:48] will justify what elijah said and da da
[1:20:50] da da da and we end up you know
[1:20:53] we end up lost somewhere and what what
[1:20:55] god wants us to do is just to accept
[1:20:59] his word
[1:21:00] and allow him
[1:21:02] to reveal
[1:21:04] what he has spoken
[1:21:06] to us
[1:21:07] personally
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:11] so we just want to allow god to reveal
[1:21:14] himself here
[1:21:17] this morning
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:23] i hope i'm not standing on a bit of
[1:21:25] dangerous ground here but brother elrey
[1:21:27] and i are good mates and
[1:21:29] if if i if i'm wrong in any way
[1:21:33] i'd give brother ellery full liberty to
[1:21:36] to
[1:21:37] come and
[1:21:38] um
[1:21:40] correct me or what whatever whatever is
[1:21:43] necessary
[1:21:44] but it's very interesting to me
[1:21:48] people's ideas
[1:21:51] on
[1:21:52] or of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:21:58] and this is just my thoughts okay but
[1:22:00] personally
[1:22:02] i think
[1:22:03] unknowingly hollywood
[1:22:06] has influenced
[1:22:08] our imagery
[1:22:10] of what jesus christ
[1:22:12] looks like today or looked like then
[1:22:16] and um i don't say that critically
[1:22:19] but i
[1:22:21] you know
[1:22:22] there's so many superheroes
[1:22:25] today and you know they they wear the
[1:22:28] cape and they wear the
[1:22:29] the s on the front or whatever it might
[1:22:32] be and some form of have some
[1:22:35] super power that
[1:22:36] identifies them and makes them possible
[1:22:39] to be able to do things that no one else
[1:22:42] can do and everyone becomes reliant upon
[1:22:46] a superhero and yet god is my
[1:22:50] god is my superhero
[1:22:52] there's no question about that but what
[1:22:54] i'm saying is that the imagery that we
[1:22:57] have
[1:22:58] of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:02] i believe for myself speaking from
[1:23:04] experience
[1:23:05] that it can become
[1:23:07] distorted
[1:23:08] it can become
[1:23:10] something that it's not meant to be
[1:23:12] because of a outside influence
[1:23:16] that comes
[1:23:18] as a result of being in this world
[1:23:20] yeah and i
[1:23:22] i don't go to the movies just in case
[1:23:23] you're wondering but you know you can't
[1:23:26] help but
[1:23:27] but um but come in contact with
[1:23:29] hollywood you don't have to go to the
[1:23:31] movies to come in contact with hollywood
[1:23:34] but um
[1:23:37] but
[1:23:38] through the revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:43] and through this by the spirit of god
[1:23:47] we we want to know him exactly as he is
[1:23:51] known
[1:23:55] because he has revealed himself
[1:23:59] the same as he revealed himself god
[1:24:02] revealed the evening time sacrifice
[1:24:05] to elijah
[1:24:07] and god has also revealed the evening
[1:24:10] time sacrifice in this hour
[1:24:14] through an elijah ministry
[1:24:16] but we want to focus this morning
[1:24:19] on the the lamb of god here
[1:24:22] we see here that
[1:24:25] that the lamb of god i know this is very
[1:24:28] um
[1:24:29] obvious
[1:24:30] but it
[1:24:32] it's important
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:35] he was revealed the lamb of god was
[1:24:38] revealed as a man
[1:24:42] a lamb
[1:24:43] but a man
[1:24:44] which means he was a ram
[1:24:50] because redemption comes through the
[1:24:53] mail
[1:24:57] it could he he couldn't he at this
[1:25:00] stage of his ministry
[1:25:03] he couldn't be revealed as
[1:25:06] the the female
[1:25:08] sheep
[1:25:09] or female lamb he had to be revealed as
[1:25:13] the male lamb
[1:25:16] he had to be revealed as the boaz
[1:25:20] amen because boaz
[1:25:24] this was a part of his ministry
[1:25:27] but this part of his ministry he had to
[1:25:31] fulfill this part of his ministry
[1:25:34] as a ram
[1:25:37] it was a ram that was caught in the
[1:25:39] thicket
[1:25:40] when abraham went to sacrifice isaac
[1:25:44] it wasn't a u
[1:25:46] e w e
[1:25:48] i like that it wasn't a u
[1:25:54] it was a ram
[1:25:56] amen because the
[1:25:58] redemption could only come through the
[1:26:01] mail it can only come through
[1:26:03] the ram so it was the ram
[1:26:07] that that died in isaac's place
[1:26:12] it made it possible for eyes for abraham
[1:26:15] to remove isaac off the altar
[1:26:19] and take the provided sacrifice
[1:26:22] the ram and place it on the altar
[1:26:26] and the ram become the sacrifice
[1:26:30] instead of isaac
[1:26:32] okay so there was a a part of the
[1:26:35] ministry part of our lord jesus christ
[1:26:38] ministry
[1:26:39] that could that could only
[1:26:41] be fulfilled
[1:26:43] in a male context
[1:26:47] as a
[1:26:48] realm because the revelation of jesus
[1:26:52] christ continues
[1:26:54] today
[1:26:55] but the revelation of jesus christ today
[1:26:59] is not
[1:27:00] as a ram
[1:27:01] but as a you
[1:27:07] but this portion of his ministry
[1:27:11] could not be fulfilled as a you
[1:27:15] it could only be fulfilled as a ram
[1:27:20] so he was a lamb
[1:27:22] but he was a male lamb he was
[1:27:24] a ram
[1:27:27] this lamb the lamb of god
[1:27:31] was without blemish
[1:27:34] is that right
[1:27:36] he had no fault no fault was found in
[1:27:39] him
[1:27:41] and it's not that they
[1:27:44] couldn't find a fault
[1:27:48] they couldn't find the fault
[1:27:51] there was no fault to find
[1:27:56] it didn't matter how long they examined
[1:27:59] him
[1:28:02] there was no fault to find
[1:28:06] so he was not faultless because his
[1:28:09] fault was hidden behind something
[1:28:12] there was no fault to find
[1:28:16] he was examined but it didn't matter how
[1:28:19] long they examined him for they would
[1:28:22] have never have found a fault because
[1:28:25] there was no fault
[1:28:28] he was the perfect
[1:28:30] lamb of god
[1:28:32] amen he had to be the perfect lamb of
[1:28:36] god in order to take away the sin
[1:28:39] of the world
[1:28:41] amen so this is a beautiful picture we
[1:28:44] have here
[1:28:45] jesus christ represented as the lamb of
[1:28:49] god
[1:28:50] as the lamb and god the father as the
[1:28:54] dove by these two figures
[1:28:58] god chose to identify himself
[1:29:09] not himself
[1:29:12] himself
[1:29:15] by
[1:29:16] the union of these two he chose to
[1:29:19] reveal himself
[1:29:23] these two became one
[1:29:26] these two became one through a union and
[1:29:30] now god was going to
[1:29:33] reveal himself
[1:29:39] just read you something here
[1:29:43] how beautiful it's typed here as jesus
[1:29:46] being the lamb
[1:29:49] and god being the dove
[1:29:52] and the dove would not have settled on a
[1:29:54] wolf
[1:29:55] his nature's not right
[1:29:59] it couldn't have settled on a dog
[1:30:01] his nature's not right
[1:30:04] it had to be on a lamb
[1:30:08] the two natures
[1:30:10] are the same
[1:30:12] the two natures had to be the same
[1:30:15] and that's the way we have to
[1:30:18] be our natures has to be changed
[1:30:23] from the roaring sinner
[1:30:27] to the meekness of a lamb
[1:30:32] amen our natures has to be changed our
[1:30:37] natures
[1:30:38] has to be changed from the roaring
[1:30:41] sinner
[1:30:42] to the meekness
[1:30:44] of a lamb
[1:30:46] and did you notice the dove led the lamb
[1:30:52] and notice the lamb forfeited everything
[1:30:56] he had to the dove
[1:31:01] the lamb knew his position
[1:31:06] youth
[1:31:07] he reigned
[1:31:10] in his position
[1:31:13] as a
[1:31:14] lamb
[1:31:16] the lamb forfeited everything he had to
[1:31:20] the dove
[1:31:22] and look where the dove led him
[1:31:26] to crucifixion of for the sins of us all
[1:31:33] now the dove god wanted to represent his
[1:31:36] son he represented he was represented by
[1:31:40] the most cleanest and meekest animal
[1:31:43] on the earth
[1:31:45] a earth-bound creature
[1:31:53] a earth-bound creature
[1:31:57] but when god represented himself in the
[1:32:00] heavens was by the meekest and most
[1:32:03] cleanest bird there is in the heavens a
[1:32:06] dove
[1:32:10] so god represented his son
[1:32:13] as a lamb
[1:32:15] and he represented himself
[1:32:19] as the dove
[1:32:22] and the dove and the lamb
[1:32:25] we're going to come together in a union
[1:32:33] so
[1:32:39] the groom
[1:32:42] is a lamb
[1:32:46] because the lamb of god was our groom
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:52] he's my husband
[1:32:55] he's my boaz
[1:32:58] and he had to come forth and pay the
[1:33:01] price
[1:33:02] for
[1:33:03] my redemption
[1:33:05] amen so he came forth as a lamb
[1:33:11] the groom is a lamb
[1:33:14] my husband is a lamb
[1:33:19] you ever wonder why it says the marriage
[1:33:21] of the lamb
[1:33:25] has come
[1:33:27] not marriage of the lambs
[1:33:31] marriage of the lamb the marriage of the
[1:33:33] lamb has come the groom was a lamb
[1:33:40] the lamb of god will marry
[1:33:43] a lamb of god
[1:33:48] because god will not unequally yoke
[1:33:50] himself
[1:33:52] he can only join himself to something
[1:33:55] that is a part of him
[1:33:59] amen so the lamb of god is going to
[1:34:02] marry a lamb of god
[1:34:05] the lamb of god is is in it the groom
[1:34:09] is the ram the lamb of god as a bride is
[1:34:13] a you
[1:34:16] and through the through this union
[1:34:19] something is going to be produced
[1:34:24] he cannot join himself with something
[1:34:27] that is not a part of himself and this
[1:34:29] is very significant here because their
[1:34:31] natures were the same the nature of the
[1:34:34] lamb and the nature of the dove were the
[1:34:36] same and this is why there could be a
[1:34:39] union and there's going there is a union
[1:34:41] between the bride and the groom today
[1:34:44] and the reason that there's a union the
[1:34:46] way that there's a union is because the
[1:34:49] nature of the bride is the same nature
[1:34:51] of the groom the the nature of the the
[1:34:54] groom has taken on the nature of the
[1:34:57] lamb
[1:34:58] the nature of her
[1:35:00] groom
[1:35:03] the bride has taken on the nature
[1:35:08] of the groom
[1:35:11] what a magnificent thought
[1:35:14] you know these things about being
[1:35:16] unequally yoked you know we we can apply
[1:35:19] them to our natural lives but we've got
[1:35:21] to understand that there's a spiritual
[1:35:24] application to these things as well and
[1:35:27] there's a mystery behind it
[1:35:36] as adam married eve
[1:35:40] who was a part of him
[1:35:45] really what adam was doing was marrying
[1:35:48] a part of himself
[1:35:52] because he couldn't marry any other part
[1:35:56] he could only marry a part of himself
[1:36:00] and the second adam can only marry a
[1:36:03] part of himself really he is marrying a
[1:36:06] part of himself
[1:36:09] because when he went to calvary as the
[1:36:11] prophet says
[1:36:13] male and female husband and wife
[1:36:16] bride and groom had not been separated
[1:36:18] yet
[1:36:20] but there came a place of separation
[1:36:22] there came a time of separation but the
[1:36:25] separation doesn't change our
[1:36:27] characteristics he's coming back for his
[1:36:30] own he's redeeming his own he's marrying
[1:36:34] his own he's yoking himself with his own
[1:36:44] what the groom is
[1:36:45] the bride is
[1:36:53] if he is a lamb the bride has to be a
[1:36:56] lamb
[1:37:00] because he's not going to marry a goat
[1:37:08] he will only marry a part of himself
[1:37:13] that's why the woman is a revelation to
[1:37:15] the man
[1:37:19] the man has a revelation of her
[1:37:22] the man has a revelation of his wife
[1:37:26] and he goes forward and declares that
[1:37:29] revelation
[1:37:31] will you marry me that's that's his
[1:37:33] revelation expressed
[1:37:37] and god has a revelation of you
[1:37:42] and he comes to you and and asks you
[1:37:46] will you go
[1:37:50] why because the rebecca she's a
[1:37:52] revelation
[1:37:54] to isaac
[1:37:58] and you are a revelation
[1:38:01] to your groom
[1:38:06] and then through that
[1:38:11] he becomes a revelation to us
[1:38:15] it's two things meeting together two
[1:38:17] revelations coming together
[1:38:19] the marriage of the lamb
[1:38:24] the marriage of the lamb
[1:38:29] husband and wife
[1:38:31] the marriage of the lamb
[1:38:33] two people standing up at the altar the
[1:38:35] marriage of the lamb
[1:38:38] not the marriage of the lambs no it's
[1:38:40] the marriage of the lamb
[1:38:43] she is just a mystery that has been
[1:38:45] revealed and taken from him but she is
[1:38:48] still a part of him it's a marriage of
[1:38:50] the lamb
[1:38:57] why it had to be shepherds they said
[1:38:59] john
[1:39:00] how did you know it
[1:39:02] i didn't see one thing different
[1:39:05] but i bear record i saw the spirit of
[1:39:08] god descending like a dove and a voice
[1:39:10] saying this is my beloved son in whom i
[1:39:14] am pleased to dwell in
[1:39:18] watch the dove and the lamb
[1:39:22] see yeah what what if it had been what
[1:39:25] if it had been something what if it had
[1:39:28] been a wolf standing there
[1:39:30] well the lamb could not have went down
[1:39:34] or that dove
[1:39:36] god symbolizing himself with a dove
[1:39:39] the most meekest of all the birds of
[1:39:42] heaven
[1:39:43] his son
[1:39:44] by a sheep
[1:39:48] the most meekest of all the animals on
[1:39:50] earth see
[1:39:52] the clean bird of the heavens not a crow
[1:39:55] not a vulture but a dove
[1:39:58] not a pig
[1:39:59] but a lamb
[1:40:01] any other nature
[1:40:04] wouldn't have blended together
[1:40:09] the same natures
[1:40:11] were coming together
[1:40:15] notice when the dove came down upon the
[1:40:17] lamb it led him
[1:40:22] not the way he would
[1:40:27] but the way the father would lead him
[1:40:36] interesting huh
[1:40:38] the perfect lamb of god
[1:40:41] the lamb of god who had no blemish
[1:40:45] needed to be led
[1:40:47] yeah yes
[1:40:48] he needed to be led
[1:40:51] according
[1:40:53] to the will
[1:40:55] of his father
[1:40:59] it led him
[1:41:02] not the way he would
[1:41:09] sons and daughters of god are they that
[1:41:10] are led by the spirit of god not the way
[1:41:14] i would
[1:41:17] but the far the way the father would
[1:41:23] this is particularly incredible when you
[1:41:25] think about
[1:41:28] this in the context that this lamb
[1:41:31] was the perfect lamb
[1:41:37] the perfect lamb of god without blemish
[1:41:42] needed to be led
[1:41:44] according to the father's will
[1:41:50] wow
[1:41:58] the only way
[1:42:00] the lamb could do what it was called to
[1:42:03] do
[1:42:06] was through the leadership of the dove
[1:42:12] the perfect lamb of god
[1:42:16] could not lead itself
[1:42:20] to fulfill
[1:42:22] its purpose
[1:42:27] because a ca a lamb cannot lead itself
[1:42:33] so there was a purpose between the for
[1:42:36] the union
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:41] and the purpose
[1:42:42] for the union
[1:42:44] is that through the union
[1:42:46] the lamb could be
[1:42:48] what it's ordained to be
[1:42:52] because without the union the lamb could
[1:42:55] not be
[1:42:57] what it was ordained to be and that was
[1:43:00] the evening
[1:43:01] sacrifice
[1:43:06] the lamb was not designed to lead itself
[1:43:13] the lamb was not self-designed
[1:43:18] oh brother
[1:43:19] you give me a
[1:43:21] a blueprint and let me design myself
[1:43:24] you'll have superman
[1:43:30] on my own power
[1:43:32] i can accomplish everything that is set
[1:43:34] before me in my own strength
[1:43:37] oh come on we're all 18 once
[1:43:42] don't try and put your religious jacket
[1:43:44] on and say
[1:43:45] there was a time when dad couldn't tell
[1:43:47] you what to do
[1:43:50] there was a time when mum couldn't tell
[1:43:52] you what to do
[1:43:54] i know i know i was there
[1:43:57] for many many years
[1:44:00] for many years
[1:44:05] the lamb of god there was no way
[1:44:08] for the lamb of god to be able to take
[1:44:12] his position
[1:44:14] his god-given position
[1:44:18] without the leadership of the dove
[1:44:27] this is why when we get the thing i i
[1:44:30] don't i don't need dad's guidance yes
[1:44:32] you do
[1:44:34] sorry
[1:44:35] i don't need mum's guidance yes you do
[1:44:39] sorry
[1:44:40] it's just a fact of life
[1:44:43] and you need to accept that fact
[1:44:48] because god places people around you
[1:44:52] you you may not have the holy ghost
[1:44:56] but even if you have the holy ghost as a
[1:44:59] son you still need your dad as a
[1:45:02] daughter
[1:45:04] mom and dad
[1:45:06] as a daughter you still need mom and dad
[1:45:09] the bible says
[1:45:12] the bible says parents to teach your
[1:45:14] children
[1:45:15] and this is just me okay but i want to
[1:45:17] know when my children don't become my
[1:45:19] children
[1:45:23] i i i don't understand what they're
[1:45:25] married now so
[1:45:28] they're still your children
[1:45:32] you know and then the son gets married
[1:45:33] and says dad i don't need you anymore
[1:45:35] i'm married
[1:45:37] well
[1:45:39] that that's not the case
[1:45:41] my children are always my children
[1:45:44] i don't know i don't care whether
[1:45:46] they're just married they've got two
[1:45:48] dozen kids or their grandparents they're
[1:45:51] still my children
[1:45:55] and i still have a responsibility to
[1:45:57] them
[1:45:59] and and what i what what i
[1:46:02] what i desire what what
[1:46:04] what what we should want
[1:46:06] is for them to have that revelation too
[1:46:10] so that they can come to i said dad
[1:46:13] you know i'm 40. but what do i do in
[1:46:16] this case
[1:46:19] what what do i do here
[1:46:21] you know i don't have a dad to do that
[1:46:23] to
[1:46:25] but i've in a sense i've adopted a dad
[1:46:28] i've got someone that i ring
[1:46:32] and say listen
[1:46:33] what do i do in this case
[1:46:41] the lamb of god the lamb of god
[1:46:46] needed a leader
[1:46:50] so god come down upon his son
[1:46:55] to lead his son
[1:46:57] to the position
[1:46:59] that only the son could take
[1:47:07] jesus as we saw last night was a
[1:47:09] revelation unto himself
[1:47:15] jesus said i
[1:47:16] can of mine
[1:47:19] own
[1:47:19] self
[1:47:20] do nothing
[1:47:28] he was a revelation unto himself
[1:47:34] because he was a part of the revelation
[1:47:37] of jesus christ so he was a revelation
[1:47:39] unto himself and what we need to be is a
[1:47:42] revelation to ourself
[1:47:44] you say no but dan what we need is the
[1:47:46] revelation of jesus christ that's what i
[1:47:49] said
[1:47:54] that is what i said
[1:47:58] jesus was a revelation to himself
[1:48:02] i cannot my own self do nothing
[1:48:10] jesus knew
[1:48:13] his
[1:48:16] weakness hope that's okay
[1:48:22] because
[1:48:24] we put him as a superpower
[1:48:29] but he says
[1:48:30] of my own self i can do nothing
[1:48:37] this is why the revelation of jesus
[1:48:38] christ is twofold
[1:48:44] because there's another part to this
[1:48:46] revelation and jesus knew this
[1:48:48] because he knew if god said for me to do
[1:48:50] something i'll it'll happen it'll it'll
[1:48:53] come to pass
[1:48:54] lazarus come forth
[1:48:56] i can on my own self not do that but
[1:48:58] through the union i can fulfill what am
[1:49:01] i i'm ordained to fulfill on earth
[1:49:04] through the union
[1:49:10] there's so many areas we could go here
[1:49:13] really is we bring this into natural
[1:49:15] lives with with um
[1:49:17] um sons and pa or children and parents
[1:49:21] yeah of of your own self you can do
[1:49:24] nothing
[1:49:25] you need the leadership of your parents
[1:49:28] because god gave you those parents for a
[1:49:30] specific reason just like the church
[1:49:33] needs the leadership of the pastor
[1:49:35] because god honors that position and god
[1:49:37] works through that position so so does
[1:49:40] god work through the mums and dads
[1:49:43] and as children we need to identify this
[1:49:48] we need to identify that god works
[1:49:50] through the office
[1:49:52] god works through mum
[1:49:54] god works through dad
[1:49:58] the reason sometimes we don't go there
[1:50:00] is because we know that
[1:50:02] very true amen
[1:50:04] and we're afraid of what they're going
[1:50:06] to say because what they're going to say
[1:50:08] they might lead you in a different
[1:50:10] direction to what you're currently being
[1:50:12] led
[1:50:14] self-led
[1:50:17] they might have a different idea of how
[1:50:19] things ought to be done
[1:50:24] but with the revelation of jesus christ
[1:50:27] if a child can have a revelation of
[1:50:30] jesus christ for themselves that that i
[1:50:32] that i am a son of god and my my dad for
[1:50:36] example
[1:50:37] he is he is my father he is he has more
[1:50:40] wisdom than what i do yes he does he has
[1:50:43] more wisdom than what i have
[1:50:46] and god will work through that office
[1:50:50] brothers and sisters i'm a testimony of
[1:50:52] that
[1:50:53] you may not even know how to answer
[1:50:55] something but if you can recognize your
[1:50:57] position god will come in and just speak
[1:51:01] some words that he said where in the
[1:51:03] world did that come from and boom it
[1:51:05] just meets the need
[1:51:08] it's it's god honoring his office we
[1:51:11] don't need to know what to say there's
[1:51:13] times where we do study to find out what
[1:51:15] we'd say but there's times when we're
[1:51:17] caught out
[1:51:20] there's times where things come when
[1:51:22] we're not expecting them but god will
[1:51:25] still work through that office
[1:51:27] through that position
[1:51:30] that jesus knew his weakness
[1:51:34] jesus knew his inability
[1:51:43] jesus had an inability
[1:51:45] yeah he did
[1:51:48] jesus said i can do nothing of myself i
[1:51:51] am a lamb
[1:51:53] he didn't say i can do some things
[1:51:57] and i can't do others
[1:51:59] no he said i can do nothing
[1:52:04] you go through the message and and look
[1:52:06] about how brother branham describes a
[1:52:09] sheep
[1:52:10] helpless
[1:52:12] hopeless
[1:52:13] can't lead itself
[1:52:15] can't find its way home
[1:52:19] constantly
[1:52:20] in need of a a leader
[1:52:24] it has an uh
[1:52:26] an infection say on its skin somewhere
[1:52:29] it can't fix it
[1:52:31] it needs a healer
[1:52:34] it needs leadership it needs the
[1:52:35] shepherd to lead it from this pasture to
[1:52:38] that pasture because in this pasture
[1:52:40] there's a certain grass that will help
[1:52:42] its infection he'll lead it from this
[1:52:45] pasture to this pasture or this paddock
[1:52:47] to that paddock because in that paddock
[1:52:49] there's a certain rock that they can
[1:52:51] lick that rock and there's certain
[1:52:53] sulfurs or something in it that that
[1:52:54] help it become healthy again
[1:52:59] jesus said i can do nothing
[1:53:09] of my own self
[1:53:12] jesus was a revelation to himself
[1:53:16] the evening sacrifice
[1:53:19] was a revelation to himself
[1:53:26] the sacrifice in first kings 18
[1:53:30] it's a shadow
[1:53:32] but this is the reality
[1:53:34] first kings 18 couldn't be a revelation
[1:53:37] to itself because none of the parts of
[1:53:39] it were living but when we bring it into
[1:53:41] the reality of what that shadow what
[1:53:44] cast that shadow we realized that the
[1:53:46] revelation of the evening sacrifice had
[1:53:50] to be a revelation to itself because it
[1:53:53] was it was only through being a
[1:53:56] revelation to himself that he was able
[1:53:58] to fulfill his role
[1:54:02] there was no way for jesus to be able to
[1:54:05] fulfill his role unless he was a
[1:54:08] revelation to himself because it was
[1:54:10] through the revelation of the evening
[1:54:13] sacrifice that he was able to be what he
[1:54:17] was ordained to be behold the lamb of
[1:54:20] god
[1:54:24] so the revelation of the evening
[1:54:26] sacrifice is important in first kings
[1:54:30] 18. it's important in john 1 and it's
[1:54:33] important today because the only way
[1:54:36] that we can fulfill our role as a living
[1:54:39] sacrifice is through the revelation of
[1:54:42] jesus christ
[1:54:49] the lamb was designed by god
[1:54:53] to need leadership
[1:54:57] the lamb was designed by god to be
[1:55:00] totally dependent upon the dove
[1:55:09] and there you have the twofold
[1:55:11] revelation
[1:55:13] of jesus christ
[1:55:18] a lamb has no defenses
[1:55:25] it has no teeth
[1:55:27] to bite with
[1:55:30] it has no strength
[1:55:33] to fight with
[1:55:35] it has no horns
[1:55:38] to poke with
[1:55:40] it has no claws
[1:55:42] to scratch with
[1:55:45] it's helpless
[1:55:47] and defenseless
[1:55:50] and again in this area of the sheep's
[1:55:53] life
[1:55:54] it is made it was made to have to rely
[1:55:58] 100 percent upon the dove
[1:56:02] for everything that it didn't have
[1:56:11] the lamb had no defense
[1:56:16] what the lamb
[1:56:17] wasn't
[1:56:19] the dove
[1:56:21] was
[1:56:26] the lamb was going to di sorry the dove
[1:56:29] was going to defend the lamb
[1:56:34] the dove was going to be the lamb's
[1:56:37] strength
[1:56:40] the dove was going to be the lamb's gps
[1:56:45] yes
[1:56:48] because the lamb couldn't lead itself
[1:56:52] the lamb couldn't defend itself
[1:56:57] if the lamb needed protection
[1:57:01] the dove was going to supply it
[1:57:05] if the lamb needed strength
[1:57:08] the dove was going to supply it
[1:57:14] when when the lamb was on its way
[1:57:18] his
[1:57:18] to to fulfill his role on earth
[1:57:22] he got weak
[1:57:26] and god sent
[1:57:27] an angel with a message to strengthen
[1:57:31] him
[1:57:33] what the lamb needed god provided
[1:57:37] amen the lamb was a revelation to
[1:57:39] himself
[1:57:40] the lamb didn't try and provide for
[1:57:43] himself because the lamb was a
[1:57:45] revelation unto himself and that because
[1:57:48] the lamb was a revelation unto himself
[1:57:51] it gave depth to the revelation of the
[1:57:54] dove it gave depth to the relationship
[1:57:58] amen
[1:58:00] amen
[1:58:02] it gave depth to the relationship
[1:58:05] because what the lamb
[1:58:06] couldn't do the dove could
[1:58:10] what ruth couldn't do boaz could
[1:58:14] amen it gave a depth to the relationship
[1:58:18] a so it's not just all about
[1:58:20] relationship but there has to be a depth
[1:58:23] to the relationship that comes through
[1:58:26] the revelation of who you are and who
[1:58:29] you are united with
[1:58:33] amen
[1:58:35] what the lamb
[1:58:38] could not do for himself
[1:58:41] the dove was going to do
[1:58:45] amen
[1:58:46] what ruth couldn't do for herself
[1:58:49] the dove was going to do
[1:58:52] what rebecca couldn't do for herself
[1:58:55] the dove was going to do
[1:58:58] amen
[1:59:00] there's there's no point in a union
[1:59:04] if there's no need for the union
[1:59:08] amen so god designs
[1:59:13] god designs
[1:59:15] there's a purpose behind god's unions
[1:59:23] society
[1:59:26] teaches us
[1:59:29] and causes us
[1:59:32] to not have depth in our relationship as
[1:59:36] husband and wife
[1:59:41] but when god brought adam and eve
[1:59:43] together there was a purpose in that
[1:59:45] relationship
[1:59:48] and what eve couldn't do adam was called
[1:59:51] to do
[1:59:53] amen what eve couldn't do adam was
[1:59:56] called to do but the serpent through his
[2:00:00] subtility deceived eve
[2:00:05] if if satan had to come through adam
[2:00:10] he never would have got to eve
[2:00:13] but the serpent will always come through
[2:00:16] the back door
[2:00:18] he will always try and avoid the
[2:00:20] leadership
[2:00:21] that god has placed over
[2:00:24] whatever it is
[2:00:27] if a boy comes to take my daughter and
[2:00:30] comes through the back door i know what
[2:00:32] spirit
[2:00:35] is causing him
[2:00:37] is is is influencing him
[2:00:41] amen
[2:00:42] absolutely i do because god will not run
[2:00:45] over the top of his own word if the
[2:00:47] spirit of god is in that young man then
[2:00:50] the spirit of god will cause him to come
[2:00:52] through the front door through the
[2:00:54] headship of that woman and not through
[2:00:56] the back door to try and avoid the
[2:00:58] headship
[2:01:00] brothers and sisters we should be able
[2:01:02] to discern spirits in this time just by
[2:01:05] the way that satan works
[2:01:15] what the lamb
[2:01:16] wasn't the dove was
[2:01:21] the union
[2:01:22] had a purpose it wasn't just let's have
[2:01:24] a union no the union had a purpose
[2:01:29] marriage between man and woman had a
[2:01:31] purpose
[2:01:37] because god needed to unite
[2:01:41] with the lamb
[2:01:43] he needed to become the lamb
[2:01:47] in order for to be a redeemer he had to
[2:01:50] become one of us
[2:01:52] in order to be a kingsman he had to
[2:01:55] become one of us
[2:01:58] so this his son
[2:02:00] god came down and abode in his son who
[2:02:04] was a part of him
[2:02:07] and now through that union
[2:02:10] things were going to happen that
[2:02:11] couldn't happen without the union
[2:02:24] the lamb
[2:02:26] was designed
[2:02:29] this way
[2:02:32] the lamb was perfectly
[2:02:35] designed
[2:02:36] by god
[2:02:38] as the sacrifice in first john 18
[2:02:42] was the perfect sacrifice
[2:02:45] it was the mind of god expressed
[2:02:49] with the twelve barrels of water poured
[2:02:52] over it it was the mind of god expressed
[2:02:58] and now there was another evening
[2:03:01] sacrifice
[2:03:02] and this was the perfect sacrifice this
[2:03:06] was the mind of god
[2:03:08] expressed
[2:03:12] and yet that sacrifice
[2:03:14] had weaknesses
[2:03:19] the same as what first kings 18 it had
[2:03:22] weaknesses
[2:03:24] and those weaknesses caused people to
[2:03:27] doubt
[2:03:29] but that's what they're there to do
[2:03:34] but those who are ordained to see past
[2:03:37] the weakness will
[2:03:40] amen
[2:03:42] and what they will see is the perfect
[2:03:44] sacrifice
[2:03:47] because the sacrifice cannot be perfect
[2:03:50] without there being a weakness
[2:03:59] it's glorious
[2:04:02] people looked at jesus and thought
[2:04:05] the lamb of god
[2:04:07] who takes away the sin of the world
[2:04:14] he bleeds like me
[2:04:16] he cries like me
[2:04:19] he he he likes company like me
[2:04:23] he gets tired like me
[2:04:25] he gets a headache like me
[2:04:28] and yet it's the lamb of god that taketh
[2:04:31] away the sin of the world it caused
[2:04:34] people to question
[2:04:39] but there was a little thief on the
[2:04:41] cross
[2:04:44] who looked at the same thing that
[2:04:46] everyone else had looked at and he said
[2:04:48] remember me
[2:04:52] will now enter paradise
[2:04:55] he had a revelation something had struck
[2:04:58] his heart something that had caused him
[2:05:01] to see
[2:05:03] through the weakness the weakness was a
[2:05:05] part of the revelation but he was able
[2:05:07] to see through the weakness
[2:05:13] and see the revelation of jesus christ
[2:05:16] on display
[2:05:20] the groom
[2:05:22] the lamb the ram
[2:05:26] was provided for us
[2:05:31] he was defenseless
[2:05:36] and if the groom is defenseless then so
[2:05:38] is the bride defenseless
[2:05:42] if he is a lamb then she is a lamb
[2:05:47] but she's not a lamb with horns
[2:05:50] she's not a lamb with
[2:05:52] tiger's teeth
[2:05:54] she's not a lamb with tiger paws
[2:05:57] she's a lamb
[2:06:00] we have no defenses
[2:06:05] we are made to rely
[2:06:09] upon the dove
[2:06:11] we have no way of being able to fulfill
[2:06:14] our purpose
[2:06:16] we have no way of even positioning
[2:06:19] ourselves
[2:06:20] in the right position
[2:06:22] so that we can fulfill our purpose
[2:06:26] there's no way that we can be led we can
[2:06:29] say the same thing that jesus said that
[2:06:31] lord i can do nothing
[2:06:34] lord i stand here as a lamb helpless
[2:06:37] defenseless not able to help anyone not
[2:06:40] able to do anything lord i'm dependent
[2:06:43] upon you it brings meaning to the sacra
[2:06:46] to the reunion it brings depth to the
[2:06:49] union
[2:06:57] sheep is the most insecure animal there
[2:07:00] is on earth
[2:07:03] a sheep is the most defenseless animal
[2:07:06] that there is on earth
[2:07:08] and it's made that way
[2:07:12] i know sometimes we like to think that
[2:07:14] we're secure
[2:07:21] and we put on a tough front
[2:07:24] and sometimes to to try and
[2:07:27] show people that
[2:07:29] i've got this
[2:07:31] i'm in control
[2:07:34] you better not mess with me
[2:07:39] you know
[2:07:40] the the little guys walk like this
[2:07:45] the big guys walk like this
[2:07:49] trying to be something
[2:07:52] that they're not
[2:07:55] and the worst thing that a lamb can be
[2:07:57] is try
[2:07:58] is to try and be something that it's not
[2:08:04] a lamb was never meant to defend itself
[2:08:08] but we do
[2:08:12] a lamb was never meant to speak for
[2:08:14] itself
[2:08:17] a lamb was never meant to guide itself
[2:08:23] that's why paul said hey follow me
[2:08:27] as
[2:08:30] i follow christ
[2:08:32] amen he didn't just say follow me
[2:08:36] he said follow me as i follow christ
[2:08:40] because i'm a sheep too i need
[2:08:41] leadership
[2:08:45] but we like to show that we've got it
[2:08:47] together
[2:08:50] but jesus
[2:08:52] himself had no defenses of his own
[2:08:57] the groom had no defense
[2:09:00] of his own
[2:09:07] and jesus said unto him friend wherefore
[2:09:10] thou come
[2:09:12] then came they and laid hands on jesus
[2:09:15] and took him and behold one of them
[2:09:17] which were with jesus stretched
[2:09:20] out his hand and drew his sword and
[2:09:23] struck a servant of the high priest
[2:09:26] and smote off his ear
[2:09:31] this is jesus didn't do this
[2:09:35] it was someone who was with jesus
[2:09:40] someone who thought
[2:09:42] that he could defend
[2:09:44] jesus
[2:09:47] jesus goes on and he says then said
[2:09:49] jesus unto him put up again thy sword
[2:09:52] into his place
[2:09:54] for all
[2:09:55] they that take the sword shall perish
[2:09:58] with the sword
[2:10:01] thinkers thou that i cannot now pray to
[2:10:04] my father
[2:10:07] and he shall presently give me more than
[2:10:10] twelve legions of angels
[2:10:15] and how then shall the scripture be
[2:10:17] fulfilled that this must be
[2:10:22] jesus had access
[2:10:26] to 12 legions of angels
[2:10:29] through his father
[2:10:38] he had no protection of his own
[2:10:42] but he had access to it if needed
[2:10:47] through the right channel
[2:10:51] through his father
[2:10:53] he had protection
[2:10:57] sons
[2:10:59] through your parents
[2:11:00] you have protection
[2:11:03] daughters
[2:11:04] through your parents you have protection
[2:11:12] jesus had no defenses of his own but he
[2:11:15] had the availability to them
[2:11:18] through
[2:11:20] his father
[2:11:26] i like this point here so much
[2:11:30] because jesus
[2:11:32] the lamb
[2:11:34] was secure
[2:11:36] in his weakness
[2:11:41] he was secure in his inability
[2:11:49] in his weakness god was made strong
[2:11:57] he knew
[2:11:58] who he was
[2:12:02] he knew
[2:12:03] what he could do
[2:12:08] right
[2:12:11] think is thou
[2:12:12] that i cannot now pray to my father he
[2:12:15] knew what he could do
[2:12:19] and he knew what he couldn't do
[2:12:22] he knew he couldn't defend himself
[2:12:25] but he had access to someone
[2:12:29] who could defend him so he knew what he
[2:12:32] could do he could pray to the father and
[2:12:35] the father would come down and defend
[2:12:37] the son
[2:12:38] amen
[2:12:44] i like that
[2:12:48] he was secure in his weakness
[2:12:55] this is why
[2:12:57] he could stand and have his beard pulled
[2:12:59] out
[2:13:02] not fight back
[2:13:05] he was smacked on the head
[2:13:07] but didn't hit back
[2:13:09] he was spat at but didn't spit back
[2:13:15] he was verbally abused but didn't abuse
[2:13:18] back
[2:13:23] he stood before pilate
[2:13:25] and said a couple of words
[2:13:28] but there was no reason for him to
[2:13:30] defend himself
[2:13:35] because he knew he couldn't
[2:13:41] this is why when a sheep gets into
[2:13:42] trouble
[2:13:43] there's just panic in the hood
[2:13:46] because it knows it can't defend itself
[2:13:48] and the lamb of god could not defend
[2:13:50] itself and it stood before pilate
[2:13:53] defenseless
[2:14:00] i want to remind you here what we're
[2:14:02] speaking about we're speaking about the
[2:14:04] greatest revelation ever given to man
[2:14:08] the revelation of jesus christ i say
[2:14:11] but then the greatest revelation given
[2:14:13] to man is the revelation of the seventh
[2:14:15] seal that's what i said
[2:14:20] it's the revelation of the dove and the
[2:14:23] lamb
[2:14:24] nobody down it's the revelation of the
[2:14:26] seventh seal that's what i said
[2:14:36] but this is an area that we need to
[2:14:38] understand
[2:14:40] about ourselves
[2:14:44] because what we do
[2:14:48] if we don't understand ourselves
[2:14:52] is that we try and defend ourselves
[2:14:56] with our insecurities
[2:15:01] because the only thing you have
[2:15:06] to defend yourself with
[2:15:09] is your insecurities
[2:15:13] because that's all a sheep has
[2:15:19] it has no claws it has no teeth to bite
[2:15:23] with it it has no it has no this it has
[2:15:26] no that the only thing it has is its
[2:15:29] insecurities
[2:15:33] that's all
[2:15:40] a sheep will always be insecure
[2:15:50] it's it's it's in its nature
[2:15:52] it's in its dna
[2:15:57] the lamb of god
[2:15:59] as was who was born in a manger jesus
[2:16:02] christ
[2:16:04] he was born in a manger because he was
[2:16:07] the lamb of god
[2:16:09] he didn't become the lamb of god in john
[2:16:12] 1 he was always the lamb of god but now
[2:16:14] he was revealed as the lamb of god
[2:16:19] amen and we we are we are lambs of god
[2:16:22] you you don't become a son
[2:16:25] when you receive the holy ghost you were
[2:16:27] always was a son therefore you could
[2:16:29] receive the holy ghost
[2:16:34] but a sheep will always be a sheep
[2:16:38] the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't
[2:16:40] make you something different than a
[2:16:42] sheep
[2:16:45] you're still a sheep
[2:16:48] when when john the baptist when the when
[2:16:50] the dove came down upon the lamb it was
[2:16:53] still a lamb
[2:16:54] yes
[2:16:56] it still had to be led to the pool of
[2:16:58] bethesda
[2:17:00] it had to be led to the subject to the
[2:17:03] individual that god chose before the
[2:17:04] foundation of the world to to be healed
[2:17:07] at that particular time he was led there
[2:17:12] he was he was led away from lazarus tomb
[2:17:15] and then led back
[2:17:17] on the fourth day because it had to be
[2:17:19] on the fourth day couldn't be on the
[2:17:21] third first or second it had to be at a
[2:17:23] particular time my point here is that
[2:17:26] jesus was a lamb from the time he was on
[2:17:28] earth to his departure on earth
[2:17:31] from earth
[2:17:33] he was a lamb
[2:17:35] and in that period
[2:17:39] which is his life on earth as a groom
[2:17:43] he was a lamb he was insecure
[2:17:49] a lamb is always a lamb
[2:17:54] you're a lamb i'm a lamb
[2:17:57] we're always going to be lambs
[2:18:01] sons and daughters of god are they that
[2:18:02] are led by the spirit of god
[2:18:05] not until they receive the baptism of
[2:18:07] the holy ghost no
[2:18:09] for their time on earth
[2:18:17] the insecurities
[2:18:20] that are part of who we are
[2:18:25] were not given to us
[2:18:27] to protect ourselves with
[2:18:33] and yet we use them for that reason
[2:18:44] but this is how sheep hurt sheep
[2:18:50] this is how we try and prove
[2:18:53] who we are to other sheep
[2:18:57] through our insecurities
[2:19:02] i'll show you who i am
[2:19:06] and we try
[2:19:09] and we try to roar like a lion
[2:19:14] but you know what comes out
[2:19:16] that
[2:19:21] john turned to see a lion
[2:19:24] saw a lamb
[2:19:25] well sometimes we try and be a lion
[2:19:29] and you think you're roaring like a lion
[2:19:32] but you know what everyone else is
[2:19:33] hearing
[2:19:34] that
[2:19:41] a helpless sheep
[2:19:47] but in your best effort
[2:19:49] you want everyone around you to let to
[2:19:51] to know that i am a lion and i am in
[2:19:54] control and i am my own leader and i am
[2:19:57] the king of my kingdom and i don't need
[2:20:00] leadership and this and that and this
[2:20:01] and that and all people are hearing
[2:20:04] it's bad
[2:20:07] big difference
[2:20:09] because you're not a lion you're a sheep
[2:20:14] you're designed this way
[2:20:23] because of our insecurities
[2:20:26] this is what we try and portray
[2:20:30] and it shows we need more revelation
[2:20:33] than what we have
[2:20:40] our words our actions
[2:20:43] define us
[2:20:47] they portray us
[2:20:52] oh i wish that guy just know who i am
[2:20:58] no matter what we try to be
[2:21:04] we can never be
[2:21:08] we just need to come to terms
[2:21:11] with the fact
[2:21:13] of who we are
[2:21:18] and the fact is
[2:21:20] we are sheep
[2:21:22] my sheep
[2:21:24] hear
[2:21:25] my voice
[2:21:26] and a stranger's voice
[2:21:28] they will not follow
[2:21:30] but they will follow
[2:21:32] my
[2:21:33] voice
[2:21:35] the only way to the wedding supper
[2:21:38] friends is through leadership
[2:21:42] through the leadership of the dove
[2:21:45] in your life
[2:21:46] you're not gonna get there trying to
[2:21:49] roar like a lion
[2:21:52] remember what brother branham said we
[2:21:54] need to have our natures changed from a
[2:21:58] roaring lion
[2:22:00] to the meekness
[2:22:02] of the lamb
[2:22:06] god designed the sheep this way
[2:22:11] he designed it
[2:22:14] to need
[2:22:15] leadership
[2:22:18] and this is the thing to me personally
[2:22:21] this is an area of influence that the
[2:22:24] world is trying to
[2:22:26] influence the
[2:22:27] the the christians in this time
[2:22:30] just to to be self-led
[2:22:35] do whatever is on your heart brother
[2:22:37] no
[2:22:38] my goodness me lord god forbid
[2:22:42] yeah i i i don't want to do what's on my
[2:22:44] heart
[2:22:45] i i want god to lead me to a place
[2:22:48] that's on his heart
[2:22:57] everything the lamb lacks
[2:23:00] the dove is
[2:23:05] and saints
[2:23:07] you lack everything
[2:23:10] i lack
[2:23:12] as a sheep i lack everything
[2:23:16] so it causes me
[2:23:18] it caused jesus
[2:23:20] to be dependent upon the dove
[2:23:24] to lead him
[2:23:28] through the union of the lamb and the
[2:23:31] dove
[2:23:34] the lamb is now secure
[2:23:40] through the union of the lamb and the
[2:23:43] dove the lamb now has security
[2:23:47] because the dove is the lamb's security
[2:23:53] amen
[2:23:55] it now has protection
[2:23:58] the lamb now has protection
[2:24:02] because the la the dove is the lamb's
[2:24:06] protection
[2:24:07] amen this is why the shepherd sits in
[2:24:10] the door
[2:24:13] this is why the shepherd while the sheep
[2:24:15] sleep
[2:24:17] the shepherd is awake
[2:24:20] because he's looking for the wolves
[2:24:23] that might come in to defile his sheep
[2:24:32] through the union
[2:24:34] through the dove uniting himself
[2:24:38] with the lamb
[2:24:42] now
[2:24:43] it has leadership
[2:24:48] now it has no need to defend itself
[2:24:55] now
[2:24:56] it can be fearless
[2:25:01] now
[2:25:02] ruth can rest
[2:25:07] remember the temptation
[2:25:10] was for ruth
[2:25:12] to open the door
[2:25:14] and go and make sure boaz was doing all
[2:25:18] that he was doing ordained to do
[2:25:21] but naomi said ruth find your position
[2:25:27] be a revelation unto yourself
[2:25:31] and just rest
[2:25:34] because what you are anticipating what
[2:25:37] you are trying to do you can't actually
[2:25:39] do
[2:25:42] that's
[2:25:43] boaz department
[2:25:46] so there was a revelation
[2:25:48] but that ruth had of herself when ruth
[2:25:51] sat back down on that on that chair and
[2:25:54] and rested she was resting in the
[2:25:56] revelation of who she was but she was
[2:25:59] also resting in the revelation of who he
[2:26:01] was in relationship to her
[2:26:04] because what she couldn't do
[2:26:07] even though she was tempted to do it
[2:26:12] like we attempted to defend ourselves
[2:26:17] we are tempted to use our insecurity to
[2:26:20] defend ourselves we've got to come to
[2:26:22] terms with who we are and the fact is
[2:26:25] that we cannot do nothing
[2:26:28] that's the fact that we cannot do
[2:26:30] nothing
[2:26:32] jesus could not do nothing
[2:26:34] but the father what the father showed
[2:26:36] him to do first
[2:26:42] the lamb is
[2:26:44] the lamb finds
[2:26:47] its security through the union
[2:26:50] but it still remains a lamb
[2:26:58] through the union
[2:27:03] or after the union nothing
[2:27:06] that the like when husband and wife get
[2:27:08] married
[2:27:09] it's best if you're a revelation to one
[2:27:11] another before you get married
[2:27:14] that's the best scenario okay
[2:27:17] i would encourage that a lot
[2:27:20] but if you're a revelation to one
[2:27:22] another
[2:27:23] before the union
[2:27:25] what will happen is that that revelation
[2:27:27] will flow
[2:27:29] through the union
[2:27:30] after the union
[2:27:32] but if you're not a revelation to one
[2:27:34] another when you get married
[2:27:36] then you're going to struggle in your
[2:27:38] marriage
[2:27:40] because you're not a revelation to one
[2:27:41] another and how can you fulfill each
[2:27:43] other's needs when you're not a
[2:27:45] revelation to each other
[2:27:48] and then finally
[2:27:49] by god's grace you become a revelation
[2:27:51] to one another
[2:27:53] but my point here is that
[2:27:55] what you are before the relationship you
[2:27:58] are after the relationship
[2:28:02] after the union
[2:28:04] you're just now positioned
[2:28:06] you're a son here you're a son after the
[2:28:09] union but now you're positioned as a son
[2:28:14] so a lamb is always a lamb
[2:28:20] it doesn't make us
[2:28:21] some
[2:28:22] great mighty
[2:28:24] superhero we're still lambs
[2:28:27] in union with the dove
[2:28:32] david said in psalm 23
[2:28:35] he said the lord is my shepherd
[2:28:41] i shall not want
[2:28:44] he maketh me
[2:28:49] to lie down
[2:28:50] in green pastures
[2:28:53] he leadeth me
[2:28:56] beside the still waters
[2:28:59] he restoreth my soul
[2:29:02] he leadeth me
[2:29:05] in the powers of
[2:29:06] righteousness
[2:29:08] for his name's sake
[2:29:13] yea thou i walk through the valley of
[2:29:15] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[2:29:19] why
[2:29:23] for thou art with me
[2:29:27] david was a sheep
[2:29:31] his life on earth was a life as a sheep
[2:29:36] david got into trouble when he began to
[2:29:38] lead himself but his life on earth was a
[2:29:41] sheep
[2:29:43] but david had no need to fear now
[2:29:45] because he was in a union with the dove
[2:29:49] he had no need to fear
[2:29:52] not because he'd become something mighty
[2:29:56] he was still a sheep with the
[2:29:58] insecurities of a sheep
[2:30:02] but the security came through the union
[2:30:07] his security came as a result of the
[2:30:10] union
[2:30:11] what he was feeding on came as a result
[2:30:15] of the union the the his position of
[2:30:19] rest
[2:30:20] came as a result of a union
[2:30:25] it didn't change who he was
[2:30:29] he was a sheep
[2:30:32] in union
[2:30:34] with his protector
[2:30:39] his supplier
[2:30:41] his jehovah
[2:30:43] jireh
[2:30:44] his healer
[2:30:46] thou preparest a table before me in the
[2:30:50] presence of
[2:30:51] mine enemies thou anointest my head with
[2:30:54] oil my cup runneth over surely goodness
[2:30:58] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[2:31:02] of my life and i will dwell in the house
[2:31:05] of the lord forever
[2:31:14] a psalm of david the lord is my light
[2:31:18] and my salvation
[2:31:20] whom
[2:31:21] shall i fear
[2:31:24] david didn't say that david didn't say
[2:31:26] god god has god has changed me and he's
[2:31:28] made me this big thing now and and now i
[2:31:31] have no need to fear because of who i am
[2:31:34] david was a sheep
[2:31:38] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[2:31:42] david was a sheep of of whom shall i be
[2:31:46] afraid the lord is the strength of my
[2:31:49] life
[2:31:52] david didn't go into a phone booth and
[2:31:54] come out of superman and all of a sudden
[2:31:56] have this
[2:31:57] david had this super power no the lord
[2:31:59] is the strength of my life
[2:32:02] david was weak because he was a lamb and
[2:32:05] lambs are weak sheep are weak but now
[2:32:08] through the union through a union the
[2:32:11] lord is the strength of my life
[2:32:17] with him without him i can do nothing
[2:32:20] but with him i can do all things and
[2:32:23] this is this is in relationship to jesus
[2:32:27] christ in john 1 that the lord is the
[2:32:30] strength of my life because he was a
[2:32:32] lamb
[2:32:38] the dove was his strength
[2:32:43] he had no need to fear being a lamb
[2:32:49] why because there had been a union
[2:32:54] heaven and earth had united
[2:32:57] heaven and earth had kissed as brother
[2:32:59] abraham said the greatest event that
[2:33:01] there was on earth
[2:33:04] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[2:33:06] foes come up to eat my eat up my flesh
[2:33:10] they stumbled and fell
[2:33:13] though in host shooting camp against me
[2:33:16] my heart shall not fear
[2:33:18] the war should rise up against me in
[2:33:21] this
[2:33:22] will i be confident
[2:33:24] one thing i have desired of the lord
[2:33:26] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[2:33:28] in the house of the lord all the days of
[2:33:30] my life and behold the beauty of the
[2:33:32] lord and the and to inquire in his
[2:33:35] temple
[2:33:36] for in the time of trouble
[2:33:44] we all have these times
[2:33:48] he
[2:33:50] shall hide me
[2:33:56] remember when they wanted to kill jesus
[2:33:58] and throw him over the cliff and all of
[2:33:59] a sudden he wasn't there
[2:34:07] he is our protection
[2:34:10] because we are sheep
[2:34:13] because he was a sheep he needed
[2:34:16] protection
[2:34:18] by the dove
[2:34:20] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[2:34:22] hide me
[2:34:24] he shall set me upon a rock
[2:34:30] rock is a revelation
[2:34:35] we're not we're not trying to look for
[2:34:37] rocks
[2:34:39] so that we can stand upon them
[2:34:42] we're sheep
[2:34:45] we need to be led to the revelation of
[2:34:48] the word
[2:34:52] he shall set me upon a rock
[2:34:57] as sheep
[2:35:00] jesus had a revelation of himself
[2:35:04] he was led to that revelation
[2:35:07] we are led to that revelation he puts me
[2:35:10] upon a rock a rock that cannot be moved
[2:35:14] upon this rock will i build my church
[2:35:19] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[2:35:22] above mine enemies around about me
[2:35:24] therefore will i offer in his tabernacle
[2:35:26] sacrifices of joy
[2:35:28] i will sing yea i will sing praises unto
[2:35:31] the lord
[2:35:35] oh i like to sing
[2:35:38] my singing is a result of what he's done
[2:35:40] for me
[2:35:42] my singing is a result of what he's done
[2:35:44] in my life
[2:35:45] and brothers and sisters he's done
[2:35:48] everything
[2:35:51] i can't sing praises to myself
[2:35:55] because i haven't done anything
[2:35:59] it's him that done it
[2:36:02] jesus was led to calvary
[2:36:05] he didn't find his own way to calvary he
[2:36:08] was led to calvary
[2:36:13] through this union
[2:36:16] we have moved from an independent life
[2:36:21] to a dependent life
[2:36:26] when we were young we were independent
[2:36:32] but through the revelation of jesus
[2:36:35] christ through this
[2:36:37] union we have moved from a life of
[2:36:40] independence
[2:36:41] to a life of dependence
[2:36:47] once we let ourselves but now there's a
[2:36:50] dove
[2:36:53] once we've defended ourselves but now
[2:36:56] there's a dove
[2:36:59] once we tried to hide ourselves from
[2:37:02] trouble but now there's a dove
[2:37:05] once we spoke for ourselves
[2:37:07] but now there's a dove
[2:37:10] amen once we provided for ourself but
[2:37:14] now
[2:37:15] there's a dove
[2:37:18] amen the revelation of the lamb
[2:37:22] the revelation of the sacrifice
[2:37:27] through the revelation by the revelation
[2:37:30] of the sacrifice
[2:37:34] people were able to move into the next
[2:37:37] dispensation that god had for them
[2:37:42] and i believe it's the same thing in
[2:37:43] this hour that we are living in
[2:37:46] that what is going to cause us to to
[2:37:49] move from this dispensation into the
[2:37:51] next dispensation or this dimension into
[2:37:54] the next dimension is the revelation of
[2:37:58] jesus christ
[2:38:01] and until the body of christ
[2:38:04] receives the pure revelation of jesus
[2:38:08] christ
[2:38:09] then we will not
[2:38:11] move into that next dimension that god
[2:38:15] has for us
[2:38:16] but we cannot move ourselves there
[2:38:18] because we cannot lead ourself to the
[2:38:20] revelation
[2:38:22] we we have to realize like the prophet
[2:38:24] said that we are licked and we need
[2:38:27] leadership in our lives we need the dove
[2:38:30] we need to recognize who we are we need
[2:38:33] to recognize that we are the dove jesus
[2:38:36] had to recognize who he was in order for
[2:38:40] people to be able to move from law into
[2:38:43] that grace dispensation
[2:38:46] and i thank god
[2:38:48] that he was a revelation unto himself i
[2:38:52] thank the lord that he was able to
[2:38:54] identify his weaknesses
[2:38:58] in the revelation of who he was
[2:39:02] and be secure in his weaknesses
[2:39:09] john the baptist said he said behold the
[2:39:11] lamb of god
[2:39:13] and jesus looked at himself
[2:39:16] and said behold the lamb of god
[2:39:25] behold the lamb of god
[2:39:27] that's who i am
[2:39:30] because it was the pure revelation
[2:39:33] of the evening sacrifice
[2:39:38] jesus didn't fight against what elijah
[2:39:40] said
[2:39:44] he accepted it
[2:39:49] because it was the only way
[2:39:51] that he could fulfill
[2:39:53] his purpose
[2:39:55] on earth
[2:39:57] as the ram
[2:40:01] because the ram has a purpose
[2:40:05] and now
[2:40:07] god is
[2:40:09] god what god didn't complete through the
[2:40:12] ram
[2:40:16] he's he's completing through the you
[2:40:26] amen there is no more sacrifice for sin
[2:40:29] needed
[2:40:31] by one sacrifice
[2:40:33] he done that
[2:40:35] you don't have to die for your sin
[2:40:38] and you don't have to die for someone
[2:40:40] else's
[2:40:41] he done that
[2:40:43] but the work that he didn't complete
[2:40:46] there was a portion of his earthly
[2:40:48] ministry he didn't didn't complete as
[2:40:50] the ram
[2:40:51] he's now completing as a you
[2:40:56] that's the purpose
[2:40:58] this is where we are
[2:41:00] but we will not be able to fulfill our
[2:41:02] purpose unless we come to the revelation
[2:41:04] of the evening sacrifice
[2:41:08] romans 12 1
[2:41:11] present your bodies unto god a living
[2:41:14] sacrifice
[2:41:16] you love him
[2:41:18] you're thankful for what he's done for
[2:41:19] you
[2:41:20] amen because we couldn't do our part
[2:41:22] unless he did his part first

[2:42:18] amen our precious and loving heavenly
[2:42:20] father
[2:42:22] lord we
[2:42:23] we are reflecting heavenly father
[2:42:26] upon
[2:42:27] your attitude in life when you were here
[2:42:30] two thousand years ago
[2:42:32] the revelation lord god of
[2:42:34] of what you had of yourself at that time
[2:42:37] and what was accomplished
[2:42:39] through that revelation
[2:42:41] lord god as
[2:42:43] as eve could have looked at adam
[2:42:46] and discovered all that she was
[2:42:48] through the revelation of who he was
[2:42:51] so we lord is your bride
[2:42:54] in this hour
[2:42:55] lord just study
[2:42:57] you at this time
[2:43:00] lord god because truly we can learn who
[2:43:02] we are
[2:43:03] by knowing who you are
[2:43:06] and lord god we want to thank you for
[2:43:08] the honor and privilege lord god of of
[2:43:11] knowing these things
[2:43:13] because lord god these are not things
[2:43:15] lord that are self-learnt or self-taught
[2:43:18] but lord god these things are things
[2:43:20] that are revealed by you
[2:43:23] lord these things
[2:43:25] are supernatural
[2:43:27] [Music]
[2:43:28] and in order for the supernatural to be
[2:43:31] present the supernatural one must also
[2:43:34] be present
[2:43:35] so lord god these things that are you
[2:43:38] have taught us this morning
[2:43:40] lord they are things that declare your
[2:43:42] presence
[2:43:44] because lord god you are the revealer of
[2:43:46] yourself
[2:43:48] lord one can speak but lord god the one
[2:43:51] that speaks lord this this vessel cannot
[2:43:54] reveal you
[2:43:56] it's only you who can reveal you
[2:43:59] and lord god we want to thank you for
[2:44:01] the
[2:44:02] the leadership lord in our lives
[2:44:05] because lord god today holy ghost
[2:44:08] leadership is supernatural
[2:44:10] it's always been supernatural but lord
[2:44:12] god leadership in this hour that we are
[2:44:15] living in particularly lord god at the
[2:44:18] evening time to the gentiles
[2:44:21] it's a supernatural leadership
[2:44:24] and lord god as we begin
[2:44:27] as we are led from truth to truth and
[2:44:30] lord in deeper and deeper in our
[2:44:33] relationship with you
[2:44:35] lord we can only
[2:44:37] we can only have that through leadership
[2:44:41] we can only know you more through
[2:44:44] leadership
[2:44:45] we can only become fearless
[2:44:48] through leadership
[2:44:49] lord we can only become a
[2:44:52] in that position that ruth was in that
[2:44:54] position of rest through leadership
[2:44:57] the lord god let us just consider
[2:45:01] where we stand at this point
[2:45:03] let us consider lord
[2:45:05] am i somewhere have i have i moved
[2:45:07] forward this morning
[2:45:09] in my revelation of jesus christ
[2:45:12] have i am i further in my revelation
[2:45:15] than of jesus christ than what i was
[2:45:17] yesterday
[2:45:19] well lord god your purpose
[2:45:21] for moving us
[2:45:23] lord god is not just so we can say that
[2:45:26] we've been moved but your purpose in
[2:45:29] leading us deeper into your word lord
[2:45:32] god is so that your presence is revealed
[2:45:35] because we cannot be led we cannot lead
[2:45:39] ourself
[2:45:40] but lord god because we have moved
[2:45:43] forward the moving forward of our
[2:45:46] revelation testifies that you are here
[2:45:50] because we cannot lead ourself
[2:45:52] oh lord god we look at the lamb of god
[2:45:55] express lord your son heavenly father
[2:45:58] who hung on that cross
[2:46:00] at calvary oh lord it testifies of a
[2:46:03] leadership
[2:46:05] it testifies there was that there was
[2:46:07] someone
[2:46:08] present in his life
[2:46:10] that led him to that position
[2:46:13] because a lamb is cannot just lead
[2:46:16] itself to the slaughter but a lamb must
[2:46:19] be led to the slaughter and our lamb our
[2:46:23] groom was led to calvary to purchase us
[2:46:27] lord god to pay that price for
[2:46:30] redemption and lord god now we stand
[2:46:33] here as the redeemed
[2:46:36] oh lord god i am redeemed bought with a
[2:46:40] price
[2:46:41] lord you have changed my whole life
[2:46:44] oh heavenly father may we recognize your
[2:46:48] presence here this morning lord god
[2:46:52] maybe recognize your presence lord by by
[2:46:56] the fact heavenly father that you have
[2:46:58] moved us into a deeper relationship lord
[2:47:02] than what we had when we came here this
[2:47:06] morning
[2:47:07] lord god i pray heavenly father that we
[2:47:10] would continue to give you the
[2:47:12] preeminence in our life
[2:47:14] through the revelation lord god that you
[2:47:18] need to be the preeminent one in my life
[2:47:21] because if i am the preeminent one in my
[2:47:24] life lord i will lead myself and whoever
[2:47:28] is following me astray
[2:47:30] oh lord god we give you that position in
[2:47:33] our lives this afternoon lord god we
[2:47:37] understand ourself lord god we are a
[2:47:40] revelation to ourself
[2:47:43] and lord god that revelation calls for
[2:47:46] leadership it calls for a protection it
[2:47:50] calls for security it calls for someone
[2:47:54] to provide for us
[2:47:56] what we have need of oh lord it calls
[2:47:59] for someone the strong one in the
[2:48:02] relationship
[2:48:04] lord god you are the strong one
[2:48:07] in the relationship lord god while this
[2:48:10] world lord goes into its perverted state
[2:48:13] more and more every day lord this bride
[2:48:17] is walking closer and closer into her
[2:48:20] purity through the opening of the word
[2:48:24] and lord god you are the strong one in
[2:48:26] this relationship lord we are the weaker
[2:48:30] vessel here heavenly father and lord god
[2:48:33] may you just continue to watch over us

[2:48:39] this relationship of love lord god that
[2:48:42] you have established with us continue to
[2:48:45] blossom
[2:48:47] like an eternal rose that will never
[2:48:49] lose its glory the lord god's responding
[2:48:53] to the presence of the son in its life
[2:48:56] oh lord god we love you with all of our
[2:48:59] hearts
[2:49:00] lord we need you more than we've ever
[2:49:02] needed you before lord god as things get
