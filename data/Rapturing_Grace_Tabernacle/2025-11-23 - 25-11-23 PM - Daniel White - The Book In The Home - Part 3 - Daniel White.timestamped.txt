[51:51] Yeah.
[51:53] [music]
[51:57] Heat.
[51:59] [music]
[52:01] [singing]
[52:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:17] [music]
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Heat
[52:24] [music]
[52:25] up here.
[52:29] [music]
[52:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:46] [music]
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.
[52:54] [music]
[52:55] Heat. Heat.
[53:02] [music]
[53:09] Jesus, [music]
[53:10] what a beautiful name it is.
[53:14] The name of [singing] Jesus.
[53:18] What a beautiful name it is. [music]
[53:22] The name of Jesus.
[53:30] Hallelujah.
[53:32] We've had a wonderful, wonderful weekend
[53:34] so far.
[53:36] Just a phenomenal word this morning. And
[53:39] I trust that through these things, our
[53:41] relationships change with one another,
[53:44] but also our relationship with the Lord
[53:46] change. Amen. And that it that it
[53:49] becomes just [music] so much more real.
[53:51] I just love those quotes that we had up
[53:53] before the service. Just [music]
[53:55] absolutely beautiful things. Just
[53:57] everything is just coming together. And
[53:59] you know, it's like the Lord is lifting
[54:01] the curtain of of revelation because
[54:04] these things have been there. We've read
[54:05] it for years.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's it's in the Lord's time
[54:10] that he he's showing us who we are.
[54:12] [music]
[54:13] Amen. And I've said it recently in
[54:16] church, but we should stop relating to
[54:19] God as this distance angry father.
[54:21] [music]
[54:23] Amen. He's very close and he really
[54:25] loves us. I was thinking this morning
[54:28] while brother Daniel was ministering
[54:30] um 2,000 years ago Jesus condescended
[54:35] and he hid himself in the last place
[54:38] that people would go look and that was
[54:39] in a little manger
[54:41] &gt;&gt; somewhere in a poor little little town
[54:45] insignificant looking from the outside
[54:48] today that same God is hiding again in
[54:51] the most unlikely place and that is us.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:57] people that [music] the world would pass
[54:58] by and think that can't be it, that
[55:01] can't be the second coming, but it is.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I don't want to take
[55:08] any time. In fact, I will uh just hand
[55:11] straight over to you, brother Daniel.
[55:14] God bless you.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all tonight.
[55:25] Good to be in the presence of the Lord
[55:27] again. Amen. Good to be
[55:32] uh in the presence of the revelation of
[55:36] the hour.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You imagine
[55:41] walking into this, if you put that slide
[55:43] up, you imagine walking into that
[55:45] tabernacle,
[55:47] that synagogue, and knowing who that
[55:49] was.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; My my my. It would put a whole new
[55:53] meaning to going to church, wouldn't it?
[55:54] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that's possible in this
[55:59] hour. Amen. We we come to church because
[56:02] it was our custom and it's what we did
[56:04] and all these type of thing. But there
[56:06] came a time where we come to church with
[56:10] a different outlook on church, a
[56:14] different revelation of church. Amen.
[56:17] So, it's wonderful to be in fellowship
[56:21] with the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[56:24] Who is the same yesterday, today, and
[56:26] forever, a part of the eternal word.
[56:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[56:33] So, it's just an honor. I got to say
[56:34] I've thoroughly enjoyed uh my time here
[56:38] with with you all. Uh tremendous
[56:42] quality of people. Uh I just love you
[56:44] all very much. had some wonderful
[56:46] fellowship with with uh with your your
[56:51] children today. And uh to me, it's an
[56:55] it's an amazing thing that happens
[56:59] when a child
[57:01] can see themselves in the word.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Then there's just a freedom that comes,
[57:09] a freedom to fellowship, a freedom to
[57:11] talk. I mean, can you think it about
[57:15] 16, 15, 16, 17, 18 year olds talking
[57:18] about Revelation 5 and seeing themselves
[57:22] in it? It's like, who are these uh super
[57:25] spiritual people, you know, like don't
[57:27] you know that I'm 50 years old and you
[57:30] shouldn't be talking about those things,
[57:32] you know, that's just for the old
[57:33] people, you know. But here we have by
[57:35] God's grace
[57:37] uh a a group of young people that are
[57:40] able by by only the Lord to identify
[57:43] themselves in the word and say this day
[57:46] this scripture is fulfilled. You know,
[57:49] brother Ram talks about that little boy
[57:50] who saw himself in the mirror for the
[57:52] first time and he's waving his hand and
[57:54] he's trying all these different things
[57:56] and then he realizes it's me.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, that's what
[58:01] the Lord does to us when we look in the
[58:03] mirror of his word. He allows us to see
[58:06] ourselves. Amen. Praise the Lord. So,
[58:09] we're just going to take one verse of
[58:11] scripture in uh Revelation chapter 8. Uh
[58:15] just it's a continuation. I'm not going
[58:17] to recap it all. Um we're just going to
[58:21] go straight into to uh the continuation
[58:24] of this morning. So, we'll just read
[58:26] this this one verse.
[58:29] uh Revelation 8:1. It's a very um
[58:32] predominant verse in our lives as
[58:34] believers.
[58:36] And when he had opened the seventh seal,
[58:39] there was silence in heaven about the
[58:42] space of half an hour. Amen. Our
[58:46] heavenly father, we have certainly
[58:48] enjoyed our time with you, Lord, this
[58:52] weekend.
[58:54] Lord, we want to thank you for one
[58:56] another.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, because it is truly only because
[59:01] we can assemble ourselves together in
[59:03] the revelation that you have given us,
[59:05] Lord. It creates an atmosphere in this
[59:08] place that just allows the word to come
[59:10] forth. So, we thank you, heavenly
[59:12] father, for everything that you are
[59:14] making possible in our lives. Lord, I
[59:18] want to pray for those this evening,
[59:20] Lord. Every time your prophet said the
[59:22] word opens that there it it begins it
[59:26] starts a war.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; I want to pray tonight Lord for those
[59:30] that through the opening of your word
[59:32] over the weekend Lord it has started a
[59:34] war with an internal war within them. I
[59:38] pray heavenly father that they would
[59:40] draw on your strength Lord and find
[59:43] courage heavenly father to stand on your
[59:45] word. No matter what the people say, no
[59:48] matter how hard it might be, no matter
[59:51] how heavy the emotions are running, Lord
[59:54] God, may we all find the strength to
[59:56] stand on your word and fulfill your
[59:59] will. We pray in Jesus Christ's precious
[1:00:02] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. you can
[1:00:06] take your seats
[1:00:08] uh this this evening. Um so we're we're
[1:00:12] going to go straight into this as I as
[1:00:13] I've said um and look at the uh the
[1:00:17] requirements
[1:00:19] that uh a young man must meet uh before
[1:00:25] he can take the book. Um and obviously
[1:00:29] we we are taking this in Revelation 5.
[1:00:32] We'll we'll take a slide there in a
[1:00:34] moment. But we we do understand that we
[1:00:37] are taking this from Bible principles.
[1:00:41] Uh these are not things that we are are
[1:00:44] um making up. Um we don't go into the
[1:00:48] details of should we have a chaperone,
[1:00:51] shouldn't we have a chaperone. That's
[1:00:53] that's the father of the bride's issue.
[1:00:57] That's that's not my issue. Uh that's
[1:01:00] that's a personal thing and I I believe
[1:01:03] with all of my heart it's not wrong to
[1:01:06] have a chaperone but it's not mandatory
[1:01:09] to have a chaperone. But as the father
[1:01:12] of your daughter
[1:01:14] uh you should know your daughter enough
[1:01:17] and the young man enough to know whether
[1:01:20] they need a chaperone.
[1:01:22] Again, another example, my my son
[1:01:25] actually came to me and said, "Dad, I'd
[1:01:27] prefer if I had a chaperon."
[1:01:30] So, it wasn't my idea. In a chaperon's
[1:01:33] kind of a fancy name, they call it a
[1:01:35] third wheel, you know, like, you know,
[1:01:37] and and if you use the same third wheel
[1:01:40] for too long, they get worn out and they
[1:01:43] don't want to be used anymore, you know.
[1:01:44] You can buy them all the ice cream and
[1:01:46] food that they want, but just leave me
[1:01:48] at home and find another one, you know.
[1:01:50] But um we the thing the the principle
[1:01:53] here is that it's about relationship.
[1:01:57] It's not about rules and regulations.
[1:01:59] It's not about your us having a a a book
[1:02:01] of dos and don'ts. What we should do,
[1:02:04] what we oughtn't do. Um most of those
[1:02:07] things are just just made up and created
[1:02:10] out of fear. But um you know the Lord
[1:02:14] will deal with the father of the sister.
[1:02:20] Not just in courtship but the what what
[1:02:24] they allow in friendship, what they
[1:02:26] allow in courtship, what they allow in
[1:02:29] in engagement. Um that's that's up
[1:02:32] that's up to the father to deal with
[1:02:34] those things because we're not here to
[1:02:37] take the part father's place. We're here
[1:02:40] to put the father in his place.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; All right. And that's what that's what a
[1:02:45] ministry should do. It should it should
[1:02:48] minister itself out of a position or out
[1:02:51] of a job by you taking the position that
[1:02:55] uh fathers and and mothers taking their
[1:02:57] position according to the word. So um
[1:03:00] we'll we'll look at this thought of the
[1:03:02] the requirements
[1:03:05] uh because the lamb of God had to meet
[1:03:07] certain requirements
[1:03:09] before he was eligible
[1:03:13] uh to be able to take the book. Um and
[1:03:17] so we we want to look at these these
[1:03:20] requirements here. We'll just go
[1:03:21] straight to the highlight just to save
[1:03:24] time. uh the the cry went out the loud
[1:03:28] voice went out who is worthy to open the
[1:03:32] book. So one of the requirements was
[1:03:35] that he must be worthy to open the book.
[1:03:39] The the second requirement is in verse
[1:03:42] three there and it says [clears throat]
[1:03:44] there was no one found was able to open
[1:03:47] the book. All right. So we look at these
[1:03:50] two things as worthy. He had to be
[1:03:54] worthy and he had to be able. All right?
[1:03:58] Not not one requirement, but two
[1:04:01] requirements. And and um we'll we'll get
[1:04:04] into that a little bit now, but um I
[1:04:07] want the the fathers need to pay
[1:04:09] attention to this because you have to
[1:04:12] release the book.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; The father of the of the daughter um has
[1:04:20] to release the book.
[1:04:22] All right. Um, so you've got to know who
[1:04:26] you're releasing the book to.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Um, [clears throat]
[1:04:32] we give our daughters away,
[1:04:36] so to speak, right? But
[1:04:40] uh speaking to the youth around the
[1:04:42] table today is just saying is when the
[1:04:45] when someone comes to the altar to be
[1:04:47] married and we say who gives this uh
[1:04:51] woman to marry this man and then the
[1:04:54] father of the bride says I do is that
[1:04:57] just something we do for the sake of
[1:05:00] doing it
[1:05:02] or is it a release
[1:05:05] and if it's a release do you know who
[1:05:09] you're releasing
[1:05:12] your daughter to
[1:05:14] and has he met the qualifications?
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Because the father was not going to
[1:05:20] release the book to someone who had not
[1:05:23] who did not meet the qualifications.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; He had to be someone who could meet the
[1:05:29] qualifications. And there there wasn't a
[1:05:32] lineup of people,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; right? There wasn't a lineup of people.
[1:05:38] There was only one.
[1:05:41] They searched all the earth. They
[1:05:43] searched all heavens. They searched
[1:05:45] under the earth. And no one was found
[1:05:48] worthy. But there was one
[1:05:51] that was found worthy and able. All
[1:05:56] right. So, what made him worthy and what
[1:05:58] made him able? And I I'm saying this
[1:06:01] because I I want you parents to
[1:06:03] understand this that you've got to be
[1:06:06] sure that this boy that boy young man
[1:06:10] that you're releasing your daughter to
[1:06:13] has meets the requirements
[1:06:17] for her sake,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; right? It's for her sake, for the book's
[1:06:23] sake. All right. Um, you'll remember
[1:06:27] last night we're in the in the service
[1:06:29] we were kind of looking for for a word
[1:06:32] that uh best describes
[1:06:36] um the lamb or the a a man taking the
[1:06:40] book without the groom releasing it. Um
[1:06:46] and um I think we I think the word we
[1:06:49] used was steal
[1:06:51] because if you're not releasing it,
[1:06:53] you're stealing it. But uh the Lord
[1:06:55] popped this um scripture into my my mind
[1:06:59] last night. Um here it says, "My sheep
[1:07:02] will hear my voice and I know them and
[1:07:05] they follow me. I give unto them eternal
[1:07:08] life and they shall never perish.
[1:07:11] Neither shall any man pluck them
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; out of my hand. My father which gave
[1:07:19] them me
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; is greater than all and no man is able
[1:07:25] to pluck them out of my father's hand.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that wonderful? So so the
[1:07:33] the the son knew the strength of the
[1:07:37] father's hand because he said no no no
[1:07:39] man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:07:42] father's hand. And that that word pluck
[1:07:45] means to take by force,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; to take without authority.
[1:07:52] All right? So, so if the the only way
[1:07:55] that the book can change hands according
[1:07:59] to God's word is if the book is
[1:08:02] released.
[1:08:04] Any other way, it's plucking it.
[1:08:09] And you know when you pluck an pluck a
[1:08:11] chook,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; you got to do it by force,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; right? The feathers don't fall out. You
[1:08:17] got to pluck it out, right? So that's
[1:08:19] the same word here. It means to take
[1:08:23] out by force.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; To take without authority. All right. So
[1:08:29] in um
[1:08:33] in this scene, sorry, what am I doing?
[1:08:37] Let me go back. I'm pushing the wrong
[1:08:39] button again. In this scene here,
[1:08:43] the father has got to release the book,
[1:08:47] right? But he's not going to release the
[1:08:50] book who to someone who's not qualified,
[1:08:54] right? So, a a father needs to know the
[1:08:58] qualifications.
[1:09:02] Father needs to know the qualifications
[1:09:05] that the man has to meet [snorts] before
[1:09:09] he can release the book.
[1:09:13] [clears throat] Otherwise, you're
[1:09:14] releasing the the book
[1:09:17] to someone that you don't know if
[1:09:20] they're able to do what they need to do
[1:09:23] to the book.
[1:09:25] All right. So, um,
[1:09:31] this is, uh, three accounts here we're
[1:09:33] going to look at all in John 17. Jesus
[1:09:36] here, uh, testifying
[1:09:39] of how he took the book. All right. I
[1:09:44] pray for them. I pray not for the world,
[1:09:46] but for them which thou hast given me,
[1:09:52] for they are thine.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Right. So what we see here is that that
[1:09:59] that Jesus didn't pluck the book.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; There was a release of the book.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He goes as far as to say I that those
[1:10:08] which thou hast given me
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; released to me.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; All right. For they are thine.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Right. So, whose are your daughters?
[1:10:25] Your daughters are yours. All right.
[1:10:27] They're yours. They that they your
[1:10:30] responsibility.
[1:10:31] All right. Uh
[1:10:34] verse 11. And now I am no more in this
[1:10:38] world, but these are in this world, and
[1:10:39] I come to thee, holy father, keep
[1:10:43] through thy own name those whom thou
[1:10:47] hast given me. Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; That they may be one as we are one.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; All right. So, sec second verse second
[1:10:58] time. It was also in uh John 10:29 as
[1:11:02] well. But um just an example here that
[1:11:07] how Jesus speaks and the first the the
[1:11:11] first time that this scripture kind of
[1:11:15] come into my into my understanding was
[1:11:18] probably about 6 years ago when a I
[1:11:22] heard that a young man was going to take
[1:11:25] a wife without the father's consent and
[1:11:29] there was just something that come over
[1:11:31] me that I knew knew that this was wrong,
[1:11:34] but I didn't have a scriptural reference
[1:11:37] that it was wrong. And then the the Lord
[1:11:39] be to reveal these these scriptures to
[1:11:42] me that we we don't that the man should
[1:11:45] never take his bride without the hus the
[1:11:49] father's consent.
[1:11:52] All right, we'll get into a little bit
[1:11:54] of that. But father I will that they
[1:11:56] also whom thou hast given me
[1:12:00] be with me where I am that they may
[1:12:02] behold my glory which thou hast given me
[1:12:06] for thou lovest me before the foundation
[1:12:08] of the world. So it's it's very clear
[1:12:11] here how Jesus is expressing how he had
[1:12:15] h to how he got a bride.
[1:12:19] All right. And he got a bride because
[1:12:22] God gave him the bride, his bride. All
[1:12:26] right. There was a transfer of hands
[1:12:31] from one hand to the other. Okay. So,
[1:12:35] what makes the lamb [clears throat]
[1:12:38] worthy to um what makes the lamb worthy
[1:12:43] is the same thing that makes a young man
[1:12:46] worthy.
[1:12:50] Because in type the young man is the
[1:12:53] lamb.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; So what made the lamb worthy in
[1:12:59] revelation five to take the book is the
[1:13:02] same thing that that is required of the
[1:13:07] young man to take a bride. He must be
[1:13:13] worthy. All right. And
[1:13:17] um
[1:13:23] [clears throat]
[1:13:28] what makes the what made the lamb worthy
[1:13:31] is that he had submitted
[1:13:35] to the will of the father.
[1:13:39] He had overcome himself.
[1:13:45] What makes him worthy
[1:13:48] is that he has overcome
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; which which is the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Right? What makes him worthy is that he
[1:13:59] has overcome his own self desires
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and he has submitted
[1:14:08] his own self-deed
[1:14:11] self desires and submitted himself to
[1:14:16] the desires of his spiritual father the
[1:14:20] the word of God. All right. So he's
[1:14:22] overcome himself like Jesus the lamb of
[1:14:26] God. He had to overcome himself. He had
[1:14:29] to say not my will be done but thine be
[1:14:33] done. All right? He he had to overcome.
[1:14:35] He had to be one who had submitted
[1:14:38] himself to the word of God. All right?
[1:14:42] So that's that's what made him worthy.
[1:14:47] All right. Um so when the the lamb come
[1:14:50] to take the book, the father noticed he
[1:14:54] had prevailed.
[1:14:59] He had overcome
[1:15:04] if even though the lamb was the only one
[1:15:08] who could take the book,
[1:15:11] it had to be a lamb that had overcome.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Right? And this is why sometimes you you
[1:15:19] know you can have a revelation
[1:15:22] of one another but not be in a position
[1:15:25] to take one another.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Right? Like the example that I gave you
[1:15:31] this morning of my son and his now wife.
[1:15:34] You he had a revelation of her but she
[1:15:37] wasn't in a position to be taken.
[1:15:41] Right? So the young the young man has to
[1:15:44] be in a position. The young man has to
[1:15:46] be in a in a condition that he is worthy
[1:15:50] to take her,
[1:15:52] right? Because there's a purpose behind
[1:15:55] it. He must overcome. So the Holy Ghost
[1:15:59] makes him worthy. All right.
[1:16:02] Now, just a bit of a story.
[1:16:05] young man comes into my office
[1:16:07] questioning
[1:16:09] um the requirements
[1:16:12] of uh that he had to meet and she had to
[1:16:16] meet in order for uh him to to be able
[1:16:22] to marry a a young girl.
[1:16:25] Now
[1:16:28] [crying] the question we will ask is
[1:16:32] is the only is the Holy Ghost the only
[1:16:36] requirement
[1:16:41] don't answer it
[1:16:46] right is the Holy Ghost the only
[1:16:48] requirement
[1:16:50] is prevailing the only requirement now
[1:16:54] in the case of Revelation 5, there was
[1:16:57] only one lamb,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; right? But in in in this case, in in in
[1:17:04] a case now, there's not one lamb,
[1:17:08] there's lambs,
[1:17:10] [snorts]
[1:17:11] right? There's young men,
[1:17:14] plural, many.
[1:17:17] So, does that mean if men have the Holy
[1:17:21] Ghost, then they're eligible?
[1:17:24] Is that the only requirement?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Because if it is, then the father could
[1:17:31] just pick someone out who's got the Holy
[1:17:33] Ghost and say, "Marry my daughter."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; But there's another requirement. And
[1:17:37] that other requirement is that he must
[1:17:39] be able.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; He must be able to open the book, to
[1:17:45] read the book, and to look thereon.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; All right? So, so this this requirement,
[1:17:53] we could ask the question here, what
[1:17:55] made the lamb able
[1:17:58] to open the book? Cuz he'd met
[1:18:00] qualification number one.
[1:18:04] But qualification number two, what
[1:18:06] qualified him completely by meeting the
[1:18:11] second qualification?
[1:18:13] What made the lamb able to open the
[1:18:16] book?
[1:18:18] Um in in Genesis
[1:18:22] uh we understand that that in Genesis
[1:18:26] God took a part of Adam,
[1:18:32] created another Adam,
[1:18:35] right?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; And bought the mystery part of Adam
[1:18:40] to Adam.
[1:18:43] So what made Adam
[1:18:46] the original
[1:18:48] able
[1:18:50] to to take the book
[1:18:54] and reveal the book
[1:18:58] because this is the this is the second
[1:19:01] the second qualification.
[1:19:04] This is actually something that uh her
[1:19:09] father cannot do for her. Her
[1:19:14] father is not able to open the book.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; He is not. He He may be worthy. He may
[1:19:23] have the Holy Ghost, but he is not able.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; There's only one that is able.
[1:19:31] There's only one that is worthy and
[1:19:33] able, and that is her groom. Yeah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Only the bride's groom [clears throat]
[1:19:42] can take her into the fullness of the
[1:19:45] vision of God for her life.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; The father cannot take her into
[1:19:52] motherhood.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Only her groom.
[1:20:01] her father her the the the the sister's
[1:20:04] father cannot take her into wifehood.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; The the sister's the daughter's father
[1:20:14] cannot take her into motherhood.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And yet in the mind of God, God sees
[1:20:23] potentially your your daughters
[1:20:27] as
[1:20:28] wives.
[1:20:30] And as mothers,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; right? But the father of the daughter
[1:20:37] can't take them there.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; It requires her groom [clears throat]
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; to come forward and take her into the
[1:20:46] fullness of God's vision
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; for her life.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who is worthy and he's
[1:20:54] the only one who is able.
[1:20:58] All right. Only her groom can make her
[1:21:03] wife.
[1:21:05] Only her groom can make her mother.
[1:21:11] Quotation.
[1:21:13] Now, we're going to see what the book
[1:21:15] says about how it become open
[1:21:19] and is not made known until the lamb
[1:21:23] takes the book.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The lamb takes the book. The
[1:21:28] lamb's got to meet the qualifications.
[1:21:31] And when the lamb takes the
[1:21:33] qualifications, the mystery is not made
[1:21:36] known until the lamb takes the book.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Until until the groom takes the
[1:21:44] bride, the mystery of of wifehood, the
[1:21:49] mystery of motherhood cannot be revealed
[1:21:52] to her. She cannot go there without him.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; It's going to require him to take
[1:21:59] possession of her and take her into
[1:22:03] wifehood, take her into motherhood.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happens at the altar.
[1:22:09] That's what a wedding is all about. a
[1:22:11] wedding is about. The scene of the
[1:22:13] wedding is Revelation 5 is when the lamb
[1:22:17] comes forward and takes the book out of
[1:22:21] the hand of the father.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Weddings mean a whole lot more to me now
[1:22:26] than they did when I got married. I tell
[1:22:28] you, um you know, weddings in when when
[1:22:31] I got married in my mind were just some
[1:22:33] traditional thing that we did and had
[1:22:35] really no spiritual significance. But
[1:22:37] but now as as a marriage celebrant, you
[1:22:41] know, marriages mean so much.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; They mean so mean so much to me because
[1:22:46] it's the it's the father that walks the
[1:22:50] bride down his daughter down the aisle,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; right? And what's he doing generally?
[1:22:56] Generally is he is holding her.
[1:22:59] generally he'll she might have her arm
[1:23:02] through his arm, [clears throat] you
[1:23:04] know, and they're they're walking down
[1:23:05] the aisle together and the I I have them
[1:23:09] stop a little way down and the groom's
[1:23:12] standing up here and he's watching the
[1:23:14] bride come down and then once the groom
[1:23:17] stops, then the lamb's got to come
[1:23:20] forward. The lamb's got to come and take
[1:23:23] the book. So the lamb steps forward. The
[1:23:26] lamb steps off the off the off the
[1:23:29] stage. He steps down to where she is
[1:23:32] because it's down where she is that he's
[1:23:35] going to take the book. And God has come
[1:23:38] down. And the reason he has come down is
[1:23:41] to take possession of his bride. Because
[1:23:44] why? We are in marriage season. The
[1:23:47] marriage of the lamb has come. So, the
[1:23:50] groom steps down off the stage and he
[1:23:53] approaches his bride and she's still in
[1:23:56] the hand
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; of her father and he he he shakes the
[1:24:01] father's hand and the father shakes his
[1:24:04] hand and then he takes her hand and he
[1:24:08] places her hand into his hand and then
[1:24:12] the father moves his hand away.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a release. What's he
[1:24:18] saying? I give her to to thee to take
[1:24:22] her to a place that I can't take her.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:29] [laughter]
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I'm giving her to you.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Knowing that you can take her to a
[1:24:37] mystery part of her life that she knows
[1:24:40] nothing about and I that I can't take
[1:24:43] her to. I can't take her into wifehood.
[1:24:46] I can't. Through me, she can't
[1:24:49] experience that. Through me, she can't
[1:24:51] experience what it means to be a mother.
[1:24:54] It's only through you. I'm giving her to
[1:24:57] you knowing
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; that you are. This is the joining of two
[1:25:04] parts becoming one. I am giving her to
[1:25:08] you knowing
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; knowing
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; that you are a part of my daughter and
[1:25:15] my daughter is a part of you. This the
[1:25:17] exactly the same scenario in Revelation
[1:25:21] 5. God didn't release the book hoping.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He released the book knowing. He gave
[1:25:29] her into his hand knowing that he was
[1:25:33] going to take her to heights
[1:25:36] that he couldn't take her in the office
[1:25:39] of father.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's got to take the
[1:25:45] book.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; And until the book until he takes the
[1:25:50] book, the mystery can't be revealed.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[1:25:59] God as a father.
[1:26:02] God as a son.
[1:26:07] God expressing himself as a father. God
[1:26:11] expressing himself as a as a son, as a
[1:26:14] as the groom.
[1:26:18] He knew as a father, he couldn't play
[1:26:21] that part.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; But he was going to play that part. but
[1:26:26] not as a father, as a son. Because he
[1:26:30] came as a as the son of God, the lamb of
[1:26:32] God, and he was going to come and take
[1:26:35] possession of her and take her to a
[1:26:38] height that he couldn't do as her
[1:26:40] father.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; It's part of the reason he became flesh.
[1:26:48] That's that's how he got the name son of
[1:26:51] God or the title son of God was when the
[1:26:54] word become flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:26:56] Then he took on the title the son of
[1:26:58] God. He took on the title the
[1:27:00] [screaming] groom.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; The same God different title. But what
[1:27:05] he couldn't fulfill as a father he could
[1:27:07] fulfill as a groom.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; My
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; my the the the the book had to be taken.
[1:27:20] It's not made known until the lamb takes
[1:27:23] the book and breaks the seals and opens
[1:27:27] the book.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; As we saw this morning, the sacredness
[1:27:33] of our sisters,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; there's a wonderful thought come to the
[1:27:36] table when we were fellowshipping. And I
[1:27:38] encourage you to fellowship because when
[1:27:41] you fellowship around the word, he comes
[1:27:43] on the scene.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; And the one one of the one of the points
[1:27:47] that were that came during that table uh
[1:27:50] talk was that that the Lord said, "I
[1:27:53] will restore sayaeth the Lord." But you
[1:27:56] know, part of what he was restoring is
[1:27:59] value to the sisters.
[1:28:02] He's restoring a value that they that
[1:28:04] that God ordained them to have initially
[1:28:08] in the Garden of Eden, but Satan got a
[1:28:10] hold of her and degraded her. He is now
[1:28:13] restoring that value again where the
[1:28:17] sisters all of a sudden recognize their
[1:28:20] value. I'm not just another book. I'm
[1:28:22] not just another person. I have value
[1:28:25] beyond what I understand.
[1:28:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; The sacredness of the book. There was
[1:28:34] there was no one worthy to look upon the
[1:28:37] book.
[1:28:41] Right?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Not even if the father
[1:28:46] was worthy
[1:28:48] to look upon the book.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; You understanding what I'm saying?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Are you reading in between the lines?
[1:28:55] Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; There is only one who is worthy
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; to look there on.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; And this is why you need to be careful
[1:29:03] what type of Snapchat images and and
[1:29:05] status photos you put up.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Because if you're bearing yourself in a
[1:29:11] way that makes men lust after you,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; there's only one who is worthy to look
[1:29:17] on you.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:19] [applause]
[1:29:20] the sacredness of a sister.
[1:29:23] When she understands her value and how
[1:29:26] that value is sacred, she can then
[1:29:29] conduct herself. She can then dress
[1:29:31] herself in the strength of the
[1:29:32] revelation of who she is. There is only
[1:29:35] one who is worthy to look upon me.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; There's only one that's worthy to break
[1:29:47] the seal. There's only one that's worthy
[1:29:50] to look on me.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And you've got to keep yourself covered
[1:29:57] till that one comes.
[1:30:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:07] We're doing good. Genesis 2. And the
[1:30:11] Lord
[1:30:13] and sorry and the rib which the Lord God
[1:30:16] took from man made he a woman and bought
[1:30:21] her unto the man.
[1:30:24] So this is the this is the shadow. This
[1:30:28] is the sea chapter.
[1:30:30] We we understand here that the Lord God
[1:30:36] who
[1:30:37] made the woman by taking a part of Adam
[1:30:42] and making him a helpmate.
[1:30:46] He He's the one who bought her unto the
[1:30:51] man,
[1:30:54] right? The same as who brings the bride
[1:30:57] down the aisle.
[1:31:00] Right? Because really she is in a
[1:31:05] natural sense his hard work,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; right? She's the result of the labor of
[1:31:15] the parents,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; right? Adam didn't have anything to do
[1:31:19] with what she was.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; But he had something to do with what she
[1:31:24] was going to be. But he didn't have
[1:31:26] anything to do with what she was. And
[1:31:29] nor does anyone except my wife and I.
[1:31:32] And you know, you can let's just keep it
[1:31:35] at that. All right. No one but my wife
[1:31:37] and I have anything to do with who my
[1:31:40] daughter is.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:42] Yes.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; But by the time my daughter comes down
[1:31:47] the aisle and I am walking her down the
[1:31:50] aisle, I like to think of it this way
[1:31:53] that she's gone as far as she can in the
[1:31:57] office that she is now in.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And now wedding is a graduation.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; All right. wedding, a marriage is a
[1:32:08] graduation where where now she is going
[1:32:11] to graduate like from high school to
[1:32:13] university or whatever you want to say,
[1:32:15] but but you understand what I mean. And
[1:32:18] that what what the graduation what the
[1:32:20] wedding is going to do is bring her into
[1:32:23] a higher level of revelation of herself.
[1:32:28] So he must be able
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; as now her spiritual head to bring her
[1:32:35] into a higher revelation of who she is
[1:32:39] than what she currently is.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; This is what the opening of the seal did
[1:32:45] for us as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:48] That's what it's doing now. that through
[1:32:50] the marriage of the lamb we are we have
[1:32:54] reached a level of maturity that we
[1:32:56] could not reach outside of the marriage
[1:32:59] of the lamb or before the marriage of
[1:33:01] the lamb but because the marriage of the
[1:33:03] lamb has come we are reaching a height
[1:33:06] of maturity
[1:33:08] we have reached a height of maturity
[1:33:10] that we otherwise couldn't before the
[1:33:13] marriage
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; so the purpose of the marriage is
[1:33:17] spiritual growth is natural growth both
[1:33:20] both of those things in one because when
[1:33:23] you become a wife, you don't grow
[1:33:26] naturally only, but you grow
[1:33:28] spiritually.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; You don't need less of a relationship
[1:33:32] with the Lord as the wife when you get
[1:33:34] married or as a as as the wife when you
[1:33:38] once you're married, you need more of a
[1:33:40] relationship because you're you're
[1:33:42] coming to a higher position.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; All right. It's the same as in um um
[1:33:50] Revelation 4 or Revelation 3 where I
[1:33:53] think we sung a song about it this
[1:33:55] morning where where the Lord says to
[1:33:57] John, "Come up higher. I need you to
[1:34:00] come up higher." Well, that's the same
[1:34:02] thing that that God is doing with us.
[1:34:04] All right? But we notice here that that
[1:34:07] that the Lord
[1:34:10] brought her unto the man,
[1:34:15] but he didn't say anything, did he?
[1:34:19] He didn't speak concerning her.
[1:34:25] He just bought her.
[1:34:28] He didn't reveal her.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz she was sealed, right? Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; But
[1:34:37] God as a father couldn't break the seal.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; verse 23.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And Adam said,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; "Not God said."
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Not God as a father said. It says, "And
[1:34:56] Adam said." Yeah.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; So, who's breaking the seal of his of
[1:35:03] the woman's life?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; The groom.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; The groom. So, what made it possible for
[1:35:12] Adam to be able?
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; To break the seal
[1:35:23] because this is a qualification.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:26] It's the same thing that the the that
[1:35:28] made the lamb able.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; And the reason that what made Adam able
[1:35:39] is because she was from him.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I was going to bring a couple of bottles
[1:35:50] out,
[1:35:52] but
[1:36:00] There's a couple here, but I was hoping
[1:36:01] to have one with a label. Um,
[1:36:07] [snorts] can you, brother? I I I had
[1:36:09] them ready and I thought, "No, that's
[1:36:11] silly."
[1:36:14] I may have put them back in the little
[1:36:16] thing in there, brother. I had one with
[1:36:17] the label ripped off.
[1:36:21] So what what made
[1:36:25] Adam able?
[1:36:28] What made the lamb able?
[1:36:34] Right. Because it's not just the qualif
[1:36:36] Yeah, that's tremendous. It's not just
[1:36:38] the qualification of having the Holy
[1:36:41] Ghost.
[1:36:44] They they they must be a part of one
[1:36:47] another.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:50] So, a group of men having the Holy Ghost
[1:36:52] and you have one sister, can the sister
[1:36:55] just pick any man because the all the
[1:36:59] brothers meet the qualifications?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; No. She She's got to have a revelation
[1:37:04] of her part,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; right? And it's the same the other way.
[1:37:08] If there's one man and many sisters and
[1:37:11] all the sisters have the Holy Ghost,
[1:37:14] does that mean that if the only
[1:37:15] qualification is that she's got to have
[1:37:18] the Holy Ghost, can the man just pick
[1:37:20] the most beautiful out of the bunch and
[1:37:22] say, "Well, everyone's had the Holy
[1:37:24] Ghost. I can pick whoever I want." No.
[1:37:26] He's got to find the other part.
[1:37:30] Because what was happening here
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; that God was bringing the two parts of
[1:37:36] one man together.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; So what made Abel able sorry what made
[1:37:42] Adam able was that it was another part
[1:37:46] of himself
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; and because he knew who he was,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; right? because he knew who he was. He
[1:37:58] was able to reveal the mystery
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; part of himself because it's not two
[1:38:06] different parts coming together. He said
[1:38:09] this is bone of my bone and flesh of my
[1:38:13] flesh. He's saying what I am, you are.
[1:38:16] He was saying she is me.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; But how can he say she is me if he
[1:38:22] doesn't know who he is?
[1:38:25] Yes.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; You've got to know who you are.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; In order for you to be able to know the
[1:38:34] other part, you've got to know who you
[1:38:36] are. If you don't know who you are, then
[1:38:38] how can you know your other [screaming]
[1:38:40] part?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:43] So, it's not just a matter of of a a man
[1:38:47] finding a wife,
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; right? He's got to find a wife that is a
[1:38:57] part of him.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Though there be other other fine young
[1:39:03] eligible ladies in his view, he's not
[1:39:07] looking for a woman.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:11] He's looking for his woman.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what God come to
[1:39:18] do. He wasn't looking for a bride. He
[1:39:20] was looking for his bride.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; There may be many fine young ladies in
[1:39:26] this room, but there is only one of me,
[1:39:28] and that's the one I go home with.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; There may be many fine young Christian
[1:39:35] people in this world. But God isn't
[1:39:37] looking for a Christian person. He's
[1:39:39] looking for more than that. He is
[1:39:42] looking for a part of himself.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:52] So, if you read the ingredients on this,
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; the nutritional value,
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; what you'll find is it's going to be the
[1:40:02] same as this
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; because the label that is on this can
[1:40:07] actually go on that and it be exactly
[1:40:11] right.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; The bride, the groom is the word. The
[1:40:16] labels that we put on him, he's the
[1:40:18] word. He's the the spirit of life. He's
[1:40:21] eternal life. He's this and he's that.
[1:40:24] That label can actually go on her
[1:40:27] because she is word of his word, spirit
[1:40:29] of his spirit and life of his life.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Because this is it. It it really
[1:40:35] it's not two parts but two two different
[1:40:38] persons. It's two parts becoming one
[1:40:40] part.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is not the only
[1:40:47] qualification.
[1:40:51] You need a revelation
[1:40:54] of your other part.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what happened here.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Adam was worthy
[1:41:04] and Adam was able.
[1:41:08] Like if if if I had a
[1:41:12] Oh, here we go.
[1:41:25] Something wrong, right?
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Different ingredients,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; right? This can't reveal this
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; because this is different to this,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; this is this is a different substance.
[1:41:43] This is this is not the word. No,
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; this is the word.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Right? So, you want more than a bride.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; You want your bride.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Right, sisters? I told them at the
[1:41:57] table, you want more than a man.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Don't ask God for a man.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Ask him [screaming] for your man.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Because there's only one. Lord, where's
[1:42:09] my lamb? Reveal my lamb to me. I don't
[1:42:14] care how charming [screaming]
[1:42:15] and how value much much wealth he's got.
[1:42:18] That means nothing.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; It absolutely means nothing. What's
[1:42:23] important is that you are a part of one
[1:42:27] another. And it is not two foreign
[1:42:30] objects coming together, but it is two
[1:42:33] of the same part coming together. These
[1:42:36] two become one.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; I'll say this again.
[1:42:43] Because this is again,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; this isn't a union.
[1:42:48] It's a reunion.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 is not a union.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; It's a reunion.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that book was a part of
[1:43:01] him. God, the lamb was coming forward to
[1:43:05] take a part of himself.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't coming to take a creed.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; The book was a further revelation of
[1:43:16] himself. And that is what the man is
[1:43:18] looking for. The man is looking for a
[1:43:21] further [screaming] revelation of
[1:43:23] himself because he feels within his
[1:43:25] heart that there's a part of him that's
[1:43:27] missing [clears throat]
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and he goes through life. Nope. Nope.
[1:43:33] Nope. Nope. Praise God. Yep.
[1:43:39] What has he found?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; He's found himself.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; He's found the missing part of himself.
[1:43:47] And this is like like do do our our
[1:43:50] marriages his will or our will?
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Because if they're ours, then we need to
[1:43:56] stop saying what we say at the wedding.
[1:44:00] Because at the wedding, what we say is,
[1:44:01] "Let no man pull us under what God
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. hath joined by put together. Yes.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Right. So, so when I married my wife,
[1:44:12] did God foresee it?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; If if I don't think he did, I'm in
[1:44:18] trouble.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Because the strength of my
[1:44:22] marriage is not I hope so.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; The strength of my marriage is not me.
[1:44:29] And I hope this works. You know, I
[1:44:31] married a couple that were married for
[1:44:34] two, three years, had two children, and
[1:44:38] the wife looks across the table to the
[1:44:40] man and she says, "I still don't know if
[1:44:43] he's the right one."
[1:44:49] I wasn't a pastor then. I was just
[1:44:52] helping someone out. I thought, "Man,
[1:44:55] I'm glad I'm not a pastor. I don't want
[1:44:57] to have to deal with this.
[1:45:02] I don't think we even replied. Huh? My
[1:45:04] wife was there.
[1:45:07] Goodness.
[1:45:10] A marriage is a revelation.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:45:16] this is this is why the book was in the
[1:45:19] hand the right hand of him. And the
[1:45:22] right hand that the book was in had a
[1:45:25] revelation of who was coming to take the
[1:45:28] book. I'm giving her to you
[1:45:32] because I believe with all of my heart
[1:45:37] that you can take her into realms
[1:45:41] that I as her father cannot.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; I surrender everything she is
[1:45:49] and I give her to you. I place her in
[1:45:53] your care believing. Now I want to I
[1:45:57] want you to understand this. Marriages
[1:45:59] are never without troubles.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Wow. But damn, you can't speak like that
[1:46:06] concerning my marriage. Okay, I can't.
[1:46:09] All right, but marriages go through
[1:46:11] storms.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; But you know, I I hope this is okay. I
[1:46:16] hope I'm not offending um my my my
[1:46:19] daughter
[1:46:21] and my son-in-law, but you know, I've
[1:46:24] I've watched their marriage go through
[1:46:27] some rough times,
[1:46:30] but you know where I go
[1:46:33] to the revelation
[1:46:36] that God gave me
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; concerning my son-in-law.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; When when I be Oh, man. like and your
[1:46:46] mind begins to wander.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; You know where I go? Back to the
[1:46:51] revelation.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Back to the revelation of why I gave
[1:46:56] them
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; gave her to him because God revealed to
[1:47:01] me that you are the one.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; God had also revealed to me that there
[1:47:05] was another one who wasn't the one.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:47:12] But thankfully through the relationship
[1:47:15] that I had with my daughter
[1:47:19] that that one come to an end.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; So the father can have a relationship
[1:47:27] that he is or he isn't.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Well, he's a fine young man. He's this.
[1:47:33] He's that. He's that. He comes to
[1:47:35] church. Yeah. Okay. He could be all
[1:47:39] that. He could be Holy Ghost filled, but
[1:47:43] that doesn't mean that that any man
[1:47:46] who's has the Holy Ghost is my
[1:47:48] daughter's part.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He's got to be a revelation.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I've taken it too
[1:48:00] far, but it works.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Cuz why? I believe it's exactly the same
[1:48:10] thing that the lamb did,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; the father did.
[1:48:17] He had a revelation of the lamb.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; I've heard people say, "Oh yeah, you
[1:48:26] know, someone come and ask me for my
[1:48:28] daughter's hand in marriage." I said,
[1:48:30] "Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll give you a bag
[1:48:32] of groceries and a tank of fuel."
[1:48:38] Well, you value your daughter, don't
[1:48:40] you?
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God God wants us to
[1:48:50] understand.
[1:48:51] God wants us to understand our role as a
[1:48:55] young man. You're not looking for a
[1:48:57] woman.
[1:49:00] She might have eyes like the stars,
[1:49:04] teeth like pearls, neck like a swan, but
[1:49:08] so what?
[1:49:11] Your other part might be the ugliest
[1:49:13] sister in the room.
[1:49:18] [laughter]
[1:49:20] Sorry sisters, none of you are ugly.
[1:49:22] Okay.
[1:49:25] But look, the it's the out the outside
[1:49:32] is not the main focus. [laughter]
[1:49:35] No, no one married an ugly bride. Come
[1:49:38] on. Right. Every bride that that got
[1:49:41] married was the most beautiful thing
[1:49:44] that the groom had ever laid eyes on.
[1:49:47] She she was the standout. It didn't
[1:49:50] matter who else was at the in the
[1:49:52] ceremony. It didn't matter who the the
[1:49:54] bridesmaids, etc., etc. They just fade
[1:49:57] into insignificance. They may as well
[1:49:59] even not be there because he is only
[1:50:01] looking at one,
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; and that is her, the most beautiful one
[1:50:05] in the room.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; No one can outdress her. No one can out
[1:50:11] beauty her.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Why? because he's looking
[1:50:20] at his other part.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; I love the story that the prophet tells
[1:50:25] about the rancher's son
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; who's looking for a bride and they all
[1:50:28] dole themselves up trying to attract
[1:50:31] this guy and here's this little washer
[1:50:33] woman not even considering that she is
[1:50:36] going to be a part of his economy.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; So she just ah
[1:50:41] I'm there's no chance for me. I'm just
[1:50:45] going to do what I do and go and wash
[1:50:46] the dishes and mop the floors. And he
[1:50:49] got fed up with this fake facade of
[1:50:52] people
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; and went for a little bit of a walk,
[1:50:56] perhaps not even knowing she was in the
[1:50:58] washroom.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; But she come out to throw out the
[1:51:02] dishwater.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; She had no shoes on.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; She had her work clothes on.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you, young man, what type of
[1:51:10] woman do you want to marry?
[1:51:13] one that's dled up, that doesn't know
[1:51:15] how to work, or you want someone that
[1:51:17] has the potential to be able to look
[1:51:19] after your children, look after your
[1:51:21] home, and and and and be a homemaker.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's the type of woman I
[1:51:27] married. And that's the type of woman
[1:51:29] that any decent guy will want if he's
[1:51:32] got the right character within him. He's
[1:51:34] not after a beauty queen. He's after
[1:51:37] someone who can who can uh look after
[1:51:40] his children. He's looking for someone
[1:51:43] who has character.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Not a character that you paint on and
[1:51:48] paint off, wash off. You understand what
[1:51:51] I mean? Not a character that you put on
[1:51:53] and take off, right? A an inbuilt
[1:51:56] character, an internal character. That's
[1:52:00] the type of woman you're looking for.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; She comes out and she she throws out the
[1:52:05] dishwater over the fence and and he just
[1:52:07] happens to be there. [snorts]
[1:52:10] He says, "Excuse me,
[1:52:14] da da da da da da da." And she gets
[1:52:15] embarrassed.
[1:52:18] Brother Brown says she she took that
[1:52:19] wash basin and put it over herself
[1:52:23] because she was a little bit embarrassed
[1:52:25] of her state that she was in in the
[1:52:30] presence of this great man.
[1:52:34] And lo and behold, he asks her,
[1:52:38] "Will you marry me?"
[1:52:41] You see, he didn't find his other part
[1:52:43] on the dance floor.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't find his other part in the in
[1:52:48] the imitation
[1:52:50] because that's all they were. They were
[1:52:52] all just false.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; But he found a real woman [laughter]
[1:52:57] who wasn't false, but she was real.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what God bought to Adam. God
[1:53:03] bought to Adam a real woman. And the
[1:53:06] fact that she was real is because she
[1:53:09] was a part of him.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:53:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:23] So,
[1:53:24] who is the lamb redeeming?
[1:53:28] Who is the lamb
[1:53:31] marrying?
[1:53:33] I didn't put my stopwatch on.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Should I do it now?
[1:53:38] I'm joking.
[1:53:39] [snorts]
[1:53:43] So
[1:53:44] the parents
[1:53:48] are the ones who release
[1:53:51] their daughters
[1:53:54] on parents on the on the son's side
[1:53:59] are instructing
[1:54:03] their sons
[1:54:04] to do things according to the will of
[1:54:08] God. [snorts]
[1:54:10] right? Which is
[1:54:13] the word of God. And that is what God is
[1:54:16] giving us through this weekend.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; He's empowering.
[1:54:22] He's putting power where power needs to
[1:54:25] be put.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And that is back in the hand of the
[1:54:30] parents
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; to encourage their sons
[1:54:36] to do things right.
[1:54:40] Don't be hasty. Don't pluck that that
[1:54:44] that that that father's daughter out of
[1:54:47] his hand. You take the right approach.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Right. And the the when the when the
[1:54:55] lamb when this the boy approaches the
[1:54:59] father
[1:55:00] and the father says no.
[1:55:06] If the boy then says, "Oh, well, not to
[1:55:09] worry. I'll find me another one."
[1:55:13] He was never yours.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:55:18] Never. Because the lamb
[1:55:22] was willing to do. Now, I'm speaking
[1:55:25] about Holy Ghost filled fathers.
[1:55:27] Whatever the father
[1:55:31] desired or wanted from him,
[1:55:36] There was nothing that the lamb would
[1:55:38] not do to have you.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, could he have done any more?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Really, he couldn't. He couldn't. The go
[1:55:51] the father of the book
[1:55:54] asked the lamb to do the hardest thing.
[1:56:01] He couldn't do any more than what than
[1:56:04] than He couldn't do any more than what
[1:56:06] he did. And this is why this is going to
[1:56:10] seem like you're like a saddest or
[1:56:12] something, but in in ma in courtship,
[1:56:17] I look for the battle.
[1:56:21] I look for the challenge
[1:56:24] because the lamb had to overcome.
[1:56:31] So in in every marriage that I have um
[1:56:35] been the celebrant in there has been a
[1:56:39] challenge
[1:56:41] involved in courtship
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; not engagement. engagement, it's too
[1:56:45] late in courtship, right? Where the
[1:56:49] father could say no, the father can be
[1:56:53] um m maybe he's got
[1:56:57] strict boundaries.
[1:57:00] Maybe he wants his daughter not going
[1:57:03] here, not going there. He doesn't want
[1:57:05] his daughter out at night. He doesn't
[1:57:07] want he wants his daughter home by 6:00.
[1:57:10] He wants you, you know, he he's got
[1:57:11] these conditions
[1:57:13] that he Now, look, I'm not talking about
[1:57:16] men who are taking advantage of a young
[1:57:18] man. I'm talking about men who have are
[1:57:21] filled with the Holy Ghost and want the
[1:57:23] best for their daughter.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Right? So, so, so,
[1:57:29] um, there can be there can be these
[1:57:32] struggles in courtship that happen, but
[1:57:35] if the man ever gets to the point,
[1:57:38] sisters,
[1:57:40] where the battle is too hard,
[1:57:43] do you know what he's saying?
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; You're not worth it.
[1:57:50] If he ever starts to think
[1:57:54] that way, pull out
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; because if you are his other part, you
[1:58:04] will be worth it.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; The his mind the way that he is thinking
[1:58:09] is not wrong.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; It's the result
[1:58:14] of you not being the other part of him.
[1:58:18] I I can tell you firsthand testimonies
[1:58:21] of this of of how this works,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; right? Because the groom, your groom,
[1:58:29] your your male partner will do anything
[1:58:34] if you are the other part of him.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing will restrict him. Nothing
[1:58:40] nothing will stop him. Yeah,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; we had a a um incident where a beautiful
[1:58:49] brother and sister, we had a sister
[1:58:51] living with us for some time and I think
[1:58:53] she was around 25 26 somewhere around
[1:58:56] there and this young this young man came
[1:58:58] into her life and uh he he he flew over
[1:59:03] um they knew each other when they lived
[1:59:05] in um somewhere else and uh and he flew
[1:59:12] over and and and uh got to know her and
[1:59:15] he they come to me and and told me look
[1:59:18] you know I've approached the dad and
[1:59:20] he's he said it's okay and um we're
[1:59:23] we're going to we're going to get
[1:59:24] married and we're planning it for for
[1:59:27] not too in the not too distant future
[1:59:30] and um he had to then fly home which was
[1:59:33] which was in Africa somewhere and and
[1:59:36] once as he was flying home co hit
[1:59:41] the first the first bout we had of CO
[1:59:44] and you know what happened like
[1:59:46] everything just went into shutdown. So
[1:59:48] here they were they'd been engaged that
[1:59:50] they'd um they they' set a a plan a date
[1:59:54] for their for their wedding and now they
[1:59:58] didn't see each other for two years.
[2:00:04] Now this is what I say. I look for the
[2:00:08] struggle.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; If they weren't a part of each other,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; they wouldn't have gotten through it.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; But really, it didn't matter if it went
[2:00:25] on for four years.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Because they were part of one another,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; he could endure it. because they were
[2:00:35] part of one another, she could endure
[2:00:38] it.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's the these things are
[2:00:41] uh are really important because
[2:00:44] sometimes we think, oh, you know,
[2:00:46] there's there's a struggle happening and
[2:00:48] you know, what am I going to do? And but
[2:00:51] if she is yours, brother,
[2:00:55] you will do whatever is necessary.
[2:01:00] There was a young brother just recently,
[2:01:02] not in my church. I was just giving him
[2:01:05] counsel because the sister he was
[2:01:07] interested in was in my church.
[2:01:12] I'm not going to tell you that one.
[2:01:14] Praise the Lord. I just feel the Lord
[2:01:15] checking me there. So, praise the Lord.
[2:01:17] Amen. So, the the the fathers released
[2:01:20] the book to the lamb because the father
[2:01:22] has a revelation of the lamb.
[2:01:26] All right. So, this is revelation.
[2:01:28] Revelation, revelation, revelation.
[2:01:30] Doesn't matter which way you want to
[2:01:32] look at it. There's a revelation. Not
[2:01:34] emotion. Revelation. All right. The the
[2:01:37] the lamb has a revelation of the book.
[2:01:40] The book has a revelation of the lamb.
[2:01:42] The hand has a revelation of the book.
[2:01:44] And the hand has a revelation of the
[2:01:46] lamb. Everywhere you look, it's about
[2:01:49] revelation.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the requirements of the young
[2:01:52] man are that he must be worthy and he
[2:01:56] must be able. All right? He must be
[2:02:00] worthy and he must be able. What makes
[2:02:02] him worthy? The Holy Ghost. What makes
[2:02:04] him able is that he is another she is
[2:02:08] another part of him.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; All right. We don't just want men
[2:02:13] marrying any woman.
[2:02:15] I've seen enough shipwreck marriages in
[2:02:18] my time to last me the rest of my life
[2:02:20] here. But we we we should be seeing a a
[2:02:24] a backwards trend
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; in the break of marriages in the message
[2:02:30] of the hour.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; And I believe with everything within me
[2:02:35] that God by this word is saving
[2:02:39] shipwrecks.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; It is. He is saving shipwrecks by
[2:02:44] bringing sisters and brothers to the
[2:02:46] revelation of their position according
[2:02:49] to the word. Not according to some
[2:02:51] theological idea or some man-made thing.
[2:02:54] It's this is not man-made. I've had
[2:02:56] people tell me this is you are just make
[2:02:58] I am not making this up. This is God's
[2:03:02] word and I believe this is God's vision
[2:03:04] for my sons. This is God's vision for my
[2:03:07] daughters. And this is God's vision for
[2:03:09] my wife and I as parents.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; And I believe if we follow the word,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; then we should see a decline
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; in shipwrecked marriages
[2:03:25] in the message. Amen.
[2:03:28] Praise the Lord. I don't know how I did
[2:03:31] that time, but I'm done.
[2:03:37] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I
[2:03:40] think I've got one quote to finish here.
[2:03:43] He said, "But remember, he went there
[2:03:45] with you in him."
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; See, God had never separated the bride
[2:03:50] and the groom yet. So when God looked
[2:03:53] down upon the body of Christ, he saw
[2:03:57] both male and female. It was all
[2:04:00] redeemed in that one body. See, they are
[2:04:05] one. [clears throat] Same same word. The
[2:04:08] same word that spoke of the groom speaks
[2:04:12] of the bride. [laughter]
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same word.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Springwater. Springwater.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is the bride? The word.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same word. And this is why
[2:04:25] when when you look at the red letter
[2:04:28] writing in your Bible and Jesus starts
[2:04:30] to talk about himself, he's talking
[2:04:32] about you, too.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Because the same word that speaks of the
[2:04:37] groom speaks of the bride.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why you are identified
[2:04:45] by the same word, the same book that he
[2:04:50] was identified with. You can pick up the
[2:04:53] same book and identify. He can identify
[2:04:57] you in the book as part of the book.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is introducing himself to you
[2:05:10] as him.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Trust it was a
[2:05:17] blessing.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Thank you, brother
[2:05:20] Elray.
[2:05:39] Praise the Lord,
[2:05:41] man. What a weekend. Amen.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Revelation, revelation, revelation in
[2:05:48] everyone. We started off with it's
[2:05:49] relationship, relationship,
[2:05:51] relationship.
[2:05:53] You're going to sing that song when I
[2:05:55] put up there. Um, we started off in
[2:05:58] every direction it's relationship, but
[2:06:01] we ended up with in each one of those
[2:06:03] relationships. It's got to be
[2:06:05] revelation. Isn't that just absolutely
[2:06:07] marvelous?
[2:06:10] You know, it's the biggest problem of
[2:06:12] all of this is when we're in a rush,
[2:06:16] when we get nervous, when we get
[2:06:18] fearful,
[2:06:20] when we start wondering, Lord, are you
[2:06:22] going to figure this out? Lord, I need
[2:06:24] to help you.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; And the family and the everyone else
[2:06:30] gets emotional and excited and emotional
[2:06:33] pressures.
[2:06:35] All of that is excitement, but it's not
[2:06:38] a revelation.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; And both parties, or in fact, all the
[2:06:43] parties involved, need that revelation.
[2:06:45] Amen. That's so good.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Daniel. God bless you
[2:06:48] richly.
[2:06:50] It was really lovely to have you here.
[2:06:52] Thank you for your sacrifice to come. I
[2:06:53] know it's been a long journey and
[2:06:57] sacrifices,
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; but we really appreciate you.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you, Sister Shill, for coming
[2:07:03] along. It's uh it's been just absolutely
[2:07:05] lovely.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I um I'm just going to start the
[2:07:11] song off and then hand over to you,
[2:07:12] Simon.
[2:07:16] Do you feel the world is broken?
[2:07:20] We do.

[2:22:47] What a wonderful [music]
[2:22:56] [music]
[2:22:58] brother Adrian.
[2:23:09] Let's pray saints.
[2:23:11] Precious heavenly father, Lord, over the
[2:23:13] ages, you have been slowly
[2:23:16] giving out revelation after revelation.
[2:23:19] Through those church ages, Lord, they g
[2:23:21] you gave them a little bit of this and a
[2:23:23] little bit of that. But at the end time,
[2:23:26] Lord, the book was open. And there's
[2:23:28] nothing held back now, Lord. And Lord
[2:23:32] God, you're just pouring out more
[2:23:34] revelation upon that little part, that
[2:23:36] part of yourself.
[2:23:39] Lord, we are coming back to know how you
[2:23:42] see us, Lord God. We've looked in the
[2:23:45] mirror of ourself and we have seen
[2:23:47] nothing good. But when we look into the
[2:23:48] mirror of the word of God, there is
[2:23:51] [music] you said there's not even a
[2:23:53] spot, wrinkle, or a blemish because it
[2:23:55] is your righteousness that we are living
[2:23:57] in, Lord God. And Lord, we thank you,
[2:24:00] Lord. It's your righteousness, not our
[2:24:02] our own righteousness because we have
[2:24:04] none of our own. It's all in you, Lord.
[2:24:07] And we thank you, Lord. And we just pray
[2:24:09] Lord that you'll bless our brother and
[2:24:11] our sister Lord as they go back Lord I
[2:24:13] pray that you'll bless the church over
[2:24:16] there Lord. Lord I just pray you keep
[2:24:18] taking them from glory to glory. Keep
[2:24:20] taking us here from glory to glory Lord
[2:24:23] God because we're all in this together
[2:24:25] Lord and we thank you for this wonderful
[2:24:28] weekend Lord. It's just something very
[2:24:30] special. It's something very deep. It's
[2:24:32] something inside of the very depth of
[2:24:35] our soul Lord God. And Lord, you are
[2:24:38] changing us, Lord. When we even don't
[2:24:40] feel like we're changing, you are
[2:24:42] changing us, Lord. [music] And we thank
[2:24:44] you for that supernatural work, Lord. We
[2:24:46] give you the thanks in the name of Jesus
[2:24:48] Christ, Lord. Amen.
