[31:11] [Music]
[31:33] When you feel weak and
[31:36] weepy, when doubts cloud all your views,
[31:42] Remember God is
[31:45] working. His grace will carry
[31:50] you. He made you in his
[31:55] image. Adopted as his
[31:59] own. Through trials and through
[32:03] struggles, his love has always
[32:10] shown. I believe in what God's doing in
[32:16] your heart and in your life. He's
[32:21] refining. He's
[32:23] transforming through the battles and the
[32:27] strife. He will finish what he
[32:33] started. By his spirit, you'll be
[32:37] strong. I believe in what God's
[32:42] doing. Through you, his work goes
[32:53] on. Though
[32:56] foolishness confounds you and weakness
[33:00] seems so
[33:02] great, the Lord delights in
[33:07] using the humble for his sake.
[33:12] He gifts his saints with
[33:16] purpose to build his church in
[33:20] love,
[33:22] equipping every
[33:25] member with strength from Christ
[33:29] above. I believe in what God's doing in
[33:35] your heart and in your life. He's
[33:39] refining. He's
[33:42] transforming through the battles and the
[33:46] strife. He will finish what he
[33:51] started. By his spirit, you'll be
[33:55] strong. I believe in what God's
[34:00] do. Through you, his word goes on.
[34:07] So take heart when the road is long. For
[34:13] his
[34:13] promises
[34:15] remain. He is
[34:17] shaping. He is leading. Through the joy
[34:22] and through the
[34:24] pain. Every step is held by
[34:28] mercy. Every tear will not be lost. God
[34:34] is working ever
[34:37] faithful. Jesus paid the final
[34:43] cost. I believe in what God's doing in
[34:49] your heart and in your life. He's
[34:54] refining. He's
[34:56] transforming through the battles and the
[35:00] strife. He will finish what he
[35:05] started. By his spirit, you'll be
[35:09] strong. I believe in what God's
[35:14] doing. Through you, his work goes
[35:19] on. Yes, I believe in what he's doing.
[35:25] Forever faithful, true, and kind. Keep
[35:31] your eyes on Christ your
[35:34] savior. His good purpose you will find.

[46:49] don't
[46:53] mind. Has everyone enjoyed it so far?
[46:57] Amen. Amen. The Lord is just so good. I
[47:00] kind of feel every year it's the best
[47:02] camp we've had so
[47:03] far and this is definitely no exception.
[47:07] Um it's just amazing how quickly it's
[47:09] running past two services down, two to
[47:12] go and then we have the testimony. Um
[47:15] but really thankful for what the Lord
[47:17] has has been doing for us. Just I'm uh
[47:20] this is this is beyond my expectations.
[47:23] I I'll let you in on something that I I
[47:24] did say to brother um Alistister, but I
[47:29] I said to him
[47:32] um I was fully expecting coming from
[47:35] South Africa that he would be a hardline
[47:38] critical
[47:41] legalist. And I'm so thankful that he's
[47:44] he's not that he's not a liberalist
[47:46] either. We don't want either of those.
[47:48] Amen. But he believes the word, but the
[47:50] way he applies it is is not through a
[47:53] law, but through love. And I love that.
[47:55] I love his his approach and his and his
[47:58] uh yeah, his his heart and everything.
[48:00] Just really been enjoying it. Amen.
[48:05] Um so I'm going to ask you again, and I
[48:08] know I've done this kind of thing
[48:09] before, and and forgive me for asking
[48:11] you to help me remember tomorrow
[48:13] morning. Um, so I've announced before,
[48:16] brother Matan is leaving for Pakistan on
[48:19] Monday and Bala and I are leaving for
[48:21] South Africa on Tuesday. So, um, I would
[48:23] just like us to pray together tomorrow
[48:25] morning and and just commit those trips
[48:28] into the Lord's hands. So, please help
[48:29] me remember that that we don't forget to
[48:31] do
[48:32] that. Um, then also there's something I
[48:35] need to make right. My humor gets me in
[48:38] trouble. You've you know that by now.
[48:40] Um, so I want to make sure the kids
[48:43] understand exactly what I'm going to
[48:44] say. Now, I made a condition to the
[48:48] marshmallows. I said, "If you stay
[48:50] awake, you can have marshmallows, but
[48:52] I'm going to repent of that." That was
[48:53] just me being silly. Okay? You can sleep
[48:56] during the service. Feel free to sleep
[48:58] and then we'll wake you up after the
[49:01] service and then you can have the
[49:03] marshmallows. Is that a
[49:05] deal? Okay. Right. You do that. So,
[49:09] you're welcome to sleep.
[49:12] Okay. Sorry for misleading you on that
[49:17] one. Um then also I I just um we're
[49:21] going to pray now, but I I also you know
[49:23] this is kind of halfway mark through the
[49:25] camp and um you know there's a lot of
[49:27] people doing a lot of things. Has anyone
[49:29] everyone been enjoying the food so far?
[49:31] Yes, I certainly have. Um and um the
[49:35] food team is, you know, is at that point
[49:37] in the weekend where they're starting to
[49:39] feel the the tiredness happening. And
[49:42] I'm sure the likes of Brother Jonathan,
[49:44] Brother Joseph, the musicians, song
[49:46] leaders, different ones. And hope I
[49:47] don't leave anyone out. But um so, so
[49:50] when we're going to pray now, I want us
[49:52] to also just think of all those um
[49:55] people that that is, you know, tired
[49:58] that's been running around and doing
[49:59] stuff. You know, my prayer is that that
[50:02] none of us will will miss what the Lord
[50:04] is doing for us. That we can get maximum
[50:07] out of the service and that our physical
[50:08] tiredness will won't block us from
[50:10] getting everything we can out of the
[50:12] service. Um I also would like to pray
[50:15] for Carissa. She's um she's not feeling
[50:19] great. You're feeling good now. Praise
[50:21] the Lord. We'll pray for you anyway that
[50:24] the that the fever will come down. She's
[50:27] been battling with a very high fever.
[50:29] So we just want to lift it up before the
[50:31] Lord. If anyone else has a prayer
[50:33] request, you can share it or we can just
[50:36] pray
[50:38] anonymously. Okay, let's stand together
[50:40] and we take those things to the
[50:45] Lord. Wonderful father,
[50:48] Lord, oh father, my heart is just
[50:51] overjoyed with thankfulness to you. Oh
[50:54] Lord Jesus, my heart is just bubbling,
[50:56] Father, and appreciation for what you've
[50:59] been doing for us so far this weekend.
[51:02] Lord Jesus, you've been so good to us,
[51:04] Lord. You've been speaking to us,
[51:06] Father. Oh Lord, and tonight, Father, we
[51:09] we want to ask once more, Lord.
[51:12] Please, Lord, come on the scene again
[51:14] tonight. Father, speak to your hearts,
[51:17] oh God. But I pray that the same Holy
[51:19] Spirit that will take a hold of brother
[51:22] Alistister and speak through his lips,
[51:23] Lord, that that same Holy Spirit in each
[51:26] one of our hearts, Lord, will go past
[51:28] every barrier to receive what you have
[51:30] for us, Lord. Oh father, many are tired
[51:33] maybe and has been working hard and
[51:35] doing all sorts of things, Lord, but we
[51:37] want to lift each one up before you
[51:39] tonight and pray that you will just give
[51:40] us a fresh injection of your Holy
[51:43] Spirit, Father. That you will just let
[51:44] us be able to to connect and hear,
[51:48] Father, that our minds won't wander,
[51:50] that we won't feel drowsy, but Father,
[51:52] that we will have a a wonderful time
[51:54] with you. Amen. Oh Lord Jesus, I pray
[51:56] that you will just bless every part of
[51:58] this service. Oh Lord Jesus, I also want
[52:00] to pray for Carissa. Lord, lift her up
[52:03] before you Lord. I pray that you will
[52:05] complete the work that you've started,
[52:07] Lord. Father, we just come against the
[52:10] enemy that always would like to steal
[52:13] and rob the blessings that we can get,
[52:15] Father. And we just want to ask that
[52:17] you'll be gracious to her. Father, I
[52:18] pray for every unspoken request tonight.
[52:21] Father, pray that you will have your way
[52:23] in each one of those things. Oh God, we
[52:26] thank you and we ask it in the wonderful
[52:28] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[52:31] Amen. Amen. So, we're going to sing a
[52:34] song. Very unusual song. Brother
[52:37] Alistister. It's probably the first time
[52:38] you'll be called up with this
[52:42] song, but we need to make sure we're all
[52:44] awake before we start. Okay.
[52:49] I went to the enemy's camp and I took
[52:54] back what he stole from
[52:56] me. Took back what he stole from
[53:00] me. Took back what he stole from me. I
[53:04] went to the enemy's camp and I took back
[53:10] what he stole from me. He's under my
[53:13] feet. He's under my feet. He's under my
[53:17] feet. is under my feet. It's under my
[53:20] feet. It is under my feet. Satan is
[53:24] under my feet. Oh, I went to the enemy's
[53:29] camp and I took back my sto from me.
[53:36] My
[53:38] [Music]
[53:46] stomach
[53:49] my under my feet is under my feet. He's
[53:54] under my feet. He's under my feet. He's
[53:57] under my feet. He's under my feet. Satan
[54:02] is under my feet. Amen.
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:10] Amen. That's definitely a
[54:12] [Music]
[54:13] first. The Lord bless you. You may be
[54:20] seated.
[54:22] Amen. Good evening,
[54:25] saints. That's just a real privilege
[54:27] once again to be sharing God's word with
[54:30] you. I must say I certainly agree with
[54:33] this format of the camp.
[54:36] I think uh you you see what um how much
[54:41] of organization and cooking of food and
[54:45] preparing everything and I think it's
[54:48] not uh conducive to preach very long
[54:51] tiring
[54:52] services but just
[54:54] to bring something substantive that we
[54:57] could fellowship about encourage
[55:00] fellowship and questions is something
[55:03] definitely notable. Amen. So just uh
[55:08] amazed at all the people of God and all
[55:10] those who cooking team and it's been
[55:12] wonderful
[55:14] uh the
[55:16] IT tech all of you just it's been really
[55:19] really amazing cleanups you work like
[55:22] like a welloiled machine that's really
[55:26] good so it's really encouraging and may
[55:29] the Lord bless you and I just uh pray
[55:31] that God continues to just grow you from
[55:35] strength to strength and increase the
[55:37] light of God in your life in this area
[55:39] that you would really be a um a beacon
[55:42] of hope in this uh part of the world and
[55:46] just really my uh my prayer for you.
[55:49] Amen. So once again uh our subject how
[55:54] it all works and this is going to be
[55:56] part three and like we said uh we
[55:59] speaking tonight about rain and air.
[56:03] Amen. So
[56:05] children, you all remember. Good.
[56:08] They're never going to forget
[56:10] this. So today we're going to
[56:14] uh of course teaching on the seed. We're
[56:17] going to begin by reading Matthew
[56:19] chapter 4 verse of chapter
[56:21] 5:45. And it says that you may be the
[56:25] children of your father which is in
[56:27] heaven. For he maketh his son to rise on
[56:30] the evil and on the good, and sendeth
[56:34] rain on the just and on the unjust.
[56:37] Amen. It's very clear that the light of
[56:40] God hits the world. The rain hits the
[56:44] world without prejudice.
[56:46] Amen. So, but what is more important is
[56:51] that the rain falls on the just and the
[56:54] unjust. It falls on the wheat and the
[56:56] weeds.
[56:57] both rise up and say hallelujah, praise
[57:00] the Lord. But one is wheat and one is
[57:03] weeds. That's how it goes, right? So the
[57:07] world benefits from the revelation of
[57:09] the word of God. The word benefits from
[57:12] the divine nature expressed through the
[57:14] Holy Spirit. Amen. In a
[57:17] church, three kinds of believers will
[57:20] benefit from everything relating to the
[57:23] church. Nobody gets a negative part of
[57:26] the positive blessings of God. Everybody
[57:29] benefits. Like I said uh earlier, why
[57:33] not just follow the Lord? Give you a
[57:35] good even if you don't believe, just
[57:37] follow the rules, follow the the laws of
[57:39] God, follow the wisdom and advice.
[57:41] You'll actually live a better life
[57:42] because there are blessings that come
[57:44] out of it. But anyway, um so we're going
[57:48] to be looking at uh let's see if that's
[57:51] working. Yeah. So rain and air and so
[57:55] basically when we talking about rain
[57:57] we're talking about water because rain
[57:58] will fall uh through the atmosphere and
[58:02] become water on the wheat seed. Amen. So
[58:06] in this diagram that I put up there's
[58:09] the things we we are going to be
[58:11] speaking about. So you can see with that
[58:13] plant uh the plant is grown, there is
[58:17] light, there is air and there we're
[58:19] looking at the rain and we're going to
[58:21] speak about those things relating to the
[58:24] rain. So what I want you to see is you
[58:28] can see in that little diagram, can you
[58:30] see the water falls to the
[58:32] ground and water combined with ground
[58:37] does something for the seed? What are we
[58:40] talking about? how it all works because
[58:43] people put this stuff all over the place
[58:45] and they don't know. One of the the most
[58:48] uh uh amazing things about Christians is
[58:51] after 2,000 years of Holy Ghost
[58:53] dispensation, they don't know what's the
[58:55] Holy Ghost.
[58:57] It's incredible. And uh 2,000 years of
[59:00] church, they don't understand the
[59:02] purpose of church. That's why we need to
[59:04] know exactly where it fits, how it works
[59:06] through. Right? So, water combined with
[59:10] ground and air. Now, here's something
[59:13] that we're breaking
[59:15] into. Do you notice that water and or
[59:19] rain and air form the atmosphere?
[59:23] Atmosphere is very important for the
[59:25] seed, right? So, that's what we're
[59:27] looking at. And we want to understand
[59:29] atmosphere properly because in the
[59:31] church atmosphere is abused. Yes. It is
[59:35] not used correctly. it it is easily
[59:38] abused. So water combined with the
[59:41] ground and the air helps at first the
[59:44] seed to sprout before it becomes a
[59:47] plant. The air the water helps the
[59:51] ground to produce nutrients for the seed
[59:54] and the seed begins to grow. Are you
[59:55] with us? So what is rain? Rain is that
[1:00:00] which falls upon the
[1:00:02] ground. Falls upon tells you something.
[1:00:06] Okay. Falls upon gives us a clue as to
[1:00:09] what it symbolizes. So what it is is
[1:00:12] anointing.
[1:00:14] Can you see what it is? So if the ground
[1:00:16] is the chosen vessel, right? It is the
[1:00:19] body and the plant that comes out which
[1:00:22] is uh the manifestation the first
[1:00:24] manifestation the stalk the leaves
[1:00:26] that's going to be drawing on the air.
[1:00:28] So those of you know anything about
[1:00:29] plants it is the leaves of the plants
[1:00:32] that suck in the air of the atmosphere.
[1:00:35] That's that's the breathing mechanism,
[1:00:38] right? So what is
[1:00:43] anointing? That's what's important. Do I
[1:00:46] need
[1:00:47] anointing? Why do I need anointing? What
[1:00:49] is anointing for regarding the church?
[1:00:52] What is an anointing for regarding the
[1:00:55] believers? Anointing does not mean
[1:00:58] atmosphere. Anointing is part of
[1:01:00] atmosphere.
[1:01:02] Too many people mistake it for
[1:01:04] atmosphere or emotions.
[1:01:07] Anointing is not emotions. Emotions are
[1:01:10] emotions. You can have emotions without
[1:01:12] anointing.
[1:01:14] Exactly. And so this is what happens.
[1:01:17] We've got to be frank. We've got to be
[1:01:19] honest. In in the churches, you had
[1:01:21] charismatic part of the message. You had
[1:01:23] the intellectual part of the message.
[1:01:25] And the people who went with the
[1:01:27] charismatic and the sensations, they see
[1:01:30] the emotions and they say, "Wow, that's
[1:01:32] anointed."
[1:01:34] You can have emotions without any
[1:01:37] anointing.
[1:01:39] Or you can have emotions with false
[1:01:41] anointing. Yeah.
[1:01:43] You know when the prophet also spoke in
[1:01:46] anointed ones at the end time. Remember
[1:01:48] when when the books first came out in
[1:01:50] the message and I remember the brothers
[1:01:52] who probably haven't read the books,
[1:01:54] they were saying, "Brother, we're the
[1:01:56] anointed ones at the end time." Yeah.
[1:01:58] Exactly. But when you read the book,
[1:01:59] it's actually about the false anointed
[1:02:01] ones at the end
[1:02:02] time. Amen. He was talking about when
[1:02:05] there's a Moses, there's a Janis and
[1:02:06] Jambers. where there's a Zedekiah or
[1:02:10] where there's a Micaiah, there's a
[1:02:11] Zedekiah and the false prophets. And
[1:02:13] brother Baram in that message was saying
[1:02:16] that while there is the genuine
[1:02:18] anointed, there are others who have
[1:02:20] genuine gifts but are falsely anointed
[1:02:24] to actually receive a vision through
[1:02:28] their gift but it is against the vision
[1:02:30] of the truth. So if you read Zedekiah
[1:02:34] and the 400 prophets were not lying.
[1:02:37] They actually saw something. The Lord
[1:02:41] said uh who will go and be a lying
[1:02:43] spirit in the mouths of the prophets. So
[1:02:46] Zedekiah and then the reason he slapped
[1:02:48] Maya was not because uh he was an angry
[1:02:52] man. He they actually saw something.
[1:02:55] It was a truly anointed gift.
[1:03:00] That's what brother speaks about in
[1:03:02] anointed ones at the end time that it
[1:03:03] will be so close.
[1:03:05] Right? So what is
[1:03:09] anointing? Anointing is ability. It's
[1:03:13] power. It's not
[1:03:16] emotions. Anointing or power comes from
[1:03:20] influence. It is ability given by the
[1:03:23] Holy Spirit. When you talk about being
[1:03:26] anointed all I to me I don't get it why
[1:03:29] churches are still continuing about it
[1:03:32] being emotions. If a man is anointed
[1:03:35] when Samson was anointed it gave him
[1:03:37] ability. That's right. He wasn't
[1:03:39] speaking in tongues. He went off and
[1:03:41] tore a lion to pieces and it gave him
[1:03:44] abilities that are are and those
[1:03:47] abilities are the abilities needed for
[1:03:49] the day for the purpose of God for that
[1:03:52] day. Amen. Right. So when anointing or
[1:03:56] the influence of Christ came in Acts
[1:04:00] chapter 2, it produced abilities.
[1:04:04] The abilities were not the anointing.
[1:04:07] The anointing is the rain. The influence
[1:04:11] the influence of the Holy Spirit. Right?
[1:04:14] So you let me give you an example like
[1:04:18] let's assume in my church brother
[1:04:21] Alistister dies passes away and then
[1:04:24] they will say you know what his
[1:04:26] anointing is still here. What are they
[1:04:28] referring to? Parts of my character that
[1:04:32] still that my influence still
[1:04:34] remains. They're not saying my spirit is
[1:04:37] here doing something. It's my influence
[1:04:39] that still remains and becomes
[1:04:41] actionable among the people. Right? So
[1:04:44] my my influence is giving ability to
[1:04:47] people and that's what uh anointing
[1:04:50] really is. That's what the rain really
[1:04:52] is. So anointing is not atmosphere.
[1:04:55] Right? So too many people make it about
[1:04:59] atmosphere emotions because of the Greek
[1:05:01] word charisma which is charisma. Okay.
[1:05:05] Anyone can have charisma and charisma is
[1:05:09] dangerous. Charisma means uh or in the
[1:05:12] Greek is very different to what it means
[1:05:15] in English. It's not the same. So we
[1:05:18] charisma C H R I S M A is in the Greek.
[1:05:22] In the English it is charisma and we use
[1:05:25] it with charismatic and it's just wrong.
[1:05:28] It's not the same meaning. Right?
[1:05:30] Anointing means strength or ability.
[1:05:35] Amen. So the life of God is going to
[1:05:39] give you strength and ability to fulfill
[1:05:42] a purpose.
[1:05:44] That's what it's about. All right. So
[1:05:46] when we look at anointing, where does
[1:05:48] anointing come from? So most people in
[1:05:50] churches think anointing comes from this
[1:05:53] this mysterious Holy Ghost presence
[1:05:57] that does something. And it's like
[1:06:00] people don't know or cannot identify
[1:06:03] where it comes from. It's got to like
[1:06:05] it's almost like religions where you got
[1:06:06] to work yourself up into some kind of
[1:06:09] trance and then people get mesmerized or
[1:06:12] hypnotized or that's religious. That's
[1:06:15] not the Holy Ghost. That's not
[1:06:18] anointing. Where does influence come
[1:06:20] from? Influence comes from the word.
[1:06:26] Right? So when you look at this Holy
[1:06:28] Ghost anointing, it is affecting the
[1:06:30] spirit. Can you see the ground is your
[1:06:32] body?
[1:06:34] Right? But the whole portion above
[1:06:37] ground is spirit.
[1:06:39] Air forms part of spirit. Rain forms
[1:06:42] part of spirit. What is spirit? Brother
[1:06:44] said that's part of the mind. The mind
[1:06:46] is the womb of the soul. It's the place
[1:06:48] of reasoning. It's the place of logic.
[1:06:51] It's the place where seed can be sown
[1:06:53] here and thought can be sown and he said
[1:06:55] drops down to the soul and becomes
[1:06:57] alive. Right? So this is the area the
[1:07:00] spirit where it's your conscious uh
[1:07:04] realm right and somehow the other the
[1:07:07] holy ghost the holy spirit has to affect
[1:07:09] you like right now you're looking at me
[1:07:12] you're listening to me your eyes are
[1:07:14] taking everything in your ear iss taking
[1:07:16] everything in all that is going into
[1:07:18] your mind and you are processing it
[1:07:21] right this is your mind at work so this
[1:07:24] is already telling you you are listening
[1:07:27] to the word,
[1:07:30] right? And it's
[1:07:31] so powerful and so foolish at the same
[1:07:35] time. The Bible says the foolishness of
[1:07:38] preaching. Did you ever think of why
[1:07:41] it's foolishness? I mean, just look at
[1:07:43] all of you sitting here looking at
[1:07:46] me and I'm talking and you got so used
[1:07:49] to this, you don't think about it
[1:07:50] anymore.
[1:07:53] I mean, what am I saying to you? And
[1:07:54] then some of you are nodding along
[1:07:56] agreeing with me and some smiling and
[1:08:00] wow like what's going on? Why are we
[1:08:02] doing this stuff? It's so weird. Right.
[1:08:06] But we are made that way because words
[1:08:11] our influence.
[1:08:15] So where does where does ability come
[1:08:18] from? Where does anointing come? Word
[1:08:22] brings spoken word brings influence
[1:08:25] which brings ability.
[1:08:27] Right? So that's what we've got to focus
[1:08:30] on. It is that anointing that comes
[1:08:32] through the word. If you have anointing
[1:08:34] without the word, yeah, it's not the
[1:08:38] right anointing for this seed. Amen.
[1:08:42] Amen.
[1:08:43] That's it. So if anointing that people
[1:08:46] claim is singing and worship and
[1:08:50] shouting and screaming and all of that,
[1:08:52] that's not even it. That's not even
[1:08:54] close. Okay? That is not the anointing
[1:08:57] of God. That is you giving praise to
[1:09:01] him.
[1:09:03] See, so I want to show this to you
[1:09:06] because let's go to the scripture. Uh I
[1:09:08] want to show you because we've got
[1:09:10] former reign to talk about. We've got
[1:09:13] latter rain to talk about. And what
[1:09:15] reign actually is is spoken
[1:09:20] word. Amen. Spoken word. There it is.
[1:09:24] And five-fold ministry has been required
[1:09:27] in the time when the church is growing.
[1:09:30] When you are growing, you require the
[1:09:32] five-fold ministry because that's where
[1:09:33] your spoken word comes from.
[1:09:36] Written word is is read and interpreted
[1:09:40] by you. spoken word comes through
[1:09:43] atmosphere through the atmosphere to you
[1:09:46] like right now you're listening to
[1:09:48] something you're listening to something
[1:09:50] being spoken that that can either make
[1:09:53] you a believer or an
[1:09:55] unbeliever that can influence you in
[1:09:57] many different ways that influence can
[1:10:00] become ability you'll take what you hear
[1:10:02] you'll either put it into practice and
[1:10:04] you'll manifest it and it could become
[1:10:06] powerful and useful to you or it can
[1:10:09] become useless to you. Yeah.
[1:10:12] So, how many of you believe anointing is
[1:10:15] teaching?
[1:10:21] Scripture. But the anointing which you
[1:10:25] have received of him abideth in you, and
[1:10:28] you need not that any man teach you, but
[1:10:31] as the same anointing teacheth you of
[1:10:35] all things, and is truth and is no lie.
[1:10:39] And even as it had taught you, you shall
[1:10:42] abide in
[1:10:44] him. Anointing teaches
[1:10:47] you. Anointing is teaching.
[1:10:51] That's amazing.
[1:10:54] See, because this is what I mean. It's
[1:10:57] like this is so simple, but people have
[1:10:59] forgotten this over time. People are
[1:11:02] people assume that anointing. Oh,
[1:11:04] brother, that was an anointed service.
[1:11:06] What did he preach? I'm not really sure.
[1:11:10] But it was anointed.
[1:11:13] They're mixing
[1:11:15] up emotions.
[1:11:18] They don't know what he taught, but the
[1:11:20] feeling was great.
[1:11:24] And did you come out and become stronger
[1:11:26] in faith or you just more emotional?
[1:11:31] Amen. So what we see here in this part
[1:11:35] of the anointing which is actually the
[1:11:37] teaching of the word through the gifts
[1:11:39] of the Holy Spirit is we have two parts.
[1:11:43] former reign which brother Brandham says
[1:11:46] is teaching rain and latter rain. Amen.
[1:11:50] Now the thing about this uh teaching
[1:11:52] rain and latter rain is we've had
[1:11:55] denominations literally built upon it.
[1:11:58] Yeah. Right. So you can see harvest
[1:12:01] rain. So in terms of the plant we have
[1:12:04] uh teaching rain. He says I will send
[1:12:07] you I think I've got it here. Let's see.
[1:12:08] There it is in Hosea. Then shall we
[1:12:11] know, if we follow on to know the Lord,
[1:12:13] his going forth is prepared as the
[1:12:15] morning. He shall come unto us. He shall
[1:12:19] come unto us as the rain, as the latter
[1:12:24] and former rain unto the earth. God
[1:12:27] himself, his influence, his ability will
[1:12:31] come to us in
[1:12:35] teaching. Teaching reign with ability,
[1:12:38] right? and former and latter. So the
[1:12:41] prophet actually defines it for us and
[1:12:43] tells us what is former rain, what is
[1:12:45] teach, what is latter rain. So one type
[1:12:48] of rain actually starts the plant
[1:12:50] growing because you need the first rains
[1:12:52] to get the the the seed to germinate. Is
[1:12:55] that right? And that's the rain that God
[1:12:58] controls because you can't swamp the
[1:13:00] ground with it. The seed will rot. So uh
[1:13:04] sewing rain is very different to
[1:13:06] harvesting rain. Yeah. And then he says,
[1:13:10] so you understand the first influence
[1:13:12] when you are just a tender plant, a seed
[1:13:15] form is a different kind of you can't
[1:13:17] give this person the depths of the of
[1:13:20] the spoken word yet. You've got to start
[1:13:22] off with with with sewing rain. And he
[1:13:26] and he and he says we let's read it. He
[1:13:28] says, "Be glad then you children," this
[1:13:30] is Joel 2:23. Be glad then, you children
[1:13:33] of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your
[1:13:34] God, for he hath given you the former
[1:13:36] reign moderately.
[1:13:40] See, that's how he starts off with us.
[1:13:41] He's giving us moderate ability because
[1:13:45] you're still an infant,
[1:13:47] right? You're not uh going to give an
[1:13:50] infant a power tool.
[1:13:53] He doesn't even have the ability to use
[1:13:55] it, right? You're going to give him
[1:13:58] something small to deal with. But as he
[1:14:00] gets older, then you can let him handle
[1:14:02] the power tools, right? So um he gives
[1:14:06] you the former rain moderately and he
[1:14:08] will cause to come down for you the
[1:14:10] rain, the former rain and the latter
[1:14:13] rain in the first month. So when it
[1:14:15] comes time to the harvest, he brings
[1:14:17] back former rain and latter rain. Amen.
[1:14:20] Yes. Right. So there must be a falling
[1:14:23] of former. So he started off with former
[1:14:26] reign moderately teaching reign
[1:14:29] moderately in the very beginning stages
[1:14:32] but in the end you're going to get the
[1:14:33] fullness because you've come to maturity
[1:14:36] and it's going to be re so look at the
[1:14:38] people who want to res who want to go
[1:14:41] back and bring back gifts which was
[1:14:44] former part of former reign are teaching
[1:14:46] from way back then which was uh former
[1:14:50] reign in moderation Yeah.
[1:14:53] When now it's you're supposed it's like
[1:14:56] uh Hebrews chapter 5. Uh when the time
[1:14:59] is that you should be teachers, you are
[1:15:02] still desiring the sincere milk of the
[1:15:04] gospel.
[1:15:05] Whereas right now you should be those
[1:15:07] who have their senses exercised to
[1:15:10] discern both good and evil. You should
[1:15:13] all be teachers. This should be the time
[1:15:15] we are
[1:15:16] receiving former and latter rain in in
[1:15:19] its abundance to bring forth the fruit.
[1:15:21] It's the fruit stage. It's the
[1:15:23] manifestation time. Amen. And uh so just
[1:15:28] to give you some part, you know, growing
[1:15:30] up in South Africa,
[1:15:32] uh I'm not sure because I can only tell
[1:15:34] you my experience. I'm not sure what it
[1:15:36] was like here in New Zealand, but we had
[1:15:43] uh a
[1:15:45] barrage plethora I don't know what was
[1:15:48] of
[1:15:49] doctrines that that flew through our
[1:15:52] country
[1:15:54] that confused the people that shook them
[1:15:57] from left to right up and down and the
[1:16:00] poor people like didn't know who to
[1:16:02] believe or where to go. We had all
[1:16:05] kinds. We had the super emotional. We
[1:16:07] had the super intellectual. We had the
[1:16:10] reasoning. We had the ministries
[1:16:12] fighting with each other about about uh
[1:16:14] the the different doctrines, the seven
[1:16:16] seal, the holy ghost, the seven
[1:16:18] thunders, the cood. You had people who
[1:16:21] were tossed to and fro. You had this
[1:16:23] group that was called or the like the
[1:16:26] Perua group. And then you had like the
[1:16:27] seven thunder, seven virtues group. And
[1:16:29] then that came through in the 70s and
[1:16:31] 80s. And then you had these people who
[1:16:32] got terrified of both side and said,
[1:16:34] "Let's just stay with the ABCs.
[1:16:37] Let's just stay with COD. Let's just
[1:16:38] stay with water, baptism, godhead,
[1:16:41] serpent seed, and you know, get our
[1:16:43] lives right, dress right, do all keep
[1:16:45] all the rules right, and wait for the
[1:16:46] rapture. Leave those people." When we
[1:16:49] received them the message in Newcastle,
[1:16:52] uh my dad when he was the only church in
[1:16:54] Newcastle, so we had no influence from
[1:16:56] everybody else. But when the message
[1:16:58] came to us, they told us if you hear
[1:17:01] anyone talk about seven seal, seven
[1:17:04] thunders, third pull, don't believe
[1:17:05] them. They are false. Can you imagine
[1:17:07] giving people the message with that kind
[1:17:09] of uh beginning? And like few months
[1:17:13] later, my dad is reading the church ages
[1:17:15] and the seventh seal and he goes back to
[1:17:17] the same person and says, "But the
[1:17:18] seventh seal is
[1:17:20] open and we are in the third pool
[1:17:24] and the coming of the Lord is happening.
[1:17:27] brand new in the message and and saying
[1:17:29] that and then uh having already been
[1:17:32] told that you shouldn't be talking about
[1:17:34] it. And he said, "But how do well he
[1:17:37] says it in the books."
[1:17:41] So we had people confusing the teaching.
[1:17:46] But what happens when you don't get the
[1:17:48] right teaching? You're losing the
[1:17:50] ability. The power, the anointing is the
[1:17:54] ability. It's power. Anointing is power.
[1:17:58] It is ability.
[1:18:01] Right? So, do you all agree? Reign is
[1:18:04] teaching. I don't want to labor the
[1:18:05] point cuz I know you have it. Reign is
[1:18:08] spoken word which comes through
[1:18:10] five-fold ministry. It rains on the just
[1:18:13] and the unjust. We preach to three kinds
[1:18:15] of believers. We preach to all people.
[1:18:18] It's given freely. We express the word.
[1:18:21] Everyone receives it.
[1:18:24] But people will interpret it different,
[1:18:27] right? So it's going to need something.
[1:18:29] It's going to have to work with ground
[1:18:32] and air to be beneficial to the seed.
[1:18:36] Amen. So the purpose of the
[1:18:39] ministry and this is the difference and
[1:18:41] this is what you need to be aware
[1:18:43] of. Anyone can have a
[1:18:47] ministry. We have got so many we have
[1:18:50] got thousands of messages. We have got
[1:18:53] the table. We've got the Bible in every
[1:18:56] app possible. We have got everything at
[1:18:59] our fingertips. It is so easy to study
[1:19:01] the word and come and talk. It is so
[1:19:04] easy to to read the message or play
[1:19:07] tapes or and come and talk and and
[1:19:09] preach and claim to have a
[1:19:11] ministry. But is that ministry coming
[1:19:15] from God with ability?
[1:19:19] That's right. or is it coming across
[1:19:21] with a different agenda?
[1:19:25] We have been told that false Christ will
[1:19:27] arise and deceive many. We've been
[1:19:29] warned which means there will be giving
[1:19:32] people ability that is against the
[1:19:34] original seed. And here's the thing
[1:19:36] about the seed of God. It will not
[1:19:37] accept false ministry. It it it cannot
[1:19:41] thrive under that. It will seek to find
[1:19:45] the right thing. It will follow his
[1:19:46] voice. Amen. So the purpose of the
[1:19:50] ministry, young man, if you're desiring
[1:19:53] to get into the ministry someday, you
[1:19:56] have to meet God personally. Amen.
[1:19:59] Because you are working with the bride
[1:20:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's not a
[1:20:03] place to fool around. That's not a place
[1:20:05] to think you can stand there and deceive
[1:20:08] people or preach something to to make
[1:20:11] them or use charisma to convince.
[1:20:14] We are not here to convince you. Amen.
[1:20:17] Because if you are convinced into the
[1:20:19] message, you will be convinced out.
[1:20:22] And be convinced in so many other
[1:20:24] things. We are not here to do that. We
[1:20:26] are here to express the deep calling to
[1:20:28] the deep and the deep responding. There
[1:20:31] has to be something inside you. Whatever
[1:20:33] is inside you is going to draw something
[1:20:35] out. There's it's going to express a
[1:20:37] need and God's going to respond to that
[1:20:39] need. Amen.
[1:20:41] So if you are desiring something, people
[1:20:46] uh churches desire something. That's why
[1:20:48] churches even exist. They desire
[1:20:50] something and they will kick out a
[1:20:52] pastor and choose another one because
[1:20:54] it's convenient to them. They will u I'm
[1:20:57] talking about uh denominational
[1:20:59] Christian churches, right? everywhere.
[1:21:01] They will choose somebody who is
[1:21:03] convenient and if if something is not
[1:21:06] working out, they'll report him to the
[1:21:08] denominational headquarters and say,
[1:21:10] "Please get him out. Get someone else in
[1:21:12] here. This guy is too much of this and
[1:21:14] too much of that." And the next thing,
[1:21:16] they've changed the ministry. Right now,
[1:21:19] here's the beautiful part of it. What
[1:21:22] does water do with the
[1:21:25] seed? Water is absorbed through the
[1:21:29] ground.
[1:21:31] Right. So ability the spoken word is
[1:21:35] absorbed through the body through the
[1:21:38] ground. It understands because what is
[1:21:41] ability? Ability is to do something.
[1:21:45] What does anything? Your body. Your body
[1:21:48] has to act. Your body has to manifest
[1:21:52] what word it's receiving. Your body has
[1:21:55] to receive ability. Your eyes have to
[1:21:58] receive power. Your ears have to receive
[1:21:59] power. Your tongue has to receive power
[1:22:02] to express the word that it is
[1:22:03] receiving. You believe that? So what is
[1:22:06] now? Think of the seed, right? The water
[1:22:08] falls upon the ground. It's pooling over
[1:22:10] that mud and it gets sucked in and then
[1:22:13] the water
[1:22:15] disappears. And it it goes into this
[1:22:18] vessel. Beautiful. I hope you're seeing
[1:22:21] what I'm seeing right now. Here's the
[1:22:24] amazing thing. We spoke about all the
[1:22:26] nutrients in the ground. all the worms
[1:22:29] and smut and filth and you know all the
[1:22:32] nutrients, all the vitamins, right? How
[1:22:35] does the seed take in the nutrients?
[1:22:40] It it cannot extract the nutrients from
[1:22:43] the ground without water.
[1:22:46] Water is because the those tendrils from
[1:22:49] the roots are going to extract pull in
[1:22:52] water. The water will attach and absorb
[1:22:55] the nutrients in the soil. That means
[1:22:58] gifts that are in your body, abilities,
[1:23:01] conditions, things that are unique to
[1:23:03] you. The Holy Ghost through that word
[1:23:07] comes into that vessel and through that
[1:23:10] water, it's going to absorb what is
[1:23:13] needed for the seed.
[1:23:15] That's how water, what are we talking
[1:23:17] about? How it all works together. That's
[1:23:19] why you need the Holy Ghost. Let's make
[1:23:22] it
[1:23:23] plain. Whatever gift you have, you can
[1:23:26] use it in any different way.
[1:23:29] Whatever situation you have, let's say
[1:23:30] even the bad things that happen in your
[1:23:32] life, you will never be able to
[1:23:35] weaponize it effectively without the
[1:23:38] spoken word.
[1:23:40] Because you cannot yourself absorb it
[1:23:42] into your soul to make it effective
[1:23:45] through that seed. That's why you need
[1:23:47] the anointing of God. The anointing
[1:23:50] which only comes from the word rain
[1:23:52] forms a special part of the work of the
[1:23:55] Holy Ghost that is beyond gifts.
[1:23:59] Th this ability we're we're not talking
[1:24:01] about tongues interpretations prophecies
[1:24:04] dreams and visions. Okay, I feel we need
[1:24:07] to settle that.
[1:24:10] Tongues, prophecies, dreams, visions
[1:24:13] were given for an infant church when
[1:24:18] there was no fullness of the word.
[1:24:21] Why? All they had was the gospel of
[1:24:24] Christ that Christ died, rose again.
[1:24:26] There's a resurrection. Acts chapter 2
[1:24:29] came in. They had no Bible. They had no
[1:24:33] uh nothing else but their witness of
[1:24:35] Christ. They needed to take the gospel
[1:24:38] of Christ to the world having no text,
[1:24:42] no scripture, no training. The only way
[1:24:45] you could appeal to Gentiles was through
[1:24:48] the gifts of the Holy Ghost. That's the
[1:24:51] purpose for the gifts. If you have the
[1:24:54] husband who is the word today, what is
[1:24:57] the reason for wanting gifts,
[1:25:01] prophecies, dreams, visions?
[1:25:03] What can dreams, visions, prophecies,
[1:25:05] and gifts of the Holy Ghost do that is
[1:25:08] above the revealed word of the hour?
[1:25:12] The revealed word of the hour is the
[1:25:14] husband.
[1:25:15] The giver of gifts. You are married to
[1:25:18] the giver.
[1:25:20] You You needed gifts when you were
[1:25:22] espoused,
[1:25:24] when you were engaged, when you were
[1:25:27] betrothed. But when you are married, why
[1:25:30] are you still desiring those things?
[1:25:33] At this point in your life, if you have
[1:25:35] received the open book, you why are you
[1:25:38] why are we trying to resurrect something
[1:25:40] that was necessary for infant church?
[1:25:44] Amen. If you are doing that, it means
[1:25:47] you are not feeding on the revealed word
[1:25:49] of the hour.
[1:25:51] So, we're not saying that gifts cannot
[1:25:53] happen in a church because there are
[1:25:54] always new people that come in who need
[1:25:58] a confirmation via the gift. And if the
[1:26:01] Lord wills, he will allow gifts to
[1:26:04] operate. Don't disregard the scripture.
[1:26:07] Where there are prophecies, they will
[1:26:10] fail. Where there are tongues, they will
[1:26:13] fail. Where there are all those gifts,
[1:26:15] they will fail. But charity never
[1:26:18] faileth. What is charity? Love the
[1:26:21] capstone.
[1:26:24] Go on with it. When I was a child, I
[1:26:26] spake as a child. Yeah, that was Acts
[1:26:29] chapter 2. I did this as a child. I did
[1:26:32] that. But when I became a man, I put
[1:26:36] away childish things.
[1:26:39] Read the context of 1 Corinthians 12 and
[1:26:42] 13. It was talking about the gifts,
[1:26:45] gifts of the Holy Ghost. I give you the
[1:26:47] gifts of the Holy Ghost. It even tells
[1:26:49] them tongues is the least of the gifts.
[1:26:52] Yeah.
[1:26:54] You know, I when I preached this in my
[1:26:57] church, one of my older sons came to me
[1:27:00] and said, "Dad, what gift do you
[1:27:02] have?" I said, "Nobody's ever asked me
[1:27:05] that
[1:27:06] before. Let me sit
[1:27:08] down." He said, and then before I
[1:27:11] answered, he said, "I feel like your
[1:27:13] gifts are wisdom and
[1:27:15] knowledge." I
[1:27:18] said, "I I I don't know what to say." He
[1:27:21] said, "Because you obviously don't
[1:27:23] prophesy. You don't speak with tongues."
[1:27:25] And he said, "Nobody seems to want those
[1:27:27] ones, but they are mentioned
[1:27:29] first." I said, "Well, because no one
[1:27:32] has asked me that before, I kind of feel
[1:27:34] like you're right because all that I
[1:27:37] ever do to help people is take the word
[1:27:39] and give them the wisdom of the word."
[1:27:40] And advice and counseling seems to be
[1:27:43] the most of my life, right? So remember
[1:27:47] what you actually need today is the
[1:27:50] spoken word which comes across in an
[1:27:53] application of wisdom. You need the
[1:27:56] wisdom of the Lord today. If you have
[1:27:58] the open book, you are you are supposed
[1:28:00] to be speaking and when it says
[1:28:03] prophesy, what is it actually saying,
[1:28:06] right? to all kindreds, nation, tribes,
[1:28:08] and tongue. You are supposed to be
[1:28:10] giving this word across to the people
[1:28:13] because you have the revelation of all
[1:28:15] things. That's right. That's where the
[1:28:17] church is supposed to be. We are not
[1:28:19] supposed to be desiring the sincere milk
[1:28:23] of the word. This is the day of
[1:28:25] teaching,
[1:28:27] true full complete teaching of the word.
[1:28:30] Amen. It's a very sensitive subject
[1:28:34] in many places in the message all across
[1:28:36] the world because everyone has this kind
[1:28:39] of uh um idea of what the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:44] and different most places see the Holy
[1:28:47] Ghost as um like atmosphere like
[1:28:50] emotions. It is atmosphere but we'll
[1:28:52] we'll talk about that. You know, brother
[1:28:54] Bam says you can take an egg and put it
[1:28:56] under a puppy and it will still hatch
[1:28:59] because anything can create an
[1:29:00] atmosphere, right? What do we need? And
[1:29:04] we're coming to that in a little while.
[1:29:07] So rain forms a special part of the work
[1:29:10] of the Holy Ghost that is beyond the
[1:29:12] gift. Are you still with us? So the Holy
[1:29:15] Ghost
[1:29:17] preaching anoints the body and the
[1:29:20] spirit, the ground and the life within
[1:29:23] the plant. Is that right? That the water
[1:29:26] gets sucked up into the seed, the seed
[1:29:28] swells, the seed breaks open, it
[1:29:31] releases the life, roots come out, and
[1:29:34] then the
[1:29:36] roots get stuck into the ground. I love
[1:29:40] that. That seed gets stuck into me.
[1:29:45] It starts using me. And the more water
[1:29:48] falls into that, it starts taking all my
[1:29:52] habits, all my uniqueness, all my bad
[1:29:57] speech, right? This weird man that I am
[1:30:02] and uses it in ways I had no
[1:30:09] ide even confesses who he was. every
[1:30:13] single son of God uh confesses who he
[1:30:16] was and and his inabilities,
[1:30:19] right? And his his inability to have
[1:30:22] confidence and now the the seed starts
[1:30:24] getting stuck in and roots start to
[1:30:27] start moving and it starts pulling from
[1:30:30] my experiences, from my failures, from
[1:30:33] my good points, from my positives, from
[1:30:35] my genetics, from everywhere and it
[1:30:37] starts giving me ability. Yeah. Right.
[1:30:41] And the plant absorbs the water through
[1:30:44] the ground. That's
[1:30:46] why you need to physically be in church.
[1:30:52] Amen. Your body has to literally be here
[1:30:55] and hear the word.
[1:30:58] Amen. This cyber stuff is something
[1:31:01] else, right? You have to be
[1:31:04] here. So the root then uses the water to
[1:31:08] absorb nutrients from the ground. The
[1:31:10] life of God in the believer uses this
[1:31:13] anointing of the word to give good
[1:31:15] abilities for the purpose of God for
[1:31:18] this day. Right? So what is the purpose
[1:31:22] of the bride
[1:31:24] today? Right? We need to know why are
[1:31:28] you a church here in this place? What
[1:31:31] why are we even here? Why are we still
[1:31:33] continuing
[1:31:35] this machine? What's going on? There is
[1:31:39] a purpose that we have. There is a
[1:31:41] global purpose that we have. There is a
[1:31:45] a purpose here in the town where you
[1:31:47] live. There is a purpose in the
[1:31:49] families. There is a purpose that you
[1:31:51] have to find which is only related to
[1:31:53] the bride. You are the only people on
[1:31:56] the face of the earth in the history of
[1:31:58] time.
[1:32:00] That is under an anointing of being the
[1:32:04] husband uh the wife of the word. Yeah,
[1:32:08] you are the only people that ever
[1:32:10] existed since the fall of man that can
[1:32:13] have this their body, soul, and spirit
[1:32:16] married to the word. Amen. That's what
[1:32:20] the open book has
[1:32:21] done. Right? That comes with a purpose
[1:32:24] which I'm not going to speak about this
[1:32:25] weekend.
[1:32:27] doctrines from that spoken word which
[1:32:30] comes freely to you allow the body to
[1:32:33] behave in a manner that is in line with
[1:32:36] the life of the seed. So there's a seed
[1:32:38] stuck inside, right? God has sewn it.
[1:32:40] You don't know, you barely know what the
[1:32:44] truth really is. You don't even know uh
[1:32:48] what the seed needs. You don't know what
[1:32:52] divine nature the seed is going to
[1:32:54] produce. But this seed is going to
[1:32:57] respond to the divine nature that God is
[1:32:59] going to give. This seed knows this this
[1:33:03] gene knows. It's going to respond to
[1:33:06] that. Right? So when why do you say
[1:33:10] amen? Because something inside responds
[1:33:13] to that which is conducive to the seed.
[1:33:17] If it isn't, you don't respond. Right?
[1:33:20] So you will hear a spoken word, it will
[1:33:22] rain down upon you and the seed will
[1:33:25] respond.
[1:33:26] Right? That's that deep calling to the
[1:33:28] deep. So doctrines is what is preached
[1:33:32] by the five-fold ministry. We call it
[1:33:34] doctrines. You know what doctrines
[1:33:36] actually are? Doctrines are applications
[1:33:39] of
[1:33:40] teaching. Like Paul says, the doctrines
[1:33:42] of baptism. Baptism is an application of
[1:33:45] teaching. Right? Doctrine is what the
[1:33:48] church
[1:33:49] practices. We too loosely use the word
[1:33:52] doctrine. We think well the seventh
[1:33:54] under doctrine. No, that's a seventh
[1:33:57] teaching.
[1:33:58] The doctrine is the application of that
[1:34:01] teaching. So doctrine becomes the
[1:34:04] strength of the plant is the application
[1:34:07] of what it has absorbed. Are you with
[1:34:09] us? This doesn't sound too much like a
[1:34:11] biology lecture, does it?
[1:34:15] But it's how you understand how
[1:34:17] everything works. So the purpose of the
[1:34:19] Holy Ghost, here it is. The Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] comes. You were born conceived in sin,
[1:34:26] conceived by sexual desire. You come
[1:34:29] with already the nature of a mammal
[1:34:32] beast. You come with passions, lusts,
[1:34:37] desires. And uh in the Bible, lust is
[1:34:40] not just speaking about sexuality. Lust
[1:34:44] is a desire for anything pleasurable,
[1:34:48] food, drink, entertainment,
[1:34:51] right? They are all lust. There are deep
[1:34:54] desires that come from within. Right? So
[1:34:57] the purpose of the Holy Ghost and this
[1:35:00] is why you need to be in church. This is
[1:35:01] why it is necessary. It suppresses lust
[1:35:06] to give you the ability to believe.
[1:35:08] Yeah.
[1:35:11] That's why you need the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:12] Without the Holy Ghost, you're an
[1:35:14] animal.
[1:35:16] You know the quote, take the Holy Ghost
[1:35:18] off a man, he becomes brute beast. COD.
[1:35:21] Is that right? So, the purpose of the
[1:35:23] Holy Ghost, young people, why do you
[1:35:25] need the Holy Ghost? Because the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost suppresses lust. Because lust make
[1:35:30] you a wild
[1:35:32] creature. It's like if if ever you had a
[1:35:36] whole bunch of puppies, have you seen
[1:35:38] You can't teach those things manners.
[1:35:41] You just put like food there on the
[1:35:43] floor. Like if you have 12 puppies and
[1:35:45] you just put a
[1:35:47] little like all of them and then while
[1:35:50] while he's eating his one is he's got
[1:35:51] his eye on the other one's bowl.
[1:35:56] Have you seen that? That's what you you
[1:35:58] will become like without the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:01] You just want this that that's
[1:36:03] satisfying you and then you eyeing
[1:36:04] something and you coveting something
[1:36:06] else and then you want that too and then
[1:36:07] you didn't get enough of that and then
[1:36:08] you want that. Can that's what humans
[1:36:11] are like without the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:13] Exactly. The purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:16] is to subdue the negative character,
[1:36:20] right? So that the body and spirit can
[1:36:23] have a positive character and that will
[1:36:25] show itself. So there is another part of
[1:36:28] the Holy Ghost and that is the air.
[1:36:31] Amen. So what you need to do is
[1:36:34] understand what the Holy Ghost is, what
[1:36:36] the Holy Spirit is and the purpose of
[1:36:38] the Holy Ghost. Now here's a
[1:36:42] problem. If you have torrential
[1:36:48] rains, you do destroy the seed,
[1:36:52] right? Because you're going to wash out
[1:36:54] the seed. So you can't be a church that
[1:36:59] is like all you ever get is
[1:37:02] like torrential rains like just teaching
[1:37:06] teaching teaching teaching you know and
[1:37:09] and is basically hammering the ground
[1:37:13] and the people you can actually see them
[1:37:15] tiring just can't make it anymore year
[1:37:18] after year after year they're desiring
[1:37:21] just some relief
[1:37:24] at the same time
[1:37:28] drought, right? It needs the right
[1:37:31] amount of rain. That's so beautiful
[1:37:33] because he tells you, I send you the
[1:37:35] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:37:37] first month. So, there is a sewing rain
[1:37:40] and a harvest rain. Don't you love him,
[1:37:42] saints?
[1:37:44] All right, let's go to the
[1:37:45] air. And this is equally beautiful,
[1:37:49] right? That beautiful
[1:37:51] crisp space.
[1:37:54] around
[1:37:56] everything. What do you think air is?
[1:37:58] And this is where it becomes really
[1:38:01] personal to you and this is going to
[1:38:03] give you purpose within your own
[1:38:06] church. What is air? Okay, air with a
[1:38:10] plant. We know we take air for granted.
[1:38:13] Yes. We breathe it
[1:38:18] in and out. It's amazing. You try it
[1:38:22] every once in a while. You just get so
[1:38:26] relaxed. Nighttime the plants breathe in
[1:38:29] the carbon dioxide and kick out oxygen
[1:38:33] for us. We breathe out the carbon
[1:38:35] dioxide for the for the for the trees to
[1:38:37] breathe in. It's just the circulation of
[1:38:39] atmosphere and it's so beautiful. It
[1:38:43] speaks of a spiritual
[1:38:44] dimension. It's so mysterious. It's
[1:38:47] around us. It has moisture and it has
[1:38:49] nitrogen. And it's got the right amount
[1:38:51] of carbon dioxide and oxygen at a
[1:38:53] certain level. It it uh allows carbon
[1:38:57] dioxide to rise to create greenhouse so
[1:38:59] that there's enough moisture kept in and
[1:39:02] it filters out the heat. The ultraviolet
[1:39:05] rays so that it that the light just
[1:39:07] doesn't burn everything to to to
[1:39:10] crisp. This this air we take for
[1:39:13] granted. It's so beautiful. That's
[1:39:14] right. It's cooling. It's satisfying.
[1:39:18] And once in a while we get this strange
[1:39:20] force that blows air at us. The winds of
[1:39:24] his spirit
[1:39:25] rushing mighty wind sometimes.
[1:39:28] It's amazing. Air speaks of
[1:39:32] atmosphere.
[1:39:33] Amen. What is atmosphere responsible
[1:39:36] for? For the right climate.
[1:39:42] What is climate? The right conditions
[1:39:44] for the growth of the plant. Air has
[1:39:47] natural gases, temperatures. It it uh
[1:39:51] regulates the
[1:39:53] temperature, right? And it brings in the
[1:39:56] right gases that sometimes at uh you
[1:39:58] will see at ponds and swamps there's
[1:40:02] like high nitrogen and and it's
[1:40:04] necessary. That's why our governments
[1:40:06] keep swamps because they produce the
[1:40:09] right amount of gases. And they tell you
[1:40:11] if you're in regions where there's lots
[1:40:12] of frogs, it's a healthy ecological
[1:40:14] system. For for those who don't like
[1:40:17] frogs, bad luck. We need them around,
[1:40:21] right? And you hear all that croaking
[1:40:23] and everything. All those creatures work
[1:40:26] together and release things into the
[1:40:28] atmosphere and they're all working so
[1:40:30] beautifully for us. This air that we
[1:40:33] breathe that we depend on. If you ever
[1:40:37] saw
[1:40:38] people struggling to breathe, you
[1:40:41] realize how precious air is.
[1:40:45] Some some lung disease or anaphylactic
[1:40:48] shock or something where they're
[1:40:49] allergic to peanuts or something and
[1:40:52] they're it's the worst thing ever.
[1:40:54] Somebody struggling to breathe.
[1:40:56] Suffocation. Why is this important?
[1:40:59] Right. What does air do? Air works in
[1:41:02] conjunction with light. Yeah. Yes.
[1:41:06] Right. Because there's this amazing
[1:41:08] process called photosynthesis
[1:41:11] in the leaves which it's going to work
[1:41:14] together with light, air and water
[1:41:17] because the water is going to come in
[1:41:19] and then this amazing thing called
[1:41:22] sugars
[1:41:24] which has the energy which is the food
[1:41:27] created for the plant to grow. Right? So
[1:41:31] air is the perfect medium because light
[1:41:35] uses air to go through to hit the plant.
[1:41:39] Are we together? So it's what does it
[1:41:42] speaks of spiritually? What creates the
[1:41:44] atmosphere? What creates the air?
[1:41:49] Okay, that is the
[1:41:53] church. That is the church.
[1:41:56] That's why
[1:41:59] God ordained the
[1:42:01] church. Did you know what church is
[1:42:04] really
[1:42:05] about? Church is what creates the
[1:42:08] atmosphere for believing.
[1:42:12] That's why you do not forsake the
[1:42:14] assembling together of the saints.
[1:42:18] That's what church is about. Church is a
[1:42:21] part of the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:42:23] assistance of the gifts. Like while
[1:42:26] thinking on these thoughts, I'm I'm
[1:42:27] watching here, watching you. I'm always
[1:42:30] watching everything. It just you just
[1:42:32] can't help it. But I've seen how some of
[1:42:35] you older sisters, you just know you
[1:42:38] need to help the belief of the younger
[1:42:39] sisters. So you you come in during the
[1:42:41] service, you help with their children.
[1:42:44] It's like without thinking, you just
[1:42:45] know, let let me hold your child. Let me
[1:42:47] take care of your child for you while,
[1:42:48] you know, while you're busy because I
[1:42:50] also want you to enjoy the service. And
[1:42:52] I also What are you doing? You're giving
[1:42:54] them you're giving them space to
[1:42:55] breathe.
[1:42:58] Simple things, not even supernatural
[1:43:02] gifts.
[1:43:04] What happens when you're a new person
[1:43:05] coming into your church? The members of
[1:43:08] the church are going to give them air to
[1:43:12] breathe. They're going to set the right
[1:43:14] atmosphere for believing. That's a
[1:43:16] quote, by the way. You've got to create
[1:43:18] the atmosphere for believing. What is
[1:43:21] the church doing with the worship
[1:43:23] service with the prayer? So what what is
[1:43:26] this tradition we are we are keeping?
[1:43:29] Why are we even doing what we are doing?
[1:43:32] Because we want to create the atmosphere
[1:43:34] for believing. It's only about that.
[1:43:39] Right? So church gives focus. It gives
[1:43:42] purpose. It gives direction to the seed.
[1:43:45] Right? It provides an atmosphere in
[1:43:48] which plants can grow.
[1:43:52] Now think about it. What do you do in a
[1:43:54] constrictive atmosphere?
[1:43:58] Think about what Christ said. Your
[1:44:01] traditions made the word of none effect.
[1:44:07] That's what happens when a
[1:44:09] church becomes a traditional thing, a
[1:44:12] religion. If it becomes oppressive, if
[1:44:15] it becomes liberal, what is it doing?
[1:44:17] It's breaking down the atmosphere of
[1:44:20] believing. Why would people follow a
[1:44:23] false
[1:44:24] doctrine? Why would people follow uh
[1:44:28] weird things? Because the church is
[1:44:30] creating an atmosphere that is conducive
[1:44:33] to that. And then the plant
[1:44:36] becomes corrupt.
[1:44:39] So each one of you remember I told you
[1:44:41] in the first service, you're going to
[1:44:43] learn about what it is you what purpose
[1:44:45] you actually have. I told you in the
[1:44:47] beginning, when you realize what all
[1:44:49] this is about, you realize you're not
[1:44:50] coming to church for yourself. Amen. You
[1:44:54] are here to create the atmosphere of
[1:44:57] believing for one and all.
[1:45:01] Not just for you here in New Zealand,
[1:45:02] but also for me somewhere else and for
[1:45:05] other people. So, you'll notice how
[1:45:08] quick you get in line when a new person
[1:45:10] comes into church. It's like
[1:45:12] instinctively. You're not thinking, "Oh
[1:45:14] yeah, another member, more tithes, more
[1:45:16] offerings." You're not even thinking
[1:45:18] about that. You're thinking, "How can I
[1:45:20] help?
[1:45:22] How can I assist you understand? How can
[1:45:24] I make you comfortable? How can I make
[1:45:26] things easier for you? How can I You're
[1:45:27] not used to it." What happens then when
[1:45:31] you become a church that somebody walks
[1:45:34] in and they're they got lipstick and
[1:45:36] earrings and what are you going to do?
[1:45:38] Are you going to make an atmosphere of
[1:45:40] believing
[1:45:41] or rejection? Yeah.
[1:45:44] What happens when your children are
[1:45:46] growing? Are you going to create an
[1:45:47] atmosphere of believing or something
[1:45:50] that forces them out? Something that
[1:45:52] stifles air that is smutty, full of fog.
[1:45:56] You It's It makes things invisible. You
[1:45:58] can't even see the word. The air is even
[1:46:01] working against the rain which is the
[1:46:03] spoken word.
[1:46:05] It means every one of us has the
[1:46:09] responsibility when we come in here to
[1:46:12] create the atmosphere of believing and
[1:46:14] being a church is not here only in the
[1:46:18] sanctuary it's on the outside.
[1:46:21] I asked my church recently, I said to
[1:46:23] them, when I go out and preach wherever
[1:46:27] I am, I'm representing you. That's
[1:46:30] right. I'm standing there. I'm
[1:46:32] respecting the people. I'm dressed
[1:46:34] respectfully. I'm respecting you. I'm
[1:46:37] standing there. When I'm there, you're
[1:46:39] looking and you're saying, "That's my
[1:46:40] pastor.
[1:46:42] Can you imagine if I I said to them, can
[1:46:44] you imagine if I came here and I spoke
[1:46:46] in horrible language and acted like a
[1:46:48] fool in front of the whole world and and
[1:46:51] uh used bad, you know, terminology and
[1:46:54] made weird jokes behind the pulpit and
[1:46:56] and uh spoke confusing things that
[1:46:59] nobody can understand and made a mockery
[1:47:02] of the message. What would you be
[1:47:03] saying? Because I'm representing you. I
[1:47:06] said this to my church. I said, "So when
[1:47:09] you are out there at work, you're
[1:47:11] representing me." That's right. When
[1:47:13] you're at school, at university, you're
[1:47:15] representing me. You are the church. You
[1:47:17] are a reflection of me. Where I go, I
[1:47:20] stand for you. You should stand for me.
[1:47:23] You should stand for each other. You are
[1:47:25] not just responsible for yourself. When
[1:47:27] you're out with your friends and you're
[1:47:29] listening to jokes full of filth, you
[1:47:31] are there representing me. You are a
[1:47:34] representation. A church is the body.
[1:47:37] Just by your misstep on the outside, you
[1:47:41] spoil the atmosphere of believing for
[1:47:43] others.
[1:47:45] You have a responsibility to others. Why
[1:47:49] are we still tossed about? Why are we
[1:47:52] still here? Why is it not
[1:47:55] accelerating? Why are people fainting?
[1:47:58] Why are they running the race and then
[1:48:00] being hindered?
[1:48:02] Why are we losing the ability to be
[1:48:04] responsible to one another to create the
[1:48:08] air that we can breathe?
[1:48:13] Amen. Where the rain works through the
[1:48:16] ground to germinate the seed to help the
[1:48:19] root to absorb nutrients, the air works
[1:48:22] with light. Amen. To transform the
[1:48:27] nutrients into that magic food called
[1:48:30] sugar.
[1:48:32] We're going to learn about light
[1:48:34] tomorrow. Right? So what I'm saying is
[1:48:37] you can preach doctrines and you can
[1:48:40] have charisma. You can have
[1:48:44] uh emotional
[1:48:45] services that the reason why people will
[1:48:49] not receive light is the air is to
[1:48:54] dance. You'll be living under a cloud of
[1:48:57] darkness, gloom. the air if so these are
[1:49:01] so there's so many important things to
[1:49:03] this this is why before the Sunday
[1:49:06] service you make sure Saturday night
[1:49:08] you're not on the town
[1:49:11] out you're you're prayed up you're
[1:49:14] meditating you're praying for your
[1:49:16] pastor you're praying for the minister
[1:49:17] who's going to preach you're thinking
[1:49:19] Lord let him preach something that
[1:49:21] benefits my soul let him preach
[1:49:24] something that's for my children let him
[1:49:26] preach something that's you're
[1:49:27] meditating you're coming prepared head
[1:49:29] to create an atmosphere of believing
[1:49:34] you love him saints air must this is the
[1:49:38] important part and I'm I'm going to
[1:49:40] close it down just now uh I'm uh air
[1:49:44] must create the right atmosphere for the
[1:49:47] plant to absorb
[1:49:49] light do you see rain works with the
[1:49:52] ground light works with the
[1:49:55] air light tempers the air I mean the air
[1:49:58] tempers the light because the light is
[1:50:00] too powerful. Light has heat with it.
[1:50:04] Light can burn the plant. Air has to the
[1:50:07] the atmosphere of believing um helps the
[1:50:11] plant to absorb light with the right uh
[1:50:14] temperature to to create food that
[1:50:17] sustains. What's the ultimate? We want
[1:50:19] the seed to come out in the end time.
[1:50:23] And then there's going to be light that
[1:50:25] burns that shock.
[1:50:27] That's the That's the end light. Amen.
[1:50:30] And we got to see what that light is. So
[1:50:33] air must create the right atmosphere.
[1:50:35] We're almost
[1:50:36] done. So what is the role of the church?
[1:50:40] Think about all that we have to do,
[1:50:42] right? Creating the atmosphere of
[1:50:44] believing. We must correctly manage the
[1:50:49] gifts, right? We are given those
[1:50:51] instructions. We want the the the New
[1:50:53] Testament is full of instructions for
[1:50:55] for the church correctly managing the
[1:50:58] gifts. If we don't I'll give you some
[1:51:01] examples,
[1:51:02] right? If you
[1:51:05] uh
[1:51:07] um take gifts that are in the church,
[1:51:09] all right, it seems to me that I don't
[1:51:12] know why, but a lot of the gifted people
[1:51:16] with like dreams and visions and and
[1:51:18] even sometimes speaking with tongues
[1:51:20] seem to be women.
[1:51:22] There's always more women than
[1:51:24] men. And it it becomes problematic. I I
[1:51:28] don't I don't know why I'm saying all
[1:51:29] this, but it's from my experience. In
[1:51:32] our church, when we had people with the
[1:51:34] gifts, I wouldn't let the sister come
[1:51:38] and talk to me by herself. If she saw a
[1:51:42] dream or a vision, I asked her to write
[1:51:44] it down like the prophet says. Because
[1:51:46] if you don't write it down, you can
[1:51:48] redream it just based on your human
[1:51:50] ability.
[1:51:51] And then your after God has given it to
[1:51:54] you, you can redream it because it's
[1:51:56] bothering you and your own nature adds
[1:51:58] stuff to it. So write it down. Then go
[1:52:02] through your husband because if you're a
[1:52:05] sister, your gift must operate through
[1:52:08] your
[1:52:08] headship because that will keep that
[1:52:11] gift
[1:52:12] humble. Cuz what I've seen is when
[1:52:14] sisters have an a gift of something,
[1:52:16] they start to spiritually overpower the
[1:52:18] man. The poor guy gets terrified in case
[1:52:21] she has a dream about
[1:52:23] him. I literally heard that from a man.
[1:52:27] He was like, I don't even want to know,
[1:52:29] brother. I'm terrified. What if she I
[1:52:31] was like, if you're not doing anything
[1:52:33] wrong, why are you terrified? You know,
[1:52:36] but so I helped them to keep this under
[1:52:39] headship because gifts have to come
[1:52:42] under subjection,
[1:52:44] right? So I'm just I'm just giving you
[1:52:47] one example. Look at what Paul tells
[1:52:49] them. Uh if you're going to speak with
[1:52:52] tongues and there's no interpretation,
[1:52:55] don't don't you can't even just come and
[1:52:58] say, "Well, I couldn't help it. The Holy
[1:52:59] Ghost is no." Paul says, "Don't. It's
[1:53:02] it's not needful and it's not beneficial
[1:53:05] to the church." He says, "You're like a
[1:53:07] barbarian. You're speaking to me in
[1:53:08] something I don't understand. What's the
[1:53:10] point of prophesying in tongues and
[1:53:11] there's no interpreter?"
[1:53:13] So, if there's going to be tongues,
[1:53:15] there must be an interpretation. Yes.
[1:53:17] Amen.
[1:53:19] Right. And I'm sorry this rabbi.
[1:53:25] What is that's
[1:53:28] glossalia? Don't come and fool me with
[1:53:30] that stuff. That's what the Pentecostals
[1:53:33] do. I just said the same thing because I
[1:53:35] heard it so often. Did that mean I spoke
[1:53:37] in tongues?
[1:53:39] According to Acts chapter 2, they spoke
[1:53:41] in other people's languages. That's
[1:53:43] right.
[1:53:45] Why do we not see that? And in brother
[1:53:48] Baron's church, there was a a person who
[1:53:50] spoke French and there was a French man
[1:53:52] who interpreted it.
[1:53:56] See, don't accept Pentecostalism which
[1:53:58] is on
[1:54:00] drugs. You know, it's like in a frenzy.
[1:54:04] It's Pentecostalism. It's abused
[1:54:07] Pentecostalism.
[1:54:08] Why can it not be according to the
[1:54:10] scripture? When you do that, when you
[1:54:12] allow those things to run free, they
[1:54:15] create an atmosphere which is not
[1:54:17] conducive to believing the open book.
[1:54:21] It's against the open book. When the
[1:54:22] it's time for the for the intense light
[1:54:25] to come to create rapturing faith,
[1:54:28] you're still babies.
[1:54:30] And it's the church's duty to create the
[1:54:33] atmosphere of believing. Amen. Handle
[1:54:36] the gifts
[1:54:38] correctly. Show respect. Give us air to
[1:54:41] breathe. Do not be stifling. Do not make
[1:54:44] it thick. Do not make traditions of
[1:54:47] church and religion and cood get in the
[1:54:50] way of believing. Amen.
[1:54:53] Prayer. Look at the things the church
[1:54:56] does. Prayer. Worship. Handle your
[1:54:59] worship correctly. Amen. Praise. Praise
[1:55:03] must be real. Handle your praise
[1:55:06] correctly. Togetherness. have lots of
[1:55:11] togetherness, right? Be united, help one
[1:55:14] another, lift one another. You know,
[1:55:16] it's like when you see someone uh having
[1:55:20] a bad time, something's wrong in the
[1:55:22] home. And what happens is when when a
[1:55:25] person is overwhelmed with
[1:55:27] stress, the atmosphere of believing is
[1:55:30] diminishing, right? It's your duty as
[1:55:34] the body of Christ to relieve that. so
[1:55:38] that you can bring them back to
[1:55:39] believing so they can deal with the
[1:55:41] stress. You don't want to take the
[1:55:42] stress away because the stress is there
[1:55:44] for a purpose. You just have to slightly
[1:55:47] lighten the load so that they can
[1:55:49] believe more, receive more faith and
[1:55:52] deal with the stress,
[1:55:54] right? So you know what stress is,
[1:55:57] right? So imagine a concrete block here
[1:56:00] about that about a meter high and a
[1:56:02] concrete block there about a meter high
[1:56:03] and you got a wooden plank across there,
[1:56:06] right? And now I I come in with a 50 kg
[1:56:08] bag of
[1:56:09] cement, put it on the plank. The plank
[1:56:12] has fibers in it, atoms that are
[1:56:15] molecules that are bonded. And the 50
[1:56:17] kg, this plank is really strong. It's 50
[1:56:20] kgs. It's so proud it can hold it.
[1:56:23] That's good. And then the the the
[1:56:26] molecules start to adjust, right?
[1:56:28] Because gravity is pushing down on this
[1:56:30] thing. And it's great. Then tomorrow I
[1:56:32] come back, I take off the bag, put it
[1:56:35] down and the plank is okay back to
[1:56:38] normal. You applied stress
[1:56:42] that stress force applied is stress for
[1:56:45] a day. What happens when you leave that
[1:56:47] stress for 3
[1:56:49] months then the molecules in the in the
[1:56:53] wood says we need to adjust. So it
[1:56:55] starts
[1:56:56] bending. Right? Imagine your fragile
[1:57:00] human spirit that has stress that is not
[1:57:03] being relieved.
[1:57:07] Stress is good because it strengthens
[1:57:08] the bond of the molecules. But if stress
[1:57:10] stays there too long, it's going to bend
[1:57:12] and eventually when you take it the bag
[1:57:15] off after 3 months, it retains its
[1:57:18] shape. Which means the stress has been
[1:57:20] applied too long and it's bent you.
[1:57:23] The thinking of people is let's flip it
[1:57:26] around
[1:57:27] and put the bag on top and then
[1:57:32] the molecules have bonded like that and
[1:57:34] you try to think that this is the the
[1:57:38] solution and you'll break
[1:57:40] it. This is why stress is is necessary
[1:57:44] because it strengthens the bond but when
[1:57:46] it's left too long it bends and it stays
[1:57:51] damaged for a very long time.
[1:57:53] So as a church, you can't leave your
[1:57:56] brother under stress for ages and ages
[1:57:59] and ages. You need to relieve some of
[1:58:02] the load. You need to come up and and
[1:58:05] help him out. If it's in whatever way
[1:58:08] possible, it is our job as the church to
[1:58:11] be able to create the atmosphere of
[1:58:14] believing. Amen. There are so many ways.
[1:58:17] So prayer, worship,
[1:58:19] togetherness, managing
[1:58:22] brotherhood, restoring the brotherhood.
[1:58:25] What did brother Ram say that when
[1:58:27] you're a church and you're receiving the
[1:58:28] word, what is Satan going to do? Break
[1:58:31] up the brotherhood. Your job is to
[1:58:33] maintain the brotherhood. Right? M I
[1:58:37] love that because in the Bible it tells
[1:58:39] you to keep the unity. It doesn't say
[1:58:42] have unity. It doesn't say create unity.
[1:58:46] It says, "Keep the unity."
[1:58:49] Here's another analogy about unity
[1:58:51] before we close. Unity is beautiful,
[1:58:54] right? How many bakers do we have here?
[1:58:59] Everyone said,
[1:59:01] "Yulen, no other bakers." I'm sure
[1:59:05] in some way. All right. Did you ever
[1:59:08] think about the
[1:59:09] mystery of adding egg, milk, butter,
[1:59:16] sugar,
[1:59:18] flour, completely
[1:59:21] different things from completely
[1:59:25] different sauces and some vanilla
[1:59:30] essence. And then you take these things
[1:59:32] and you mix them all up and it looks
[1:59:34] like this ugly
[1:59:36] goop. And then they all different
[1:59:39] things, right? And it it looks like
[1:59:43] play-doh almost. And then you take this
[1:59:46] thing, you put it in a nice pan and you
[1:59:47] put it in the oven and you look at that
[1:59:50] stuff, it looks icky. It looks stinky.
[1:59:53] The egg, you know, it's like and it
[1:59:56] looks lumpy. Can look like a horrible
[1:59:58] skin disease
[2:00:00] sometime, right? put it
[2:00:03] inside and then the smell starts
[2:00:07] emanating through the house. People walk
[2:00:09] in, the kids are, "Is it ready?" Husband
[2:00:12] wants a slice. He comes from work, the
[2:00:14] smell is emanating through the house,
[2:00:17] right? And then the cake comes out of
[2:00:19] the oven and it's there. When the cake
[2:00:21] is there, do you ever see the eggs start
[2:00:23] to
[2:00:24] separate or the milk leak out or the
[2:00:28] sugar drop out or the vanilla essence
[2:00:31] evaporate? How is it keeping its
[2:00:35] unity? Unity means it's one. It's no
[2:00:38] longer egg and they it's all called
[2:00:40] cake.
[2:00:42] It has a oneness.
[2:00:45] It has a togetherness and it doesn't
[2:00:46] separate. Amen. That's the kind of
[2:00:49] togetherness we ought to have as the
[2:00:51] body of Christ. We can't do without each
[2:00:54] other. I can't do without you. We
[2:00:56] shouldn't be this people that isolate
[2:00:58] and like from that from that place if
[2:01:01] the egg had to separate the entire cake
[2:01:03] flops
[2:01:05] and then it's disgusting,
[2:01:08] right? I mean, nobody likes to eat raw
[2:01:10] egg, right? Well, I don't. But it's it's
[2:01:15] got to be in this mysterious mixture for
[2:01:18] it to be this this amazing taste, this
[2:01:21] amazing cake. Birthday cake is
[2:01:23] fantastic. Nobody doesn't love birthday
[2:01:25] cake, right? Imagine a church where the
[2:01:29] unity is
[2:01:31] kept. It's tasteful. It's lovely. People
[2:01:35] enjoy. People like me come from South
[2:01:37] Africa and see, "Wow, these people are
[2:01:39] amazing." But if you if you're isolate,
[2:01:42] if you're sitting off, you're depressed,
[2:01:44] you're against one another, you feel
[2:01:46] like, yeah, you know, this church, they
[2:01:48] have a problem and you know, some people
[2:01:51] are problematic and no, if you're
[2:01:54] complaining, you're problematic.
[2:01:58] Keep the togetherness because it's
[2:02:00] creating an atmosphere of believing.
[2:02:03] Praise be to God. Encourage salvation.
[2:02:06] Encourage forgiveness. encourage
[2:02:10] confession, be
[2:02:12] supportive. Amen. Why? Why is that
[2:02:15] important? We have an open book that
[2:02:17] needs to be received. And amazingly, you
[2:02:21] don't realize how important that is for
[2:02:26] revelation, which is light.
[2:02:29] Amen. It's so taken for granted that the
[2:02:33] air is important for revelation that it
[2:02:36] will affect revelation. The one thing we
[2:02:39] know Christ told us your traditions made
[2:02:43] the word of none effect.
[2:02:46] For the word of God, you took and
[2:02:48] preached traditions. Traditions of man
[2:02:51] makes the word of none effect. Amen.
[2:02:54] Musicians, you can come up. This is the
[2:02:58] rain and the air. And this is four
[2:03:02] things that we saw how they work
[2:03:04] together for the good for them that are
[2:03:07] called. Amen. Do not take the gathering
[2:03:11] of the saints for granted.
[2:03:13] Do not think any one of you is
[2:03:15] irrelevant.
[2:03:18] Every one of you with whatever you come
[2:03:20] with, with your baggage, with your
[2:03:22] experience, with everything, you are
[2:03:25] relevant to the air. You are going to be
[2:03:28] conducive to revelation. You are going
[2:03:30] to make revelation applicable. You are
[2:03:33] going to help the absorption of light to
[2:03:36] create the right food for growth. We are
[2:03:38] never going in the rapture individually.
[2:03:42] We are going together. Nobody's winning
[2:03:45] the race over somebody else. We need the
[2:03:48] atmosphere of believing. There's no
[2:03:51] brother so and so from America who's
[2:03:53] going to get the open book epiphany
[2:03:54] before anybody else. or get there before
[2:03:58] any. No, we're are going together. Do
[2:04:01] not think you are irrelevant. Every one
[2:04:04] of you, every child, even the problems
[2:04:06] you give us as a child is
[2:04:09] relevant. It's
[2:04:11] valuable. Your questions are valuable. E
[2:04:15] every addition that you have that you
[2:04:17] bring to the church is valuable. You are
[2:04:20] the air that we breathe together. You
[2:04:23] are the atmosphere that is created
[2:04:25] and you are the cherished possession of
[2:04:29] God and we love you with all our heart
[2:04:32] and we want to do everything we can to
[2:04:34] serve you as best that we can. Amen. Let
[2:04:37] us bow our heads. Amen. Let us pray.
[2:04:40] Heavenly Father, we love you with all
[2:04:43] our heart. Oh God, you are truly
[2:04:45] wonderful. We are thankful for the body
[2:04:48] of Christ. this mysterious beautiful
[2:04:52] body of Christ. Lord, it's been
[2:04:54] generations since the first church age.
[2:04:58] It's been the word is dripping with
[2:05:01] blood. It has been passed down to us
[2:05:03] through those generations. They traveled
[2:05:06] across lands. They traveled across
[2:05:09] oceans. They suffered death and illness
[2:05:12] and
[2:05:13] imprisonment. They faced judges. They
[2:05:16] faced the circus of Rome. They faced
[2:05:19] governments of oppressive regimes. They
[2:05:22] faced so many difficulties. But we are
[2:05:25] here together because of the beautiful
[2:05:27] church of God. That for generations gave
[2:05:30] us the air to breathe. We are here
[2:05:33] because of the word that came in the
[2:05:35] days of the prophet of the hour that
[2:05:38] brought the air to breathe in the
[2:05:40] church, regulated the gifts, brought us
[2:05:42] the wisdom of first Corinthians 14,
[2:05:45] taught us how to temper everything. And
[2:05:48] with that, the light came. The light
[2:05:51] shone and pulled us out of darkness.
[2:05:54] Lord, we appreciate everything that
[2:05:55] you've done. We appreciate the five-fold
[2:05:57] ministry around the world in this little
[2:06:00] church that preaches the word that
[2:06:03] brings the rain when it's necessary that
[2:06:06] brings this the sewing rain to the new
[2:06:08] that that brings the teaching rain the
[2:06:10] former and latter rain to bring those to
[2:06:13] their adoptive positions where they can
[2:06:15] be of great help to others around them.
[2:06:18] Truly Lord, the way these things work is
[2:06:21] more than wonderful, more than
[2:06:23] marvelous, more than we could ever
[2:06:25] imagine. I pray for every office holder,
[2:06:27] every preacher, every ministry in this
[2:06:29] church. Oh God, every individual. May
[2:06:32] they know how much you hold them in
[2:06:34] value, how much they mean to us, how
[2:06:37] much they mean to every child. May the
[2:06:39] enemy never come in and devalue them in
[2:06:42] any way because they create the air that
[2:06:45] we breathe. They are conducive to your
[2:06:48] eternal gene seed that lays within every
[2:06:51] soul. Blessed be your holy name. We
[2:06:53] praise you, oh God, and give you all the
[2:06:56] praise and the glory and the honor for
[2:06:58] you are worthy of all praise. For you
[2:07:00] have taken the book and loosed the seals
[2:07:02] and brought great redemption to us. We
[2:07:05] are so thankful. Bless your holy name,
[2:07:08] Lord. We ask all of these things in your
[2:07:10] precious name, the name of the Lord
[2:07:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[2:07:15] brother. The song leader, come on up,
[2:07:18] brother. You love him, saints. Amen.
[2:07:22] Worship him in spirit and in truth.
[2:07:25] Amen.
[2:07:28] Bless you,
[2:07:35] [Music]
[2:07:37] brother. There is none like you.
[2:07:46] No one else can touch my heart like you
[2:07:53] do. Oh, I could search for all
[2:07:58] eternity,
[2:08:00] Lord, and
[2:08:02] find there is none like you.
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:11] There is none like
[2:08:18] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[2:08:23] you do.
[2:08:27] Oh, I could search for all
[2:08:31] eternity,
[2:08:32] Lord, and
[2:08:35] find there is none like
[2:08:40] [Music]
[2:08:43] you. There is none like you.
[2:08:52] No one else can touch my heart like you
