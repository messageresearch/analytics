[56:12] amen but yes very welcome
[56:16] to allow visitors it's kind of a bit of
[56:18] a trial run for next weekend in a way
[56:20] because um we'll if you look around it's
[56:24] pretty full and we estimate
[56:26] possibly up to another 50 next weekend
[56:29] so i'll ask in advance that we
[56:33] next weekend we'll have to do at least
[56:35] four per pew and we'll need to squash up
[56:37] and be
[56:38] nice and nice and cozy with each other
[56:42] next weekend so
[56:43] but just really looking forward to that
[56:46] and just a few reminders so so
[56:49] next sunday we'll have that potluck
[56:51] after the morning service
[56:53] and as i say there's perhaps as many as
[56:57] 180 people
[56:58] going to be all up between the youth and
[57:01] and the people bringing them down and so
[57:03] forth
[57:04] so um please make sure to to bring
[57:06] enough is what i'm saying
[57:08] if you can't read between the lines um
[57:12] then just also a reminder that there's
[57:14] no sunday school next sunday morning
[57:16] so the young ones can just come straight
[57:18] here
[57:21] are there any questions anything that
[57:23] anyone is unsure about
[57:24] regarding next weekend i trust that all
[57:28] the arrangements
[57:29] have been done okay praise the lord
[57:35] then there's a couple of prayer requests
[57:37] i would
[57:38] appreciate prayer for my eye i've been
[57:40] just struggling with my with my left eye
[57:42] this whole week and
[57:43] it kind of comes and goes and just one
[57:46] moment it's fine and the next moment it
[57:48] just
[57:48] scratches so much i possibly got
[57:51] something in the
[57:52] eye while doing some work on mondays so

[1:08:37] it's very nice to be ministering in a
[1:08:39] church that's not your home church
[1:08:41] you know because you you don't know
[1:08:42] what's going on and
[1:08:44] and you don't know all of the things
[1:08:45] that's happening and so you can just
[1:08:47] preach exactly what the lord lays on
[1:08:49] your heart there's no
[1:08:51] human memories or anything involved it's
[1:08:54] just a
[1:08:55] straight course of fellowship with god
[1:08:58] amen
[1:08:59] hallelujah i want to speak this morning
[1:09:01] on a subject called
[1:09:03] state of emergency amen
[1:09:07] hallelujah that sounds a bit alarming
[1:09:09] you know i've walked in here i seen all
[1:09:10] these fire trucks there i was like oh

[1:09:26] but of the times and the seasons
[1:09:28] brethren you have no need that i write
[1:09:30] unto you
[1:09:32] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:09:35] day of the lord so cometh
[1:09:37] as a thief in the night for when they
[1:09:40] shall say
[1:09:41] peace and safety then sudden destruction
[1:09:44] comes upon them
[1:09:46] as travail upon a woman with child and
[1:09:49] they
[1:09:50] shall not escape it's a serious time

[1:10:00] i'm really
[1:10:01] i'm so glad that the lord brought this
[1:10:02] part to our attention and he didn't just
[1:10:05] leave it there
[1:10:06] hallelujah but you brethren are not in
[1:10:09] darkness
[1:10:10] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:10:12] thief amen

[1:10:16] speak to us out of your word lord the
[1:10:18] burden of your heart be revealed to us
[1:10:20] and that we could connect with it we
[1:10:21] could receive it i asked lord for
[1:10:24] you'd come and visit us you could send a
[1:10:26] ministering spirits and angels father to
[1:10:28] help us connect with the word and

[1:10:38] knowledge and and be able to connect
[1:10:40] with
[1:10:40] the very thought of god the heartbeat of
[1:10:42] god and lord you even come as an angel
[1:10:44] yourself and
[1:10:45] lord to give clarity to give vision and
[1:10:48] i pray today that you would send

[1:10:56] lord between us and god

[1:11:03] lord and just ask that you would use me
[1:11:05] in jesus christ's name
[1:11:07] amen amen you may be seated hallelujah
[1:11:11] the prophet says this in the great
[1:11:12] coming revival and the outpouring of the
[1:11:14] holy spirit
[1:11:16] he says god moving ahead in this nation
[1:11:19] just as sure as anything signs and
[1:11:22] wonders that begin to appear
[1:11:23] that we see we're at the end time we're
[1:11:27] right now
[1:11:27] merging into the greatest revival that
[1:11:30] this world has ever seen
[1:11:33] we're right now emerging
[1:11:37] into the greatest destruction that's
[1:11:39] ever hit
[1:11:40] all mankind since there ever was a world
[1:11:44] he preached this in 54 you know before
[1:11:46] the huge revival the
[1:11:48] when the sun of righteousness arose with
[1:11:49] healing and his wings to
[1:11:51] to go forth into all the around the
[1:11:53] earth you know through the ministry of
[1:11:55] malachi 4 and begin to heal and restore
[1:11:58] and
[1:11:58] begin to raise a people up who had been
[1:12:01] trodden down by the devil
[1:12:03] who had been stuck under dark
[1:12:05] denominationalism who'd been stuck under
[1:12:07] the ideas of man
[1:12:09] for all these years god began to raise
[1:12:12] the people up
[1:12:13] and feed them from the masters table
[1:12:17] so that they could dance and rejoice
[1:12:21] and begin to dance like the young calves
[1:12:23] that come out of the stall it says
[1:12:25] young oxen full of food little calves
[1:12:28] just so happy that they're just elated
[1:12:30] they're light they just float around
[1:12:31] they're just so happy right
[1:12:33] i'm not a farmer but there must be
[1:12:34] farmers in here that can know what i
[1:12:36] mean they just get so happy
[1:12:38] and it says that they will tread on the
[1:12:39] head of their wicked with the wicked
[1:12:41] enemy
[1:12:42] and and this is exactly what happened
[1:12:45] in this day to raise a people up amen
[1:12:49] why to cause a revival to come forth to
[1:12:52] heal a people to prepare a people so
[1:12:53] that they can come up
[1:12:54] and be above all of the things of the
[1:12:57] enemy
[1:12:58] this is our position saints we're not to
[1:13:00] be pushed around by the devil
[1:13:02] we're not to be pushed around by some
[1:13:04] enemy or some
[1:13:06] idea of man or some force that is not of
[1:13:09] god
[1:13:09] but we are here and god has put grace
[1:13:12] upon the earth
[1:13:13] he's crying grace to you saying come up
[1:13:16] i'm giving you
[1:13:17] power over your enemy i'm going to raise
[1:13:20] you up i'm going to show you who you are
[1:13:22] so that you can rejoice not just tread
[1:13:25] like some legal old
[1:13:26] thing but actually rejoice
[1:13:30] the joy of the lord is your strength
[1:13:33] hallelujah
[1:13:34] you know there's a saying that's been
[1:13:35] floating around with brahman and i
[1:13:38] and it was an interpretation of tongues
[1:13:40] in one of the prophets ministry
[1:13:42] uh services and he said and the lord
[1:13:44] said in this
[1:13:45] in this interpretation your victory lies
[1:13:48] between faith and rejoicing
[1:13:52] your victory lies between faith and
[1:13:55] rejoicing
[1:13:56] with joy you shall draw waters from the
[1:13:58] wells of salvation
[1:14:00] so if you don't have a joy this morning
[1:14:03] if the devils robbed you of your joy
[1:14:04] this morning
[1:14:06] claim it back take it back
[1:14:10] amen amen and zephaniah 1 verse 7 it
[1:14:14] says hold thy peace at the presence
[1:14:16] of the lord god for the day of the lord
[1:14:18] is at hand
[1:14:19] for the lord has prepared a sacrifice
[1:14:22] and he has bid as guests
[1:14:24] hi guests hello he has bid you
[1:14:28] he has bid his guests to a feast he has
[1:14:32] called a people
[1:14:32] to a supper he is calling us to a feast
[1:14:36] to sit at his table to feed to be
[1:14:39] raised up in our identity to know who we
[1:14:42] are to know where we stand
[1:14:44] so that we can stand amen in victory
[1:14:47] but remember your victory lies between
[1:14:49] faith and rejoicing
[1:14:52] zephaniah 1 12 and it says and it shall
[1:14:56] come to pass
[1:14:57] at that time that i will search
[1:14:59] jerusalem with candles
[1:15:01] and punish the men that are settled on
[1:15:03] their leaves
[1:15:04] and say in their heart the lord will not
[1:15:07] do good
[1:15:08] neither will he do evil
[1:15:13] this is reducing the character of god to
[1:15:15] a grandfather
[1:15:18] making god a dodie old grandfather that
[1:15:21] just doesn't care about cern or doesn't
[1:15:23] care about the situation
[1:15:25] but actually no god does care he cares a
[1:15:28] lot
[1:15:29] he's very he's he's for he he cares
[1:15:32] that can of the condition of his people
[1:15:34] he cares about the condition of your
[1:15:36] life he cares about the condition of the
[1:15:37] earth
[1:15:38] and he will act accordingly
[1:15:42] says here therefore their goods shall
[1:15:44] become a booty
[1:15:45] and their houses are desolation they
[1:15:48] shall also build houses
[1:15:50] but not inhabit them and they shall
[1:15:52] plant vineyards but not drink
[1:15:54] the wine thereof the day of the lord is
[1:15:57] near
[1:15:58] it is near and hasteth greatly
[1:16:01] even the voice of the day of the lord
[1:16:05] the mighty man shall cry there bitterly
[1:16:08] hallelujah
[1:16:10] the voice of the day of the lord we are
[1:16:12] in it
[1:16:13] the voice has gone forth amen
[1:16:16] the lord has come down in a mighty way
[1:16:19] in the fullness of his presence
[1:16:21] to come and reveal himself and the voice
[1:16:23] has gone forth into all the earth
[1:16:25] to raise up a standard against the
[1:16:27] floods of the enemy so that
[1:16:29] people can rise up and stand above
[1:16:32] all of it and today i want to declare to
[1:16:35] you
[1:16:36] that we are in a state of emergency
[1:16:41] that's a state of emergency saints today
[1:16:44] and if you can see through the veneer
[1:16:46] that what the devil is painting
[1:16:48] he's painting your lives right now as a
[1:16:50] very comfortable you're going through
[1:16:52] some mental trials you'll go through
[1:16:53] some things
[1:16:54] there'll be thoughts going on you're
[1:16:55] having battles you're fighting against
[1:16:57] things
[1:16:58] but on a natural level what the devil's
[1:17:00] aim is is to make you as comfortable as
[1:17:02] possible
[1:17:02] to make you as complacent as possible so
[1:17:05] that you don't even have a need for the
[1:17:06] tree of life
[1:17:07] he wants to meet your needs this morning
[1:17:09] he wants to i'm talking about the devil
[1:17:11] now
[1:17:12] he wants to meet your needs he wants to
[1:17:14] give you a physical happy life he wants
[1:17:16] to make you real comfortable
[1:17:18] you know that because if he makes you
[1:17:21] real comfortable and he
[1:17:22] fulfills your fleshly desires and gives
[1:17:25] you all that you need and
[1:17:26] maybe you just need a bit of comfort so
[1:17:28] you can turn on your phone and you can
[1:17:29] watch something on youtube and
[1:17:31] you get a bit of comfort from that where
[1:17:33] back in the
[1:17:34] before that happened you would you would
[1:17:36] have to find something else to get
[1:17:37] comfort
[1:17:38] amen and so you see he wants to meet
[1:17:40] these needs but you see
[1:17:42] god on the other hand he has got a
[1:17:44] greater plan for you
[1:17:45] amen he wants to meet your needs he is
[1:17:48] your comforter
[1:17:49] he is our comforter this morning he is
[1:17:51] our comforter
[1:17:52] it's this evening he is our comforter
[1:17:54] for all things and you see a human being
[1:17:57] the desire is for comfort we need
[1:18:00] comfort we need peace we need our needs
[1:18:04] met
[1:18:06] hallelujah but if you can see through
[1:18:07] the veneer
[1:18:09] by inspiration amen
[1:18:12] if you can see through all of this
[1:18:14] comfort right now
[1:18:16] to see that right now where we stand
[1:18:19] we stand in a very treacherous time we
[1:18:22] stand in a time where the devil is
[1:18:24] warring and raging against us
[1:18:26] to try and keep us on a natural level to
[1:18:28] try and keep our minds full
[1:18:30] i know it i'm a businessman i've got
[1:18:32] lots of things going on inside on a
[1:18:34] natural level
[1:18:35] and you see it takes a great effort to
[1:18:38] continue walking with god
[1:18:40] it actually takes an effort to break
[1:18:42] through that and
[1:18:43] in your mind so full of all of these
[1:18:45] things that need to be done and all of
[1:18:47] the
[1:18:47] responsibilities and and everything the
[1:18:50] bible says redeem the time
[1:18:52] for the days are evil and so it's if the
[1:18:54] bible says redeem the time for the days
[1:18:56] of evil
[1:18:57] then there is a provision for you to
[1:18:59] redeem the time
[1:19:09] by faith don't try and do it by
[1:19:12] some action of the flesh casting this
[1:19:16] off and changing all that and cutting
[1:19:17] off and all of those things because
[1:19:19] you see that doesn't always work it's
[1:19:21] just you trying to do it but by faith
[1:19:23] the lord can help you he can change your
[1:19:26] situation
[1:19:28] he can do something so if you believe by
[1:19:29] faith lord i'm too busy
[1:19:32] my mind is too full right now i can't
[1:19:34] even pray properly
[1:19:35] i'm getting so pressured i feel anxious
[1:19:37] i feel depressed or whatever it may be
[1:19:40] because of all the pressure all the time
[1:19:42] and my emotions are becoming
[1:19:43] disconnected
[1:19:45] help me lord help me lord lord arrange
[1:19:48] my life in some way change my job
[1:19:50] situation
[1:19:51] change my circumstances in some way so
[1:19:53] that i can worship you
[1:19:54] so that when i pray i can have
[1:19:56] fellowship when i read the bible you can
[1:19:59] speak to me
[1:19:59] and my mind is not full of everything
[1:20:01] else amen who can agree there
[1:20:04] hallelujah amen you see
[1:20:08] come back to the simplicity the
[1:20:10] simplicity
[1:20:11] of asking simple things sometimes we
[1:20:14] think we've got to ask a big elaborate
[1:20:15] thing
[1:20:16] and and pray a big great visionary
[1:20:19] prayer
[1:20:20] to get god's attention to meet some sort
[1:20:22] of need and sometimes your picture's too
[1:20:24] big
[1:20:25] and you've just got to zone right down
[1:20:27] and say lord
[1:20:29] help me with my job or help me with this
[1:20:32] business
[1:20:33] help me lord to overcome this help me
[1:20:36] lord
[1:20:36] to have faith help me lord
[1:20:40] right down to the very base of your
[1:20:43] experience help me lord
[1:20:44] to believe because we're getting fought
[1:20:47] on every level
[1:20:48] and i declare to you today a state of
[1:20:50] emergency
[1:20:52] you're in a state of emergency your
[1:20:55] flesh may be comfortable right now
[1:20:57] some of you might be going through some
[1:20:59] things and you have a harder life
[1:21:01] depends on how much you're doing for the
[1:21:02] lord if you're
[1:21:04] if you're a threat for the kingdom of
[1:21:06] the devil
[1:21:08] if you are conquering the devil's
[1:21:10] kingdom and taking your land
[1:21:11] well then you're going to be going
[1:21:12] through a hard time but if you're
[1:21:14] standing still and not doing much
[1:21:16] and you're just enjoying your life and
[1:21:18] having a comfortable ride going to work
[1:21:20] nine to five
[1:21:20] eating your dinner and having some
[1:21:22] fellowship and enjoying your
[1:21:23] christianity there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:25] enjoying christianity by the way
[1:21:26] i love christianity who loves
[1:21:27] christianity amen there's nothing wrong
[1:21:30] with that i'm not condemning that
[1:21:31] but i'm saying if you're not conquering
[1:21:33] your land if you're not helping others
[1:21:35] conquer their land
[1:21:36] then the devil's not going to even worry
[1:21:38] about you amen you're just going to have
[1:21:40] a few little trials here and there but
[1:21:41] one day
[1:21:42] when you get a vision when the lord
[1:21:44] starts to work in your life and you say
[1:21:46] lord
[1:21:46] i'm tired of just warming a pew i'm
[1:21:48] tired of just sitting down
[1:21:50] and living my life oh why is it lord
[1:21:52] that these others are going through this
[1:21:54] and they're developing and they're
[1:21:55] growing and
[1:21:56] things are happening why not me why not
[1:21:58] now
[1:21:59] amen why not me lord why is it lord
[1:22:02] and i believe that if you really pray
[1:22:04] that the lord will come and he will

[1:22:14] effective in your calling where you
[1:22:17] become effective
[1:22:18] in your ministry in your gifting
[1:22:22] because the moment that that gift gets
[1:22:23] operated by god
[1:22:25] the devil starts to turn his targets
[1:22:27] upon you and you may be fearing mad

[1:22:43] be with you
[1:22:44] you don't need to fear you know
[1:22:46] sometimes maybe you've stepped out
[1:22:47] before
[1:22:48] maybe you stepped out to do something
[1:22:50] for god and then your life got really
[1:22:52] hard
[1:22:52] and then it gave you a complex because
[1:22:54] you didn't want to do it anymore
[1:22:55] but it's time to rise up saints it's
[1:22:58] time
[1:22:58] because i declare to you a state of
[1:23:01] emergency

[1:25:09] testament prophets all that when god got
[1:25:11] a hold of them
[1:25:12] you know they want to just they want to

[1:26:02] this is a new zealand government site
[1:26:04] that says here and i just thought it was
[1:26:05] quite fitting you know because countries
[1:26:06] all have
[1:26:07] like a protocol that it's like a new
[1:26:10] enactment
[1:26:11] it's like a new law it's like something
[1:26:13] altogether new comes
[1:26:14] when a state of emergency is declared
[1:26:17] so did you catch that i've declared a
[1:26:20] state of emergency
[1:26:22] so just keep that in mind
[1:26:26] declaring a state of emergency is a
[1:26:27] critical part of new zealand's response
[1:26:29] arrangements
[1:26:31] it is the declaration of a state of
[1:26:33] emergency that provides
[1:26:34] controllers redeemed sons
[1:26:39] and others with extraordinary power
[1:26:44] like that oh my hallelujah
[1:26:48] take it own it it's yours you can have
[1:26:51] that
[1:26:52] remember that you can have that
[1:26:56] hallelujah you just say lord can you
[1:26:57] just say this it's for me
[1:27:00] that's for me hallelujah you just lay
[1:27:04] your stake in the ground you say that's
[1:27:05] for me
[1:27:07] extraordinary powers amen you've had
[1:27:09] ordinary powers
[1:27:10] he sent you forth to preach the gospel
[1:27:13] he sent you forth to cleanse the lepers
[1:27:15] raise the dead and heal the sick but
[1:27:16] there's going to come a time
[1:27:18] when an emergency is declared where
[1:27:20] extraordinary powers
[1:27:22] begin to come out of your life amen
[1:27:25] hallelujah in the time of an emergency
[1:27:28] you know the word emergency i like that
[1:27:31] word
[1:27:32] because it doesn't just mean like oh no
[1:27:33] there's bad things happening something
[1:27:35] has to emerge hallelujah
[1:27:38] amen it's a to to me in this time was a
[1:27:41] twofold meaning
[1:27:42] there is a calamity upon the earth but
[1:27:44] through that calamity emerges
[1:27:46] as a manifested son a manifested
[1:27:49] daughter
[1:27:50] someone that can rejoice over their
[1:27:51] enemy someone that has victory this
[1:27:54] morning
[1:27:54] someone that can say to all their
[1:27:56] illnesses and all their troubles and all
[1:27:58] their woes
[1:27:59] no longer no more devil
[1:28:02] no more amen
[1:28:05] someone that can love their lord jesus
[1:28:07] like you he deserves
[1:28:10] you know the devil he just gets into
[1:28:11] your mind he just wants you to have
[1:28:14] a mild relationship with jesus
[1:28:17] but you see the lord he's longing for a
[1:28:20] bride just to
[1:28:21] really love him magnify the lord with me
[1:28:25] come insult his name together oh my
[1:28:29] and really when you sing that and
[1:28:32] and you s you hear the name of jesus
[1:28:35] christ

[1:28:50] waters from the wells of salvation
[1:28:52] anyone that does photography here will
[1:28:54] know what i'm talking about
[1:28:56] and i'll just give you a little
[1:28:57] explanation for you
[1:28:59] that don't know what i'm talking about
[1:29:03] aperture and a camera is
[1:29:06] how much light it lets in it's like a
[1:29:09] little function
[1:29:10] that you turn on or you can you can turn
[1:29:12] up and down and it opens up
[1:29:15] how much light gets let in do you know
[1:29:18] that the human heart
[1:29:20] has an aperture and it's how much light
[1:29:24] are you living in
[1:29:26] how open who are you
[1:29:30] to the word of god now
[1:29:33] i could preach to you the deepest
[1:29:35] mysteries and take it all together and
[1:29:36] make you so like
[1:29:38] wow right and you'll go well everyone
[1:29:40] goes well when a minister preaches those
[1:29:42] things it's amazing right
[1:29:43] but can you do the same thing with
[1:29:47] a simple cross is your aperture open
[1:29:51] enough
[1:29:52] or do you need to be preached into it or
[1:29:55] can you sit down in a service
[1:29:57] and i'm really challenging you and
[1:29:58] myself that you can sit down
[1:30:01] in a pew and the morning things are
[1:30:04] going
[1:30:05] before the singing and you sit there and
[1:30:08] get into a condition of meditation and
[1:30:10] thankfulness
[1:30:11] so much that you begin to weep and you
[1:30:14] begin to
[1:30:15] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[1:30:18] glory
[1:30:19] just at the thought oh my that you're
[1:30:21] here
[1:30:23] and you're in a church that's about to
[1:30:24] preach a seventh seal
[1:30:26] message a message that comes from the
[1:30:29] son of man
[1:30:30] abraham you know if you can get to that
[1:30:34] place you're going to have a wonderful
[1:30:35] time and the joy
[1:30:37] because you see if you go walk into pack
[1:30:41] and save or wherever
[1:30:42] new world over there and they're playing
[1:30:44] some party music
[1:30:46] and you you don't enjoy that music you
[1:30:48] think it's awful
[1:30:49] and if you do enjoy it then we can pray
[1:30:51] afterwards
[1:30:52] [Laughter]
[1:30:56] but if you don't enjoy that if which you
[1:30:59] should not enjoy it
[1:31:02] then it won't go into you
[1:31:05] you're not absorbing it you're not like
[1:31:06] oh i like this you know and start
[1:31:08] dancing with the music and
[1:31:09] moving to it and humming it you know the
[1:31:12] people that do that
[1:31:14] with whatever medium it may be it may be
[1:31:15] a movie it may be a tik tok video it may
[1:31:17] be a youtube thing it may be just some
[1:31:19] comedian it may be a tv show
[1:31:21] maybe a music song it may be just
[1:31:22] someone talking to you
[1:31:24] and saying the wrong joke and you begin
[1:31:27] to enjoy that and laugh and have a good
[1:31:29] time
[1:31:30] what happens is the aperture of your
[1:31:32] heart
[1:31:33] opens up and with joy you shall draw
[1:31:37] waters from the wells of damnation
[1:31:42] because there's two there's two places
[1:31:46] there's there's two sources revelation 9
[1:31:50] out of darkness and out of the pit shall
[1:31:52] come smoke and
[1:31:53] block out the sun and stop you being
[1:31:55] able to worship and
[1:31:57] breaking down your relationship with god
[1:31:59] and with people and then there's
[1:32:01] revelation 10 who's come down from
[1:32:04] heaven
[1:32:04] with an open book and here's an
[1:32:06] influence
[1:32:07] upon you and now to what source
[1:32:11] you open your aperture to
[1:32:14] as to what will impact you so much
[1:32:17] that you shall draw waters from the
[1:32:19] wells of one of those sources
[1:32:22] if you sit in service and it's like you
[1:32:26] just blocked up
[1:32:28] and that joy is not there right now
[1:32:32] i just encourage you right now whatever
[1:32:34] you're going through
[1:32:35] the cross is more more sufficient he
[1:32:38] finished the work
[1:32:41] thankfulness it says i will enter his
[1:32:43] gates
[1:32:44] with thanksgiving in my heart i will
[1:32:46] enter his courts with praise
[1:32:48] and i encourage you this morning right
[1:32:50] now if the joy
[1:32:52] channel is not open if the aperture's
[1:32:53] only a little bit open
[1:32:55] i encourage you to just think about what
[1:32:57] he's done for you
[1:33:00] because this is a very important thing
[1:33:03] in this hour
[1:33:04] where we're being stimulated by both
[1:33:06] revelation 9 and revelation
[1:33:08] 10 pouring in it's pouring in
[1:33:11] well you know you it's like you know you
[1:33:13] stop something right and it all just
[1:33:14] starts pouring around whatever you're
[1:33:15] using to stop it
[1:33:16] or it's bulging that's what that's what
[1:33:19] revelation 9 is trying to do does
[1:33:20] everyone know what i mean by revelation
[1:33:22] 9.
[1:33:23] you're all aware of revelation 9 right
[1:33:25] where
[1:33:26] the dark the the death angel was given a
[1:33:29] key to the bottomless pit and he fell
[1:33:31] from heaven he didn't come down he fell
[1:33:33] he got kicked out
[1:33:34] from heaven and he opened the key to
[1:33:37] hell and hell got spewed out on the
[1:33:39] earth in the last century
[1:33:41] around the same time that our lovely
[1:33:44] lord jesus
[1:33:45] came down amen and revealed himself
[1:33:48] in his full peruse your presence amen
[1:33:52] to to manifest father's glory to come

[1:34:22] you get in the spirit
[1:34:24] and he begins to pray he begins to speak
[1:34:27] he begins to intercede
[1:34:30] your life begins to change

[1:39:23] that gets ignored almost but there's a
[1:39:26] great spiritual meaning
[1:39:28] to why that ark stayed in shiloh for so
[1:39:31] long
[1:39:32] and shiloh means silence
[1:39:37] tranquil the ark the seventh seal
[1:39:41] the full manifestation of power and
[1:39:43] sonship
[1:39:44] oh man i feel good
[1:39:48] that stayed in silence for all that time
[1:39:52] and even eventuated into the enemy's
[1:39:54] camp
[1:39:55] and then stayed in limbo it's just like
[1:39:57] what's the message believers doing with
[1:39:59] the seventh seal
[1:40:01] what's going on israelite message
[1:40:03] believers
[1:40:06] what's happening hallelujah
[1:40:10] the prophet says this in desperation he
[1:40:13] says usually it takes a state of
[1:40:14] emergency
[1:40:16] to throw us into desperation see
[1:40:19] it's too bad it has to do that but human
[1:40:22] beings are so slothful in their mind
[1:40:24] i'm putting my hand up i'm not going to
[1:40:28] pitch forkless i'm going to say lord yes
[1:40:30] help me
[1:40:31] i'm a human being is everyone a human
[1:40:34] being here
[1:40:35] hallelujah that it takes an emergency
[1:40:39] sometimes something arises and when they
[1:40:42] do
[1:40:43] then it throws them into that
[1:40:45] desperation
[1:40:46] and he says and really in doing that
[1:40:50] in desperation it brings out the real
[1:40:52] thing that you are
[1:40:54] i like that i like that it shows what
[1:40:57] you're made out of
[1:40:59] in the time of desperation
[1:41:02] it usually pulls out oh man this makes
[1:41:04] me just rejoice
[1:41:06] it usually pulls out all the good things
[1:41:08] that's in you
[1:41:09] hallelujah amen oh my
[1:41:12] amen you know there's good things in you
[1:41:16] hallelujah real good things you may not
[1:41:19] think that and maybe someone that's
[1:41:21] looking with the wrong eyes may not
[1:41:22] think that
[1:41:23] but there is good things in you and
[1:41:25] there is a time coming that's going to
[1:41:26] push
[1:41:27] and it's going to throw these things and
[1:41:29] throw you into desperation
[1:41:30] but i just want to tell you there is a
[1:41:32] way to be in that condition before
[1:41:35] a physical war or before a calamity
[1:41:37] extracts or before
[1:41:38] trouble hits your family you can be in a
[1:41:41] condition
[1:41:42] where god listens where you're connected
[1:41:45] where you actually really truly deeply
[1:41:48] care
[1:41:49] about what's happening around you where
[1:41:51] you can see through
[1:41:53] the veneer of the pale horse rider
[1:41:55] that's riding all over the earth and as
[1:41:57] the saving people and deceiving message
[1:41:59] believers
[1:42:00] and deceiving all the world showing them
[1:42:03] comfort and all a piece that's false
[1:42:10] a calm that's not really calm
[1:42:13] we think it's so protected here but
[1:42:15] there's things brewing
[1:42:17] and i just want to encourage you this
[1:42:19] morning
[1:42:20] there is a way to enter into a place
[1:42:24] a climate in your own life
[1:42:27] right now and i pray that by the end of
[1:42:30] the service
[1:42:31] you will have entered if you haven't
[1:42:33] already
[1:42:35] into this condition
[1:42:38] says here in desperations he says see
[1:42:43] you must come and when you're desperate
[1:42:45] then god is going to listen to you
[1:42:48] but if you're just slothful you don't
[1:42:50] care whether he does or not
[1:42:52] i once again i put my hand up you know
[1:42:54] many prayers i've prayed over my life
[1:42:56] where you just pray it and you get into
[1:42:57] a mode and it's like
[1:42:59] there's that desperation's not there
[1:43:01] it's like you know
[1:43:02] we get the devil fights us he doesn't
[1:43:05] let down
[1:43:07] he's not going to let you pray without
[1:43:09] something trying to resist
[1:43:11] whether it's around you or in you your
[1:43:13] flesh is your enemy right
[1:43:15] he knows what to leverage he knows how
[1:43:18] to get you frustrated
[1:43:20] you know you might be having you're
[1:43:21] going to have a conference with god
[1:43:23] you know we get into that place where i
[1:43:25] just i've got to speak to god
[1:43:26] and leading up to that it just gets real
[1:43:28] hard and maybe the family gets a bit
[1:43:31] upset or
[1:43:31] you just get busy or the business goes
[1:43:34] real bad and it's like
[1:43:36] everything trying to stop you in your
[1:43:38] spirit realm
[1:43:40] to to to to to to confuse everything and
[1:43:42] make you all
[1:43:43] uptight so that when you you you don't
[1:43:45] even feel like praying
[1:43:47] you have to fight that you have to fight
[1:43:50] that
[1:43:51] you have to fight amen
[1:43:54] and i want to encourage you fight
[1:43:57] back or fight first
[1:44:01] choose which way you want to work this
[1:44:03] because right now
[1:44:05] in the seemingly calm environment here
[1:44:08] in new zealand
[1:44:09] and many other countries right now it
[1:44:12] looks like it's okay right
[1:44:14] things are about to change drastically
[1:44:17] drastically i don't know how i know
[1:44:20] exactly when but it's going to happen
[1:44:22] if the prophet was saying it's emerging
[1:44:24] now then it's emerging
[1:44:26] it's been emerging for 50 years that was
[1:44:27] 54 he said that
[1:44:29] he said that in 54 an emerging of the
[1:44:31] greatest destruction
[1:44:32] that has ever struck mankind and he's
[1:44:36] been

[1:44:38] destroying politics he's been destroying
[1:44:39] all these structures
[1:44:41] of society destroying fatherhood
[1:44:42] destroying motherhood destroying
[1:44:44] friendship
[1:44:45] destroying relationship destroying
[1:44:46] marriages destroying it all
[1:44:48] but there is a one that's come
[1:44:50] hallelujah and there's a people in this
[1:44:52] room that have come under great grace
[1:44:54] hallelujah a double portion of grace

[1:45:07] not have to stand
[1:45:08] to be under the devil's vices you do not
[1:45:10] have to stand to have a broken marriage
[1:45:12] you do not have to stand to be sick you
[1:45:14] do not have to stand
[1:45:16] to be under a government of corruption
[1:45:18] hallelujah
[1:45:19] because your great king amen is the king
[1:45:22] of your life
[1:45:23] the greatest government is a righteous
[1:45:24] king who has a righteous king governing
[1:45:26] their life
[1:45:27] hallelujah you can rejoice you can

[1:45:39] the governments of the earth raise you
[1:45:41] up above the corruption
[1:45:43] raise you up above the lies of the devil
[1:45:46] who would lie to you with your own
[1:45:48] thoughts
[1:45:50] to make you think you're thinking him
[1:45:52] he's very good at that
[1:45:55] but you just you even cast those
[1:45:57] thoughts down
[1:45:59] get active in your warfare get yourself
[1:46:02] cleaned out
[1:46:02] amen you know israel
[1:46:06] they came to a point
[1:46:10] after they had left the wilderness under
[1:46:13] moses uh joshua's ministry
[1:46:17] the lord said to joshua turn you
[1:46:19] northward
[1:46:21] and i'll take my people into the
[1:46:23] promised land
[1:46:26] take my people out of denominationalism
[1:46:30] take my people further than
[1:46:32] pentecostalism
[1:46:35] don't diminish those things because
[1:46:36] there's good in them
[1:46:38] to come but you need to go further
[1:46:41] you need to progress joshua take my
[1:46:43] people
[1:46:44] into the land hallelujah
[1:46:48] so he takes his people into the land and
[1:46:51] they're under this mighty messenger
[1:46:53] who's got a he's got a seventh seal
[1:46:55] revelation
[1:46:57] of a mighty angel that descended with a
[1:47:00] book in his hand and sword the sword of
[1:47:01] the spirit is the word
[1:47:03] with the book in his hand and then and
[1:47:06] under that ministry
[1:47:08] there was a great massive miracle
[1:47:11] that that that took a bride
[1:47:15] who was in prostitution and stuck under
[1:47:17] the rule of babylon
[1:47:20] and and doing all sorts of things she
[1:47:21] didn't want to do
[1:47:23] and it heard of this great one that was
[1:47:26] delivering and her faith activated
[1:47:29] and got her freed and this great
[1:47:32] messenger that came down
[1:47:34] from heaven the captain of the lord's
[1:47:35] host would reveal a message
[1:47:38] and unfold the very essence
[1:47:42] to set that bribe free and the bride was
[1:47:44] set free and she came into union with
[1:47:45] the captain
[1:47:46] she came into perfect union with the
[1:47:48] captain
[1:47:49] and brought about a lineage
[1:47:52] amen a lineage that would lead
[1:47:56] to a millennium a lineage that would
[1:47:59] open up a golden age for israel
[1:48:01] a linear german that would take
[1:48:04] everything that joshua's message said
[1:48:06] that they could have
[1:48:08] and enact it you know joshua's message
[1:48:11] was a declaration of independence
[1:48:13] hallelujah you know america the left
[1:48:17] false religion and they declared their
[1:48:18] independence and then there was a war
[1:48:22] because there has to be a war and if you
[1:48:24] want independence from the devil's
[1:48:26] kingdom this morning
[1:48:28] don't think that you're going to get
[1:48:29] that without a fight he ain't going to
[1:48:30] give nothing up without a fight
[1:48:32] but remember greater is he that is
[1:48:34] within you than he that is in the world
[1:48:36] so you can stand this morning and you
[1:48:38] can climb back myself
[1:48:40] hallelujah and so here we have
[1:48:44] this great lineage bringing coming up
[1:48:46] and here
[1:48:47] these people that had believed joshua's
[1:48:50] message
[1:48:51] they come and it's all enthusiasm it's
[1:48:54] all just going well and
[1:48:55] they're conquering the land they had a
[1:48:57] few hiccups but joshua was there
[1:49:00] and they were leaning on joshua they
[1:49:02] were leaning on the prophet
[1:49:04] they were looking to him and he would
[1:49:06] cry out to god when it went wrong and ai
[1:49:08] and
[1:49:08] and there and and god would show them
[1:49:10] what was wrong and
[1:49:11] they would conquer afterwards and they
[1:49:13] would continue on and
[1:49:14] then joshua passed off the scene but the
[1:49:17] angel didn't leave
[1:49:19] a man who knows the angel stayed because
[1:49:22] you see there was a land to conquer
[1:49:24] there was an inheritance that had been
[1:49:25] given you know that
[1:49:27] the lord through joshua the prophet with
[1:49:29] his message
[1:49:30] and the mighty angel there he said this
[1:49:33] is yours from dan to bashebo all the way
[1:49:35] through to this river and that sea
[1:49:37] all yours but there's a lot of squatting
[1:49:39] enemies on there
[1:49:41] a lot of squatting enemies on there i'm
[1:49:44] talking on an age level now
[1:49:45] we'll go to individual but let's just
[1:49:47] look at the age of them
[1:49:50] you see now they come out and they come
[1:49:52] through and joshua's gone now and
[1:49:54] the elders start to die off and
[1:49:57] things begin to change in the message
[1:50:01] things begin to get very very
[1:50:04] very ominous in the message
[1:50:08] are you following me now
[1:50:12] in that time where it's all ominous all
[1:50:14] the walls and all the fists begin to
[1:50:16] come out
[1:50:17] and all of the serpent doctrines begin
[1:50:19] to come out hothni and finney has
[1:50:22] hoffnai means fists and fighting
[1:50:25] finney house means the mouth of a
[1:50:27] serpent so these great leaners begin to
[1:50:29] rise up all through the different ages
[1:50:31] and it culminates in them
[1:50:33] the final fruit before an emergency was
[1:50:36] declared
[1:50:38] hallelujah the final it's like
[1:50:41] all that stuff that went on and all the
[1:50:44] darkness and all the evil that went on
[1:50:45] in the time of judges
[1:50:47] in the message worse than sodom
[1:50:50] could i dare say all right
[1:50:54] because they had more accountability
[1:50:56] than sodom
[1:50:57] hallelujah but an age was changing
[1:51:02] you know adorning because here
[1:51:05] had been a great outpouring and a great
[1:51:07] move under the prophet but then he left
[1:51:09] and now the people are left to their own
[1:51:11] devices and it says they were with no
[1:51:13] king
[1:51:14] in the time of the judges you see
[1:51:18] there was no one with a vision a real
[1:51:21] lasting vision to bring
[1:51:22] what do they need to bring everything
[1:51:25] that joshua promised
[1:51:26] this is the whole purpose there's an
[1:51:28] inheritance
[1:51:29] come down with an open book i don't have
[1:51:32] a bible here but
[1:51:33] i use an electronic one i always think i
[1:51:35] should have a book you know
[1:51:37] but anyway he comes down with an
[1:51:40] inheritance to them
[1:51:42] and reads it all out to them and they
[1:51:45] what happens
[1:51:45] they have to go through it they've got
[1:51:47] to go they've got to claim that they've
[1:51:49] got to get that
[1:51:51] but what happens when he leaves they go
[1:51:54] down
[1:51:55] down down down into the darkest of
[1:51:58] dungeons
[1:51:59] down into the darkest of places and then
[1:52:02] finally it comes up
[1:52:05] and he's a woman you know after all of
[1:52:08] that no king
[1:52:09] no lead leadership and and no
[1:52:11] inheritance really they've got some of
[1:52:12] it and this here and this here you know
[1:52:14] who finds that you know and there's been
[1:52:16] a lot of people now
[1:52:17] if i come to this day where they get so
[1:52:20] beaten down by this
[1:52:22] and then they go i'm leaving the message
[1:52:24] i'm out of here some great name pastors
[1:52:26] all over the world
[1:52:27] i'm leaving because of this brother did
[1:52:29] this and this pastor did this and
[1:52:30] this one here and that one there and you
[1:52:32] know who where's their faith
[1:52:34] is it in people or is it in him and if
[1:52:37] it's in him
[1:52:38] and they get real with god he will take
[1:52:40] you out and show you the bigger picture
[1:52:42] to show you what exactly is going on
[1:52:46] and why and yes it's bad but that bad
[1:52:49] is actually part of the purpose and plan
[1:52:52] of god
[1:52:54] having that time of darkness and and
[1:52:58] complete failure in all levels
[1:53:02] as part of the program it's part of the
[1:53:04] prophecy
[1:53:05] if israel went through it the bride goes
[1:53:07] through a similar thing
[1:53:09] in the spirit the natural types the
[1:53:10] spiritual
[1:53:13] but after all that you know
[1:53:16] and i believe i'm looking at a people
[1:53:18] that's gonna that's fulfilling this
[1:53:20] or and has fulfilled it a people that
[1:53:22] have risen up and gone
[1:53:23] enough is enough enough of this
[1:53:27] fighting enough of serpent teaching
[1:53:29] enough of these false things
[1:53:31] because you see this message is not a
[1:53:33] teaching
[1:53:34] this message is a person hallelujah this
[1:53:37] message is a mighty living god
[1:53:39] amen a god of the now a god of the
[1:53:41] presence
[1:53:42] this message is that
[1:53:45] and you see there's been a people and i
[1:53:47] believe i'm looking at you this morning
[1:53:49] hallelujah they've risen up like hannah
[1:53:52] and i've gone you know i just need to
[1:53:53] bring forth life
[1:53:55] i need to have something real happen in
[1:53:57] my life i need
[1:53:58] life to come forth from me and she she
[1:54:00] had been struggling for a long time
[1:54:02] and she had been ridiculed by her fellow
[1:54:05] wife
[1:54:05] penina which means pearl you see so a
[1:54:08] power is forming
[1:54:09] maybe you're going through some hard
[1:54:10] times maybe you feel like you're barren
[1:54:12] you haven't brought forth anything and
[1:54:14] all you've done is warm up you
[1:54:15] maybe you feel that way i don't know
[1:54:17] that's between you and the lord
[1:54:19] but you see and then you feel like these
[1:54:21] voices are coming at you and actually
[1:54:23] what is it doing
[1:54:24] it's forming a pearl of great price in
[1:54:27] your life
[1:54:28] that's causing a faith to rise up within
[1:54:30] you that can change the history
[1:54:32] of your own life and the lives of all of
[1:54:34] those around you
[1:54:36] and here comes hannah and she rises up
[1:54:38] and she's not worried about what goes on
[1:54:39] in the temple not worried about what's
[1:54:41] going on in the politics
[1:54:42] not worrying about what this one's doing
[1:54:43] and that one's doing whether that
[1:54:44] pastor's done wrong well that one's done
[1:54:46] not worried are you worried who's

[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:10] when we begin to unify hallelujah
[1:55:13] instead of fighting like offline funny
[1:55:15] house
[1:55:15] we begin to unify and begin to see god
[1:55:19] enact everything that the prophet
[1:55:21] promised anyway
[1:55:23] hallelujah i declare an emergency this
[1:55:26] morning

[1:55:36] inspired sometimes
[1:55:38] hallelujah watch and see amen
[1:55:42] hallelujah what happened she got down to

[1:55:51] in the top of the message and all the
[1:55:53] great leaders trouble

[1:55:56] high priest wasn't even

[2:00:05] under blood a ball and goat how much can
[2:00:07] he use
[2:00:08] you amen see samuel had to come
[2:00:12] out from under the wings of the of eli
[2:00:15] he had to have fear looking at
[2:00:16] fearlessness and courage
[2:00:18] now i don't mean you go and come out
[2:00:20] from under the wings of your past or
[2:00:21] anything like that i'm not saying that
[2:00:23] but i'm saying
[2:00:24] you need to have your own faith you need
[2:00:26] you've got to give these young people
[2:00:28] who is in here i'm not going to look at
[2:00:30] anyone individually but
[2:00:31] you you just go you just say lord here i
[2:00:34] am
[2:00:35] if you can use samuel you can use me
[2:00:38] hallelujah
[2:00:40] why not you why not now
[2:00:43] a gift is a gift amen you yield that to
[2:00:47] god and say lord
[2:00:49] maybe you don't know what it is you say
[2:00:51] lord
[2:00:52] you've made me on this earth for a
[2:00:54] purpose
[2:00:55] yes lord show me who i am
[2:00:58] lord what is my purpose lord
[2:01:02] i want to be like hannah lord hallelujah
[2:01:08] i don't want things to just continue on
[2:01:10] the same as they've always been
[2:01:11] and get what i've always got troubles
[2:01:14] and strife and
[2:01:14] just living a mediocre christianity and
[2:01:17] maybe
[2:01:18] you know some of the younger people
[2:01:19] might have only ever come to church with
[2:01:22] their mum and dad
[2:01:23] and you you actually haven't really had
[2:01:25] an experience with god but today
[2:01:27] today today young people
[2:01:30] it can go beyond mummy and daddy's faith
[2:01:33] today it can go
[2:01:35] into a whole new dimension where you
[2:01:38] enter in where the gifts in your life
[2:01:41] can begin to operate and god can begin
[2:01:44] to change this nation amen right here
[2:01:48] right here we're it's a supernatural
[2:01:50] it's not it's not like it used to be
[2:01:53] you know we're in a new season you know
[2:01:56] we
[2:01:56] we preach about the preparing of the
[2:01:58] lord right
[2:02:00] we preach about the how he has appeared
[2:02:03] in this generation and
[2:02:05] we think oh well he's appeared you know
[2:02:06] he's among us but really
[2:02:08] you've got to ask how does that
[2:02:10] appearing
[2:02:11] manifest how and i want to tell you now
[2:02:16] the main way it manifests he manifests
[2:02:20] is in the offices of his people
[2:02:24] in the gifts of his people because the
[2:02:27] revelation
[2:02:28] of our great king is happening within
[2:02:32] amen happening inside and therefore the
[2:02:36] gifts in your life
[2:02:37] reveal the coming of the son of man
[2:02:41] reveals the full measure the gifts in
[2:02:44] your life
[2:02:45] and not just gifts now i'm needing now
[2:02:47] offices as well
[2:02:48] amen so the fathers are different
[2:02:52] fathers than they were 20 years ago
[2:02:53] why why is that the mothers are
[2:02:56] different mothers than they were 20
[2:02:57] years ago
[2:02:58] why i ask the question what's happening
[2:03:02] what's dawning what's coming up
[2:03:05] what's rising within
[2:03:10] the sisters are different sisters the
[2:03:12] brothers are different brothers
[2:03:13] the pastors are different pastors things
[2:03:16] are changing
[2:03:18] we're not changing them we aren't doing
[2:03:22] the changing he's doing the changing
[2:03:24] it's him he is it says that the day star
[2:03:29] shall arise in your hearts
[2:03:33] as a sunrise shalom peace to the bride
[2:03:37] good morning where
[2:03:41] inside you it's a bright aged
[2:03:44] we say where inside you
[2:03:48] i don't see a bright age out there i see
[2:03:50] loud to see you out there's loud to see
[2:03:52] you
[2:03:52] out there's dark and gloom and gross
[2:03:54] darkness upon the people
[2:03:56] that's going to end in tribulation but i
[2:03:59] see
[2:04:00] a bright age in you and coming from
[2:04:03] within and manifesting out of you
[2:04:06] so you are the dawning of a new day amen
[2:04:10] hallelujah amen
[2:04:14] and so young people these gifts and all
[2:04:17] of us
[2:04:18] i'm just i just i just wanted to labor
[2:04:21] on the young people here because
[2:04:22] samuel for all we know was 12 whatever
[2:04:26] years old i don't know does anyone know
[2:04:29] how old he was it doesn't say does it
[2:04:31] but he was very young when
[2:04:32] the lord first came to him and in the in
[2:04:35] the temple he was still
[2:04:36] a little boy but you see now i don't
[2:04:38] know how long it's transpired
[2:04:40] until here in samuel 4 1 where it says
[2:04:42] and the word of samuel
[2:04:44] came to all israel so you see now a
[2:04:46] vision had begun to come to a dark
[2:04:48] message believing community a vision
[2:04:52] hallelujah because you see
[2:04:56] you see out of hannah's comes a prophet
[2:04:59] right
[2:04:59] but the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[2:05:02] of prophecy so the testimony of jesus
[2:05:06] christ
[2:05:06] in your life the day star
[2:05:10] arising in your hearts means that there
[2:05:13] is a sunrise happening in you
[2:05:16] hallelujah there is a dawning happening
[2:05:19] within you
[2:05:21] that is going to bring forth a testimony
[2:05:24] of jesus christ the spirit of prophecy
[2:05:27] so what does the spirit of prophecy in
[2:05:30] someone's life
[2:05:31] connect them to the vision
[2:05:34] of the original whatever prophet's ever
[2:05:36] come before
[2:05:37] and whatever the word has come and
[2:05:39] prophesied whatever is prophesied to
[2:05:41] happen
[2:05:41] begins to connect the people and all the
[2:05:44] congregation
[2:05:45] and all of them and everyone in the age
[2:05:48] back
[2:05:49] to the promises of god back to what
[2:05:51] joshua promised israel
[2:05:53] now things are starting to hum now
[2:05:55] things are starting to roll
[2:05:57] now revival begins to break watch how
[2:05:59] revival begins
[2:06:00] it's not how you think you know that
[2:06:03] song our god is tremendous
[2:06:05] and says that your victory will come not
[2:06:07] the way that you think it should
[2:06:09] well you know it's true very true
[2:06:12] amen and you look at this now
[2:06:16] so it says and the word of samuel came
[2:06:18] to all israel
[2:06:19] god came down to samuel he was a youth
[2:06:22] on fire
[2:06:23] to call a conference call an emergency
[2:06:29] now
[2:06:30] it says now
[2:06:33] so not just you know it doesn't just go
[2:06:36] on it says now israel went out against
[2:06:38] the philistines there's a reason why it
[2:06:39] says now
[2:06:40] because now's the time now here is a
[2:06:43] vision forming in the youth
[2:06:45] hallelujah young people no pressure but
[2:06:47] there's a vision for me
[2:06:48] you are the future of what's happening
[2:06:51] amen
[2:06:52] i still feel like a youth can i can i
[2:06:54] have that liberty
[2:06:56] amen actually you know what heaven is
[2:06:58] going to be one great youth camp
[2:06:59] one great youth meeting amen we're all
[2:07:02] going to be youth one day
[2:07:03] hallelujah all 18 amen will look like it
[2:07:06] anyway
[2:07:07] hallelujah i'm glad amen hello
[2:07:10] no more funny diets no more this than
[2:07:12] that trying to make myself this i'll
[2:07:13] just be
[2:07:14] right amen amen oh my
[2:07:18] amen don't have to worry about anything
[2:07:21] amen physically speaking
[2:07:22] we never you don't have to worry about
[2:07:24] anything spiritually right now but
[2:07:25] you better worry about your physical
[2:07:28] amen hallelujah
[2:07:29] amen you know we should respect the
[2:07:31] temple amen that we
[2:07:32] that we live in god gave us this body
[2:07:34] it's fallen as it is
[2:07:36] god gave it to us you know we have to we
[2:07:38] have to treat it well
[2:07:39] we have to treat it nicely and i just
[2:07:41] encourage you to treat your body good
[2:07:42] amen so it says now israel was went out
[2:07:46] against the philistines to battle
[2:07:49] and you know where this goes it's not
[2:07:51] you know
[2:07:52] amen and pitched beside ebenezer and the
[2:07:55] philistines pitched an affect
[2:07:57] and the philistines put themselves in a
[2:07:59] ray against israel and when they joined
[2:08:01] battle israel was smitten
[2:08:05] before the philistines and slow of the
[2:08:08] army in the field
[2:08:09] about four thousand men and when the
[2:08:11] people would come into the camp the
[2:08:13] elders of israel said
[2:08:14] wherefore has the lord smitten us today
[2:08:16] before the philistines
[2:08:18] let us fetch the ark of the covenant of
[2:08:20] the lord out of shiloh
[2:08:22] unto us that when it cometh among us
[2:08:25] it may save us out of the hands of our
[2:08:27] enemies
[2:08:28] so here we have now a group of message
[2:08:31] believers and yes the vision is forming
[2:08:33] but there has to be a bit of a showdown
[2:08:35] here there has to be a bit of a change
[2:08:37] going on here
[2:08:38] god is not ready we think oh yeah the
[2:08:41] vision's starting it's all going to go
[2:08:43] real good
[2:08:43] and then all of a sudden it goes the
[2:08:45] opposite direction all of a sudden it
[2:08:46] goes worse
[2:08:47] and we think why is all these people
[2:08:49] falling away why is everything going the
[2:08:51] way it is
[2:08:52] lord have i got it wrong am i in the
[2:08:54] wrong place am i in the wrong message
[2:08:56] no you're not in the wrong message god
[2:08:58] is working
[2:08:59] even when i don't see it he's working
[2:09:02] even when i don't feel it he's working
[2:09:04] just let him work amen don't temper with
[2:09:08] the evidence
[2:09:09] don't temper with it don't try and
[2:09:11] arrange it all
[2:09:12] let him work hallelujah he's got this
[2:09:16] amen he's got it all in control
[2:09:20] amen do you know that song he's got it
[2:09:23] all in control
[2:09:25] you know the song right he's got it all
[2:09:27] in control
[2:09:28] i have got nothing in control not me i
[2:09:31] am 100
[2:09:33] relying on him hallelujah amen you see
[2:09:36] that captain came down for a purpose
[2:09:38] and yes israel they lost touch with him
[2:09:41] because they
[2:09:42] had lost the vision and they'd gone in
[2:09:44] their own ways and
[2:09:45] there was fist fighting and all that and
[2:09:47] the angel just stood back
[2:09:48] and waited but remember when the angel
[2:09:51] comes to appear amongst us again
[2:09:52] which i believe are in that time now he
[2:09:54] begins to guide you again
[2:09:56] he begins to give you the same mysteries
[2:09:57] that set rahab free to set you free
[2:10:00] to set these young ladies free say amen
[2:10:02] to set the young man free
[2:10:03] to break more walls down hallelujah to
[2:10:06] take the rest of the camp
[2:10:08] to take the rest of the land that's what
[2:10:10] he's here for
[2:10:11] he says he will deliver you he will send
[2:10:14] hornets
[2:10:15] he will send deliverance he will go
[2:10:17] before you to ensure
[2:10:19] that you get your inheritance and i just
[2:10:22] encourage you
[2:10:23] don't be scared of angels
[2:10:26] amen they're here for our help ministers
[2:10:29] ministering spirits sent to the ears
[2:10:31] of salvation
[2:10:35] hallelujah
[2:10:40] so here you have this message believing
[2:10:45] joshua's message and they take
[2:10:48] the seventh seal and they begin to
[2:10:51] preach the seventh seal
[2:10:52] and it's all wonderful and it's going so
[2:10:55] well and it
[2:10:56] and it's people are just amazed at how
[2:10:59] it's all
[2:10:59] unfolding and all the mysteries are
[2:11:01] coming together and this and realizing
[2:11:03] the significance
[2:11:04] of 63 recognizing the significance of
[2:11:07] what it all is
[2:11:08] but not having it that's right
[2:11:12] there's a big big difference between
[2:11:14] knowing it and having him
[2:11:17] there's a big difference hallelujah
[2:11:19] between
[2:11:20] taking the seventh seal arc and going
[2:11:22] into battle but not
[2:11:24] with god this can be just symbols
[2:11:27] we can take the book of revelation and
[2:11:29] we can preach all the symbols and
[2:11:31] paint it all together and then
[2:11:34] 4 000 people get killed the army
[2:11:38] retreats
[2:11:39] and they get down and they begin to pray
[2:11:42] whatever they did they got there was an
[2:11:44] emergency
[2:11:45] you see they there's a difference
[2:11:47] between when man calls an emergency
[2:11:49] and god calls an emergency and when god
[2:11:52] calls the emergency
[2:11:53] hallelujah that's when god is with the
[2:11:55] seventh seal because he is the seventh
[2:11:57] seal
[2:11:58] but if you just come with the ark and
[2:11:59] you begin to wave this arc upon the
[2:12:01] people
[2:12:02] and wave it over the people and it's but
[2:12:04] where's god
[2:12:06] as is he there is it causing something
[2:12:09] real to happen
[2:12:10] are you winning the victory is the land
[2:12:13] being
[2:12:13] taken hallelujah and then all these
[2:12:17] people start to die
[2:12:18] and then it says here after that they
[2:12:21] went and got the ark
[2:12:22] and they took half knight and finney has
[2:12:24] and they went and they took them in and
[2:12:25] they died
[2:12:27] great leaders walking away leaving the
[2:12:30] message
[2:12:31] i just want to commend you brethren and
[2:12:33] i want to commend
[2:12:34] all of the old school that have been
[2:12:36] around for 50 years
[2:12:38] and all of those i want to commend you

[2:13:44] to the other if you want
[2:13:46] you you could have been in one and you
[2:13:48] can go to the other because the blood of
[2:13:50] jesus christ
[2:13:51] hallelujah it's got transforming power
[2:13:54] amen under this message you see it's
[2:13:57] like a bleach
[2:13:58] and it comes to cleanse you and take
[2:14:00] everything that you did
[2:14:01] and put it down on the head of the devil
[2:14:03] who's the one that influenced these
[2:14:05] things
[2:14:06] through fear and complexes and old other
[2:14:08] natures and all of these things that we
[2:14:11] are fleshly battling with
[2:14:16] hallelujah i'm about to close
[2:14:19] hallelujah amen
[2:14:24] i want to just take you now on a journey
[2:14:26] to the israel of today
[2:14:28] because we know that great things has
[2:14:29] been happening over there and when i say
[2:14:31] great i don't mean
[2:14:32] nice things but there's prophetic
[2:14:35] insight and you know ministers like
[2:14:39] brother adrian will probably bring it
[2:14:40] out with full color
[2:14:41] but i'll just touch on this just for the
[2:14:44] purpose of this thought
[2:14:45] emergency you see when israel
[2:14:50] gets attacked they're the natural bride
[2:14:53] does everyone believe that they're the
[2:14:54] natural inheritors of the land
[2:14:57] we're the spiritual bride and the
[2:15:00] inheritors of the land
[2:15:01] spiritually and eventually we will live
[2:15:04] in the new jerusalem and in the
[2:15:05] millennial conditions we'll be there
[2:15:07] but israel is a natural brother branham
[2:15:09] said watch the timepiece
[2:15:11] israel is god's timepiece you watch what
[2:15:13] she's doing and
[2:15:14] you'll get an indication of what's
[2:15:15] happening and you know those four
[2:15:17] thousand
[2:15:18] dead that happened you know we look at
[2:15:21] israel back in 20 something 14 or 16
[2:15:24] and they discovered that there was all
[2:15:26] these philistines coming down
[2:15:28] underneath the waters and getting up
[2:15:31] into the ranks of israel
[2:15:32] into the ranks of the message believers
[2:15:36] up in there beginning to kill from
[2:15:38] within
[2:15:42] terror tunnels as they said you see
[2:15:45] and at the same time what was going on
[2:15:48] in the bride
[2:15:49] a mess spiritual murder
[2:15:53] of great named pastors and big names and
[2:15:56] and and all going on from within
[2:16:00] the ranks of the spiritual bride so you
[2:16:02] can see there is a divine
[2:16:04] connection between spirit the physical
[2:16:06] and spiritual
[2:16:07] and so now today hallelujah
[2:16:10] you just remember that that this is an
[2:16:13] intrinsic reality
[2:16:15] that when something happens there you
[2:16:17] can rest assured
[2:16:19] rest assured there is war coming
[2:16:22] and it's changing things are changing
[2:16:24] and i want to encourage you now
[2:16:26] look through the veneer because the
[2:16:27] veneer might be only here for a little
[2:16:29] longer
[2:16:30] and that veneer is your little buffer to
[2:16:32] get fighting
[2:16:33] to get ready to become a devil killer

[2:18:50] specific that captain when he

[2:19:28] that's that spirit of hophni not each
[2:19:31] other you're fighting the devil
[2:19:33] he's the one if i could just preach a
[2:19:36] little bit
[2:19:37] to get you angry at the devil i could
[2:19:39] i'll do that
[2:19:40] but i'm not very good at that but he's
[2:19:43] the one that's destroyed your family
[2:19:46] or trying to he's the one that's taking
[2:19:48] your children away
[2:19:50] he's the one that tries to destroy your
[2:19:51] health he's the one that puts video
[2:19:53] games and tvs and things in your house
[2:19:55] to fill your mind with
[2:19:56] you know unsavory things he's the one
[2:19:59] that's destroyed the government in all
[2:20:00] politics
[2:20:02] so and your school your children go to
[2:20:03] schools and have you have to help them
[2:20:05] with it all

[2:20:09] but he's the one that's breaking your
[2:20:10] body he's the one that hurts you
[2:20:12] he's the one that does all this
[2:20:15] are you going to entertain him are you
[2:20:17] going to put up with him
[2:20:19] you don't have to you don't have to put
[2:20:21] up with him
[2:20:22] if he's troubling you this morning i'm
[2:20:24] you know we're going to finish in a
[2:20:25] minute
[2:20:26] and i want you we're going to pray
[2:20:27] together we're all going to pray
[2:20:30] and i want you to address your enemy and
[2:20:32] i want you to glorify your father
[2:20:34] in heaven because you see
[2:20:38] enough is enough enough is enough
[2:20:41] the prophet said you have to get angry
[2:20:44] at the devil
[2:20:46] because oftentimes we're just kind of
[2:20:48] having a conversation with them
[2:20:49] i cast you out in the name of jesus
[2:20:51] christ you know and
[2:20:53] stupid devil sort of thing that's not
[2:20:55] enough there has to be a deep
[2:20:57] indignation you've got to really see how
[2:21:00] much he's trying to destroy
[2:21:02] his enemy if you had someone in the
[2:21:03] flesh at you like that you know
[2:21:05] before you got the holy ghost and
[2:21:07] sometimes after
[2:21:10] you're going to get mad right someone
[2:21:12] that just has that niggling thing
[2:21:14] that greats against you oh lord help me
[2:21:19] hey man you you you get mad right
[2:21:23] and then you don't get mad at the devil
[2:21:24] he's the one that's actually causing it
[2:21:26] it's him in that old nature it's him
[2:21:29] doing all this
[2:21:30] now assign that to who it's who's
[2:21:32] responsible
[2:21:33] and when you address him you address him
[2:21:35] correctly
[2:21:37] hallelujah so let me get to this and
[2:21:39] then we'll close
[2:21:40] see this is israel's do you know who
[2:21:42] knows that israel had a policy change
[2:21:44] this is very very significant
[2:21:47] and i want you to listen really
[2:21:49] carefully they've had
[2:21:51] a cataclysmic policy change
[2:21:54] and their agenda and their position
[2:21:57] of war let me read
[2:22:00] a senior leuked minister on saturday
[2:22:02] said israel would preemptively
[2:22:06] strike the hamas terror group in gaza
[2:22:08] when it becomes apparent
[2:22:10] it's restocking its rocket asuna
[2:22:13] arsenal and spent gearing up
[2:22:16] to fire at israel as he laid out
[2:22:19] what he described as the jewish state's
[2:22:21] new security doctrine
[2:22:23] hallelujah and i believe that we can
[2:22:26] have a new
[2:22:27] message doctrine which is not new it's
[2:22:29] just
[2:22:30] you need to fight preemptively don't
[2:22:32] wait for the
[2:22:33] terrorists to fire rockets at you don't
[2:22:36] wait for it
[2:22:38] you go first you watch him he's starting
[2:22:40] to gear up over there now you strike him
[2:22:42] hallelujah amen everything i've said
[2:22:45] well the lord has inspired me to say
[2:22:47] here
[2:22:47] is leading up the joy the prayer able to
[2:22:51] actually enter into a spiritual
[2:22:53] intercession
[2:22:55] you don't have to be an intercessor as
[2:22:57] an office to intercede
[2:22:59] don't leave that up to the prayer
[2:23:01] warriors you are a prayer warrior
[2:23:03] all of you are prayer warriors
[2:23:07] hallelujah take your land
[2:23:11] take your inheritance take it you are
[2:23:14] you know we this is the devil we just
[2:23:16] think we think oh you know i'm not a
[2:23:18] prayer warrior
[2:23:18] their prewar is that one brother john
[2:23:20] brother this brother that their prayer
[2:23:21] warrior is right and i just go
[2:23:23] and i just say my little prayer at night
[2:23:24] no it's no longer that
[2:23:26] you don't have to do that you i'm
[2:23:28] telling you now
[2:23:29] it's not what you pray it's how you pray
[2:23:33] i just want to give you something that's
[2:23:34] very liberating for me and it's maybe
[2:23:35] just for me but
[2:23:37] i have a lazy boy at home and i like my
[2:23:40] lazy boy
[2:23:41] i sit there and i i just be lazy
[2:23:46] and i put it up like this and i go right
[2:23:48] back
[2:23:49] and i just relax and i just start
[2:23:50] thinking i just i just it's like i just
[2:23:53] just be thankful
[2:23:54] and then if the lord the lord just
[2:23:56] begins to minister sometimes and then i
[2:23:58] just get i then i sit up you know
[2:24:00] okay but it's now that's an extreme
[2:24:04] like example of relaxing
[2:24:07] right relaxing in his presence i was
[2:24:10] going to sit down for the rest of the
[2:24:11] service then
[2:24:12] it felt real good it's the relaxing
[2:24:17] and thankfulness right to what is it to
[2:24:19] do to get you
[2:24:20] all of us don't sign yourself out of
[2:24:22] this now
[2:24:23] all of us to have fellowship with god in
[2:24:26] prayer
[2:24:28] so that you can begin to see the enemy
[2:24:32] before he strikes see israel
[2:24:35] the natural bride i just say that
[2:24:39] because i can't think of another word
[2:24:40] the natural church the natural
[2:24:43] inheritors they have got so much
[2:24:46] technology that they lead the world in
[2:24:47] military technology
[2:24:49] in many cases with security and with all
[2:24:51] of these things right
[2:24:52] to to see the potential strikes
[2:24:56] so they look at it all and you see when
[2:24:58] they were bombing gaza
[2:24:59] they were bombing things that they
[2:25:01] already knew were there but they were
[2:25:02] bombing under an
[2:25:03] old policy an old doctrine but there is
[2:25:06] a new doctrine
[2:25:08] hallelujah they've got a new one and
[2:25:10] this is what the guy says he says
[2:25:11] this is a total change
[2:25:15] of the equation and i love this we've
[2:25:17] never done this
[2:25:19] he said now if you can really believe
[2:25:22] and have faith in that if that's
[2:25:24] happening in natural
[2:25:26] what is happening in the spiritual what
[2:25:28] is god
[2:25:29] got in store for you if you apply it
[2:25:32] amen
[2:25:33] i believe and i'm just going to say
[2:25:35] something here and you can take it or
[2:25:36] leave it
[2:25:37] i believe that god's going to equip you
[2:25:40] with a greater prayer life
[2:25:41] i believe that god's going to give you
[2:25:43] the spiritual technology
[2:25:45] amen to pre-empt the enemy strike
[2:25:49] and that's going to tie in and this is
[2:25:51] all coming fresh that's going to tie in
[2:25:53] to the prophecy in the church age book
[2:25:55] that says when she
[2:25:56] can discern the antichrist spirit and
[2:25:59] know who she is
[2:26:00] she will discern all of that and she
[2:26:02] will be an invincible army
[2:26:04] why because the devil can't get her
[2:26:07] hallelujah
[2:26:08] so just take that if you if it's for you
[2:26:11] you can have it
[2:26:12] take it take it you can i believe god's
[2:26:15] going to equip you i mean you've already
[2:26:17] got it
[2:26:18] but now you just have to have faith to
[2:26:19] say yes i'm going to have that i'm going
[2:26:21] to be able to preempt the enemy's
[2:26:23] strike as israel said we've never done
[2:26:27] this
[2:26:28] hallelujah
[2:26:31] and i want to just finish with this one
[2:26:33] thought if the musicians could come
[2:26:38] fight back or fight first
[2:26:42] you will come out victorious in both
[2:26:45] instances but fighting first is a lot
[2:26:48] better than fighting back
[2:26:49] amen who believes that let's stand amen
[2:26:53] hallelujah
[2:27:00] hallelujah
[2:27:03] hallelujah can you just play um
[2:27:06] do you know that song um
[2:27:10] what a beautiful name it is do you guys
[2:27:12] play that song here
[2:27:13] what a beautiful name it is the name of
[2:27:18] jesus christ
[2:27:19] my king if you can play that quietly i'm
[2:27:22] just going to read this
[2:27:25] just this is going to just close it all
[2:27:28] off
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:33] matthew 24 7 it says for nation shall
[2:27:35] rise against nation and kingdom against
[2:27:36] kingdom
[2:27:37] and there shall be famines and
[2:27:39] pestilences and earthquakes
[2:27:41] and divers places and all these things
[2:27:45] are the beginning of sorrows
[2:27:47] and that means it's like a birth a child
[2:27:48] birth of sorrows of the woman
[2:27:51] all of these things and we know that
[2:27:53] we've been in those for many times
[2:27:55] a long time now all through the last
[2:27:57] century and now it's all coming to a
[2:27:58] great
[2:27:59] end ahead brother branham says this and

[2:28:03] declaring an emergency and the emergency
[2:28:05] is the calamity
[2:28:07] that comes on the world to squeeze out
[2:28:09] what's really there
[2:28:11] but there has been that there is a
[2:28:13] opportunity for you this morning

[2:29:32] heart
[2:29:33] and rejoice hallelujah
[2:29:36] to see your victory as you dance
[2:29:40] and it's not out of line if it's by the

[2:30:14] and we were watching the people
[2:30:15] worshiping the devil
[2:30:17] in the town square and they were
[2:30:19] screaming and i thought i said to
[2:30:20] brother adrian
[2:30:21] what if the name of jesus spoken over
[2:30:24] the holy ghost lips
[2:30:26] could make us react like that to their
[2:30:27] reaction to the devil
[2:30:29] how can he do that can god do that
[2:30:33] yes let him impact you
[2:30:38] say lord i need greater victory

[2:30:44] to be more open to you
[2:30:46] i want to be so in love with you that
[2:30:48] when i hear your name
[2:30:50] like john the baptist dead in the womb
[2:30:52] although you may be sitting dead in the
[2:30:54] womb of this church
[2:30:56] and then you hear jesus
[2:30:59] jesus jesus
[2:31:03] and anointing brings you to life
[2:31:06] so that you can live like john the
[2:31:08] baptist in a womb
[2:31:10] and come out in a ministry come out
