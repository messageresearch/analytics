[music] Jesus, [music] what a beautiful name it is. The name of [singing] Jesus. What a beautiful name it is. [music] The name of Jesus. Hallelujah. We've had a wonderful, wonderful weekend so far. Just a phenomenal word this morning. And I trust that through these things, our relationships change with one another, but also our relationship with the Lord change. Amen. And that it that it becomes just [music] so much more real. I just love those quotes that we had up before the service. Just [music] absolutely beautiful things. Just everything is just coming together. And you know, it's like the Lord is lifting the curtain of of revelation because these things have been there. We've read it for years. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's it's in the Lord's time that he he's showing us who we are. [music] Amen. And I've said it recently in church, but we should stop relating to God as this distance angry father. [music] Amen. He's very close and he really loves us. I was thinking this morning while brother Daniel was ministering um 2,000 years ago Jesus condescended and he hid himself in the last place that people would go look and that was in a little manger &gt;&gt; somewhere in a poor little little town insignificant looking from the outside today that same God is hiding again in the most unlikely place and that is us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. people that [music] the world would pass by and think that can't be it, that can't be the second coming, but it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I don't want to take any time. In fact, I will uh just hand straight over to you, brother Daniel. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all tonight. Good to be in the presence of the Lord again. Amen. Good to be uh in the presence of the revelation of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You imagine walking into this, if you put that slide up, you imagine walking into that tabernacle, that synagogue, and knowing who that was. &gt;&gt; My my my. It would put a whole new meaning to going to church, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that's possible in this hour. Amen. We we come to church because it was our custom and it's what we did and all these type of thing. But there came a time where we come to church with a different outlook on church, a different revelation of church. Amen. So, it's wonderful to be in fellowship with the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Who is the same yesterday, today, and forever, a part of the eternal word. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. So, it's just an honor. I got to say I've thoroughly enjoyed uh my time here with with you all. Uh tremendous quality of people. Uh I just love you all very much. had some wonderful fellowship with with uh with your your children today. And uh to me, it's an it's an amazing thing that happens when a child can see themselves in the word. &gt;&gt; Then there's just a freedom that comes, a freedom to fellowship, a freedom to talk. I mean, can you think it about 16, 15, 16, 17, 18 year olds talking about Revelation 5 and seeing themselves in it? It's like, who are these uh super spiritual people, you know, like don't you know that I'm 50 years old and you shouldn't be talking about those things, you know, that's just for the old people, you know. But here we have by God's grace uh a a group of young people that are able by by only the Lord to identify themselves in the word and say this day this scripture is fulfilled. You know, brother Ram talks about that little boy who saw himself in the mirror for the first time and he's waving his hand and he's trying all these different things and then he realizes it's me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, that's what the Lord does to us when we look in the mirror of his word. He allows us to see ourselves. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we're just going to take one verse of scripture in uh Revelation chapter 8. Uh just it's a continuation. I'm not going to recap it all. Um we're just going to go straight into to uh the continuation of this morning. So, we'll just read this this one verse. uh Revelation 8:1. It's a very um predominant verse in our lives as believers. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Amen. Our heavenly father, we have certainly enjoyed our time with you, Lord, this weekend. Lord, we want to thank you for one another. &gt;&gt; Lord, because it is truly only because we can assemble ourselves together in the revelation that you have given us, Lord. It creates an atmosphere in this place that just allows the word to come forth. So, we thank you, heavenly father, for everything that you are making possible in our lives. Lord, I want to pray for those this evening, Lord. Every time your prophet said the word opens that there it it begins it starts a war. &gt;&gt; I want to pray tonight Lord for those that through the opening of your word over the weekend Lord it has started a war with an internal war within them. I pray heavenly father that they would draw on your strength Lord and find courage heavenly father to stand on your word. No matter what the people say, no matter how hard it might be, no matter how heavy the emotions are running, Lord God, may we all find the strength to stand on your word and fulfill your will. We pray in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. you can take your seats uh this this evening. Um so we're we're going to go straight into this as I as I've said um and look at the uh the requirements that uh a young man must meet uh before he can take the book. Um and obviously we we are taking this in Revelation 5. We'll we'll take a slide there in a moment. But we we do understand that we are taking this from Bible principles. Uh these are not things that we are are um making up. Um we don't go into the details of should we have a chaperone, shouldn't we have a chaperone. That's that's the father of the bride's issue. That's that's not my issue. Uh that's that's a personal thing and I I believe with all of my heart it's not wrong to have a chaperone but it's not mandatory to have a chaperone. But as the father of your daughter uh you should know your daughter enough and the young man enough to know whether they need a chaperone. Again, another example, my my son actually came to me and said, "Dad, I'd prefer if I had a chaperon." So, it wasn't my idea. In a chaperon's kind of a fancy name, they call it a third wheel, you know, like, you know, and and if you use the same third wheel for too long, they get worn out and they don't want to be used anymore, you know. You can buy them all the ice cream and food that they want, but just leave me at home and find another one, you know. But um we the thing the the principle here is that it's about relationship. It's not about rules and regulations. It's not about your us having a a a book of dos and don'ts. What we should do, what we oughtn't do. Um most of those things are just just made up and created out of fear. But um you know the Lord will deal with the father of the sister. Not just in courtship but the what what they allow in friendship, what they allow in courtship, what they allow in in engagement. Um that's that's up that's up to the father to deal with those things because we're not here to take the part father's place. We're here to put the father in his place. &gt;&gt; All right. And that's what that's what a ministry should do. It should it should minister itself out of a position or out of a job by you taking the position that uh fathers and and mothers taking their position according to the word. So um we'll we'll look at this thought of the the requirements uh because the lamb of God had to meet certain requirements before he was eligible uh to be able to take the book. Um and so we we want to look at these these requirements here. We'll just go straight to the highlight just to save time. uh the the cry went out the loud voice went out who is worthy to open the book. So one of the requirements was that he must be worthy to open the book. The the second requirement is in verse three there and it says [clears throat] there was no one found was able to open the book. All right. So we look at these two things as worthy. He had to be worthy and he had to be able. All right? Not not one requirement, but two requirements. And and um we'll we'll get into that a little bit now, but um I want the the fathers need to pay attention to this because you have to release the book. &gt;&gt; The father of the of the daughter um has to release the book. All right. Um, so you've got to know who you're releasing the book to. &gt;&gt; Um, [clears throat] we give our daughters away, so to speak, right? But uh speaking to the youth around the table today is just saying is when the when someone comes to the altar to be married and we say who gives this uh woman to marry this man and then the father of the bride says I do is that just something we do for the sake of doing it or is it a release and if it's a release do you know who you're releasing your daughter to and has he met the qualifications? &gt;&gt; Because the father was not going to release the book to someone who had not who did not meet the qualifications. &gt;&gt; He had to be someone who could meet the qualifications. And there there wasn't a lineup of people, &gt;&gt; right? There wasn't a lineup of people. There was only one. They searched all the earth. They searched all heavens. They searched under the earth. And no one was found worthy. But there was one that was found worthy and able. All right. So, what made him worthy and what made him able? And I I'm saying this because I I want you parents to understand this that you've got to be sure that this boy that boy young man that you're releasing your daughter to has meets the requirements for her sake, &gt;&gt; right? It's for her sake, for the book's sake. All right. Um, you'll remember last night we're in the in the service we were kind of looking for for a word that uh best describes um the lamb or the a a man taking the book without the groom releasing it. Um and um I think we I think the word we used was steal because if you're not releasing it, you're stealing it. But uh the Lord popped this um scripture into my my mind last night. Um here it says, "My sheep will hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them &gt;&gt; out of my hand. My father which gave them me &gt;&gt; is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that wonderful? So so the the the son knew the strength of the father's hand because he said no no no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. And that that word pluck means to take by force, &gt;&gt; to take without authority. All right? So, so if the the only way that the book can change hands according to God's word is if the book is released. Any other way, it's plucking it. And you know when you pluck an pluck a chook, &gt;&gt; you got to do it by force, &gt;&gt; right? The feathers don't fall out. You got to pluck it out, right? So that's the same word here. It means to take out by force. &gt;&gt; To take without authority. All right. So in um in this scene, sorry, what am I doing? Let me go back. I'm pushing the wrong button again. In this scene here, the father has got to release the book, right? But he's not going to release the book who to someone who's not qualified, right? So, a a father needs to know the qualifications. Father needs to know the qualifications that the man has to meet [snorts] before he can release the book. [clears throat] Otherwise, you're releasing the the book to someone that you don't know if they're able to do what they need to do to the book. All right. So, um, this is, uh, three accounts here we're going to look at all in John 17. Jesus here, uh, testifying of how he took the book. All right. I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So what we see here is that that that Jesus didn't pluck the book. &gt;&gt; There was a release of the book. &gt;&gt; He goes as far as to say I that those which thou hast given me &gt;&gt; released to me. &gt;&gt; All right. For they are thine. &gt;&gt; Right. So, whose are your daughters? Your daughters are yours. All right. They're yours. They that they your responsibility. All right. Uh verse 11. And now I am no more in this world, but these are in this world, and I come to thee, holy father, keep through thy own name those whom thou hast given me. Amen. &gt;&gt; That they may be one as we are one. &gt;&gt; All right. So, sec second verse second time. It was also in uh John 10:29 as well. But um just an example here that how Jesus speaks and the first the the first time that this scripture kind of come into my into my understanding was probably about 6 years ago when a I heard that a young man was going to take a wife without the father's consent and there was just something that come over me that I knew knew that this was wrong, but I didn't have a scriptural reference that it was wrong. And then the the Lord be to reveal these these scriptures to me that we we don't that the man should never take his bride without the hus the father's consent. All right, we'll get into a little bit of that. But father I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world. So it's it's very clear here how Jesus is expressing how he had h to how he got a bride. All right. And he got a bride because God gave him the bride, his bride. All right. There was a transfer of hands from one hand to the other. Okay. So, what makes the lamb [clears throat] worthy to um what makes the lamb worthy is the same thing that makes a young man worthy. Because in type the young man is the lamb. &gt;&gt; So what made the lamb worthy in revelation five to take the book is the same thing that that is required of the young man to take a bride. He must be worthy. All right. And um [clears throat] what makes the what made the lamb worthy is that he had submitted to the will of the father. He had overcome himself. What makes him worthy is that he has overcome &gt;&gt; which which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? What makes him worthy is that he has overcome his own self desires &gt;&gt; and he has submitted his own self-deed self desires and submitted himself to the desires of his spiritual father the the word of God. All right. So he's overcome himself like Jesus the lamb of God. He had to overcome himself. He had to say not my will be done but thine be done. All right? He he had to overcome. He had to be one who had submitted himself to the word of God. All right? So that's that's what made him worthy. All right. Um so when the the lamb come to take the book, the father noticed he had prevailed. He had overcome if even though the lamb was the only one who could take the book, it had to be a lamb that had overcome. &gt;&gt; Right? And this is why sometimes you you know you can have a revelation of one another but not be in a position to take one another. &gt;&gt; Right? Like the example that I gave you this morning of my son and his now wife. You he had a revelation of her but she wasn't in a position to be taken. Right? So the young the young man has to be in a position. The young man has to be in a in a condition that he is worthy to take her, right? Because there's a purpose behind it. He must overcome. So the Holy Ghost makes him worthy. All right. Now, just a bit of a story. young man comes into my office questioning um the requirements of uh that he had to meet and she had to meet in order for uh him to to be able to marry a a young girl. Now [crying] the question we will ask is is the only is the Holy Ghost the only requirement don't answer it right is the Holy Ghost the only requirement is prevailing the only requirement now in the case of Revelation 5, there was only one lamb, &gt;&gt; right? But in in in this case, in in in a case now, there's not one lamb, there's lambs, [snorts] right? There's young men, plural, many. So, does that mean if men have the Holy Ghost, then they're eligible? Is that the only requirement? &gt;&gt; Because if it is, then the father could just pick someone out who's got the Holy Ghost and say, "Marry my daughter." &gt;&gt; But there's another requirement. And that other requirement is that he must be able. &gt;&gt; He must be able to open the book, to read the book, and to look thereon. &gt;&gt; All right? So, so this this requirement, we could ask the question here, what made the lamb able to open the book? Cuz he'd met qualification number one. But qualification number two, what qualified him completely by meeting the second qualification? What made the lamb able to open the book? Um in in Genesis uh we understand that that in Genesis God took a part of Adam, created another Adam, right? &gt;&gt; And bought the mystery part of Adam to Adam. So what made Adam the original able to to take the book and reveal the book because this is the this is the second the second qualification. This is actually something that uh her father cannot do for her. Her father is not able to open the book. &gt;&gt; He is not. He He may be worthy. He may have the Holy Ghost, but he is not able. &gt;&gt; There's only one that is able. There's only one that is worthy and able, and that is her groom. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Only the bride's groom [clears throat] can take her into the fullness of the vision of God for her life. &gt;&gt; The father cannot take her into motherhood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Only her groom. her father her the the the the sister's father cannot take her into wifehood. &gt;&gt; The the sister's the daughter's father cannot take her into motherhood. &gt;&gt; And yet in the mind of God, God sees potentially your your daughters as wives. And as mothers, &gt;&gt; right? But the father of the daughter can't take them there. &gt;&gt; It requires her groom [clears throat] &gt;&gt; to come forward and take her into the fullness of God's vision &gt;&gt; for her life. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who is worthy and he's the only one who is able. All right. Only her groom can make her wife. Only her groom can make her mother. Quotation. Now, we're going to see what the book says about how it become open and is not made known until the lamb takes the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. The lamb takes the book. The lamb's got to meet the qualifications. And when the lamb takes the qualifications, the mystery is not made known until the lamb takes the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Until until the groom takes the bride, the mystery of of wifehood, the mystery of motherhood cannot be revealed to her. She cannot go there without him. &gt;&gt; It's going to require him to take possession of her and take her into wifehood, take her into motherhood. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happens at the altar. That's what a wedding is all about. a wedding is about. The scene of the wedding is Revelation 5 is when the lamb comes forward and takes the book out of the hand of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Weddings mean a whole lot more to me now than they did when I got married. I tell you, um you know, weddings in when when I got married in my mind were just some traditional thing that we did and had really no spiritual significance. But but now as as a marriage celebrant, you know, marriages mean so much. &gt;&gt; They mean so mean so much to me because it's the it's the father that walks the bride down his daughter down the aisle, &gt;&gt; right? And what's he doing generally? Generally is he is holding her. generally he'll she might have her arm through his arm, [clears throat] you know, and they're they're walking down the aisle together and the I I have them stop a little way down and the groom's standing up here and he's watching the bride come down and then once the groom stops, then the lamb's got to come forward. The lamb's got to come and take the book. So the lamb steps forward. The lamb steps off the off the off the stage. He steps down to where she is because it's down where she is that he's going to take the book. And God has come down. And the reason he has come down is to take possession of his bride. Because why? We are in marriage season. The marriage of the lamb has come. So, the groom steps down off the stage and he approaches his bride and she's still in the hand &gt;&gt; of her father and he he he shakes the father's hand and the father shakes his hand and then he takes her hand and he places her hand into his hand and then the father moves his hand away. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a release. What's he saying? I give her to to thee to take her to a place that I can't take her. &gt;&gt; That's right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm giving her to you. &gt;&gt; Knowing that you can take her to a mystery part of her life that she knows nothing about and I that I can't take her to. I can't take her into wifehood. I can't. Through me, she can't experience that. Through me, she can't experience what it means to be a mother. It's only through you. I'm giving her to you knowing &gt;&gt; that you are. This is the joining of two parts becoming one. I am giving her to you knowing &gt;&gt; knowing &gt;&gt; that you are a part of my daughter and my daughter is a part of you. This the exactly the same scenario in Revelation 5. God didn't release the book hoping. &gt;&gt; He released the book knowing. He gave her into his hand knowing that he was going to take her to heights that he couldn't take her in the office of father. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's got to take the book. &gt;&gt; And until the book until he takes the book, the mystery can't be revealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. God as a father. God as a son. God expressing himself as a father. God expressing himself as a as a son, as a as the groom. He knew as a father, he couldn't play that part. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he was going to play that part. but not as a father, as a son. Because he came as a as the son of God, the lamb of God, and he was going to come and take possession of her and take her to a height that he couldn't do as her father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's part of the reason he became flesh. That's that's how he got the name son of God or the title son of God was when the word become flesh and dwelt among us. Then he took on the title the son of God. He took on the title the [screaming] groom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God different title. But what he couldn't fulfill as a father he could fulfill as a groom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; my the the the the book had to be taken. It's not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we saw this morning, the sacredness of our sisters, &gt;&gt; there's a wonderful thought come to the table when we were fellowshipping. And I encourage you to fellowship because when you fellowship around the word, he comes on the scene. &gt;&gt; And the one one of the one of the points that were that came during that table uh talk was that that the Lord said, "I will restore sayaeth the Lord." But you know, part of what he was restoring is value to the sisters. He's restoring a value that they that that God ordained them to have initially in the Garden of Eden, but Satan got a hold of her and degraded her. He is now restoring that value again where the sisters all of a sudden recognize their value. I'm not just another book. I'm not just another person. I have value beyond what I understand. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The sacredness of the book. There was there was no one worthy to look upon the book. Right? &gt;&gt; Not even if the father was worthy to look upon the book. &gt;&gt; You understanding what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Are you reading in between the lines? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is only one who is worthy &gt;&gt; to look there on. &gt;&gt; And this is why you need to be careful what type of Snapchat images and and status photos you put up. &gt;&gt; Because if you're bearing yourself in a way that makes men lust after you, &gt;&gt; there's only one who is worthy to look on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. [applause] the sacredness of a sister. When she understands her value and how that value is sacred, she can then conduct herself. She can then dress herself in the strength of the revelation of who she is. There is only one who is worthy to look upon me. &gt;&gt; There's only one that's worthy to break the seal. There's only one that's worthy to look on me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you've got to keep yourself covered till that one comes. Praise the Lord. We're doing good. Genesis 2. And the Lord and sorry and the rib which the Lord God took from man made he a woman and bought her unto the man. So this is the this is the shadow. This is the sea chapter. We we understand here that the Lord God who made the woman by taking a part of Adam and making him a helpmate. He He's the one who bought her unto the man, right? The same as who brings the bride down the aisle. Right? Because really she is in a natural sense his hard work, &gt;&gt; right? She's the result of the labor of the parents, &gt;&gt; right? Adam didn't have anything to do with what she was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he had something to do with what she was going to be. But he didn't have anything to do with what she was. And nor does anyone except my wife and I. And you know, you can let's just keep it at that. All right. No one but my wife and I have anything to do with who my daughter is. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; But by the time my daughter comes down the aisle and I am walking her down the aisle, I like to think of it this way that she's gone as far as she can in the office that she is now in. &gt;&gt; And now wedding is a graduation. &gt;&gt; All right. wedding, a marriage is a graduation where where now she is going to graduate like from high school to university or whatever you want to say, but but you understand what I mean. And that what what the graduation what the wedding is going to do is bring her into a higher level of revelation of herself. So he must be able &gt;&gt; as now her spiritual head to bring her into a higher revelation of who she is than what she currently is. &gt;&gt; This is what the opening of the seal did for us as the bride of Jesus Christ. That's what it's doing now. that through the marriage of the lamb we are we have reached a level of maturity that we could not reach outside of the marriage of the lamb or before the marriage of the lamb but because the marriage of the lamb has come we are reaching a height of maturity we have reached a height of maturity that we otherwise couldn't before the marriage &gt;&gt; so the purpose of the marriage is spiritual growth is natural growth both both of those things in one because when you become a wife, you don't grow naturally only, but you grow spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need less of a relationship with the Lord as the wife when you get married or as a as as the wife when you once you're married, you need more of a relationship because you're you're coming to a higher position. &gt;&gt; All right. It's the same as in um um Revelation 4 or Revelation 3 where I think we sung a song about it this morning where where the Lord says to John, "Come up higher. I need you to come up higher." Well, that's the same thing that that God is doing with us. All right? But we notice here that that that the Lord brought her unto the man, but he didn't say anything, did he? He didn't speak concerning her. He just bought her. He didn't reveal her. &gt;&gt; Cuz she was sealed, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But God as a father couldn't break the seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us &gt;&gt; verse 23. &gt;&gt; And Adam said, &gt;&gt; "Not God said." &gt;&gt; Not God as a father said. It says, "And Adam said." Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, who's breaking the seal of his of the woman's life? &gt;&gt; The groom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The groom. So, what made it possible for Adam to be able? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To break the seal because this is a qualification. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's the same thing that the the that made the lamb able. &gt;&gt; And the reason that what made Adam able is because she was from him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was going to bring a couple of bottles out, but There's a couple here, but I was hoping to have one with a label. Um, [snorts] can you, brother? I I I had them ready and I thought, "No, that's silly." I may have put them back in the little thing in there, brother. I had one with the label ripped off. So what what made Adam able? What made the lamb able? Right. Because it's not just the qualif Yeah, that's tremendous. It's not just the qualification of having the Holy Ghost. They they they must be a part of one another. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, a group of men having the Holy Ghost and you have one sister, can the sister just pick any man because the all the brothers meet the qualifications? &gt;&gt; No. She She's got to have a revelation of her part, &gt;&gt; right? And it's the same the other way. If there's one man and many sisters and all the sisters have the Holy Ghost, does that mean that if the only qualification is that she's got to have the Holy Ghost, can the man just pick the most beautiful out of the bunch and say, "Well, everyone's had the Holy Ghost. I can pick whoever I want." No. He's got to find the other part. Because what was happening here &gt;&gt; that God was bringing the two parts of one man together. &gt;&gt; So what made Abel able sorry what made Adam able was that it was another part of himself &gt;&gt; and because he knew who he was, &gt;&gt; right? because he knew who he was. He was able to reveal the mystery &gt;&gt; part of himself because it's not two different parts coming together. He said this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. He's saying what I am, you are. He was saying she is me. &gt;&gt; But how can he say she is me if he doesn't know who he is? Yes. &gt;&gt; You've got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; In order for you to be able to know the other part, you've got to know who you are. If you don't know who you are, then how can you know your other [screaming] part? &gt;&gt; That's right. So, it's not just a matter of of a a man finding a wife, &gt;&gt; right? He's got to find a wife that is a part of him. &gt;&gt; Though there be other other fine young eligible ladies in his view, he's not looking for a woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. He's looking for his woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what God come to do. He wasn't looking for a bride. He was looking for his bride. &gt;&gt; There may be many fine young ladies in this room, but there is only one of me, and that's the one I go home with. &gt;&gt; There may be many fine young Christian people in this world. But God isn't looking for a Christian person. He's looking for more than that. He is looking for a part of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you read the ingredients on this, &gt;&gt; the nutritional value, &gt;&gt; what you'll find is it's going to be the same as this &gt;&gt; because the label that is on this can actually go on that and it be exactly right. &gt;&gt; The bride, the groom is the word. The labels that we put on him, he's the word. He's the the spirit of life. He's eternal life. He's this and he's that. That label can actually go on her because she is word of his word, spirit of his spirit and life of his life. &gt;&gt; Why? Because this is it. It it really it's not two parts but two two different persons. It's two parts becoming one part. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is not the only qualification. You need a revelation of your other part. &gt;&gt; And that's what happened here. &gt;&gt; Adam was worthy and Adam was able. Like if if if I had a Oh, here we go. Something wrong, right? &gt;&gt; Different ingredients, &gt;&gt; right? This can't reveal this &gt;&gt; because this is different to this, &gt;&gt; this is this is a different substance. This is this is not the word. No, &gt;&gt; this is the word. &gt;&gt; Right? So, you want more than a bride. &gt;&gt; You want your bride. &gt;&gt; Right, sisters? I told them at the table, you want more than a man. &gt;&gt; Don't ask God for a man. &gt;&gt; Ask him [screaming] for your man. &gt;&gt; Because there's only one. Lord, where's my lamb? Reveal my lamb to me. I don't care how charming [screaming] and how value much much wealth he's got. That means nothing. &gt;&gt; It absolutely means nothing. What's important is that you are a part of one another. And it is not two foreign objects coming together, but it is two of the same part coming together. These two become one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say this again. Because this is again, &gt;&gt; this isn't a union. It's a reunion. &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 is not a union. &gt;&gt; It's a reunion. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that book was a part of him. God, the lamb was coming forward to take a part of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't coming to take a creed. &gt;&gt; The book was a further revelation of himself. And that is what the man is looking for. The man is looking for a further [screaming] revelation of himself because he feels within his heart that there's a part of him that's missing [clears throat] &gt;&gt; and he goes through life. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Praise God. Yep. What has he found? &gt;&gt; He's found himself. &gt;&gt; He's found the missing part of himself. And this is like like do do our our marriages his will or our will? &gt;&gt; Because if they're ours, then we need to stop saying what we say at the wedding. Because at the wedding, what we say is, "Let no man pull us under what God &gt;&gt; Amen. hath joined by put together. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So, so when I married my wife, did God foresee it? &gt;&gt; If if I don't think he did, I'm in trouble. &gt;&gt; Right? Because the strength of my marriage is not I hope so. &gt;&gt; The strength of my marriage is not me. And I hope this works. You know, I married a couple that were married for two, three years, had two children, and the wife looks across the table to the man and she says, "I still don't know if he's the right one." I wasn't a pastor then. I was just helping someone out. I thought, "Man, I'm glad I'm not a pastor. I don't want to have to deal with this. I don't think we even replied. Huh? My wife was there. Goodness. A marriage is a revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Um this is this is why the book was in the hand the right hand of him. And the right hand that the book was in had a revelation of who was coming to take the book. I'm giving her to you because I believe with all of my heart that you can take her into realms that I as her father cannot. &gt;&gt; I surrender everything she is and I give her to you. I place her in your care believing. Now I want to I want you to understand this. Marriages are never without troubles. &gt;&gt; Wow. But damn, you can't speak like that concerning my marriage. Okay, I can't. All right, but marriages go through storms. &gt;&gt; But you know, I I hope this is okay. I hope I'm not offending um my my my daughter and my son-in-law, but you know, I've I've watched their marriage go through some rough times, but you know where I go to the revelation that God gave me &gt;&gt; concerning my son-in-law. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When when I be Oh, man. like and your mind begins to wander. &gt;&gt; You know where I go? Back to the revelation. &gt;&gt; Back to the revelation of why I gave them &gt;&gt; gave her to him because God revealed to me that you are the one. &gt;&gt; God had also revealed to me that there was another one who wasn't the one. &gt;&gt; Huh? But thankfully through the relationship that I had with my daughter that that one come to an end. &gt;&gt; So the father can have a relationship that he is or he isn't. &gt;&gt; Well, he's a fine young man. He's this. He's that. He's that. He comes to church. Yeah. Okay. He could be all that. He could be Holy Ghost filled, but that doesn't mean that that any man who's has the Holy Ghost is my daughter's part. &gt;&gt; He's got to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I've taken it too far, but it works. &gt;&gt; Cuz why? I believe it's exactly the same thing that the lamb did, &gt;&gt; the father did. He had a revelation of the lamb. &gt;&gt; I've heard people say, "Oh yeah, you know, someone come and ask me for my daughter's hand in marriage." I said, "Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll give you a bag of groceries and a tank of fuel." Well, you value your daughter, don't you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God God wants us to understand. God wants us to understand our role as a young man. You're not looking for a woman. She might have eyes like the stars, teeth like pearls, neck like a swan, but so what? Your other part might be the ugliest sister in the room. [laughter] Sorry sisters, none of you are ugly. Okay. But look, the it's the out the outside is not the main focus. [laughter] No, no one married an ugly bride. Come on. Right. Every bride that that got married was the most beautiful thing that the groom had ever laid eyes on. She she was the standout. It didn't matter who else was at the in the ceremony. It didn't matter who the the bridesmaids, etc., etc. They just fade into insignificance. They may as well even not be there because he is only looking at one, &gt;&gt; and that is her, the most beautiful one in the room. &gt;&gt; No one can outdress her. No one can out beauty her. &gt;&gt; Why? because he's looking at his other part. &gt;&gt; I love the story that the prophet tells about the rancher's son &gt;&gt; who's looking for a bride and they all dole themselves up trying to attract this guy and here's this little washer woman not even considering that she is going to be a part of his economy. &gt;&gt; So she just ah I'm there's no chance for me. I'm just going to do what I do and go and wash the dishes and mop the floors. And he got fed up with this fake facade of people &gt;&gt; and went for a little bit of a walk, perhaps not even knowing she was in the washroom. &gt;&gt; But she come out to throw out the dishwater. &gt;&gt; She had no shoes on. &gt;&gt; She had her work clothes on. &gt;&gt; I tell you, young man, what type of woman do you want to marry? one that's dled up, that doesn't know how to work, or you want someone that has the potential to be able to look after your children, look after your home, and and and and be a homemaker. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's the type of woman I married. And that's the type of woman that any decent guy will want if he's got the right character within him. He's not after a beauty queen. He's after someone who can who can uh look after his children. He's looking for someone who has character. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not a character that you paint on and paint off, wash off. You understand what I mean? Not a character that you put on and take off, right? A an inbuilt character, an internal character. That's the type of woman you're looking for. &gt;&gt; She comes out and she she throws out the dishwater over the fence and and he just happens to be there. [snorts] He says, "Excuse me, da da da da da da da." And she gets embarrassed. Brother Brown says she she took that wash basin and put it over herself because she was a little bit embarrassed of her state that she was in in the presence of this great man. And lo and behold, he asks her, "Will you marry me?" You see, he didn't find his other part on the dance floor. &gt;&gt; He didn't find his other part in the in the imitation because that's all they were. They were all just false. &gt;&gt; But he found a real woman [laughter] who wasn't false, but she was real. &gt;&gt; And that's what God bought to Adam. God bought to Adam a real woman. And the fact that she was real is because she was a part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, who is the lamb redeeming? Who is the lamb marrying? I didn't put my stopwatch on. &gt;&gt; Should I do it now? I'm joking. [snorts] So the parents are the ones who release their daughters on parents on the on the son's side are instructing their sons to do things according to the will of God. [snorts] right? Which is the word of God. And that is what God is giving us through this weekend. &gt;&gt; He's empowering. He's putting power where power needs to be put. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that is back in the hand of the parents &gt;&gt; to encourage their sons to do things right. Don't be hasty. Don't pluck that that that that that father's daughter out of his hand. You take the right approach. &gt;&gt; Right. And the the when the when the lamb when this the boy approaches the father and the father says no. If the boy then says, "Oh, well, not to worry. I'll find me another one." He was never yours. &gt;&gt; Never. Never. Because the lamb was willing to do. Now, I'm speaking about Holy Ghost filled fathers. Whatever the father desired or wanted from him, There was nothing that the lamb would not do to have you. &gt;&gt; I mean, could he have done any more? &gt;&gt; Really, he couldn't. He couldn't. The go the father of the book asked the lamb to do the hardest thing. He couldn't do any more than what than than He couldn't do any more than what he did. And this is why this is going to seem like you're like a saddest or something, but in in ma in courtship, I look for the battle. I look for the challenge because the lamb had to overcome. So in in every marriage that I have um been the celebrant in there has been a challenge involved in courtship &gt;&gt; not engagement. engagement, it's too late in courtship, right? Where the father could say no, the father can be um m maybe he's got strict boundaries. Maybe he wants his daughter not going here, not going there. He doesn't want his daughter out at night. He doesn't want he wants his daughter home by 6:00. He wants you, you know, he he's got these conditions that he Now, look, I'm not talking about men who are taking advantage of a young man. I'm talking about men who have are filled with the Holy Ghost and want the best for their daughter. &gt;&gt; Right? So, so, so, um, there can be there can be these struggles in courtship that happen, but if the man ever gets to the point, sisters, where the battle is too hard, do you know what he's saying? &gt;&gt; You're not worth it. If he ever starts to think that way, pull out &gt;&gt; because if you are his other part, you will be worth it. &gt;&gt; The his mind the way that he is thinking is not wrong. &gt;&gt; It's the result of you not being the other part of him. I I can tell you firsthand testimonies of this of of how this works, &gt;&gt; right? Because the groom, your groom, your your male partner will do anything if you are the other part of him. &gt;&gt; Nothing will restrict him. Nothing nothing will stop him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we had a a um incident where a beautiful brother and sister, we had a sister living with us for some time and I think she was around 25 26 somewhere around there and this young this young man came into her life and uh he he he flew over um they knew each other when they lived in um somewhere else and uh and he flew over and and and uh got to know her and he they come to me and and told me look you know I've approached the dad and he's he said it's okay and um we're we're going to we're going to get married and we're planning it for for not too in the not too distant future and um he had to then fly home which was which was in Africa somewhere and and once as he was flying home co hit the first the first bout we had of CO and you know what happened like everything just went into shutdown. So here they were they'd been engaged that they'd um they they' set a a plan a date for their for their wedding and now they didn't see each other for two years. Now this is what I say. I look for the struggle. &gt;&gt; If they weren't a part of each other, &gt;&gt; they wouldn't have gotten through it. &gt;&gt; But really, it didn't matter if it went on for four years. &gt;&gt; Because they were part of one another, &gt;&gt; he could endure it. because they were part of one another, she could endure it. &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's the these things are uh are really important because sometimes we think, oh, you know, there's there's a struggle happening and you know, what am I going to do? And but if she is yours, brother, you will do whatever is necessary. There was a young brother just recently, not in my church. I was just giving him counsel because the sister he was interested in was in my church. I'm not going to tell you that one. Praise the Lord. I just feel the Lord checking me there. So, praise the Lord. Amen. So, the the the fathers released the book to the lamb because the father has a revelation of the lamb. All right. So, this is revelation. Revelation, revelation, revelation. Doesn't matter which way you want to look at it. There's a revelation. Not emotion. Revelation. All right. The the the lamb has a revelation of the book. The book has a revelation of the lamb. The hand has a revelation of the book. And the hand has a revelation of the lamb. Everywhere you look, it's about revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the requirements of the young man are that he must be worthy and he must be able. All right? He must be worthy and he must be able. What makes him worthy? The Holy Ghost. What makes him able is that he is another she is another part of him. &gt;&gt; All right. We don't just want men marrying any woman. I've seen enough shipwreck marriages in my time to last me the rest of my life here. But we we we should be seeing a a a backwards trend &gt;&gt; in the break of marriages in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And I believe with everything within me that God by this word is saving shipwrecks. &gt;&gt; It is. He is saving shipwrecks by bringing sisters and brothers to the revelation of their position according to the word. Not according to some theological idea or some man-made thing. It's this is not man-made. I've had people tell me this is you are just make I am not making this up. This is God's word and I believe this is God's vision for my sons. This is God's vision for my daughters. And this is God's vision for my wife and I as parents. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe if we follow the word, &gt;&gt; then we should see a decline &gt;&gt; in shipwrecked marriages in the message. Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know how I did that time, but I'm done. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I think I've got one quote to finish here. He said, "But remember, he went there with you in him." &gt;&gt; See, God had never separated the bride and the groom yet. So when God looked down upon the body of Christ, he saw both male and female. It was all redeemed in that one body. See, they are one. [clears throat] Same same word. The same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same word. &gt;&gt; Springwater. Springwater. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is the bride? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same word. And this is why when when you look at the red letter writing in your Bible and Jesus starts to talk about himself, he's talking about you, too. &gt;&gt; Because the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why you are identified by the same word, the same book that he was identified with. You can pick up the same book and identify. He can identify you in the book as part of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is introducing himself to you as him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Trust it was a blessing. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Thank you, brother Elray. Praise the Lord, man. What a weekend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation, revelation, revelation in everyone. We started off with it's relationship, relationship, relationship. You're going to sing that song when I put up there. Um, we started off in every direction it's relationship, but we ended up with in each one of those relationships. It's got to be revelation. Isn't that just absolutely marvelous? You know, it's the biggest problem of all of this is when we're in a rush, when we get nervous, when we get fearful, when we start wondering, Lord, are you going to figure this out? Lord, I need to help you. &gt;&gt; And the family and the everyone else gets emotional and excited and emotional pressures. All of that is excitement, but it's not a revelation. &gt;&gt; And both parties, or in fact, all the parties involved, need that revelation. Amen. That's so good. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Daniel. God bless you richly. It was really lovely to have you here. Thank you for your sacrifice to come. I know it's been a long journey and sacrifices, &gt;&gt; but we really appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Appreciate you, Sister Shill, for coming along.

Precious heavenly father, Lord, over the ages, you have been slowly giving out revelation after revelation. Through those church ages, Lord, they g you gave them a little bit of this and a little bit of that. But at the end time, Lord, the book was open. And there's nothing held back now, Lord. And Lord God, you're just pouring out more revelation upon that little part, that part of yourself. Lord, we are coming back to know how you see us, Lord God. We've looked in the mirror of ourself and we have seen nothing good. But when we look into the mirror of the word of God, there is [music] you said there's not even a spot, wrinkle, or a blemish because it is your righteousness that we are living in, Lord God. And Lord, we thank you, Lord. It's your righteousness, not our our own righteousness because we have none of our own. It's all in you, Lord. And we thank you, Lord. And we just pray Lord that you'll bless our brother and our sister Lord as they go back Lord I pray that you'll bless the church over there Lord. Lord I just pray you keep taking them from glory to glory. Keep taking us here from glory to glory Lord God because we're all in this together Lord and we thank you for this wonderful weekend Lord. It's just something very special. It's something very deep. It's something inside of the very depth of our soul Lord God. And Lord, you are changing us, Lord. When we even don't feel like we're changing, you are changing us, Lord. [music] And we thank you for that supernatural work, Lord. We give you the thanks in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord. Amen.
