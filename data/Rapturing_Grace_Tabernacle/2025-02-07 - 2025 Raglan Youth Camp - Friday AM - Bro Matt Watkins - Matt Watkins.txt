about we have so much that we can be thankful for am mean we are such a privileged people amen I wonder if I could just ask you to take your seats just for a moment thank you for being here and thank you for being you I must say you look a lot brighter than you did last night when we started the service I believe some of you have had some really good sleep so I'm thankful for that for you and I trust that you are able physically mentally spiritually to receive everything the Lord has for us this morning I trust that you're excited about Camp I trust that you're excited about the word I mean we enjoy every part of camp we we encourage every part of camp we we want to enjoy the word but we also want to enjoy the fellowship and and I want to encourage you make friends with people that you know if the Lord should T that in future you you know you're going to interact all of your lives and these are good friends to have I I mean that I really thank the Lord for this opportunity for you know for young ones from different and forgive me if I call you young but you know it's all relative right but um for to have the opportunity to make friendships and and in some cases we have some International visitors also um and uh you know it's a cross cross country border borders and so on and it's just a really good opportunity so it's I will also encourage you get out of your little circle or your little click not that I'm saying there's clicks here but you know it's just natural for us to fellowship with the people that we used to but maybe maybe get out of our comfort zones a little bit and make friends with people that you know that that can be a blessing to us um in the long run also in other churches and things yeah I'm hesitant to say it but you know perhaps there's husbands and wives sitting there somewhere that you don't know about yet but I'm going to get in trouble with some of the pre parents so I won't say that too loud I'll repeat what I said here last year I think it was brother Freddy um he said he said to his youth there we go oh no grandpa he says he said to his youth you have to start thinking of one another as more than just brothers and sisters so praise the Lord um so firstly thank you very much for those song items really appreciated that um and I will encourage you all continue each one of those song items so far has just been wonderful and special and and anointed um and let the Lord use those gifts in your lives to to uh open the path for the service and open the path for the word to come and be a blessing you know sometimes you know sometimes people are reborn and filled with the Holy Ghost when someone sings a song item you know the Lord uses different ways to touch hearts and change change Hearts so I don't want to take a lot of time but there's just a few practical things I would just like to um to just mention so that we all kind of on the same page firstly um some of you would have noticed that the um some of the it's hard to say adults because most of you are adults too let's say the oldies and then I'll get in trouble on the other side um sitting with their phones during the service now it's not because we are bored with a service um after today's service and after tomorrow morning we have a quiz so what we're doing is we're listening for things that um that could be used in the quiz so we all send our our questions in um of course that brings me to the Practical side of it also so um I think it's at is it at 12:30 if I remember right yeah we we have a quiz year and the questions are going to come from yesterday's services and this morning's service um and obviously that's also part of the team competition so um so that should not be your motive for listening but if if you need a motive then listen praise the Lord um also um you would have seen on the program that um we have a testimony service tonight now that testimony is specifically brother Travis who's traveled with brother Matthew um he's going to share his testimony tonight so I'll I'll just um describe to you how that's going to work so we all going to go down those of you who were here last year will know down by the U the air rifles and and the um archery so we can have another bonfire tonight um and then down there um um brother Travis is going to share his testimony so um we were very thankful there's a fire ban in place here but we U by God's grace got got granted a fire permit so we'll be able to make the bonfire so we thank the Lord for that so that's exciting that was very special last year um also again a reminder I know Mana made this announcement yesterday um so by tomorrow morning um we don't have a normal service we we'll have the question and answer service to tomorrow morning um so I want to again encourage you all to hand me questions and if I'm too scary hand it to any of the any of the yellow jackets as I call them and um and then they will pass it on to me now there's a few things that I know some of you had questions about or were nervous about um so firstly I want your name on the question that's important for me um but I won't announce whose question it is so as far as everyone else is concern and it's an anonymous question um but it's just for me to know is asking the question and there's there's important reasons for that um so that's the first thing you're welcome to ask questions you ask can ask questions about absolutely anything um in your in your spiritual walk in the Bible in the message or anything like that of course I'm Not For a Moment claiming to know everything and if I don't know I will just tell you I don't know um but um I think it's a wonderful opportunity so I want to encourage you don't wait till tomorrow morning puts a lot of pressure on me it did last year right please give them to me now if you can directly after service and and if you want to just send it to me by text or write it on a piece of paper or whatever it is feel free to do that so last year we had a wonderful time it was one of the highlights of Camp um we had a really really special time with a Q&A and I trust that that the Lord will bless it again we we depend on him for everything um the other question that some had is is the question and answers going to be streamed um because that you know inhibits people a little bit if they know that Mom and Dad is is at home listening to what's being asked or or whatever it is um excuse me we're not going to stream it publicly we're going to put it on YouTube privately and I'll share the link with you afterwards um so you can go back and listen to it again but we're not going to make it publicly available so then everyone knows exactly where that is also praise the Lord so those are the the announcements um excuse me I also want to wish the most wonderful woman in the room a wonderful 27th anniversary [Applause] today the Lord has been very gracious to us 1998 we got married on this day and had no clue what life I've had for us and why today we've in Africans we have a saying we've eaten a few bags of salt together um basically we've we've gone through all sorts of things but by God's grace we're here today so really thankful for that so let's stand and we'll sing a song as I call brother Matthew up um praise the Lord let sing this song there is a thought in times of need that gives me hope that brings me peace in every trial through every test my savior stand in my defense so in the road you walk Lees you TI and warm all your strength is gone and your heart feels Thor remember God is greater than the stor take courage for the battle is is the Lord and when the waters rise he calls my and let me [Applause] come on the way he holds my hand L I should fter and makes

certainly just a privilege and an honor to be here once again I wonder sister Deborah could you come amen at this time I want her to sing a special and she'll just play the piano there as she comes

of them last year preached uh many different youth camps and uh just uh talk to a lot of young people and and and uh they're all your brothers and sisters all across the world fighting the same devil that you're fighting fighting the same battles that you're fighting but we've got the same God Amen and uh he is he is our Victor amen he is our strength the battle is not ours it's the Lord's amen I'm so glad to have my wife Rachel uh here with me who traveled with me and so this is a real special occasion for us she's a homebody she don't like to travel uh she's I shouldn't say that she's going to get me for after for saying that but she likes to be home and uh and be with her her animals and her kids and so it's a great privilege to have her it's also a great privilege to have brother Travis um and sister Deborah if you don't know uh if you know brother Dell Smith this is Brother Dale Smith's daughter and brother Travis will be his son-in-law and their little baby miles we're just glad that they came we've had such a wonderful time amen just so glad to be part of the family of God I've asked sister Deborah you can be seated to sing a song She's a songwriter gifted and write songs so this one just fit with my sermon [Music] today sometimes I feel so far away from where I'm supposed to be the trials of a wey world are flooding over me the burden of my heart a war within my mind but peace will come when I recall a desire fire deep inside his words in my mouth his hands reaching out his love in my life his way in my sight Jesus only Jesus only in me the path ahead of me is settled in my soul I'm anchor to the Holy One and he will be my goal the mind of Christ in Me by this I shall shall Prevail the only way to overcome every time I [Music] fail his words in my mouth

in my sight Jesus only Jesus only in me [Applause] thank sister Deb God bless you if you have your Bible we'll turn to the Book of Romans chapter 7 amen do you appreciate that special amen is that your prayer Jesus I want you only amen your words in my mouth amen your hands reaching out amen we just want to look to the word this morning now I just am going to take a little bit of a turn uh from where the direction we've been going and want to do just uh just the way the Lord led me just to do more um I guess I would call it maybe teaching gear uh for the morning services and then uh the Lord's got something real uh heavy upon my heart for this evening so you just be an expectation for that amen how many expect to meet the Lord to see the Lord to touch the Lord amen you know I just want to say that no matter what I do no matter what I say no matter what we do at this Camp there's only one thing that really matters out of all of it and that is that you touch the Lord Jesus that's all that really matters doesn't matter what happens uh who you see what takes place so long as you touch him amen and I believe that he can be touched how many believe that amen he can be touched we'll go as far as we can this morning I want to give this a title this morning being changed you'll see where that comes from here in a moment being changed uh Romans chapter 7 and I'm just going to read a few verses and then I'll have you be seated let me just uh find just a note here I wanted to make sure brother Joseph did you get that also the uh the power the slide the second slide that I sent if you have that you could just have that ready amen let's just begin reading here let me find my place let's start at verse 14 Romans 7 I've started my timer so uh you guys can Rejoice I've got a little timer here and I usually do it at our home church and they really like it brother Al They I think they said it with me though so they know when I'm out of time so I keep it on silent so they don't know when it goes off and my kids accuse me of hitting the snooze button you know over and over and over but I just tell our church you know when my timer goes off that don't mean I'm done it just means we've stepped into [Laughter] eternity praise the Lord very funny brother Matt verse 14 let's just begin reading here Romans very familiar for we know that the law is spiritual but I how many can say I am carnal sold sold under sin I want you to pay careful attention to Paul's words when you read this it's almost as if you slipped into the Diaries of the Apostle Paul and he's trying to express something that's so hard to express yet so relatable to all those who serve the Lord yeah and he's expressing it something that we could all relate to very much but notice the way he words this for I am carnal sold under sin that means that I'm under the Dominion of sin when I'm born yeah so when you're born you didn't have a choice right you didn't you didn't get to choose but you were actually the Bible says the creature was made subject or slave to vanity that's actually in your carnal nature when you're born doesn't matter who your dad your mom your last name doesn't matter what brandom wouldn't matter you're sold under sin a sin desire is inside of you before you ever got to choose and so you're sold under the Dominion it's your master it's your slave you can you can take that that individual who's born in the world maybe never born in the Christian home and they could be moral they could be good moral people they could uh uh discipline their body in such a way that you'd think my it's a good person and they love animals and they give to the poor but yet if they never meet the Lord Jesus and they know him in the power of his resurrection and their soul all you're doing is reforming the outside but the inside is a slave to sin and so Paul says you're sold slave for I know know this Lotus here in verse 15 for that which I do allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I if I then I do that which I would not I can sit into the law that it is good now then it is no more I that do it notice but sin that dwelleth in me for I know now I want you to watch because this is going to help you I I believe with all my heart my brother and my sister if we could understand Romans 7 and the way that that it was taught correctly by God's Prophet it would not just help you it's one thing to know about the Lord and that's wonderful but sometimes we need to learn about ourself and how did God make me what what do I mean somebody say me me amen now what do we mean when we say me you see it's more simple than just giving your name because that's just an Earthly identity and brother brandham says that maybe there we won't be named John or maybe maybe maybe we we'll be named something else so that's just our Earthly identity in fact your last name doesn't really ident ify who you really are that's just brother brandham said I realized one day I'm not the son of Charles and Ella brandham I'm born of the spirit of God that's my true nature that's my true last name and so when we say me what do we really saying it's more complex because we we when we say me it's more dimensional it's not just the person you see in the mirror but it's actually much deeper than that so notice how the Apostle Paul begins to relate this and he says here in verse uh let me find it here Verse 18 for I know that is that in me notice the parentheses that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will it's present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not how many feel that way I want to serve the Lord I want to always do what right but somehow I don't always do that for the good that I would do not but the he says for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law like gravity it's a law I find then a law that when I would or want to do good or desire to do the right evil is present with me for I now who is he talking about this part for I Delight in the word the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring let me just say this my brother my sister if you feel that there's a war to do right you don't always do right sometimes you do wrong and you're in a battle you should say say thank God that means I've made it because if there's not a war that tells you the devil's still got you for I see there's a war against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and I can say with my hands raised I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin Jesus we just bow heads before you now Lord knowing that already just having read these words we've already received a blessing now God it would be even a greater thing and a Grace for you to take these words that you've given me Lord and may you just break the bread of life to your children may it may it bring strength to the weak Lord may it bring Deliverance to the captives May if we can accomplish one purpose May the enemy be defeated in these young people's lives we ask it in the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ and the church saiden you can be seated brother Bron be is ask this same question in questions and answers and I'm just going to list it here to just before you as you see the question that he asks and and this is uh not not clicking here so you can just Advance it that's okay brother Joseph you can go with me here notice here as brother bham has asked this question about Romans chapter 7 and he says here and if you notice the slide it's actually what you just now read in black but in blue on the bottom is the man's question such a big question so complicated this I cannot understand and it's brother bandam gives us Insight here and he says let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons right one wants me to do brother bam says wrong the other wants me to and he's going to say right and every time I start to do right then the wrong Kinders me how many of you people out in the a interviews this afternoon has run the same thing this morning the same thing so so Paul begins to list this here and I just want to just take a moment just to lay this Foundation can I will you give me the Liberty just to relax yes cuz I'm not relaxed I'm feeling pressured crunched by time so somebody say brother Matt relax relax thank you God bless you appreciate that so I want you to notice because when you read this you can see how that Paul is trying to express this thought and he's trying to he's trying to express but what we all can feel how could I be truly born of the spirit of God I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I have met the Lord Jesus that I have passed from Death un life I've I've obeyed all of the instructions that Peter gave the church repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but I I know brother Matt that I've I've came into contact with with my Creator and I know that I've surrendered my whole life and I I know this that I love the Lord Jesus with all that's within me and I want only what he wants for my life and and I want to shun I don't want to do how many feel that way I don't want to do what's wrong I have a desire to serve the Lord I have a desire to to be like the Lord made me but somehow even knowing that I've experienced that somehow I feel sometimes I can fail the Lord in such a deep way I could I could make mistakes that just don't make even sense to me that how could I knowing that I love the Lord knowing that I passed from Death unto life yet somehow I still have this struggle within me and sometimes brother Matt if I'd be honest I wonder do I really have the goods sometimes I can fail the Lord in such a way I'm not speaking of habitually in a life of sin but sometimes I make mistakes and and I and I question how could I be filled with the spirit and yet have such a battle that rages inside of me how many ever felt that way how many have ever got to the place to where you start to even question do I even have the Holy Ghost have I ever really been born again and and sometimes we the devil he loves to shroud things that are simple with mystery yesen and he loves to complicate and over complicate something that really if you go back to the Bible which is what the message of the hour was to restore us back too to Paul's teaching it's not complicated it's very simple repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you might maybe I might give it to you maybe if you got a good enough track record and I watch it for long enough you know no it's actually much more simple than that you see the problem never exists in the Lord Jesus giving it the problem always goes back to do we repent because repentance is not saying sorry repentance is actually an act action that you make in your heart many people don't like the effects of sin and so they repent of the consequence of sin they hate the alcoholic hates that it ruins his family he hates that he lost his job he hates that he has to now drive a moped because he lost his driver's license he hates that he hates the consequence of sin but there's a very big difference in hating the consequence of sin and hating the sin amen when Jesus comes to the man at the pool of Bethesda and he gives the sob story every time the angel comes to stir the waters I have no man to pick me up and Jesus just cuts to the Chase and says sir will you be made whole I'm not asking you does your back hurt I'm not asking you sick a laying here I'm not asking you because it was sin who put him here that's why Jesus says go and sin no more right but he says I want to know do you thirst for righteousness do you hunger for Holiness you see when a heart is not just hating the effects of sin but you can say Lord I don't want sin I hate sin I assum evil I want the word of God in my life I want the Lord Jesus to be king on my Throne I I Repent of all of myself that's true repentance and that is a vessel that God can fill with the spirit but you notice you say I know that I've came to that brother Matt but still yet how could I if I struggle so much what you need to realize is that there's more to you than what you see in the mirror in fact you're made up of a body a soul and a spirit and within that body we know from from very young age that we have five senses but the prophet then tells us in greatest battle ever fall and he draws it on the board that there's five senses also to the human Spirit there's your memory your conscience reasoning your imagination your affection and all those are part of what make up you but really the prophet says but the real you is that se Gene that Soul down on the inside of God that hungers and thirsts for righteousness and so the job of the devil is to get those and brother bam takes this in future home and he draws it on the board how many remember this and he draws it out on the board how many remember this come on young people tell me we we read the message don't we if you don't I'd encourage you too amen and so notice here it's it's drawn out on the board and and brother bandam draws that snake that that that snake inside of the human heart and he says notice when you're born in the world there's a there's a there's a snake nature there there's a there's a a an enemy that is in control he's the one pulling the levers and pushing the buttons and brother bham says when you're born in the world you're under the Dominion of sin you didn't you couldn't choose that you didn't say I don't want that you know let me just go ahead and and remind you here today young people when you were born you didn't before you were born get to create your own character and say this is what I'll look like and this is how tall I'll be and this is how how much I'll weigh and this will be my eye color anybody do y'all get to do that in New Zealand nobody nobody got to do that you didn't get to you know create your own character like they do in video games and you know I'll be this big and I'll put all my abilities at 99 99 99 some of y'all old people are looking at me weird but these young people know what I'm talking about I I I'll make I'll give myself all the abilities and out you know none of us got to do that you mean you didn't get to choose what complexes you would struggle with in your life you didn't get to choose the makeup and the personality and the nature but actually the way that you were formed brother bam says the great grab bag of life and you just reach in there and grab it and whatever you get is how God ordained you to be he made your temperance he made your mood he made your personality he put you in the home that he put you in he raised you in the with the kind of home you were in the family that you would be raised in your temperament the things you like the things you don't like the things you love and not all of us are created the same not one of us that's that's my God that's my kind of God he's a god of variety he doesn't want us all being in the same kind of person he has flowers that look different trees that look different people with different accents different come on somebody God didn't make us and nor does he want us to all be a match of each other he wants us to serve him and be who he made us to be and so long as you serve God in the way God made you then God can bless you and anoint your life but so long as you're trying to be somebody that you're not God can never bless you and so he made you that way you were born in a certain with a certain bent brother Brandon would deal with this we're going to deal with it here in a moment but when you're born you're born under sin's Dominion now this is not on tape so you can take it or leave it I mean that it's just what I personally I accept it uh because it it just fits with the rest of the teaching of the message but brother bham is telling I think it's brother Sydney Jackson testifies of this and he says that brother Brandon and and and and he gives this example and you you've ever seen I don't have it here but you ever seen that picture of brother Bram and he's behind the pull pit there and there's that orange uh fire that's uh mov moving behind him how many remember that picture and you could you can see that Indian face and that Chief and that signant and those feathers that are coming down and and brother Sydney I believe it's brother Sydney could stand correction but he's with brother bham and brother Bam's explaining that photo and he says you see brother Sydney says that Indian chief that he says that picture that you see that's my old nature and brother bham says you see when a man is Born Into the world that nature sits on the throne of his heart and you may dress him up you may polish him you may try to you know take out all the blemishes but truly that's who's pulling the but the levers and pushing the buttons and he says that old nature dominated me and it dominates because you're under the Dominion of sin and he says that he says I was under the control and he says you see brother Sydney and he says the reason why that that Indian is above me and he points to his own nature he says because when a man is born again he says the Holy Ghost comes in and brother bam he says takes his hands like this and he says the holy ghost that nature on his heart he says the Holy Ghost comes in and the fire of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost pushes that old nature out and the dove the Holy Ghost takes the Throne of the heart and he says and then from that moment on he says the devil is removed from the position of dominion and he's moved to a position of influence and he's not on the throne but he'll always tell you that he is he can't control actually anything in your life he's completely sealed out but he'll get you to believe that you're not born again you never knew the Lord you'll never make it you'll never be enough yet he's just a bluff on the outside trying to deceive you of who you really are but the prophet of God says when you're born of the spirit of God that Dove sits on the throne and he's the one pushing the buttons Hallelujah and he's the one pulling the levers and now you've got to choose to come into the influence of your maker your new nature and resist the devil and he will flee from you and so the battle many times is not whether a person's been born of the spirit of God not saying that's not a battle you see it's the devil's job to take those who have never truly been born again and deceive them into thinking that they're okay because of their last name because of how long they've been in church because of they mentally agreed with the message or mentally agreed with the doctrine and you're and he rocks people to sleep with that and then you know all you got to do is just believe he his job is to take those people make them think as the brother Adam said the disappointment is at judgment brother Adam says the disappointment of judgment will not be the you know he says it he says it will not be the drunkard and the alcohol and the the drug addict he said the disappointment at judgment will be those who thought they were all right and they really weren't yeah right but then brother brandham says in another place he says but I believe on that day you'll see people who you thought would have never made it and they'll be there on that day and so notice this here because because let me just come back to my notes here because the struggle is really you're made up of Body Soul and Spirit and inside of you is a desire a the real you you say brother Matt who is the real me that seed Gene life life of God that that's who you were before the foundation of the world and so brother bandam says you bypassed that you bypass that that that that life and he says but you came into this world not like Jesus but you came into this world to be tested and tried your character molded and that's why the prophet of God says when you heard the word and you recognized that as Eagle food like the mother Eagle crying out and that that Chi that eagle that thought it was a chicken heard the voice of its of its mother brother brandom says when you recognize this message as Eagle food you heard from your theophany hallu praise God and so the struggle in people most of the time is that we think that somehow that when we're born again and we're filled with the Holy Ghost then that's it there's no more battle that's all God wanted to do he just wanted to fill me with this Spirit but what I want to tell you today is that's just the start of your journey you see the Holy Ghost is not content when he takes the throne just to sit on the throne but he now wants to take Dominion of your entire vessel your memory your conscience your reasoning your imagination your affection he wants to change your personality if there's any part of you that doesn't match him his job is to hone you and and and and brother bam says that this way to shave you down you see my brother my sister can I just say to you and this is going to sound like a paradox but I believe with all of my heart what the Bible teaches that the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost changes everything whoever is in Christ is a that's weak come on New Zealand you can do better is a new creation some things are passed away no no that's not what your Bible says all things are passed away behold all things are become new so the true baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about a Reformation I'm talking about a transformation it changes all of you it's a total change to your heart I'm preaching to you on being changed so can I say when the Holy Ghost by the baptism of the Holy Spirit comes in a person's soul it changes everything but hold on let me give you the Paradox it doesn't change everything let's all stand let's close we'll leave it there so the Holy Ghost brother Matt changes everything but it doesn't change everything you say how can you say that brother Matt you see I believe with all of my heart I've been born of the spirit of God but this morning when I woke up I had a headache I thought the holy GH has changed everything you know just a few weeks ago I I I got a little upset when I was driving in my car and someone cut me off I thought I got the Holy Ghost you see the Holy Ghost changes everything as far as the real you you've been translated into the kingdom translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's Dear Son yet there's a part of you that's still here and there's a part of you that has been changed there's a part of you that is being changed and when you recognize that the devil's lies are exposed in your life and let me just stop and say out of necessity you must be being changed you cannot stop you cannot pause you cannot say I've made it it's already over out of necessity the Holy Ghost I just want to stop and make sure you catch this the holy ghost's activity in the born again is to change every part of them in fact one day he will change your [Music] body so you say brother Matt what does he want to change he wants to go into every Avenue every complex every fear every temperament about you that's unlike him in fact he wants the human nature of Jesus Christ to place your nature and I want that I don't know about you I just say Lord I want that in my life I I I believe with all of my heart in Miracles I believe that I want to see more you say brother M have you I've seen cancer healed I've seen blind eyes open I've seen deaf ears even in my own life was was lost my hearing completely when 100% deaf in my right ear told was told by doctors you would never hear again it's impossible no statistic for for recovery and God gave me back Mo a lot quite a bit of my hearing statistically it's impossible I've watched I've watched cancer brain cancer healed I've watched it over and over you say brother Matt do you believe in miracles I believe with all of my heart we serve a supernatural God who can heal the body the mind the soul the spirit the emotions the complexes God Is A Healer of all channels but can I just stop here for a moment and say to you that the greatest miracle that I'm looking for is not necessarily a physical IAL outward fleshly though I love that though I believe there's more of that but the greatest Miracle will be me God taking my nature that is carnal and has attitudes the wrong Spirits the wrong temperament sometimes and the greatest miracle that I say oh God if you could accomplish this one purpose let the nature of My Sacrifice come back on my human nature Lord beauti you love him notice how brother Brandon deals with with this and and just go on a little bit further he says in me is two persons one wants me to do right the other wants me to do he's going to say wrong and brother brandham goes on just go to the next slide we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside I love this inside and that's Fai he says in and that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside somebody say outside we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting obeying believing and accepting and obeying what God Said how can I take a Cocker and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way go to the next Slide the only way it is because the inside of that Cocker bur has been transmitted from a Cocker wheat a Cocker to a germ called wheat life then you bury that Cocker and it will produce a grain of wheat that's right because there's been a life of wheat put in the Cocker the next slide and he says and the life of the Cocker has been taken out notice this but the nature somebody say nature but the nature of the Cocker is still sticky that's right until and he says and it will be until this new life has been fully developed you see that is such an important word until this new life has been fully developed you see brother Matt what are you saying what I'm saying to you is is that you are in the process of this new life being fully developed and don't give up on yourself when the development is still in complete yes Hallelujah when it comes forth then it's no more Cocker but wheat but wheat but while it's here on Earth how many are still here in this Dimension with me good that means you're not Angels nobody out there no Angels no Halos no wings over oh good you mean you're all still here with me we're all still in this earth as long as while it's on Earth out of the earth a Cocker it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of Wheat and as long as go to the next one as long as you're in this life how many still here you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you and if it doesn't bother you that's the problem it's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're bornn again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing that's the thing you say brother Matt when will the battle end when will I finally make it when will I can I finally say it's over I finally cross the line when is the battle and the struggle going to end when you turn 18 yeah that's right amen for the second time hallelujah oh give the Lord a hand clap of Praise I feel you want to do that amen when you turn 18 for the second time and your nature brother bam says then you come forth I love that when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ oh I'm looking forward how many's looking forward to that day when you can look around and you there's nothing in you that's like that old carnal nature that old sin nature but all of it is Christ brother Bron begins to deal with this and he says he talking about an Indian Chief and you know the story very well and he's he's in a prayer line brother Billy Paul's taking request and he comes and this Chief just keeps saying me sick me sick and and they get this man through and he comes through and God heals him and brother Ron begins to refer back to him and he says somebody told me one time he he was converted and received the Holy Ghost you can go to the next one and he says and he said how you getting along this is what he asked the Indian chief he was converted was born again and he says hey chief uh how you getting along and he said pretty good and pretty bad yeah you know if you'd be honest that's how you'd answer that question too how you doing serve the Lord oh praise God but not all the time and he said what do you mean pretty good and pretty bad he said well since me received the Holy Ghost this is the next slide he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them a black dog one of them a white dog and he said they argue all the time they growl and fight one another and he said the white dog wants me to do good and the black dog wants me to do bad said next slide well Chief which one of them wins the fight I love this answer brother Adam says well Chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one Chief feeds the most so I think that's a good answer there just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one I know people love to you know to to put people out and make it so strict and legalistic and if you're born again you don't make mistakes if you're truly born and sealed by the Holy Ghost you never surely could never do that listen friends I'm just going to tell you I don't care what any preacher says what any man says I don't even care what I think this is what a Vindicated Prophet when he answers Romans 7 this is how he answers it amen and questions and answers that it all depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to or the he says I he says you cater to the carnal nature after the things the word or the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it so no notice because there's still something in you called memory conscience reasoning imagination affection and what we realize when we have this the I'm so glad for the light of the message of the hour amen because it reveals to us that even after we're born of the spirit of God even after we're sealed with the Holy Ghost the Seal of promise and yet even still after that there's a part of you that can still grieve the whole Holy Ghost yes that's right exactly because there's memory conscience and inside of there what happens to a person is that they can ingest things in their human spirit that makes them a certain way that's not according to how God made them yeah you can from a child even a young boy a young girl can go through things that that that are terrible and and and even as a as as I could say this and just give you some principles of Life most of your adult life is simply a reaction of your childhood most of your entire you I'm going to be an adult one day and I'm going to have my own home I'm going to have a you know my own family but know this that even though you have a family you pack over within that family within that marriage oh we're one and I believe that with all my heart you you like that Unity candle and there's the man and there's the woman and there's the Holy Ghost and there there's the there's the you know the Lord Jesus but when you marry those two people together you're not just marrying your first name and she takes your last name and then you H you have your names but actually you're unifying all of the baggage all of the complexes all of the raising all of the issues all of the struggles and if you never clean those channels out they have the potential to be a ticking time bomb in your union and one day yeah you say I thought they were born again thought they were filled with the Holy Ghost they might have been but because they never cleaned out the channels of memory conscience reason and Imagination in fact God Satan can get you to such a place by using the way you were made see he has no approach to your soul he's sealed out so what he will do is he can listen friends I realized a long time ago that devil cannot change my eternal destination it's already been set sealed signed and delivered and one day my body will receive what my soul already got a long time ago and so because Satan cannot change my eternal destination he will do everything he can to roin my life here on this side of Eternity and rob me of my joy rob me of my smile rob me of my happiness rob me of my Hope come on preach with me somebody is is this not the enemy that you face too here he will do everything he can to compl Lex you to make you different than the way God made you make you angry temperamental toxic hateful bitterness malice Envy Strife jealousy the devil can't change your Eternal home so he'll make your home here hell on Earth but today we're here to expose him and so notice this here because within that the person can inest it's just like Co you know Corona virus and I'm just going to speak for our our country because I wasn't here and and every country dealt with it a little bit different and I'm not here to get on a a a p a soap box here about it but I just want to point something out because so many people you know that was a real thing that really affected a lot of people's lives there a lot of people even people in our assembly who passed away from it people even today in our assembly who are struggling with the effects years after in their lungs and respiratory things that was a very real so I'm not belittling that at all not not not not minimizing in that but you need to recognize something that the prophet of God told us that all sickness and all disease is just an outward external manifestation of a life a demon which is a life a being that exists and it's a spirit that comes upon people that's why when Jesus prayed for the deaf man in Mark chapter n he didn't say disease or name it what science named it he says Thou deaf Spirit come out of the man and don't enter him again it was a life living off the life of that person and so if we believe in physical sickness that a person can get a tumor and that tumor is just the body it's not the doctors can do all they can but brother bam says but you need to identify in demonology that's not tumor they give it a name tuberculosis and cancer but it's a spirit that's living on that person and so if there's physical disease how much more is there spiritual disease and many times we could have churches where everybody dress code looks good makeup no makeup hair is long boys aren't wearing shorts no smoker no cigarettes and everything on the outside looks healthy but on the inside there's spiritual disease everywhere CU we live in that kind of a culture to where everybody wants the image and as long as I look like a Believer then everything's all right but do you know God actually says you look on the outward but I don't I'll actually look at the heart I'm the one who looks on the ins side of the person doesn't matter Holiness outward Holiness is a good thing but it won't get you in the Rapture only inward Holiness of the heart the true nature will get you in the Rapture and so sometimes we live with spiritual diseases in our own self and we're healthy on the outside but on the inside we're a mess true and so so so that person can take a complex in their spirit and and let me just come back to close this loop on Co many people who never never got sick from the disease yet they ingested the fear and pandemonium in their human spirit and today they live with the effects of that spirit because it's a very real thing and you can be bound not in your soul but Satan can bind you with a yoke you say brother Matt how can you say that those that are born of the spirit of God can be bound why does the Apostle Paul say be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage wherewith Christ has set you free beautiful brother brother Paul says in another place you forgotten who you were that you were purged you you you were you were freed of your sin you were you were you were made into the image of Christ you did run well what did hinder you so there's things we're preaching to you today on being changed you love him amen did you know you say brother Mattis if I'm born of the of God if I'm truly sealed then how much access does Satan have to me I'm going to give you a very simple answer as much as you give him that's right think about that for a moment brother Bon says did you know next slide a devil is almost almost not completely but he's almost harmless a devil demon big scary thing but a devil is actually almost harmless unless he can have something a medium some portal some way some access you say how did I give him access through a complex that you never took under the the that never surrendered that vain imagination to br br as Paul says bring every thought captive to the power of the Holy Ghost but because people don't bring those thoughts captive you know what a complex is brother Bram says just think the wrong way and then keep thinking that way and keep thinking that way and you feed that complex and you build that complex you're born again you're sealed by the Holy Ghost but you're seeing everything through yented glasses through that complex so he's almost powerless unless he has something to work and you remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion brother ROM says what they they wanted to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go into the hog so Devils must have something to work in notice this word somebody yeah somebody what we recognize is that sometimes Satan will use friends or relationships or boys or girls or social groups and he will use the things that are physical to give someone as brother bam says no devil is almost devil is almost harmless unless you have somebody to work in and he will begin to by well a second hand he would begin to afflict you and and destroy you and if he could he'd annihilate you let me just go ahead and tell you right now the devil doesn't just want to hurt you he wants to kill you amen know that about your enemy can I just wake you up to your enemy today he's not just interested in just hurting your feelings he wants to annihilate you true he wants to completely wipe you out amen and and brother ad is almost completely harmless and Satan can only his power he got the perverted power to think Satan has got is something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today we are today thank you brother sitting here one or the other power is going to control us one or the other so let's cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens that's our choice as we Pro preached on last night inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imagination conscious memory reason infection inection that's the thing that controls the soul so then what does that from the middle of the heart which is the soul from There Goes Forth notice these words feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that come down that Channel with the true word of God then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts as the inside Satan's approach is from the friends God God's prophet's given you weapons he's giv you strategy how to fight your enemy and there's only one Avenue that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency coming of the Soul by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart believe what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said you get it there you are there's the Battleground there's the Battleground I'm going to move through some of this because I believe you're I just want to get to somewhere before we just run ourselves out of time I got 15 minutes left somebody say praise the Lord somebody say preach brother mat so notice this here brother Adam says here in in and just slide 18 brother if you could display it did you ever see a good grain of corn planted in the ground did you ever see that and let a stick fall over it notice it'll grow crooked this is what happens to so many people when a complex comes over your life right it'll grow crooked any Vine anything that grows up well because something has hindered it now brother Brandon I'm going to take a turn here just for a moment with what little bit of time that we have left he says if you went into a doctor's office this is slide 19 and told him you were sick told him your symptoms he was and if he was in a hurry to probably give you a little prescription with some anesthetic some sort of aspirin the doctor is merely trying to get rid of you just at that time because he hasn't have time he doesn't have time but a real good doctor before he gives you the medicine would diagnose the case you see this is what we're doing when we just tell people just get the Holy Ghost yeah exactly right just get get born now I I'm not I'm not disparaging that because there's a truth in that like with everything I'm only saying that when we just think that all a person has to do is just get the Holy Ghost and now I do believe that the work of the Holy Ghost is all you need but you've got to let this mind which was in Christ Jesus also be in you you've got to add to your faith and The Virtue and the knowledge and The Temper you've got to do these things this is the work of the Holy Ghost after you're bornn of the spirit of God he is changing you and many times brother params notice how he says this he says many times and he says we find people slide the next slide 20 going through these prayer lines across the nation they just run up and think the Lord ought to heal them right then but there's something maybe down in there we set before the Lord until he reveals it that's what it is there is something notice I want you to remember this young people write this in bold in your mind put it in neon there's a reason for everything there's a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason first and then you can find what to work on now I want to be careful here here because unless I put you on some rabbit chase you know trying to find what's my problem what's I got to go to psychologist and I got to go to this and I got to get this now listen friends that's empty can I just tell you that it's empty it's empty It ultimately leads you to just more one question leads to another question there's only one Healer and that healer's name is Jesus and if you could just find him that's all that matters and we don't need to come up you know we don't you don't need to come and and let you know have some gift of discernment discern your heart and tell you everything's wrong with you you say brother the M what do I need all you need is for the whole ho ghost by the preaching of the word to expose the devil and once he's exposed say out of me Satan and you have no place in my mind you have no place in my spirit all he needs is to be exposed that's all you're going to find that here in a moment questions and answers brother Bram says I found someone no excuse me on the interview this morning and he says I guess there's still the absolute he says I guess they're still in the building and brother BR is referring to this person and he says about speaking with tongues now brother B if you go and study this he spends the whole morning this is questions and answers he spends the entire previous service the night before and he and he's and he's talking how preaching how that speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost he teaches to entire sermon and then he comes to this person you could think it's it's what you know it's what is he doing here but notice a prophet and he says I I I suppose they're still in the building and he says about speaking with tongues that person is a genuine person a real person they've lived it right and I and they've heard me say the evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues now hold on pause pause that for a minute look this way don't Don't cheat and read ahead this person has a question that so many of us can have in our own life she was asking have I truly been born again anybody ever asked that do I really have the Holy Ghost and and and and brother brandham the way he's going to answer this he takes that woman who's questioning that now brother brandom identifies and I believe what he's doing is identifying she has been born again she's truly has the good she's lived a right life and you say then what's brother bram's answer going to be because she's asking about I I I believe I've been born again but I've never spoken in tongues you know how brother bham and how you take this or leave it I happen to take it cuz I believe all that the prophets have spoken and in 1964 this is the way brother bandam answers this he talks to the woman about speaking in tongues and he doesn't say sister how carnal how immature are you come on aren't we past that just believe you accept the message just believe how dare you how immature how he never Bel us her at all in fact brother Bram tells this sister go ahead brother and he says about speaking a tongue the person is a genuine person real person they Liv right they've heard me say the evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in Tong and it isn't but I advise that person here's the advice of a prophet to ask God to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy oh don't brother Matt you see what brother brandham looked at was he knew the nature of the person and one may be able to accept it by faith but the devil was using this to plague her in her mind and so brother brandham says I know that the nature she is she needs something she can put her faith upon right amen and he says I asked her told her to ask God to let her speak in tongues or prophesy because it's the nature the first thing I did I went and found their birthplace what sign they were born under and could tell what their birth was notice which way it set them in their natural you see my brother my sister we are all different none of us are the same so we can't make a one siiz spits all for everybody what worked for brother Brandon when he said I was born again by the spirit of God it felt like water was pouring down on my back that may not that doesn't mean for us to go look for that same sensation away with Sensations brother brand says experiences it doesn't mean to say we don't need an experience we don't need sometimes someone needs something they can put their faith upon and I'm here to tell you if that's what you want Jesus is willing to give it to you but for others can accept it by faith and just some cry some don't some shout some don't yeah none of us are the same yeah but here's one thing that you can base your faith upon whatever it is it will bring a change a total toal transformation to your life when brother BR is dealing with that man was questioning that plagued with that question and he and he he says have I have I not and brother brandham says he tells he comes to brother brandham and is just exhausted oh I've been trying to find you he says I've struggled with this question in my mind do I really have the Holy Ghost and he says brother Brandon says tell me your let me tell you my story and and you know the story very well is a car salesman and he says and and he says and one day a man came over dropped off a track back and it says where will you spend eternity and brother BR he says brother Bram I I read that and I begin to weep and weep and it just plagued me God in my mind he says ever since that day brother bandam you know the man just he begins to pray and talk to the Lord and begins and begins uh you know just really survey in his own life and he begins to seek the holy ghost from that moment and he says and he says brother Brandon he says from that time he says I went to the Nazarene and they told me just get happy enough and you'll begin to think it was the Nazarene and begin to laugh he says so I begin to laugh and he says now you got it but I didn't he says that question was still plaguing me so I went to the assembly the fundamental Baptist just recite this Creed and you know can say the sinner's prayer and it sounded good he says but I I still was bothered with this question do I have the Holy Ghost so I went to the Pentecostals they told me to speak in tongues going from group to group to group to group Camp to Camp lot of like like a lot of people camp to Camp to Camp to Camp to Camp looking for something that's already here yeah right and brother says and he says and now he says and I don't know what to do I'm going to lose my mind he says now I come to you I don't know what to do I'm still bothered by this question and brother bam says sir can I ask you a question and he says and he says you told me that when you picked up that piece of paper and looked at that track and the way brother brandom says it you'd have to go back to the tape to find I'm just paraphrasing and he says that your whole life changed from that moment he says yes that's right brother bandam and he says brother I'm here to tell you you received the Holy Ghost right there and all of this has been a work of the Holy Ghost in your life you know what that man did Brother B said he jumped and screamed and said do you mean I've had it this whole timej Hallelujah so so many times we look for something and the evidence of something we place on some emotion and if we don't do that then we place it on as long as we believe or I just believe God sent a prophet and friends it's neither one of those things you say what is the true evidence of the Holy Ghost that brother bandam says you might speak in tongues you might not here's one thing you will do your life will come subject to the word of God are you here is this good you appreciate what the Lord has and he says I went to their nature certain line with they he says they were borned over and he says the and let's just go over this I'm just uh just look at my time now and he says it's been one of the most amazing things slide 23 that I have noticed along the lines of my Ministry for our lord Jesus is the peculiarity of people it is truly Brother brandom people are very peculiar it's been the most amazing thing and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that the person can study to watch the nature of people and the different parts of the Nations and worlds to where you go you'll notice there's a different there's a different attitude that people take towards Christ towards his service and towards his servants and towards I love that he included this worship and one of the things that has been one he says and one of the things that's been that one type of meeting will just be wonderful in one part of the country where it won't work in the other part of the country so you mean that we're not all to be the same you mean that when we see another country and another meeting and they're are they're rejoicing in a certain way and we criticize that that maybe that is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and the problem is is not with them but it's yeah's up I ain't got no pull pit to hide behind y'all can still hit me with stuff from down here you mean sometimes the critical spirits that we have the way that the Holy Ghost moves in each one sometimes friends I just I'm afraid we become so political we're no different than the you know you don't have it here but the Democrats and the Republicans we're no different are we the body of Christ or are we not listen my absolute is not your experience and you my experience better not be your absolute because the way God made me is maybe not how he made you yes amen and the way God natured you is not how he natured me and my struggles are not your struggles and your struggles you should thank God or not brother Matt's struggles and the your battles that you have to face I could never fight your battle cuz God didn't make me to fight your battle and I you can never fight mine cuz so don't criticize me I won't criticize besides you I just got one thing to say fight your enemy with your slingshot that God gave you and so long as you put faith in your promise and and the absolute that we have here is not a church it's not an example of a brother a certain Minister thank God for all of them thank God for all types of ministry I love them all you know me I'm not a I I'm more of a Preacher I love to shout and scream it's how God made me I love to dance and to shout that's how God made me that doesn't mean that's how God made you and that's can I just say that's okay just be who you are be who God Made You And as brother Ram says then we'll score the touchdown and then we can all go home but so long as we're trying one to match the other and match the other we've got one absolute I love how my good uh friend of mine uh said it in his sermon he says you know the powerful thing about a you know instruments he says what would happen if I tried to tune the base to the acoustic it may sound good at first but then you say now that you've tuned the base to the acoustic now tune the organ to the base and now that you tuned the organ to the base now tune the piano to the organ and then tune the violin to the you know and you just go on you say it's going to be it's going to be close but there's going to be variations in Pitch variations in harmony so you know how to fix that and that's the way a lot of people are they try to tune their experience to another church another preacher another Camp another way but what you say brother mat how we going to fix this God gave us a tuning fork called the word of God and so long as we match our experience oh as long as my experiences matches my Bible then that's all that matters it doesn't matter we may be a little different make a little different sound but under God's under God's uh canopy we're all making music and Melody one with another in the spirit of God you love him notice this can I just have oh my timer just went off can we go into overtime brother Al like 10 minutes is that all right is that okay he's smiling but he's not saying okay so so notice this here brother Brandon begins to deal with a sister I'm just going to read some of these we'll close excuse me sister have to relax my mind slide 25 now will be strangers I see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're you're from away from here you come from another city you got a lot of trouble this is the condition of a lot of people you got a lot of trouble now he's not talking he's going to identify a physical heart problem but he's talking about a spiritual problem you got a lot of trouble on your heart I wonder if we got that today wonder if we've got some who look good talk good speak right say the right things but if the Holy Spirit was to discern us there's a lot of trouble yes that's true he says you got a lot of trouble and you got heart trouble to begin with is that right you could hear her 20th century Prophet you could watch it and she begins to weep and he says you got heart trouble to begin with there's a whole lot of Blackness now he's seeing something that's real but maybe she never seen it and he says you got a whole lot of Blackness I see a black sheet keep following you like that now this sister had no clue she's raising children maybe going to church she knows there's trouble but she doesn't see that in another dimension there's a black sheet that follows her to work follows her at home follows her to the grocery follows her to school follows her to church and every time she wants to get Victory then that black Sheet's following her influences her life and it's a lot of trouble and brother Rams looks at it that way he says it's following you oh it's a lie somebody told a lie on you now isn't it amazing the lie was not true it's a lie but somehow she ingested that and by ingesting that this sister now has a black sheet that's following her life that's so good and he says it's a lie somebody told a lie on you and that was a man professing Divine Healing is that right yes sir he said you was a witch yes is that true and you got a whole stir in your church or something another about it isn't that right your pastor sick right now has got polio isn't that right yes sir sister now this is what's so powerful he doesn't sit her down take hours with her pray some kind of a prayer lay his hands upon her shake her doesn't do anything that he doesn't open up a psychology book he doesn't send her for help to a doctor he simply exposes the devil and I want you young people to understand you don't need some super fantastic thing all you need is to expose the devil and believe the word by faith not saying that that that you can't have wonderful things I've been delivered of things and it was through a prayer line because I believe in prayer lines I believe that the Bible teaches that brother brandham taught that I believe in the laying of hands on the sick and they shall recover and I've watched God use Ministries and people can sometimes have faith as brother brandham says that Gentile Faith was to dis believe the word but brother mam says it this way he says God will meet you at any level of Faith you have he'll condense in aren't you glad for that kind of a God if you need hands laid upon you that's wonderful that's our right no one's here to criticize you for that nor is the Lord Jesus sometimes you need something physical to change something spiritual but brother vom says all he does here is just in a prayer line he exposes the devil and he says sister I love this and he says don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're lying and the only thing wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got you worked up go home in ple peace and God bless you you're all right God bless you you're not a witch you can hear that sister as she set free from that dark shadow strangely brother bam says in the next slide he cares do you care I went to a place where I made an odd turn instead of turning around there I went to make a turn the lights flashed on a lovely couple two young fine ladies he says two young fine young ladies that I had just he's talking about two young a minister two brothers and two sisters and he says and Satan after he's seen that Minister one of them in his ministry being said he took a life's companion right here at this altar they went away happy on their honeymoon and the enemy jumped on this young man and I'm saying this to express what I'm saying does he care somehow with faith that wouldn't take no for an answer would a faith that would not take no they turned and return back knowing after they was all the way over way in the East here somewhere on their honeymoon returned back was sitting waiting I walked in find handsome young man wife sitting on the outside crying her little companion on the other man other man uh the other brother come running which is a friend of this young man saying oh brother brandom such and such happened and went there and seen this went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life a leader of young men sitting there and Satan bound him he never noticed but I took my left hand to shake with his right hand to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting waiting upon the Lord I love this the anointing of the Holy Spirit was there and that's why it led us and then seeing this there it is again Shadow this dark shadow of Darkness over him I never said what I was doing but in less than a couple minutes moments time it was all gone and the coldness of his hand had left he was shouting and praising God a few minutes to find himself hallelujah oh I wonder if there'd be anybody here at this Youth Camp that would say Lord give me just a few minutes in your presence to find myself to cut through all the voices of the lies of the enemy let me come back to who you really say that I am yes Lord and here they sit in the mo this morning sitting in the audience see how Satan was trying to upset that young man by referring himm of some complex to be built back which the Holy Spirit knew I seen it by Vision but God cared for that man God cared for that young boy he goes in another place just at as I close here coming a few moments I seen lady he says a lady I seen her sitting on the aisle with just got her seat some way and sat down she said nine years brother bandam I I I tried to get a hold of you I'm so desperate here late I couldn't even get a prayer card to be in the line the lady moved back said brother Bram just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman and see that her heart was burdened she was trying to make a living a great a great notice a great thing happened way back remember your adult life is just a reaction of your childhood that's right something way back in the time of her parents that had caused this great thing to happen to her and the Lord Jesus revealed it and it showed what it was and there in a day in a month and 10 years and five Services no there in a moment's time moment's time you don't need a long big buildup it can happen right now in a moment's time took it from the woman she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us REO him with tears she's wiping her eyes now knowing the truth of the thing was made known and that what little poor little neurotic woman that was so nervous she didn't know what was do to do with herself thinking that she was gone and there was no Holy Spirit and this is her last day wonder if that's the LIE the devil has told you sitting here thinking you're gone this is the last time wonder if you'd bow your heads with me here today as we close thinking that she was God and there was no Holy Spirit and that this is her last day thought she had send her day of Grace away thought she had failed and her failure was Final and it was the end she she tried for n years and she was about at the end of Des spair but God cared for that little woman who no one else cared for oh he does care when he was on Earth he cared for people so much brother and sister don't ever let the devil tell you God doesn't care he cared so much for people he healed their sick he comforted their hearts told them about a place he was going to go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them he cared so much and he knew he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us that he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I will send the Holy Ghost I will send the Holy Spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns oh there's no one cares like Jesus listen young lady there's no one care for you like the Lord Jesus young man there's no one that'll care for you like the Lord give him your problems today I wonder if you would under the preaching of this word even right now will just raise a hand and say Lord I release it I give it I release it right now if there's some spirit that I've taken and ingested in my human Spirit my memory conscience reasoning imagination affection and I've allowed it to build a stronghold in my life and given access to the devil maybe it's turned into a critical spirit maybe it's turning into jealousy maybe it's turning into malice maybe it's turning into lust doesn't really matter they're all just demon spirits but right now you just say God I want to be free I want to be free I want to be clean I want to be pure in my heart I want to serve you with undefiled thoughts undefiled Lord all my motives undefiled my objectives undefiled I want to serve you in the beauty of Holiness oh God bless those hands up everywhere Lord Jesus I just raise my hands now with every life that's here under the sound of my voice God I wanted to say by an uplifted hand I want to be changed oh god oh I invite every person under this building just to ask that young young old God I want to be changed I want to be different Lord that's a I'm going to make it simple I'm not going to make it complicated I just want to say Lord I want to be different I want to be changed I want it all to be different I want all of me to be gone and the only thing that remains is a fire that's so bright that the whole world can see that there's something different about me there's something changed from the inside I I just want to ask you oh stand to your feet young person with those hands raised and say God I just want to ask you would you come and make it different in my life come and change me from the inside to the outside I know that if I could ever get my inside right my outside I wouldn't have to worry about it Lord I don't want to be stuck in a rut I don't want to be stuck in just a pattern of doing the same things over and over and over I want to be different Lord Jesus want it to be different be changed from the inward part of my being oh my brother I would invite you to pray that prayer right now I'd invite you just to cry out to the Lord for right there at your seat right at your seat sister whatever it is give it to the Lord Jesus right now can we just take a moment to do that just give it to the Lord give it to him give him all of yourself give him all of your questions give him all of your fears give him all of your worry give him all of your anxiety give it give it all he cares there's no one cares like the Lord Jesus he can change you from the gutter most to the U from the uttermost God can lift you out of the Miry clay take you out of the pit of despair take you out of the pit of confusion and you may have lived oh I just feel the inspiration of the Holy Ghost right now to say it you might have lived with that spirit for years of your life but today Jesus cared just enough to come and minister to you your need and say no more Satan no more in his life I'm going to expose the devil and From This Moment On he'll be free he'll live free get your tentacles off of God's Property take your hands off of God's Property Satan the preaching of the word drives back demon spirits and we've got people we've got angels in this building looking to energize your faith oh give it to him young person give it to him young man give it to him sister the Lord can deliver you right now of years of complexes years of trouble over your heart you don't have to live with that anymore the Lord Jesus cares oh thank you Jesus oh could we raise our hands and just say thank you thank you Jesus from a grateful heart from uplifted hands outstretched hands oh it's the least I could do for what you've done for me Lord thank you Lord God for your word thank you for making it so clear to me thank you for exposing the enemy in my life I just want to say with my hands raised Lord I want you and I want you only and I'm sorry that I failed you Lord forgive me for all of my shortcomings forgive me of all of my weaknesses forgive me of the Frailty of my mind and sometimes maybe I've doubted you Lord would you forgive me for any time I've doubted your promise will you forgive me Lord for any time I've questioned your word or tried to you may Lord it maybe didn't always make sense but today will you forgive me Lord I just want to come to you I want to trust you with all of my heart I don't want to lean to my own understanding anymore I don't want to try to figure it out I'm done

Redemption he's my brother he's my sister he's closer than a father closer than a mother thank you Lord thank you maybe just of the piano player just Only the Piano Player could come at this time amen let's just keep this atmosphere that we feel right now it's special right now Lord has just moved in here in such a special way oh I'm thankful to the Lord Jesus thankful for what you've done Lord thankful for what you're doing thankful God that I can be changed from this creature who I was I can change Lord God I have the ability to as we preached last night I have the option to make a choice and the choice is not someone else is to make it is mine I choose it Lord I choose to believe your word and what it says in spite of what I feel in spite of what I think I choose it Lord oh do you choose it today young people you choose his way choose his [Music] life I just want to say God as the song is being played change my heart oh God make it ever true that's my prayer that's my desire

heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you amen I wonder if the other musicians can also come up this is a fundamental fundamentally important uh service and I and I trust that each one took a real hold of that you know many times and and as a pastor I find that the question that's that is plaguing people is do I have the Holy Ghost and if I do why do I still struggle and and it is so important the things that our brothers share today amen that it is that that this flesh is is supposed to be subject to the Holy Spirit that's in our soul but it's a battle and the battle will continue until the day we die and when you when you in this battle like a brother said that's the best sign that the life that's in your heart the holy spirit is fighting the the weaknesses in this flesh so that's why you're in a battle and and and our brother said if if that battle is not happening then then you have reason to con to be concerned because then then there's still that serpent nature in the heart right but thank God for these things thank the Lord for this teaching we would highly recommend you to go back to Hebrews 7 and read that again with the things that our brother has has shared and and may the Lord just give you that that something to hold on to this morning amen that that there's something that has changed amen i' just like to encourage you
