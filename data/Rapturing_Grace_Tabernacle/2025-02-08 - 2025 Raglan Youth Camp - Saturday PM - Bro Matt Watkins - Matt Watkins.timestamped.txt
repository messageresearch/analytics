[40:37] sister Deborah if you could come and
[40:38] make your way I just have a special I'd
[40:40] like her to sing she be playing the
[40:42] piano thank you God bless you have you
[40:44] enjoyed your time here at Camp amen how
[40:46] many have received a blessing something
[40:48] from the Lord already how many still say
[40:50] Lord I still got a cup that's empty I've
[40:52] received something this morning but I
[40:54] want to say Lord I've got an empty cup
[40:56] and I want you to fill it up how many
[40:58] say that Lord here's my need you know I
[41:01] believe that's important we did it the
[41:02] first night I wonder if we'd do that
[41:04] again just to say Lord I'm going to
[41:06] represent my need by an uplifted hand
[41:08] why don't you do that right now just
[41:10] raise it up to the Lord say God this is
[41:12] my hand representing my specific need
[41:15] you know sometimes you need to be
[41:16] specific with the Lord tell him what's
[41:18] on your heart brother Al did uh was did
[41:21] such an awesome job this morning with
[41:23] those questions and showed how that even
[41:26] God knowing the will yet we still have
[41:28] to
[41:29] ask think of when Jesus is saying that
[41:33] the laborers the Harvest is plenty
[41:36] remember that and he says but the
[41:39] laborers are few and then here's Jesus
[41:42] and he says so ask the lord of the
[41:45] Harvest and he is the lord of the
[41:47] Harvest and he says so ask the lord of
[41:49] the Harvest to send laborers what is it
[41:51] it's showing the relationship that
[41:53] brother brandham said that many times we
[41:55] don't have things from the holy holy
[41:57] spirit because we don't ask for them and
[42:00] so the even in the Book of Mark chapter
[42:02] 3 it says that Jesus had not done many
[42:04] miracles at that point because they had
[42:06] not asked him to so if all he's doing is
[42:08] waiting for us to ask then I think we
[42:10] ought to ask like the Bible says that

[47:27] Ephesians chapter 6 if you have your
[47:29] Bible we'll just turn there Ephesians
[47:32] chapter 6 and we'll just begin reading
[47:34] verse 10 real familiar
[47:38] scripture
[47:41] amen praise the Lord
[47:59] amen I would just like to take this last
[48:01] service and the Lord before I came here
[48:05] to New Zealand uh the Lord showed me I
[48:08] would preach this it's the only service
[48:10] that I was sure about on what I would
[48:12] speak and when I would speak it would be
[48:14] here tonight so I believe the Lord does
[48:16] that not always sometimes he leads you
[48:18] and you just have to trust him entirely
[48:20] and just go with the best uh way that
[48:23] you know as a minister but other times
[48:25] the Lord just quickens something it
[48:27] makes it so real and I believe when he
[48:29] does that God's got a real specific
[48:31] purpose in mind so I wonder if maybe you
[48:34] just would say by an uplifted hand Lord
[48:36] Make My Heart sensitive to what your
[48:39] voice wants to speak to me tonight amen
[48:41] God bless those hands that are up why
[48:44] don't we just go before him here B
[48:46] before we read our scripture we'll pray
[48:48] I wonder if You' just put your hand over
[48:50] on that one if it's appropriate there
[48:52] beside you boy to boy girl to girl let's
[48:54] just bind our hearts together and faith
[48:56] brother brandham said when you touch
[48:58] with your hands another believer that
[49:00] light leaves your body goes into them
[49:03] and light leaves their body goes into
[49:04] yours and we unify our faith all one
[49:07] together and the enemy if he could
[49:09] accomplish anything it would be to try
[49:11] to prevent what the Lord wants to do so
[49:14] why don't we just bind him by faith here
[49:16] tonight and let the Holy Spirit just
[49:18] have his way from the pull pit all the
[49:20] way to the back door Lord Jesus father
[49:24] we are your children Lord you're the one
[49:27] who placed a desire to serve you in our
[49:30] heart Lord you said no man has has
[49:33] sought me but I've sought you no man
[49:36] comes to the father unless he's drawn so
[49:39] God this is your word this is your
[49:42] people and this is your promise Lord but
[49:45] we just want to identify ourselves
[49:47] tonight that we are believers we believe
[49:50] it with all that is within us God I pray
[49:54] Lord Jesus that you would bind every
[49:56] evil Spirit Lord that would try to
[49:58] prevent or hinder the moving of your
[50:00] spirit tonight we know Lord God that
[50:03] there's nothing greater nothing greater
[50:06] father no gift that's greater Lord than
[50:08] the preaching of the word of God that
[50:10] could go forth and discern even greater
[50:13] than the gift of a prophet and
[50:15] discernment that would discern what
[50:17] disease we have or what sickness we have
[50:19] Lord but the word the Bible says is is a
[50:22] discerner of the thoughts and the
[50:23] intents of the heart dividing us under
[50:26] both B Soul and Spirit so I pray God
[50:28] that you would come with a word that
[50:30] would discern our heart Lord father and
[50:33] may when we hear that word may we not
[50:35] just be apathetic to it Lord not just an
[50:38] observer or a spectator tonight Lord but
[50:42] may we hear recognize and act upon the
[50:44] word of God each one of us Lord are
[50:47] responsible only for ourself and the
[50:49] response that we have father I pray that
[50:52] you would find a heart a a fertile
[50:54] bedding ground for your word to take
[50:56] root I pray God that you would Deliver
[50:59] Us From Any evil Lord I pray God that
[51:01] your angels would encamp about us now
[51:03] tonight Lord May the word go forth in
[51:06] power and demonstration Lord father I
[51:09] pray that you would speak to us in a
[51:11] special way Grant it Lord bless this
[51:13] Camp bless brother alr's Church his
[51:15] family God for putting this on and may
[51:18] above all else may you receive Glory and
[51:20] Honor all of it Lord for it's only due
[51:23] to you we thank you for it now in the
[51:26] name name of the Lord Jesus
[51:28] Christ amen amen Ephesians chapter 6 I'm
[51:32] going to minister to you something here
[51:34] tonight that is uh in some ways will be
[51:38] a little difficult on me to preach as I
[51:40] even just preparing for it there before
[51:42] I came out here just fell under the
[51:44] weight of the sermon here tonight as we
[51:48] recently just in our family lost a a
[51:50] dear loved one a young man 28 years old
[51:54] and uh he he was a wonderful young man
[51:57] we didn't lose him I shouldn't use that
[51:59] word because he's our Eternal treasure
[52:01] now but the devil just uh got a foothold
[52:04] in his life and and um just watched uh
[52:10] just watched a life that was so precious
[52:12] that uh just uh much like the the the um
[52:17] the story of the man Legion in the Bible
[52:20] who who the Bible speaks about that he
[52:22] had just a a legion of demons and you
[52:25] know brother brandham when he he talks
[52:26] about Legion he said it it started maybe
[52:29] with his temper maybe just something
[52:31] maybe a lie he says in another place
[52:33] that he told and you say how could a man
[52:36] get 2,000 demons How could a person end
[52:39] up like that one at a
[52:41] time and and but what's so powerful
[52:44] about that story is me and a brother was
[52:46] fellowshipping this afternoon on it is
[52:48] it's amazing because we got to be
[52:50] careful how we tell that story because
[52:53] Legion was not his name
[52:56] actually Legion was just the name of the
[52:59] demons that he had upon him and many
[53:01] times when you look at a person and
[53:02] they're addicted or they're they're a
[53:04] drug addict or they're an alcoholic a
[53:06] lot of times we can if we're not careful
[53:08] we can tend to identify them with that
[53:11] Spirit but just always remember they are
[53:14] not that Spirit who Legion was was a Son
[53:17] of God a man of God a husband had
[53:19] children he was a family man but the
[53:22] devil had got a stronghold in his life
[53:24] but when he found the Lord Jesus the the
[53:26] Bible says he came back to
[53:28] himself and so I I just want to say here
[53:31] tonight that this is very real to me
[53:34] what I'm going to preach here tonight is
[53:36] uh very real if I'm extra passionate you
[53:39] just uh give me Grace here tonight
[53:41] because it it means a lot to me it comes
[53:43] from the bottom of my heart Ephesians
[53:46] chapter 6 I'm going to speak to you here
[53:48] tonight on influenced by Angels
[53:52] influenced by
[53:55] angels finally my brethren be strong in
[53:58] the Lord and in the power of His might
[54:02] put on the whole armor of God that you
[54:05] may be able to stand against the Ws of
[54:08] the devil for we wrestle not against
[54:12] flesh and blood but against
[54:15] principalities against Powers against
[54:18] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[54:21] against spiritual wickedness in high
[54:24] places now that word high is not in the
[54:26] sense of altitude but it's actually the
[54:29] the Greek word there is for atmospheres
[54:31] so we wrestle against it's not that we
[54:33] don't battle the first thing you must
[54:36] realize as a Christian is that you are
[54:38] in a war for your life and you've got a
[54:41] real enemy who if he could would destroy
[54:43] you tonight if he could brother bham
[54:46] said he would take your life like that
[54:48] but there's a protection upon the life
[54:49] of a Believer and and brother bandam
[54:52] said that Satan can't touch a hair on
[54:54] your head until he gets Mission from
[54:57] your father in Heaven and so notice it's
[55:00] a battle it's a real struggle a real a
[55:02] real war that we're in and he says it's
[55:04] in high places or other atmospheres
[55:07] verse 13 wherefore take unto you the
[55:09] whole armor that you may be able to
[55:11] stand in the evil day how many young
[55:13] people can just say we're in the evil
[55:15] day and having done all to stand stand
[55:19] therefore having your loins gir about
[55:21] with truth and having on the breastplate
[55:24] of righteousness your feet Shaw with
[55:26] with the preparation of the gospel of
[55:28] peace above all taking the shield of
[55:30] Faith wherewith you shall be able to
[55:31] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[55:34] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[55:36] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[55:38] God praying always yes prayer is a part
[55:40] of your army your armor it's it's a part
[55:43] of the armor friends not just praying
[55:45] you know uh you know just while you're
[55:47] eating your food or before you go to bed
[55:49] but the Bible says pray and
[55:51] always with all prayer and supplication
[55:55] and the spirit walk watching there unto
[55:57] with all perseverance and supplication
[56:00] for All Saints Lord Jesus we just bow
[56:03] our heads before you God recognizing
[56:07] this Divine appointment Lord that you
[56:09] made father and I'm so
[56:11] grateful Lord that you care so
[56:15] much Lord that you we could be here
[56:18] tonight and we could be recipients of
[56:21] Grace once again
[56:23] Lord once again father here's another
[56:26] opportunity for maybe one person
[56:30] Lord that
[56:32] tonight maybe something Lord that would
[56:34] be said that they would respond to Lord
[56:37] and tonight you could rewrite their
[56:39] whole
[56:40] life God I'm so aware right now at this
[56:45] moment Lord that there's a struggle
[56:48] taking
[56:49] place Lord and the devil if he could he
[56:53] he'd love just to take that life and
[56:55] snuff it out early it'd love to fill
[56:58] that mind with continued doubt and
[57:03] fear Lord but I just ask that you'd help
[57:06] me tonight Lord if I could just present
[57:09] you in such a way that would break the
[57:12] grip of the enemy out of that young man
[57:14] out of that young lady Lord and tonight
[57:17] they can say from that time I was
[57:20] changed forever I pray God that you
[57:22] would just come right now Lord and maybe
[57:25] a life God it was in Youth meetings like
[57:27] this I'm reminded very similar to this
[57:30] just years ago a young lady came to that
[57:33] camp and her life had taken a wrong turn
[57:36] and was upside down and going the wrong
[57:39] direction and in relationship she
[57:41] shouldn't have been in but somehow Grace
[57:45] somehow Grace intervened and she found
[57:48] herself there amongst
[57:51] Believers lord and there could be just a
[57:53] young lady just like that here tonight
[57:56] maybe a young man who Satan is head
[57:58] bound but he maybe's not what he should
[58:02] be doesn't look the part and he feels A
[58:04] Million Miles Away much like that girl
[58:07] did Lord it would be at that youth
[58:11] camp that she would come home
[58:13] Lord it would be at that Youth Camp Lord
[58:16] where the preaching of the word of God
[58:18] would so stir her heart she'd come to an
[58:20] altar and surrender her whole life to
[58:23] the Lord Jesus and little did she know
[58:26] that on her way home to her natural home
[58:31] she'd be in a car accident and she'd go
[58:33] to her Heavenly Home little did she know
[58:36] Lord that that service she was in was
[58:39] her last
[58:41] opportunity your Prophet said there will
[58:43] be a last sermon that we hear a time
[58:45] when we turn our Bible for the last time
[58:48] I pray God if there'd be anybody that
[58:50] would be here tonight Lord let them hear
[58:53] the voice of your of your of the Beloved
[58:55] let them hear the the voice of their
[58:57] father speaking Lord and may they
[58:59] respond to
[59:01] Grace we ask it now Lord may your word
[59:04] go forth we pray have Liberty and have
[59:07] your way in Jesus name amen you can be
[59:14] seated the Apostle Paul here in
[59:17] Ephesians chapter 6 and I know this
[59:18] scripture is very familiar to
[59:21] you what he's saying here is that
[59:23] there's a real struggle it's a very real
[59:26] battle it's invisible you could say in
[59:28] some ways though sometimes we can see
[59:30] the external manifestations of it but
[59:34] internally there's a real struggle a
[59:36] real battle a real war that's taking
[59:39] place and I just want to say that the
[59:41] battle that you fight is not against
[59:44] it's not a battle of flesh and blood
[59:47] it's not a physical problem at all in
[59:49] fact no matter what you would name me
[59:50] here tonight if you were to list some of
[59:52] your struggles that you have and you
[59:54] could say brother Matt these are some of
[59:56] the some of the battles that I face and
[59:59] sometimes when I have defeat it's in
[1:00:01] these areas of my life and I'm
[1:00:03] struggling with this area and I'm
[1:00:04] struggling over here and I need the Lord
[1:00:07] to give me victory in fact it wouldn't
[1:00:08] matter what you put on that list none of
[1:00:11] those things would be confined to what
[1:00:14] you listed but actually beyond that
[1:00:17] physical Struggle No matter what it is
[1:00:19] is a spiritual problem and that physical
[1:00:23] attribute is only the manifestation of
[1:00:26] something that's taking place
[1:00:29] supernaturally you see you may look at
[1:00:31] addictions and you can look and think
[1:00:33] that that problem is a real physical
[1:00:35] problem and so you treat that physical
[1:00:37] symptom you could look at addictions of
[1:00:40] alcohol and we give people good programs
[1:00:42] for that you know Alcoholics Anonymous
[1:00:44] or you could take a psychologist route
[1:00:47] you could have addictions to drugs and
[1:00:49] you could try to get them help and I'm
[1:00:50] not saying anything sometimes that's all
[1:00:52] the help that some people can get but
[1:00:55] I'm so glad that we've got more weapons
[1:00:57] to fight the devil with than just what
[1:00:59] are made by human hands but our weapons
[1:01:02] the Bible says are not caral but they're
[1:01:04] spiritual they're Mighty to the pulling
[1:01:07] down of all
[1:01:09] strongholds and so you can look at
[1:01:11] addiction and you could see it as that
[1:01:13] physical problem but what we must
[1:01:15] understand as Christians is that
[1:01:17] actually it's a demon spirit that has
[1:01:19] been given access to the vessel of that
[1:01:22] person in their life through unbelief
[1:01:25] because brother said that's the only
[1:01:27] channel that the devil can get to a
[1:01:29] Christian is through doubt or unbelief
[1:01:32] how many can say Amen to that and so
[1:01:34] anytime that you see a problem whether
[1:01:36] it's addictions to pornography drugs
[1:01:39] alcohol wouldn't matter what you can
[1:01:41] name here tonight it is all a stronghold
[1:01:44] that is only the result of that
[1:01:46] individual taking on a spirit or giving
[1:01:49] way to a stronghold in their life and
[1:01:52] now that stronghold that they have has
[1:01:55] produced an outward problem and then we
[1:01:57] label that problem depression we label
[1:02:00] it anxiety we label it fear we label it
[1:02:04] doesn't matter if it's a physical
[1:02:05] disease the way that brother bham taught
[1:02:08] us about healing when he preaches what
[1:02:10] cancer is is that cancer actually is
[1:02:13] only the outside physical body that
[1:02:15] tumor is just the outside physical
[1:02:17] substance of the life of that spirit
[1:02:21] that is living off of the life of that
[1:02:23] host as brother Al and different
[1:02:25] Brothers the Travis last night talked
[1:02:27] about that that Satan must have an
[1:02:29] object he must have a vessel he must
[1:02:31] have something that he can work through
[1:02:33] to express himself sounded good brother
[1:02:35] uh you could keep it where it was
[1:02:37] sounded good up here um just a moment
[1:02:39] ago you can bring that up just some so
[1:02:41] we we as Believers understand this that
[1:02:44] it's not a it's not a flesh and blood
[1:02:46] battle but it's a spiritual problem it's
[1:02:48] a spiritual wickedness in other
[1:02:51] dimensions what we must realize is that
[1:02:54] that spirit that we feel as the prophet
[1:02:57] of God said it this way he said that
[1:02:59] when you come to church sometimes you
[1:03:01] come there and maybe a song is sang
[1:03:03] maybe maybe a sister or a brother gets
[1:03:05] up and sings a special and you just feel
[1:03:08] that warm feeling come over you and and
[1:03:11] sometimes you can't explain it you don't
[1:03:12] know why uh but you it just makes you
[1:03:15] just want to just raise your hands up to
[1:03:17] the Lord and something within you just
[1:03:19] raise his hands up and you start to
[1:03:21] enter in how many ever felt that way
[1:03:23] other times you you hear the preaching
[1:03:25] of the word of God and you could just
[1:03:26] feel it at that moment and something
[1:03:28] within you just wants to agree with the
[1:03:30] word of God and you you you might mutter
[1:03:33] it under your breath and no one could
[1:03:34] hear it but you say amen and because you
[1:03:37] believe it you know sometimes it do you
[1:03:39] good to to get a little bit more vocal
[1:03:41] with that I believe it do you some good
[1:03:43] and it back the devil off of some of us
[1:03:45] if we'd start confessing and start
[1:03:47] pulling on the word of God it it it
[1:03:49] liberates it has the power to liberate
[1:03:51] you as we said it can change your
[1:03:53] atmosphere it can change everything
[1:03:55] around you if the devil can do anything
[1:03:57] he'll just get you to shut up don't say
[1:03:59] anything and just give in and back you
[1:04:02] into a corner sometimes we ought to
[1:04:04] stand up to the bully in our life and
[1:04:06] say Satan you're not going to push me
[1:04:08] around anymore I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:04:11] daughter of God I'm not who you say I am
[1:04:13] I'm who the word says that I
[1:04:16] am and so many times we take this and we
[1:04:19] need to realize brother bam said you
[1:04:20] feel that under the preaching of the
[1:04:22] word and you start to feel that feeling
[1:04:23] and he said other times you you don't
[1:04:26] know why you can't explain it but you
[1:04:28] just begin to cry and you begin to weep
[1:04:30] and he says you don't know why nothing
[1:04:32] but what whatever it was brother the
[1:04:34] prophet of God says you don't know why
[1:04:35] you're crying but you just find yourself
[1:04:38] feeling something that's beyond what you
[1:04:40] see it's beyond what you're even hearing
[1:04:43] you know sometimes the word of God is
[1:04:44] more than what you hear preached it's
[1:04:47] what you feel in your soul as the
[1:04:49] prophet of God said you hear from your
[1:04:51] theophany and many times the prophet
[1:04:53] says when you feel that he says what is
[1:04:55] is doing that and he says it this way
[1:04:58] you're bumping into that other
[1:05:01] dimension Hallelujah and he says you're
[1:05:04] bumping into it you don't realize it but
[1:05:06] you're bumping into Angels oh I I just
[1:05:09] believe here tonight if there's anything
[1:05:11] I want to bump into it's Angelic spirits
[1:05:14] to say Lord let me bump into that other
[1:05:17] dimension so if it's true that way with
[1:05:19] angels then how much more is it true
[1:05:22] when we start to feed on the wrong
[1:05:24] things get in the wrong atmospheres and
[1:05:27] suddenly we feel depression we feel
[1:05:29] worry we feel fear we feel anxiety we're
[1:05:32] bumping into that other
[1:05:35] dimension and so you can find this here
[1:05:37] and I just want to take time just to lay
[1:05:39] this Foundation through and make it real
[1:05:42] clear what we understand is that these
[1:05:44] problems are not flesh and blood but
[1:05:46] they're actually Spirits in another
[1:05:48] dimension you could find that in the
[1:05:50] book of Jude and it talks about the
[1:05:52] Angels which kept not their first estate
[1:05:54] now I want you to know notice something
[1:05:56] here because in the Book of Revelations
[1:05:58] chapter 9 and I know I'm not here to
[1:06:00] teach on that here tonight but just to
[1:06:01] drop this in for a moment it talks about
[1:06:03] Lucifer and also in Revelations 12 and
[1:06:06] it talks about how that Lucifer uh the
[1:06:08] the first battle that took place how
[1:06:10] many knows brother bandham says that the
[1:06:12] battle happens in three places it starts
[1:06:15] in heaven and it starts with Michael it
[1:06:17] starts with Lucifer and and the Devil
[1:06:19] deceives the angels and he says then
[1:06:21] that battle when Lucifer is cast out of
[1:06:24] Heaven he says moves into the Earth and
[1:06:27] that's your dimension it's your
[1:06:29] spiritual warfare you're facing now and
[1:06:31] he says in one day that same battle that
[1:06:33] started in heaven and is now in Earth
[1:06:35] will finally end up in the battle of
[1:06:38] Armageddon in the valley of Armageddon
[1:06:40] when all the armies of the world will
[1:06:43] Encompass Jerusalem and the prophet says
[1:06:45] it this way that battle of Armageddon
[1:06:47] will only be the final battle from the
[1:06:51] war that started in heaven and so we
[1:06:54] must need to realize that just as much
[1:06:57] as that's a very real physical battle
[1:07:00] that would take place there's a battle
[1:07:02] very real that's happening today yes sir
[1:07:06] and you are caught in the midst of
[1:07:08] influence from either Angels or
[1:07:11] demons you know brother Brandon points
[1:07:13] this out in the church age book and he
[1:07:15] says that notice how that the scripture
[1:07:17] talks about second Peter chapter 2 talks
[1:07:19] about it also how that a how that
[1:07:21] Lucifer deceived the angels angels are
[1:07:24] given free moral agency they have the
[1:07:26] ability to choose and the Bible says
[1:07:28] that Lucifer LED 2/3 of the Angels now
[1:07:32] this is incredible because the Bible
[1:07:33] says he drew them with his tail the Tail
[1:07:36] of the Dragon but brother brandham by
[1:07:38] prophetic Insight says it's not his tail
[1:07:40] t a i l but it was his tail t a l e it's
[1:07:45] what he told them you see the devil has
[1:07:47] preachers it's not just gospel preachers
[1:07:50] but the devil has many agents or vessels
[1:07:52] that he uses to influence us it could be
[1:07:55] music
[1:07:55] it could be the wrong movies it could be
[1:07:57] the wrong friends it could be the wrong
[1:07:59] things on Facebook uhoh don't get quiet
[1:08:02] on me could be the you don't use
[1:08:04] Facebook that's for old fogies well what
[1:08:06] about Instagram and and and now they
[1:08:08] banned Tik Tok so I can't say that and
[1:08:10] and and Snapchat and all these others I
[1:08:12] don't want to show my age but listen
[1:08:14] here's what I know I know that the that
[1:08:16] what's not changed is the battle
[1:08:18] television is what brother brandham
[1:08:20] identified as the fourth dimension where
[1:08:22] demon Spirits operate through television
[1:08:25] and they bring influence to homes he
[1:08:27] said that's why now you don't have
[1:08:28] family life anymore is because the
[1:08:30] influence from that fourth dimension
[1:08:32] through television has destroyed the
[1:08:34] family structure now a man doesn't know
[1:08:36] what a man is a woman doesn't know what
[1:08:38] a woman is my goodness friends are we
[1:08:40] not living in Satan's Eden we are living
[1:08:43] at the manifestation of what a prophet
[1:08:45] seen years and years ago when he
[1:08:47] prophesied in the fourth vision of the
[1:08:49] seven that he has and he says one of the
[1:08:51] things I seen before the go before the
[1:08:53] destruction of the Earth was that women
[1:08:55] begin to get out of their place and he
[1:08:57] says and men were
[1:09:00] sissies don't think that this entire
[1:09:03] agenda of a man's bathroom and a woman's
[1:09:05] bathroom we don't know what a woman is
[1:09:06] don't know what a man is happened by
[1:09:08] accident a prophet already seen it by
[1:09:10] vision and you're living in the
[1:09:12] manifestation of it I am so glad that I
[1:09:14] don't have to listen to the nonsense and
[1:09:17] the confusion of the world but I've been
[1:09:19] given the mind of Christ and I know what
[1:09:22] the Bible said and it doesn't matter
[1:09:23] what a professor says it doesn't matter
[1:09:25] what scientists say I wish somebody
[1:09:27] would help me preach it only matters
[1:09:30] what the absolute word of God says
[1:09:32] that's the truth not a truth it is the
[1:09:35] only
[1:09:37] truth and so notice this was a spirit
[1:09:40] and it's amazing because the Bible says
[1:09:42] that he leads them as Jude says the
[1:09:45] Angels which kept not their first estate
[1:09:48] so you say brother Matt what is a demon
[1:09:50] Spirit a demon is an angel that has
[1:09:53] fallen now I want you to notice because
[1:09:56] brother Brandon makes this so clear in
[1:09:58] the church age book and another when he
[1:09:59] preaches especially demonology I I just
[1:10:01] want to I want to make sure I cover What
[1:10:03] the Lord Has us to cover and I I just
[1:10:05] don't I'm not going to be able to get to
[1:10:07] all of this so we just have a certain
[1:10:09] amount of time but I want you to I want
[1:10:11] to make you aware of something you could
[1:10:12] go to the next slide brother and just
[1:10:14] hold that up here for a moment I want
[1:10:16] you to notice something because the
[1:10:18] scripture teaches us that there are real
[1:10:20] beings real angels these are creatures
[1:10:24] intelligent creatures Crees not just
[1:10:26] some figment or some story that somebody
[1:10:29] made this is real creatures that have
[1:10:32] the ability to bring
[1:10:35] influence and so the Bible says that
[1:10:37] they're Supernatural beyond our human
[1:10:40] senses but can I just say this and I
[1:10:42] want you to remember it they are there
[1:10:46] all the
[1:10:48] time they are there when you wake up
[1:10:51] they are there when you go to bed they
[1:10:53] are there when you are at church hearing
[1:10:55] the preaching of the word of God oh yeah
[1:10:58] the devil sometimes is the most faithful
[1:11:00] church member that we've got he's there
[1:11:03] early he's there waiting on you to get
[1:11:05] there to try to do everything he can to
[1:11:08] distract you from receiving from the
[1:11:09] Holy Spirit but he's there all the time
[1:11:13] a demon spirit is always there but I can
[1:11:16] also remind you angels are always there
[1:11:20] also and the prophet of God said what do
[1:11:23] we have here in the building tonight we
[1:11:25] have the preaching of the word of God we
[1:11:28] have God's family here he says we have
[1:11:30] demon Spirits here trying to affect the
[1:11:34] people's minds as the preaching Goes
[1:11:36] Forth and he says but also we have
[1:11:38] Angels encamped about us and he says
[1:11:41] they're trying to energize our faith oh
[1:11:46] I wonder if we just invite them tonight
[1:11:48] and say angels of God energize my faith
[1:11:51] I'm a vessel who can receive I'm going
[1:11:54] to close the door of the demons and I'm
[1:11:56] going to open the door to Angels I might
[1:11:58] have came here down and cast down and
[1:12:00] worried and with anxiety and depression
[1:12:02] of this camp but today I'm going to
[1:12:05] leave them here and I'm going to go on
[1:12:07] with joy with happiness with
[1:12:10] peace you don't have to leave here with
[1:12:12] that God can deliver you from
[1:12:14] it and so notice it's a spiritual host
[1:12:19] around us both of good
[1:12:22] angels and bad angels
[1:12:26] I want to say this you will not choose
[1:12:29] whether you are influenced by Angels you
[1:12:32] will only choose what Angels influence
[1:12:37] youtiful because we live in a world
[1:12:40] today to where the B brother baram says
[1:12:42] the lid of hell has been torn off I know
[1:12:47] I I know that I'm preaching to young
[1:12:48] people but I just be honest I don't
[1:12:50] believe I got to preach to you any
[1:12:51] different than I do anybody I believe I
[1:12:54] I I believe that we've got a generation
[1:12:56] of young people that listen to the
[1:12:57] message and read their books listen to
[1:12:59] their tapes and read their Bibles and if
[1:13:02] you don't I would encourage you to do it
[1:13:04] did you ever notice your feed it's
[1:13:07] called a feed whether it's Facebook
[1:13:09] Instagram doesn't matter what it is
[1:13:10] anybody ever notice that it's called a
[1:13:11] feed why do you think it's called a
[1:13:14] feed that's right they're feeding you
[1:13:17] something it's so incredible to me how
[1:13:19] many times we're so wanting to be freed
[1:13:22] of anxiety and depression and yet yet we
[1:13:25] don't realize the very thing we want to
[1:13:27] be free of is the very thing we are
[1:13:32] feeding because I know it's not just in
[1:13:34] the United States of America North
[1:13:36] America it's covered SE to Sea and it's
[1:13:39] amazing because it's one of the things I
[1:13:41] preached youth camps last year and the
[1:13:42] Lord just gave me Grace never done it
[1:13:44] before in as many countries as I did I I
[1:13:46] I just country after country preach You
[1:13:49] Youth Camps I don't consider myself to
[1:13:51] be honest a good youth preacher a good
[1:13:53] Youth Camp preacher but um but the Lord
[1:13:55] was was able to use me uh the last year
[1:13:58] and it was incredible Even in our own
[1:14:00] youth camp we had prayer lines and
[1:14:01] prayer lines at every Youth Camp I was
[1:14:02] in Honduras I was in Poland I was in
[1:14:04] Belgium I was all kinds of places and
[1:14:07] and it was didn't matter what country
[1:14:09] does it matter what language they spoke
[1:14:11] it over overall 90% of the needs were
[1:14:14] needs of depression needs of uh uh
[1:14:18] spirits of
[1:14:20] anxiety it's it's like it's a pandemic
[1:14:23] in this generation and I'm going to tell
[1:14:26] you it's not an
[1:14:28] accident the prophet of God when he's
[1:14:31] talking about scientific achievement and
[1:14:33] he says this and I'm just going to
[1:14:35] paraphrase this he says that science has
[1:14:38] advanced at such a rapid Pace that he
[1:14:41] says that Humanity can't handle it the
[1:14:43] senses can't handle it and it's
[1:14:45] producing neurosis and a neurotic age of
[1:14:49] neurotic people because of the rapid
[1:14:51] development of
[1:14:53] technology and so we know that we're
[1:14:56] living in the in the day of progress
[1:14:58] where things are rapidly coming on the
[1:15:00] scene not just it's not not doesn't take
[1:15:03] years to develop something anymore now
[1:15:05] it just happens just immediately it's
[1:15:07] just just year just a few years ago we
[1:15:09] were joking about artificial
[1:15:11] intelligence and robots well listen
[1:15:13] friends it's a reality now it's not it's
[1:15:16] not it's not a it's not just something
[1:15:18] that we we talk about you know it's
[1:15:20] going to be in the year you know this
[1:15:21] year 2090 and it's it's right here upon
[1:15:24] you right now now artificial
[1:15:25] intelligence and and the prophet of God
[1:15:27] says that he says that beyond the when
[1:15:30] the horse and buggy came he said that
[1:15:31] was a type there then it went from there
[1:15:33] to the automobile then it went from
[1:15:35] there to the jet aircraft and he says
[1:15:37] but that wasn't the end progress would
[1:15:38] continue into astronauts and the prophet
[1:15:41] of God says it was a type of the word
[1:15:43] that God was restoring to his people
[1:15:45] that science is only one step behind God
[1:15:48] because whatever science is doing in the
[1:15:51] natural God is doing in the Supernatural
[1:15:53] That's why it says about the time man
[1:15:55] Wright brothers were coming off the
[1:15:57] ground in North Carolina my home state
[1:15:59] and they were learning how to fly he
[1:16:01] says there about that same time and
[1:16:03] California there was a little group of
[1:16:05] in a dingy Hall that no one really cared
[1:16:07] about no one was insignificant to
[1:16:09] everybody a group of Pentecostals and he
[1:16:11] said they begin to speak in tongues into
[1:16:13] that isua Street Revival and he says
[1:16:15] what was it as man was coming off the
[1:16:17] ground God's family was starting to get
[1:16:19] off the ground and learning how to
[1:16:21] fly and brother bam says but that's not
[1:16:24] where it stopped we're not in that
[1:16:26] course and buggy age we're not in the
[1:16:28] the the jet aircraft age he says now
[1:16:30] there's an astronaut age and we're
[1:16:32] spiritual astronauts going beyond the
[1:16:35] dimensions of this world and we soar
[1:16:37] like eagles in other
[1:16:41] dimensions but did you know brother
[1:16:43] bandam says it doesn't stop there and he
[1:16:45] says the only thing left to come is him
[1:16:49] himself the
[1:16:52] intelligence so beyond the mouth the
[1:16:56] hands is the eyes and brother bam says
[1:16:58] what was that it was a type of the
[1:17:00] prophetic Vision a prophet of Mali 4 but
[1:17:04] beyond that you see many people stop
[1:17:06] there but you don't stop there you got
[1:17:07] to keep progressing with the word
[1:17:09] brother brandham says but as The
[1:17:11] Headstone comes down it brings the
[1:17:14] intelligence listen friends artificial
[1:17:16] intelligence is only artificial but I
[1:17:19] got something that's not artificial I've
[1:17:22] got the mind of Christ
[1:17:25] and you've got access to that mind here
[1:17:27] tonight and so it's amazing to me
[1:17:30] because so many times we feed on those
[1:17:32] things and people feed and feed and feed
[1:17:33] and they get more depressed and more
[1:17:34] depressed and more anxiety more worry
[1:17:36] they won't deliver listen friends can I
[1:17:37] just make it so simple you will never
[1:17:40] get freed from a demon that you're
[1:17:43] feeding you will never no matter how
[1:17:46] much you cry and scream and beat at this
[1:17:48] altar ask brother brother after brother
[1:17:50] seek brother to lay hands on you you
[1:17:52] will never get freed from it so long as
[1:17:54] you are are feeding
[1:17:56] it I should have get a big old
[1:18:01] amen as long as you're feeding it it's
[1:18:03] so amazing to me you know it's so
[1:18:06] amazing to me because people feed and
[1:18:07] feed and feed and feed and feed you know
[1:18:09] brother Vern it's so incredible can I
[1:18:11] just testify tonight never one time have
[1:18:14] I ever turned on a tape of the prophet
[1:18:16] and when the tape is over I feel anxiety
[1:18:18] depression I'm worried it's never
[1:18:21] happened I've never got on done reading
[1:18:23] my Bible got up off my knees and knees
[1:18:25] and my heart's pounding because I'm so
[1:18:27] fearful and so anxiety and so much worry
[1:18:29] and so much stress and friends can I
[1:18:31] just say can we make it not so
[1:18:33] complicated make it simple I think it's
[1:18:35] time we stop feeding on the things that
[1:18:38] make us depressed and anxiety and
[1:18:41] worried and we start feeding on the
[1:18:43] things that give us faith and give us
[1:18:45] hope and give us life and give us joy we
[1:18:48] ought to shut the dimension of the devil
[1:18:50] and say I'm opening the door to angels
[1:18:53] to come and min Minister down to my
[1:18:59] spirit and so this is another dimension
[1:19:01] it's a very real
[1:19:03] one the Bible says that there's good
[1:19:05] ones and bad ones a a host of an army
[1:19:10] that's all around us in Revelations
[1:19:13] chapter 9 it talks about those 200
[1:19:15] million demon Spirit Chargers that were
[1:19:19] bound at the river
[1:19:20] Euphrates and the brother Adam says but
[1:19:22] at the sounding of that six trumpet they
[1:19:24] were released to cross the Euphrates
[1:19:27] river and he says they begin to stream
[1:19:30] into the Earth that's what that's the
[1:19:32] anointing that Hitler came under Stalin
[1:19:34] ikan it's what he says in the six seal
[1:19:36] musolini they come under the spirit of
[1:19:38] those demon Chargers because they were
[1:19:41] Unleashed upon the Earth and they
[1:19:44] attacked the Jews now brother bandam
[1:19:46] says that was th those spiritual
[1:19:48] Chargers that had been bound at that
[1:19:51] River and they were Unleashed upon
[1:19:53] Humanity into what dimension brother
[1:19:56] Matt the fourth dimension now you say
[1:19:58] what is that fourth dimension that
[1:20:00] fourth dimension is the dimension of
[1:20:03] science now I got a question for you
[1:20:05] does anybody hear voices of radio movies
[1:20:09] television anybody hear that right now
[1:20:11] no you just hear my voice you maybe hear
[1:20:13] the sound of the crashing waves out
[1:20:15] there but you don't hear any of that
[1:20:17] anybody hear the voice of someone
[1:20:19] performing in a a music uh Symphony in
[1:20:22] an orchestra anybody hear that right now
[1:20:25] I hope you
[1:20:27] don't no one hears that but yet the
[1:20:30] prophet of God says it's here right now
[1:20:34] and he says all you'd have to do is get
[1:20:36] a crystal or a receiver to input that
[1:20:40] signal and it would display for you on
[1:20:43] the television how many remember that
[1:20:45] when brother bam talks about that and so
[1:20:48] he says those Spirits are only here in
[1:20:50] that fourth dimension it's that
[1:20:52] dimension of science brother bandham
[1:20:54] said that's the dimensions prophets
[1:20:55] operate in by by Vision it's also where
[1:20:58] diseases move through it's that channel
[1:21:00] of travel that you can move from one
[1:21:03] place to the next you see brother vam
[1:21:05] says that man lives in a
[1:21:07] multi-dimensional environment I just I
[1:21:09] just want to to take this because I
[1:21:11] believe it's so basic but I I think it
[1:21:13] we ought to just remind ourselves
[1:21:15] sometimes of these things in this other
[1:21:17] dimension because these bad angels are
[1:21:20] not in some deep dark layer somewhere in
[1:21:23] an underworld but the Bible says they
[1:21:26] are in other dimensions in Heavenly
[1:21:29] places that's where all angels are the
[1:21:31] good and the bad ones so the real battle
[1:21:34] taking place right now is not
[1:21:37] necessarily happening on this Dimension
[1:21:40] but it's actually happening in another
[1:21:43] dimension a dimension that we're
[1:21:45] affected by at all times because brother
[1:21:49] bam says that man lives in a
[1:21:51] multi-dimensional environment how many
[1:21:54] remember brother B I'm saying that seven
[1:21:56] dimensions all around us heaven and hell
[1:22:00] are just across the chasm and that's why
[1:22:03] brother Adam says that when we die we
[1:22:05] don't go A Million Miles Away we only
[1:22:08] change
[1:22:11] dimensions and so you say where did all
[1:22:13] this start from Brother Matt just take
[1:22:15] break it down here for a moment you can
[1:22:17] see that this was the Book of Ezekiel
[1:22:20] and I'm just going to read this to you
[1:22:21] Lucifer you could you could Advance it
[1:22:24] it talks about Lucifer which is that
[1:22:26] word Lucifer is actually a
[1:22:28] transliterated word it just means the
[1:22:31] Morning Star the light says in the Book
[1:22:34] of Ezekiel you were the signant talking
[1:22:36] about Lucifer of perfection full of
[1:22:38] wisdom perfect in Beauty you were in
[1:22:41] Eden the Garden of God and every
[1:22:43] precious stone was your covering you
[1:22:46] were an anointed Guardian cherub I
[1:22:49] placed you you were on the Holy Mountain
[1:22:52] of God in the midst of the stones of
[1:22:55] fire you walked you were blameless in
[1:22:58] all of your ways from the day thou were
[1:23:00] created until unrighteousness or
[1:23:03] iniquity the King James says was found
[1:23:07] in
[1:23:08] you so this was where it all began this
[1:23:11] is where evil started it started in a
[1:23:14] battle and this Angel who had free moral
[1:23:18] agency had a desire in his heart to be
[1:23:22] worshiped just as God is
[1:23:26] worshiped he doesn't want a bar stool
[1:23:28] he's already got it he doesn't want the
[1:23:31] the dance hall he's already got it what
[1:23:33] he wants is a
[1:23:36] church because what he wants is
[1:23:40] worship and so he starts with this
[1:23:42] ambition to be like the most high God as
[1:23:46] it says Thou said in your heart I will
[1:23:49] Ascend to the hill of God I will be like
[1:23:52] the most high this was his ambition so
[1:23:55] he deceives angels that were in heaven
[1:23:58] and they become fallen angels look at
[1:24:01] how Jude says it in Jude chapter 1 verse
[1:24:03] 6 and the angels who did not stay I'm
[1:24:06] reading this from the uh Amplified it's
[1:24:08] very brings out just a very good uh uh
[1:24:11] understanding of and the angels who did
[1:24:12] not stay with their own position of
[1:24:14] authority King James says who left their
[1:24:17] first estate but left their proper
[1:24:19] dwelling he has kept in Chains under
[1:24:23] gloomy darkness and till the Judgment of
[1:24:25] the great day 2 Peter 2:4 for if God did
[1:24:28] not spare Angels when they sinned but
[1:24:31] cast them into hell and committed them
[1:24:34] to chains of gloomy Darkness to be kept
[1:24:36] until the Judgment Revelations 12:9 and
[1:24:39] the Great Dragon was thrown down where
[1:24:42] was Satan cast to your
[1:24:46] dimension so he leaves heaven and now
[1:24:49] what was a Heavenly battle has became an
[1:24:53] Earthly battle
[1:24:55] and so the Bible says he was cast down
[1:24:57] thrown down that ancient serpent who's
[1:24:59] called the devil and Satan the deceiver
[1:25:01] of the whole world he was thrown down to
[1:25:04] the Earth and his angels were thrown
[1:25:06] down with him Matthew 12 speaks of the
[1:25:09] ruler of the Demons when the Pharisees
[1:25:11] heard it they said it's only beable the
[1:25:14] ruler of the demons that this fellow
[1:25:17] cast out demons so notice even Daniel I
[1:25:21] don't have time to pick it up but when
[1:25:23] Daniel's praying you remember the
[1:25:25] scripture when Michael the Bible says
[1:25:27] the Archangel came to Daniel and said
[1:25:29] Daniel I heard you when you prayed the
[1:25:32] first time I've came for your words with
[1:25:35] the very first moment you begin to pray
[1:25:38] all Heaven dispatched an army unto you
[1:25:41] but the Prince of Persia hindered me so
[1:25:44] what was it it's not just listen friends
[1:25:46] when you pray you're not just repeating
[1:25:48] a prayer you're not just doing it
[1:25:50] because you than you should you need to
[1:25:51] recognize that every time you is a
[1:25:54] Christian bow your head and pray the
[1:25:56] prayer of faith you are leaving this
[1:25:58] Dimension and you're moving into another
[1:26:01] dimension where God can hear your prayer
[1:26:04] and dispatch angels on your oh you may
[1:26:06] not feel it you may not think it you may
[1:26:08] not see it but you can have faith
[1:26:10] tonight that the same God who heard
[1:26:12] Daniel's prayer he's the prayer of the
[1:26:14] faintest Cry of a Believer it doesn't
[1:26:17] matter if you are the brother bam said
[1:26:19] it don't matter how weak you feel as a
[1:26:21] Christian you may be the skin on the
[1:26:23] bottom of the feet in the body of Christ
[1:26:26] but that still means you got every devil
[1:26:28] underneath your feet and the Bible says
[1:26:30] he hears the prayers of the
[1:26:33] righteous and so we have you say brother
[1:26:35] Matt oh there's demons and there's
[1:26:38] another dimension and you're speaking
[1:26:39] about beable well can I just remind you
[1:26:41] just so much brother bham says as those
[1:26:44] 10 200 million demons I love this were
[1:26:47] loosed at the river Euphrates who had
[1:26:49] been bound there for thousands of years
[1:26:52] brother bham says but also the Holy
[1:26:54] Ghost was also Bound by Creeds and
[1:26:57] denominations and dogmas of men but by
[1:27:00] the preaching of the word of God and the
[1:27:02] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[1:27:04] the Holy Ghost was Unleashed and
[1:27:07] unloosed and what does it mean my
[1:27:09] brother my sister he is accessible to
[1:27:12] you as a Christian you can bow your head
[1:27:15] and pray to your father you don't need a
[1:27:17] priest you don't need a preacher you
[1:27:18] don't need a your mother your father you
[1:27:21] have access as a son or daughter of God
[1:27:24] to your father's name oh we ought to
[1:27:27] rejoice in that tonight that we have a
[1:27:30] tower we have a refuge we can run to
[1:27:32] when we're overwhelmed David said when
[1:27:34] my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the
[1:27:36] rock that is higher than I don't give me
[1:27:38] just man's Solutions I I'm done with
[1:27:41] man's Solutions don't even give me my
[1:27:43] own ideas lead me to the rock that is
[1:27:46] higher than
[1:27:47] I
[1:27:48] Hallelujah so notice I just we just hear
[1:27:51] for a moment Mark chapter 9 I I don't
[1:27:53] know if we'll cover all of these you can
[1:27:54] keep going the Bible speaks of this
[1:27:57] someone from the crowd answered him
[1:27:58] teacher I brought my son to you for
[1:28:00] there has a spirit that makes him mute
[1:28:01] and whenever it seases him it throws him
[1:28:03] down and he Foams and grinds his teeth
[1:28:05] this is a very real problem this is a
[1:28:07] physical
[1:28:08] manifestation of a demon spirit in a
[1:28:11] young boy and this his dad is saying
[1:28:14] every time that that he has a spirit
[1:28:16] makes him mute and it seizes him and
[1:28:18] throws him down he Foams and grinds so I
[1:28:20] asked your disciples to cast it on they
[1:28:22] were not able and he answered and said
[1:28:24] said oh faithless generation how long am
[1:28:25] I to be with you how long am I to bear
[1:28:27] with you bring him to me so they brought
[1:28:28] the boy to him and when the spirit saw
[1:28:31] him immediately it convulsed the boy and
[1:28:36] he fell on the ground and rode about
[1:28:37] foaming at the mouth and Jesus asked his
[1:28:40] father and said how long has this been
[1:28:43] happening to him and he said from
[1:28:44] childhood and it has often cast him into
[1:28:47] fire and into water and to destroy him
[1:28:49] but if you can do anything I love this
[1:28:52] but if you can do anything have
[1:28:54] compassion on us and help us I am so
[1:28:58] glad that they found the right person to
[1:29:01] bring their problem to friends we so
[1:29:03] many times bring our problems to the
[1:29:05] wrong source of help but you've got a
[1:29:08] source of help you can bring your issues
[1:29:10] too and your problems too and he's an
[1:29:12] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:29:15] he's a he's a strong tower that the
[1:29:17] righteous can run into and be saved and
[1:29:19] he can deliver and save how many
[1:29:21] believes that here tonight he is still a
[1:29:24] deliverer of the bound he is still a
[1:29:26] Healer of those that are sick yes sir he
[1:29:29] still sets
[1:29:31] free and so notice this here they they
[1:29:33] come to him again Jesus said I love this
[1:29:36] so much Jesus said to him if you can all
[1:29:41] things are possible for one who
[1:29:45] believes immediately the father of the
[1:29:48] child the of the child cried out and
[1:29:49] said I believe how many can say this I
[1:29:52] believe help my my unbelief and when
[1:29:56] Jesus saw that the crowd came running he
[1:29:57] rebuked the unclean Spirit saying you m
[1:29:59] and mute and deaf spirit I command you
[1:30:02] he doesn't notice this this is what we
[1:30:04] were saying here the first night he
[1:30:05] doesn't say thou sudden sensor neural
[1:30:07] hearing loss thou vestibular tubes that
[1:30:10] have locked up and now audal nerve Jesus
[1:30:12] never gets into the science at all
[1:30:14] because the doctors deal in that
[1:30:16] Dimension but to get real Freedom you've
[1:30:18] got to deal in really what it is and
[1:30:21] they might give it a name but what it
[1:30:23] actually is is is a demon spirit and
[1:30:27] until you call it for what it is you
[1:30:30] listen friends as long as we pet our
[1:30:32] problems and we don't identify them and
[1:30:36] we and we pet our anxiety and that's
[1:30:38] just my anxiety don't call it your
[1:30:41] anxiety that's just how I Was Made
[1:30:43] that's just the family I was raised in
[1:30:45] well what does that have anything to do
[1:30:46] with the blood of Jesus the blood of
[1:30:49] Jesus stops the Bloodlines of humanity
[1:30:51] brother brandham says that I realized
[1:30:53] I'm not the son of Charles andella
[1:30:55] brandham I'm a child of God and I have
[1:30:57] access to my father's name I don't have
[1:30:59] anything hereditary except this I've got
[1:31:02] a name in Heaven by where with the whole
[1:31:04] family of Earth of in heaven is named
[1:31:07] the after the name of Jesus that means I
[1:31:09] have his inheritance I'm a join a with
[1:31:12] him and his
[1:31:16] promises we we quoted this from our
[1:31:18] scripture I'm just going to skip it
[1:31:19] brother you can go to slide dine notice
[1:31:22] now light matter and time I love this
[1:31:25] and our five senses contact them
[1:31:28] Dimensions our sight contacts light our
[1:31:32] feelings contact matter and so forth but
[1:31:36] we have contact through science the
[1:31:38] fourth dimension as it was because
[1:31:41] coming right through this building now
[1:31:43] comes pictures voices of radio pictures
[1:31:46] on television that our senses does not
[1:31:49] contact but yet they have a tuber
[1:31:51] Crystal that picks up those ether waves
[1:31:53] and manifest them so you see right in
[1:31:56] this building now is live actions of
[1:31:59] people in the air live voices they're
[1:32:02] here we know it they're absolutely truth
[1:32:04] the only thing they catch it on I don't
[1:32:06] understand the mechanics of those things
[1:32:08] that science has invented but we know
[1:32:09] that it proves to us that there's a
[1:32:12] fourth
[1:32:14] dimension now I could take an entire
[1:32:16] teaching on that because I believe we
[1:32:19] should as Believers have dimensional
[1:32:22] discernment and in other words we should
[1:32:24] discern the things that we're feeding
[1:32:27] upon what are they doing and what effect
[1:32:29] are they having in our life I believe
[1:32:32] one of the greatest problems and one of
[1:32:34] the greatest reasons why we fail the
[1:32:37] Lord the way that we do sometimes all
[1:32:40] comes down to our spiritual diet and
[1:32:44] appetite I know that's so profound isn't
[1:32:47] it it's so
[1:32:50] simple it all comes down to what are we
[1:32:53] feeding on listen friends if the only
[1:32:55] time you hear quotes of God's Prophet is
[1:32:57] when you are in church I promise you you
[1:32:59] will be a spiritually unhealthy believer
[1:33:03] the prophet of God said in the church AG
[1:33:04] book no believer no believer is any more
[1:33:08] spiritually healthy than he than his
[1:33:11] adherence to the word of
[1:33:14] God mhm is not an
[1:33:18] answer no believer is any more
[1:33:21] spiritually healthy than his than his ad
[1:33:23] adherence and obedience is adherence
[1:33:25] brother random says to the word preached
[1:33:28] to the word of God and so I believe with
[1:33:31] all my heart and I just I'm just going
[1:33:33] to lay this in because I feel it from
[1:33:35] the Lord I believe that if we would
[1:33:37] begin as a church as young people not
[1:33:41] just to go throughout the day and do our
[1:33:43] normal things that we do and we get in
[1:33:45] the same routines of life but I believe
[1:33:47] that as as Believers if we would have a
[1:33:50] life dedicated to feeding on the word of
[1:33:53] God it would fix 99% of our
[1:33:57] problems if you would hear the voice on
[1:34:00] the tape I'm talking about the voice of
[1:34:02] God's Prophet if you would make that
[1:34:04] more than just the times you come to
[1:34:06] church but have a daily appetite a daily
[1:34:09] diet it would fix 99% of your problems
[1:34:13] that you have in your life come on
[1:34:15] everybody wants a one quick quick
[1:34:17] solution while I just gave it to
[1:34:19] you it'd fix most of the problems if
[1:34:22] we'd start communing with the Lord
[1:34:24] Opening Our Bibles hearing the voice of
[1:34:27] God hearing the voice of the Lord more
[1:34:29] than just a devotion H devotions are
[1:34:31] great but actually spending time with
[1:34:34] the
[1:34:35] Lord
[1:34:37] amen is that all right New
[1:34:41] Zealand and so notice because brother
[1:34:43] Adam says that man lives in this
[1:34:45] environment I just want to put the take
[1:34:48] the the the shifter here and take it out
[1:34:50] of fifth gear and we're going to put it
[1:34:51] in neutral here for a second all right
[1:34:54] all
[1:34:56] right brother Brandon teaches us man
[1:34:59] lives in this multi-dimensional
[1:35:01] environment and we as human beings are
[1:35:03] subjected to these seven dimensions
[1:35:05] around us at all
[1:35:07] times as the prophet says if you're a
[1:35:10] Christian and a
[1:35:12] Believer and you've been born again and
[1:35:15] he says if you're a Christian and you
[1:35:19] die he says you go into that sixth
[1:35:22] dimension of a place of paradise where
[1:35:26] the dead in Christ go waiting to be and
[1:35:29] go back to being young again in a
[1:35:31] Celestial body waiting for the day when
[1:35:34] Christ shall come back to earth in the
[1:35:36] Rapture and pick up and raise up their
[1:35:39] mortal bodies from the dust of the earth
[1:35:41] to one that's Incorruptible
[1:35:43] Immortal as brother bam says the
[1:35:46] Christian when he dies he's at rest he
[1:35:49] goes to a paradise there's no more
[1:35:51] struggle there's no more suffering in if
[1:35:53] he died his brother alary did such a
[1:35:55] beautiful job on that here today on what
[1:35:58] happens to those that die of their
[1:36:00] sickness listen friends at the moment
[1:36:02] that they breathe their last breath they
[1:36:05] enter into a very real place it's a
[1:36:09] place with mountains it's a place with
[1:36:11] beautiful Skies it's a place with beauty
[1:36:14] it's a place of peace there's no trouble
[1:36:17] there's no worry there's no anxiety
[1:36:20] there there's no stressing out over
[1:36:22] problems
[1:36:24] there's just perfect peace all the
[1:36:26] time and that Christian if he's born
[1:36:28] again he goes into that land of rest
[1:36:31] into that theophany body a body not made
[1:36:34] with hands but a body that's prepared
[1:36:37] the Bible says that Paul said it this
[1:36:39] way if this Earthly Tabernacle is
[1:36:41] dissolved we have one waiting prepared
[1:36:45] for us in the heavens and so there's no
[1:36:48] kind of Meandering or just stuck or lost
[1:36:51] somewhere that Christian goes to a real
[1:36:54] place and brother bandham says oh my
[1:36:56] brother my sister he says to when I got
[1:36:58] over there and I seen that he says no
[1:37:00] word could describe it no no word in the
[1:37:03] human dictionary could describe that
[1:37:05] place Sublime wouldn't even begin to
[1:37:07] touch it the prophets begin to get so
[1:37:09] wrapped up in it he says all I can say
[1:37:11] to you is whatever you do in your life
[1:37:14] don't miss
[1:37:16] it whatever you do in your life no
[1:37:19] matter what you think is important right
[1:37:21] now oh I just want to preach here for a
[1:37:24] moment you might think your education is
[1:37:26] the most important thing you might think
[1:37:28] your spouse or who you're going to marry
[1:37:30] or what where where you're going to live
[1:37:32] I just want to say to you there is
[1:37:33] nothing more important than you meet the
[1:37:36] Lord Jesus for yourself there is nothing
[1:37:39] that you can give up nothing that you
[1:37:41] can turn aside and sacrifice that is
[1:37:44] worth heaven and Eternity it's a real
[1:37:47] place it's a real land a land just
[1:37:50] beyond this reach of mortal King
[1:37:54] just beyond this Dimension the prophet
[1:37:57] of God said they enter into that real
[1:37:59] place it's a Believer where a Believer
[1:38:02] goes and brother Bram says oh they're at
[1:38:05] rest they're in that body of rest one
[1:38:09] day they'll come back to that body we
[1:38:12] laid in the grave and stored that body
[1:38:14] and the prophet says they'll take that
[1:38:16] body it'll be glor it'll be it'll be
[1:38:18] it'll be changed and he says and that
[1:38:20] theophany body and that Earthly body
[1:38:23] will come together and make up a
[1:38:24] glorified body Incorruptible
[1:38:28] Immortal brother bam says oh but if you
[1:38:33] die a
[1:38:35] sinner if you
[1:38:37] die having never surrendered your life
[1:38:40] to the Lord
[1:38:42] Jesus now remember the prophet of God
[1:38:44] said I'm going to make this so so so so
[1:38:48] it may seem narrow but I'm going to make
[1:38:49] it just the way brother brandham
[1:38:52] did remember remember that
[1:38:54] to to be apathetic towards
[1:38:58] him not to not to just say I don't want
[1:39:01] anything to do with him but just to shun
[1:39:04] him and not respond to Grace the prophet
[1:39:07] say is the same as rejecting him yeah
[1:39:11] right so just to have an apathetic heart
[1:39:14] or to say uh not right now maybe later
[1:39:19] but not right
[1:39:22] now because brother Adam says if you die
[1:39:25] and you're a sinner and you never in
[1:39:28] your life you've missed or failed to
[1:39:32] heed the
[1:39:34] grace that God has extended to
[1:39:38] you I think sometimes we're not aware of
[1:39:43] how many times Grace knocks on our door
[1:39:49] amen I think we're not aware of how many
[1:39:52] times you you just you you you think
[1:39:54] it's Mom and you think it's Dad and oh
[1:39:57] it's just just just what the way that
[1:39:59] they are you don't recognize that behind
[1:40:02] that voice of that mother that father
[1:40:04] that Pastor that preacher behind all of
[1:40:07] their behind all of what you see
[1:40:09] externally is the outstretched arms of
[1:40:12] the Lord Jesus trying to reach you by
[1:40:17] Grace if you're a sinner and you never
[1:40:20] repented of your sins and accepted the
[1:40:22] Lord as your personal Lord and
[1:40:27] Savior you go to a place called The
[1:40:29] Fifth Dimension it's where the souls of
[1:40:32] the wicked are imprisoned awaiting the
[1:40:34] great final great white Throne judgment
[1:40:38] to be judged according to the Deeds Done
[1:40:41] in their body I just want to say this
[1:40:43] because the Apostle Paul said all of
[1:40:47] us shall
[1:40:49] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:40:53] doesn't matter how rich you are doesn't
[1:40:56] matter how educated you are rich man
[1:40:58] will stand there popular men will stand
[1:41:01] there movie stars will stand there
[1:41:03] presidents will stand there dictators
[1:41:05] will stand there doesn't matter what
[1:41:07] their stature was in life death does not
[1:41:13] discriminate all of us the Bible says
[1:41:16] will stand before the Judgment seat of
[1:41:18] Christ you will not choose whether you
[1:41:21] stand before the judgment seat you will
[1:41:24] only choose when you stand before that
[1:41:26] judgment seat of Christ because to the
[1:41:29] born again the Judgment seat is the word
[1:41:31] of God and it's judging your life now
[1:41:35] and you in this Dimension have the
[1:41:37] opportunity right now to stand before
[1:41:40] the Judgment seat of Christ and say
[1:41:42] judge me oh God and if there's anything
[1:41:44] in my life that is displeasing to you
[1:41:47] then strip it out of my life strip it
[1:41:50] out of my spirit oh God I don't want it
[1:41:52] anymore I take my pride as the prophet
[1:41:55] said and I stomp it under my feet I take
[1:41:58] all of my anger and my temper and my
[1:42:01] jealousy and my lust and I say I don't
[1:42:03] want it anymore God Judge Me Oh God by
[1:42:06] your word and let me be judged by a
[1:42:09] righteous God who can give me his
[1:42:15] righteousness but one day those who have
[1:42:18] never heed that will stand before the
[1:42:21] Judgment seat of God
[1:42:25] and brother bam says this this way in
[1:42:26] the next
[1:42:27] slide this Fifth Dimension is where the
[1:42:30] center the unbeliever dies and goes to
[1:42:33] The Fifth Dimension is the kind of well
[1:42:36] the horrible
[1:42:38] Dimension when a Christian dies he goes
[1:42:41] to the sixth Dimension and God is in the
[1:42:43] seventh Dimension now then you see the
[1:42:47] Christian when he dies he goes under the
[1:42:50] altar of God right into the presence of
[1:42:53] God Under The Altar and he's at rest to
[1:42:58] break it
[1:43:00] down when a man has a
[1:43:02] nightmare and he's not altogether asleep
[1:43:06] nor is he awake he's between sleep and
[1:43:09] awake and that's what makes him have a
[1:43:11] horrible shaking and screaming because
[1:43:13] he's not asleep he's not awake and to
[1:43:15] take that shows where a man goes when he
[1:43:19] dies unconverted
[1:43:25] he's lived his time
[1:43:28] up he's dead on the earth he can't go
[1:43:31] into the presence of God he's not fit to
[1:43:34] go there without the
[1:43:35] blood and he's
[1:43:39] caught he can't come back to earth
[1:43:42] because his time's finished on Earth and
[1:43:45] he's caught
[1:43:47] between couldn't
[1:43:50] imagine that there would be people
[1:43:54] that sat in church
[1:43:57] services and with their mortal ears
[1:44:00] heard the voice of God and for whatever
[1:44:04] they valued
[1:44:05] more like Felix when he heard the
[1:44:08] preaching of Paul and Paul the Bible
[1:44:10] says he fell under the conviction of his
[1:44:12] sermon and right at the moment at that
[1:44:14] that moment when he was ready to
[1:44:16] surrender the Bible says Felix said
[1:44:18] leave me Paul for at a more convenient
[1:44:21] time I'll call for you
[1:44:24] the Bible never records whatever happens
[1:44:26] to him only God knows but I couldn't
[1:44:29] imagine that a person who could live and
[1:44:32] sit in message churches and hear sermons
[1:44:34] and hear the preaching of the word of
[1:44:36] God have mothers and fathers who pray
[1:44:38] for them and talk and pray for them and
[1:44:40] send them to
[1:44:42] camps how could they ever end up caught
[1:44:47] stuck he's in a
[1:44:50] nightmare he can't go into the presence
[1:44:52] of God to rest he can't come back to
[1:44:54] earth because it's time up he's in a
[1:44:56] nightmare and there he stays until the
[1:44:58] day of
[1:45:01] judgment prophet of God sees it and he's
[1:45:05] shot with the gun he's in that hospital
[1:45:07] bed and going in and out of
[1:45:09] Consciousness and he says I then began
[1:45:12] to fall out and he says I just fell
[1:45:14] through the bed and he says and it just
[1:45:16] felt like I was falling and falling and
[1:45:20] falling and he says down in there I seen
[1:45:22] the faces of those women with that dark
[1:45:25] makeup around their eyes and hands
[1:45:27] reaching out and brother Bron begins to
[1:45:29] cry out to God and he says oh god oh if
[1:45:32] you'll just deliver me out of here out
[1:45:33] of this place he said all I could say to
[1:45:36] God at that moment was Lord I I've tried
[1:45:38] to do good I I I've tried to never tell
[1:45:40] a lie and he says oh he says every time
[1:45:43] I tried to get something out I couldn't
[1:45:44] hardly get it out of my mouth and he
[1:45:46] just begin to cry out to God he says God
[1:45:48] if you could ever if you'd just save me
[1:45:50] from this Lord I'll serve you the rest
[1:45:52] of my life
[1:45:54] life brother bams later in tucon and
[1:45:57] he's in JC Pennies and he sees those
[1:45:59] Hispanic sis women coming down the
[1:46:01] escalator speaking another language and
[1:46:03] he says I fell right back under that
[1:46:05] Vision seeing that horrible place of
[1:46:07] Hell friends I don't think it's an
[1:46:09] accident that we had a messenger who not
[1:46:12] only went to the other side beyond the
[1:46:14] curtain of time but he also went to hell
[1:46:17] and he went there to tell you don't ever
[1:46:19] find yourself there young person don't
[1:46:21] ever find yourself fall there is a it's
[1:46:24] a bottomless pit you don't ever want to
[1:46:26] find yourself
[1:46:28] there and he says oh but here in that
[1:46:31] same place the BAM talks about this and
[1:46:35] he says I had my hands there on my bed
[1:46:38] and he says I had my hands behind my
[1:46:40] head and he says I laid down on my
[1:46:41] pillow and says oh oh Bill
[1:46:44] brandom if you're ever going to do
[1:46:46] anything for the Lord you better get
[1:46:48] started I think of that brother Al and I
[1:46:50] think my goodness
[1:46:53] if he ain't done nothing for the Lord at
[1:46:55] that point then what have I done if I
[1:46:57] was there in that room I'd say brother
[1:46:59] brandham what are you talking about
[1:47:01] you're the ministry that's went around
[1:47:02] the world seven times raised the dead
[1:47:04] blind eyes open crutches and hospital
[1:47:07] beds and Cs and and and and and he's
[1:47:10] looking to do more for the kingdom of
[1:47:12] God and brother bandam says he's just
[1:47:15] lay there he says he says I heard that
[1:47:18] voice and he says I begin to he starts
[1:47:21] singing that song to feel Lonesome and
[1:47:23] blue and and he says I heard that voice
[1:47:27] and it just spoke to me and says would
[1:47:29] you like to look beyond the
[1:47:32] curtain and I love how brother brandom
[1:47:34] says that he says oh it would help me so
[1:47:39] much I just want to tell brother
[1:47:41] brandham one day it helped me so
[1:47:47] much and the prophet of God says I
[1:47:49] believe that in this Vision I I believe
[1:47:52] I was called to that sixth Dimension you
[1:47:54] go to the next one if you could and he
[1:47:57] says looking back down here I could see
[1:48:00] back and you see sight isn't exactly
[1:48:03] with the eyes that's Earthly but sight
[1:48:04] is greater thing the sight that they
[1:48:06] have there their contact is far beyond
[1:48:08] any contact that our natural senses
[1:48:10] would
[1:48:11] contact and so brother Bron begins to
[1:48:14] relate this how that he goes there and
[1:48:16] he says I seen people and the begin he
[1:48:19] says they were long flowing hair the
[1:48:21] sisters had and gowns flowing down and
[1:48:24] he says and there he says they they were
[1:48:26] running up to me saying oh our our
[1:48:28] precious brother our precious
[1:48:30] brother oh I don't I don't want to take
[1:48:33] too much time but we could just preach
[1:48:34] on this here all all night
[1:48:36] tonight it was such a wonderful place
[1:48:39] brother brandham says he says oh I just
[1:48:41] didn't want to go back and and and here
[1:48:44] and I was just reading it here today and
[1:48:46] that mean by the hour Fellowship hour is
[1:48:48] fellowshipping on this what brother
[1:48:50] randam sees there and there's his wife
[1:48:52] and and you know all the things that he
[1:48:53] seen there was his chair there was his
[1:48:57] chair that he
[1:48:59] lost couldn't pay the bill and they took
[1:49:01] it from
[1:49:03] him but you see everything you lose on
[1:49:06] this
[1:49:07] side you gain on that
[1:49:10] side you see that's a land without loss
[1:49:14] it's a land of only
[1:49:16] gain and brother bham says oh he says uh
[1:49:19] he says do I have to go back he says he
[1:49:22] yes you you have to go back and and and
[1:49:25] and he says and one day we'll come to
[1:49:27] you you know that you know the story
[1:49:28] very very well the way he tells
[1:49:30] it and the prophet of God begins to
[1:49:33] relate that and he begins to talk about
[1:49:35] how that that voice told him and he says
[1:49:38] I don't understand and he says all that
[1:49:39] you loved and all that you ever loved
[1:49:43] God has given it to
[1:49:46] you what a contrast this was between
[1:49:49] that place of
[1:49:51] hell and that place beyond the other
[1:49:54] curtain just on the other
[1:49:57] side the prophet of God says I just want
[1:50:00] to say to you whatever you do lay
[1:50:03] aside
[1:50:06] everything doesn't matter what you put
[1:50:08] in that bucket doesn't matter what you
[1:50:10] put in that list lay aside
[1:50:13] everything until you get perfect love in
[1:50:17] your heart to where you can love
[1:50:19] everybody you can love even your enemy
[1:50:23] and brother bham says whatever you do
[1:50:25] friend don't miss it don't miss
[1:50:30] it don't fail to heed the opportunity
[1:50:35] when Grace reaches out and stretches out
[1:50:38] a arm a hand of Mercy to pick you
[1:50:42] up don't think that you'll have another
[1:50:45] moment I have more life to live you
[1:50:47] don't have that promise in fact none of
[1:50:50] us have that promise none of us have a
[1:50:53] promise everyone thinks they'll just
[1:50:54] live and go on and on and on and on and
[1:50:59] on never never would have
[1:51:04] dreamed that a life could be cut off so
[1:51:07] short that a life could just be just
[1:51:10] like that could just be
[1:51:13] taken you don't know what's happening
[1:51:15] you don't know what faces you
[1:51:17] tomorrow you don't know what Waits you
[1:51:20] when you leave this Youth Camp yeah
[1:51:22] that's
[1:51:25] right the prophet of God says that even
[1:51:27] he himself I know I quoted this the
[1:51:29] first night says I should have came to
[1:51:31] the Lord long before I did but a spirit
[1:51:33] hung over me and told me I had more
[1:51:37] time I could not imagine much things
[1:51:41] worse as I sat here and pondered as the
[1:51:43] Lord began to deal with my heart on this
[1:51:46] sermon and I was just writing these
[1:51:49] notes and just so affected by the by the
[1:51:53] the loss that we
[1:51:54] experienced and I just said I could I
[1:51:57] could not
[1:51:58] imagine you know something worse could
[1:52:01] you imagine anything worse than going to
[1:52:04] hell could you imagine living your whole
[1:52:08] life and then ending up in this place
[1:52:11] that wasn't even made for
[1:52:13] you the prophet of God says it this way
[1:52:16] he says God will never condemn a man and
[1:52:20] send him to hell for being a sinner
[1:52:23] because he had no choice but he says
[1:52:26] what will condemn the man is that he
[1:52:29] remained a sinner and he didn't have
[1:52:32] to he says in another place if you ever
[1:52:35] do go to hell you will have to climb
[1:52:38] over every barrier you will have to Bar
[1:52:41] barge over every barricade oh friend
[1:52:44] sometimes I wonder sometimes what are we
[1:52:46] doing with our life a and and you
[1:52:48] wouldn't get in the car and go down the
[1:52:50] road and and say road closed and
[1:52:52] barricade and just take your car and
[1:52:54] just Barrel through those barricades and
[1:52:56] Barrel through those signs Broken Road
[1:52:59] broken bridge do not enter do not cross
[1:53:02] wrong way when any of us get in our car
[1:53:04] and just Barrel over but how many times
[1:53:07] does God send warning sign after warning
[1:53:09] sign after warning sign in our life and
[1:53:12] he saying sermon after sermon after
[1:53:14] sermon and yet we just keep going
[1:53:15] through it and keep going through it and
[1:53:17] keep going through it
[1:53:23] today as the Bible says is the day of
[1:53:26] salvation Harden not your
[1:53:30] hearts couldn't imagine anything worse
[1:53:32] then I said
[1:53:34] no no there's something much worse than
[1:53:37] hell there's something so much worse you
[1:53:40] say how could it be worse for the that
[1:53:42] that place in that horrible Dimension
[1:53:44] like a nightmare and he's stuck what
[1:53:46] could be
[1:53:48] worse what would be worse than hell
[1:53:53] would be the voices like that rich man
[1:53:55] in Lazarus
[1:53:57] was like that rich young ruler who
[1:53:59] brother Brandon says Jesus looking upon
[1:54:02] Him loved
[1:54:05] him and he says what must I do to
[1:54:07] inherit eternal life sell all you have
[1:54:10] that may not been the the remedy for
[1:54:12] everybody but God knew what his God was
[1:54:15] and he knew what he wasn't willing to
[1:54:17] let go
[1:54:19] of and you could imagine as he he hears
[1:54:22] the voice brother Bram says you don't
[1:54:23] change death doesn't change you it only
[1:54:26] changes your dwelling
[1:54:29] place and who you are here you will be
[1:54:33] there and the prophet of God says
[1:54:36] couldn't even he could hear that voice
[1:54:38] the voice of him telling go get Lazar go
[1:54:40] get a go go you know go go send them
[1:54:44] Lazarus and and the the the voice says
[1:54:46] even though one raised from the dead
[1:54:48] they still wouldn't
[1:54:50] believe I couldn't imagine anything
[1:54:53] worse than hell until I imagine having
[1:54:55] to be there and think about all the
[1:54:58] opportunities that I had in my life to
[1:55:01] surrender my whole heart to
[1:55:05] God I couldn't imagine anything worse
[1:55:08] than hearing the voices of preachers and
[1:55:10] ministers and parents and people that
[1:55:12] loved me and prayed for me and yet
[1:55:15] knowing I missed my
[1:55:17] opportunity you say surely brother Matt
[1:55:19] that's terrible oh but there's something
[1:55:21] much worse you say worse than going to
[1:55:24] hell worse than knowing the
[1:55:25] opportunities you miss what could be
[1:55:27] worse than that what would be worse than
[1:55:30] that is not just me being there but all
[1:55:34] of those that would be with me there who
[1:55:37] I failed to tell about Jesus who I
[1:55:40] failed to tell about his love and his
[1:55:42] compassion and his
[1:55:43] Mercy it would be all those who I left
[1:55:47] an imprint in my life and an impact and
[1:55:50] my impact of my life never affected them
[1:55:54] in a way that they would come to the
[1:55:56] Lord Jesus themselves I couldn't imagine
[1:55:59] anything worse than my family who I had
[1:56:02] led and who I had loved and my children
[1:56:06] couldn't imagine brother Al anything
[1:56:07] worse until I think of the voices and
[1:56:09] the people that would be there in that
[1:56:12] place with
[1:56:13] me oh my brother and my sister can I
[1:56:16] just stay here
[1:56:18] tonight there's nothing more important
[1:56:23] in your
[1:56:24] life that you know
[1:56:27] him not about him not his dress code not
[1:56:32] his Doctrine not his
[1:56:33] teachings but you know the
[1:56:36] author for
[1:56:39] yourself because when you know
[1:56:42] him you have all of his promises you
[1:56:46] have all of his benefits you say brother
[1:56:48] Matt do you live a perfect life no I
[1:56:50] don't do you ever have trouble trouble
[1:56:52] all the time tribulation on a daily
[1:56:54] basis trials weekly but here's what I
[1:56:57] have I have precious promises I have
[1:57:00] hope that my hope is not in this life
[1:57:02] and in this world and in this government
[1:57:04] and in this world system but I have a
[1:57:06] promise of a home just beyond the reach
[1:57:08] of mortal kin just beyond the last
[1:57:11] breath is a real place and a real home
[1:57:13] with real people living real lives as
[1:57:15] brother bam says that life is just a
[1:57:18] continuation of this life but without
[1:57:20] the struggle without the pain without
[1:57:23] the
[1:57:25] torment oh don't you want to go to that
[1:57:27] place my brother my
[1:57:29] sister and I thought about my I thought
[1:57:32] about this as I just the Lord begin to
[1:57:34] deal with my heart I couldn't imagine
[1:57:37] anything better than
[1:57:43] Heaven I couldn't imagine anything
[1:57:46] better than heaven but can I tell you
[1:57:49] that just as there's something worse
[1:57:50] than hell there's something better than
[1:57:52] going to heaven you say what is
[1:57:55] something better going to heaven brother
[1:57:56] Matt all those that I love and that
[1:57:59] loved me all my children all my family
[1:58:03] all of my loved ones you say what's
[1:58:05] better than going to heaven all of those
[1:58:07] that I've prayed for there in that
[1:58:10] Eternal home with me and there's no more
[1:58:12] pain and there's no more struggle oh
[1:58:14] does anybody feel the way that I feel
[1:58:16] here tonight there will be nothing
[1:58:18] greater on that day I'm looking forward
[1:58:21] uh to that place but it's not the place
[1:58:24] it's who's in that place because beyond
[1:58:27] all my loved ones is the Lord Jesus and
[1:58:29] one day I'll look upon him the one
[1:58:32] that's loved me when I was unlovable the
[1:58:34] one that saved me when I was unsavable
[1:58:37] and one day when I see him oh I can only
[1:58:40] imagine what I will do on that day when

[1:59:10] Jesus he
[1:59:13] cares he cared
[1:59:17] enough for a woman it was a little girl
[1:59:22] she rejected the Lord as a
[1:59:27] teenager she then entered her 20s and
[1:59:31] never came to the Lord entered her 30s
[1:59:34] and still never surrendered her heart
[1:59:36] only got harder as the further she
[1:59:39] went in her
[1:59:41] 50s she strayed from the Lord still
[1:59:44] running as hard as she
[1:59:47] could even past her 50s she went into
[1:59:49] her 60s that way
[1:59:54] but can I tell you about a
[1:59:56] god who's full of
[1:59:59] grace he's not willing that any should
[2:00:01] perish but that all should come to
[2:00:03] life brother bandham sees that woman
[2:00:06] there and he doesn't recognize her and
[2:00:10] she says brother brandom you led me to

[2:00:21] grace

[2:01:16] don't want to be influenced how many
[2:01:18] could say Lord I don't want to be
[2:01:19] influenced by a dimension of depress
[2:01:21] depression and fear and worry and doubt
[2:01:24] and struggle I want to open the
[2:01:26] dimension to angels and say angels of
[2:01:29] God come and Quicken my spirit minister

[2:01:50] there's love and peace and hope and
[2:01:52] Harmony and joy forgiveness is
[2:01:58] there that unforgiving heart Jesus can
[2:02:01] heal it right now don't let that thing
[2:02:04] that root of bitterness the Bible says
[2:02:06] spring up and Def thereby defile many
[2:02:09] don't let it take you brother don't let
[2:02:12] that root of hatred don't let that that

[2:02:31] them both of my hands are up God just as
[2:02:34] a sign of
[2:02:35] surrender surrendering to you Lord I
[2:02:39] wonder if there' just be
[2:02:41] one maybe more than
[2:02:44] one and not to me but to the Lord in a
[2:02:47] personal
[2:02:48] way you just say Lord I want to know you

[2:02:54] tonight if Lord I want to know you I
[2:02:57] want to know that I know Salvation true
[2:03:00] salvation is not a hope so my brother
[2:03:03] it's a no so and you might have came to
[2:03:06] this camp with a hope so but God can
[2:03:08] give you a no so you can live with a
[2:03:10] knowing faith that you know you have
[2:03:13] passed from Death unto life you say
[2:03:15] brother Matt does that mean I'm free
[2:03:16] from faults no it doesn't the battle
[2:03:18] just begins does that mean I'm free of
[2:03:20] struggles no it doesn't that just means
[2:03:22] the struggle really begins it only means
[2:03:24] now you have a helper you have a teacher
[2:03:26] you have a guide you have a redeemer you
[2:03:29] have a savior you have one who can
[2:03:30] deliver you from Temptation when you
[2:03:32] need to Deliverance he can make a way of
[2:03:34] Escape all you got to do is Surrender
[2:03:37] Your Heart To That Loving Lord Jesus he
[2:03:39] can change what you can't change he's
[2:03:42] not going to reform you he comes with
[2:03:44] transform transforming power that'll
[2:03:46] transform you from who you was to who
[2:03:49] God really made you to be I want wonder
[2:03:51] if you'd surrender to that God here
[2:03:56] tonight I pray
[2:03:59] Lord that the words that we've spoken
[2:04:02] tonight God I believe that they found
[2:04:06] their resting place they hit their Mark
[2:04:09] Lord and maybe even here tonight God
[2:04:13] maybe one life came in this building and
[2:04:16] it was on a course a road going down a
[2:04:19] highway maybe unbeknownst to them a
[2:04:21] Highway leading to burdens
[2:04:24] and scars
[2:04:27] and maybe even some
[2:04:30] unrecoverable but tonight
[2:04:34] Lord I wonder if they just say God would
[2:04:37] you rewrite my
[2:04:40] life would you rewrite let Mercy come
[2:04:44] and rewrite my
[2:04:45] story my story is not going to end I

[2:04:56] it's passed you it's in the past The
[2:04:57] Best Is Yet To Come for You young person
[2:05:00] the best is not behind you the best is
[2:05:02] right in front of you oh don't you
[2:05:04] believe that lie of that demon Spirit
[2:05:06] trying to tell you that the best is
[2:05:08] right in front of you young person if
[2:05:10] you'd only surrender to the plan that
[2:05:12] God's made for your life your failure is
[2:05:15] not final it's just the beginning of God
[2:05:17] right in your testimony and you might be
[2:05:20] a future preacher you might be a future
[2:05:22] Deacon you might be might be that you
[2:05:24] are the future family of the Living God
[2:05:27] God wants something he wants to express
[2:05:29] out of your life but first he just needs
[2:05:31] a heart that'll fully surrender to him
