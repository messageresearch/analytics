to thank the song leader stephen just simon surrey really appreciated that very much and amen we love to worship amen god bless you musicians we love to praise our god amen he is worthy of our praise amen we're just so thankful and privileged to be able to be here this morning not just to gather with one another but together with the presence of the lord jesus christ and with the revelation of our lord jesus christ amen so it's a real honor and privilege i just want to uh as brother elroy i just want to um thank brother elray for the invitation to um come over with kind of in debt to him a little bit we've had him over a few times now and haven't been able to return the favor and i know it's more than a favor but um i just appreciate your pastor very much brother rey and um just the french friendship and the lord his loyalty and uh he's the gift that god's placed within him i just appreciate it so much it's um it's been a real benefit to our little fellowship back at home and uh you know god places people around you for specific reasons to me to meet specific needs and we may not all see things the same way but nevertheless god has a way of providing people around us to help us encourage us and perhaps even meet the needs in our own lives through the gift that god has placed within us and we understand that as a body it's not just the pastor that has the gifting he's got a gift sure but every member of the body of christ is a gifted member of the body of christ and uh your gift may not be a pulpit ministry and you should be thankful for that but uh but nevertheless um if if god has placed you within the body of christ every member of the body has a part to play in every service whether you're here or not here you know if you're not here not able to be here perhaps you're working you know you can you can still pray while you're working lord just be with the service tonight and you know that's that's how you can help the service be what god ordained it to be because god does have a vision for today god has a vision for this morning and one man can't bring that vision to pass but god has seen who was going to be here who wasn't going to be here but everyone that he saw here this morning he knew they would be here therefore each one of you have a part to play in what the service might be because really we don't know what the service is going to be because what depending on what our sister's need is over here she can she can actually govern what comes out of the minister's mouth by pulling on the gift and then there's a brother over this side and he can go from from a to zed you know from left to right because there's a pull over this side you know it's not that we need to know each other's problems if god knows our issues god knows our needs and this is why we learn to surrender we learn to become the instrument and uh allow god to to to push the notes and and uh govern what comes out of the instrument and uh brother eric certainly been that in our fellowship just a real help uh to the brothers and sisters back at home his precious wife also just a real encouragement to to my wife and um i think if there's ever a wife that needs encouraging it's a pastor's wife but we we thank the lord for the people that he's put us in contact with brother paul god bless you this morning brother good to see you amen praise the lord i don't often catch everyone within the congregation my wife will ask would someone say there this morning and i say i don't know she said well you were standing up the front [Laughter] and then i'll say no she wasn't there and and she'll send a text and say just wondering if you're okay and she'll say no i was there i'm fine i praise the lord amen amen amen well i trust this morning will be a blessing to you and and uh as we discontinue with our a little thought this morning and and um i can only bring what god places on my heart and and um as simple as it might be to me that to me the simple because i'm a simple guy the simple things become really big and uh it's um we understand and how god hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same and uh we just want to allow him to do that this morning so let's stand to our feet and turn to the book of uh john chapter one the thought this morning it's it is a continuation from from last night but just looking a little bit more in depth into um the evening time sacrifice as we saw in first kings 18 last night so let's just read from did i say first john i meant john chapter 1 sorry john chapter 1 we'll read from verse 28 we read from verse 29 the next day john saith jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god amen if we can also turn to luke chapter 4 just one verse there the first verse i thank you for your prayers my throat is uh doing very well it feels better today than what it did yesterday so it shouldn't shouldn't be that way but it is that way so praise the lord and jesus been full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness romans chapter 8 we'll read 13 and 14 no i've just got 14 up there but we'll read 13 and 14. for if ye live after the flesh you shall die pretty straightforward huh but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god a heavenly father lord we just commit this service into your hands this morning lord god may you accomplish in this service lord what you ordained to accomplish before the foundation of the world lord we come with needs in our lives perhaps lord god we come bearing the needs of others lord god you are the one who can meet our every need this morning lord god is instruments set aside for your service lord we ask heavenly father that you would lord just go forth and and use the instruments lord god that you have ordained for this time for this day for this service we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen you can take your seats this morning i just want to spend a little bit of time here in in john chapter 1. we um we understand that from first kings 18 that it was an even in an evening time sacrifice where that the lord come down upon in 1st kings 18. and we understand that jesus also was the evening time sacrifice and as the as the consuming fire came down upon the sacrifice that elijah had prepared according to the word of the lord now here in john chapter 1 we have the word of the lord on earth as the evening sacrifice and the evening sacrifice we pick this up here where the spirit of the lord again comes down upon the lamb of god because this is who the sacrifice was or was revealed to be was the lamb of god behold the lamb of god who taketh away the sin of the world so we understand as there was an elijah ministry in first kings 18 so now is there an elijah ministry on earth here at this time through john the baptist the the elijah ministry we understand that from malachi 3 and malachi 4 but we we want to pay particular attention here to how or in in who he was revealed as because he was revealed as a lamb of god amen the lamb of god not our lamb but the lamb of god okay be because this is really important because if something is of something then it has the same characteristics the lamb of god had god's characteristics because it was of god it was the lamb of god okay the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world now we understand here also that john here speaks and he wants the people to understand that how the sacrifice was revealed has been revealed was not his idea because john said i wouldn't have known him i wouldn't have been able to identify him it's not possible it's not me that has said these things it's not me that has revealed the lamb of god i i did not reveal the lamb of god it was god who revealed himself god is the revealer of himself yes god can use instruments to reveal himself god can use nature to reveal himself but in this particular time as it was in the in the time of first kings 18 it was through the elijah ministry that the evening sacrifice was revealed amen because in a shadow form in first kings 18 that uh that that sacrifice was revealed in the form of a stones timber water and ox it was that's that was the mind of god expressed amen as a as a sacrifice i don't know if i've got a let's let me just go forward i'm jumping around a bit here but that picture that we have here that's the mind of god expressed because it was revealed to elijah and all elijah did was make known what god had revealed to him none of this was elijah's work none of it none of it every part of it as we can see there i have done all these things at thy word so all these things everything that we could that we saw last night in our in our service last night it was the mind of god expressed so now when we come back here again there's an evening time sacrifice again and this evening time sacrifice was revealed through an elijah ministry very very important to understand this okay because it wasn't revealed by the clergy it wasn't revealed by anyone else it was revealed by the elijah ministry through an elijah ministry because god does nothing but that he reveals it to his prophets first and john was the ordained prophet for that time and john was the one who the forerunner john was the one who was going to introduce the evening sacrifice the lamb of god who was going to take away the sin of the world that was his duty to introduce the the lamb of god to the world to the people that were around him but someone had to introduce john to the evening sacrifice someone had to introduce john to the in to the sacrifice so that john could introduce the sacrifice to you and i is that right that's that's just exactly how how it works in verse 33 john says i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water see john had a revelation of his position john had a revelation of what he was called to do john had a revelation that he was called to baptize with water john had a revelation that he was sent into the world to fulfill a certain part of god's program and the same one that sent him was the same one who said upon whom ye shall see the spirit of god descending and remain on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost so john was given something to look for john was given a a way that he was going to be able to identify the lamb of god and that was through the spirit of god descending upon him and remaining not an anointing that came and went but came upon him and remained amen this was the identification of the lamb this is how the lamb was identified amen and the sons and daughters of god are they that are led by the spirit of god amen the identification of the bride is when the spirit of god descends upon her and remains that's the identification of the bride but the lord jesus here he was he was revealed as the lamb of god the dove coming down upon the lamb like the fire coming down upon the sacrifice because the sacrifice sorry solomon got the hang of this one the sacrifice couldn't do anything of itself the spirit of god needed to come down upon the sacrifice the consuming fire and it was through this union that the sacrifice achieved what it was able to achieve what it was sent to achieve without the union the sacrifice could not achieve what it was ordained to achieve jesus now been filled with the holy ghost was led into the into the desert to be tempted when jesus comes after that period he comes forth in my own words he says now i am anointed to preach the gospel so now he was because there was a union between the the the because there was a union between the lamb and the dove the sacrifice and the consuming fire now he was anointed to preach the gospel now he was able to go forward in the power of the spirit of god and accomplish the things that he was sent to accomplish as the lamb of god because we find as we did last night that the people were at a crossroad they were they were lame they couldn't move forward well this is the same exact same scenario here that the people were now were now at a place that unless god done something then they just continue in their traditional traditional ways continual you know monday tuesday is monday and wednesday is monday and thursday is monday and ever it's just the same stuff different day but but god wanted them to enter into a another dispensation where they didn't have to do the things that were once required of them he was going to bring them into a new day and the thing that was going to bring them into a new day was the revelation of the sacrifice the revelation of jesus christ will bring you into a new day the revelation of jesus christ here will bring was going to bring the people into a new day a new opportunity monday tuesday doesn't have to be a repeat of monday this is a new day amen this is a day that the lord has made and i know we just say that flippantly but it means so much when you receive a revelation of jesus christ it it brings you into a new day it's like you step into another dimension it's like you step into another world and it today is not the same as yesterday through the revelation of jesus christ we see here in the green there hope you can see that okay yeah it's pretty clear up there it's good in the green elijah's prayer was that that the god in israel would be revealed and we we also see here that john revealed someone who was present okay go elijah's prayer was not lord show the people that thou art the god of israel even though he was but more specifically god in israel amen and when elijah here by the spirit of god was able to reveal the evening sacrifice he revealed the evening sacrifice as someone who was present behold the lamb of god and perhaps the people who were standing around turned to look for a lamb and saw this carpenter's son walking down to john and they they they look back at john and john still had his hand out and they're trying they're looking past the carpenter's son the la the lamb of god the the get out of the way the lamb of god no he he was revealing someone who was present amen and god wants his presence known amen and because it's vitally important because it's it's the revelation of his presence that allows us to step into a new day not not a theological revelation of jesus christ but a revelation of jesus christ being present here amongst us amen not not just in letter form but in a living form amen because it's in the living form that allows you it's a revelation of the living form of jesus christ that allows you to step into a new day it it allows you to do things it allows things to happen in your life that you've wanted to happen for a long time amen if you've been there we'll all say amen to that amen it allows things to happen in your life that you've wanted to happen in your life for a long time amen because god has a purpose for each and every single one of us and it was through this revelation that was going to allow the people to move forward in god's program amen so the lord the lord was there but at 30 years old he was identified by or through an elijah ministry you can kind of imagine that what the people may have been thinking when the revelation struck them i mean he he works at joseph's carpenter's shop you know and trying to connect the lamb of god with the the natural side was a struggle for the people well it's just the same today it hasn't changed and i'm a carpenter but i'm a son of god yeah and i'm not saying that it's difficult for you it might be i don't know but it's difficult for me to come to terms with what god has spoken of me amen because it's not your revelation of me that helps me but it must be a personal revelation to me and it's me that struggles to connect the natural with the spiritual as it was in that day as they looked at jesus said this is joseph's son and now john the baptist the elijah ministry praise god we know who elijah is we know what he was sent for and now he's always said that there was coming one in whom shoe shoe latches i'm not worthy to loose and now he points him out and this is not what i was expecting [Laughter] you understand you see you see the struggle here when the when the revelation of jesus christ comes brethren said when the word is opened a war starts a war begins you know and when the revelation of jesus christ strikes a war starts amen but it's not me battling against you or you battling against me it's me battling against me yeah it's me battle against me trying to come to terms with what god has spoken and you know then we go down this track of trying to look for some evidence that will justify what elijah said and da da da da da and we end up you know we end up lost somewhere and what what god wants us to do is just to accept his word and allow him to reveal what he has spoken to us personally amen so we just want to allow god to reveal himself here this morning amen i hope i'm not standing on a bit of dangerous ground here but brother elrey and i are good mates and if if i if i'm wrong in any way i'd give brother ellery full liberty to to come and um correct me or what whatever whatever is necessary but it's very interesting to me people's ideas on or of the revelation of jesus christ and this is just my thoughts okay but personally i think unknowingly hollywood has influenced our imagery of what jesus christ looks like today or looked like then and um i don't say that critically but i you know there's so many superheroes today and you know they they wear the cape and they wear the the s on the front or whatever it might be and some form of have some super power that identifies them and makes them possible to be able to do things that no one else can do and everyone becomes reliant upon a superhero and yet god is my god is my superhero there's no question about that but what i'm saying is that the imagery that we have of the revelation of jesus christ i believe for myself speaking from experience that it can become distorted it can become something that it's not meant to be because of a outside influence that comes as a result of being in this world yeah and i i don't go to the movies just in case you're wondering but you know you can't help but but um but come in contact with hollywood you don't have to go to the movies to come in contact with hollywood but um but through the revelation of jesus christ and through this by the spirit of god we we want to know him exactly as he is known because he has revealed himself the same as he revealed himself god revealed the evening time sacrifice to elijah and god has also revealed the evening time sacrifice in this hour through an elijah ministry but we want to focus this morning on the the lamb of god here we see here that that the lamb of god i know this is very um obvious but it it's important that he was revealed the lamb of god was revealed as a man a lamb but a man which means he was a ram because redemption comes through the mail it could he he couldn't he at this stage of his ministry he couldn't be revealed as the the female sheep or female lamb he had to be revealed as the male lamb he had to be revealed as the boaz amen because boaz this was a part of his ministry but this part of his ministry he had to fulfill this part of his ministry as a ram it was a ram that was caught in the thicket when abraham went to sacrifice isaac it wasn't a u e w e i like that it wasn't a u it was a ram amen because the redemption could only come through the mail it can only come through the ram so it was the ram that that died in isaac's place it made it possible for eyes for abraham to remove isaac off the altar and take the provided sacrifice the ram and place it on the altar and the ram become the sacrifice instead of isaac okay so there was a a part of the ministry part of our lord jesus christ ministry that could that could only be fulfilled in a male context as a realm because the revelation of jesus christ continues today but the revelation of jesus christ today is not as a ram but as a you but this portion of his ministry could not be fulfilled as a you it could only be fulfilled as a ram so he was a lamb but he was a male lamb he was a ram this lamb the lamb of god was without blemish is that right he had no fault no fault was found in him and it's not that they couldn't find a fault they couldn't find the fault there was no fault to find it didn't matter how long they examined him there was no fault to find so he was not faultless because his fault was hidden behind something there was no fault to find he was examined but it didn't matter how long they examined him for they would have never have found a fault because there was no fault he was the perfect lamb of god amen he had to be the perfect lamb of god in order to take away the sin of the world amen so this is a beautiful picture we have here jesus christ represented as the lamb of god as the lamb and god the father as the dove by these two figures god chose to identify himself not himself himself by the union of these two he chose to reveal himself these two became one these two became one through a union and now god was going to reveal himself just read you something here how beautiful it's typed here as jesus being the lamb and god being the dove and the dove would not have settled on a wolf his nature's not right it couldn't have settled on a dog his nature's not right it had to be on a lamb the two natures are the same the two natures had to be the same and that's the way we have to be our natures has to be changed from the roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb amen our natures has to be changed our natures has to be changed from the roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb and did you notice the dove led the lamb and notice the lamb forfeited everything he had to the dove the lamb knew his position youth he reigned in his position as a lamb the lamb forfeited everything he had to the dove and look where the dove led him to crucifixion of for the sins of us all now the dove god wanted to represent his son he represented he was represented by the most cleanest and meekest animal on the earth a earth-bound creature a earth-bound creature but when god represented himself in the heavens was by the meekest and most cleanest bird there is in the heavens a dove so god represented his son as a lamb and he represented himself as the dove and the dove and the lamb we're going to come together in a union so the groom is a lamb because the lamb of god was our groom amen he's my husband he's my boaz and he had to come forth and pay the price for my redemption amen so he came forth as a lamb the groom is a lamb my husband is a lamb you ever wonder why it says the marriage of the lamb has come not marriage of the lambs marriage of the lamb the marriage of the lamb has come the groom was a lamb the lamb of god will marry a lamb of god because god will not unequally yoke himself he can only join himself to something that is a part of him amen so the lamb of god is going to marry a lamb of god the lamb of god is is in it the groom is the ram the lamb of god as a bride is a you and through the through this union something is going to be produced he cannot join himself with something that is not a part of himself and this is very significant here because their natures were the same the nature of the lamb and the nature of the dove were the same and this is why there could be a union and there's going there is a union between the bride and the groom today and the reason that there's a union the way that there's a union is because the nature of the bride is the same nature of the groom the the nature of the the groom has taken on the nature of the lamb the nature of her groom the bride has taken on the nature of the groom what a magnificent thought you know these things about being unequally yoked you know we we can apply them to our natural lives but we've got to understand that there's a spiritual application to these things as well and there's a mystery behind it as adam married eve who was a part of him really what adam was doing was marrying a part of himself because he couldn't marry any other part he could only marry a part of himself and the second adam can only marry a part of himself really he is marrying a part of himself because when he went to calvary as the prophet says male and female husband and wife bride and groom had not been separated yet but there came a place of separation there came a time of separation but the separation doesn't change our characteristics he's coming back for his own he's redeeming his own he's marrying his own he's yoking himself with his own what the groom is the bride is if he is a lamb the bride has to be a lamb because he's not going to marry a goat he will only marry a part of himself that's why the woman is a revelation to the man the man has a revelation of her the man has a revelation of his wife and he goes forward and declares that revelation will you marry me that's that's his revelation expressed and god has a revelation of you and he comes to you and and asks you will you go why because the rebecca she's a revelation to isaac and you are a revelation to your groom and then through that he becomes a revelation to us it's two things meeting together two revelations coming together the marriage of the lamb the marriage of the lamb husband and wife the marriage of the lamb two people standing up at the altar the marriage of the lamb not the marriage of the lambs no it's the marriage of the lamb she is just a mystery that has been revealed and taken from him but she is still a part of him it's a marriage of the lamb why it had to be shepherds they said john how did you know it i didn't see one thing different but i bear record i saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and a voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in watch the dove and the lamb see yeah what what if it had been what if it had been something what if it had been a wolf standing there well the lamb could not have went down or that dove god symbolizing himself with a dove the most meekest of all the birds of heaven his son by a sheep the most meekest of all the animals on earth see the clean bird of the heavens not a crow not a vulture but a dove not a pig but a lamb any other nature wouldn't have blended together the same natures were coming together notice when the dove came down upon the lamb it led him not the way he would but the way the father would lead him interesting huh the perfect lamb of god the lamb of god who had no blemish needed to be led yeah yes he needed to be led according to the will of his father it led him not the way he would sons and daughters of god are they that are led by the spirit of god not the way i would but the far the way the father would this is particularly incredible when you think about this in the context that this lamb was the perfect lamb the perfect lamb of god without blemish needed to be led according to the father's will wow the only way the lamb could do what it was called to do was through the leadership of the dove the perfect lamb of god could not lead itself to fulfill its purpose because a ca a lamb cannot lead itself so there was a purpose between the for the union amen and the purpose for the union is that through the union the lamb could be what it's ordained to be because without the union the lamb could not be what it was ordained to be and that was the evening sacrifice the lamb was not designed to lead itself the lamb was not self-designed oh brother you give me a a blueprint and let me design myself you'll have superman on my own power i can accomplish everything that is set before me in my own strength oh come on we're all 18 once don't try and put your religious jacket on and say there was a time when dad couldn't tell you what to do there was a time when mum couldn't tell you what to do i know i know i was there for many many years for many years the lamb of god there was no way for the lamb of god to be able to take his position his god-given position without the leadership of the dove this is why when we get the thing i i don't i don't need dad's guidance yes you do sorry i don't need mum's guidance yes you do sorry it's just a fact of life and you need to accept that fact because god places people around you you you may not have the holy ghost but even if you have the holy ghost as a son you still need your dad as a daughter mom and dad as a daughter you still need mom and dad the bible says the bible says parents to teach your children and this is just me okay but i want to know when my children don't become my children i i i don't understand what they're married now so they're still your children you know and then the son gets married and says dad i don't need you anymore i'm married well that that's not the case my children are always my children i don't know i don't care whether they're just married they've got two dozen kids or their grandparents they're still my children and i still have a responsibility to them and and what i what what i what i desire what what what what we should want is for them to have that revelation too so that they can come to i said dad you know i'm 40. but what do i do in this case what what do i do here you know i don't have a dad to do that to but i've in a sense i've adopted a dad i've got someone that i ring and say listen what do i do in this case the lamb of god the lamb of god needed a leader so god come down upon his son to lead his son to the position that only the son could take jesus as we saw last night was a revelation unto himself jesus said i can of mine own self do nothing he was a revelation unto himself because he was a part of the revelation of jesus christ so he was a revelation unto himself and what we need to be is a revelation to ourself you say no but dan what we need is the revelation of jesus christ that's what i said that is what i said jesus was a revelation to himself i cannot my own self do nothing jesus knew his weakness hope that's okay because we put him as a superpower but he says of my own self i can do nothing this is why the revelation of jesus christ is twofold because there's another part to this revelation and jesus knew this because he knew if god said for me to do something i'll it'll happen it'll it'll come to pass lazarus come forth i can on my own self not do that but through the union i can fulfill what am i i'm ordained to fulfill on earth through the union there's so many areas we could go here really is we bring this into natural lives with with um um sons and pa or children and parents yeah of of your own self you can do nothing you need the leadership of your parents because god gave you those parents for a specific reason just like the church needs the leadership of the pastor because god honors that position and god works through that position so so does god work through the mums and dads and as children we need to identify this we need to identify that god works through the office god works through mum god works through dad the reason sometimes we don't go there is because we know that very true amen and we're afraid of what they're going to say because what they're going to say they might lead you in a different direction to what you're currently being led self-led they might have a different idea of how things ought to be done but with the revelation of jesus christ if a child can have a revelation of jesus christ for themselves that that i that i am a son of god and my my dad for example he is he is my father he is he has more wisdom than what i do yes he does he has more wisdom than what i have and god will work through that office brothers and sisters i'm a testimony of that you may not even know how to answer something but if you can recognize your position god will come in and just speak some words that he said where in the world did that come from and boom it just meets the need it's it's god honoring his office we don't need to know what to say there's times where we do study to find out what we'd say but there's times when we're caught out there's times where things come when we're not expecting them but god will still work through that office through that position that jesus knew his weakness jesus knew his inability jesus had an inability yeah he did jesus said i can do nothing of myself i am a lamb he didn't say i can do some things and i can't do others no he said i can do nothing you go through the message and and look about how brother branham describes a sheep helpless hopeless can't lead itself can't find its way home constantly in need of a a leader it has an uh an infection say on its skin somewhere it can't fix it it needs a healer it needs leadership it needs the shepherd to lead it from this pasture to that pasture because in this pasture there's a certain grass that will help its infection he'll lead it from this pasture to this pasture or this paddock to that paddock because in that paddock there's a certain rock that they can lick that rock and there's certain sulfurs or something in it that that help it become healthy again jesus said i can do nothing of my own self jesus was a revelation to himself the evening sacrifice was a revelation to himself the sacrifice in first kings 18 it's a shadow but this is the reality first kings 18 couldn't be a revelation to itself because none of the parts of it were living but when we bring it into the reality of what that shadow what cast that shadow we realized that the revelation of the evening sacrifice had to be a revelation to itself because it was it was only through being a revelation to himself that he was able to fulfill his role there was no way for jesus to be able to fulfill his role unless he was a revelation to himself because it was through the revelation of the evening sacrifice that he was able to be what he was ordained to be behold the lamb of god so the revelation of the evening sacrifice is important in first kings 18. it's important in john 1 and it's important today because the only way that we can fulfill our role as a living sacrifice is through the revelation of jesus christ the lamb was designed by god to need leadership the lamb was designed by god to be totally dependent upon the dove and there you have the twofold revelation of jesus christ a lamb has no defenses it has no teeth to bite with it has no strength to fight with it has no horns to poke with it has no claws to scratch with it's helpless and defenseless and again in this area of the sheep's life it is made it was made to have to rely 100 percent upon the dove for everything that it didn't have the lamb had no defense what the lamb wasn't the dove was the lamb was going to di sorry the dove was going to defend the lamb the dove was going to be the lamb's strength the dove was going to be the lamb's gps yes because the lamb couldn't lead itself the lamb couldn't defend itself if the lamb needed protection the dove was going to supply it if the lamb needed strength the dove was going to supply it when when the lamb was on its way his to to fulfill his role on earth he got weak and god sent an angel with a message to strengthen him what the lamb needed god provided amen the lamb was a revelation to himself the lamb didn't try and provide for himself because the lamb was a revelation unto himself and that because the lamb was a revelation unto himself it gave depth to the revelation of the dove it gave depth to the relationship amen amen it gave depth to the relationship because what the lamb couldn't do the dove could what ruth couldn't do boaz could amen it gave a depth to the relationship a so it's not just all about relationship but there has to be a depth to the relationship that comes through the revelation of who you are and who you are united with amen what the lamb could not do for himself the dove was going to do amen what ruth couldn't do for herself the dove was going to do what rebecca couldn't do for herself the dove was going to do amen there's there's no point in a union if there's no need for the union amen so god designs god designs there's a purpose behind god's unions society teaches us and causes us to not have depth in our relationship as husband and wife but when god brought adam and eve together there was a purpose in that relationship and what eve couldn't do adam was called to do amen what eve couldn't do adam was called to do but the serpent through his subtility deceived eve if if satan had to come through adam he never would have got to eve but the serpent will always come through the back door he will always try and avoid the leadership that god has placed over whatever it is if a boy comes to take my daughter and comes through the back door i know what spirit is causing him is is is influencing him amen absolutely i do because god will not run over the top of his own word if the spirit of god is in that young man then the spirit of god will cause him to come through the front door through the headship of that woman and not through the back door to try and avoid the headship brothers and sisters we should be able to discern spirits in this time just by the way that satan works what the lamb wasn't the dove was the union had a purpose it wasn't just let's have a union no the union had a purpose marriage between man and woman had a purpose because god needed to unite with the lamb he needed to become the lamb in order for to be a redeemer he had to become one of us in order to be a kingsman he had to become one of us so this his son god came down and abode in his son who was a part of him and now through that union things were going to happen that couldn't happen without the union the lamb was designed this way the lamb was perfectly designed by god as the sacrifice in first john 18 was the perfect sacrifice it was the mind of god expressed with the twelve barrels of water poured over it it was the mind of god expressed and now there was another evening sacrifice and this was the perfect sacrifice this was the mind of god expressed and yet that sacrifice had weaknesses the same as what first kings 18 it had weaknesses and those weaknesses caused people to doubt but that's what they're there to do but those who are ordained to see past the weakness will amen and what they will see is the perfect sacrifice because the sacrifice cannot be perfect without there being a weakness it's glorious people looked at jesus and thought the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world he bleeds like me he cries like me he he he likes company like me he gets tired like me he gets a headache like me and yet it's the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world it caused people to question but there was a little thief on the cross who looked at the same thing that everyone else had looked at and he said remember me will now enter paradise he had a revelation something had struck his heart something that had caused him to see through the weakness the weakness was a part of the revelation but he was able to see through the weakness and see the revelation of jesus christ on display the groom the lamb the ram was provided for us he was defenseless and if the groom is defenseless then so is the bride defenseless if he is a lamb then she is a lamb but she's not a lamb with horns she's not a lamb with tiger's teeth she's not a lamb with tiger paws she's a lamb we have no defenses we are made to rely upon the dove we have no way of being able to fulfill our purpose we have no way of even positioning ourselves in the right position so that we can fulfill our purpose there's no way that we can be led we can say the same thing that jesus said that lord i can do nothing lord i stand here as a lamb helpless defenseless not able to help anyone not able to do anything lord i'm dependent upon you it brings meaning to the sacra to the reunion it brings depth to the union sheep is the most insecure animal there is on earth a sheep is the most defenseless animal that there is on earth and it's made that way i know sometimes we like to think that we're secure and we put on a tough front and sometimes to to try and show people that i've got this i'm in control you better not mess with me you know the the little guys walk like this the big guys walk like this trying to be something that they're not and the worst thing that a lamb can be is try is to try and be something that it's not a lamb was never meant to defend itself but we do a lamb was never meant to speak for itself a lamb was never meant to guide itself that's why paul said hey follow me as i follow christ amen he didn't just say follow me he said follow me as i follow christ because i'm a sheep too i need leadership but we like to show that we've got it together but jesus himself had no defenses of his own the groom had no defense of his own and jesus said unto him friend wherefore thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear this is jesus didn't do this it was someone who was with jesus someone who thought that he could defend jesus jesus goes on and he says then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinkers thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels and how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that this must be jesus had access to 12 legions of angels through his father he had no protection of his own but he had access to it if needed through the right channel through his father he had protection sons through your parents you have protection daughters through your parents you have protection jesus had no defenses of his own but he had the availability to them through his father i like this point here so much because jesus the lamb was secure in his weakness he was secure in his inability in his weakness god was made strong he knew who he was he knew what he could do right think is thou that i cannot now pray to my father he knew what he could do and he knew what he couldn't do he knew he couldn't defend himself but he had access to someone who could defend him so he knew what he could do he could pray to the father and the father would come down and defend the son amen i like that he was secure in his weakness this is why he could stand and have his beard pulled out not fight back he was smacked on the head but didn't hit back he was spat at but didn't spit back he was verbally abused but didn't abuse back he stood before pilate and said a couple of words but there was no reason for him to defend himself because he knew he couldn't this is why when a sheep gets into trouble there's just panic in the hood because it knows it can't defend itself and the lamb of god could not defend itself and it stood before pilate defenseless i want to remind you here what we're speaking about we're speaking about the greatest revelation ever given to man the revelation of jesus christ i say but then the greatest revelation given to man is the revelation of the seventh seal that's what i said it's the revelation of the dove and the lamb nobody down it's the revelation of the seventh seal that's what i said but this is an area that we need to understand about ourselves because what we do if we don't understand ourselves is that we try and defend ourselves with our insecurities because the only thing you have to defend yourself with is your insecurities because that's all a sheep has it has no claws it has no teeth to bite with it it has no it has no this it has no that the only thing it has is its insecurities that's all a sheep will always be insecure it's it's it's in its nature it's in its dna the lamb of god as was who was born in a manger jesus christ he was born in a manger because he was the lamb of god he didn't become the lamb of god in john 1 he was always the lamb of god but now he was revealed as the lamb of god amen and we we are we are lambs of god you you don't become a son when you receive the holy ghost you were always was a son therefore you could receive the holy ghost but a sheep will always be a sheep the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't make you something different than a sheep you're still a sheep when when john the baptist when the when the dove came down upon the lamb it was still a lamb yes it still had to be led to the pool of bethesda it had to be led to the subject to the individual that god chose before the foundation of the world to to be healed at that particular time he was led there he was he was led away from lazarus tomb and then led back on the fourth day because it had to be on the fourth day couldn't be on the third first or second it had to be at a particular time my point here is that jesus was a lamb from the time he was on earth to his departure on earth from earth he was a lamb and in that period which is his life on earth as a groom he was a lamb he was insecure a lamb is always a lamb you're a lamb i'm a lamb we're always going to be lambs sons and daughters of god are they that are led by the spirit of god not until they receive the baptism of the holy ghost no for their time on earth the insecurities that are part of who we are were not given to us to protect ourselves with and yet we use them for that reason but this is how sheep hurt sheep this is how we try and prove who we are to other sheep through our insecurities i'll show you who i am and we try and we try to roar like a lion but you know what comes out that john turned to see a lion saw a lamb well sometimes we try and be a lion and you think you're roaring like a lion but you know what everyone else is hearing that a helpless sheep but in your best effort you want everyone around you to let to to know that i am a lion and i am in control and i am my own leader and i am the king of my kingdom and i don't need leadership and this and that and this and that and all people are hearing it's bad big difference because you're not a lion you're a sheep you're designed this way because of our insecurities this is what we try and portray and it shows we need more revelation than what we have our words our actions define us they portray us oh i wish that guy just know who i am no matter what we try to be we can never be we just need to come to terms with the fact of who we are and the fact is we are sheep my sheep hear my voice and a stranger's voice they will not follow but they will follow my voice the only way to the wedding supper friends is through leadership through the leadership of the dove in your life you're not gonna get there trying to roar like a lion remember what brother branham said we need to have our natures changed from a roaring lion to the meekness of the lamb god designed the sheep this way he designed it to need leadership and this is the thing to me personally this is an area of influence that the world is trying to influence the the the christians in this time just to to be self-led do whatever is on your heart brother no my goodness me lord god forbid yeah i i i don't want to do what's on my heart i i want god to lead me to a place that's on his heart everything the lamb lacks the dove is and saints you lack everything i lack as a sheep i lack everything so it causes me it caused jesus to be dependent upon the dove to lead him through the union of the lamb and the dove the lamb is now secure through the union of the lamb and the dove the lamb now has security because the dove is the lamb's security amen it now has protection the lamb now has protection because the la the dove is the lamb's protection amen this is why the shepherd sits in the door this is why the shepherd while the sheep sleep the shepherd is awake because he's looking for the wolves that might come in to defile his sheep through the union through the dove uniting himself with the lamb now it has leadership now it has no need to defend itself now it can be fearless now ruth can rest remember the temptation was for ruth to open the door and go and make sure boaz was doing all that he was doing ordained to do but naomi said ruth find your position be a revelation unto yourself and just rest because what you are anticipating what you are trying to do you can't actually do that's boaz department so there was a revelation but that ruth had of herself when ruth sat back down on that on that chair and and rested she was resting in the revelation of who she was but she was also resting in the revelation of who he was in relationship to her because what she couldn't do even though she was tempted to do it like we attempted to defend ourselves we are tempted to use our insecurity to defend ourselves we've got to come to terms with who we are and the fact is that we cannot do nothing that's the fact that we cannot do nothing jesus could not do nothing but the father what the father showed him to do first the lamb is the lamb finds its security through the union but it still remains a lamb through the union or after the union nothing that the like when husband and wife get married it's best if you're a revelation to one another before you get married that's the best scenario okay i would encourage that a lot but if you're a revelation to one another before the union what will happen is that that revelation will flow through the union after the union but if you're not a revelation to one another when you get married then you're going to struggle in your marriage because you're not a revelation to one another and how can you fulfill each other's needs when you're not a revelation to each other and then finally by god's grace you become a revelation to one another but my point here is that what you are before the relationship you are after the relationship after the union you're just now positioned you're a son here you're a son after the union but now you're positioned as a son so a lamb is always a lamb it doesn't make us some great mighty superhero we're still lambs in union with the dove david said in psalm 23 he said the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the powers of righteousness for his name's sake yea thou i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil why for thou art with me david was a sheep his life on earth was a life as a sheep david got into trouble when he began to lead himself but his life on earth was a sheep but david had no need to fear now because he was in a union with the dove he had no need to fear not because he'd become something mighty he was still a sheep with the insecurities of a sheep but the security came through the union his security came as a result of the union what he was feeding on came as a result of the union the the his position of rest came as a result of a union it didn't change who he was he was a sheep in union with his protector his supplier his jehovah jireh his healer thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever a psalm of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear david didn't say that david didn't say god god has god has changed me and he's made me this big thing now and and now i have no need to fear because of who i am david was a sheep this is the revelation of jesus christ david was a sheep of of whom shall i be afraid the lord is the strength of my life david didn't go into a phone booth and come out of superman and all of a sudden have this david had this super power no the lord is the strength of my life david was weak because he was a lamb and lambs are weak sheep are weak but now through the union through a union the lord is the strength of my life with him without him i can do nothing but with him i can do all things and this is this is in relationship to jesus christ in john 1 that the lord is the strength of my life because he was a lamb the dove was his strength he had no need to fear being a lamb why because there had been a union heaven and earth had united heaven and earth had kissed as brother abraham said the greatest event that there was on earth when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come up to eat my eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host shooting camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise up against me in this will i be confident one thing i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life and behold the beauty of the lord and the and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble we all have these times he shall hide me remember when they wanted to kill jesus and throw him over the cliff and all of a sudden he wasn't there he is our protection because we are sheep because he was a sheep he needed protection by the dove in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock rock is a revelation we're not we're not trying to look for rocks so that we can stand upon them we're sheep we need to be led to the revelation of the word he shall set me upon a rock as sheep jesus had a revelation of himself he was led to that revelation we are led to that revelation he puts me upon a rock a rock that cannot be moved upon this rock will i build my church and now shall my head be lifted up above above mine enemies around about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord oh i like to sing my singing is a result of what he's done for me my singing is a result of what he's done in my life and brothers and sisters he's done everything i can't sing praises to myself because i haven't done anything it's him that done it jesus was led to calvary he didn't find his own way to calvary he was led to calvary through this union we have moved from an independent life to a dependent life when we were young we were independent but through the revelation of jesus christ through this union we have moved from a life of independence to a life of dependence once we let ourselves but now there's a dove once we've defended ourselves but now there's a dove once we tried to hide ourselves from trouble but now there's a dove once we spoke for ourselves but now there's a dove amen once we provided for ourself but now there's a dove amen the revelation of the lamb the revelation of the sacrifice through the revelation by the revelation of the sacrifice people were able to move into the next dispensation that god had for them and i believe it's the same thing in this hour that we are living in that what is going to cause us to to move from this dispensation into the next dispensation or this dimension into the next dimension is the revelation of jesus christ and until the body of christ receives the pure revelation of jesus christ then we will not move into that next dimension that god has for us but we cannot move ourselves there because we cannot lead ourself to the revelation we we have to realize like the prophet said that we are licked and we need leadership in our lives we need the dove we need to recognize who we are we need to recognize that we are the dove jesus had to recognize who he was in order for people to be able to move from law into that grace dispensation and i thank god that he was a revelation unto himself i thank the lord that he was able to identify his weaknesses in the revelation of who he was and be secure in his weaknesses john the baptist said he said behold the lamb of god and jesus looked at himself and said behold the lamb of god behold the lamb of god that's who i am because it was the pure revelation of the evening sacrifice jesus didn't fight against what elijah said he accepted it because it was the only way that he could fulfill his purpose on earth as the ram because the ram has a purpose and now god is god what god didn't complete through the ram he's he's completing through the you amen there is no more sacrifice for sin needed by one sacrifice he done that you don't have to die for your sin and you don't have to die for someone else's he done that but the work that he didn't complete there was a portion of his earthly ministry he didn't didn't complete as the ram he's now completing as a you that's the purpose this is where we are but we will not be able to fulfill our purpose unless we come to the revelation of the evening sacrifice romans 12 1 present your bodies unto god a living sacrifice you love him you're thankful for what he's done for you amen because we couldn't do our part unless he did his part first is that right oh yeah we got a part ruth had a part to play yeah but ruth couldn't play her part until bob hasn't done his part amen and boaz has done his part boaz has done his part amen the evening sacrifice has accomplished what it was ordained to accomplish and now there's an evening sacrifice again and god is now working in and through you [Laughter] ewe you yeah we spelled differently over there you know we're convicts after all you know never got a real good end education you know praise the lord i mean let's stand to our feet let's just offer a word of prayer i ask brother simon to come and close the service amen our precious and loving heavenly father lord we we are reflecting heavenly father upon your attitude in life when you were here two thousand years ago the revelation lord god of of what you had of yourself at that time and what was accomplished through that revelation lord god as as eve could have looked at adam and discovered all that she was through the revelation of who he was so we lord is your bride in this hour lord just study you at this time lord god because truly we can learn who we are by knowing who you are and lord god we want to thank you for the honor and privilege lord god of of knowing these things because lord god these are not things lord that are self-learnt or self-taught but lord god these things are things that are revealed by you lord these things are supernatural [Music] and in order for the supernatural to be present the supernatural one must also be present so lord god these things that are you have taught us this morning lord they are things that declare your presence because lord god you are the revealer of yourself lord one can speak but lord god the one that speaks lord this this vessel cannot reveal you it's only you who can reveal you and lord god we want to thank you for the the leadership lord in our lives because lord god today holy ghost leadership is supernatural it's always been supernatural but lord god leadership in this hour that we are living in particularly lord god at the evening time to the gentiles it's a supernatural leadership and lord god as we begin as we are led from truth to truth and lord in deeper and deeper in our relationship with you lord we can only we can only have that through leadership we can only know you more through leadership we can only become fearless through leadership lord we can only become a in that position that ruth was in that position of rest through leadership the lord god let us just consider where we stand at this point let us consider lord am i somewhere have i have i moved forward this morning in my revelation of jesus christ have i am i further in my revelation than of jesus christ than what i was yesterday well lord god your purpose for moving us lord god is not just so we can say that we've been moved but your purpose in leading us deeper into your word lord god is so that your presence is revealed because we cannot be led we cannot lead ourself but lord god because we have moved forward the moving forward of our revelation testifies that you are here because we cannot lead ourself oh lord god we look at the lamb of god express lord your son heavenly father who hung on that cross at calvary oh lord it testifies of a leadership it testifies there was that there was someone present in his life that led him to that position because a lamb is cannot just lead itself to the slaughter but a lamb must be led to the slaughter and our lamb our groom was led to calvary to purchase us lord god to pay that price for redemption and lord god now we stand here as the redeemed oh lord god i am redeemed bought with a price lord you have changed my whole life oh heavenly father may we recognize your presence here this morning lord god maybe recognize your presence lord by by the fact heavenly father that you have moved us into a deeper relationship lord than what we had when we came here this morning lord god i pray heavenly father that we would continue to give you the preeminence in our life through the revelation lord god that you need to be the preeminent one in my life because if i am the preeminent one in my life lord i will lead myself and whoever is following me astray oh lord god we give you that position in our lives this afternoon lord god we understand ourself lord god we are a revelation to ourself and lord god that revelation calls for leadership it calls for a protection it calls for security it calls for someone to provide for us what we have need of oh lord it calls for someone the strong one in the relationship lord god you are the strong one in the relationship lord god while this world lord goes into its perverted state more and more every day lord this bride is walking closer and closer into her purity through the opening of the word and lord god you are the strong one in this relationship lord we are the weaker vessel here heavenly father and lord god may you just continue to watch over us may you continue to lead us lord may this relationship of love lord god that you have established with us continue to blossom like an eternal rose that will never lose its glory the lord god's responding to the presence of the son in its life oh lord god we love you with all of our hearts lord we need you more than we've ever needed you before lord god as things get darker around us lord you are the light of our life you are the strength in our lives oh lord god continue to bless this fellowship lord god continue to bless the mothers heavenly father continue to be their portion continue to be their strength the lord god continue to be the the father's strength the father's portion the father's guide the lord god and may lord the sons and daughters that are here this morning heavenly father may they recognize their position may they rule in that position may they reign in that position as sons and lord may they through that heavenly father may they approach the authority that god has put over them to say dad what do i do here or dad what would you like to do here what would please you the lord god you as the son you expressed yourself as the son and lord that son's desire was to do nothing but what pleased his father and lord god that is whatever office that we are in lord that is our desire today is to whatever office we hold lord we want to please you in the office that you have given us lord god just we thank you for the blessings of your presence here this morning in jesus christ's precious name amen amen the lord bless you thank you brother [Music] is [Music] [Music] is peace [Music] [Music] you are my only i want
