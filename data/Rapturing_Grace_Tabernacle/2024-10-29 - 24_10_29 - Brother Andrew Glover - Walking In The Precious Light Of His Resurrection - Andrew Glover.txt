and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen we want to say God bless you all tonight tonight and amen we thank brother Al for this opportunity the invitation to be here tonight and speak to you all and as he said we have had a amen a very long day of travel but we're here by God's grace and amen I guess that's what you call being persevering amen we uh we thank the Lord for making a way for us to be here tonight and I do want to thank you all for accommodating and moving your Wednesday night to Tuesday for us we uh brother Al had invited us down and uh we actually supposed to thought we were leaving Friday and now we're leaving tomorrow we've got some things going back home we need to get back home for us so appreciate you all graciously moving your midweek meeting for us and for those of you that all was with us in the camp amen very gracious of you all to show up again and here for the fourth time in a row so amen we want to say God bless you all and if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the word of the lord we want to turn to the book of 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter amen f 1 Corinthians 15 and then also we're going to look in the book of St Luke 24 and also St John 14 amen it is a real special honor to be speaking to you tonight here in your assembly in your church first time we've been here in the church with you all we were with you a few years ago there in the Family Camp before Co hit and changed the world Amen so we thank the Lord for allowing our path to cross again and to be here with you all tonight amen in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse number one Paul here writing he says moreover brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain now watch this for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins and I want you to watch how he died according to the scriptures verse number four and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day again there it is according to the scripture so he was born he lived he died he was buried and he raised and it was all according to the scripture now in the book of St Luke the 24th chapter it's a very very familiar reading uh brother Bram will use this many times in the sermons of the Resurrection or he'll take a thought when their eyes were open they knew him in St Luke 24 and verse 32 amen St Luke 24 uh rather verse 29 let's begin at verse 29 but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to Terry with him and it came to pass as he sat at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished now notice this he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures brother BR says whenever Jesus appears the first thing he does is he goes straight to the scripture so here he took the time to identify himself in his resurrection but he did it according to the scripture now we believe that he is our bridegroom right so we believe that he lived according to the scripture he rose according to the scripture now if the scripture speaks of the bridegroom it must also speak of the Bride so in St John chapter 14 St John chapter 14 and verse number 19 Jesus here speaking brother Bram again will pick this up and it is the rising of the sun he says now yet a little while and the world will seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here uh this evening I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I could to take a a thought out of those passages of scripture if I would title this tonight I want to talk to you for a few moments on walking in the precious light of his resurrection amen walking in the precious light of his resurrection 1958 brother B preaches a very powerful sermon he calls it I know my redeemer liveth and I just want to read here a portion of the prayer from that sermon he said now dear God we are grateful this morning to be the people that is called by thy name how many is grateful to be called by his name he said we're so glad that we do not have to just imagine any more of a great resurrection that is to come see because it's become a reality to us as we read it in thy word see thou Hast promised this and filled it within our souls That Jesus Lives oh we are thinking this morning of the many heartaches that's been in life and the many sadnesses that we went through the experience that has torn us and thrown us to The Winds of the Earth how we buried our loved ones how we mourned at the grave he said our souls seem to almost perish within us he said but then we can think of today he said oh what it means that Jesus raised from the dead he spoiled every Power of the enemy enemy when he rose up triumphant he took all the Shadows away I want you to catch this and now we walk in the precious light of his resurrection now I find it amazing that brother bradam is not putting these things in the future amen that someday we're going to walk in the light of his resurrection he said but as we're reading the word of God he said the resurrection is becoming a reality to us and we are now walking in the precious light of his resurrection again he says I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand upon on the earth and though after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God he said now job seen the resurrection would be brought about by a man someday and the sin question would be settled when that righteous one the Son of God came to die for Sinners he said now there was no man on Earth at that time or no man sense that could ever Bridge the way between a holy God and a sinful man he said but job here 4,000 years before his coming he saw his death his burial and his resurrection and his justification that come by the resurrection now I love this and the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer what a comfort it is to know that those things are not are true amen it's not a fiction story now think about that that job actually saw amen that there was a resurrection that would come by a man but he also saw that that Resurrection would have an influence upon the Believers amen who would believe in the one who brought the power of Resurrection among the church now you all know that the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen it is the birth it is the life the death amen and the burial and resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I want to say tonight that there is no other gospel amen the prophet of God said if there is another gospel Paul spoke to one of the groups he said I'm so surprised rised amen that you would turn to another gospel he said which there is no other but a make belief gospel Amen to a denominational fiction amen a turning from the good news but then Jesus says because I live ye live also amen and I live in you and the works that I do amen the works I do will identify myself in you what a message see no wonder we've had a dark world of theology amen but in the evening time there shall come light again see now watch a prophet there will be a resurrection in the evening time so there was not just a resurrection prophesied amen or promised to come in the morning amen but there was prophesied to be a resurrection in the evening time he said see what a resurrection that that was amen but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus amen by God God's quickening power see he was waved to them the word which he was amen was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost what was it it was the word made manifest now I'll say this the word of God that is being waved in this generation amen it is not a fiction amen but it is a reality and the reason we can declare it's a reality is by the fruit amen that it bears in the life of those who believe it he said now this is not a fiction this is the B it's God's truth it's his promise he said I have tried it I have tested it and I know amen that you can take God's word and he will make it right with you amen he will bring it to pass amen so the word of God is the absolute to the life of every believer brother B tell us what an absolute is he says it is perfect in itself amen it is Unlimited in its power it is primarily an ultimate see it's Unlimited in its power it is perfect in itself he says and it really is an ultimate now another place therefore I think everybody amen should have an ultimate how many believes every life has got to have an absolute he said see you cannot go through life amen without having an absolute now when brother B uses that word the absolute guarantee of the believer we know what an absolute is but I took the time Amen to look up what a guarantee is in the in the in the definition the word guarantee it is a formal promise or Assurance amen that is typically in writing amen that certain conditions will be fulfilled it is something amen that gives a certainty of an outcome so when you have a guarantee you have something in writing amen that is giving you an assurance in your soul amen that there's going to be an outcome to the situation now amen sometimes I amen I just have to I'm just a simple country boy okay so sometimes I have to break things down in ways that I can understand it I was preaching one time on this word outcome you know and I just got to thinking and you can look up the definition of the word outcome and there's a lot of there's a lot of different meanings of it amen but if you really want to know a simple definition of what outcome means amen just rearrange the way it's spelled amen from outcome and change it and it says come out so what it's saying is whatever that you're in you're coming out of see amen if you're in Le OA you're coming out of it here we find that there is an absolute guarantee to the believer and I'll say the only one that I know of is the revealed word of God Amen that has been brought to us through a Vindicated Prophet that was written in the Bible and has been interpreted to us Amen in the message of the hour let me say this what was written in the word has now been quickened in the flesh amen of the Believers of the hour of the age that we're living in I love what Paul says he says it's as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us amen written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God Amen not in tables of stone amen but in fleshly tables of the heart he said another place I will put my laws into their mind amen and I will write them into their hearts brother comes along and picks that up he said therefore the man's spirit is Blended out amen and God comes in and takes all over he said then they got Fellowship one with another listen and the Very God that created the heavens and the Earth amen that wrote his word amen is dwelling in you and you will believe it for everything that God wrote it to be The Truth Listen friends we are not reading Grandma's Almanac amen we're not reading a history book amen but the word of God has been wrote in this age amen it's been not wrote by education it's not been wrote by science or by by philosophy or theology amen but the word of God has been wrote by inspiration and the prophet of God said therefore the Bible is the word of God it is wrote by God himself amen through lips and instrumentality of man now listen God can write himself God can speak himself God can do what he wants to amen but he chose man to do it amen because that man that wrote it is a part of God listen when God chose zachar arah to write the word amen Zachariah was a part of God he said the man didn't even know what they were writing in their own human thinking see amen they might disagree with it amen but they wrote it anyhow see because men of old as they was moved by the Holy Ghost see God moved their hands God moved their eyes in Vision they could say nothing amen but what they were looking at see they could speak nothing because he had full control of their tongue their finger every organ their body was in full Sway With God no wonder the Bible said they were Gods amen because they were a part of God Amen he was the fullness of God let me just say this when those prophets were writing amen they were not writing about things they wanted to write about necessarily amen but they were writing prophecy amen of the coming of the Messiah which was our Lord Jesus Christ I love in St John 5:46 Jesus speaking he said for had you believe Moses amen ye would have believed me now watch what Jesus says he says see for Moses wrote of me look at this word write it means to describe to commit to writing it is used to things which stand written in the sacred books of the Old Testament amen by writing in a written epistle Amen to give information to give direction to make things so clear that when it comes to pass it will not be overlooked now think about this Jesus stands there and he said if in verse 47 he said but if you believe not his writings amen then how shall you believe me so Moes Moses wrote about him coming amen but now Jesus stands there in the flesh of what Moses was writing and he said listen if you will not believe me you will not believe Moses amen because what Moses wrote is who I am listen Jesus was the manifestation amen of the prophet's prophecy he was the manifestation of the word of God listen the prophet of God said the baby born down there illegitimate birth in a cow stable how could that be this guy didn't go to any school he had no credentials he had no Fellowship card he didn't belong to any organization they didn't know what school he went to amen how could this be anything he said but it was amen they failed to see he said the works I do they testify me amen so search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify amen they tell you who I am I love what brother B says he said that Jesus looks at him and says the testimony of my life are the scriptures now think about that if you don't believe me amen then you won't believe the works I do now watch if you don't believe me amen rather believe the works I do for they tell you who I am they said now we have Moses we're just going to believe Moses he said well if you believe Moses amen you would believe me because he wrote of me I want you to catch what a prophet says he said they were so dark and still they couldn't see it now catch this he doesn't say Amen that it was so dark he said they was so dark that still they couldn't see it he said I wonder if that couldn't repeat amen it's prophesied to you know amen you say yes in this day oh yes so what Jesus was amen was he was the scriptural lot of the age in other words the prophets proph prophesied amen and the prophecy was brought to light in his age amen that had been prophesied for his age I love this quote he lit up every candle of word that was in the Bible and was prophesied of him listen a virgin shall conceive and she did amen his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and he was amen and the eyes of the blind shall see he said and they did oh my so everything that was prophesied of him amen it happened when he come on the earth listen friends when he came on the earth he did not come as a book or as the writings Amen in in in script form he came as the flesh amen of the writings that was described in his arrival into the Earth let me just go ahead and say it amen there is a Bible that speaks of him but the same Bible that speaks of him amen also speaks of a bride who would come into this AG but she would not come by tradition she would not come by education she would not come by denomination she would come by the prophet's prophecy let me say this that bride is not coming that bride is here tonight and she's before me what the Bible spoke of an end time bride is before me tonight in flesh now I think that's a very powerful thing when you realize the scriptures cannot be broken amen but they must be fulfilled you know the the Bible says that heaven and Earth shall pass away amen but Jesus said that my words amen shall not pass away brother said see God's word is so real he said now that's enough scripture right there to take all the communism out of the world and convert the entire world he said it's an invitation to Salvation he said it's also an invitation to Healing it's the guarantee of eternal life he said oh it means so much if it be received in the light that it's wrote in so when they were riding when Moses was writing of Jesus he was not writing in darkness he was riding in light and the light he was riding in was none other than the pillar of fire amen that is the original True Light let me just say it friends these lights we have here tonight they're very beautiful and we're very thankful for them amen but don't get in your mind that that's the kind of light amen that the Bible was wrote by amen that is artificial light amen but the kind of light the Bible was wrote by amen was by the pillar of fire which is the original light then the pro of God will say like this we are so thankful to be alive and to have this great revelation of eternal life that is dwelling within us he said we've come tonight father to study Thy word together these great Hidden Mysteries that's been hid since the foundation of the world and the lamb is the only one amen that can reveal it to us he said I pray he will come among us tonight and will take of his word and will reveal it to us that we might know how to be better servant to him Amen in this end time so when the lamb returns to the church he is not coming Amen to dark in the church the church was already dark he was coming to bring light upon the scripture that there might be an authority and a power in the flesh of every believer listen the Bible is full of promises amen we don't have time to preach on all the promises that are recorded in God's holy word but there are one of those formal promises or written guarantees however you want to say it amen that I'm very thankful for amen and that is the promise of light you know Zachariah said it shall come to pass in that day amen that the light shall not be clear nor dark amen but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night listen but it shall come to pass amen that at the evening time it shall be light modern events are made clear by prophecy he said the evening light promised by the prophet of God so this is not any kind of light it was promised by the prophet of God in Zechariah 14:7 that it may again open the true believer's eyes Amen to the events that's taking place today amen that's proved by the prophecies that we are at the end time he said Jesus is coming another place but the proph said it shall be light again about the evening time the Sun s so n will peep out again it shall be light he said what the same s o n that was revealed in flesh at the morning time back there will be revealed again in the evening time listen the light does not change the only thing that changes is the flesh that is being revealed in in the morning time it was revealed in the flesh of Jesus Christ but in the evening time it has been prophesied to be revealed in the flesh of the redeemed blessing oh God to be revealed in the redeemed vessels of the Bride of Jesus Christ what is this evening light amen it is Revealing Light can I say this it is prophetic light now in Isaiah chapter 60 verse1 you know these scriptures by heart he says arise and shine amen for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee he said now for Behold The Darkness amen it shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people amen but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee brother B comes along in Shalom he says now good morning which means peace he said the darkness is gathering amen what's it gathering for to show the light see Isaiah 60:1 Rise and Shine the Light is come that's the reason I can say shalom amen the light has come to you God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the world Amen called out and ordained to that listen look what Isaiah goes on to say he says and the Gentiles amen shall come to thy light now listen thy light has come and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and the Kings Amen to the brightness of thy Rising now I'll just say this I I remember a few years ago back home amen some people got to doing their DNA you know and they got to searching and and and and ancestry.com and all kinds of all kinds of DNA searches and if you're into that God bless you I have no problem with it but I I found some people that got into it and man they got so deep you know amen they found maybe maybe a percentage of a percentage of a percentage amen of Jewish or Israelite blood and all of a sudden brother all they were Moses or Elijah and they was Revelations 11 fulfillment they were going to go lay in the street you know amen but let me just let me don't don't get mad at me okay but let me just get it out there in the open we are Gentiles okay now listen if we try to be something else we're going to miss what God has promised to send us in the hour that we're living in and this Bible says that this light that was prophesied to come amen would come to the Gentiles first you say the Gentiles it went to the Jews and they rejected it God blind their eyes so that the Gentiles eyes could come open amen but when the Gentiles dispensation is over it will return to the Jews he said but right now the light is Vindicated again it's God's word amen so you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age amen see the promises that's been made for this day these promises that was said by the prophets and by Jesus himself in this day Hebrews 1 in this last day through his son Jesus Christ so when Jesus Christ came on the earth he was neither Israel or or Jewish blood or Gentile blood right it was creative blood now watch what a prophet of God said he said Jesus Christ testified amen that he was the light that he was the True Light he said I am the light of the world he that followeth me amen shall not walk in darkness amen but shall have the light of life let me say this without light amen nothing can live he said see now no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was in when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites amen there was light he said but now True light has come amen the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture amen relevant to the Messiah thus Israel had light amen but now somebody say now but now the Fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word has now broken forth into the brightness of God Amen manifested among his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night that was wonderful he said but now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodly let me say this friends the light of life is not coming it is here and it is shin in this age that we're living in he said the Bible in his word in the hour that we're living amen is shining upon those Amen to catch the eternal life amen those who are predestinated to see it so listen there's going to be Darkness upon the Earth there's going to be gross Darkness upon the people but there's a prophetic light that would come among the church and that light would cause a resurrection in the end time Jesus said the people which sat in darkness amen they saw great light and to them them which sat in the region and the shadow of death amen light is sprung up now Matthew 4:16 says that but if you go back to Isaiah 9 and2 the Bible says the people amen that walked in darkness have seen a great light listen to this they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon [Applause] them upon them hath the light shined let me say this there is a Darkness upon the Earth but there's a greater Darkness upon the people that is living upon the Earth and here the Bible says that the shadow of death amen would cover the entire land let me say this friends we are living in the hour where the shadow of death is covering everything it's covering the political world it's covering the religious world it's covering science and education listen everything in this land amen is covered by the shadow amen of death but in Matthew chapter 4 it was prophesied that light amen would come to the Gentiles who were possessed and were condemned by God and their Idols amen but he came as a light he said and today the light of God Amen is the word of God made manifest he said that's the light made manifested the light is the works of God spoken by the word of God Amen brought to life and it's a greater light than it was amen at the dawn of creation oh Church of the Living God Amen if anybody has got to R to rejoice and thank God is the Bride of Jesus Christ she is living in the land that is covered by the shadow of death but unto her there was a seed on the inside of her soul and by that seed she would be the recipient amen of the light of life that would condemn amen the shadow of death and will cause her to raise oh I can get on the page with brother brandham tonight what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is listen that I'm not reading the Bible amen under the darkness of Leota or the influence of denomination L but God has sent a prophet in this age and he's opened my eyes to see who I am to see where I come from and to see where we're going he said though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me he said listen there's a man here that can turn on the light y'all believe that there's a man here who can turn on the light he said those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death amen some of them under cancer some of them under the death of denomination some of them under Creed's death some of them under traditional death my all kinds of death but they have seen a great light the man that flashed the lights then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be lights see the same God yesterday today and forever he is present today right here now amen don't get scared he can turn on the light yes sir don't reject it receive it in the name of the Lord B again says in that day of gross Darkness amen the light will return amen by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost Amen to welcome back our Lord Jesus Christ let me say this the Sun the Su n it is the king amen of all livs that's on this Earth in the natural L he said no matter how much artificial light we can have how many great electric ravs we can produce when that sun rises all the rest of them dim out he said that's the same thing it is with the word of God when the word of God Rises all superstitions denominational fanaticisms and things spread away and it shows exactly what it is he said the word of God made manifest it always separates the light from the darkness listen and his word amen is superior over all man's words over all anything his word is light let me just go ahead and say what a prophet said he said light is so much more powerful amen it just puts the darkness out I love these prophetic instructions 1958 the mighty conquer amen don't set in darkness no more the light has come the great conqueror is here let me just say this it don't matter what shadow that the devil's trying to kill you under there is a prophetic light that is come in this generation and it is a voice of Resurrection that is saying come out of her my people listen There Ain't No Grave going to hold this bride down there ain't no traditional death or denominational death or Creed death or cancer listen we are Invincible by the power of the Holy Ghost you say well the flesh is weak the flesh may be weak amen but I'm not talking about your flesh I'm talking about your soul what is this evening light it's the manifestation of the Resurrection he said now what does the light come to do he said we see the evening lights are here he said what does it do to have light if you don't have eyes to see how to get around in it what is the evening light he said the light comes on to reveal something so when light comes on it doesn't come on to change something it comes on to reveal something like if you walk in a dark room and there's no light in there at all and you're walking through there and you're tripping over things and you're stumbling over objects amen you have no ability to identify amen what you're tripping over or what you're walking into but if the light comes on when the light comes on and Strikes the S the object amen the light don't change the object the light only reveals it he said listen if there's something here and you feel you can't understand what it is in the darkness amen then turn on a light it's to reveal what's Malachi for to do see do the same thing what was the open of the Seven Seals to do where all these denominations were staggering around in darkness is to reveal or to bring out listen if you haven't got any eyes then what's the use to reveal see there has to be Eyes First amen is that right Amen to reveal Malachi 4 to reveal Luke 17:30 to reveal John 14:12 to reveal John 15:24 1613 and to also reveal Revelations 10: 1-7 amen the opening of The Seven Seals the seventh Angel's message is to open up Amen to reveal when the evening lights come on listen tonight we are not staggering in the understanding of Malachi 4 we are not staggering in the understanding of John 14:12 listen denomination had buried those scriptures their traditions and their ideas and their dogmas and Creeds had literally killed amen the influence of the original Bible in the Church of the Living God but in the evening time there shall come a light and listen there will be eyes that'll be on the earth that when that light begins to shine there will be a people who will be called out of the land of the shadow of death listen I don't know if you realize it or not amen but you're not just walking amen with your husband or walking with your wife or walking with your your children but you are walking through leosia in the precious lights of his resurrection listen we are walking with Malachi 4 we are walking with Luke 17:30 we are walking with Revelations 10 we are walking with Malachi 4 are y'all hearing me we are not staggering we are walking now there's a big difference in staggering and walking are you hearing me there's a big difference in staggering and walking if you're staggering you have no idea where you're going but if you're walking you have a vision to see a destination listen we are reading the word under a vision we have received the word in the same light that it was wrote in I love Exodus 13:21 the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud Amen to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night amen from before the people now listen brother say like this he said God is light we know that amen how many knows God is light he said God is light we know that amen Pillar of Fire in the unveiling of God he said there Joseph all them that wrote what went on everyone wrote back in that day but when Moses came on the scene he had the Revelation he had because he had met the pillar of fire see it was revealed to Moses how Genesis he wrote the first four books of the Bible is that right for he met God in the form of the pillar of fire amen veiled in the pillar of fire when Paul met him on the road the disciples just wrote what they seen him do but Moses had the Revelation he said he went down into Egypt for three years and studied and seen that the god of the Old Testament amen was the Jesus of the new the Revelation he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision think of it are y'all ready for this the same Pillar of Fire that come upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire today that is interpretting the Bible amen how we thank him for that amen what a comfort what an identification I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptist and Methodist and Presbyterian Luther and all the rest of them amen identified in that word amen with the sh Glory watch and the Revelation lays so friends we're not reading the Bible Under the Umbrella of a commentator we're not reading the Bible Under the Umbrella of a motivational speaker or an inspirational speaker but the same Pillar of Fire that was there when the Bible was wrote has returned to the house of the Believers in this hour listen when the world was in complete darkness when go was complete darkness there was some Israelites who had light in their tents let me say this amen America is in darkness and New Zealand is in darkness the whole world is in darkness but there is a Remnant according to the election grace of God listen we're not sitting in our homes amen reading our Bibles Through The Eyes of the understanding of some man who is dark himself we are reading the Bible Through The Eyes of the pillar of fire hallelujah hallelujah that's why reading the Bible means something to a Bible believer y'all know what I'm talking about amen you get up and read the Bible me you ever been there you're real discouraged you're real weary and you're really tired and going through a lot of battles facing a lot of pressures and you sit down and read the Psalms am you ever been there maybe maybe you maybe you're ready just throw up your hands and quit and you sit down and read the Bible in Psalms and you read about how David said though a th000 fall at one side and 10,000 fall at another amen it shall not come nigh thee amen and you start feeling something amen you read over there where he said be still amen and know that I am God you begin to read about where he talked about there would be a tree that would be planted by the rivers of one water you begin to read about where he talked about amen how that there would be a there would be a bride who would be unmovable amen though the Earth be removed though the mountains be removed though the Seas be removed there would be a woman who would be unmovable and you say oh God that's the bride and then you feel something something come across you can I tell you amen have you ever been there when you was reading the Bible and you felt something tap you on the shoulder and give you give you a shot in the arm amen give you a boost of Faith give you an encouragement in your spirit can I tell you who that was that was the one who wrote it that was the pillar of fire listen Amen brother Bram said I was about to go to the pulit and make the worst mistake of my entire Ministry I was about to make the Antichrist amen Christ again he said but oh he come in the room and he touched me on the shoulder and he said he be to reveal to me amen that there was a man who was on a horse but he didn't have a bow he had a bow rather but no arrows he said see that's not Christ amen that's the Antichrist come on Church who touched him on the shoulder I'll tell you who touched him on the shoulder was the one who wrote the scripture he was fing to Endeavor to interpret well may I say to you tonight it's time to dust off our Bibles it's time to dust off our books it's time to break open our tapes again the author of the word of God who give you this Revelation is no longer with you he's no longer just above you he's now dwelling in you my to think he's not just with us he's not just above us but the pillar of fire is visibly in US you say visibly in us oh yeah I see the influence of it in these last days he said to see the same Pillar of Fire right Among Us speaking the same word not only that but interpret it by making it manifest and proving it to be the truth he said notice the same Pillar of Fire that sent to Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible is now sent to reveal it the same one that was sent to write it is now sent to reveal it listen he says the grace of God the unchanging God the fulfilling the promises of Matthew 28 Lo I'm with you always fulfill in John 14:12 the works I do you also fulfill in Luke 17:30 in the last days the son of man will be revealed see fulfilling Malachi 4 I will send you Elijah the prophet what is it there it is that same Pillar of Fire that same light Among Us bearing forth the life that it did when it was in Christ Jesus doing the same thing in the bride church today listen that same light has come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day it's the manifested lot of the day listen and the Darkness is darkened my goodness so as the word is coming open to your heart the darkness is getting darker what's the darkness gathering for to show the light what is the light to prove to prove the scriptural promise of the age you're living in y'all remember tells the story there 1954 he said I was up there at the Statue of Liberty he said I was out there in the arms and that night he said I seen those little old sparrows laying around there he said that big glass of the old heads beat off I said the god I said well what him there he said well they had a storm last night he said when the light was on the Statue of Liberty the little old birds caught out there in the storm and darkness he said now instead of trying to use the light to fly to safety he said they flew against it amen trying to beat it out he said now the very same light that caused them to die amen could cause them to live if they would have used it right he said they're laying there because their brain just beat out they're trying to beat the light out he said accept the light and say thank you and let it leave them they tried to beat it out I said oh praise God he said infidels will rise Creeds will rise people say the Bible's not right it's not inspired they're only beating their brains out where they could take it to Glory come on church amen they're beating their brains out when the light that could have saved them is a light that ended up killing them he said it's a light it's a lamp to the path and to the people oh we'll walk in the light sure not try to beat it out amen not to try to say this is not right this is wrong that's not right that's not right oh God don't let me beat against your light Amen Let Me accept it in my heart and say it's right Lord amen I will walk in the light come on friends this message is light what the prophet taught is light what he said on those tapes is more than suggestions it's more than just understandings of a man what he's saying is scriptural light that was prophesied to come in this age he said the great storm of formality the great storm of indifference the great storm of denial of God oh God don't let me try to beef that light out let me use it to walk in I believe it Lord there you are amen walk in the light and as I see it in the scripture that's light it's God's word let me walk in it Lord let me walk in it never never try to deny it think about that friends brother said they could have used the light to carry him to safety but they used it to beat their brains out now yall know this just amen let me just say something to you amen there there are people who will take quotes and they will they will use the quotes with the wrong motive the quotes are lighted now come come on y'all know what y'all y'all been around long enough you know what I'm talking about amen amen let let let let somebody okay I won't get in trouble but I'm going to preach anyhow Amen brother said there's a great storm of formality coming right it's what he said so you get somebody who wants to fight the storm of formality we don't need formality we don't need formality so what they do is they go study the message and they get a big complacent of cloes where brother said I'd rather have a little Wildfire than no fire at all you know and then say something like amen if I got to get drunk and cow and amen what they're doing is are compiling light amen then they come to pit and they just stand there and beat and beat and beat and we don't need no formality there's a great storm coming and honestly that's a good quote but they're not using the quote right okay then you get somebody on the other side and they see a fanatical a fanatical move coming you know amen so what they get up is they get up say well we don't need none of this teaching well brother B said we did need teaching he said because teaching will positionally place the believer and he said that's the only way you can rightfully have faith is when positionally you know who you are in the word let me say this can we just quit using the message to find and just preach the word until it brings a liberty in the house of God and Eagles can begin to walk in that light and that light can carry them amen from this Dimension into that Dimension where all things are perfect you say preacher why are you saying that amen because our young people amen need to know this message is more than legalism it's more than just a bunch of quoes about what you don't do and what you don't wear and where you don't go and what you don't listen to they need to know that this message is rapturing Faith yes there is a clothline religion yes there is a call to Holiness yes there is a stone amen yes there is a stone in the hand of a prophet Amen to he you out of Le out to se it but at the same time it's the message of Grace it's not the message of legalism it's the message of Grace now before you can ever walk in this line you've got to step in the line remember said oh if we could ever come in the presence of God like Moses did he said why it was a revolutionary to him it would revolutionize in the light of what that angel of God stand there on the mountain that day everything that he once had or thought would never happen it come to be a reality I think if a man and woman today would it ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit listen to this under the unction of God's spirit and the light of God's word everything God has promised will illuminate to you and be real again so at one time the promise of Deliverance to Israel was real to Moses but when he stepped out of the light that promise become dmed to him but when the light come he steep back in the light and it become a reality he said oh that's the reason Moses faed in the first place it was the lack of having what the burning bush had that's what our failure today is is the lack of having what the Holy Spirit has see the Holy Spirit has all good things for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible they're not only possible but they're promised to us because Jesus said it he said ask the father anything in my name I will do it if he abide in me and my word and you ask what you will it'll be given to you see when we step into the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it brother The Impossible becomes little things then yes sir see when God's word his promise becomes enlightened by the presence of the Angel of the Lord Stop Moses now amen he is on his Road listen as long as he was standing in his human ability amen he slew one Egyptian and ran but when he stepped over into the light of the reality of God it put a courage in him to move into action you know what I say tonight friends I say it's time Amen to step out of man's ideas it's time to step out of traditions it's time to step out of what this man taugh and what this man thinks and what this devil told you about your future it's time to step out of all of that and step back over into the light of the word of God and then the promise of healing and the promise of Deliverance and the promise of the Rapture every promise that God Made You will become real again and will be illuminated when you stand underneath a precious light of his resurrection glory to God he say preacher you're awful excited I am because I stepped into the light and when I got in the light I realized there was time to put my walking shoes on come on it's time to put your walking shoes on you say really yes sir amen if you have stepped in the light amen listen the Bible says amen if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanseth us from all sin you say brother Andrew it's it's been a long time since I walked you know why it's been a long time since you walked it's cuz you've been standing in the glare of what some devil has said amen about your salvation you've been standing in the glare of what a doctor has said about your condition but all tonight if you could step over into the light of Isaiah 53 if you could step over into the light of Isaiah 53 concerning the healing and the atonement then all the promises of God would be illuminated and they would be again and you'd begin to put your walking shoes on you'd begin to walk again oh my amen y'all just forgive me but I just love sometimes to to step over and look at something in the Amplified Bible in 1 John chap 1: 7 listen to this the Amplified Bible says this but if we really walk in the light that is live each and every day in the Conformity with the precepts of God as he himself is in the light then we have true unbroken fellowship with one another he with us and we with him and the blood are y'all ready for this and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin Ready For This by erasing the stain of sin and is keeping us cleans from sin in all its forms and its manifestations church can I say it there is a blood and it's a powerful blood it's an atoning blood it's a cleansing blood blood it's a Soul Saving blood listen this blood has the power Amen to not only remove the sin but it has the power to erase the stain that the sin amen put upon you in the first place you say preacher I can't walk you're right you can't walk without the blood but if you've been covered in the blood you can walk in the power of Deliverance and salvation and healing oh my the power of the blood has the ability to erase the sins look at this word walk it means to make one's way it means to progress I love this one it means to make do use of opportunities when you're walking you're making do use of opportunities look at this word opportunity it is a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something some of y'all have been praying for circumstances to go away go ahead and praise God for them right now go ahead and praise God for circumstances because if you didn't have circumstances there would not be an ability to know that something good Could Happen out of these circumstances you know what an opportunity is it is a chance for success or advancement that occurs if you didn't have the circumstances David if you didn't have Goliath you would know that God could bring down a champion Philistine but if you have the circumstances but if you got God in your soul it don't matter what circumstances lay before you they are only put together to give you a chance to overcome them circumstances brother when you see the light walk in it he says walk you don't know where you're going but keep walking amen walk towards Calvary keep as sensible look at Calvary he says walking walking can I just say this we're not going backwards devil we're not retreating we are advancing can I get a witness here tonight I'm not going back I'm not retreating I'm advancing I'm going forward I'm going to put on my walking shoes I'm going to walk right out of this prison I'm going to walk right out of this situation I'm going to walk right out of this confusion he says in spite of dungeons or swords or storms God's Great Church marches onward and we're so happy to be a member of that blessed body looking shortly for the coming of our blessed Lord who will receive us up into his kingdom into presence there we will be with him forever oh the Glorious thoughts and the joy somebody shout for Joy The Joy the joy that sweeps through our souls when we look upon these promises listen friends I say if there's ever been a time Amen to wave the promises of God before the people of God now is the time to do it if there's ever been a Time come on parents if there's ever been been a time to take the promise of Victory and wave it over your babies Now's the Time to do it come on husbands if there's ever been a time to stand as the head of your house as the protector of your home as the provider and wave the promises of Abraham over that house I say now is the time to wave them because the joy of the Lord will return by the waving of the promises of God you say what are these promises I'll tell you what they are they're a broom uh y'all know what a broom is a broom sweeper come on church sometimes you don't want to but you got to sometimes you got to get up and sweep you know why because you got to get stuff out of there that don't belong there there's stuff accumulating that don't belong there you got to get it out listen friends there's things accumulate in our minds that does not belong in our minds listen there's things that accumulate in people's spirits that don't belong there can I preach to you amen there's things that accumulating marriages and little offenses and little ill feelings and this happen that all these things start accumulating and before long it gets so dark but you know what I say I say when you begin to look upon these promises of God when you begin to look upon the promise I am the Lord that Health all high diseases when you begin to look upon the promise that he will keep him and perfect peace whose mind is stayed on the Lord when you begin to look at these promises that you will have tribulation in the world but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world and ye will have peace in me when you begin to look upon these promises them promises are a broom and they begin to sweep depression out they begin to sweep nervousness out they begin to sweep confusion out I say oh God send the promises of the broom of your word into the sanctuary tonight and sweep out heart sweep out every life that's the joy of the Lord return hallelujah we're not going backwards we're going forward we are living in the advancement of the Gospel now this thing today says the church grain don't want to mature there we go you know why people don't want to go forward is they don't want to mature it's a lot easier to be a baby come on it's a lot easier to be a baby it's a lot easier to just say well the pastor didn't call me and he didn't visit me I don't live here it's a lot easier to say well the Deacon didn't shake my hand and he got my favorite parking spot and she got my favorite seat you're going to church ain't no need nobody loves me up there it's a lot easier yeah well let me just hit on that Spirit while I'm at it people say I'm not going back to church ain't nobody in that church Loves Me Do You Realize unless you've asked everybody from the oldest to the baby do you love me if you hadn't you're lying come on Church come on if you say well nobody in the church loves me okay have you asked from the eldest of Believers in the church have you been to them and said do you love me and then if you I guess brother r i guess your baby would be the youngest member of the church go back to the baby and ask the baby do you love me if not you're lying but what's happened is you've accumulated offenses and now those offenses are controlling your church attendance those offenses begin to control your praise you know what I say I say it's time to mature he said he said we want to stay like it was back in Moody's time or sank your F or oxer Calvin he said they were all right they were the light of the hour but this is another hour hour this is another day this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we can't live in what Luther said or what Wesley said or some of the rest of them we are living in the lot that's predicted for this day we are in the seventh Church age not the third or the fourth Church age listen the grain should be able to receive it if it doesn't it falls off and it means nothing to it the grain is matured with the life if it goes ahead with the light so the grain only matures as it advances with the light that has the ability to mature it listen friends that's why you need to stay underneath the light of the word of God and let the presence of the sun bake all the greenness out of us the hour has come to lay in the presence of the sun knowing this time that now is high time to wake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness let us put on the armor of light I pray this is okay Redeeming the time because the days are evil look at this Redeeming the time you know what that means it means to buy up every and each opportunity you know what that word time means it means the Supreme moment or the golden opportunity I love this one in other words Paul is saying redeem our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself redeem our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself said see don't never fail your opportunity Easter C 65 oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having we have opportunities Enoch and Elijah all them never had the opportunities we have now listen friends the conditions and circumstances are creating situations to give us Victory like has never been seen before Hallelujah the word has come in such power and such Revelation listen friends amen can I just close on this can I can I say something to you you are Enoch amen Enoch is a type of the Bride the believer now let me just say this Amen Let me just drop this to you okay Enoch done a lot of great things you know that you know Enoch built a pyramid he put the entire revelation of the Bible in a pyramid you know Enoch amen done that without any science or any education but simply following the leadership of the Holy Ghost or the spirit of God he built a pyramid but when we mention Enoch what's the first thing we think of his building of the pyramid or his walk Come On Church do we say do we do we commonly say Enoch built a pyramid Hallelujah no we say Enoch walked with God and he was not so out of all that Enoch done the most important and outstanding and remarkable thing about Enoch was his walk Hallelujah the most remarkable thing that Enoch is noted for is this that Enoch lived 6 and5 years and begat methusa listen and Enoch walked with God after he begat methusa 300 years he begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 300 60 and5 years listen and Enoch walked with god listen amen and he was not amen for God took him can I just I don't have time to go into Enoch's pyramid but let me just say this what was in the pyramid was more than just in the pyramid it was in Enoch's Place Hallelujah the Revelation that was sealed in the Pyramid of Enoch had become flesh in Enoch's body and it caused him to walk with God whatever God revealed to him about the future it put such a revelation in his soul that it caused him to walk with God can I just say something Enoch was not a single man oh God I'm getting on marriage right here at closing Enoch was not a single man he was married right take your Halos off come on come on Brothers get in the morning and this is going wrong and that's going wrong he was a man he had a wife I remember oh God I'm going get in trouble sure as the world I guess it's okay to tell it brother you can correct it when I fly back home it's almost it's almost comical I met a man one time he told me these words he said brother Andrew he said me and my wife he said we never had a crossed word he said we never had a disagreement he said I know you're fishing to get married he said I pray God give you a marriage like mine he said we ain't never had a disagreement we ain't never had an argument we ain't never fussed we ain't never had a gr we ain't never went to B bed mad at each other everything's just been perfect I got thinking dear Lord I ain't even married yet and I want to know what the kind of water they got down here in this country is then I met his wife and bust his heart she was deaf I thought brother met one brother one time an elder brother he told me he said me and my wife never had one argument he said we never had one cross word he said we were in the message and we believe the message he said everything we believe he said we never had one disagreement he said everything has been roses well problem was his son was sitting behind him when he said it he made his son made a statement he said well maybe we won't use the word argument we'll use intense Fellowship not trying to be funny but I'm trying to say something Enoch was like you Brothers but he still walked with God come on Church the Bible says this oh the church which is brother is the typ of Enoch 500 years how many days did his kids let him down but he still walked with God how many days did things not go the plan but he still walked with God how many days did he go without without come on without Sunshine maybe you know what I mean without maybe feeling like everything was right but he still walked with God can I tell you this tonight and leave it with you it's time to put on your shoes Enoch did that under the blood of bulls and goats yes yeah and the only thing the blood of a bull and goat could do it could remove the conscience of sin it couldn't remove the stain of the annihilation it could not remove it could not remove the desire to do it but under the blood of bulls and goats Enoch still Walks With God can I say this to you tonight if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with him and his blood cleanses us from all sins listen there's going to be days you don't feel like walking but walk anyhow there's going to be days that there's going to be misunderstandings in the house there's going to be ill feelings the devil's going to try to bring in he said but everything God said he did it he said why he walked with God walking in the light with a testimony so Enoch just kept walking the line and one day he felt his feet getting off the ground he just kept on walking and he walked on into Glory without even dying that's right amen God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony he walked walked in the light of God listen to The Prophet just keep on walking I love this one he says let's get on our walking shoes Church light has come and now is the time to walk in it you say how are we going to walk in it Walk Like Jesus one step at a time Lord I'm coming closer to you see the children of the light accept his word they keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says stay right in that and just keep walking if you walk in this light brother said this he said it's walking into a light that you've never witnessed before it's an anchor of a Divine faith that calls anything contrary to the word of God as though it was it I love this he says it puts New Life speaking of light it puts new life it gives hope to the dying it gives curage to the weak it gives healing to the sick it gives blessings to the unfavored how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence not a myth neither is it something that somebody is just fleshly in their minds drawn up but it's coming directly into the presence of the king of glory that Eternal Light of the Living God oh may we live such a Holy Communion 1963 such a holy consecrated life after this that men will see the reflection of Jesus Christ in us and that our walk in life would be worthy of the Gospel that we believe Enoch walked with God when he felt like it and when he didn't when he was on the mountain and when he was in the valley when things were good and things were bad he walked with God he stayed in that light oh church tonight how many can say Lord I want to be like Enoch I want to be like Enoch let our musicians come tonight I want to walk in this life I want this light to become my direction see we've come out of different walks of life maybe some have come from a denominational walk some from strength from the world some grown born and raised in the message we all come from different walks of life but we've all been called into the Walk of eternal life I love what the prophet of God says he said oh Father you who took the alcoholics and the prostitutes you've taken the fends you've brought them out of every Walk of Life and made ladies and gentlemen out of them another place he said The Exodus means the called out called out means the church and now God is calling his people out of every Walk of Life to come and receive him and to believe on him he says how Dreadful does the Walk of the modern Christian must be before God how we ought to alter ourselves alter our ways I want Wonder tonight how many could say Lord don't let me ever step out of this light if I ever step out of this light the promises of God will become dim and dull the offenses and things will fill my spirit Lord let me stay in this light maybe you're here tonight you stepped out of the light and all the promises of God had become dull to you can I say something to you tonight that lights in this building amen you know sometimes I think we get in our mind that we got to do something sometimes I think we get in our minds that we're the one that does the work but can I just let you in on a little secret the light does the work the light does the work it just needs to be turned on just needs to be turned on you know you go in a room brother B said he said you go in that room and it's real dark he said there's roaches and mice and all kinds of he said Critters and all kinds of things combined right there he said you go in there he said and it's dark because that's their habitation right they love dark you go in there and flip the light on the light automatically changes the atmosphere just by flipping the switch the light changes the atmosphere the light already takes away their comfort zone then you know what he said he said they'll scatter he said they'll scatter like roaches when the light comes on that's come on church if you walked into a room and it was completely full of roaches you flipped the light on they're going to scatter you know what you don't have to do you don't have to run around 10 get out of here go get out of here go get out of here the light done the work the light changed the atmosphere and it was more powerful and it drove them to the darkness where they belong can I just say to you tonight go home and turn on the tape turn on the light change the atmosphere in that home you ain't got to go home and fight and argue go home and turn on the light and let the light drive those Spirits out of the home the message of the hour is light turn it on and walk in it you love him tonight won't you stand to your feet with us you say this walk you're talking about it sounds like the Walk of Enoch it is sounds like the Walk of Jesus it is you say what kind of walk did they have a walk to fulfill the word that was spoken concerning them you've heard this quote many times I know but I just want to leave it with you just walk in conscience of fear walk unconscience of criticism walk unconscience of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or to the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God he got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen he said walk with God the doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah doctor says she can't get well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by the Covenant that he gives you that he confirmed it just walk with God then you'll have your ups and downs but don't worry you'll got to go through your Brier patches over the sharp rocks over the Bluffs down on the hillsides up through the mountains over Waters but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but how little it seem when you get to the end of the way my just look at there all that's been look back at your Footprints it won't be very much are you hearing me brother BR comes in the Rapture and says this Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I thought as a child he said see you act as a child but we're speaking of maturity right the grain matures with the light as it moves on with the light he said but as you grow older then you begin from making your first couple of steps and you toddle and you fall and you get up and try it again then after you while you get so you can walk a straight line that's what we have to do as soldiers of the Cross listen now it's time to walk a straight line right down that highway to glory walk with God I me tonight say Lord I want to put on my walking shoes put on your walking shoes Church get on the straight road to glory and walk right to Glory you love him tonight I want you to Bow your hearts with us tonight hallelujah how many can say Lord I want to walk with you Lord I know I've got troubles and shortcomings and but I want to walk with you Lord I know I'm human but thank you for allowing me to know Enoch was human yes Lord I know I have bad days but Lord Enoch did too but I still want to walk with you cuz he did Lord Enoch wasn't always on the mountain but he still walked with you maybe you're here tonight and you hadn't walked in a long time because of fear the reason you've quit walking is because you've become conscience of fear and unconscious of the light but if you'll become unconscious of the fear and conscience of the light you'll walk hallelujah hallelujah if you'll become conscious of the criticism and become conscious of the light you'll walk again if you'll become unconscience of the doubt and become conscience of faith you'll walk again listen friends tonight it's time to put on your walking shoes it's time to walk again it's time to step back in the light and every promise of God will illuminate and become real again almighty God we bow our hearts in your presence tonight Lord father we thank you for this meeting tonight Lord we thank you for coming by and speaking to our hearts Lord we thank you for Lord showing us your word father we thank you for sending us a prophet in this generation who didn't change the written word but he yielded

intellectual father if we ever could just sit down sometime and take time and comb through Enoch's pyramid all the things that he put in that pyramid Lord all the things that he put in there without without anything but you Lord and and all he needed was you but Lord he put so much Revelation in there but Lord all that Revelation that was in the pyramid moved into Hallelujah it moved into Enoch's flesh and it changed his body Lord you sent a message in this hour father you sent a prophet to tear off the top and Lord all those Revelations those rocks that were laying in there father they've come out and they're now accessible to the children and Lord the Revelation that was written is now made flesh in the lives of these Believers Lord we're walking according to the scriptures we're
