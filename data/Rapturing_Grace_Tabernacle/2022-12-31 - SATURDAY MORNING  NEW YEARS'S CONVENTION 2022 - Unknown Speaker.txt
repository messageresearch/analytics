bride in New Zealand father wherever they are wherever they gathered the precious family of God in New Zealand father may you bless them your People Israel because those who bless Israel they are blessed father and father for you because the funeral this morning Father may you with comfort and bless the families that are there father our heart goes with them Father we understand you have a plan for each and everybody's life father so we lay everything into your hands father may you anoint the speaker this morning and may your anoint the ears of the hero and we lay everything into your hands and ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah God bless you richly Hallelujah and I think very much the musicians I'm a may the Lord richly bless you for using your gifts for the glory of God and Hallelujah while we're standing let's open the word of the Lord amen I didn't continue to sing with this song because I didn't know it just therefore I I didn't dare to to Adventure without Authority because later you say this man comes from Germany he cannot preach he cannot sing what does he what candy does he what is he able to do so let us read The Familiar scripture in the Book of Joshua chapter 24 and I really if I'm really not mistake this is the last day of the year this is New Year's Eve is that correct so yeah so I trust that you make up your mind about about your Doctrine about your about your intention about the vision that you want to have and here we have Joshua he said this and if it seems verse 15 Joshua 24 15 most of you you know Baha because you have it hanging over your door as a little slogan and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as from me and my house we will serve the Lord Hallelujah that was a true amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word amen you may be seated so I I really greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's a it's a great honor for me to be among you and I couldn't say that it's this this is the best place for me to be because because somebody might stream from home and then I I I I I owe them an understanding but we have a wonderful wonderful atmosphere and if I'm not mistaken this is Brother Dean which is with us is that correct Brother Dean yes sir I remember really the the inspiration Division and I really want to greet all of you I want to greet the ministers I know that um you don't know me you don't need meat to come from Germany to bring you a message I know that New Zealand has very powerful very good Ministries and uh but somehow but the area had on it's hard for me to come and everybody has his specialty everybody has his uh uniqueness and and I'm happy that I shouldn't cope anyone or to be a copy of someone let me view my just myself huh but from my heart I want to give all my honor my respect to the ministry here to the family of God which is here in New Zealand it has a tremendous uh reputation starting already with our most number brother Sarah many many years ago and then different names what was about brother Paul brother Malcolm and many many names that have uh really uh left a wonderful impression when they came over to our place um so may the Lord richly bless you and um our heart goes on to you for the family who are mourning uh this morning we have the funeral May the Lord richly come for them will you bless them and uh blessed be the name of the Lord I want you like yesterday even just to relax uh I'm I'm sometimes a little bit of a starchy German sometimes a little bit humoristic that's just but again this morning I will not use any notes let me speak from my heart but I have some pictures that give me always a certain guideline okay always I know where I'm ending I know what's in between uh I'm like I'm like God you know he's Alpha and Omega we don't know what is in the in the middle of it but he's the beginning and the end there's some surprises in the middle of it okay so so God bless you richly and um I would like to to really deep speak in in these Services brother brother I already had on his heart that I take all the services it doesn't make me a special Minister but he was aware that I'm coming from far you know you're sitting two days in the in the plane for coming two it takes four days just to come back and go so he said man if he's here let him let him talk let him open his heart I appreciate this surely and and though I love to sit on the Ministries the same way especially if it has that kind of a quality that you have here when I was preaching yesterday after some year I felt on my heart that I'm talking to people who who know the message who not only know that God sent a prophet but but you know the message you see and that is a great uh a great contribution that the ministry here does so for today I want I want to ask to lean you back and if you wouldn't mind I will come down with because we make a little coaching this morning okay so I'll leave that place here it gives me a little bit of a nearness to you I would like to entitle the subject that we have it's a vision for the Next Generation a vision for the Next Generation okay and uh so so the familiar scripture that we have here is the Book of Joshua and Joshua takes uh the platoon over from Moses we realize that the ministry of brother Branham was the ministry of Moses that's how the angel uh presented himself and as Moses were given two signs uh you're giving two signs but it did not end with Moses brother Abraham had the ministry of Joshua exactly the same thing now I know there's no new people here and just to explain myself of of my background um this message is not a cult why should I become cultish what's the reason for it this message is not a denomination why should I become denominational this message is not a sect why should it become securian so this message is our father talking to us it was brother Brandon was just a voice the message that we believe does not from come from America it comes from the presence of Almighty is not an American message is an eternal message coming from God and and and and we're so thankful we are the only people on the Earth who doesn't have a religion we have a father that's different I mean we are the only one who doesn't have just a quote book and a notebook and and and and a Facebook or whatever we have we have a person that's our father I mean he takes care of us he's part of us and yesterday we have seen uh how how in somehow and I will not repeat all the thoughts but if if the coming of the Lord is the light for the Earth as Isaiah said and brother Abraham said you are the lights that means the bride is the coming of the Lord and still we are waiting to meet him in the air no contradiction at all but there is a coming of Christ referring to Revelation chapter 10. so we see and if we just show the first picture uh that I would like to just talk to you it's a teaching but I would want to show it a little bit in the coaching way so the time came that uh Joshua just a question brother can you close the door please because it just draft and if I'm sweating then everything will become uh I I want to be sick I will be sick thank you sir amen um so we see that Joshua how can I say he became an old man is nothing wrong to become old I remember many many years ago there was a time of brother in Jenkins as per theology brother learning how old are you he said look I became too oh I see brother Tony the same way Shalom are my brothers hey amen my brother Lonnie said brother America's I became too fast old and too slow wise no at that time I was laughing like you but today I feel like a little bit the same so God help us in this message not to become just old but wise we want to be I hope we can see it in the next service is this message has transforming power don't be the same old characterly ugly person that we were when we came into this message let us be transformed to become a light for Dying World we are this message Jesus there is the bride or brother Brahm said there is a people who will be the final voice of the final age and brother Brahm said under their messenger amen the message is not in books today you are that message today amen so as I said if as every father is the head of his home every Pastor is the head of a local church I'm a minister but I have to understand that my role is to be under a pastor there is not always a constant friction cannot be now as I said yesterday we are not in a sect so we have a liberty to have our own opinion we're not brainwashed we're not a sick I can say openly I see a difference even to my own Pastor I said even sometimes I say brother honestly I see a difference but brother Brahman said everything that has one more than one heads is a is a monster so I don't want to be part of a monster I said I have my opinion but you are the head so I will as long as in the word I keep you I will not I will not interfere okay that's so important because one day the pastors stand before God so the pastor is the head of our local church if I if I if I if I if I do not expect his authority sometimes you have to understand one thing and young people we needed some years to understand those things and because we saw the man and his failures and there were even some time where we're making a little bit fun about certain things but today we regret it because you have to understand the anointing is not only upon the man but upon the office of that man and God is blessing the office and you say but this man he makes these kind of mistakes God will bring this man to its few maturity can you say Amen I doubt if somebody cannot respect God's authorities on this Earth if we can really respect word authority I doubt if somebody cannot accept or respect worldly let me say laws a brother wanted to explain me that he doesn't pay uh taxes uh I don't know if it's the same expression here you you work black is that correct marking black that means you you you're a businessman and you're working and you get money and you don't pay taxes and he tried to explain to me he said brother Marcus from all these Texas Texas is it right taxation taxes okay uh uh the government just pays uh uh uh weapons and uh I will not pay Mrs Arden or sister Arden or whatever but I said brother Paul says if we cannot really be subject on the worldly Authority how can we be subject under God's Authority the natural types the spiritual so what happens is that the pastor is a local Authority but but but the messenger is the Authority for the age and Christ is the authority he's the head of all seven Messengers I'm sometimes asked the question brother Mark is is it can somebody correct the prophet I said sure God can amen God can correct the prophet because he did it all through the Bible okay but if for us to correct the prophet is very very difficult okay can you say Amen so what happened is this that that Joshua became old and I can see him like some of these older people uh and suddenly they're a little bit shaking okay and I can't see oh Joshua was was was an older man and so these Elders came and they asked him about the vision I can see him to stand up with his art Treatise you know I said gentlemen I want to let you want to sing one thing Revelation has nothing to do with age [Laughter] he said I don't know what is your opinion about that message but as for me and my house we serve the Lords keep one thing in mind you're never too young to serve the Lord never because the same voice that tell the young people you are too young is the same voice he will tell you five years later you are not too old that's Satan himself you're never to your and you're never too old Revelation is not a question of age can you say Amen so Joshua was a man who could see all the uh all the scandals in the first Exodus he was not now if he was there when when when when Dayton rose up when Cara rose up when Miriam rose up he was there he saw all the backs black spots in what they call the message of Yahweh for their day look on upon the human [Applause] brother uh I was raised up in the world completely and what happened is when we came to Jesus uh we didn't see the message in the beginning but just little bits fundamental thing and um we're making sometimes Street evangelizations okay and you always have people who tell you there's nothing in Christianity it's just a little bit people are a little bit brainwashed you just change your religion you change your but I came out of the world as I said yesterday I was a Michael Jackson fan I could dance like Michael Jackson honestly I can make the moon walk if you want but we will not make it here okay but if somebody wants to discuss with me that there is nothing in Christianity I tell him brother honestly you come too late you're too late because I see it in my own life the changing is more than just Theory and a person wants to discuss about the messenger and brother Branham and if there were 13 people who fell from that bridge of 15 people that for me it does not have any importance if there were 13 or 15 people falling from that Ohio Bridge but I can see the effect of the open word in my own life and I think honestly brother you come too late honestly because because uh brother you you you you are too sleepy if somebody wants to discuss about the messenger he said brother you had 50 years too late because it went from the messenger to the message it went from the prophet to the prophecy we are not brand hamites we are Christians well this is bright age can you say Amen so judge so Joshua he saw all the scandals and brother where there are human beings there are scandals that's normal there's Humanity there is weakness there is failures there is headlines there's did you see this and did you see that but I want to say the young people don't don't look left or right look on the promised Age The Promised word for this age can you say Amen so what happens is this and and that's going to a little bit of a teaching what it means to bring a vision for the Next Generation not a Doctrine a vision not some Brandon pictures that that will not save nobody you can become fan of Jeffersonville fan of Marcus Becker but that will not change your life until you find God in that whole thing as we were saying yesterday it's it's it's so important to find brother Branham in the Bible then it makes him to be a Biblical Prophet but it takes more than this you must find yourself in the Bible I know that I'm repeating myself but I'm just talking just from my heart that somebody hear it again amen we remember when that airplane when it when it when it when it when when it stopped there in Memphis and brother Graham heard that voice he says just go and he just went and here was that woman and brother by him called it a negro woman I'm not political correct but you understand what he wants to if you call it black or colored or African origin however what it let me call it brother Braham said huh and he was the woman hanging over that fence and when brother Brandon passed by she said hello Parson that correct no God is in humor normally it's brother Branham Discerning the people your name is Eva I can see you here is a car accident I can see you here but here that woman discerns the prophet he does not know who she is but she knows who he is amen amen and then she says this he said you're a person you are the Prophet Elijah and then she said something which is even higher than this and I am the shunamide woman amen so you find out who the messenger is and then you find out and then then I must be the bride can you say Amen we heard yesterday nobody can preach you into it and nobody can preach you out of it nobody can you say Amen so we see that we are in another Exodus and we have a every every Exodus or every Redemption has two parts it's a coming out by a pillar of fire and a going in amen there is many people who left the illuminationalism they left the world they left the Pentecostals whatever they left but the question is did they go in into the Promised lands and our inheritance is not leaving Egypt our inheritance is the promised lands can you say Amen now there were different ministers in that Exodus we have some Daytons in some chorus uh I mean well I'm not I'm not a critical type of a person but Dayton and Korra said we have a Ministry too so my tapes are as good as brother branham's tapes I said well you can have a wonderful message you can have a wonderful preaching but laodicea has only one voice in the days therefore we are not promoting our own tapes I'm not for it I'm not in it I don't want nobody to stream me I'm against it because I find out that young people became fans of preachers and it never helped him on long-term effects you must find Christ in your heart and you must be able you must undersea understand that I know we have a slogan in Germany which says the grass of the neighbor is always greener than your own grass you have the same in your country and then you get jealous why didn't I live in these states why don't I live in God placed you here and God will take care of you here can you say Amen [Applause] so we have these people that that that that were not really cults okay brother if somebody is not called of God he can talk but a talker is more than a minister a minister is more than a talker these people were politicians they could talk Jason and Korra but I want to say you one thing if you're not following a certain development from Egypt to the promised lands and you are following just a talker you are just walking in circles amen and if you're just walking in a circle you come to the point that you have to entertain people that's the reason in the message after brother Birmingham left we have always a new man of the hour you have to invite him so that the pillar of fire comes you have to invite this brother we saw yesterday the tent Vision I will meet you there where is the tent the bride is the tents we saw it yesterday amen that's interpretation but it was a symbolic vision amen amen so so people go from one event to the next event and they don't understand that they are just entertained for the next three months but in the bride there is a true growth you're not the same when you leave that year 2022 please look back into January 2022 and you must be able to say I'm not the same person that that entered into 2022. only grow in knowledge but my character was molded it can you say Amen amen therefore if a minister was never in the promised land how can you lead people into the Promised lands how can you do this he can entertain people but he cannot lead them really into a full adoption blessed be the name of the Lord so we have it we have a going out and we have an entering in therefore maybe I'm you know I'm I'm missing some time words and sometimes I have like a soldiers English that means I always make a subject predicate object subject predicate object because I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm not a native English speaker uh and I'm I don't have the variation of words but I'm strongly against the fact that somebody says I'm in the message what does that mean I'm in the message nothing nothing amen you can be you can be a child abuser and be in the message the question is am I in the promised land or not Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord all these people in the first Exodus they were in the message amen so I want to encourage you to continue into the promised land and we will see this morning that we are already in the promised land next one please okay can you can you help the technician thank you now we have seen this and if it's fine for you I put off my coat okay because I'm really making here jogging that that's what that's what I told I mean I really love your worship really love that atmosphere uh but sometimes you go to to different countries like uh uh whatever I understand it's a mixed mixed multitude here okay and sometimes they have a they have a they have a song service you know I mean and and I'm in it I'm really I'm I'm many times invited for you scams so but if you think for 45 minutes these people after 45 minutes they are finished you know no honestly you don't have to preach anymore because they are just so so everything is a balance in life always keep a balance between everything okay so now friends I believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever I believe he's just as able this afternoon to cross in this building what does brother Graham say a paradox amen how much more it is leaving the Bible to this very age that we are living the Ephesians again of the church ages we got seven Church ages and we are promised that at the loudest Seer Church age there would be another Ephesians keep in mind not Ephesus but Ephesians that's the difference I mean that's right therefore we see we have seven Church ages seven Messengers but we have a church or we have a time and age in between of laodicea what we call Bright age brother Brahm said another Ephesians now why Ephesians because when for every marriage we are reading Ephesians I think Ephesians 5. husband love your wife the mystery is great because I speak of Christ and the church so the church received their husband which is Christ himself can you say Amen so therefore bright age is not another church age we are still in love this year but we are not allowed this year we're not we cannot be look how simple it is that we are living in loud is here because our precious sister Arden is not the prime minister in the millennium she's not a man but uh we are still living here but the bride went already up spiritually in rapturing Grace why why is this so important not because brother Graham said till the end he said Christ Revelation chapter 3 he's knocking at the door but the door of laodicea is closed at the same time we believe that we live in a invisible Union invisible Union between the Heavenly bridegroom and the and the Earthly bright amen Christ and the bride right in the Union right now it's a marriage right now the feast is over there but the marriage is already here so if Christ is not in laodicea because the door is closed and you want to have a want to have a reunion with him but he cannot come into laodice here that means the bride must live loud is here to go out of the camp in order to have fellowship with him if somebody says I'm still in laodice here spiritually I said okay fine and you are blind miserable and and wretched and I believe the bride is not blind no amen the bride is not miserable amen I mean because her glory is the Lord and the bride is not wretched because the husband is here he is here hallelujah can you say Amen but it's not enough at church age because we have just seven okay but it's a special time this time that we live in is spiritually what seven Church ages waited upon amen next one please so so we have to understand this amen we have seven Church ages and up there that uh red triangle is our Promised Land spiritually said it's our it's the purpose of the whole New Testaments amen but if you see face virtue knowledge one two three four five seven is brotherly love that means we have an eighth H we don't have an eighth age it's out of the Bible so that triangle has to come down connect with the rest of the body and we have seven again can you say Amen but we see in the beginning the day of Pentecost was in the beginning before the first church eight starts to understand what it means to enter into the promised land means to understand your beginning okay let us now see the beginning make the next one please make a good Bible orientated study the resume of the church age with this principle in mind we start to trace the church through the various Seven Ages the birth of the church was at Pentecost as the first Adam was giving a bride fresh from the hand of God and for an undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a bright pure and fresh and Pentecost and she remained separated and undefiled for some time and so forth how long this continued we do not know but one day even as Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it would should come and even now already it is in the world John 4 3 amen the church was in that first age already a fallen woman as Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam even now had Satan seduced the church the bride of Christ before the marriage supper of the lamb and what specifically was in her midst that caused her to fall now I start that little uh exhortation with two statements that nobody in misunderstands me every young person needs a new birth don't listen you need a Holy Ghost I said yesterday we have to pay attention not to educate our youngsters to become rich young rulers they know to behave in the church they have the right dressing they have the right Behavior they read the message but then they don't know what Grace is They Don't Know What Love Is they don't know what what what what what a heavenly father is so everybody needs the Holy Spirit the other thing is this the new birth is not the end of our spiritual journey in fact it's the beginning it's the beginning of the thing not the end of it our final destination is not the new birth it's a pure adoption can you say Amen that's so important the second statement that I want to make which is provokense if you don't accept it right now it's not a problem uh lay it under your pillow but my question is this I know that brother Brian uses used that word of back to Pentecost it became a slogan in the message and there's nothing wrong with that slogan if you place it right if you misplace it you bring people back to another age into a glare of another age but if the first church was already a fallen woman when Paul came why should I go back to something that fell in the beginning yeah true yeah if the first church was already according to the prophet a fallen woman when the first messenger came why should I go back to the to to the first why should I go back to something that fell in the beginning I mean don't you think that we have more than they ever had before amen okay let's explain what happened and then you will understand that provoking statement that I made right here let's look and let the Bible speak for itself and then you understand why we have to enter into Canaan everybody has amen make the next one please I thank the technician for coming now to understand the book of Acts is to understand Jewish religion the Jews in their time are the synagogue consisted of three types of people okay one were true Jews everybody who has a Jewish mother becomes a Jew the Jewish religion is not an evangelistical religion though you can become a Jew if you want one of the most famous prosolites becoming a Jew is Marilyn Monroe because she married Arthur Miller who was a Jew and she changed from Christianity to Judaism she became a Jew the second group of people in the synagogue where what we call proselytes proselytes are people who are in favor of that religion but they don't want to go all the way they for example they don't want to be circumcised but their love for example the the uh the moral part of Judaism which was always highly morally they love this so you can call it people who who who who are not born Jews but they try as Jewish as possible and the third group of people is what we call God-fearing people they are all listed up in the book of Acts I will you not use my time for this God-fearing people is people who love to go to the synagogue but they take what they want to take and they reject what they want to reject they're not Jews but they love the service they love the kind of let me say it like this you have a right in this message to be just a simple sympathent of the message you have a right to do somebody says look if brother Brown speaks against the television doesn't interest me I do what I want God says you can be whatever you want you can choose a sister can choose to wear dresses or not we are not a sect I mean gospel is for God born again people I mean you have to understand we are that was our mistake for many many years we tried to let our lives our children live as if they would have the Holy Ghost but they never had the Holy Ghost so it brought a constant frustration upon the family upon the pastor upon the people about the young people if somebody is not born again he's worldly okay that's what it is so you have a right don't argue with me somebody says brother Marcus we have these Germans and they say they say I like my beer I said brother Brian said that Nazarite doesn't drink alcohol I said I still love my beer I said that's fine that's up to you that's between you and God who am I amen you have a right to choose your way with God but one thing is sure the bride will take all the way okay but there are people who who who are in the message because of the moral standard they like it they're not interested in Mysteries leave these people like they are they're good people as I said yesterday brother Abraham said Abraham was a silver dollar lot was just some pennies but some pennies have a value I mean you go into a grocery shop and you buy some bananas and it's 1.15 he said here you have my dollar and the man said where are the 15 cents I mean pennies is not nothing pennies is anything and here's what brother Brandon says he said some people are just pennies but God uses sometime those pennies praise the Lord if somebody is not bright you will not change him to be a bride by just yelling at the person we learned in our life we cannot change things that God never changed amen so these are three three type of people okay so the gospel comes and you have to understand judahism I'm sure that brother Adrian will will as in Israel uh Noah he will agree with me when the first church started the day of Pentecost they were the fulfilling of Joel and so forth the Jews were waiting for the Messiah that's what they said on the way to Emos we thought he would rebuild the kingdom of God again but they had in their mind a political Kingdom exactly the Jews until today were not convert to Christianity because they believe the Jews are the chosen people till the end they say and that is what Jesus said in the book of of of of of of Mark he said and he taught saying unto them it is not written my house shall be called of all Nations the House of Prayer Jews believe that everybody will become Jew at the end or at least respect Jewish religion therefore they built the Third Temple in to think that this scripture will be fulfilled that the whole world will now uh Worship in Jerusalem the Jewish god the god of Elohim hmm so what happens is this that they believed in the Holy Spirit because it was prophesied by Joel but they didn't see that they are now leaving Judaism and now a new religion start by the name of Christianity the first Christians were Jews with the Holy Spirit they didn't they never called themselves Christians they were called the first one were an Antioch they were Jews but now is the holy spirit okay make the next one please because that is very very important now you put on your spiritual jacket you understand why you have to enter into the land the day of Pentecost was 33 after Christ 1833 then we have the conversion of Saint Paul and then Peter goes up in the house of Cornelius and now I prove you by the scripture he said this he entered into the house of Cornelius and here's Peter around about 10 years after the day of Pentecost round about seven six ten years not precisely he said and he said unto them you know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or to come unto one of another Nation but God has showed me and so forth so Peter identified himself to be a Jew got it he comes into the house of Cornelius and he doesn't say Okay Jewish tradition is over we have changing of dispensation we are Christians he said it's unlawful for a man who is a Jew though he had already his Pentecost but he did not know who he was therefore he continued with Jewish tradition and you see at the end that the church in Jerusalem though they had The Holy Spirits that when Paul came James said to him look your ministry is great it's wonderful but there is so much stir what does he say go into the temple shave your hair and show that you obey the loss of your father that was the pastor in Jerusalem 20 years after the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were the first church but they were completely Jewish amen so the first Christians we fight in Antioch and I want to now show you the problem and you you're just with me then you will really understand how we have to proceed into the promised land a vision for the Next Generation now we make a separation line look for example okay we make it here you are this part and the rest is this part you are converted Christians after the day of Pentecost one of the three thousand and later you come now to the Christian Church James is your pastor but James and the church at that time they were still serving the Torah they still went into the temple to worship as before they were reading the Torah they were having their Shabbat nothing changed only that they were gathering themselves around the word of God because there were just some Scrolls but they knew we are the Fulfillment of Joel so I will pour out my Holy Spirit upon All Flesh that's us praise the Lord God confirmed let's serve uh Jehovah better than ever now you are the group okay you are that group you came later to Christianity and you don't know what Judaism is you came from Antioch you never read the Torah you don't have you don't know what Shabbat is because you see but you are now Christians and you understand how Paul had to bring both sides and he bring them to the Cross he said some whole special days higher than others others don't because he's now speaking to two complete different groups they say look you have to be circumcised because it is an eternal Covenant of God and Jesus Christ never took that Covenant away you say I mean we never know what the circumcision is We Believe In Christ we believe in the cross in Calvary I mean what you see they say you have we cannot work on Shabbat because this is an eternal Jesus never said I will I will uh demolish the law he said I will fulfill every law they do not work on Shabbat they say I don't know Shabbat what is your Shabbat Shabbat is working day you can imagine the tangents both were in the Church of Antioch you got it the first church the First Christian Church were Jews with the Holy Spirit Peter said I'm a Jew though he had the day of Pentecost already behind it you have the same Holy Spirit but you don't have any kind of Jewish tradition but the Bible says there's one faith one large so there's two different groups I want do you want to be the pastor of that group man but Paulie had to he had to address to them but he had to show look there's a changing of dispensation but he had no real word for it so what they find out is we will meet in Jerusalem for the Jerusalem uh what they call Jerusalem Council amen and I make that long story short so they come up to Jerusalem he says and the Bible says acts 15 and certain men which came down from the Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved so it's now a question of salvation he said you cannot be safe they say okay I was never certain said why should I be circumcised exactly but it rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed so they were Christians former Pharisees amen which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses because they can refer to Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ never abolished the law of Moses never amen and the apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter matter and when there had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them man and Brethren you know that a good while ago God made Choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should heal the word of the gospel and belief it continues then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul the Bible doesn't say Paul and Barnabas but Barnabas and Paul hmm Simon has declared how God at first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name and to disagree the words of the Prophet as it is written and so on look they have now a dispute and let us make now a choice who will now give an answer to that big disputes if we could choose we would have would have chosen all of them Peter because Peter is the one who got the Keys of the Kingdom Peter was the one who was sent first to the Gentiles Peter was the one who who was the spokesman of the day of Pentecost amen is that correct Peter was the one Peter was the most prominent one Peter was the one who the Lord says feed my sheep Paul was not born yet or was not in inside now you put now you put on your spiritual jacket and then I show you how you have more than the early church ever had while you're sitting you say we don't have the same Miracles that's not the question but you have more insight amen because Paul said I was born to be a man out of season as Paul was not in the upper room brother Branham was not in Azusa Street and brother babe said I'm like Paul I'm a man born out of season amen you get it so they had the upper room experience and God kept Paul away amen so that the first church could fall not in sin they have the Holy Spirit but they did not know who they were they still believed that they were Jews amen make the next one because here's what brother Brahm says a seal is open what is it a mystery is unfold and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sound it declares a war or a plague Falls a church age open C what is that war the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not yet fulfill revealed but when he does he catches the mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people and so forth now here is the thing you put on your spiritual jacket why the first church fell Paul was the spokesman Peter was the spokesman but Paul was the angel but Paul was not considered to be the angel for them Paul was just a nice missionary amen but you can never find your own identification if you don't see who the messenger of that age is you understand that I mean in the Garden of Eden Eve could talk to all kinds of animals Mr elephant uh that's so wonderful can you tell me who I am from where I come from and Mr elephant said I don't know it's just a wonderful time here but I don't know from where I'm coming there was only one who could tell Eve from where she comes and that was Adam Adam could say you come from me and there is only one who can tell the bride who she is from where she comes and that's Christ so Paul was among them and he was the messenger but he's not recognized recognized to be the messenger amen so Peter spoke James spoke the Apostle spoke now if we would be transformed in the early church here's Marcus Becker amen we're sitting there and I'm sure you agree I'm coming down I said hey first of all I want to say shalom second I want to say Peter sit down James sit down the angel is Paul he has the mystery it is only revealed to the angel of the age sit down and stop your discussion the angel of the churches is Right among you [Music] but if you don't see the messenger you will not never find your position you get it the Bible never said in the book of Acts and praise the Lord and the Apostle said our Messengers they never recognized him till the end the only thing that Peter saw oh he speaks of very high things that we don't understand but the Bible never said now the the apostles found out who the messenger was because the concept of a messenger was instituted 50 years later by John on the Isle of Patmos but if you don't understand who your messenger is I mean you listen to any kind of voices so these people were full of the Holy Ghost but they did not know who they were they didn't see the change of their dispensation and neither they saw their own messenger so it was really clear if it was easy for Satan to deceive them because you only will be undeceivable if you know who you are can you say Amen therefore brother babe said the day of Pentecost was 33 after Christ and the first church it starts 53 after Christ there's 20 years and in that 20 years that woman was already a fallen woman ready you saw already what happened God allowed because if Paul would have been on the upper room one of them and being a prophet that church would have find her position and the Rapture would have gone already in the first church age can you say amen God allowed it because he has a plan for seven Church ages God blinds and he opens whenever he wants amen if brother Branham would have been 1909 or 1906 on Azusa Street and they would have received him as a prophet that church would have gone because it was the true Holy Spirit but what they were missing is that inside who they were is a placing of the word you get it now who are you who told you who the messenger is the same Holy Spirit speak unto that sunamite woman blessed be the name of the Lord look you take one of our teenagers what what is your name yeah Stella now here we have sister Stella make it simple sister Stella now she comes in a time machine jump she looks around and here comes Martin Luther Zella comes he said Martin Luther I see you brother Mr Luther let me ask you a question can you tell me who the fifth angel was Mr Russo said I don't know about these wings and all the no no that was you do you understand that the seventh angel revealed all the rest of them they say man therefore God had to send the prophets praise be to God for the Holy Spirit and never diminish it but it's the beginning now to come into your full full identification can you say Amen that was the problem Peter was the spokesman Peter had the prominence but he had no clue because he was not the Angels this mystery comes to the angel Devil's Paul and Paulie was just sitting there he said hey gentlemen see I should I'm sure that Paul knew who he is because Paul said this I am a wise master builder and everybody has to build upon what I say he knew who he was but he had no scripture and unless God is opening the eyes of these people you are just in ignorance so you can be Brides without knowing that you are unless God is revealing Who You Are and then nobody can steal it away from you therefore I'm so against all the altar calls over and over again because if I wanted to get the young people to the altar it's simple there's not a problem to have an altar called this body who among you have some time dirty thoughts no the first one is the minister himself amen who is the Holy Spirit and then I'm speaking and who doesn't pray enough and when did you make the last miracle and when it was this and the whole audience comes in the front they are sincerest people but the same Minister has to come back next year and may ask the same question the same people are in the front again it becomes a Catholic thing but you must find first who you are in the sides of Gods and from that picture on you can now develop into the full potential brother Brandon said it like this he said he said if you want to be healed you must see a healed person right before you it's your vision and you are entering into that direction and you're entering to that healed body what about the rapture the same principle you must therefore it was the grace of God going behind the curtain of time and what does he say I saw all of you there sometimes I don't feel to be bright sometimes I don't feel to be safe something but I said I don't go after my feeling I know I'm there and the reason that my representation is there is that I love that message so much can you say Amen and while I'm looking to the perfect picture of me all the Natural Things in me they just vanish away with the time my old sticky nature can you say Amen I give it the same example you say brother Marcus how can you say that a minister can have dirty feet dirty thoughts now that can happen just with me okay okay nobody has no everybody should say oh I don't understand that I cannot him here's brother Brian and brother brother Lonnie told us that that story and just if you want to help people you must be honest with them instead that one is lying to the other and one is pretending to the other man stop that thing if you know a person long enough you know he's human failures anyhow his brother Lonnie told you that thing about about the prayer line of brother Branham he said here is an older man and a brother and they had a prayer line like they had in Pentecost you know everybody is now laying hands and you go through a tunnel everybody what is not wrong laying on of hands is not wrong but it's not our message for today but it's not wrong if somebody needs it let's do it no problem so the world praying and one of the brothers had really vulgar thoughts and he was so embarrassed about that so so I mean you were in the prayer line and I think about this and I think about girls and whatever and he said then later brother praying just comes to him lays his arm he said hey brother you had a hard time isn't that so he said brother Brian I'm so embarrassed we're in the prayer line in the Holy presence of God and have these kind of wrong thoughts and brother rims said this he said these thoughts were addressed to me but we were standing in the line of fire amen you must understand that your thoughts is not you I'm not my complex I I I will speak in the next days I'm dealing with a lot of people who have psychological problems and I see how God is changing them but it's changing by showing them really their true nature and that's one of the sisters told me one time she has problems with depressions and ups and downs and a little bit maybe borderline whatever you can call it she says this brother Marcus my psyche is not my soul I said that's what it is my psyche sometimes is up and something's door went down but my soul is always in the presence of them I said hey you got something can you say Amen now I'll give you another example I'm to show how far you are already on your way if you believe it or not we're not talking who does the most miracles in our life but I show you how you have much more understanding than ever before here is brother Branham and he is in a Christian breakfast together with Billy Graham Billy Graham he says that noble words we have always heard them he said I go to a city have 30 000 converts and after one year there's only 30 left and brother blame said this who was I to talk to a great man like Billy Graham like this he said Billy who was the man and Billy Graham said you lazy preachers you lazy pastors you don't go to visit those people and brother Brian said who was the lazy Pastor visit in the converts of Paul but do you see the picture is wrong if Billy Graham would have known who is William Branham he would have shut up his mouth he would have said stop I'm an evangelist but here is the messenger but he didn't see he thought well I'm the man of full of stadiums and here's William Brandon Buddha I would have I would be there as your simple brother Marcus I said hey Billy stop that nonsense sit down or else sit down the messenger is here let's hear what he has to say can you say Amen because why is he more no but he gets the mystery for the age can you say Amen what what a Time therefore the First Church Must Fall because they don't didn't know who they were they were Jewish until we see then how the procedure goes on you know how Christianity separates and you think but Paul is here and you can see the whole book you can see the New Testaments amen there never one time is written in the book of Acts that all the apostles said now we realize the messengers here they never saw what is God was hiding that thing so that the church could fall not in sin not in immorality no no but they never found who they were when brother Ben would have been on Azusa Street we would not be here because that church would be wretched but God in his grace knew there are some kiwis who have to be saved can you say amen and some Germans who love the Lord and God says we I have some children who are out let me let me repeat what I said well I said yesterday I'm just falling make the next one please I'm because we're hurrying through amen amen here is the picture and you never make that mistake there is a message for the church whosoever will let him come brother this message is not a sec don't make it sectarian you can go with that subject of the Lamb leaves The Mercy Seat so far that I told the brother I said look here's somebody who never was a Christian okay he's now in a hospital and he has to die he finds the Bible he finds the Bible he's opening the Bible and he reads all that he loved he gave he gave all that accepted him he gave power to become Sons and Daughters of God will that man be saved without having read any message book secure because if not if you say he has to read the message you become saved and I say what kind of message before the seals are after The Seals do you understand you end up in a cult brother blame said the the Bible is the book of the year he says the Bible is the book of every year bright is different bride has a leader that is the messenger but Salvation pay attention come in here comes brother Brandon and he speaks about you about about about about about the Jews and what does he say amen he says he says when it comes to to to to to Salvation for the 140 44 000 he said now another Redemption is opened has nothing to do with the bride nothing to do with brother Brennan I mean how can that Redemption be open because of calvary because uncovery God paid the whole price it is finished for everybody who would come so if somebody comes and you see another message and and he says but I received the portion that I can give give him Grace amen if not you end up in a car you must know brother Branham to become safe brother it takes Jesus Christ away and puts William Branham at his place you cannot do this very dangerous you end up in a complete cult amen look here we go a trumpet denies denounce always War amen the angel come Earth the messenger of the hour like loose any message that we talked of what does he do he arrives a seal opened reveals a trumpet sound a wall declare away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group they are put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected it so here's the other Point Salvation connected to the message for their hour definitely so come in what is it then it goes on they organize get another organization make the next one please here is the next thought that we have about a vision for the Next Generation when the word is presented it is salvation or it is judgment either you're getting safe or judgment or is an ignorance that God accepts on the right thrown job you never knew the message then God has a way no problem but look and you put on your spiritual jacket he said when they were at kadish paneer to enter into that place he said what was the test they all drink the same Rock they all eat the same spiritual manner as they were eating this morning but the word tests proved them when they come of the time of kadish barnea when they started over into the promised land that's our subject and they could not go over till they was tested by the word and all the other ten came back and said we can't make it the people are like we are like grasshoppers to them they're great wall City the opposition is too great but Joshua and Caleb Still the people that said we are more than able to do it why says brother Brennan God said before they left the promised land I given you the land I've given to you it's yours but there were one out of each million I put a debt you put on the spiritual jacket how and we will see the next days how all kinds of denominations and reformations hinders your true walk with Christ this message is contrary to everything that we had until now this is bright age this is age of adoption I mean this is a time this is the time where the sun rose up now they come and these these uh these Messengers come from the promised land and they go back and they tell the people the land is true God didn't lie but what did they say we cannot make it brother you have to listen to people in the message and they speak about the Rapture they fear the rapture the the Rapture is soon and uh say brother the rapture God is not saying the Rapture for New Zealand is okay I will take I will take just these and they don't have a chance the Rapture is God taking his children home but brother I'm not ready but God made you ready already these people said the land is good but we cannot make it God said I didn't ask you to make it and they remember Joshua and Carla Caleb they had the same feel like all the rest but they remembered that God said on their Journey when you enter into the promised land you will you will have the Feast of uh unleavened bread or the Feast of Tabernacles God did not say I don't know if you make it in case that you will do it and we will see what God sees them already in the land and he says you will enter [Applause] hallelujah amen and Joshua and Caleb said we don't know how but God said we enter praise the god that was the worstest the rest looked unto themselves but Joshua and Carla looked to God's promise can you say Amen therefore this messenger said look I saw you on the other side and say praise the Lord I was preaching it because we Germans we think humble means to be negative the Rapture is very very very few and I'm not knowing if I'm worthy of that whole thing and and I don't know what Putin does and what Arden does and what the future holds and I came to the front I said praise the Lord I make it and I got criticized in the church how can you be so bold to say I make it he said because David said your goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life I said the same old how could David he prophesied already about his future and he became a self-fulfilling prophecy his goodness and his Mercy will follow me all a day of his life [Music] humbleness is not to be a Catholic priest I I don't know if I'm words [Applause] Hallelujah I said to a person if you do not believe that God brings you home you do not believe in Calvary because you start with Calvary where God paid the whole price and now the rest you want to do it by yourself and you think the Rapture is some kind like uh like to earn something or a special Rewards the Rapture is for those who always go to church not only Sunday Wednesday too that's how we believed it you know I mean and we were thinking okay if God has to choose for the Rapture about that okay I mean I go every service yeah yeah yeah I'm better already than all of them they just come on Wednesday ah I went Sunday and then I'm paying my tithing I know he has some people they're not paying that I think so my chances my brother the Rapture is different is not a reward system God calls his children home brother that is the picture God we I know I showed it yesterday God before the foundation of the world he made a picture of himself like Oh Brother Beckett showed here was the family of God not arrogant but proud about Allah that's what I said yesterday we are the only people in the world who don't have a religion because this message is not a religion this message is our father talking to us and God made a picture and he took our souls and thrown them in seven Church ages on seven countries some in Germany some in New Zealand some here some and God knows one thing my sheep hear my voice and he knows one thing when seven churches over the family of God and the best brother by him was the messenger who could say God is not complete anymore without you because David said in the Psalms he said he even placed eternity into my heart I mean God put placed part of himself into our hearts when we were born and we were in the world there was already a mystery deep in US some of the things that brother Brandon tells him when you see that little Eagle story you see here is Mother eagle and little Eagle the little Eagle never knew that he was an eagle he was trying to be a worldly person like the rest but the mother knew who the boy was the boy did not know the mother but the mother knew who the boy was so we were in the discotheque doing all kind of nonsense and our father was already thinking oh boy it's time to call you because you make too much nonsense on this Earth amen can you see amen I remember therefore if our children don't go the way never be embarrassed God allows those things he wants to see our reaction God was never ashamed of me though I was in the world because he saw the inside part of me can you say Amen amen can you say Amen what a father we have it matters to serve the Lords I always say this amen if you look to yourself forget it gospel is good news even if you I mean if even if we are in menopause it's still good news sometimes we feel safe and sometimes we don't feel look here's the man by the name of job and he's so depressed and he's down he said curse it be the day when I was born quote the Bible curse it be today and God at the same time in heaven said that's my servant what a great man is nobody like him I'm so proud about the man and job said oh cursed to be that day I wanted the message and God said I'm so proud about my boy [Applause] because he knows if I will talk to him he will understand who he is and God just tells me ask him a question job hey stop scolding where were you boy and job was thinking oh God forgive me I talked about things that were too high can you say Amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so so so the same make the next one so the same we have to understand another brand in 1960. now Paradox again he said I was about three o'clock in the morning suppose I got up looked where in front of me I was coming down to Jordan looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine and I was coming down to the Jordan seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to Jordan someone was singing it and as I drew near the river I looked back and seen which way I had come it was two-thirds of the way there to Jordan and I looked across John and said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lay in the Promised Land that means brother Brandon is 1960. but he's not yet in the Promised Land but he says I'm now enjoyed two-thirds that's my own interpretation two two two two two two pulls it's now done but he says that's not the end of my Ministry this is the beginning brother when brother when brother Brandon was rejected by the denomination they always say you can see it on YouTube that was the end of William Brandon's Ministry we say that was the beginning of our time because it changed now to become just a denominational preacher to become a bridegroom to become an Eleazar can you say Amen you remember that brother Graham speaks about about ashamed and and God says to him you are ratting on the job 1965. you're ratting on the job and brother babe thinks what is the problem that I'm writing on the job and later he preaches the pre the sermon trying to do God a servant without being in the will of God I think the service before service later and brother Benham showed something when he started that church that service he said I preach it as a correction for the church in fact he was correcting himself because when brother Branham came to South Africa in 1965 he tried to make a big meeting with the first and the second pool like they had 30 years ago but the time of the shout was over the time of just Gathering the people and Jesus Is A Healer and Jesus death was over that is now bright age and God says to him stop to be just popular you're writing on the job now you have a message for a bride rejected by the majority but loved by the brides brother babe said all hell is against that Revelation but the bride stands on it [Laughter] can you see there is a development in the message of the hour it's not God's and the prophets amend as I said yesterday I'm hurrying through I said here is now let me please say Amen you love the Lord man he is Believers I don't know how it is but he seems to be real real real Believers of that I don't need any notes just to but I have to just keep the time but good I normally very distant I'm a German that discipline no but do you see we have here uh uh we have here elieza and that was God revealed to him your ministry is elieza not only what we heard before and when elieza arrived to find a bride for Isaac there was a supernatural element because the angel of the Lord went with him and brother Ben said the angel of the Lord was half an hour faster that is the reason why you should come half an hour earlier to church I was preaching this in Zimbabwe I said look the almighty God can do great things before the songs leader starts his first song and I was preaching and a sister got her sights the next service that I got my side back before the song service starts I said he's not a preacher with holy hands it's you touching God brother the service is not that the minister said okay let's let's start the service service starts when you enter here in brother and then you you do like we did with our family I took my little girl and my wife every time we went to the alt we were praying together Heavenly Father touch my little girl speak to her and know in the past and I'm the preacher God bless you for this day and we went to our seat like brother Brandon said you don't have to do it that way but somehow so the supernatural element here is elieza and he thinks in his heart if I will tell a girl or if I will tell that girl give me to drink and she would say I give you to drink and the camels then it's her okay so here comes Now That Girl Rebecca and here's elieza and look the Supernatural part he tells her the first part of his plan give me to drink and the rest of that plan give my camel spring is in his heart he never mentions it is in his heart amen but he said if she says I will give you to drink and the chemist I know that is exactly the inspiration that I had super this message is Supernatural if you were called that was the same Holy Spirit working through 2000 years the thing that you see is the grace of God don't don't I mean exactly so she said I will give you to drink that is nice Social Gospel people are nice I give you something sweet and he can say Eliza [Music] and then she says and I give the camel to drink he said that's her because she came in the channel of my own inspiration that must be the girl and he comes down into the house of Labor into a denominational Church you see and when Laban when elieza came you know he had gifts for everyone I mean everybody got a little bit gold a little bit money a little bit silver I'm a mama God Papa grandfather everybody got some gifts and everybody's happy that Eleazar was there but when it comes to Rebecca Rebecca was not interested in the gifts and the gold Rebecca wanted to have the bridegroom can you say Amen do you understand when brother Branham came to denominations they were happy about the gifts another healing another great but the bride is not interested in those things the bride wants to have the bridegroom oh man she wants to have elieza gifts or no gifts I want to have the person he said amen and then they were on their camels I mean and Rebecca asked can you tell something about about elieza about Isaac I said yes I can tell you something Christ is the mystery of God reveals I will preach two hours about that I mean who is this Melchizedek oh wow is that exactly so yeah yeah and you were in him before exactly is that so yeah the identified Christ of all time is that exactly so and in the evening time amen when they were meeting the Bible says he brought her in the tent of her mother another time tent vision amen like we were preaching yesterday okay can you say Amen so this message the Diamond the message into the Promised lands and never stop on your spiritual journey until you arrive there the new birth is the beginning of that whole thing but not the ends from now on you are now eating and you'll be coming and can you say Amen make the next one amen I'm skipping through next one next one next one because it's been too long okay I mean give me give me just a couple of minutes then I'm finishing up can you say Amen so far [Applause] what a Time here's brother REM and he leaves the last service that brother Brandon preaches is in a synagogue I'm a temple Emmanuel and he gives that message back to the Jews Hallelujah somebody said brother Marcus we have a little bit problem of Israel and Israel I tell you one thing if Christ is the king of the Jews then the bride is the queen of the Jews you cannot be Lutheran about that if Christ is the king of the Jews the bride is the queen of the Jews it's your country amen blessed be the name of the Lord keep the message honorable leave the right kind of life don't let those not come upon it we're living too late now we're too late in the hour let's leave it clean all my life your life all of our life needs to be picked up before God our young people just ride around from place to place from show to show drifting further further away from God right now that's the truth I see that in my children I see myself getting to a place you got to assemble yourself to worship God the Bible said so when you see this day approaching that much more come together if there is only two people here you'll be one of them if we come together and worship together then just something about say Jesus said where two or three are together in my name they are there I am in their midst look here is the parallel to Joshua Joshua says goodbye my time on Earth is up I did my best goodbye we see us at another another dimension but the brand makes the same it's a goodbye church I have to leave soon but hold up the fort come together I mean keep keep a vision don't don't don't maybe maybe we were speaking in our next Services about about suicide about spiritual suicide that people commit amen he said don't don't just stay home amen a person says hey man come to church I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I I I prefer to stream you see and that stream is it's much better you know I'm sitting down and said okay who's that Marcus back okay honey bring me some coffee yeah amen amen that's good I'm and brother Brian said you must bring a sacrifice so that God can bless you and say Amen I know that I'm hurting our feelings but I'm I'm a visiting Minister that's a great thing it will never help you to become fan of some U.S preacher it never helped never and it will never do in the future you must find your position with Christ I mean you must pray that until God speaks to you our German preacher but look at this we finish by this who is older than 50. like me oh quite some time brother Adrian 2 I thought it's 45 I mean do do we hey we older ones do we realize that we soon have to go soon we go it's not much time anymore amen amen 10 years 15 years nothing it's like this last time I was here five years or something like this like this time is just running and I think as a minister I think as a father I said what kind of inheritance do I give to my children because I have only one chance on Earth for only one chance amen we want to inherit you our children uh a car a house I sent them to University every Muslim can do that that's that's just social that's fine every Muslim can send them to University but we have something to give we have something to give um we have a message not in form but we can say son you can do whatever you want but I mean if you want to do something good in your life you serve the same God because he made me so happy and it's such an honor such a privilege to serve the Lord what do we give to the Next Generation just a quote book just a picture of brother Branham just a okay a handwritten Bible or whatever no we must give them a vision for their life as for me and my house we serve the Lord by by by Joy the Bible says the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being a hundred and ten years old and they buried him on the border of the inheritance of Team not heiress and the Mount of Ephraim on the north side of hilgash and also all the generation were gathered unto their fathers in their arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he done for Israel I want to ask you a question and you put on your spiritual jacket that generation that rose up again they were born in the promised land they were never in Egypt they were never in the wilderness they were born in the Promised Land and when when Joshua he was baptized or circumcised in the Young Generation what did he do I would remove the shame of Egypt from you but they were never in Egypt they were born in the wilderness but how could you remove the shame of Egypt from a Young Generation it was an older generation bringing their Egypt complexes upon them rather all things that we in our life never put under our shoes our children have the privilege to Bear them plus their own complexes I took care of peace sometime I'm already in my accounts in the third generation I can see promise that grandfather has father has you see traits in the family very very clear you have a problem you have a heart attack you have a problem for example with a stroke the first thing that that the doctor asked you do you have that in your family because he knows one thing sicknesses I have have a family tradition the natural types the spiritual stop boring this you can see it from one generation the next one but brother we have enough Holy Spirit to to to stop to to stop that Circle to break that Circle we have now enough material spiritual material not to stay the same but you say I'm inherited that way I come from Egypt and I have my marks and I have this but I will not bring this to the Next Generation can you say Amen help us help me help me help you honest I mean I will come I don't go to church because do you know that you take your children into a disaster amen so what happens is this the the new generation they were raised up in the promised land let me say like this they were raised in the message for their day they were never under false worship they knew the doctrine they knew the Torah because it was the the oral Torah that they had at that time the Torah was finished when Moses died they had Sunday schools they had Services they had synagogues weren't invented at that time but they came together they had all kinds of material but they didn't know God are you sure that our children know God you see oh they must see a miracle that's not the question you see do they know the love of God do they know the nature of God do we understand one thing that we live in a time like never ever before we tried everything to to educate our youngsters we tried Pentecostalism it never worked we tried legalism and never worked amen we tried Reformation it never worked it served its time but the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels the mystery of God shall be revealed and brother Brandon preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed Schofield had Mysteries but the mystery means the heart of God how he is a father how he takes care how he loves his children how he how he deals with certain situations do we have another picture of God that we ever had in 2000 years that's what the opening of the seals brought so we have sometime a generation they know the dates of their message but they never knew God I mean they have a religion so the Bible says and they forsook the Lord God of their father which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods amen so as long as Joshua there and the elders were there whole Israel was serving the lord that's what the Bible says and it was not that Joshua went and where is the television here bring the television no no it doesn't work by legalism but if you serve the Lord God will bless your whole family with it there is an anointing that goes over your whole family the Bible says all Israel were blessed because of David what about you what about me do we understand that if we serve the Lord God blesses the whole family with it there's no time of feeling always he said this and he hurt my feelings and if I'm always hurting my feelings I have to say Lord change me because I cannot continue like this amen so so we as parents we have such a possibility to transmit a vision amen not just to say come to church so that the children but that the children might say one day if I'm older I want to become like my daddy I mean that is our goal I want to become like my mother because I don't understand that Branham Doctrine but I understand they are great people the way they treated me the way they treated us I I can see my parents are completely different in any kind of unbeliever because we have the Holy Spirit in US do you understand a vision of God is a feeling for the people blessed be the name we say they have to know God we must be stricter we must have more love and by love it brings that strictness but by the Holy Spirit can you say Amen so so this scripture speaks about our time because there was never a time in Israel when a generation was born in the Promised Land um it speaks about a new generation which is called in the message they know the message they know the church they know Youth Camp they know Family Camp they know but they don't know God I mean do you see the challenge that we have to really bring them into a into the presence of God Amen can you say Amen shall we say it for the next days to say if we enter in 2023 Lord let me take my family and let us meet in the evening I mean and let us take our arms around us and say let's pray for one another I took my my family at the end of the year and I said yeah thank you so much my wife my daughter I said you're part of my Ministry the way you behave Everybody is watching you everybody's observing you amen I thank you very much God bless you I've surely see this I surely appreciate this we should say these things someday you have a Ministry I take care of people and God made me that way I'm not I'm not opening my I'm not hurting my feeding not at all but it's easier to tell us here than to tell somebody else amen because you're not my my sheep or whatever you call it brother I take care of 50 people amen call them and I will give some testimony of how they came out of alcoholism or whatever I've called him all the time I said how are you doing I'm it's amazing fine can I do something you can just can I pray for you hey you did a good job God bless you fine I'm for many many people but nobody gives a feedback to me none of those asked brother Marcus how are you doing can I do something for you do we do this with our pastor or is everything for granted that's his job it's not his job we are all human beings and and somebody could say Hey brother Marcus that's a good job that you do thank you very much I appreciate this brother we take we lost in this message we lost a lot of goods attitudes amen we have a good Doctrine we're the best of the world but something is sometimes missing that that that intimacy that dear respect to one another that hey Pastor I mean the year is at the end but I want to tell you one thing I surely appreciate what you did for me amen whenever I had a problem I could call you I never forget this and if I could help you I will do these things rather God will bless us more than we think blessing is not a question of Doctrine blessing is a question of attitude and by this God starts to bless your whole family quote brother Branham if you take care of other people's problems God takes care of your problems I prefer that God takes care of my problems than I take care of do you understand this we have a lot of young people of Finnish bodies if you say can you say amen I share these things with you because I cannot share it at home and pastors that I cannot share it here because they say okay now he wants that somebody nobody wants us to clap on the shoulder no but something genuine a look in the eyes hey can I do something for you can I do something life easier for you you were always there for me but I want to tell you one thing we really pray for you that is like oil in the engine of a person when everybody needs it from time to time that little feeling of hey somebody cares for me can you say Amen you can't say Amen amen your own daughter my own daughter came to me he said Daddy hey if you need me I I will always be I was happy to serve you that means so much for me was was that kind of a little compliment but brother you run 100 miles more with one little word we're running we're doing amen with joy amen and then you go to your own children I said hey the way you dress the way you come to church like I don't know if you're born again I don't know if you're baptized but I surely appreciate that you're trying to serve the Lord that way it's do we say to our youngsters do you understand that every woman needs compliments not that son amen but every woman likes to have some compliments and you're looking good but who will give you a compliment no boyfriend no nothing I mean you're not not married no one day your husband will give you some compliments but until your husband gives you the company who gives you the company your own Daddy said honey hey I want to tell you one thing you're looking good I'm very proud of you we have to say these things you say this is just social it's just psychology it's not like that is what God does with us and we come to church and he's just speaking some things to us and we go back home he said what a father we have amen as for me in my house we want to serve the Lord okay so amen finish by death reaping priests I tell you one thing every young person that leaves the church I keep in contact with them it's quite a number I got examples of people in drugs in alcohol I keep always contact with them by WhatsApp it's a truth I tell you one thing I'm writing how are you doing in person brother Marcus I wasn't in church on Sunday I said look I'm an older brother I understand I'm over 50. but I'm not too old to understand who's in church or not okay I said that wasn't my question but the young people think if a pastor asks how you're doing the only questions where were you in school in the church you see that complex that we have already that that traumatism that we have already in that message that we lost some time a normal feeling to one another everything is you have to function in the church if you're not functioning anymore you're forgotten it's not our gospel amen so I write hey uh I want to ask her how are you doing brother Marcus I'm coming back next Sunday I said that wasn't my question because you're lying anyhow you're not there because if you want to come you come you don't say that you come I said I want to say you how are you doing how do you feel can I do something for you because I don't come to church look we have brothers and sisters we are friends we are dedicated here you are not losing our friendship in our Brotherhood because you don't come to church anymore because we are Eternal beings I don't agree with your life son you know this but I agree with your heart rather than by that thing these people come back sooner or later they try to find something where they're like a dove they try to find something but sooner or later they found there's nothing in the world and if you keep that door open they come back and say hey here we are brother I see them one by one coming back I say praise the Lords and say Amen that is how God deals with us amen amen and you say Amen the same thing that I was preaching that gospel that we preach is so different than the rest it's God bringing us home it's it's here comes Abraham to Sarah really finishing give me two minutes I mean here's Abraham coming to Sarah same principle that we saw over there and Sarah was in the tent behind him 10th Vision again always always the same picture and Abraham says where is Sarah the Bible says they asked where is Sarah your wife because Abraham knew one thing here comes the one who told me 25 years ago that you have so much children and be father of a Nation give me a second and whatever he was so embarrassed he says I hope he will not ask where are my children because there is none so foreign goddess in humor and the angels said hey I mean isn't he the father of many nations one said to the other yeah yeah he must have oh Abraham it's tremendous your children must be so quiet we don't hear them they must be all in Sunday it's good tremendous man and Abraham [Music] well I mean it's difficult to explain right now but and then God says I'm in Wisteria wife according to the time of life you will have a child same picture that I was preaching before Sarah was laughing in her heart what did Sarah do she thought about herself he said I will not make it amen and God does not discuss with Sarah God speaks about himself he said is there anything too hard for the Lord you see the picture Sarah says I'm too old I cannot make the Rapture I will never do it with my complexes in the church and I have a pastor with this past I will never make the Rapture God says is there anything too hard for the Lord God is not there and discussing with her he speaks about himself you understand get your mighty man of God oh yeah I mean I'm in a church where there's no Miracles and it's always boring I'm sleeping in the church I'm these and this and this amen God's not discussing with him he says I'm gonna go in the strength that I gave you do you understand our Fortress is God's he will bring us through can you say Amen what a time this message brought heart and soul to the Bible therefore we have an emotional messenger because it's a bright age we don't have a Martin Luther you won't have a problem this messenger and poured out his heart because this message is heart and soul of God bringing feelings back to the Bible bringing even we can here's brother Ram he talks about his own complexes and knowing Gods will help about in that thing we always pretend of you know how are you doing with the Lord's tremendous and God knows no it's only a put up it's just a show that we do we'll learn to be such in a show because we don't want to show our weaknesses but we have a father he said hey tell me how it is we pray we say heavenly father you know that and you know what's happening God says I know say what's on your heart I'm your father I help you I'm not your director I'm your father can you say Amen this message changed the whole Bible amen legalism never works nothing worked but I mean he came down himself amen if the machine would come if you don't come and continue do you love the Lord you love the Lord amen amen I mean what a father we have I hope I'm not over time if if yes please forgive me but man that is a good atmosphere here to preach you must be really if I'm leaving right now for the service for this afternoon please don't take it as an arrogance but this evening I have more time and tomorrow maybe do you know the song I have a father Yes I was sung yesterday and therefore okay let let me really finish by this and I as I said I have no notes just maybe one one sentence was just for you then you take that sentence from the presence of God because of just opening my heart I mean no one thing when when when when how it's so important to give a vision to our children the vision of God's love they will not understand the seven sea but they understand us amen but you understand when when when Peter came into I think was Peter came into the presence of Jesus and Jesus said Simon son of Jonah so Jesus knew who he was and he was to know who his father was and brother Branham explained why it was the important son of Jonah he says because the father was sitting with his boys in the ship and they were talking about spiritual things about a vision they were not talking about Mercedes-Benz they talk about spiritual vision you know when brother Brahm says this and the father stood up he said boys I'm too old and soon have to go and the Messiah is coming soon but be sure the Messiah will be a prophet that's what brother Ram says over and over and Peter remembered what his own father told you I want to ask you a question do we talk with our children about the rapture or do we say this up to the sun is Gucci that's ours it's our job to do to talk with our youngsters say hey we have a little bit some rules in our home because we have a heavenly father okay we are more than just Branham Branham Church We are family of God Amen you're proud of that amen who told Peter his own father do we have time for a family all or are we too busy nothing is more important than our children because we are the ones we are the intercessors bringing them home amen shall we do it next year better than this year is that fine for you shall we say heavenly father I have just a couple of years but let me use them for your glory for your honor amazing God bless you richly what a father we have [Music] and here's me well I call I have a maker he found my life foreign [Applause] he knows my everything thank you Jesus
