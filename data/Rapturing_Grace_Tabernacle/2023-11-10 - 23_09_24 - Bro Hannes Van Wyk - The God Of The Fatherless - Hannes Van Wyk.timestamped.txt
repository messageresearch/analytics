[1:16:22] you will take control of this meeting
[1:16:23] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[1:16:27] amen God bless you you may take your
[1:16:29] seats
[1:16:30] this morning certainly wonderful to be
[1:16:33] here and this place is is always
[1:16:38] surprising to me the weather here is uh
[1:16:40] I don't know how to describe it but yeah
[1:16:44] you know it's uh it's cold and it's wet
[1:16:47] and it's on but we thank the Lord that
[1:16:49] we can come into a place that's warm and
[1:16:51] a nice atmosphere and we can just relax
[1:16:53] and say Lord give us Grace and help us
[1:16:57] this morning
[1:16:58] so the Bible is clear that you know and
[1:17:01] my title this morning I would say the
[1:17:03] god of the fatherless and the name of
[1:17:04] the Lord is a tower
[1:17:07] and the righteous run into it and they
[1:17:09] are safe
[1:17:09] because God comes and when every time
[1:17:11] when God comes to us he he comes into an
[1:17:13] expression
[1:17:15] when God comes and he starts to deal
[1:17:16] with these people and he talks to them
[1:17:18] you know he's got a very peculiar way to
[1:17:20] do things
[1:17:21] because he is God and he understands us
[1:17:23] he has created us and he knows what is
[1:17:27] our deepest needs sometimes we don't
[1:17:28] know our own needs you know you might
[1:17:31] think I have a need of this this year
[1:17:32] but in fact when God starts to deal with
[1:17:34] you you realize I've got the total wrong
[1:17:36] perspective the wrong conception of what
[1:17:39] I really did need because God knows
[1:17:41] better and when he gave me then at the
[1:17:43] end of the day I turn back and I say
[1:17:44] Lord thank you for not giving me what I
[1:17:46] thought I needed but you gave me what
[1:17:49] you knew I needed from the before the
[1:17:51] foundation of the world
[1:17:52] now you know let's go to Genesis 21 from
[1:17:56] verse 1 and
[1:17:58] here is a family of God Abram and Sarah
[1:18:01] and they are they are dwelling and they
[1:18:03] are doing the things of the Lord and you
[1:18:05] know God has blessed them and called
[1:18:06] them and many different things happen
[1:18:08] but at some point in time in their
[1:18:10] family life you know trouble sets in no
[1:18:13] family is excluded from trouble no
[1:18:16] family can say we never have any trouble
[1:18:18] because that's the path of life God
[1:18:22] allow things to happen to us for a very
[1:18:24] very specific reason there is nothing
[1:18:27] that happens to you that God has not
[1:18:29] engineered or allowed or some way then
[1:18:31] there must come some good out of it
[1:18:33] because you know if your life was just
[1:18:35] stagnant
[1:18:36] nothing happening you know it's so
[1:18:38] perfect in every way you know you're
[1:18:41] like in a glass house the temperature is
[1:18:43] perfect the conditions are always
[1:18:45] perfect you know you become a hot house
[1:18:47] plant and the moment that the door opens
[1:18:50] and the cold breeze coming you're gone
[1:18:52] but God is not in the business to create
[1:18:54] hot house plants he's in the business to
[1:18:57] create character people after his own
[1:18:59] character that can face any storm any
[1:19:02] trial any situation not by their own
[1:19:04] ability but being exposed and being
[1:19:06] grown over time gently you know allowing
[1:19:10] small things here and small things here
[1:19:11] because you know we grow when you came
[1:19:15] into the message when God saved your
[1:19:17] heart your soul and you become a child
[1:19:19] of the Living God you know you can
[1:19:21] remember how God and then starts to deal
[1:19:24] with you
[1:19:24] somebody will come and and somebody will
[1:19:27] say something against you
[1:19:29] and you will cry you you you will cry
[1:19:32] the whole week
[1:19:33] because somebody has said something
[1:19:35] against you but after some time when you
[1:19:38] when you've grown in maturity has taken
[1:19:40] hold of you then somebody says something
[1:19:42] about you you know your attitude changes
[1:19:44] you don't go home and cry anymore you
[1:19:47] actually have a different approach to
[1:19:48] life now because God has now taught you
[1:19:51] that everything around you there's a
[1:19:53] purpose there's a reason and there's a
[1:19:55] season behind everything so now your
[1:19:57] approach changes from being a child you
[1:20:00] become mature in the word and now you
[1:20:02] look at that and you say Lord thank you
[1:20:04] for allowing things to happen in my life
[1:20:06] because now I can take that as an
[1:20:08] opportunity and I can grow and I can
[1:20:09] become more mature that's what God wants
[1:20:12] from every one of us to look at life in
[1:20:14] that perspective to say you know what
[1:20:15] this is not a problem this is an
[1:20:17] opportunity this is not a something that
[1:20:20] is going to push me down this is an
[1:20:22] opportunity for me to see who I really
[1:20:24] am and to grow even further every step
[1:20:27] of this way because we will never stop
[1:20:29] growing until the Rapture comes
[1:20:31] doesn't matter how long you've served
[1:20:33] the Lord you're still growing because
[1:20:35] you you need Perfection and that
[1:20:37] Perfection comes over time and he says
[1:20:39] the day the bride know who she is he's
[1:20:40] go home because that Perfection has
[1:20:42] taken a hold of her that nothing can
[1:20:43] hold her back but as long as you're here
[1:20:46] I've been in the serving the lord for 30
[1:20:48] years and I still learn
[1:20:50] every day of my life
[1:20:52] the moment you think I know everything
[1:20:54] that's the day you start to learn again
[1:20:56] because God then opens another door and
[1:20:58] you realize Lord I've been foolish no
[1:21:00] Lord let me start over Lord let me just
[1:21:02] just just just be humble before you Lord
[1:21:04] and learn me Lord teach me thy way so
[1:21:06] father God so that I can find peace
[1:21:10] and the Lord visited Sarah and she had
[1:21:12] as he had said and the Lord did unto
[1:21:14] Sarah as he had spoken so when the Lord
[1:21:17] speaks something he will do it
[1:21:19] amen when he promised doesn't make time
[1:21:22] is no factor with the Lord with us we
[1:21:24] pray and we expected the the the the
[1:21:26] undertaking immediately but the Lord is
[1:21:29] not like that with him there's no time
[1:21:30] there is a season and appointed season
[1:21:33] where he delivers his promises
[1:21:35] for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham his
[1:21:38] son in his old age and at the set time
[1:21:41] of which God had spoken to him
[1:21:43] so there's a time there's a season and
[1:21:45] God delivers exactly on time and Abram
[1:21:48] called the name of his son that was born
[1:21:50] unto him whom Sarah bore to him Isaac
[1:21:52] and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac
[1:21:55] being eight days old and God had
[1:21:57] commanded him and Abram was 100 years
[1:21:59] old when his son Isaac was born unto him
[1:22:02] and Sarah said God have made me to love
[1:22:05] so that all that here will love with me
[1:22:08] and she said who would have said unto
[1:22:11] Abram that Sarah should have given
[1:22:12] children suck for I have borne him a son
[1:22:14] in his old age and the child grew and
[1:22:17] was weaned and Abram made a great feast
[1:22:19] the same day that Isaac was weaned and
[1:22:22] Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian
[1:22:24] which he had borne unto Abram mocking
[1:22:28] now here's a feast
[1:22:30] Abram is now there his son is being
[1:22:32] weaned and there's a dedication there's
[1:22:34] a wonderful wonderful celebration and as
[1:22:37] these things happen all of a sudden
[1:22:40] Ishmael start to look at Isaac and he
[1:22:43] starts to mock him and Sarah sees the
[1:22:46] very fact that this child is now acting
[1:22:48] differently mocking him wherefore she
[1:22:52] said unto Abram cast out this Bond woman
[1:22:55] and a son for the son of this Bond when
[1:22:58] moon shall not be a with my son even
[1:23:00] with Isaac
[1:23:01] now here is the first problem that steps
[1:23:04] into the family because now they are
[1:23:07] celebrating everybody is happy and all
[1:23:09] of a sudden you know Sarah steps on the
[1:23:11] scene and said to Abram she must go with
[1:23:14] the child because Sarah is now discerned
[1:23:17] has looked at something she saw
[1:23:18] something here which Abram didn't see
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:24] Abram didn't see it as you see the
[1:23:27] scripture tells us so what did she see
[1:23:30] she saw him mocking her son
[1:23:33] she saw ishmael's attitude
[1:23:35] and what was he mocking him about
[1:23:38] the Bible doesn't say it but the next
[1:23:40] verse explains it explicitly because of
[1:23:42] the inheritance
[1:23:44] Ishmael said to Isaac I am the firstborn
[1:23:49] you're gonna inherit nothing
[1:23:51] I'll take control you are nothing so
[1:23:53] that that mocking continue that way and
[1:23:55] Sarah heard that verse 11 and the thing
[1:23:58] was very Grievous in Abram's side
[1:24:01] because of his son
[1:24:03] Abram didn't just believe it or just
[1:24:05] accept it Abram was there and the Bible
[1:24:07] says it became a grievous thing unto him
[1:24:11] that he his wife now telling him that
[1:24:13] you know the bonds woman and his son
[1:24:16] must go
[1:24:17] Grievous so it isn't something that he
[1:24:20] said no you know what let me embrace it
[1:24:21] let me just accept it you know this
[1:24:23] makes change to me but he says it was
[1:24:26] Grievous unto him up to the point where
[1:24:28] he decided I'm not going to do it
[1:24:31] that's what he did
[1:24:33] why because now God has to come from
[1:24:35] heaven
[1:24:36] and start to address the matter
[1:24:39] the next verse and God said unto Abram
[1:24:41] let it not be Grievous in thy sight
[1:24:44] because of the lad and because of thy
[1:24:47] Bond women in all that Sarah have said
[1:24:49] unto thee hearken unto her voice for in
[1:24:52] Isaac shall I see it be quote amen so
[1:24:55] God comes in he confirms he says he
[1:24:57] doesn't repeat What Sarah Said
[1:25:00] because many times we we as Believers
[1:25:03] look at the situation if God can just
[1:25:05] tell me to himself then I'll do it
[1:25:07] God has got many ways to speak to you
[1:25:09] and because we've got a preconceived
[1:25:11] idea if God doesn't do it this way I
[1:25:14] cannot believe it then we miss what God
[1:25:16] is trying to tell us and here God uses
[1:25:19] his wife to tell him many times we as
[1:25:21] brothers your wife is Anointed by God
[1:25:24] she tells you something that if God
[1:25:26] tells me I'll believe it
[1:25:27] but we have to learn and understand you
[1:25:29] know what each one of us has got the
[1:25:31] Holy Ghost and each one of us has got a
[1:25:33] role to play and God we are children of
[1:25:35] the Living God we are all saved by the
[1:25:38] same Grace and we all carry gifts
[1:25:41] it's not only brothers that carry gifts
[1:25:43] this this carries the same gifts the
[1:25:45] only thing they cannot do they cannot
[1:25:46] come and stand here and preach and take
[1:25:48] authority
[1:25:49] because that's when the fall came that
[1:25:51] situation changed completely and the man
[1:25:53] is giving that Authority and the man is
[1:25:55] then the ruler is the king the priest
[1:25:58] and he does all those wonderful
[1:26:00] wonderful things that God has given us
[1:26:02] to do but be happy beyond that we all
[1:26:05] carry wonderful anointed gifts
[1:26:08] sometimes your wife can do better with
[1:26:10] finances than you
[1:26:16] brother you are very quiet but don't
[1:26:18] worry
[1:26:19] we'll push through I can preach without
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:25] so
[1:26:26] what should we do you know we we look at
[1:26:28] these things and we underestimate
[1:26:30] because if God then tells me if yeah yes
[1:26:32] honey I hear you but if God can just
[1:26:34] confirm it
[1:26:35] you must be so sensitive so full of the
[1:26:37] Holy Spirit to realize that we are a
[1:26:39] team we are both saved by the grace of
[1:26:40] God and he if there's a gift let's
[1:26:43] harness the gift let's use the gift
[1:26:44] let's let's stand together because God
[1:26:47] has put us has placed us together the
[1:26:50] church together the bride together if I
[1:26:52] look at the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[1:26:54] stand here this morning and you ask me
[1:26:56] how do I see God
[1:26:59] if I ask you how do you see God
[1:27:01] do you see God with a big stick do you
[1:27:04] see somebody that's going to punish me
[1:27:05] do you see somebody that's going to send
[1:27:06] me to hell if I don't serve him or how
[1:27:09] do you experience this this Lord this
[1:27:11] this God that has saved us and that's
[1:27:13] where the problem lies many people has
[1:27:15] been taught the wrong way to perceive
[1:27:17] this God and to look at him in a real
[1:27:18] way when I look at God I only I only
[1:27:21] experience one thing love
[1:27:23] he has never not loved me
[1:27:26] I have never one day in the last 30
[1:27:29] years not felt loved
[1:27:31] not one day
[1:27:34] he has loved me unconditionally he has
[1:27:36] loved me so much that I stand and I say
[1:27:38] Lord I don't even deserve it I don't
[1:27:40] know why but Lord you love me because
[1:27:42] God has an appointed time he said time
[1:27:45] and a season for every one of you
[1:27:48] and we try and push the agenda we try
[1:27:50] and push the times and dates and seasons
[1:27:52] and this you cannot push a time and date
[1:27:55] with God he will not come earlier when I
[1:27:57] came into the message 30 years back I
[1:28:00] thought thank you Lord for weight from
[1:28:01] waiting for me
[1:28:03] let the Rapture go
[1:28:05] I said to sister who's a man we just
[1:28:07] made it I can feel the door slamming
[1:28:10] behind us
[1:28:11] because we were taught from the day we
[1:28:14] came in the Rapture is upon us which is
[1:28:15] true
[1:28:17] we were expecting the Rapture that very
[1:28:19] next week
[1:28:20] because I was convinced God just waited
[1:28:22] for me but 30 years later many came
[1:28:24] after me
[1:28:26] so God is still waiting for somebody to
[1:28:28] come and we should be gracious and
[1:28:30] patient to say Lord let the last one
[1:28:31] come Lord if I should if it should be
[1:28:33] another 100 years so be it
[1:28:36] but it can be today or tomorrow you
[1:28:38] should live as if it's today or tomorrow
[1:28:40] you should plant your potatoes as if
[1:28:42] he's coming now today but still keep on
[1:28:45] planting your potatoes and that's where
[1:28:46] the vision of a true Christian comes
[1:28:49] real in our lives when we become real
[1:28:51] where you realize I need to live a life
[1:28:53] and I need to be dedicated and I need to
[1:28:55] make a difference wherever God has
[1:28:57] placed me let me make a difference there
[1:29:00] because that's the principle now
[1:29:02] remember God has got a time and a season
[1:29:04] when we were growing up my father
[1:29:07] was a man of very intellectual man
[1:29:11] so he started to search the Bible he
[1:29:14] started to look at things and he was
[1:29:15] hunting the truth
[1:29:17] and he looked for the truth
[1:29:19] and we were children in the house uh
[1:29:22] four three two brothers and one sister
[1:29:25] were four siblings and we walk with them
[1:29:27] and we went to the church with them
[1:29:29] because we were young children and he
[1:29:31] went to every church he could find
[1:29:33] everyone
[1:29:35] and he hunted and he was sincere he was
[1:29:39] so sincere and he was looking at it and
[1:29:41] he ended up one day we ended up walking
[1:29:43] into a message Church
[1:29:47] we sat there in the pews the pastor
[1:29:49] preached we saw the pictures
[1:29:51] and the things and you know the books
[1:29:54] and the ego and all the things and we
[1:29:57] walked out he took some books home
[1:29:58] started to read it and his conclusion at
[1:30:00] the end of the week was this is not the
[1:30:02] truth
[1:30:04] files it
[1:30:05] finish and we carry on and we end up at
[1:30:08] home he says there's no truth out there
[1:30:09] now we stay at home
[1:30:12] and we were six seven years old and many
[1:30:14] years later 22 23 years old guess what
[1:30:18] the same God comes back again
[1:30:21] and he brings us all four children back
[1:30:24] into the word again and he saves our
[1:30:26] lives and he the time and season for him
[1:30:28] to be there he never accepted the
[1:30:30] message
[1:30:31] but they were four little children
[1:30:33] inside there with feet inside of them
[1:30:35] but the time and season was not right
[1:30:37] there and we forgot about it we didn't
[1:30:39] even knew but later on we've got the
[1:30:42] whole story and then you realize when
[1:30:44] the seat of God inside of you you can
[1:30:47] never go lost God cannot lose you he
[1:30:50] will find you at the right time and the
[1:30:52] right spot he will Quicken that seat and
[1:30:54] it comes to life
[1:30:55] and then it's forever it's permanent
[1:30:57] nobody can take you out of it because
[1:30:59] nobody placed you into it too many
[1:31:01] people in the message are spoken into it
[1:31:03] convinced that it's the truth you need a
[1:31:06] revelation that this is a Godly truth
[1:31:08] and nobody will take you from it you
[1:31:10] will never leave it nor forsake it
[1:31:12] because it's a revelation
[1:31:15] now in verse 13.
[1:31:18] and also the son of the bones woman will
[1:31:19] I make a nation because he is thy seed
[1:31:22] so before in Isaac that she shall be
[1:31:24] called and I will make him god-giving
[1:31:26] Abram the reason why he must put him out
[1:31:29] that is your seat I'll bless him because
[1:31:32] of that fact that he's a natural seed
[1:31:34] he's not that spiritual promise seed and
[1:31:37] Abram rose up early in the morning and
[1:31:39] took bread and a bottle of water and
[1:31:41] gave it unto heger putting it on her
[1:31:43] shoulder and the child sent her away and
[1:31:45] she departed and wandered in the
[1:31:47] wilderness of Beersheba and the water
[1:31:49] was spent in the border and she cast the
[1:31:51] child under one of the shrubs
[1:31:53] and she went and sat her down over
[1:31:55] against him a good way off as it were a
[1:31:57] bow shot for she said let me not see the
[1:31:59] death of the child amen I don't want to
[1:32:02] see that let me not see the death of the
[1:32:04] child because and and she sat over
[1:32:06] against him and lift up her voice and
[1:32:07] wept and God heard the voice of the lad
[1:32:10] and the angel of God called
[1:32:12] to Hagar Out of Heaven
[1:32:15] and said unto her what ail of the heger
[1:32:17] fear not for God I've heard the voice of
[1:32:19] the lad where he is now the power of a
[1:32:22] natural seed
[1:32:24] yes yes Abram there's a natural seed
[1:32:26] he's in trouble he's busy dying and God
[1:32:29] hears the Cry of the lad because there's
[1:32:32] a natural seed of Abram God is
[1:32:34] interested
[1:32:35] now what how much more the spiritual
[1:32:38] seat the Royal Sea those that are born
[1:32:40] in Jesus Christ God is so interested in
[1:32:43] your life that it doesn't matter what
[1:32:45] happens he is fully aware every moment
[1:32:48] every second of your life he is fully
[1:32:51] aware and it speaks to him daily His
[1:32:53] Eyes Are Fixed upon you
[1:32:55] he says arrived lifts up the lad and
[1:32:57] hold him in thine hand for I will make
[1:32:58] him a great nation
[1:33:00] and God opened her eyes
[1:33:03] and she saw a well of water
[1:33:05] now where was the world the world was
[1:33:07] forever there
[1:33:08] God understand I created the will
[1:33:11] God didn't say that he says and God
[1:33:14] opened her eyes
[1:33:16] and she saw the well
[1:33:18] that's why the Bible says with every
[1:33:21] trial and every Temptation God Supply a
[1:33:24] way of Escape
[1:33:25] everyone believes the problem is that we
[1:33:27] don't see it because we don't pray the
[1:33:29] right way to say Lord I'm in this
[1:33:31] situation Lord there is a way of escape
[1:33:34] a right way out of it open my eyes that
[1:33:36] I might find it Lord that I might see
[1:33:38] the right way father because your word
[1:33:41] can never lie your word can never never
[1:33:44] fail Lord let me find that way
[1:33:48] and God opened her eyes and she saw a
[1:33:50] well of water
[1:33:51] and she went and filled the bottle with
[1:33:53] the water and gave the lead drink
[1:33:55] so we as humans has got a problem in in
[1:33:58] that sense that when you see the outcome
[1:34:00] of the Lord you want the Lord also to
[1:34:02] bring the outcome to to supply to to
[1:34:04] take you
[1:34:06] the Bible didn't say and the angel went
[1:34:08] and filled the bottle and the angel went
[1:34:10] and took it and gave it to the lad and
[1:34:11] the angel did this and this God showed
[1:34:13] her the water and he says no go
[1:34:16] and fill up
[1:34:18] and take that water and give it to the
[1:34:21] child
[1:34:23] God will give you the solution but you
[1:34:25] must stand up by faith
[1:34:27] and act upon that conviction and say
[1:34:29] Lord I'm taking this Step By Faith Lord
[1:34:31] I'm moving forward Lord help me Lord to
[1:34:33] be able to act upon what I believe is
[1:34:36] your will for my life let me live and
[1:34:38] let me walk and let me be an example
[1:34:40] Lord and God was with the lad and he
[1:34:43] grew and dwelled in the Wilders and
[1:34:44] became an Archer
[1:34:46] so that is what God wants of us faith
[1:34:49] now the Lord then carries on in the
[1:34:51] Bible he starts to to give the
[1:34:53] Beatitudes where he starts to teach them
[1:34:54] on the mount and give a lot of things
[1:34:57] that people must do
[1:34:58] all the beautiful Expressions how we
[1:35:01] should live and everything and I believe
[1:35:04] I'm a firm believer of a Godly life
[1:35:08] amen I'm a firm believer that God didn't
[1:35:11] save you that your life can stay the
[1:35:12] same
[1:35:14] I'm a firm believer that when God comes
[1:35:16] in he changes you he quickens you he
[1:35:20] lifts you and he changes who you are
[1:35:22] where you come from and where you're
[1:35:23] going because remember you've you maybe
[1:35:25] at some point had plans for your own
[1:35:27] life
[1:35:29] big plans I remember myself I had big
[1:35:32] plans
[1:35:33] not small ones impressive plants
[1:35:36] I had really I was on a drive on a
[1:35:39] motive and I had plans I had my old
[1:35:41] future mapped out
[1:35:43] and I was going and I was achieving and
[1:35:45] I was moving and I was growing and I was
[1:35:47] I was just so so so so absorbed with it
[1:35:51] and then God came my way and he
[1:35:54] disrupted the plan
[1:35:55] he changed it completely
[1:35:58] it changed my direction he changed my
[1:36:00] thinking he changed my focus everything
[1:36:01] just just completely that I would never
[1:36:05] in my own mind I would never it was
[1:36:07] never never part of me to ever think
[1:36:09] I'll be a pastor
[1:36:11] I can still remember vividly I was with
[1:36:13] my friends and we were up to mischief
[1:36:15] and we were walking down the street
[1:36:17] looking what we can break you know
[1:36:19] young boys
[1:36:22] and all of a sudden a voice said to me
[1:36:24] one day you're going to work for me
[1:36:26] I didn't I wasn't even a believer I mean
[1:36:28] I was I was well it wasn't on my mind I
[1:36:31] was looking when I can break and God
[1:36:33] says one day you're going to work for me
[1:36:35] I just left it I never spoke about it I
[1:36:39] just left it I said my goodness what's
[1:36:40] that and I left it but today I look back
[1:36:43] and I knew God had a plan for my life
[1:36:44] from the day I was born and that time
[1:36:47] there comes a place and he starts to put
[1:36:49] it in position and today I say thank you
[1:36:52] Lord for your plan my plan was a total
[1:36:54] disaster my plan was making me an evil
[1:36:58] person
[1:36:59] with self-motive self objectives
[1:37:02] everything but God takes that out of you
[1:37:04] now you don't live for yourself anymore
[1:37:06] you live for him you live for your
[1:37:08] brothers your sisters it's a natural
[1:37:10] life that starts to come out
[1:37:13] that's what God wants from every one of
[1:37:15] us to have a life that we look a life of
[1:37:17] service
[1:37:19] and God starts to tell them in Matthew
[1:37:21] chapter 6 verse 5 and when thou prayest
[1:37:25] thou shall not be as the hypocrite
[1:37:28] are you with me
[1:37:31] as the hypocrite
[1:37:33] how does a hypocrite pray
[1:37:39] hypocrite also prays
[1:37:43] for they love to pray standing in a
[1:37:45] synagogue
[1:37:47] and in the corners of the street that
[1:37:49] they may be seen of men verily I say
[1:37:51] unto you they have the reward but when
[1:37:53] thou prayers enter into thy closet and
[1:37:56] when thou has shut thy door pray to thy
[1:37:57] father which is in secret and thy father
[1:38:00] which live in secret shall reward thee
[1:38:02] openly
[1:38:03] but when you pray use not vain
[1:38:05] repetitions
[1:38:08] God's not impressed by your word the the
[1:38:11] amount of words you use in your prayer
[1:38:15] no you can pray for one hour and God's
[1:38:18] not impressed
[1:38:20] is not the length of the prayer
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:24] repetition of words that's got nothing
[1:38:27] to do with it some of the most powerful
[1:38:30] prayers in the Bible even a prophet is
[1:38:32] short
[1:38:34] directed anointed you know when you move
[1:38:38] into that zone you go and you go and
[1:38:39] you're anointed and and you start to
[1:38:41] speak to God it becomes a different
[1:38:43] thing but when you just Reign
[1:38:45] repetitions God doesn't want you to
[1:38:47] imagine you coming to your father you
[1:38:49] know he's the god of the fatherless you
[1:38:51] come to your father you start to speak
[1:38:53] vain repetitions
[1:38:55] your father will maybe
[1:38:57] do something to you
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:00] you know when we grew up I knew what my
[1:39:02] father would do to me but I know today
[1:39:04] is wrong so let me not go there but you
[1:39:07] know you tell me boy get get behind
[1:39:10] yourself what's wrong with you
[1:39:12] oh you're right must I take you to the
[1:39:13] doctor you keep on repeating yourself
[1:39:15] what's your problem
[1:39:17] you know you haven't you ever you have a
[1:39:19] relationship with your natural father
[1:39:20] and if you don't have a natural father
[1:39:22] your heavenly father you should have a
[1:39:23] relationship with him because he wants
[1:39:25] to be that that one it's so natural
[1:39:27] action that you should look at it you
[1:39:30] know what when I speak to him I speak
[1:39:31] from my heart
[1:39:33] I don't have to do all this kind of
[1:39:36] things and find repetitions to impress
[1:39:38] him he just hears me and he understands
[1:39:40] me and I can speak to him with
[1:39:42] confidence and and just just open my
[1:39:44] heart and express how I feel that's what
[1:39:46] I want do not use vain repetitions
[1:39:50] as the heathens do for they think as
[1:39:53] they shall be heard for their
[1:39:54] much-speaking
[1:39:55] now remember Elijah when he was there
[1:39:57] and he says let us decide today who's
[1:39:59] God
[1:40:00] the one who calls fire from heaven The
[1:40:02] God Who answers your fire that's the God
[1:40:03] we're going to serve and everybody
[1:40:05] agreed they say yes let's join let's do
[1:40:08] it and uh let's let's start to worship
[1:40:10] and he gave them the first opportunity
[1:40:13] and they start in the morning the Bible
[1:40:15] says and they they started with their
[1:40:17] chantings first and you know as they go
[1:40:19] through their rituals calling on them
[1:40:20] the gods and telling their gods and
[1:40:22] doing all the things that they do and
[1:40:24] and nothing happens
[1:40:27] and midday Elijah says maybe your God is
[1:40:29] asleep I think you must put up the
[1:40:31] volume
[1:40:32] the the level of the the volume of the
[1:40:35] speakers has got nothing to do if God
[1:40:36] hears you or not
[1:40:38] you speak from the heart you know you
[1:40:40] can whisper you can't even have to come
[1:40:42] from your mouth but when you speak like
[1:40:44] that God hears you
[1:40:46] and they start to cut themselves and
[1:40:48] jump up and down and go really crazy and
[1:40:51] nothing happens
[1:40:52] and when it is time he takes he takes
[1:40:54] all the water pourses on the sacrifice
[1:40:56] on the altar it's so wet and what does
[1:40:59] he say father just do what you've
[1:41:00] already showed me
[1:41:03] no chanting no no repeating of words no
[1:41:06] impressing the people the problem is we
[1:41:09] want to impress one another you are not
[1:41:11] here to impress one another you are here
[1:41:13] to worship God you are here to tell him
[1:41:15] you love him you are here just to be
[1:41:16] natural
[1:41:17] and Lord I Thank you Lord for a gracious
[1:41:20] time in your presence
[1:41:23] be therefore not like them for your
[1:41:26] father knoweth what things you have need
[1:41:27] of before you ask them
[1:41:30] now there comes the problem
[1:41:32] some people say so if God knows what I
[1:41:34] need I'm not going to pray
[1:41:36] you know people are clever
[1:41:38] they take quotes and scriptures and the
[1:41:40] future they say yeah God already knows
[1:41:42] I'm not even going to pray anymore
[1:41:42] because my God knows
[1:41:44] no that's not what he says
[1:41:46] no
[1:41:48] your father know what things you have
[1:41:49] need of before you ask them so why do we
[1:41:52] pray
[1:41:53] if God knows all things why do we pray
[1:41:55] Roman says
[1:41:57] the spirit help us our infirmities for
[1:42:00] we know not what we should pray for as
[1:42:02] we ought but the spirit itself make of
[1:42:05] intercession for us with groans which
[1:42:07] cannot be uttered for research if the
[1:42:09] hearts know if that what is in the mind
[1:42:11] of the spirit because he make of
[1:42:13] intercession for the sense according to
[1:42:15] the will of God
[1:42:17] When you pray that is as we will read
[1:42:20] that play prayer let's read it after
[1:42:21] this manner therefore you pray Matthew 6
[1:42:24] 9 Our Father
[1:42:27] this is where God teaches them to pray
[1:42:29] Our Father
[1:42:33] which is in heaven we who art in heaven
[1:42:35] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:42:38] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:42:40] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[1:42:42] forgive us our depths and as we forgive
[1:42:45] our debtors lead us not into temptation
[1:42:47] but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is
[1:42:50] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:42:52] forever amen
[1:42:56] it's not a long prayer
[1:42:58] not at all
[1:42:59] but it's a powerful prayer
[1:43:02] he captures everything
[1:43:04] he starts the
[1:43:06] you know with the principle the very
[1:43:08] first verse
[1:43:10] he starts to say Our Father who art in
[1:43:12] heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:43:14] now God when he came to Moses God always
[1:43:17] are interested that we understand him
[1:43:19] that we know who he is when he came to
[1:43:21] Moses in the burning bush and Moses said
[1:43:23] to him who who must I say has send me
[1:43:26] says I am who I am
[1:43:28] I am who I am he wants to give Moses an
[1:43:32] expression that he is God it's a perfect
[1:43:35] description of God because in there you
[1:43:37] cannot limit God
[1:43:39] if I need healing he is the god I am who
[1:43:41] I am
[1:43:42] if I need salvation he is my God if I
[1:43:45] need Deliverance he is still that God
[1:43:46] there is nothing that he cannot do it
[1:43:49] doesn't matter what your situation is
[1:43:51] God is more than able to help you every
[1:43:54] time there is no need that God does not
[1:43:56] specialize in there is nothing that you
[1:43:58] can say but this is different there is
[1:44:00] nothing different I am who I am and I
[1:44:03] can do what I want to do and I can heal
[1:44:04] everybody
[1:44:06] I can deliver anybody
[1:44:08] because that delivering power is still
[1:44:10] there it's the same God if he has done
[1:44:12] it for one person he'll do it for you
[1:44:13] he's not a respecter of person he does
[1:44:16] not love one more than the other he
[1:44:18] loves his children all the same there is
[1:44:20] not one that he can say that one is my
[1:44:22] favorite
[1:44:24] no for the bride he loves us all
[1:44:27] unconditionally the same basis there's
[1:44:30] nobody that's higher or lower
[1:44:32] because his father and we are his
[1:44:34] children he's a real good father he
[1:44:37] loves them all the same he understands
[1:44:39] us in our uniqueness and he loves us so
[1:44:42] he said to Moses I am who I am then he
[1:44:44] also said to Moses I'll be gracious to
[1:44:46] him I will be gracious
[1:44:48] and I will have mercy upon who will I
[1:44:50] have mercy
[1:44:51] an expression
[1:44:54] I'm God almighty
[1:44:55] and so he continues to explain himself
[1:44:58] imagine when Moses went up the mountain
[1:45:00] God started to give him the law
[1:45:03] and God takes the tablets and he writes
[1:45:06] the law on it
[1:45:07] and then God comes to Moses he says you
[1:45:09] better go down those people of you your
[1:45:11] people
[1:45:13] a busy worshiping
[1:45:15] a golden cup the the evil
[1:45:18] so God just tell Moses straight go down
[1:45:20] and sort out your people what was God
[1:45:22] telling me I'm finished with them
[1:45:25] and Moses turns around and that's always
[1:45:26] to me so astounding that Moses said to
[1:45:28] God no it's not my people
[1:45:31] it's your people he brought the
[1:45:34] responsibility back to God and God loved
[1:45:36] that about Moses and that's why you know
[1:45:38] it's not my people it's God's people
[1:45:40] when there's a problem I turn to the
[1:45:42] Lord and say Lord you've got the best
[1:45:43] people Lord if my church gives me
[1:45:45] problems I turn to the Lord and say Lord
[1:45:47] the best they are yours I'm also one of
[1:45:50] them because you don't make mistakes you
[1:45:52] didn't choose the wrong ones you didn't
[1:45:54] place the wrong ones you know if I were
[1:45:56] if I had to choose you know I'll choose
[1:45:58] differently but God chooses the right
[1:45:59] people he places the right people in the
[1:46:02] right church so that they can grow in
[1:46:04] one another and work on one another and
[1:46:06] sometimes rub one another
[1:46:09] because you have got nothing if
[1:46:11] everybody agrees with you
[1:46:12] but when people start to disagree with
[1:46:14] you and rub you the wrong way then the
[1:46:16] true character of a true Son of God
[1:46:17] comes out because that's the person you
[1:46:19] should love the most in the church
[1:46:22] the one that hates you the one that
[1:46:24] doesn't greet you the one that rubs you
[1:46:25] the one that one that's the one you
[1:46:27] should appreciate the most
[1:46:29] because that's the one God plays there
[1:46:30] for you
[1:46:32] is the love of God
[1:46:34] when you see that brother or sister you
[1:46:36] should embrace them and say man I thank
[1:46:39] God for you every day of my life
[1:46:41] please come to church don't skip a
[1:46:43] service
[1:46:44] but we when the person is not here oh
[1:46:46] goodness today is going to be a good day
[1:46:48] today is going to be wonderful man I
[1:46:50] already feel a little bit I know you
[1:46:52] look at her and say Lord the one you
[1:46:55] gave me is not here
[1:46:56] I'm not complete today because Lord
[1:46:58] there's a purpose like like your boss he
[1:47:00] loves you and all of a sudden God
[1:47:01] changes your boss
[1:47:03] the one that hates you
[1:47:05] it's the love of God
[1:47:06] is the love of God for you because he
[1:47:09] cares for you he loves you the human
[1:47:11] mind cannot understand that but we're
[1:47:13] not here to understand with our mind we
[1:47:15] are here to get the mind of Christ and
[1:47:16] to say Lord you are in control so this
[1:47:19] ugly boss you gave me I love him
[1:47:22] I thank you for him every day when I
[1:47:24] walk in that's the first one I want to
[1:47:26] greet
[1:47:28] and he's going to scold me
[1:47:30] he's going to put me under pressure
[1:47:32] but Lord that's where I grow because
[1:47:34] nobody grows in a comfort zone
[1:47:37] is that right
[1:47:40] and God knows that because God's in the
[1:47:42] business to grow you
[1:47:44] to mature you
[1:47:45] to to mold you to help you because he's
[1:47:49] not in the business to just give you
[1:47:50] comfort zone he's there to grow you
[1:47:53] and God wants that for us
[1:47:56] now imagine
[1:47:58] he comes to Moses again
[1:48:00] when Moses comes back the second time up
[1:48:03] the mountain God now tells him you know
[1:48:06] what let me explain more he says I I'm a
[1:48:08] very gracious God
[1:48:09] I'll forgive thousands their iniquity
[1:48:12] he's telling Moses now that in me is
[1:48:14] Grace
[1:48:15] these people has disappointed me but
[1:48:16] they're in me there's Grace in me I can
[1:48:18] I can walk with them
[1:48:21] and he tells Moses you shall worship no
[1:48:22] other God for the Lord whose name is
[1:48:24] jealous
[1:48:25] he's a jealous God
[1:48:27] so can you imagine that somebody calls
[1:48:30] his own name jealous
[1:48:32] my name is jealous
[1:48:34] and I'm a jealous God that's what he
[1:48:36] says to Moses
[1:48:38] but it's not our jealous it's not human
[1:48:40] jealousy
[1:48:41] we've got a problem to we we redirectly
[1:48:44] move the translation you know from if
[1:48:46] God is a jealous God I'm also jealous
[1:48:48] it's not the same
[1:48:50] your jealousy is not God's jealousy
[1:48:53] because that jealousy means zealous
[1:48:56] I'm a zealous God I I've got a desire I
[1:48:59] look at you and God is is jealous about
[1:49:02] two things number one his name and
[1:49:04] number two you
[1:49:05] he protect his name it doesn't matter
[1:49:08] what it cost him and he will protect you
[1:49:10] he will help you but we have got a
[1:49:12] jealousy uh envy and things that we look
[1:49:15] at what what what does it mean when we
[1:49:17] say you are jealous or envious
[1:49:20] it means a feeling of displeasure over
[1:49:22] the blessings others are enjoying
[1:49:28] sometimes somebody's got a gift
[1:49:33] maybe a ministering gift
[1:49:36] a singing gift any gift
[1:49:39] and you look at that and you think Why
[1:49:40] Not Me Lord
[1:49:42] that's Envy
[1:49:45] yeah it's it's a small Envy but it's
[1:49:48] Envy
[1:49:49] Lord I think I deserve also the same
[1:49:51] kind of gift Lord I've been faithful
[1:49:54] Lord many that person came in yesterday
[1:49:55] Lord my and I've been sitting here for
[1:49:58] 10 years and now Lord look at that that
[1:50:00] the fruits the blessings that person is
[1:50:02] yielding Lord why not me
[1:50:04] that's a that's the start of envy that
[1:50:07] sister well our approach should always
[1:50:09] be Lord
[1:50:10] if anybody gets a gift if anybody is
[1:50:12] blessed in a certain way let me rally
[1:50:14] behind it
[1:50:16] let me lift up the hands that's become
[1:50:18] free let me just be a prayer what in me
[1:50:20] just be let me thank you Lord for
[1:50:22] anything you do because the whole church
[1:50:24] is going to benefit from any gift God
[1:50:26] sent
[1:50:27] we should always look at it from that
[1:50:29] perspective it's a blessing Lord if it's
[1:50:31] not me Lord I can at least appreciate it
[1:50:33] pray for it support it and do everything
[1:50:35] I can and be excited over it
[1:50:38] but many times we sit in our peace and
[1:50:39] say that should have been me
[1:50:42] yeah it should have been me
[1:50:46] so jealousy wants what others have but
[1:50:48] Envy wants to keep them from having it
[1:50:50] so where do we find that Joseph when his
[1:50:52] father gave him that coat of many colors
[1:50:55] instead of his brothers be getting
[1:50:57] excited because the blessings would flow
[1:50:59] from Joseph Joseph in fact was a
[1:51:01] blessing that God sent to them
[1:51:04] Joseph was there to preserve their lives
[1:51:06] if they had the full picture they would
[1:51:09] have had a different attitude towards
[1:51:10] that but they would have said Lord let
[1:51:12] me be careful let me walk carefully here
[1:51:14] but the Envy ate them up
[1:51:16] they hated him because of what God has
[1:51:18] was busy doing it and many times in the
[1:51:21] message Realms you know churches hate
[1:51:22] one another they look at this they look
[1:51:24] at that and they compare and people
[1:51:26] compare and Believers compare and it
[1:51:28] becomes a big competition
[1:51:31] we are not in a competition we are here
[1:51:34] to do what God wants us to do where he
[1:51:36] placed us let us just do that little bit
[1:51:39] that we can do
[1:51:40] it is so wonderful just to find your
[1:51:42] place and purpose when you find your
[1:51:44] place you're in competition with nobody
[1:51:47] when you find your place as a preacher
[1:51:49] you're in competition with nobody
[1:51:50] because nobody can preach like me
[1:51:53] with my faults of my feelings of my
[1:51:55] stutterings with all this I find comfort
[1:51:58] in that
[1:51:59] because I'm not in competition
[1:52:01] the prophet was not in competition
[1:52:04] remember when he walked and he visited
[1:52:06] oral Roberts's place and those big
[1:52:08] Avengers that came out from his ministry
[1:52:10] he visited their big palaces
[1:52:13] and he saw hundreds of people working
[1:52:15] there machines typewriters going let us
[1:52:19] going in and out
[1:52:20] and it and it had an effect upon him
[1:52:23] he was a human
[1:52:25] he walked out there and he felt bad
[1:52:28] he said Lord what have I done have I
[1:52:30] failed you
[1:52:31] why Lord why don't I they come from my
[1:52:34] Ministry I should have been greater than
[1:52:36] that
[1:52:37] and the Lord taking behind the the
[1:52:39] building then he said to him no no look
[1:52:41] up
[1:52:43] and he says what do you see I see
[1:52:45] Heavens he says your portion is in
[1:52:47] heaven larger than you can contain then
[1:52:50] you can imagine our blessings our
[1:52:52] portions are not here our portion is in
[1:52:54] heaven we should just be comfortable to
[1:52:56] say Lord whatever you've got for me I am
[1:52:58] I'm content
[1:53:02] soul and David when David was there
[1:53:05] David being sent as a blessing and they
[1:53:07] go to the battle he killed Goliath he
[1:53:09] starts to become a blessing to Saul's
[1:53:12] Army
[1:53:14] imagine if you were a Godly King
[1:53:21] man I'll thank God every day of my life
[1:53:24] if there's a battle where's David
[1:53:27] they are these generals there's other
[1:53:29] source but where's David
[1:53:31] because you know he's got a powerful
[1:53:33] impact you know he's anointed of God to
[1:53:35] do these things but when they come back
[1:53:37] into the city the women start to sing
[1:53:39] Saul has killed his thousands but David
[1:53:41] sees ten thousands
[1:53:43] but they didn't kill it for so
[1:53:47] many times we take it personally and we
[1:53:50] think it's my business
[1:53:51] it's God's business it's not my church
[1:53:54] it's God's Church you know it's not my
[1:53:56] people it's God's people when you have
[1:53:59] the plan of God it takes a lot of
[1:54:02] pressure of you
[1:54:04] if God finished with you he'll take you
[1:54:05] home
[1:54:07] and the church will still continue
[1:54:10] others will be added some will go home
[1:54:15] and he he knows what he's doing
[1:54:18] so that envy and jealousy has always
[1:54:19] been part of it and you even find it in
[1:54:22] the message ranks but we have to be
[1:54:25] careful we have to consider ourselves as
[1:54:27] a Lord let me be sincere let me be
[1:54:30] focused let me understand what you're
[1:54:31] busy with
[1:54:36] but God's jealousy is not our jealousy
[1:54:39] because God's love is never controlling
[1:54:45] amen
[1:54:46] just wanted to sink in a little bit
[1:54:49] God's love is never controlling
[1:54:52] God has never controlled me
[1:54:59] to make a decision
[1:55:01] he tells me what he wants and he wants
[1:55:03] me to make that decision because I'm a
[1:55:05] free moral agent and he invites me he
[1:55:07] pulls me he he encourages me he's got a
[1:55:10] way in effect upon me
[1:55:13] God's love was never insecure
[1:55:17] for me
[1:55:18] God's love was never selfish
[1:55:22] or irrational or all those things that
[1:55:24] we humans struggle with God's love is so
[1:55:26] pure so holy so wonderful The Love Is
[1:55:28] God for me there's enough for you as
[1:55:30] well
[1:55:31] the fact that he loves me so much
[1:55:32] doesn't mean he loves you less
[1:55:34] he has got so much love to give that the
[1:55:37] way he loves me he loves you imagine if
[1:55:39] we can just experience or believe that
[1:55:43] like Paul said to them I am jealous over
[1:55:45] you of a Godly jealousy for I have
[1:55:47] espoused you to one husband what is he
[1:55:49] saying he says it is not about me
[1:55:53] but with a Godly jealousy Paul never
[1:55:55] says you are my people he actually
[1:55:57] rebuked him some say you were from Paul
[1:55:59] some say we're from Apollo some say we
[1:56:01] from that he rebuked him and says you
[1:56:03] are from God and God alone you are God's
[1:56:05] children
[1:56:06] and we should always remember it
[1:56:08] amen because that Zeal that jealousy
[1:56:12] that zealousness you know people has
[1:56:14] done many evil things with with that
[1:56:16] Zeal for God
[1:56:20] the Romans have killed 68 million
[1:56:23] Christians for a Zeal of God they
[1:56:26] thought they were doing goddess service
[1:56:28] and so you can take many examples you
[1:56:30] have to be careful and ask yourself is
[1:56:33] my Zeal for God fleshly or spiritually
[1:56:36] a fleshly Zeal will do certain things
[1:56:38] but a spiritual Zeal will do other
[1:56:40] things
[1:56:41] and we have to be very careful in the
[1:56:43] time we live to be able to ask ourselves
[1:56:46] so the first thing is you have to
[1:56:48] conquer yourself
[1:56:49] to be able to be used of God
[1:56:51] if you don't conquer yourself God can
[1:56:53] never use you
[1:56:55] so the only Christian that really
[1:56:57] qualifies to to move and fight for God
[1:56:59] is a is a Christian that knows uh that
[1:57:03] that hates his own sins
[1:57:07] because Paul says who will deliver me of
[1:57:09] this wretched body when I want to do
[1:57:11] good evil is present
[1:57:13] but Paul had the right attitude he knew
[1:57:15] in my members he says there's another
[1:57:17] War fighting with me in my members you
[1:57:19] know I don't want to do these things but
[1:57:20] all of a sudden I find myself doing
[1:57:22] something wrong but I war against it and
[1:57:24] who will deliver me against this evil
[1:57:26] man
[1:57:28] now can you imagine an apostle a prophet
[1:57:30] speak like that
[1:57:32] and the prophet many times says my
[1:57:34] greatest problem is myself
[1:57:36] and so he refers to himself and that's
[1:57:37] what we mean to say if you need if you
[1:57:40] want God to use you conquer yourself
[1:57:42] understand that you've got your own
[1:57:44] problems that you battle and what is
[1:57:46] your real motive to fighting for the
[1:57:49] will of God what is the motive for your
[1:57:51] Zeal for God
[1:57:53] many people has got a wonderful Zeal but
[1:57:55] the motive is wrong
[1:57:57] some motives can be can be questioned
[1:58:00] that's why the prophet says if you want
[1:58:02] to do anything check your motive and
[1:58:03] objective
[1:58:05] what do you want to achieve by this
[1:58:07] what do you want to do how is it going
[1:58:08] to bring glory to God if that motive is
[1:58:11] pure and holy you can carry on because
[1:58:12] God will bless it
[1:58:14] amen God will certainly bless it
[1:58:18] now the prophet says in the message the
[1:58:20] unconditional Covenant
[1:58:22] he says the bride is the Covenant people
[1:58:26] unconditionally
[1:58:28] so you have got an Covenant which is
[1:58:30] unconditional
[1:58:31] God called you out of the world
[1:58:34] and he gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:58:36] you know how it felt when he called you
[1:58:38] when he saved you when he blessed you
[1:58:41] and he gave you the Holy Ghost the seed
[1:58:43] of Abram you are tonight with a blessed
[1:58:45] promise
[1:58:46] if you are then Abram's seat you have
[1:58:48] this promise in you you believe God
[1:58:50] regardless of what take place
[1:58:53] and I like this part the Holy Ghost
[1:58:55] makes you believe it anyhow
[1:58:59] man I'm so thankful for that
[1:59:03] so what I realized from that is it's not
[1:59:05] my faith
[1:59:08] it's not my little faith that sits here
[1:59:11] my faith comes from here and that's from
[1:59:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:59:14] and if I don't believe it he says no
[1:59:16] Holy Ghost makes you believe it
[1:59:21] you believe things which humanly you can
[1:59:24] never believe but all of a sudden from
[1:59:26] here you believe the word it becomes a
[1:59:28] different perspective he says because
[1:59:29] the Holy Ghost make you to believe
[1:59:31] because they see it inside of you you
[1:59:33] are hearing from your theophany it's a
[1:59:35] deep calling unto the deep and then you
[1:59:37] become an expression
[1:59:39] of such a wonderful wonderful Grace of
[1:59:42] the Lord
[1:59:43] so you come there and you understand
[1:59:44] your God's Grace has been kind unto me
[1:59:47] and he helps me to believe it he helps
[1:59:49] me my father could not believe it but I
[1:59:52] hear I come out of his loins and I can
[1:59:53] believe it
[1:59:54] so it's got nothing to do with the
[1:59:56] lineage you come from
[1:59:58] it's got nothing to do with your mother
[1:59:59] your father he's got nothing to do with
[2:00:01] your grandfather it's got something to
[2:00:03] do if he's that seed of God placed in
[2:00:05] you before the foundation of the world
[2:00:07] and when that has happened you can never
[2:00:09] never go lost
[2:00:12] that's why sometimes we baptize people
[2:00:14] at 80.
[2:00:16] I think the oldest person we baptized
[2:00:18] was plus 80 plus
[2:00:21] the other day we baptized a blind sister
[2:00:24] I think she's 75.
[2:00:27] I mean if you look at that you realize
[2:00:28] Lord
[2:00:30] our whole life
[2:00:31] blind this that and the other and at the
[2:00:34] end of her life you come in
[2:00:35] and you place that positionally there
[2:00:37] she looks at the word she's blind she
[2:00:40] can't see it but she sees it from here
[2:00:41] she the Revelation eats her heart and
[2:00:43] she comes and she gets baptized and
[2:00:45] she's a Believer and if she dies
[2:00:46] tomorrow she is secure
[2:00:48] she's a cure in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:52] but when the Lord says Hallowed be thy
[2:00:55] name Our Father who art in heaven
[2:00:56] Hallowed be thy name what does he mean
[2:00:59] what does he mean when he says Hallowed
[2:01:01] be thy name because remember when you
[2:01:04] pray to the Lord as Jesus taught us
[2:01:05] there it is where you start
[2:01:08] Our Father
[2:01:10] what does it mean
[2:01:12] let your name be Sanctified hallow means
[2:01:15] sanctification hallow means to bring
[2:01:17] glory to the Lord hallow means Lord we
[2:01:20] are thanking you
[2:01:21] so God when you start that's where you
[2:01:24] start
[2:01:25] you should always bring glory to God's
[2:01:27] name
[2:01:28] When you pray that's where you'll start
[2:01:31] you don't say Lord I need this I need
[2:01:32] this I need this that's that's nothing
[2:01:34] to do with it
[2:01:35] When you pray you start to sell tell God
[2:01:37] how great he is how wonderful he is how
[2:01:40] you love him what he means for you you
[2:01:42] tell him how great his name is because
[2:01:44] not not just from lip service but
[2:01:46] meaning it from your heart
[2:01:48] because that's what God wants to hear
[2:01:50] then as you pray then for one another
[2:01:52] you know it becomes a different story
[2:01:53] then then it's no more important but you
[2:01:56] start to enter into a realm where you
[2:01:58] start to glorify God
[2:02:00] because he says before you ask he
[2:02:02] already knows what what you have in need
[2:02:04] of so you'll get to that he already
[2:02:05] knows it
[2:02:07] but prayer what is the purpose then so
[2:02:09] let's take an example from numbers 20
[2:02:11] from verse 7.
[2:02:13] and this is for me
[2:02:14] one of the greatest examples
[2:02:17] of a man getting derailed
[2:02:20] a man of God
[2:02:22] you believe a man of God can get
[2:02:24] derailed
[2:02:25] yes of course he's human
[2:02:27] but God will always bring him back
[2:02:31] and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying
[2:02:34] take the rod
[2:02:35] gather down the assembly together thou
[2:02:37] and Aaron thy brother and speak he unto
[2:02:40] the rock before their eyes and it shall
[2:02:42] give forth his water and thou shall
[2:02:43] bring forth to them water out of the
[2:02:45] rock so shall thou give the congregation
[2:02:47] and their Beast drink
[2:02:49] plain
[2:02:51] simple clear instruction
[2:02:54] a child can follow it
[2:02:57] Moses take the rod take the people go to
[2:03:00] the Rock
[2:03:01] take the rod and speak to the Rock and
[2:03:04] The Rock will give water
[2:03:06] so it's very plain
[2:03:07] very simple
[2:03:09] is that true
[2:03:11] now verse 9 and Moses took the rod from
[2:03:14] before the Lord as he commanded him so
[2:03:15] Moses starts out well
[2:03:18] the Lord said take the road he takes the
[2:03:20] road
[2:03:21] but the problem comes when he comes in
[2:03:23] front of the people he he was he was as
[2:03:25] we would call it Fed Up
[2:03:27] is that the right word for you guys Fed
[2:03:30] Up
[2:03:31] is up to here
[2:03:33] so the the pot boiled over
[2:03:35] the camel's back was broken with all
[2:03:37] those statements
[2:03:39] so he takes the road he goes out and
[2:03:41] when he sees the people something
[2:03:43] happened
[2:03:44] he snaps
[2:03:47] amen
[2:03:48] because of pressure
[2:03:50] because he's a human he you know he can
[2:03:52] only take so much
[2:03:55] and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[2:03:57] congregation Point number two well done
[2:04:00] together before the Rock
[2:04:02] and he said unto them
[2:04:04] that's where the problem comes in so he
[2:04:07] follows the first two steps very nicely
[2:04:08] God never said to him speak to the
[2:04:10] people
[2:04:13] so the moment where you start to go on
[2:04:15] your own on your own way that's where
[2:04:16] God that's where trouble sits him
[2:04:19] if you can follow God's instructions 100
[2:04:21] trouble will not sit in but we follow
[2:04:24] the first two three four steps and at
[2:04:26] some point we want to inject our own
[2:04:27] thoughts own ideas because this is too
[2:04:30] simple
[2:04:31] or something happened or you were like
[2:04:33] Moses you are frustrated or or something
[2:04:36] like that that's why if you are
[2:04:37] frustrated and you don't have the right
[2:04:39] motive don't come and preach to the
[2:04:41] people if you need to talk and encourage
[2:04:43] somebody make sure that you feel in
[2:04:46] yourself you know what I can do it
[2:04:47] because if you are frustrated and and
[2:04:49] you don't come with the love of God
[2:04:51] you're gonna make a mess of it
[2:04:54] you're going to say things which you
[2:04:55] regret
[2:04:56] that's why he says You must control the
[2:04:59] tongue
[2:05:00] it's one of the most difficult things to
[2:05:02] control because the tongue can speak
[2:05:03] before you know it you know sometimes
[2:05:04] words just slip out of my mouth I wonder
[2:05:06] where does that come from
[2:05:08] I never wanted to say that but my tongue
[2:05:10] just
[2:05:11] whoa that's why he says keep your mouth
[2:05:13] close control it
[2:05:15] if you don't feel well don't say
[2:05:16] anything
[2:05:17] it will it will it will help you
[2:05:19] tremendously
[2:05:20] just go home and pray and get a better
[2:05:22] atmosphere and then come and start to
[2:05:23] speak that's why you never address the
[2:05:25] issue when you're angry you never solve
[2:05:27] a conflict in your house when you're
[2:05:29] angry and upset as the prophet teaches
[2:05:31] us first get calm down and relax because
[2:05:33] you're going to do things say things
[2:05:34] which you're gonna regret the rest of
[2:05:37] your life
[2:05:40] now and he said unto them
[2:05:43] you know you nibbles
[2:05:46] Yo God never said that
[2:05:48] sometimes pastors come to the pulpit and
[2:05:51] they start to speak like that
[2:05:52] God never said speak like that
[2:05:55] yeah now you rebels
[2:05:58] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[2:06:01] that was never God's instructions
[2:06:04] it was never God's motive or it was
[2:06:06] never God's will
[2:06:08] but Moses now goes on and he does that
[2:06:10] and Moses lift up his hand and with his
[2:06:12] Rod he smote The Rock twice and the
[2:06:14] water came out abundantly and the
[2:06:16] congregation drank and their Beast also
[2:06:19] so the water that Carl Moses was now
[2:06:21] completely on his own
[2:06:24] but because he's a prophet God begs him
[2:06:27] and that's where people miss the thing
[2:06:29] in our day when you are called The
[2:06:31] Prophet that plays a dispensational
[2:06:32] prophet God will always back you up it
[2:06:35] does not matter what happened but he
[2:06:36] will deal with you behind the scenes
[2:06:39] there's many things God dealt without
[2:06:40] Prophet which he never speaks about
[2:06:43] if the pattern of the Bible is true
[2:06:46] but he stays a prophet
[2:06:48] and he had desires he did things
[2:06:51] wonderfully did things wrong and God
[2:06:53] helped him and God guided him
[2:06:55] and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[2:06:58] because you believe me not
[2:07:01] and that's why I want to dwell
[2:07:03] to sanctify me to hallow my name
[2:07:07] in the eyes of the children of Israel
[2:07:08] therefore you shall not bring this
[2:07:10] congregation into the land which I have
[2:07:12] given them so when God when you go in
[2:07:14] your own tantrum you are not hallowing
[2:07:16] honoring God's name
[2:07:18] to God is you are not believing him
[2:07:21] that's why don't try and get better
[2:07:23] plans than God many times we want to
[2:07:26] help God you know get a better way get
[2:07:29] an easier way no God's ways is perfect
[2:07:31] what you need to do is find rest in
[2:07:33] God's ways to say Lord let me rest in
[2:07:35] your way father God I'm not going to add
[2:07:37] to it or take away but let your world be
[2:07:39] done in all matters
[2:07:41] so God says because you believe me not
[2:07:44] the prophet says in greater than Solomon
[2:07:46] when God put a curse on somebody
[2:07:49] and I come around with a gift and took
[2:07:51] it off
[2:07:53] do you know I can get it will get you in
[2:07:55] trouble
[2:07:57] do you know you can get in trouble with
[2:07:59] gifts
[2:08:00] so he says God places something on
[2:08:02] somebody
[2:08:03] and you come and you remove it
[2:08:06] he says you're in trouble
[2:08:07] because God knows what he's doing
[2:08:10] he says look at Moses Moses was a
[2:08:13] prophet God trusted him he go down there
[2:08:16] and speak to that rock don't Smite it
[2:08:18] speak to it and Moses went down there
[2:08:19] and got angry
[2:08:22] and smote The Rock
[2:08:24] he brought the water whether it was the
[2:08:25] will of God or not is right right and he
[2:08:28] broke the scriptures
[2:08:30] one place in the scripture I found it
[2:08:32] broke
[2:08:33] he said there was no pattern for Jesus
[2:08:35] to be smitten twice
[2:08:37] so Moses broke every pattern
[2:08:40] but he stayed God's prophet and God
[2:08:42] begged him and God helped him and he
[2:08:45] paid the price for this
[2:08:47] so we need to understand that we need to
[2:08:50] sanctify hallow his name when we pray
[2:08:53] so when we say our father was remember I
[2:08:55] want you to notice that whole prayer
[2:08:57] there is no I or me
[2:09:01] the whole prayer that Jesus taught them
[2:09:03] there is nothing about me I
[2:09:07] nothing
[2:09:08] not one word
[2:09:11] and he says Our Father which means it is
[2:09:13] a group
[2:09:15] Our Father which is the father of the
[2:09:18] church Our Father Our Father it co
[2:09:21] includes everything you are not you are
[2:09:24] admitting that you don't pray alone that
[2:09:25] you belong to a family of God so the
[2:09:28] Lord's Prayer is not a private prayer
[2:09:31] I and me is nowhere to be found
[2:09:34] so when we say our prayer Our Father we
[2:09:37] admit that we are in community and
[2:09:39] fellowship of the Believers That We Are
[2:09:41] Family
[2:09:43] that we can pray together and stand
[2:09:44] together
[2:09:45] you are confessing that your problems is
[2:09:47] not your own
[2:09:49] but all our problems are combined
[2:09:51] we should look at one another's problems
[2:09:53] say our father
[2:09:55] so when we pray we should say our father
[2:09:58] help our problems
[2:10:01] because you don't have to look at
[2:10:02] yourself you have to pray for somebody
[2:10:03] else
[2:10:04] God wants you to look not selfishly but
[2:10:07] once you start to live a life that you
[2:10:09] live for other people then your own
[2:10:10] problems your own needs is not so high
[2:10:12] on the list anymore but your brother and
[2:10:14] sister's problem has escalated to a
[2:10:16] level that you can look at it and say
[2:10:18] Lord help me
[2:10:19] help me father to be an intercessor to
[2:10:21] pray for them
[2:10:23] to be able to stand there before them
[2:10:25] Lord and bless them our father we are
[2:10:29] saying a statement because we are making
[2:10:31] him family he is our father is an
[2:10:34] authoritative figure because and we
[2:10:37] don't need an appointment to address him
[2:10:40] my children never needs an appointment
[2:10:42] to see me
[2:10:44] they can just come and they can talk to
[2:10:46] me and that's the same you know we've
[2:10:47] got direct access you've got direct
[2:10:50] access to your father so when you pray
[2:10:52] you close your eyes and you start to
[2:10:54] pray you've got direct access you've got
[2:10:56] a direct appointment and it's days
[2:10:58] calendar is clear
[2:11:01] it doesn't say to you no come back next
[2:11:03] week Tuesday
[2:11:05] there's 50 in front of you
[2:11:07] imagine if that was the case
[2:11:10] but direct anytime any minute any time
[2:11:13] of the day it doesn't matter when you
[2:11:15] close your algebra and you say Our
[2:11:17] Father Who Art in Heaven There is an
[2:11:19] immediate appointment a direct actors
[2:11:21] and you speak to your father directly
[2:11:23] and he hears every word that you whisper
[2:11:26] it is so wonderful to understand
[2:11:29] that we have family rights
[2:11:34] there's strangers in this family
[2:11:37] when we're at table at our house
[2:11:40] the family
[2:11:41] they don't ask where can I sit or what
[2:11:45] must I do
[2:11:46] the families got family I walk up to the
[2:11:48] table they take a place they dish up
[2:11:49] they sit down they they they they don't
[2:11:52] ask and I dish can I do this visitors
[2:11:54] come and say where must I sit what can I
[2:11:55] do you know they're asking for leading
[2:11:57] and so they don't have family rights but
[2:12:00] as a family when you come in you've got
[2:12:01] certain rights and that's why we call
[2:12:03] him father and that gives us certain
[2:12:05] rights that when we come to him we come
[2:12:07] with that childish expression to say
[2:12:09] Lord I believe you to be my father I
[2:12:11] trust you explicitly and when I ask you
[2:12:14] something you're gonna help me
[2:12:16] I've got full confidence in you Lord
[2:12:18] that you can never fail me
[2:12:20] family rights you don't need an
[2:12:22] appointment
[2:12:24] so we speak about our father
[2:12:27] of our community our our Believers our
[2:12:30] family
[2:12:31] of the authority
[2:12:33] he cares for us
[2:12:35] so the word father means
[2:12:38] God is the source of all you have
[2:12:41] because you cannot be here without a
[2:12:43] father
[2:12:44] none of you came out of the air
[2:12:47] drop from moon or somewhere
[2:12:49] you came here because you had a mother
[2:12:51] and a father
[2:12:52] and so if you say our father it means
[2:12:55] he's the source
[2:12:57] of my life
[2:12:58] is the source of everything I am
[2:13:02] without him I'm nothing
[2:13:04] without him I cannot be anything but
[2:13:07] with him all things become possible
[2:13:09] amen I cannot do anything without him
[2:13:12] but with him all things are possible
[2:13:14] because I have an understanding like
[2:13:17] when when Paul came to them the people
[2:13:19] that were worshiping the Unseen God
[2:13:23] Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and
[2:13:25] said you men of Athens I perceived that
[2:13:27] in all things you are too superstitious
[2:13:30] many times people become superstitious
[2:13:33] if there's no Pillar of Fire behind the
[2:13:35] pulpit you know we didn't have a good
[2:13:36] service
[2:13:38] there was no this or that it's not good
[2:13:40] enough
[2:13:41] if I take a photo now and there's a
[2:13:44] light behind me you know everybody will
[2:13:45] be happy
[2:13:46] superstitious he says you become too
[2:13:48] superstitious for as I pass by and be
[2:13:51] out your devotions I found an altar with
[2:13:52] this inscription to the unknown God
[2:13:55] whom therefore you ignorantly worship
[2:13:58] him I declare unto you that's what we
[2:14:01] want you know I want to know this God in
[2:14:03] the power of his resurrection I want to
[2:14:05] know him so intimately so personally
[2:14:07] that I understand him and he understands
[2:14:09] me
[2:14:10] you know sometimes you get disappointed
[2:14:13] from the day God Saves you the
[2:14:15] disappointments come here a little there
[2:14:17] little there but God has never
[2:14:19] disappointed me
[2:14:20] God has never failed me God cannot do
[2:14:23] that
[2:14:24] father speaks of authority he he's the
[2:14:27] father we are the children and the child
[2:14:29] cannot dictate to the father
[2:14:31] how things should be done
[2:14:33] so we should believe even trust him
[2:14:34] explicitly for our lives
[2:14:37] and father means that he's a God for
[2:14:39] tender love and care
[2:14:41] so he's a god a father that will never
[2:14:44] let his children go
[2:14:46] never
[2:14:47] he loves his children with an
[2:14:49] everlasting love
[2:14:50] that is faithful and loyal no matter
[2:14:53] what happens
[2:14:56] when we turn our back on him he still
[2:14:57] loved us
[2:14:59] many people has turned back on him
[2:15:02] but he brings them back
[2:15:04] when we were far away he loved us
[2:15:08] when we turned our back on him he still
[2:15:10] loved us
[2:15:11] when we broke his law he still loved us
[2:15:14] because remember every one of us broke
[2:15:17] the law every day of Our Lives the law
[2:15:19] can never save you the law puts you in
[2:15:21] prison there is nobody in this building
[2:15:22] including me that can keep the law
[2:15:25] we fail daily
[2:15:27] and let me shock you even as you sit in
[2:15:29] church you extend
[2:15:33] because since the service started how
[2:15:35] many thoughts in the devil place
[2:15:37] thinking about work maybe quickly or you
[2:15:39] know this or that you know you drift
[2:15:40] quickly in and out so you're in church
[2:15:42] but then you are in Auckland and then
[2:15:45] you're back here again or whatever
[2:15:46] happens but you can move in and out of
[2:15:48] the church building without you know
[2:15:51] even knowing the devil can be so quickly
[2:15:54] he can do me all these kinds of things
[2:15:55] so what am I saying I'm saying is that
[2:15:58] we live by grace
[2:15:59] if the Devil comes and he starts to pull
[2:16:01] you into another atmosphere bring
[2:16:04] yourself back to say no how do you do it
[2:16:08] just tell yourself what's happened now
[2:16:11] be conscious
[2:16:14] be conscious say no something happened
[2:16:16] now I drifted
[2:16:18] why did I drift
[2:16:20] let me come back and focus because Jesus
[2:16:22] says look upon me and live
[2:16:24] so the deeper you focus upon the word
[2:16:26] and what you receive the more he pulls
[2:16:28] you into it because remember he says we
[2:16:29] are sitting this morning in Heavenly
[2:16:31] places
[2:16:33] some people are still interested in what
[2:16:35] is this place called
[2:16:37] Stratford
[2:16:38] some are still in Stratford some are
[2:16:40] halfway up Jacob's leather and some are
[2:16:41] right in heaven already
[2:16:43] feeding and voicing and reading and some
[2:16:46] are still here in Stratford but God says
[2:16:48] when you come together you've got an
[2:16:50] opportunity every Sunday morning to sit
[2:16:52] in heaven to Feast upon the world and to
[2:16:55] leave your problems behind and to just
[2:16:57] walk Where Angels walk and feel the
[2:16:59] Praises of God and say Lord I am so
[2:17:01] thankful to be a child of God I'm so
[2:17:03] happy
[2:17:04] I'm in heaven Lord this is where I
[2:17:06] belong I don't want to leave it
[2:17:08] just the comfort
[2:17:10] the peace the joy you know that problem
[2:17:13] that that feeling that our father that
[2:17:15] that will protect me
[2:17:17] that will take care of me it brings
[2:17:19] peace it brings those things and that's
[2:17:20] what God promises us
[2:17:22] so when we broke his law he loves us we
[2:17:25] went our own way he loved us
[2:17:27] when we said leave us alone
[2:17:30] we don't want you around anymore he
[2:17:33] stays around anyway he says I'll never
[2:17:35] leave you nor forsake you
[2:17:37] when we ran he followed
[2:17:39] when we hide he found us
[2:17:42] that's the God I serve that's the God I
[2:17:44] love that's the one I can say Lord
[2:17:45] that's how I that's how I experience you
[2:17:48] Lord Jesus many times in my life I
[2:17:51] wanted to run and hide but Lord you
[2:17:53] never left me
[2:17:54] you never forsook me you never you
[2:17:57] protected me there's so many many things
[2:18:00] that you can take and understand and
[2:18:02] know because God is real
[2:18:05] God is real
[2:18:07] the word is real it's it's a life that
[2:18:10] you can live and I feel sorry for people
[2:18:11] that live it out of out of law out of
[2:18:14] fear you should never fear to live for
[2:18:17] God never you always I have the Liberty
[2:18:20] to be who you are because I believe the
[2:18:23] way you see me Sunday is the way you're
[2:18:24] going to find me Monday
[2:18:26] and Tuesday
[2:18:28] and Wednesday
[2:18:29] and Friday we don't have a church day or
[2:18:33] a church phase
[2:18:34] and a work phase under this no we are
[2:18:37] the same because our father is the same
[2:18:39] yesterday today and forever we should be
[2:18:41] the same yesterday today and forever we
[2:18:44] should never change that's why we can
[2:18:46] call him by the spirit saying Abba
[2:18:48] Father father
[2:18:49] it's a deep deep relationship that we
[2:18:52] can express ourselves to our Lord and
[2:18:54] Savior Jesus Christ and that is what we
[2:18:57] want to say so if you look about your
[2:18:59] own life many times many things happen
[2:19:02] unexplainable things
[2:19:04] the problem we have is most of the
[2:19:07] things that happen to us we've got no
[2:19:08] reason for it
[2:19:10] why did this happen Lord
[2:19:11] why did this happen but there's no
[2:19:13] explanation
[2:19:16] and when you look at that and you start
[2:19:18] to look at it the only thing you can do
[2:19:20] is you should trust the Lord to say that
[2:19:21] all things that happen to me happens for
[2:19:23] good
[2:19:24] the good I cannot see the good I don't
[2:19:26] know how this can be good out of this
[2:19:28] but God cannot lie or rather take myself
[2:19:30] my own situation and say you know what I
[2:19:32] don't understand it but God cannot lie
[2:19:34] he is the same yesterday today and
[2:19:36] forever so I trust him explicitly and
[2:19:39] therefore whatever happens to me I lead
[2:19:41] to learn to trust him
[2:19:43] and many things that happens is
[2:19:45] difficult
[2:19:46] extremely difficult you know it's like
[2:19:49] it's like and God knows how you feel
[2:19:52] when you sorrowful and you want to cry
[2:19:54] you cry before the Lord
[2:19:56] it's better to speak to him the way you
[2:19:58] feel if you're angry and upset tell him
[2:20:02] Lord I feel this way I feel I feel
[2:20:05] you've disappointed
[2:20:07] any character of The Bible like Moses
[2:20:09] you know when I start to talk with God
[2:20:11] and they start to talk like that there
[2:20:13] becomes a real real relationship that
[2:20:16] they talk and God can answer him and
[2:20:18] they come God wants you to express how
[2:20:20] you feel because then God can do
[2:20:23] something for you don't come with a
[2:20:24] smile on your face and say you know all
[2:20:25] is well if all is not well
[2:20:28] it's better to say yes I know God is in
[2:20:30] control but today I am disappointed
[2:20:33] and you go before God and you tell him
[2:20:35] Lord I am disappointed
[2:20:37] because then he can deal with you he can
[2:20:39] work with you he can help you he can
[2:20:40] uplift you and he can he can help you in
[2:20:43] many many different ways
[2:20:45] I have been disappointed many times in
[2:20:48] my life
[2:20:49] even feeling that God disappointed me
[2:20:52] but that's naturally
[2:20:54] the very first time I can relate to you
[2:20:57] I got
[2:20:59] we went
[2:21:00] my sister got
[2:21:02] the word and she repented and she came
[2:21:04] and she visited us on one weekend
[2:21:07] and she told us about the message the
[2:21:08] word the baptism she showed us in the
[2:21:10] Bible and we argue started to argue
[2:21:13] say no ways never ever a prophet in this
[2:21:15] day nothing forget it complete this is
[2:21:17] so wrong and she continues just to
[2:21:20] testify and talk and we argued and we
[2:21:22] argued and I think two weeks later or so
[2:21:25] you know the thing started to make sense
[2:21:27] something started to move
[2:21:29] and you know you because What attracted
[2:21:32] me was I could see it in the Bible
[2:21:34] I could see acts 238 is written there
[2:21:37] and that's what I like because about a
[2:21:39] month before that our Germany or
[2:21:42] Reverend I don't know what you call it
[2:21:43] but our pasta which is from a
[2:21:45] denomination who just came and visit us
[2:21:46] they do house visits
[2:21:48] and he sits and he asks you just a few
[2:21:50] questions
[2:21:52] he says if you die tonight
[2:21:55] do you know where you're going because
[2:21:56] they want to make sure that your
[2:21:58] salvation is certain
[2:22:00] and I said to him yes I know I'm going
[2:22:01] straight to hell
[2:22:03] and he was shocked he looked at me he
[2:22:06] thought I was joking I said no I'm
[2:22:07] serious
[2:22:08] and he took the Bible he showed me
[2:22:10] scriptures if you accept Jesus Christ
[2:22:11] you are safe but he never helped me
[2:22:13] it never changed anything for me I knew
[2:22:15] I had enough in me
[2:22:17] to know that if I die now I am lost
[2:22:20] and I told him I'm lost
[2:22:22] and he had no ability to to bring me to
[2:22:25] a fountain of water
[2:22:26] but never knowing that God was already
[2:22:28] working in my life in my wife's life we
[2:22:31] were starting to hunger and thirst for
[2:22:32] God and we had no idea what was
[2:22:33] happening
[2:22:34] and then you know a few weeks later here
[2:22:37] comes my sister you have Acts 2 38. and
[2:22:40] we fought it and we this but we could
[2:22:42] read it and that was started to pull us
[2:22:44] and we said okay let's go and see the
[2:22:46] past and we're in the car we drove to
[2:22:47] this house we came in we sat in the
[2:22:49] lounge and he opens the Bible
[2:22:52] and he reads Acts 2 38.
[2:22:56] you should be baptized in the name of
[2:22:57] the Lord Jesus Christ when he read that
[2:23:00] my wife jumped up she said she said I
[2:23:02] want to get baptized
[2:23:03] I looked at her I was shocked
[2:23:06] but one scripture
[2:23:08] and she had it she took it she had a
[2:23:10] revelation of it nothing about the
[2:23:12] message nothing about anything further
[2:23:14] one scripture repent and be baptized
[2:23:17] and she says no I'm not going home today
[2:23:19] until I'm baptized
[2:23:21] so she went with her hair that was
[2:23:22] shorter than mine red red ear right here
[2:23:26] right here red everywhere into the pool
[2:23:30] but she came out she went in a center
[2:23:32] and she came out to Saint
[2:23:34] the moment she came out her hair was
[2:23:36] long not physically but by revelation
[2:23:40] your hair can be this long that long the
[2:23:42] moment you accept Jesus Christ and the
[2:23:44] Revelation hit you your hair is long
[2:23:45] because it's a revelation and we went
[2:23:49] home and she was happy and I just said
[2:23:51] no leave me alone
[2:23:53] you can do it but I'm not gonna do it
[2:23:55] because I was scared
[2:23:56] because of what I saw in all the
[2:23:58] churches I saw things in churches
[2:24:00] let me tell you as a boy I sat under the
[2:24:03] chair
[2:24:04] sometimes you had to hide there because
[2:24:05] of how the people were running in the
[2:24:07] church
[2:24:08] and then one day the drummer
[2:24:10] he was sitting by the drums
[2:24:12] and as the Pentecostal would say the
[2:24:14] spirit of the Lord fell
[2:24:16] and he jumped up he ran and he jumped on
[2:24:18] top of the pulpit
[2:24:20] and to me as a young boy
[2:24:22] that impressed me in a way to realize
[2:24:25] man
[2:24:26] what is this you know how does your mind
[2:24:28] cannot understand it but it happened in
[2:24:30] front of you and he jumps up in here and
[2:24:31] the people are running up and down and
[2:24:33] and it was so and that sort of gave me a
[2:24:36] fright
[2:24:37] so I was a bit wary I was a bit careful
[2:24:40] and I went home again and we sat there
[2:24:43] and she was now baptized and I was just
[2:24:46] there and I was studying I was exams and
[2:24:48] there was this and my life was complete
[2:24:50] chaos
[2:24:51] the absolute absolute wrong time to
[2:24:54] serve God
[2:24:56] the worst time of my life
[2:25:00] and I said I remember I sat by my desk
[2:25:02] like this and all of a sudden
[2:25:06] the Lord just says now is your time
[2:25:09] I just got up I walked in there and I
[2:25:11] said I want to get baptized
[2:25:13] we went I got to the pool and I was so
[2:25:16] so thankful I was so happy that when I
[2:25:18] got to the pool there and I came out I
[2:25:20] had a big problem in my life and that
[2:25:22] was smoking
[2:25:25] so happy because I knew that the moment
[2:25:27] I come out of that water the smoking
[2:25:29] would be gone
[2:25:33] I was excited I was above everything
[2:25:36] else that that was something that I was
[2:25:38] excited about because I got many years
[2:25:39] tried to get Deliverance
[2:25:41] and I got out of the pool I was happy I
[2:25:44] was psyched up I was a man and we got in
[2:25:46] the car we drove back it was about an
[2:25:48] hour's drive or maybe a little bit more
[2:25:49] and as I halfway through that smoking
[2:25:52] demon attacked me
[2:25:54] and I started to fight
[2:25:57] I started to resist
[2:25:59] and disappointment took a hold of me
[2:26:02] I tell you
[2:26:04] and the devil started to tell me you
[2:26:06] know what
[2:26:07] there's nothing in this
[2:26:09] God doesn't even delivered you
[2:26:12] what is your problem this is can never
[2:26:14] be true you know how he speaks
[2:26:17] and I had a mind battle and I had a mind
[2:26:19] battling and and I I was just in my mind
[2:26:21] and I was so confused I was really
[2:26:24] confused and I said Lord how does this
[2:26:27] work how What Can I Do Lord what I
[2:26:29] thought I'm gonna be delivered Lord I
[2:26:31] feel disappointed that's what I said to
[2:26:33] him
[2:26:35] and I said Lord if you don't deliver me
[2:26:37] I cannot deliver myself
[2:26:39] and I took that cigarettes and I smoked
[2:26:41] it but I kept it before the Lord I said
[2:26:44] Lord you know I tried I cannot do it you
[2:26:47] have to do it for me Lord you must do it
[2:26:48] for me Lord and I just left it there
[2:26:52] and I hated it but I couldn't deliver
[2:26:54] myself and I just stood there and I and
[2:26:56] I every time I stood there and I and I
[2:26:59] smoked that cigarette I hated it
[2:27:01] but I had no power in myself
[2:27:04] I tried I thought I chewed chappies I
[2:27:07] put stickers I did everything those
[2:27:09] times there was no vaping and stuff like
[2:27:11] that but
[2:27:12] it was terrible and then
[2:27:15] I sat in the home
[2:27:17] and I was busy like I said it was a time
[2:27:19] of great pressure for me studies
[2:27:22] final exams and I was studying studying
[2:27:24] studying
[2:27:26] and all of a sudden I was alone
[2:27:28] the Lord came to me
[2:27:30] and all he said to me is
[2:27:32] now is your time
[2:27:35] I jumped up I'm a Believer for two weeks
[2:27:37] I don't even know proper gospel songs
[2:27:40] so I walked down the passage I thought
[2:27:42] no I'm going to sing to the Lord and I
[2:27:44] made up my own song
[2:27:46] Lord I love you
[2:27:48] appreciate you Lord and I walked down
[2:27:51] the passage to the kitchen I remember I
[2:27:53] turned back and I walked down the
[2:27:55] passage not a big house and I came to
[2:27:57] the bedroom I nailed it to my bed and I
[2:27:59] knelt
[2:28:00] all I prayed was
[2:28:02] Lord
[2:28:04] deliver me
[2:28:05] amen
[2:28:07] and I got up
[2:28:09] and you know
[2:28:10] that feeling
[2:28:13] it just left me
[2:28:14] I had not a desire
[2:28:17] I had no desire I had nothing from there
[2:28:19] I walked away there and my wife got home
[2:28:20] I said the Lord just delivered me
[2:28:22] and after today 30 years later I have
[2:28:25] never ever desired a smoke or anything
[2:28:28] like that in my whole life that's the
[2:28:30] power and that's the relationship you
[2:28:32] have with the Lord just to express
[2:28:33] yourself and say Lord
[2:28:35] he wants you to be real with him don't
[2:28:37] don't be super spiritual don't be super
[2:28:40] high and mighty don't be you know what
[2:28:41] I'm walking on water no just be natural
[2:28:44] speak to him and tell him I have a
[2:28:47] problem Lord I need your deliverance
[2:28:49] Lord I need a God a father
[2:28:52] that can dry the tears from my eyes
[2:28:55] because many times that's why he's such
[2:28:57] a good father when you need a father you
[2:28:59] need a father
[2:29:00] that can embrace you that can lead you
[2:29:03] that can comfort you that can guide you
[2:29:05] and that can bless you in all these
[2:29:07] things that we have a need of so that's
[2:29:09] what God has done for me but that's the
[2:29:10] relationship you need with the Lord to
[2:29:12] go from them to say you know what let's
[2:29:14] go forward and let's go this way and
[2:29:16] that way and this way and that way the
[2:29:18] drinking was easy
[2:29:20] you know we love beer there where we
[2:29:22] come from and so on but now the January
[2:29:24] the school opens
[2:29:26] and here I come with all my friends now
[2:29:28] remember when I saw them last time we
[2:29:30] were still doing all the things
[2:29:32] we were studying together and January
[2:29:35] come we enrolled we go to the to the
[2:29:37] houses and so on and one of the friends
[2:29:39] pulls out a big bottle of of whiskey or
[2:29:42] something
[2:29:43] because that's a tradition
[2:29:45] after enrollment
[2:29:46] we sit down and relax and I said to him
[2:29:49] no I'm not drinking anymore
[2:29:52] I thought it was a joke
[2:29:54] I said no I'm serious the Lord saved me
[2:29:57] and they looked at me looked at one
[2:29:59] another and it became very awkward and I
[2:30:02] told them what the Lord has done for me
[2:30:04] and all of them all of a sudden yes I
[2:30:05] also went to church on Sunday and all of
[2:30:07] this and you know starting to relate
[2:30:08] their things and that was the end of it
[2:30:11] they finished their bottle I went my way
[2:30:13] and so you can just realize the Lord is
[2:30:16] doing wonderful things here wonderful
[2:30:17] things there and if you look at your
[2:30:19] life Journey it's a Miraculous Journey
[2:30:21] it's a journey of love it's a journey of
[2:30:23] Grace it's a journey that he can take
[2:30:26] your situation in the uniqueness that
[2:30:28] you have as an individual
[2:30:30] that's my story and you everyone has got
[2:30:33] a story and every day of your life
[2:30:35] there's a news story
[2:30:37] so if you battle with something there is
[2:30:39] a way if there is a trial a test there
[2:30:41] is an outcome the Lord and the way you
[2:30:44] approach him hallow his name means that
[2:30:46] I honor him I bless him and I see him as
[2:30:48] my father I don't see him as my judge
[2:30:52] I don't see him as he's going to condemn
[2:30:54] me that's why one of the profound
[2:30:55] statements that the prophet make is even
[2:30:57] if he sent me to hell
[2:30:59] I'll serve him
[2:31:01] which means he's not serving him to go
[2:31:03] to heaven
[2:31:04] I'm not serving God to go to heaven I'm
[2:31:07] saving God because I love him
[2:31:09] I'm serving him because I really love
[2:31:11] him
[2:31:12] I'm serving him because I know what he's
[2:31:14] done for me
[2:31:15] I know where I was on my way to and I
[2:31:17] know he turned my direction around I
[2:31:19] know I was lost but now I'm found I know
[2:31:21] I was full fee but today I'm clean by
[2:31:23] his righteousness so all those things
[2:31:25] become real
[2:31:27] so we are no more servants it's
[2:31:28] Galatians says because you are Sons
[2:31:31] God have set forth the spirit of his son
[2:31:33] into your heart's crying Abba Father
[2:31:36] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[2:31:38] a son and if I stand in an heir of God
[2:31:41] through Christ
[2:31:43] is that right
[2:31:44] an heir
[2:31:46] now let me close with this
[2:31:48] I'll profit you know you always save
[2:31:50] when you speak about the prophet
[2:31:52] you can look at me and disagree with me
[2:31:55] but when you read the prophet we all
[2:31:58] relax is that right
[2:32:00] nothing can go wrong
[2:32:03] so he says after God has taken his wife
[2:32:05] and his daughter now I want you to
[2:32:07] understand this is a man under pressure
[2:32:10] this is a man disappointed
[2:32:14] he and he will tell it he is
[2:32:15] disappointed in God
[2:32:19] so it's not a new thing
[2:32:21] but the fact is we don't understand and
[2:32:23] because we don't approach it the right
[2:32:24] way we walk away from there and we think
[2:32:26] we're going to leave God Alone we're
[2:32:28] going to reject the word because God has
[2:32:29] failed us
[2:32:30] but we should always understand that God
[2:32:32] is in control and he knows the best
[2:32:34] we should always have confidence in him
[2:32:36] to say Lord help me in my unique
[2:32:37] situation so now he's under pressure he
[2:32:40] feels neglected imagine how you would
[2:32:42] feel if God takes your husband your
[2:32:44] children your wife whatever around you
[2:32:47] and he just takes them
[2:32:50] and it's God that took them
[2:32:52] you know it's not easy
[2:32:54] and that's where real reality of Life
[2:32:57] comes in
[2:32:58] many many many things happen to us we
[2:33:01] are not isolated we are not exempt we
[2:33:04] are not saved from those things God
[2:33:06] allows it
[2:33:07] we're a very very very specific reason
[2:33:11] but he's in control
[2:33:14] so he says one day I went I was working
[2:33:15] for the public service I clumped up a
[2:33:18] poll early one morning to take off a
[2:33:20] pole meter
[2:33:21] and I was standing there and I was
[2:33:23] singing
[2:33:25] on a hill far away
[2:33:28] stood an Old Rugged Cross
[2:33:31] and I happen to look and as the sun came
[2:33:34] up me hanging there on that pole working
[2:33:35] on these cross arms looked out on the
[2:33:37] side and they looked like my figure a
[2:33:40] wiggling looked like a cross out there
[2:33:42] and I thought oh Christ of God
[2:33:45] so he sees himself as the shadow on the
[2:33:47] pole it looks like somebody hanging on a
[2:33:49] cross
[2:33:50] look brings back memories it brings back
[2:33:52] an emotion he gets stirred
[2:33:54] to a level which is dangerous
[2:34:00] and I thought oh Christ of God
[2:34:03] yes it was my sins that nailed you there
[2:34:05] I'm sorry for what I've done and I I
[2:34:08] said God
[2:34:10] how could you ever put up with a person
[2:34:12] like me
[2:34:14] How Could You Lord
[2:34:16] you broke my heart
[2:34:18] he's not talking to God
[2:34:21] he's telling God straight you
[2:34:23] broke my heart
[2:34:26] that's what I mean when you start to
[2:34:27] talk to God from the depths
[2:34:30] when you tell him
[2:34:31] tell him the Deep secrets
[2:34:35] you know things that bother you things
[2:34:37] that haunt you things that worries you
[2:34:39] things it doesn't matter what that's
[2:34:41] what God wants from every one of his
[2:34:43] children
[2:34:44] to open up and to tell him you don't
[2:34:46] have to tell a person you don't have to
[2:34:47] when you talk to God like that it
[2:34:50] becomes different
[2:34:52] and that's what I encourage people to do
[2:34:54] have a real relationship with Jesus
[2:34:57] Christ with your father like you would
[2:34:58] have with a natural father almost
[2:35:00] because our natural force my father had
[2:35:02] lots of mistakes
[2:35:04] he was a man
[2:35:06] but I loved him
[2:35:08] he could never see the truth but I loved
[2:35:10] him
[2:35:10] and he told me why he rejected the
[2:35:13] message I asked him one day after we all
[2:35:16] got saved I asked him why he says
[2:35:18] because your Prophet is a false prophet
[2:35:19] he said that Saul went to heaven and
[2:35:21] Saul killed himself
[2:35:24] so he had a reason
[2:35:26] and I went home and I prayed I said Lord
[2:35:29] and he gave me the scripture and I read
[2:35:31] it and I went home still knew in the
[2:35:33] Lord and I read it and I said Lord what
[2:35:36] is this about help me Lord I don't know
[2:35:37] how to answer him
[2:35:39] and the Lord said just reach further and
[2:35:41] I continue to read
[2:35:44] and up comes another version another
[2:35:46] relation of uh you know a reference to
[2:35:49] what happened
[2:35:50] so the first one says Saul fell on his
[2:35:52] thought and he died that's where my
[2:35:54] father got stuck and the next one said
[2:35:55] so felony Sword and the Philistine came
[2:35:58] past and he asked the Philistine cut off
[2:35:59] my head
[2:36:01] man I was so happy I picked up the phone
[2:36:03] I phoned my father I said I found your
[2:36:05] answer
[2:36:07] phone me back
[2:36:10] okay he never phoned me back
[2:36:12] because he could not believe it there
[2:36:14] was nothing in him to believe it and
[2:36:16] when you start to realize you cannot
[2:36:18] make somebody a Believer you cannot
[2:36:20] change somebody that's not a Believer
[2:36:22] you must be gracious and kind and big
[2:36:24] enough to know Lord your seed cannot but
[2:36:26] receive your word but if somebody is not
[2:36:29] a Believer let me also love them because
[2:36:31] you love the whole world
[2:36:33] the Bible says he died for every sin
[2:36:34] that was ever committed the fact that
[2:36:36] you don't accept it that's the problem
[2:36:38] he will not die again but he has already
[2:36:40] died
[2:36:42] you broke my heart you grant me down but
[2:36:45] what can I do
[2:36:47] he's telling the Lord I am helpless
[2:36:50] I'm not in control of the situation the
[2:36:53] moment you realize you are not in
[2:36:54] control of life that's the time that God
[2:36:56] can start to help you you might make
[2:36:59] your own plans and God will cut them all
[2:37:01] off
[2:37:02] your time release on the arm of Flesh
[2:37:04] and God will take the arm off
[2:37:06] because he wants you to be completely
[2:37:08] 100 depend upon him he wants you to
[2:37:11] understand that he is God and he is in
[2:37:13] control that you cannot do anything of
[2:37:15] yourself
[2:37:16] you cannot change the color of your hair
[2:37:18] you cannot change the statue that you
[2:37:21] are you cannot make yourself longer or
[2:37:22] shorter you cannot do anything like that
[2:37:25] that's the way God brought you
[2:37:28] and I got real nervous
[2:37:31] now that's where the problem comes in
[2:37:34] and I had a pair of rubber gloves
[2:37:37] many of your linemen know 2300 running
[2:37:40] right by me the primary line and I
[2:37:42] thought Lucia I can lay my hand on that
[2:37:45] primary and in one minute's time I'll be
[2:37:48] with Sharon
[2:37:50] so what is he saying he's seeing a way
[2:37:51] out
[2:37:53] he's seeing a way out of disappointment
[2:37:55] a way out of his heart Brokenness he's
[2:37:58] saying if I can just take off this love
[2:38:00] and touch the line I'm finished all over
[2:38:05] amen
[2:38:07] and I jerked my glove off and I said God
[2:38:09] I've lost my mind or something and I
[2:38:11] said Sherry honey I can't stand it no
[2:38:14] more Daddy is coming home
[2:38:17] and I look at that line that will break
[2:38:19] every bone in my body
[2:38:22] and I say it now this is the part where
[2:38:25] he starts to pray
[2:38:27] even in the point
[2:38:28] of complete disappointment
[2:38:31] of nervousness of a point where he has
[2:38:35] lost all hope he is feeling deserted he
[2:38:38] is you know that that the lowest of the
[2:38:41] low
[2:38:42] and he's now going to take his own life
[2:38:43] his land is off he's busy reaching out
[2:38:45] he starts to pray and what does he pray
[2:38:48] the best prayer he can ever pray
[2:38:51] Our Father
[2:38:54] Who Art in Heaven
[2:38:56] Hallowed be thy name
[2:38:59] and the first thing you know I was
[2:39:00] sitting down on the ground I don't know
[2:39:03] Jazzy spraying reaching out the next
[2:39:05] moment he wakes up on the floor
[2:39:07] God stepped in
[2:39:09] I believe that that gift hadn't been
[2:39:12] foreordained
[2:39:13] that have been the end of brother
[2:39:15] Branham right there that's what he says
[2:39:18] but God had something else to do
[2:39:20] he had to grind that heart out and let
[2:39:23] him know let me know that he's the one
[2:39:25] who rules and Reigns
[2:39:27] he was grinding him
[2:39:30] to telling the prophet I am the ruler
[2:39:32] I reign
[2:39:34] trust me trust me look upon me I know
[2:39:38] it's difficult I know but trust me
[2:39:41] and now he gets off from there now
[2:39:43] imagine this happened to you now he goes
[2:39:45] home
[2:39:46] and in he walks into his home and what
[2:39:49] happens the whole process start over
[2:39:51] again
[2:39:53] he says I went into the house and the
[2:39:55] first letter I looked at When Miss
[2:39:57] Sharon Rose Brenham 80 cents Christmas
[2:39:59] saving oh my it was all over again
[2:40:03] so the what which means you know when
[2:40:05] you when you overcome something it's not
[2:40:07] the end of it
[2:40:09] tomorrow you'll have to overcome again
[2:40:12] and again and again overcoming has
[2:40:15] become a natural part of your life you
[2:40:17] must know every day of my life I need to
[2:40:19] overcome something because that's part
[2:40:21] of God's plan for me
[2:40:24] I remember one day brother came to me
[2:40:25] and and it was so strange to me he said
[2:40:29] brother Hunters please pray for me
[2:40:32] that the Lord just takes these tests and
[2:40:34] trials away from me
[2:40:36] you know it was a strange thing and it
[2:40:38] was it was very serious so I can't take
[2:40:41] it anymore
[2:40:43] and I can't remember if we prayed or not
[2:40:46] or so but afterwards looking back
[2:40:49] all of a sudden his test and trials were
[2:40:51] gone
[2:40:52] and he left the message
[2:40:54] he left the Lord
[2:40:55] and he's in the world
[2:40:57] and I looked at that and I said Lord
[2:41:00] please give me a test and a trial just
[2:41:03] let me always be know that I am I am
[2:41:06] dependent upon your grace Lord let it
[2:41:08] never be my own power or my own
[2:41:09] salvation or my own Holiness not I've
[2:41:11] got no Holiness but your holiness
[2:41:15] so it's dangerous when you ask those
[2:41:17] kind of things
[2:41:18] it can become very dangerous
[2:41:21] he says so I went and I knelt on the
[2:41:23] floor and I started crying
[2:41:25] and I said God please have mercy upon me
[2:41:28] I'll take my own life
[2:41:30] I'd been a warden in the room at a gun
[2:41:31] and I went into this gun and I put the
[2:41:33] shells in it and I pulled the hammer
[2:41:35] back on the gun and I said Lord I have
[2:41:37] gone wild
[2:41:38] I don't know I was out of my head I put
[2:41:40] it up beside my head like this
[2:41:43] now can you imagine he's just just just
[2:41:45] went through him through a supernatural
[2:41:47] deliverance and let's say a few hours
[2:41:50] later he's back in the same situation
[2:41:53] you know your life is a journey you'll
[2:41:55] be one day on top of the mountain but
[2:41:57] the next day you'll be in the valley
[2:41:58] and the next day you'll be a mountain
[2:42:00] and the next day of the valley when
[2:42:01] you're in the valley trust the Lord like
[2:42:04] you trust him on the mountain it is the
[2:42:06] same God it is a journey he is the god
[2:42:08] if the sun is shining he's God if
[2:42:10] there's cloudiness and storms he's still
[2:42:12] God trust him unconditionally but too
[2:42:15] many people want to say I can only trust
[2:42:17] him when the sun is shining
[2:42:19] we trust him does not matter what
[2:42:21] happens
[2:42:23] if he grinds you you trust him
[2:42:25] and let me tell you he is gonna grind
[2:42:27] you
[2:42:28] if you are seed of God he's gonna grind
[2:42:31] you he's not going to spare you because
[2:42:33] he loves you
[2:42:35] he loves you so much that he will allow
[2:42:37] these things to happen that is so
[2:42:38] difficult to Bear but he says I'll never
[2:42:41] leave you I'll carry it with you my son
[2:42:43] my daughter I'll never leave you I'll
[2:42:45] never give you something that you cannot
[2:42:47] bear
[2:42:48] those are scriptures that you must just
[2:42:50] take and say Lord
[2:42:53] when you grind when these things happen
[2:42:55] Lord I trust you
[2:42:57] somewhere there must be something for me
[2:43:00] and he puts the gun besides he says I
[2:43:03] put the gun beside my head like this and
[2:43:04] I said now he prays again
[2:43:07] Our Father
[2:43:08] Who Art in Heaven
[2:43:10] Hallowed be thy name
[2:43:13] and I squeezed the hammer but it
[2:43:15] wouldn't fall
[2:43:16] and I said Lord I can't even take my own
[2:43:18] life
[2:43:20] I threw the gun down and it shot all
[2:43:22] through the room
[2:43:23] and I said God why I've gone crazy I've
[2:43:26] lost my mind
[2:43:29] amen
[2:43:32] and he stood up there
[2:43:35] and he starts to realize
[2:43:38] but when you look at it in closing
[2:43:41] when he says Hallowed be your name
[2:43:44] it means glorify your name
[2:43:47] bring honor to your name
[2:43:49] and the only people that can bring honor
[2:43:51] to God's name
[2:43:52] is the believer
[2:43:54] because nobody else is going to honor
[2:43:56] God's name
[2:43:57] so when you pray that prayer when the
[2:43:59] prophet prayed that prayer him taking
[2:44:01] his life could never honor God's name
[2:44:04] never
[2:44:05] him destroying the the gift of God could
[2:44:08] never bring glory to God's name
[2:44:10] so God is is dedicated he's committed
[2:44:14] that your life will bring glory to his
[2:44:16] name
[2:44:16] so if you're in trouble and you don't
[2:44:18] know what to do just pray and say Lord
[2:44:20] let my life be allowing be a
[2:44:22] glorification to Your Name Lord let my
[2:44:25] life be in a true expression
[2:44:27] and God will lift you up God will do it
[2:44:29] because your self cannot do it
[2:44:31] but your life should always bring glory
[2:44:33] to God
[2:44:34] and that is the Saving Grace that's why
[2:44:37] God keeps us because there is a group of
[2:44:39] people that has to honor him that has to
[2:44:41] bless him that has to worship Him in
[2:44:43] spirit and in truth does not mother
[2:44:45] unconditionally
[2:44:49] so when you're in trouble
[2:44:51] just pray
[2:44:52] so Our Father Who Art in Heaven
[2:44:55] Hallowed Be Your Name let my life
[2:44:57] bring honor to Your Name Lord I can't do
[2:44:59] it I'm weak that's why Paul says when
[2:45:02] I'm weak he becomes strong
[2:45:04] when I can't do it he can do it through
[2:45:06] me when I don't know what to do he still
[2:45:08] knows what to do
[2:45:10] but our Prophet was desperate
[2:45:12] and he prayed the perfect prayer
[2:45:15] and when it every time he comes to that
[2:45:18] Hallowed be your name
[2:45:19] that's where God stepped in
[2:45:21] because God will not allow he cannot
[2:45:24] allow he would never allow so he's
[2:45:27] zealous over you
[2:45:29] he will protect you
[2:45:31] he will keep you that's not I don't care
[2:45:33] what what the economics does I don't
[2:45:35] care what happens I don't care what laws
[2:45:37] they pass I don't care how difficult it
[2:45:39] becomes it's got nothing to do with it
[2:45:41] I'm not looking to myself I'm not
[2:45:43] looking to a natural man-made heaven I'm
[2:45:45] looking to God and to say Lord if you
[2:45:48] tarry it's going to become more
[2:45:49] difficult and if you tarry longer Lord I
[2:45:51] don't know how many will be left but
[2:45:52] Lord you said Hallowed be your name and
[2:45:54] there must be people on the face of the
[2:45:55] Earth that fulfill that scripture Lord
[2:45:57] and Lord let it be me today Lord let it
[2:45:59] be me that my life can bring a glory and
[2:46:02] a testimony and an expression of love
[2:46:04] and grace to your name
[2:46:06] that's what God wants from us if we have
[2:46:08] that attitude and that approach and that
[2:46:11] commitment to say Lord
[2:46:13] that's why I'm here to glorify your name
[2:46:16] take my situation change it make it
[2:46:20] different I can't do it Lord I've tried
[2:46:22] many times but lord it's in your hands
[2:46:24] may you just look upon me Lord
[2:46:27] and I can promise you God will do it
[2:46:29] because it's not about you anymore then
[2:46:31] it's about his name you have linked
[2:46:34] yourself to his name and he steps on the
[2:46:36] scene and he changes the situation
[2:46:38] because of his name because of what he
[2:46:41] has promised this I'll never leave you
[2:46:43] I'll never forsake you but I'll be with
[2:46:46] you even in you till the end of time
[2:46:50] imagine
[2:46:52] unconditional it's nothing to do with
[2:46:54] what you do don't do it's unconditional
[2:46:58] how he saved you how he kept you How He
[2:47:00] blesses you because of the Halloween
[2:47:03] the glorification of his name the
[2:47:07] blessing of his name God is zealous over
[2:47:10] his name and he's zealous over you
[2:47:14] he will take care of you in a beautiful
[2:47:17] way
[2:47:18] amen let's bow our heads
[2:47:32] if you have a need this morning you can
[2:47:34] raise your hand to the Lord say Lord
[2:47:36] remember me
[2:47:39] eye Lord
[2:47:41] maybe has been disappointed I have
[2:47:45] things upon my heart
[2:47:48] and I need to just speak to you about it

[2:47:54] father as we bow our heads in your
[2:47:56] presence

[2:48:00] that we can call you our heavenly father
[2:48:03] and that we can address you Lord in this
[2:48:06] way as family
[2:48:08] as the redeemed
[2:48:10] and when we look at these things a lot
[2:48:12] these scriptures and things that happen
[2:48:14] in our own lives and to our prophet
[2:48:17] father we understand that there's a plan
[2:48:19] there's a plan of life
[2:48:22] there's a Plan of Redemption
[2:48:24] there's a plan that you are perfecting
[2:48:26] us oh God
[2:48:27] and that you can make us perfect in all
[2:48:29] ways O Lord

[2:48:48] you are in control
[2:48:49] that Lord when you grind us down it's
[2:48:52] because you love us when you build us up
[2:48:54] again we are more perfect for thee into
[2:48:57] thy image
[2:48:59] because Lord you have never purposed in
[2:49:01] your heart to destroy us
[2:49:02] to humiliate us
[2:49:05] or let us be defeated
[2:49:08] but you said there will be a bride and

[2:49:39] May the hungry come and feed our father
[2:49:41] to get their souls quenched we commit
[2:49:44] ourselves to the Lord we commit our
[2:49:46] needs to thee and we pray that you will
[2:49:47] bless us father
[2:49:49] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[2:49:53] amen let's stand as the musicians come I
[2:49:55] don't know if you know that song in his
[2:49:57] time
[2:49:59] in his time
[2:50:00] you know God's time is perfect
[2:50:04] when I sing this song to me
[2:50:07] if I look what I was and what I am today
[2:50:09] and where God is taking me I I am
[2:50:11] thankful that God takes time
[2:50:14] you know when you come into the word you
[2:50:16] think
[2:50:17] it's gonna be quick and easy
[2:50:20] but over time you realize no God's got
[2:50:22] time
[2:50:24] we went through the year 2000 where
[2:50:26] there was prophesied the Lord is coming
[2:50:29] and you go through different phases of
[2:50:31] life where people make predictions and
[2:50:33] and all kinds of things and
[2:50:35] and that's the human nature
[2:50:38] but in his time he will come
[2:50:42] but in his time he will make all things
[2:50:44] beautiful
[2:50:46] you know when I see that that that makes
[2:50:48] me happy
[2:50:50] to know that God is busy making me
[2:50:52] beautiful
[2:50:53] I'm not there yet but something is
[2:50:55] happening
[2:50:56] and I want to give him more time I want
[2:50:58] to give him time to say Lord in your
[2:51:01] time
[2:51:02] make me that image Lord in your time
[2:51:05] work with me Lord don't forget about me

[2:51:25] look at your life where you come from
[2:51:26] where you are today and where God is
[2:51:28] taking you that's why we should always
[2:51:30] have time for one another always have
[2:51:32] Grace for somebody else
[2:51:34] always look at it and say Lord I was
[2:51:36] also there was Lord it's by your grace
[2:51:38] that I've moved a little bit further
