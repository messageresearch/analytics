Victory in battle I'm going to preach about some soldiers tonight and I wear soldiers and it was so perfect when our brother started off and said I'm a soldier I thought thank you Lord I needed that tonight so God bless you brother for just yielding and singing that song tonight and pressing through amen because that's what a soldier does as he presses through the battle amen we don't quit we don't give up we press through the battle amen so just appreciate that brother thank you amen if you'll turn with me in your Bibles tonight I want us to just relax I don't really want to preach to you I want to just pretend we're sitting in brother always living room with the young people so I want the young people to just relax this evening if you want to come closer you can come fill up the rows here in the front and come join me in the battle in The Fray so to speak amen so feel free to do so but I want you to just feel relaxed this evening and just enjoy the presence of the Lord tonight if we haven't come here to waste our time we haven't gathered in vain we've come to draw something out of the word and so I might interact with you a little bit this evening and and so forth I don't bite and so you know there's no wrong answers or anything like that but I encourage you to just enjoy the service tonight and pull on the word and and we'll see what the Lord has for us so we're going to speak on the subject victory in battle as you can see the the picture up there I mean they're they're in battle array amen you know I I get excited you know because if you look at those soldiers up there you know they've got weapons and and they and you can tell which country they come from which country do they come from somebody Rome right they're Romans right so we see that they're Romans how can we tell them that they're Romans yeah the headgear what else how can we tell the Romans right they're uniform their Shields they're the way they're dressed right easily right right quick we can tell who they are which side they're on you know we can maybe see a little bit of who they're fighting over there but right away we can tell who they are you know we can we can see which side of the battle you're on by by your the way you look outward appearance and we can see the kind of weapons they use and even Paul you know when when he's talking about fighting the good fight of faith and you know he was talking about a Roman sword and you see those Roman swords are short and they're shorter than the enemy swords because the Romans wanted to get into close combat they wanted to draw the enemy right in so when Paul was thinking about soldiers he was he was talking about getting right in the enemy's face amen not not being afraid of the enemy but I love this this picture because you know the Romans lines are tight amen amen that's a good picture huh everyone in their posts of Duty everyone's standing shoulder to shoulder going into the battle everyone with the right equipment how many hairs got their sword tonight now we've been equipped for the battle today amen so God's dressed us he's equipped us and he he has he has has told us how to fight the enemy so we're going to look at these things a little bit tonight Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 11. tells us if you can read this with me tonight Ephesians 6 and 11. says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places oh boy we've been called to call to a battle I don't know if any of you realize this but we're in a we're in the in the heat of a battle wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that's that's the word for us tonight take on take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand amen let's bow our heads one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we so appreciate your word and it encourages us and it strengthen strengthens us we just anoint the word tonight Lord and speak to our hearts father as as we just Lord turn to you now we yield ourselves to you father Lord move in our midst tonight Lord and strengthen us in your word in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have receipts so already in the word here we can see that we are in a battle how many hearers has realized that we're in a battle amen that's right so but you know we can see that we're in a battle we're we're not just in a battle we're we're in an epic battle we're in one of the greatest battles ever fought we are right in the very end of the Gentile dispensation everybody understand that right we're at the very end of the Gentile dispensation which means every every side is throwing everything they've got into it you know the enemy is throwing everything he's got into it you know he's he's gotten really smart you know he's gotten really slick you know in in the in the medieval times when we think of even the the days when they used to take uh Christians and burn them at the stake you know their battles were very different than ours you know they were short quick battles you know they had made a decision were taken to the arena and put to death but you know it seems like our our battle seems to just kind of drag on anybody ever notice that you know our battle seems to be in a battle of endurance it seems to be a battle of social aspects and principles and and doctrines and Winds of doctrines and all kinds of movements and and sicknesses and all you know it's it's a it's a it's a time of great pressure on the believer and that pressure is to do what what why do you think the enemy is is putting pressure on and putting pressure on and putting pressure on why does the enemy do that is trying to kill us very good brother amen somebody knows what's going on out there and he's trying to kill us right so he's he's he puts pressure on and pressure on and what is he doing he's finding weak spots in the line you know and then you'll you'll find a you know there's a weak one in the in the line there and then they'll start to focus in on that little area there and and start to try and break through the lines and you know they just keep putting pressure on and then they've got arrows flying overhead and they've got spearmen in the front you know pushing through and then they've got rocks and then they're pouring boiling water on you and all kinds of things now I might be talking about boiling water and rocks and Spears but you know what these are these are you know Facebook social media movies music what are some of the things that the enemy is throwing at us what are some of his weapons today peer pressure peer pressure and peer pressure right both of them right right our friends can can put pressure on us how how do our friends put pressure on us what are some of the ways that our friends put pressure on us say that again yeah try and influence us now this can be at work this can be at school right just every day you know oh why do you always have to have long hair and and you know it's it's why why do you always wearing a skirt and you know it's just this constant in and out and even the brothers why don't you come drink with us after work today you know we're we're all friends we're co-workers and you know people are starting to talk about you maybe you don't like us you know they start to say little things and you know I used to play rugby and that was the thing you know is to go drink with the boys and you know they start to put pressure on you because if you don't come drink with us you're not really part of our team so now you got a decision to make now these are these you know we we start with easy battles in our life we start with the the little things and then we move up into bigger things you know it's easy sometimes at school it's very black and white you can see you know oh my goodness you know smoking and drinking and ah you know even those things we can overcome those things in school and but then we get into even Church life huh or maybe it's just in Canada maybe I should just preach a different sermons you know maybe you guys don't have these battles but you know let me just go through some of these things tonight you know we can go into even Church Life and there's pressures in church life and things maybe doesn't isn't going the way you you want them to go or maybe you're disappointed or maybe something happens right but what is that we've got to recognize that we're fighting an enemy right and he's going to use not just uh you know co-workers and our friends at school or rugby mates or or something like that or you know he's not gonna you know he's gonna move closer to home closer to home why because he's continually putting pressure on and putting pressure on right oh my goodness hey I love talking about about our weapons of our Warfare amen because we are we're on The Winning Side we can't lose this battle but it's so good for us to look at the tactics of the enemy so that we can overcome you know we want to overcome and we shouldn't be afraid to talk about the you know what the enemy's doing out there and how we're going to overcome him and that Daddy gets his family around it after a long hard day and and he says you know how was your day and the kids maybe talk about something that happened at school and then we fortify one another you know that's why we go to church to glean the word to you know faith comes by hearing right that's that's that's us gleaning so we can fight our enemy better every day right amen so if we fight a real enemy he's real and it can sometimes come through our families and come through churches it can come through uh our church friends and or school friends or co-workers and there's pressure in our life so we need to understand that that we are wrestling not just against flesh and blood you know we could be we could see that's oh that's this brother is doing this or or this friend is doing this or or this musician didn't shake my hand or you know whatever right it looks like flesh and blood that that looks like the enemy but my brother and sister we need to look deeper than those things you see it's it's in a spirit Realm right and you know what it helps my brother and sister to see things that way that when something happens in your life remember you're fighting a devil okay and sometimes it might it might come through somebody you know but remember at the end of the day it's a devil right we're not fighting each other we're fighting the devil amen You Know The Enemy will do that sometimes you'll come in dressed looking like a friend or you'll come in and you'll spy or maybe come in at night time to cause confusion you know we see even these things in in the in Bible stories you know how that at night they did things and you know it comes in dressed like the enemy tries to do what bring deception and confusion right so but here here's the important thing that that God is telling us that we are to take the whole armor of God in other words he's made preparation for these things he has given us something it's already there it's in the Armory all we have to do tonight is go into the Armory and take possession of all the equipment that he's given to us he says take take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand the in the evil day and having done all to stand I feel like we are you know how many here believes the Rapture is right here I mean we know the Rapture is happening but the Rapture is is right here amen I feel like we're going to take just another step and we're we're going to be out of here so we I mean how many more battles have we got left you know I started thinking of it like this the other day and I thought you know if we knew how many Sundays we had left of services yes you know even covet has kind of taught us that right that you know they might only be you know 10 Sundays left can you imagine if we knew that that the Rapture was going to happen 10 Sundays from now what we would do in our services how's different our services would be right because why we want to be ready we want to fight a good fight you know I look across this room tonight and I would say that we're probably all in agreement that we want to fight a good fight right uh what I don't want to lose right I want to win and I want to know that what I'm doing is is pleasing to the Lord and I want to know that what I'm doing is working right you know we don't want to do stuff in our homes and and and find out one day well that wasn't you know that wasn't going to work and then find out that you messed everything up and you know legalism can do that so God has given us specific weapons that are that will bring Victory the weapons that God gives us brings Victory amen therefore are good they're for edification they're to strengthen us he's a god of peace and kindness and love so what God does for us is not to hurt us but to give us strength is to bring victory in our life amen his weapons are not to break us down and not to and and not to for us to one day find out that it didn't work or it wasn't you know we weren't going to win no matter what we did no God has called us to be Overcomers in this day so an army when he plants a war you know an army does not uh plan a war and plan on being defeated you know they they plan on on winning how many how many hearers played Sports you know just it's okay it's safe how many years played sports right I see some of you have some are honest some are not honest see there's battles going on right now right do I raise my hand do I not raise my hand is this a trick question this is not a trick question well that already isn't here it's okay right so so we played Sports and you know I don't remember anybody ever playing a sport and planning on losing right right we run the race to win we play the game to win right and that's good that's what you want to be doing we want to be victorious when you start a a family or you start a a relationship with someone even those things you want you plan on winning you plan on being successful when you start a new career all those things my brother sister is pretty simple right we want to be successful but why not in our Christian walk also you know wake up in the morning and pray a prayer like Lord I want to be pleasing Lord I want to be successful in my Christian walk I want I want your will to be my will I want to defeat the enemy at every turn today Lord I I Lay My Life down in your hands let me be victorious today instead of letting you know going through the same motions of depression or anxiety or fear or even sickness but Lord today let me overcome that today Lord I plan on being successful today I plan on being Victorious and to do that we've got to we've got to have the you've got to make a decision you know it comes down to that right you you've got to make a decision that I want to be successful I want to be victorious and our brother was singing Jesus Christ came he is the Victorious one he is the Overcomer so Lord lead me through my day today I need a general I need I need a captain amen the captain of the host of the Lord oh my I'm trying not to preach tonight I want to do more just talk to you a little bit this evening but amen it talks you know it feels good to talk about these things so to to be victorious in the battle we must understand our enemy we must understand the enemy's tactics to overcome them you know it's no no use that we go into the battle today with swords and Spears uh you know why not because the enemies using machine guns you know it would be a very sad uh day for us we showed up there were Spears if we have an end time Prophet we have musicians we have mother mothers that pray we've got all everyone in their position you know that was the biggest thing in Nehemiah restoring the walls of Jerusalem was that every family worked on their portion of the wall and that they weren't distracted with what the other ones were doing right everyone had their portion to play you know they had a map once up in the church and then I showed how that you know the one gate you know everyone was was building a gate or a piece of a wall and and at one side it was the the horse gate you know that's where all the horses went in and out and the Stables were and another place was was you know where the where where the where the and another place was was you know where the where the where the food was the food gate and you know so everyone had a very specific part in the kingdom of God and you know there was a dung gate you know that there was a garbage gate you know there were some gates that were not as glorious as the other ones right but it was essential if those Gates weren't operating and if they weren't uh in the right place and somebody wasn't restoring them guess what the whole city would fall down because you gotta have have all those things operating you know we might feel Lord my part is so little but you know my brother and sister God has put every enemy under his feet so if you're the little toe in the kingdom of God the enemy is still under your feet amen so don't underestimate who you are and the position God has placed you in so God has for this day I'm just reading a line here from The Prophet's message God has selected his soldiers for this day that's all of us I'm not talking about just pastors and evangelists and you know these things that we lift up like that and that's fine but my brother and sister I'm talking about all of us each and every one of us God has selected for this end time and you know he saw what the enemy would do he saw the the great wicked and evil day that we would live in my brother and sister he he also saw who he was placing here and he knew it would be enough to withstand to to shine to have a testimony in the darkest dismal day he picked you and I no one else is coming he picked you and I to defeat the enemy in this day wow so this great conflict we know began in heaven between Michael and his and his angels and Lucifer and his his followers Lucifer rising up against God thinking that he would be lifted higher than he he rose up against the word and God's order you see in God how did God deal with him there how did God deal with Lucifer there remember this is the very first battle right there he cast them out so even today we have the same process we cast out the devil as the Devil comes and what does he do he raises himself higher than the word right so he'll come in sickness when God has said that by his stripes we were healed how many believes that tonight by stripes we were healed right we're just looking at some of our our weapons in our Arsenal right he said that by his stripes we were healed then the enemy Rises up above the word right isn't that what he's doing rising up above the word but we have a right to cast him out if you resist the devil he shall flee amen how do we resist him how do we overcome him right very simply tonight Jesus Christ Our Champion showed us how to resist him I know this sounds so simple tonight right but it really is how did he resist him it's written it's written devil right it's written and he had to do it three times but we know the Battleground did not end there I'm just going to go through this really quickly here the Battleground did not end there the Battleground moved down to earth okay now God wasn't taken off guard when this happened God knew God knew the end from the beginning he knows the end from the beginning he he orchestrated the whole thing he allowed all this to happen why because he was he wants to be victorious in battle amen he wants to prove his people his attributes he wants to show what we're made of Amen just like he did with job it wasn't God wasn't teasing job God wasn't trying to be cruel or anything like that it wasn't a social experiment with God no God wanted to draw nigh unto job he wanted job to know what his relationship was all about that he was strong enough that that his grace was sufficient even in those times you know so God God knows what he's doing he's got a purpose he's got a battle plan and he doesn't plan on losing amen so when God says have he considered my servant you know put your name there tonight God has a battle plan he he's he's orchestrated it so that even if you're one against a thousand you're going to win God has God has that kind of confidence in US you see both sides have to meet on a common Battlefield there's a chosen Battlefield and you can see it in in many of the wars both generals would try and flex and and maneuver and try and outmaneuver the other one why it's all about positioning on the battlefield but eventually they meet on a battlefield and we can go to the battlefield in heaven we can go to Battlefield in the Garden of Eden so we can see how both sides you know Evil versus good and God versus Satan all these things we can go to all the different battlefields and see how they tried to outmaneuver each other to get to a certain point to to strike at the other one but we see how that everything is in perfect harmony when it comes to the word God is always in perfect harmony with his word you know Jesus Christ when he came he could have called Angels out of heaven and and they could have removed him from the cross or from the Roman uh grip you know he could have done all those things but what did he do he was in harmony with the word all the time I can only do it my father shows me so say for us it's so important that when we go into our battles or we we find ourselves in Conflict find ourselves in harmony with the word you see sometimes we want to jump and and oh this would be an easier way let's do things this way when God is laid out for us how we do things amen you know there's simple things and I can I'll just say it tonight but if you want to see victory in your life just line yourself up with a word seek ye first the kingdom of God you might think what does God need with my money you know what does tithing got to do with anything huh you see we're just lining up with a word I mean what is church what does going to church have to do with anything we're lining up with the word right we're finding ourselves in our position amen God has orchestrated all these things he's got an economy for all these things amen he's got a purpose so there's it's important to be in harmony with a general's instructions we can talk about Eve in the Garden of Eden but I think we we know that story well tonight how the enemy moved in trying to get her out of her position and try to get her off the word try to get her out of harmony with the word just a little thing here and a little thing there just subtly constantly trying to move her off the word right so where was the Battleground for for Eve for Eve it was right there in her mind you know so we started to see this pattern all throughout the scriptures where it always comes down to this decision or something that happens in the mind you know first what happened she saw him and then she stopped long enough for him to say something right you see we can see something we can be distracted and pulled aside by something and what's the first thing that happens is we stop long enough to to listen you know an email might come in you see the email so these are the gates I'm talking about our Warfare right this is our battle you know this we fight against principalities and Powers right so the enemy sends an email you know what happens we see the email we we're not sure where that email came from or maybe we know where that email came from but curiosity eh curiosity killed the cat right so curiosity causes us to open the email right you know where this is leading already but you open the email and there's something negative in there or something breaking down your faith or just whatever I mean you you can fill in the blanks tonight but now you've opened up and as soon as you've opened up that that email now the mind has been activated right because now you start reading now memories kick in reasoning kicks in the mind has been activated you've opened a door in your mind you know my brother and sister I've I've opened emails and it's like wow I wish I never read that you know I walked right into this and then you have that negative thought or that feeling you've got this feeling with you all week you just feel uncomfortable you know I did I wish I didn't know that or there was a struggle that you're facing or maybe something happened but you know it affects you right it affects you and some of those things can get really dark they can really affect your walk with the Lord they can discourage you maybe maybe it was a song may you read listen to music and that music drives you into depression you know or watching movies huh you can it can really mess with your mind but you open the door and this is really where Eve made her mistake as she opened the door right and it started to work not just in her eyesight but it starts to work in the next level right what's the enemy doing is pushing in right he's breaking he's broken through the first gate which is the outer Gates right and then he now he's in the inside Gates he's in the spirit realm what is he doing he's he's breaking his way in in through those Gates you need to realize that I'm under siege I'm going to Siege this is not just an email anymore this is not just about this person anymore it's not just about this habit of mine or whatever it might be right there's a devil and he's trying to kill you so where really is this Battleground you know the prophet told us the greatest battle ever fought is where in the mind in our minds you know let's just settle this once and for all right there's nothing wrong with God amen there's nothing wrong with God there's nothing wrong with his word you believe this word amen there's nothing wrong with the word there's nothing wrong with the power of God with the Holy Ghost with his promises amen so it's all in our mind we gotta we gotta fight this thing every day all the time we're fighting our minds there's a battle taking place right here we also find out in this moment and we could we could preach sermons on this literally that right in this moment in her mind that there is a free moral agency also working right you see if we didn't have free moral agency we wouldn't really have a battle would we God would just pull us drag us through life and then set us up for eternity and there would be no character but he gave us free moral agency so that we can have character amen he didn't give us free moral agency to see if we would make it he knows we would make it because he knows the end from the beginning he knows what decisions we would make but so he gave us free moral agency someone asked me once he says how does that work you know we have free moral agency and yet I'm predestinated how does that work anybody here ever thought about that I see there's a few here yeah right well let me ask you this question I'll answer the question with a question whose will is stronger your free moral agency or God's will I'll just leave that with you but think about that huh God's will to save you is stronger than your free moral agency you know we talk about our hearts and and and if our hearts condemn us and all these kinds of things but you know there's another scripture it's also written God Is Bigger than our heart he's greater than a heart praise the Lord all right well that's for another time so we see how this battle is taking place in Eve's mind right she she was conflicted she had free moral agency agency she could choose she had the ability to make a decision which tells me that we're all in the same place tonight we all can make decisions hmm Prophet says that the battle raged when Eve opened her mind to listen to her reasonings that is the chosen Battleground for today why else do we have all the social media why else do we have all the streaming and access to to whatever we have it's all about the mind the eye gate the ears the mind we're finding a real battle you know you can find out anything about the message by just typing it in searching it out and still know absolutely nothing about the message because all that's ever happened is intellectual conception but never really allowing that word to come from your mind into your heart never really knowing the author amen so there's a real battle up here there's a lot of intellectualism there's a lot of people that can talk about the quotes talk about the message they can talk about all the the scriptures and put things together in conspiracies and you know they just they just know how to talk about the Mysteries and all those things but the life doesn't line up you can't they just can't come to church they just can't seem to live a Victorious Life can't seem to overcome things in their life and you know that the family is a mess you know and things just seem to break down and break down and you got to ask yourself why is this person not victorious in battle right so there's three rounds of of men and there's a scripture for this first Thessalonians 5 23 it says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so there's three Realms of many as we've heard the prophet talk taught us and here we find the scripture where it's where God is praying I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless that's a powerful prayer you know that's that's can you imagine that this flesh be blameless God you know as a prayer Lord is sanctify me wash me you know because this flesh can can have scars you know there are irreversible things that you can do like for instance to give you an easy example tonight a tattoo right you can get a tattoo no you can't get a tattoo sorry but you know if you were able to you you get this tattoo on your arm you know you're in the world and whatever and then you you get saved and praise the Lord It's amazing And and you're Sanctified and you're washed and you receive the Holy Spirit and you're sealed until the day of your Redemption but that tattoo is there to to do one play with your memory it's a battle scar it's a scar that you carry all although I'm so I'm I'm thankful my brother sister that God gives us a new body huh a new body all the scars will be done away with all the all the all the the weaknesses and all those things complexes and depressions or whatever it may be or the scars of this walk you know Prophet says that the resurrection will fix everything that life and death did to us I'm so thankful amen the final great Victory but you know we can carry that scar there's things that we can do to ourselves or that can happen to us that cannot be reversed on this side but you carry that scar but you can still be victorious over those things so there's this three rounds the prophet says it like this he says in the message the Messiah for instance when a man gets saved he's just about like the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt that's when God comes into the inner part of a man in the inner part of a man or a man is made up in the system of a Tabernacle in the outer courts then the holy place in the holiest of holies the Shekinah Glory on the inside the Veil I'll go to the next quote here he says and now on the outside Gates of a man is his five senses that enters to his body on the inside which is the soul the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside of his heart produces his soul which makes the atmosphere around him he or he has also five entrances then on the inside he has only one gate one entrance to go into the Shekinah Glory where God can enter into him and take over in the control tower and that way is through self-will whether you will or not that's up to you but that's the only Avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart is by self-will puts him right back like Adam and Eve on free moral agency again you can choose right or wrong either one you want to you might say well if the music was just right or if we get a certain evangelist through here and man he just preaches just the right kind of sermon and you know puts just the right kind of words together and and then I'll decide to do the right thing we do this in our minds okay you know it's not a it's nothing to be ashamed of you know we have a desire to to be changed and so you start to look for things to to change you but you know you can make if you know that God is calling you and God's moving in your life you can just make a decision say Lord I want to draw nigh unto you yes it's that simple Lord I I don't want to base this decision on feelings or emotions and all those things are fine my brother and sister I believe in a living God and I believe in in in experiences and so and so forth by my brother and sister it doesn't have to be that let your let your decision be based on the word of God based it on something solid so that when the battles come and and the influences come you can take it back to the word not based on how you feel because you're not going to feel good comes Monday right you're going to be tired you're going to get weary and all these things are going to happen so don't base your decisions you make with the Lord on emotions because they're like this right so we have a free moral agency he says you can choose right or wrong either one you want to now obviously there's there's many other things we need to talk about to talk to discuss this obviously the Lord is the one who pulls and he has a season and we understand all those things but I want to show you tonight that you have a right if God is talking to you and if he is if if you're in a battle you have a right to choose right from wrong and God will give you Grace to overcome but you can say Lord I choose right you might have you might be battling with a habit I don't I don't care what it is tonight my brother and sister you can be smoking alcoholism whatever you fill in the blanks tonight whatever you're dealing with you can choose tonight and say Lord I'm done with this thing sharpen my sword Lord teach my hands to do war against the enemy I'm deciding to be victorious over this thing maybe it's a complex and you can say tonight Lord I'm deciding tonight that that I don't want to live like this anymore you said that that the joy of my strength amen so so you want you can decide tonight Lord I want better I know there's a better way I know we I can rise higher than this so you have a right to those things just like shamgar he realized one night he came to himself amen he realized I don't have to put up with this anymore right you have to put up with those things you can overcome he's raised us to overcome in this day we're raised for such a time as this amen oh my okay Christ revealed in his own word he says and last Sunday when he was going into those Cycles about how the five senses in the outer realm that's the inlet five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into the body that's why those five senses tastes feel smell in here there's no other way to contact the body okay these are the rules of engagement this is how this is set up or on the inside of that man is a man called Spirit called spirit and he has five senses see it goes on next quote here he says now you can't think with your body you think with your mind and in there is is where too many Christians only stop and they can it says just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be Anointed with the same holy spirit that the real believer is Anointed with but down on the inside of that the next realm the Third Realm is the soul and that's predestinated by God there is where the real sea germ lays is in there so you walk with the Lord it will your your body will be affected by it it'll change your walk but it's not based on that because it's just his flesh so let's just simplify it a little bit more so here you have the three Realms of men I wasn't about to start drawing a body for you amen I'm not that creative but there's three circles the body spirit and soul now earlier in the in the little sermon tonight uh we were Prophet was talking about the Tabernacle he says we are built like the Tabernacle you know the outer course the Intercourse and then the holiest of holies remember that part so how many here when they were coming into the building tonight let's call this the Tabernacle right so when they when you came into the building tonight how many here felt the wind out there only a few of you did okay it's all right interesting maybe it was just me right but we feel the wind and if it starts to rain what you know you feel the effects of everything that happens out there so when you're outside of this Tabernacle all the effects of the wind and the noise of the cars driving by I had to remind myself again it was very close but I reminded myself again I had to look right first not left first coming down the street right crossing the street because you know back in Canada The Cars first come from the left side right but this here is a little bit different you know go figure but you have to be careful but all those things can affect you in the outer course here and here hopefully I don't have to worry about wind they don't have to worry about rain you know I'm I'm now in a different realm so the different Realms are affected by different things amen and so we Face different things and here we might face you know if it's too hot or too cold but out there we might face you know lightning strikes or whatever it may be if she has bigger things moving into smaller things and smaller things honing it all the way down into that holiest of holies right here where the pulpit maybe is and there's one voice you know out there there's many voices in here there's just one voice and so forth so even that our our body is made this way so out there you know see smell taste feel here what are some of the the things that can influence hearing just quick show of hands here how many here yeah music music right can affect hearing that's because hearing is what a gate to the inside so what are some other things that can affect hearing gossip yeah gossip okay that seems to be a popular one yeah right what else and that's easy brothers and sisters hey you know it's easy to gossip okay that's easy you'll be talking along in a conversation and before you know whoa how did I get here right it's I get it but it's a battle right we're not all perfect but it's a battle and you just have to recognize at that time in that moment when you realize you're walking into a trap just say whoa hey I don't this doesn't feel good you know good feeling is gone right the atmosphere has changed something's off you have a right to fight back and just say Satan I resist you that's right I resist you now I have to say three things positive about that person fight back amen fight back change the atmosphere right okay what else can affect our hearing noise yeah you know people can get really afraid I heard about this girl that was that I heard a dog barking across the street I mean a dog never better or anything like that his brother uh Cadre Diggs I think was telling the story right and how did that noise right and every time she hears a dog bark man it triggers something on the inside right these things affect us right what about uh feel right Phil interesting right just think about that right smell or see sight I mean man we could really talk about sight tonight you know our cell phones computers whatever I mean you name it these are all outside Gates I would encourage you tonight like The Prophet said you know we need to fortify we need to recognize our weak spots you know recognize our weak spots if music is a problem for you you don't blame it on everybody else and try and control everybody else with your problem right we're sensitive to one another I get that but you need a you need to guard that gate right that's something that you're fighting right just recognize this is a problem in my life and Lord help me overcome it Lord help me be rid of this memory or this feeling or sensation you know people get saved from the world and come into the message and and and they and and and they bring that baggage with them sometimes and it's hard for them to to say you know to to um to forget those things and leave it behind they walk past a bar room and they hear music or a dancehall and they hear music and and what does it do it tugs on that the memory in our flesh you know just recognize it's the devil trying to get at you amen right and say Satan I resist you yes yes right I cast you down you have no right here this this is a living place for the Lord Jesus Christ yes not for you you have no influence here right what else can can our site be affected by food yeah I hear you brother pray for me yes sir social media right you see a young person do this or you see somebody a friend do this or a family member do that and how why is it that they're always happy and I and I'm not like them or my household isn't like that or what they're always on vacation it seems like huh you know those things are fine and so forth but if if you're not in the right frame of mind those things can wear on you and you start to look at your life as not fun anymore not exciting and before you know it you know you're in some weird place you know people don't love me God doesn't love me and man it's weird you know we deal with some really interesting stuff but it's a battle right yeah social media influences why can't I do what he's doing it this and that and you know leave it for your parents to sort out right so smell taste feel here this is a we we drag this guy around with us everywhere and he is constantly stimulated he gets tired he gets excited right but see this all outside things all externals outer Court things right so let's move to the inside Gates now we have some really serious stuff because all those things that happen out here they affect these things in here reasoning memory affection conscience and imaginations oh boy that imagination's ones that's a killer that brother didn't look at me just right maybe he doesn't like me next Sunday he didn't look at me again right imaginations right you know I'm not from here so I I'm not speaking to anybody I have no idea right I'm just saying these are battles I have faced right you face these things why didn't they call me this week or you know yeah I'm just saying you know our imagination can get the better of us you can be preaching this is something we struggle with as ministers you know we can be preaching and you look across the congregation and and man that one brother he just he doesn't nod his head he doesn't he doesn't shake his head he and so you started this is something I'm saying is it imaginations maybe he's listening and he's praying God say something Lord please keep moving in this direction or you don't know but see our imagination right because of the eye gate right moves into our now the enemy's just pressing in right Spears first right why to do what to kill you right to destroy you right and then you build a complex and then it goes from there right and then next thing you know you never have victory in the services because you're letting all those things Define your services right yeah for musicians it can be really hard you know musicians we we tend to be I'm a drummer so I'm just putting myself right in there but you we tend to be emotional we tend to be affected by affection and things like that because we are sensitive to the moving of the Holy Spirit right those channels are there in our lives because we we're sensitive to the moving of the Holy Ghost but then if if somebody says something or you're not used right I used to be a very eager drummer I wanted to play every service man because I loved it and then you don't get used right maybe I'm not good enough right and you know it's a battle right I'm talking about some really simple things but these things can get real deep and you can get into some really serious stuff where you get roots of bitterness in our life really where people get bitter and angry and you start treating people uh from that from that angle of bitterness it can get very serious hmm I'm talking to just the young people tonight you know because us older ones we've beaten all these things right right we've overcome them amen and then right there in the soul realm is Faith and doubt and it's interesting how the prophet says that it's down there where the control tower is so you you either and I think it's interesting that it's not based on what you see in your soul realm it's based on faith is based on faith do you believe in God so every time and and I'm going to close because because I feel like um you know we're getting to a point here but if if you just look at the whole the overall picture right we can either we can either we can receive all those things with the attitude of doubt right so something happens and immediately you you go negative right you go negative you take a negative route or you can receive those things and take a positive route and say Lord You're greater than that situation Lord you understand what's happening in that person's life Lord you know my desire right so take a positive reaction have faith right doctor tells you I'll just tell you something simple right doctor tells you that you're sick okay you're sick well he's the doctor you know he's trained in this so that's your reasoning right he's trained he must know what he's talking about you know there's a story of a man that that was told he was he had cancer how many has heard the story he was told he had cancer he didn't actually have cancer but the doctor diagnosed him wrong said he has cancer and then as time went on this man got sicker and he got sicker and he got sicker and then one day they found out he doesn't have cancer and the doctor told him hey wait I might I made the wrong uh prognosis you don't actually have cancer I mixed the the documents up with somebody else but see because of his reasoning that's that's incredible because of his reasoning because of opening his ear gate and his reasoning and accepting what he was saying what happened he got sick wow you see how powerful our words are how powerful this battle is that we we fight I mean that's just sickness I mean what about everything else wow creating something out of nothing the power of this this mind reasoning or you could take that doctor's prognosis and he could say well thank you doctor I appreciate all your hard work but I know somebody else I have another prognosis amen and he said that I'm Healed right take that why not take that over what the doctor said right that's how we fight this battle but you see this is really where it comes down to his faith you know Abraham was was told you're gonna have a son you're gonna have a nation's going to come out of you and Sarah huh and he had to wait 25 years 25 years for that promise to come to pass don't tell me he didn't have a battle every day to the point where God had to make them both young again for that promise to live in their lives but the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God you know there was times in his life where he didn't understand so he had Hagar and he had made all he made mistakes but you know God did not change his promise to Abraham so let us have faith let's have faith I want to encourage you young people have faith in God right all these outside things don't let them be governed by all the outside influence don't let your life be governed by those outside influences but let your life be governed from faith amen walk in faith we do not walk by side we don't walk after the flesh we walk after the spirit we walk in faith amen amen see those five senses were given to you to contact this Earth but it's not necessarily Who You Are you talking about all these things see that's where the free moral agency is in our mind reasonings all those things the Battleground the mind the intelligence the brain it's a great Battleground but the Bible tells us that God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind you say that sink in for a moment and of a sound mind the Bible tells us to fortify the mind to put on the helmet of salvation what is salvation it's a defense of Deliverance that is what salvation is it's a defense or a deliverance from something or restoration or preservation a restoration what does the helmet do it protects the mind but on the helmet of salvation so many beautiful things that God has done for us we're not going to have time tonight but I'm just going to close here you see just the underlying part there where the Prophet says what is your mind controlled by it's your spirit see your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you that's powerful so even the spirit of reasoning of fears and of doubts and all those things what can this mind be controlled we've been given a sound mind amen so what do we do right we take the word of God faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God what does he do he builds up our faith amen that word comes in by his stripes I'm Healed right so then the rest of the body becomes subject to that word see it's very simple right so we we actually decide let me put it like this and I respect each and every one of you and say this very sincerely but we actually decide to be depressed we actually decide okay if you if you look at it the whole picture you actually decide to be hurt you decide in in your mind in your conscience and your reasonings you decide to let those things affect you that's that is why this is a battle thank you you see something can happen in your life you can say man this was really cruel this was really bad but then you find that scripture that says all things work together for good to them that love God how do you reconcile that yes you just say Lord this was hard I don't understand it but I know you love me I know you love me and this happened to me because there's a greater purpose and maybe I don't see it Lord but Lord give me strength to face this Lord you said I can bring my cares to you and lay them at your feet because you care for me see it's all about how we re how we react or receive things in our lives it's a battle we are fighting a battle day in Day Out or we can say man God must be a cruel God or not love me because of what happened to me but you have a problem because you have a scripture that says that all things work together for your good that he wants to bring you to an expected end that he loves you that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so does that mean suddenly he didn't order your footsteps does that mean that he he wasn't there he said I would never leave you nor forsake you huh I don't know take it up with him I'm just telling you what the word tells us but see we get into a spot in our life my brother sister I want to encourage you we're in a battle then it's not going to get easier but we need to feed on the word and start taking what God Said over what's happening in our lives sometimes or all the time okay we don't have time for all this but here's really the thing right down there in the soul Realm like they like the prophet says in your heart is actually this little chamber a secret chamber right where the sea Gene of God is God planted a seed there in good ground right the seed of seed word of God of God that the prophet says is the control tower he says it's the real you the real you is right here so the real you is not my affections not my memories think about that right it's not all those things it's not what I touch feel smell here that's not the real me the real me is is in here right because the old you would smoke the old you would be attracted to the things of this world but see the real you doesn't have a desire for that you see what I'm saying tonight see that's where that predestinated seed dwells the Temple of the Holy Ghost the sixth sense as the prophet calls it which is Faith or Zoe life or the heart of God right here he says that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body right A New Life a new creature in Christ Jesus do we see why it's so important to be born again I mean I'm closing we can stand together tonight you see why it's so important to be born again because we need we need God to be in the control tower we need the Holy Ghost leading Our Lives because if he's leading what does it do he makes our decisions he's our affections amen he he rewrites everything I'll write my my laws on the fleshy tables of your heart he said amen he he it's a new and a living way you know someone said to me once you know about there was this young person came out of a meeting and he's and he said man we were just told you know that we inherit everything from our parents and all its traits and and anger and all these things and and and you know it was really distraught about this you know because he just heard this and and now he's thinking about you know what am I going to do because you know I've inherited I know how my father was and I've inherited some of these things and I said to him wait a second wait a second what does the Bible say right the Bible says that you're a new creature in Christ Jesus and life I now love is not my own but it's Christ that lives through me you see what I mean my brother sister that's the control tower we don't have to put up with those things everything stops when Jesus Christ comes into your heart everything is new you have a right to Joy you have a right to happen is you have a right to to uh guiltlessness amen you have a light a right to being innocent to being forgiven you have a right to to all those things to health and and having Victory and overcoming you have a right to those things because you're a new creature in Christ Jesus amen amen there's so many things we could talk about tonight but I just trust that that you feel in your hearts as I I even feel inspired this evening I just feel Lord I want I want to have victory in the battle yes you know I'm not planning on getting up tomorrow morning and being defeated we're going through the same motions and showing up again on Sunday in the same routine no I want to I want to take possession you know I want to take possession I love that you know the the Roman Legions you know when they used to come together and they would do their battle formations they would just give a command and that whole unit you know would come into a box or make a circle or you know they would make all these different things or make a a an arrowhead you know and they had reasons for all that you know and everybody knew their place and position and then when they made contact with the Enemy you know they would just stand there and then they would and then the command would come to press forward and it would just take a step that whole unit would move forward one big step right and and push back on the enemy like that right what they're doing they're putting pressure on the enemy pressure on the enemy but they're not moving backwards they're moving forwards all the time putting pressure on the enemy they got their Shield up they got the helmet of salvation right they have their sword they have their Spears and everything's everything's there they put on the whole armor of God they're battle ready yeah and then they get into position and they come together and and they sing songs of worship amen that's the Lord dwells in the Praises of his people right what does that do it opens up the channels that and everybody's in their position everybody's in step in one Accord amen pressing forward and better let
