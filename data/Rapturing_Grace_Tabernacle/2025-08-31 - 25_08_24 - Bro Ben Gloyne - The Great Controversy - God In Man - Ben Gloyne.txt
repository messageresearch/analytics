So I um because uh I've been playing all my other instruments and it's sort of been felt it's been left out. So I thought I better rekindle um our relationship. Um I'm going to do a just a instrumental medley. I was going to get the words put up on the screen, but techies weren't techy enough to do it for me. So um first one give me oil in my lamp. Second one I will enter his gates and then bigger than all my problems I saw the light of an unclouded day and back to give me oil in my lamp. At least that's what I'm going to do in theory. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Data. Heat. [Music] [Applause] I have to bring that out more often. You want to stand with me? What a beautiful name it is.

It's so wonderful to serve him. It's so wonderful to know him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Such a privilege to be chosen before the foundation of the earth. Amen. There's nothing that money could buy that that ever scratches the surface of that. Amen. And the best of it is we had nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's the kind of God we serve. And I trust you excited to be in the house of the Lord this morning. We'd like to welcome each one this morning and also welcome our visitors and trust that we come with prayed up hearts, expecting hearts, cups held out so the Lord can fill it this morning and trust that we also bring our licks of fire together to to uh do our little part. Amen. So, it's really really lovely to have brother Ben here. Like I was saying to him this morning, time flies so quick. Feels like he was here the other day, but it's not been the other day. It's been a while. Amen. But thank you very much for for coming and especially taking the load off me this morning. So that's a a real blessing. Really appreciate it. I want to also just say thank you very much for uh last night for everyone's support and effort and um all all your love that we experienced through through those things. I want to say God bless you richly and thank you very much for making it a special time for Justin and Carissa. May may the Lord just pull pour back the blessings on you for that. Um, sorry to do this here, but I just don't know what else to do. But, um, Paula left a a phone charger cable there last night. So, if someone maybe picked it up, I'd appreciate if you could just pass it on to her. Praise the Lord. Well, Brother Ben doesn't need any introduction, so u I'm not going to take too much time. We'll just sing one more song and then I'll hand straight over to him. Um, as brother Jeremy was playing this song, I just thought that would be maybe unusual song to come up with, but I um, &gt;&gt; if we sing it with the right hearts, then I believe it will be a blessing to us. Amen. Bigger than all my problems, bigger than all my problems, bigger than all my fears. God is bigger than any mountain that I cannot see. Bigger than all my questions, bigger than anything. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Okay. Amen. Who can testify that's true? Hallelujah. He's bigger than everything. Amen. And there's nothing too hard for our God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you musicians. Thank you. God bless you all. Great to be here. Appreciate the invitation, brother Array. And it was great to be here yesterday to celebrate with Justin and Carissa. We're so excited for them. So I pray all goes well and enjoy life together. And um yeah, when yeah, when the wedding comes and everything. So yeah, we're happy to be here. Want to say thank you very much for your prayers for Christine. We really literally feel like we've been carried by the prayers of the saints. So it's been phenomenal. So really appreciate it. Um, yeah, it's been an interesting time, but you know, the Lord is the Lord is good. The Lord is working. Um, you know, as soon as the other car rear ended her, uh, the Lord dropped in her heart Romans 8:28, that all things work together for good. Those that love God are called according to his purpose. This is working for our good. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know the details, but God takes care of those things. So, you know, so we just trust the Lord. And yes, so thank you for your prayers. Really, thank you so much. Really appreciate that. Amen. Let's um Yeah. And all the folks back home, say hi. Say, "God bless you." So, it's great to be here. See you all. Amen. Let's just go to John chapter 10 and we're going to read um how do I drive this thing with this? &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Okay, so yeah, John 10 and 27. And uh we're just going to read um couple of scriptures here. And this is um not anything I've got nothing new to bring. Um I just pray this will be a blessing. So John 10:27 um the Lord Jesus speaking here says say says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my hand. I and my father are one. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, "My good many good works have I showed you from my father. for which of um those works do you stone me? And then and then he says, "Then the Jews answered him, saying, for a good work we stone thee not." Uh stone not. I mean, sorry, I'm just changing where I'm reading from. Then the Jews, yeah, so so for a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself God. Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law that I said ye are gods? if he called them gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world. Thou blasphemst because I said I am the son of God. If I do not the works of my father believe me not. But if I do but if I do though you believe me not believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father's father is in me and I in him. Amen. So let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. If you have a need, just say, "Lord, come come by my way." You know, the prophet taught us he always comes where he's invited. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, let's just invite him. Let's have a moment. I'm inviting him to where I'm at. So, let's just say, "Lord, come by my way this morning." Amen. Let's pray this morning. Gracious heavenly father, as we bow our heads in your great presence, we just want to acknowledge truly you're bigger than all our problems, our mountains. Father, whatever we may be facing in life, we know you have already conquered all things, Lord. So, we just want to come with great thanksgiving in our hearts that we're your children by your supreme grace. Thank you, Lord, that you are alive and well and working in our lives. And father, we've read your great word. Lord, we need you to come and speak it, Lord. Anoint it, Lord. You're the author of the book, Lord. So, we just want to yield all of ourselves, Lord, into your hands, dear God. Lord, I pray you'd speak through me, hear through the people, Lord. May you worship through all of us, Lord. May you be glorified in our midst. That's what we want to do is praise you and give you praise due unto your great name. So Lord, I pray you'd be with us, Lord. Be with those who couldn't be here today, Father. Sick and body, Lord. Whatever is going on, be their abundant portion. Lord, we commit them into your hands. We thank you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, I want to speak about I want to speak about the great controversy about God being in man. So, as I said, this is nothing new or, you know, I'm sure this is all very familiar to us. But, you know, it's amazing when when when we look at how how the reason they would want to stone the Lord Jesus is because he made himself God, right? So, it wasn't his good works. It wasn't his healings, it wasn't the miracles, it was the fact he said, "I am God made flesh." And it's always been a great controversy through the ages about God being in man. You know when we when we use the term you know even you know anyone or any denomination has no problem saying that that the Holy Ghost dwells in them. Even the Catholics would acknowledge that. But the thing is what happens is people take take that and they actually diminish it that the Holy Ghost is is somehow a lesser part of God or a third part of the God, you know, a third person in the Godhead and actually diminish him because we know the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in spirit form. He is supreme deity. Amen. He's not a god. He's not a lesser being. He's the supreme one that made heavens and earth. And brother Bram says, we'll come to it later. He says, "Dity is not just in heaven, but in but it's in you." Amen. So the controversy is is is actually the fact we can say the God who made heavens and earth is in you. Amen. Not a lesser God, not a religious spirit vying for power or control. No, the one who conquered hell, death, and the grave dwelt in his children. Amen. So this is but but this is actually quite a controversy because people cannot seem to fathom because the devil can't fathom it how the Lord of glory who's higher than the heavens. Holier he's so holy that even angels look dirty in his sight could come and dwell in a people such as us. Amen. So so this stumbles people. It actually makes people offended. You know it's actually a pagan idea to split God into pieces. This is what the world wants to try and do. Say yes you have the Holy Ghost but it's a a lesser God. No, it is the God. Uh, so this is very I I know I'm preaching to the choir, but I just pray that when when we're all said and done, you actually realize who's really in me, who's motivating my life, who drew me, who saved me, who called me, who kept me, who's revealing himself to me. It's not some Buddhist some statue somewhere or some spirit roaming around. It's the God who made all things. Amen. So, I trust we can have a good time this morning and just enjoy these things. Amen. Because the because the word, you know, you know, the word says that God the Almighty dwells in the believer. &gt;&gt; Who's ever heard the saying, you know, I know this is a denominational thing, but they say, you know, I let Jesus into my heart, but now I need to receive the Holy Ghost. Who's heard things like that? &gt;&gt; That's a pagan idea &gt;&gt; because Jesus is the Holy Ghost. You don't have to give, you know, you don't have to, oh, Jesus came in, now I need another part of God. He's all that he is is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. No, just here we go. Now, this is this is Isaiah 53. Now, because the big thing we wrestle with is always the form God comes in. That's the it's it's the outside bit. &gt;&gt; It's the outside bit that's controversial. Says, you know, even the prophecy would be here in Isaiah. He says, "Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Well, it's those who the arm of the Lord is revealed beliefs his report. So, the arm of the Lord's been revealed to you. We're a blessed people this morning. Amen. For he shall grow up before you as a tender plant, as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor comeliness, that when we shall see him, there is no beauty, amen, that we should desire him. So his outward form is not some fantastic thing. You know how how the traditions of, you know, you see like a children's Bible or some traditional picture of Jesus and he's like 6' blonde head, looks different to everyone else that's in the picture. He looked exactly the same. I actually could say he probably looked less than everyone else in reality. There was nothing when you saw him. Oh yes, this is the Messiah. But the life that was manifesting, I mean, the word was made flesh. It was God on the inside. I could put it that way. I mean, I mean, that was manifesting himself. That was the God part. &gt;&gt; We know he was the God man, but it was deity was in him, right? The fullness of Godhead bodily. I'm not splitting God up. Okay? I believe in one. All right? So, we're okay. But you see now the outside was not the thing that Oh, yes, that's him. And it's the same thing with us. You know, you look at the believer and it's such a contrast to the great cathedrals of the world, the great Polish worship of the world, the charismatic move. Now, it's all choreographed and perfect and we come along. Now, I'm not talking here. You guys are amazing. But, you know, we just come along and you like compare the two and say, "No, man. These guys, what's going on here?" But that's God manifested in a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God. Amen. It is the brideg of Jesus Christ. Amen. where God himself is now veiled behind you. Praise the Lord. Amen. I tell you what, friends, if you realize if God's in you, what complex can hinder you? I mean, what unbelief can stop you? I mean, what what what fear or what stigma or what worry? I mean, if you realize the God who made all things that conquered hell, death, and the grave, remember, he conquered everything. There's not anything else that needs to be conquered. He conquered it all. Amen. So, if he conquered it all, the victorious Christ dwells in you. Amen. Then to me, that just raises my faith. There's nothing impossible with me. Amen. Because he the one who does the impossible dwells in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we got to realize this very God dwells in you and I. Amen. So what can he do? I mean what can he not do? He he can do everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I think that should take the limitation. You say, "Oh yeah, but it's me and and he's in me. So therefore he's different." No, he's the same God &gt;&gt; who took the keys of hell in the grave of Satan. The same one who conquered all spirits of culture, religious spirits, stigmas. He was born with a black name of being an illegitimate child. He rose above that. He rose above rejection. He rose above hurt because he is here to I'm here to do one thing, the will of my father. Amen. He knew the word that he was there to fulfill. And remember, you're here to fulfill the word, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we can praise God and say, "Lord, if you're in me, I I you can do anything, Lord. &gt;&gt; This guy, he's different, but you can do anything, Lord." Amen. Now remember remember the Lord himself said there's nothing impossible with you. All things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Oh well do I have enough faith? Well are you saved? &gt;&gt; Did you believe in the Lord Jesus? He came in changed your life. Amen. Are you a different person to when you first surrendered your life? You're going from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Then you've got all the faith. God grows our faith. But you got to see you have faith. You got more than you realize. You're packing more than you think you have. Oh, I'm just going through life and struggling and seem to be just wandering around. You ain't wandering. God's direct yours directed your steps. Amen. The footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, there's some steps I wish I didn't have to walk down." They were ordered. &gt;&gt; And was it cuz God was displeased with you? &gt;&gt; No. Remember all the judgment we should have taken? &gt;&gt; He took on Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; The wrath of God, the judgment to to to fulfill the law, all those things he took on Calvary. &gt;&gt; There's no judgment for you and I. We've passed from death to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot go to the judgment cuz he took our judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we can just walk with a lightness in our step and say, "Lord, I don't need to fear nothing. We don't need to fear death. We don't need to fear hell." &gt;&gt; He went to hell, so you don't have to go. &gt;&gt; The closest you'll ever get to hell is in this plan of of existence. You'll never go anywhere closer to it, &gt;&gt; but heaven, you're going a lot closer, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, what do we have to fear? I remember, you know, well, this is before I met Christine, but she was in Switzerland. She was nursing her uh auntie, so brother Albert's sister who was who was uh she had terminal brain cancer, and you know, she led her to the Lord before she passed. But, you know, she had Christine had an accident on a on a on a uh push bike and they gave her Tramodol and she had an anaphylactic reaction and she literally left her body in the in the hospital and she could look back and she could see her auntie her her her her other auntie weeping over her as she's laying there unresponsive and and and she's being lifted up into glory and and the one thing she wish you could tell her say, "You don't need to worry about me. This is amazing. &gt;&gt; There was no fear." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There was no fear. Amen. Of course, we know she didn't die. She came back and here she is today. But you know, but but the thing is for the believer there's no fear. &gt;&gt; You know, we get so caught up in troubles and things in our minds, but you got to realize when when when our human faculties are stripped away, our true self can come out. &gt;&gt; You know, you take the contrast, you know, brother Bram tells the story of there's that that lady who was a Sunday school teacher in a nominal church and you know, she got some disease. She was dying in the hospital and her and her pastor was pacing up and down the hall smoking a cigarette and all the Sunday school teach um children came to watch her be carried by angels to glory. Who knows that story, right? So now when her so so her reasoning made her think she was okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. But then when her mental faculties were going to leave her as she was dying, she realized her true state. Now you take the opposite of that to a believer cuz we have our mind bales. We got our complex, our things we wrestle with. Amen. But when when that human factor leaves our true state of our soul raises up. Amen. Instead of us saying we're lost, we've been deceived. We say, "I'm saved. I know in whom I believed." Amen. I'm secure. God's coming to carry me away. Hallelujah. Our true self comes out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The true you comes out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't worry about what you're going through. God's got you. &gt;&gt; And you're not going through it cuz he's displeased with you. Actually, brother Ram says that God, you found favor with God. That's why you're going through a trial. Amen. Because God has confidence in you. Not your human ability, but your but the faith in your soul. That gene seed. He's got confidence with you that you're going to go through and come out packing the victory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't know what I'm going through. He does. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, this has always been the controversy. This is a I I doubt they were sitting down when this happened. But I try and find pictures. It's like just doesn't quite Yeah. Because the girls like pictures and things, you know, but you know, this is now deity coming into humanity. Amen. God coming and dwelling in his people. And this has always been the controversy. How can God dwell in man? Council of Nasa was a big argument about this. And they brought in Greek philosophy and describe God and all these things. But God wanted to dwell in man. Okay. Now, but the thing is we wrestle with the outside. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a cross-section of the of the coverings of the tabernacle in the wilderness. We know there's the you know the curtain and different things and but on the outside was badger skin. And this is the thing we wrestle with is the badger skin. Now I want you to think about this before the moment before God dw came and dwelt in that tabernacle, right? It was bad skin. When he came and dwelt in there above the cherubam and the holy of holies, above the mercy seat, the badger skin stayed bad skin. It did not become super duper bad skin, right? It did not become a different material. It was exactly the same bad skin it was before he stepped in. It's the same thing with you and I. This badger skin that we dwell in, it doesn't become a super duper bad skin after we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's the same old bad skin, &gt;&gt; right? that's got the same old nature, got the same old, you know, self. Yeah. Okay. Some of you have been super duper, but yeah, I'm still the same. But this is the thing we wrestle with cuz we think, if God's in me, how could I ever put a foot wrong? How could I ever make a mistake? How could I ever wonder or guess or second guess things or have troubles if God is in me? And the reason is this guy ain't changed yet. &gt;&gt; This guy is still unsaved. You carry an unbeliever around with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; This guy. Amen. Even the human spirit is contrary to to God. That's why we need the word to come wash our human spirit out. Amen. Cleanse things that the devil tries to put in there and complexes and pains and hurts. And we just let the word come and wash it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. We let come God come and scrub those things. But it's still the same human spirit. But there will come a day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where this badge of skin is going to become a super duper badger of skin. Amen. Hallelujah. But you see, we we walk around in this thing because you look at that, you know, imagine if we went, you know, we're back there however many thousand years ago, you know, we're and somehow we're allowed to peek at the outside of the tabernacle. There's some Jewish brothers telling your sister telling you the God who made heavens and earth in the building you're about to see. The Lord of glory dwells. He spoke the worlds into existence. He's supreme over all. There's no God beside him. He's the He, you know, he's a supreme deity. and we come over the hill and we see a tent. &gt;&gt; I think there'd be an underwhelmed feeling come over us. Let's be honest, okay? Where's the gold? Where's the big, you know, marble and the incredible facads and all the buildings and things and it's just a temple. I mean, you know, it's just a tent. Even even Solomon's temple wasn't really that great compared to others. But the difference is God made the difference. &gt;&gt; It was a word constructed building. I mean, just like you and I, we're word constructed buildings. Amen. Where God comes and dwells in us. But the difference is God was in there. &gt;&gt; God is in you. Christ in you the hope of glory. Not a lesser God. I know these things are elementary, but I just probably just anchor a little bit more into us. We realize God, &gt;&gt; not just a God or a religion or a movement. Him. &gt;&gt; Elohim, the self-existing one is expressing himself through human flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, because the thing is we get, you know, but the thing is the badger skin is not important in this building. It's the God in the badger skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like this thing this this thing that we are so worried about, we wrestle with. It's just the skin, man. You know, well, that's easy for you to say. Well, no, it's not. But I Yeah, I wrestle with this this guy. Remember a badger. Isn't it amazing that the outside's not a lamb skin or it's not some animal that that that would typify or represent our Lord? &gt;&gt; It's not dove skin or, you know, it's not or a lamb or that kind of nature. It's a badger. &gt;&gt; Who's ever seen? Well, the closest thing I seen to a badger is a honey badger. Man, those things are wild. They get into everything. They like their nature is not meek. It's not gentle. It's not kind. They'll take on anything. If it's if you're in its way, you better get out of its way. You'll be a lion. You can be an elephant. Whatever. Those got this mean kind of a temperament. And God would show that &gt;&gt; as this. &gt;&gt; But it's not about this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just got to come to reconciliation. God, you're working in me. God, you dwell in me. You're changing me from glory to glory. It's not about the skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the thing is we think that if we are perfect and we are sinlessly perfect. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ I I'll announce something to you this morning cuz that was a bit muted. The blood of Jesus Christ makes you sinlessly perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you die, if you're under the blood right now, you die, you're going straight to glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean your destination is assured because remember brother Brown brought it out in the church age book the previous age the Methodist age what they did is they said it was the blood and your own good conduct. &gt;&gt; They did not know the blood and its reality though it worked in that age but now we've come into an age where the word has come into its fullness into its reality. And it's not the blood and your own good conduct. It is the blood alone of salvation. Remember we are saved by grace through faith. Amen. It is God's mercy. It's his atonement that matters. It's not your good conduct. You say, "Well, do I need to do good works?" Well, if he's in you, you will live the life cuz he's living it through you. Amen. It's not you trying to manufacture the message. That's why so many people have miserably, sadly failed at their own good intentions if humanly tried to manifest the word. Amen. But that will always come to a failure point. If you are frustrated in your Christian walk, just give over to the Lord a bit more. Just surrender yourself. Amen. Just say, "Lord, I can't live this stage of my life. I can't do this. I don't know." You say, "Lord, come and live through me." allow him to have dominion. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, we are free moral agents. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't come in and say, "Now look at now you're a robot." And we come and we are like robotically, you know. No, we still have our own human will. We have our own human desires, right? We're still people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not robots. God doesn't want a robot. Like I I said, probably brother Marty would remember this. I don't know. But, you know, I said a couple of Sundays ago, you know, I never wanted a robot as a wife. &gt;&gt; I like Christine being her. &gt;&gt; She's got personality. She's got tenaciously. You know, she's got a real zeal. I love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God doesn't want a robot. He had angels to worship him. Sure, they had a free will. They could choose to do it. But, you know, he doesn't want some just a robotic, yes, Lord, I believe the message and I have no desire or I've killed every part of my human emotions and it's all dead. God never wanted that. &gt;&gt; God never wanted that. He wanted us to have our own personality and will. And that's why he made you the way you are. He likes you how you are. Amen. If you're quiet, he likes you quiet. If you're loud, he likes you loud. Whatever you are in that spectrum, he likes you how you are. &gt;&gt; Why? You know, I think we just got to come to peace with the badger skin. &gt;&gt; You mean my quirks and my things, he likes you that way. Imagine if we were all the same. We'd be boring, man. It'd be it'd be like, man, this is what's going on here. You know, if you're all like me, man, I'm sorry for you. You know, &gt;&gt; you know, but it would be it would be dull. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, but we look at someone else, I want to be like them. No, be how you are. &gt;&gt; God made you a certain way. If he wanted you different, he would have made you different. God has made you a certain way. Amen. for deity to be expressed in a unique way, not contrary to the word, but you can express God can express himself through your personality different to how he can express him through me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? We're remember we're a bouquet. &gt;&gt; Every part of the bouquet is important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but we seem to think that perfection is a flawless walk. Perfection is not flawlessness. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because if we get these things in our mind, and I'm sure you don't have them, but you know, you know, you know, you get this thing in your mind, I've got to have a po perfect walk, therefore I've matured. It ain't that. &gt;&gt; It ain't that. Perfection is not flawlessness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we Why do we allow the devil to put something in our mind or an image before us that we could never obtain to and God never wanted you to obtain to? &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not meant to have a flawless walk where I never have a bad day. I never have ill feelings. I never have any trouble. I never have any doubts or questions or wondering about things. &gt;&gt; That no that is not perfection is by his blood. &gt;&gt; Perfection is by his atoning blood. Amen. Perfection is not oh you see maturity is not that now I'm flawless. Okay let's just look at the prophet. &gt;&gt; Okay here he is dispensational truth has come into his hand. The sword of the lord has come. The seals are come open. you know the book of redemption has come open you know incredible things that angels and believers have desired to look and when's the moment when the you know like John you know you know there's always a question when is this going to happen and then finally it's happened right Christ comes the seals come open reveal the truth and God releases a power in this age to break the curse of death and you know there's going to be a people who are alive and remain God's released a word into this season amen to transform us into the fullness of the word and then he's rejected It even says when he's preaching it, I know thousands of my friends are going to leave me because of this. It was all it was all according to the scripture. It wasn't anything added or taken away. But and and then what happened? He developed the complex. &gt;&gt; There he was a mature adopted son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There he was full of the Holy Ghost, seeing God, countless visions, supernatural God working with him in all of his life. And he develops a complex because his bad skin did not like rejection. And he had to be rejected cuz Christ was on the outside of the door in this age. So it had to be lived out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wasn't happy about that. He was hurt. &gt;&gt; He was human. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he wanted to, you know, become a trapper up northern British Columbia. I know you know these stories, but you know, let's put yourself there because many things, oh, the prophet never did anything wrong. He said he did. &gt;&gt; Oh, he knew what to do in every circumstance, every situation. No, he didn't. &gt;&gt; He didn't say that. That's a deity spirit trying to deify the prophet. &gt;&gt; And then what does that do? It puts an idol before the people. And an idol always makes people fail and fall and be disappointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word of God did never put an image before us to make us be disappointed. But who realize, hey, he was a man of like passions just like we are. He had feelings and emotions, troubles, questions, all the unanswered prayers that seem to linger. But yet that did not change nothing of his walk with God. He was an adopted son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now if that's how the prophet was, but then we can now mind adoption as in we'll never have a problem. We'll know what to do everything. We'll never put a foot wrong. Never have anything that we cringe about and you know disappointments or have to make things right. No, &gt;&gt; I may be wrong here, brother. You can fix this. But you know, but I think we can get this thing in our mind of adoption and maturity which is not according to the scripture. It's not according to the message. Cuz brother Ram said a housewife is an adopted position in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; I mean what you're living actually you find I think we'll find that we're actually more adopted than we realize. Oh, one day and then one day all the power will come and one day God will pour himself out. I tell you what, friends, the power is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe this word has placed the people in their position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, one day I've got to take some land. I tell you what, Caleb was anointed. Amen. When when he believed the believed the promise was his. Amen. The same power that was with him then made him get his mountain. &gt;&gt; He did not become powerful when he received that mountain. No. When he believed it by faith and took it. Amen. He was an adopted son of God. God brought him into his position. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so why do we put this thing in front of us? Well, one day I'll get there. You know, it's like a donkey with a man and a stick and a carrot, you know, and gets the donkey to move. And I remember we tried when I was young, we had a golden Labrador. We had a little go-kart. So, we strapped into it one day and we had a stick and some food, you know, but when he realized he was pulling something, he just stopped here. I know this is this is not what I'm here for. &gt;&gt; I think we need to stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil puts things in front of us that just makes us disappointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we need to say, "No, hold on. Is this according to the scripture? &gt;&gt; Is this according to really what Malachi 4 has revealed?" &gt;&gt; If it's not, I'd forget it. &gt;&gt; We need to get these mindsets. I'm talking to myself very much. We need to get these mindsets out of our life, you know, because you know, it's not about perfection is not flawlessness. Actually, no. Perfection is is is because of the blood, because of his atonement. And sure, because the thing is, we will be disappointed in ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every day. Well, not every day, but you know, we will be disappointed till these bodies are changed cuz we're human. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, does that mean you're an unbeliever? No. &gt;&gt; Well, so I just want to labor this point. I I just want some liberty to come into our lives like never before. God saved me. God found me. He's filled me with his spirit. Amen. He's working in my life. Amen. The badge of skin is such a problem. But it shouldn't be. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, we have something within us that the world doesn't have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because only a believer with the Holy Ghost can truly forgive. Amen. Only a believer with the Holy Ghost can tr because forgiveness is more than accepting an apology. It's a reconciliation. It's a restoration of a person back to what they were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you got the Holy Ghost, you can forgive that way. Amen. It's not, you know, it's not yes, I accept your apology. The world does that. No, the Holy Ghost can give true forgiveness. Are we all together this morning? Amen. Uh only someone with the Holy Ghost can actually get, you know, be healed and set free. And you can help someone else. You know, I've been thinking quite quite a bit recently of the of the four friends that carried their crippled friend into the presence of the Lord. you know, they couldn't get into the house, but their faith wasn't willing to take any obstacle as a as a I've got to stop here. They couldn't get into the house. Their faith did not say, "Well, I guess that's as far as we can go." Faith doesn't look at obstacles. It just looks at the result that's been revealed cuz faith is a revelation. So, what they do, they got up into the roof and they begin to put a sunroof into that guy's house. They didn't ask permission. They didn't ask for building consent or is this okay? No, they had a burden. We must get our crippled friend into the presence of the Lord that he can be healed. He can get up out of this cot that the cot doesn't define him anymore. Amen. But full health and restoration defines him. Amen. So, so what did they do? They took the ceiling off and they lowered him down and the and and you got to read the scripture. It says, "And the Lord said when he saw their faith, &gt;&gt; it's not about the crippled man's faith." It didn't even come into the story at all. It was the faith of the friends that got him there. Amen. And someone with the Holy Ghost can get a crippled person. Many times we look at, oh, their faith is not and they don't believe. Is that actually got anything to do with it? What about your revelation? I mean, what about your faith that you carry? Amen. Where you can actually by prayer and an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost take ceiling tiles off. Amen. To get people into the presence of God that God begin to talk to them first person and they can realize it's God speaking to me. And they'll finish with him saying, "Get up out of that affliction. Get up out of that unbelief." That's that's defining you. Get up out of it and carry it away as a trophy of my grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We live in an age where self-esteem is so often spoken about. &gt;&gt; Low self-esteem. And self-esteem we understand is a negative self- opinion marked by harsh self-criticism, ignoring achievements, believing oneself as inferior, and experiencing anxiety and shyness around others. What have you achieved in your life? Now, I'm not talking natural now because it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You can have the bit. You could own Tanaki. You can't take it with you. &gt;&gt; I could own I could be the Lord of Wellington. Thank God I'm not. But he said, "I can't take it with me. I can be Bill Gates or whoever whoever who's rich, Elon Musk or I I don't know who the guy is. Doesn't matter." But you know, you can't take anything of it with you. &gt;&gt; So achievements in life, I'm not talking about those achievements. But you see, the devil wants us to look at those achievements. Where are you? Where's your, you know, oh, you're this age, you should have this, you don't have this, and therefore you're this, and you know, all these negative things. But I tell you what, if you know, if you know the Lord, &gt;&gt; you've achieved &gt;&gt; life, &gt;&gt; you've won the game of life. Amen. If you know Christ, you've won it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have eternal life. Amen. If you died right now, you know where you're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but what about this and my bucket list and all these things? No, you've won it all. &gt;&gt; You have achieved really what life is all about. You know the master. Amen. You know the creator himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So why do I have low self-esteem and negative self- opinion? What's God's opinion of you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the Lord's opin? Have you ever asked him, "Lord, what do you think of me?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we'll just take one. You know, when you go buy something in the shop or you make some big purchase, right? You put the value of the thing you're buying at greater value than your money. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you wouldn't buy it. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, the Lord Jesus comes to the earth because he's got a lamb's book of life that he needs to redeem. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what does he do? He puts the value of you at greater value of his own life. &gt;&gt; That's why he died on Calvary. If he thought his own life was more valuable, he would never have died. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if he just went for you, he would have done it all. &gt;&gt; He would have done it all just for you. I mean, that's how much value he's put on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, friends, I think we should we shouldn't have a negative opinion of ourselves. Remember, he did not save us just to kick us off to one side. Remember, this message is a bridegroom call. Brother Ram said the bridegroom call will come right through this. It's an individual invitation and to become one with our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So he didn't save you just to throw you off on one side. No, he saved you to keep you. Amen. He called you to take you all the way. He hasn't brought you just halfway. And you know, God never starts a project he can't finish. &gt;&gt; You we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; We are his project. Amen. He does not stop halfway and say, "I just can't work with this guy." He set in his ways and oh, you know, he just wants to stay in his comfort zone all the time and I just can't work with him. God never has that attitude. &gt;&gt; God can't think a new thought about you or anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he thought of you before the foundation, well, that's why he said to Job, "Listen, Job, you're so caught up in the bad skin. You're sitting here wondering what's going on in this defeat, questioning, defending yourself, all these things." And then God comes to him after Eloh comes along. And Eloh actually means in the Hebrew means the God of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who and who who's the subject of the book? Job. So Job's God comes in flesh and talks to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and then and then and then Eloh was actually angry at Job because Job was justifying himself in the trial instead of justifying God. And what happens in but in the beginning of the book when his own wife, you know, Job's wife says to him, listen, just curse God and die. and and Job says to no, the Lord gives the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So at the beginning of the trial, he justifies God. But then when his three friends come along and basically say, "Listen, Job, this is you, man. That's been exposed. Look, you're a sinner. This is why this has happened to you, Job." You know, he begins to justify himself in the trial. And how often do we get to a point where we're justifying the bad skin &gt;&gt; instead of justifying God? &gt;&gt; God's in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he loved me in the before the foundation world, he still loves me. And nothing I can do in this plane of existence can change his thought towards me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he has the thoughts towards me of peace. I'll come to my expected end. What's that expected end? In a glorified body in eternity. That's my expected end. Amen. So he can't change his mind about me. Is this okay this morning? Have you got to think? If God loves you, I'm love. If he loves me, I'm loved. If I'm accepted in the beloved, I'm accepted. &gt;&gt; Hey. Oh, but you know me and I've got these flaws and this humanity and criticizing and all, you know, all these things. Why do we look at the badge of skin? &gt;&gt; We're eternal. We're eternal beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Having a earthly experience. We're just coming through this dark room to be developed like a film. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. But it's not about your humanity. See, many people they wrestle with, well, God could never save me and you know, because I've done too much wrong and all these things. We've all done wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was running from God at university making homebrew, partying it up. &gt;&gt; I was in the pub. A voice would say to me, "What are you doing?" I knew it was God. I didn't want to answer him. &gt;&gt; Serious. &gt;&gt; Cuz I knew who was calling me. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to answer him. &gt;&gt; I know what it's like to be lost. And I know what it's like for God to get you to a point where you have no more excuse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz so many people have excuses because of the badger skin. &gt;&gt; No. God God looks far beyond this th this guy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So why why why use the bad skin as an excuse why we can't serve God? We should actually look at God and he gives us all the reasons why we can. Amen. Like brother says, when the Holy Ghost comes, he takes all the cans out. &gt;&gt; I can't overcome. I can't have victory. I can't have peace. I can't have joy. Holy Ghost comes and takes all the cans away. I can because he given it to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you deserve it? No. But as like brother would say, no. I aired it. &gt;&gt; We are joint ears with Christ. So I've added joy. I've added peace. Did you earn it? No. Did you work for it? No. I just it. He gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's all mine. &gt;&gt; You know, isn't it, you know, I find it interesting if I was say Elon Musk right now and I had, look, here's my entire fortune in my hand. Who wants it? I tell you what, there'd be a lot of uncchristian behavior going on. &gt;&gt; Let's be honest, okay? and and I say only one person can have it. You can't share it. &gt;&gt; There'd be some uncchristian behavior going on. But then if God says, "Look, here's full restoration. &gt;&gt; Here's salvation. &gt;&gt; Here's here's here's here's peace that takes away all your guilt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've taken your shame, your guilt, your pain, your hurt. I'm going to give you joy and love and peace and and and a stable walk and a true identity." And yet we seem to wrestle with, oh, would he really give it to me? &gt;&gt; There's always this what? &gt;&gt; But it's the same. He's given it without money or price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So why is there a hesitancy? Oh, can I really? We must. Friends, &gt;&gt; this message has come to you that you would know all of heaven is is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He can't lose one of his. Okay. You are I've gone way off my notes but I don't think it matters. Amen. We are his children and he cannot lose one of his. And he will not put us to shame. Amen. He will be glorified in our lives. He will prove his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is not ashamed of you. He's not ashame in your worst moment. He's not ashamed of you. Amen. When you are ashamed of yourself, he's not ashamed of you. He is proud of you. Amen. You are his greatest achievement in existence is you. Oh, with my bad skin flaws. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not like, you know, the devil comes up before him cuz the accuser still has some access. It's going to come to an end soon, &gt;&gt; you know. And he doesn't say, oh, have you considered these guys but not this person, you know, try and like cover you up, you know? You know, like, oh no, don't look here, devil. No. Have you considered my servant? Actually, more than a servant. Have you considered my bride? &gt;&gt; She's part of me. She's bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, life of my life. She is me. &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed. He's proud of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They love me. Amen. They gave their free will over to me because they they willingly have given their lives. They willingly say, "Lord, I want to serve you, Lord." They Hallelujah. You have been He has been looking for you. &gt;&gt; Are we Are we okay this morning? This is probably very elementary, but let's but you got to realize see we wrestle with the skin. &gt;&gt; Let's go beyond the skin. &gt;&gt; Let's go beyond. No, no. There's a gene seed of election. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the foundation, well, God deposited in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we should have very high self-esteem, not pride. Remember, the more I think brother Dean or brother Adrian was saying it there last night, you know, the more the Lord reveals, it just makes a greater awe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation doesn't make a proud spirit. Doesn't make anyone arrogant. It just makes us more humble and thankful and Lord you're so because remember the Lord is sovereign in his giving of revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so he will give you it all. He may give someone on the street just a little bit cuz God has different people in his economy, right? But aren't you so privileged? I'm so glad you think about this. I'm so glad I'm not like like Luther was. Sure, that was God in his day, you know, but smoking a pipe, drinking beer, hating the juice. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he had a little bit of light and that was God's sovereign choosing. And people can be in that same condition in this day, be justified by faith, &gt;&gt; right? I'm glad I'm not in that condition. &gt;&gt; I'm so and I'm not looking down on those people. You must understand, I'm sure you know my heart, right? But I'm so thankful the Lord would actually take me from that and cleanse me and fill me with his presence. Amen. that I know him in the power of his resurrection that when I look at the book of Acts and God coming and dwelling in them, I can say, "Lord, I've had that same kind of experience where the word is put on flesh again." &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that? &gt;&gt; God is God said, "Look, I'm going to I'm going to take the back part of my mind. I'm going to share my heart with you. I'm going to share love secrets with you." Amen. That the world will never see, but I'm going to tell it all to you. I'm going to hold nothing back. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful for that. Now, we got to see where we're going here. Praise the Lord. There's the tabernacle. It's the It's the flesh will be changed, but the Almighty dwelt in that tent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see, it's always been the problem. If thou be the son of God. See, the devil isn't even sure about you. &gt;&gt; If thou be the bride of Christ, do this. Prove it by your life. Prove it by what you do. We aren't here to clown for Satan. &gt;&gt; You know, we're not here to follow his leadership. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if you really are redeemed, would do this and do this and do this. I don't have to listen to him. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't follow his leadership in the wilderness. Why should we follow him? We don't have to prove anything. Our husband has proved it all. Our headship, which is Christ, has proved it all. Amen. He conquered hell, death, and the grave. And he's the one who actually proves his word through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so glad for this. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see even even Jesus when he would be asked you know that you know they tempted him about taxes and all these things and you know Jesus was said give me a penny whose image is this and they could identify a bad drawn image of Caesar on a coin but it was the image of the invisible God holding the coin &gt;&gt; and they couldn't identify God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but what about you and I now when we look at one another? Cuz we should be able to identify the word made flesh in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Oh, yeah. That was in Brother Barham's day. No, it's in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That same God, that same mighty angel is veiled in a multi-membered bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in He's in you and I. If you say the Holy Ghost is in you, that mighty angel Christ unveiled is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's He's now behind these bad skins. So, can we discern? Can we discern now in one another? Can we look beyond the badger skin? Because the more we spend time with each other, the more we see badger skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. The more we see quirks and you know, we get caught up in, oh well, oh well, I can't believe you did that and I can't believe she did that and they're not knowing what they're doing. You know, it's like we never ever I don't know anyone I I I trust I Well, if you're like this, we can pray. But I've never met anyone who wakes up in the morning say, "I'm going to offend that brother today. I've never met I don't mean as a joke but you really you know who wakes up with that kind of plan oh boy we have fun at lunch today sister so and so is really going to get no one's like that but it's our humanity we can offend one another without even meaning it but it's cuz it's bad your skins right but can we look beyond &gt;&gt; that humanity to say no there's deity &gt;&gt; the same God in me is in you amen the same Christ who made how uh who made all things dwells in you and I can we look beyond on this thing &gt;&gt; and identify the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to find this here. Let's just go for it. We We'll come back to this. This is why I I make slides, but I shouldn't because I always just jump around too much. Anyway, it says here, oh, here this one. No, I can't see what's next. But anyway, how the Lord says about Peter would say know Paul would say about communion. Many are sick or weak among you or sleep because they do not discern the Lord's body. Right? It's not about the communion. That's not the Lord's body. That's a symbol of the Lord's body. Right? But what are they not discerning? The Lord's body. &gt;&gt; There's sickness and people are dead because we don't discern the Lord's body. Can we discern the Lord? It's not up there. But you know, can we discern one another? Say, "Listen, I see Jesus in that person. I see Jesus in that young person. I see Jesus in that old person. Can we can we look beyond these things and see him? And he says, "And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God, as God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, I'll receive you, and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Almighty. I'm going to dwell in them and walk in them. &gt;&gt; You get up in the morning, who gets up in the morning? Jesus gets up in the morning. &gt;&gt; You brush your teeth. Who's brushing teeth? Jesus is brushing teeth. You go to school, who goes to school? You go to work, who's going to work? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is going to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm labor. I just I just pray these things sink in more. Especially for myself. You know, &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to dwell in them and walk in them." &gt;&gt; So when you go to a place, you could say, "The Lord Jesus Christ has stepped into the building." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee. I'll be with you and in you to the end of the world." Amen. Not a lesser thing. No. But supreme deity, amen, dwells in you and I. Amen. It's not just a religious spirit that's come into us. It's the Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. I'll come back to this here. He says, "And now the glory of God is behind your skin." That's right. And the traditions don't see it. It's inside it's inside the veil where his word was. What was on the inside of that skin back there, the old badger skins, which there was no beauty that we should desire it. And when it was made flesh and dwelt among us, it was still no beauty that we should desire it. And now the same thing is today. There's nothing in a man or woman that can be desired. Uh it's what's in behind there. That's what it is. Well, you say that fellow I know he used to be a drunkard. He used to do this. I don't care what he used to do. What's hid behind that skin? So it doesn't matter what you used to be. What are you now? Amen. What are if you look at your life now and you were 5 years ago, what are you? Are you closer to the Lord, more humble, &gt;&gt; more like him, more thankful, going from glory to glory. I mean, God is doing a work. Amen. So it's not about what we used to be. I think many times we look at people and and we've taken a photo of them in our mind and it was million years ago. Who cares when it was, you know, like Jurassic period kind of ages ago. No one even remembers what you remember, but you've got the still frame of a person. Oh, that brother I remember. &gt;&gt; They have changed. &gt;&gt; Have you changed? &gt;&gt; They've changed. &gt;&gt; Have they grown? You've grown. &gt;&gt; So why do we keep a photo of someone and we're always looking through that filter at one another? Why can't we allow that we've grown in grace and they have too? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's behind there. That's what counts. See, the people is blinded. The skin blinds the people. See, they say, "I remember when that woman used to. I know what she used to. And what about now?" See, them skins that was once on a badge and now is hiding the glory of God. Got it housed behind it. It was an animal, but now it's housing the glory of God. And so, can your skin be changed tonight to be made a housing place for God? God dwelling in humanity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Moses was a murderer. &gt;&gt; Not even an attempted murderer. He really killed a guy. That's right. &gt;&gt; And yet the Lord used him. God didn't change his mind about Moses. &gt;&gt; He miserably failed &gt;&gt; backside of the desert made a real small comfort zone of a life for 40 years. I'm just a shepherd. I'm a midian. This is, you know, and he just pulled his comfort zone and real small and basically forgot about the promise of God. God didn't forget that Moses had to fulfill his word. Many times we all, especially when we get older, what do we do? We build a very small comfort zone of life. Because when we're young, it's our parents that push us out into a bigger comfort zone. Play this sport. Try this. You're going to school here. You know, all these things are out of our control. But then when we get older, we can choose. Are we going to make our comfort zone bigger or smaller? And normally humans make their comfort zone smaller. Circle of friends gets smaller. Hobbies get less. Become a creature of habit. And our comfort zone gets smaller and smaller and smaller and we're comfortable in it. &gt;&gt; So to get out of that comfort zone, you got to become uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Right? And then it grows. And what does God want us to do? He doesn't want us in a small comfort zone. He doesn't want our life to be very limited in different things that we do. He wants us to go beyond our comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Amen. That God can live through us because when we come to our point where we know, Lord, we can't do this, then he can step in &gt;&gt; and take over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses comfort zone was very small, but he wanted but God wanted to be veiled behind that badge of skin. So, he had to leave all that he knew there, go down to Egypt, and fulfill the promise that was allotted to him to fulfill. It's the same thing with us. Praise God. I'm glad God stirs the nest. &gt;&gt; We get comfortable, got it laid out, everything's just fine, and God says, "No, &gt;&gt; I'm going to change this." &gt;&gt; Trust is okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Apostle Paul, no, we'll go here rather. Because you got to realize, you say, well, I've just got to see brother Brown would make this statement. And he said if you take a teaspoon and you dip it in the ocean, he says all the all the chemicals, all the potentials, everything that the ocean's made of is in that spoon. &gt;&gt; Right? So it doesn't become less of the ocean just cuz it's in a spoon, right? It's the same ocean. So you take the Pacific Ocean or Tasman Sea, whatever's here, you know, it's a if I had in a bottle, I'd say this is the Tasmin Sea. &gt;&gt; You'd say, "No, it's water in the water in a bottle." No, it's not. It's the Tasmin Sea. It's just in a different vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I so so if I took it to the lab and analyzed it, all the nutrients, the chemicals, the minerals, whatever, whatever are in here, right? It's just in a different vessel. And what has God done? That big fountain of eternal life has poured himself into you. He doesn't become less because he's now in a different skin under a different veil. It's exactly the same. Exactly. In power, ability, amen, strength, amen, everything that he is, perseverance, amen, zeal, love, amen, compassion, all that he is is now in you. Amen. He doesn't become less in any way. He's equally the same in you as he is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if now if he is that one and he's overcome all things now, then what can stop us? &gt;&gt; What can stop us this morning? Would it can our comfort zone stop us? Absolutely not. Can a complex stop us? Absolutely not. If the one who conquered all things is in you and I, then nothing nothing can stop him. He's unstoppable. Amen. He's the unstoppable God. So if he's unstoppable and the unstoppable one is in you, then what can stop him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, my past and this is what I've gone through. You know, the Lord allows you to go through things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God uses wounds &gt;&gt; to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; God uses wounds that he can manifest through those wounds. Amen. Just like what he died on Calvary, he was wounded more than any other man. God used those wounds that eternal life would be released upon the earth. But what happens is the devil wants to use the same wounds to bring us into a little shell &gt;&gt; because he doesn't he he hates it when God manifests himself. He knows how God works, right? But God allows wounds to come in that he wants to prove himself. Look at Job. He was wounded. &gt;&gt; He lost his children. He lost everything except for his health. What a massive wound. God allowed that &gt;&gt; because God wanted Job to know, "Job, where were you?" He wanted to ask him a question. &gt;&gt; Job, where were you? Before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; What a question. When the morning stars shouted for joy and all these things, and he allowed him to come on that ash heap with those wounds, not because God was displeased with Job. I know you know these things. Let's just go through it one more time. God was not unhappy with Job. When he said he's a perfect man to his enemy, he wasn't lying. He wasn't embellishing. It was just how it was. &gt;&gt; Job is a perfect And there's Job sitting there with his fear. &gt;&gt; Remember, he would sacrifice on behalf of his children every morning because he was afraid they would sit in their minds. He was actually operating out of fear, though it was according to the word. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, here's Job sitting there with his fears, his worries. What's going to happen to my children? They're adults down there doing this and this and he would and he would intercede on their behalf like any father should, right? But he's living there with his fears. He says, "The fear that I had has come upon me." Who's read that in the book of Job? Right? So there he was. But when God looked at me as a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because God was looking through the blood of the lamb that God instituted for him to offer. Amen. For himself and his family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have more than a blood of a natural lamb, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when God looks at you, he said, "No, you're perfect. You're more than a servant. You're a perfect bride." Amen. But there's but then but then he but Job has these questions. Well, I see flowers, they die, they come forth, trees, you know, he saw the resurrection and botney life. But a man, he dies. Where does he go? &gt;&gt; God allowed wounds to come in. &gt;&gt; That then Job could stand and say, now I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; God allowed those wounds cuz God wanted to reveal to him, "This is where you're going, Job. This is where you were." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where were you, Job? Dancing, shouting before the foundation of the world. So, Job, this ash heap you're on right now, this ain't how I thought of you. &gt;&gt; I thought of you a certain way. You're going to end up that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw us shouting and rejoicing. We're going to end up like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so God allowed those wounds to bring him to that place. You think of Esther in the Bible, Esther had a lot of wounds. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Esther would Esther was an orphan. I I I grew up with both parents and my mom's um mom's parents and my great uncle next to us growing up next door in Gisbon. I had a wonderful childhood. So I don't know what it's like to have a wound of not having a parent or both parents, right? We know God is father to the fatherless, right? So he can heal all those wounds. &gt;&gt; But then if you but then you go back further, look at the things that God allowed for Esther to get to the throne. &gt;&gt; He allowed a split to come into the kingdom. He allowed He allowed the son of Solomon to be risen up in pride and say that my my father you chastise you with whips. I'm going to chastise you with scorpions. I'm going to put the burden greater on you. Cause the split to come into the kingdom. Amen. Cause re Jeroboam to build those two golden calves. There's a domino effect, a ripple effect to get Esther on the throne. There's a reason Esther had to get on the throne. I'm going to probably close with this thought. Okay, so there so so there there they are there, you know, you the two golden calves are made. Idolatry comes into Israel. Nebuchadnezzar come, different ones come along. And now Israel's scattered. And now she finds herself an orphan girl living in Shushan. Didn't go back to Jerusalem. Had no parents, was there with Mori. She's living there with these wounds. There's a re there must been some reason why she wasn't married. &gt;&gt; You know, there must have been a reason why, you know, because you look at this is her life. &gt;&gt; This is a real person. Had real pain, had real wounds. But God allowed the wounds because God had to get her into a position because there was unfinished business with the enemy. Amen. That had to be dealt with because we know Hmon was an Agite who was an Amalachite, right? Cuz King Aad was the king of the Amalachites, the ancient enemy of the Jews. And what happened was King Saul could not do the job that God told him to do. There were these Amalachites running around that had to be dealt with. Amen. So what happens is now King Saul both Saul, Mori and Esther were from the tribe of Benjamin. So there was God would God would allow someone to fail. Well Saul failed from the tribe of Benjamin. God would raise up two people from that same lineage to undo and to break and to bring an end to what their forebe could not do. Amen. It's the same thing with you and I friends. There's things in our lineages that we're not proud of. &gt;&gt; There's family spirits. There's traits. There's things of unforgiveness or bitterness or irreverence or stubbornness or alcohol, you know, um, adultery, whatever it may be, being passed down through. But there's got to come a person raise up that's going to break that thing. Amen. And I believe I'm looking at those kind of people this morning. It doesn't matter what your natural lineage has been down through. God says, I'm going to break that cycle. I mean, I'm going to raise up a believer in that lineage to prove to Satan, Satan, you've injected a lot of things in these people, but my blood, my power, my Holy Ghost is far greater than anything you have done. Any scar, any wound, I'm far greater. I'm going to bring a I'm going to bring a victory through those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, there's Esther now. She's got all these wounds. They they cause her to be in shusha and they cause her to be unmarried. And then she finds herself finding grace in the sight of the king. &gt;&gt; She didn't earn it. She just asked, "Haggy, haggi, I've got no idea what I'm doing. I'm way out of my depth here. How do I dress? What should I do?" Same thing with us. We realize this is great God of heaven and earth. And we realize, man, how do I approach this guy? If I can put it that sorry, you know, but you know, like, Lord, how can I how can I walk with you, Lord? This great holy God. What did he do? He sent he sent brother. He sent Haggi to us. Showed us the heart of the king. &gt;&gt; And then and then what? She found grace in the sight of King of Hazerus. We found grace in the sight of God. And then now finally here here is here is Esther and she knows that Hmon is the ancient enemy of her people. And this is what I love about the message. It reveals who God is. It reveals who you are and it reveals your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like brother Ram says when the seals come open, it just exposes Satan. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now here is here is here is Esther and she's carrying she's got these wounds. She's got this badge of skin that she's dealing with. You know, even even when she goes to the palace, she's told, "Don't even don't even say your name is Hadassa. &gt;&gt; You're Esther. Take on a Persian name, star rising." You know, and uh but but there she is. But she's carrying a secret. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; I know who the enemy is. &gt;&gt; And I know who the king is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here she is. These wounds brought her into that position of power and authority. &gt;&gt; Right? And then what does she do? She knows that in her lays the secret of actually salvation for her people. I mean, she has access to the king that no, no, no one else has. &gt;&gt; You're in the story. You see, you're you're Esther in the You're a greater Esther than she was. She was pointing to you. I mean, God has placed you in a position of authority and power. Amen. God has made you one with him. Amen. You are part of him. Are we not? Are we not the feminist part of God? &gt;&gt; If I say it that way. Your God is God has made you a certain way. wounds have come in to allow you to get to this place. And then now what does she do? She has the banquet of wines. The first one, hallelujah. God loves worship. God loves a stimulation of revelation of the word. It moves his heart. Amen. To see a people not responding mechanically or this is expected of him. But this is a love comes out as a response. Amen. For what God has poured in. Amen. And what does it do? It makes the king restless. I don't think there's any record of in your in the book of Esther where the king can't sleep until after that first banquet of wines and he can't sleep. He says, "Now give me the records of the kingdom." So now what happens is is is is is a record that was sealed up, you know, is opened and a particular place was found that records what Mori did to save the king's life. Amen. You say the seals came off the book. Amen. And now what happens is when the book comes open, there's now a role reversal. Amen. Because before the book came open, amen mean the Jews, Esther, um, Mori, they're under a death sentence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; By Hmon, they're living under a death sentence. But now when the book came open, it's actually a total reverser of roles. Cuz now Hmon is coming under a death sentence. Amen. Because the king's heart has been moved. Amen. Cuz why? A woman who has wounds is not worried about her bad skin, but knows her position. Amen. Comes in before the king and has this banquet of wines and moves the heart of the king. And then she has a second banquet. And then now what happens? There's a question. &gt;&gt; What can I do for you? &gt;&gt; What can I do for you, Esther? She's carrying a secret cuz even the king doesn't know who she is. &gt;&gt; And then she intercedes on behalf of her people. And what happens? The wrath of the king is turned against her enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his own scheme is what he hung on. &gt;&gt; Amen. His own gallows he made hung himself. right now. I tell you what, friends, there's there's there's devices that have been put against our families and put against people, put against yourselves. But I tell you what, friends, no weapon formed against you shall prosper. Amen. No weapon is going to prosper against you. Amen. Every tongue that rise in judgment against you, thou shalt condemn. Amen. You've got to condemn the accuser's tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to stand up and say, "No, I'm as righteous as God is righteous. I'm as spotless as God is spotless. I mean, I'm as sinless as God is sinless. Why? By your own flawlessness? No. But by his atonement, his atoning grace. Amen. His atoning blood. I'm as sinless as he is. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say that? Yeah, I can. &gt;&gt; Because an atonement is what? You become at one. It's at onement. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, there's an at onement that takes place. Amen. You and you and God become one unit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, she intercedes for her family. &gt;&gt; He gets hung. And then now the signant ring that was on his finger gets placed on your finger. Amen. And now she writes a law that overshadows what the enemy has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they win a great victory. Not once but twice. Go read in the book of Esther. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If she could do that, she's pointing to you. &gt;&gt; She's pointing to you. Amen. Don't let wounds, don't let bad your skin, don't let any of these things or oh yes, it's just some some spirit in me that's less of God. No, it's all of God &gt;&gt; is in the believer. Supreme deity doesn't just dwell in heaven. It dwells in you. Amen. So, what people ought we to be. Amen. Oh, I'm just a little person. No, no, you're a big person. &gt;&gt; You got a big daddy. &gt;&gt; Your daddy can beat up all the daddies. &gt;&gt; He's God. Why do we Why do we shrink back? No. We're going to take God at his word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She was fearless in what she had to do cuz she realized, well, if I perish, I perish. My life's not my own. Are we not in the same bracket? Our life is not our own. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why Why do we keep silent? We're so afraid God's going to get angry at us when he loves us with an unfailing love. Why don't we turn the wrath of God against some evil spirit that's been afflicting our family? Amen. Some some trouble that's plaguing us. Why don't we turn his wrath against our enemy? Amen. Well, how do you do that? Create an atmosphere around you. Let the Holy Ghost because he's within us, right? But we're going to surrender this thing to him that he can come and take control. Why don't we let the Holy Ghost, that great presence of divine love flow out of our lives? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know you can impart eternal life? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm ask you asked a question. I don't know where it is in here, but he says, you know, can a what's the greater works? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says it's to impart eternal life. He says, can can you do it? He says, well, a son of God can &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A son of God can impart eternal life. Well, how do I do that? Do I just go here and say he's eternal life? &gt;&gt; No. You create an atmosphere around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You create an atmosphere of the presence of God. Amen. Where where people come under the his influence, not your human influence, his influence. Amen. What happens then? They just drop right into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't do that. Jesus is the only Where is he? &gt;&gt; Where is he? What what vocal cords is he going to anoint &gt;&gt; to speak to people? &gt;&gt; Oh, they're waiting to hear from God and God's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What What are we afraid of? Or what might happen? Well, if it's God doing it, God will do it. &gt;&gt; We don't need to be afraid. But you can impart eternal life. That's why we have family altars. That's why we pray. That's why we have a loving disposition, right? That's why we're friendly. &gt;&gt; That's why we're kind. That's why we're thoughtful. That's why people when they see us, they say, "That person's a really nice person. Yep. &gt;&gt; Why? Because what is that? It's actually an influence. You're praying, "Lord, may you now influence that person &gt;&gt; that eternal life can be imparted." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I think I've just finished. Wait, let's see what else we got. I'm having fun now. He says here, "And if a man says he's born again," wait, let's just drop here. Jesus said in Mark 16, "These signs shall follow in the belief into all the world to every age, casting out demons, uh speaking with tongues and all these great manifestations, gifts that would follow. They shall, not they ought, they may, may be, they ought to, they will. And heaven and earth will pass away, his word won't." So, it's Christ expressing himself in the individual, whether he's intellectual or whether he doesn't know his ABCs. He says half the apostles didn't know it. That's right. But they know Christ. They never taken heed to Peter and John, knowing that they had been out of some seminary. They said they taken heed and notice that they had been with Christ. When they healed the lay man see at the gate they know that they had been with Christ. The new birth is Christ is a revelation. God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth. Now what are you going to do when you get all that grouped together? I mean where the revelation is perfect in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same action same things that he did making the word manifest. Oh if the church only knew its position it will one day. Then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; I know you've probably heard these quotes over and over again, but I tell you what, friends, if we only knew our position. &gt;&gt; I believe we do, &gt;&gt; but we let this thing &gt;&gt; rob us of what God has placed us to be. I mean, what is this when you when you when they all get together that you that group get together, what does this revelation talking about? Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we let the Lord just take control in a greater way. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we let Lord flow through us Lord as I worship Lord may may you worship through me. When I say amen may be you amening your word Lord. I mean when the preacher stands there and preaches Lord may it just be him or maybe you through him completely. The song leader the musicians when we go into the street we talk to people. May it be a worship. &gt;&gt; I mean a a love and a joy that flows out of us. Doesn't matter what day we're going through. You know those things are irrelevant. We all have troubles and trials and all those things. But don't let that thing be the main focus in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who do we worship? Do we worship our problems? &gt;&gt; No. Some people, they let it affect them too much. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't bear we don't have ostrich faith. Ostriches bury their head in the sand, right? We don't bury our head in the sand and pretend there's no problems. We acknowledge these things. But brother Ram says that real overcoming is recognizing the one in you has already overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's already overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we get this group together and and I believe this group is together where the Lord can manifest himself down through. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if we only knew our position, it will one day the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to finish with this if I can find it. You say, "Well, You know, people people wrestle with people want to diminish the power of the blood. They want to diminish what Christ has done for us. Now, Paul, when he spoke about Levi paying tithes, he didn't say he figuratively paid tithes when he was in Abraham. He didn't say he was figuratively in Abraham, right? He said he was literally in Abraham &gt;&gt; when when when Abraham paid tithes. And so what Abraham did was attributed to Levi. &gt;&gt; He's he literally said that le I'm just reading the scripture, but I don't know if you've read it this way. This dawned on me a while ago. I thought, "Praise God." Amen. So So Paul is literally saying when Abraham literally paid tithe to Melzdc, Levi was in him. And what Abraham did was attributed to Levi. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now when So everything that Abraham did there was attributed to Levi. Levi didn't even know where he was. He was he he wasn't even conscious of what was going on. But he was in Abraham and the deeds of Abraham were attributed to Levi. Okay? So now you take the deeds of Christ because we were in him, right? We were in him. So everything he did is attributed to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what did he do? He he turned down the devil's lie &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. He conquered hell, death, and the grave. Amen. He he he conquered culture. He conquered expectations. He conquered disappointments. He conquered rejection. He conquered all these things. Everything that can be named, he conquered. Amen. And then when he did that, because you were in him, it's attributed to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why, you know, you hear the word, you hear the gospel, and something says, "Yes, Lord. That's right. Why that recognition comes?" Because it's attributed to you cuz you're in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. The book comes open. Amen. You realize Christ is here unveiled. You say, "Yes, Lord. That sounds so I've never heard a voice like this voice." Amen. What's happening is you're realizing that redemption is attributed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not not not figuratively. No, literally. &gt;&gt; Literally. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was in Christ when he was on Calvary. Oh, does that mean I paid for my sin? Absolutely not. He did it all, but I was in him. And so, what he did is attributed to me. And that's why we're joint ears. &gt;&gt; Oh, did you do it? I did nothing. &gt;&gt; He did it all because I'm part of him. It's attributed to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If he conquered, see this why I say friends, if that great God is in you, what can hinder you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do we let hinder us? &gt;&gt; See, we have a free moral agency. Do we let complexes hinder us? &gt;&gt; Do we let our past hinder us? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do we let shame or who am I or upbringing? Do we let these things hinder us or we say no, I can do all things through Christ Jesus which strengthens me. &gt;&gt; Who do you let rule? &gt;&gt; I'm just maybe finish with that question. If we we have the musicians this morning, I say tell you what, friends. If he's in you, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing can stop you. The prince of God was brought, the ark was brought to the temple of Deeon, &gt;&gt; that idol fell down on its face. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when those two anointings came into people, &gt;&gt; Goliath fell down on his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. He fell down forward, not backward. Amen. showing that what God did in the temple of Deaeon when those two anointings became men. &gt;&gt; Amen. That spirit fell down on its face. I tell you what, friends, greater than David is in you. Amen. The God of David is in you. Amen. I tell you what, you take this word. You say, "I've only got a slingshot." You don't even need a slingshot. Amen. You just take what you've got. I tell you've got more. You've got more than you realize. You're packing a weapon that made the world. Amen. You're packing a weapon that cannot be defeated. Amen. But God will you got to speak it across your lips in faith. Take God at his word. Confess his promises back to him. Amen. Then the high priest himself can can can can manifest what you have confessed. If you confess you're nothing and my bad skins and I've got these problems, all these things, God's basically saying, look buddy, I can't help you. But if you confess, no Lord, I'm made in your image because of your blood. I'm sinless. Lord, I'm your bride. Amen. Lord, you've called me. You're keeping me. You've saved me. Lord, you're my counselor. You're my guide. You'll guide me through these things. Lord, you're greater than my first birth, my lineage, your complexes, whatever. Lord, you're greater than all those things. Then the then the Lord says, "Good. Now I can work. Now I can take them at their confession and I begin to work." Amen. And you watch God, the miraculous, step in. Amen. And do the supreme. Praise the Lord. Amen. I believe it myself. God is more than able to do anything. So is anything too hard for the Lord? Not one thing. Why does he allow these things things to happen to us? He wants to prove his word in you and I. So, let's do it, shall we? Let's let God prove his word like never before. Amen. Let's stand, shall we, this morning? Amen. Let's pray that I'll turn the service to to to brother Al and Amen. So, who wants to go out of their comfort zone, go out of their way doing things and go beyond, step into, Amen. into the presence of God in a greater way. Amen. And I've got my I got both hands raised. Let's pray together. If you want to be a member of prayer, raise your hands. Amen. Gracious heavenly father, just pray you take these chopped up words, Lord. Lord, I just ask that we would realize, Lord, when we when you come and dwell in us, you're not a lesser God. You're not a third person of a godhead or a religious spirit that's trying to win or get control or you're with equal power to the enemy. But Lord, you're the supreme one. You're the Lord God Almighty. You're the Almighty God deity. And Lord Jesus, as your prophet told us, dead yet, he doesn't just dwell in heaven. It dwells in us. So, Father, I pray, dear God, when we go out these doors we go. Lord, we face whatever we're facing. Help us to get beyond our comfort zone. Help us to look beyond our badge of skin, Lord, our complexes, pains, hurts, questions, whatever it is, Lord. May we look beyond those things, Father. Because, Lord, we know the one, Lord, the the part of us that really matters, Lord, is you within us, dear God. So, Father, may we just let us, Lord, just may we just surrender our lives completely into your hands. Lord, come step into our problems. Step into our trials. I'm speaking very much to myself, Lord. I ask, Lord, step into what we're going through, dear God. Father, may not I don't want to rely on my mind, my thinking, my ability. Lord, I just want you to take over like never before. So, Father, may you grant it, dear God. I ask, Father, we just have such a revelation, Lord, that you dwell in us, dear God. The almighty God that was there before time began is within us, Lord. We just want to commit our lives into your hands. May we be like Esther, Father. Lord God, come boldly before your throne of grace, Lord, to Lord, to deal with the enemy, Lord, that Lord, that we're facing against dear God. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this morning.
