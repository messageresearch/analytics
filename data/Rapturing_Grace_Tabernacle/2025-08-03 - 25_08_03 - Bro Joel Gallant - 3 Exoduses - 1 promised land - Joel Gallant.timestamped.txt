[52:34] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[52:38] Amen. My
[52:41] I thought after that special that the
[52:44] sisters sang, I thought we we could all
[52:48] go home already.
[52:50] I was so blessed. I thought from now on
[52:53] everything is just icing on the cake.
[52:56] Hallelujah. Thank you sisters for this
[52:59] amazing special.
[53:01] And uh let us not waste time tonight and
[53:05] turn to our Bibles in Joshua chapter 1.
[53:30] Joshua chapter 1 from verse 1 to verse
[53:34] 3.
[53:38] If you got it, say amen.
[53:45] After the death of Moses, the servant of
[53:48] the Lord,
[53:49] it came to pass that the Lord spoke to
[53:52] Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses'
[53:54] assistant, saying, "Moses, my servant,
[53:58] is dead. Now, therefore,
[54:01] arise, go over this Jordan,
[54:05] you and all this people, to the land
[54:08] which I am giving to them, the children
[54:11] of Israel.
[54:13] Every place
[54:15] that the sole of your foot will tread
[54:17] upon, I have given you as I said to
[54:22] Moses.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[54:26] Thank you, Father, for your presence
[54:29] among us tonight. We can already feel
[54:33] your presence in this place.
[54:36] But but I pray this presence will anoint
[54:42] the ear of our understanding tonight and
[54:45] and would you come and anoint my lips,
[54:48] Lord, that we may all receive a portion
[54:51] that you have in store. Come, I ask and
[54:55] break once more the bread of life for us
[54:57] tonight
[54:59] that we may eat
[55:02] and be filled.
[55:04] I commit this service into your hands in
[55:07] Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated.
[55:12] Amen. I'm glad to be back. I
[55:17] just want to tell in case you know I I
[55:20] know sometimes the midweek services uh
[55:24] there are less people in the house and I
[55:27] just want to take the opportunity to
[55:29] tell you how much uh
[55:32] a great bunch of people you are and I
[55:34] appreciate it getting to know more a lot
[55:38] of you guys this uh this past week and
[55:41] especially this afternoon on the
[55:43] fellowship. you and um I hope we can see
[55:49] each other on this side of heaven,
[55:52] but if not, we'll see each other on the
[55:54] other side.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. This morning, we spoke about the
[55:59] fact that many Christians
[56:02] haven't experienced
[56:04] the Exodus yet.
[56:06] Maybe they ran out of Egypt,
[56:09] but they ran to a church, not the
[56:12] promised land.
[56:15] And uh so we have mostly focused this
[56:18] morning on the exile instead of the
[56:21] exodus and how a lot of Christians
[56:25] instead of you know walking this exodus
[56:28] in their lives they walk the exile
[56:31] down to a little church a little formal
[56:33] church in med mighty
[56:36] Midian
[56:38] we say it different in French so it's uh
[56:42] and so let's just do do a quick recap of
[56:47] uh what we spoke about this morning.
[56:52] And uh this is what I call the authentic
[56:56] or true
[56:59] uh journey of the Christian. This is
[57:02] what most of us have experienced or will
[57:06] experience. And it's a little bit more
[57:08] complicated than what it could be.
[57:12] Uh because a lot of us left Egypt for
[57:15] exile.
[57:17] Um and then we have we have to realize
[57:21] that from exile we have to go back to
[57:24] Egypt to take what belongs to us because
[57:28] we cannot leave anybody behind. And
[57:32] Exodus is bringing everybody and
[57:34] everything with us.
[57:38] And then we go through the desert
[57:42] and into the promised land.
[57:44] And so tonight my title will be
[57:48] three exoduses and one promised land.
[57:53] Three exodus and one promised land. And
[57:57] um there are three. We've touched on
[58:00] that this morning. We all know that. But
[58:03] uh the first two we tend to look at them
[58:05] as history
[58:08] &gt;&gt; and focus on the third
[58:11] &gt;&gt; because you know the third is our exodus
[58:13] and and we just focus on this one. Uh
[58:16] but that is wrong.
[58:20] We cannot walk the third exodus
[58:24] before we have walked the first two.
[58:30] We have to walk all three exodus.
[58:34] And so let's go back to that quote from
[58:36] this morning where brother Brandham
[58:39] says, "God is in that message of
[58:41] repentance to the church nomino. He has
[58:44] to because it's an exodus.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And God is in that message of divine
[58:49] healing to the church Pentecostal. He
[58:51] has to because it's an exodus. And God
[58:55] is in the message to the bride. See, so
[58:57] we find out that all of them calling one
[59:00] to this, this to that, and that to that.
[59:03] God calling the church out of the world,
[59:06] first Exodus.
[59:08] Calling the church in the denominational
[59:11] church into Pentecost,
[59:13] second Exodus, and calling the bride out
[59:16] of Pentecost. Third Exodus.
[59:20] And so tonight we want to take some time
[59:22] to look at every exodus and hopefully
[59:25] reach the promised land tonight.
[59:28] Amen. And so the first exodus really is
[59:34] is us coming out of the slavery
[59:38] of the world. It's really our conversion
[59:43] or what we could u call our
[59:46] justification.
[59:48] And really by the help of God, I hope to
[59:51] be able to tie the exodus with
[59:54] justification, sanctification, and
[59:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it'll in
[59:59] a way that will make so much sense into
[1:00:02] our Christian walks. And and really uh I
[1:00:06] found out in in most churches, you know,
[1:00:10] these words, justification,
[1:00:11] sanctification,
[1:00:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost are almost
[1:00:15] buzzwords
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; really. And if even if you take a look
[1:00:19] on the table and you write
[1:00:21] justification,
[1:00:22] you know, out of the maybe 130 times it
[1:00:25] appears
[1:00:27] 125 times it says by Luther or by faith,
[1:00:32] which basically means that the prophet
[1:00:35] doesn't come to restore the truth about
[1:00:38] justification. It has already been
[1:00:40] restored by Luther.
[1:00:43] Um therefore we never really hear about
[1:00:46] it in our churches. It's just a buzz
[1:00:49] word, you know, justification
[1:00:51] by faith and we move forward. But it's
[1:00:54] just so much goodness and so much truth
[1:01:00] um in this just Luther spent his whole
[1:01:03] life talking about justification only
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; his whole life. My there's so much there
[1:01:12] but really tonight for the sake of time
[1:01:15] it's going to be in a nutshell but but
[1:01:17] really the reason this first exodus I
[1:01:20] type with justification is because when
[1:01:24] God picks you up of this mess this Egypt
[1:01:27] of the world truly you are chosen he
[1:01:31] picks you up from the ground and and
[1:01:34] that is justification really is being
[1:01:37] chosen redeemed washed by the water of
[1:01:41] the word. Um God said about the first
[1:01:44] exodus, I have remembered my people.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That is justification or part of it at
[1:01:51] least. Just like a car owner, let's say
[1:01:55] you have an old car that is in the back
[1:01:57] of the field, you know, and and grass
[1:02:00] growing around it, but but all of a
[1:02:03] sudden you remember that you have this
[1:02:05] old car in the field and and and you go
[1:02:09] out and you take it out of the field and
[1:02:12] you pressure wash the thing and you put
[1:02:14] a new motor in it. You know, you get it
[1:02:17] going again. You've just redeemed this
[1:02:21] car. You've just justified it.
[1:02:25] You've chosen it and you you you've
[1:02:27] given it a purpose yet or a new purpose,
[1:02:30] let's say.
[1:02:32] And uh that is that first exodus.
[1:02:36] Justification is is a divine exchange
[1:02:40] where God
[1:02:42] uh Ezekiel 36 where God puts in you a
[1:02:46] new heart. It takes away your heart of
[1:02:49] stone
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; and gives you a heart of flesh.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; A heart transplant. It's a new motor in
[1:02:56] the car. It changes your old desires.
[1:03:01] It changes I mean before justification
[1:03:06] you wanted to live a life of your own.
[1:03:09] Go about your own desires and instinct.
[1:03:13] But when your heart is changed, now you
[1:03:16] have a desire to please God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Now you, if you have a new heart, then
[1:03:23] you have new desires.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And we'll get to that a little later.
[1:03:28] And and now you want to please God,
[1:03:32] but it seems you cannot.
[1:03:35] And Paul talks about it, and we'll get
[1:03:37] to that later, but um just, you know,
[1:03:40] laying a foundation again. The second
[1:03:42] exodus
[1:03:44] is an exodus out of the slavery of the
[1:03:48] law.
[1:03:51] And that exodus is sanctification.
[1:03:55] And sanctification, my friends, is so
[1:03:58] misunderstood.
[1:04:00] You know, I've been preaching in my
[1:04:02] church on justification for like 13
[1:04:06] weeks straight.
[1:04:08] There is so much to dig in justification
[1:04:12] and and I mean the church is loving it
[1:04:14] and everybody's saying amen but
[1:04:19] but you know justification by faith it's
[1:04:23] great but when are we going to get to
[1:04:25] the real stuff
[1:04:28] sanctification because we don't want
[1:04:30] people to do any anything you know and
[1:04:32] just we need sanctification
[1:04:36] Right?
[1:04:38] But my friends, sanctification is not
[1:04:41] adding law to faith.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; It's not. But if you preach
[1:04:46] justification too long, the people are
[1:04:49] sit in the pews and they're like, "Okay,
[1:04:51] good. But when do you come up with the
[1:04:54] laws? We need the church to run real
[1:04:57] straight."
[1:04:58] But just sanctification is not adding
[1:05:01] law to faith. In fact, law is what you
[1:05:06] need when you are not sanctified.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Law is what you need when you are not
[1:05:19] sanctified.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, they missed his
[1:05:27] visitation. All the religious people
[1:05:30] missed who he was. Have you ever
[1:05:32] wondered why? I mean, they were studying
[1:05:35] the book. They knew the prophecies. They
[1:05:39] were waiting for a Messiah.
[1:05:41] Why did they miss who he was?
[1:05:45] You see, the reason they missed who he
[1:05:47] was is because the Jewish people were
[1:05:50] slaves to two things when Jesus came.
[1:05:53] They were slaves to the Romans, meaning
[1:05:56] slave to the world. And they were slave
[1:05:59] to Judaism, slave to the law.
[1:06:03] But the people wanted out of Rome. They
[1:06:06] were fine with the law.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; In fact, they love the law.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; They wanted a Messiah. Yes. But they
[1:06:14] wanted a Messiah to deliver them from
[1:06:16] the Roman Empire.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; But none of them were hoping to be freed
[1:06:21] from the law.
[1:06:24] So when Jesus came, they couldn't
[1:06:26] receive him because he wasn't fitting
[1:06:29] their idea of a Messiah.
[1:06:32] Amen.
[1:06:34] But Paul says in Colossians
[1:06:37] chapter 2,
[1:06:39] he says, "And you being dead in your
[1:06:41] trespasses, in the circumcision
[1:06:44] of your flesh, he has made alive
[1:06:46] together with him,
[1:06:49] having forgiven all your trespasses,
[1:06:52] having wiped,
[1:06:55] having wiped out, he got rid of
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; the handwriting of requirements that was
[1:07:02] against us
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; which was contrary to us and he has
[1:07:07] taken it out of the way having nailed it
[1:07:10] to the cross.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:17] What Paul is saying here is that Jesus
[1:07:21] came, we've been saying it all all since
[1:07:24] this morning, but Jesus came to nail the
[1:07:28] law to the cross
[1:07:31] to take it out of the way for us
[1:07:34] so that we can be sanctified
[1:07:39] not by the law but by the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:42] But the guy writing this letter to the
[1:07:44] Colossians,
[1:07:46] it's Paul, formerly Saul.
[1:07:49] This guy was the most fervent
[1:07:52] practitioner of Judaism
[1:07:54] in the whole country.
[1:07:56] He has studied with the greatest teacher
[1:07:58] of Judaism, Nealiel.
[1:08:01] And he believed he was pleasing God as
[1:08:05] he was literally opposed to what God was
[1:08:08] doing now.
[1:08:11] And we should always be careful,
[1:08:13] brothers, sisters, when we oppose
[1:08:16] something,
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; believing we are pleasing God because we
[1:08:22] might as well be opposing what God is
[1:08:25] doing now as we are defending what God
[1:08:28] did yesterday.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; But here, Paul is doing a 180 degrees
[1:08:35] from Judaism and saying that Jesus
[1:08:37] nailed the law to the cross. He says
[1:08:40] earlier in that chapter that
[1:08:42] circumcision is no longer required.
[1:08:45] That's almost blasphemy.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; He says that Christ circumcises hearts
[1:08:53] by his grace. And he also says all
[1:08:56] things are lawful.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I mean not some things. All things are
[1:09:04] lawful. That's quite a change of belief.
[1:09:07] It happened when he met God face to
[1:09:09] face.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; And it is a very sad picture for me to
[1:09:15] realize most Christians are still slave
[1:09:18] to the law.
[1:09:21] Most Christians haven't walked the
[1:09:23] second exodus yet
[1:09:26] out of the law and into grace.
[1:09:30] Now you say, "Brother Joel, are you
[1:09:33] insinuating that there is no more law?"
[1:09:40] That is quite frightening, isn't it? No
[1:09:42] more laws.
[1:09:46] There will be quite a party
[1:09:49] in the church if there's no more law.
[1:09:53] Pastor, we at least need to keep some
[1:09:55] laws going. You know, it's just for the
[1:09:59] benefit of the church.
[1:10:01] Let's at least try to keep some.
[1:10:04] Here's what I say.
[1:10:06] Tell me by what law Abraham lived,
[1:10:12] and I will tell you by what law I live.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Me, a son of Abraham.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not a son of Moses.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm a son of Abraham.
[1:10:26] You see, before Mount Si, there was no
[1:10:30] law
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; or was it?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Was there a law before Mount Si?
[1:10:41] Did Abraham live by the law of Moses?
[1:10:45] There was not even a Bible in the days
[1:10:48] of Abraham.
[1:10:50] No laws were written. Okay. Not one,
[1:10:55] not one law was written.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Tell me then,
[1:11:01] why did Abraham pay tithing to
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Melisedc?
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; The laws about tithing. They came only
[1:11:09] in Leviticus
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; hundreds and hundreds of years later.
[1:11:16] Why did he pay tithing to MelkiseDC if
[1:11:18] there was no law about tithing?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I'm interested.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Let's see the account that God gives of
[1:11:28] Abraham.
[1:11:30] The account that God gives of Abraham.
[1:11:34] Genesis 26,
[1:11:36] the Lord says, "I will give to your
[1:11:39] descendants
[1:11:41] all these lands,
[1:11:44] and in your seed all the nations of the
[1:11:46] earth shall be blessed." Why? Because
[1:11:49] Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my
[1:11:53] charge, my commandments, my statutes,
[1:11:56] and my laws.
[1:12:00] Which law?
[1:12:05] You see, Abraham lived in the days of
[1:12:09] the personal relationship with God
[1:12:13] where God would speak to him directly
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; in his heart
[1:12:20] and let him know his will.
[1:12:23] Abraham wanted to please God, not
[1:12:26] himself.
[1:12:29] But the people out of Egypt,
[1:12:32] they didn't want that relationship.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; They wanted to be told what to do.
[1:12:39] They asked for a law.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Moses told them, "Go to go to mount the
[1:12:45] mount. Go and hear God speak." But they
[1:12:49] didn't want to go.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; They said, "Go yourself, hear God, and
[1:12:54] tell us what it is." Yeah,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; it was too costly.
[1:13:02] It was too costly for them to have a
[1:13:07] personal relationship with God.
[1:13:11] Ten Commandments was much easier.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this. with all these laws
[1:13:23] and commandments.
[1:13:27] Were God's people a holy people?
[1:13:33] Did it work?
[1:13:36] Did the law make them holy?
[1:13:41] Come on. Is anyone reading the Bibles?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Was God Was God's people sanctified
[1:13:49] people with all these commandments?
[1:13:52] Samson sleeps, you know, with a
[1:13:55] prostitute before going to his mistress.
[1:13:59] That's pretty much what the Old
[1:14:00] Testament looks like.
[1:14:06] They had the laws and commandments,
[1:14:09] yet they were unsanctified nor holy.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Then tell me,
[1:14:16] why would you why would you want to keep
[1:14:19] going in that direction?
[1:14:22] When twothirds of your Bible, like
[1:14:24] twothirds of your Bible
[1:14:28] is written to let you know it doesn't
[1:14:30] work.
[1:14:34] It doesn't work.
[1:14:39] And this is why sanctification is not
[1:14:43] adding law to your faith.
[1:14:47] It's not
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; sanctification
[1:14:51] is grace
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; and it happens when you walk the second
[1:14:57] exodus
[1:14:59] from law to grace. And I would encourage
[1:15:03] you know any anyone tonight as you go
[1:15:06] back home to read Colossians chapter 2
[1:15:08] the whole chapter if you can or this
[1:15:12] week just meditating on this sermon. Go
[1:15:15] back to Colossians chapter 2 and read
[1:15:17] the whole thing. You see, sanctification
[1:15:21] is the renewing of our minds.
[1:15:25] Here's what Paul says.
[1:15:27] And do not be conformed to this world
[1:15:32] by having a set of rules
[1:15:35] and a dress code and a church book. No.
[1:15:39] But be transformed
[1:15:42] by the renewing of your mind, that you
[1:15:44] may prove what what is that good and
[1:15:46] acceptable and perfect will of God, that
[1:15:50] he may be like Abraham,
[1:15:53] discerning what which is good and and
[1:15:56] doing the perfect will of God in your
[1:15:59] life.
[1:16:02] That is what sanctification is.
[1:16:05] Because you see, when you are truly
[1:16:08] justified,
[1:16:09] your desires are changed
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; because you have a new heart.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; But the problem with justification alone
[1:16:18] and a lot of churches out there, they
[1:16:20] they speak about justification alone and
[1:16:24] we see the results. You've seen the
[1:16:26] results. In modern churches talking only
[1:16:29] about justification and that's why you
[1:16:31] want to add some laws to it. We all want
[1:16:34] we all tend to because we don't want to
[1:16:36] look that like these modern worldly
[1:16:39] churches. So we think adding a few laws
[1:16:42] will help us.
[1:16:44] But that is not true.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; The problem with justification alone is
[1:16:50] that after a while
[1:16:53] you get miserable.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. At first, you're you have a revival
[1:16:58] because you've been picked out of the
[1:16:59] field and you've been washed and you've
[1:17:03] been given a new motor, a new heart, you
[1:17:06] know, and you're all excited about it.
[1:17:09] And now you want to please your master
[1:17:12] and and if you're if you are a car
[1:17:14] that's being restored, let's keep this
[1:17:16] analogy. Now, you want to drive around.
[1:17:19] I mean, you want to please your master.
[1:17:22] So, you're trying to drive around, but
[1:17:23] you can't move forward. You have no
[1:17:26] transmission and you can't break. You
[1:17:27] have no brakes and you can't steer. You
[1:17:30] have no steering wheel.
[1:17:33] And so you have a desire to please but
[1:17:36] you don't have the capacity.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And uh just a little bit earlier in his
[1:17:44] letters to Romans, Paul speaks of how
[1:17:48] you feel being justified after a while.
[1:17:51] You feel miserable and wretched. It's in
[1:17:54] Romans chapter 7.
[1:17:57] You know this this uh chapter, but I've
[1:18:00] just taken a small part of it. For I
[1:18:02] delight in the law of God according to
[1:18:06] the inward man. Paul's saying here, I
[1:18:09] have a new heart.
[1:18:12] I delight in the law of God. With your
[1:18:15] whole heart of stone, you couldn't
[1:18:16] delight in it.
[1:18:19] But I see another law in my members,
[1:18:22] wearing against the law of my mind, and
[1:18:25] bringing me into captivity of the law of
[1:18:27] sin, which is in my members,
[1:18:30] oh wretched man that I am, who will
[1:18:32] deliver me from this body of death?
[1:18:35] Who will do it? I thank God through
[1:18:38] Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:18:42] He's the one who's going to do it. what
[1:18:44] Paul is explaining here. And some people
[1:18:46] get stuck here and they think they have
[1:18:49] to live their own lives
[1:18:52] miserable and wretched
[1:18:55] loving the law of God in their heart.
[1:18:58] But but just as Paul mentions in Romans
[1:19:00] 7, when I try to do the good that I
[1:19:03] want, I do the bad that I want not.
[1:19:06] And Christians, many Christians think
[1:19:09] that's the state they they have to live
[1:19:11] in for the rest of their lives, wanting
[1:19:14] to please God in their hearts, but being
[1:19:17] unable to.
[1:19:19] But this is just a state of the
[1:19:22] Christian walk. It's the state you live
[1:19:25] in when you have walked only the first
[1:19:27] exodus.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Now your heart is changed. You're
[1:19:30] justified. You want to do what is good,
[1:19:33] but you can't.
[1:19:35] You can't or you have to force yourself,
[1:19:41] right?
[1:19:44] And that's why sanctification is the
[1:19:46] renewing of the mind. Paul says just a
[1:19:49] couple chapters later, he says, "Be
[1:19:52] transformed by the renewing of the
[1:19:54] mind." which which means now that you
[1:19:58] have the desire to please God but are
[1:20:01] not able to
[1:20:04] let Christ let the Holy Ghost renew your
[1:20:07] mind. Let the teacher come and teach you
[1:20:10] how to submit your body to the desires
[1:20:12] of your heart and live accordingly.
[1:20:18] But the problem with law as means of
[1:20:21] sanctification
[1:20:23] is people cross the door of the church
[1:20:26] and we don't even want to know if their
[1:20:27] hearts were changed. We want them to
[1:20:29] comply
[1:20:31] and so they end up you know doing things
[1:20:35] that their heart desire not.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Therefore they're stuck in a religion.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I haven't asked your pastor for
[1:20:47] permission to say this, but uh I'll say
[1:20:50] it anyways.
[1:20:53] Sisters,
[1:20:55] if you feel like wearing pants, you
[1:20:57] should.
[1:21:04] If your heart's desire change,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; your deeds are filthy rags.
[1:21:12] It all starts from the first exodus.
[1:21:15] You need a heart change. You need your
[1:21:19] desires to be changed.
[1:21:22] Then from there you can move into grace,
[1:21:26] not into law. Move into grace where the
[1:21:29] Holy Ghost starts renewing your mind
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; and teaching you how to submit your body
[1:21:36] to the desires of your heart.
[1:21:41] I have to move away from this. But
[1:21:45] I want you to consider how
[1:21:48] here in Romans 7, it's not called the
[1:21:51] law of Moses.
[1:21:55] It's called the law of God.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And and up to Romans chapter 7, really,
[1:22:04] it's called the law of Moses. You know
[1:22:06] the Pharisees, they go around and they
[1:22:08] have the law of Moses
[1:22:11] uh be be respected amongst their people,
[1:22:15] Judaism.
[1:22:16] But here Paul is talking is speaking
[1:22:19] about something different.
[1:22:21] He's speaking about the law of God.
[1:22:28] How can you delight in the law of God?
[1:22:30] It's because you are justified. You have
[1:22:32] a new heart and new desires, but you are
[1:22:35] not sanctified yet. You have not been
[1:22:38] made capable of doing in your body what
[1:22:41] your heart longs for. This is the state
[1:22:44] Paul speaks about here. Now,
[1:22:47] sanctification
[1:22:48] is a work of grace
[1:22:52] by the spirit.
[1:22:54] The teacher
[1:22:56] is the renewing of your mind so you can
[1:22:59] walk in this flesh according to the
[1:23:02] desires of your new heart. That is the
[1:23:05] second exodus, my friends.
[1:23:08] My brother, it will do something for
[1:23:11] you. It'll change your life.
[1:23:15] You'll turn a corner in your Christian
[1:23:18] walk away from law and into grace that
[1:23:21] transforms your life and renews your
[1:23:25] mind.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; This capacity to know God's will and to
[1:23:30] live by it.
[1:23:32] This is what the Holy Ghost will give
[1:23:34] you.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; This understanding of what which is good
[1:23:38] and acceptable and perfect.
[1:23:43] Amen.
[1:23:46] I don't have much time tonight to speak
[1:23:49] further on the law of God but and the
[1:23:52] difference between the law of God and
[1:23:54] the law of Moses but let me just point
[1:23:56] you in the right direction as we move
[1:24:00] towards the third exodus.
[1:24:03] Search in your Bibles for the law of
[1:24:05] love
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; or the perfect law
[1:24:12] and you will notice that as one law is
[1:24:16] nailed to the cross,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; the previous law returns back in effect.
[1:24:24] Not a new law, the original law really.
[1:24:29] This is why I I told you, tell me what
[1:24:33] law Abraham lived by
[1:24:36] and I will tell you what law I abide by.
[1:24:40] The perfect law,
[1:24:43] the law of love
[1:24:47] written
[1:24:49] in the hearts.
[1:24:52] I will put my law and my commandments in
[1:24:55] their hearts.
[1:24:59] Amen. Let's see the third exodus now.
[1:25:03] And so, oh, it says second. Sorry,
[1:25:08] I got that done ready quickly this
[1:25:11] afternoon. Uh
[1:25:13] the the third exodus is out of the
[1:25:16] slavery of organized religion, out of
[1:25:19] Pentecostalism.
[1:25:23] Out of organized religion and into
[1:25:26] Christ, our promised land.
[1:25:30] This is the last exodus.
[1:25:33] This is it.
[1:25:35] Leave organized religion.
[1:25:38] Leave the first and the second pull to
[1:25:41] enter in the third pole.
[1:25:44] My
[1:25:46] this is it.
[1:25:49] And uh
[1:25:51] it's not talking about changing
[1:25:53] building. You say ah I left my former
[1:25:56] church and got to this new church. But
[1:26:00] you might still be in a denomination of
[1:26:02] one man.
[1:26:07] A lot of Christians are in a
[1:26:08] denomination of one man.
[1:26:10] They have their idea
[1:26:13] and uh they advocate for their idea
[1:26:17] and really you have to believe it like
[1:26:19] them to be a true Christian
[1:26:22] and that is just as well a denomination.
[1:26:26] There's no difference. And I want you to
[1:26:29] notice that our title was three exotices
[1:26:31] and one promised land.
[1:26:34] And and there's not one promised land
[1:26:36] for us each time we go through an
[1:26:38] exodus.
[1:26:40] The promised land is on the other side
[1:26:41] of the three. Justification,
[1:26:45] sanctification,
[1:26:47] and baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:26:50] really the the reason you cannot put the
[1:26:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:26:54] Pentecostalism is because
[1:26:57] they they've uh messed up what the
[1:27:01] baptism really is.
[1:27:03] and and they've proposed an experience,
[1:27:06] emotions, sensationalisms,
[1:27:09] speaking in tongue. They they have
[1:27:12] substituted the real baptism of the Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost for some
[1:27:17] experience.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And and it seems we want to go back to
[1:27:24] this sadly.
[1:27:28] Three Exodus, one promised land. And
[1:27:30] we're coming close to the promised land
[1:27:32] now. Oh, there you go. Third Exodus.
[1:27:35] Thank you. Let me summarize our three
[1:27:38] Egypts
[1:27:40] because yes, we have to walk out of
[1:27:43] three Egypts.
[1:27:45] We have to walk out of the world.
[1:27:49] We have to walk out of the law. And as I
[1:27:53] was having a fellowship this afternoon
[1:27:56] with some brothers and sisters at the
[1:27:58] table, we were talking about the fact
[1:28:00] that we see a move now
[1:28:03] of many message churches
[1:28:06] out of the law and into grace. In the
[1:28:09] past 10 years or so, some it's it's been
[1:28:12] two years, five years, 10 years, but
[1:28:13] let's call it the past 10 years or so,
[1:28:16] we see just a move of a lot of these
[1:28:19] churches out of the loss. A lot of are
[1:28:22] still in the law but a lot of them are
[1:28:25] also coming out of the law and into
[1:28:28] grace.
[1:28:30] And uh we were talking about this and
[1:28:32] and I mentioned this we we cannot act a
[1:28:37] as if it's something new
[1:28:40] as if it's a new revelation or something
[1:28:42] very special that's happening to us.
[1:28:45] Really
[1:28:46] that's 2,000 years old.
[1:28:52] Yeah, we're we're 2,000 years old late.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:28:59] God is never late. But
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; but really, you know, the the the corner
[1:29:06] was turned by Paul
[1:29:09] and stayed turned until
[1:29:13] they've created the Catholic Church,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; until the denominated again. And then it
[1:29:20] was again about controlling the people
[1:29:23] and the deeds and the laws became in
[1:29:25] effect again. And now in in in the 1500s
[1:29:30] Luther got out of the Catholic Church.
[1:29:35] We call ourselves Protestants because of
[1:29:37] him. But the truth is we all carry a
[1:29:41] Catholic heritage.
[1:29:44] We all do.
[1:29:46] It seems like we still come from there.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; It's it's almost like it's in our DNA
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; to work according to laws and to try to
[1:30:00] do some deeds and some works to make it
[1:30:04] but it's not how it's supposed to be.
[1:30:09] That is why it's called the work of
[1:30:10] restoration
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and because we need to go back to the
[1:30:15] original.
[1:30:17] Not only we need to get out of cat
[1:30:20] Catholicism or any denomination as a
[1:30:23] matter of fact, but this catalyst needs
[1:30:27] to get out of us as well.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You can't take a man out of the river,
[1:30:32] but it's about taking the river out of
[1:30:34] the man.
[1:30:38] Amen. And so I know we all know the
[1:30:43] third exodus because
[1:30:45] you know this is the one we've heard
[1:30:48] about the most.
[1:30:50] And so tonight I just want to first
[1:30:52] thing I want to make clear is that we
[1:30:56] all need to walk these three exodus
[1:31:00] before we can even think of our promised
[1:31:03] land.
[1:31:05] That is why we cannot skip the first two
[1:31:07] ones. They also have to be real for us.
[1:31:10] Not just history. They have to be real
[1:31:13] for us because before we can even walk
[1:31:15] the third one, we have to walk the first
[1:31:18] two ones.
[1:31:20] But let's assume
[1:31:22] that we have all been walking the third
[1:31:26] exodus.
[1:31:28] Let's assume just for a minute that
[1:31:30] everybody here has walked out of
[1:31:33] religion into a personal relationship
[1:31:37] with Jesus Christ, which is what the
[1:31:39] third exodus is about. It's not about a
[1:31:43] group of people anymore. It's about a
[1:31:45] personal relationship
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; out of religion
[1:31:50] into a personal relationship with
[1:31:52] Christ. Let's assume for a minute that
[1:31:54] we've all done that.
[1:31:56] We still have a lot of questions to ask.
[1:32:00] And the first one is
[1:32:03] where are we at?
[1:32:06] Are we in the desert?
[1:32:08] Are we in the promised land yet?
[1:32:17] It's funny how the church gets silence
[1:32:19] when we ask these questions.
[1:32:22] to help us define where we're at. I'd
[1:32:25] like to set pointers like checkpoints
[1:32:27] for us because you know all three Exodus
[1:32:30] has to be exactly the same because God
[1:32:33] never changes. And the first checkpoint
[1:32:37] I have to make is the fact that Moses
[1:32:40] died in the desert.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; So did everyone of those who followed
[1:32:45] him out of Egypt.
[1:32:54] And a lot of preachers
[1:32:57] make it look like only two people made
[1:32:59] it to the promised land.
[1:33:03] Have you ever feel like that?
[1:33:05] Like they make it sound like everybody
[1:33:07] died in the desert. So therefore, a
[1:33:10] very, very little flock. Only two people
[1:33:13] made it to the promised land. Joshua and
[1:33:16] Caleb.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:33:21] Did only two people make it?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; No. Millions made it.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb are simply the ones who
[1:33:29] led them in.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; empowering us to go in, telling us that
[1:33:38] we are more than able.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; I came here tonight
[1:33:44] to tell you that you are more than able.
[1:33:49] Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus led us up to the promise, but the
[1:33:55] Holy Spirit came as Joshua to take us
[1:33:58] over and lead and direct and possess the
[1:34:01] land or possess the church.
[1:34:05] You see, Moses didn't bring the children
[1:34:07] into the promised land. He was the
[1:34:09] lawgiver, but he didn't bring the
[1:34:11] children into the promised land. Joshua
[1:34:13] took them over. See, and the Holy Spirit
[1:34:17] is the one that's taking them over
[1:34:22] now,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; not later.
[1:34:26] Now,
[1:34:28] Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:31] telling us, you were more than able and
[1:34:33] empowering us to take the promised land
[1:34:37] when
[1:34:39] now.
[1:34:41] Now. And Caleb is a type of the real
[1:34:44] minister of the gospel, I believe,
[1:34:47] following the leadership of the Holy
[1:34:49] Ghost and helping the people in the
[1:34:51] promised land. But we've stood there on
[1:34:55] the shores of the Jordan for so many
[1:34:58] years.
[1:35:01] I stood on the shores of the Jordan from
[1:35:04] where I from when I was born.
[1:35:07] I am one of the children of Israel that
[1:35:10] were born in the desert.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I am one of them.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I was born on the shores of the Jordan.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; And we've looked at countless people
[1:35:23] dying.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; One brother told me once, he said, "It's
[1:35:28] not normal that our people die. We
[1:35:30] should have the miracles that the
[1:35:32] Pentecostals have."
[1:35:35] He was advocating for return in Egypt.
[1:35:37] He didn't even know it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; I told him in the desert people die.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:35:51] In the desert
[1:35:53] people die.
[1:35:57] The reason people die,
[1:36:00] the reason the children of God, the
[1:36:02] children of Israel died in the desert is
[1:36:06] because they walked around in the desert
[1:36:08] and refused to cross Jordan.
[1:36:12] They refused to enter the promised land.
[1:36:16] Three days, three days is all it was
[1:36:20] supposed to take to get there.
[1:36:23] 3 days walk and 40 years is how much
[1:36:26] time they lost in the desert.
[1:36:30] Now let's go back to our opening
[1:36:32] scripture.
[1:36:34] Joshua chapter 1.
[1:36:36] After the death of Moses, the servant of
[1:36:38] the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[1:36:40] spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun. Moses'
[1:36:42] assistant, saying, "Moses, my servant,
[1:36:45] is dead. Now therefore arise, go over
[1:36:49] this Jordan, you and all this people, to
[1:36:52] the land which I am giving to them, the
[1:36:54] children of Israel, every place that the
[1:36:56] soul of your foot will thread upon, I
[1:36:59] have given you.
[1:37:02] As I said to Moses,
[1:37:06] as I said to Moses,
[1:37:10] God is not all of a sudden opening the
[1:37:12] doors of the promised land to Joshua.
[1:37:17] God is not the one who kept the children
[1:37:19] of Israel for 40 years in the desert.
[1:37:22] In Deuteronomy
[1:37:24] about 40 years earlier, he told Moses,
[1:37:28] "Go to the promised land, and every
[1:37:31] place that the sole of your foot will
[1:37:33] tread upon, I have given you."
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And now we're 40 years later. Moses
[1:37:40] dead. Most of the people are dead, the
[1:37:43] ones that got out of Egypt.
[1:37:45] And now God has to come again to his
[1:37:48] people and repeat himself.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; He just repeats the exact same thing he
[1:37:55] said to Moses 40 years ago. He says, "Go
[1:37:58] in."
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; It's yours
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; as I said to Moses 40 years ago.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Why did they stay 40 years in the desert
[1:38:08] or on the shore of the Jordan? Anyways,
[1:38:11] it's because they listened to false
[1:38:14] report about the promised land.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; They listened to ministers that said,
[1:38:19] "We can't make it.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; We can't cross the Jordan. We can't get
[1:38:24] the seven seals. You we can't we can't
[1:38:26] have the third pole. We we can't
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; false reports
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; for 40 years.
[1:38:34] No, no, we can't talk about this. No, we
[1:38:37] can't get to the promised land. No, we
[1:38:39] can't cross Jordan.
[1:38:42] 40 years listening to false reports on
[1:38:45] the shores of the Jordan and people
[1:38:47] dying and people dying and now the
[1:38:50] result is we're building a camp to go
[1:38:52] back to Pentecost.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:59] These same ministers now they want to go
[1:39:01] back to Egypt.
[1:39:03] Come on, brother. They're tired of
[1:39:06] people dying in the wilderness. So they
[1:39:08] want to go back to the first and second
[1:39:09] pool
[1:39:11] when they're on the shore of the Jordan.
[1:39:14] It's time to cross the Jordan.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; The Jordan is a very special river.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Throughout the Bible,
[1:39:24] every time someone came to the river
[1:39:27] with faith,
[1:39:28] the river opened
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; to let them cross.
[1:39:36] Amen.
[1:39:38] The Jordan River is a type of the
[1:39:40] seventh seal, my friend.
[1:39:45] They've told us not to get close to it.
[1:39:48] Don't preach about it. Don't get close
[1:39:51] to it.
[1:39:54] You cannot understand it.
[1:39:57] They brought false report.
[1:40:01] But I'm here to tell you tonight that
[1:40:02] the river will open if you come at it
[1:40:05] with faith.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Faith is revelation.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And the beautiful thing is when the
[1:40:12] river runs dry and you start crossing
[1:40:16] it, you see memorials on the bottom of
[1:40:19] the river.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; They were left there. So you know
[1:40:23] someone crossed before you. Hallelujah.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; They let you know, hey, you're not the
[1:40:30] first one to cross to the J cross the
[1:40:32] Jordan to promised land.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; You're not the first one.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You can come at the river with faith.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Hit it with the mantle and it opens.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Every time someone did it, the river
[1:40:46] opened.
[1:40:50] The Holy Spirit is the one taking them
[1:40:55] over. Now, we've just read it. The Holy
[1:41:00] Spirit, Joshua, is the one taking them
[1:41:04] over.
[1:41:06] Now,
[1:41:09] brothers, sisters, our promised land is
[1:41:11] available now.
[1:41:14] Every day
[1:41:16] someone crosses Jordan to the promised
[1:41:18] land. Every day if you come to the river
[1:41:22] with faith and hit it with your coat, it
[1:41:25] will open. The seal will open and you
[1:41:28] will cross the river and get into the
[1:41:32] land of milk and honey
[1:41:34] and it'll change your life, brother.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; You'll never be the same. You will never
[1:41:40] thirst the message of divine healing
[1:41:42] again.
[1:41:44] You will be about conquering the land.
[1:41:46] You will feed on the promises of God.
[1:41:49] You will manifest God's power in your
[1:41:51] own life. You will speak to your storms.
[1:41:55] You will speak to the son. Son, stop. I
[1:41:58] have a battle to win.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; You will bear children to Christ. You
[1:42:04] will bear fruits of the land.
[1:42:07] For years,
[1:42:09] for years there was a fight. Is the
[1:42:12] seven seal open? Is it not open?
[1:42:17] Everybody's fighting.
[1:42:21] But the truth has been revealed.
[1:42:24] And the truth says it's not something
[1:42:27] public.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; It's private.
[1:42:34] It's a secret.
[1:42:37] Is the river flowing or is the river
[1:42:40] open?
[1:42:44] The river is flowing.
[1:42:47] But now we know it can open and let us
[1:42:50] in.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. To the outside world, the river is
[1:42:56] flowing.
[1:42:58] To the carnal believer, the river is
[1:43:01] flowing. They come to you and say, "Oh,
[1:43:03] this seventh seal is not open.
[1:43:06] They can fight about about whatever they
[1:43:08] want."
[1:43:10] But if you come at it with faith, which
[1:43:12] is revelation,
[1:43:14] you know now it can open and let you in.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; It's personal.
[1:43:22] But as you cross in,
[1:43:25] you will see memorials
[1:43:29] of the ones who crossed before you.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Knowing you're not alone
[1:43:35] on the other side of the Jordan.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; It's uniting time.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It's uniting time, friends. Our promised
[1:43:44] land is Christ.
[1:43:49] It's marriage time.
[1:43:51] It's about time we get into Christ, our
[1:43:55] promised land.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Out of religion, yes. But where too?
[1:44:01] To Christ. Get into Christ.
[1:44:06] To get pregnantated with the word,
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; a marriage.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Pregnated. It's it's a sexual term. This
[1:44:15] is a term that the prophet used. Get
[1:44:17] pregnantated.
[1:44:19] intimacy in the secret place in the
[1:44:22] secret chamber like we've talked this
[1:44:24] morning
[1:44:25] and Caleb just a worthy minister of the
[1:44:29] gospel he stands there he doesn't have a
[1:44:32] second pull or a first pull or second
[1:44:35] pull to show he doesn't have nothing to
[1:44:37] show except his faith
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; in the word
[1:44:43] he's there as a help to take you by the
[1:44:46] hand and help you cross Jordan, bring
[1:44:50] you to the secret place where you can
[1:44:52] meet God face to face for yourself
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; and be pregnantated with the word
[1:45:00] where you can bear the fruits of the
[1:45:04] spoken word.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; The third pull.
[1:45:09] Hallelujah.
[1:45:12] Most Christian I've heard talking about
[1:45:14] the promised land,
[1:45:16] they they talk about something, you
[1:45:18] know, on the other side of heaven or
[1:45:22] something far away.
[1:45:24] Most Christian I've heard talking about
[1:45:26] the kingdom of God. They talk about
[1:45:28] something in heaven or far away.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; My friends, the kingdom of God is now in
[1:45:35] here.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; The promised land is now in here.
[1:45:40] And if you stand on the shores of the
[1:45:42] Jordan tonight,
[1:45:46] do me a favor.
[1:45:49] Hit the river with your coat
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; and cross to the promised land tonight.
[1:45:54] You can cross to the promised land, to
[1:45:57] the land of milk and honey
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; where you will have no need or no thirst
[1:46:04] for the message of divine healing
[1:46:07] because you will now have the spoken
[1:46:09] word inside of you. Having been
[1:46:13] pregnantated with the word, you will
[1:46:16] bear the spoken word inside of you. And
[1:46:20] that spoken word will bear fruits in
[1:46:23] your life. And when you need the son to
[1:46:26] stop, you will tell the son to stop.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; And you won't even be excited about it.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; It will not be for sure.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't ask the son to stop so
[1:46:41] that everybody thinks he has a great
[1:46:43] gift.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; It was about conquering the land. Every
[1:46:47] soul, every place where the soul of your
[1:46:51] feet thread,
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; it's yours.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; It's about time the people of God starts
[1:46:58] conquering the land.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is here
[1:47:03] and now.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:47:12] Heavenly Father,
[1:47:19] maybe many of us stand on the shores of
[1:47:21] the Jordan tonight.
[1:47:29] Maybe we have stood there for so many
[1:47:31] years
[1:47:33] looking to the promised land,
[1:47:36] hearing about the promised land, being
[1:47:39] preached about the promised land.
[1:47:42] hearing about the third pole, hearing
[1:47:44] about these things, but never really
[1:47:46] experiencing these things and wondering
[1:47:51] are these things for me or not?
[1:47:55] Am I a Christian?
[1:47:58] Do I have what it takes? Am I holy
[1:48:01] enough? Am I good enough?
[1:48:05] Father,
[1:48:08] may all these
[1:48:10] reproach of the enemy and all these
[1:48:13] false reports
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; be cast away tonight.
[1:48:18] And may your people realize that by
[1:48:20] faith they can cross tonight,
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; cross the river and enter the promised
[1:48:28] land.
[1:48:32] and that it'll change their lives
[1:48:34] forever.
[1:48:37] Lord, empower your people.
[1:48:41] May your Joshua be in this room tonight
[1:48:45] and lead people through the promised
[1:48:46] land
[1:48:50] as I have been pointing them faithfully
[1:48:52] to you.
[1:48:54] Lord, take them by the hand
[1:48:57] and help him cross
[1:49:00] to the land where flows milk and honey,
[1:49:04] where they'll be pregnantated by your
[1:49:06] word and bear fruits of the spoken word.
[1:49:10] I pray
[1:49:12] you make it happen tonight, Lord.
[1:49:17] Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] Do it for someone tonight.
[1:49:21] May your spirit roam over every heart
[1:49:29] as we go into worship. Lord,
[1:49:35] may you touch one more heart tonight.
[1:49:40] Strengthen the faith of someone.
[1:49:46] deliver someone from their oppression
[1:49:48] and their negative thoughts about
[1:49:51] themselves,
[1:49:53] thinking they are not enough,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; they are not worthy enough, they're not
[1:49:58] Christian enough.
[1:50:01] Help some help someone realize it's all
[1:50:03] by grace.
[1:50:07] I ask in Jesus name.
[1:50:11] Amen.
[1:50:13] Amen. musicians.

[1:50:34] by the song that sister sang.
[1:50:40] Do
[1:50:41] do we know the song? We've been made
[1:50:43] more than conquerors.
[1:50:54] Overcomers in this life.

[1:51:09] could sing it. Yeah.

[1:51:16] I will.

[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; I just
[1:54:33] I just love how the statement that the
[1:54:36] brother made just now, how how um Joshua
[1:54:40] when he said, "Son, stand still," he did
[1:54:42] not even get excited about it. He just
[1:54:44] went on about his daily business. I
[1:54:46] believe that's the place we we coming
[1:54:48] to. just so much was spoken today that
[1:54:51] I'm just really happy and excited about.
[1:54:55] I was also thinking about the the
[1:54:57] principle and I'm sure it occurred to
[1:54:59] everyone. Um but
[1:55:02] those those 12 stones that were put in
[1:55:05] the Jordan River as the as the uh symbol
[1:55:09] there that someone has crossed there
[1:55:10] before and then when Elijah crossed that
[1:55:12] river and when Elisha remember now
[1:55:14] Elijah is a type of brother Brandham and
[1:55:16] Elisha the type of the bride following
[1:55:18] and and the the Elisha today can come to
[1:55:22] the river again in faith and say open
[1:55:24] river. Amen. We it's our land. I mean
[1:55:28] it's ours. It's been promised to us.
[1:55:30] Let's not look at all the the scarecrows
[1:55:33] and all the negative testimonies. Amen.
[1:55:36] The word is ours. The third pool is
[1:55:38] ours. The seventh seal is ours. Amen.
[1:55:40] Your relationship with your heavenly
[1:55:42] husband is ours.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; God has paid for it. Amen. But not only
[1:55:48] that, he's taken the book.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Now we've taken the book. Amen. Praise
[1:55:54] God. The book is no longer in his hand.
[1:55:56] The book is now in our hand.

[1:56:00] these things. It's just so beautiful.
[1:56:02] Thank you very much, my brother. God
[1:56:04] bless you richly. Also want to just say
[1:56:06] thank you again for especially those
[1:56:09] people that traveled a far, visited us,
[1:56:12] and I know there's a few that's got a
[1:56:13] long journey home, but God bless you. I
[1:56:15] trust that it was worth your while. I
[1:56:17] certainly believe it would have been.
