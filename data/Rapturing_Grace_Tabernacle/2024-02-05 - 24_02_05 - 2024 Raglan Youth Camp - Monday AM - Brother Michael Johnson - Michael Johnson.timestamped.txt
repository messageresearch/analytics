[34:26] right praise the
[34:27] lord well this has gone so quick so
[34:32] quick I think of all the months of
[34:34] looking forward and all the hard work
[34:35] beforehand and looking forward to this
[34:37] time it's kind of scary to think that we
[34:41] at the last service of Camp already we
[34:43] have one day to go but um a fun day
[34:47] exciting day um but um right now I'm
[34:52] really really looking forward to what
[34:54] the Lord is going to speak to us this
[34:55] morning and mean I believe the
[34:57] foundation has been laid I'm really sad
[34:58] for those who can't be here this morning
[35:01] um but really we want to we want to
[35:03] really receive the the icing on the cake
[35:06] this morning I trust that you're all all
[35:08] right not too
[35:10] tired amen I will say again what I said
[35:13] uh what was it yesterday or the day
[35:14] before if if you feel too tired please
[35:17] feel free to stand up but it's it's
[35:19] really crucial that you get this morning
[35:21] service it's really really important
[35:24] that we get maximum out of it
[35:27] and uh like I said last night I want to
[35:29] encourage you to open your hearts and if
[35:33] there's things that that cause your
[35:34] heart to be blocked I want to I want to
[35:37] encourage you right now even to just in
[35:39] your heart say Lord please open my heart
[35:42] so I can receive these
[35:45] things it's so good to be here so good
[35:48] to have you all here um we are slightly
[35:51] smaller group than yesterday but um it's
[35:54] it is uh there's something special
[35:56] special about small small group of
[35:58] Fellowship also so really intimate and
[36:01] so on so I don't want to take a lot of
[36:03] time but maybe we can sing another song
[36:07] so
[36:09] um let's sing that
[36:13] song um we have all foreign musicians
[36:17] that's going to be
[36:19] fun so let's see how we
[36:24] go you guys probably and when I say
[36:26] foreign I mean not my home
[36:28] church I don't mean you know you
[36:32] understand you know I get myself in
[36:33] trouble this what's that
[36:39] now prise the Lord J you have to show
[36:42] them how to do this
[36:44] um so I want to sing that that uh song
[36:47] of kissas broken down all my wealth
[36:50] Stripped Away so if you guys don't know
[36:52] it then I suggest we just quickly swap
[36:55] musicians

[45:09] easy things sometimes sometimes it hurts
[45:10] real bad and or you have to go to places
[45:12] that people don't want to go but you've
[45:13] been kind enough to at least hear me out
[45:15] and I appreciate that and I trust
[45:17] sometimes you know sometimes God is a
[45:19] it's like as we spoke about the other
[45:21] night it's a healing process and some
[45:23] things may have been said that you're
[45:25] still trying to figure figure out and
[45:26] you don't quite understand and you feel
[45:28] the heart is hurting but or you just
[45:30] trying to see Lord I still struggle but
[45:32] I'm I'm but just let him do the healing
[45:34] let him take through you through that
[45:36] Journey Don't Be impatient wait on the
[45:38] Lord he will help you through but um I
[45:41] really believe you know God has really
[45:43] called us to be happy people to be
[45:45] Overcomers in your generation like we
[45:47] said in the first service you being the
[45:49] elite so uh you know it's an opportunity
[45:52] to express yourself to the world around
[45:54] you and it doesn't necessarily mean that
[45:56] you'll be saving everyone around you but
[45:57] you'll just be a shining light for those
[45:59] around you so may the Lord just be with
[46:02] you we're going to go on a a slightly
[46:04] different route this morning uh I want
[46:06] to give you some tools okay and I want
[46:08] to help you in the journey ahead and
[46:11] then just help you amongst each other
[46:13] because you know you got each other hey
[46:15] yeah some of us have got some friends
[46:17] out there that respect your stand and
[46:18] there's nothing wrong with that but
[46:20] unfortunately often you only really have
[46:23] each other to to help and and what
[46:25] happens is is uh the devil's going to
[46:27] try and interrupt that and just some
[46:28] bring some feelings amongst you and some
[46:30] hurts and if we're not careful for the
[46:32] Joe's walking up to uh there we go thank
[46:34] you brother JN you know the if you're
[46:36] not careful the devil let little things
[46:38] come amongst us but if we can see the
[46:41] picture if we can see where the devil's
[46:43] tricks are um you know we can just be in
[46:46] a better state so may the Lord just help
[46:48] us this morning by his grace amen so um
[46:52] you can bring up the
[46:54] presentation brother Joe ah I hijacked
[46:58] the Cam's
[47:00] theme we we all know what it was we all
[47:03] in this together but it's not just we
[47:05] all in this together today it's it's
[47:07] supposed to carry on okay this is the
[47:09] idea here and that's how you'll see my
[47:11] sermon title was let brotherly and
[47:13] sister sisterly love continue because
[47:16] that's really where we want this to go
[47:18] that from here it'll just be extended
[47:20] and we'll help each other along life's
[47:22] journey amen so Austra you are dismissed
[47:26] you're all looking at me wondering where
[47:27] am I going to send them down don't wor
[47:28] you are dismissed and thank you once
[47:30] again the singing has just also been
[47:32] such a highlight oh man you guys are
[47:34] talented here and just even that song uh
[47:37] we sang just now Sister Carissa sang uh
[47:39] composed and wrote you know there's such
[47:41] talents in the message and allow
[47:43] yourself to express talents don't don't
[47:45] hinder yourself some of us are just
[47:47] weighed under we think we're not good
[47:49] enough we don't have what it takes but
[47:50] you know God can really use your gift
[47:53] you know in the Bible many of you know
[47:56] the story here the K the you know the
[47:58] the the household sort of king or ruler
[48:00] gave people different talents you know
[48:02] and as you know it and it represents God
[48:04] and some some have got five talents you
[48:05] know and they sometimes look like the
[48:07] heroes you know amongst us and and us as
[48:09] the one Talent we know we don't want to
[48:11] be guilty of burying the talent under
[48:12] the ground because you'll be surprised
[48:14] are that one Talent God can use and
[48:16] multiply so so don't look at each other
[48:18] don't look at each other's gifts and you
[48:20] know that guy's bigger than me and and
[48:22] she's more pretty it doesn't matter God
[48:24] will use you in your place so just trust
[48:27] him he's definitely got a purpose for
[48:29] you amen so we're going to read
[48:33] uh it shows it's
[48:36] on and the battery shows full am I maybe
[48:39] am I supposed to point up
[48:43] here ah maybe we need a
[48:49] restart there we go let's turn to First
[48:52] John chapter
[48:54] 3
[49:03] and yeah I just want to also just uh say
[49:06] to the um the kitchen staff the food has
[49:09] been great just thanks so much it's been
[49:11] great the service yeah yeah let's give
[49:13] them a hand and then just the behind the
[49:16] scenes team you know I think I've
[49:17] developed friends that I believe a lost
[49:19] the lifetime you know you are amazing
[49:21] people so God bless you all it's just
[49:23] been such a privilege to get to know you
[49:25] all
[49:26] so 1 John 3:14 it reades thus we know
[49:29] that we have passed from Death unto life
[49:32] why what is the one of the great
[49:35] indicators that you have changed you
[49:37] haven't changed life why because you we
[49:39] love the brethren we love each other he
[49:43] that loveth not his brother or his
[49:45] sister just putting a little disclaimer
[49:48] there abideth in death you know and
[49:51] that's quite a hard thing because no
[49:53] doubt things get sent and there's
[49:55] hurtful things that happen and uh you
[49:57] know you could Satan might just Chuck
[49:59] you in there and say you know um you
[50:01] know you don't have life in you because
[50:03] you have feelings one to another and and
[50:05] that's just a a lie of the devil because
[50:07] ultimately it's not that you will not
[50:09] have things happen amongst you but like
[50:13] said last night you some's going to have
[50:14] to give over those hurts to God and be
[50:17] willing for him to apply the soothing
[50:20] bomb and heal those and it can take a
[50:23] long time before you get there but now
[50:25] nonetheless your inward desire should
[50:27] always be this that I want to love my
[50:29] brother and sister irrespective of what
[50:31] they've done and said to me whosoever
[50:34] love hateth his brother is a murderer
[50:36] and he that knoweth no murderer hath
[50:38] Eternal and ye know that no murderer
[50:41] hath eternal life abiding in him hereby
[50:45] perceive we the love of God how because
[50:47] he laid down his life for us and we
[50:51] ought to lay down our lives for the
[50:53] Brethren amen it's not just about you
[50:56] it's it's not about your little bubble
[50:58] it's about extending the borders to each
[51:01] other but so but who so hath this
[51:04] world's good now this is where we have
[51:06] to be careful because it's easy to say
[51:08] brother I'm praying for you God bless
[51:10] you you know all these things but the
[51:12] Bible wants us to do more because it
[51:13] says here but Who whoo hath this world's
[51:16] good and seeth his brother have a need
[51:19] so you see your brother and sisters got
[51:21] a struggle and you shut up the balls of
[51:24] compassion from him then the question is
[51:27] how can the love of God dwell in you
[51:30] remember that little testimony I said
[51:32] about when I was young and I had just a
[51:33] new spirit how I condemn that guy at
[51:35] school for throwing the acorns but by
[51:37] God's Great later on he could change my
[51:40] spirit and I could realize I need to
[51:42] actually have compassion for these
[51:43] people cuz sudden as they don't know
[51:44] what they're doing and theyve just been
[51:45] inspired of the
[51:46] devil my little children let us not love
[51:49] in word neither in tongue cuz it's easy
[51:52] to say God bless you and I'll be praying
[51:54] for you but in indeed you need to do
[51:56] something about it and in truth amen
[52:00] sorry I know you've been standing but
[52:02] let's just do one more the longer you
[52:04] stand the more time it it buys me to you
[52:06] know preach a little longer so we're
[52:09] going to go second Peter 1 and don't
[52:10] worry you don't have to turn we'll just
[52:11] go through this quickly uh you know this
[52:13] all well but it's it's it's a direct
[52:15] type I'm sure many of you have seen the
[52:17] statue of a perfect man that is
[52:19] displayed in many churches and you would
[52:21] have seen the picture and this is the
[52:22] the scripture that refers to it and
[52:23] besides this giving or Ence add to your
[52:26] faith virtue and virtue knowledge and to
[52:28] temper knowledge Temperance and to
[52:30] Temperance patience and to patience
[52:32] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[52:35] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[52:37] charity now that's not charity like
[52:38] giving to the poor it's charity of God's
[52:41] love himself the Capstone God himself
[52:44] amen so that's the what comes and caps
[52:46] it all off now look what it says about
[52:48] this for if these things be in you and
[52:51] abound they make you that you shall
[52:53] neither be Barren as a as a Christian
[52:56] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[52:58] Lord Jesus but he that lath these things
[53:01] is blind and cannot see a far off and
[53:04] often this is what happens because you
[53:06] allow these things to come and you
[53:08] actually forget that he was purged from
[53:11] his old sins you forget what God did for
[53:13] you you forget the mercy and Grace when
[53:16] you were such a scumbag and a sinner you
[53:19] forget that God lifted you up from that
[53:22] condition and then you unfortunately get
[53:24] to place where you're not you just can't
[53:26] forgive and you can't help others so
[53:28] it's just a it is a real harsh
[53:30] condemnation I mean this is a harsh
[53:32] scripture right here you could say but
[53:34] if we just allow Christ to soothe and
[53:36] teach us these things I believe we'll be
[53:38] in a better place amen Let's Just Close
[53:40] Our Eyes in a word of prayer dear
[53:41] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[53:43] for this day we thank you for your
[53:44] goodness and Grace and all you've done
[53:46] for us we believe you've been with us in
[53:48] this Camp thus far and Lord as we now
[53:50] come into the last service may you just
[53:52] be amongst us and just really have a
[53:54] wonderful work May people's lives just
[53:56] be different may they look at things
[53:57] different from this day forward and may
[53:59] you just help them in all their trials
[54:01] that are lay ahead and the
[54:02] characteristics of them that'll have to
[54:04] change and the temperaments Etc help us
[54:06] in Jesus name we pray
[54:08] amen amen so um you know you as I said
[54:12] you may be seated
[54:13] sorry austa was dismissed late you were
[54:16] seated late I'll preach
[54:20] late okay so uh don't worry I don't feel
[54:23] bad brother bam says do you notice I'm
[54:24] always late that's one of his
[54:26] characteristics anyway so I know you're
[54:28] all very familiar with this and he
[54:29] actually this is not correct you know
[54:31] why that Capstone has come down that
[54:34] happened 1963 so yes this is a very
[54:37] well-known thing and and actually
[54:39] brother Brandon preached the statute of
[54:40] a perfect man I believe is in 1962
[54:42] before the seals so uh when the seals
[54:45] came down by God's grace we all know
[54:47] that picture of Christ on Sunset
[54:48] Mountain that was him coming down to cap
[54:51] us off and yes there was still Lots
[54:53] going to H to happen after that but he
[54:55] sets in motion everything else so you
[54:57] know we we we know there that those that
[54:59] are have been have been familiar with
[55:02] the teachings you know we had a a
[55:04] actually an age change so as much as uh
[55:07] your bodies and where you go to work and
[55:10] you go to school Etc your bodies are
[55:11] still in lishia you'll feel the effects
[55:14] absolutely you'll know you're in lishia
[55:16] it's so nice to know that spiritually
[55:18] speaking we've actually changed into a
[55:19] bride age you know an eagle age and
[55:21] Astronaut age there's been a distinct
[55:22] change of us but the fact of the that is
[55:25] we still bodily speaking and how we deal
[55:28] with each other still in a lan age okay
[55:31] like I said spiritually speaking we s in
[55:33] hard by God's grace but you will feel
[55:35] the effects and have to deal with the
[55:36] effects of Lisha now it's fascinating
[55:40] because as we know the the the pyramid
[55:42] uh situation how it builds up you know
[55:45] you see how uh you know he he shows the
[55:47] faith Foundation was laid by Paul which
[55:49] is the Ephesians Church age and we build
[55:51] our way up and uh you know as I said we
[55:54] are technically still in the ludian age
[55:56] when it refers to the conditions we we
[55:58] we live in and as we know brother
[56:00] Brandon was given uh in part to the
[56:02] ludan age but actually moving off into
[56:04] really actually the the the bride age
[56:07] that's where he's his main focus and
[56:09] point of coming to Earth but nonetheless
[56:11] you know this is where we are currently
[56:12] in the flesh realm so I found it
[56:15] fascinating that brotherly
[56:19] kindness was the attribute of Christ
[56:22] that he desired for the L age where your
[56:26] flesh has to deal with it's interesting
[56:30] it could it could have been patience it
[56:31] could have been something else but God
[56:33] knew in his in in in his for knowledge
[56:36] that we going to need brotherly kindness
[56:39] and sisterly kindness amongst us now
[56:42] understand this is not the agapa love
[56:45] this is not uh you know uh the The
[56:48] Incredible God that just forgives and
[56:49] everything it's a it's shall we say
[56:51] almost a a a a lesser form but not in a
[56:54] not in a bad still attribute of God but
[56:56] it's not in that uh that that peak of a
[56:59] Goa love it's more of a kindness and a
[57:01] love and a good feeling one to another
[57:04] so actually uh you'll see the meaning if
[57:07] you go in the original of that brotherly
[57:09] uh kindness and love in the Bible now
[57:10] you'll notice it says Philadelphia which
[57:12] is actually the age before us and
[57:14] brother BR actually says among amongst
[57:15] the John Wesley age there was amazing
[57:19] cooperation amongst the churches they
[57:20] really had a great drive to get the
[57:22] gospel out of it there and he actually
[57:24] says that was age of great brotherly
[57:26] love and kindness because they work
[57:27] together you know they get rid of their
[57:29] disputes they found a way to be
[57:31] agreeable so that's why it's actually
[57:32] funny enough the the original was
[57:34] Philadelphia but that word means love of
[57:38] brothers or sisters brotherly love and
[57:41] in the New Testament the love which
[57:43] Christians cherished for each other as
[57:47] Brethren and you can say well you know
[57:50] brother the Mark it's all very well
[57:51] what's what's the big the big deal what
[57:53] is Big when you start to see what the
[57:55] prophet says about these things because
[57:58] Satan's Drive is he knows yes he can
[58:02] only get so far but what is the best way
[58:04] to
[58:05] conquer the best way to conquer is if
[58:08] you can get division amongst your
[58:10] enemies am I right that's the best way
[58:12] and even God in the olden days and the
[58:15] Pharisees he did that many times where
[58:17] the the the the Philistines would start
[58:19] fighting each other you know you know
[58:21] the situation of Gideon you know blowing
[58:23] the horn and throwing down the thing and
[58:24] next they all just against each other
[58:26] and they didn't have to do anything they
[58:27] just they just slaughtered each other
[58:29] you know and and Satan knows these
[58:31] things and he's going to do his best to
[58:33] come amongst you sister against sister
[58:35] brother against brother feelings between
[58:37] each other the little relationships form
[58:39] you know feelings get built up and
[58:41] there's a break and there's hurt that is
[58:43] left it goes both ways so these things
[58:47] are real they they're going to be a part
[58:49] of us and and it's really big cuz look
[58:51] what the prophec is here okay so this
[58:53] it's talking about the the Palmer worm
[58:54] there's the cankerworm the Locust Etc
[58:56] but look what he says here so this
[58:58] little Palmer worm come around to take
[59:00] off the fruits and he says I've got two
[59:02] pages of fruits I want just to read some
[59:04] of it now look what the prophet says
[59:06] here first thing so this is first way of
[59:09] attack the first fruit he took off was
[59:12] brotherly love that's right that's one
[59:16] of the things that kills the church
[59:18] right there you know you can have great
[59:21] intentions you can want it but if Satan
[59:23] can get feelings amongst you
[59:25] that's going to be his first line of
[59:26] attack cuz yeah we great we all feeling
[59:28] on top of the world we're feeling
[59:30] awesome but Satan has got a lot of plans
[59:32] of attack when we leave here off the
[59:34] camp he's he's got things lined up for
[59:36] you and if you're not watching you're
[59:38] going to let things get in between
[59:40] you this is a sick world isn't it but
[59:44] you know what's the sickest body on
[59:46] Earth I say this with reverence not to
[59:49] be sacrilegious God forgive me if I say
[59:51] wrong the body of Jesus Christ
[59:55] it needs
[59:56] healing oh and look what it says it can
[1:00:00] only this is the prophet's words only be
[1:00:03] healed by brotherly
[1:00:06] love that's the sickest body I know of
[1:00:09] or broke to pieces and tore up God I
[1:00:13] pray for the healing of that body and
[1:00:15] you're the members of that body and how
[1:00:17] can we we get these things sorted out
[1:00:20] it's through brotherly love and it's
[1:00:22] quite a thought because you know brother
[1:00:24] will testify this as a pastor you'll be
[1:00:26] surprised how sick the body of Christ is
[1:00:29] when he people come to him in counsel
[1:00:31] and they find out the real trauma that
[1:00:33] goes on amongst us and it's often
[1:00:36] because we've allowed things we've
[1:00:37] allowed an entrance
[1:00:40] in now you know there's a there's a I
[1:00:44] don't know why it where it came at one
[1:00:46] point but there was a bit of an
[1:00:47] imbalance that unfortunately came in the
[1:00:49] message where we would so focus on word
[1:00:53] only and the spirit man that somehow we
[1:00:56] forgot that we're still humans we're
[1:00:58] still in this world and we're also human
[1:01:00] you are you are you are as much as you
[1:01:03] you know a theop you you got a theophany
[1:01:06] you still have a natural man on Earth
[1:01:09] and you have to deal with this guy okay
[1:01:11] you don't have a choice as much as we
[1:01:13] would love to as I say just be in
[1:01:14] control you know it you have your
[1:01:16] challenges so unfortunately we've had a
[1:01:18] situation when when when when we as
[1:01:20] ministers start talking about things
[1:01:22] that affect us more in the natural sense
[1:01:24] we get shut down like that's not
[1:01:26] spiritual enough but the reality is God
[1:01:29] has purposely given us tools it's
[1:01:31] wonderful I love the Seven Seals I love
[1:01:33] all these wonderful Divine mystery
[1:01:35] truths and it SS in my soul and it
[1:01:38] places me as a Believer because we know
[1:01:39] teaching places us but the reality is
[1:01:42] that we must make sure we also cater for
[1:01:45] The Human Side because if you don't
[1:01:48] you'll burn out or you'll have a a you
[1:01:51] know a situation where you just don't
[1:01:52] look at life like you should because you
[1:01:54] still a human that's why brother bam
[1:01:57] made no he wasn't scared to get out into
[1:01:59] nature and cut off meetings and say no I
[1:02:02] can't come to meetings I'm going to you
[1:02:04] know camp out go hunt for three weeks
[1:02:06] son was even longer cuz he knew he had
[1:02:09] to cater for the natural man he had
[1:02:11] natural things he enjoyed he loved he
[1:02:13] loved some sports he you know he was a
[1:02:15] boxer when he was young you know and I I
[1:02:18] listen he didn't say in the message but
[1:02:19] someone says said that if he was walking
[1:02:21] in like what you call a mo today and he
[1:02:23] saw some boxing on the TV he couldn't
[1:02:24] help but just hey let's check it out a
[1:02:27] bit you know he was a boxer in his
[1:02:29] nature and even though he says I was a
[1:02:31] safe person he says there still the
[1:02:34] natural Man part he even talks about
[1:02:36] that Indian nature that he used to have
[1:02:38] he says that Indian nature even though I
[1:02:39] got a rebirth experience it still was
[1:02:41] part of my makeup so there it's not a
[1:02:43] problem that's what I'm trying to say
[1:02:45] don't don't feel bad if you enjoy I I
[1:02:47] enjoy sports I'm going to be honest I
[1:02:48] enjoy sports I was a I was big into
[1:02:50] Cricket We some of the brothers we were
[1:02:52] talking about the other day I love my
[1:02:53] Cricket and I was pretty good at Cricket
[1:02:55] too I'm not bragging but I was and not
[1:02:57] not now I know not I was going to be
[1:02:59] disaster Zone but nonetheless back in
[1:03:02] the day I wasn't too bad and I loved it
[1:03:06] but there came a point when I realized
[1:03:08] it wasn't healthy for me it was the
[1:03:09] environments lot of uh you know F
[1:03:12] language and you know obviously uh the
[1:03:15] real good leagues they play on Sunday
[1:03:17] and and whatever so it just they came a
[1:03:19] point where I realized this is this is
[1:03:20] not for me and also I had to become a
[1:03:22] family man man and all those things and
[1:03:24] you know responsibility so there's a
[1:03:26] time you give up things but to be
[1:03:29] honest so if I walk you know if I see a
[1:03:32] cricket highlights I'm going to check it
[1:03:34] out it's like hey let's see this cuz I
[1:03:36] understand the the psyche as I say
[1:03:38] that's maybe me you guys might like
[1:03:40] something else you know whatever
[1:03:41] basketball think and obviously we have
[1:03:43] to be careful because that can overtake
[1:03:45] us also so yes you have to cater for the
[1:03:48] natural man but what Satan tries to do
[1:03:50] is push you so over this side and then
[1:03:52] you forget about spiritual man because
[1:03:54] just like you have to feed yourself
[1:03:56] Naturally Speaking you know we have our
[1:03:57] three meals a day and we even have what
[1:03:59] do you call it supper still what supper
[1:04:02] There we go the fourth meal of the day
[1:04:04] the Jubilee meal um you know even though
[1:04:07] we have that you know the end of the day
[1:04:09] is uh you also a spiritual man and if
[1:04:11] you're not going to feed the spirit man
[1:04:14] well you're going to be starving and
[1:04:15] lose weight spiritually speaking so you
[1:04:18] have to daily also allow for it you have
[1:04:20] to have a form of discipline so yes
[1:04:22] you're natural man you have to go to
[1:04:23] school you have to go to work you have
[1:04:24] to eat whatever whatever but you need to
[1:04:27] make time you know brother bam talks
[1:04:29] about a Christian should read at least
[1:04:30] one chapter of the Bible a day that's
[1:04:32] what he recommends and daily two one in
[1:04:34] the morning one in the evening and and
[1:04:35] put on a tape for 20 30 minutes It'll Do
[1:04:38] Your World of good and get on those
[1:04:40] knees like we heard you know this the
[1:04:41] weakest believer on his knees gets the
[1:04:43] whole Satan's uh you know uh Kingdom
[1:04:46] trembling because they know the power of
[1:04:48] a prayer you such as you know such as I
[1:04:50] when I'm in such a bad State like I've
[1:04:52] just really feel like I've messed up and
[1:04:54] displeased the Lord and I just feel like
[1:04:56] you know man I just wish I could what
[1:04:59] you know the situation you know what I
[1:05:00] actually get a real kick out of getting
[1:05:02] on my knees cuz it's like yes devil you
[1:05:05] got me but I'm it's so nice knowing that
[1:05:08] when I'm getting on my knees you are
[1:05:09] trembling back home I just love it it's
[1:05:11] like I'm getting one back at the Devil
[1:05:13] like you got me but I'm getting you back
[1:05:14] now because I know the effect that it's
[1:05:16] causing cuz he doesn't know what I'm
[1:05:18] saying to God and where I'm sorting out
[1:05:20] and cleaning out things cuz he knows as
[1:05:22] soon as you say sorry it's gone it's
[1:05:24] like gone disappeared yes we remember we
[1:05:26] have to deal with the consequences but
[1:05:28] in God's eyes it's disappeared totally
[1:05:30] vanished away so yeah we need to
[1:05:33] understand this so this quote I know
[1:05:34] many of you might know it but yet again
[1:05:36] I'm just going to go through it again
[1:05:37] because I need to lay a platform and I'm
[1:05:38] going to this is to help us all remember
[1:05:41] why do we get these little things in
[1:05:43] between us and it's often not an
[1:05:45] understanding of understanding the
[1:05:47] different people and temperaments and
[1:05:49] way they operate and that's what causes
[1:05:51] divisions and like I said some people
[1:05:53] are so spiritual no you can't talk about
[1:05:55] these things well the prophet talked
[1:05:56] about it so it's in the message as much
[1:05:58] as he preached the seals he preached
[1:05:59] these things so just say it as it is
[1:06:01] let's just get on the same platform the
[1:06:03] seals and everything we love but he also
[1:06:05] preached this cuz he was a balanced
[1:06:07] Christian okay so let's be balanced and
[1:06:10] let's not be overs spiritual with
[1:06:12] everything because this is the reality
[1:06:13] of life it's been one of the most
[1:06:15] amazing things I've ever noticed along
[1:06:17] in the lines of my Ministry for our Lord
[1:06:20] is the peculiarity of people cuz we're
[1:06:23] all different we have about different
[1:06:24] makeups look what he says here and the
[1:06:28] study some people call this
[1:06:30] psychology but look what he says you and
[1:06:32] the study of human life is one of the
[1:06:35] greatest things that a person can study
[1:06:38] that's the prophet speaking not
[1:06:40] Michael you take it or reject it it's
[1:06:43] there in the message you can't deny it
[1:06:45] to watch the nature of
[1:06:48] people and that's you know like I said
[1:06:51] that's what you could say psychology in
[1:06:53] a way but obviously psychology faltered
[1:06:55] through the word of God the psychology
[1:06:57] the world presents it has some a form of
[1:06:59] benefit and truth but it can't can only
[1:07:01] go so far cuz ultimately you need the
[1:07:03] supernatural element to back these
[1:07:06] things up you know it's not just
[1:07:08] psychology It's Supernatural psychology
[1:07:10] amen but we need as humans sometimes
[1:07:12] just a bit of psychology to say hey you
[1:07:15] got it you can do this that's
[1:07:17] psychology you know if you're Son of God
[1:07:19] you you you make it it anyways but when
[1:07:21] you're down pit you need someone to come
[1:07:22] and say you got this you know I'm here
[1:07:25] you're going to be good that's normal
[1:07:26] we're humans we need that sometimes and
[1:07:29] look what he says here this is
[1:07:30] fascinating he says in the different
[1:07:31] parts of the Nations and worlds to to
[1:07:33] where you go you'll notice there's a
[1:07:34] different attitude that people take
[1:07:36] towards Christ towards his service and
[1:07:38] towards his uh service towards a
[1:07:40] servants towards worship I mean the way
[1:07:43] you worship is different to what I'm
[1:07:44] used to and it's okay because I can see
[1:07:48] the spirit is pleased I get up here I'm
[1:07:49] feeling comfortable the spirit is here
[1:07:51] so you know we can be so quick to judge
[1:07:53] that that something I had to deal with I
[1:07:55] came from a very conservative white
[1:07:57] background and um you know for me to see
[1:08:00] someone just just be expressive to the
[1:08:01] Lord and jumping around and having a
[1:08:03] wonderful time in the in the presence of
[1:08:05] the Lord being a a white conservative uh
[1:08:07] person and I'm not saying all whites are
[1:08:09] conservative I'm saying me the way I was
[1:08:11] raised don't get me wrong you know the
[1:08:13] end of the day is that was something
[1:08:15] when I saw that it it's let me just say
[1:08:18] it as it is I thought that was not the
[1:08:21] Holy Ghost honestly I was like there's
[1:08:23] no way that the holy ghost that just
[1:08:24] can't be because that's just how will
[1:08:26] the holy ghost ever allow these type of
[1:08:28] things and then the Holy Ghost whispered
[1:08:30] to me and he said listen buddy don't let
[1:08:33] your shall we say tradition or the way
[1:08:37] you were raised in your mind make that
[1:08:41] as the shall we say the ultimatum if
[1:08:43] that is the holy ghost or
[1:08:46] not don't let your tradition say that's
[1:08:49] the holy ghost or not just because I
[1:08:51] feel uncomfortable cuz I'm feeling
[1:08:52] uncomfortable I'm feeling the a bit like
[1:08:54] grieved if I can put it like that cuz
[1:08:56] I'm not used to this and immediately my
[1:08:58] mind is saying this can't be the Holy
[1:08:59] Ghost cuz I'm not
[1:09:01] comfortable and then God say wait a
[1:09:03] second buddy watch the spirit on the
[1:09:06] person and what they trying to achieve
[1:09:08] and yes if it's for showman and trying
[1:09:11] to get attention and and and dancing
[1:09:13] provocative and whatever these things of
[1:09:15] course there's a problem there and it
[1:09:16] needs to be corrected but the end of the
[1:09:18] day is you know I'd watch these sisters
[1:09:20] they'll just be so happy or brothers and
[1:09:22] just rejoicing just so happy
[1:09:24] and then I looked at the eyes I looked
[1:09:26] at the spirit I realized oh man I want
[1:09:29] some of that
[1:09:30] actually you know and yes maybe my
[1:09:33] personality will never let me get to
[1:09:34] that point but you have to realize don't
[1:09:37] judge people by the way you were brought
[1:09:39] up judge it by the spirit behind it and
[1:09:43] let God even if they wrong let me say
[1:09:45] this even if they wrong allow the Holy
[1:09:48] Spirit to sort it out and not let your
[1:09:51] judgmental attitude sort it out
[1:09:54] okay and one of the things has been that
[1:09:57] one type of meeting will just be
[1:09:58] wonderful in one part of the country
[1:10:00] where it won't work in the other part of
[1:10:02] the country fascinating because why we
[1:10:04] have different temperamental different
[1:10:06] cultures things like that I was speaking
[1:10:07] to some of the brothers that go up to
[1:10:09] some of these Islands nearby and the way
[1:10:11] they dress they all these traditional
[1:10:13] things that is like weird for them you
[1:10:14] they're preaching to you know people
[1:10:16] that are dress a certain way and it just
[1:10:18] it's hard but you have to look past that
[1:10:20] and say well Lord in your good time if
[1:10:22] it's wrong you're going to sort it out
[1:10:24] but uh these people love you and let me
[1:10:26] minister to the
[1:10:28] need so there's different personality
[1:10:32] types there's different Natures of
[1:10:35] people now what was brother
[1:10:39] brandham he says yeah I'm a
[1:10:42] temperamental
[1:10:44] person
[1:10:46] Melancholy sort of
[1:10:48] person so he says he tells you his
[1:10:50] nature is human
[1:10:52] nature I can't let myself get
[1:10:56] away but now this is the important part
[1:10:59] because of his nature what does he say
[1:11:01] Satan takes
[1:11:03] advantage uh of that on
[1:11:06] me so we all we're going to go through
[1:11:08] this now we all have our little
[1:11:10] temperamental and personality traits and
[1:11:12] there's positives and there's negatives
[1:11:15] and Satan's going to focus on the
[1:11:17] negatives to try and slip you up and and
[1:11:20] and vice versa there's such positives
[1:11:22] that God can use if you're him but
[1:11:25] you're going to have to deal with that
[1:11:26] and most of the time we have conflicts
[1:11:29] amongst Brethren because of different
[1:11:31] personality types that come up against
[1:11:33] each other we'll show you now see I'm
[1:11:36] one of those types that could break down
[1:11:38] of course say goodbye to you in a few
[1:11:40] minutes I'd better do it but just so
[1:11:43] express myself I'll probably go to cry
[1:11:46] he's just a a Melancholy of heart you
[1:11:49] know if we break up now this youth
[1:11:51] service he's the type of nature he would
[1:11:52] he would put on his smile and everything
[1:11:54] when he's back home he's crying he's
[1:11:55] like I miss it I so enjoyed being
[1:11:57] amongst the people he loved the people
[1:12:00] but his nature just got affected by it
[1:12:04] and he says Satan used to take hold of
[1:12:06] him remember I speaking to you about the
[1:12:09] uh inferior complex he tolds you one of
[1:12:12] the main reasons why it drove me because
[1:12:14] of the rejection of the people because
[1:12:17] he was Melancholy by Nature because the
[1:12:19] people rejected him that is how Satan
[1:12:22] got in there and started to build up all
[1:12:24] these feelings that he's just going to
[1:12:25] run away to the Wilderness and try and
[1:12:28] Escape all that hurt instead of dealing
[1:12:30] with it because of his nature now
[1:12:34] another thing I want you to notice about
[1:12:36] brother brandom he was he was 100% a
[1:12:40] child of God a minister a
[1:12:43] pastor he was married he had a child and
[1:12:46] you know what happened because he
[1:12:48] listened to his mother-in-law that he
[1:12:50] lost his wife and his child this is a
[1:12:53] holy ghost minister of the Gospel the
[1:12:56] prophet of our age a major prophet no
[1:12:58] greater man most be born of a woman
[1:13:01] tried to commit suicide
[1:13:04] twice because of his Melancholy
[1:13:08] nature you can have the Holy Ghost but
[1:13:11] Satan can work it against your nature
[1:13:13] against you and you can find yourself in
[1:13:16] places that you shouldn't
[1:13:18] be so yes these things are powerful and
[1:13:21] if you want to ignore them do it at your
[1:13:22] peril it's fine but he's then Satan's
[1:13:24] just going to play you like a puppet and
[1:13:26] there comes a point when you have to
[1:13:27] start realizing who you are and identify
[1:13:30] your weaknesses what is the what does
[1:13:32] brother BR says how do you overcome to
[1:13:34] identify the devil in all his tricks
[1:13:37] including your own nature against you we
[1:13:40] trying to give you tools in the weeks
[1:13:42] and years ahead wherever however long
[1:13:44] the Lord carries so does anyone know
[1:13:47] okay well the four temperaments so we
[1:13:49] already
[1:13:50] covered
[1:13:51] melancholic now the best example in the
[1:13:54] Bible is mosha
[1:13:55] Elijah the highs and the lows of Elijah
[1:13:59] one minute he's rebuking uh you know
[1:14:02] killing the you know the fires coming
[1:14:03] down the altar you know killing off the
[1:14:05] prophets you know overcome and next
[1:14:08] minute he hear his word that Jezebel
[1:14:10] says I'm going to kill you he runs for
[1:14:11] his life and goes and mopes and becomes
[1:14:14] all depressed by the river and godest
[1:14:17] and God leaves him he's okay he
[1:14:19] understands Elijah he doesn't come there
[1:14:21] like Elijah my Prophet how dare you you
[1:14:24] no he's just leaves them and then slowly
[1:14:27] he starts to come and you if you can go
[1:14:29] read it how the Lord builds up and
[1:14:30] eventually comes to him in a small still
[1:14:32] voice that speaks to him so God
[1:14:35] understands this he's not he wasn't
[1:14:36] upset with Elijah he didn't blame him he
[1:14:37] didn't do nothing he left Elijah brother
[1:14:39] brandham also was melancholic and he had
[1:14:41] obviously had the spirit of Elijah like
[1:14:43] we know says no
[1:14:45] wonder okay does anyone else know
[1:14:48] another one coloric okay koric are we
[1:14:51] going to come to now I want another one
[1:14:53] sanguine another one last one flagma
[1:14:57] okay so we'll next go to
[1:15:00] flagma now fmatic we're going to go
[1:15:02] through but just to say in short which
[1:15:04] is my uh home base uh temperament is we
[1:15:08] very laidback and it takes a lot to
[1:15:10] drive us and a great example was Timothy
[1:15:13] because Paul was like come on Timothy
[1:15:15] you need to get out there you need to
[1:15:17] have faith step forward that people need
[1:15:18] you go and preach and Timothy's like oh
[1:15:20] I don't want you know uh but this is it
[1:15:22] this is what what what Timothy was he
[1:15:25] was a fmatic and uh he needed a bit of
[1:15:27] pushing you know to get the you know
[1:15:30] what do we say a bit of fire uh under
[1:15:33] him get get him get him going so there's
[1:15:37] the fmatic nature then we have sanguan
[1:15:40] we'll go through this now but sanguan
[1:15:42] Peter is the ultimate sanguan man he's
[1:15:45] the he's the loud one he's the one that
[1:15:48] you know uh you know he's is just like
[1:15:52] the the sort of like the shall we say
[1:15:53] the the the the vibe of the party you
[1:15:56] know he's like he's the the main
[1:15:58] attraction and you just see Peter he's
[1:15:59] always the first one to come and say
[1:16:01] something and he as much as he he gets
[1:16:03] into some good things he just as quickly
[1:16:05] gets himself into bad things you know as
[1:16:07] we said yesterday one minute he's saying
[1:16:09] you know Thou Art the son of the Living
[1:16:10] God and the next minute sat Jesus to say
[1:16:12] to him get there behind me Satan you
[1:16:15] know because this guy you know he's just
[1:16:17] his nature you
[1:16:19] know then the last one is cheric oh poor
[1:16:22] man if you go read Paul this guy was
[1:16:25] rough I mean he doesn't hold back I went
[1:16:29] and rebuked to Peter directly in his
[1:16:32] face not like trying to sit down you
[1:16:34] know can we talk this over he's a cleric
[1:16:37] he's just a he just boom you know he's a
[1:16:39] bulldozzer he
[1:16:40] just you know and these are examples in
[1:16:44] the Bible and you can clearly see it Go
[1:16:45] and read the scriptures you'll be
[1:16:46] fascinating to see how it
[1:16:49] is so let's go through some of these
[1:16:51] things hey
[1:16:53] and these things like I said you have to
[1:16:55] be so careful because there is the
[1:16:57] strengths and there's the weaknesses and
[1:16:59] you have to acknowledge both you must
[1:17:01] let the strengths be used of God but you
[1:17:03] must be careful that Satan also with the
[1:17:05] weaknesses is going to attack you in
[1:17:07] them so you must make sure you watch
[1:17:09] yourself so like I said there's the
[1:17:12] sanguine uh you know that's that's the
[1:17:14] peders of this world they're sociable
[1:17:17] charismatic like I say they the the vibe
[1:17:19] of the party you know you're going to
[1:17:21] Sure know when they arve they like the
[1:17:23] peacocks I a rough woo I'm here you know
[1:17:27] they are the guys like I said that uh
[1:17:30] you know you know they're there you know
[1:17:31] they're there and you there's no way
[1:17:34] you're going to miss them cuz they there
[1:17:35] they're at the party they're outgoing
[1:17:38] confident warmhearted
[1:17:40] Pleasant people they're Lively like us
[1:17:43] like we saying optimistic fun lover yeah
[1:17:46] let's go do this woo and we all often
[1:17:49] like sanguan guys and
[1:17:52] girls
[1:17:54] spontaneous a preventer of dull
[1:17:58] moments you know when you have that like

[1:20:21] together and bet you with those little
[1:20:23] skits uh some of those traits were
[1:20:26] coming

[1:20:30] the tasks that are
[1:20:31] boring
[1:20:33] self-absorbed and exaggerator man the
[1:20:36] fish was that's big it was incredible I
[1:20:41] fought it it was incredible it was like
[1:20:43] Wow
[1:20:49] meanwhile and then sometimes
[1:20:50] Unfortunately they can appear
[1:20:53] um authentic you know because you know
[1:20:56] it's all big ho haa and eventually
[1:20:58] people like catch on it's like ah you
[1:21:00] know so yeah you're going to have to if
[1:21:02] you're a sangan and some of you might
[1:21:04] ask well I don't know quite what I am
[1:21:06] well maybe ask a few
[1:21:09] friends or maybe just there is some good
[1:21:12] tests online you can Google uh how to
[1:21:14] find my temperament and then they'll ask
[1:21:16] you some questions and it'll split out
[1:21:18] uh thing and remember you can be
[1:21:19] affected you most likely everyone is
[1:21:21] affected in a small way about this
[1:21:23] doesn't mean you're 100% that but you
[1:21:25] just genely have a dominant one um you
[1:21:27] do get the extreme R where someone will
[1:21:30] have a whole bunch but uh like almost in
[1:21:32] the middle if you can say but generally
[1:21:34] you're going to have a a strong one so
[1:21:37] yeah um just go back sorry Brew this is
[1:21:40] something I wanted to highlight um so
[1:21:42] there you'll say soci soci socially
[1:21:44] useful so they're great if you want to
[1:21:46] get things going get a sanguan on board
[1:21:49] you know he's going to make she's going
[1:21:51] to make things go great actors you know
[1:21:54] they're not they're not scared to just
[1:21:55] get in front of the camera and display
[1:21:57] the peacock feathers they they ready
[1:21:59] they're ready they want to they willing
[1:22:02] okay they want to this is my ground this
[1:22:04] is where I'm comfortable good salesman
[1:22:05] man they'll talk talk talk talk talk and
[1:22:07] they'll eventually like okay just sell
[1:22:08] me the stupid thing I'm done you know
[1:22:10] but they just they're good good speakers
[1:22:13] stuff like that they actually also the
[1:22:15] the underline is air an air sign which
[1:22:18] means they're not always grounded and
[1:22:20] they tend to around
[1:22:24] yeah so there we go so there's our good
[1:22:27] old sanguine so let's go to uh
[1:22:30] ceric brother
[1:22:32] poor now we need clerics and I actually
[1:22:35] have a bit of ceric my my my dominant
[1:22:37] one is sang um uh fmatic but uh I I
[1:22:41] actually developed a bit of goric as I
[1:22:43] got older and had to realize I needed to
[1:22:44] sort out some problems that I had but
[1:22:47] we'll go there now so yeah um these guys
[1:22:50] are the the ruler dominating type you
[1:22:52] know it's their way you know it's like
[1:22:55] tunnel vision we'll get there now and
[1:22:57] they they're good leaders actually but
[1:22:59] they've got very bad people skills most
[1:23:01] of the time so often your bosses are
[1:23:04] cleric but they don't know how to like
[1:23:06] say hey good job you're such a benefit
[1:23:08] to the company you very seldom hear that
[1:23:11] unless they've gone for some you know
[1:23:13] some some counseling and realizing they
[1:23:16] need to be a bit more nicer but you know
[1:23:18] these guys you know producers of the
[1:23:19] movies you know they're like yeah the
[1:23:21] scene and no you weren't there you need
[1:23:22] to be there and they just have this
[1:23:24] vision and they want to see it and they
[1:23:25] drive it they build it so positive
[1:23:28] things but yet again strengths and
[1:23:31] weaknesses we'll go through the
[1:23:33] strengths ambitious passionate people
[1:23:37] leader-like they focus they so Focus
[1:23:40] efficient look at Paul I mean before he
[1:23:42] becomes a Christian he's a cheric you
[1:23:44] can see he's just going off to the
[1:23:46] churches like on a mission this guy is
[1:23:48] on a mission and it's so beautiful cuz
[1:23:51] God took that same CL nature against the
[1:23:53] church and swung it around for his sake
[1:23:56] and then he became a cheric against the
[1:23:57] forces of evil who just like so dominant
[1:24:00] so going ahead so focused I mean Paul
[1:24:03] what a guy in that way you know
[1:24:06] efficient very
[1:24:07] practical they very good at planners if
[1:24:10] you want to make an event go well and
[1:24:12] and things to work out get a cleric
[1:24:15] they're going to do a good job it's
[1:24:17] already a bit
[1:24:21] cleric
[1:24:24] let's go
[1:24:26] down
[1:24:28] okay uh good at problem solving they're
[1:24:31] very good they sort out things they're
[1:24:33] confident in their nature motivating a
[1:24:36] delegator you do this you you you play
[1:24:38] that part Etc usually
[1:24:42] right in their eyes at least doesn't
[1:24:44] mean they are but in their eyes they're
[1:24:46] usually right and yeah because they are
[1:24:48] so like Focus minded they Absol they can
[1:24:50] take a task and really focus on it and
[1:24:52] they become quite good at it that's why
[1:24:54] they're good leaders and they're good
[1:24:55] business people because they have a
[1:24:56] vision and they just drive that through
[1:24:58] greater an emergency cuz he's just he he
[1:25:01] can focus he's all like what am I going
[1:25:02] to do he's just like okay you get that
[1:25:04] and you go there pull this thing and
[1:25:06] boom bo boom and before you know the the
[1:25:07] situation under control that's a cleric
[1:25:10] so we need some clerics when the
[1:25:11] emergencies come we don't want a A
[1:25:14] fmatic in the emergency
[1:25:18] well should we call 911 or should we
[1:25:21] call the fiber GR and by that time the
[1:25:23] house is burned down you know so you
[1:25:25] need a cleric to make some moves here
[1:25:27] okay let's go back to the the negatives
[1:25:30] here okay some weaknesses they
[1:25:33] aggressive it's my way or no way okay
[1:25:36] you better get yourself in line get in
[1:25:39] line with the company's Vision otherwise
[1:25:41] you can catch the highway for I
[1:25:43] care domineering they inter flexible but
[1:25:48] boss you know can't we no it's my way
[1:25:51] listen to me I know what I'm doing
[1:25:53] impatient this is a big problem of
[1:25:55] clerics they very impatient with
[1:25:58] understanding other people and like I
[1:26:00] said if you know you're cleric you need
[1:26:01] to take note of these things they rude
[1:26:03] and tus they just say it as it
[1:26:06] is it's like
[1:26:09] oh you could have said it a little bit
[1:26:11] softer man you didn't have to say I'm
[1:26:13] that ugly just said you know only your
[1:26:16] mother can love you or whatever just but
[1:26:18] you don't have to be so harsh man and
[1:26:21] yet they really yo these guys are
[1:26:25] rough hope he doesn't mind me saying but
[1:26:27] I have like a 80 90% cheric uh uh
[1:26:31] brother-in-law if you hear this
[1:26:33] brother-in-law forgive me hopefully you
[1:26:35] don't but yes this guy I work for him
[1:26:38] man it was
[1:26:39] rough so we're on outdoor sites and you
[1:26:42] know as I said I'm ftic and this guy is
[1:26:45] just like he's a task master he's like
[1:26:48] and it's like yeah and like for me it's
[1:26:51] it's straight he's like it's not
[1:26:53] straight make it straighter go walk
[1:26:55] there walk yeah walk there walk yeah
[1:26:57] walk
[1:26:59] yeah man he was
[1:27:03] rough rude and tackas argumentative
[1:27:05] unable to relax they sit down for 5
[1:27:09] minutes they're up again hey just chill
[1:27:12] yeah yeah I know and you sit down and
[1:27:13] then before you get it they up in
[1:27:14] another
[1:27:17] Direction uncomfortable around
[1:27:20] emotion someone get emotion man they
[1:27:23] just they don't know what to
[1:27:26] do low on
[1:27:29] empathy don't really understand and put
[1:27:32] themselves in other people's shoes like
[1:27:33] I said even though you're in this God
[1:27:35] can do something for
[1:27:37] you discouraged by failures so a a
[1:27:41] cheric you know for him it's like the
[1:27:44] world to to achieve his dream and if
[1:27:47] things go wrong with his dream it can
[1:27:49] almost make him almost
[1:27:50] suicidal cuz he's not prepared to see
[1:27:53] that there's maybe more going on around
[1:27:55] him and so it actually can be a real
[1:27:57] problem when you are so focused on what
[1:27:59] I must achieve and then it falls apart
[1:28:02] and then you feel like a complete
[1:28:03] failure and that you're just useless
[1:28:05] meanwhile it's okay just get up there'll
[1:28:07] be another opportunity but clerics are
[1:28:09] because they're so tunnel vision so
[1:28:11] minded it can be a real
[1:28:13] problem too busy for
[1:28:15] people come come come come what why are
[1:28:18] you taking so long stop brushing your
[1:28:19] teeth come get in the car what's going
[1:28:20] on intolerance
[1:28:23] and they demand loyalty they want if you
[1:28:25] if you don't show loyalty to keric hey
[1:28:28] it's going to be hard for them it's
[1:28:30] going to be hard for them it's going to
[1:28:32] be hurting so yeah they are the more hot
[1:28:34] shall we say quick response people they
[1:28:36] they got it they they ready they're
[1:28:37] ready ready go go go now let's move to
[1:28:40] the other side the more chilled out
[1:28:41] people yeah I hope I got some chilled
[1:28:43] out people in the house so we got some
[1:28:44] chilled out people yeah let's go let's
[1:28:46] go okay let's go to the next one
[1:28:49] Brew like I said you need to understand
[1:28:52] God is giving you nature and you're
[1:28:53] going to see what the prophet says it's
[1:28:54] not bad that with when God when God
[1:28:56] gives you particular nature it's just
[1:28:58] what you do with it okay fmatic let's
[1:29:01] now make me the the test dummy okay so
[1:29:05] I'm relaxed it is good to relax
[1:29:06] sometimes we need to be relaxed
[1:29:08] sometimes quiet and calm it's true you
[1:29:11] can ask my wife I'm I'm the calm one in
[1:29:12] the in the family when things start
[1:29:14] going crazy I'm chill content with
[1:29:17] themselves we generally pretty kind yeah
[1:29:20] consistent H yeah a steady and faithful
[1:29:24] friend yeah I believe I am hey some good
[1:29:27] stuff here keep going keep going uh
[1:29:30] accepting affectionate diplomatic you
[1:29:33] know
[1:29:34] peacemakers rational curious oo that was
[1:29:38] a bad one for me because I got curious
[1:29:40] about some bad things at one stage but
[1:29:42] anyways The Lord At least sorted that
[1:29:44] out but nonetheless observant and easy
[1:29:47] friend maker so yeah we good guys right
[1:29:49] right oh boy let's see what it says
[1:29:51] about about me now sometimes shy yeah
[1:29:54] that's true I really struggle I'll be
[1:29:55] honest maybe this will surprise you cuz
[1:29:57] I'm standing behind the pulpit and seem
[1:29:58] so relaxed and so so so good but I
[1:30:00] really struggle in a big crowd like I
[1:30:02] really do like I rather just stand
[1:30:04] quietly on the sidelines but yet again
[1:30:06] if you told me hey make something happen
[1:30:08] then I'm cool then I'll get involved and
[1:30:09] I'll coordinate but I'm not comfortable
[1:30:12] in a big crowd it's just that's my
[1:30:13] nature it just is what it is fearful of
[1:30:16] change yeah that is so true with with me
[1:30:19] I you know I've I'm like I've been with
[1:30:21] my job now for what uh 17 18 years same
[1:30:24] company I don't like change I don't like
[1:30:26] to move around I don't like I like just
[1:30:28] to have my root settled that's that's my
[1:30:30] nature but this is where the problem
[1:30:32] comes in I'm prone to
[1:30:35] laziness now you don't may not know this
[1:30:38] but Alo and I actually worked for a
[1:30:39] portion of time and this is
[1:30:40] unfortunately there was some weaknesses
[1:30:42] that really came through in my work life
[1:30:45] where I was literally prone to laziness
[1:30:46] I had like almost no ambition I didn't
[1:30:48] pursue and and I actually almost got
[1:30:50] fired not under brother Al such but
[1:30:53] under a different division and then the
[1:30:54] Lord made a way and then I I went
[1:30:56] through life sort of just hanging in
[1:30:58] there and then I got married and and
[1:31:00] then there came a point where I realized
[1:31:01] I need to really provide for my family
[1:31:03] and I need to tackle this laziness issue
[1:31:05] I've got and by God's grace he helped me
[1:31:07] deal with this laziness and but I still
[1:31:10] you'll be honest when I want to just
[1:31:12] become relaxed I automatically want to
[1:31:14] become lazy again and I have to tell
[1:31:15] motivate myself hey get off this chair
[1:31:17] and work and I say it might seem strange
[1:31:20] but that's my nature I just like to to
[1:31:23] to to to to sit around but but when I
[1:31:25] then but then as I said it's a inward
[1:31:27] motivation that's why I say I was
[1:31:29] naturally uh uh fmatic but I managed to
[1:31:32] get a bit of choleric and start you know
[1:31:34] pushing the head a bit more but
[1:31:36] hopefully with still the good stuff
[1:31:37] attached to it stubborn yeah we can be a
[1:31:41] bit stubborn at times you know passive
[1:31:44] aggressive indecisive no I don't think
[1:31:46] that's one of my weaknesses no no
[1:31:50] not no I'm not indecisive I think that's
[1:31:52] one thing I've either the Lord's
[1:31:54] delivered me or you know just like I
[1:31:56] said it's not going to be 100% but
[1:31:58] there'll be some things permissive uh
[1:32:00] not goal orientated exactly it comes in
[1:32:03] with the laziness it's un exactly the
[1:32:05] same unenthusiastic that's something I
[1:32:06] had to work on that's why some's good to
[1:32:08] be married because you'll marry the your
[1:32:10] better half that will teach you some
[1:32:12] things that you need to get a bit of
[1:32:13] life or whatever going into certain
[1:32:15] things you know uh too
[1:32:18] compromising that's truth I have to be
[1:32:21] careful there
[1:32:22] you know I sometimes have to tell myself
[1:32:24] hey you know you need to now make a
[1:32:25] stand and be a bit more firm maybe about
[1:32:27] these things you know undisciplined H I
[1:32:30] don't think I'm quite that I'm pretty
[1:32:31] good I think uh when it comes to the
[1:32:34] kids at least and stuff like that uh
[1:32:36] sarcastic yay I struggle with this
[1:32:39] one yeah I know sometimes as I've hurt
[1:32:41] some people but I miss so I try to
[1:32:44] that's something I've just Tred to watch
[1:32:45] because some people don't take well to
[1:32:47] sarcasm and sometimes sarcasm has a bit
[1:32:49] of a nasty Edge to it you you've been
[1:32:52] sarcastic but you're trying to make a
[1:32:53] point and not always but you know in
[1:32:56] certain environments it's just good old
[1:32:57] friends but I need to watch that thing
[1:32:58] of me cuz I naturally am sarcastic and I
[1:33:01] like being sarcastic but it can hurt so
[1:33:04] I must be careful discouraging I must
[1:33:06] say I'm okay my my other sort of natural
[1:33:08] n nature I don't really get discouraged
[1:33:11] thankfully I've been at my moment I must
[1:33:12] say during Co I got very discouraged
[1:33:14] because you know sitting at home can't
[1:33:16] work for my family funds was a massive
[1:33:17] issue so yeah then then I I I touched
[1:33:20] Bas a little bit there but generally I'm
[1:33:22] okay uh non participative um yeah middle
[1:33:26] of the road something like that but like
[1:33:28] I said you guys would know roughly where
[1:33:30] you would fit in there okay and then
[1:33:35] melancholic that's my
[1:33:37] wife but not in a bad way not in a you
[1:33:39] know we need to understand and she we
[1:33:42] her and I have spoken about these things
[1:33:43] that we need to watch these things and
[1:33:45] that's why also when you get married it
[1:33:46] can be a real blessing if you really
[1:33:48] understand this cuz then you can help
[1:33:49] your partner and vice versa she can help
[1:33:52] me and I can help her so this is where
[1:33:55] the Prophet was and you can actually see
[1:33:57] it in his actions and the way the
[1:33:59] messenger was delivered we needed a
[1:34:03] Melancholy Prophet that may sound
[1:34:05] strange but you'll see now the strength
[1:34:08] of it and even to a to a form of
[1:34:10] weaknesses that the prophet had that
[1:34:12] actually was real a benefit and made the
[1:34:15] message what it was God used that nature
[1:34:17] for his benefit so brother Brandon was
[1:34:20] thoughtful he was considerate that
[1:34:23] really you can see it in the prayer
[1:34:24] lines you can see those one-on-one
[1:34:25] interviews uh and and even uh you know
[1:34:27] people's testimonies of how they were
[1:34:29] around the prophet um you know really
[1:34:32] really nice he was cautious he actually
[1:34:34] got rebuked by the the angel one time
[1:34:36] cuz he never wanted to move forward
[1:34:38] unless he had a direct visitation uh uh
[1:34:41] vision from uh the the Lord and the
[1:34:43] angel came to him and rebuked him and
[1:34:44] said stop pretty much stop being so
[1:34:46] cautious and just let the Holy Ghost
[1:34:48] leading come and he will show you where
[1:34:50] to go but stop always waiting for a
[1:34:52] vision cuz brother Bram was overly
[1:34:55] cautious
[1:34:57] organized an excessive planner man these
[1:35:01] people cross their Bridges like way
[1:35:03] before they meant to like it like
[1:35:06] painful it's like why are you talking
[1:35:08] about that in 3 years this might take
[1:35:12] what are you going about who it might
[1:35:13] never happen why are you even thinking
[1:35:15] about that's what I'm saying but my wife
[1:35:18] she doesn't mind we we got an open
[1:35:20] relationship in that way she's like this
[1:35:22] she's an excessive planner keeps
[1:35:23] crossing her Bridges oh but what if this
[1:35:25] one says that and and then I'm going to
[1:35:27] come in this situation and they're going
[1:35:28] to say this and I'm like you haven't
[1:35:29] even spoken about it what are you saying
[1:35:31] and then often she gets to that
[1:35:32] situation and the whole thing blows up
[1:35:34] and then it's like oh oh that wasn't too
[1:35:37] bad man I may spent hours worried about
[1:35:40] this thing sleepness nights and it was
[1:35:43] like yeah it's fun what that all yeah
[1:35:47] it's
[1:35:48] fun schedule oriented
[1:35:52] when they can of course not always but
[1:35:55] yeah they like a schedule they like to
[1:35:56] know what's going on very detailed which
[1:35:59] is
[1:36:00] nice it's in a small detail you can see
[1:36:03] good things highly creative and poetry
[1:36:05] art and invention most of the time not
[1:36:08] always and most of the time poets and
[1:36:09] artists and stuff are naturally um uh
[1:36:14] Melancholy by nature but it's also very
[1:36:17] dangerous cuz like brother BR shows in
[1:36:18] some of the message you're going on a
[1:36:20] massive High
[1:36:22] and you write an incredible song an
[1:36:24] incredible poem or whatever and then you
[1:36:26] go crashing way down and then the devil
[1:36:30] meets you at the bottom and
[1:36:32] unfortunately even some artists is very
[1:36:34] well known you can go look at it they
[1:36:36] they eventually go crazy they L up
[1:36:38] insane institutions and stuff because
[1:36:39] they can't handle this and you're going
[1:36:41] to have to understand God can use the
[1:36:43] highs absolutely but just remember
[1:36:45] what's coming and say Lord I need you
[1:36:47] now walk with me in the valley that I'm
[1:36:49] about to enter but you're incredible
[1:36:52] amazing people really creative lovely
[1:36:55] bunch to be around in that way uh
[1:36:57] independent and good at preventing
[1:36:59] problems so you can see this was a
[1:37:02] really needed even in the message many
[1:37:04] of these good qualities you know
[1:37:06] understanding problems of of in a
[1:37:08] spiritual sense and and letting the Lord
[1:37:10] reveal it and then laying it out so
[1:37:12] let's go to the weaknesses here so yeah
[1:37:15] unfortunately they a bit obsessive they
[1:37:17] can really really go over the top with
[1:37:19] some stuff it's just like man it doesn't
[1:37:22] have to be that clean okay just leave it
[1:37:26] alone the dust is happy there it doesn't
[1:37:29] need to be removed just leave it but
[1:37:30] it's like there must shine Sparkle and
[1:37:33] you know they're really
[1:37:36] like too cautious you know they don't
[1:37:38] want to venture out in the unknown and
[1:37:41] it's scary territory you know but if you
[1:37:44] had a ceric or a sanguan they just like
[1:37:47] no issues but but yeah The Melancholy is
[1:37:50] very cautious but this is the problem
[1:37:52] now with Melancholy you are prone to
[1:37:54] depression like the prophet often
[1:37:57] struggled with depression so if you're
[1:37:59] prone to depression you have to watch
[1:38:01] that because that depressive uh uh sort
[1:38:04] of a weakness Satan will try and use it
[1:38:06] and get in there and you'll literally
[1:38:08] start having suicidal thoughts and all
[1:38:10] these things I'm not good enough I don't
[1:38:13] have what it takes you know I'm Just a
[1:38:15] Nobody I'm this and I'm that and I'm not
[1:38:17] pretty enough and I'm not handsome
[1:38:18] enough or whatever it is that you think
[1:38:20] is important in your eyes and he'll come
[1:38:22] and take that and try and make you so
[1:38:25] deep in depression that you you'll want
[1:38:27] to take your life and the prophet
[1:38:30] struggled with this like I said because
[1:38:32] he so disappointed with himself that he
[1:38:34] didn't follow God and then the re
[1:38:36] remember what he remember he sold the
[1:38:37] principle you you you you reap what you
[1:38:39] sow and unfortunately the the the
[1:38:41] reaping was horrible and he just wanted
[1:38:43] to end his life right there and then but
[1:38:45] by God's grace God intervened Amen cuz
[1:38:48] he pulled the trigger he put his hand on
[1:38:52] that electric wire to be electrocuted he
[1:38:53] did not
[1:38:54] stop it was God that somehow broke the
[1:38:59] link between the bullet and that
[1:39:01] electric wire because he would have been
[1:39:03] dead if it wasn't for God's intervention
[1:39:05] and may the Lord intervene for every
[1:39:07] single time any of you may enter those
[1:39:10] dark places that there will be someone
[1:39:12] to help you in the time of need and I
[1:39:14] want you to look out for each other to
[1:39:17] watch for these things please and
[1:39:20] remember the depressive
[1:39:22] people what do most people say when they
[1:39:24] when their kids find out their kids have
[1:39:26] committed suicide the parents come and
[1:39:27] say oh but he looked fine he looked
[1:39:30] happy we didn't
[1:39:33] know you have to watch out because
[1:39:36] sometimes it's just a facade it's just a
[1:39:38] picture they putting on but deep down
[1:39:40] inside there's deep hurt and you need to
[1:39:42] go some to those places and explore and
[1:39:44] just touch base and just check and make
[1:39:46] sure and just like how you doing oh I'm
[1:39:48] fine don't just take I am fine maybe
[1:39:51] just spend some time and they just need
[1:39:52] someone to give them a good word and a
[1:39:54] good season because my wife she doesn't
[1:39:57] mind saying this but you know we went
[1:39:58] through a massive trial as a family
[1:40:00] because my wife after the birth of my
[1:40:02] second son her adrenal glands
[1:40:05] practically well they did
[1:40:06] collapse now for me it's very weird
[1:40:09] because I like I said my nature you know
[1:40:11] is I don't struggle with that stuff as I
[1:40:13] said I'm generally a very happy person
[1:40:15] but what remember how does the devil
[1:40:16] work he finds a weakness remember the
[1:40:18] mind like the damage and that's when he
[1:40:19] gets a a demon in that channel so what
[1:40:22] my wife had she got adrenal fatigue and
[1:40:25] the devil got in depression the demon of
[1:40:27] depression so the body had a weakness
[1:40:29] the devil found it and it is depressing
[1:40:31] because you think about it my M my wife
[1:40:33] wants to be a mother she wants to be a
[1:40:35] wife to me and now she doesn't have the
[1:40:37] energy to deal with it and how she would
[1:40:40] describe it and as it say strange but
[1:40:42] it's almost like you're lying on the bed
[1:40:44] and something is pushing you into the
[1:40:46] bed that it even feels hard to raise
[1:40:48] your hand now that something is weird if
[1:40:51] you don't understand it but if you we
[1:40:52] were by God's grace you had an open
[1:40:54] dialect that she could honestly speak to
[1:40:56] these things and I could in my best
[1:40:57] ability try and put myself in her shoes
[1:41:00] and then we would work around it was it
[1:41:02] tough absolutely I had to at one stage
[1:41:04] become the mother the you know the
[1:41:06] cleaner the cook you know everything
[1:41:08] because my wife couldn't but there was a
[1:41:09] season we took through and by God's
[1:41:11] grace we came out but she was be honest
[1:41:13] she said she came to a point when she
[1:41:15] had Suicidal Thoughts I remember once
[1:41:18] she had a real bad moment and she fo me
[1:41:20] say I can't do this please come and pick
[1:41:22] up the kids and take them to the
[1:41:24] grandparents and when I saw her and the
[1:41:26] way she kissed my kids goodbye I thought
[1:41:29] I might come back to her lying in the
[1:41:31] blood bath or something like that
[1:41:32] because it looked like she was at her
[1:41:34] end and I was just praying and saying
[1:41:35] Lord please undertake I knew I had to
[1:41:37] get the kids out and there's going to be
[1:41:39] a space of time before I can get back
[1:41:41] home by God's grace he helped him this
[1:41:44] is what you to understand people look at
[1:41:46] uh
[1:41:48] suicide as a shall we say a a a selfish
[1:41:53] thing they think that people do it
[1:41:55] because they're selfish and they just
[1:41:57] want to sort of cut themselves from the
[1:41:58] world and they they don't want to it's
[1:42:00] not like that a a suicidal person thinks
[1:42:03] they doing you a favor by removing
[1:42:06] themselves out of your life that's how
[1:42:09] it actually goes it's not that they're
[1:42:10] selfish they're actually thinking
[1:42:12] they're doing you a favor by removing
[1:42:14] because you are better without them so
[1:42:17] my wife would look at my burden
[1:42:18] obviously having to say fulfill the
[1:42:20] roles of the whole family cuzz she was
[1:42:22] too weak to do anything and ultimately
[1:42:24] she was thinking it's better I just die
[1:42:27] so that my husband can marry another
[1:42:29] woman and then at least they can have a
[1:42:31] normal household meanwhile I loved her
[1:42:34] and she was the one that God gave to me
[1:42:36] and I just wouldn't want anyone else and
[1:42:37] I had to remind her and encourage her
[1:42:39] during the dark times so these are real
[1:42:43] things brothers and sisters and if you
[1:42:44] want to ignore them you do it at your
[1:42:45] peril and brother baham says God's grace
[1:42:48] is amazing cuz he shows there in the de
[1:42:50] demonology say is that even if you
[1:42:51] completely lose your mind God can still
[1:42:54] be with you and you can have the Holy
[1:42:56] Ghost and still be a saved Son of God or
[1:42:58] a daughter of God even if you lose your
[1:43:00] mind completely so yes there's Grace
[1:43:02] that extends right through but let's not
[1:43:05] get there we have the tools to prevent
[1:43:08] these things we just need to be out
[1:43:09] remember we're talking about brotherly
[1:43:10] kindness sisterly kindness let's look
[1:43:12] out for each other and and and trust and
[1:43:14] Trust to open yourself and I want to say
[1:43:16] this brother and sisters make yourself
[1:43:19] trustworthy that when a fellow youth
[1:43:22] member friend comes to you that stays
[1:43:24] between you some of us I don't know why
[1:43:27] we have this urge that we want to share
[1:43:30] little things amongst us become a
[1:43:33] trustworthy faithful friend because
[1:43:35] there was such power in that and it's
[1:43:38] tempting hey there's some juicy stories
[1:43:41] out there but keep it to yourself man
[1:43:44] that's when unfortunately these things
[1:43:46] come between us and then we find there's
[1:43:47] division amongst us but there's such
[1:43:50] strength lying in these pews before me
[1:43:52] you are such a strength to each other
[1:43:54] and when the Bible says confess your
[1:43:56] faults one to the other it must be under
[1:43:58] the sanctity and the umbrella of
[1:44:00] complete
[1:44:01] trust so if someone comes to you
[1:44:03] honestly and says listen pray for me
[1:44:05] brother I have suffering from
[1:44:08] pornography you know fellow sister pray
[1:44:11] for me I'm feeling like I just want to
[1:44:12] expose myself and get attention from
[1:44:14] other boys and stuff there's something
[1:44:16] I'm lacking don't now share that you
[1:44:18] make that your little Santi between you
[1:44:21] and have a little WhatsApp connection
[1:44:24] pray for me I'm feeling really bad at
[1:44:25] the moment so you that are even
[1:44:27] depressive don't be ashamed to tell
[1:44:30] someone that hey I'm struggling with
[1:44:31] depression by now we should be a mature
[1:44:33] enough Christians to understand that
[1:44:35] these things can be amongst us we not
[1:44:37] exempt from it sicknesses don't stop
[1:44:41] here okay they don't stop here many
[1:44:44] think in the message that sickness is
[1:44:45] only allowed to stop you can have cancer
[1:44:48] you know you can have high blood
[1:44:49] pressure praise God we praying for you
[1:44:50] you you have depression that's a devil
[1:44:52] that needs to remove of course it's a
[1:44:54] devil but so is flu a devil that's yours
[1:44:57] to get everything's a devil okay so you
[1:44:59] need to be balanced with these things
[1:45:00] and stop and just break what you think
[1:45:03] is is the realities of of what you think
[1:45:06] is the message and let yourself open to
[1:45:08] all things so these depressive things
[1:45:11] many a Christian has died inside because
[1:45:14] they couldn't open up themselves cuz
[1:45:16] they knew it's going to have such bad
[1:45:18] backlash and they're going to get such
[1:45:20] cuz when you are depressed the last
[1:45:22] thing you want to hear you know is
[1:45:24] someone even adding more coal on the
[1:45:26] fire like we say more pressure so you
[1:45:28] just rather keep it to yourself and you
[1:45:30] live in this world of of continuous
[1:45:32] cycle when there's help out there there
[1:45:34] is such strength amongst each other if
[1:45:36] we would just allow it so make yourself
[1:45:38] a trustworthy friend and if you have
[1:45:40] broken that trust go and make it right
[1:45:42] and say From This Day Forward by God's
[1:45:45] grace I'll be the friend you need me to
[1:45:47] be and I'll be the brother you need me
[1:45:48] to be amen have I got you by in there
[1:45:52] amen let's be that I mean let's be let's
[1:45:54] be real because essentially we have each
[1:45:56] other and so much strength lies in front
[1:45:58] of us where was I perfectionist
[1:46:01] pessimistic uh I said depression prone
[1:46:03] to moodiness brother Bram so many times
[1:46:05] says I'm a moody person he says it so
[1:46:07] many times go go type in Moody you'll be
[1:46:09] surprised how many times whether brah
[1:46:10] talks about him being moody or stuff
[1:46:12] like that because was a Melancholy
[1:46:14] perfectionist now this was strange this
[1:46:17] is actually a weakness but but God took
[1:46:20] it around and make it a positive for the
[1:46:22] message I want a perfectionistic message
[1:46:26] I want a prophet that will double check
[1:46:28] everything with the scripture am I sure
[1:46:30] this is right you know and when he came
[1:46:33] and brought us the message we had a true
[1:46:35] you know Wonderful message so God can
[1:46:37] use some of these things and turn it
[1:46:39] around where were we uh pessimistic
[1:46:42] unfortunately yeah you can be a bit too
[1:46:44] pessimistic look on the B side difficult
[1:46:45] to
[1:46:47] please let's go to the bottom half the
[1:46:49] brother Joe
[1:46:52] uh deeply affected by tragedy some
[1:46:55] people just feel feel hurt a lot more
[1:46:57] some of us like a a cheric you know it's
[1:47:00] like okay we buryed them next you know
[1:47:02] it's just like they're rough I mean but
[1:47:04] like you'll see others they will weeping
[1:47:06] you can see they're so burdened you know
[1:47:09] and you know we need to make space for
[1:47:11] these people you know we need to make
[1:47:13] sure we understand there different
[1:47:14] people around us you know a person with
[1:47:17] tunnel
[1:47:18] vision sometimes a procrastinator yeah
[1:47:20] yeah that's yeah I know that I'm married
[1:47:23] to
[1:47:25] one forgive me love don't worry we we
[1:47:27] open dialect remember we have to be
[1:47:28] honest and open in order to get
[1:47:31] somewhere and as I said I've I've I've
[1:47:33] also got all my bad points but we talk
[1:47:35] about it we even laugh about it you know
[1:47:37] and it's cool because we must
[1:47:38] acknowledge these things and S as it's
[1:47:40] good to make humor of it you know so and
[1:47:42] tease each other you know whatever it is
[1:47:44] you know because it's good to understand
[1:47:46] it and by acknowledging it remember how
[1:47:48] do you solve something find the root
[1:47:50] cause we spoke about that yesterday so
[1:47:53] acknowledge I've got a problem and I
[1:47:54] need to sort it out and when as I said
[1:47:56] you got each other discontent with
[1:47:59] themselves and others always CR very
[1:48:02] critical on themselves I have to
[1:48:03] constantly tell my wife you you're
[1:48:05] amazing you're beautiful you're
[1:48:07] incredible because she needs that and I
[1:48:09] think most people actually need a bit of
[1:48:11] that I think we all need even the cheric
[1:48:12] that's super confident and a bulldozer
[1:48:15] needs down again to say hey good job you
[1:48:17] know prone to play the mar
[1:48:22] yeah you'll be the victim no don't have
[1:48:25] that mentality amen because Satan yet
[1:48:27] again will will go there and say you
[1:48:29] know you don't have what it takes you
[1:48:31] know and then the the natural Melancholy
[1:48:33] person you can see with the prophet go
[1:48:34] through all these rough hard things so
[1:48:38] yeah these things are interesting and
[1:48:39] like I said if you don't know quite
[1:48:40] where you fit in and you could have a
[1:48:42] bit of both or you could have quite a
[1:48:43] nice mixture you know as I said go and
[1:48:45] Google it you'll find some good tests
[1:48:46] you can do online but these things are
[1:48:48] really important and like I said you you
[1:48:50] can ignore them fine but the prophet
[1:48:53] said I'm Melancholy and the devil uses
[1:48:55] that against
[1:48:57] me we going to expose the devil on all
[1:48:59] his tricks and you need understand where
[1:49:01] he's going to get you because all of
[1:49:02] these things have weaknesses a lot of
[1:49:04] positives but they have the weaknesses
[1:49:05] and you have to acknowledge those
[1:49:06] weaknesses and work on
[1:49:08] them okay let's move
[1:49:11] on now this is just to give you an
[1:49:14] example of the process of getting us so
[1:49:16] maybe one of those things is stubborn I
[1:49:18] was the fmatic one of my weaknesses with
[1:49:20] stubbornness okay so we have to know how
[1:49:22] do we deal with this what do I do to
[1:49:24] sort out these things brother brandham
[1:49:25] I'm saved so yeah you're a Christian wow
[1:49:27] wonderful and mean baptized in the name
[1:49:29] of Jesus H but how do I get away from a
[1:49:32] stubborn spirit that I can't seem to
[1:49:34] break away from well my Christian
[1:49:37] brother or sister whoever it may be now
[1:49:39] most times when you get people that's
[1:49:41] got a stubborn spirit it's usually a
[1:49:43] complex that causes this either they
[1:49:46] have inherited from a mother father
[1:49:48] uncle aunt or grandmother Grand
[1:49:50] grandfather something like that it's in
[1:49:51] your traits because remember a lot of
[1:49:52] your these Temperance you're talking
[1:49:54] about you've been affected through
[1:49:55] lineages and all these things that have
[1:49:56] come down and if you're Trace back
[1:49:58] through your life you'll find now I've
[1:50:00] taken this by experience under the zman
[1:50:02] because I've met uh cases on the
[1:50:05] platform thousands of those who had that
[1:50:06] spirit so he knows it a lot of people
[1:50:08] got this problem and the the first thing
[1:50:10] you know I'll chase that Spirit right
[1:50:12] back by discernment and find out that it
[1:50:13] was a granddaddy there was a grandmother
[1:50:15] there was something else back there and
[1:50:17] you inherit that by Nature stubborn
[1:50:19] stubbornness is not of God so those
[1:50:20] weaknesses we went through it's not an
[1:50:22] excuse as much as God understands you
[1:50:24] and he understanded Elijah when he
[1:50:25] formed him and but he still had to get
[1:50:27] Elijah out of that condition but God has
[1:50:30] a way to deal with it you know thank God
[1:50:32] thank thank goodness we have a God that
[1:50:33] really knows how to deal with
[1:50:35] us and now the only way you get away
[1:50:37] from that is you have to have faith to
[1:50:39] overcome that you are Christians you
[1:50:41] have to say Lord remember we spoke about
[1:50:43] it yesterday you're going to have to
[1:50:45] identify the problem I've got a weakness
[1:50:46] I've got a I've got this issue Lord help
[1:50:49] me and Deliver Me from that put your
[1:50:50] faith forward and even yet again we said
[1:50:53] yesterday even when you see yourself
[1:50:54] fail don't focus on the failing focus on
[1:50:56] the confession and the faith and then
[1:50:59] let him heal the situation and this can
[1:51:02] take years sometimes you are a son or
[1:51:04] daughter of God whichever you may be and
[1:51:06] you'll never be able just to stand and
[1:51:08] rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke
[1:51:11] it now listen we need we need to be
[1:51:13] prayed over sometimes but sometimes we
[1:51:15] can be a little bit over the top because
[1:51:18] as much as you know as I said I can
[1:51:20] stand here and say in the name of Jesus
[1:51:21] Christ remove yourself or brother Bram
[1:51:24] sayia you know if you want to say I
[1:51:26] rebuke that uh stub nature me I rebuke
[1:51:29] it I rebuke it it's fine but you're
[1:51:31] actually giving it attention essentially
[1:51:34] you're giving it so much attention when
[1:51:36] that's not actually the point that's not
[1:51:37] actually what isn't what is needed we
[1:51:38] need to get that thing out and we need
[1:51:40] to rather focus on the faith element
[1:51:42] look what he says here just like
[1:51:44] tantalizing a
[1:51:45] rattlesnake wow hey the prophet has such
[1:51:48] wisdom with these things it's unbel
[1:51:49] unable so yeah you want to just rebuke
[1:51:52] and rebuke and and hit it hard and just
[1:51:54] put all your attention on it you have to
[1:51:55] S of just commit it to God and move on
[1:51:59] and ignore it but if you never want to
[1:52:01] move on with God you want to stay with
[1:52:03] this thing and keep going keep going you
[1:52:05] just playing with a rat or snake and
[1:52:07] he's going to bite you and bite you over
[1:52:09] and over again and you're never going to
[1:52:11] move on as a Christian because you're so
[1:52:13] focused on this thing meanwhile
[1:52:16] committed to God have faith he'll sorted
[1:52:18] out in this time with it's one second as
[1:52:20] a miracle or 10 years as a healing
[1:52:23] either way you've committed to God and
[1:52:25] you ignore that thing and every time
[1:52:26] this is what the prophet gives us a
[1:52:27] solution I love it cuz he doesn't just
[1:52:29] leave it there he's laying there ready
[1:52:31] to bite you this is the secret if you'll
[1:52:34] just ignore him and walk away from him
[1:52:37] he can't hurt
[1:52:39] you so when you feel that you got a
[1:52:41] stubborn Spirit lay on the that thing on
[1:52:43] the altar we heard that the first
[1:52:45] service amen and believe God that the
[1:52:47] thing is dead just believe it whether
[1:52:49] it's still showing its ugly head just
[1:52:51] believe it and you'll never have it no
[1:52:53] more and go on and don't even pay any
[1:52:55] attention to it no more and the thing
[1:52:57] will leave you resist the devil and he
[1:52:59] will flee from you that's get away
[1:53:02] quickly that's what resist means so that
[1:53:04] would be my advice to overcome it we
[1:53:07] overcome the Devil by faith that's what
[1:53:11] we overcome all evil is by faith and
[1:53:14] Faith like I say now let me say this now
[1:53:16] Faith is a tough thing why it feels like
[1:53:18] a hypocrite
[1:53:20] oh I'm confessing I'm I'm delivered but
[1:53:22] back at the ranch I'm still messing up
[1:53:24] I'm a hypocrite I don't have faith faith
[1:53:27] says you look to the things that are
[1:53:29] unseen as though they are done you have
[1:53:32] to ignore what you are seeing what you
[1:53:35] are feeling and you still seeing some of
[1:53:36] the bad traits come out and say Lord
[1:53:38] I've prayed about this I really
[1:53:40] committed to it I'm not going to give it
[1:53:41] attention I'm moving on and ignoring yes
[1:53:44] you might have to make some things right
[1:53:45] because you lost your temper or whatever
[1:53:46] else yeah that's fine that's still
[1:53:47] Christian but all I'm saying is you
[1:53:49] ignore that thing and you don't give it
[1:53:50] attention oh but Lord please deliver me
[1:53:53] you already prayed about it why are you
[1:53:54] asking him again are you telling him how
[1:53:56] God couldn't deliver you the first time
[1:53:57] you asked of course he can he has you
[1:54:00] have to now have faith in what you asked
[1:54:02] cuz if you have a real heart that wants
[1:54:03] to get rid of stuff and deliver commit
[1:54:05] it to God and then keep moving on and
[1:54:07] never mind if you how many times you
[1:54:08] fall what does this Solomon say blessed
[1:54:11] is the man that fth seven times yet
[1:54:13] rises again and this is where you I made
[1:54:15] this mistake as a young youth every Camp
[1:54:18] I would run back to the altar and just
[1:54:20] re you know restart again no no no the
[1:54:22] Christian walks like this I'm running
[1:54:24] the race oh I trip up I F I don't I go
[1:54:27] back to the starting race I get up from
[1:54:29] where I am and I start running again
[1:54:32] that's what you need to focus on stop
[1:54:34] letting the devil say you have to get
[1:54:35] back to the altar he's already done the
[1:54:37] work you must just keep moving and it's
[1:54:39] hard because Faith makes you deny things
[1:54:41] that you like but it is I see it I
[1:54:43] messed up again today he's just saying
[1:54:45] to you God's saying just have faith in
[1:54:47] me I'm going to sort it out I know it's
[1:54:49] hard
[1:54:50] but just deny your I mean the problem of
[1:54:53] society today everything must be so
[1:54:55] factual and prove it and show me on
[1:54:57] Google you know Faith doesn't work like
[1:54:59] that you're just going to have to trust
[1:55:01] God and
[1:55:02] believe well we thankful to the Lord
[1:55:04] amen be thankful for all things so now
[1:55:07] he's talking about his nature so yeah be
[1:55:10] thankful he made you a
[1:55:12] ceric be thankful he made you sanguine
[1:55:14] be thankful he made you Melancholy cuz
[1:55:16] God needs you he needs your nature cuz
[1:55:18] look what the prophet says here I am
[1:55:20] thus because I am thus I am what I am I
[1:55:23] can't help it God made me that way and I
[1:55:26] can't do nothing but what he made me
[1:55:29] Melancholy and these kind of things that
[1:55:31] comes to the package so don't don't be
[1:55:34] sad that God Made You melan col you know
[1:55:36] I'm so depressed prone God you can just
[1:55:39] commit it to God and he can help you so
[1:55:41] don't don't despise yourself don't
[1:55:44] despise what God made you cuz he has a
[1:55:46] great purpose cuz you have lots of
[1:55:47] strengths he can use you just have to
[1:55:49] focus on that them they tell me I just
[1:55:51] have to be that way in order to to be
[1:55:53] the help that he sent me here to be look
[1:55:57] what he says I had to be Melancholy so
[1:55:59] that I can be in order to be the help
[1:56:01] that he sent me to be here the
[1:56:04] profitting knowledge is he needed to be
[1:56:06] Melancholy as much as it came with some
[1:56:08] bad stuff it also was what God wanted
[1:56:10] and I want to be that kind of person he
[1:56:12] says I want to be a Melancholy and you
[1:56:14] should want to be what you are cuz
[1:56:16] that's what God made you and and you
[1:56:17] need to trust him that he's made you
[1:56:19] that way for purpose if that's the way I
[1:56:21] was supposed to be that's what I want to
[1:56:23] be whatever is the kingdom of God's will
[1:56:26] or God's will that's what I want to be
[1:56:29] so be what you are but acknowledge your
[1:56:31] weaknesses and commit it to God and move
[1:56:33] on and let him heal those things in his
[1:56:36] time sorry it's a bit small but I
[1:56:38] believe we'll still be out of follow now
[1:56:39] let's get back to this love element
[1:56:41] remember we've dealt with what is needed
[1:56:43] to heal the sick uh and the church the
[1:56:45] sick church and to what is the biggest
[1:56:47] problem it's it's the lack of Brotherly
[1:56:48] kindness and love but look what the
[1:56:50] prophet says and I just want to reaffirm
[1:56:52] that now as we start closing off amen
[1:56:53] I'm almost done hanging there amen the
[1:56:56] Lord the world sorry is dying today for
[1:56:59] love you know that's how you can
[1:57:02] sometimes make a difference that's how
[1:57:03] you can bring people in just by the life
[1:57:04] you live not what you say we think we
[1:57:07] must say things to prove who we are your
[1:57:10] life is saying what needs to be said
[1:57:12] live a life and if God says open your
[1:57:14] mouth so be it but this is how amen look
[1:57:18] what he says here Christians today we've
[1:57:19] got so finely scholar churches wonderful
[1:57:22] buildings but we got weak pulpits
[1:57:24] there's something wrong the congregation
[1:57:26] don't feel to one another like they used
[1:57:28] to there's something missing the world
[1:57:31] is looking to that Christians and I'm
[1:57:33] saying that to the youth they're looking
[1:57:35] to you what we need today is a baptism
[1:57:37] of love for one another this will all
[1:57:41] men know that you're my disciples why
[1:57:43] when you have love one for the other and
[1:57:45] no man has greater love than he will lay
[1:57:47] down his life for his friends
[1:57:50] yeah ye him and he was the only one that
[1:57:52] could do it there was not an angel could
[1:57:54] do it there was not nothing else could
[1:57:55] do it and he did it you've got no right
[1:57:58] to listen to nothing else contrary but
[1:58:00] to him hear ye him Bible said you the
[1:58:03] salt of the earth the salt is Savor if
[1:58:06] it contacts but if it's lost his
[1:58:08] strength no matter how much it
[1:58:10] contacts that's where the church is
[1:58:12] that's a condemnation to us cuz we've
[1:58:14] allowed so many things in between us so
[1:58:17] many hard feelings that that's what's
[1:58:20] the matter they have lost their
[1:58:22] brotherly love and sisterly love they've
[1:58:25] lost the feeling for one another the
[1:58:28] world the peoples are looking for
[1:58:31] something that's
[1:58:32] real that's when they'll know you
[1:58:35] disciples when they can see the
[1:58:36] brotherly kindness and love amongst each
[1:58:38] other I mean some people have left
[1:58:40] churches in the message because of so
[1:58:42] much fractions and disputes and
[1:58:45] fightings man you know what it doesn't
[1:58:48] matter how different your brother is and
[1:58:50] how different his Doctrine is love him
[1:58:53] as a brother and just say God if he's
[1:58:55] wrong sort him out but I don't need to
[1:58:57] treat him different I don't need to say
[1:58:58] harsh things to him I just need to say I
[1:59:00] committed to God and love him
[1:59:03] irrespective why do you have to sort out
[1:59:05] God's problems listen I think his
[1:59:08] brother
[1:59:10] um uh Marcus Becka says something so
[1:59:13] good and The Pianist will know exactly
[1:59:15] what I'm saying but the Marcus Baker
[1:59:18] says it's easy to play the Pian
[1:59:20] says all you need to do is to know what
[1:59:22] chts to play at what time and at what
[1:59:26] tempo and then it's easy to play but
[1:59:29] unless you know those things it's not
[1:59:30] easy am I missing another step love I
[1:59:32] think that's right yeah he says it's to
[1:59:34] that effect so what we have we see that
[1:59:36] you know we see the scriptures you must
[1:59:37] correct your brother and whatever else
[1:59:39] and for some reason we feel the need to
[1:59:41] just always be the one that corrects you
[1:59:43] shouldn't do that sister you are a place
[1:59:46] brother but God has also said that we
[1:59:49] need need to be led of the Holy Spirit
[1:59:51] and that you need to when you see a a
[1:59:53] wrong in a brother first pray for that
[1:59:54] brother or sister because who is the
[1:59:56] ultimate shooter it's Christ himself
[1:59:58] there's far better effect if that person
[2:00:00] can hear directly from Christ let's just
[2:00:02] say it's the church service and you know
[2:00:04] the the pastor deals with stuff and then
[2:00:06] you can stay there and say wow God had
[2:00:07] deal dealt with that I didn't need to go
[2:00:09] now there's no more arguments that
[2:00:11] person knows if they're wrong God told
[2:00:13] me not my fellow brother and sisters so
[2:00:15] yes you are called to correct and help
[2:00:17] each other but it must be done in the
[2:00:18] right spirit
[2:00:19] because maybe it's not the right
[2:00:22] season maybe it's not the right time
[2:00:24] maybe it's not the right
[2:00:26] atmosphere so you need to pray God I see
[2:00:29] this do you want me to deal with it or
[2:00:30] do you want the pastor or someone else
[2:00:32] but whatever is the is is the the Avenue
[2:00:34] I must go may I just be in your leading
[2:00:38] don't be so quick to just want to sort
[2:00:40] out stuff wait on the Holy Ghost
[2:00:43] leading amen cuz we need something
[2:00:45] that's real let me do I want to I want
[2:00:48] to it wasn't on my notes I wanted to add
[2:00:49] it but it's come to my mind and I want
[2:00:50] to say it because I don't think uh I
[2:00:52] think the Lord just wants me to say this
[2:00:54] do you know the Bible says we wrestle
[2:00:55] not against principal um flesh and blood
[2:00:57] but against principalities and Powers
[2:00:59] you know that many of you know that
[2:01:00] scripture so what we need to realize
[2:01:03] when my brother offends me or my sister
[2:01:05] offends
[2:01:06] me it's not actually them we wrestle not
[2:01:09] against flesh and blood it's not my
[2:01:11] sister it's not my brother but there's a
[2:01:13] principality and
[2:01:15] power that has unfortunately maybe
[2:01:17] anointed them for that moment and a
[2:01:19] little bit of a human nature overrode
[2:01:21] the spirit of God and they said
[2:01:23] something that they shouldn't have said
[2:01:26] now let me give you a nice
[2:01:28] picture if a pedestrian is walking in
[2:01:31] the road and a car comes and hits
[2:01:35] them okay and they get they end up in
[2:01:37] hospital in intensive care whatever it
[2:01:39] is do we prosecute the car or do we
[2:01:43] prosecute the driver for the Markel
[2:01:46] know okay it's the driver
[2:01:49] but what did the actual damage to the
[2:01:51] human being was the
[2:01:53] car you get it so you see the person
[2:01:57] that hurt you but actually behind that
[2:01:59] there was something that was driving
[2:02:01] them and it's very hard to see because
[2:02:03] what hurt me was the person but there
[2:02:07] actually was a driver behind the wheel
[2:02:09] that is the perpetrator and if you can
[2:02:12] just understand that sometime yeah I'm
[2:02:13] not condoning it I'm not saying they got
[2:02:15] an excuse they should have been uh you
[2:02:17] know under the Holy Spirit but we all
[2:02:19] four and we're going to I've hurt people
[2:02:22] and you would have hurt people and I've
[2:02:23] said things I shouldn't have said and I
[2:02:25] had to make them right but you have to
[2:02:26] go back to base camp so try and always
[2:02:29] remember that when something does
[2:02:30] someone hurtful or when they're lashing
[2:02:31] out rather try look behind the flesh
[2:02:33] Veil and realize this is maybe just a
[2:02:35] hurt person that unfortunately the
[2:02:37] devil's got her Avenue in and they're
[2:02:39] lashing out to me in a way that is not
[2:02:41] fair but nonetheless let me focus on
[2:02:44] rather praying for them that the Lord
[2:02:45] will deliver them of the
[2:02:47] driver he amen so the Holy Ghost can
[2:02:50] drive
[2:02:52] them that should be the motive of every
[2:02:54] Christian and every person in the church
[2:02:56] is for the unity unify ourselves and
[2:02:58] stick together I would I mean let's
[2:03:00] let's have that goal after this Camp
[2:03:01] we're in this together let's stick
[2:03:03] together let's unify ourselves whatever
[2:03:05] the church votes for that's what we
[2:03:07] should vote for then say for instance
[2:03:09] want to change something in the church
[2:03:11] well then if that the trust is want to
[2:03:12] someone else wants to the deacons they
[2:03:14] want to change something that comes
[2:03:15] before the church the church then
[2:03:17] together if and if our idea here seems
[2:03:21] to be a little different than what the
[2:03:22] whole church said let's
[2:03:25] sacrifice that idea do you know when uh
[2:03:29] brother brandham they wanted to do the
[2:03:30] AL when he preaches the seals and they
[2:03:32] rededicate the building and they've done
[2:03:34] all the upgrades you know brother
[2:03:35] Brandon was against
[2:03:37] that he wanted to send that money to the
[2:03:39] missionary Fields CU that's where his
[2:03:41] heart was but the church voted for the
[2:03:44] upgrades to the building and he was the
[2:03:46] prophet I mean come on but he submitt
[2:03:48] committed himself to what the greater
[2:03:50] need the body wanted so it's not just
[2:03:52] about what you want not you know I wish
[2:03:54] the music was different in my church and
[2:03:56] you know that one forget about it submit
[2:03:58] yourself and even if it's wrong pray
[2:04:00] about it but submit yourself and let God
[2:04:02] do the work if it's necessary or maybe
[2:04:04] you just need to come and line yourself
[2:04:06] because that's the only way we can stand
[2:04:08] United because we have to sacrifice
[2:04:10] ideas and if this church will go on to
[2:04:12] the way you going now and be United God
[2:04:14] will it's unlimited what he'll do if
[2:04:18] we'll stick together amen it's unlimited
[2:04:20] what can be accomplished amongst us if
[2:04:21] you can just stick together we must
[2:04:23] stick together that's how we want to be
[2:04:25] uh so complete with one another and then
[2:04:28] so complete in the hands of God
[2:04:30] Amen I'm very close to being done
[2:04:32] hanging there with me though I
[2:04:33] understand all the mysteries of God see
[2:04:35] and still though I could do it and have
[2:04:38] no charity I'm nothing see I haven't got
[2:04:39] nowhere see sh see the main thing is
[2:04:42] love God and humble yourself with it now
[2:04:44] surely after all these years in the
[2:04:46] field and around the world this is
[2:04:47] Brother Bram speaking to the the church
[2:04:49] you know he's been around the world so
[2:04:50] much he's had so much experience look at
[2:04:52] it 1963 you know and and seeing
[2:04:54] different people I ought to know a
[2:04:56] little bit about the gate to enter in I
[2:04:58] ought to know a little bit of how God
[2:05:00] gets pleased with us entering where we
[2:05:01] should be and if you want to get
[2:05:03] somewhere with God never let an arrogant
[2:05:06] Spirit come amongst
[2:05:07] you you know what especi sorry to say
[2:05:10] but I was there when I was young
[2:05:11] especially the guys I don't know the
[2:05:12] sisters maybe different but man that
[2:05:14] that arrogancy is some as a real problem
[2:05:17] we think we're so good and so cool and
[2:05:20] we got it all together you need to
[2:05:21] submit that little spirit and say Lord
[2:05:23] help me not to have that
[2:05:26] Spirit anyways but that's more other
[2:05:28] things that it manifests itself all
[2:05:30] through your life don't let malice come
[2:05:31] in no matter what anybody does if they
[2:05:34] are wrong don't you never build up a
[2:05:36] complex against that person see don't
[2:05:38] build up Wars you you be sweet and kind
[2:05:41] you show that person how it's done by
[2:05:44] God's grace and you don't have to say it
[2:05:45] you just do it and you become the
[2:05:47] testimony remember God loved you when
[2:05:50] you were in sin don't forget that and if
[2:05:53] the spirit of God is in you you love the
[2:05:55] other person when he's wrong see just
[2:05:57] pray for them and love one another above
[2:06:00] everything love God and one another and
[2:06:02] be humble with God and around one
[2:06:04] another and God will bless us and it's
[2:06:07] hard telling what he will do man the sky
[2:06:10] is the
[2:06:12] limit this is my closing
[2:06:15] scripture finally be all of One mind
[2:06:17] having compassion passion one of another
[2:06:21] love as Brethren be pitiful be
[2:06:26] courteous be not rendering evil for evil
[2:06:30] or raing oh he said this I'm going to
[2:06:32] say that no no no not raing for raing

[2:06:56] go sort that out and be humble enough to
[2:06:58] sort it out and then make yourself an
[2:07:01] honorable Christian and a safe house and
[2:07:04] a safe place for someone else that has a
[2:07:06] need for you and your Natures will
[2:07:08] complement each other you have to allow
[2:07:10] for it I have to be careful even my
[2:07:12] children I have to be careful how I

[2:07:47] same by his grace so take these tools
[2:07:50] amen and use it amen and may the Lord
[2:07:53] just help us all because this has been a
[2:07:54] great help in my life amen that I've
[2:07:56] been able to watch even this Camp I've
[2:07:57] been watching some people I kind of

[2:08:01] by your natur you didn't know hey don't
[2:08:03] worry not everyone some of you have
[2:08:04] missed but nonetheless because we just
[2:08:06] have little natures and it's fine
[2:08:08] there's nothing wrong like brother BR
[2:08:10] said God made me this way and it's a
[2:08:11] blessing so channel the good stuff and
[2:08:13] be a blessing one to another amen God
[2:08:15] bless you let's just bow amen let's just
[2:08:18] bow in our heads in a word of prayer
[2:08:23] amen and maybe we have an opportunity if
[2:08:26] some of the s points of hit where you
[2:08:28] know you just need a bit of helping with
[2:08:30] the Lord and you know maybe there's some
[2:08:33] things was coming up that your nature
[2:08:35] you realize needs a touch of the
[2:08:37] Master's Hand like the prophet said
[2:08:39] don't don't just keep moving around it
[2:08:43] just commit it to God and say Lord you
[2:08:45] deliver me and help me of this and then
[2:08:47] move on and and let the Holy Spirit
[2:08:49] Undertake and let his faith your faith
[2:08:52] just sort out the
[2:08:54] situation so we're going to pray
[2:08:56] together if you want to just mention
[2:08:57] some things to the Lord that you say
[2:08:59] Lord help me with these things I realize
[2:09:01] this is a problem and uh may you forgive
[2:09:03] me where I've betrayed others trust you
[2:09:05] forgive me when I've said things I
[2:09:07] shouldn't have said and Lord may we just
[2:09:09] be able to be of such benefit to each
[2:09:11] other in brotherly love and kindness
[2:09:12] amen let's pray together dear gracious
[2:09:14] Heavenly Father Lord Lord yes we know
[2:09:16] Lord maybe this is a bit more of a
[2:09:18] practical service Lord but we know the
[2:09:20] devil gets inside of these things Lord
[2:09:21] and He causes division amongst each
[2:09:23] other little feelings rise up Lord
[2:09:25] things are said that shouldn't be said
[2:09:27] Lord and unfortunately the our words are
[2:09:30] so much power Lord and when we say
[2:09:31] things negative Lord it just it just it
[2:09:34] we know the devil just jumps on that and
[2:09:36] he just makes it so much bigger and
[2:09:38] stronger Lord but Lord how do we defeat
[2:09:40] these things we speak love we show love
[2:09:43] and then those walls of Jericho around
[2:09:44] us can come tumbling down lord lord God
[2:09:47] may you make each and every young person
[2:09:49] here a real safe house for another
[2:09:51] person Lord a friend Lord May that
[2:09:53] someone else really feel they can open
[2:09:55] up Lord and it's not going to be spoken
[2:09:57] about it will just stay there Lord may
[2:09:59] you just give us that Spirit Lord of
[2:10:01] really being a trustworthy honorable
[2:10:03] Christian Lord Lord we know Lord that
[2:10:05] there's such power laying before us Lord
[2:10:07] we as the Brethren can go and accomplish
[2:10:10] so much but Lord we need to also
[2:10:12] acknowledge where we we have our little
[2:10:14] weaknesses our little slip-ups Lord and
[2:10:16] be able to admit it and say Lord need
[2:10:18] your help and then Lord help us not to
[2:10:20] be slack anded when we do have our
[2:10:22] weaknesses that get in our way let us
[2:10:24] Lord rise up again and take the good
[2:10:26] stuff you've given us the positive
[2:10:28] things Lord and then move forward and be
[2:10:29] of benefit to one another help us to be
[2:10:32] giving Christians Lord whenever we see
[2:10:33] an opportunity just to reach out let us

[2:14:10] [Applause]
[2:14:16] all
[2:14:24] praise the
[2:14:27] Lord I I want to say something and that
[2:14:30] is that you know this is not
[2:14:33] traditionally how he heard things
[2:14:35] presented in this
[2:14:39] message and and maybe maybe some of you
[2:14:45] sit here and think m is this really
[2:14:47] message
[2:14:49] well it is absolutely it is absolutely
[2:14:52] and like her brother said in the
[2:14:54] beginning you know we we our main focus
[2:14:57] is the soul
[2:14:59] absolutely but we are in a in a three
[2:15:01] roomed house we live in a house with
[2:15:04] flesh and a spirit and a soul and yes
[2:15:07] the soul is the part that is the Eternal
[2:15:09] part and the soul is the part where the
[2:15:11] character is built and so on we
[2:15:12] understand those things that's the
[2:15:13] Eternal part but God has also given us a
[2:15:17] solution for Body Spirit and soul amen
[2:15:20] like a brother said we we happy to pray
[2:15:22] for someone who battles with cancer or
[2:15:24] some ailment in the body but why not
[2:15:27] also give some attention to to the the
[2:15:30] spirit you know it's it's like we can
[2:15:33] deny that those things exist but it
[2:15:36] still affects
[2:15:37] us so so I mean it's like it's like
[2:15:40] someone saying I don't believe in
[2:15:42] gravity right so I'm going to
[2:15:45] just not believe in gravity and step
[2:15:47] with the stage but whether I believe in
[2:15:49] it or not I'm going to Splat on the on
[2:15:51] the bottom
[2:15:53] right and that is what how many people
[2:15:55] around this message has gone for so many
[2:15:57] years is like no we're in the message
[2:15:59] those things don't affect us we don't
[2:16:01] believe no actually and even brother
[2:16:03] Bram uses some terms and things and and
[2:16:06] and you know he speaks about how yes it
[2:16:08] is actually psychology but Godly
[2:16:11] psychology and and there's always a
[2:16:13] balance for these things I understand
[2:16:15] remember the first thing is our soul
[2:16:18] absolutely but I believe we received
[2:16:21] such beautiful tools this weekend to
[2:16:24] also live happier Freer lives as
[2:16:28] Christians and also what happens many
[2:16:30] times is you know God can change that
[2:16:32] like brother tazwell showed so
[2:16:33] beautifully on on Saturday morning when
[2:16:36] that serpent nature is first in the soul
[2:16:38] and then the rebirth then that that that
[2:16:41] serpent nature gets cast out and the
[2:16:43] dove nature comes in but sometimes the
[2:16:46] dove nature can be in our soul but our
[2:16:47] Spirits are so clouded over with all our
[2:16:49] complexes and our hurts and our memories
[2:16:51] and our things that the the life that's
[2:16:54] in our soul doesn't shine out all the
[2:16:57] way and dealing with these things that's
[2:17:00] in our spirit realm I mean dealing with
[2:17:02] all these emotional things and so forth
[2:17:04] actually opens the channel so that that
[2:17:06] light of the holy spirit in our hearts
[2:17:08] can shine
[2:17:09] through thank you Michael God bless you
[2:17:12] richly I mean we just really enjoyed
[2:17:15] having you yes give him a round of
[2:17:16] applause
[2:17:23] we're not lifting our brother up but
[2:17:26] we're saying thank you to the holy
[2:17:27] spirit for using that gift and we say
[2:17:29] thank you for brother Michael to making
