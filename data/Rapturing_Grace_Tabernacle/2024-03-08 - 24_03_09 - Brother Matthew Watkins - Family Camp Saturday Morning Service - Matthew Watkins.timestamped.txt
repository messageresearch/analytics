[16:20] and our history and our ideas that the
[16:23] Lord will just speak to us to our souls
[16:25] and change
[16:27] lives amen I wonder if you would be
[16:29] seated just for a moment I don't want to
[16:31] take up a lot of
[16:32] time um but I want to say now for those
[16:37] of you joined us for the first time this
[16:38] morning welcome to to Family Camp 2024
[16:42] and and uh trust that the Lord will
[16:45] continue to bless us we've already had a
[16:47] wonderful time last night and I'm really
[16:49] thankful that the Lord has allowed us to
[16:52] see a little bit of a glimpse in the
[16:54] heart of brother Matt and uh to to uh
[16:59] allow him to make himself a little
[17:01] vulnerable and testify um of how the
[17:04] Lord had to show him to look Beyond
[17:06] himself and so forth um so really really
[17:09] blessed by that thank you very much for
[17:11] everyone's lovely attitudes and help and
[17:13] so on um and uh I want to say may the
[17:17] Lord bless each one of you but may the
[17:18] Lord also continue to bless our
[17:20] fellowship and bless our togetherness
[17:23] and may the Lord's presence be here and
[17:26] may the Lord make each one feel really
[17:29] welcome amen you know it's so easy for
[17:32] us depending on how we are wired um you
[17:36] know I know some people are wired that
[17:37] the bigger the crowd the lonelier they
[17:39] get um and some people are just like
[17:42] that um I'm very happy to be in the
[17:45] crowd but I like to sit somewhere and
[17:47] keep my mouth shut and let everyone else
[17:49] talk and listen that's just how I'm
[17:52] wired and we're all different but I know
[17:54] for some people you know coming into a
[17:55] group environment like this is a little
[17:57] bit of a challenge and I want to say may
[17:59] the Lord work beyond that complex I mean
[18:02] may the Lord make it just um safe enough
[18:04] for each one of us just to to appreciate
[18:08] the fellowship and and let the Lord be
[18:11] welcome and I want to say may may the
[18:14] Lord get through your walls and my walls

[18:57] the Lord Lord for that would love that

[19:06] it would be lovely for even if you've
[19:09] done song song items throughout the

[27:54] him just over the he was there with us
[27:56] in Buford and got a little bit of
[27:58] fellowship and then but my goodness just
[28:01] a couple days uh just felt like I've
[28:03] known him my whole life and so I just
[28:05] appreciate his spirit and uh him and his
[28:08] his family got to be with him uh in
[28:10] their home and theyve just made me feel
[28:12] so welcome and um I just want to um be a
[28:17] be a vessel amen that can be used for
[28:20] you now I don't know you I don't uh I
[28:23] don't know any of you that I that I you
[28:25] know just very except for just you know
[28:28] very little and you don't know me and
[28:30] that's a good thing sometimes I could
[28:32] just come in here un knowing of brother
[28:35] Al didn't sit me down and give me some
[28:37] kind of Intel and all the problems in
[28:39] the church and everything that's going
[28:41] on and I know you got problems uh you're
[28:44] a group of people so whenever there's a
[28:46] group of people there's problems There's
[28:47] issues there's circumstances and
[28:50] challenges um but I believe that God is
[28:53] more than enough amen his word is more
[28:55] than enough for us and so I just want to
[28:57] to uh relax this morning that'll be all
[28:59] the music thank you amen God bless you I
[29:02] want to say how much we appreciated just
[29:04] the worship we got to be in just for the
[29:06] little bit um all of the sound Texs and
[29:09] the musicians and all of those that made
[29:12] this Camp possible may God bless you
[29:14] richly and um I pray God pour out
[29:16] something special for you this morning
[29:19] and this weekend God would be uh very
[29:21] close and very real to you amen Judges
[29:24] chapter 13 if you have your Bible we
[29:26] just want to go straight to the word
[29:28] this
[29:29] morning
[29:37] amen Judges chapter
[29:44] 13 and I just want to um just obeying
[29:49] the Lord this morning and I'll uh tell
[29:52] you straight honestly and um that I
[29:55] struggled just with the the Lord on what
[29:58] direction he'd have me go for this
[29:59] weekend and you know you could you could
[30:01] go so many directions and you're pulled
[30:04] naturally you know in so many ways and I
[30:07] just uh with the Lord just uh consulted
[30:10] with the Lord so much and ask God just
[30:12] to give us a just perfect leadership and
[30:14] so I'm going a way that I probably
[30:16] wasn't expecting to go and uh in any way
[30:19] uh at all and sometimes I just have
[30:22] learned just to follow the lord and uh
[30:24] don't try to figure it out don't try to
[30:26] make sense of of it um you know why why
[30:29] I would go a certain direction but I
[30:31] believe the Lord knows amen and I I've
[30:34] I've I've watched that already on this
[30:36] trip how much he's in control and I just
[30:39] believe he has something very special
[30:40] for us amen this this weekend I just
[30:44] want to minister to you today and I
[30:46] really I don't uh have necessarily a
[30:50] theme that I would go with for this
[30:52] weekend as I thought I was going to I
[30:54] had a theme I had a theme but God had
[30:57] other plans and so it just seems the way
[31:00] the the Lord has led me uh last night
[31:02] early this morning up just praying and
[31:05] waited on the Lord and it just seems
[31:07] like I I just don't really have a a
[31:09] theme maybe where every service will
[31:11] just you know tie into the next one uh
[31:14] in that way but you know uh maybe we
[31:17] have you know different portions of a
[31:19] meal you have you know a seven course
[31:21] meal and not everything ties together
[31:23] and so we just want to begin with this
[31:25] portion this morning and I'm going to
[31:27] just try to try my best to be studious
[31:30] brother houry about the time it's 10:39
[31:33] now so 10:40 and I'll try to be done um
[31:36] as soon as
[31:38] possible when the Lord is done we'll be
[31:41] done amen I'm going to minister you
[31:43] today and I'm just going to uh title
[31:46] this the cost of a
[31:50] choice the cost of a
[31:53] choice verse two of Judges chapter 13
[31:57] 13 and there was a certain man of Zora
[32:01] of the family of the danites whose name
[32:03] was monoa and his wife was Barren and
[32:07] bore not and the angel of the Lord
[32:10] appeared unto the woman and said unto
[32:11] her behold now Thou Art Barren and
[32:15] bearest not but Thou shalt conceive and
[32:18] bear a son now therefore beware I pray
[32:21] thee and drink not wine nor strong drink
[32:25] and eat not any unclean thing for Lo
[32:29] Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and
[32:32] no razor shall come on his head for the
[32:35] child shall be a Nazarite unto God
[32:38] notice from the
[32:42] womb so not at the moment that he
[32:44] recognizes the call of God in his life
[32:48] not at the moment he comes to you know
[32:50] per se an alter as we would say and you
[32:53] know and surrenders and submits his life
[32:56] but actually the call that God was going
[32:58] to place upon him was going to be before
[33:01] he even was born that's right and it
[33:05] says from the womb he shall begin to
[33:07] deliver Israel out of the hand of the
[33:09] Philistines then the woman came and told
[33:11] her husband and said a man of God came
[33:13] unto me and his countenance was like the
[33:15] countenance of an angel of God very
[33:17] terrible that word means awesome but I
[33:20] asked him not whence he was neither told
[33:22] me his name but he said unto me behold
[33:25] and she repeats these words here
[33:27] cons that behold Thou shalt conceive and
[33:30] bear a son and now drink no wine nor
[33:33] strong drink neither eat any unclean
[33:36] thing for the child shall be a Nazarite
[33:39] to God from the
[33:41] womb to the day of his death I want you
[33:44] to notice this here this morning how far
[33:48] the plan of God over a life
[33:51] spans it goes from before you're born
[33:55] until you breathe your last breath
[33:57] breath and so God was saying knowing the
[34:00] end from the beginning Samson's going to
[34:02] go a lot of places God didn't tell him
[34:04] to go Samson's life is going to be
[34:06] something that God never intended for it
[34:09] to
[34:09] be but yet the promise or the call that
[34:14] God put on his life never left
[34:19] him let's read a little bit further here
[34:21] then Theo entreated and said oh Lord oh
[34:24] my Lord let the man of God which thou
[34:26] did s come again un us and teach us what
[34:29] we shall do unto the child that shall be
[34:33] born God hearkened to the voice of
[34:36] manoah and the angel of God came again
[34:38] unto the woman and she sat in the field
[34:40] but manoah manoah her husband was not
[34:44] with her and the woman made haste and
[34:46] ran and showed her husband and said unto
[34:48] him behold the manath appeared unto me
[34:50] that came unto me the other day manoah
[34:53] Rose and went after his wife and came to
[34:55] the man and said unto him thou the man
[34:57] that speaketh unto the woman and he said
[35:00] I am and manoah said now let thy words
[35:04] come to pass how shall we order the
[35:07] child and how shall we do unto him the
[35:10] angel of the Lord said unto manoah of
[35:13] all that I said unto the woman let her
[35:15] beware so he repeats this commission
[35:18] again unto her and in verse 15 and
[35:21] manoah said unto the angel of the Lord I
[35:23] pray thee let us detain thee until we
[35:25] shall have made ready kid for thee Lord
[35:27] Jesus father we just now Lord bow in
[35:31] your presence God I'm in great need of
[35:35] you this morning Lord father I stand
[35:38] Here Lord as just an empty vessel Lord
[35:41] waiting to be filled I pray God that
[35:44] each one would have that testimony this
[35:46] morning Lord we empty out our self now
[35:50] we raise up our hand Lord as just a sign
[35:52] of surrender this morning and Lord we
[35:55] just want to say empty up us father oh
[35:58] the spirit of God ever waiteth an empty
[36:01] vessel Lord and I believe Lord that you
[36:04] can fill us Lord father with all of your
[36:08] self this morning from our head to our
[36:10] toes I pray God that you would instruct
[36:13] us now Lord I pray may your spirit is
[36:16] the word says it's a teacher it's a
[36:18] tutor Lord may it come and teach Lord
[36:21] father as we sit at your feet Lord we
[36:24] desire to listen we pray that you would
[36:26] speak Now Grant it Lord to each person
[36:28] this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's
[36:30] name amen amen you can be seated this
[36:40] morning life is such an
[36:43] amazing uh as such an amazing thing that
[36:47] you know the aspects of life that uh so
[36:50] intricate in and in so many phases you
[36:53] know all the way from the time that
[36:55] you're born and you you you're raised in
[36:57] a home and and you're you're LED brother
[37:00] Brandon would take it in leadership and
[37:02] would say that you're LED you know in
[37:04] one day you're led by your mother and
[37:06] then you change from that dispensation
[37:08] to your father and then you change maybe
[37:10] to your employer and and and and your
[37:13] boss and maybe someone that's over you
[37:15] and then he he asked the question but
[37:17] who's leading you now and I think it's
[37:19] an amazing thing that life is tight that
[37:22] way it's very much uh even biblically we
[37:26] we understand Life as a
[37:29] journey we can see this through Abraham
[37:31] as Abraham journeyed and he left his
[37:34] father and and he left everything that
[37:36] he ever knew left a land and a home and
[37:39] houses and and and he and the Bible said
[37:42] he he left it all he sojourned he was
[37:44] seeking he was looking he was journeying
[37:48] and his journey starts there in the you
[37:50] know when when he leaves everything that
[37:52] he ever known and then God continues to
[37:55] move in his life and and then he asks
[37:57] him to leave and separate himself from
[37:59] his father and Abraham passes that test
[38:02] and he and he comes to many different
[38:04] Crossroads in his life and many
[38:06] different intersections or Junctions
[38:09] that he goes through and and and and he
[38:12] comes to the place in his life where now
[38:14] he's he's he's he's came up to this
[38:16] point and God tells him to separate
[38:18] himself now again from his brother lot
[38:21] and I think it's so incredible because
[38:23] as you study this man Abraham's life
[38:25] what you'll find is it's you can relate
[38:28] so much uh to it in your own journey in
[38:31] your own life that life is all about a
[38:34] journey that we're on our way to
[38:36] somewhere that we're on a line that
[38:38] we're on a path that we're not just
[38:40] going around in circles but God has a
[38:43] purpose for our life God has a plan he
[38:46] has a direction and in fact over every
[38:48] life God anoints that life with a
[38:51] certain specific purpose and an
[38:53] anointing is is we could say is not you
[38:56] know it's the word sha if you ever look
[38:59] up that word anointing it's so amazing
[39:01] how different it is from what we get
[39:03] when we think of the word anointing and
[39:06] we think of an anointing as some filling
[39:08] or some you know some kind of thing that
[39:10] we fill over our flesh and it can be
[39:12] that the anointing of God you can say I
[39:14] feel his anointing I could say that as a
[39:16] minister preaching the gospel Jesus
[39:19] would say the anointing of the Lord the
[39:21] spirit of God is upon me and so but you
[39:24] notice that that word sha and anointing
[39:27] actually it just simply means to smear
[39:30] or to rub with oil in other words what
[39:34] it saying is is that the anointing is
[39:36] the
[39:37] transfer it's the
[39:40] transaction it's it's God taking
[39:43] something that he has a burden you could
[39:46] say and God would make a transaction he
[39:49] would transfer that burden onto a vessel
[39:53] and then when that anointing would come
[39:55] upon that vessel that would be the
[39:57] purpose that God had called that vessel
[39:59] to for the purpose he was born into the
[40:02] Earth listen friends I just want to say
[40:04] this you're not
[40:07] random you're not just randomly here
[40:10] this morning in fact I'll go further it
[40:13] wasn't an accident that you were not
[40:15] born in the days of Jesus it's not an
[40:19] accident that you weren't born in the
[40:21] days of Martin Luther or John Wesley but
[40:24] you were not born in the days when
[40:26] brother Brandon was here there there was
[40:28] a generation that served that purpose
[40:31] there was a generation that was anointed
[40:33] for that dispensation but let me just
[40:35] say God has not left us without an
[40:39] anointing but we're here for a purpose
[40:42] you were born at the right time at the
[40:44] right season at the right moment in the
[40:47] right condition you may not feel like it
[40:50] you may feel like you're Lord why was I
[40:52] brought into such a a broken world and
[40:54] it's so messed up and there's just a
[40:56] curse upon it and it seems like the
[40:58] World As We Live is getting darker but
[41:00] let me just say friends God has given
[41:02] you the provision of everything you will
[41:05] face in your life in this generation God
[41:08] has already provided what you
[41:12] need and so God would anoint a life he
[41:15] would he would take a man like Jeremiah
[41:17] and God would have a burden upon his
[41:19] heart and and and God wanted to transfer
[41:22] that burden so Jeremiah would would
[41:25] receive the burden as he would say that
[41:27] it was like fire shut up in my bones and
[41:31] what was he referring to that God had
[41:33] passed down his purpose he had he had
[41:37] transferred a vision something that he
[41:40] had for Jeremiah's life and God would
[41:43] take that man and even as Samuel anoints
[41:46] David and and the Bible says it this way
[41:49] that that the the the you know in Psalms
[41:52] it says that oh how beautiful is
[41:54] fellowship for Brethren to to dwell in
[41:57] Fellowship it's like the oil that flowed
[41:59] from Aaron's head down to his beard and
[42:03] and down to His Garment even the urum
[42:05] and thumb and then flowed down all the
[42:07] way down to his feet and what was he
[42:09] doing he was he was drenching he was he
[42:13] was saturating from his head to his toes
[42:16] he was saying this is going to be a
[42:18] consecrated vessel not just a a feeling
[42:21] that you get on the flesh not just an
[42:23] emotion or or just an outward you know
[42:26] of phenomenon but God was saying I'm
[42:28] literally going to
[42:30] baptize this
[42:33] vessel and this vessel will receive a
[42:36] baptism of my anointing and and this is
[42:39] exactly what the angel was saying to
[42:43] manoah about Samson that I'm going to
[42:46] before he was ever born before he ever
[42:49] does anything in his life before he ever
[42:52] makes the First Choice before he ever
[42:54] comes to the first cross Ro of the first
[42:57] decision I just want to let you know
[42:59] I've placed a call upon his life and the
[43:03] call upon his life oh friends when God
[43:07] anoints a vessel it's a very powerful
[43:09] thing it has nothing to do with the
[43:12] mother nothing to do with the father
[43:14] nothing to the m parents were saying
[43:16] what do we do how do we raise him and
[43:18] and what kind of choices do we make and
[43:20] God was saying I want you to understand
[43:22] that I've placed this vision and this
[43:24] burden and it's a powerful thing when I
[43:27] call a man to a
[43:30] job you see life is very much this way
[43:33] it's it's a it's an array of choices I I
[43:36] realize this now you know and I'm not
[43:39] old I just want to go Ahad and say that
[43:42] now I turned 40 back in January and I'm
[43:46] not old and I have kids I have I have
[43:49] four as I told you last night and
[43:51] they're streaming I think today and I I
[43:54] told my you know I said it last night
[43:56] and I you know I I I I I I realize now I
[44:00] may have grandchildren I'm looking at my
[44:02] son who's 20 and he's you know and and
[44:04] I'm just thinking no not possible don't
[44:07] even think about it I'm too young I'm
[44:10] too young called my dad I'm so sorry I
[44:13] made you a grandpa so
[44:20] young but life is life is that way it's
[44:24] it it it it comes I look now
[44:26] back and Survey even from just my little
[44:28] short 40 years and I and I look back and
[44:32] I realize that where I'm at today and
[44:35] the station of the the the the the where
[44:38] I'm at in my life no matter if it's a if
[44:40] that's a good thing or a bad thing
[44:42] because it's a mixture of
[44:44] both and there's many things I could go
[44:46] back and I would say today I I would go
[44:49] back and I would change this and I would
[44:50] change that and and oh I wish I could
[44:53] just make a decision differently and
[44:54] I'll be honest with you today friends if
[44:56] you're not careful the devil will just
[44:58] put you in a spot to where you just live
[45:00] a life of regret and you regret what's
[45:03] your decision was and you wish you would
[45:05] have made a a difference and and oh if I
[45:07] could have just changed that if I could
[45:09] have just raised them differently if I
[45:11] would have just been present at that
[45:13] moment and you know sometimes one of the
[45:15] most painful things that you could do is
[45:17] go back and pull up a photo album how
[45:20] many here raise your hand if you got
[45:22] children that are you know teenagers or
[45:24] or older than teenagers you know one of
[45:26] the most painful things you can do is to
[45:30] go back in an album and look at your
[45:32] little children and when they were small
[45:34] and two and three and four and five and
[45:37] six and and you just ask
[45:39] yourself what happened where did you go
[45:43] how how so quickly life changed so
[45:46] fast and and you can get such a an
[45:49] overwhelming feeling uh of of of of pain
[45:53] just to say that and you know that just
[45:55] the devil will begin to do that to you
[45:57] by looking back and looking to yesterday
[45:59] and oh if I could just go back to that
[46:02] time and I and I'll never forget the
[46:04] moment that I I did that I was
[46:06] ministering somewhere and I I was just
[46:09] uh on my laptop just trying to pull up
[46:12] some notes and I seen a little folder in
[46:14] my in my uh in my on my desktop and it
[46:17] was called precious pics I know it did
[46:20] what what it was big mistake I should
[46:21] have never opened that
[46:24] folder and I open that folder and here's
[46:27] pictures that I'd forgotten I'd put of
[46:29] my children when they were at the zoo
[46:31] and they were two and they were three
[46:33] and four and and and and my
[46:36] goodness I just couldn't believe and and
[46:38] I started looking at these photos and
[46:41] thinking where did time
[46:43] go what's happened how and I I just
[46:47] begin to be overwhelmed by such a
[46:49] feeling of regret of where was I and
[46:52] what was I doing at that moment what was
[46:55] what was I just asked the question to
[46:58] today even even now I I I I just feel
[47:01] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and I
[47:04] asked myself as I look the those
[47:06] pictures and I just remember saying out
[47:09] loud what were what were you doing in
[47:12] those moments what was so
[47:17] important that you seem like it if if
[47:20] you didn't accomplish it if you didn't
[47:22] if you didn't do this or that and now
[47:25] now look now now how important really
[47:27] was
[47:28] it how important really was it those
[47:31] things that you were chasing those
[47:33] things that you were doing the things
[47:35] that you were giving your time to things
[47:37] that you were spending your time CU you
[47:39] spend it like
[47:41] money and you don't get it
[47:46] back and I just thought to myself and I
[47:48] thought what was so important in your
[47:50] life at that moment and now look now
[47:53] like sand through your hands it's gone
[47:56] you never go back you can't rewind it
[48:00] you can't replay
[48:03] it and the Holy Spirit just began to
[48:05] deal with me so much and I just thought
[48:08] to myself life is you know in it I just
[48:12] say like the Apostle Paul if in this
[48:15] life only I had hope I would be of all
[48:19] men most
[48:22] miserable thank God there's a land
[48:25] beyond the
[48:27] river and there is no
[48:30] time and I just begin to think of that
[48:33] that you know what was so important what
[48:35] was so valuable I challenge you here
[48:37] today friends consider your choices
[48:41] think about your life here for a moment
[48:43] the cost of a decision the cost of a
[48:45] choice the choices that we're making as
[48:48] I look back and Survey that of my
[48:50] children and think what was what was so
[48:53] important in in in my life at that
[48:55] moment and now the time is just flown by
[48:57] and now your children are older and now
[49:00] you can never go back and and I it just
[49:02] calls me as David would would say these
[49:05] words and I think they're so profound he
[49:07] said Lord teach me to number my
[49:12] days teach me to number my days that I
[49:16] may apply my heart unto
[49:20] wisdom teach me Lord to take every
[49:24] moment every moment and here we are at
[49:26] Family Camp 2024 and I just ask you just
[49:29] for a moment to look around look around
[49:31] to those people that you love and those
[49:33] children that you love and your wife and
[49:35] your husband and your your mother and
[49:37] your father and your grandfather and
[49:39] your grandmother just than for a moment
[49:41] what is really
[49:43] valuable what is really what really
[49:48] lasts because if you're not careful
[49:50] you'll blow right through life and
[49:52] you'll just spend all your time and
[49:54] chasing the wrong wrong
[49:56] things going after the wrong things and
[49:59] the devil will get you on a rat race in
[50:00] a circle and you're just repeating the
[50:03] same thing every single day the same
[50:04] patterns every single day and it gets
[50:07] you into such a cycle and you miss you
[50:10] miss the flowers that are
[50:13] growing and petals that are
[50:17] falling and you could live such a life
[50:20] to where you're so overwhelmed with such
[50:23] regret of how I would have done it
[50:24] different oh if I could just go back and
[50:27] I had a brother and I and he was at our
[50:29] at our church and he was just he had
[50:31] reminiscing over the time that I had
[50:33] expressed that and now he had faced the
[50:35] same thing with his children and he said
[50:37] I'm looking at a picture of my son and
[50:39] he's got a bass he's just called and
[50:41] he's just 7 years old and and he said
[50:44] and I just look back now and think oh I
[50:46] wish I could just go back to that
[50:48] moment I wish I could just go back to
[50:50] that moment and really live really live
[50:53] that moment
[50:56] and he said I just you know I'm so
[50:58] overwhelmed by the regret of yesterday
[51:02] I'm so overwhelmed it's almost
[51:04] suffocating me it's I'm so overwhelmed
[51:07] by the regret of what I've done with my
[51:09] life in the past and and the Lord just
[51:12] quickened something to me so powerful
[51:13] and actually to that brother and I just
[51:16] wrote these words and I just said the
[51:18] greatest weapon that you have to fight
[51:21] the pain of yesterday do you want to
[51:24] know what the greatest weapon God has
[51:26] giving you to fight the regret of
[51:30] yesterday
[51:32] today today is the day today is God's
[51:37] day this morning his Mercy was
[51:40] new you have another chance the greatest
[51:44] power to fight yesterday is today what
[51:47] will you do today forget about what you
[51:50] didn't do yesterday and make the right
[51:52] choice today amen
[51:59] life is like that an array of choices
[52:01] small large little ones large ones
[52:04] things that we pray over and we stress
[52:06] over and and choice is such an important
[52:09] aspect of our life every decision we
[52:13] make actually large and small
[52:16] ultimately holds a
[52:18] consequence of where we're at today
[52:21] where we'll be at tomorrow choices big
[52:24] ones little ones I'll go further and I'm
[52:27] just going to say that a lot of things I
[52:29] say this weekend will apply to every
[52:31] generation I'll say things that will
[52:32] apply to you that are teenagers you that
[52:35] are older you that are older than that I
[52:37] won't call out
[52:42] ages but the choices that we make every
[52:45] little decision ultimately has some
[52:49] impact or some consequence some decision
[52:52] in our life that we make
[52:55] and and and and the things that we do
[52:58] the places that we go the things we
[53:01] listen to the music that we listen to
[53:04] the things that we choose to allow to
[53:06] come into our
[53:07] gates the schools the the friends let me
[53:10] say this you choose the friends that you
[53:12] have no one makes you have them as
[53:15] friends the people that we surround
[53:17] oursel with the choice that we have to
[53:20] go to a church the choice of what job
[53:22] where we'll be employed the vocation we
[53:25] have in life and all of these choices no
[53:28] matter how big or how small ultimately
[53:32] has some type of consequence that it
[53:35] bears with
[53:36] it and you know that brother brandham
[53:39] would say that God made it this way God
[53:42] actually predestinated us before the
[53:45] foundation of the world and called us
[53:47] chose us but yet he leaves us with the
[53:51] ability to make a choice you see
[53:54] overcome the prophet of God would say
[53:57] God could not push us through a pipe and
[54:00] then pull us out on the on the other end
[54:02] and say blessed is he that overcometh
[54:05] what did you have to overcome you didn't
[54:08] make any choice but brother bam says but
[54:10] God left us with the ability to make a
[54:13] choice are you with me this morning to
[54:17] make a decision to make a a a you know a
[54:21] a a to make a to make the right choice
[54:24] to make the right
[54:25] decision and in the larger Grand picture
[54:28] you could almost portray it as a graph
[54:31] and you could almost almost like if
[54:33] you've ever studied ballistics and if
[54:36] you ever look at the ballistics of a
[54:37] bullet you have the Velocity you have
[54:40] the energy at the muzzle and then they
[54:43] show the graph of where it will be in a
[54:46] 100 yards 100 meters and then you would
[54:49] the bullet would have dropped this much
[54:50] and the energy would be this much and
[54:52] then at 200 yards it would be this much
[54:54] and life is very much that way that
[54:57] overall the decisions and the choices
[55:00] that we make on a daily basis hold a
[55:04] trajectory of our life of what way which
[55:08] direction we're going whether up or
[55:10] down and Samson's life we can see moves
[55:14] from choices and after you move further
[55:18] you move into Beyond choices and you
[55:21] notice a
[55:24] pattern and there's a certain pattern of
[55:28] his
[55:31] choices and there's like an e or or we
[55:34] would say a flow and you could look at
[55:37] your life now and understand where
[55:39] you're at and where you're going to be
[55:41] and what you realize is that at the end
[55:43] of your life when you finish your race
[55:47] and you come to the end of your journey
[55:49] your life is at a spot and it's only the
[55:52] result of the choices that you've made
[55:56] in
[55:57] life even serving the lord is very much
[56:00] that
[56:01] way Samson learns this very early as we
[56:04] said God anoints his life and we know
[56:07] that Samson was not filled with the Holy
[56:09] Spirit as we're filled you'll read that
[56:11] in the Bible and especially as a young
[56:13] person you can get confused even when
[56:15] you read things as John the Baptist was
[56:17] full of the Holy Ghost from the womb and
[56:19] you can read how Samson was full of the
[56:21] Holy go was you know that had the Holy
[56:23] Spirit upon his life but we know that
[56:26] there was something very different uh uh
[56:28] by the feeling that Samson had and the
[56:31] feeling that the New Covenant
[56:34] brings even the word that is used in the
[56:37] Bible for Breath of God is actually the
[56:39] word ruach and it's the what we would
[56:43] refer to as the spirit of God can I take
[56:45] just a moment to lay this in here it's
[56:48] 1104 I'm watching
[56:51] closely we know that if you were living
[56:53] in the Old Testament you wouldn't have
[56:55] asked the question you know what is the
[56:57] holy spirit because the Holy Ghost was
[56:59] the ruach it was it was the the the
[57:02] invisible power of God it was the same
[57:06] word for breath or for uh wind or for
[57:09] moving air the spirit of God moved upon
[57:12] the face of the waters that was what we
[57:14] call the spirit the ruach the breath
[57:17] Genesis 81 refers to this wind that God
[57:20] sends over almost 400 times in the Old
[57:23] Testament this word is used the spirit
[57:26] of God the spirit of Life the spirit of
[57:29] of uh of creation uh Moses speaks of it
[57:33] in numbers 27 and and he says that God
[57:36] gives the breath or the ruach to all
[57:39] living creatures job understands it and
[57:42] says as long as I have life within me
[57:44] the Breath of God in my nostrils eliu
[57:47] tells job the spirit of God the breath
[57:50] the ruach of the almighty gives me life
[57:54] God used the phrase Yu rawe when when he
[57:57] when he tells uh the promise that the
[57:59] Messiah would be uh empowered or endued
[58:02] the spirit of the Lord the Bible says
[58:03] that this way will rest upon
[58:06] him the spirit of wisdom the spirit of
[58:10] understanding the spirit of counsel the
[58:12] spirit of Might the spirit of power the
[58:14] spirit of knowledge and the fear of the
[58:16] Lord that's Isaiah 21 and he refers to
[58:19] this is what was the breath or the
[58:21] lifegiving source that out of God out of
[58:24] that l Goos was the life or the breath
[58:27] and he would give it to all living
[58:28] creatures and so when when Samson's
[58:31] filled with the spirit what was it it
[58:33] was the enabling ruach or the Breath of
[58:37] God that God would Breathe Into the life
[58:39] of Samson the prophet of God would say
[58:41] it this way uh when the spirit of God
[58:43] was upon Samson Samson could take
[58:46] 2,000lb Gates and carry them 30 miles
[58:50] and he says but when you remove the
[58:52] spirit of God from Samson he was like
[58:55] any other
[58:57] man he says that as says that about
[58:59] Israel they were just a he says when you
[59:01] remove the shout of the king from the
[59:03] camp Israel was just like any other
[59:06] nation and so what was it it was the
[59:09] enabling power that the God would
[59:11] Breathe upon the people and it would
[59:14] enable them to do things that they
[59:16] otherwise could not have done it would
[59:19] also enable them to be what they could
[59:22] otherwise not have ever been it would
[59:25] allow a prophet to say what he otherwise
[59:27] wouldn't have said but the the spirit of
[59:31] God let me just say this friends the
[59:33] spirit of God makes all the
[59:37] difference I said the spirit of God
[59:39] makes all the
[59:41] difference and so you say what do you
[59:43] say brother matter I'm saying if we
[59:44] remove
[59:47] that what do we
[59:50] have Samson was just like any other man
[59:53] when you remove the spirit of God from
[59:55] him and so so this was this was the
[59:58] promise that the Old Testament left us
[1:00:01] with two simple promises that there
[1:00:05] would come a man a man that was so full
[1:00:10] of the spirit he was so anointed that he
[1:00:14] would have all of these abilities all of
[1:00:17] the gifts all of the fruit of the spirit
[1:00:20] in one human
[1:00:22] life the Bible would say it this way he
[1:00:25] would have the spirit the ruach the
[1:00:27] breath without
[1:00:30] measure and so there would be no
[1:00:32] limitations as Samson was only given a
[1:00:35] portion of it but it also left us not
[1:00:38] with just Jesus who the spirit of God
[1:00:40] would rest upon but that after that that
[1:00:43] same ruach or Spirit of the Lord would
[1:00:46] be poured out on God's family so that
[1:00:49] from one man who had everything the
[1:00:52] spirit of God would come and a many
[1:00:54] membered body would be made up of that
[1:00:57] great eternal
[1:00:59] spirit and so notice this as Samson is
[1:01:03] is as we said he's filled with this
[1:01:05] enabling Force this is how what you know
[1:01:08] he how he accomplished I want to skip
[1:01:10] some of this just to save time this
[1:01:11] morning and get to something before we
[1:01:13] close but he was Samson's anointed from
[1:01:17] birth from the very moment he's born
[1:01:20] it's a very special anointing upon his
[1:01:24] life life God says he shall begin to
[1:01:27] deliver in fact if you ever look up the
[1:01:29] word judges and if you ever study the
[1:01:31] Book of Judges from the Hebrew Bible if
[1:01:34] you ever study it all and not saying you
[1:01:36] need to but if you ever just look at the
[1:01:38] Hebrew Bible even if you just pull open
[1:01:40] a tanak and you take the Book of Judges
[1:01:43] as actually not the word judge but
[1:01:45] actually saviors is actually the English
[1:01:47] word because these men were saviors not
[1:01:51] savior in the sense of our savior who
[1:01:52] saved us from our sins but but they were
[1:01:55] saviors they would begin to save the
[1:01:58] people and so Samson was at the calling
[1:02:01] upon his life was a a Deliverance
[1:02:04] anointing a saving anointing to begin to
[1:02:08] deliver the people from their oppressors
[1:02:11] and so we know that Samson's life the
[1:02:13] Bible says that they were living under
[1:02:15] oppression and even the barrenness of
[1:02:17] manoah's wife was just a signifying the
[1:02:21] barness of of Israel and it was a result
[1:02:24] of their backsliding and and so they
[1:02:26] begin to cry out to God and God hears
[1:02:29] the cries and and and so he he he begins
[1:02:32] to deliver them and he uses as the Bible
[1:02:34] says judges or
[1:02:37] saviors and so it was something I want
[1:02:39] to say this that he was born
[1:02:42] with brother benam in in in in and I'm
[1:02:46] trying to remember the name of the
[1:02:47] message but he's speaking what uh um uh
[1:02:50] about mo why Christ speak and he's
[1:02:52] speaking about Moses
[1:02:54] and he was showing how that Moses had
[1:02:57] all of his
[1:02:59] intellectuals and he said all of his he
[1:03:01] says he says he knew God from his
[1:03:05] intellectuals and he says oh but what a
[1:03:07] difference it was when he meets the
[1:03:10] burning bush and the anointing comes
[1:03:13] upon his
[1:03:14] intellectuals and now it's not just a
[1:03:17] God that he heard about but it's a God
[1:03:19] that spoke and spoke he spoke and it
[1:03:21] spoke back to him and brother bam says
[1:03:24] that he says I think any man or woman
[1:03:26] boy or girl to have the gospel or the
[1:03:29] knowledge of the word on his
[1:03:30] intellectuals is a good thing but it's
[1:03:32] got to go further than that it's got to
[1:03:34] move from the
[1:03:36] intellect and he's got to be anointed or
[1:03:40] consecrated in his heart and brother
[1:03:43] bham says oh he says notice Moses I love
[1:03:47] this was born with the
[1:03:51] equipment born into him yeah notice that
[1:03:57] he was born with the
[1:04:00] equipment another words he says every
[1:04:03] son or daughter of God is born with the
[1:04:06] equipment in other words God has already
[1:04:09] got a job for you and before he ever
[1:04:11] gave you that job he already equipped
[1:04:14] you you might not feel equipped mom but
[1:04:17] God's already equipped you if he gave
[1:04:19] you a child then he gave you the
[1:04:21] equipment needed to make that child who
[1:04:24] we ought to
[1:04:25] be and brother vam says he equips you
[1:04:28] for the job long before you ever started
[1:04:30] your course God already charted your
[1:04:33] journey do you realize that my brother
[1:04:35] my sister before you ever came into the
[1:04:37] world God already wrote a blueprint for
[1:04:40] your life and in that blueprint is
[1:04:43] everything that you will ever need the
[1:04:45] prophet of God would say it this way in
[1:04:46] this life's journey everything you have
[1:04:49] need of is already in the seed of God
[1:04:52] that was placed in you before you ever
[1:04:55] were
[1:04:57] born he was born with the
[1:05:01] equipment his journey is charted he's
[1:05:04] already charted the course for Samson
[1:05:07] from his birth unto his
[1:05:13] death now that doesn't mean that Samson
[1:05:15] will ever surrender to
[1:05:17] that remember we're preaching to you on
[1:05:20] the cost of a
[1:05:22] choice although God had blueprinted he
[1:05:25] had charted from the end from the
[1:05:28] beginning everything Samson would ever
[1:05:31] go through every challenge he ever had
[1:05:33] everything he would ever face every
[1:05:37] every decision he would ever make every
[1:05:39] trial he would ever go through every bit
[1:05:42] everything God had already predestinated
[1:05:44] it God had already ordained it God had
[1:05:47] already seen it God had already watched
[1:05:49] over do you realize friends that's how
[1:05:51] God treats your life God has never I
[1:05:53] want you to to get this through to you
[1:05:55] God is never worried about what worries
[1:06:01] you God is never stressed over what's
[1:06:04] stressing you
[1:06:06] today God is never in anxiety he never
[1:06:09] has a panic attack he's never up there
[1:06:12] wondering going oh no what did they do
[1:06:13] what am I going to do now and now I've
[1:06:16] got to go to plan B Plan B then work go
[1:06:18] to plan C God doesn't run things that
[1:06:21] way but before you're ever born he
[1:06:23] already made a provision for everything
[1:06:26] you would ever go through in your life
[1:06:28] the lows the highs the ins the outs God
[1:06:31] already made a way for
[1:06:33] it if you'd ever get a revelation from
[1:06:36] that you'd live your life a lot
[1:06:39] different and sort of like you know the
[1:06:41] the man who's you ever watched a a man
[1:06:43] who's watching a you know a I remember
[1:06:45] never forget walked into a restaurant
[1:06:47] and I was preaching and and and I walked
[1:06:49] to get me some take my me and my wife
[1:06:51] some takeout food and it was so amazing
[1:06:54] because when I walked in there I
[1:06:55] realized you know that that the that the
[1:06:57] restaurant was just completely silent I
[1:06:59] couldn't believe it I didn't know what
[1:07:01] was going on I noticed everybody was
[1:07:03] watching the TV screens of some football
[1:07:05] game not football like you guys play
[1:07:07] football but like football that kind of
[1:07:10] football and they were watching some
[1:07:12] kind of football game and and it was
[1:07:15] just like they were they were mesmerized
[1:07:17] I mean I couldn't believe it I walked in
[1:07:19] there to walk up and it's dead silent a
[1:07:21] restaurant that's normally loud in
[1:07:22] commotion and everybody's just Frozen on
[1:07:24] the screen and they're watching
[1:07:26] Tennessee play some college game and it
[1:07:29] was some big game and big moment and
[1:07:32] then you could just feel the tension you
[1:07:34] know you can sense tension in an
[1:07:36] atmosphere you really can you know when
[1:07:39] you walked in on something you're like
[1:07:41] oh boy what did I just walk into you
[1:07:45] could feel that tension and I could feel
[1:07:47] it the second I walked in there I
[1:07:48] thought my goodness and you could tell
[1:07:50] the score was tied and there was like 13
[1:07:53] seconds left
[1:07:54] and they were about to kick a field goal
[1:07:56] and and everybody was just frozen and it
[1:07:58] was so amazing and I just watching that
[1:08:01] and I watched this there was so much
[1:08:02] stress and they have all their shirts on
[1:08:04] and here they have their team you know
[1:08:06] and they're wearing their shirt they're
[1:08:08] Insignia and their team is is kicking
[1:08:10] the winning
[1:08:12] goal and there's several of them that go
[1:08:14] I can't even watch I can't even watch
[1:08:16] and they just walk out of the
[1:08:18] room and they just walk out they
[1:08:20] literally leave the restaurant don't
[1:08:22] even tell me I don't even want to know
[1:08:23] just want to walk out they couldn't
[1:08:25] watch that moment I thought my goodness
[1:08:27] could you imagine here's the big moment
[1:08:29] here's the moment you've been waiting
[1:08:30] for your team's about to kick the
[1:08:32] winning field goal and you're so worried
[1:08:34] and so stressed and so
[1:08:38] bothered I know none of y'all are like
[1:08:40] you New Zealand people no I don't do
[1:08:44] that and they're so worried and so
[1:08:46] stressed I couldn't believe it I mean it
[1:08:48] was such worry you could just feel the
[1:08:50] Panic they were waiting just don't don't
[1:08:53] want to know what's going to happen they
[1:08:54] almost don't want I'm thinking here's
[1:08:56] your team is on the winning goal line
[1:08:58] they're about to win the game and you're
[1:09:01] so troubled you know where fear comes
[1:09:06] from I'm going to tell you fear is only
[1:09:10] based on the
[1:09:12] unknown cuz you don't know what's going
[1:09:15] to
[1:09:16] happen and when you don't know what's
[1:09:18] going to happen listen friends until you
[1:09:20] get a
[1:09:21] revelation of your life as already
[1:09:24] called by God anointed by God chosen by
[1:09:27] God you're already glorified your your
[1:09:29] life your entire Journey has already
[1:09:31] been seen by God unless you get that
[1:09:34] Revelation you'll live every day saying
[1:09:36] I don't know if I'm saved I don't know
[1:09:38] if I'm born again I don't know what's
[1:09:39] going to happen and the devil will get
[1:09:41] you and just like those people couldn't
[1:09:43] watch that moment they couldn't be there
[1:09:44] was so stressful what's going to
[1:09:47] happen you know what's so powerful
[1:09:50] though you ever watch a man who's
[1:09:52] watching the game as a replay
[1:09:58] yeah that same man who was so stressed
[1:10:01] out he's just eating popcorn oh just
[1:10:05] watch this part watch right here but
[1:10:07] they just fumbled oh that doesn't matter
[1:10:09] he watches the game entirely differently
[1:10:12] what is it it doesn't matter if he
[1:10:14] fumbles Hallelujah it doesn't matter if
[1:10:17] he throws an interception he already
[1:10:19] knows I win in the end oh my brother if
[1:10:23] you could ever get a picture of the book
[1:10:25] you're already a winner you've already
[1:10:28] won in Christ Jesus and nothing can
[1:10:31] happen to you that can separate you from
[1:10:34] your destination in Christ
[1:10:37] Jesus if you ever get a picture you'll
[1:10:40] live your life completely
[1:10:45] different
[1:10:47] Hallelujah Jeremiah would say for I know
[1:10:50] the thoughts that word means the plans
[1:10:53] yeah I know the plans that you have for
[1:10:57] me oh than he says I know the thoughts
[1:11:01] that you think towards me saith the Lord
[1:11:02] thoughts of peace and not of evil but to
[1:11:05] give me an expected
[1:11:09] end that means pre-planned not random
[1:11:13] not oh you might make it might not might
[1:11:15] make it might
[1:11:18] not what the Bible is saying is that God
[1:11:21] charts the course of every
[1:11:25] life with a specific plan let me say it
[1:11:29] this way
[1:11:31] Specific
[1:11:34] Instructions and the instructions he has
[1:11:37] over my life won't work for
[1:11:41] yours and the course he's charted for me
[1:11:44] I can't you can't walk that I can't walk
[1:11:47] your course in fact you'll go through
[1:11:50] things that I will never go through
[1:11:52] because I'm not not made to go through
[1:11:56] them and you'll face challenges that
[1:11:58] I'll never face in my life because God
[1:12:01] has not equip me to face that challenge
[1:12:04] but let me just say I want to give you
[1:12:05] confidence today if you're if God has
[1:12:08] called you to it God will see you
[1:12:10] through
[1:12:11] it if God has called you to it he will
[1:12:14] see you through it he's already equipped
[1:12:18] you regardless of how you feel
[1:12:22] today even Pharaoh was raised up the
[1:12:25] Bible says for a purpose you know even
[1:12:28] Judas was raised up for a purpose but
[1:12:30] let me just say my purpose is not a
[1:12:32] pharaoh it's not a Judas I'm not here to
[1:12:35] walk away from the truth I've been
[1:12:37] called to be an
[1:12:39] overcomer in Christ Jesus the prophet of
[1:12:43] God would say if he called me then he
[1:12:44] must have had a purpose in calling me
[1:12:47] and I intend to serve the purpose God
[1:12:51] has placed in my life
[1:12:57] life and so let me just take just a turn
[1:13:01] here before we close it's
[1:13:07] 11:20 Samson's life is chared it's
[1:13:10] blueprinted it's you say my what more
[1:13:14] could he need brother Matt what more did
[1:13:17] he need he had an anointing he had a
[1:13:20] calling God had even before he was ever
[1:13:22] born and God said I'll never remove that
[1:13:25] calling from your life even all the way
[1:13:27] to your death that calling will stay
[1:13:29] right there waiting waiting waiting
[1:13:32] waiting you say what more what more did
[1:13:36] Samson need he had everything wow you
[1:13:39] see but here's where the problem here's
[1:13:42] where the trouble comes in
[1:13:44] man though he's anointed though he's
[1:13:47] called though he's chosen though he's
[1:13:48] predestinated he's also made up of
[1:13:52] memories conscience reasonings
[1:13:55] imaginations
[1:13:58] affections and God has given him the
[1:14:01] ability to make a
[1:14:06] choice to make the right decision we
[1:14:11] know his story very well I don't want to
[1:14:13] take time just to read through it but
[1:14:16] you know the story in judges I think
[1:14:18] it's four the next chapter CH chapter 14
[1:14:21] he's telling his parents to you know to
[1:14:23] take this woman of Timnath and and get
[1:14:26] her for me for a wife and as Samson's
[1:14:31] parents are saying Samson is there not a
[1:14:34] woman from amongst the daughters of our
[1:14:36] people but you've got to go to the
[1:14:38] Philistines and and and and and and and
[1:14:41] all of this you see then his life goes
[1:14:43] from there and he's in Gaza and and he's
[1:14:46] you know sleeping with a harlet there
[1:14:47] and then he raises up and God you know
[1:14:50] gives him God gives him a great Victory
[1:14:52] but you notice this pattern in his
[1:14:55] life and it seemed like he would just
[1:14:57] for a season he would for that moment
[1:15:00] for That season a time you know he was
[1:15:03] faithful to the Lord and then he would
[1:15:06] dip right back down go right back into
[1:15:08] that same rut and then he would Shake
[1:15:10] himself and then spirit of God would
[1:15:12] come and he delivered out of that and
[1:15:15] then he'd go right back up and then
[1:15:16] right back down you go all the way
[1:15:18] through his life and you see this life
[1:15:20] of never making a firm decision you know
[1:15:23] brother bam says that you've got to make
[1:15:25] a clearcut
[1:15:28] decision a clearcut
[1:15:31] decision he preaches that message
[1:15:33] forsaking all and says any man or son or
[1:15:35] daughter of God would have to come to
[1:15:37] that place in their life to where
[1:15:38] they're willing to forsake
[1:15:42] all mother father brother sister husband
[1:15:48] wife willing to forsake
[1:15:51] all you know it's a it's a let me just
[1:15:54] say this it's a powerful thing for a son
[1:15:57] or daughter of God when they could ever
[1:15:59] get to that place in their life when God
[1:16:02] knows their heart that they are willing
[1:16:05] to forsake all to follow
[1:16:09] him I tell you what it'll bring a power
[1:16:12] in your life like you've never known
[1:16:14] it'll bring an anointing upon your life
[1:16:16] when God ever gets a man to a place or a
[1:16:18] woman to a place where he knows they're
[1:16:20] willing to forsake it all for the Lord
[1:16:25] Jesus and Samson's you know his life
[1:16:27] very well the Carnage that follows his
[1:16:30] life we don't have time to get through
[1:16:31] all of it but it's just a life of chaos
[1:16:36] and Carnage you find the same exact
[1:16:38] thing in Genesis if you have your Bible
[1:16:40] turn with me to Genesis chapter 28
[1:16:43] quickly if you
[1:16:45] could Genesis chapter
[1:16:48] 28 you find the very similar life in
[1:16:52] this man Jacob
[1:16:58] and I want you to notice this as Jacob
[1:17:02] says this here and it's such a powerful
[1:17:06] thing when God in Genesis chapter 28 he
[1:17:09] appears to Jacob and out of a dream and
[1:17:12] and I just want you to notice here is
[1:17:14] let's just pick it up here and let me
[1:17:16] find my place let's just pick it up here
[1:17:18] in verse 12 and he dreamed and behold a
[1:17:20] ladder set up on the earth and the top
[1:17:22] of it reached to heaven and behold the
[1:17:23] angel of God ascended and descended on
[1:17:25] it behold the Lord I want you to see
[1:17:27] this the Lord stood above it I love that
[1:17:31] the Lord stood above it and said I am
[1:17:35] the Lord God of Abraham thy father the
[1:17:37] god of Isaac the land wherein thou liest
[1:17:39] to thee will I give it into thy seed thy
[1:17:42] shall thy seed shall be as the dust of
[1:17:44] the earth and shall spread abroad to the
[1:17:45] west and to the east to the north the
[1:17:47] South and in thee and thy seed shall all
[1:17:49] the families of the earth be blessed and
[1:17:50] behold I am with thee
[1:17:53] behold Jacob I am with
[1:17:58] thee do you know God says this and this
[1:18:02] is when he makes a covenant promise to
[1:18:05] his children he says in the book of
[1:18:07] Isaiah can a woman forget her suckling
[1:18:11] babe yay they
[1:18:14] may but I'll never forget
[1:18:17] you behold I have Graven you in the
[1:18:20] palms of my hands I'll never forget you
[1:18:24] and and and he says this here to Jacob
[1:18:27] behold I am with thee and I will keep
[1:18:32] thee in all the
[1:18:36] places all the
[1:18:38] crossroads all the turns all the left
[1:18:41] turns all the right turns Jacob you're
[1:18:44] going to go a lot of places God never
[1:18:46] told you to go you're going to find in
[1:18:49] Jacob's life God said go right and Jacob
[1:18:51] went left
[1:18:53] they're going to find go God tells Jacob
[1:18:55] to go straight and Jacob does a U-turn
[1:18:57] and goes back the other
[1:18:59] way but you know what's so powerful
[1:19:02] about that is God says I'm with you in
[1:19:05] all of the places that you go in other
[1:19:08] words I'm not going to stand there and
[1:19:10] wait when you go right I'm just going to
[1:19:12] stand there and wait and let you go God
[1:19:14] says I'm going to go with you I'm going
[1:19:16] to tell you Jacob I'm going to give you
[1:19:18] my instruction I'm going to give you my
[1:19:20] word but I want you to notice the
[1:19:22] Covenant of the promise I'm placing upon
[1:19:24] your life will be one that never departs
[1:19:27] from you behold notice this read it
[1:19:29] together I am with thee verse 15 and I
[1:19:33] will keep thee in all the places that
[1:19:35] thou go and I will bring thee again into
[1:19:37] this land for I will not leave thee
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:43] Hallelujah until I have done that which
[1:19:46] I have spoken to thee
[1:19:49] of Jacob woke up and Ja Jacob says oh
[1:19:54] surely the Lord was in this place and I
[1:19:57] knew it not takes a pillar and a stone
[1:20:01] and he takes oil and he anoints it and
[1:20:04] he's memorializing this
[1:20:06] place and Jacob says oh he says surely
[1:20:10] the Lord was here and I knew it not and
[1:20:12] this is none other than the house of
[1:20:15] God and he names this place notice this
[1:20:18] is his original calling his commission
[1:20:21] his experience
[1:20:23] and he names this place bethl the house
[1:20:26] of God notice this here in verse the
[1:20:29] verse 17 he was afraid how Dreadful is
[1:20:31] this place none other than the house of
[1:20:32] God and this is the Gate of
[1:20:35] Heaven he takes the St pours oil upon it
[1:20:37] calls the name verse 19 the name of that
[1:20:40] place
[1:20:42] bethl but the name of the city was
[1:20:45] called lse at the first and Jacob vow to
[1:20:47] vow saying if God be with me and keep me
[1:20:49] in this way that I go I will give me
[1:20:51] give me bread to eat and raign to put
[1:20:52] put on so that I come again to my
[1:20:54] father's house in peace then shall the
[1:20:56] Lord be my God and the stone which I
[1:20:58] have set for a pillar shall be God's
[1:21:01] house and of all that thou shalt give me
[1:21:04] I will surely give the tenth unto
[1:21:10] thee God is you notice what happens he
[1:21:14] places his promise he joins himself to
[1:21:19] Jacob in fact if you ever look up the
[1:21:22] word
[1:21:23] When God Says behold I have Graven thee
[1:21:26] in the Palms this is Isaiah
[1:21:28] 49 I will not forget thee I have Graven
[1:21:32] thee upon the palms of my hands thy
[1:21:35] walls Isaiah 49 are continually verse 16
[1:21:39] before me thy walls are continually
[1:21:44] before me how alone you know sometimes
[1:21:46] you can feel so alone and so so so such
[1:21:50] Solitude in in our own personal strength
[1:21:52] struggles I don't care what struggle it
[1:21:54] is if it's a besetting sin if it's some
[1:21:57] addiction if it's some something that's
[1:21:59] tripping you up and you can sometimes
[1:22:01] feel so
[1:22:02] alone oh and sometimes you think of God
[1:22:05] as an anger that God is just ready to
[1:22:08] strike you and he's just left you all
[1:22:10] alone because you're worthless and we
[1:22:12] you know we think that God has just been
[1:22:14] on giving us wrath or judgment but do
[1:22:17] you realize what God is actually saying
[1:22:19] is such the
[1:22:21] contrary I'll never leave you your walls
[1:22:25] are continually before
[1:22:27] me I will not forget you your walls the
[1:22:31] word here is choma which means joined to
[1:22:35] a wall it's like a brick mason when he
[1:22:37] lays a brick upon another brick and upon
[1:22:39] another brick before you had bricks that
[1:22:41] were separate but now they become one
[1:22:45] piece and God says when I made the
[1:22:48] promise to you I want you to understand
[1:22:50] how powerful it is Jacob I'm joining
[1:22:54] myself to you in other words your
[1:22:58] captivity is my captivity your prison
[1:23:01] becomes my prison your anguish becomes
[1:23:03] my anguish your sorrow becomes my sorrow
[1:23:06] let me give you the language of the New
[1:23:08] Testament he is a high priest that can
[1:23:11] be touched by the feelings of your
[1:23:15] infirmities I'm join to you Jacob and no
[1:23:20] matter where you go I'll go no matter
[1:23:21] where you stay I'll
[1:23:24] stay and God makes this
[1:23:27] promise now 40 years Jacob from this
[1:23:31] moment that Jacob sees this
[1:23:36] dream Jacob wakes up and
[1:23:40] 20 oh long
[1:23:43] years 20 long years of time elapsed from
[1:23:49] that experience you say what was it
[1:23:51] brother Matt surely it was years of
[1:23:54] prosperity and years of serving the lord
[1:23:56] and years of accomplishing things for
[1:23:59] God no you'll find 20 long years of
[1:24:02] backslid in
[1:24:04] Jacob trials and tribulations and
[1:24:07] sorrows
[1:24:10] and but you know what God was always
[1:24:14] joined to Jacob just as he gave the
[1:24:17] promise to
[1:24:18] Samson I'm join to you Jacob
[1:24:23] after leaving bethl Jacob settles
[1:24:26] down quickly forgets that glorious
[1:24:30] Supernatural
[1:24:32] moment in that dream that he has he
[1:24:35] becomes cold he becomes carnal he
[1:24:37] becomes backslid and
[1:24:39] lustful and then God Appears to Jacob
[1:24:42] again notice this in Genesis 31 could
[1:24:45] you turn there quickly Genesis 31 I want
[1:24:48] you to notice what God says here to
[1:24:51] Jacob he comes to him and he visits him
[1:24:58] again Genesis chapter 31 look at verse
[1:25:07] 13 I am the god of
[1:25:13] bethl where thou anointest the pillar
[1:25:17] where thou vow to vow unto me now arise
[1:25:23] get thee out from this land in other
[1:25:25] words I don't need to discuss what
[1:25:27] you've done you already know what you've
[1:25:28] done wrong we don't need to rehearse it
[1:25:31] I just want to give you my message get
[1:25:33] up
[1:25:34] Jacob go back to bethl I'm not the god
[1:25:38] of your coldness I'm not the god of your
[1:25:40] backslid andness I'm the god of
[1:25:43] bethl where th vow to vow and return go
[1:25:48] back to bethl Jacob go back to bethl
[1:25:51] this was God saying remember Jacob how I
[1:25:53] touched you remember how I spoke to you
[1:25:57] remember that experience that you had
[1:25:59] now get back to the altar get back to
[1:26:03] bethl where you made a vow unto
[1:26:06] me instead Jacob sh settles down in
[1:26:13] Sheck instead of listening to God
[1:26:16] instead of heeding the voice of the Lord
[1:26:19] Jacob goes to sheam sheam means two
[1:26:21] things if you look up the word it means
[1:26:23] going back not back to
[1:26:26] bethl but
[1:26:29] backsliding and also means a place of
[1:26:35] burdens a place of burdens burdens God
[1:26:39] never intended for Jacob his wife his
[1:26:43] children his sons his daughters this
[1:26:47] wasn't part of the
[1:26:49] blueprint this wasn't part of the plan
[1:26:53] this was a
[1:26:54] deviation this was a
[1:26:58] detour and Jacob goes to Sheck them the
[1:27:01] place of burdens and oh oh Jacob do you
[1:27:04] realize what burdens that choice the
[1:27:07] cost of your
[1:27:11] choice do you realize who it was going
[1:27:13] to affect it's not just you but now your
[1:27:18] house is going to become
[1:27:20] Dishonored one of your daughters going
[1:27:22] to to be defiled your sons do you did
[1:27:25] you did you survey any of this before
[1:27:28] you ever made that choice oh friend
[1:27:31] sometimes if we'd ever weigh as Jesus
[1:27:33] said count the
[1:27:34] cost did you weigh it out Jacob when you
[1:27:37] were reasoning and
[1:27:40] rationalizing and you were going to make
[1:27:42] that decision yeah you knew that job was
[1:27:44] going to take you away from church but
[1:27:46] you needed to make the money and you
[1:27:48] Justified it because of this and because
[1:27:50] of that need but did you you really
[1:27:52] weigh the cost of what it was going to
[1:27:54] cost
[1:27:57] you did you really ever realize Jacob
[1:28:00] that now your choices are having a
[1:28:03] collateral
[1:28:05] effect they don't just affect you they
[1:28:07] affect the mother they affect the
[1:28:09] children they affect the
[1:28:12] church oh but I feel led you know I I
[1:28:16] feel led you know it's amazing sometimes
[1:28:18] what we will attach to I feel
[1:28:21] led yeah I feel
[1:28:24] led and sometimes you look at the
[1:28:26] decision that people make and you think
[1:28:28] there is no
[1:28:29] way you felt
[1:28:31] led I feel led to take this job that
[1:28:35] takes me out of the house of God let me
[1:28:36] just say this the leadership of God will
[1:28:38] never lead you away from his
[1:28:42] word the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:28:45] will never lead you away from the spirit
[1:28:47] of
[1:28:48] God is that all
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:53] did you realize your sons are going to
[1:28:56] have to become
[1:28:58] murderers to save your
[1:29:03] daughter what
[1:29:05] happened what happened you had a plan
[1:29:08] you had a promise you had a calling you
[1:29:10] had a vision you were chosen God
[1:29:12] ordained you God predestinated you how
[1:29:17] do you end up
[1:29:19] here
[1:29:20] Jacob what are you
[1:29:23] doing do you realize the effect this is
[1:29:26] going to
[1:29:27] have the
[1:29:29] burdens that you so
[1:29:32] needlessly are going to have to
[1:29:35] bear did it ever cross your
[1:29:38] mind did it ever did you ever stop I
[1:29:43] promise I
[1:29:46] promise that God warned
[1:29:50] you why long before you ever made it I
[1:29:55] promise he was faithful to warn you he
[1:29:59] will never tempt you above that which
[1:30:02] you can be tempted but with that
[1:30:04] Temptation he'll make a way of
[1:30:08] Escape Samson he warned you he wasn't he
[1:30:13] was faithful in telling you when you
[1:30:15] took that girl and you knew that she
[1:30:18] wasn't a Believer and you knew that you
[1:30:20] tried to justify it in your mind and
[1:30:22] I'll persuade her and I'll get her to
[1:30:23] church and oh you knew when you took him
[1:30:26] as your boyfriend and you knew what you
[1:30:28] were oh well I'll get him into church
[1:30:29] and I know what God can do but you were
[1:30:31] warned Samson you were told by your
[1:30:35] parents you were warned do you know what
[1:30:38] the problem was with Samson is all
[1:30:40] Samson seen was
[1:30:43] Mom oh it's just
[1:30:45] Mom it's just Mom it's just Pastor you
[1:30:49] know I know I know I know I know he
[1:30:52] preach going to preach it going to
[1:30:53] preach the same thing you know what the
[1:30:54] problem was is that Samson failed to
[1:30:57] heed the warning
[1:31:00] signs do you know God always puts the
[1:31:02] warning signs in your
[1:31:05] life he puts the
[1:31:08] barricades he he puts the warning signs
[1:31:11] it'd be like going over a road and and
[1:31:14] there are signs that would any of us get
[1:31:15] in our car and just you know broken road
[1:31:18] closed don't don't enter do not enter
[1:31:21] all caution red light caution turn
[1:31:25] around go the other way how many of us
[1:31:27] would just get in our car and just blow
[1:31:28] through them and just pit barricade and
[1:31:30] sandbags and barrels flying this way and
[1:31:32] lights flashing this we're just going
[1:31:34] right through
[1:31:36] them warning turn around you say that's
[1:31:40] funny and how many times does the Lord
[1:31:43] warn us and warn us and warn us and warn
[1:31:46] Us in sermon after sermon and service
[1:31:48] after service and mother after father
[1:31:50] after brother after your friend don't do
[1:31:52] it don't go that way and God warns us
[1:31:54] and warns us and warns us and we just
[1:31:57] keep going and going and
[1:32:01] going friends this is just what the Lord
[1:32:04] I didn't expect to preach this but I'm
[1:32:06] just obeying the
[1:32:09] Lord go back Jacob what are you
[1:32:13] doing you're going to this place of
[1:32:16] burdens did you ever did you ever
[1:32:19] consider what it would cost you Jacob
[1:32:22] did you ever

[1:35:54] I'm sorry I made the wrong choice I'm
[1:35:57] sorry I made the wrong decision but
[1:35:59] today is the day of salvation today I'm
[1:36:03] going to choose to make a different
[1:36:05] Choice oh how many can say that today
[1:36:08] and say Lord today let me make the right
[1:36:11] choice for my life today let me arise
[1:36:14] and go back to
[1:36:17] bethl you know what Jacob did I love
[1:36:19] this jacob picks up all of his garments
[1:36:21] all of his idols and he and he burns
[1:36:25] them takes all the earrings and takes
[1:36:27] all of the garments of that land and he
[1:36:29] burns them and the Bible says there he
[1:36:31] creates an altar notice this let us
[1:36:34] arise Jacob said un his household verse
[1:36:36] two of Genesis 35 and all that were with
[1:36:38] him put away the strange gods that are
[1:36:40] among you and be clean I love that and
[1:36:43] be clean and change your garments let us
[1:36:47] arise and go to bethl go up to bethl and
[1:36:50] I will make there an altar unto God who
[1:36:52] answered me in the day of my distress
[1:36:54] and was with me in the way which I went
[1:36:56] and they gave unto Jacob all the strange
[1:36:58] gods that were in their hand all their
[1:37:00] earrings which were in their ears and
[1:37:01] Jacob hid them under the oak which was
[1:37:03] by sheam and they journeyed and the
[1:37:05] terror of God was upon all the cities
[1:37:07] that were round about them and they did
[1:37:08] not pursue after the sons of Jacob in
[1:37:11] verse 7even and he built an
[1:37:13] altar he built an
[1:37:16] altar and he called The Place El bethl
[1:37:23] notice before notice the name
[1:37:28] change because before Jacob named it
[1:37:32] bethl he names it bethl but now it's
[1:37:36] going to be El
[1:37:38] bethl in other words not House of God
[1:37:42] but God's
[1:37:44] house a dwelling place for the Holy
[1:37:47] Spirit to dwell

[1:38:45] decision
[1:38:46] Lord to go back to bethl musicians could
[1:38:49] you come to
[1:38:52] arise and go
[1:38:54] back to heed the voice of the Lord
[1:38:58] friends every head
[1:39:00] bowed every eye
[1:39:13] closed such a simple
[1:39:17] thing such a simple
[1:39:20] thing
[1:39:26] obedience but I just want to tell you
[1:39:30] today that one of the greatest things
[1:39:33] that'll
[1:39:35] unlock unlock the power of God in our
[1:39:38] life is just simple obedience to his
[1:39:44] word sometimes we pray and we pray and
[1:39:46] we pray and we're seeking God and we're
[1:39:49] seeking the direction of God and seeking
[1:39:51] the will of God but do you realize God
[1:39:54] will never show us what's next if we're
[1:39:57] not faithful in doing what he's already
[1:39:59] told us to
[1:40:01] do you'll never find the channel of
[1:40:03] what's next until you submit to what God
[1:40:08] has said
[1:40:10] now I wonder if there'd be somebody here
[1:40:13] on this Opening Service even before we
[1:40:16] start this these
[1:40:19] meetings there's a lot of things that we
[1:40:21] might need in our life a lot of things
[1:40:23] that we're looking for a lot of things
[1:40:24] we're praying for a lot of decisions a
[1:40:27] lot of burdens and things that we carry
[1:40:30] friends I don't care what state I don't
[1:40:32] care how messed up your house is I don't
[1:40:35] care how great the task seems I don't
[1:40:37] care how impossible it seems I want to
[1:40:40] tell you this morning in such a simple
[1:40:42] way the Lord just put this upon my heart
[1:40:45] this morning even before I came to
[1:40:47] service and I want to tell you that
[1:40:49] everything St starts here's what I know
[1:40:53] you say how do I get to the finished
[1:40:55] product how do I how do I get back to
[1:40:57] full restoration how do I how does I
[1:40:59] come back to full reconciliation here's
[1:41:01] what I know it starts with
[1:41:04] repentance it's got to there's nothing
[1:41:08] you'll never get anywhere in God until
[1:41:10] you come to this place of bethl come to
[1:41:13] the altar of repentance and say God I
[1:41:16] just want to start right here Lord I
[1:41:18] want to turn around and go the other
[1:41:21] direction Lord save my home save my
[1:41:25] house save my children where does it
[1:41:26] start revival can only begin at the
[1:41:30] place of
[1:41:32] repentance to say God I've been wrong
[1:41:35] but today I Want to Be Right Lord oh my
[1:41:38] hands up I rais both of my hands today
[1:41:40] and say Lord if there'd be anywhere in
[1:41:43] my life that I'm be I'm not obedient
[1:41:45] Lord to what you've showed me if I'm
[1:41:48] come to any spot in my life Lord where
[1:41:49] I've been disobedient Obi to a word that
[1:41:51] you've spoken I don't want to continue
[1:41:53] down the same pattern with the same
[1:41:56] choices but today I I want to fight
[1:41:58] yesterday with one choice today that
[1:42:01] could change my entire life one decision
[1:42:04] to say today God I want to make a choice
[1:42:08] Lord and I just want to say would you
[1:42:09] forgive me
[1:42:11] Jesus would you forgive me Lord I want
[1:42:13] to be clean wash my mind wash my memory
[1:42:17] wash my conscience wash my spirit Lord I
[1:42:21] I I I want to stand before you without
[1:42:23] condemnation I wonder if that'd be the
[1:42:25] prayer of a young man maybe a mother
[1:42:27] father maybe you'd pray that and raise a
[1:42:29] hand and say Lord I just want to stand
[1:42:31] before you Justified I don't want the
[1:42:34] devil to the accuser to be able to fight
[1:42:36] me or bother me in my mind from these
[1:42:38] meetings from receiving the word and
[1:42:40] trying to tell me what I did and how
[1:42:42] what I did yesterday today Lord I want
[1:42:45] the the washing of the Water by the word
[1:42:48] to come and justify me Lord and as
[1:42:50] though I never did it in the first place
[1:42:52] I raise my hand and say God wash me
[1:42:55] clean me Lord God that I may stand
[1:42:58] before you white pure unadulterated
[1:43:02] untouched Lord where I could stand
[1:43:05] before you as the Bible says if our
[1:43:08] hearts condemn us not then we can have
[1:43:11] faith to ask for whatever we ask
[1:43:14] whatever we need Lord if our hearts

[1:43:45] moment in the presence of God with an
[1:43:48] honest heart to say Lord I'm sorry for
[1:43:50] forgive me and you'll never speak of it
[1:43:54] again restoration is not some long
