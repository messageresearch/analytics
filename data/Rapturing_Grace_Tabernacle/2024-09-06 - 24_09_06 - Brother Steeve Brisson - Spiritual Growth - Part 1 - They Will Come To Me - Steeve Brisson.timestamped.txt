[56:38] impressed amen praise the Lord we'll
[56:40] turn in our Bible tonight and the Book
[56:42] of St
[56:46] John as I said time fly so fast and uh I
[56:51] was told that last time I was here there
[56:53] was like a 2-year-old boy and now he's
[56:55] like 10
[56:57] and uh some got married and even on my
[57:00] end last time I was here I showed a
[57:02] picture of my family maybe we can uh
[57:04] bring up the PowerPoint I don't know if
[57:05] it's this is
[57:07] available um and so last time I spoke
[57:11] about my son he had a
[57:13] business and uh now he's
[57:16] married uh so we can bring it up if it's
[57:20] uh ready before we turn into the Bible
[57:22] just wanted to update you because you
[57:24] saw little kids but it's changed quite a
[57:26] bit so I think they are trying
[57:30] to have it set up on the main screen
[57:34] here so since then my son sold his
[57:37] business lawn Mo business for those who
[57:39] heard the story just want to update you
[57:42] so he sold his business covid was quite
[57:44] difficult uh back home I don't know how
[57:47] it was in New Zealand but during Co the
[57:49] government was paying people to stay
[57:51] home so it was hard to find people that
[57:53] wanted to work because they'd get more
[57:55] money staying home
[57:56] so it was really really difficult so he
[57:58] ended up selling selling his business
[58:00] and then he he got married and uh so we
[58:04] have now four girls left at home and I
[58:07] have to buy a shotgun cuz
[58:10] uh they like to
[58:13] travel and yeah you go read only I don't
[58:16] know if it's that yeah so they like to
[58:19] travel and uh so last time they went to
[58:22] a camp in Ohio I said I asked a girl I
[58:24] said should should I expect some phone
[58:28] calls so yeah so much uh big uh big
[58:32] girls and so William ended up married uh
[58:36] the neighbor down the
[58:38] street Lily she it's a family we brought
[58:42] to the Lord and Lily was the first one
[58:45] to come to the Lord uh out of the family
[58:48] and she said I want the Jesus of the
[58:50] Bron Bryson Bron's a family name so she
[58:53] gave her life to the Lord and Williamson
[58:56] since he was 13 um this going to be my
[58:59] wife he never told her obviously but it
[59:01] was kind of a family secret really like
[59:03] he had a his heart his eyes upon her
[59:07] she's a precious daughter of God and so
[59:10] they got married last May and because he
[59:12] worked so hard all his Youth and he sold
[59:15] his business you know so he had he had
[59:17] money so they took a trip in Europe and
[59:19] two months and a half honeymoon trip so
[59:22] it was it was the reward after so much
[59:25] work
[59:26] and so now he bought a house and so they
[59:29] got established so this is the update
[59:31] not to bring the attention on our family
[59:34] it's just for those who were there at
[59:35] Family Camp we shared a bit of a
[59:37] testimony and so now we've updated you

[1:01:35] amen you may be
[1:01:38] seated in coming here I kind
[1:01:41] of thought about the precious meetings
[1:01:44] we had the The First Family Camp I still
[1:01:47] remember and then the camp at the Family
[1:01:50] Camp we came after or youth service with
[1:01:52] brother cadri digs it was such a such a
[1:01:54] blessing me and me and
[1:01:56] still talk about that the camp me in the
[1:02:00] morning and him at night the tag team
[1:02:03] it's so so much Precious Precious
[1:02:05] Memories
[1:02:06] amen this weekend we're going to take a
[1:02:08] journey together and I'm going to want
[1:02:11] to give you maybe a heads up to uh where
[1:02:14] we're going with this and our title
[1:02:17] tonight is um they will come to
[1:02:21] me Lord willing our title tomorrow night
[1:02:24] will be
[1:02:26] are you
[1:02:28] perfect and
[1:02:31] um the the greater
[1:02:34] theme because these are all subtitles
[1:02:37] but the main theme will be spiritual
[1:02:39] growth during the weekend and of course
[1:02:42] maybe tomorrow night for the young
[1:02:43] people we'll have something might be
[1:02:45] just a side side thought that I have a
[1:02:48] burden to share with especially with the
[1:02:51] having just a young people there but we
[1:02:54] want to talk about spiritual growth
[1:02:57] this weekend but before we move into the
[1:02:59] topic of the spiritual growth I want
[1:03:03] to maybe lay a
[1:03:06] foundation and so the
[1:03:09] thought this weekend is going to be
[1:03:11] about the importance of spiritual growth
[1:03:13] and maturity now already told me that
[1:03:16] you've listened to the gender confusion
[1:03:19] series the message I preached at the
[1:03:21] Youth Camp last year I think it was at
[1:03:24] the Youth Camp there in Edmonton
[1:03:26] and in in that topic we talk about the
[1:03:28] maturity of the son you know that it
[1:03:31] comes from hearing the voice of the
[1:03:33] father there's a natural line natural
[1:03:36] thought to this topic that's really
[1:03:37] important but there's a also there's a
[1:03:39] spiritual element that is even more
[1:03:41] important we got to hear from our father
[1:03:44] and it's the only one who's going to
[1:03:45] bring us to
[1:03:47] maturity but before we move in uh uh
[1:03:50] that topic before we even talk about
[1:03:53] maturity tonight we want to lay a found
[1:03:55] Foundation of what in my experience and
[1:03:59] what I'm when I've seen you I grew up in
[1:04:00] the message we see many message people
[1:04:03] I've seen one thing that Enders
[1:04:06] Christian a lot and and we're talking
[1:04:09] about message people that Enders them is
[1:04:12] that they're spent most of the time
[1:04:14] worrying about their
[1:04:17] status and their status is someday they
[1:04:21] feel like a Christian and they feel like
[1:04:23] they're Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:04:26] other days we don't and we struggle with
[1:04:31] this am I worthy to be a Son of God uh H
[1:04:35] uh uh did the Lord choose me or did I
[1:04:38] choose him uh uh am am I good enough for
[1:04:42] him and it's really hard to mature and
[1:04:45] to grow if we keep un rooting the plant
[1:04:49] if you plant a garden and every time you
[1:04:51] have to unroot it and say what did I
[1:04:52] planted here what what kind of see was
[1:04:55] oh okay this okay okay that was it and
[1:04:57] then the next day you're like I'm
[1:04:58] wondering what I put in the ground and
[1:05:00] then you unroot you remove the dirt take
[1:05:03] the seat what it was again what and
[1:05:04] you're always worrying about the
[1:05:07] status and and in doing that we're not
[1:05:12] growing because we are
[1:05:14] blocking the Fest
[1:05:18] stage and so for that we have to be sure
[1:05:23] and to understand what makes us Sons and
[1:05:26] Daughters of God to begin with and if we
[1:05:29] don't answer that question we'll always
[1:05:32] fall back to am I a Son of God am I a
[1:05:35] daughter of God or not we don't know
[1:05:37] we're not sure because we have to
[1:05:39] determine that by the revelation of the
[1:05:41] word of the hour what makes us Sons and
[1:05:44] Daughters of
[1:05:46] God now before we move into that topic
[1:05:48] there's something really important we
[1:05:50] need to understand I've asked brother
[1:05:53] Ari if you were uh uh um because as the
[1:05:57] song leader said I don't know you much
[1:05:59] and so it it has an advantage in the
[1:06:02] sense that we uh we come here we don't
[1:06:06] know you know really where the people is
[1:06:08] what's the Thought where where you're in
[1:06:10] your journey so we really come here
[1:06:12] beyond the pulpit by
[1:06:14] faith and so I've asked him if the
[1:06:17] church was uh acquainted with the
[1:06:19] progressive revelation he says yeah we
[1:06:21] talk about that many time and all that
[1:06:23] so I just want to touch on that because
[1:06:25] it's really really important and and
[1:06:27] people who doesn't understand the the
[1:06:30] prog progressive revelation as as
[1:06:32] brother Brandon moved in his ministry
[1:06:34] the Lord kept to opening the word to him
[1:06:38] and and in that in that Journey there is
[1:06:41] some teaching that has changed but I've
[1:06:43] I come from I was raised in a church
[1:06:45] where for from 47 to 65 everything is
[1:06:48] the same there's a continuity in a sense
[1:06:51] that there's no progression
[1:06:53] everything and it it you know what the
[1:06:55] result of that it makes people
[1:07:00] confused and
[1:07:01] so progressive revelation first of all
[1:07:04] is in the Bible you got it here in John
[1:07:08] St John chap 16:12 when Jesus says I
[1:07:12] have yet many things to say unto you but
[1:07:15] ye cannot bear them now so that's the
[1:07:20] basis Jesus is saying I got many to
[1:07:23] reveal to you but I will not reveal
[1:07:25] reveal them to you at once but I will
[1:07:30] progressively give you those things this
[1:07:32] is how Jesus work this is how God gave
[1:07:35] Israel the promised land I'll give you
[1:07:37] little by little from City I will not
[1:07:40] give it you at once why cuz you can't
[1:07:42] handle it it was the same thing with
[1:07:45] Jesus he could not give them all at once
[1:07:48] cuz they would not be able to Bear it it
[1:07:50] was too much just Eat My Flesh drink my
[1:07:54] blood more than half the church
[1:07:57] left he couldn't and and it was the same
[1:07:59] thing with the prophet Church caught in
[1:08:01] Tradition he has to it's a progressive
[1:08:04] revelation because he has to open the
[1:08:06] word as people are able and a able to
[1:08:08] receive it because every time God
[1:08:10] reveals himself it challenged the
[1:08:13] tradition John the Baptist has a
[1:08:15] progressive revelation and he's saying
[1:08:18] that here when he talks about so John
[1:08:20] the Baptist and William Braham had the
[1:08:22] same similar job they had to introduce
[1:08:24] the coming of the Lord and so when John
[1:08:27] the Baptist started his ministry his
[1:08:30] greatest mission was to introduce the
[1:08:32] coming of the Lord but when he started
[1:08:34] his ministry he didn't know what was the
[1:08:37] coming of the
[1:08:39] Lord God revealed him to him later
[1:08:42] that's why he says here in the scripture
[1:08:44] I knew him not about Jesus but that he
[1:08:48] should be made manifest to Israel
[1:08:50] therefore I am come baptizing with water
[1:08:52] and John bear record saying I saw a
[1:08:55] spirit descending from heaven like a
[1:08:56] dove and it abought upon him and I knew
[1:09:00] him not so basically John the Baptist is
[1:09:03] saying I had to introduce the Messiah
[1:09:05] but I don't I didn't know who he was now
[1:09:07] people could have start a website just
[1:09:09] there saying he contradicts himself
[1:09:11] because Jesus was his cousins I knew him
[1:09:13] not he knew him it's family
[1:09:16] members but he didn't know him in that
[1:09:24] manner when people want to trap a man of
[1:09:26] God and try to make him look
[1:09:29] bad God will allow stuff to be hanging
[1:09:33] so they can take it to go wrong with it
[1:09:37] amen and
[1:09:39] so when we talk about the prophet's
[1:09:43] Ministry there is small things you know
[1:09:46] just you know about you know when he's
[1:09:47] talking about the soul the spirit and
[1:09:49] the body you know he places those
[1:09:52] differently as the you know these are
[1:09:54] like small thing but there is Major
[1:09:58] element that's been changed when the
[1:10:02] opening the seal came and so I want to
[1:10:04] read you and this is just um the
[1:10:07] introduction here but it's really
[1:10:09] important because what I'm I'm about to
[1:10:10] preach unless you understand and you are
[1:10:13] sure of that you cannot receive the rest
[1:10:15] of the meeting that we're going to
[1:10:17] preach
[1:10:20] tonight so the prophet explained a
[1:10:23] process of when the seals was revealed
[1:10:25] to him him and there's certain key
[1:10:27] things that he's mentioning here and he
[1:10:29] says now let is standing now tonight as
[1:10:31] we enter into this sixth chapter he's
[1:10:33] got the book in his hand and starting to
[1:10:35] reveal it and oh I would have abs AB
[1:10:38] absolutely today and I hope that people
[1:10:40] are spiritual I would have had a hor
[1:10:43] horrible mistake on that that if it
[1:10:45] hadn't been about 12:00 today when the
[1:10:48] Holy Spirit came in the room and
[1:10:49] corrected me on something that I was
[1:10:52] writing down to say and I was taken from
[1:10:55] an old context it's really
[1:11:00] important I had nothing on it I don't
[1:11:02] know what he what's what the second seal
[1:11:05] is no more than nothing but I got some
[1:11:07] old context of something that I spoke on
[1:11:10] several years ago and I wrote it down
[1:11:12] and I gathered this context and Dr Smith
[1:11:15] and many great outstanding teachers and
[1:11:17] i' gather and all of them believe that
[1:11:19] so I wrote it down and I was fixing to
[1:11:22] say now well now I'll study it from that
[1:11:26] standpoint now a standpoint is a
[1:11:28] standpoint is where you're standing
[1:11:31] where when you're looking at this and so
[1:11:33] the prophet is saying is about to
[1:11:35] approach the seal from a
[1:11:38] standpoint but what the opening of the
[1:11:40] seal is is a changing of a standpoint
[1:11:44] cuz God wants to take his prophet and
[1:11:46] elevate it from a different View Point
[1:11:51] that he's able not to look at the book
[1:11:52] of redemption in a new way that no man
[1:11:56] ever touched that before because he
[1:11:57] would seal you're with me so the prophet
[1:12:02] is is is approaching a topic from an old
[1:12:05] context the way it was seen by you know
[1:12:08] major Dr Smith and other Scholars and
[1:12:11] all that and he's about to take their
[1:12:13] standpoint but God changed
[1:12:16] it so when God changes his standpoint
[1:12:20] the standpoint is about the the book of
[1:12:23] redemption so it's it's it's not little
[1:12:25] detail about the soul and the spirit and
[1:12:28] it's something greater than that it's
[1:12:30] the revelation of the book of redemption
[1:12:33] that was closed for so many years and if
[1:12:36] it was closed then we don't understand
[1:12:39] how Redemption is
[1:12:41] working amen nobody understood how
[1:12:44] Redemption is working until it was
[1:12:48] open
[1:12:51] amen so the prophet says immediately
[1:12:55] after that the angel of the Lord
[1:12:56] appeared and told about the seven
[1:12:58] trumpet or seven seal I was to return
[1:13:00] back to Jeffersonville and preach the
[1:13:01] seven seal and if I've ever said
[1:13:03] anything that was inspired it was in
[1:13:05] that there were the angel of the Lord
[1:13:07] met us and the Bible become a new Bible
[1:13:13] there it opened
[1:13:16] up so the the the shift when the the
[1:13:21] book got open is not just a detail or
[1:13:26] new information the bi the prophet says
[1:13:29] my Bible became a new
[1:13:32] Bible and reveal all the things that the
[1:13:35] reformers and things had left out which
[1:13:38] what the prophet was basing it on the
[1:13:41] reformers and Dr Smith and all those
[1:13:43] people but he's about to get a fresh
[1:13:48] update it was the complete revelation of
[1:13:51] Jesus Christ allog together new
[1:13:56] new to
[1:13:59] us but perfectly exactly with the
[1:14:02] scripture why am I reading that is for
[1:14:04] you to understand the major shift for
[1:14:08] the prophet himself that's right so if
[1:14:12] there's a major shift at that point and
[1:14:14] it's a new Bible and he says it's new to
[1:14:17] all of us it means that something has
[1:14:21] changed in the teaching after with the
[1:14:24] new
[1:14:27] standpoint that was the word which was
[1:14:29] always been I was so inspired and
[1:14:38] directed The Mysteries that wasn't the
[1:14:40] Seven Seals when these seven seal was
[1:14:43] open that opened up the
[1:14:47] entire
[1:14:49] Bible seven seal it was sealed with
[1:14:52] seven Mysteries and these seven sealed
[1:14:54] Eld held the entire mystery and it was
[1:14:58] the book of
[1:15:02] redemption so our topic
[1:15:05] tonight is they will come to
[1:15:10] me talking about
[1:15:15] Jesus and so they will come to me so our
[1:15:18] topic is tonight we want to talk about
[1:15:23] predestination and the question I want
[1:15:25] to ask you tonight is predestination
[1:15:29] your
[1:15:30] predestination is based on
[1:15:35] what and it's an important
[1:15:39] question because whatever answer you
[1:15:42] give to that question will
[1:15:45] determine the
[1:15:47] solidity of your
[1:15:50] walk what's this what it is based upon
[1:15:55] and and and so you got two
[1:15:59] choices the first one is your
[1:16:03] predestination is based on for
[1:16:06] knowledge that God saw your
[1:16:10] choice before the foundation of the
[1:16:13] world that you before foundation of the
[1:16:15] world you foreen
[1:16:18] so predestination would be based on God
[1:16:22] seeing you in this age making the right
[1:16:25] choice then saying okay since he's going
[1:16:28] to make the right choice I'm going to
[1:16:30] put his name in the book in the
[1:16:33] Redemption book that's one option that
[1:16:36] you have and the other that you have
[1:16:40] which are two lines in our own Circle
[1:16:44] I'm not talking about the Baptist the
[1:16:45] Pentecostal I'm talking within our
[1:16:50] ranks the other predestination would be
[1:16:53] based on
[1:16:55] origin origin means that Whatever
[1:16:59] Whenever where you come
[1:17:01] from that's where you return Hallelujah
[1:17:05] and it cannot be both it has to be one
[1:17:08] or the
[1:17:10] other and one then is based on your
[1:17:13] choice that God foreseen before the
[1:17:16] foundation of the world or the other one
[1:17:19] so God has foreseen that you would make
[1:17:21] the right choice but the other one is
[1:17:23] based on God
[1:17:27] choice and it might seem like well it's
[1:17:30] just a play on word it's just this this
[1:17:32] no no no there's a great
[1:17:35] impact on how you have your Christian
[1:17:38] walk today there's
[1:17:41] consequences if the whole thing is based
[1:17:44] on your choice or the whole thing is
[1:17:48] based on God's
[1:17:51] choice and so predestination based on
[1:17:55] origin it's linked to I come from God
[1:17:59] and I go back to
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:07] god
[1:18:12] so let's get to see and
[1:18:15] look and go back to the
[1:18:20] scripture Jesus says all all
[1:18:25] everyone that the father giveth to me
[1:18:29] shall come to me that's my title tonight
[1:18:32] they will come to me
[1:18:36] amen and him that cometh to me I will in
[1:18:40] no wise cast out here you have two
[1:18:44] groups of
[1:18:46] people the first group of people is
[1:18:48] those that the father
[1:18:51] giveth and the second group is those
[1:18:53] that choose chose him and they don't
[1:18:57] have the same
[1:19:02] inheritance and this is the father will
[1:19:05] which has sent me that all that of all
[1:19:08] which he ha given me I should lose
[1:19:11] nothing so basically that first
[1:19:14] category in no way they can be
[1:19:18] lost no
[1:19:21] way okay and this is the will of him
[1:19:24] that sent me that everyone of which
[1:19:26] seeth the son and Believe on him may
[1:19:29] have everlasting life and I will raise
[1:19:31] him up in the last
[1:19:35] days now the prophet explained
[1:19:38] that that there is two groups in verse
[1:19:46] 37 we're going to read this other
[1:19:48] scripture before we read the quote my
[1:19:49] sheep hear my voice and I know them and
[1:19:51] they follow me and I give un them unto
[1:19:54] them the eternal life and they shall
[1:19:56] never perish neither shall any man pluck
[1:20:00] them out of my hand my Father which gave
[1:20:03] them
[1:20:04] me is greater than all and no
[1:20:08] man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:20:10] father's hands so this is the same group
[1:20:13] again those that the father gave me so
[1:20:15] those that the fathers
[1:20:17] choose they will come to me and I will
[1:20:21] lose nothing and no man is able to pluck
[1:20:25] them out of my father's hands so not
[1:20:27] even you true not even
[1:20:31] you
[1:20:36] amen it doesn't make the same
[1:20:39] Christian if you believe you had you had
[1:20:43] something to do with it out of your own
[1:20:46] choosing or it's all on God it doesn't
[1:20:50] have the same walk
[1:20:57] so the prophet is saying here many of
[1:21:00] the question well will the bride will
[1:21:02] this the church you can't divide what
[1:21:05] they are and that was a problem before
[1:21:08] the opening of the word the church and
[1:21:10] the bride it was a mystery the
[1:21:12] revelation of the seal is also the
[1:21:14] revelation of the Bride it's not just
[1:21:15] the coming of the lord it's the coming
[1:21:17] of the Bride so when the bride is
[1:21:20] revealed now we understand that one
[1:21:22] group is based on choice but the other
[1:21:24] one is based on God's choice but before
[1:21:27] that it was a blurry thing but when the
[1:21:29] book of redemption opens suddenly the
[1:21:32] two groups gets
[1:21:34] clear yes sir
[1:21:36] amen and so this is why he's saying you
[1:21:39] can't divide what they
[1:21:41] are but now we can and we should be able
[1:21:45] to do it and it's important to be able
[1:21:46] to do it he says the bride is the
[1:21:49] elected of God but the church goes
[1:21:53] through can you finish the sentence
[1:21:56] tribulation all right we know we know it
[1:21:59] doesn't finish the sentence we
[1:22:01] understand so the church goes to the
[1:22:02] tribulation that's the one it says
[1:22:05] whosoever
[1:22:07] will let them come but the bride is the
[1:22:11] elected of God so you got your two
[1:22:14] groups
[1:22:15] here that's your two groups the first is
[1:22:19] the elected of God but the other who who
[1:22:22] whosoever will wants to come they can
[1:22:27] come they're going to come upon their
[1:22:30] choice of God God knew before the
[1:22:32] foundation of the world they would make
[1:22:34] that choice that's why he made room for
[1:22:37] them but they are not the
[1:22:40] elected because the elected it's not
[1:22:43] that they chose him it's that they come
[1:22:46] from
[1:22:47] him my children they didn't choose me
[1:22:52] they come from me like are not they are
[1:22:55] my
[1:23:01] children the prophet says you never
[1:23:05] chose God God chose
[1:23:09] you Jesus says no man can come to me
[1:23:12] except my father's draws in first so
[1:23:14] many people say oh I sought God I sought
[1:23:16] God that's a mistake you don't seek God
[1:23:20] God seeks you
[1:23:26] well you're going to say what's the
[1:23:28] difference the difference is Big because
[1:23:33] if your old Christianity is based on
[1:23:37] praise the Lord God's before the
[1:23:39] foundation saw of the world saw me
[1:23:42] making the right choice then praise the
[1:23:44] Lord I made the right choice and now I'm
[1:23:46] blessed and I got the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:48] you're all good but what if when you
[1:23:49] start
[1:23:51] struggling and you're in a valley and
[1:23:53] suddenly Satan comes to your mind he
[1:23:55] says well God for knowledge saw you
[1:23:58] making the right choice but what if
[1:24:00] you're are now making the wrong
[1:24:03] choice did God see you making the wrong
[1:24:08] choice and it Bas it it it it the
[1:24:11] problem with that concept is that it all
[1:24:14] based this on your
[1:24:19] choice everything is based on your
[1:24:21] choice and then you're always nervous
[1:24:24] Lord am I am am I doing the wrong thing
[1:24:26] am I doing the right thing Lord did you
[1:24:28] see me doing this this or this that and
[1:24:31] and it's and and everything it it brings
[1:24:33] all the focus on your
[1:24:36] behavior because you now realize that
[1:24:38] because you made the right choice you're
[1:24:40] elected but what if I make the wrong
[1:24:42] choice so by my choice I'm in but by my
[1:24:45] choice I can be out and it changed the
[1:24:48] way you raise your children too because
[1:24:50] now you put a lot of pressure on them
[1:24:52] for them to make the right choice hoping
[1:24:54] that God foreseen that they would make
[1:24:56] the right choice and you're always like
[1:24:58] no no don't make the wrong choice no no
[1:24:59] no no cuz you want them to be so
[1:25:01] Christian you want them to be so you
[1:25:04] want them to be elected so bad you put
[1:25:06] all that pressure on them because your
[1:25:08] Christianity is based on your
[1:25:11] choice and I'm not saying that Orchid
[1:25:13] should not make the the the good choice
[1:25:15] I'm talking about the pressure like we
[1:25:18] had something to do in
[1:25:21] that and I call this it's a back ground
[1:25:25] noise and it's something that's part of
[1:25:27] your spiritual fabric it's something and
[1:25:29] maybe in preaching it the reason why I'm
[1:25:32] preaching is to bring it to the
[1:25:36] surface right that's why so many people
[1:25:39] are are Christian but they are nervous
[1:25:43] Christians because they always afraid of
[1:25:45] doing the wrong thing because if making
[1:25:48] the right choice qualified you it means
[1:25:51] then the making the wrong choice
[1:25:53] disqualified
[1:25:55] you and in that Circle you can never
[1:25:58] become mature because one day you're
[1:26:01] sons of God but the next day you're
[1:26:03] doubting because you're
[1:26:04] saying what if I get discouraged you
[1:26:07] know at first when we become Christian
[1:26:09] we're full of zeal full of power we're
[1:26:10] all excited it's all good but then you
[1:26:13] know the test of time comes and trials
[1:26:16] and and fatigue and sometime we lose
[1:26:19] some lose the Zeal and that God renew it
[1:26:22] to us but when we're in a valley and we
[1:26:24] L the Zeal and we're like Lord I don't
[1:26:26] know if I can carry through this I don't
[1:26:29] know I don't have the strength to make
[1:26:31] the next step and if everything is based
[1:26:34] on me and my strength and my Zeal well
[1:26:37] it's good when you have strength and you
[1:26:39] have Zeal but if you've been around long
[1:26:42] enough you we had deep valleys when we
[1:26:46] we we we lost our strength and and our
[1:26:49] Zeal and we got discourage and and it's
[1:26:52] in these valleys that you have to know
[1:26:54] oh God you've chosen me and what you've
[1:26:57] started you will finish it and that's
[1:27:00] how you can find strength in the in the
[1:27:02] valley knowing it's not your choice it's
[1:27:05] God's choice and if God started
[1:27:08] something in my life he will finish
[1:27:10] because that's his plan not my
[1:27:19] plan if your predestination is based on
[1:27:22] your choice it means this was based on
[1:27:25] your
[1:27:26] works but that's not what the Bible says
[1:27:30] because the Bible says for the children
[1:27:31] being not yet born neither having done
[1:27:33] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:27:36] according to the election might stand
[1:27:38] not of Works a choice is a
[1:27:44] deed not of works but of him that
[1:27:48] calleth so then it is not of him that
[1:27:51] willth so saying that we are
[1:27:53] predestinated by choice means that it
[1:27:57] was based on our will but the Bible says
[1:28:00] that it's not based on our will or the
[1:28:02] one who runneth but it's God that
[1:28:04] showeth
[1:28:06] mercy so it will bring us then to the
[1:28:09] question what makes us then how did how
[1:28:13] did we become a Christian then the
[1:28:15] answer is going to come later on in the
[1:28:17] service the prophet answers those things
[1:28:24] so there was a change in the teaching of
[1:28:27] the prophet and and sometime ministers
[1:28:29] are afraid to say that because there's
[1:28:31] going to be a backlash and then they're
[1:28:32] going to be told you know oh this
[1:28:34] Minister don't believe the message don't
[1:28:36] I've been excommunicated many time
[1:28:38] anyway so it doesn't change the truth is
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:43] truth and when when we shy away of
[1:28:46] exposing and telling the truth for what
[1:28:48] it is and trying to save a reputation of
[1:28:51] what people's going to say it means that
[1:28:54] I'm in bondage bondage to try to save my
[1:28:57] reputation if I stay in bondage you stay
[1:29:00] in bondage
[1:29:02] amen so this is how the prophet taught
[1:29:05] it before the seal he taught
[1:29:07] predestination on for
[1:29:09] knowledge he did it why because there
[1:29:12] was a blur because we could we were not
[1:29:15] able to divide the church and the bride
[1:29:18] but when the book of redemption opened
[1:29:20] it was the Revelation not only of Jesus
[1:29:22] Christ it was the revelation of misses
[1:29:24] Jesus
[1:29:26] Christ where we could say she is
[1:29:30] him God so that's how he taught it
[1:29:33] before in the message adoption the whole
[1:29:36] Ser adoption series is based on that
[1:29:39] premises so you got to read it with the
[1:29:42] eyes and some people go too far some
[1:29:45] people even go to say well everything
[1:29:46] before 63 is rubbish you got to try in
[1:29:49] the garbage no no no no no no there's a
[1:29:51] lot of good thing about the grace the
[1:29:53] Hebrew the sovereignty of the church
[1:29:55] many many good thing the grace of God
[1:29:57] Calvary there's a lot of good things you
[1:30:00] know you don't throw in the garbage but
[1:30:01] you got to read the book until the end
[1:30:04] with the revelation of the open book and
[1:30:06] then after that you can read with
[1:30:10] understanding yes and that is the
[1:30:13] problem we have in our ranks is that
[1:30:16] it's that it's sometime it's stop that
[1:30:18] all you have to do is believe the
[1:30:21] prophet now you got to understand you
[1:30:24] got to have the revelation of what he
[1:30:26] was saying cuz unless you have the
[1:30:28] Revelation you'll be like this uh Enuk
[1:30:31] that wanted to be baptized that was
[1:30:33] reading the book of Isaiah and Philip
[1:30:34] came he had the book of the prophet in
[1:30:37] his hand he's like who is he talking
[1:30:40] about having a book of the prophet in
[1:30:42] your hand is not enough you need the
[1:30:45] spirit of the
[1:30:47] Revelation was the prophet talking about
[1:30:49] himself or talking about another one and
[1:30:51] Philip jumps on board and and give him
[1:30:53] the revelation of the opening of the
[1:30:55] book no William Bram is not talking
[1:30:57] about himself he's talking about a
[1:31:01] bride
[1:31:03] Hallelujah brother fendler believe the
[1:31:07] message he was trying to convert his
[1:31:09] wife to the
[1:31:11] message his wife didn't believe the
[1:31:13] message so every time he come back from
[1:31:14] church his wife was little brother
[1:31:16] fendler took his wife and and hold her
[1:31:18] really tight and he said I cast The
[1:31:20] Devil out of her and I cast The Devil
[1:31:22] out of her because she didn't believe
[1:31:23] the message
[1:31:24] and when he told that to the prophet
[1:31:26] Prophet is like well okay I mean all
[1:31:29] right well he says brother Brenham I'm
[1:31:31] doing what I what you're doing so he was
[1:31:34] following a prophet believing every word
[1:31:36] the prophet was saying doing what the
[1:31:38] prophet was saying but I'm the question
[1:31:40] I'm asking you how long can a wife can
[1:31:42] endure a man that comes back from church
[1:31:45] and hold you real tight and cast a devil
[1:31:47] de demons out of you he would have run
[1:31:50] his marriage to the ground trying to do
[1:31:53] what the Propet did why because he
[1:31:55] didn't have the revelation of what he
[1:31:57] was
[1:31:58] doing Prophet says no God go buy her a
[1:32:02] box of chocolate or candy says winner by
[1:32:04] love and so he was trying to apply the
[1:32:07] message but he didn't know what the
[1:32:08] message
[1:32:12] was so the prophet is teaching here on
[1:32:16] forn knowledge he says when did God
[1:32:18] choose us that's before the seals when
[1:32:21] did God choose you that got the Holy
[1:32:23] Ghost when did he chose you before the
[1:32:25] foundation of the world by his fore
[1:32:27] knowledge he know that you and know that
[1:32:29] you would love him so that you would
[1:32:31] make the right choice father and mother
[1:32:33] all my whole family Sinners I was a
[1:32:35] cockle bird but all of a sudden I become
[1:32:39] a wheat grain now it's really important
[1:32:40] that you remember that because in the
[1:32:42] seven Church age book The Prophet says
[1:32:45] there is you always been a seed and
[1:32:48] there is no change of species
[1:32:54] that's really important the opening of
[1:32:56] the world re word revealed that but
[1:32:58] before the opening of the word the
[1:33:00] prophet was teaching that you would
[1:33:01] there was a change of
[1:33:04] species but the opening of the word
[1:33:07] changed that that's why the prophet says
[1:33:09] I have a new Bible I'm on a different
[1:33:12] standpoint now I'm not preaching it from
[1:33:15] an old
[1:33:16] context oh
[1:33:19] my and then and when when we we don't
[1:33:22] show these things the because because
[1:33:24] we'll be called uh well he says the
[1:33:27] prophet contradicts himself he doesn't
[1:33:29] believe everything the prophet says with
[1:33:31] thus said the Lord and all those things
[1:33:33] and and it it it becomes a
[1:33:35] scarecrow and we're not able to dive in
[1:33:38] the word and understand the process and
[1:33:40] the change in
[1:33:43] 63 and when we don't do that people read
[1:33:46] this and then they read the church age
[1:33:48] book and they're all they're
[1:33:52] confused to the point that some people
[1:33:54] don't believe the seven Church age was
[1:33:56] written by the prophet they say no that
[1:33:59] was brother lille's Doctrine when the
[1:34:01] prophet was preaching under the
[1:34:02] anointing this is what he said and it
[1:34:05] brings even greater
[1:34:06] confusion but stay with me don't quit
[1:34:10] we're going to run it through quotes and
[1:34:11] you're going to see most of the quote
[1:34:13] I'm going to read tonight is
[1:34:15] 65 because something happened even a
[1:34:18] greater understanding because even after
[1:34:20] the seal the prophets started to dive
[1:34:23] deeper and deeper deeper into the word
[1:34:25] uncovering amazing thing for our benefit
[1:34:29] for us not to be confused
[1:34:33] anymore so here he was teaching a change
[1:34:36] of species how did it happen that was
[1:34:38] election God before the foundation the
[1:34:40] world elected that cockle bird had to
[1:34:42] become a grain of wheat by Fall
[1:34:44] knowledge he see that I would love him
[1:34:46] so he made appropriation to his son got
[1:34:48] taught through him I might become from a
[1:34:50] Cocker bird to a grain of wheat now
[1:34:53] where I am at now etc
[1:34:55] etc
[1:34:58] now when you talk about it's based on
[1:35:03] Origin we are like
[1:35:06] Jesus because Jesus says I come from the
[1:35:10] father and I come into the world and
[1:35:12] again I leave the world and I go to the
[1:35:15] father so Jesus would return to his
[1:35:19] origin
[1:35:21] amen and even though we're not Jesus we
[1:35:24] come from the same
[1:35:26] place we were in him and we are
[1:35:30] returning in him and the only thing and
[1:35:33] I'm going to give you some of the answer
[1:35:34] in advance so you don't I don't lose
[1:35:36] some of
[1:35:38] you the only thing we can do on
[1:35:41] Earth is to
[1:35:45] accept when God revealed to
[1:35:48] you before the foundation of the world
[1:35:51] you were in
[1:35:52] me you bu by past your theophany so you
[1:35:55] didn't have you didn't have the
[1:35:56] knowledge of all that but now I'm
[1:35:59] revealing to you who you
[1:36:02] are it's like the prodigal
[1:36:05] son why did he go back there because he
[1:36:09] came from
[1:36:11] there amen that's the only way to return
[1:36:16] to redeem is to bring back so if you are
[1:36:20] brought back as you were there to start
[1:36:22] with
[1:36:25] and when we dive into this thing
[1:36:26] everything makes
[1:36:28] sense
[1:36:31] amen the prophet says at the very start
[1:36:34] of our study let it be known that there
[1:36:37] is not one scripture that teaches that
[1:36:39] God is presently compiling a record of
[1:36:41] names this was all done before the
[1:36:43] foundation of the
[1:36:45] world as we will point out shortly so
[1:36:48] you know the the traditional Baptist
[1:36:50] view maybe is is is is when you lay down
[1:36:53] at your alar and you gave your life to
[1:36:54] the Lord God is looking as Oh Brother
[1:36:56] Steve giving his life to the Lord praise
[1:36:58] the Lord I'm going to write his name in
[1:37:00] the
[1:37:00] books no it's actually a contrary
[1:37:05] because your name is in the book you
[1:37:07] came to the altar
[1:37:13] Hallelujah also it is not a question of
[1:37:17] assembling involving oursel with two
[1:37:19] group of people both of whom had the
[1:37:21] opportunity to receive eternal life
[1:37:23] wherein one group receive it and had
[1:37:25] their names placed on record while the
[1:37:27] other who refused it did not have their
[1:37:29] name so placed we will actually show by
[1:37:31] scripture that multitudes who were not
[1:37:34] even born again will go into eternal
[1:37:39] life they don't have eternal life but
[1:37:43] they enter into there's a Nuance
[1:37:47] there as strange as it may sound it is
[1:37:49] certainly true we will also show that
[1:37:52] there's a group of people who name
[1:37:53] having been placed on that record before
[1:37:55] the foundation of the world cannot under
[1:37:59] any
[1:38:01] circumstances have those names
[1:38:05] removed under no
[1:38:10] circumstances
[1:38:12] depression a fall a mistake several
[1:38:16] mistake you went through a divorce your
[1:38:19] life was erect talk about Saul I believe
[1:38:22] and and when the pro Propet you know
[1:38:24] it's only because we receive a prophet
[1:38:26] that we believe Saul what was what was
[1:38:28] Samuel at the end because we all send
[1:38:31] Saul into hell did
[1:38:35] we but but sometime people are afraid to
[1:38:37] teach that because they say if we teach
[1:38:40] that then people were going to go on
[1:38:42] rampage they're going to lose up and say
[1:38:44] well it doesn't matter if I was there I
[1:38:46] was there and if I not I not no no no
[1:38:49] that's not it one thing is really
[1:38:51] important Saul made so many bad choices
[1:38:56] based on his complex or rejection that
[1:38:59] he ruined his ministry his family his
[1:39:02] reput he ruined everything and he died
[1:39:05] in
[1:39:06] shame but he was on the other side
[1:39:08] because Samuel told him tomorrow you
[1:39:10] will be with me
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:15] yes but
[1:39:18] second is that God has placed something
[1:39:21] inside of us before the foundation of
[1:39:23] the world and we're going to dive into
[1:39:26] this
[1:39:27] shortly
[1:39:30] that creates something inside of our
[1:39:34] heart that people out there doesn't
[1:39:41] have and one of the theme quote and
[1:39:44] we're going to read it tomorrow or or
[1:39:45] Sunday morning but it's really
[1:39:48] important he says I'm only saying this
[1:39:51] not to mix up Doctrine but to strengthen
[1:39:54] out that we might get away from this
[1:39:57] fear and
[1:39:59] scare you don't know who you are
[1:40:04] remember our theme is spiritual growth
[1:40:06] but to be able to grow we have to stop
[1:40:10] questioning our
[1:40:12] status we got to settle the question
[1:40:16] once and for all I am a Son of God and
[1:40:19] then you're going to say but what if I
[1:40:20] am not am that's not a problem
[1:40:25] do I have a proof brother Steve BR does
[1:40:27] I me personally have a proof that my
[1:40:31] name is in the
[1:40:32] book
[1:40:34] no no not at all I cannot prove that to
[1:40:37] myself or to you but there can testify
[1:40:41] there's something in my heart which I
[1:40:43] believe that God has chosen
[1:40:46] me and once that is revealed to me it
[1:40:48] settled the question when I'm in a
[1:40:50] valley or I do a mistake or I make bad
[1:40:52] choice
[1:40:53] I don't go back and rip off my Christian
[1:40:56] experience because it's not based on my
[1:40:59] choice it's based on God's choice and I
[1:41:02] cannot be lost under any any
[1:41:09] circumstances so the prophet says the
[1:41:12] scare and the fear is you don't know who
[1:41:16] you
[1:41:18] are you are not going to be but now you
[1:41:22] are the sons of God you always were the
[1:41:26] sons of God
[1:41:29] 65 for when God had you and his thinking
[1:41:32] at the beginning you have to be some
[1:41:34] part of you your life that's in you now
[1:41:37] had to be with God before there and well
[1:41:41] when he before even become material here
[1:41:43] on here on Earth before there was
[1:41:45] anything but God you were one with his
[1:41:49] hat with his attributes he knowed what
[1:41:51] your name would be he know the color of
[1:41:53] your hair you would have you know all
[1:41:55] about you the only thing happened is
[1:41:57] when you being a sinner so the big
[1:41:59] difference between us and Jesus is that
[1:42:02] we bypass our theophany Jesus went
[1:42:05] straight the Bible prophets teaches that
[1:42:07] Jesus became the
[1:42:09] word and then he became
[1:42:13] flesh us we became flesh that's right
[1:42:18] and then after that we became word but
[1:42:21] during that time that we were only flesh
[1:42:23] we were like what's life supposed to be
[1:42:27] we were behaving like the rest of the
[1:42:28] world we were behaving like our parents
[1:42:30] if they were not Christian we were just
[1:42:32] having no clue but what's supposed to
[1:42:35] happen is when we become word it's
[1:42:37] supposed to settle the question we're
[1:42:39] not in our flesh anymore we are becoming
[1:42:42] the word and now we started to know who
[1:42:45] we are like Jesus knew who he
[1:42:48] was amen
[1:42:53] amen and now the next thing that's
[1:42:56] really important that happened in 65 is
[1:42:58] the word
[1:43:00] c you don't find that before that why
[1:43:05] because it's something that God gave his
[1:43:08] prophet and that c Gene teaching changes
[1:43:15] everything whatever you read after that
[1:43:18] you have to remember that
[1:43:26] let's read
[1:43:28] it so we're laying a foundation to go
[1:43:31] it's tonight is just a foundation we
[1:43:33] want to have a solid ground because we
[1:43:36] want to move forward we want to be able
[1:43:38] to understand the importance of maturity
[1:43:41] that's right but when we feel like we
[1:43:43] have to be born again every service we
[1:43:45] stay a
[1:43:47] baby if I don't know who I am I I had a
[1:43:50] bad week and I come back I don't even
[1:43:52] know like should I go to church or not
[1:43:54] like I had such a bad week I don't even
[1:43:56] know if I'm a Christian I don't even
[1:43:57] know my sons of God maybe I'm talking
[1:43:59] for one person here tonight that keeps
[1:44:02] ripping his his Christian Life week
[1:44:04] after week because you are all based on
[1:44:07] your behavior right there is days I feel
[1:44:10] like a
[1:44:12] Christian there is days man I get up I
[1:44:16] feel like reading my Bible and I pray
[1:44:18] and then I I have a smile and it's like
[1:44:21] praise the Lord I feel it in my
[1:44:24] body but there are days sorry to
[1:44:26] disappoint
[1:44:29] you I don't
[1:44:32] know like there's days I feel like
[1:44:34] reading my my Bible there's other days
[1:44:36] I'm I'm stressed I got so much to do and
[1:44:38] I'm like I got to do it and I'm supposed
[1:44:41] to feel like it but I don't feel like it
[1:44:43] and maybe I what if I don't do
[1:44:46] it and you're half gone today your day
[1:44:48] doesn't go well and then you're like
[1:44:49] well I didn't put the Lord in the first
[1:44:51] place and and and but but when you go
[1:44:53] through
[1:44:55] that and that your whole experience is
[1:44:57] based on your
[1:44:59] behavior then you don't feel like a
[1:45:01] Christian so maybe I'm
[1:45:04] not and then with that thought the ne
[1:45:06] the next day is worse and the third day
[1:45:09] is worse and then church time comes it's
[1:45:11] like I'm not even going it's not worth
[1:45:13] me going there
[1:45:15] like like I didn't even read my Bible
[1:45:18] this week I'm going to go to church and
[1:45:19] pretend I'm a Christian forget it
[1:45:23] you got people who go on a roller
[1:45:24] coaster like that and you know why they
[1:45:26] bring they go on a roller coaster
[1:45:28] because when they go to church what they
[1:45:31] present to God is their
[1:45:34] behavior but you know when you approach
[1:45:36] God the only thing you're allowed to
[1:45:37] bring is the is the
[1:45:39] Lamb is the lamb and when the the even
[1:45:43] the the high priest when he received the
[1:45:45] worshipper he was inspecting the lamb
[1:45:48] not the worshipper do you know
[1:45:51] that that's in the Bible the lamb would
[1:45:54] get inspected he didn't look at the
[1:45:56] sinner he's no good anyway forget it I'm
[1:45:59] not looking at the sinner if he's here
[1:46:01] with a lamb he's not good for anything
[1:46:02] so show me your lamb all right not
[1:46:05] crooked eyes all right he's good right
[1:46:10] four legs all
[1:46:12] right your lamb is perfect you can come
[1:46:15] in the house of the Lord and you can
[1:46:19] worship and the proof that a lot of us
[1:46:22] and you know what when the lamb was
[1:46:25] presented you something and sometime we
[1:46:28] put a lot of focus on the lamb and the
[1:46:29] blood it's really important but we
[1:46:30] forget the other step and the other step
[1:46:33] is the fire was coming down the fire was
[1:46:36] coming down when Abel offered sacrifice
[1:46:40] the Bible says God was pleased and
[1:46:42] accepted his sacrifice how did Cain see
[1:46:44] that is was refused and and Abel was
[1:46:47] accepted it's because fire came down on
[1:46:50] his Elijah when when he brought that Big
[1:46:53] Challenge fire came down on is all this
[1:46:56] when God answered to your worship if you
[1:46:59] worship the right way he will answer by
[1:47:03] fire even in the Bible you have David
[1:47:05] David offer sacrifice Bible says God
[1:47:08] honored David's sacrifice or offering by
[1:47:14] fire but if we present something else
[1:47:18] there's no
[1:47:20] fire and the proof that a lot of us when
[1:47:22] we go to church and we worship we are
[1:47:26] excited to go to church when our
[1:47:27] behavior is good because actually
[1:47:30] subconsciously this is what we present
[1:47:32] to God oh praise the Lord I read my
[1:47:35] Bible and I listened to a message and I
[1:47:37] prayed so much and I feel good and now I
[1:47:40] can worship because this is what I
[1:47:42] present to God I presented my good
[1:47:46] choice my good choices and my good
[1:47:49] behavior and I and I did the right
[1:47:51] choice and I did the right thing thing
[1:47:53] and and then we go back to this quote
[1:47:55] that we misunderstand when God told
[1:47:59] William brandham because had thou has
[1:48:01] made the right
[1:48:03] choice and then we think that choice
[1:48:06] gave him eternal life that's not it that
[1:48:10] choices gave him a greater reward a
[1:48:13] reward and eternal life is two separate
[1:48:16] things by your choices and your behavior
[1:48:19] there's a greater reward
[1:48:23] but eternal life is not based on
[1:48:25] Behavior it's based on elect
[1:48:30] predestination Saul probably lost all
[1:48:33] his
[1:48:34] rewards because he ruined his family he
[1:48:37] ruined his ministry he brought Israel to
[1:48:39] shame he persecuted and elected of God
[1:48:42] anointed by God he done so many things
[1:48:44] probably he went on the other side he
[1:48:46] had eternal life but his reward he lost
[1:48:49] because rewards is based on Behavior
[1:48:53] but not eternal
[1:48:55] life are you with
[1:49:00] me Hallelujah so next time you don't
[1:49:03] feel like coming to church it's a day to
[1:49:06] remind you all right God praise the Lord
[1:49:08] I'm going to bring my lamb who's your
[1:49:11] lamb Jesus Christ is your lamb he's
[1:49:15] perfect he didn't fail the inspection
[1:49:18] Glory if you present him he is worthy I
[1:49:22] am not worthy I'm not even worthy to
[1:49:24] stand in front of you and preach tonight
[1:49:26] if it was based on my behavior I would
[1:49:28] not be standing here neither you but me
[1:49:31] and you are standing on the same ground
[1:49:33] we are standing on Grace only
[1:49:37] Grace
[1:49:38] Hallelujah
[1:49:40] Glory hallelujah
[1:49:43] amen I'm just preparing the sermon a
[1:49:45] Sunday morning are you perfect
[1:49:48] ouch are you perfect we're going to
[1:49:51] study that we're going to have good
[1:49:53] times together
[1:49:56] amen what time is
[1:49:58] it probably 3:00 in the morning in
[1:50:01] Quebec 4:00 I don't
[1:50:03] know I'm already past bedtime
[1:50:12] anyway there's two points I want to talk
[1:50:15] and then I'm I'm going to
[1:50:18] close C
[1:50:20] genene and what is eternal life
[1:50:25] and the purpose the purpose behind this
[1:50:27] teaching tonight is to establish every
[1:50:30] one of you on a more solid
[1:50:32] ground if you're grounded in your
[1:50:35] behavior your Christian life will be
[1:50:37] like
[1:50:39] this up and
[1:50:50] down Prophet says many of you can
[1:50:53] fellowship with me on this thought when
[1:50:55] you a little boy little girl you walk
[1:50:56] around here there would be certain
[1:50:58] things that would just it would bother
[1:51:00] it wouldn't bother the other kids it
[1:51:01] seems like there was something in you
[1:51:03] that cried out there was God somewhere
[1:51:05] yet you were a sinner remember that
[1:51:07] certainly now what was that there was a
[1:51:09] little form of life in you
[1:51:13] then and after a while you heard the
[1:51:16] gospel maybe you went to church you
[1:51:17] picked out this and that and went from
[1:51:19] denomination to denomination and then
[1:51:20] one day you being part of God you had to
[1:51:22] be part of the word but when you heard
[1:51:25] the word you know where you come from
[1:51:27] you know what was the truth like Jesus
[1:51:31] he knew who he was because he he was
[1:51:33] word and then flesh but we were flesh
[1:51:37] ignorant and when we heard the word we
[1:51:40] know where you
[1:51:43] come
[1:51:48] from if God reveal you tonight where you
[1:51:52] come from
[1:51:53] from it settles the question forever yes
[1:51:57] sir
[1:51:59] am life's going to be life there going
[1:52:02] to be
[1:52:03] trials but you won't be unrooted from
[1:52:06] your origin cuz nothing can separate you
[1:52:09] from the love of God
[1:52:13] nothing
[1:52:15] amen you were always the seed was in you
[1:52:21] always amen the word seen the word that
[1:52:24] was in you that was before the
[1:52:26] foundation of the world saw the word
[1:52:28] that you come to
[1:52:31] it and I want you to notice this is 65
[1:52:35] you're going to heard about hear about s
[1:52:37] Cene 65 and then the church age book is
[1:52:40] is wrote with that
[1:52:43] Revelation that's why there there's
[1:52:45] people around our ranks that refuse the
[1:52:48] seven Church age book and it's it's it's
[1:52:51] um
[1:52:53] it's
[1:52:54] sad when I hear that there's a minister
[1:52:56] who doesn't accept the seven Church age
[1:52:58] book he believes William Brenham but he
[1:53:01] refused Church age book for me it kind
[1:53:04] of revealed that he recognized a prophet
[1:53:08] it's okay recognize a prophet but he
[1:53:10] didn't recognize the opening of the word
[1:53:13] the coming down of Christ R re revealing
[1:53:17] himself it changed everything amen
[1:53:24] and so we found out that God does that
[1:53:27] in every age God does his own
[1:53:30] choosing by his own predestinated choose
[1:53:34] choosing chooses prophets and things for
[1:53:36] the ages fixes nature to men's nature
[1:53:39] the men's style of preaching the honor
[1:53:41] his gift and all that he does is to meet
[1:53:43] the challenge of that day God creates
[1:53:45] that man and sent him and in his own
[1:53:48] mind as I preached on last night we are
[1:53:50] a germ of the gene of God
[1:53:53] he know that men would be there at that
[1:53:55] age before there was even ever a
[1:53:58] molecule or a light or anything else in
[1:53:59] the Earth for you're a gene of your
[1:54:01] father and you were in your father yet
[1:54:04] your father had no fellowship with you
[1:54:06] because you was in there you but you
[1:54:08] knew it
[1:54:09] not and who is this me mesc the prophet
[1:54:12] explained
[1:54:14] about the
[1:54:16] theophany and you knew it not but you
[1:54:19] was manifested that you might have
[1:54:21] fellowship with you but you being born
[1:54:25] again you're born of eternal life but
[1:54:29] you knew it not and I pray that somebody
[1:54:32] tonight
[1:54:33] can stand up at the end of the service
[1:54:36] and say finally I
[1:54:39] know because sometime we are stuck with
[1:54:42] the old context and the new one and we
[1:54:45] go we read the seven CH book we're all
[1:54:48] blessed praise the Lord how was God has
[1:54:50] chosen me before the I come to God and I
[1:54:53] come from God I go back to God and then
[1:54:54] we go back to before and we realize that
[1:54:57] and and it brings confusion cuz once
[1:54:59] it's it's based on our Behavior and the
[1:55:01] other one is based on God's
[1:55:05] choice but God doesn't want us to be
[1:55:08] confused then if you are Son of God or
[1:55:11] daughter of God you were in God all the
[1:55:14] time but in knew what bed in time that
[1:55:17] you'd be planted so now you're made a
[1:55:19] creature and a son of God manifested son
[1:55:21] or daughter of God to meet the challenge
[1:55:23] of this hour to vindicate the true and
[1:55:25] living God for this hour if you wasn't
[1:55:29] chose that
[1:55:31] way chose what with the c genene if you
[1:55:35] wasn't chose that way no matter how much
[1:55:38] you try to impersonate it you'll never
[1:55:41] make
[1:55:50] it I got to skip some to save
[1:55:56] time we did not become
[1:55:59] seed by the
[1:56:01] rebirth we were seed and therefore we
[1:56:05] were reborn for only the elect can be
[1:56:10] reborn because we were seed is the
[1:56:13] reason we could be quickened in none
[1:56:16] seed there is nothing to Quicken that's
[1:56:19] true so when you're tall if you do this
[1:56:22] you're going to miss the Rapture
[1:56:26] really how many time we've
[1:56:29] heard threaten God's
[1:56:32] people that based on the be their
[1:56:34] behavior they're going to miss the
[1:56:36] Rapture don't never let a
[1:56:39] minister threaten
[1:56:44] you that you going to miss the Rapture
[1:56:47] based on your
[1:56:49] behavior because if you're a seed that
[1:56:53] seed will be quickened well what if what
[1:56:56] if a Son of God is making bad choices
[1:56:58] well if he's a Son of God he'll get
[1:56:59] he'll get his fanking maybe Bible says
[1:57:02] God rebukes his own
[1:57:04] children but he will not remove you kick
[1:57:08] you
[1:57:09] away thank you Lord
[1:57:13] amen and it's the difference between a
[1:57:16] church that's Grace based or performance
[1:57:23] base and it's really easy you don't have
[1:57:26] to listen for a long time to see if
[1:57:29] you're sitting under a ministry that's
[1:57:30] Performance Based because you feel the
[1:57:34] pressure that's on the people to
[1:57:37] straight up to line up to be better
[1:57:40] because this is the end of time it's not
[1:57:41] time to play game anymore and and and
[1:57:44] understand that it's serious we better
[1:57:45] line up understand all this but if at
[1:57:47] the end I'm threatening you that you
[1:57:50] will miss the rapture
[1:57:52] as we now read since the opening of the
[1:57:55] word the prophet says under any no
[1:57:59] circumstances you can miss
[1:58:02] it brother you're making way too
[1:58:07] safe you're making it way too secure
[1:58:11] people are going to loose up and they're
[1:58:12] going to become worldly well if they
[1:58:14] become worldly and they go back in the
[1:58:16] world because of that it means that
[1:58:19] there's nothing
[1:58:20] inside it's not me that keeps the people
[1:58:23] in line it's the life that's in
[1:58:29] you we're going to see tomorrow that the
[1:58:32] law has never brought no one to
[1:58:36] maturity and rules and the church
[1:58:38] doesn't bring people to maturity I
[1:58:41] understand it should be order and not
[1:58:42] chaos but I'm talking about when we try
[1:58:45] to make people Rapture Ready by adding
[1:58:47] up so many
[1:58:50] rules we're missing the point and it's a
[1:58:53] proof that we don't have faith in the
[1:58:56] seed of God we don't have faith that God
[1:58:59] has called you it's not the church who
[1:59:02] call you like in the serious gender
[1:59:04] confusion it's not the woman who's
[1:59:05] called you it's the father who called
[1:59:09] you and whatever he started he will
[1:59:12] finish
[1:59:13] it thank you
[1:59:15] Lord thank
[1:59:20] youus the B baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:24] nothing else than that
[1:59:27] seed that's
[1:59:29] Quicken that seed who is
[1:59:33] Quicken is that experience that brings
[1:59:37] you from Darkness to
[1:59:39] light amen let's move on I got to finish
[1:59:43] we got many more services ahead of
[1:59:46] us all this carefully in mind now take
[1:59:49] the next step redeem means to buy back
[1:59:52] back it restores through the original
[1:59:55] own God by his death shed blood brought
[1:59:59] back his own he brought back the spoken
[2:00:02] word seed bride my sheep hear my voice
[2:00:05] and they follow me you always were a
[2:00:10] sheep you never were a pig or a dog
[2:00:13] turned into sheep that is impossible for
[2:00:17] every kind of Life produces the same
[2:00:20] kind and there is no change in
[2:00:27] species but why now he's preaching that
[2:00:30] because God Seven Angel Revelation took
[2:00:33] him from the standpoint of the old
[2:00:34] context and brought bring him onto the
[2:00:37] new cont new standpoint of the open book
[2:00:41] why because now the the the the book of
[2:00:44] redemption is open and when it's open
[2:00:47] you hear your name I hear my name when
[2:00:52] you're sitting under a Ministry who
[2:00:54] preaching the open book you hear your
[2:00:56] name and it's not now I'm in because I
[2:00:59] follow the rules or I'm in because I'm
[2:01:01] so good I'm in because I heard my
[2:01:05] name and to hear your name the book
[2:01:08] needed to be
[2:01:11] open
[2:01:14] Hallelujah there is no change of species
[2:01:16] you didn't you were not a cuckle bird to
[2:01:18] turn into
[2:01:20] wheat not a pig turn into sheep not a
[2:01:23] dog turn into sheep cuz it's impossible
[2:01:26] there is no changeing species as we were
[2:01:28] in the thoughts of God and the Express
[2:01:30] in the flesh they had to come a day
[2:01:32] where we would hear his voice the word
[2:01:34] and hearing that voice become aware of a
[2:01:36] father's calling and recognize that we
[2:01:38] are the sons of God
[2:01:40] recognize Hallelujah we hear his voice
[2:01:42] and we cry out as did The Prodigal Son
[2:01:45] save me oh my father I'm returning to
[2:01:49] thee as I said The Prodigal Son could
[2:01:52] return only because that's where he came
[2:01:58] from but a Son of God can take a long
[2:02:03] time before he
[2:02:05] recognizes that he is a
[2:02:07] son he can take a while I invited him to
[2:02:11] church he didn't want to come I gave him
[2:02:12] the test of the word he refused it he's
[2:02:14] serpent seed oh time
[2:02:17] out oh we got sons of God that's
[2:02:20] stubborn
[2:02:22] oh hardheaded they hear the
[2:02:26] word but it's not because they do the
[2:02:29] that something is not going on
[2:02:31] inside that's he just done a a 360
[2:02:35] Flip it's like ah I don't want to hear
[2:02:38] that and and inside like he's like what
[2:02:41] was that well you don't say to no one
[2:02:44] cuz you're full of yourself pride and
[2:02:45] hardheaded but something flipped inside
[2:02:49] that sound was different yes sir right
[2:02:52] it takes some time for a Son of God take
[2:02:54] a long
[2:02:55] time in fact a lot of true Christian are
[2:02:59] like the story of the baby eagle that
[2:03:01] was atch under a hen he know that's the
[2:03:04] eagle is a type of the True Believer so
[2:03:06] you know that story about the eagle it's
[2:03:09] the only way to see
[2:03:12] predestination you were born an
[2:03:14] eagle you ended up with other people
[2:03:18] yeah you didn't know who you were but
[2:03:19] you felt different
[2:03:22] and then when you heard that voice you
[2:03:24] didn't turn from a chicken to an eagle
[2:03:27] because you heard the voice the voice
[2:03:29] doesn't change who you are the The Voice
[2:03:32] reveal who you
[2:03:35] are but Brothers brother Steve we were I
[2:03:39] was living like a pig yeah the flesh
[2:03:42] yeah the flesh absolutely but I'm
[2:03:44] talking about the
[2:03:45] seed and our flesh is going to be
[2:03:48] changed our body is going to be changed
[2:03:49] oh we waiting for that amen
[2:03:52] so I won't read the story about the
[2:03:53] eagle you you know the
[2:04:00] story so once he called screaming he try
[2:04:03] you know he's trying to beat his wing
[2:04:04] cuz the mother's called he says you see
[2:04:06] he always he always was an
[2:04:11] eagle so you have to realize who you
[2:04:16] are and it's exactly scriptural because
[2:04:18] the Bible says Galatians 4 because ye
[2:04:22] are Sons God has sent forth the spirit
[2:04:25] of his sons into your hearts crying AB
[2:04:30] father we don't receive the Holy Ghost
[2:04:33] because a preacher put pressure on
[2:04:37] you you should receive it you should
[2:04:39] receive it if you don't receive you're
[2:04:41] going to miss the Rapture
[2:04:42] you're you don't receive the Holy Ghost
[2:04:45] Under Pressure you receive the Holy
[2:04:49] Ghost
[2:04:52] when the word strikes the
[2:04:56] seed and even sometime when we talk
[2:04:59] about receiving the Holy Ghost there's a
[2:05:02] misunderstand misunderstanding of what
[2:05:04] what it
[2:05:05] is let me finish this and then we're
[2:05:08] going to finish with what is eternal
[2:05:11] life so the prophet is referring to the
[2:05:14] scripture we just read it's really
[2:05:16] important this explains us how it works
[2:05:20] you are first to
[2:05:22] son and then you receive the
[2:05:26] spirit of his son it's only if you're a
[2:05:30] son or daughter of God that you can
[2:05:33] receive
[2:05:34] it and unless we ground our ministry the
[2:05:39] way we preach the way we live unless we
[2:05:42] ground it solidly on that we are
[2:05:44] misleading people
[2:05:52] Prophet says because ye are sons of God
[2:05:54] sent forth a spirit of his son unto your
[2:05:57] hearts whereby you cry AB father upon
[2:05:59] whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost
[2:06:02] Sons at corent upon sons while they
[2:06:07] heard the
[2:06:11] word you put too much pressure on people
[2:06:14] you lock
[2:06:16] them cuz now they become
[2:06:19] afraid what if nothing happens to me on
[2:06:21] Saturday night what if nothing happens
[2:06:24] to me I'm going to special meetings and
[2:06:27] everybody's crying and I didn't feel
[2:06:28] anything and what if I'm missing and and
[2:06:31] sometime we put so much
[2:06:34] faith on the atmosphere which atmosphere
[2:06:37] extremely important we need the
[2:06:40] atmosphere but our Focus has to be on
[2:06:43] receiving the
[2:06:48] word I'm closing with this what is
[2:06:52] eternal
[2:06:54] life we understand eternal life is Zoe
[2:06:58] the life of God himself we understand
[2:06:59] that but when did eternal life enter
[2:07:02] your
[2:07:03] life that's another thing we have to
[2:07:06] understand and keep it clear I don't
[2:07:08] know if you realize but everything I'm
[2:07:10] reading to you is 65 and the church age
[2:07:12] book because that's all when it became
[2:07:17] clear and we have to keep that in our
[2:07:19] mind
[2:07:30] so so we so were you Sons and Daughters
[2:07:34] of God before there even was a Moon Star
[2:07:36] in a molecule you were Sons and
[2:07:38] Daughters of God for you are only the
[2:07:40] physical manifestation of the attribute
[2:07:42] that was in God at the beginning for
[2:07:45] there's only one form of eternal life
[2:07:48] and that was Hallelujah
[2:07:55] you before you don't know nothing about
[2:07:58] it did neither did you know when you was
[2:08:01] in your Earthly father but you are
[2:08:03] manifested too In His Image in the image
[2:08:05] of God you are made and you were
[2:08:07] manifested for the glory and fellowship
[2:08:09] of God and therefore as sure as your
[2:08:12] Gene had to be in your father before
[2:08:13] your natural birth your spiritual Gene
[2:08:16] had to be in God because you're an
[2:08:18] expression of the attributes of his
[2:08:19] thought before the foundation of world
[2:08:22] right no way around it that's right now
[2:08:24] we notice that life being in you God's
[2:08:28] life being in you from the foundation of
[2:08:33] the world so I'm asking you did you
[2:08:35] receive eternal life at the
[2:08:37] altar or eternal life was in you since
[2:08:42] the beginning the foundation of the
[2:08:45] world
[2:08:48] Amen so that's another thing before the
[2:08:52] seal you receive eternal life when you
[2:08:56] receive the Holy
[2:08:58] Ghost after the seal Prophet says life
[2:09:03] eternal life was always in
[2:09:06] you but the difference now the
[2:09:08] experience of the Holy Ghost is the same
[2:09:10] is that that Holy Ghost come and Quicken
[2:09:12] the seed but life was already in it but
[2:09:16] not
[2:09:18] express so we can say well these are
[2:09:20] just you know play on words it's not
[2:09:23] just play on word it's the revelation of
[2:09:25] a true process how God works in our
[2:09:35] life now the only way that you can be a
[2:09:38] son or daughter of God because you have
[2:09:41] to be you have to have eternal life and
[2:09:44] there's only one form of eternal life
[2:09:45] and that's God's life only one form of
[2:09:48] eternal life that was God there to be a
[2:09:50] son of God you had to be in
[2:09:54] him
[2:09:56] always the gene of your life spiritual
[2:09:59] life tonight was in God the Father
[2:10:02] before there was even a molecule see and
[2:10:04] you are nothing but the manifestation of
[2:10:08] the gene of life that was in God as a
[2:10:10] Son of
[2:10:14] God wherever you are God knew that you
[2:10:17] would be here because you have to be one
[2:10:21] of his genes or his attribute you had to
[2:10:24] be if you ever if you've got eternal
[2:10:28] life then it always
[2:10:31] was eternal
[2:10:35] life and God before there was a
[2:10:37] foundation World knew that you would be
[2:10:40] here
[2:10:44] amen prise now you have fellowship with
[2:10:47] your father and God just as you have
[2:10:50] with your Earthly father you are
[2:10:52] citizens of the king not citizens but
[2:10:54] you are children and sons and daughter
[2:10:56] of the Living God if it to be that the
[2:10:58] eternal life dwells in
[2:11:02] you praise the
[2:11:04] Lord so what makes
[2:11:07] us what made us give our life to the
[2:11:11] Lord what did I what what what what was
[2:11:13] my
[2:11:15] choice Prophet explained how it
[2:11:17] works he says the word cannot deny
[2:11:20] itself then it is satisf fire it's the
[2:11:21] desire it's a desire of what what made
[2:11:25] you desire
[2:11:28] it in the first place because down in
[2:11:31] your soul there was a predestinated seed
[2:11:35] which was eternal life always laying
[2:11:40] there always wasn't there all that the
[2:11:44] father has given me will come to me
[2:11:45] there isn't any of them going to be lost
[2:11:48] so the prophet is saying that you you
[2:11:51] chose to give your life to God based out
[2:11:55] a desire of that seed it's the seed that
[2:11:59] make you give your life to God
[2:12:02] Amen so it's all the way around because
[2:12:06] if it was if it was based on for
[2:12:09] knowledge then it
[2:12:11] says the belief is I made the right
[2:12:14] choice so God wrote my name in the book
[2:12:18] but after the seals it's the contrary
[2:12:22] I made the choice because my name was in
[2:12:24] the
[2:12:28] book that's the revelation of the open
[2:12:33] book the book what's the book The Book
[2:12:35] of
[2:12:36] Redemption where everything gets clear
[2:12:39] it's not that I made the right choice
[2:12:41] then then why God put my name in the
[2:12:43] book no my God put my name in the book
[2:12:46] and that seed in me made me desire
[2:13:02] we're always in
[2:13:03] 65 it's that inside Soul That Never Dies
[2:13:07] it's got eternal life it's always was
[2:13:11] eternal life it come from God it's God
[2:13:14] it's it goes to God it's the
[2:13:18] soul Sons and Daughters of God was in
[2:13:20] God God in the beginning now look you've
[2:13:22] got eternal life you say we believe it
[2:13:24] that we got eternal life well there's
[2:13:26] only one form of eternal life and that's
[2:13:28] God that's the only thing that is
[2:13:29] eternal is God then if you've got
[2:13:31] eternal life that life that's in you
[2:13:35] always was so propheus says your soul is
[2:13:40] eternal and that seed in the soul that's
[2:13:44] what brought you to God
[2:13:48] Amen closing with this scripture who
[2:13:51] shall separate us from the love of
[2:13:54] Christ and then he goes on with a big
[2:13:57] list
[2:13:59] tribulation
[2:14:00] distress
[2:14:02] persecution famine nakedness peral
[2:14:07] sword let me add
[2:14:19] you for I'm pers created verse 38 that
[2:14:23] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[2:14:26] principalities nor power nor things nor
[2:14:28] things presence present nor things to
[2:14:31] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[2:14:36] creature shall be able to separate us
[2:14:40] from the love of God which is in Christ

[2:15:11] their behavior but to be established on

[2:15:52] week after every
[2:15:55] fall after a mistake after did I made
[2:15:58] the right choice did that choice
[2:16:00] separated me from God did his presence
