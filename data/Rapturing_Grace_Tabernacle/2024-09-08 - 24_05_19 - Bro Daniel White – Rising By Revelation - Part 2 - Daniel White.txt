here on the on the uh pulpit and I need to do that at home actually but uh praise the lord it's good to be with you um I had a brother walked into a church one time and he said oh he said wow he said it's good to see something good can come out of Australia you know praise the Lord I take that as a compliment the same thing about my Lord can anything good come out of Nazareth oh praise the Lord yes he can amen the Lord bless you tonight why don't we turn in our Bibles uh to the book of uh Revelation uh just want to look at this thought here tonight um Rising by Revelation and we're just not going to look at all those scriptures tonight just for the sake of time we'll just turn to Revelation 5 and then we'll go to Luke chapter 4 Revelation 5 verse verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel proclaimed with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look there on there was a sacredness about this book and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and I beheld and loow in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and of and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the world and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen we know it didn't end there The Taking of the book was just the beginning but um we can only go so far tonight uh let's turn to Luke 4 uh Luke 4:14 we we spoke about this as the Lord was leading us through the the service this morning uh Luke Luke 414 and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit un Galilee and there went out of him Fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the K synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him a book of the Prophet Isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives to and the recovering of the spirit to the blind sight to the blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in this synagogue were fastened on him and he be to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear witness of him and wandered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son Heavenly Father Lord God we just ask a blessing upon the reading of this word Lord and Lord may you impart to us Lord God the things that you desire for this evening we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can take your seats tonight just to um just to one want you to know here that Jesus was able to take the book he was able to take the book he took the book out of the out of the hand of the out of the hand of the minister and he found the place where it was written of him he didn't open the book to find to hoping that God would reveal him but he opened the book in the revelation of who he was amen he he opened the book in the revelation of who he was all right he found the place where it was written of him he couldn't do that unless he was a revelation unto himself which we know that he is so if the New Testament the Old Testament Masterpiece was a revelation unto himself then the New Testament Masterpiece will also be a revelation unto herself and she will be able to pick up the book and open the book and find where it is written of her amen so it's it this is what takes the religious Spirits away when when when we can find when we have the revelation of who we are we don't need to be religious but the reason that we become religious is because we're lacking in Revelation Jesus was not a religious man the Pharisees and the Sadducees were religious people because they didn't have a revelation of who they are everything we need is Revelation absolutely everything that we need is the revelation of this word It's contained in this book so the the transition that we make from being religious to being a revelation is when God opens up his word and then we become a a revelation unto ourself up until then we're just religious right so don't get angry with people who are religious they can't help it it's God that's got to change them the same way that God changed you the same way that God changed me all right because once I was religious once I looked at people but now what God wants is for his bride to be able to pick up the book where he wrote of her the scriptures inspired right the scripture is inspired so God wants us to pick up the book it's been around for a while it's been opened a few times but he wants us to open the book differently he wants us to open the book with the revelation of who we are not searching for the revelation of who we are but we can't do that ourself amen amen I just want to touch on this quote here again the prophet of God says he he was all the prophets made one plus even that so we know who plus even that is plus even that is sitting here tonight amen so it's the New Testament bride amen cuz he was the fullness of the word he was all the word the word of the the prophets was just the word to that age but he was the word to all ages he was God himself coming down and manifested in a body of Flesh amen Revelations 10:7 I'm just skipping through some of these to get to the bit that we we want to get to but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished who's the seventh angel the last Angel the last Angel all right he's the Forerunner he he's the one who's going to introduce the Masterpiece to the Masterpiece cuz it's not a public revealing he's going to introduce the Masterpiece to the Masterpiece he's not going to introduce the Masterpiece to the world no no he's going to introduce the Masterpiece to herself in when in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God the mystery of God Amen the New Testament mystery of God is going to be finished amen praise God Amen so just skipping through here um in this hour we are not seeing the word impartial but we are actually seeing the fullness of the word amen so when we talk about the fullness of the word sometimes these things can be a little bit confusing to us but we're actually seeing the fullness of the word meaning that we're now seeing both bride and groom United together as one they're Inseparable nothing what God ha joined together let no man put us under all right so we're we're seeing the manifestation of this Bible we're we're we're seeing the the manifestation of this Bible in its fullness how in a marital Union it's Rebecca and Isaac coming together in a tent meeting United together in that tent I he said who was that the groom we'll meet you in there all right it's it's a meeting it's a union it's an invisible Union what who between the groom and his bride Christ and his bride amen the the word groom coming to the word bride or we could say the word groom coming for the word bride amen amen so this is what we are in fact looking at and I think I mentioned it yesterday but I I'm I'm I have to remind myself that I'm married to Christ Christ because there's things in my life that I come across that I as as the bride that I try to do myself but I realize I've got a groom because I'm not I'm I've transitioned from bride to wife I'm now married I'm now the wife right so as as wife the bride can't say that but a but when a bride becomes a wife at the altar how through a union she becomes wife so now because I'm newly wed I've got to remind myself that I'm married to him meaning that when I come across things that I can't handle that are too big for me I don't have to worry because I can take it to him why because I'm now looking at this I'm now looking at this it's the New Testament and the Old Testament United together in a marital Union it's Rebecca and Isaac United together as one and as a result of that there's a life that comes forth that is his very life it's his very life in me all right so this is this is why Revelations 5 um this is why in Revelations 5 the only one who was worthy to open the book was the groom of the book it was his book that book was a part of himself and when that lamb come forth he was Bloody he had paid the price he had won the battle he had prevailed he was worthy now to come forward and take the book right so now now he came to reveal a part of himself he didn't come to reveal a foreign part amen but he came to reveal a part of himself he came to reveal his bride who is a part of himself it was a masterpiece of himself is the we'll just move into this this uh scripture here in Genesis 221 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof and the rib and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and bought her unto the man all right he bought her God bought her unto the man yeah all right now just listen to this now but then we will notice NE them how how sweet and lovely they was and now I I say his eyes her eyes like the stars shining as blue as they could be and them like just Sparkle she must have been beautiful and Adam looked at her why it was love at first sight an operation had been formed and she was taken from his side and he must have took her by the hand and we'd say this let's take a little stroll darling so the prophet is explaining here and he says he he he he must have come and taken her by the hand he must have come and taken that part of him s by the hand I'll just go to the next slide here won't go to that just aing bring that illustration in and and and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and bought her unto the man now now just to look at this for a little bit because I believe what happened here was that Adam stepped forward when God brought his bride to him he stepped forward he stepped forward to take possession yes of a part of himself he stepped forward to take a possession of a part of himself his bride wasn't a foreign object but she was taken from him and be and because she was taken from him now God she was the workmanship of God and now God was reuniting that's these two parts back together again right this wasn't a union this was a reunion because once they were United as one but now so but now God had formed that that mystery part that was in Adam that we saw this morning God had brought that forward because God had said let us make a help mate help meat for Adam so the word went forth and then come the manifestation the word came forth that the the the word was spoken and then the word was manifested but at this point the word is not revealed Adam's bride at this point is not revealed at this point nothing is spoken of her when when when he when God bought the woman to the man the woman was sealed yeah she was a mystery H she didn't know who she was she was a mystery to herself she wasn't a mystery to the one who created her and she was not a mystery to Adam but she was a mystery to herself so so the part the mystery part the master the feminine Masterpiece of Adam was a was a was a sealed to her self she didn't know who she was true now you put this in relation to Revelation 5:7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne he came and took the book who came and took the book The Groom the lamb when John said Behold the Lamb of God you were in him then we can say this this was lamb coming to lamb beautiful this was word coming to word amen but but but the you see the right hand of him that sat upon the throne we know who that is that was God right that was the father we can say but now the lamb is coming forward to take possession of what is his as God brought the woman to the man Adam stepped forward to take possession of a part of [Applause] himself all right the book was his the woman was Adam's it was Adam coming to Adam amen amen it was Adam coming to Adam that's why she got her name after the fall but it was actually her name was Adam and their name was Adam it was Adam coming to Adam so what's the name of the book The Prophet would say what was revealed behind those seals he said it was Christ it was Christ coming to Christ glory to God it's such a beautiful picture it's such a beautiful happening it's such a beautiful event true amen amen so we we notice here that the lamb comes forth and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne but it was still sealed when when God brought the woman to the man and the W the man took the W Adam took his bride by the hand she was still sealed she was still a mystery to herself when the lamb stood came forth and took the book the book was still sealed the book wasn't open in the transition here the book wasn't open before the transition the book was sealed because there was only one who was worthy you see God didn't bring the book in the in the Garden of Eden he he didn't bring the woman to the monkey he didn't bring the woman woman to the donkey he knew who who who this was for amen he knew who it was for he knew who this belonged to he knew what it was a part of who she was a part of and it was his desire for those two parts to come into contact with one another again come into Union with one another again but the the she was sealed so possession comes first yes he took the book he took possession before he opened the seals he took possession now look what happens in in verse 23 sorry the breach now and now we're going to see what the book says about how it become open and it's not made known until the lamb takes the book and and breaks the seals and opens the book see the Lamb's got to take the book it's his amen it's not made known until the lamb takes the book once the lamb takes the book now he can open it why it's his the book is his glory to God Amen and Adam said yes amen amen and and Adam said what what did verse 22 who who spoke in verse 23 no one did say vers 22 no one did but he took possession in verse 23 Adam speaks so in verse 23 Adam begins to reveal the mystery part of himself not to him Adam speaking to her Adam is removing the seals from around her life Adam said this is now bone of my burone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh what I am you are what I reveal to you about myself you are you are bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride what I am you are but it was Adam there was only one worthy there was only one able amen amen and the one who was worthy and the one who was able was the one that she come out of so the woman was United with the one that she come out of and as a result of the uniting you ever seen the third pull in the in Genesis 2 you ever seen the tent meeting in Genesis 2 that's right I'll meet you in there and as a result of this meeting you ain't going to be the same you going we're going to go we're going to meet a certain way but from that meeting where you're going to come out of that meeting differently praise the Lord amen no one was worthy no one was able only only Adam was able and we read in Genesis 5 how uh sorry Revelation 5 how no one was worthy John looked and no one was worthy no one was able no he couldn't find anyone or to even look thereon and brother Bram talks about the sacredness of the female body this book is sacred absolutely she's sacred she is sacred no one's there's only one who's worthy there's only one who's worthy there's only one who's able there's only one that has a right to look there on so we come down to the the union here between the bride and the groom and you you know you can just take these pictures and you know just see the in in symbol form what is what is actually happening here but we understand that the the the lamb steps forth and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne but then in Revelation 6 he begins to remove the seals from the book and reveal the contents so when the when the book comes into the hands of of the of the Lamb we we understand what was happening we understand what was going on we understand that he was the only one worthy and I know I'm laboring that but I need to he was the only one who was able the same reason that Adam was the only one who was worthy the only one who was able is the same reason that the lamb is the only one who is able and the only one who is worthy to reveal a mystery beh behind this book this book but the lamb was coming forth for a part of himself he was stepping forward for a part of himself he was stepping forward for the New Testament part of himself he was stepping forward for the mystery part that no one could see when he was on Earth 2 year ago but now because the word has been spoken and now it has become manifest ested now God is revealing that which has become manifested by a message Hallelujah no one was worthy no one was able only one was able only one was worthy so the lamb steps forth and takes the book and as a result of taking the book what what what what what is it it's it's a union yes in that Union between the lamb and the book things happen the book can't be the same after this Union it can't be reversed after this Union it can't be the same amen praise God but we we're we're not we're not looking at a literal book where reading about it in the book but the book has become flesh the book has become manifested this is the written word of God but now the written word of God has become flesh so there's a book on Earth that God has come to take possession of amen and in that possession his desire is for the book to know itself yes it's his desire for the to reveal the book to the book when Jesus Took the book in Luke chapter 4 it was his desire to reveal the book to the people who were reading the book but now in this day the groom has stepped forward to take possession of the book to reveal the book to the book because this this is a public Affair this is a in the tent moment this is a time where you the this is a time where the second part of the book is not revealed to the world it's not a public Affair it's not a public message it's a private message it's a private revealing because there's only one who will know the contents of the book and that is her when when Jesus Took the book as we saw this morning in Luke chapter 4 he he he revealed himself to be the book he revealed himself to be the book but now the groom is on the scene and he has taken possession of a part of himself and he's revealing himself to be that part to that part he's revealing himself to be that part to that part as Adam revealed himself to be that part this is bone of my bone and Flesh of My flesh he revealed himself to be that part but in order for the the part of Adam to know who she was Adam had to be there that's right right in order for the part of of Adam to know who she was he had to be there see the the purpose of the unveiling of the seals or the removing of the seals is not to give you information no if we're only getting information then we we're we're missing a portion of it we we're missing the true picture because the unveiling of the seals is testifying of who's here that's right that is why if you are becoming a [Applause] revelation unto yourself who's doing it amen because we are living in the time where the lamb has come to take possession of what is rightfully his amen what he paid for he is now taking possession of and what he is taking possession of he is unveiling to her that's right thank you Lord he is unveiling her to her yes right it's impossible for her to know who she is unless he comes on the scene but as a result of him coming on the scene she is being revealed to herself this is why this picture is so important even though it's a little bit wrong it's so important but in the book in your Bible the Seven Seals are written in symbol form but they're not symbols anymore they're are reality they're actually are reality in 1 Peter 1:3 it says blessed be the Lord God of your father Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy which hath begotten us again in unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time amen amen ready to be revealed in the last time we are kept by the power of God ready to be revealed in the last time this book was kept by the power of God the prophet would say God does God is a spirit God doesn't have hands so what is the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the hand of God is power and authority so this book was kept by the power and authority ity of God we are kept by the power of God what ready to be revealed at the end time thank you Lord glory to God Amen God is God is amazing amen God is so good so the the the lamb comes forth to reveal a part of himself no no man knew it only the lamb amen amen think about this when John by the Holy Ghost revealed the lamb you was in him but you were not known so there was a portion of him that wasn't written yet the Old Testament was written but there was a portion of him that wasn't but now the portion that wasn't written becomes spoken and when then that which is spoken becomes written and then that which is written becomes manifested and then that which is manifested becomes revealed so the groom takes a part of the Masterpiece a part of himself and reveals her to be a part of of himself amen it it represents this book is is more than a book it represents the New Testament bride it represents a masterpiece because this literally was Masterpiece Coming To Masterpiece amen a part of himself the part of him that was not seen but it's now seen amen the part of him that was not written but is now seen all right the New Testament bride is being un is being unveiled by her Masterpiece amen amen because it's only the groom that can do it only the groom that can do it it's only the groom that can turn on the light there is a man who can turn on the light you think about some of the the message titles that the prophet preaches and you think well you know it's a good message title but it's more than a message title he he's trying to get something across God's shown him something God's revealed something to him but and now he wants you to have that same thing there is a man who can turn on the light there is a man who can turn on the light there is a man who can reveal a mystery concerning your life amen I I I I feel the presence of that man that that man is here that man is in my life that man is revealing me to me I'm becoming I'm becoming I'm becoming a greater Revelation unto myself because that man is revealing himself to me and I'm becoming a revelation unto me I'm becoming becoming becoming yes praise God Amen we're thankful amen we're thankful for his presence and that's what that's why I say I couldn't be what I am without him and nor could you amen this book went from a sealed book B to an unsealed book it couldn't be become an unsealed book unless the lamb took the book because only the lamb could take the book this whole picture speaks of Revelation it speaks of [Applause] Revelation the the the hand the hand the Lamb on the left the Lambs on the left was a revelation to his father the father was a revelation to the lamb the book was a revelation to the father and the book was a revelation to the lamb it all speaks of Revelation Revelation Revelation Revelation it speaks of relationship that's what the message is about it's about relationship it's unfortunate in our immature in the message that we've made at other things but now we're seeing what it what it really is it's just speaking about relationship the Bible is about relationship the prophet would say it's a love letter it's about relationship it's it's not about um legalism or you do this and I do that it's about relationship it's about re a reunion it's about Redemption it's about God redeeming that part of himself back unto himself cuz that's what's Happening Here the the the the lamb was coming forward to redeem a part of himself the part of himself that was lost he was coming forward to redeem that part and bring it back unto himself and reveal it unto her amen amen so so the the lamb takes possession of the book and this is why this bride she is not self-identified that's right she's not self-revealed she's revealed by her groom I I I don't know I just can't stress enough if the book could speak in the process of the Seven Seals being unveiled the book would say the lamb is revealing me the lamb is revealing me the lamb is revealing me the lamb is revealing me with every seal that was taken off it was there was a further unveiling a further unveiling a further unveiling of the same book so it's not just a oneof revelation it's something that continues to flow in our lives it's it's it's an unveiling after an unveiling after after an unveiling you are bone of my bone and and brother Ram said and means a conjunction of time and Flesh of My Flesh it was a continual unveiling it wasn't just a Wham unveiling it was a continually in a continual unveiling and that is what God is doing for the groom he is removing the seals from her life amen the lamb begins to speak concerning her Adam begins to speak concerning her yes Ela yes was speaking concerning her on Rebecca's journey to Isaac yeah that's right but now amen Isaac takes the place of eler because eler can only take her so far so now Isaac steps forward that's right amen and takes the place of elizer and Isaac says I'll take it from here right I'll take it from here you you you've done all that you can do well done my faithful servant glor amen so Isaac steps forward and and takes Rebecca by the hand I I I don't believe Isaac was in the tent and you hear Isaac from in that's right in here woman oh they met they met in the field they met in the field and Isaac takes H and Isaac says eler I'll I'll take it from here but the the the rest of what needs to be done I've got to do I've got to do it from here on Amen and El says Ela didn't argue right El said yeah I I I I know Lord I know I I I know it's the the son of man Ministry has to return amen the son of man Ministry has to return and now through that son of man Ministry you you've got to take it from here you've got to take her into the tent you've got to remove the seals from her life now now it's you and her that's amen so where are we living that's right where are we at there is a man who can turn on the light the the the Lord Jesus Christ it doesn't mean we do away with the message no the man has done his job the man has fulfilled his purpose but now the message is going to be completed through Ela sorry through Isaac because El Ela testified of what Isaac's going to do the prophet would say when when Rebecca was coming down and and she looked a far off and and she said who is that in the field and El is who would say well that's my master that's your groom so there was an introduction the Forerunner introduced Rebecca to Isaac who was coming to meet her in the field that's right amen but the that's not where the message stopped Hallelujah no because Ela had already testified to Rebecca what Isaac's going to do because Ela had the mind of Christ yeah Ela had the mind of Isaac so Ela knew that they were going to meet in the field Ela knew that there was going to be a tent meeting but he wasn't to take her into that tent meeting but he he knew that it was going to happen so he had already spoken those things to eler sorry to Rebecca eler had spoken those things to Rebecca but now it was coming the Fulfillment of what El had spoken but Ela now was off the scene praise the Lord so we're living in that time where Isaac is on the scene to fulfill the rest of the message yes yes yes the prophet eleazer said to you he said the Lord's going to meet you in there if you read it how a bride can read how her husband writes that's what you read cuz you're reading in between the lines and I know that doesn't give us poetic license to say whatever we say whatever we want but we can see it in the word because elizer had spoken to Rebecca and said what's going to happen is is the Lord has revealed to me that Isaac's going to come and he's going to take you and he's going to meet you he's going to take you into that little tent so the the Fulfillment of the message it can only be fulfilled by one there's only one worthy eler wasn't [Applause] worthy or able it took someone greater than eler is that right it took him who sent Ela to come on the scene and fulfill his portion yes of the word as the person of the word now being on Earth the groom now being on Earth taking his bride by the hand and leading leading her into a union and in that Union the seals become removed off her life and as a result of the seals becoming removed of her life there is a life that is produced through her that is his very life yes in her it's the same with Ruth and [Applause] Boaz there was a life produced as a result of a seal being broken yes that life was not her life life it was his life in her but how can his life become the preeminent life within her without there being a union the Lamb's got to come and take the book The Lambs got to come and Unite with the his bride and break the seal and reveal the contents reveal the Masterpiece reveal that she is as the prophet would say Spirit of my spirit word of my word life of my life but the prophet can't do do that the prophet can't reveal you to you the prophet's Duty was to introduce you to the groom Hallelujah and as a result of the the the the introductions you are are become you are becoming known to yourself but when you are becoming known to yourself who does it testify is here that's right that's right there's only one there's only one who can reveal you to you amen there's only one that can make cause you to make the transition from being a mystery to a mystery revealed there was only one who could take the book which was a mystery and caus it to become a mystery revealed but who does it testify of we can say that the book is open we can say that the seals are broken and the the the the contents are revealed but really what God wants us to see is who did it amen because we can preach about the open book and we can preach about the seals being loosed but but if we don't preach about the one who opened it then what's the point of preaching about the open book because the open book testifies that someone opened it when the mystery becomes a mystery revealed it testifies that someone revealed the mystery amen you were a mystery but now you're becoming a mystery revealed or sure you're a mystery revealed but you're becoming a mystery revealed because you don't know you to the fullest yet you know you right you know you but you don't know you to the fullest yet so you need to in in as a result of staying in Union with him what you're going to become is you're going to continue to unfold to yourself but the unfolding testifies of the one who could unfold you I don't know you can call me crazy you can I'm I'm repeating myself a lot but this is where God has bought me yes this is this is where God wants me to focus there is a man who can turn on the light the mystery is being revealed amen who's revealing it your groom your husband your lord your Redeemer your savior your Masterpiece it testifies of him amen what Eve what Adam's bride should have done when the serpent begin to beguile her she should have gone back to her Masterpiece because no one else was worthy no one else was able but the serpent deceived Eve into thinking that he had the ability to become something more than what she was there's one there's one who's worthy there's one who is there's there's there's no denominational program or system that can reveal you to you there's only one this is why Rebecca had to stay in contact with Sarah Ruth had toay stay in contact with Boaz Esther had to stay in contact with king of hazus her king that's right that's right because he was the only one worthy he was the only one who was able so in our time in of Temptation when Satan comes to try and deceive the second Adam's wife we know where to go we know what game he's playing oh but brother it doesn't matter what church I go to long as I go to church well I agree it doesn't matter what church you go to as long as that church is preaching from an open book and what I mean by that is is that it's not the man in the Pulpit revealing the mystery in the Pew that's right good that's good because there's one and if you are sitting here now becoming a revelation unto yourself who does it testify of who is present amen it testifies the only one who is worthy and the only one who is able to unveil you is present in your life we we want to look for evidences we want we want to see super Supernatural uh happenings brother and sister there's nothing more Supernatural than the unveiling of the word there is nothing more Supernatural than the unveiling of the word there is nothing more Supernatural than God taking this book and revealing the contents of this book it is more Supernatural than the dead being raised it's more Supernatural than the lame walking that's right it's more Supernatural than the the the deaf receiving their sight that's true the most Supernatural event on this Earth is the revealing of the word the revealing of the word as a person because what the Lord wants you to do is to be able to P pick up this book and find where it is written of you amen yes and say sorry I might have gone the wrong way and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears I've been kept by the power of God but now I am being revealed not self revealed but God revealed groom revealed good amen amen this day this scripture is fulfilled amen it makes all the difference amen what this is how God wants you to come to church when when Jesus walked into the synagogue he walked into the synagogue with a revelation of who he was right th this is this is what's going to happen in this church is there won't be a person that comes through that door and comes to Fellowship in this church without knowing who she is the the whole Fellowship is going to walk into this church with the revelation of who she is she's not going to come in and said oh I hope brother Elway can reveal who I am today she's going to come to church in the revelation of who she is and and brother El is going to pick up the book and he's going to read where it is written of you because the same word that speaks of me speaks of you because this is a many member body the Bride is a many membered body the same word that speaks of me speaks of you the same word that is a reality of you will become a reality to me the same word that is a reality to me becomes a reality to you because you are part of the body of Christ amen there's no insignificant parts to the body of Christ amen amen sometimes we need reminding of who we are sometimes she needs to hear it again sometimes in hearing hearing it again it sinks deeper it goes further it becomes more of a reality it drops into the heart but the the the thing that I that the thing that God is pressing upon my heart over these past couple of weeks is who is it who is it that is present who is it that is turning on the light amen I it's it's him I know it's him it's him because no one no one else was worthy and no one else was able amen let me just see where I'm going here we looked at this uh on on um uh yesterday a little bit and as a as a a a daughter a son and a father because this now has become flesh this is in our homes I have a daughter and she's in my hand she's in my hand it's about relationship this the son the the the the potential the boyfriend the is just the potential but they need to be a revelation to one another I I just I just feeling to say this tonight that it's not the it's it's the man it's the father of your if you're a father it's you not your wife who brings your children to maturity the lamb was not a mama's boy why because he had a relationship with his father a mama's boy ain't ready for marriage but reason a mama's boy is a mama's boy is because the boy has a relationship with Mama and not a relationship with Father yeah true yes the boy needs to become a father's boy because it's only the father that can bring the son to maturity it's only the father that can bring the his daughter to maturity this is why it's important for you as a father as the father of your children to instill value in your children for example if your children have a value of a dollar then thou will seek a groom that has the value of a dollar because the the the lamb and the bride are the same value the same word they are of the same value J this is why I don't understand how men treat their wives there's a revelation missing the way that you treat your wife you you really you can put yourself up on a pedestal you can put yourself up in a higher place than what your wife is but really the way you've put her is where you are amen Lord your wife is not of lesser value than you and the groom is not of more value than the bride they are the same value so when you give your children word value then what a groom is going to seek is someone who has the same value that he has he's looking for someone like himself he's looking for someone who has the same vision that he has if if he has a vision of the word then he is looking for a bride who has that same potential has that same vision has that same value this is why it's important that men young men have older men around them a some son needs a father but if a a young man doesn't have a father within the within the message or he's not in a place to bring him to manhood then someone adopt him I don't mean that literally but someone take him under your their wing may may an elder in the church take him under their wing and bring him the manhood it's the same as a as the church the church can't help anyone no that's not right the church can't redeem anyone the church can't bring anyone to maturity you know that the church is the woman but you know what the church does when someone gets in trouble I'll come here sweetheart how much do you need we baby them we mother them because that's what the church is the church is a mother but sometimes we've got to let them go because the only one that can bring a a a a son and daughter to maturity is Christ so sometimes we as a church we have to step back and we can't just uh meet everyone's needs when there's a whimper in the congregation and sometimes in a home mom you've got to step back but father you've got to rise up there's no point the mom stepping back and there's no one to take her place the a lot of the time the reason that the mother doesn't step back is cuz she knows there's no one to take the place but when she knows that that that that her husband is in a position to take her place cuz the transition has to be made from motherhood to fatherhood the children children must make that transition that's why the book was in the right hand of him the book kept the book was kept by him not her him this is why your relationship with your children should be at this level because the father is not going to give his daughter to anyone the father was not going to give this book to anyone this is why I believe that the the group room of the Bride becomes a revelation to the Father the groom the the groom the potential groom of the book becomes a revelation to the father of the book this is why the the daughter and the father need to work together because the daughter's Vision can become clouded so she needs needs to rely on someone who whose vision is not clouded who can think straight see straight and you know she he's she she she's not she's not she you know you know how it is when you fall in love you don't think straight you don't see Right Things become clouded but through the relationship of the daughter and the father the daughter should be able to go to the father and say Daddy what do you think and then the daddy should Daddy would well I'm I'm not sure yet oh that okay that's that's okay God will reveal it in due time there's got to be that relationship and that's what Satan doesn't want if you look at this picture here Satan was trying to get the book out of the hand of God because he wanted possession of it but because God cannot fail and because the the book was now in the in the rightful owner the original owner of of the book and etc etc now there was a there was a relationship it's not forceful the daughter and her father were a revelation to one another and because they were a revelation to one another the the the I don't know what these pages are but the the the the father could hold the book in not a forceful way it was a tender hand of [Music] the Father the father wasn't afraid therefore he didn't need to squeeze the book is this bit of paper important he didn't he didn't need to squeeze the book it wasn't a forceful grip it was about relationship it it was it was it was there was a relationship there so it it's important that the father knows his position it's important that the children understand the father's position in their lives because you own there's only one for you there's not many the the world sleeps around but the bride doesn't this is a sacred book she understands her sacredness she understands how to dress she understands that God has given her a sacred trust she understands who she is she understands that there's only one worthy she understands there's only one able and you you understand what those two things mean worthy means he's overcome himself he's prevailed over his own will and taken on the will of the Lord Jesus Christ he surrendered his own will like Jesus had to yeah what makes him able they're a part of one another because these two things are the they're the same this is the groom and this is the bride this can reveal this is able to reveal the contents of this because they're the same this is why don't don't get married don't don't just fall for the first guy that comes along make sure he's able I'm not saying that there's there's he he could be a first class man but just because he's a first class man doesn't mean he's worthy or able you've got to be a revelation to one another like this like we are a revelation to one another the groom and the bride are Revelation to one another as I close the prophet of God says in the rising of the sun we read this this morning but remember he went there with you in him see God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are same same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride amen well now well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to prove it by raising himself from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in the last days don't she have to return through Malachi 4 don't she have to manifest like it was in the days of Sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of God made known to us isn't these things a perfect identification of the word made known to us yeah is the word made known is the Masterpiece the Masterpiece has become manifested and now the manifested Masterpiece is now made known unto herself this is why the prophet in the Rapture message he preached from Psalm 27 yeah yes right because it shows the condition that the bride will be in at the time of the Rapture amen and if we're not in the time of the Rapture I don't know where we are but the Masterpiece is being revealed the the revelation of who you are will become so strong in your life that gravity won't hold you here the unveiling of the Bride will be such a powerful event that it nothing will keep us here not even the natural laws of this earth like gravity is going to keep the bride bound why because she's Rising by Revelation amen there's a bride rising up amen there's a bride rising up yes in the strength of the revelation of herself you know Adam gave Eve what she needed to defeat the serpent but you know what Eve didn't do she didn't go back to what Adam said but this end time bride will not fall for the same deception that Adam's bride fell to that's right not because of you but because of what God is doing for you if it wasn't for God you would be deceived but because of God you are not deceived you can stand in the strength of the revelation of who you are and you can say what Jesus said it is written right he quoted the word right he quoted from where from the word which he was he didn't just quote the word he SP spoke to the serpent through the revelation of who he was because he was that word so now when Satan comes to tempt the Masterpiece bride what is she going to quote because if all you do is quote it won't work but you've got to quote the word you've got to speak the word is probably a better way to to quote the word you don't need a revelation of it but when to you speak the word you're speaking the word in the power of that word or in the revelation of that word and when you speak the word you're speaking who you are amen the word Can't Fail amen the word didn't fail the original Masterpiece and the word will not fail this the the bride's Masterpiece amen but she can pick up the book and say it is written yes that I am perfect you can't make me any more than what I am because I am finished the devil wants to come to you and say well if you if you do this this and this you'll be a greater Masterpiece than what you are rubbish it's a lie I am finished I am the Masterpiece I am a part of the I am Hallelujah I am a part of the godhead bod am I am oh beautiful in the strength what are you doing you're you're you're you're quoting from the word it is written I am complete it is written I am perfect in Christ it is written I am a part of the godhead bodily it is written I have been kept by the power of God but now I am revealed amen who makes it possible for you to speak like that when when my wife married me I gave her a new language I gave her a language that she couldn't speak until I took her and made her my own or revealed her to be my own I gave her a language I made it possible for her to speak a language that she once couldn't speak right amen and now the book is becoming opening open there's a language that is coming from the bride's mouth that once she couldn't speak yes Lord but the question is who made it possible for you to speak this way Hallelujah Lord Jesus who made it possible for the prophet Propet to speak the revelation of those seals it was a language it wasn't him he didn't go to language school but God come down and he opened the seals to the prophet and now the prophet could speak the unwritten part or the unspoken part because it was only there in symbol form so when the prophet begin to reveal the first horse rider never before had one spoken like that man that's right never before who made it possible that's the point it's not while the first horse rider wow wow wow wow look he's got a bow but he hasn't got an arrow it's deception yeah wonderful but who revealed it who did it who opened it who made that possible that language possible yes true they came a time when my wife through a union was able to call herself by another name that's right that's right it's not it it we focus on what she's doing but that's only a portion true the real focus is who made it possible that's right I just can't stress it enough who made it possible this the sick can be healed the lame can be can can walk the the blind can see and we praise God and we thank God who made it possible who did it Israel come to the Red Sea and the Sea opened and they saw a man standing on a hill with with his staff raised and they walk through but I don't know how many of them stopped to think who did it Israel ends up on the back side of the desert where there's nothing to eat nothing to drink they've run out of water and God says to Moses I'll meet you at a particular Rock I'll meet you at Rock har I'll meet you there why God was going to bring forth water God said to Moses Smite The Rock listen Moses didn't open the rock there was someone else there other than Moses Lord but how many Saw the one the invisible one how many saw the one who actually split the Rock and caused water to come forth not many probably just two probably just Caleb and Joshua and they drunk from that rock they drunk from that rock different to how everyone else drunk because they knew Mo Moses I mean if you've ever seen the rock yes it's actually split in two it's there two parts and it's just literally come open like that that's right it's up on a hill and the water ran out of that rock Moses didn't split the Rock brother Brenham didn't break the seals hallah amen someone else was there this is why we're feeding from that which has been revealed we we're drinking from it differently to how everyone else is drinking from it because we know it wasn't the prophet that opened the seals there was someone else present amen hallelujah and now those seals have been removed from our lives personally true and we didn't do it I didn't do it he did it the groom did it Amen brother ELR if you'd like to come we thank God amen amen we thank God for the opening of the book you know what I mean we we we thank God for the opening of the book I thank God for opening me brother Dan you said the book yeah that's what I said I thank God for opening me and revealing the content praise God God bless you brother amen it's just so much to uh to process today but I trust that it's been a blessing I trust that it's been real Faith builder for us tonight amen amen that the Lord the Lord will uh continue to to unfold this to us you know it's just like I said this morning I love how the Lord brings a different vessel and just brings just a a different angle and a different perspective it's just was just really special you know just a simple little thing but but how um Genesis 2 that it's just just occurring to me then in verse 22 when God took took the woman out of Adam it was done in silence wonderful amen then God brought so there was not a big noise when God brought the woman to Adam wonder and the first thing that was spoken was spoken to her secretly and it was revealing to her you are bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh amen there's the half hour silence also praise the Lord I me let's stand [Music] together oh Jesus has a table spread with the saints of God are fair he invites his chosen people come and

item years ago but I'm really struggling to re remember the uh the how it goes no I'm just I'm not going to try I'm just going to have to make it up I I'll just read the words how about that six water pots of stone were filled with water to the brim at the marriage Feast which is where we're at where the wine was going fast Jesus changed that water then to the finest one remember the seventh seal came and changed the six water pots and the governor said you saved the best for last God's plan has been unfolding just a little at a time a light that Shone so dim in ages past that's the light that

day awesome weekend I thank God for his visitation yes amen and may the Lord continue to reveal this word wonderful father oh Lord you indeed saved the best for last Lord oh lord lord it's eventually becoming clear Lord why your Prophet said if he could choose what age he would live in he would have chosen this time not because he wasn't looking at the darkness of L DEA he wasn't looking at Satan's Eden in full swing he wasn't looking at all the mess in the world and how Up Is Down and Down is up and good is bad and bad is good father he wasn't looking at that he was looking at what you
