[28:29] well that as our hearts begin to worship
[28:34] we will be blessed because we care we
[28:41] will be blessed because we came
[28:45] I greet you in the wonderful name of our
[28:50] Lord Jesus Christ real privilege to be
[28:54] with you on this Easter weekend of
[28:56] course the Easter weekend I believe the
[28:59] most important remembrance of the
[29:02] Christian calendar if we can call it
[29:03] that
[29:04] it's our victory weekend is the weekend
[29:07] of our testimony of what God has done
[29:10] for us and it's a celebration from
[29:13] beginning to end from Calvary though we
[29:16] remember that with not as a sad occasion
[29:20] because we know that the victory was won
[29:22] there for us so we thank God for Calvary
[29:24] we thank God for the work that he did
[29:29] during that Sabbath and of course we
[29:32] thank God for the resurrection that
[29:35] Easter Sunday which is our victory day
[29:37] and paved the way for us to be part of
[29:40] that kingdom of God that is everlasting
[29:42] eternal cannot fade cannot be done away
[29:46] with so we thank the Lord for this
[29:50] occasion we have and we want to greet
[29:51] you and just encourage you during this
[29:53] time I know it seems to be stressful to
[29:56] me it's not really a stressful time it's
[29:58] a time to get the anchors down as a time
[30:00] to get settled down to make sure that
[30:02] what the Lord has for us has been
[30:05] thoroughly absorbed as the Bible speaks
[30:08] about eating the book this is certainly
[30:09] a time to eat that book so we thank the
[30:12] Lord for that for those who are still in
[30:15] the workplace or doing essential
[30:17] services or in the medical field and so
[30:19] forth we want to remember you during
[30:21] this time as well and we we thank God
[30:23] that you know that there's a still an
[30:26] open door for us to gather even in this
[30:29] fashion we don't know if this will carry
[30:31] on till the rapture but you know as we
[30:34] have the opportunity and so we thank the
[30:36] Lord for that we're gonna go straight
[30:38] into the scripture we want to read from
[30:41] Luke chapter 23 it just seems to be a
[30:45] small episode recorded in the three
[30:46] Gospels in two of the Gospels only one
[30:50] verse and in Luke we read a bit more
[30:52] about it Luke 23 will read from verse 42
[30:59] and our title is this day in paradise
[31:01] you know what we're talking about you
[31:03] can see the picture there this to me is
[31:06] one of the most incredible portions of
[31:08] the scripture and really includes every
[31:10] single one of us Luke chapter 23 I'm
[31:13] going to read verse 42 and 43 before we
[31:17] do that let's just close our eyes and
[31:18] ask the Lord's blessing Heavenly Father
[31:20] Lord we are so dependent upon you today
[31:24] realizing recognizing Lord that the
[31:27] world is in a turmoil it is in an
[31:29] upheaval there's a handwriting on the
[31:32] wall so to speak oh god of the coming
[31:35] oncoming storms of judgment and so we're
[31:37] glad Lord for a refuge we're glad for a
[31:39] safe place we're glad Lord and we can
[31:42] find ourselves in your embrace Lord in
[31:45] your care in your kingdom sealed in
[31:48] there and Lord God this day is we will
[31:51] look at these scriptures and a few
[31:53] things the prophets said Lord we ask
[31:55] your special blessing upon it may every
[31:58] heart adheres may every heart at his
[32:00] fellowshipping together with us may they
[32:02] feel the anointing of God may they
[32:04] recognize your presence may they draw
[32:06] close to you the Lord will you touch
[32:08] every heart for your glory and honor as
[32:11] we ask it in Jesus name Amen hallelujah
[32:15] we praise God for his wonderful mercy
[32:17] and His grace Luke chapter 23 with just
[32:20] read through of the verses 42 and 43 and
[32:23] he said that's now the thief on the
[32:26] cross he said unto Jesus Lord remember
[32:29] me
[32:30] we're now come into thy kingdom and
[32:33] Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto
[32:35] thee today shalt thou be with me in
[32:38] paradise today thou shalt be shalt thou
[32:42] be with me in paradise now a man's
[32:47] nature as the prophet taught us it's
[32:48] just is known by his expression what he
[32:53] expresses what he lives out what he what
[32:55] he not just necessarily what he says but
[32:57] what he his attitude the things he
[33:00] expresses that makes it makes known what
[33:05] the man's nature is God God's attributes
[33:08] and character for example is declared in
[33:11] Christ the scripture tells us he brew
[33:12] one verse three says who being the
[33:15] brightness of his glory that's Jesus now
[33:17] being the brightness of God's glory and
[33:19] the Express image of his person we know
[33:23] who God is we know how God is because of
[33:26] Jesus Christ before that thing you could
[33:29] talk about a pillar of fire and
[33:30] earthquakes and all kinds of rumblings
[33:33] and things and dealings with man through
[33:34] the prophets and the law and so forth
[33:37] but once Jesus came on the scene that
[33:39] was the Express image of God's person in
[33:43] John 1:18 the Bible tells us no man has
[33:46] seen God at any time but the only
[33:48] begotten Son which is in the bosom of
[33:50] the Father he hath declared him and I
[33:54] love that which is in the bosom of the
[33:55] Father what is in the bosom is the heart
[33:58] and that heart desire of God that the
[34:01] heart purpose of God was declared in
[34:03] Jesus Christ
[34:05] that's what brother Brown talks about in
[34:07] the church age book when he uses that
[34:09] exact phrase he's talking about the
[34:11] heart purpose of God he says the heart
[34:13] purpose the eternal purpose of God was
[34:16] to take a bride of his own choosing and
[34:19] that purpose was in himself and being
[34:22] eternal was decreed before the
[34:24] foundation of the world God had a heart
[34:27] purpose and that was to take a bride of
[34:29] his own choosing we find quite a picture
[34:31] here represented on Good Friday by a
[34:35] mystery at the very seat at the very
[34:39] place of redemption a nameless man known
[34:43] only by his worst deeds
[34:46] there's no good testimony about this man
[34:49] at all the Bible calls him a malefactor
[34:51] that's it that's all we know about him
[34:54] nothing about where he comes from we
[34:56] don't even know he was a Jew or a
[34:57] Gentile
[34:58] we know nothing about him all we know
[35:01] about him is that he was on the wrong
[35:03] side of the law to such a degree that
[35:05] they were going to put him to death in
[35:07] the worst way possible he wasn't just a
[35:10] common little thief and the wrong nature
[35:14] had driven him his entire life making
[35:18] him to end up at that place at that time
[35:20] his whole entire life we could say was
[35:23] wasted a wasted life
[35:26] at no time to live for God this was the
[35:29] last hours of that existence he was
[35:31] going to be on earth there was nothing
[35:33] of value that you could look at and say
[35:35] there's some redemptive attribute some
[35:38] redeemable quality in this man's life
[35:41] that you could say well there's at least
[35:44] some hope there was no hope at all not
[35:47] the slightest thirst for God in this man
[35:50] the Prophet tells us that I'll read the
[35:52] quote in a few minutes
[35:53] I wrote it here read it here awhile ago
[35:55] where where brother banner talks about
[35:57] it he didn't have not did not have a
[35:59] thirst for God you remember he was also
[36:03] revealing at the at the start initially
[36:06] he was also criticizing was also mocking
[36:09] he was also joining in the in the what
[36:17] the crowd was doing what what his fellow
[36:19] fellow malefactor was doing what the
[36:22] priests were doing what the Romans were
[36:24] doing he was joining in in that and here
[36:28] was the last hours of his worthless
[36:31] misspent utterly selfish shameful
[36:34] existence has finally arrived you could
[36:37] almost say like people who go to watch
[36:39] these watch these death sentences
[36:41] carried out they were glad they didn't
[36:43] feel anything that worthless human being
[36:46] in there he deserved what he got
[36:48] and now that he's out of existence
[36:50] everybody is the world's a better place
[36:52] well you could almost say the same thing
[36:54] about this man the world would be a
[36:56] better place with him out of the way yet
[37:01] underneath all of that was a seed of God
[37:04] hard to imagine that's why I call it a
[37:09] mystery because this man's life
[37:11] contained a seed of God an eternal
[37:14] attribute of the Living God
[37:15] a thought of God that could never did
[37:19] never come into existence was always
[37:21] there could not be altered could not
[37:24] fade away could not be rejected could
[37:26] not be changed in any fashion
[37:29] this was God's eternal thought there was
[37:32] on that cross on Calvary's Hill and the
[37:37] amazing thing of course is we know that
[37:39] there's not a
[37:40] what step in the life of a son or
[37:43] daughter of God that is out of place God
[37:46] ordains every footstep even ordained for
[37:48] for for a Jonah to run the other way why
[37:52] because he had a fish already prepared
[37:54] because he was supposed to arrive in
[37:56] Nineveh in a fish and not in a ship or
[37:59] not on foot he was supposed to arrive
[38:00] there in a fish so even even though
[38:03] Azure or Jonah's stumbling and falling
[38:05] and running away and backsliding was in
[38:08] God's purpose and here we had an entire
[38:10] life that was lived in vain you could
[38:12] say but that life was planned beforehand
[38:15] and it was supposed to end up on
[38:18] Calvary's Hill it was supposed to end up
[38:20] with his sacrifice right there God had
[38:24] planned that life their names were
[38:27] written together in God's book brother
[38:30] Branham says when God brought the Lamb's
[38:32] Book of Life he wrote Jesus Christ the
[38:34] Lamb of God right at the top and then he
[38:36] wrote every name we would ever be
[38:38] associated with that sacrifice under
[38:40] there so there's that special chapter
[38:42] and this man's name was written there
[38:45] and to such a degree well we don't know
[38:47] his name today but his name's written
[38:50] there one who did nothing but evil his
[38:53] entire life right next to one who did
[38:55] nothing but good his entire life one to
[38:59] go to hell so both may meet in paradise
[39:02] and that is the Marvel for me God had
[39:04] written his life story and today we have
[39:07] it eternal in the word included in God's
[39:10] Word it will never pass away even though
[39:13] heavens and earth will there was a world
[39:17] a picture around them was a world much
[39:20] like today you could say where
[39:21] everything was hanging in the balance a
[39:23] tremendous hour the greatest hour the
[39:26] world would see of the hour of
[39:27] redemption the hour the price would be
[39:29] paid for what happened in Eden and
[39:32] everything would be undone that that had
[39:35] come through the fall now God desired a
[39:37] representative of Adam's race right
[39:39] there and say wasn't Mary enough wasn't
[39:42] John enough he had somebody right there
[39:45] who we would only turn down somebody who
[39:48] was just no good had no redeemable
[39:52] quality it seemed
[39:53] a nameless and I'm glad he was nameless
[39:55] because that means he could be anybody
[39:57] and he could be everybody he could be me
[40:00] in fact I believe I was definitely
[40:02] represented there God picked a
[40:05] representative for redemption and in his
[40:09] pain you know what it was an agony there
[40:12] you couldn't think somebody could make a
[40:14] decision even or think rationally the
[40:18] pain becomes so intense that you you
[40:20] lose control of your thinking of your
[40:23] ability to your three reason and and and
[40:27] make decisions and think things through
[40:29] the pain is just becomes unbearable and
[40:32] in that in that agony in that moment it
[40:37] was hopeless also remember he didn't
[40:39] have a way out this wasn't the
[40:41] punishment it was temporal and he was
[40:42] gonna walk away from there this was the
[40:45] end of his life he was not going to
[40:46] recover from this things will only get
[40:49] worse and once he died he had no hope of
[40:52] heaven he had no hope of redemption it
[40:55] was just darkness that was waiting for
[40:57] him and condemnation so it was a
[40:59] hopeless agony a terrible terrible place
[41:03] to be right in that moment in that
[41:05] condition the veil was lifted for him
[41:08] now you could talk about the power of
[41:11] Revelation when God unveiled something
[41:13] because from one moment to the next
[41:15] something happened because at one time
[41:19] he was mocking at one time he was
[41:21] cursing at one time he couldn't see who
[41:25] this was next to him but something
[41:27] happened there what changed his mind you
[41:30] could wonder what was it he didn't hear
[41:34] a sermon all he heard was the false
[41:38] accusations if thou be the Son of God he
[41:41] saw the frailty of a dying man that's
[41:44] all he saw he saw the hate he saw the
[41:47] rejection what changed his mind well we
[41:52] could speculate perhaps just to look
[41:54] just to look an expression on the face
[41:58] maybe perhaps the words of forgiveness
[42:01] that he heard Father forgive them they
[42:03] don't know what they're doing
[42:05] maybe something touched him when you
[42:07] those words perhaps the silent agony not
[42:13] revealing not cursing like they were not
[42:16] shouting not expressing anything but
[42:23] something from eternity was reflected
[42:25] there something caught his attention a
[42:26] gene of God we know on the inside of him
[42:29] a spark there was buried so deep that
[42:31] his entire life was lived in a state
[42:35] where that where that spark was
[42:37] smothered and he was living in disgrace
[42:39] but an attribute that shout at before
[42:42] there was the world was in him an
[42:46] attribute that had rejoiced at the very
[42:48] plan unfolding on the hill that day that
[42:51] had seen it before there was a world and
[42:53] shouted for joy and sung the songs of
[42:56] heaven at the sight of Redeemer and the
[42:58] great love of God that would buy us back
[43:01] that spark that amnezia suddenly lifted
[43:04] and he must have recognized right there
[43:07] because he called him Lord he recognized
[43:10] him faultless he recognized him without
[43:14] mistake and he started testifying and
[43:17] started telling the other malefactor
[43:19] there why are you doing this he did
[43:21] nothing we deserve what we got don't you
[43:23] fear god what a thing to say what
[43:27] changed his opinion so quickly what made
[43:30] him recognize that this was God Himself
[43:32] the Redeemer the Messiah the Lamb of God
[43:35] taking away the sin of the world on
[43:37] Calvary's Hill something happened now
[43:44] God's Way out God's Way of Revelation is
[43:48] not the way of carnal attraction or
[43:50] power or strength there's something
[43:52] behind the scenes behind the veil that
[43:54] attracts seeing it attracts the believer
[43:56] as the Bible said he had no beauty that
[43:58] we should desire me there was no outward
[44:00] show that we could think this was the
[44:03] Messiah this must be the Messiah he has
[44:05] the endorsement of all the societies in
[44:07] the churches he must be some important
[44:10] person some respected somebody so there
[44:14] was another sight there was another look
[44:16] there was another
[44:18] unveiling that took place there that
[44:20] caught this man's attention and we find
[44:24] even the Holy Ghost the Bible calls it a
[44:27] stumbling block in other words it comes
[44:30] in a way that it offends people here's a
[44:33] little quote from persevering brother
[44:34] Brennan says and the very thing that
[44:37] killed the unbelieving world saved Noah
[44:39] he was talking of course about the
[44:40] judgment the flood because that's the
[44:42] same as it is today now watch what he's
[44:44] going to say next the stumbling block
[44:47] the Holy Spirit that's making the world
[44:52] where they don't want it
[44:54] making the world where they don't want
[44:57] it my goodness maybe you never thought
[45:00] of that
[45:00] the same God who was your soul the same
[45:04] God and knocks on your door is making it
[45:07] so the world don't want it it will spoil
[45:10] their parties it'll spoil their fun it
[45:12] will interrupt their programs it will
[45:15] cause all sorts of discomfort and
[45:17] condemnation and what more they don't
[45:19] want it but it's the Holy Spirit that
[45:23] does it so the Holy Spirit comes in a
[45:25] way remember when if when the disciples
[45:27] asked Jesus why do you speak to them in
[45:29] parables he said so that they won't
[45:32] understand Wow
[45:35] the God of mercy the God of grace God
[45:37] the Redeemer speaks to mankind so they
[45:40] won't understand and when he sends the
[45:42] Holy Ghost it comes like they won't
[45:43] don't want to receive it but there it is
[45:46] so what made that man want to receive it
[45:52] since the things that they are turning
[45:54] down is the very thing that will take
[45:56] the church up the Holy Spirit will take
[45:59] the church in the rapture but for this
[46:03] man there was no more time he'd run out
[46:05] of time he could not live a life for God
[46:07] now he could not have a testimony for
[46:09] God there was no time for repentance
[46:11] there was no time for restitution for
[46:13] making things right all the things that
[46:15] he stole all the people that he robbed
[46:18] all the hurt that he caused no time to
[46:21] make that right he could not give a
[46:22] promise to do better he's run out of
[46:25] time he could not devote himself to God
[46:28] he could not even have faith he was just
[46:30] there dying and
[46:32] and living out his last few minutes in
[46:33] this world what did he see in the Old
[46:36] Testament we read about the brass
[46:38] serpent and we know that that was a
[46:40] foreshadow of Christ that was sin judged
[46:42] and right there that brass serpent being
[46:45] raised up what did it cause just to look
[46:47] just to look brought healing to a
[46:49] deathly illness a deathly poison that
[46:54] was raging through the camp and one look
[46:57] at that serpent a look of faith would
[46:58] change that person's sickness into
[47:02] health again but that person would die
[47:04] again but here this one sacrifice the
[47:08] Bible says perfects forever not only
[47:11] preserves life not only saves life but
[47:15] perfects forever by one sacrifice that's
[47:20] what he was looking at
[47:21] and if God lifted the veil and suddenly
[47:24] he saw this was God the Redeemer I am
[47:27] reminded of a rich young ruler who also
[47:29] looked I wonder what he saw he saw a
[47:31] teacher he saw a wise man he saw
[47:34] somebody that there was an attraction
[47:36] there too but he was too rich in this
[47:39] cursed life whereas that poor man on the
[47:43] cross had lost absolutely everything had
[47:46] been stripped of everything and is now
[47:49] going to be stripped of his life also
[47:51] publically dying in shame nothing left
[47:56] for him but mercy nothing left for him
[47:59] but mercy I believe this is the Easter
[48:02] story for me that's exactly all of us
[48:05] bundled together and what what came out
[48:08] of that man is the most sublime thing
[48:10] you know what is just a cry there was
[48:13] just a cry coming from his heart just
[48:14] one line one line remember me Lord
[48:22] remember me Lord how could he forget him
[48:26] how could he forget that one when he had
[48:29] ordered all the footsteps of his life to
[48:31] end up on that hill on that cross next
[48:34] to him he had caused him it opened doors
[48:36] and closed doors and organize things and
[48:39] turned friends and family maybe against
[48:42] him or brats or circumstances in his
[48:45] life that he couldn't
[48:46] overcome why because he wanted him on
[48:49] that cross he had already written his
[48:50] story before there was the world how
[48:53] could he forget him when that man said
[48:56] remember me he had remembered him all of
[48:58] his life he'd remembered every footstep
[49:00] he took he wrote that unknown name in
[49:04] his Lamb's Book of Life
[49:05] how can he forget him when the Bible
[49:07] tells us his his name had been engraved
[49:10] on his hands by that Roman iron pen when
[49:16] he longed and waited for that expression
[49:18] of his great love and redemption planned
[49:21] before the world was he was waiting for
[49:23] that cry for mercy he was waiting
[49:26] because he knew it was coming he knew
[49:28] him before there was the world and he
[49:29] knew he was going to do that when he
[49:31] appointed him he ordained him as a
[49:33] representative of all a fallen man to
[49:37] die and live there next to him because
[49:39] we can see we can't just say that's a
[49:41] moment of death because it wasn't what
[49:44] we witness is a moment of life a birth
[49:47] right there on the cross of a man who
[49:50] was condemned to death and had no reason
[49:53] even to be alive no redeeming quality to
[49:57] him but there was a birth taking place
[49:59] there was a life going to be expressed
[50:02] this man's life you know what the very
[50:08] existence of that man the very existence
[50:13] of that man was locked up inside of him
[50:19] who he was was inside of Christ right
[50:22] there on that tree waiting for that cry
[50:25] to be expressed in words to speak it out
[50:27] with that voice of creation the thought
[50:29] concerning him he was waiting for that
[50:31] cry he could not he was I I wonder you
[50:34] know amidst all the agony and all the
[50:39] blood and all the the pain and all the
[50:41] sudden it was coming upon him and
[50:43] crushing is very being separated in the
[50:45] water in the blood all amidst all that
[50:47] incredible suffering he was waiting for
[50:49] those words remember me why cuz he had a
[50:53] line he had a word he had something to
[50:57] reply he had something to say
[51:00] and he knew we know his words are
[51:02] creative his words create things his
[51:04] words can change his words can translate
[51:07] his words can can can transform and he
[51:12] was waiting to say the real truth about
[51:14] this man's life everything up to that
[51:16] point had been a lie everything had been
[51:19] in vain everything was for nothing
[51:21] but here he was gonna place him right
[51:24] there and said this day this day you
[51:29] will be with me in paradise
[51:31] he placed him right there in paradise
[51:34] why because there was a little cry from
[51:37] his heart what a merciful God now
[51:40] remember God is expressed through Christ
[51:42] this is God this is God's heart towards
[51:45] anybody who has the slightest desire
[51:48] towards him how can he possibly turn
[51:52] anybody down
[51:53] who has that desire and his word he says
[51:55] whosoever will let him come and I will
[51:58] he no wise cast him out what happened he
[52:02] was recognized right there recognized as
[52:05] a son of God recognized he was placed he
[52:08] was redeemed he was forgiven justified
[52:11] liberated lifted up into the heavenlies
[52:13] remember where did he place him not on
[52:16] the hill lifted up on a cross he placed
[52:18] him in paradise that very same day say
[52:22] you will be with me in paradise and we
[52:24] know he could not go back to paradise
[52:27] and that's not where he came from so he
[52:29] placed him right back he's in his
[52:31] original condition that's why we can say
[52:32] redeemed redeemed brought back to his
[52:36] ought to be condition we're on a cross
[52:39] in agony in the last hours of his life
[52:42] in utter shame and defeat what a picture
[52:47] how sure men as that is transported in a
[52:51] moment in a moment by God's voice God's
[52:55] voice that is creative God's voice that
[52:58] said peace be still God's voice that
[53:00] said let there be light
[53:02] remember the worlds were created by
[53:03] Jesus Christ as the Bible tells us and
[53:06] the very same creative voice was on that
[53:08] cross knocks next to that sinner next to
[53:11] that thief and could speak to him
[53:13] bring to him the reality of what he had
[53:16] in his mind before there was a world and
[53:18] he did it by speaking his word
[53:20] a deep that unknown desire he had
[53:24] smothered in his whole life he'd had
[53:26] that desire didn't recognize it that but
[53:30] suddenly something happened in the cry
[53:32] came out of his mouth Lord remember me
[53:34] and he was transported from a sin cursed
[53:38] misery to heavenly places in a moment
[53:41] when he opened his eyes next he was in
[53:45] paradise when he opened his eyes he was
[53:49] in paradise when God opens yours it's
[53:52] the same you might say well I'm still in
[53:55] Laodicea I'm still in a sin cursed body
[53:57] I'm still in this old pest house
[53:59] I still have heartaches and
[54:00] disappointments and wrong desires and
[54:02] all kinds of mistakes when you open your
[54:06] spiritual eyes you'll really recognize
[54:09] where you are you are in paradise the
[54:11] voice of God on the earth then that
[54:14] spoke as I mentioned they remember and
[54:16] the Old Testament the prophets said thus
[54:18] saith the Lord thus saith the Lord this
[54:19] one said I say unto you I say unto you
[54:23] this is very God in flesh the very same
[54:26] one rejected for religious tradition
[54:30] that's exactly what put him on the cross
[54:32] it wasn't politics it was religious
[54:35] tradition that put him on the cross and
[54:38] that religious tradition we know always
[54:41] results in a whited Sepulcher as he
[54:43] called it why does Sepulcher an outward
[54:46] appearance hiding carnal motives and
[54:49] that can happen in any and any phase in
[54:52] any age and I think we are not immune to
[54:55] it people trying to live a message life
[54:57] and they don't really have the motives
[54:59] for it just an outward appearance a
[55:02] message culture a lifestyle but echoing
[55:07] through the ages I believe God that same
[55:09] voice that same voice that spoke that
[55:11] day on the on Calvary that same voice
[55:14] echoed through the ages through these
[55:16] messengers these stars to reach into the
[55:19] darkest age that were ever that will
[55:22] ever be and we are in it the worst age
[55:28] the voice of God still calling still
[55:30] echoing the voice of God and that grace
[55:33] sufficient what is it bringing to you it
[55:35] speaks the same thing it did for him
[55:37] it's still lifting the veil it's calling
[55:39] it's calling and searching to find these
[55:42] offenders these malefactors and the
[55:44] highways and the hedges in the slums of
[55:46] the world and here we are if there's a
[55:48] cry in your heart it's something
[55:50] happened to you when you first heard
[55:51] those words something spoke to your
[55:55] heart and you couldn't quite understand
[55:56] what it was but a cry went out from you
[55:58] Lord remember me that's what Easter is
[56:02] to every believer the voice of
[56:04] Resurrection coming to you the voice of
[56:06] life the voice that transplants you from
[56:09] this old world from this carnal nature
[56:10] and puts you in paradise my cry is heard
[56:15] in layered Asiya yes where we have a
[56:19] rejected truth once again a crucified
[56:21] word but that Eagle scream was meant for
[56:24] me it was meant for me and for you know
[56:26] all the people on the on that hill that
[56:29] day all the witnesses there I believe
[56:31] there was one big beneficiary although
[56:33] all mankind
[56:34] of course we benefit from that sacrifice
[56:36] there was somebody there directly at
[56:39] that moment who recognized his life was
[56:41] not in vain God had mercy on him God
[56:44] lifted the veil for him God's voice was
[56:47] beckoning him come up higher you know
[56:50] and I think that's exactly what happened
[56:51] in the church ages as we find that seed
[56:53] going into the ground
[56:55] God progressively bringing from one
[56:57] stage to another bringing from from one
[57:00] place to another from one revelation one
[57:02] unfolding to another ever higher and
[57:04] higher to where we are now and right
[57:07] here in present stage of my ministry 62
[57:10] brother Branham says but now if that
[57:12] little fish could care ever come up here
[57:15] and be me would he ever want to be their
[57:17] little fish again down in that midnight
[57:19] blackness he'd never wanted to be a fish
[57:21] no more because he's something greater
[57:23] than a fish he's a man he senses our
[57:26] greater his understanding is greater his
[57:28] intelligence is supreme just multiply
[57:31] that by 10 million then you get what it
[57:34] is when you pass from this into the
[57:36] presence of God yonder where the human
[57:38] being is so much further than what we
[57:40] are here you'd never want to be a human
[57:42] being like this no more down in this
[57:45] pest house of sickness and corruption
[57:46] it's been that in my heart and I've
[57:48] tried these 30 years to preach the
[57:50] gospel around the world to tell people
[57:52] that there is a heaven to gain and
[57:54] there's a hell to shun listen there's a
[57:57] God that loves you a God that loves you
[58:00] a redeeming power that's laying ready to
[58:03] pick you up at any time that you're
[58:05] ready to receive it if we can't see that
[58:08] in the thief on the cross if we can't
[58:09] see that in that man's life the moment
[58:12] he was ready to have that little cry
[58:14] towards God if God does not change and
[58:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[58:19] and forever
[58:20] then he has to react the same way today
[58:23] if you have a cry in your heart if you
[58:26] have a hunger and the need in your heart
[58:28] and if you could cry Lord remember me
[58:30] wouldn't he act the same way wouldn't he
[58:32] say the same words to you what made that
[58:35] man qualify for mercy just sin just a
[58:41] hopeless worthless life there's nobody
[58:43] that stands in the front of the line
[58:45] when it comes to mercy it's all of us
[58:48] that's why I thank God he didn't have a
[58:51] name because I can put me I could put
[58:53] myself there certainly I can say Lord
[58:56] remember me Lord remember me in my
[58:58] condition and I'm not just talking
[59:00] physically because this old body will
[59:02] get sick again and die so as much as we
[59:04] you desire divine healing and we
[59:06] certainly appreciate it you know that's
[59:08] not the kind of healing we ought to be
[59:09] looking for at this time as although we
[59:11] still pray for it and we still confess
[59:13] it but there's a healing of the soul
[59:15] because the rapture is upon us that
[59:17] final coming together is upon us that's
[59:19] final lifting up and I believe as we
[59:21] read this little quote it says the
[59:23] redeeming power that's laying ready
[59:26] laying ready he's not gonna prepare it
[59:29] when you ask him it's already laying
[59:30] there ready to what pick you up at any
[59:35] time that you are ready to receive it
[59:38] brother that thief on the cross proved
[59:41] it to us she's like a man drowning
[59:45] there's a rope hanging there and he
[59:47] thinks well the rope I could pull myself
[59:49] out but I'm not worthy to get the rope
[59:51] since the Rope was put there for that
[59:53] very purpose
[59:54] for you to pull yourself out there since
[59:57] that's the reason Jesus Christ died for
[59:59] the purpose of saving sinners and he
[1:00:04] dangled the robe of eternal life which
[1:00:07] this very night will pass over every
[1:00:11] sinner's head in here if you just heard
[1:00:16] this or if you've listened to this tape
[1:00:18] or you just casually perhaps sitting
[1:00:22] listening in today it's passing over
[1:00:25] your head right now passing over your
[1:00:29] head what a rope of eternal life and not
[1:00:33] just casually watch it says and a
[1:00:35] welcome sign hanging on it a welcome
[1:00:39] sign hanging on it it's for you if
[1:00:42] there's a tug in your heart if there's
[1:00:44] the slightest desire to go in the
[1:00:46] rapture if there's a slightest desire to
[1:00:48] be like Christ there is a Christ here
[1:00:51] that's doing that drawing that's what it
[1:00:53] means to have that desire pretty soon
[1:00:56] it'll be over not a single person will
[1:00:59] desire Christ any more oh they will he
[1:01:01] met they will they will desire their
[1:01:03] imaginings they will desire their form
[1:01:05] and their tradition and their loyalties
[1:01:07] and their ministers and their Pope's and
[1:01:09] bishops they'll desire that but not
[1:01:11] Christ Christ is the Holy Ghost and the
[1:01:13] Holy Ghost wrote the word you've got
[1:01:16] some other kind of a ghost if you can't
[1:01:17] agree with the Word of God so there's a
[1:01:22] welcome sign hanging on what does it say
[1:01:24] come up out of it come up out of
[1:01:27] depression come up out of any situation
[1:01:31] you're in there's a way out there's a
[1:01:33] rope there's a there's a I believe a an
[1:01:37] Easter for you and a welcome mat from
[1:01:41] God and power to raise you up says if
[1:01:44] you wish to do it the preparation is
[1:01:46] made the preparation is made now I can
[1:01:50] tell you that goes for every situation
[1:01:52] in life there's nothing we have to put
[1:01:55] up with from the devil no sir because he
[1:01:59] is defeated he was defeated and that
[1:02:00] proof of that resurrection we carry
[1:02:03] within ourselves today now Jesus God
[1:02:07] came
[1:02:08] from the celestial down to the
[1:02:10] terrestrial from heaven to earth why to
[1:02:13] lift earth back to heaven to lift that
[1:02:16] Sun cursed life and you can not find a
[1:02:19] better example of somebody who was down
[1:02:22] and out who was hopeless who had no
[1:02:24] merit who had nothing that he could
[1:02:26] present at all nothing at all but
[1:02:30] completely depending on the mercy of God
[1:02:32] and you can say well is there somebody
[1:02:35] who merits anything in God's presence no
[1:02:37] sir I believe every human being from
[1:02:40] Adam down to the last baby born in
[1:02:42] Laodicea stands before God in the same
[1:02:45] situation as that man on the cross and
[1:02:46] you know what that should make a shout
[1:02:48] because as soon as we can cry remember
[1:02:51] me Lord we have the mercy of God to
[1:02:53] reply back today you will be with me in
[1:02:55] paradise this is a church member this is
[1:02:58] now in Jehovah Jireh the church member
[1:03:02] come to Christ says and stay until he's
[1:03:05] filled with the Holy Ghost it's the only
[1:03:07] it's the only promise of the rapture I
[1:03:11] hope you understand that the only
[1:03:13] promise of the rapture is what the Holy
[1:03:15] Ghost right not study not understanding
[1:03:19] not so-called revelation not dedication
[1:03:22] not loyalty the Holy Ghost the only way
[1:03:28] that the church and Christ can come
[1:03:30] together the very spirit the very spirit
[1:03:33] does when God made his first man in the
[1:03:36] Garden of Eden did you notice he made
[1:03:39] him both male and female now of course
[1:03:42] there's the mystery Paul speaks about a
[1:03:44] mystery when he talks about marriage and
[1:03:46] the coming together the union of those
[1:03:49] two spirits sort of two Spurs as really
[1:03:53] it's one spirit just a male and a female
[1:03:55] part he made him male and female he was
[1:03:59] man made in God's image
[1:04:01] a spirit he put him in flesh Genesis the
[1:04:05] next chapter after he already made him
[1:04:08] male and female and there still was no
[1:04:10] man to till the soil so so then he
[1:04:13] created man out of the dust of the earth
[1:04:17] not in his image
[1:04:20] the flesh man is not in the image of God
[1:04:23] because God is a spirit not in His image
[1:04:28] but then God came down in the form of
[1:04:30] man by Jesus Christ to redeem the man
[1:04:34] that fell from the image of the earth
[1:04:36] had to become that very cursed thing
[1:04:39] that he that he cursed he had to become
[1:04:41] it he had to become his own curse but
[1:04:47] you see the story doesn't stop there
[1:04:49] Easter doesn't stop on Golgotha Easter
[1:04:52] doesn't stop on Calvary's Hill Easter
[1:04:55] doesn't stop in the regions of the lost
[1:04:57] Easter goes right down to that morning
[1:05:00] where he the where the stone was rolled
[1:05:02] away and and that life that had
[1:05:05] triumphed over every device of the enemy
[1:05:08] that had robbed the devil of any
[1:05:10] authority that he had any any power that
[1:05:13] he had till he could only become a bluff
[1:05:16] that life stepping out of the tomb on
[1:05:20] Easter morning
[1:05:21] that's the completion of the story and
[1:05:23] not quite why he says the completion
[1:05:25] there but we know that some time later
[1:05:27] they were gathered in the upper room and
[1:05:29] they received the dividends of Easter
[1:05:31] right there God came to redeem the man
[1:05:38] it fell from the image of the earth and
[1:05:39] wasn't he was made in the image of the
[1:05:41] earth he's oh god can't you see what the
[1:05:44] gospel means when God became man's a man
[1:05:46] became God there was the transaction on
[1:05:49] Calvary's Hill there was the comparison
[1:05:52] between the life of Christ and the life
[1:05:55] of a nothing and no good a criminal why
[1:06:01] would God die for that man see there's
[1:06:04] your mystery why would God died for that
[1:06:07] man because he was the son of God and
[1:06:10] say wait a minute just wait a minute
[1:06:13] here a life of disgrace a life of sin
[1:06:17] and here no altar call no church
[1:06:22] affiliation no fivefold minister no
[1:06:26] teaching no instruction no tearing in an
[1:06:32] upper room
[1:06:33] in its deserved dying Agony's that life
[1:06:38] can be transformed by the spoken word of
[1:06:41] God yes sir absolutely
[1:06:44] see we can't limit God and when we look
[1:06:47] at what Jesus did for that man and that
[1:06:49] example you know you'll meet him at the
[1:06:52] wedding supper he'll be there yes sir
[1:06:55] he will be there and here you know this
[1:06:57] quote I read a little while ago here
[1:06:58] from the message of grace and I really
[1:07:00] really love it I'm gonna repeat it for
[1:07:01] you for the offer for tonight first
[1:07:06] paragraph 133 brother Brennan says he
[1:07:09] can take the vilest sinner and make him
[1:07:11] white as snow his don't have to ask he's
[1:07:15] talking about Sovereign Grace don't have
[1:07:18] to ask anybody about it
[1:07:21] right we want to set conditions even
[1:07:24] baptism well the man wasn't baptized
[1:07:28] how can he be regenerated remember
[1:07:30] baptism is justice showing what's
[1:07:33] already taken place on the inside it's
[1:07:36] something outward a lot of people who
[1:07:38] get baptized won't make it because they
[1:07:40] just got baptized there was no
[1:07:41] regeneration in the soul and look how
[1:07:44] quickly that regeneration took place and
[1:07:46] it was good enough to take him from his
[1:07:50] hellish existence
[1:07:52] he's capital punishment and put him in
[1:07:55] Tara dies in a moment how about a
[1:07:59] friend's one little cry of the heart
[1:08:01] what will it do to God how can it move
[1:08:04] God on your behalf and he spoke back and
[1:08:10] what has God done for you he's broadcast
[1:08:12] a whole message
[1:08:13] he's broadcast a whole message put it in
[1:08:18] your lap and all you have to do insist
[1:08:20] is say Lord yes it's me it's mine what
[1:08:25] you said here it's about me you're
[1:08:28] talking about me I receive it that way
[1:08:31] I received the pardon I receive all
[1:08:33] these beautiful things that you've laid
[1:08:35] out for us and made so plain in this
[1:08:37] hour I receive the supernatural I
[1:08:39] receive what you've done for me I
[1:08:42] believe is a present tense God and when
[1:08:45] we look at this thief on the cross we
[1:08:46] look
[1:08:47] this man and all the things that he had
[1:08:48] to go through I believe that same Jesus
[1:08:51] is right here where you are in your
[1:08:54] living room or around the kitchen table
[1:08:56] somewhere or maybe sitting outside if
[1:08:58] it's good weather I don't know where you
[1:09:00] are but God knows where you are he knew
[1:09:03] where this man was his entire life and
[1:09:04] he knew where he would end up and he
[1:09:06] knew the cry would come from his heart
[1:09:08] and he had an answer prepared for him
[1:09:10] what about us don't you think he has an
[1:09:13] answer prepared for you you say Lord I'm
[1:09:15] sick and I can't get well he says I have
[1:09:17] an answer for you I am the Lord who
[1:09:20] healeth thee by my stripes you are
[1:09:23] healed Lord I need a change of nature I
[1:09:27] need a change of desire I've been trying
[1:09:29] to be a Christian for so long and he
[1:09:32] said if you repent and you're baptized
[1:09:34] in my name for the remission of your sin
[1:09:40] you shall receive a change of nature you
[1:09:42] shall receive that spirit it'll sweep
[1:09:44] your right into the rapture sure you
[1:09:47] will that's the kind of God we're
[1:09:49] talking about it can take the vilest
[1:09:51] sinner make him white as snow don't have
[1:09:54] to ask anybody about it says oh if I it
[1:09:57] can do it because it's sovereign so
[1:09:59] listen quickly now that was proved at
[1:10:01] the cross when there was the vilest
[1:10:03] thief he deserved to die
[1:10:05] God had never come across his mind see
[1:10:09] there's the quote I talked about earlier
[1:10:10] God had never come across his mind never
[1:10:15] he had lived his entire life in
[1:10:18] selfishness in vain in criminal
[1:10:22] activities never thought about God never
[1:10:27] thought nothing of it since then there
[1:10:29] on the cross went through those bloody
[1:10:31] lips in between the groans there came a
[1:10:33] sound Lord be merciful to me and there
[1:10:40] came another cuz there came another one
[1:10:43] back through the blood and the tears and
[1:10:45] the agony and grace took ahold and said
[1:10:47] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[1:10:49] grace did that how could that thief help
[1:10:52] himself
[1:10:53] how could he and you know what there's
[1:10:55] not a human being on earth in a better
[1:10:58] position than that thief
[1:11:00] not a human being I don't care how good
[1:11:03] you've been
[1:11:03] how many Sunday School classes you you
[1:11:06] took how many how many hours you spent
[1:11:09] listening or reading the Bible how many
[1:11:11] hours days you sat in the church how
[1:11:14] many testimonies you've given whatever
[1:11:16] you've done you're no better in no
[1:11:19] better position when it comes to the
[1:11:22] mercies of God and that thief's mercy
[1:11:24] cannot be deserved it cannot be earned
[1:11:26] grace means that you can't there is
[1:11:33] there's no way for you to deserve it
[1:11:36] grace means it's beyond what you can
[1:11:41] earn remember the Bible talks about the
[1:11:43] wages of sin is death you work for sin
[1:11:45] but the free gift of God the free gift
[1:11:47] of God grace did that says but the grace
[1:11:52] of God can do something about it and it
[1:11:55] does it's the grace of God the
[1:11:56] sovereignty of the grace of God come to
[1:11:58] their dying thief today shalt thou be
[1:12:00] with me in paradise think of it that's
[1:12:02] wonderful
[1:12:04] what happened there you see there was a
[1:12:07] reflection of God the reflection of what
[1:12:10] God told Eve in the garden that the seed
[1:12:13] of the woman would bruise the head of
[1:12:15] the serpent that reflection of God typed
[1:12:17] through every Old Testament shadow was
[1:12:20] right there on Calvary's Hill expressing
[1:12:23] the heart purpose of God right there so
[1:12:26] of course he caught it of course there
[1:12:28] was a silent cry going out on Golgotha
[1:12:31] hill he didn't have to preach a sermon
[1:12:33] he didn't have to do anything but the
[1:12:35] expression of God's love was so great
[1:12:38] till it redeemed that man lifted the
[1:12:41] veil for him and made him recognize who
[1:12:44] this was oh goodness now who do you say
[1:12:48] this is that's the question who do you
[1:12:51] say this endtime word is hmm just some
[1:12:56] religious movement oh the tying up of
[1:12:59] loose ends a code of conduct a burden of
[1:13:02] rules a lifestyle a tradition of
[1:13:04] fanaticism a cult what do you say about
[1:13:07] it who do you say this is that they've
[1:13:10] crucified in the 20th century that
[1:13:12] they've turned out
[1:13:14] their churches a religious persecution
[1:13:18] what is it all those things I mentioned
[1:13:22] or do you find there's a there's a cry
[1:13:24] there's a call there's a voice coming
[1:13:27] through all this it's the bridegroom's
[1:13:29] voice in the evening time the Bible
[1:13:32] tells us today if you will hear his
[1:13:34] voice harden not your heart
[1:13:36] certainly when that thief saw the
[1:13:38] reflection of God saw the redemptive
[1:13:40] grace of God on the gall gothis heal
[1:13:42] something answered in him and he cried
[1:13:44] out and remember doesn't take a big cry
[1:13:46] it doesn't take a long prayer it doesn't
[1:13:49] take a long begging for mercy all he did
[1:13:51] was say three words remember me Lord
[1:13:54] remember me Lord brother Branham says
[1:13:58] this because what happened there that
[1:14:00] entire that entire group of people who
[1:14:03] made up of all the different just too
[1:14:05] curious yeah the ones who were
[1:14:07] congratulating themselves so they got
[1:14:09] rid of this pest the Roman law the
[1:14:11] soldiers all those people standing
[1:14:13] around what did they see
[1:14:15] didn't recognize what was happening
[1:14:17] there and recognized the presence of God
[1:14:20] and recognized where the brown says I
[1:14:22] love this quote I use it often now when
[1:14:23] he's not recognized he Pat his power is
[1:14:26] always not revealed when he is not
[1:14:30] recognized he says no matter how much
[1:14:33] God is standing present you've got to
[1:14:36] believe it you've got to believe it
[1:14:39] there must be a deep there must be an
[1:14:41] echo there must be something happening
[1:14:42] in your heart and that thief expressed
[1:14:45] it when he called him Lord Lord he
[1:14:50] recognized him he recognized that that
[1:14:52] was God's sacrifice that was the Lamb of
[1:14:55] God on that tree on that cross
[1:14:58] he's like the woman with a bloody shoe
[1:15:01] says all them people were passing by all
[1:15:03] of them standing up saying there goes
[1:15:09] the rabbi
[1:15:14] that's the guy that claims to be a
[1:15:16] prophet this is the fanatic all things
[1:15:18] like that but what happened this little
[1:15:19] woman had an issue of blood and she had
[1:15:21] heard about him cousin when she come
[1:15:24] down there regardless of what anybody
[1:15:28] said she recognized who he was
[1:15:31] she recognized who he was see now he was
[1:15:34] veiled and he was veiled on Calvary and
[1:15:37] he was that was God dying for you God
[1:15:42] dying for me veiled in a human being
[1:15:45] veiled in a frail body that people
[1:15:47] couldn't recognize and couldn't make fun
[1:15:49] of how could God stand being made fun
[1:15:52] off see they've got no idea what
[1:15:53] greatness is they got no idea what power
[1:15:55] is but here she was she had recognized
[1:15:59] him God had lifted the veil for her it
[1:16:02] was not just a good man or a rabbi or a
[1:16:04] teacher or an impostor or whatever that
[1:16:07] was God there was power of healing power
[1:16:09] of life in that man and you know what
[1:16:12] she could she didn't even touch his body
[1:16:13] she just touched the hem of His garment
[1:16:17] wow what a revelation I wonder if we can
[1:16:21] catch that same revelation today and she
[1:16:25] said if I can only touch His garment see
[1:16:27] doesn't win that genuine faith in God
[1:16:30] became a positive thing to her what did
[1:16:36] it release now look at this it released
[1:16:39] his power to heal her what did it
[1:16:42] release for the thief on the cross you
[1:16:44] could say she touched him in such a way
[1:16:46] he turned around and told her what was
[1:16:48] wrong with her and said your faith has
[1:16:49] saved you
[1:16:50] what did faith but look what he her
[1:16:54] touch brought words out of him and he
[1:17:02] declared her healing right there your
[1:17:04] faith has saved you your faith what is
[1:17:08] faith a revelation an unveiling
[1:17:12] that's what revelation is God unveiling
[1:17:14] to you and if God can unveil to you that
[1:17:17] you're not just sitting listening to a
[1:17:19] sermon today that he is in his word and
[1:17:23] he's the Holy Spirit is here to quicken
[1:17:25] that word to every heart that will say
[1:17:27] remain
[1:17:28] for me if God can unveil himself to you
[1:17:33] like that not a preacher not a prophet
[1:17:36] but God Himself in the form of the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost in the word that he has bless you
[1:17:41] with that he's put in your language and
[1:17:43] in your lap and in your home and in your
[1:17:47] heart I believe that's the very God it's
[1:17:50] not principles it's not rules its power
[1:17:53] it's somebody that is here to heal you
[1:17:57] to lift you up to raise you up to put
[1:17:59] you in paradise in a moment well we know
[1:18:02] we're not looking for paradise anymore
[1:18:06] now that man recognized that thief
[1:18:09] recognized that was he was in the
[1:18:11] presence of God the Redeemer and it's
[1:18:13] released that recognition released the
[1:18:15] power of God to save him it brought him
[1:18:19] back to his rightful position there was
[1:18:22] no condition to it the condition was
[1:18:25] only if you can see me remember what the
[1:18:27] Prophet told Elijah if you can see me
[1:18:30] when I go you can have your request the
[1:18:35] power that I have will be released to
[1:18:38] you and that's exactly what God has
[1:18:41] brought for us in this endtime message I
[1:18:43] believe you can look beyond the frailty
[1:18:45] of a man from Kentucky with bad grammar
[1:18:47] if you if you can look beyond the the
[1:18:51] critics and and the agnostics and all
[1:18:54] the clever people who's trying to
[1:18:56] explain it all away and can bring all
[1:18:58] kinds of criticisms for whatever reason
[1:19:02] if you could look beyond that and see
[1:19:03] well why is this that happened in our
[1:19:05] day it releases the power of what God
[1:19:08] sent it for that word becomes life in
[1:19:11] you Jesus came down and he lifted me up
[1:19:13] how does Jesus come down friends in the
[1:19:16] form of the Holy Ghost you say but not
[1:19:18] just the Holy Ghost in sensation but the
[1:19:19] Holy Ghost who is the quickened word
[1:19:22] it's got to be able to quicken something
[1:19:24] now the blackness of his seemingly
[1:19:27] cursed life that man was transformed in
[1:19:30] a moment he could look away from his
[1:19:32] pain he could look away from his
[1:19:34] condemnation you could look away from
[1:19:36] his sin from his dark destination where
[1:19:38] he was going and only the words of
[1:19:40] Redeemer mattered now all that mattered
[1:19:43] now was that little line that Jesus
[1:19:45] spoke nothing else mattered he didn't
[1:19:49] have to go study ten years to make a
[1:19:50] rapture he was there he was in there
[1:19:53] spoken in there by the very words of God
[1:19:56] and what happened in our day friends is
[1:19:59] God bypasses the intellect entirely and
[1:20:02] God's voice speaking over you places you
[1:20:05] in the rapture places you there because
[1:20:08] that's his picture for now that's his
[1:20:10] desire for now the same as he had a
[1:20:12] picture of a man dying on a cross next
[1:20:15] to him Queen of Sheba 90/60 says now if
[1:20:17] God would answer Jonah's prayer under
[1:20:22] those conditions looking towards a
[1:20:24] temple that a man made that was the
[1:20:26] conditions say well that was sons God's
[1:20:28] instructions yeah it was still a
[1:20:29] man-made temple and God would answer his
[1:20:33] prayer looking towards that temple where
[1:20:36] a man prayed a man made it a man prayed
[1:20:38] a temple where there was a mercy seat it
[1:20:40] was overshadowed with a blood of a sheep
[1:20:43] how much more will he today when we look
[1:20:49] away from our symptoms look away from
[1:20:53] our symptoms our crippled condition our
[1:20:56] cancer our tumour or whatever we have or
[1:20:59] our sin and look to the throne of God
[1:21:02] where Jesus stands at the right hand of
[1:21:04] the Majesty with his own blood to make
[1:21:06] intercession upon our confession Wow
[1:21:10] isn't that what the man saw right there
[1:21:12] the mercy seat of God on the cross sure
[1:21:16] and just the smallest approach the
[1:21:19] smallest request the smallest cry from
[1:21:21] his heart made that mercy seat operative
[1:21:24] for him what about us when Jesus is the
[1:21:27] same what about us today when we're
[1:21:29] sitting with this problem where that
[1:21:31] need won't the mercy seat act in the
[1:21:33] same way if we have a cry in our hearts
[1:21:35] remember me Lord just forget your
[1:21:39] symptoms just as long as you look at
[1:21:42] your hand and say it's twisted it'll
[1:21:44] always be twisted I refuse to look at it
[1:21:47] anymore I look to the Holy Temple Oh
[1:21:50] Lord I remember what the Holy Temple is
[1:21:52] that's the body
[1:21:54] I'm telling you something will get sick
[1:21:56] Satan will when you go to beginning like
[1:21:58] that sure when it make Satan sick you
[1:22:01] want to make him sick of you sick of the
[1:22:03] bride
[1:22:04] so just telling them like you did the
[1:22:05] children of Israel take your stuff and
[1:22:07] go just leave take whatever you want
[1:22:10] take your family members take whatever
[1:22:13] you're claiming just can't stand you
[1:22:15] anymore
[1:22:16] make him sick how by looking looking at
[1:22:20] what that thief saw on the cross that
[1:22:22] day Oh God open our spiritual eyes now
[1:22:25] where do I hear that voice today you may
[1:22:27] ask in conferences 1961 Susan we know
[1:22:32] that the time is near at hand we see the
[1:22:37] world in a quivering shaking condition
[1:22:39] right we just have dress rehearsal now
[1:22:42] talk about viruses as paralyzed the
[1:22:45] world hundred and eighty-six countries
[1:22:46] and lockdown for how long nobody knows
[1:22:50] dress rehearsal just the beginning of
[1:22:54] Sorrows just a little toothache compared
[1:22:56] to what's coming because we know that
[1:22:58] the time is near at hand now God's
[1:22:59] already spoken it we see the world in a
[1:23:03] quivering shaking condition knowing that
[1:23:04] the atoms will soon be burning the
[1:23:07] atomists and the heavens will be on fire
[1:23:09] as the Apostle Peter said and will burn
[1:23:12] with fervent heat the atoms of the earth
[1:23:14] will catch fire soon there will be a
[1:23:17] relay and there will be not even dust
[1:23:19] left of the people now that's the left
[1:23:21] something to bury they won't even be
[1:23:23] dust left of the people sitting then
[1:23:26] what Lord said maybe 500 years from now
[1:23:31] an old tombstone blown over yonder in
[1:23:33] the howling winds the burning blistering
[1:23:35] Sun when it lays near the Sun for its
[1:23:37] purification before the millennium maybe
[1:23:40] the name of the some of the people here
[1:23:42] will be written on that where will their
[1:23:44] wandering soul be since may they not
[1:23:48] look to this modern world now but may
[1:23:51] they look away to Christ listen to the
[1:23:54] message and the messenger that's
[1:23:55] speaking in their heart so where's the
[1:23:58] voice speaking it spoke off the cross of
[1:24:01] Calvary it said today you'll be with me
[1:24:03] in paradise what is the voice saying to
[1:24:06] you today via the messy
[1:24:08] the messenger that's speaking we're in
[1:24:10] your ears no you can hear it a hundred
[1:24:13] hundred hours of it and never make a
[1:24:15] difference to your life
[1:24:16] if it speaks in your heart there was a
[1:24:19] communication happening on Calvary
[1:24:21] there's a communication happening
[1:24:23] between God the Redeemer and every
[1:24:25] believers heart oh my what does it do
[1:24:30] transports you translates you raptures
[1:24:33] you new heights you know the word the
[1:24:39] kingdom of God is the word of God turned
[1:24:41] into power the word of god turned into
[1:24:43] power
[1:24:44] that's my new heights the power of God
[1:24:46] and we are still being transformed by
[1:24:48] the voice of God the same as that voice
[1:24:51] of Jesus placed that man in paradise the
[1:24:54] same voice of God speaking today on the
[1:24:56] earth that same Holy Ghost still
[1:24:57] speaking through the messenger through
[1:25:00] the message to every believers heart
[1:25:02] placing us where we ought to be he says
[1:25:06] this is comes from greater than Solomon
[1:25:07] is here 61 it says when he told
[1:25:09] Nathanael there that day I said I saw
[1:25:12] you before you were under or when you
[1:25:15] were under the fig tree I saw you
[1:25:17] Nathanael being an ordained man to
[1:25:19] eternal life I like that part
[1:25:21] Nathanael like that thief on the cross
[1:25:24] being an ordained man to or to eternal
[1:25:27] life that means to me you know what that
[1:25:29] means he could wiggle he could squirm he
[1:25:32] could run he could do whatever he wanted
[1:25:34] to do he could backslide as far as the
[1:25:36] moons from the Sun and he couldn't dodge
[1:25:39] it he couldn't dodge it because he was
[1:25:43] ordained to eternal life when God
[1:25:46] ordained something that thief on the
[1:25:49] cross couldn't live a life bad enough to
[1:25:51] disqualify him from that phrase that
[1:25:56] line that Jesus was going to say about
[1:25:58] him my now watch here is Nathanael being
[1:26:07] an ordained man to eternal life he said
[1:26:09] rabbi thou art the Son of God what
[1:26:11] happens the king of Israel the veil
[1:26:13] lifts for Nathaniel since he said
[1:26:16] blessed art thou same thing he said to
[1:26:19] Simon
[1:26:21] since why since because I told you this
[1:26:24] about the fig tree you believed you can
[1:26:29] see greater things than this now what
[1:26:32] he's talking about discernment
[1:26:35] but he says greater things because you
[1:26:39] could see the discernment must be God
[1:26:42] because you have that ear you're going
[1:26:45] to see greater things now just watch
[1:26:47] this this is because I told you this you
[1:26:52] believe you can see greater things he's
[1:26:54] ready then to move on up into another
[1:26:58] sphere you ever thought of that
[1:27:01] to see he's ready then to move on up
[1:27:04] into another sphere as soon as he he'd
[1:27:06] see greater things said you'd be able to
[1:27:08] see the angels descending and ascending
[1:27:10] upon the Son of Man now he can look into
[1:27:13] the spiritual realm not just see an
[1:27:17] earthly sign performed and say that's
[1:27:19] God because he could do that there was a
[1:27:22] higher realm for him
[1:27:24] that would open up and what about us
[1:27:26] friends you can see the God the same
[1:27:29] Jesus Christ manifest himself through
[1:27:31] the Prophet and what happens another
[1:27:33] realm opens up to you a higher realm a
[1:27:36] higher reality and you can look into
[1:27:38] spiritual places as cross he was coming
[1:27:42] into higher heights higher heights is
[1:27:44] not a carrot in front of a donkey okay
[1:27:47] higher heights is meant for you because
[1:27:51] you've been ordained for it in fact the
[1:27:54] highest of heights is just around the
[1:27:55] corner
[1:27:56] when these vile old bodies change in a
[1:27:58] moment in a twinkling of an eye hmm
[1:28:01] higher heights said if you now look how
[1:28:05] illustrates it says of you
[1:28:07] that's just accepted Christ by
[1:28:09] justification accept him by
[1:28:12] sanctification and clean up your life he
[1:28:14] says you're still smoking watch what
[1:28:16] happens how much different says you look
[1:28:19] back to justification oh you were just
[1:28:21] standing justified and never received
[1:28:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost say step
[1:28:26] up step up into that sphere what is that
[1:28:34] sphere it's not me
[1:28:35] nation so much it's what God said about
[1:28:37] you the sphere heaven consists of the
[1:28:41] word if you're going to look into the
[1:28:42] word what does he say about me Wow what
[1:28:47] does he say about me that if I repent if
[1:28:51] I turn around I'm baptized
[1:28:52] I shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:28:54] Ghost there's no if or maybe about it
[1:28:56] there's a shell there's a definite
[1:28:57] there's an assurance that's the realm
[1:29:00] the sphere you need to step into it
[1:29:04] doesn't then look back down at the rest
[1:29:06] of it see and says just keep walking
[1:29:08] after a while you get so light you can
[1:29:11] just walk on up in the rapture I believe
[1:29:14] that's where we are supposed to be drop
[1:29:16] all these things that are so important
[1:29:18] that have suddenly become so unimportant
[1:29:21] my goodness you still had hopes to pay
[1:29:24] off that mortgage you still had hopes of
[1:29:25] reaching a retirement you stud hopes of
[1:29:27] this in the hopes of that forget it all
[1:29:29] get lighter get rid of these things
[1:29:32] that's bogging you down these memories
[1:29:35] and these old habits and things it's not
[1:29:36] why because you're free from those
[1:29:38] things if you look at God's Word if you
[1:29:40] look at what Easter really means that
[1:29:43] that quickening spurt drowsing you now
[1:29:45] you can get light enough to walk on up
[1:29:48] in the rapture says we used to sing an
[1:29:50] old song each day brings me one around a
[1:29:52] higher higher see that's what we ought
[1:29:54] to do never build the same fire on the
[1:29:55] grounds the second night just keep
[1:29:58] climbing higher higher you know God's
[1:30:02] checklist
[1:30:03] God has a checklist - yeah sure that
[1:30:06] upward progression it always goes up and
[1:30:08] up and up when he started with Luther
[1:30:10] and the Reformation he staff started
[1:30:12] down there and he always follows the
[1:30:14] same pattern you want to see the pattern
[1:30:16] quickly the pattern is for the life of
[1:30:18] the individual as well here's the
[1:30:20] pattern he says this in the message only
[1:30:22] belief he says only belief only believe
[1:30:25] he's coming soon he brought Abraham
[1:30:27] justified him sanctified him going
[1:30:30] higher filled him with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:32] what Abraham yes sir
[1:30:34] placed him as his son showed himself
[1:30:37] alive we're talking about higher and
[1:30:41] higher now right by turning his back and
[1:30:46] talking there's your discernment
[1:30:48] give him sorry telling what Sarah said
[1:30:52] in the tent and then changed his body
[1:30:54] there's the last little step the highest
[1:30:57] step we go to right changing of the body
[1:31:00] that's what's next on the program why
[1:31:02] because we've already seen him alive
[1:31:04] turning his back to the audience and
[1:31:08] telling us who that was and what they
[1:31:12] thought huh
[1:31:13] so where are we at the last last little
[1:31:18] step the changing of the body
[1:31:20] sure he says justified sanctified filled
[1:31:24] with the Holy Ghost placed as a son
[1:31:27] coming among us now showing himself
[1:31:30] alive that's history friends and waiting
[1:31:34] for the change of the body mm-hmm God's
[1:31:37] checklist is complete
[1:31:39] there's nothing regarding his bride it
[1:31:41] still needs to be checked off say well
[1:31:43] and then them coming into some sort of
[1:31:46] perfection know the perfection was done
[1:31:48] at Calvary friend if we can accept it if
[1:31:52] we can accept it then we are perfected
[1:31:56] because by one sacrifice he perfected
[1:31:59] forever so there's no adding that we do
[1:32:02] there's no we say well we need to become
[1:32:04] more mature yeah how are you going to do
[1:32:06] that see there's nothing for you to do
[1:32:09] here there's no step for you to add
[1:32:11] there's no amount of dedication that
[1:32:14] there's nothing for the thief on the
[1:32:15] cross to add to get him into paradise it
[1:32:19] was just a cry just a desire just a deep
[1:32:22] calling out and if you have a desire for
[1:32:25] this old body to change for what so you
[1:32:27] can escape this world so you can escape
[1:32:29] pain yeah sure those things are there
[1:32:32] but the greatest thing is to glorify God
[1:32:34] to fulfill that scripture that speaks
[1:32:36] about you that he wrote before there was
[1:32:38] a world about you personally there's a
[1:32:41] line there's a well actually there are
[1:32:44] quite a few lines there are a few lines
[1:32:46] that he's waiting to say about you just
[1:32:48] as soon as you're ready to cry here in
[1:32:54] Abraham and his seed after him I'm just
[1:32:57] about through Abraham and his seed after
[1:32:59] him he says but the next thing
[1:33:03] the next thing for the church is to be
[1:33:06] changed we've had every sign and now
[1:33:10] look at the signs is giving
[1:33:11] justification
[1:33:12] we're under Luther already
[1:33:14] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:33:17] Spirit placing of a son saying the same
[1:33:19] things here manifestation of the Spirit
[1:33:23] okay that wasn't you there was on the
[1:33:26] profit that was discernment that was the
[1:33:28] sign of a present tense Jesus Christ so
[1:33:32] you can quit trying to manifest nothing
[1:33:34] this is now what the changing of the
[1:33:36] body for the rapture there's your
[1:33:38] manifestation
[1:33:39] there's your manifestation and I would
[1:33:41] like to ask you with tears in my eyes
[1:33:43] just how much can you contribute towards
[1:33:46] that well you can see the parallel of
[1:33:50] the thief on the cross we have nothing
[1:33:52] to contribute except to cry remember me
[1:33:58] Lord remember me hmm
[1:34:03] changing of the body for the rapture
[1:34:05] says oh my here's our attitude right now
[1:34:07] what do you care what can you do what
[1:34:08] can I do brother this is how the church
[1:34:11] ought to be waving its hands in glory
[1:34:13] it says thanking God thanking God any
[1:34:16] minute the change could come oh brother
[1:34:20] what do you care about the finances and
[1:34:23] whether your bank is going this way in
[1:34:25] your house is going that way and you
[1:34:27] don't if you're gonna have food tomorrow
[1:34:28] so what the change can come any moment
[1:34:32] any moment that's where my hope is
[1:34:35] that's where my joy is that's where my
[1:34:37] expectation is here's something
[1:34:41] beautiful why do we have this gentle
[1:34:44] squeeze of this whole story coming on us
[1:34:46] and it's a very very gentle squeeze very
[1:34:51] gentle here's something that might tell
[1:34:53] you there's a little season of quiet a
[1:34:57] little season of quiet a moment brother
[1:35:01] Branham says to hold steady and many
[1:35:04] people have that just before they
[1:35:06] received the Holy Ghost there's a little
[1:35:08] season just listen to this this comes
[1:35:10] from oneness he says here we are in the
[1:35:13] end time coming from the east and west
[1:35:16] north and south what are we doing
[1:35:18] getting ready for that rapture since
[1:35:21] getting ready says holding ourselves
[1:35:24] steady for a few minutes just a few
[1:35:28] minutes till every fiber is filled with
[1:35:31] the Holy Ghost then she'll go up then
[1:35:35] she'll go up how do you how do you know
[1:35:39] that this time wasn't ordained by God so
[1:35:42] we can hold steady for a few minutes
[1:35:45] till every fiber now you say well I'm
[1:35:47] filled with the Holy Ghost yeah but what
[1:35:49] about your wife what about your husband
[1:35:51] what about your kids what about grandpa
[1:35:53] maybe they're not filled so we're
[1:35:56] holding steady for them so everybody
[1:35:58] every fiber of the whole body of Christ
[1:36:00] not just your body can be filled with
[1:36:03] the Holy Ghost then she'll go up for
[1:36:06] sure this oh my calling his people
[1:36:09] together to himself not to a church not
[1:36:12] to a minister not to a name to himself
[1:36:16] right in the true oneness with himself
[1:36:19] because it's his one Holy Spirit one
[1:36:23] Holy Spirit the body of Christ cannot be
[1:36:26] divided has one spirit in it now he
[1:36:32] remembers his promise if you can hear
[1:36:35] and receive that's what he said John
[1:36:38] 5:24 if you can hear his voice and
[1:36:41] receive you are free from judgment and
[1:36:45] that judgment I have good news for you
[1:36:47] and I'm gonna read you the quote quickly
[1:36:49] from the endtime evangelism is present
[1:36:51] that judgment and future judgment all
[1:36:54] judgment it's praying at the end of
[1:36:58] endtime evangelism maybe I think i'ma
[1:37:01] ask you where you are if you're in the
[1:37:03] lounge somewhere around the kitchen
[1:37:05] table wherever you are today I'm gonna
[1:37:07] ask you just to stand with me while I
[1:37:10] read this and you can read it on the
[1:37:11] screen there with me he says and I pray
[1:37:16] father that this very day that you'll
[1:37:19] take into your kingdom into your
[1:37:21] fellowship here on earth every one of
[1:37:24] these believers and be kind to them
[1:37:27] Jesus you said
[1:37:29] you were here on earth in st. John 5:24
[1:37:32] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:37:35] him that sent me has eternal life and
[1:37:39] shall not come to the judgment they'll
[1:37:43] not be there when the judgment strikes
[1:37:46] the earth right won't come to the
[1:37:49] judgment don't you fear anything that's
[1:37:51] happening don't you fear how much they
[1:37:53] clamp down how much Big Brother's
[1:37:55] looking over your shoulder all of a
[1:37:56] sudden it doesn't matter the promise of
[1:37:59] God stands true today and we are praying
[1:38:02] with a prophet here that every person
[1:38:04] will come into that fellowship and do
[1:38:05] that assurance that you will not be here
[1:38:08] when judgment strikes this is not
[1:38:10] judgment yet it's a toothache it's a
[1:38:13] little thing compared to judgment when
[1:38:16] judgment comes they'll beg to be buried
[1:38:19] but they've passed from death unto life
[1:38:22] you promised it Lord I claim them I
[1:38:25] claim them now what do you see around
