years or nine years ago so time flies so fast but I certainly uh consider a privilege to be here again and for the invitation of our dear brother brother Al appreciate his friendship and his confidence he he made us feel so welcome and uh I'm glad that uh this time my wife was able to come with me she's quite excited she really really enjoys the New Zealand and all the sceneries and the landscape it is so amazing got to see my Canadian friend brother Chris we visit today his precious wife and so kind of heard of his little story about him moving here so praise the Lord so we're going to take a journey this weekend we got uh three services uh tonight Sunday morning Sunday morning Sunday night and of course we have the youth tomorrow night so certainly are expecting from the Lord amen May Lord richly bless you I want to thank the musicians tonight may the Lord bless you you're doing an amazing job I'm quite impressed amen praise the Lord we'll turn in our Bible tonight and the Book of St John as I said time fly so fast and uh I was told that last time I was here there was like a 2-year-old boy and now he's like 10 and uh some got married and even on my end last time I was here I showed a picture of my family maybe we can uh bring up the PowerPoint I don't know if it's this is available um and so last time I spoke about my son he had a business and uh now he's married uh so we can bring it up if it's uh ready before we turn into the Bible just wanted to update you because you saw little kids but it's changed quite a bit so I think they are trying to have it set up on the main screen here so since then my son sold his business lawn Mo business for those who heard the story just want to update you so he sold his business covid was quite difficult uh back home I don't know how it was in New Zealand but during Co the government was paying people to stay home so it was hard to find people that wanted to work because they'd get more money staying home so it was really really difficult so he ended up selling selling his business and then he he got married and uh so we have now four girls left at home and I have to buy a shotgun cuz uh they like to travel and yeah you go read only I don't know if it's that yeah so they like to travel and uh so last time they went to a camp in Ohio I said I asked a girl I said should should I expect some phone calls so yeah so much uh big uh big girls and so William ended up married uh the neighbor down the street Lily she it's a family we brought to the Lord and Lily was the first one to come to the Lord uh out of the family and she said I want the Jesus of the Bron Bryson Bron's a family name so she gave her life to the Lord and Williamson since he was 13 um this going to be my wife he never told her obviously but it was kind of a family secret really like he had a his heart his eyes upon her she's a precious daughter of God and so they got married last May and because he worked so hard all his Youth and he sold his business you know so he had he had money so they took a trip in Europe and two months and a half honeymoon trip so it was it was the reward after so much work and so now he bought a house and so they got established so this is the update not to bring the attention on our family it's just for those who were there at Family Camp we shared a bit of a testimony and so now we've updated you refresh you with the a new picture but we're here for the word amen we're here for the word and so I've asked you to turn in um St John St John chapter 6 verse 37 up to verse 40 so I heard maybe some are tired tonight so we all together fighting against our body so we came in Wednesday just we kind of learned through traveling we got to be get early a little bit ahead of time get Force our body into a new schedule and so but we certainly count on the grace of God all right St John's 6:37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no I will in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which ha sent me that all of it all of which he had given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one of which see the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day amen let's bow our head Lord Jesus we want to thank you we are gathering your presence tonight we want to take every Spirit under your control Lord so your Holy Spirit have the freedom to move to move Lord from Hearts to Heart from Pew to Pew Lord to meet the need of the hour I pray want to surrender myself my thought my body Lord my mind everything under your control so you may use me for the benefit of your children Lord we pray in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated in coming here I kind of thought about the precious meetings we had the The First Family Camp I still remember and then the camp at the Family Camp we came after or youth service with brother cadri digs it was such a such a blessing me and me and still talk about that the camp me in the morning and him at night the tag team it's so so much Precious Precious Memories amen this weekend we're going to take a journey together and I'm going to want to give you maybe a heads up to uh where we're going with this and our title tonight is um they will come to me Lord willing our title tomorrow night will be are you perfect and um the the greater theme because these are all subtitles but the main theme will be spiritual growth during the weekend and of course maybe tomorrow night for the young people we'll have something might be just a side side thought that I have a burden to share with especially with the having just a young people there but we want to talk about spiritual growth this weekend but before we move into the topic of the spiritual growth I want to maybe lay a foundation and so the thought this weekend is going to be about the importance of spiritual growth and maturity now already told me that you've listened to the gender confusion series the message I preached at the Youth Camp last year I think it was at the Youth Camp there in Edmonton and in in that topic we talk about the maturity of the son you know that it comes from hearing the voice of the father there's a natural line natural thought to this topic that's really important but there's a also there's a spiritual element that is even more important we got to hear from our father and it's the only one who's going to bring us to maturity but before we move in uh uh that topic before we even talk about maturity tonight we want to lay a found Foundation of what in my experience and what I'm when I've seen you I grew up in the message we see many message people I've seen one thing that Enders Christian a lot and and we're talking about message people that Enders them is that they're spent most of the time worrying about their status and their status is someday they feel like a Christian and they feel like they're Sons and Daughters of God but other days we don't and we struggle with this am I worthy to be a Son of God uh H uh uh did the Lord choose me or did I choose him uh uh am am I good enough for him and it's really hard to mature and to grow if we keep un rooting the plant if you plant a garden and every time you have to unroot it and say what did I planted here what what kind of see was oh okay this okay okay that was it and then the next day you're like I'm wondering what I put in the ground and then you unroot you remove the dirt take the seat what it was again what and you're always worrying about the status and and in doing that we're not growing because we are blocking the Fest stage and so for that we have to be sure and to understand what makes us Sons and Daughters of God to begin with and if we don't answer that question we'll always fall back to am I a Son of God am I a daughter of God or not we don't know we're not sure because we have to determine that by the revelation of the word of the hour what makes us Sons and Daughters of God now before we move into that topic there's something really important we need to understand I've asked brother Ari if you were uh uh um because as the song leader said I don't know you much and so it it has an advantage in the sense that we uh we come here we don't know you know really where the people is what's the Thought where where you're in your journey so we really come here beyond the pulpit by faith and so I've asked him if the church was uh acquainted with the progressive revelation he says yeah we talk about that many time and all that so I just want to touch on that because it's really really important and and people who doesn't understand the the prog progressive revelation as as brother Brandon moved in his ministry the Lord kept to opening the word to him and and in that in that Journey there is some teaching that has changed but I've I come from I was raised in a church where for from 47 to 65 everything is the same there's a continuity in a sense that there's no progression everything and it it you know what the result of that it makes people confused and so progressive revelation first of all is in the Bible you got it here in John St John chap 16:12 when Jesus says I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now so that's the basis Jesus is saying I got many to reveal to you but I will not reveal reveal them to you at once but I will progressively give you those things this is how Jesus work this is how God gave Israel the promised land I'll give you little by little from City I will not give it you at once why cuz you can't handle it it was the same thing with Jesus he could not give them all at once cuz they would not be able to Bear it it was too much just Eat My Flesh drink my blood more than half the church left he couldn't and and it was the same thing with the prophet Church caught in Tradition he has to it's a progressive revelation because he has to open the word as people are able and a able to receive it because every time God reveals himself it challenged the tradition John the Baptist has a progressive revelation and he's saying that here when he talks about so John the Baptist and William Braham had the same similar job they had to introduce the coming of the Lord and so when John the Baptist started his ministry his greatest mission was to introduce the coming of the Lord but when he started his ministry he didn't know what was the coming of the Lord God revealed him to him later that's why he says here in the scripture I knew him not about Jesus but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore I am come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw a spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abought upon him and I knew him not so basically John the Baptist is saying I had to introduce the Messiah but I don't I didn't know who he was now people could have start a website just there saying he contradicts himself because Jesus was his cousins I knew him not he knew him it's family members but he didn't know him in that manner when people want to trap a man of God and try to make him look bad God will allow stuff to be hanging so they can take it to go wrong with it amen and so when we talk about the prophet's Ministry there is small things you know just you know about you know when he's talking about the soul the spirit and the body you know he places those differently as the you know these are like small thing but there is Major element that's been changed when the opening the seal came and so I want to read you and this is just um the introduction here but it's really important because what I'm I'm about to preach unless you understand and you are sure of that you cannot receive the rest of the meeting that we're going to preach tonight so the prophet explained a process of when the seals was revealed to him him and there's certain key things that he's mentioning here and he says now let is standing now tonight as we enter into this sixth chapter he's got the book in his hand and starting to reveal it and oh I would have abs AB absolutely today and I hope that people are spiritual I would have had a hor horrible mistake on that that if it hadn't been about 12:00 today when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down to say and I was taken from an old context it's really important I had nothing on it I don't know what he what's what the second seal is no more than nothing but I got some old context of something that I spoke on several years ago and I wrote it down and I gathered this context and Dr Smith and many great outstanding teachers and i' gather and all of them believe that so I wrote it down and I was fixing to say now well now I'll study it from that standpoint now a standpoint is a standpoint is where you're standing where when you're looking at this and so the prophet is saying is about to approach the seal from a standpoint but what the opening of the seal is is a changing of a standpoint cuz God wants to take his prophet and elevate it from a different View Point that he's able not to look at the book of redemption in a new way that no man ever touched that before because he would seal you're with me so the prophet is is is approaching a topic from an old context the way it was seen by you know major Dr Smith and other Scholars and all that and he's about to take their standpoint but God changed it so when God changes his standpoint the standpoint is about the the book of redemption so it's it's it's not little detail about the soul and the spirit and it's something greater than that it's the revelation of the book of redemption that was closed for so many years and if it was closed then we don't understand how Redemption is working amen nobody understood how Redemption is working until it was open amen so the prophet says immediately after that the angel of the Lord appeared and told about the seven trumpet or seven seal I was to return back to Jeffersonville and preach the seven seal and if I've ever said anything that was inspired it was in that there were the angel of the Lord met us and the Bible become a new Bible there it opened up so the the the shift when the the book got open is not just a detail or new information the bi the prophet says my Bible became a new Bible and reveal all the things that the reformers and things had left out which what the prophet was basing it on the reformers and Dr Smith and all those people but he's about to get a fresh update it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ allog together new new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture why am I reading that is for you to understand the major shift for the prophet himself that's right so if there's a major shift at that point and it's a new Bible and he says it's new to all of us it means that something has changed in the teaching after with the new standpoint that was the word which was always been I was so inspired and directed The Mysteries that wasn't the Seven Seals when these seven seal was open that opened up the entire Bible seven seal it was sealed with seven Mysteries and these seven sealed Eld held the entire mystery and it was the book of redemption so our topic tonight is they will come to me talking about Jesus and so they will come to me so our topic is tonight we want to talk about predestination and the question I want to ask you tonight is predestination your predestination is based on what and it's an important question because whatever answer you give to that question will determine the solidity of your walk what's this what it is based upon and and and so you got two choices the first one is your predestination is based on for knowledge that God saw your choice before the foundation of the world that you before foundation of the world you foreen so predestination would be based on God seeing you in this age making the right choice then saying okay since he's going to make the right choice I'm going to put his name in the book in the Redemption book that's one option that you have and the other that you have which are two lines in our own Circle I'm not talking about the Baptist the Pentecostal I'm talking within our ranks the other predestination would be based on origin origin means that Whatever Whenever where you come from that's where you return Hallelujah and it cannot be both it has to be one or the other and one then is based on your choice that God foreseen before the foundation of the world or the other one so God has foreseen that you would make the right choice but the other one is based on God choice and it might seem like well it's just a play on word it's just this this no no no there's a great impact on how you have your Christian walk today there's consequences if the whole thing is based on your choice or the whole thing is based on God's choice and so predestination based on origin it's linked to I come from God and I go back to [Applause] god so let's get to see and look and go back to the scripture Jesus says all all everyone that the father giveth to me shall come to me that's my title tonight they will come to me amen and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out here you have two groups of people the first group of people is those that the father giveth and the second group is those that choose chose him and they don't have the same inheritance and this is the father will which has sent me that all that of all which he ha given me I should lose nothing so basically that first category in no way they can be lost no way okay and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone of which seeth the son and Believe on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up in the last days now the prophet explained that that there is two groups in verse 37 we're going to read this other scripture before we read the quote my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give un them unto them the eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hands so this is the same group again those that the father gave me so those that the fathers choose they will come to me and I will lose nothing and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hands so not even you true not even you amen it doesn't make the same Christian if you believe you had you had something to do with it out of your own choosing or it's all on God it doesn't have the same walk so the prophet is saying here many of the question well will the bride will this the church you can't divide what they are and that was a problem before the opening of the word the church and the bride it was a mystery the revelation of the seal is also the revelation of the Bride it's not just the coming of the lord it's the coming of the Bride so when the bride is revealed now we understand that one group is based on choice but the other one is based on God's choice but before that it was a blurry thing but when the book of redemption opens suddenly the two groups gets clear yes sir amen and so this is why he's saying you can't divide what they are but now we can and we should be able to do it and it's important to be able to do it he says the bride is the elected of God but the church goes through can you finish the sentence tribulation all right we know we know it doesn't finish the sentence we understand so the church goes to the tribulation that's the one it says whosoever will let them come but the bride is the elected of God so you got your two groups here that's your two groups the first is the elected of God but the other who who whosoever will wants to come they can come they're going to come upon their choice of God God knew before the foundation of the world they would make that choice that's why he made room for them but they are not the elected because the elected it's not that they chose him it's that they come from him my children they didn't choose me they come from me like are not they are my children the prophet says you never chose God God chose you Jesus says no man can come to me except my father's draws in first so many people say oh I sought God I sought God that's a mistake you don't seek God God seeks you well you're going to say what's the difference the difference is Big because if your old Christianity is based on praise the Lord God's before the foundation saw of the world saw me making the right choice then praise the Lord I made the right choice and now I'm blessed and I got the Holy Ghost and you're all good but what if when you start struggling and you're in a valley and suddenly Satan comes to your mind he says well God for knowledge saw you making the right choice but what if you're are now making the wrong choice did God see you making the wrong choice and it Bas it it it it the problem with that concept is that it all based this on your choice everything is based on your choice and then you're always nervous Lord am I am am I doing the wrong thing am I doing the right thing Lord did you see me doing this this or this that and and it's and and everything it it brings all the focus on your behavior because you now realize that because you made the right choice you're elected but what if I make the wrong choice so by my choice I'm in but by my choice I can be out and it changed the way you raise your children too because now you put a lot of pressure on them for them to make the right choice hoping that God foreseen that they would make the right choice and you're always like no no don't make the wrong choice no no no no cuz you want them to be so Christian you want them to be so you want them to be elected so bad you put all that pressure on them because your Christianity is based on your choice and I'm not saying that Orchid should not make the the the good choice I'm talking about the pressure like we had something to do in that and I call this it's a back ground noise and it's something that's part of your spiritual fabric it's something and maybe in preaching it the reason why I'm preaching is to bring it to the surface right that's why so many people are are Christian but they are nervous Christians because they always afraid of doing the wrong thing because if making the right choice qualified you it means then the making the wrong choice disqualified you and in that Circle you can never become mature because one day you're sons of God but the next day you're doubting because you're saying what if I get discouraged you know at first when we become Christian we're full of zeal full of power we're all excited it's all good but then you know the test of time comes and trials and and fatigue and sometime we lose some lose the Zeal and that God renew it to us but when we're in a valley and we L the Zeal and we're like Lord I don't know if I can carry through this I don't know I don't have the strength to make the next step and if everything is based on me and my strength and my Zeal well it's good when you have strength and you have Zeal but if you've been around long enough you we had deep valleys when we we we we lost our strength and and our Zeal and we got discourage and and it's in these valleys that you have to know oh God you've chosen me and what you've started you will finish it and that's how you can find strength in the in the valley knowing it's not your choice it's God's choice and if God started something in my life he will finish because that's his plan not my plan if your predestination is based on your choice it means this was based on your works but that's not what the Bible says because the Bible says for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to the election might stand not of Works a choice is a deed not of works but of him that calleth so then it is not of him that willth so saying that we are predestinated by choice means that it was based on our will but the Bible says that it's not based on our will or the one who runneth but it's God that showeth mercy so it will bring us then to the question what makes us then how did how did we become a Christian then the answer is going to come later on in the service the prophet answers those things so there was a change in the teaching of the prophet and and sometime ministers are afraid to say that because there's going to be a backlash and then they're going to be told you know oh this Minister don't believe the message don't I've been excommunicated many time anyway so it doesn't change the truth is the truth and when when we shy away of exposing and telling the truth for what it is and trying to save a reputation of what people's going to say it means that I'm in bondage bondage to try to save my reputation if I stay in bondage you stay in bondage amen so this is how the prophet taught it before the seal he taught predestination on for knowledge he did it why because there was a blur because we could we were not able to divide the church and the bride but when the book of redemption opened it was the Revelation not only of Jesus Christ it was the revelation of misses Jesus Christ where we could say she is him God so that's how he taught it before in the message adoption the whole Ser adoption series is based on that premises so you got to read it with the eyes and some people go too far some people even go to say well everything before 63 is rubbish you got to try in the garbage no no no no no no there's a lot of good thing about the grace the Hebrew the sovereignty of the church many many good thing the grace of God Calvary there's a lot of good things you know you don't throw in the garbage but you got to read the book until the end with the revelation of the open book and then after that you can read with understanding yes and that is the problem we have in our ranks is that it's that it's sometime it's stop that all you have to do is believe the prophet now you got to understand you got to have the revelation of what he was saying cuz unless you have the Revelation you'll be like this uh Enuk that wanted to be baptized that was reading the book of Isaiah and Philip came he had the book of the prophet in his hand he's like who is he talking about having a book of the prophet in your hand is not enough you need the spirit of the Revelation was the prophet talking about himself or talking about another one and Philip jumps on board and and give him the revelation of the opening of the book no William Bram is not talking about himself he's talking about a bride Hallelujah brother fendler believe the message he was trying to convert his wife to the message his wife didn't believe the message so every time he come back from church his wife was little brother fendler took his wife and and hold her really tight and he said I cast The Devil out of her and I cast The Devil out of her because she didn't believe the message and when he told that to the prophet Prophet is like well okay I mean all right well he says brother Brenham I'm doing what I what you're doing so he was following a prophet believing every word the prophet was saying doing what the prophet was saying but I'm the question I'm asking you how long can a wife can endure a man that comes back from church and hold you real tight and cast a devil de demons out of you he would have run his marriage to the ground trying to do what the Propet did why because he didn't have the revelation of what he was doing Prophet says no God go buy her a box of chocolate or candy says winner by love and so he was trying to apply the message but he didn't know what the message was so the prophet is teaching here on forn knowledge he says when did God choose us that's before the seals when did God choose you that got the Holy Ghost when did he chose you before the foundation of the world by his fore knowledge he know that you and know that you would love him so that you would make the right choice father and mother all my whole family Sinners I was a cockle bird but all of a sudden I become a wheat grain now it's really important that you remember that because in the seven Church age book The Prophet says there is you always been a seed and there is no change of species that's really important the opening of the world re word revealed that but before the opening of the word the prophet was teaching that you would there was a change of species but the opening of the word changed that that's why the prophet says I have a new Bible I'm on a different standpoint now I'm not preaching it from an old context oh my and then and when when we we don't show these things the because because we'll be called uh well he says the prophet contradicts himself he doesn't believe everything the prophet says with thus said the Lord and all those things and and it it it becomes a scarecrow and we're not able to dive in the word and understand the process and the change in 63 and when we don't do that people read this and then they read the church age book and they're all they're confused to the point that some people don't believe the seven Church age was written by the prophet they say no that was brother lille's Doctrine when the prophet was preaching under the anointing this is what he said and it brings even greater confusion but stay with me don't quit we're going to run it through quotes and you're going to see most of the quote I'm going to read tonight is 65 because something happened even a greater understanding because even after the seal the prophets started to dive deeper and deeper deeper into the word uncovering amazing thing for our benefit for us not to be confused anymore so here he was teaching a change of species how did it happen that was election God before the foundation the world elected that cockle bird had to become a grain of wheat by Fall knowledge he see that I would love him so he made appropriation to his son got taught through him I might become from a Cocker bird to a grain of wheat now where I am at now etc etc now when you talk about it's based on Origin we are like Jesus because Jesus says I come from the father and I come into the world and again I leave the world and I go to the father so Jesus would return to his origin amen and even though we're not Jesus we come from the same place we were in him and we are returning in him and the only thing and I'm going to give you some of the answer in advance so you don't I don't lose some of you the only thing we can do on Earth is to accept when God revealed to you before the foundation of the world you were in me you bu by past your theophany so you didn't have you didn't have the knowledge of all that but now I'm revealing to you who you are it's like the prodigal son why did he go back there because he came from there amen that's the only way to return to redeem is to bring back so if you are brought back as you were there to start with and when we dive into this thing everything makes sense amen the prophet says at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world as we will point out shortly so you know the the traditional Baptist view maybe is is is is when you lay down at your alar and you gave your life to the Lord God is looking as Oh Brother Steve giving his life to the Lord praise the Lord I'm going to write his name in the books no it's actually a contrary because your name is in the book you came to the altar Hallelujah also it is not a question of assembling involving oursel with two group of people both of whom had the opportunity to receive eternal life wherein one group receive it and had their names placed on record while the other who refused it did not have their name so placed we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who were not even born again will go into eternal life they don't have eternal life but they enter into there's a Nuance there as strange as it may sound it is certainly true we will also show that there's a group of people who name having been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed under no circumstances depression a fall a mistake several mistake you went through a divorce your life was erect talk about Saul I believe and and when the pro Propet you know it's only because we receive a prophet that we believe Saul what was what was Samuel at the end because we all send Saul into hell did we but but sometime people are afraid to teach that because they say if we teach that then people were going to go on rampage they're going to lose up and say well it doesn't matter if I was there I was there and if I not I not no no no that's not it one thing is really important Saul made so many bad choices based on his complex or rejection that he ruined his ministry his family his reput he ruined everything and he died in shame but he was on the other side because Samuel told him tomorrow you will be with me amen yes but second is that God has placed something inside of us before the foundation of the world and we're going to dive into this shortly that creates something inside of our heart that people out there doesn't have and one of the theme quote and we're going to read it tomorrow or or Sunday morning but it's really important he says I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to strengthen out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are remember our theme is spiritual growth but to be able to grow we have to stop questioning our status we got to settle the question once and for all I am a Son of God and then you're going to say but what if I am not am that's not a problem do I have a proof brother Steve BR does I me personally have a proof that my name is in the book no no not at all I cannot prove that to myself or to you but there can testify there's something in my heart which I believe that God has chosen me and once that is revealed to me it settled the question when I'm in a valley or I do a mistake or I make bad choice I don't go back and rip off my Christian experience because it's not based on my choice it's based on God's choice and I cannot be lost under any any circumstances so the prophet says the scare and the fear is you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God you always were the sons of God 65 for when God had you and his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there and well when he before even become material here on here on Earth before there was anything but God you were one with his hat with his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of your hair you would have you know all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner so the big difference between us and Jesus is that we bypass our theophany Jesus went straight the Bible prophets teaches that Jesus became the word and then he became flesh us we became flesh that's right and then after that we became word but during that time that we were only flesh we were like what's life supposed to be we were behaving like the rest of the world we were behaving like our parents if they were not Christian we were just having no clue but what's supposed to happen is when we become word it's supposed to settle the question we're not in our flesh anymore we are becoming the word and now we started to know who we are like Jesus knew who he was amen amen and now the next thing that's really important that happened in 65 is the word c you don't find that before that why because it's something that God gave his prophet and that c Gene teaching changes everything whatever you read after that you have to remember that let's read it so we're laying a foundation to go it's tonight is just a foundation we want to have a solid ground because we want to move forward we want to be able to understand the importance of maturity that's right but when we feel like we have to be born again every service we stay a baby if I don't know who I am I I had a bad week and I come back I don't even know like should I go to church or not like I had such a bad week I don't even know if I'm a Christian I don't even know my sons of God maybe I'm talking for one person here tonight that keeps ripping his his Christian Life week after week because you are all based on your behavior right there is days I feel like a Christian there is days man I get up I feel like reading my Bible and I pray and then I I have a smile and it's like praise the Lord I feel it in my body but there are days sorry to disappoint you I don't know like there's days I feel like reading my my Bible there's other days I'm I'm stressed I got so much to do and I'm like I got to do it and I'm supposed to feel like it but I don't feel like it and maybe I what if I don't do it and you're half gone today your day doesn't go well and then you're like well I didn't put the Lord in the first place and and and but but when you go through that and that your whole experience is based on your behavior then you don't feel like a Christian so maybe I'm not and then with that thought the ne the next day is worse and the third day is worse and then church time comes it's like I'm not even going it's not worth me going there like like I didn't even read my Bible this week I'm going to go to church and pretend I'm a Christian forget it you got people who go on a roller coaster like that and you know why they bring they go on a roller coaster because when they go to church what they present to God is their behavior but you know when you approach God the only thing you're allowed to bring is the is the Lamb is the lamb and when the the even the the high priest when he received the worshipper he was inspecting the lamb not the worshipper do you know that that's in the Bible the lamb would get inspected he didn't look at the sinner he's no good anyway forget it I'm not looking at the sinner if he's here with a lamb he's not good for anything so show me your lamb all right not crooked eyes all right he's good right four legs all right your lamb is perfect you can come in the house of the Lord and you can worship and the proof that a lot of us and you know what when the lamb was presented you something and sometime we put a lot of focus on the lamb and the blood it's really important but we forget the other step and the other step is the fire was coming down the fire was coming down when Abel offered sacrifice the Bible says God was pleased and accepted his sacrifice how did Cain see that is was refused and and Abel was accepted it's because fire came down on his Elijah when when he brought that Big Challenge fire came down on is all this when God answered to your worship if you worship the right way he will answer by fire even in the Bible you have David David offer sacrifice Bible says God honored David's sacrifice or offering by fire but if we present something else there's no fire and the proof that a lot of us when we go to church and we worship we are excited to go to church when our behavior is good because actually subconsciously this is what we present to God oh praise the Lord I read my Bible and I listened to a message and I prayed so much and I feel good and now I can worship because this is what I present to God I presented my good choice my good choices and my good behavior and I and I did the right choice and I did the right thing thing and and then we go back to this quote that we misunderstand when God told William brandham because had thou has made the right choice and then we think that choice gave him eternal life that's not it that choices gave him a greater reward a reward and eternal life is two separate things by your choices and your behavior there's a greater reward but eternal life is not based on Behavior it's based on elect predestination Saul probably lost all his rewards because he ruined his family he ruined his ministry he brought Israel to shame he persecuted and elected of God anointed by God he done so many things probably he went on the other side he had eternal life but his reward he lost because rewards is based on Behavior but not eternal life are you with me Hallelujah so next time you don't feel like coming to church it's a day to remind you all right God praise the Lord I'm going to bring my lamb who's your lamb Jesus Christ is your lamb he's perfect he didn't fail the inspection Glory if you present him he is worthy I am not worthy I'm not even worthy to stand in front of you and preach tonight if it was based on my behavior I would not be standing here neither you but me and you are standing on the same ground we are standing on Grace only Grace Hallelujah Glory hallelujah amen I'm just preparing the sermon a Sunday morning are you perfect ouch are you perfect we're going to study that we're going to have good times together amen what time is it probably 3:00 in the morning in Quebec 4:00 I don't know I'm already past bedtime anyway there's two points I want to talk and then I'm I'm going to close C genene and what is eternal life and the purpose the purpose behind this teaching tonight is to establish every one of you on a more solid ground if you're grounded in your behavior your Christian life will be like this up and down Prophet says many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you a little boy little girl you walk around here there would be certain things that would just it would bother it wouldn't bother the other kids it seems like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner remember that certainly now what was that there was a little form of life in you then and after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination and then one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word but when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth like Jesus he knew who he was because he he was word and then flesh but we were flesh ignorant and when we heard the word we know where you come from if God reveal you tonight where you come from from it settles the question forever yes sir am life's going to be life there going to be trials but you won't be unrooted from your origin cuz nothing can separate you from the love of God nothing amen you were always the seed was in you always amen the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word that you come to it and I want you to notice this is 65 you're going to heard about hear about s Cene 65 and then the church age book is is wrote with that Revelation that's why there there's people around our ranks that refuse the seven Church age book and it's it's it's um it's sad when I hear that there's a minister who doesn't accept the seven Church age book he believes William Brenham but he refused Church age book for me it kind of revealed that he recognized a prophet it's okay recognize a prophet but he didn't recognize the opening of the word the coming down of Christ R re revealing himself it changed everything amen and so we found out that God does that in every age God does his own choosing by his own predestinated choose choosing chooses prophets and things for the ages fixes nature to men's nature the men's style of preaching the honor his gift and all that he does is to meet the challenge of that day God creates that man and sent him and in his own mind as I preached on last night we are a germ of the gene of God he know that men would be there at that age before there was even ever a molecule or a light or anything else in the Earth for you're a gene of your father and you were in your father yet your father had no fellowship with you because you was in there you but you knew it not and who is this me mesc the prophet explained about the theophany and you knew it not but you was manifested that you might have fellowship with you but you being born again you're born of eternal life but you knew it not and I pray that somebody tonight can stand up at the end of the service and say finally I know because sometime we are stuck with the old context and the new one and we go we read the seven CH book we're all blessed praise the Lord how was God has chosen me before the I come to God and I come from God I go back to God and then we go back to before and we realize that and and it brings confusion cuz once it's it's based on our Behavior and the other one is based on God's choice but God doesn't want us to be confused then if you are Son of God or daughter of God you were in God all the time but in knew what bed in time that you'd be planted so now you're made a creature and a son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God for this hour if you wasn't chose that way chose what with the c genene if you wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it I got to skip some to save time we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in none seed there is nothing to Quicken that's true so when you're tall if you do this you're going to miss the Rapture really how many time we've heard threaten God's people that based on the be their behavior they're going to miss the Rapture don't never let a minister threaten you that you going to miss the Rapture based on your behavior because if you're a seed that seed will be quickened well what if what if a Son of God is making bad choices well if he's a Son of God he'll get he'll get his fanking maybe Bible says God rebukes his own children but he will not remove you kick you away thank you Lord amen and it's the difference between a church that's Grace based or performance base and it's really easy you don't have to listen for a long time to see if you're sitting under a ministry that's Performance Based because you feel the pressure that's on the people to straight up to line up to be better because this is the end of time it's not time to play game anymore and and and understand that it's serious we better line up understand all this but if at the end I'm threatening you that you will miss the rapture as we now read since the opening of the word the prophet says under any no circumstances you can miss it brother you're making way too safe you're making it way too secure people are going to loose up and they're going to become worldly well if they become worldly and they go back in the world because of that it means that there's nothing inside it's not me that keeps the people in line it's the life that's in you we're going to see tomorrow that the law has never brought no one to maturity and rules and the church doesn't bring people to maturity I understand it should be order and not chaos but I'm talking about when we try to make people Rapture Ready by adding up so many rules we're missing the point and it's a proof that we don't have faith in the seed of God we don't have faith that God has called you it's not the church who call you like in the serious gender confusion it's not the woman who's called you it's the father who called you and whatever he started he will finish it thank you Lord thank youus the B baptism of the Holy Ghost is nothing else than that seed that's Quicken that seed who is Quicken is that experience that brings you from Darkness to light amen let's move on I got to finish we got many more services ahead of us all this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back back it restores through the original own God by his death shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species but why now he's preaching that because God Seven Angel Revelation took him from the standpoint of the old context and brought bring him onto the new cont new standpoint of the open book why because now the the the the book of redemption is open and when it's open you hear your name I hear my name when you're sitting under a Ministry who preaching the open book you hear your name and it's not now I'm in because I follow the rules or I'm in because I'm so good I'm in because I heard my name and to hear your name the book needed to be open Hallelujah there is no change of species you didn't you were not a cuckle bird to turn into wheat not a pig turn into sheep not a dog turn into sheep cuz it's impossible there is no changeing species as we were in the thoughts of God and the Express in the flesh they had to come a day where we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of a father's calling and recognize that we are the sons of God recognize Hallelujah we hear his voice and we cry out as did The Prodigal Son save me oh my father I'm returning to thee as I said The Prodigal Son could return only because that's where he came from but a Son of God can take a long time before he recognizes that he is a son he can take a while I invited him to church he didn't want to come I gave him the test of the word he refused it he's serpent seed oh time out oh we got sons of God that's stubborn oh hardheaded they hear the word but it's not because they do the that something is not going on inside that's he just done a a 360 Flip it's like ah I don't want to hear that and and inside like he's like what was that well you don't say to no one cuz you're full of yourself pride and hardheaded but something flipped inside that sound was different yes sir right it takes some time for a Son of God take a long time in fact a lot of true Christian are like the story of the baby eagle that was atch under a hen he know that's the eagle is a type of the True Believer so you know that story about the eagle it's the only way to see predestination you were born an eagle you ended up with other people yeah you didn't know who you were but you felt different and then when you heard that voice you didn't turn from a chicken to an eagle because you heard the voice the voice doesn't change who you are the The Voice reveal who you are but Brothers brother Steve we were I was living like a pig yeah the flesh yeah the flesh absolutely but I'm talking about the seed and our flesh is going to be changed our body is going to be changed oh we waiting for that amen so I won't read the story about the eagle you you know the story so once he called screaming he try you know he's trying to beat his wing cuz the mother's called he says you see he always he always was an eagle so you have to realize who you are and it's exactly scriptural because the Bible says Galatians 4 because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his sons into your hearts crying AB father we don't receive the Holy Ghost because a preacher put pressure on you you should receive it you should receive it if you don't receive you're going to miss the Rapture you're you don't receive the Holy Ghost Under Pressure you receive the Holy Ghost when the word strikes the seed and even sometime when we talk about receiving the Holy Ghost there's a misunderstand misunderstanding of what what it is let me finish this and then we're going to finish with what is eternal life so the prophet is referring to the scripture we just read it's really important this explains us how it works you are first to son and then you receive the spirit of his son it's only if you're a son or daughter of God that you can receive it and unless we ground our ministry the way we preach the way we live unless we ground it solidly on that we are misleading people Prophet says because ye are sons of God sent forth a spirit of his son unto your hearts whereby you cry AB father upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons at corent upon sons while they heard the word you put too much pressure on people you lock them cuz now they become afraid what if nothing happens to me on Saturday night what if nothing happens to me I'm going to special meetings and everybody's crying and I didn't feel anything and what if I'm missing and and sometime we put so much faith on the atmosphere which atmosphere extremely important we need the atmosphere but our Focus has to be on receiving the word I'm closing with this what is eternal life we understand eternal life is Zoe the life of God himself we understand that but when did eternal life enter your life that's another thing we have to understand and keep it clear I don't know if you realize but everything I'm reading to you is 65 and the church age book because that's all when it became clear and we have to keep that in our mind so so we so were you Sons and Daughters of God before there even was a Moon Star in a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in God at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was Hallelujah you before you don't know nothing about it did neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested too In His Image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and fellowship of God and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thought before the foundation of world right no way around it that's right now we notice that life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world so I'm asking you did you receive eternal life at the altar or eternal life was in you since the beginning the foundation of the world Amen so that's another thing before the seal you receive eternal life when you receive the Holy Ghost after the seal Prophet says life eternal life was always in you but the difference now the experience of the Holy Ghost is the same is that that Holy Ghost come and Quicken the seed but life was already in it but not express so we can say well these are just you know play on words it's not just play on word it's the revelation of a true process how God works in our life now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God because you have to be you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attribute you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation World knew that you would be here amen prise now you have fellowship with your father and God just as you have with your Earthly father you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children and sons and daughter of the Living God if it to be that the eternal life dwells in you praise the Lord so what makes us what made us give our life to the Lord what did I what what what what was my choice Prophet explained how it works he says the word cannot deny itself then it is satisf fire it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying there always wasn't there all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost so the prophet is saying that you you chose to give your life to God based out a desire of that seed it's the seed that make you give your life to God Amen so it's all the way around because if it was if it was based on for knowledge then it says the belief is I made the right choice so God wrote my name in the book but after the seals it's the contrary I made the choice because my name was in the book that's the revelation of the open book the book what's the book The Book of Redemption where everything gets clear it's not that I made the right choice then then why God put my name in the book no my God put my name in the book and that seed in me made me desire we're always in 65 it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal life it's always was eternal life it come from God it's God it's it goes to God it's the soul Sons and Daughters of God was in God God in the beginning now look you've got eternal life you say we believe it that we got eternal life well there's only one form of eternal life and that's God that's the only thing that is eternal is God then if you've got eternal life that life that's in you always was so propheus says your soul is eternal and that seed in the soul that's what brought you to God Amen closing with this scripture who shall separate us from the love of Christ and then he goes on with a big list tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness peral sword let me add you for I'm pers created verse 38 that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor power nor things nor things presence present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah musicians can come let's barhead head Lord Jesus we want to thank you tonight what a blessing before we move forward in the word Lord it was important to establish your people them not to be established on their behavior but to be established on your choice we've heard your word we've recognized we've been quick and I pray Lord that you anchor your people in the revelation of your word so they not cast on one side and the other and ups and down and a roller coaster Lord we want to be anchor solid so from that standpoint we can grow and mature that you may be able to build something in our spiritual life instead of us ripping it apart every week after every fall after a mistake after did I made the right choice did that choice separated me from God did his presence left me did I did I made a mistake Lord did you flee did you left did you leave me Lord can I come to your church am I welcome can I worship you all those questions that question or status in your presence I pray Lord that you remove all scare and all doubts establish your children solidly Lord Lord I appreciate your presence I appreciate the atmosphere I appreciate the emotion I feel when I feel your presence these is all good things but Lord I want to be able to have something in my heart so solid that when it's the desert when it's dry when it's Temptation when it's rough time I still know cuz I'm not based on emotion where even though I enjoy emotion but I'm based on your [Music] promise we want to cast Lord every spirit of fear and scare L we want Lord your Holy Spirit to come in this place and reveal Lord that we've preached from an open book tonight Lord that your people may hear their name and something secure and solid and anchor their soul can be established so
