[35:26] you bless them your People Israel
[35:27] because those who bless Israel they are
[35:30] blessed father and father for you

[35:34] may you with comfort and bless the
[35:36] families that are there father our heart
[35:39] goes with them Father we understand you
[35:41] have a plan for each and everybody's
[35:43] life father so we lay everything into
[35:46] your hands father may you anoint the
[35:48] speaker this morning and may your anoint
[35:50] the ears of the hero and we lay
[35:53] everything into your hands and ask it in
[35:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[36:00] hallelujah God bless you richly
[36:03] Hallelujah and I think very much the
[36:05] musicians I'm a may the Lord richly
[36:08] bless you for using your gifts for the
[36:10] glory of God and Hallelujah while we're
[36:13] standing let's open the word of the Lord
[36:16] amen
[36:17] I didn't continue to sing with this song
[36:20] because I didn't know it just therefore
[36:21] I I didn't dare to
[36:24] to Adventure without Authority
[36:28] because later you say this man comes
[36:30] from Germany he cannot preach he cannot
[36:31] sing what does he what candy does he
[36:34] what is he able to do so let us read The
[36:37] Familiar scripture in the Book of Joshua
[36:40] chapter 24 and I really if I'm really
[36:44] not mistake this is the last day of the
[36:45] year this is New Year's Eve is that
[36:47] correct so yeah so I trust that you
[36:51] make up your mind about about your
[36:53] Doctrine about your about your intention
[36:56] about the vision that you want to have
[36:57] and here we have Joshua he said this and
[37:00] if it seems verse 15
[37:03] Joshua 24 15 most of you you know Baha
[37:08] because you have it hanging over your
[37:10] door as a little slogan
[37:13] and if it seem evil unto you to serve
[37:15] the Lord choose you this day whom you
[37:18] will serve
[37:20] whether the gods which your father
[37:22] served that were on the other side of
[37:24] the flood are the gods of the amorites
[37:27] in whose land you dwell but as from me
[37:30] and my house we will serve the Lord
[37:34] Hallelujah that was a true amen may the
[37:37] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[37:38] his word amen
[37:41] you may be seated
[37:43] so I I really greet you in the name of
[37:46] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's a it's a
[37:49] great honor for me to be among you and I
[37:52] couldn't say that it's this this is the
[37:54] best place for me to be because because
[37:57] somebody might stream from home and then
[37:59] I I I I I owe them an understanding but
[38:03] we have a wonderful wonderful atmosphere
[38:05] and if I'm not mistaken this is Brother
[38:07] Dean which is with us is that correct
[38:09] Brother Dean yes sir I remember really
[38:11] the the inspiration Division and I
[38:13] really want to greet all of you I want
[38:15] to greet the ministers I know that
[38:18] um you don't know me you don't need meat
[38:21] to come from Germany to bring you a
[38:23] message I know that New Zealand has very
[38:25] powerful very good Ministries and uh but
[38:28] somehow but the area had on it's hard
[38:29] for me to come and everybody has his
[38:32] specialty everybody has his uh
[38:34] uniqueness and and I'm happy that I
[38:38] shouldn't cope anyone or to be a copy of
[38:40] someone let me view my just myself huh
[38:43] but from my heart I want to give all my
[38:45] honor my respect to the ministry here to
[38:47] the family of God which is here in New
[38:49] Zealand it has a tremendous uh
[38:51] reputation starting already with our
[38:53] most number brother Sarah many many
[38:55] years ago and then different names what
[38:57] was about brother Paul brother Malcolm
[38:59] and many many names that have uh really
[39:02] uh left a wonderful impression when they
[39:04] came over to our place
[39:06] um so may the Lord richly bless you and
[39:09] um
[39:11] our heart goes on to you for the family
[39:13] who are mourning uh this morning we have
[39:16] the funeral May the Lord richly come for
[39:18] them will you bless them and uh blessed
[39:21] be the name of the Lord I want you like
[39:23] yesterday even just to relax uh I'm I'm
[39:26] sometimes a little bit of a starchy
[39:28] German sometimes a little bit humoristic
[39:30] that's just but again this morning I
[39:32] will not use any notes let me speak from
[39:34] my heart but I have some pictures that
[39:37] give me always a certain guideline okay
[39:39] always I know where I'm ending I know
[39:41] what's in between uh I'm like I'm like
[39:44] God you know he's Alpha and Omega we
[39:45] don't know what is in the in the middle
[39:47] of it but he's the beginning and the end
[39:49] there's some surprises in the middle of
[39:52] it okay so so God bless you richly and
[39:56] um I would like to to really deep speak
[40:00] in in these Services brother brother I
[40:02] already had on his heart that I take all
[40:04] the services it doesn't make me a
[40:06] special Minister but he was aware that
[40:08] I'm coming from far you know you're
[40:09] sitting two days in the in the plane for
[40:11] coming two it takes four days just to
[40:13] come back and go so he said man if he's
[40:15] here let him let him talk let him open
[40:17] his heart I appreciate this surely and
[40:20] and though I love to sit on the
[40:22] Ministries the same way especially if it
[40:24] has that kind of a quality that you have
[40:26] here when I was preaching yesterday
[40:28] after some year I felt on my heart that
[40:30] I'm talking to people who who know the
[40:33] message
[40:34] who not only know that God sent a
[40:36] prophet but but you know the message you
[40:38] see and that is a great uh a great
[40:41] contribution that the ministry here does
[40:43] so for today I want I want to ask to
[40:46] lean you back and if you wouldn't mind I
[40:49] will come down with because we make a
[40:50] little coaching this morning okay so
[40:52] I'll leave that place here it gives me a
[40:54] little bit of a nearness to you I would
[40:57] like to entitle the subject that we have
[41:00] it's a vision for the Next Generation
[41:04] a vision for the Next Generation okay
[41:07] and uh so so the familiar scripture that
[41:12] we have here is the Book of Joshua
[41:16] and Joshua takes uh the platoon over
[41:20] from Moses
[41:21] we realize that the ministry of brother
[41:24] Branham was the ministry of Moses
[41:27] that's how the angel uh presented
[41:30] himself and as Moses were given two
[41:32] signs uh you're giving two signs but it
[41:36] did not end with Moses brother Abraham
[41:38] had the ministry of Joshua exactly the
[41:40] same thing
[41:41] now I know there's no new people here
[41:43] and just to explain myself of of my
[41:46] background
[41:48] um this message is not a cult
[41:51] why should I become cultish what's the
[41:54] reason for it this message is not a
[41:55] denomination why should I become
[41:57] denominational
[41:58] this message is not a sect why should it
[42:01] become securian so this message is our
[42:04] father talking to us
[42:06] it was brother Brandon was just a voice
[42:09] the message that we believe does not
[42:11] from come from America it comes from the
[42:13] presence of Almighty is not an American
[42:16] message is an eternal message coming
[42:18] from God and and and and we're so
[42:21] thankful we are the only people on the
[42:25] Earth who doesn't have a religion we
[42:28] have a father
[42:29] that's different I mean we are the only
[42:32] one who doesn't have just a quote book
[42:34] and a notebook and and and and a
[42:36] Facebook or whatever we have we have a
[42:38] person that's our father
[42:40] I mean he takes care of us he's part of
[42:43] us and yesterday we have seen uh how how
[42:46] in somehow and I will not repeat all the
[42:49] thoughts but if if the coming of the
[42:53] Lord is the light for the Earth as
[42:55] Isaiah said and brother Abraham said you
[42:57] are the lights
[42:59] that means the bride is the coming of
[43:01] the Lord
[43:03] and still we are waiting to meet him in
[43:05] the air no contradiction at all but
[43:06] there is a coming of Christ referring to
[43:09] Revelation chapter 10. so we see and if
[43:13] we just show the first picture uh that I
[43:16] would like to just talk to you it's a
[43:18] teaching but I would want to show it a
[43:21] little bit in the coaching way
[43:23] so the time came that uh Joshua
[43:28] just a question brother can you close
[43:30] the door please because it just draft
[43:32] and if I'm sweating then everything will
[43:34] become uh I I want to be sick I will be
[43:37] sick thank you sir amen
[43:40] um so we see that Joshua
[43:45] how can I say he became an old man
[43:48] is nothing wrong to become old
[43:52] I remember many many years ago there was
[43:55] a time of brother in Jenkins as per
[43:57] theology brother learning how old are
[43:58] you he said look I became too oh I see
[44:01] brother Tony the same way Shalom are my
[44:03] brothers hey amen my brother Lonnie said
[44:06] brother America's I became too fast old
[44:08] and too slow wise
[44:11] no at that time I was laughing like you
[44:14] but today I feel like a little bit the
[44:15] same
[44:17] so God help us
[44:19] in this message not to become just old
[44:22] but wise
[44:25] we want to be I hope we can see it in
[44:28] the next service is this message has
[44:31] transforming power
[44:33] don't be the same old characterly
[44:37] ugly person that we were when we came
[44:39] into this message let us be transformed
[44:43] to become a light for Dying World
[44:46] we are this message
[44:48] Jesus there is the bride or brother
[44:50] Brahm said there is a people who will be
[44:52] the final voice of the final age and
[44:55] brother Brahm said under their messenger
[44:59] amen the message is not in books today
[45:01] you are that message today
[45:03] amen so as I said if as every father is
[45:07] the head of his home every Pastor is the
[45:10] head of a local church
[45:12] I'm a minister but I have to understand
[45:14] that my role is to be under a pastor
[45:17] there is not always a constant friction
[45:21] cannot be
[45:22] now as I said yesterday we are not in a
[45:25] sect
[45:26] so we have a liberty to have our own
[45:28] opinion
[45:29] we're not brainwashed we're not a sick I
[45:32] can say openly I see a difference even
[45:34] to my own Pastor I said even sometimes I
[45:37] say brother honestly I see a difference
[45:40] but brother Brahman said everything that
[45:42] has one more than one heads is a is a
[45:45] monster
[45:46] so I don't want to be part of a monster
[45:48] I said I have my opinion but you are the
[45:50] head so I will as long as in the word I
[45:53] keep you I will not I will not interfere
[45:56] okay that's so important because one day
[45:59] the pastors stand before God
[46:01] so the pastor is the head of our local
[46:04] church
[46:05] if I if I if I if I if I do not expect
[46:10] his authority sometimes you have to
[46:14] understand one thing and young people we
[46:16] needed some years to understand those
[46:18] things
[46:19] and because we saw the man
[46:22] and his failures
[46:24] and there were even some time where
[46:26] we're making a little bit fun about
[46:27] certain things but today we regret it
[46:30] because you have to understand the
[46:32] anointing is not only upon the man but
[46:34] upon the office of that man
[46:37] and God is blessing the office
[46:40] and you say but this man he makes these
[46:42] kind of mistakes God will bring this man
[46:44] to its few maturity
[46:46] can you say Amen
[46:48] I doubt if somebody cannot respect God's
[46:52] authorities on this Earth if we can
[46:54] really respect word authority
[46:58] I doubt if somebody cannot accept or
[47:01] respect worldly let me say laws
[47:06] a brother wanted to explain me that he
[47:08] doesn't pay uh taxes
[47:11] uh I don't know if it's the same
[47:13] expression here you you work black is
[47:15] that correct marking black that means
[47:18] you you you're a businessman and you're
[47:20] working and you get money and you don't
[47:22] pay taxes and he tried to explain to me
[47:25] he said brother Marcus from all these
[47:26] Texas Texas is it right taxation taxes
[47:29] okay uh uh the government just pays uh
[47:34] uh uh weapons and uh I will not pay Mrs
[47:38] Arden or sister Arden or whatever
[47:41] but I said brother Paul says if we
[47:44] cannot really be subject on the worldly
[47:48] Authority how can we be subject under
[47:51] God's Authority the natural types the
[47:54] spiritual so what happens is that the
[47:58] pastor is a local Authority but but but
[48:00] the messenger is the Authority for the
[48:03] age
[48:05] and Christ is the authority he's the
[48:08] head of all seven Messengers
[48:10] I'm sometimes asked the question brother
[48:12] Mark is is it can somebody correct the
[48:14] prophet I said sure God can
[48:18] amen God can correct the prophet because
[48:20] he did it all through the Bible okay but
[48:23] if for us to correct the prophet is very
[48:25] very difficult okay
[48:27] can you say Amen
[48:29] so what happened is this that that
[48:32] Joshua became old
[48:34] and I can see him like some of these
[48:37] older people
[48:38] uh
[48:43] and suddenly they're a little bit
[48:45] shaking
[48:46] okay and I can't see oh Joshua was was
[48:49] was an older man and so these Elders
[48:52] came and they asked him about the vision
[48:53] I can see him to stand up with his art
[48:56] Treatise you know
[48:57] I said gentlemen I want to let you want
[48:59] to sing one thing
[49:02] Revelation has nothing to do with age
[49:05] [Laughter]
[49:09] he said I don't know what is your
[49:11] opinion about that message but as for me
[49:13] and my house we serve the Lords
[49:16] keep one thing in mind you're never too
[49:19] young to serve the Lord
[49:21] never
[49:23] because the same voice that tell the
[49:25] young people you are too young is the
[49:27] same voice he will tell you five years
[49:28] later you are not too old
[49:30] that's Satan himself
[49:32] you're never to your and you're never
[49:34] too old
[49:35] Revelation is not a question of age
[49:39] can you say Amen
[49:41] so Joshua was a man who could see all
[49:44] the uh all the scandals in the first
[49:48] Exodus
[49:50] he was not now if he was there when when
[49:53] when when Dayton rose up when Cara rose
[49:56] up when Miriam rose up he was there he
[49:59] saw all the backs black spots
[50:03] in what they call the message of Yahweh
[50:06] for their day
[50:08] look on upon the human
[50:14] [Applause]
[50:15] brother uh I was raised up in the world
[50:19] completely
[50:20] and what happened is when we came to
[50:22] Jesus uh we didn't see the message in
[50:25] the beginning but just little bits
[50:28] fundamental thing and
[50:32] um we're making sometimes Street
[50:34] evangelizations okay and you always have
[50:37] people who tell you there's nothing in
[50:41] Christianity it's just a little bit
[50:43] people are a little bit brainwashed you
[50:45] just change your religion you change
[50:47] your but I came out of the world as I
[50:51] said yesterday I was a Michael Jackson
[50:52] fan I could dance like Michael Jackson
[50:55] honestly I can make the moon walk if you
[50:57] want but we will not make it here okay
[50:59] but if somebody wants to discuss with me
[51:02] that there is nothing in Christianity I
[51:06] tell him brother honestly you come too
[51:08] late
[51:09] you're too late
[51:10] because I see it in my own life
[51:13] the changing is more than just Theory
[51:16] and a person wants to discuss about the
[51:19] messenger and brother Branham and if
[51:21] there were 13 people who fell from that
[51:23] bridge of 15 people that for me it does
[51:26] not have any importance if there were 13
[51:29] or 15 people falling from that Ohio
[51:31] Bridge
[51:32] but I can see the effect of the open
[51:35] word in my own life
[51:38] and I think honestly brother you come
[51:40] too late honestly because because uh
[51:43] brother you you you you are too sleepy
[51:46] if somebody wants to discuss about the
[51:47] messenger he said brother you had 50
[51:49] years too late because it went from the
[51:51] messenger to the message
[51:55] it went from the prophet to the prophecy
[51:59] we are not brand hamites we are
[52:01] Christians
[52:03] well this is bright age
[52:05] can you say Amen
[52:07] so judge so Joshua he saw all the
[52:10] scandals and brother where there are
[52:13] human beings there are scandals
[52:15] that's normal there's Humanity there is
[52:18] weakness there is failures there is
[52:20] headlines there's did you see this and
[52:22] did you see that but I want to say the
[52:24] young people don't don't look left or
[52:26] right look on the promised Age The
[52:29] Promised word for this age can you say
[52:31] Amen
[52:33] so what happens is this and and that's
[52:36] going to a little bit of a teaching what
[52:38] it means
[52:39] to
[52:41] bring a vision for the Next Generation
[52:45] not a Doctrine
[52:47] a vision
[52:49] not some Brandon pictures
[52:53] that that will not save nobody
[52:55] you can become fan of Jeffersonville fan
[52:59] of Marcus Becker but that will not
[53:01] change your life
[53:03] until you find God in that whole thing
[53:06] as we were saying yesterday it's it's
[53:10] it's so important to find brother
[53:11] Branham in the Bible
[53:14] then it makes him to be a Biblical
[53:15] Prophet but it takes more than this you
[53:18] must find yourself in the Bible
[53:22] I know that I'm repeating myself but I'm
[53:24] just talking just from my heart that
[53:26] somebody hear it again
[53:28] amen we remember when that airplane when
[53:30] it when it when it when it when when it
[53:33] stopped there in Memphis and brother
[53:34] Graham heard that voice he says just go
[53:37] and he just went
[53:39] and here was that woman and brother by
[53:41] him called it a negro woman I'm not
[53:43] political correct but you understand
[53:44] what he wants to if you call it black or
[53:46] colored or African origin however what
[53:49] it let me call it brother Braham said
[53:50] huh and he was the woman hanging over
[53:53] that fence
[53:55] and when brother Brandon passed by she
[53:58] said hello Parson
[54:00] that correct no God is in humor
[54:03] normally it's brother Branham Discerning
[54:06] the people
[54:07] your name is Eva I can see you here is a
[54:10] car accident I can see you here but here
[54:12] that woman discerns the prophet
[54:15] he does not know who she is but she
[54:18] knows who he is
[54:20] amen
[54:21] amen and then she says this he said
[54:24] you're a person you are the Prophet
[54:26] Elijah and then she said something which
[54:28] is even higher than this and I am the
[54:30] shunamide woman
[54:33] amen so you find out who the messenger
[54:36] is and then you find out and then then I
[54:38] must be the bride
[54:41] can you say Amen we heard yesterday
[54:44] nobody can preach you into it and nobody
[54:47] can preach you out of it
[54:48] nobody can you say Amen so we see that
[54:53] we are in another Exodus and we have a
[54:56] every every Exodus or every Redemption
[54:59] has two parts
[55:01] it's a coming out
[55:04] by a pillar of fire and a going in
[55:08] amen there is many people who left the
[55:12] illuminationalism they left the world
[55:14] they left the Pentecostals whatever they
[55:17] left but the question is did they go in
[55:21] into the Promised lands and our
[55:24] inheritance is not leaving Egypt our
[55:26] inheritance is the promised lands can
[55:29] you say Amen
[55:30] now there were different ministers in
[55:34] that Exodus
[55:35] we have some Daytons in some chorus
[55:39] uh I mean well I'm not I'm not a
[55:42] critical type of a person but Dayton and
[55:45] Korra said we have a Ministry too
[55:48] so my tapes are as good as brother
[55:51] branham's tapes
[55:52] I said well you can have a wonderful
[55:55] message you can have a wonderful
[55:57] preaching but laodicea has only one
[56:00] voice
[56:01] in the days therefore we are not
[56:04] promoting our own tapes I'm not for it
[56:06] I'm not in it I don't want nobody to
[56:10] stream me
[56:11] I'm against it because I find out that
[56:15] young people became fans of preachers
[56:19] and it never helped him on long-term
[56:21] effects you must find Christ in your
[56:24] heart
[56:25] and you must be able you must undersea
[56:28] understand that I know we have a slogan
[56:31] in Germany which says the grass of the
[56:33] neighbor is always greener than your own
[56:35] grass you have the same in your country
[56:37] and then you get jealous why didn't I
[56:40] live in these states why don't I live in
[56:42] God placed you here and God will take
[56:46] care of you here
[56:48] can you say Amen
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:51] so we have these people that that that
[56:55] that were not really cults okay
[57:00] brother if somebody is not called of God
[57:03] he can talk
[57:05] but a talker is more than a minister a
[57:07] minister is more than a talker
[57:10] these people were politicians they could
[57:12] talk Jason and Korra
[57:14] but I want to say you one thing
[57:16] if you're not following a certain
[57:20] development from Egypt to the promised
[57:23] lands
[57:24] and you are following just a talker
[57:27] you are just walking in circles
[57:32] amen
[57:33] and if you're just walking in a circle
[57:36] you come to the point that you have to
[57:39] entertain people
[57:42] that's the reason in the message after
[57:44] brother Birmingham left we have always a
[57:46] new man of the hour
[57:47] you have to invite him so that the
[57:50] pillar of fire comes you have to invite
[57:52] this brother we saw yesterday the tent
[57:54] Vision I will meet you there
[57:58] where is the tent the bride is the tents
[58:01] we saw it yesterday
[58:03] amen that's interpretation but it was a
[58:06] symbolic vision
[58:08] amen amen so so people go from one event
[58:12] to the next event and they don't
[58:14] understand that they are just
[58:15] entertained for the next three months
[58:19] but in the bride there is a true growth
[58:23] you're not the same when you leave that
[58:25] year 2022 please look back into January
[58:30] 2022 and you must be able to say I'm not
[58:33] the same person
[58:36] that that entered into 2022.
[58:41] only grow in knowledge but my character
[58:43] was molded
[58:45] it can you say Amen
[58:48] amen therefore
[58:50] if a minister was never in the promised
[58:53] land how can you lead people into the
[58:56] Promised lands
[59:00] how can you do this he can entertain
[59:02] people but he cannot lead them really
[59:03] into a full adoption
[59:06] blessed be the name of the Lord so we
[59:08] have it we have a going out
[59:11] and we have an entering in
[59:13] therefore maybe I'm you know I'm I'm
[59:16] missing some time words and sometimes I
[59:18] have like a soldiers
[59:19] English that means I always make a
[59:21] subject predicate object subject
[59:23] predicate object because I'm I'm I'm I'm
[59:26] I'm I'm not a native English speaker uh
[59:29] and I'm I don't have the variation of
[59:31] words but I'm strongly against the fact
[59:34] that somebody says I'm in the message
[59:36] what does that mean I'm in the message
[59:38] nothing
[59:40] nothing
[59:42] amen you can be you can be a child
[59:44] abuser and be in the message
[59:47] the question is am I in the promised
[59:49] land or not
[59:51] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[59:54] Lord all these people in the first
[59:55] Exodus they were in the message
[59:58] amen so I want to encourage you to
[1:00:01] continue into the promised land and we
[1:00:04] will see this morning that we are
[1:00:06] already in the promised land next one
[1:00:07] please okay
[1:00:08] can you can you help the technician
[1:00:10] thank you now we have seen this and if
[1:00:13] it's fine for you I put off my coat okay
[1:00:14] because I'm really making here jogging
[1:00:18] that that's what that's what I told I
[1:00:20] mean I really love your worship really
[1:00:22] love that atmosphere uh but sometimes
[1:00:24] you go to to different countries like uh
[1:00:27] uh whatever
[1:00:32] I understand it's a mixed mixed
[1:00:34] multitude here
[1:00:36] okay and sometimes they have a they have
[1:00:39] a they have a song service you know I
[1:00:41] mean and and I'm in it I'm really I'm
[1:00:43] I'm many times invited for you scams so
[1:00:45] but if you think for 45 minutes
[1:00:52] these people after 45 minutes they are
[1:00:55] finished you know no honestly you don't
[1:00:57] have to preach anymore because they are
[1:00:58] just
[1:01:01] so so everything is a balance in life
[1:01:04] always keep a balance between everything
[1:01:05] okay
[1:01:07] so now friends I believe that he is the
[1:01:09] same yesterday today and forever I
[1:01:11] believe he's just as able this afternoon
[1:01:13] to cross in this building what does
[1:01:15] brother Graham say a paradox
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:19] how much more it is leaving the Bible to
[1:01:22] this very age that we are living the
[1:01:24] Ephesians again of the church ages we
[1:01:27] got seven Church ages and we are
[1:01:28] promised that at the loudest Seer Church
[1:01:31] age there would be another Ephesians
[1:01:34] keep in mind not Ephesus but Ephesians
[1:01:37] that's the difference
[1:01:39] I mean that's right therefore we see we
[1:01:41] have seven Church ages
[1:01:43] seven Messengers but we have a church or
[1:01:47] we have a time and age in between of
[1:01:50] laodicea what we call Bright age
[1:01:54] brother Brahm said another Ephesians
[1:01:57] now why Ephesians because when for every
[1:02:00] marriage
[1:02:01] we are reading Ephesians I think
[1:02:03] Ephesians 5. husband love your wife the
[1:02:07] mystery is great because I speak of
[1:02:09] Christ and the church so the church
[1:02:13] received their husband which is Christ
[1:02:14] himself can you say Amen so therefore
[1:02:18] bright age is not another church age we
[1:02:21] are still in love this year
[1:02:23] but we are not allowed this year we're
[1:02:25] not we cannot be look how simple it is
[1:02:30] that we are living in loud is here
[1:02:32] because our precious sister Arden is not
[1:02:36] the prime minister in the millennium
[1:02:38] she's not a man
[1:02:41] but uh we are still living here
[1:02:45] but the bride went already up
[1:02:50] spiritually
[1:02:52] in rapturing Grace
[1:02:55] why why is this so important
[1:02:58] not because brother Graham said till the
[1:03:00] end he said Christ Revelation chapter 3
[1:03:04] he's knocking at the door but the door
[1:03:06] of laodicea is closed
[1:03:09] at the same time we believe that we live
[1:03:12] in a
[1:03:14] invisible Union
[1:03:16] invisible Union between the Heavenly
[1:03:18] bridegroom and the and the Earthly
[1:03:20] bright
[1:03:21] amen Christ and the bride right in the
[1:03:24] Union right now it's a marriage right
[1:03:26] now the feast is over there but the
[1:03:29] marriage is already here
[1:03:31] so if Christ is not in laodicea because
[1:03:34] the door is closed and you want to have
[1:03:36] a want to have a reunion with him but he
[1:03:39] cannot come into laodice here that means
[1:03:41] the bride must live loud is here to go
[1:03:43] out of the camp in order to have
[1:03:45] fellowship with him
[1:03:47] if somebody says I'm still in laodice
[1:03:50] here spiritually I said okay fine and
[1:03:52] you are blind miserable and and wretched
[1:03:55] and I believe the bride is not blind
[1:03:58] no amen the bride is not miserable amen
[1:04:01] I mean because her glory is the Lord
[1:04:04] and the bride is not wretched because
[1:04:06] the husband is here he is here
[1:04:08] hallelujah can you say Amen but it's not
[1:04:11] enough at church age because we have
[1:04:13] just seven okay but it's a special time
[1:04:17] this time that we live in is spiritually
[1:04:21] what seven Church ages waited upon
[1:04:24] amen next one please so so we have to
[1:04:28] understand this amen we have seven
[1:04:32] Church ages
[1:04:34] and
[1:04:35] up there
[1:04:37] that uh red triangle is our Promised
[1:04:41] Land spiritually said
[1:04:46] it's our
[1:04:49] it's the purpose of the whole New
[1:04:51] Testaments
[1:04:52] amen but if you see face virtue
[1:04:56] knowledge one two three four five seven
[1:04:58] is brotherly love
[1:05:00] that means we have an eighth H we don't
[1:05:02] have an eighth age it's out of the Bible
[1:05:04] so that triangle has to come down
[1:05:08] connect with the rest of the body and we
[1:05:10] have seven again
[1:05:12] can you say Amen
[1:05:15] but we see in the beginning the day of
[1:05:18] Pentecost was in the beginning
[1:05:24] before the first church eight starts
[1:05:27] to understand what it means to enter
[1:05:30] into the promised land means to
[1:05:32] understand your beginning okay let us
[1:05:35] now see the beginning make the next one
[1:05:38] please
[1:05:39] make a good Bible
[1:05:42] orientated study
[1:05:44] the resume of the church age with this
[1:05:48] principle in mind we start to trace the
[1:05:50] church through the various Seven Ages
[1:05:53] the birth of the church was at Pentecost
[1:05:56] as the first Adam was giving a bride
[1:05:58] fresh from the hand of God and for an
[1:06:01] undefiled for a brief span so was Christ
[1:06:04] the last Adam given a bright pure and
[1:06:06] fresh and Pentecost and she remained
[1:06:09] separated and undefiled for some time
[1:06:11] and so forth
[1:06:13] how long this continued we do not know
[1:06:15] but one day even as Eve was tempted and
[1:06:18] seduced by Satan so the church was
[1:06:20] contaminated by the entrance of an
[1:06:22] antichrist spirit and this is that
[1:06:24] Spirit of antichrist whereof you have
[1:06:26] heard that it would should come and even
[1:06:28] now already it is in the world
[1:06:30] John 4 3 amen
[1:06:33] the church was in that first age already
[1:06:37] a fallen woman
[1:06:38] as Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam
[1:06:41] even now had Satan seduced the church
[1:06:43] the bride of Christ before the marriage
[1:06:46] supper of the lamb and what specifically
[1:06:48] was in her midst that caused her to fall
[1:06:51] now I start that little
[1:06:53] uh
[1:06:55] exhortation
[1:06:57] with two statements
[1:06:59] that nobody in misunderstands me every
[1:07:03] young person needs a new birth
[1:07:06] don't listen you need a Holy Ghost
[1:07:09] I said yesterday
[1:07:11] we have to pay attention not to educate
[1:07:14] our youngsters to become rich young
[1:07:17] rulers
[1:07:18] they know to behave in the church they
[1:07:21] have the right dressing they have the
[1:07:23] right Behavior they read the message but
[1:07:25] then they don't know what Grace is
[1:07:27] They Don't Know What Love Is they don't
[1:07:30] know what what what what what a heavenly
[1:07:32] father is so everybody needs
[1:07:35] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:37] the other thing is this the new birth is
[1:07:40] not the end of our spiritual journey in
[1:07:43] fact it's the beginning
[1:07:46] it's the beginning of the thing not the
[1:07:48] end of it
[1:07:49] our final destination is not the new
[1:07:52] birth it's a pure adoption
[1:07:55] can you say Amen
[1:07:57] that's so important the second statement
[1:08:00] that I want to make which is provokense
[1:08:03] if you don't accept it right now it's
[1:08:06] not a problem
[1:08:08] uh lay it under your pillow
[1:08:10] but my question is this I know that
[1:08:13] brother Brian uses used that word of
[1:08:15] back to Pentecost it became a slogan in
[1:08:17] the message and there's nothing wrong
[1:08:19] with that slogan if you place it right
[1:08:23] if you misplace it you bring people back
[1:08:26] to another age into a glare of another
[1:08:28] age
[1:08:29] but if the first church was already a
[1:08:33] fallen woman when Paul came why should I
[1:08:35] go back to something that fell in the
[1:08:37] beginning
[1:08:38] yeah true
[1:08:41] yeah
[1:08:42] if the first church was already
[1:08:44] according to the prophet a fallen woman
[1:08:46] when the first messenger came why should
[1:08:49] I go back to the to to the first why
[1:08:52] should I go back to something that fell
[1:08:53] in the beginning
[1:08:56] I mean
[1:08:57] don't you think that we have more than
[1:09:00] they ever had before
[1:09:02] amen okay let's explain what happened
[1:09:04] and then you will understand that
[1:09:07] provoking statement that I made right
[1:09:09] here let's look and let the Bible speak
[1:09:11] for itself and then you understand why
[1:09:14] we have to enter
[1:09:15] into Canaan everybody has amen make the
[1:09:19] next one please I thank the technician
[1:09:21] for coming
[1:09:22] now to understand the book of Acts is to
[1:09:26] understand Jewish religion
[1:09:29] the Jews in their time are the synagogue
[1:09:34] consisted of
[1:09:36] three types of people okay one were true
[1:09:40] Jews
[1:09:43] everybody who has a Jewish mother
[1:09:44] becomes a Jew
[1:09:46] the Jewish religion is not an
[1:09:49] evangelistical religion though you can
[1:09:51] become a Jew if you want one of the most
[1:09:54] famous prosolites becoming a Jew is
[1:09:57] Marilyn Monroe
[1:09:59] because she married Arthur Miller who
[1:10:01] was a Jew and she changed from
[1:10:03] Christianity to
[1:10:05] Judaism she became a Jew
[1:10:08] the second group of people in the
[1:10:10] synagogue where what we call proselytes
[1:10:14] proselytes are people
[1:10:16] who are in favor of that religion but
[1:10:20] they don't want to go all the way they
[1:10:21] for example they don't want to be
[1:10:22] circumcised but their love for example
[1:10:26] the the uh the moral part of Judaism
[1:10:29] which was always highly morally they
[1:10:32] love this
[1:10:33] so you can call it people who who who
[1:10:36] who are not born Jews but they try as
[1:10:40] Jewish as possible
[1:10:42] and the third group of people is what we
[1:10:44] call God-fearing people they are all
[1:10:47] listed up in the book of Acts I will you
[1:10:49] not use my time for this God-fearing
[1:10:52] people is people who love to go to the
[1:10:55] synagogue but they take what they want
[1:10:58] to take and they reject what they want
[1:11:00] to reject they're not Jews but they love
[1:11:03] the service they love the kind of
[1:11:05] let me say it like this
[1:11:08] you have a right in this message
[1:11:11] to be just a simple sympathent of the
[1:11:15] message
[1:11:16] you have a right to do somebody says
[1:11:18] look if brother Brown speaks against the
[1:11:20] television doesn't interest me I do what
[1:11:24] I want God says you can be whatever you
[1:11:26] want you can choose a sister can choose
[1:11:29] to wear dresses or not we are not a sect
[1:11:33] I mean gospel is for God born again
[1:11:36] people
[1:11:37] I mean you have to understand we are
[1:11:40] that was our mistake for many many years
[1:11:42] we tried to let our lives our children
[1:11:44] live as if they would have the Holy
[1:11:46] Ghost but they never had the Holy Ghost
[1:11:48] so it brought a constant frustration
[1:11:51] upon the family upon the pastor upon the
[1:11:54] people about the young people if
[1:11:56] somebody is not born again he's worldly
[1:12:00] okay that's what it is so you have a
[1:12:04] right don't argue with me somebody says
[1:12:06] brother Marcus we have these Germans and
[1:12:08] they say they say I like my beer I said
[1:12:11] brother Brian said that Nazarite doesn't
[1:12:13] drink alcohol I said I still love my
[1:12:15] beer I said that's fine that's up to you
[1:12:17] that's between you and God who am I amen
[1:12:20] you have a right to choose your way with
[1:12:23] God but one thing is sure the bride will
[1:12:26] take all the way
[1:12:28] okay but there are people who who who
[1:12:31] are in the message because of the moral
[1:12:34] standard they like it they're not
[1:12:35] interested in Mysteries leave these
[1:12:38] people like they are they're good people
[1:12:40] as I said yesterday brother Abraham said
[1:12:42] Abraham was a silver dollar lot was just
[1:12:46] some pennies but some pennies have a
[1:12:48] value
[1:12:50] I mean you go into a grocery shop and
[1:12:52] you buy some bananas and it's 1.15 he
[1:12:56] said here you have my dollar and the man
[1:12:57] said where are the 15 cents
[1:13:00] I mean pennies is not nothing pennies is
[1:13:03] anything and here's what brother Brandon
[1:13:06] says he said some people are just
[1:13:08] pennies
[1:13:09] but God uses sometime those pennies
[1:13:13] praise the Lord if somebody is not
[1:13:16] bright you will not change him to be a
[1:13:18] bride by just yelling at the person
[1:13:21] we learned in our life we cannot change
[1:13:24] things that God never changed amen so
[1:13:27] these are three three type of people
[1:13:29] okay
[1:13:30] so the gospel comes
[1:13:34] and you have to understand judahism I'm
[1:13:36] sure that brother Adrian will will as in
[1:13:39] Israel uh Noah he will agree with me
[1:13:43] when the first church started
[1:13:46] the day of Pentecost they were the
[1:13:50] fulfilling of Joel and so forth
[1:13:53] the Jews were waiting for the Messiah
[1:13:56] that's what they said on the way to Emos
[1:13:58] we thought he would rebuild the kingdom
[1:14:02] of God again but they had in their mind
[1:14:05] a political Kingdom
[1:14:07] exactly the Jews until today were not
[1:14:10] convert to Christianity
[1:14:13] because they believe the Jews are the
[1:14:15] chosen people till the end
[1:14:18] they say and that is what Jesus said in
[1:14:21] the book of of of of of of Mark
[1:14:25] he said and he taught saying unto them
[1:14:28] it is not written my house shall be
[1:14:30] called of all Nations the House of
[1:14:33] Prayer
[1:14:35] Jews believe that everybody will become
[1:14:38] Jew at the end or at least respect
[1:14:42] Jewish religion
[1:14:43] therefore they built the Third Temple in
[1:14:46] to think that this scripture will be
[1:14:48] fulfilled that the whole world will now
[1:14:51] uh Worship in Jerusalem the Jewish god
[1:14:54] the god of Elohim hmm
[1:14:58] so what happens is this
[1:15:01] that they believed in the Holy Spirit
[1:15:05] because it was prophesied by Joel but
[1:15:09] they didn't see that they are now
[1:15:11] leaving Judaism and now a new religion
[1:15:15] start by the name of Christianity the
[1:15:17] first Christians were Jews with the Holy
[1:15:21] Spirit
[1:15:23] they didn't they never called themselves
[1:15:25] Christians they were called the first
[1:15:27] one were an Antioch they were Jews but
[1:15:31] now is the holy spirit okay make the
[1:15:33] next one please
[1:15:34] because that is very very important now
[1:15:37] you put on your spiritual jacket you
[1:15:39] understand why you have to enter into
[1:15:41] the land the day of Pentecost was 33
[1:15:45] after Christ 1833 then we have the
[1:15:49] conversion of Saint Paul
[1:15:51] and then Peter goes up in the house of
[1:15:54] Cornelius and now I prove you by the
[1:15:56] scripture
[1:15:58] he said this he entered into the house
[1:16:00] of Cornelius and here's Peter
[1:16:03] around about 10 years after the day of
[1:16:05] Pentecost round about seven six ten
[1:16:08] years not precisely
[1:16:10] he said and he said unto them you know
[1:16:12] that it is an unlawful thing for a man
[1:16:16] that is a Jew to keep company or to come
[1:16:20] unto one of another Nation but God has
[1:16:22] showed me and so forth so Peter
[1:16:26] identified himself to be a Jew
[1:16:30] got it he comes into the house of
[1:16:33] Cornelius and he doesn't say Okay Jewish
[1:16:35] tradition is over we have changing of
[1:16:37] dispensation we are Christians he said
[1:16:39] it's unlawful for a man who is a Jew
[1:16:42] though he had already his Pentecost
[1:16:48] but he did not know who he was
[1:16:51] therefore he continued with Jewish
[1:16:54] tradition and you see at the end that
[1:16:57] the church in Jerusalem though they had
[1:17:00] The Holy Spirits
[1:17:02] that when Paul came James said to him
[1:17:05] look your ministry is great it's
[1:17:07] wonderful but there is so much stir what
[1:17:10] does he say go into the temple
[1:17:13] shave your hair and show that you obey
[1:17:16] the loss of your father
[1:17:20] that was the pastor in Jerusalem
[1:17:23] 20 years after the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:26] Ghost
[1:17:27] they were the first church but they were
[1:17:29] completely Jewish
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:33] so the first Christians we fight in
[1:17:37] Antioch and I want to now show you the
[1:17:40] problem and you you're just with me then
[1:17:42] you will really understand how we have
[1:17:45] to proceed into the promised land a
[1:17:47] vision for the Next Generation
[1:17:49] now we make a separation line look for
[1:17:52] example okay we make it here you are
[1:17:54] this part and the rest is this part
[1:17:58] you are converted Christians after the
[1:18:01] day of Pentecost
[1:18:02] one of the three thousand and later
[1:18:05] you come now to the Christian Church
[1:18:09] James is your pastor
[1:18:11] but James and the church at that time
[1:18:14] they were still serving the Torah they
[1:18:17] still went into the temple to worship as
[1:18:19] before
[1:18:22] they were reading the Torah they were
[1:18:24] having their Shabbat nothing changed
[1:18:26] only that they were gathering themselves
[1:18:28] around the word of God because there
[1:18:30] were just some Scrolls
[1:18:32] but they knew we are the Fulfillment of
[1:18:36] Joel so I will pour out my Holy Spirit
[1:18:38] upon All Flesh that's us praise the Lord
[1:18:41] God confirmed let's serve uh Jehovah
[1:18:44] better than ever
[1:18:46] now you are the group
[1:18:50] okay you are that group
[1:18:53] you came later to Christianity and you
[1:18:57] don't know what Judaism is
[1:18:59] you came from Antioch
[1:19:02] you never read the Torah
[1:19:05] you don't have you don't know what
[1:19:06] Shabbat is because you see but you are
[1:19:09] now Christians
[1:19:11] and you understand how Paul had to bring
[1:19:13] both sides and he bring them to the
[1:19:15] Cross he said some whole special days
[1:19:18] higher than others others don't
[1:19:21] because he's now speaking to two
[1:19:23] complete different groups
[1:19:26] they say look you have to be circumcised
[1:19:29] because it is an eternal Covenant of God
[1:19:32] and Jesus Christ never took that
[1:19:35] Covenant away
[1:19:36] you say I mean
[1:19:39] we never know what the circumcision is
[1:19:41] We Believe In Christ we believe in the
[1:19:42] cross in Calvary I mean what you see
[1:19:45] they say
[1:19:47] you have we cannot work on Shabbat
[1:19:50] because this is an eternal Jesus never
[1:19:52] said I will I will uh demolish the law
[1:19:55] he said I will fulfill every law
[1:19:58] they do not work on Shabbat they say I
[1:20:01] don't know Shabbat what is your Shabbat
[1:20:03] Shabbat is working day
[1:20:06] you can imagine the tangents
[1:20:08] both were in the Church of Antioch
[1:20:13] you got it the first church the First
[1:20:16] Christian Church were Jews with the Holy
[1:20:19] Spirit
[1:20:20] Peter said I'm a Jew
[1:20:22] though he had the day of Pentecost
[1:20:24] already behind it you have the same Holy
[1:20:27] Spirit but you don't have any kind of
[1:20:28] Jewish tradition but the Bible says
[1:20:30] there's one faith
[1:20:32] one large
[1:20:34] so there's two different groups I want
[1:20:36] do you want to be the pastor of that
[1:20:37] group
[1:20:41] man but
[1:20:44] Paulie had to he had to address to them
[1:20:47] but he had to show look there's a
[1:20:49] changing of dispensation but he had no
[1:20:50] real word for it
[1:20:53] so what they find out is we will meet in
[1:20:57] Jerusalem for the Jerusalem uh what they
[1:21:00] call Jerusalem Council
[1:21:02] amen and I make that long story short so
[1:21:05] they come up to Jerusalem
[1:21:08] he says and the Bible says acts 15 and
[1:21:11] certain men which came down from the
[1:21:13] Judea taught the Brethren and said
[1:21:16] except you be circumcised after the
[1:21:19] manner of Moses you cannot be saved
[1:21:23] so it's now a question of salvation
[1:21:26] he said you cannot be safe they say okay
[1:21:30] I was never certain said why should I be
[1:21:32] circumcised
[1:21:33] exactly but it rose up certain of the
[1:21:37] sect of the Pharisees which believed so
[1:21:40] they were Christians former Pharisees
[1:21:42] amen which believed
[1:21:46] saying that it was needful to circumcise
[1:21:49] them and to command them to keep the law
[1:21:51] of Moses because they can refer to Jesus
[1:21:53] Christ and Jesus Christ never abolished
[1:21:56] the law of Moses never amen and the
[1:21:59] apostles and Elders came together for to
[1:22:02] consider of this matter matter and when
[1:22:06] there had been much disputing Peter rose
[1:22:08] up and said unto them man and Brethren
[1:22:10] you know that a good while ago God made
[1:22:13] Choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my
[1:22:16] mouth should heal the word of the gospel
[1:22:19] and belief it continues then all the
[1:22:23] multitude kept silence and gave audience
[1:22:25] to Barnabas and Paul the Bible doesn't
[1:22:27] say Paul and Barnabas but Barnabas and
[1:22:29] Paul
[1:22:30] hmm
[1:22:32] Simon has declared how God at first did
[1:22:34] visit the Gentiles to take out of them a
[1:22:37] people for his name and to disagree the
[1:22:39] words of the Prophet as it is written
[1:22:41] and so on look
[1:22:45] they have now a dispute
[1:22:49] and let us make now a choice
[1:22:54] who will now give an answer to that big
[1:22:57] disputes
[1:22:58] if we could choose we would have would
[1:23:01] have chosen all of them Peter
[1:23:03] because Peter is the one who got the
[1:23:06] Keys of the Kingdom Peter was the one
[1:23:08] who was sent first to the Gentiles Peter
[1:23:11] was the one who who was the spokesman of
[1:23:13] the day of Pentecost
[1:23:15] amen is that correct
[1:23:18] Peter was the one Peter was the most
[1:23:20] prominent one Peter was the one who the
[1:23:23] Lord says feed my sheep
[1:23:25] Paul was not born yet or was not in
[1:23:28] inside now you put now you put on your
[1:23:31] spiritual jacket and then I show you how
[1:23:33] you have more than the early church ever
[1:23:36] had
[1:23:38] while you're sitting you say we don't
[1:23:40] have the same Miracles that's not the
[1:23:41] question but you have more insight
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] because Paul said I was born to be a man
[1:23:50] out of season
[1:23:53] as Paul was not in the upper room
[1:23:55] brother Branham was not in Azusa Street
[1:24:00] and brother babe said I'm like Paul I'm
[1:24:02] a man born out of season
[1:24:04] amen you get it
[1:24:06] so they had the upper room experience
[1:24:08] and God kept Paul away
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:14] so that the first church could fall
[1:24:16] not in sin they have the Holy Spirit but
[1:24:20] they did not know who they were they
[1:24:21] still believed that they were Jews
[1:24:24] amen make the next one because here's
[1:24:27] what brother Brahm says a seal is open
[1:24:30] what is it a mystery is unfold and when
[1:24:33] a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sound
[1:24:35] it declares a war or a plague Falls a
[1:24:38] church age open C what is that war the
[1:24:42] angel of the church catches the mystery
[1:24:44] of God not yet fulfill revealed but when
[1:24:49] he does he catches the mystery of God
[1:24:51] and then he goes forth to the people and
[1:24:54] so forth
[1:24:55] now here is the thing you put on your
[1:24:57] spiritual jacket why the first church
[1:24:59] fell Paul was the spokesman Peter was
[1:25:03] the spokesman
[1:25:04] but Paul was the angel
[1:25:11] but Paul was not considered to be the
[1:25:14] angel
[1:25:15] for them Paul was just a nice missionary
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:22] but you can never find your own
[1:25:25] identification
[1:25:27] if you don't see who the messenger of
[1:25:28] that age is
[1:25:31] you understand that I mean in the Garden
[1:25:33] of Eden
[1:25:35] Eve could talk to all kinds of animals
[1:25:38] Mr elephant uh that's so wonderful can
[1:25:41] you tell me who I am from where I come
[1:25:43] from and Mr elephant said I don't know
[1:25:45] it's just a wonderful time here but I
[1:25:48] don't know from where I'm coming
[1:25:49] there was only one who could tell Eve
[1:25:52] from where she comes and that was Adam
[1:25:55] Adam could say you come from me
[1:25:59] and there is only one who can tell the
[1:26:01] bride who she is from where she comes
[1:26:03] and that's Christ
[1:26:04] so Paul was among them and he was the
[1:26:08] messenger but he's not recognized
[1:26:09] recognized to be the messenger
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:14] so Peter spoke
[1:26:16] James spoke the Apostle spoke now if we
[1:26:19] would be transformed in the early church
[1:26:22] here's Marcus Becker
[1:26:24] amen we're sitting there and I'm sure
[1:26:27] you agree
[1:26:29] I'm coming down I said hey first of all
[1:26:32] I want to say shalom
[1:26:34] second I want to say Peter sit down
[1:26:37] James sit down
[1:26:39] the angel is Paul
[1:26:43] he has the mystery
[1:26:45] it is only revealed to the angel of the
[1:26:47] age sit down and stop your discussion
[1:26:50] the angel of the churches is Right among
[1:26:52] you
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:54] but if you don't see the messenger you
[1:26:57] will not never find your position
[1:26:59] you get it the Bible never said in the
[1:27:04] book of Acts and praise the Lord and the
[1:27:06] Apostle said our Messengers they never
[1:27:09] recognized him till the end
[1:27:11] the only thing that Peter saw oh he
[1:27:13] speaks of very high things that we don't
[1:27:15] understand but the Bible never said
[1:27:17] now the the apostles found out who the
[1:27:21] messenger was
[1:27:23] because the concept of a messenger was
[1:27:26] instituted 50 years later by John on the
[1:27:30] Isle of Patmos
[1:27:33] but if you don't understand who your
[1:27:35] messenger is I mean you listen to any
[1:27:37] kind of voices
[1:27:39] so these people were full of the Holy
[1:27:41] Ghost but they did not know who they
[1:27:43] were they didn't see the change of their
[1:27:45] dispensation and neither they saw their
[1:27:47] own messenger
[1:27:49] so it was really clear if it was easy
[1:27:51] for Satan to deceive them
[1:27:55] because you only will be undeceivable if
[1:27:58] you know who you are
[1:28:00] can you say Amen therefore
[1:28:03] brother babe said the day of Pentecost
[1:28:06] was 33 after Christ
[1:28:08] and the first church it starts 53 after
[1:28:11] Christ there's 20 years
[1:28:14] and in that 20 years that woman was
[1:28:17] already a fallen woman
[1:28:25] ready you saw already what happened
[1:28:28] God allowed
[1:28:31] because if Paul would have been on the
[1:28:34] upper room one of them
[1:28:36] and being a prophet that church would
[1:28:39] have find her position and the Rapture
[1:28:40] would have gone already in the first
[1:28:41] church age
[1:28:43] can you say amen God allowed it because
[1:28:46] he has a plan for seven Church ages
[1:28:48] God blinds and he opens whenever he
[1:28:51] wants
[1:28:52] amen if brother Branham would have been
[1:28:55] 1909 or 1906 on Azusa Street and they
[1:28:58] would have received him as a prophet
[1:29:00] that church would have gone
[1:29:02] because it was the true Holy Spirit but
[1:29:04] what they were missing is that inside
[1:29:07] who they were is a placing of the word
[1:29:09] you get it
[1:29:11] now who are you
[1:29:14] who told you who the messenger is the
[1:29:16] same Holy Spirit speak unto that
[1:29:18] sunamite woman
[1:29:21] blessed be the name of the Lord look you
[1:29:23] take one of our teenagers what what is
[1:29:25] your name
[1:29:26] yeah
[1:29:27] Stella now here we have sister Stella
[1:29:29] make it simple sister Stella now she
[1:29:32] comes in a time machine
[1:29:34] jump
[1:29:36] she looks around and here comes Martin
[1:29:38] Luther
[1:29:40] Zella comes he said Martin Luther
[1:29:44] I see you brother
[1:29:48] Mr Luther
[1:29:50] let me ask you a question can you tell
[1:29:52] me who the fifth angel was
[1:29:55] Mr Russo said I don't know about these
[1:29:57] wings and all the no no that was you
[1:30:00] do you understand that the seventh angel
[1:30:02] revealed all the rest of them
[1:30:05] they say man therefore God had to send
[1:30:07] the prophets
[1:30:09] praise be to God for the Holy Spirit and
[1:30:12] never diminish it but it's the beginning
[1:30:15] now to come into your full full
[1:30:17] identification can you say Amen
[1:30:21] that was the problem Peter was the
[1:30:23] spokesman Peter had the prominence
[1:30:26] but he had no clue
[1:30:29] because he was not the Angels this
[1:30:31] mystery comes to the angel
[1:30:33] Devil's Paul and Paulie was just sitting
[1:30:36] there he said hey gentlemen
[1:30:38] see I should I'm sure that Paul knew who
[1:30:40] he is because Paul said this I am a wise
[1:30:45] master builder and everybody has to
[1:30:48] build upon what I say he knew who he was
[1:30:51] but he had no scripture
[1:30:55] and unless God is opening the eyes of
[1:30:57] these people you are just in ignorance
[1:31:00] so you can be Brides without knowing
[1:31:04] that you are
[1:31:07] unless God is revealing Who You Are
[1:31:10] and then nobody can steal it away from
[1:31:12] you therefore I'm so against all the
[1:31:16] altar calls over and over again because
[1:31:18] if I wanted to get the young people to
[1:31:21] the altar it's simple
[1:31:23] there's not a problem to have an altar
[1:31:25] called this body who among you have some
[1:31:28] time dirty thoughts no the first one is
[1:31:31] the minister himself
[1:31:34] amen
[1:31:36] who is the Holy Spirit and then I'm
[1:31:39] speaking and who doesn't pray enough and
[1:31:42] when did you make the last miracle and
[1:31:44] when it was this and the whole audience
[1:31:46] comes in the front they are sincerest
[1:31:48] people
[1:31:50] but the same Minister has to come back
[1:31:52] next year and may ask the same question
[1:31:54] the same people are in the front again
[1:31:55] it becomes a Catholic thing
[1:31:59] but you must find first who you are in
[1:32:02] the sides of Gods and from that picture
[1:32:05] on you can now develop into the full
[1:32:07] potential
[1:32:08] brother Brandon said it like this
[1:32:11] he said he said if you want to be healed
[1:32:15] you must see a healed person right
[1:32:18] before you it's your vision and you are
[1:32:21] entering into that direction and you're
[1:32:23] entering to that healed body
[1:32:25] what about the rapture
[1:32:30] the same principle you must therefore it
[1:32:34] was the grace of God going behind the
[1:32:37] curtain of time and what does he say I
[1:32:39] saw all of you there
[1:32:42] sometimes I don't feel to be bright
[1:32:44] sometimes I don't feel to be safe
[1:32:46] something but I said I don't go after my
[1:32:48] feeling I know I'm there
[1:32:51] and the reason that my representation is
[1:32:53] there is that I love that message so
[1:32:55] much
[1:32:57] can you say Amen
[1:32:59] and while I'm looking to the perfect
[1:33:01] picture of me all the Natural Things in
[1:33:03] me they just vanish away with the time
[1:33:05] my old sticky nature can you say Amen I
[1:33:09] give it the same example you say brother
[1:33:10] Marcus how can you say that a minister
[1:33:12] can have dirty feet dirty thoughts now
[1:33:14] that can happen
[1:33:16] just with me okay okay
[1:33:19] nobody has no everybody should say oh I
[1:33:21] don't understand that
[1:33:22] I cannot him here's brother Brian and
[1:33:25] brother brother Lonnie told us that that
[1:33:27] story and just if you want to help
[1:33:29] people you must be honest with them
[1:33:32] instead that one is lying to the other
[1:33:34] and one is pretending to the other man
[1:33:36] stop that thing if you know a person
[1:33:39] long enough you know he's human failures
[1:33:41] anyhow his brother Lonnie told you that
[1:33:43] thing about about the prayer line of
[1:33:45] brother Branham he said here is an older
[1:33:47] man
[1:33:48] and a brother and they had a prayer line
[1:33:50] like they had in Pentecost you know
[1:33:52] everybody is now laying hands and you go
[1:33:53] through a tunnel everybody what is not
[1:33:55] wrong
[1:33:56] laying on of hands is not wrong but it's
[1:33:59] not our message for today but it's not
[1:34:01] wrong if somebody needs it let's do it
[1:34:03] no problem so the world praying and one
[1:34:05] of the brothers had really vulgar
[1:34:07] thoughts
[1:34:08] and he was so embarrassed about that so
[1:34:11] so I mean you were in the prayer line
[1:34:12] and I think about this and I think about
[1:34:14] girls and whatever
[1:34:15] and he said then later brother praying
[1:34:17] just comes to him lays his arm he said
[1:34:19] hey brother you had a hard time isn't
[1:34:20] that so he said brother Brian I'm so
[1:34:22] embarrassed we're in the prayer line in
[1:34:24] the Holy presence of God and have these
[1:34:26] kind of wrong thoughts and brother rims
[1:34:28] said this he said these thoughts were
[1:34:30] addressed to me but we were standing in
[1:34:32] the line of fire
[1:34:33] amen you must understand that your
[1:34:36] thoughts is not you
[1:34:40] I'm not my complex
[1:34:42] I I I will speak in the next days I'm
[1:34:45] dealing with a lot of people who have
[1:34:46] psychological problems and I see how God
[1:34:48] is changing them
[1:34:50] but it's changing by showing them really
[1:34:52] their true nature and that's one of the
[1:34:54] sisters told me one time she has
[1:34:56] problems with depressions and ups and
[1:34:58] downs and a little bit maybe borderline
[1:35:00] whatever you can call it she says this
[1:35:02] brother Marcus my psyche is not my soul
[1:35:05] I said that's what it is
[1:35:07] my psyche sometimes is up and
[1:35:09] something's door went down but my soul
[1:35:11] is always in the presence of them I said
[1:35:13] hey you got something
[1:35:16] can you say Amen now I'll give you
[1:35:19] another example I'm to show how far you
[1:35:23] are already on your way if you believe
[1:35:24] it or not we're not talking who does the
[1:35:26] most miracles in our life
[1:35:28] but I show you how you have much more
[1:35:31] understanding than ever before here is
[1:35:34] brother Branham and he is in a Christian
[1:35:36] breakfast together with Billy Graham
[1:35:40] Billy Graham he says that noble words we
[1:35:42] have always heard them he said I go to a
[1:35:44] city have 30 000 converts and after one
[1:35:48] year there's only 30 left and brother
[1:35:50] blame said this who was I to talk to a
[1:35:54] great man like Billy Graham like this he
[1:35:57] said Billy who was the man and Billy
[1:36:00] Graham said you lazy preachers you lazy
[1:36:02] pastors you don't go to visit those
[1:36:04] people and brother Brian said who was
[1:36:05] the lazy Pastor visit in the converts of
[1:36:08] Paul
[1:36:09] but do you see the picture is wrong
[1:36:11] if Billy Graham would have known who is
[1:36:15] William Branham he would have shut up
[1:36:16] his mouth
[1:36:18] he would have said stop I'm an
[1:36:20] evangelist but here is the messenger
[1:36:24] but he didn't see he thought well I'm
[1:36:26] the man of full of stadiums and here's
[1:36:29] William Brandon Buddha I would have I
[1:36:30] would be there
[1:36:31] as your simple brother Marcus I said hey
[1:36:34] Billy stop that nonsense sit down or
[1:36:37] else sit down the messenger is here
[1:36:40] let's hear what he has to say
[1:36:44] can you say Amen
[1:36:46] because why is he more no but he gets
[1:36:49] the mystery for the age
[1:36:52] can you say Amen
[1:36:54] what what a Time therefore the First
[1:36:57] Church Must Fall because they don't
[1:36:59] didn't know who they were
[1:37:01] they were Jewish until we see then how
[1:37:04] the procedure goes on you know how
[1:37:05] Christianity separates and you think but
[1:37:08] Paul is here and you can see the whole
[1:37:10] book
[1:37:11] you can see the New Testaments
[1:37:13] amen there never one time is written in
[1:37:16] the book of Acts that all the apostles
[1:37:18] said now we realize the messengers here
[1:37:20] they never saw what is God was hiding
[1:37:23] that thing so that the church could fall
[1:37:25] not in sin not in immorality no no but
[1:37:29] they never found who they were
[1:37:32] when brother Ben would have been on
[1:37:34] Azusa Street we would not be here
[1:37:36] because that church would be wretched
[1:37:38] but God in his grace knew there are some
[1:37:41] kiwis who have to be saved
[1:37:45] can you say amen and some Germans who
[1:37:47] love the Lord and God says we I have
[1:37:50] some children who are out let me let me
[1:37:52] repeat what I said well I said yesterday
[1:37:54] I'm just falling make the next one
[1:37:55] please I'm because we're hurrying
[1:37:57] through amen amen here is the picture
[1:38:00] and you never make that mistake there is
[1:38:03] a message for the church
[1:38:05] whosoever will let him come
[1:38:08] brother this message is not a sec don't
[1:38:10] make it sectarian
[1:38:12] you can go with that subject of the Lamb
[1:38:14] leaves The Mercy Seat so far
[1:38:17] that I told the brother I said look
[1:38:19] here's somebody who never was a
[1:38:21] Christian
[1:38:22] okay
[1:38:24] he's now in a hospital and he has to die
[1:38:27] he finds the Bible he finds the Bible
[1:38:30] he's opening the Bible and he reads all
[1:38:33] that he loved
[1:38:34] he gave he gave all that accepted him he
[1:38:37] gave power to become Sons and Daughters
[1:38:39] of God will that man be saved without
[1:38:41] having read any message book
[1:38:44] secure
[1:38:47] because if not if you say he has to read
[1:38:50] the message you become saved and I say
[1:38:51] what kind of message before the seals
[1:38:53] are after The Seals do you understand
[1:38:54] you end up in a cult
[1:38:57] brother blame said the the Bible is the
[1:39:00] book of the year
[1:39:02] he says the Bible is the book of every
[1:39:03] year
[1:39:05] bright is different bride has a leader
[1:39:08] that is the messenger
[1:39:09] but Salvation
[1:39:11] pay attention
[1:39:13] come in here comes brother Brandon and
[1:39:15] he speaks about you about about about
[1:39:16] about about the Jews and what does he
[1:39:19] say amen he says he says when it comes
[1:39:22] to to to to to Salvation for the 140 44
[1:39:25] 000 he said now another Redemption is
[1:39:28] opened
[1:39:29] has nothing to do with the bride nothing
[1:39:31] to do with brother Brennan I mean how
[1:39:33] can that Redemption be open because of
[1:39:35] calvary
[1:39:36] because uncovery God paid the whole
[1:39:38] price it is finished for everybody who
[1:39:40] would come so if somebody comes and you
[1:39:43] see another message and and he says but
[1:39:45] I received the portion that I can give
[1:39:47] give him Grace
[1:39:49] amen if not you end up in a car you must
[1:39:53] know brother Branham to become safe
[1:39:54] brother it takes Jesus Christ away and
[1:39:57] puts William Branham at his place you
[1:39:59] cannot do this very dangerous you end up
[1:40:01] in a complete cult amen look
[1:40:04] here we go a trumpet denies denounce
[1:40:07] always War
[1:40:09] amen the angel come Earth the messenger
[1:40:12] of the hour like loose any message that
[1:40:14] we talked of what does he do he arrives
[1:40:16] a seal opened reveals a trumpet sound a
[1:40:19] wall declare away they go and then the
[1:40:21] messenger dies he seals away this group
[1:40:25] they are put in and a plague falls upon
[1:40:27] those who rejected it
[1:40:29] so here's the other Point Salvation
[1:40:31] connected to the message for their hour
[1:40:33] definitely so come in what is it then it
[1:40:38] goes on they organize get another
[1:40:39] organization make the next one please
[1:40:42] here is the next thought that we have
[1:40:45] about a vision for the Next Generation
[1:40:50] when the word is presented
[1:40:54] it is salvation or it is judgment
[1:40:59] either you're getting safe
[1:41:01] or judgment or is an ignorance that God
[1:41:04] accepts on the right thrown job you
[1:41:06] never knew the message then God has a
[1:41:08] way no problem
[1:41:10] but look and you put on your spiritual
[1:41:12] jacket
[1:41:14] he said when they were at kadish paneer
[1:41:17] to enter into that place
[1:41:20] he said what was the test they all drink
[1:41:23] the same Rock they all eat the same
[1:41:25] spiritual manner as they were eating
[1:41:26] this morning but the word tests proved
[1:41:28] them when they come of the time of
[1:41:30] kadish barnea when they started over
[1:41:32] into the promised land that's our
[1:41:34] subject and they could not go over till
[1:41:36] they was tested by the word and all the
[1:41:39] other ten came back and said we can't
[1:41:40] make it the people are like we are like
[1:41:43] grasshoppers to them they're great wall
[1:41:45] City the opposition is too great but
[1:41:47] Joshua and Caleb Still the people that
[1:41:49] said we are more than able to do it why
[1:41:52] says brother Brennan God said before
[1:41:55] they left the promised land I given you
[1:41:57] the land I've given to you it's yours
[1:41:58] but there were one out of each million
[1:42:01] I put a debt
[1:42:03] you put on the spiritual jacket
[1:42:06] how
[1:42:08] and we will see the next days how all
[1:42:10] kinds of denominations and reformations
[1:42:14] hinders your true walk with Christ
[1:42:17] this message is contrary to everything
[1:42:19] that we had until now this is bright age
[1:42:23] this is age of adoption
[1:42:26] I mean this is a time this is the time
[1:42:29] where the sun rose up
[1:42:32] now they come
[1:42:34] and these these uh these Messengers come
[1:42:39] from the promised land and they go back
[1:42:42] and they tell the people
[1:42:45] the land is true
[1:42:47] God didn't lie but what did they say
[1:42:51] we cannot make it
[1:42:55] brother you have to listen to people in
[1:42:56] the message and they speak about the
[1:42:58] Rapture they fear the rapture
[1:43:01] the the Rapture is soon and uh
[1:43:04] say brother the rapture God is not
[1:43:07] saying the Rapture for New Zealand is
[1:43:09] okay I will take I will take just these
[1:43:11] and they don't have a chance
[1:43:13] the Rapture is God taking his children
[1:43:15] home
[1:43:18] but brother I'm not ready but God made
[1:43:20] you ready already
[1:43:22] these people said
[1:43:25] the land is good but we cannot make it
[1:43:28] God said I didn't ask you to make it
[1:43:31] and they remember Joshua and Carla Caleb
[1:43:35] they had the same feel like all the rest
[1:43:38] but they remembered that God said on
[1:43:41] their Journey when you enter into the
[1:43:44] promised land you will you will have the
[1:43:46] Feast of uh unleavened bread or the
[1:43:49] Feast of Tabernacles God did not say
[1:43:54] I don't know if you make it in case that
[1:43:58] you will do it and we will see what God
[1:44:01] sees them already in the land and he
[1:44:03] says you will enter
[1:44:04] [Applause]
[1:44:06] hallelujah amen and Joshua and Caleb
[1:44:09] said we don't know how but God said we
[1:44:11] enter praise the god
[1:44:14] that was the worstest the rest looked
[1:44:17] unto themselves
[1:44:19] but Joshua and Carla looked to God's
[1:44:22] promise
[1:44:23] can you say Amen
[1:44:25] therefore this messenger said look I saw
[1:44:28] you on the other side and say praise the
[1:44:30] Lord
[1:44:32] I was preaching it because we Germans we
[1:44:35] think
[1:44:36] humble means to be negative
[1:44:41] the Rapture is very very very few
[1:44:45] and I'm not knowing if I'm worthy of
[1:44:47] that whole thing and and I don't know
[1:44:50] what Putin does
[1:44:51] and what Arden does
[1:44:53] and what the future holds and I came to
[1:44:56] the front I said praise the Lord I make
[1:44:58] it
[1:45:00] and I got criticized in the church how
[1:45:02] can you be so bold to say I make it he
[1:45:04] said because David said your goodness
[1:45:07] and mercy will follow me all the days of
[1:45:09] my life
[1:45:11] I said the same old how could David he
[1:45:13] prophesied already about his future and
[1:45:16] he became a self-fulfilling prophecy his
[1:45:19] goodness and his Mercy will follow me
[1:45:21] all a day of his life
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] humbleness is not to be a Catholic
[1:45:26] priest
[1:45:29] I I don't know if I'm
[1:45:34] words
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:38] Hallelujah I said to a person if you do
[1:45:40] not believe that God brings you home you
[1:45:42] do not believe in Calvary
[1:45:45] because you start with Calvary where God
[1:45:47] paid the whole price and now the rest
[1:45:49] you want to do it by yourself
[1:45:51] and you think the Rapture is some kind
[1:45:54] like uh like to earn something or a
[1:45:57] special Rewards
[1:45:59] the Rapture is for those who always go
[1:46:02] to church not only Sunday Wednesday too
[1:46:06] that's how we believed it
[1:46:08] you know I mean and we were thinking
[1:46:11] okay if God has to choose for the
[1:46:13] Rapture about that okay I mean I go
[1:46:16] every service yeah yeah yeah I'm better
[1:46:18] already than all of them they just come
[1:46:20] on Wednesday ah I went Sunday and then
[1:46:22] I'm paying my tithing I know he has some
[1:46:24] people they're not paying that I think
[1:46:25] so my chances
[1:46:31] my brother the Rapture is different
[1:46:33] is not a reward system God calls his
[1:46:37] children home
[1:46:39] brother that is the picture God we I
[1:46:41] know I showed it yesterday God before
[1:46:43] the foundation of the world he made a
[1:46:45] picture of himself like Oh Brother
[1:46:46] Beckett showed
[1:46:48] here was the family of God
[1:46:51] not arrogant but proud about Allah
[1:46:55] that's what I said yesterday
[1:46:57] we are the only people in the world who
[1:47:00] don't have a religion because this
[1:47:01] message is not a religion this message
[1:47:03] is our father talking to us
[1:47:05] and God made a picture and he took our
[1:47:09] souls and thrown them in seven Church
[1:47:11] ages on seven countries some in Germany
[1:47:14] some in New Zealand some here some and
[1:47:17] God knows one thing my sheep hear my
[1:47:19] voice
[1:47:20] and he knows one thing when seven
[1:47:22] churches over the family of God
[1:47:25] and the best brother by him was the
[1:47:28] messenger who could say God is not
[1:47:30] complete anymore without you
[1:47:32] because David said in the Psalms he said
[1:47:35] he even placed eternity into my heart
[1:47:39] I mean God put placed part of himself
[1:47:43] into our hearts
[1:47:45] when we were born and we were in the
[1:47:47] world there was already a mystery deep
[1:47:49] in US
[1:47:50] some of the things that brother Brandon
[1:47:53] tells him
[1:47:56] when you see that little Eagle story you
[1:47:59] see here is Mother eagle and little
[1:48:01] Eagle the little Eagle never knew that
[1:48:03] he was an eagle he was trying to be a
[1:48:06] worldly person like the rest but the
[1:48:08] mother knew who the boy was the boy did
[1:48:11] not know the mother but the mother knew
[1:48:13] who the boy was
[1:48:16] so we were in the discotheque
[1:48:19] doing all kind of nonsense and our
[1:48:21] father was already thinking oh boy
[1:48:24] it's time to call you
[1:48:26] because you make too much nonsense on
[1:48:28] this Earth
[1:48:29] amen can you see amen
[1:48:32] I remember therefore if our children
[1:48:34] don't go the way never be embarrassed
[1:48:37] God allows those things he wants to see
[1:48:39] our reaction
[1:48:41] God was never ashamed of me though I was
[1:48:44] in the world
[1:48:45] because he saw the inside part of me can
[1:48:49] you say Amen
[1:48:50] amen can you say Amen
[1:48:52] what a father we have it matters to
[1:48:56] serve the Lords I always say this amen
[1:48:59] if you look to yourself
[1:49:01] forget it
[1:49:03] gospel is good news
[1:49:05] even if you I mean if even if we are in
[1:49:08] menopause it's still good news
[1:49:11] sometimes we feel safe and sometimes we
[1:49:13] don't feel look here's the man by the
[1:49:15] name of job
[1:49:17] and he's so depressed and he's down he
[1:49:19] said curse it be the day when I was born
[1:49:22] quote the Bible curse it be today and
[1:49:24] God at the same time in heaven said
[1:49:26] that's my servant
[1:49:27] what a great man is nobody like him I'm
[1:49:30] so proud about the man and job said oh
[1:49:32] cursed to be that day I wanted the
[1:49:34] message and God said I'm so proud about
[1:49:36] my boy
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:39] because he knows if I will talk to him
[1:49:41] he will understand who he is
[1:49:43] and God just tells me ask him a question
[1:49:46] job hey stop scolding where were you boy
[1:49:49] and job was thinking oh God forgive me I
[1:49:53] talked about things that were too high
[1:49:55] can you say Amen
[1:49:57] amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:50:00] so so the same make the next one so the
[1:50:02] same we have to understand another brand
[1:50:04] in 1960.
[1:50:06] now
[1:50:09] Paradox again
[1:50:12] he said I was about three o'clock in the
[1:50:14] morning suppose I got up looked where in
[1:50:16] front of me I was coming down to Jordan
[1:50:18] looked like I was standing on the map of
[1:50:20] Palestine and I was coming down to the
[1:50:22] Jordan seemed like I could hear the song
[1:50:24] I'm going down to Jordan someone was
[1:50:27] singing it and as I drew near the river
[1:50:28] I looked back and seen which way I had
[1:50:30] come it was two-thirds of the way there
[1:50:33] to Jordan and I looked across John and
[1:50:36] said oh praise God just on the other
[1:50:38] side is where all the promises lay every
[1:50:41] promise lay in the Promised Land
[1:50:43] that means brother Brandon is 1960.
[1:50:47] but he's not yet in the Promised Land
[1:50:51] but he says I'm now enjoyed two-thirds
[1:50:54] that's my own interpretation two two two
[1:50:56] two two two pulls it's now done
[1:50:59] but he says that's not the end of my
[1:51:01] Ministry this is the beginning
[1:51:04] brother when brother when brother
[1:51:06] Brandon was rejected by the denomination
[1:51:08] they always say you can see it on
[1:51:10] YouTube that was the end of William
[1:51:12] Brandon's Ministry we say that was the
[1:51:14] beginning of our time
[1:51:16] because it changed now to become just a
[1:51:20] denominational preacher to become a
[1:51:22] bridegroom
[1:51:23] to become an Eleazar can you say Amen
[1:51:28] you remember that brother Graham speaks
[1:51:29] about about ashamed and and God says to
[1:51:33] him you are ratting on the job 1965.
[1:51:36] you're ratting on the job and brother
[1:51:37] babe thinks what is the problem that I'm
[1:51:39] writing on the job and later he preaches
[1:51:41] the pre the sermon
[1:51:44] trying to do God a servant without being
[1:51:47] in the will of God I think the service
[1:51:49] before service later and brother Benham
[1:51:52] showed something when he started that
[1:51:54] church that service he said I preach it
[1:51:56] as a correction for the church
[1:51:58] in fact he was correcting himself
[1:52:01] because when brother Branham came to
[1:52:03] South Africa in 1965 he tried to make a
[1:52:08] big meeting with the first and the
[1:52:10] second pool like they had 30 years ago
[1:52:13] but the time of the shout was over
[1:52:18] the time of just Gathering the people
[1:52:20] and Jesus Is A Healer and Jesus death
[1:52:22] was over that is now bright age
[1:52:25] and God says to him stop to be just
[1:52:28] popular you're writing on the job now
[1:52:30] you have a message for a bride rejected
[1:52:34] by the majority but loved by the brides
[1:52:38] brother babe said all hell is against
[1:52:41] that Revelation but the bride stands on
[1:52:43] it
[1:52:43] [Laughter]
[1:52:47] can you see there is a development in
[1:52:49] the message of the hour it's not God's
[1:52:51] and the prophets amend
[1:52:54] as I said yesterday I'm hurrying through
[1:52:57] I said here is now let me please say
[1:53:00] Amen
[1:53:02] you love the Lord
[1:53:03] man he is Believers I don't know how it
[1:53:06] is but he seems to be real real real
[1:53:07] Believers of that I don't need any notes
[1:53:10] just to but I have to just keep the time
[1:53:11] but good I normally very distant I'm a
[1:53:14] German that discipline no
[1:53:16] but do you see we have here uh
[1:53:20] uh we have here elieza and that was God
[1:53:23] revealed to him your ministry is elieza
[1:53:26] not only what we heard before
[1:53:29] and when elieza arrived to find a bride
[1:53:33] for Isaac there was a supernatural
[1:53:35] element because the angel of the Lord
[1:53:37] went with him
[1:53:40] and brother Ben said the angel of the
[1:53:42] Lord was half an hour faster
[1:53:47] that is the reason why you should come
[1:53:50] half an hour earlier to church
[1:53:54] I was preaching this in Zimbabwe I said
[1:53:56] look the almighty God can do great
[1:53:59] things before the songs leader starts
[1:54:01] his first song and I was preaching and a
[1:54:03] sister got her sights
[1:54:05] the next service that I got my side back
[1:54:08] before the song service starts I said
[1:54:10] he's not a preacher with holy hands it's
[1:54:12] you touching God
[1:54:14] brother the service is not that the
[1:54:16] minister said okay let's let's start the
[1:54:18] service service starts when you enter
[1:54:20] here in
[1:54:21] brother and then you you do like we did
[1:54:24] with our family I took my little girl
[1:54:25] and my wife every time we went to the
[1:54:27] alt we were praying together Heavenly
[1:54:30] Father touch my little girl speak to her
[1:54:32] and know in the past and I'm the
[1:54:33] preacher God bless you for this day and
[1:54:35] we went to our seat like brother Brandon
[1:54:37] said
[1:54:38] you don't have to do it that way but
[1:54:40] somehow
[1:54:42] so the supernatural element
[1:54:46] here is
[1:54:48] elieza
[1:54:51] and he thinks in his heart if I will
[1:54:54] tell a girl
[1:54:56] or if I will tell that girl give me to
[1:54:59] drink
[1:55:00] and she would say I give you to drink
[1:55:02] and the camels then it's her
[1:55:04] okay so here comes Now That Girl Rebecca
[1:55:12] and here's elieza and look the
[1:55:14] Supernatural part
[1:55:16] he tells her the first part of his plan
[1:55:18] give me to drink and the rest of that
[1:55:21] plan give my camel spring is in his
[1:55:22] heart
[1:55:24] he never mentions it is in his heart
[1:55:27] amen but he said if she says I will give
[1:55:29] you to drink and the chemist I know that
[1:55:31] is exactly the inspiration that I had
[1:55:34] super this message is Supernatural
[1:55:37] if you were called that was the same
[1:55:39] Holy Spirit working through 2000 years
[1:55:42] the thing that you see is the grace of
[1:55:44] God don't don't I mean exactly
[1:55:47] so she said I will give you to drink
[1:55:50] that is nice Social Gospel people are
[1:55:52] nice I give you something sweet and he
[1:55:54] can say Eliza
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:56:00] and then she says and I give the camel
[1:56:03] to drink he said that's her
[1:56:05] because she came in the channel of my
[1:56:07] own inspiration
[1:56:10] that must be the girl
[1:56:13] and he comes down into the house of
[1:56:14] Labor into a denominational Church you
[1:56:17] see and when Laban when elieza came you
[1:56:21] know he had gifts for everyone I mean
[1:56:24] everybody got a little bit gold a little
[1:56:26] bit money a little bit silver I'm a mama
[1:56:28] God Papa grandfather everybody got some
[1:56:30] gifts
[1:56:32] and everybody's happy that Eleazar was
[1:56:34] there
[1:56:35] but when it comes to Rebecca Rebecca was
[1:56:39] not interested in the gifts and the gold
[1:56:41] Rebecca wanted to have the bridegroom
[1:56:45] can you say Amen do you understand when
[1:56:47] brother Branham came to denominations
[1:56:49] they were happy about the gifts
[1:56:51] another healing another great but the
[1:56:54] bride is not interested in those things
[1:56:56] the bride wants to have the bridegroom
[1:56:58] oh man she wants to have elieza gifts or
[1:57:01] no gifts I want to have the person
[1:57:04] he said amen
[1:57:07] and then they were on their camels I
[1:57:09] mean and Rebecca asked can you tell
[1:57:10] something about about elieza about Isaac
[1:57:13] I said yes I can tell you something
[1:57:15] Christ is the mystery of God reveals I
[1:57:18] will preach two hours about that I mean
[1:57:19] who is this Melchizedek oh wow is that
[1:57:22] exactly so yeah yeah and you were in him
[1:57:24] before exactly is that so yeah the
[1:57:27] identified Christ of all time is that
[1:57:30] exactly so and in the evening time amen
[1:57:33] when they were meeting the Bible says he
[1:57:35] brought her in the tent of her mother
[1:57:37] another time tent vision amen like we
[1:57:40] were preaching yesterday okay can you
[1:57:42] say Amen
[1:57:43] so this message the
[1:57:47] Diamond the message
[1:57:51] into the Promised lands and never stop
[1:57:54] on your spiritual journey until you
[1:57:56] arrive there the new birth is the
[1:57:58] beginning of that whole thing but not
[1:58:00] the ends
[1:58:01] from now on you are now eating and
[1:58:03] you'll be coming and can you say Amen
[1:58:05] make the next one amen I'm skipping
[1:58:08] through next one

[1:58:11] long okay I mean give me give me just a
[1:58:14] couple of minutes then I'm finishing up

[1:58:24] that brother Brandon preaches is in a
[1:58:26] synagogue
[1:58:27] I'm a temple Emmanuel
[1:58:29] and he gives that message back to the
[1:58:32] Jews
[1:58:34] Hallelujah somebody said brother Marcus
[1:58:36] we have a little bit problem of Israel
[1:58:38] and Israel I tell you one thing if
[1:58:40] Christ is the king of the Jews then the
[1:58:43] bride is the queen of the Jews
[1:58:47] you cannot be Lutheran about that
[1:58:50] if Christ is the king of the Jews the
[1:58:52] bride is the queen of the Jews it's your
[1:58:55] country amen blessed be the name of the
[1:58:58] Lord keep the message honorable leave
[1:59:00] the right kind of life don't let those
[1:59:02] not come upon it we're living too late
[1:59:05] now we're too late in the hour let's
[1:59:06] leave it clean all my life your life all
[1:59:09] of our life needs to be picked up before
[1:59:10] God our young people just ride around
[1:59:13] from place to place from show to show
[1:59:15] drifting further further away from God
[1:59:17] right now that's the truth I see that in
[1:59:20] my children I see myself getting to a
[1:59:22] place you got to assemble yourself
[1:59:25] to worship God the Bible said so when
[1:59:28] you see this day approaching that much
[1:59:30] more come together if there is only two
[1:59:33] people here you'll be one of them if we
[1:59:36] come together and worship together then
[1:59:37] just something about say Jesus said
[1:59:39] where two or three are together in my
[1:59:42] name they are there I am in their midst
[1:59:45] look
[1:59:47] here is the parallel to Joshua
[1:59:51] Joshua says
[1:59:54] goodbye
[1:59:55] my time on Earth is up I did my best
[1:59:57] goodbye we see us at another another
[2:00:00] dimension but the brand makes the same

[2:00:47] and say Amen
[2:00:50] I know that I'm
[2:00:52] hurting our feelings
[2:00:56] but I'm I'm a visiting Minister that's a
[2:00:59] great thing
[2:01:00] it will never help you to become fan of
[2:01:03] some U.S preacher it never helped never
[2:01:06] and it will never do in the future you
[2:01:08] must find your position with Christ
[2:01:11] I mean you must pray that until God
[2:01:14] speaks to you our German preacher but
[2:01:17] look at this we finish by this
[2:01:22] who is older than 50.
[2:01:25] like me oh quite some time brother
[2:01:27] Adrian 2 I thought it's 45 I mean
[2:01:31] do do we hey we older ones do we realize
[2:01:34] that we soon have to go
[2:01:36] soon we go it's not much time anymore
[2:01:39] amen amen 10 years 15 years nothing it's
[2:01:42] like this last time I was here five
[2:01:44] years or something like this like this
[2:01:45] time is just running
[2:01:47] and I think as a minister I think as a
[2:01:49] father I said what kind of inheritance
[2:01:51] do I give to my children
[2:01:53] because I have only one chance on Earth
[2:01:55] for only one chance
[2:01:57] amen we want to inherit you our children
[2:02:00] uh a car a house I sent them to
[2:02:03] University every Muslim can do that
[2:02:06] that's that's just social that's fine
[2:02:08] every Muslim can send them to University
[2:02:11] but we have something to give
[2:02:14] we have something to give
[2:02:16] um we have a message not in form but we
[2:02:19] can say son
[2:02:21] you can do whatever you want but I mean
[2:02:23] if you want to do something good in your
[2:02:25] life you serve the same God because he
[2:02:27] made me so happy
[2:02:28] and it's such an honor such a privilege
[2:02:30] to serve the Lord
[2:02:32] what do we give to the Next Generation
[2:02:34] just a quote book
[2:02:36] just a picture of brother Branham
[2:02:39] just a okay a handwritten Bible or
[2:02:41] whatever no we must give them a vision
[2:02:44] for their life as for me and my house we
[2:02:48] serve the Lord
[2:02:49] by by by Joy
[2:02:53] the Bible says the people serve the Lord
[2:02:55] all the days of Joshua and all the days
[2:02:57] of the elders
[2:02:59] that outlived Joshua who had seen all
[2:03:02] the great works of the Lord that he did
[2:03:04] for Israel
[2:03:05] and Joshua the son of nun the servant of
[2:03:08] the Lord died being a hundred and ten
[2:03:10] years old and they buried him on the
[2:03:12] border of the inheritance of Team not
[2:03:14] heiress and the Mount of Ephraim on the
[2:03:17] north side of hilgash
[2:03:19] and also all the generation were
[2:03:22] gathered unto their fathers in their
[2:03:24] arose another generation after them
[2:03:27] which knew not the Lord nor yet The
[2:03:31] Works which he done for Israel
[2:03:35] I want to ask you a question and you put
[2:03:37] on your spiritual jacket
[2:03:39] that generation
[2:03:42] that rose up again they were born in the
[2:03:46] promised land
[2:03:47] they were never in Egypt they were never
[2:03:49] in the wilderness they were born in the
[2:03:51] Promised Land
[2:03:53] and when when Joshua he was baptized or
[2:03:57] circumcised in the Young Generation what
[2:03:59] did he do I would remove the shame of
[2:04:01] Egypt from you but they were never in
[2:04:03] Egypt they were born in the wilderness
[2:04:06] but how could you remove the shame of
[2:04:08] Egypt from a Young Generation it was an
[2:04:10] older generation bringing their Egypt
[2:04:13] complexes upon them
[2:04:16] rather all things that we in our life
[2:04:18] never put under our shoes
[2:04:20] our children have the privilege to Bear
[2:04:23] them plus their own complexes
[2:04:27] I took care of
[2:04:29] peace sometime I'm already in my
[2:04:31] accounts in the third generation I can
[2:04:33] see promise that grandfather has father
[2:04:35] has you see traits in the family very
[2:04:37] very clear
[2:04:39] you have a problem you have a heart
[2:04:41] attack you have a problem for example
[2:04:43] with a stroke the first thing that that
[2:04:44] the doctor asked you do you have that in
[2:04:47] your family
[2:04:48] because he knows one thing sicknesses I
[2:04:51] have have a family tradition
[2:04:54] the natural types the spiritual
[2:04:57] stop boring this you can see it from one
[2:04:58] generation the next one but brother we
[2:05:01] have enough Holy Spirit to to to stop to
[2:05:05] to stop that Circle
[2:05:07] to break that Circle we have now enough
[2:05:10] material spiritual material not to stay
[2:05:14] the same but you say I'm inherited that
[2:05:17] way I come from Egypt and I have my
[2:05:18] marks and I have this but I will not
[2:05:20] bring this to the Next Generation
[2:05:22] can you say Amen help us help me help me
[2:05:25] help you honest I mean I will come I
[2:05:28] don't go to church because do you know
[2:05:30] that you take your children into a
[2:05:31] disaster
[2:05:33] amen so what happens is this
[2:05:36] the the new generation they were raised
[2:05:39] up in the promised land let me say like
[2:05:42] this they were raised in the message for
[2:05:43] their day they were never under false
[2:05:46] worship they knew the doctrine
[2:05:52] they knew the Torah because it was the
[2:05:54] the oral Torah that they had at that
[2:05:56] time the Torah was finished when Moses
[2:05:58] died they had Sunday schools they had
[2:06:01] Services they had synagogues weren't
[2:06:03] invented at that time but they came
[2:06:05] together they had all kinds of material
[2:06:09] but they didn't know God
[2:06:12] are you sure that our children know God
[2:06:15] you see oh they must see a miracle
[2:06:17] that's not the question you see do they
[2:06:19] know the love of God
[2:06:21] do they know the nature of God
[2:06:23] do we understand one thing
[2:06:26] that we live in a time like never ever
[2:06:28] before
[2:06:30] we tried everything to to educate our
[2:06:33] youngsters we tried Pentecostalism it
[2:06:35] never worked
[2:06:36] we tried legalism and never worked amen
[2:06:39] we tried Reformation it never worked
[2:06:42] it served its time but the Bible says in
[2:06:45] the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:06:48] Angels the mystery of God shall be
[2:06:51] revealed
[2:06:52] and brother Brandon preaches Christ is
[2:06:54] the mystery of God revealed
[2:06:56] Schofield had Mysteries
[2:06:59] but the mystery means the heart of God
[2:07:03] how he is a father how he takes care how
[2:07:07] he loves his children how he how he
[2:07:10] deals with certain situations
[2:07:13] do we have another picture of God that
[2:07:15] we ever had in 2000 years that's what
[2:07:17] the opening of the seals brought
[2:07:19] so we have sometime a generation they
[2:07:22] know
[2:07:25] the dates of their message
[2:07:28] but they never knew God
[2:07:31] I mean they have a religion
[2:07:33] so the Bible says and they forsook the
[2:07:35] Lord God of their father which brought
[2:07:37] them out of the land of Egypt and
[2:07:39] followed other gods amen
[2:07:42] so as long as Joshua there and the
[2:07:45] elders were there
[2:07:47] whole Israel was serving the lord that's
[2:07:50] what the Bible says and it was not that
[2:07:52] Joshua went and where is the television
[2:07:55] here bring the television no no
[2:07:59] it doesn't work by legalism but if you
[2:08:02] serve the Lord God will bless your whole
[2:08:04] family with it there is an anointing
[2:08:06] that goes over your whole family
[2:08:08] the Bible says all Israel were blessed
[2:08:11] because of David
[2:08:12] what about you what about me do we
[2:08:15] understand that if we serve the Lord God
[2:08:18] blesses the whole family with it
[2:08:20] there's no time of feeling always
[2:08:23] he said this and he hurt my feelings and
[2:08:25] if I'm always hurting my feelings I have
[2:08:27] to say Lord change me
[2:08:29] because I cannot continue like this
[2:08:33] amen
[2:08:34] so so we as parents we have such a
[2:08:38] possibility to transmit a vision
[2:08:41] amen
[2:08:42] not just to say come to church so that
[2:08:45] the children but that the children might
[2:08:47] say one day
[2:08:48] if I'm older I want to become like my
[2:08:50] daddy
[2:08:52] I mean that is our goal I want to become
[2:08:54] like my mother because I don't
[2:08:56] understand that Branham Doctrine but I
[2:08:58] understand they are great people the way
[2:09:00] they treated me the way they treated us
[2:09:01] I I can see my parents are completely
[2:09:04] different in any kind of unbeliever
[2:09:05] because we have the Holy Spirit in US
[2:09:08] do you understand a vision of God is a
[2:09:12] feeling for the people
[2:09:13] blessed be the name we say they have to
[2:09:15] know God we must be stricter
[2:09:18] we must have more love and by love it
[2:09:22] brings that strictness but by the Holy
[2:09:24] Spirit
[2:09:25] can you say Amen
[2:09:27] so so this scripture
[2:09:29] speaks about our time because there was
[2:09:32] never a time in Israel when a generation
[2:09:34] was born in the Promised Land
[2:09:37] um it speaks about a new generation
[2:09:38] which is called in the message they know
[2:09:41] the message they know the church they
[2:09:43] know Youth Camp they know Family Camp
[2:09:45] they know but they don't know God
[2:09:48] I mean do you see the challenge that we
[2:09:51] have to really bring them into a into
[2:09:53] the presence of God Amen can you say
[2:09:56] Amen shall we say it for the next days
[2:09:59] to say if we enter in 2023 Lord let me
[2:10:03] take my family and let us meet in the
[2:10:06] evening I mean and let us take our arms
[2:10:09] around us and say let's pray for one
[2:10:12] another
[2:10:13] I took my my family at the end of the
[2:10:15] year and I said yeah thank you so much
[2:10:17] my wife my daughter I said you're part
[2:10:18] of my Ministry the way you behave
[2:10:20] Everybody is watching you everybody's
[2:10:22] observing you amen I thank you very much
[2:10:24] God bless you I've surely see this I
[2:10:26] surely appreciate this we should say
[2:10:28] these things
[2:10:30] someday you have a Ministry I take care
[2:10:32] of people and God made me that way I'm
[2:10:35] not I'm not opening my I'm not hurting
[2:10:36] my feeding not at all but it's easier to
[2:10:38] tell us here than to tell somebody else
[2:10:40] amen because you're not my my sheep or
[2:10:42] whatever you call it brother I take care
[2:10:45] of 50 people
[2:10:46] amen call them
[2:10:49] and I will give some testimony of how
[2:10:51] they came out of alcoholism or whatever
[2:10:52] I've called him all the time I said how
[2:10:55] are you doing I'm it's amazing fine can
[2:10:57] I do something you can just can I pray
[2:10:59] for you hey you did a good job God bless
[2:11:02] you fine I'm for many many people
[2:11:04] but nobody
[2:11:07] gives a feedback to me
[2:11:08] none of those asked brother Marcus how
[2:11:11] are you doing can I do something for you
[2:11:13] do we do this with our pastor
[2:11:16] or is everything for granted that's his
[2:11:18] job it's not his job
[2:11:20] we are all human beings and and somebody
[2:11:22] could say Hey brother Marcus that's a
[2:11:24] good job that you do thank you very much
[2:11:26] I appreciate this
[2:11:27] brother we take we lost in this message
[2:11:31] we lost a lot of goods attitudes
[2:11:35] amen we have a good Doctrine we're the
[2:11:37] best of the world
[2:11:39] but something is sometimes missing that
[2:11:41] that that intimacy that dear respect to
[2:11:45] one another that hey Pastor I mean the
[2:11:47] year is at the end but I want to tell
[2:11:49] you one thing I surely appreciate what
[2:11:50] you did for me amen whenever I had a
[2:11:52] problem I could call you I never forget
[2:11:54] this and if I could help you I will do
[2:11:56] these things
[2:11:57] rather God will bless us more than we
[2:12:00] think blessing is not a question of
[2:12:02] Doctrine blessing is a question of
[2:12:04] attitude
[2:12:06] and by this God starts to bless your
[2:12:10] whole family
[2:12:11] quote brother Branham if you take care
[2:12:14] of other people's problems God takes
[2:12:16] care of your problems
[2:12:19] I prefer that God takes care of my
[2:12:21] problems than I take care of do you
[2:12:24] understand this
[2:12:25] we have a lot of young people of Finnish
[2:12:27] bodies
[2:12:28] if you say can you say amen I share
[2:12:31] these things with you because I cannot
[2:12:33] share it at home and pastors that I
[2:12:35] cannot share it here because they say
[2:12:36] okay now he wants that somebody nobody
[2:12:38] wants us to clap on the shoulder no but
[2:12:40] something genuine a look in the eyes hey
[2:12:43] can I do something for you can I do
[2:12:45] something life easier for you you were
[2:12:47] always there for me but I want to tell
[2:12:48] you one thing we really pray for you
[2:12:50] that is like oil in the engine of a
[2:12:53] person when everybody needs it from time
[2:12:55] to time that little feeling of hey
[2:12:59] somebody cares for me can you say Amen
[2:13:01] you can't say Amen
[2:13:04] amen your own daughter my own daughter
[2:13:06] came to me he said Daddy hey if you need
[2:13:08] me I I will always be I was happy to
[2:13:11] serve you that means so much for me
[2:13:14] was was that kind of a little compliment
[2:13:17] but brother you run 100 miles more
[2:13:19] with one little word we're running we're
[2:13:22] doing amen with joy amen and then you go
[2:13:25] to your own children I said hey the way
[2:13:28] you dress the way you come to church
[2:13:30] like I don't know if you're born again I
[2:13:31] don't know if you're baptized but I
[2:13:33] surely appreciate that you're trying to
[2:13:34] serve the Lord that way it's do we say
[2:13:36] to our youngsters
[2:13:38] do you understand that every woman needs
[2:13:40] compliments
[2:13:44] not that son
[2:13:47] amen but every woman likes to have some
[2:13:49] compliments and you're looking good but
[2:13:52] who will give you a compliment no
[2:13:54] boyfriend no nothing I mean you're not
[2:13:56] not married no
[2:13:58] one day your husband will give you some
[2:14:00] compliments but until your husband gives
[2:14:02] you the company who gives you the
[2:14:04] company your own Daddy
[2:14:05] said honey hey I want to tell you one
[2:14:07] thing you're looking good I'm very proud
[2:14:09] of you we have to say these things
[2:14:11] you say this is just social it's just
[2:14:13] psychology it's not like that is what
[2:14:15] God does with us
[2:14:16] and we come to church and he's just
[2:14:18] speaking some things to us and we go
[2:14:20] back home he said what a father we have
[2:14:22] amen as for me in my house we want to
[2:14:24] serve the Lord
[2:14:26] okay so amen finish by death reaping
[2:14:29] priests I tell you one thing every young
[2:14:31] person that leaves the church I keep in
[2:14:33] contact with them it's quite a number
[2:14:36] I got examples of people in drugs in
[2:14:39] alcohol I keep always contact with them
[2:14:41] by WhatsApp it's a truth I tell you one
[2:14:45] thing I'm writing how are you doing
[2:14:49] in person brother Marcus I wasn't in
[2:14:51] church on Sunday I said look I'm an
[2:14:53] older brother I understand I'm over 50.
[2:14:55] but I'm not too old to understand who's
[2:14:57] in church or not okay
[2:15:00] I said that wasn't my question but the
[2:15:03] young people think if a pastor asks how
[2:15:05] you're doing the only questions where
[2:15:06] were you in school in the church you see
[2:15:09] that complex that we have already that
[2:15:10] that traumatism that we have already in
[2:15:13] that message that we lost some time a
[2:15:15] normal feeling to one another
[2:15:18] everything is you have to function in
[2:15:20] the church
[2:15:21] if you're not functioning anymore you're
[2:15:22] forgotten it's not our gospel
[2:15:25] amen so I write hey uh I want to ask her
[2:15:29] how are you doing brother Marcus I'm
[2:15:30] coming back next Sunday I said that
[2:15:32] wasn't my question
[2:15:33] because you're lying anyhow you're not
[2:15:35] there because if you want to come you
[2:15:36] come you don't say that you come
[2:15:39] I said I want to say you how are you
[2:15:41] doing how do you feel can I do something
[2:15:43] for you
[2:15:45] because I don't come to church look we
[2:15:47] have brothers and sisters we are friends
[2:15:49] we are dedicated here you are not losing
[2:15:51] our friendship in our Brotherhood
[2:15:53] because you don't come to church anymore
[2:15:54] because we are Eternal beings I don't
[2:15:57] agree with your life son you know this
[2:15:59] but I agree with your heart
[2:16:01] rather than by that thing these people
[2:16:03] come back sooner or later they try to
[2:16:05] find something where they're like a dove
[2:16:06] they try to find something but sooner or
[2:16:08] later they found there's nothing in the
[2:16:09] world
[2:16:10] and if you keep that door open they come
[2:16:12] back and say hey here we are
[2:16:14] brother I see them one by one coming
[2:16:16] back I say praise the Lords and say Amen
[2:16:20] that is how God deals with us
[2:16:23] amen amen
[2:16:26] and you say Amen the same thing that I
[2:16:28] was preaching that gospel that we preach
[2:16:31] is so different than the rest
[2:16:33] it's God bringing us home it's it's here
[2:16:36] comes Abraham to Sarah really finishing
[2:16:38] give me two minutes I mean here's
[2:16:41] Abraham coming to Sarah same principle
[2:16:43] that we saw over there
[2:16:45] and Sarah was in the tent behind him
[2:16:48] 10th Vision again
[2:16:51] always always the same picture and
[2:16:54] Abraham says
[2:16:56] where is Sarah the Bible says they asked
[2:16:58] where is Sarah your wife because Abraham
[2:17:00] knew one thing here comes the one who
[2:17:03] told me 25 years ago that you have so
[2:17:05] much children and be father of a Nation
[2:17:07] give me a second
[2:17:09] and whatever he was so embarrassed
[2:17:11] he says I hope he will not ask where are
[2:17:14] my children because there is none so
[2:17:16] foreign
[2:17:20] goddess in humor and the angels said hey
[2:17:24] I mean isn't he the father of many
[2:17:26] nations
[2:17:27] one said to the other yeah yeah he must
[2:17:29] have oh Abraham it's tremendous your
[2:17:31] children must be so quiet we don't hear
[2:17:33] them they must be all in Sunday it's
[2:17:34] good tremendous man and Abraham
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:38] well I mean
[2:17:40] it's difficult to explain right now but
[2:17:44] and then God says I'm in Wisteria wife
[2:17:47] according to the time of life you will
[2:17:50] have a child
[2:17:51] same picture that I was preaching before
[2:17:53] Sarah was laughing in her heart what did
[2:17:56] Sarah do she thought about herself he
[2:17:59] said I will not make it amen and God
[2:18:02] does not discuss with Sarah God speaks
[2:18:06] about himself
[2:18:07] he said is there anything too hard for
[2:18:10] the Lord
[2:18:11] you see the picture Sarah says I'm too
[2:18:14] old I cannot make the Rapture I will
[2:18:16] never do it with my complexes in the
[2:18:18] church and I have a pastor with this
[2:18:19] past I will never make the Rapture God
[2:18:21] says is there anything too hard for the
[2:18:23] Lord
[2:18:24] God is not there and discussing with her
[2:18:27] he speaks about himself
[2:18:29] you understand get your mighty man of
[2:18:33] God oh yeah I mean I'm in a church where
[2:18:35] there's no Miracles and it's always

[2:20:45] as I said I have no notes just maybe one
[2:20:48] one sentence was just for you then you
[2:20:50] take that sentence from the presence of
[2:20:52] God because of just opening my heart
[2:20:56] I mean no one thing when when when when
[2:20:58] how it's so important to give a vision
[2:21:01] to our children the vision of God's love
[2:21:04] they will not understand the seven sea
[2:21:06] but they understand us
[2:21:07] amen but you understand when when when
[2:21:12] Peter came into I think was Peter came
[2:21:16] into the presence of Jesus
[2:21:19] and Jesus said
[2:21:22] Simon
[2:21:24] son of Jonah so Jesus knew who he was
[2:21:28] and he was to know who his father was
[2:21:31] and brother Branham explained why it was
[2:21:34] the important son of Jonah
[2:21:38] he says because the father was sitting
[2:21:41] with his boys in the ship and they were
[2:21:44] talking about spiritual things about a
[2:21:46] vision they were not talking about
[2:21:48] Mercedes-Benz they talk about spiritual
[2:21:50] vision you know when brother Brahm says
[2:21:52] this and the father stood up he said
[2:21:54] boys I'm too old and soon have to go and
[2:21:57] the Messiah is coming soon but be sure
[2:21:59] the Messiah will be a prophet that's
[2:22:01] what brother Ram says over and over
[2:22:03] and Peter remembered what his own father
[2:22:06] told you I want to ask you a question do

[2:22:11] rapture

[2:22:31] proud of that amen who told Peter his
[2:22:35] own father
