others but we uh trust we come with Open Hearts this morning to receive What the Lord Has for us really excited exced to be here this morning and I trust that you are excited you're excited too and just really blessed by what the Lord has done for us so far over the weekend um the Lord is so gracious just a real privilege to to serve him um so I would like to say welcome to all the visitors this morning we have um we have a full church so I trust that you uh you're not that it's not too stuffy and not too hot around you but trust that it's what's that okay okay um so trust that that the Lord will make each one feel feel really welcome and and that we can get all our defensive mechanisms out of the way so that the Lord can speak to your hearts this morning um we we want to receive absolutely everything we can from the Lord this morning um very special thank you to the uh to everyone that helped with with yesterday all the hard work that went in I know that there's sleep sacrificed time sacrificed um a lot of lot of effort went in um even weeks and months before the banquet um so we thank you for that and also say thank you for the attendees at the banquet for this year you actually registered on time that's amazing that's a miracle in itself usually last minute there's all sorts of strugglers trying to get in but this time it was pretty good so I'm really excited about that um just a quick announcement before I forget um for the local um people no service on Wednesday night so please make a big mental note no service this coming Wednesday night um so God willing um I'm taking brother Steve and sister Esther up to uh to minister at rfbf so we'll see you guys soon I'm looking forward to some fellowship there but um yeah it's it's just a awesome meeting so far I I just um I I want to say this that Friday night was Supernatural in in an amazing way um and and I want to say this for the sake of the visitors because obviously you would have necessarily appreciate it from from our perspective but um there's a there's a few things that that happened and I'm just going to you know share that very openly and honestly but um over the last few weeks I've been ministering along um certain lines and and the Lord has just opened up beautiful things wonderful things um and um so usually I I've got a habit that you know when I preach a series I preach it on Wednesday nights and then I go Wednesday night to Wednesday night and if I preach a series on Sundays I preach it Sunday to Sunday to Sunday I never never cross you know between Sundays and Wednesdays and for this particular series that I'm preaching at the moment I really just felt on my heart pressed for the first time ever that I've done that as far as I can remember to go Sunday Wednesday Sunday Wednesday on the same on the same um thought and um so that's the one thing that happened and then Monday night at the brother's prayer meeting again for the first time that I can remember that I ever did that I asked the prayer and I I I had a prayer request and I asked the Lord and I said Lord please keep us on the right Revelation because it would be so easy for for us just human humanly to go you know down rabbit holes and going directions that's that's off the word and and we prayed about that um you know prayed for our local Ministry and and you know all the all the ministering brothers and so that the Lord keep us on the right track and then the Lord came Friday night and and used brother Steve and and we were buzzing from the first moment because the quotes the scripture references the Practical applications we we heard most of it in the last few weeks because the Lord had just just really been dealing with with those things and and it was as if the Lord that's why I went much Sunday Wednesday Sunday Wednesday I didn't know it but it's as if the Lord wanted those that Foundation there so that we could could really get everything that that the Lord has had for us on wedes on Friday night so we were right there from the first moment and um I'm sure brother Steve saw very very big smiles on everyone's faces because we we were right in the in the channel I guess we can say so so um really looking forward to a continuation continuation of that this morning and I and I and I want to say you know if you sit here with you know any form of complex or or fear or defensive wall up for whatever reason you can ask the Lord now to take it out of the way get your portion out of the service amen we come here we're not looking to a man although we appreciate the man appreciate brother Steve a really precious friend and and we just count him and sister Esther as as dear friends I want to also say this again and I forgive me if I've said this already in public but they are probably one of the easiest ministering couples that we've ever had in our in our home you know they they just um there's no there's no kind of Pride and have to be served because we are Ministry or we are special or anything like that they just I cannot keep sister es out of the kitchen or away from the dishwasher or anything like that she's just right into it so you know and that's that's not the case always you know sometimes you have a bit of a a kind of chip on the shoulder where people think they need to be served and and and I mean rightfully so you were happy to serve but you know it's lovely to see the the servant heart so God bless you you and thank you for bringing her to share with us a little bit brother Steve um I don't want to take too much time I just want to um share few prayer requests um I've got a serious prayer request from s Julie Oliver for her friend she says a friend of mine from Elan um I think her name is Colleen that's right her a friend of mine from Alam was diagnosed with lung cancer today um we've had a chat her faith is High um and she's really mad at the Devil and she's ready to accept their healing so can we play for her pray for her and then also um some request from Sister Gail for Carol Horan um she's she's was diagnosed with like stage stomach cancer also for Brian mckin recently diagnosed with only one kidney and then unspoken request for someone for a damaged Achilles tendon and hip injury and right leg pain so we want to take those things to the Lord this morning let's stand together and we we dedicate this meeting again to the Lord and we and we take our needs before the Lord the most wonderful father Lord we come to you Lord Lord not with any credentials Lord father but like we heard on Friday night we are year not by our choice but by your choice you chose us father Lord and we can just rest in that predestination father Lord rejoice in the work that you are doing in our lives Rejoice father in the things you allow to come across our path because you're a good father Yes Lord oh Lord and you are in the process of preparing us for an eternity with you oh God we just want everything you have for us Lord father but I also pray that you will give us Grace not to put everything in future Lord but to live today according to what you have for us for today Father Lord in this morning I pray that you will in a very special way come and speak to your children again father each one of us Lord we need you Lord I've we've prayed so much already father but again I lift brother Steve before you I pray Lord that you will use that vessel Lord give him an injection of your strength Lord I pray that you will just Lord let him be able to follow exactly where your Holy Spirit leads him to go father oh Lord we also want to bring our needs before you this morning oh Lord many needs Among Us Lord still some who are sick different circumstances Lord we want to bring each one of those things to you father I pray pray that you will answer every need Lord in your very special way Lord father we also want to bring the spoken request before you we pray for that friend

before well as I call your brother up I'm [Music] forgiven I'm forgiven because you were forsaken I'm accepted you were ConEd I'm alive and well your spirit is within me because you died and rose again amazing love how can it be [Music] in all I do I honor you I'm forgiven I'm forgiven you were forsaken I'm accepted you are condemned I'm alive and well your spirit is within me because you died and rose again Hallelujah amazing love how can it be that you my king would die for me amazing love I know it's true it's my choice to honor you in all I do I honor you in all I do I honor you is that our prayer this morning in everything we do we want to honor honor the Lord amen what an amazing love want to thanks brother H for Testimony that he shared this morning he quite quite surprising and the other side it's not surprising because our Lord is the master of coordination and so came from other side of the world I didn't know what he was preaching on I had no clue it makes it difficult on one end but at the other end you Just Surrender yourself and say Lord I have no clue so I just come and I and and also coming here I wanted to start with what I'm preaching this morning that was supposed to be Friday night and as I was looking at my notes I just fell in my heart I need to do another step back and start like earlier like from a different standpoint before we reach this this morning so the Lord was in it and for that we are thankful because it it shows us that we are at the right place at the right time in God's time amen hallelujah so I want to thanks everyone for coming in such a great number I want to thank R for this justess his friendship and his his welcoming and his nice words is he's so nice you are so nice amen and so me and my wife are talking about moving in New Zealand we like it so much [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] I understand brother Chris the Canadian that moved to New Zealand we enjoy we enjoy the fellowship we enjoy the nice spirit the the welcoming the fellowship uh and so it's really a it's really a Trill to be uh to be with you and to share the word together also amen so we will turn in our Bible this morning in the book of St Matthew's chapter 13 so I want to talk this this morning as a question are you perfect are you perfect and we're still in the same a theme about spiritual growth and the reason why we've touched what we preached on Friday night it's because I feel that whenever we question our status we hinder the growth because we always fell back to the beginning so this is our title this morning morning are you perfect and for that we're going to read in St Matthew chapter uh 13 verse 36 to 40 it's quarter to 11 just let everyone know we got to know when when I started it's all good for me if you're good I'm good amen let's read verse 36 then when Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciple came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man the field is a whirl the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angel and therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world how many believes were in the end time it's the end friends that's why this topic this morning is really important let's turn also in St Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 that's the scripture ASM makes a lot of people nervous it made me nervous for many years until I understood what it meant Matthew 5 verse 48 be ye therefore perfect even as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect that's by our head Lord Jesus we want to thank you this morning we're in your presence we have your word may you come down in our midst to open the word open on our heart and understanding we so we may be able to receive from you Lord we want to take every Spirit under your control this morning our mind myself Everything For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated so I want to say a word also for all the volunteers I I am pressed how many people are involved with any like the banquet yesterday all the effort and and all the the the time the investment and so may the Lord bless you you know it takes it takes a whole church together like that and maybe as a pastor I see that and I'm I'm I'm impressed by the the level of involvement and how you take that really seriously it's it's impressive I got an outside view so I'm telling you it's impressive you take the things that heart you do it good and all that in a good atmosphere and with a smile it's important because sometime you can be involved but there's so much pressure and it's it's it's not fun you're involved it it's not fun but I see that you have good time together I see that you joke with each other there's smile there's there's a good good spirit so may the Lord bless you for that and keep keep that keep that amen all right so we want to talk uh this morning about the importance of spiritual growth and maturity tonight we will close the topic of and our title tonight is going to be the cost of spiritual growth so basically Friday night and tomorrow are mostly focus on what's hindering growth because actually to have growth there's not much you have to do you just to let it go like if you do a garden like you have to put the seed in the ground put the right condition if it's outside you cannot control it but if it's in a what do you call it a hot house I don't know how you call that you know a place where it's control environment you put the right atmosphere the White Water the right water the right moisture and all that but you know what's what's an inground you have to let it grow you have to let it grow but if there's a rock sitting on the seed you have to remove it you have to remove what's hindering the growth so this is why if we want to talk about spiritual growth you won't grow if I put pressure on you you have to grow you have to grow folks the Rapture is coming you have to grow he's like yeah I want to grow what can I do nothing right so that's confusing for us so Friday night and this morning is about removing what's hindering and first of all what's hindering the growth is when we question the seed all the time or if we don't know there's a seed now it's been covered Friday and so we want to uh linger too much on that but the prophet says that's a whole lot the matter with the Brenham Tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world has bound the people until he cannot produce spiritual growth now we just read the parable in Matthew uh chapter 13 and sometime people are confused because there's two Parable there about a swer and about seeds and and sometime people they try to make those two Parable fits but they don't fit because they don't talk about the same thing in the first Parable deceit is the word of God in the second Parable deceit is sons of God right and so in the first uh uh uh the Earth is is is your heart and the word Falls in into your heart and and then it can fall on the wrong ground and the right ground and all that so those two parable are totally two separate subjects but the second one that we read and we just read the part where Jesus uh H explained the the meaning of it we understand that the good seed are the children of of the Kingdom so this been solved you know we we spoke on that about uh on the topic Friday night there is seeds of God that's been sold and they have to to ra to be to rais to to mature and to be ready for the Harvest at the end time so it's a simple Topic in and and when when you know as a picture you know the good sorrow of Jesus Christ he was there with his bag of seeds and he was walking around the earth and and throwing seeds and the question is that seed was already a Son of God when he was in his bag that's before you were sent on Earth you were already a Son of God so that's not in question and we we kind of solved that on Friday night we don't want to question that because if we question that we hinder spiritual growth we're not able to reach the next step because tonight we're going to realize that when God is when we grow it comes with a price because as we mature God will entrust us with greater things but if we remain a kid always wondering if we're a sons of God there's not much we can do because we're always focused on our status and not we're not going anywhere and we're not prod producing any fruits so I'm skipping a little bit of that I I had placed that and but you know we want to follow the leading of the Lord and so this is just as a foundation this is what we read on Friday night you know all the F the father giveth to me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out and so we we look that you know the God wants to remove the scare in our life and exactly this this a key quote for me here the prophet is is saying in the God who is rich in Mercy he says I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to strand it out that we might get away from fear and scare if you want to know why I'm preaching that Friday night to remove this the fear and scare you don't know who you are and because of that it's hindering spiritual growth you're not you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God you always the sons of God see for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there amen we also look that that that group The elected the the one that the father gave that group of people his name has been placed on that record before the foundation of the world and cannot under any circumstances have those name removed and so sometime people ask and say well how will I know how will I know and that's a good question and I I forgot to read that that verse on Friday night I'm reading it this morning warning but the Bible says that the spirit itself beareth witness to our spirit that we are the children of God so it's not when the pastor shakes your hand or they gave you a fellowship card which we're not really you know big on that membership and all that you know that's not it who's going to tell you you're in it it's not the church it's not the group you belong to which we care about that it's important church we choose pastor and all that but that's not in question because it's the spirit itself well Pastor please tell me am I in am I in good enough he can't answer to you he's not supposed to tell you the answer CU he doesn't know he's going to teach you he's going to preach the word but we that's why we want to create an atmosphere we want this Holy Spirit to come down and to Bear witness to your spirit you are my children [Music] and because ye are Sons God has sent forth his Spirit of his son into your heart so it's not because you're good it's not because you're better it's not because you behave better it's not because you're in the right church it's because the only reason you receive the holy spirit it's because you're a son you have a seed within yourself and from that seed the quickening power comes down and quickens that seed and that is the revelation of the baptism of the the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the open book it's the quickening of the seed it's not speaking in tongue it's not jumping around it's not going in a prayer line even though the Holy Spirit would might do may make you do all those things cuz that's all part of the Holy Ghost but you will receive the Holy Ghost because there's a seed inside of you and when the light strikes the seed something happen in your life you'll never be the same it changes your life Hallelujah okay so let's start if we are sons of God we don't question that anymore then we have to be perfect now if I'm a Son of God what am I supposed to do now I better you know I better be good and you know because I'm a Son of God now he's expecting a lot of me because he has a lot of Hope on his sons we don't want to disappoint him there's this is a big challenge right and so then we read that scripture it's like I am a Son of God this is a high calling and when we think High Calling we're thinking performance right and so that comes from the a problem that we have is that how we look at the word perfect and we need the true Revelation and the true meaning of the word perfect because for us in our modern culture especially country that are Performance Based everything is on Merit High grades high this they hired the best it's always about being the best and to perform and doing as much you know as less mistakes as possible so for us perfect that's what it means no fault you know they do finger skating they do whatever you know they want and there's judge sitting and and they're watching every move they're watching like okay okay all right oh that's good that's good a triple woo wow okay right right oh made a mistake you had 10 now you're nine right and so when we see the scripture right away are you with me our mind Falls there and the problem is that we look at that word with modern dictionary because in modern dictionary it leans way more in a a sense or of of a no fault no mistake I'm perfect there's no mistake so the problem is that when we do a mistake we're not perfect so it means we don't please God and we fail and since we know that the sons of God are going to be perfect if I'm not perfect then I'm not a son of God and then I'm fall back into the same problem right am I the only one who went through that cycle okay so we can have a Fellowship on that topic this morning so we got to know uh uh what's the meaning of the word perfect you got it several place when you have the word perfect in the Bible we're going to do a study this morning maybe as a foundation even when the Rich Young Rong young ruler came he says Jesus said unto him because well he says I done all those things I follow the Commandments I did this I did everything I I I I perform real well and Jesus says well you got to sell everything you have like you know so if you want to be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me now when we hear that we're like man he did everything right and it's not enough like Jesus is asking for more and it's exactly what how I feel every time I'm I feel like I'm doing good I hear a sermon about something okay all right I don't know I'm a failure again yeah but what we're missing here is that to be perfect was not the behavior of okay to be perfect you got to go and sell your stuff it was not about selling stuff it was about to follow Jesus because as he was respecting all the rules and all the laws he was a kid because uh if you if you remember the gender confusion we preach about the Father the voice of the father the mother and the Bible says that law has not bring nothing to Perfection because the law is the mother that tells you everything you should do but the voice of the father brings you away from the law into maturity and it's exactly what Jesus is calling him to a higher calling you're under mommy following the rules and all the laws and that's all good but this is what we're going to talk about tonight the call for maturity and the call for maturity we're going to look at that tonight is name follow me don't follow the law the rules of the church follow me the father and if you're in me you're going to be perfect if you listen to my voice you're going to be perfect but if you follow the Commandments The Ten Commandments and all the law and the rules you'll never be perfect so what the word perfect means the word perfect comes from the Greek word which means a man of full age it's a man who was brought to its end it's he finish one thing nothing necessary to completeness full grown adult mature did you see no fault here never do a mistake the Bible word perfect doesn't mean no fault and it's really hard for us it's really hard we hear perfect we fall I'm not perfect you know what in this sin body you will never be perfect but that's why we have you have to have the Revelation under the word what the word justified mean Justified mean is as youve never done it because the prophet's teaching us that the sin question has been solved that the qu the sin in the flesh Paul's teaching about it brother br's teaching about it that sin question is solved the sin in the On In the Flesh has been cursed it is solved it's a done deal so we'll prove that Ephesians 4 he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teacher for the perfecting of the Saints so we understand for the Saints to become perfect man and and also it can be a problem if a if a if a minister is like okay my role is to make the people perfect I'm going to be a good preacher and I'm going to make the people perform and they're going to be perfect because this is my role so it's really important for the ministry to understand what the word perfect means because if they don't know they going to put that pressure that's on them says God has sent me to bring those people to be perfect and if a pastor believ that they have all kinds of rulle and all kind of measurement the measure of the skirt the measure of the the the sleeve the LA the hair everything has to be measured because people has to be perfect and we think perfect is linked to behavior which is not it has nothing to do with behavior and as I'm saying that you're like yeah yeah but in your mind is like how how's that possible because we are so caught up in our behavior and it's worse even if we were raised in an environment where the message you know how many people love the prophet only because he was strick true they love the harsh quotes and that's all they hear he rebuked the church because the spirit of Elijah is rough Spirit of Elijah is rough but I don't have the spirit of Elijah in a sense that I'm not a prophet I'm a pastor we work under that eagle anointing but it it doesn't mean that a spirit of Elijah God sent a prophet is Harsh that I have to be harsh and it's surprising how many people they love they love the ministry of the Prophet for the Cod side of thing conduct order IND Doctrine should we wear pajamas should should should we do this oh I Cod man that's such a revive for me that's such Goods food and and and what I hear is like they're looking for more rules because there's all kind of questions they're looking for the answers because they want a church to be perfect and you can run years and years and years on that atmosphere being in the message but missing the true purpose of that message right well I love this man he was harsh he was up against the denomination and and there's rebellious people they like the prophet because it looks like this guy was against the system I'm against the system too like you're not in the right Spirit you're feeding off this with the wrong spirit and that's why you know it's been years I've been in the message I can we can talk we've seen many ISM many Tendencies why because people grab this drop the message and make something out of their own agenda when Jesus called when when when Moses called people out out of Egypt the Bible says a mixed multitude came there's all kind of people there for all kinds of reasons that's why the test came the desert came the lack of food the lack of this the lack of that to test God says I want to test what's inside of you you want to Stone Moses after a while so for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ so again the word perfect here and the word perfecting has the qu kind of a same meaning as a men of a full age it broughts to his end finished a finished product you know if you finish a product you're building something and and it's finished it's mature it's perfect in a sense that you have finished and perfecting in the same is the same thing is until they are completely Furnishing equipped God wants to equi us Lord but then we go on and we listen to this message the stature of a perfect man and every time we think we are Christian we listen to that tape and we finish and I'm not sure we are encouraged right we are discouraged why because we look at all the virtues that's supposed to be there right and I translated all my note because these are a French note so I put the pyramid but I put it in French so I forgot to translate that this when I was in the office oh no I forgot this so you're going to get the French version you know Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience what's the other one uh this one godliness right I know in French [Laughter] let's go back to English so for me I'm going to open my heart I was a boy sitting in church all my life I saw that as a ladder a ladder I had to climb right and you climb like you have faith and The Virtue and then you climb knowledge oh my knowledge that's great and then Temperance and then and then you you you lost your you lost your temper huh you lose your temper you lose patience and and then something happened like you you lose your temper how many you I've played the game you ladder and snake right that old snake you trip on him and down you go and now you're not a Christian anymore you have to restart why am I saying that because end their spiritual growth because of a lack of Revelation right then you feel much much a better Christian you you didn't lose your temper and then something happened and and and you lose patience you're like and then I lost it I lost it I'm not a Christian because I supposed to have that to be a Christian so I have to climb all the way up and find if I get up there if I'm good in all those virtue God will reward me with his holy ghost that's been a love you it's I've I've been raised in that thinking and so people if they feel good and they have brotherly love and all that they feel they can keep those virtue all together and I kind of I'm climbing climbing Lord and if I can climb and have those all those virtue God will reward me and I will receive the Holy Ghost but when you have a failure and you you didn't have enough patience so you didn't have brotherly love in that inst stances and you got to repent he says no I if I don't have that I can have I cannot have the higher Echelon because we see that as a performance base these are Echelon and that's a problem finally you had adopt all those things and you have brotherly love and then I don't know there's a split that happened in your church and you're angry at people and then you don't love them anymore and then God rebukes you because you don't have brotherly love because you cannot love beyond the boundaries of your own church or love beyond the boundaries of people who doesn't believe like you because let me just show you one thing no I have to skip that sorry so the problem is is that what you have to understand is that all the virtue of God it's not something that God's going to download inside of you at one point you have to understand that every all of this is already in De seed it's we looked at Friday when the prophet says you had eternal life all along you don't receive eternal life when you're a good boy when you repent you had eternal life inside of you you have all those virtue inside of you it might not be expressed it might not be mature but it's laying there sir it's not like you have to add like I got to go shopping and I got to add in my cart brotherly love praise the lord it's on rebate there's on they're on sale Hallelujah right and I'm adding stuff in my cart cuz I want to be a good Christian and we look outwardly when it's in the seed already okay I feel I feel pressed to say what I was I wanted to skip it but I can't so you'll have to turn with me because it's not in my note Ephesians 4 okay verse three it's really important here I heard a minister talked about that couple of months ago or year a year ago or so and it for me it was and I don't have the quote that but I'm going to refer to because it's not in my note but I just feel that I had to to touch that so I got to back off here get rid of the snakes okay so the Bible says that God sent you know the ministry for the perfecting of the saint till we all come into the unity of Faith Unity of faith means we see eye to eye so to to see eye to eye is something in the future but if you fall back in verse three do have to be in your Bible cuz I don't have in a screen PA Paul is saying let's start with verse one therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all the loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbidding one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace So Unity of spirit and unity of faith is not the same thing Unity of faith is we see eye to eye Unity of spirit is like you're my brother like the prophet says I draw a bigger Circle I don't see eye to eye but I keep the unity of spirit but when in ignorance through many many many years we've tried to keep the unity of faith and we would disqualify or reject as soon as somebody we saw that we didn't see eye to eye we fell we had to push him aside cuz we were looking for the unity of Faith but the the prophet says I don't have the quote I might show it to you tonight but I know you trust me but the prophet says only when we going to see Jesus face to face that we will have the unity of Faith until the prophet says I even disagree with my own wife and that's why it's so hard sometimes for marriage to be together because we we are looking for a perfect marriage and perfect marriage equals seeing eye to eye that's possible mean my wife doesn't see eye to ey but we have to cultivate the unity of spirit and we have disqualified people but when we do good on that Journey you'll split your church over and over and over and over until you are alone and it's exactly what happened how many people are sitting at home listening to a tape cuz that's the only one they can agree with is themselves sometimes not even cuz they keep changing their mind cuz they disagree with themselves so that's a sign not that's not a that's not the sermon this morning but if if if you take verse three and verse 13 it says keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace till we all come in the unity of Faith what's in between is everything that's needed to reach that so our purpose today is to keep the unity of spirit we are heading to the unity of Faith but I don't think it's possible in those bodies because we have our backgrounds and that's why we preached last night on different we have all different conscience you know somebody is condemned about eating meat that's what sacrificed the Idol idol and the other one the other one doesn't care Paul didn't say you have all to be the same and have the same belief and have the same conscience and think the same Paul has never preached that we have to think the same amen side note over that's a bonus all right so a lot of people their Christian life looks like that and it was my life for many many many years even as a minister until I realize the meaning of the word perfect and that what that that that's why I was so hard on myself and when we're so hard on ourselves so afraid of doing a mistake because if we do a mistake we fall back to the beginning and then it questions everything and you can never grow because because all your life's Focus it's about to maintain a a a a a per a per a perfect walk it is so difficult Lord is it okay if I put my feet there because if I do a mistake I go back to the beginning means I don't have the Holy Ghost maybe I'm not a son of God and and so and then what you know what it does Fear paralyzed and we're not doing anything we're not moving it by fear and then when when other people are free and and they do something for the Lord we're like how come they can do all that and then he makes a mistake in doing something for I I know I knew look look he did something wrong I'm I'm better paralyzed I did nothing wrong but there's a sin that's called a sin of omission and doing nothing sometime it's a lack of faith because you're Paralyzed by fear fear of doing a mistake but the Bible says that just falls seven times and yeah it has that same reaction two three amen the rest are like where is he going with that yeah the word just and the word fall in the same sentence doesn't work for us and you had the word seven forget it maybe one time I can seven come on man doesn't learn anything after one after one mistake I mean you're supposed to know you mean that you you you would you would repeat the same mistake really that's that's in the Bible but you know what he does he raise back up again because he know the sin question has been solved he knows the atonement at the cross he doesn't bring his behavior on the altar he brings the lamb I wanted to use that last night as a test because we were talking about our conscience I says are you living in a small box where everything is so strict and everything and I and the test I'm using is when I quote that scripture if it blocks in your mind the just fall seven time if it blocks in your mind you got to go back and reestablish what Grace is you're still too much on behavior and I hear you like I right I'm preaching I hear you like brother Steve you're removing all kind of demand and pressure based on Behavior do you don't you know what's going to cost to the church people going to run away and they're going to do this like like like you were waiting for church permission to go in a bar and start drinking like if that's what you want to do do it don't ask for the permission go do it or ask God to change your heart God wants to change our desires amen so the proof here that the word perfect is linked to maturity well you got it right there in the scripture scripture scriptures if you are perfect you are no more a children it doesn't say if you're perfect that stands for you'll never make make any mistakes so you have it here the Bible reveals itself so if a perfect man if you're at the measure of the stature of the fullness fullness again you have it it's complete that's what perfect means you're complete that's our goal God wants to make us complete fully equipped mature so he can trust us with things so if you are a perfect man you're no more a kid tossed and fro like I was like this tossed and fro and carried about with every wi of Doctrine by the S of man and cunning craftiness where do they lie and wait to deceive that's why so many people they run from it for a new idea well the prophet says we're not allowed to do this okay I'll stop doing it the prophet says we're not allow well I'll stop doing that the prophet says well you should well I'll do this and you're you're tossed and fro from from you always in you're always in in fear that you're going to find a new quote that tell you how wrong you are and there's expert around I call them Pharisees cuz that's exactly the spirit of Pharisees they were expert to find stuff in the word and and if they was they were not there they were making it up you you've heard that people like well I found a quote really what is it oh brother are you ready well you're doing this you're not supposed to do that cuz the B Prophet said and then they read you the quote is like kind of feel you're stretching this no brother you need a revelation to see it these are wied doctrines only the bride will see this well I guess I'm not in the bride and you are you are tossed to and fro carried about every abduction because you're a kid just trying to please mama and find a new rule to make her happy but when we move to Perfection we move to the father thank you but speaking the truth in love may grow to be perfect you need to grow up onto him in all things which is the head even Christ so the problem is as as long as we see the word perfect as a no fault we are careful about all the rules and our minds is set on rules to be sure that we are perfect but in doing that we don't grow and we then remain a children and you see how counterproductive it [Music] is so there's a purpose for that the purpose for that if you take the first sentence of each phrase there's a purpose for Ephesians 4 he gave for the till we that we ends forth we are going somewhere he gave this for that till we that we do you see the moving forward there's a purpose for that that's why when we say that the rules doesn't bring nobody to maturity because the word perfect means maturity the Bible says for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God so against you have it's the same Greek word tell so the law so you want to control a church CH you want to control your family you had more rules you're condemning them to stay immature because when everything is a rule you don't take any decision well do it why do it well I'll do it but God has not created us to be robots and I'll give you an example I gave last night the prophet was you know in his ministry he was doing prayer lines he had big prayer lines but because he was seeing a vision for almost every one of them he could go with three four five and if he would stretch it he would he would almost pass out and they would have the deacons or Billy Paul will send him and so but ARL Roberts was praying for 500 people and people criticize the meaning of the Prophet because he said well brother har Roberts pray for 500 your prayer line last let just a couple of people and your closing people were disappointed so he had a lot of pressure and and and and and and you know brother Brandon was like us you know you want to please people and and and and so he says and so he said the next time the angel come I'm going to ask the angel what should I do five or 500 there must be a number for me to be in the perfect will of God so because I I I I'm supposed to do exactly what God wants me to do so I'm pleasing God the prophet was not trying to please people he wanted to please God but he expected from God a number so when the angel came the prophet asked a question they were saying this Rob 500 and me couple so what should I do and then the angel replied do as you are LED give me a number I want a number so I can feel safe and secure that's what he want that's all what we want Lord show me what to do go by faith I don't want to go by faith cuz I can do a mistake I don't want to I want to have a no fault in my life so Lord tell me what to do go by faith do as you're LED what is your motive what is your objective go by faith well what if what if I'm wrong if you're wrong God's going to show it to you God's going to show it to you Lord I'm sorry you know my motive was right but I realized that was not the thing to to do Lord praise the Lord I'm going to rise up again and I'm I'm going to go at it again it's like the men that Prophet talks about he he was supposed to be hired and on his pen he didn't have any eraser and he says we won't hire you well he says I don't need an eraser cuz I don't do mistakes says we won't hire you cuz we don't want those kind of people bring an eraser on your spiritual life and that eraser is the blood of Jesus Christ every mistake pass presents and future is already covered because the sin question has been dealt with so in the beginning you know of the message the beginning of the movement they were using all the quotes that were harsh and rules don't do this do this do that don't touch don't look don't don't do to it's to hope to bring the church to Perfection it didn't work people were fighting each other people were spying each other like the guest Appo I saw brother so and so you know what he did and people are spying because you such you have this atmosphere that you living under the law like exactly like the Pharisees that's right and doesn't bring nobody to to adulthood he bring nobody to maturity everybody fusses they're trying to find a new rule it doesn't work so law made nothing perfect you know why law was sent the Ten Commandment they were send only and that's in the Book of Romans Paul explains that the Ten Commandments and all the law they were sent to prove to you and to me that it's impossible to follow the law and that you are a sinner CU if the law would have worked we didn't need to cross but the law was to show to every one of us you can't make it without the cross you need the cross but the problem is sometime after people are Christian well I receive the Holy Ghost I'm supposed to be perfect then I can follow the ten commandments cuz now the Ten Commandments are written in my heart so now I'm supposed to fall perfectly in line but you still live in the flesh of course the law of God is written in your heart but you're in your flesh so you might fail sometime and that's why there's an atonement all right let's move on cuz we got a lot more so Paul is talking I was made a minister in whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect so tellos it was the line here so every time you have the word perfect in the Bible it's a about maturity wanting nothing complete that's the purpose so the purpose of Paul is saying I was a minister and I'm preaching to make people mature and complete but if you preach rules you you keep people on the kids level so James 1 says let but let patience have have her perfect word that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so you got to fool again we we isolated the word perfect but we never look at the context the per the word perfect strike us so hard we stop read reading but here he's saying perfect which is entire means complete wanting nothing that's the that's the meaning of the word perfect so I think you got the point he talking about kid here every for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belong to them that are full age again it's the same word tellos perfect so we could have read but strong me belonging to them that are perfect you start seeing it's in the Bible it's everywhere even those who by reason have used and so you're either a baby or you have full age and if you're a baby don't don't don't crush yourself this morning babies are awesome your father is God I mean you're in good hands you can start growing cuz now the competitiveness here based performing based they listen to this sermon and they're not blessed they're like I'm still a baby so what's the worth I'm not full grown I'm not a full man you know you always find the negative side to every sermon and apply it to yourself God wants to free you from that again but when that which is perfect is come then that which in part shall be done away so perfect is complete partial complete partial complete when I was a child I spake like a child why because I was partial but God wants to make us complete so we understood as a child we thought as a child but when I became aen perfect I put away childish things for now we see true a glass Darkly but then when but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I so I am known when we going to see Jesus face to face then when Jesus was on the cross he said when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost you know what's the Greek word when he was at the cross and he spread his arm he says it is oh [Applause] Hallelujah it is finished that word has a deeper s it's talking about being paid it's fulfilled it's f finish it has many meaning first of all it is finished I'm dying it is finished I paid the price it is finished in the sense of this is now accomplished it's perfect because because he died and he gave his life nothing could stop you now not sin that's why it says nothing shall separate us from the love of God neither that tribulation whoever whatever because he spread his harm and he gave up the ghost He said it it's finished and because of that you and me have a Greater Hope Hallelujah all right let's go back to Matthew after hurry up here how many believe we're in the harvest season so if we're in the harvest season we're in the maturity season that's why it's time to put all the childish thing aside cuz it's the time to grow up so the Harvest is the end of the world and it's the children of the Kingdom that needs to mature so we need to enter a season of maturing now to understand that we got to go back to draw the prophecy of you know the former rain and the latter rain I got to go quick on that but I I know you are well taught in the word so we just just want to he hit here at climax so we understand how come why is the word perfect being mature is so important right now for us to De uh dive into it is so important because we are in the season of maturing so the prophet in uh spoken word is original seeds talking about the you know the there was a reign of teaching you know the former reain was teaching and the rain of the rain the latter rain is the rain of harvest you another word I'll be a it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we've had the teaching rain and we're ready now for the Harvest rain now you have to look at the dates because there are a lot of people who read quotes but they don't understand quotes they don't look at the date they they they would read that this morning and says Oh Praise the Lord you know the Harvest rain is coming no that scripture is fulfilled that was in 62 but something happened later and we're going to dive into this this morning for us to understand the Harvest rain is not coming it's pouring right [Applause] now you know the first rain is when you plant the seed that start you crop your crop growing but ju then just before it matures then comes another crop and that's what they call the Harvest R so the Harvest rain is the L latter rain that make the crop mature ready to be ribbon so that's why the prophet's talking about you know that we need he the Son of God s o n Su n we have to lay in his presence to remove all the greenness outside of our life for us to become mature so in the spoken word says what's the matter she is now waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruits I hope you get her then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap so it's all about the where you come from the seed that was planted and the seed that was planted it comes from the bag of the Lord Jesus Christ sons of God sons of God sons of God there's no changes of species what you put in the ground will come to maturity Hallelujah so he says God isn't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to the original seed he is going as he stated in verse 23 by the teaching of former Reign next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith okay so the Harvest Reign is the faith for the Rapture so the rapturing faith is what we need to mature so something needs to happen now there's a lot of people like like the pyramid you know well now I need to go back to the grocery and go by and add to my cart rapturing fate man I hope it's on sale and sometime people are are are are confused because we you got to understand what we're talking about even when you read St John you need the you know the comforter will come then the spiritual truth will come then this peace will come it's like man I need to buy so many things no it's all the same thing it's him rapturing faith is in the seed it's already in the seed but need the right kind of rain to express it so we need to recognize how did that season start what causes the latter ring to come to Give Me ratering Faith and in seeing that it will bring me to maturity so the prophet is saying here we got to remember that Harvest rain equals rapturing faith obviously because if the seed is mature he has to be riing to be to be brought into G you call you call it a Garner right in the barn to be brought up out there so that that rain will make that seed mature so he can be Rapture we're in that season right now praise the Lord so there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed the last day in order to get the bride together for rapturing fate we're going with h with it's like a puzzle we're we're hading pieces together and at the end of the service we want to have a more clear picture so if the latter rain equals rapturing faith and that rapturing faith comes with the revelation of the seven tunders now we we know where to look at to to see how that season started for those are not familiar the seven Thunders is the revelation of the Seven Seals so this is 63 again so we understand with the message Rapture that a prophet says something for the first time he links the seven seal and those seven angel coming down he links it to the coming of the Lord which a lot of people in this message are missing it because he said it once at the end of his ministry and there's people unfortunately in the message that to believe something they have to see the prophet saying 10 times and unless he say 20 times they don't believe it but how many how many times John the Baptist says this is he right I think we have twice recorded in the Bible he says this is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world well John the Baptist said said that once you know and I was not even there now what's important is not quantity it's not the fact you were there now what's important did he say it right well he said it and we had that moment with the prophet when he says this is your lord up there coming down with a shout and that coming down with a shout is the revelation of the seals you know for too many people they see the seals as information no the seals is not information it has information but the seventh seal the seventh one is Christ himself coming down and that's the main part is that he has come and he is here to gather his bride the prophet said that Christ himself opened the seal cuz he is the seal and in coming down with the shout he is gathering in the bride himself and that's what causes the rapturing faith knowing that we are in that season right now so those seven tunders or those seven seal because they are tunders unless they're revealed the once where they're reveal it's no more a mystery a thunder is the voice of God in mystery form is did you hear what he said no I just heard right people on Earth even like they hear thunder when when when God is talking but when the Thunder is revealed now you say you know what he's saying amen and so he says there were three stages of it as I said the martyr's age and the stage of the reformers and now they're calling out time when finish at Le O and according to Revelation 10 the mystery of all the Bible would be known to the bride is that right Revelation 10 listen close now bride called out by the word Christ himself calling out the bride so it's not the church calling you it's not the rules calling you it's not even William bradam calling you because he has pointed you William bradam has pointed you to Christ and now your eyes is on Christ and as your eyes is on Christ he's maturing you because he's telling you I have come down in 63 and with my shout I'm gathering people calling out of out of many mothers many womens to gather not to make another church even though when we are gathered we are a church because we are a woman but it's to be gathered around Christ we don't want to recreate the same system we were supposed to leave so when Christ came down in 63 that's exactly what the prophet says I hope I hope you get it those seven Thunders they bring the bright together for rapturing Faith and rapturing faith is the rain for the Arvest and the rain for the Arvest bring you to maturity amen hallelujah Hall how come how so let me give you an example we we preach Friday night but because of the opening of the word we now know that we were not elected by four knowledge based on our choice that's right but because of the Revelation the seven tunders because of the revelation of the book of redemption we now know that we are chosen by origin that we were in him before for the foundation of the world right and we come from him and we go back to him that what's give us Faith to mature because we don't question our election anymore that's just one partial truth that I'm giving you to see the impact of Revelation 10 and for those who are not acquainted to that Revelation 10 you know a lot of people focus on Revelation 107 and it's important but when they see 1077 they skip the first six verse which were even more important because they're talking about Christ coming down with a shout to gather and the only people who hear the shout they have a seed inside because in that coming he comes from for those who has a seed it's disappointing when you have people they look they want to give their life to Jesus they are promising and then you when you talk to them about a prophet they're like ah well Christ is coming there's going to be a Rapture what and it seems like they would believe the Bible they would believe Jesus but when they hear about that maybe it's not for them so he says here Christ not William brandham not brother Steve not brother all not this church any other other church but Christ the great Harvester is now reaping the fruit of the earth he gathers the wheat into the Garner by coming for his own and receiving them forever unto himself then he returns to destroy the Wicked with fire unquenchable now obviously God Christ is using Servants of God don't get me wrong but the focus is on Christ a true servant needs to point to Christ but he gathers by coming for his own are you his I hope since Friday night some of you have solve that question I miss because if you're not you're questioning he's coming for you he's calling you but you're not listening CU you're you're listening but like Lord I'm not worthy Lord I'm not worthy I cannot be your son I've made so many mistake I'm not perfect that's where we fall back that is why Friday night and this morning is to remove those rocks sitting on the seed preventing you from growing cuz you question always your status and if you stop questioning your status you question your behavior amen I hope you're getting it in closing so he says I believe the church is beginning to hear the message the message is not William brandham the message is Christ and beginning to understand it but friend listen we've got to lay in the presence of the son we've got to be rippen our faith isn't ripped intellectually intellectually we're hearing the message that God has gave us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it proving it in the Bible it's there but oh how the church need to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so that it can be bathed down that's why I believe as more as the church mature she tenders become more soft I talked about the spirit that's in this church it's a sign of maturity because when you're under the law you're all tensed up all feared because you your behavior has been spied on and you're watching and everybody's nervous and tight that when we move into that freedom that Perfection laying in his presence then you get the sweet Spirit then it's not about finding fault in your brother then it's not about to disqualify this Minister it's not about to send him in a foolish virgin who sent him to hell it's about praying Lord pray I pray for my brother that's right or Lord even more mature Lord maybe I'm wrong and he's right oh my why don't we are so sure that we're right that's right you got an idea why are you so sure this is pride the more the year go the more I question what I believe and I'm talk I'm not talking about the word I'm not I'm talking about little detailed stuff that I was holding really holding on to it and I'm like I believe it so I'm going to do it but I'm not trying to enforce it maybe maybe I'm overboard with this in maturity you become less sure about yourself and more sure about God because God has started a work in your life and you will finish it amen amen so he says the original weed seed at Pentecost I got to hurry up here but he says it was to mature in lysia and he says but now according to the time where we stand in the Le leodan age a prophet messenger Revelation 10:7 must already be in the Land once more thus said the Lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible Vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the har and the thing the shock and nurture it so the shock I kind of Shield you protect you but now as the shock is pulling away you are exposed to the environment the shock has to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the Sun so it can be ripping all those you have been sheltered by the church the church tell you don't say that don't do that no you're not supposed to get rid of that you should buy that you don't do this you don't you the shell is protecting you but when you're mature the mother's supposed to let you go so you are connected the presence of the son is your father it's only in its presence only the father can bring you to maturity Church rules will keep you in a childish State that's right and that's what the ma the thing that matters with the message today those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the Pres of the you got those quotes in 65 where he's saying all the church needs to do now is to lay in its presence to mature you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenest out of you making mature Christians if we change the word here making perfect Christians you're still not used to that see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christians to him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe so he keeps repeating that on and on the grain is to be in the presence of the sun then the great elevator will take up up his bride into to the glory the musicians can come let's B our heads Lord we need to be lay in your presence Lord like Adam and Eve when it was the evening time you were coming down and you had Fellowship Adam and Eve had no doubts in their mind that they were sons and daughters and at the evening time you were coming and they were not asking are we are we your kids will you receive us do you accept me Lord am I good enough you think this was the basic of their their basis of the their Fellowship ship it was not that's why friends we have to move on it's the evening time Christ has come down and he wants a fellowship with his bride he wants to talk to you he wants to talk to you this morning he wants to say you are mine why don't you settle this question in your heart you are my daughter you are my son I'm not looking at your behavior I'm looking at the Lamb on the cross when the worshipper was coming to worship the high priest was inspecting the lamb the worshipper was never inspected he has come down in this time in this in this end time and he wants to fellowship with his bride he's not looking at the behavior he doesn't even see you he sees the blood but he wants a fellowship he wants a conversation that's what the prophecy means when he says you got to lay in his presence why don't you lay in his presence with an open heart say Lord It's unbelievable unbelievable you received me you have accepted me I can now rest in your presence Lord we want to cast every fear and scare this morning in the name of Jesus Christ so your Holy Spirit May flow in this places from heart to heart so they can truly enjoy your presence and and lay in your presence cuz it's your presence that removed the greenest out of our life in that season where your people the people of the open book knows that you have come down and with that shout you have gathered people around you you have not gathered people around Jeffersonville around Canada you have gathered people around you cuz you've come to get the bride and she had made herself ready I pray Lord Jesus that you free your people from the bondage of Law and that they could walk into Grace because Lord when that Capstone came down the Bible says Grace [Music] Grace the only way to receive that coming of the lord it's by Grace thank you Lord bless your people I pray in Jesus name amen we can stand up sing this song glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad your God blessy has followed me so glad you found [Music] me so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm so glad so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad your mer Mery has followed me so glad you found me and set me free so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm Yours hallelujah amen may the Lord just ink this in our hearts Edge this into our hearts amen the potential to become mature is in the seed and all we need to do is just let the Holy Spirit rain on the seed amen and we're living in that Harvest time we're living in that lateran time we're living when this under the Son of God anointing the seed that is already in the God's seed his type God type Hallelujah has been sowed I love that principle that the seed that's being sow is the sons of God it's not something that's swn into us it is the sons of God Amen Hallelujah and those sons of God are maturing in the right atmosphere may God give us Grace just to surrender to stop focusing on oh I made a mess again and I did this and I did that and I have to go back to the beginning and I have failed again amen yes we repent of those things of course course we know those things amen but it's so important to see it's not my choices that makes it from God's perspective I mean that brings me to maturity the potential is in the seed yes we have to make the right choices but the potential is in the seed linking it back to Friday night it was God's choice I mean we are we are elected not because of our choice we're elected by God's choice oh I love these things really enjoyed it thank
