[1:02:19] was saying to him this morning, time

[1:02:26] thank you very much for for coming and
[1:02:30] especially taking the load off me this
[1:02:31] morning. So that's a a real blessing.

[1:02:59] Um, sorry to do this here, but I just
[1:03:01] don't know what else to do. But, um,
[1:03:03] Paula left a a phone charger cable there
[1:03:07] last night. So, if someone maybe picked
[1:03:09] it up, I'd appreciate if you could just
[1:03:11] pass it on to her.
[1:03:14] Praise the Lord. Well, Brother Ben
[1:03:15] doesn't need any introduction, so u I'm
[1:03:18] not going to take too much time. We'll
[1:03:20] just sing one more song and then I'll
[1:03:22] hand straight over to him. Um,
[1:03:26] as brother Jeremy was playing this song,
[1:03:28] I just thought that would be
[1:03:31] maybe unusual song to come up with, but
[1:03:34] I um,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; if we sing it with the right hearts,
[1:03:38] then I believe it will be a blessing to
[1:03:40] us. Amen. Bigger than all my problems,
[1:03:44] bigger than all my problems, bigger than
[1:03:48] all my fears. God is bigger than any
[1:03:51] mountain that I cannot see.
[1:03:55] Bigger than all my questions, bigger
[1:03:58] than anything. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:04:01] [Applause]
[1:04:10] Heat. Heat.
[1:04:22] Yeah. Heat.
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:32] Heat.
[1:04:35] Heat.
[1:04:45] Yeah.
[1:04:47] Heat.
[1:04:50] [Applause]
[1:04:58] Yeah.
[1:05:00] Heat.
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:34] Okay.
[1:05:36] Amen. Who can testify that's true?
[1:05:39] Hallelujah. He's bigger than everything.
[1:05:41] Amen. And there's nothing too hard for
[1:05:43] our God.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you musicians.
[1:05:46] Thank you. God bless you all. Great to
[1:05:48] be here. Appreciate the invitation,
[1:05:49] brother Array. And it was great to be
[1:05:50] here yesterday to celebrate with Justin
[1:05:52] and Carissa. We're so excited for them.
[1:05:54] So I pray all goes well and enjoy life
[1:05:57] together. And um yeah, when yeah, when
[1:05:59] the wedding comes and everything. So
[1:06:01] yeah, we're happy to be here. Want to
[1:06:02] say thank you very much for your prayers
[1:06:04] for Christine. We really literally feel
[1:06:06] like we've been carried by the prayers
[1:06:07] of the saints. So it's been phenomenal.
[1:06:09] So really appreciate it. Um, yeah, it's
[1:06:12] been an interesting time, but you know,
[1:06:13] the Lord is the Lord is good. The Lord
[1:06:15] is working. Um, you know, as soon as the
[1:06:17] other car rear ended her, uh, the Lord
[1:06:19] dropped in her heart Romans 8:28, that
[1:06:21] all things work together for good. Those
[1:06:22] that love God are called according to
[1:06:24] his purpose. This is working for our
[1:06:25] good.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know the details, but God
[1:06:28] takes care of those things. So, you
[1:06:29] know, so we just trust the Lord. And
[1:06:31] yes, so thank you for your prayers.
[1:06:33] Really, thank you so much. Really
[1:06:35] appreciate that. Amen. Let's um Yeah.
[1:06:37] And all the folks back home, say hi.
[1:06:39] Say, "God bless you." So, it's great to
[1:06:41] be here. See you all. Amen. Let's just
[1:06:42] go to John chapter 10 and we're going to
[1:06:45] read um how do I drive this thing with
[1:06:47] this?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go. Okay, perfect. Thank
[1:06:51] you. Okay, so yeah, John 10 and 27.
[1:06:55] And uh we're just going to read um
[1:06:57] couple of scriptures here. And this is
[1:07:00] um not anything I've got nothing new to
[1:07:03] bring. Um I just pray this will be a
[1:07:06] blessing. So John 10:27
[1:07:09] um the Lord Jesus speaking here says say
[1:07:11] says my sheep hear my voice and I know
[1:07:14] them and they follow me and I give unto
[1:07:16] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:07:18] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:07:20] out of my hand. My father which gave
[1:07:22] them me is greater than all and no man
[1:07:24] is able to pluck them out of my hand. I
[1:07:27] and my father are one. Then the Jews
[1:07:29] took up stones again to stone him. Jesus
[1:07:31] answered them, "My good many good works
[1:07:34] have I showed you from my father. for
[1:07:36] which of um those works do you stone me?
[1:07:40] And then and then he says, "Then the
[1:07:42] Jews answered him, saying, for a good
[1:07:43] work we stone thee not."
[1:07:47] Uh stone not. I mean, sorry, I'm just
[1:07:49] changing where I'm reading from. Then
[1:07:51] the Jews, yeah, so so for a good work we
[1:07:53] stone thee not, but for blasphemy and
[1:07:55] because that thou being a man makest
[1:07:57] thyself God. Jesus answered them, "Is it
[1:08:00] not written in your law that I said ye
[1:08:01] are gods? if he called them gods unto
[1:08:04] whom the word of God came and the
[1:08:05] scripture cannot be broken. Say ye of
[1:08:08] him whom the father hath sanctified and
[1:08:10] sent into the world. Thou blasphemst
[1:08:12] because I said I am the son of God. If I
[1:08:15] do not the works of my father believe me
[1:08:17] not. But if I do but if I do though you
[1:08:19] believe me not believe the works that ye
[1:08:21] may know and believe that the father's
[1:08:24] father is in me and I in him. Amen. So
[1:08:28] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:08:29] prayer. If you have a need, just say,
[1:08:30] "Lord, come come by my way." You know,
[1:08:32] the prophet taught us he always comes
[1:08:34] where he's invited.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, let's just invite him. Let's
[1:08:37] have a moment. I'm inviting him to where
[1:08:39] I'm at. So, let's just say, "Lord, come
[1:08:41] by my way this morning." Amen. Let's
[1:08:42] pray this morning. Gracious heavenly
[1:08:44] father, as we bow our heads in your
[1:08:46] great presence, we just want to
[1:08:47] acknowledge truly you're bigger than all
[1:08:49] our problems, our mountains. Father,
[1:08:51] whatever we may be facing in life, we
[1:08:53] know you have already conquered all
[1:08:55] things, Lord. So, we just want to come
[1:08:56] with great thanksgiving in our hearts
[1:08:58] that we're your children by your supreme
[1:09:00] grace. Thank you, Lord, that you are
[1:09:02] alive and well and working in our lives.
[1:09:04] And father, we've read your great word.
[1:09:06] Lord, we need you to come and speak it,
[1:09:07] Lord. Anoint it, Lord. You're the author
[1:09:09] of the book, Lord. So, we just want to
[1:09:11] yield all of ourselves, Lord, into your
[1:09:13] hands, dear God. Lord, I pray you'd
[1:09:15] speak through me, hear through the
[1:09:16] people, Lord. May you worship through
[1:09:18] all of us, Lord. May you be glorified in
[1:09:20] our midst. That's what we want to do is
[1:09:21] praise you and give you praise due unto
[1:09:23] your great name. So Lord, I pray you'd
[1:09:25] be with us, Lord. Be with those who
[1:09:26] couldn't be here today, Father. Sick and
[1:09:29] body, Lord. Whatever is going on, be
[1:09:30] their abundant portion. Lord, we commit
[1:09:32] them into your hands. We thank you,
[1:09:34] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[1:09:38] have your seats this morning. So, I want
[1:09:40] to speak about I want to speak about the
[1:09:42] great controversy about God being in
[1:09:44] man. So, as I said, this is nothing new
[1:09:46] or, you know, I'm sure this is all very
[1:09:48] familiar to us. But, you know, it's
[1:09:50] amazing when when when we look at how
[1:09:52] how the reason they would want to stone
[1:09:54] the Lord Jesus is because he made
[1:09:56] himself God, right? So, it wasn't his
[1:09:59] good works. It wasn't his healings, it
[1:10:00] wasn't the miracles, it was the fact he
[1:10:02] said, "I am God made flesh." And it's
[1:10:04] always been a great controversy through
[1:10:06] the ages about God being in man. You
[1:10:09] know when we when we use the term you
[1:10:11] know even you know anyone or any
[1:10:13] denomination has no problem saying that
[1:10:16] that the Holy Ghost dwells in them. Even
[1:10:19] the Catholics would acknowledge that.
[1:10:21] But the thing is what happens is people
[1:10:23] take take that and they actually
[1:10:25] diminish it that the Holy Ghost is is
[1:10:27] somehow a lesser part of God or a third
[1:10:30] part of the God, you know, a third
[1:10:31] person in the Godhead and actually
[1:10:33] diminish him because we know the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost is Jesus Christ in spirit form. He
[1:10:37] is supreme deity. Amen. He's not a god.
[1:10:40] He's not a lesser being. He's the
[1:10:42] supreme one that made heavens and earth.
[1:10:44] And brother Bram says, we'll come to it
[1:10:45] later. He says, "Dity is not just in
[1:10:47] heaven, but in but it's in you." Amen.
[1:10:49] So the controversy is is is actually the
[1:10:52] fact we can say the God who made heavens
[1:10:54] and earth is in you. Amen. Not a lesser
[1:10:57] God, not a religious spirit vying for
[1:10:59] power or control. No, the one who
[1:11:01] conquered hell, death, and the grave
[1:11:02] dwelt in his children. Amen. So this is
[1:11:05] but but this is actually quite a
[1:11:07] controversy because people cannot seem
[1:11:09] to fathom because the devil can't fathom
[1:11:11] it how the Lord of glory who's higher
[1:11:13] than the heavens. Holier he's so holy
[1:11:15] that even angels look dirty in his sight
[1:11:18] could come and dwell in a people such as
[1:11:20] us. Amen. So so this stumbles people. It
[1:11:23] actually makes people offended. You know
[1:11:24] it's actually a pagan idea to split God
[1:11:26] into pieces. This is what the world
[1:11:28] wants to try and do. Say yes you have
[1:11:30] the Holy Ghost but it's a a lesser God.
[1:11:33] No, it is the God. Uh, so this is very I
[1:11:36] I know I'm preaching to the choir, but I
[1:11:37] just pray that when when we're all said
[1:11:39] and done, you actually realize who's
[1:11:40] really in me, who's motivating my life,
[1:11:43] who drew me, who saved me, who called
[1:11:45] me, who kept me, who's revealing himself
[1:11:47] to me. It's not some Buddhist some
[1:11:50] statue somewhere or some spirit roaming
[1:11:52] around. It's the God who made all
[1:11:54] things. Amen. So, I trust we can have a
[1:11:56] good time this morning and just enjoy
[1:11:58] these things. Amen. Because the because
[1:12:00] the word, you know, you know, the word
[1:12:02] says that God the Almighty dwells in the
[1:12:05] believer.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Who's ever heard the saying, you know, I
[1:12:08] know this is a denominational thing, but
[1:12:09] they say, you know, I let Jesus into my
[1:12:11] heart, but now I need to receive the
[1:12:12] Holy Ghost. Who's heard things like
[1:12:14] that?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; That's a pagan idea
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is the Holy Ghost. You
[1:12:19] don't have to give, you know, you don't
[1:12:20] have to, oh, Jesus came in, now I need
[1:12:21] another part of God. He's all that he is
[1:12:24] is in you.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. No, just here we go.
[1:12:29] Now, this is this is Isaiah 53. Now,
[1:12:31] because the big thing we wrestle with is
[1:12:33] always the form God comes in. That's the
[1:12:36] it's it's the outside bit.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; It's the outside bit that's
[1:12:40] controversial. Says, you know, even the
[1:12:41] prophecy would be here in Isaiah. He
[1:12:43] says, "Who has believed our report? And
[1:12:45] to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:12:46] revealed?" Well, it's those who the arm
[1:12:48] of the Lord is revealed beliefs his
[1:12:49] report. So, the arm of the Lord's been
[1:12:51] revealed to you. We're a blessed people
[1:12:53] this morning. Amen. For he shall grow up
[1:12:55] before you as a tender plant, as a root
[1:12:57] out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor
[1:13:00] comeliness, that when we shall see him,
[1:13:02] there is no beauty, amen, that we should
[1:13:04] desire him. So his outward form is not
[1:13:06] some fantastic thing. You know how how
[1:13:08] the traditions of, you know, you see
[1:13:10] like a children's Bible or some
[1:13:12] traditional picture of Jesus and he's
[1:13:14] like 6' blonde head, looks different to
[1:13:16] everyone else that's in the picture. He
[1:13:17] looked exactly the same. I actually
[1:13:19] could say he probably looked less than
[1:13:20] everyone else in reality. There was
[1:13:22] nothing when you saw him. Oh yes, this
[1:13:24] is the Messiah. But the life that was
[1:13:26] manifesting, I mean, the word was made
[1:13:28] flesh. It was God on the inside. I could
[1:13:31] put it that way. I mean, I mean, that
[1:13:32] was manifesting himself. That was the
[1:13:34] God part.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; We know he was the God man, but it was
[1:13:37] deity was in him, right? The fullness of
[1:13:39] Godhead bodily. I'm not splitting God
[1:13:40] up. Okay? I believe in one. All right?
[1:13:43] So, we're okay. But you see now the
[1:13:45] outside was not the thing that Oh, yes,
[1:13:47] that's him. And it's the same thing with
[1:13:49] us. You know, you look at the believer
[1:13:51] and it's such a contrast to the great
[1:13:53] cathedrals of the world, the great
[1:13:54] Polish worship of the world, the
[1:13:56] charismatic move. Now, it's all
[1:13:57] choreographed and perfect and we come
[1:13:59] along. Now, I'm not talking here. You
[1:14:00] guys are amazing. But, you know, we just
[1:14:02] come along and you like compare the two
[1:14:04] and say, "No, man. These guys, what's
[1:14:06] going on here?" But that's God
[1:14:09] manifested in a body.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God. Amen. It is the brideg
[1:14:14] of Jesus Christ. Amen. where God himself
[1:14:16] is now veiled behind you. Praise the
[1:14:19] Lord. Amen. I tell you what, friends, if
[1:14:21] you realize if God's in you, what
[1:14:23] complex can hinder you? I mean, what
[1:14:25] unbelief can stop you? I mean, what what
[1:14:27] what fear or what stigma or what worry?
[1:14:29] I mean, if you realize the God who made
[1:14:31] all things that conquered hell, death,
[1:14:33] and the grave, remember, he conquered
[1:14:34] everything. There's not anything else
[1:14:36] that needs to be conquered. He conquered
[1:14:38] it all. Amen. So, if he conquered it
[1:14:40] all, the victorious Christ dwells in
[1:14:42] you. Amen. Then to me, that just raises
[1:14:44] my faith. There's nothing impossible
[1:14:46] with me. Amen. Because he the one who
[1:14:48] does the impossible dwells in me.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we got to realize this very God
[1:14:52] dwells in you and I. Amen. So what can
[1:14:54] he do? I mean what can he not do? He he
[1:14:56] can do everything.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; So I think that should take the
[1:14:59] limitation. You say, "Oh yeah, but it's
[1:15:00] me and and he's in me. So therefore he's
[1:15:02] different." No, he's the same God
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; who took the keys of hell in the grave
[1:15:07] of Satan. The same one who conquered all
[1:15:09] spirits of culture, religious spirits,
[1:15:12] stigmas. He was born with a black name
[1:15:14] of being an illegitimate child. He rose
[1:15:16] above that. He rose above rejection. He
[1:15:18] rose above hurt because he is here to
[1:15:20] I'm here to do one thing, the will of my
[1:15:23] father. Amen. He knew the word that he
[1:15:24] was there to fulfill. And remember,
[1:15:26] you're here to fulfill the word, too.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we can praise God and
[1:15:31] say, "Lord, if you're in me, I I you can
[1:15:34] do anything, Lord.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; This guy, he's different, but you can do
[1:15:37] anything, Lord." Amen. Now remember
[1:15:39] remember the Lord himself said there's
[1:15:41] nothing impossible with you. All things
[1:15:43] are possible to them that believe.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Oh well do I have enough faith? Well are
[1:15:48] you saved?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Did you believe in the Lord Jesus? He
[1:15:51] came in changed your life. Amen. Are you
[1:15:53] a different person to when you first
[1:15:55] surrendered your life? You're going from
[1:15:56] glory to glory.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Then you've got all the faith. God grows
[1:16:00] our faith. But you got to see you have
[1:16:02] faith. You got more than you realize.
[1:16:03] You're packing more than you think you
[1:16:05] have. Oh, I'm just going through life
[1:16:07] and struggling and seem to be just
[1:16:08] wandering around. You ain't wandering.
[1:16:11] God's direct yours directed your steps.
[1:16:13] Amen. The footsteps of the righteous are
[1:16:15] ordered of the Lord.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, there's some steps I
[1:16:18] wish I didn't have to walk down." They
[1:16:20] were ordered.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And was it cuz God was displeased with
[1:16:23] you?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:16:26] Remember all the judgment we should have
[1:16:28] taken?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He took on Calvary. Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; The wrath of God, the judgment to to to
[1:16:34] fulfill the law, all those things he
[1:16:37] took on Calvary.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; There's no judgment for you and I. We've
[1:16:40] passed from death to life.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot go to the judgment cuz
[1:16:43] he took our judgment.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we can just walk with
[1:16:47] a lightness in our step and say, "Lord,
[1:16:49] I don't need to fear nothing. We don't
[1:16:50] need to fear death. We don't need to
[1:16:52] fear hell."
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; He went to hell, so you don't have to
[1:16:55] go.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; The closest you'll ever get to hell is
[1:16:57] in this plan of of existence. You'll
[1:17:00] never go anywhere closer to it,
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; but heaven, you're going a lot closer,
[1:17:03] too.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, what do we have to
[1:17:06] fear? I remember, you know, well, this
[1:17:08] is before I met Christine, but she was
[1:17:09] in Switzerland. She was nursing her uh
[1:17:11] auntie, so brother Albert's sister who
[1:17:13] was who was uh she had terminal brain
[1:17:15] cancer, and you know, she led her to the
[1:17:17] Lord before she passed. But, you know,
[1:17:18] she had Christine had an accident on a
[1:17:20] on a on a uh push bike and they gave her
[1:17:23] Tramodol and she had an anaphylactic
[1:17:25] reaction and she literally left her body
[1:17:27] in the in the hospital and she could
[1:17:30] look back and she could see her auntie
[1:17:31] her her her her other auntie weeping
[1:17:34] over her as she's laying there
[1:17:35] unresponsive and and and she's being
[1:17:37] lifted up into glory and and the one
[1:17:39] thing she wish you could tell her say,
[1:17:40] "You don't need to worry about me. This
[1:17:42] is amazing.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; There was no fear."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; There was no fear. Amen. Of course, we
[1:17:47] know she didn't die. She came back and
[1:17:48] here she is today. But you know, but but
[1:17:50] the thing is for the believer there's no
[1:17:52] fear.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You know, we get so caught up in
[1:17:55] troubles and things in our minds, but
[1:17:56] you got to realize when when when our
[1:17:58] human faculties are stripped away, our
[1:18:01] true self can come out.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; You know, you take the contrast, you
[1:18:05] know, brother Bram tells the story of
[1:18:06] there's that that lady who was a Sunday
[1:18:08] school teacher in a nominal church and
[1:18:09] you know, she got some disease. She was
[1:18:11] dying in the hospital and her and her
[1:18:13] pastor was pacing up and down the hall
[1:18:15] smoking a cigarette and all the Sunday
[1:18:17] school teach um children came to watch
[1:18:18] her be carried by angels to glory. Who
[1:18:20] knows that story, right? So now when her
[1:18:23] so so her reasoning made her think she
[1:18:25] was okay.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. But then when her mental faculties
[1:18:29] were going to leave her as she was
[1:18:30] dying, she realized her true state. Now
[1:18:33] you take the opposite of that to a
[1:18:34] believer cuz we have our mind bales. We
[1:18:36] got our complex, our things we wrestle
[1:18:37] with. Amen. But when when that human
[1:18:39] factor leaves our true state of our soul
[1:18:42] raises up. Amen. Instead of us saying
[1:18:44] we're lost, we've been deceived. We say,
[1:18:45] "I'm saved. I know in whom I believed."
[1:18:47] Amen. I'm secure. God's coming to carry
[1:18:50] me away. Hallelujah. Our true self comes
[1:18:52] out.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The true you comes out.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't worry about what you're
[1:19:01] going through. God's got you.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; And you're not going through it cuz he's
[1:19:05] displeased with you. Actually, brother
[1:19:07] Ram says that God, you found favor with
[1:19:09] God. That's why you're going through a
[1:19:10] trial. Amen. Because God has confidence
[1:19:12] in you. Not your human ability, but your
[1:19:14] but the faith in your soul. That gene
[1:19:16] seed. He's got confidence with you that
[1:19:17] you're going to go through and come out
[1:19:19] packing the victory.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't know what I'm going
[1:19:23] through. He does.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, this has always
[1:19:29] been the controversy. This is a I I
[1:19:32] doubt they were sitting down when this
[1:19:33] happened. But I try and find pictures.
[1:19:36] It's like just doesn't quite Yeah.
[1:19:37] Because the girls like pictures and
[1:19:39] things, you know, but you know, this is
[1:19:41] now deity coming into humanity. Amen.
[1:19:45] God coming and dwelling in his people.
[1:19:47] And this has always been the
[1:19:48] controversy. How can God dwell in man?
[1:19:50] Council of Nasa was a big argument about
[1:19:53] this. And they brought in Greek
[1:19:56] philosophy
[1:19:57] and describe God and all these things.
[1:20:00] But God wanted to dwell in man. Okay.
[1:20:03] Now, but the thing is we wrestle with
[1:20:05] the outside.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a cross-section of the
[1:20:09] of the coverings of the tabernacle in
[1:20:11] the wilderness. We know there's the you
[1:20:12] know the curtain and different things
[1:20:14] and but on the outside was badger skin.
[1:20:16] And this is the thing we wrestle with is
[1:20:18] the badger skin. Now I want you to think
[1:20:20] about this before the moment before God
[1:20:24] dw came and dwelt in that tabernacle,
[1:20:26] right? It was bad skin. When he came and
[1:20:29] dwelt in there above the cherubam and
[1:20:30] the holy of holies, above the mercy
[1:20:32] seat, the badger skin stayed bad skin.
[1:20:34] It did not become super duper bad skin,
[1:20:38] right? It did not become a different
[1:20:39] material. It was exactly the same bad
[1:20:42] skin it was before he stepped in. It's
[1:20:44] the same thing with you and I. This
[1:20:45] badger skin that we dwell in, it doesn't
[1:20:48] become a super duper bad skin after we
[1:20:50] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:52] It's the same old bad skin,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; right? that's got the same old nature,
[1:20:55] got the same old, you know, self. Yeah.
[1:20:58] Okay. Some of you have been super duper,
[1:20:59] but yeah, I'm still the same. But this
[1:21:02] is the thing we wrestle with cuz we
[1:21:04] think, if God's in me, how could I ever
[1:21:06] put a foot wrong? How could I ever make
[1:21:08] a mistake? How could I ever wonder or
[1:21:10] guess or second guess things or have
[1:21:11] troubles if God is in me? And the reason
[1:21:14] is this guy ain't changed yet.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; This guy is still unsaved. You carry an
[1:21:18] unbeliever around with you. Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; This guy. Amen. Even the human spirit is
[1:21:22] contrary to to God. That's why we need
[1:21:25] the word to come wash our human spirit
[1:21:27] out. Amen. Cleanse things that the devil
[1:21:29] tries to put in there and complexes and
[1:21:31] pains and hurts. And we just let the
[1:21:32] word come and wash it out.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We let come God come and scrub
[1:21:36] those things. But it's still the same
[1:21:37] human spirit. But there will come a day.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where this badge of skin is going
[1:21:42] to become a super duper badger of skin.
[1:21:44] Amen. Hallelujah. But you see, we we
[1:21:47] walk around in this thing because you
[1:21:48] look at that, you know, imagine if we
[1:21:50] went, you know, we're back there however
[1:21:52] many thousand years ago, you know, we're
[1:21:54] and somehow we're allowed to peek at the
[1:21:56] outside of the tabernacle. There's some
[1:21:58] Jewish brothers telling your sister
[1:21:59] telling you the God who made heavens and
[1:22:01] earth in the building you're about to
[1:22:03] see. The Lord of glory dwells. He spoke
[1:22:07] the worlds into existence. He's supreme
[1:22:09] over all. There's no God beside him.
[1:22:12] He's the He, you know, he's a supreme
[1:22:14] deity. and we come over the hill and we
[1:22:16] see a tent.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I think there'd be an underwhelmed
[1:22:20] feeling come over us. Let's be honest,
[1:22:22] okay? Where's the gold? Where's the big,
[1:22:24] you know, marble and the incredible
[1:22:26] facads and all the buildings and things
[1:22:28] and it's just a temple. I mean, you
[1:22:30] know, it's just a tent. Even even
[1:22:31] Solomon's temple wasn't really that
[1:22:32] great compared to others. But the
[1:22:34] difference is God made the difference.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; It was a word constructed building. I
[1:22:39] mean, just like you and I, we're word
[1:22:41] constructed buildings. Amen. Where God
[1:22:43] comes and dwells in us. But the
[1:22:44] difference is God was in there.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; God is in you. Christ in you the hope of
[1:22:48] glory. Not a lesser God. I know these
[1:22:50] things are elementary, but I just
[1:22:51] probably just anchor a little bit more
[1:22:53] into us. We realize God,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; not just a God or a religion or a
[1:22:58] movement. Him.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Elohim, the self-existing one is
[1:23:03] expressing himself through human flesh.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; You see, because the thing is we get,
[1:23:08] you know, but the thing is the badger
[1:23:09] skin is not important in this building.
[1:23:11] It's the God in the badger skin.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like this thing this this
[1:23:14] thing that we are so worried about, we
[1:23:17] wrestle with. It's just the skin, man.
[1:23:21] You know, well, that's easy for you to
[1:23:22] say. Well, no, it's not. But I Yeah, I
[1:23:24] wrestle with this this guy. Remember a
[1:23:27] badger. Isn't it amazing that the
[1:23:28] outside's not a lamb skin or it's not
[1:23:31] some animal that that that would typify
[1:23:34] or represent our Lord?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; It's not dove skin or, you know, it's
[1:23:38] not or a lamb or that kind of nature.
[1:23:40] It's a badger.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Who's ever seen? Well, the closest thing
[1:23:43] I seen to a badger is a honey badger.
[1:23:45] Man, those things are wild.
[1:23:48] They get into everything. They like
[1:23:49] their nature is not meek. It's not
[1:23:51] gentle. It's not kind. They'll take on
[1:23:52] anything. If it's if you're in its way,
[1:23:55] you better get out of its way. You'll be
[1:23:56] a lion. You can be an elephant.
[1:23:57] Whatever. Those got this mean kind of a
[1:23:59] temperament. And God would show that
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; as this.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; But it's not about this.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; We just got to come to reconciliation.
[1:24:09] God, you're working in me. God, you
[1:24:12] dwell in me. You're changing me from
[1:24:13] glory to glory. It's not about the skin.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the thing is we think that
[1:24:18] if we are perfect and we are sinlessly
[1:24:20] perfect.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ I I'll
[1:24:26] announce something to you this morning
[1:24:27] cuz that was a bit muted. The blood of
[1:24:29] Jesus Christ makes you sinlessly
[1:24:31] perfect.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you die, if you're under the
[1:24:34] blood right now, you die, you're going
[1:24:35] straight to glory.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean your destination is assured
[1:24:39] because remember brother Brown brought
[1:24:40] it out in the church age book the
[1:24:41] previous age the Methodist age what they
[1:24:44] did is they said it was the blood and
[1:24:45] your own good conduct.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; They did not know the blood and its
[1:24:49] reality though it worked in that age but
[1:24:51] now we've come into an age where the
[1:24:52] word has come into its fullness into its
[1:24:54] reality. And it's not the blood and your
[1:24:56] own good conduct. It is the blood alone
[1:24:58] of salvation. Remember we are saved by
[1:25:01] grace through faith. Amen. It is God's
[1:25:02] mercy. It's his atonement that matters.
[1:25:04] It's not your good conduct. You say,
[1:25:06] "Well, do I need to do good works?"
[1:25:08] Well, if he's in you, you will live the
[1:25:09] life cuz he's living it through you.
[1:25:11] Amen. It's not you trying to manufacture
[1:25:13] the message. That's why so many people
[1:25:14] have miserably, sadly failed at their
[1:25:16] own good intentions if humanly tried to
[1:25:18] manifest the word. Amen. But that will
[1:25:20] always come to a failure point. If you
[1:25:22] are frustrated in your Christian walk,
[1:25:24] just give over to the Lord a bit more.
[1:25:26] Just surrender yourself. Amen. Just say,
[1:25:28] "Lord, I can't live this stage of my
[1:25:30] life. I can't do this. I don't know."
[1:25:32] You say, "Lord, come and live through
[1:25:33] me." allow him to have dominion.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, we are free moral agents.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He doesn't come in and say, "Now look at
[1:25:42] now you're a robot." And we come and we
[1:25:44] are like robotically, you know. No, we
[1:25:48] still have our own human will. We have
[1:25:50] our own human desires, right? We're
[1:25:52] still people.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not robots. God doesn't want
[1:25:56] a robot. Like I I said, probably brother
[1:25:58] Marty would remember this. I don't know.
[1:25:59] But, you know, I said a couple of
[1:26:01] Sundays ago, you know, I never wanted a
[1:26:03] robot as a wife.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; I like Christine being her.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; She's got personality. She's got
[1:26:09] tenaciously. You know, she's got a real
[1:26:10] zeal. I love it.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God doesn't want a robot.
[1:26:15] He had angels to worship him. Sure, they
[1:26:17] had a free will. They could choose to do
[1:26:18] it. But, you know, he doesn't want some
[1:26:21] just a robotic, yes, Lord, I believe the
[1:26:23] message and I have no desire or I've
[1:26:26] killed every part of my human emotions
[1:26:27] and it's all dead. God never wanted
[1:26:29] that.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; God never wanted that. He wanted us to
[1:26:32] have our own personality and will. And
[1:26:34] that's why he made you the way you are.
[1:26:36] He likes you how you are. Amen. If
[1:26:38] you're quiet, he likes you quiet. If
[1:26:40] you're loud, he likes you loud. Whatever
[1:26:42] you are in that spectrum, he likes you
[1:26:44] how you are.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Why? You know, I think we just got to
[1:26:46] come to peace with the badger skin.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You mean my quirks and my things, he
[1:26:51] likes you that way. Imagine if we were
[1:26:53] all the same. We'd be boring, man.
[1:26:56] It'd be it'd be like, man, this is
[1:26:58] what's going on here. You know, if
[1:26:59] you're all like me, man, I'm sorry for
[1:27:01] you. You know,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; you know, but it would be it would be
[1:27:04] dull.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You know, but we look at someone else, I
[1:27:07] want to be like them. No, be how you
[1:27:09] are.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; God made you a certain way. If he wanted
[1:27:12] you different, he would have made you
[1:27:13] different. God has made you a certain
[1:27:15] way. Amen. for deity to be expressed in
[1:27:17] a unique way, not contrary to the word,
[1:27:20] but you can express God can express
[1:27:22] himself through your personality
[1:27:23] different to how he can express him
[1:27:25] through me.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Right? We're remember we're a bouquet.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Every part of the bouquet is important.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But but we seem to think that perfection
[1:27:35] is a flawless walk. Perfection is not
[1:27:39] flawlessness.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because if we get these
[1:27:42] things in our mind, and I'm sure you
[1:27:43] don't have them, but you know, you know,
[1:27:45] you know, you get this thing in your
[1:27:46] mind, I've got to have a po perfect
[1:27:48] walk, therefore I've matured. It ain't
[1:27:50] that.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; It ain't that. Perfection is not
[1:27:54] flawlessness.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we Why do we allow the
[1:27:57] devil to put something in our mind or an
[1:27:59] image before us that we could never
[1:28:01] obtain to and God never wanted you to
[1:28:03] obtain to?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not meant to have a
[1:28:06] flawless walk where I never have a bad
[1:28:08] day. I never have ill feelings. I never
[1:28:10] have any trouble. I never have any
[1:28:12] doubts or questions or wondering about
[1:28:15] things.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That no that is not perfection is by his
[1:28:20] blood.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Perfection is by his atoning blood.
[1:28:23] Amen. Perfection is not oh you see
[1:28:25] maturity is not that now I'm flawless.
[1:28:28] Okay let's just look at the prophet.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Okay here he is dispensational truth has
[1:28:34] come into his hand. The sword of the
[1:28:36] lord has come. The seals are come open.
[1:28:38] you know the book of redemption has come
[1:28:40] open you know incredible things that
[1:28:42] angels and believers have desired to
[1:28:44] look and when's the moment when the you
[1:28:45] know like John you know you know there's
[1:28:48] always a question when is this going to
[1:28:49] happen and then finally it's happened
[1:28:53] right Christ comes the seals come open
[1:28:55] reveal the truth and God releases a
[1:28:57] power in this age to break the curse of
[1:28:59] death and you know there's going to be a
[1:29:00] people who are alive and remain God's
[1:29:02] released a word into this season amen to
[1:29:04] transform us into the fullness of the
[1:29:06] word and then he's rejected It even says
[1:29:08] when he's preaching it, I know thousands
[1:29:10] of my friends are going to leave me
[1:29:11] because of this. It was all it was all
[1:29:13] according to the scripture. It wasn't
[1:29:14] anything added or taken away. But and
[1:29:16] and then what happened? He developed the
[1:29:18] complex.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; There he was a mature adopted son of
[1:29:22] God.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; There he was full of the Holy Ghost,
[1:29:26] seeing God, countless visions,
[1:29:28] supernatural God working with him in all
[1:29:30] of his life. And he develops a complex
[1:29:32] because his bad skin did not like
[1:29:34] rejection. And he had to be rejected cuz
[1:29:36] Christ was on the outside of the door in
[1:29:38] this age. So it had to be lived out.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; He wasn't happy about that. He was hurt.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He was human.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And he wanted to, you know, become a
[1:29:47] trapper up northern British Columbia. I
[1:29:49] know you know these stories, but you
[1:29:50] know, let's put yourself there because
[1:29:52] many things, oh, the prophet never did
[1:29:53] anything wrong. He said he did.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, he knew what to do in every
[1:29:59] circumstance, every situation. No, he
[1:30:01] didn't.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that. That's a deity
[1:30:05] spirit trying to deify the prophet.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; And then what does that do? It puts an
[1:30:09] idol before the people. And an idol
[1:30:10] always makes people fail and fall and be
[1:30:13] disappointed.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word of God did never put
[1:30:16] an image before us to make us be
[1:30:17] disappointed. But who realize, hey, he
[1:30:20] was a man of like passions just like we
[1:30:22] are. He had feelings and emotions,
[1:30:24] troubles, questions, all the unanswered
[1:30:26] prayers that seem to linger. But yet
[1:30:28] that did not change nothing of his walk
[1:30:29] with God. He was an adopted son. Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now if that's how the prophet
[1:30:35] was, but then we can now mind adoption
[1:30:38] as in we'll never have a problem. We'll
[1:30:41] know what to do everything. We'll never
[1:30:43] put a foot wrong. Never have anything
[1:30:44] that we cringe about and you know
[1:30:46] disappointments or have to make things
[1:30:47] right. No,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; I may be wrong here, brother. You can
[1:30:51] fix this. But you know, but I think we
[1:30:53] can get this thing in our mind of
[1:30:56] adoption and maturity which is not
[1:30:58] according to the scripture. It's not
[1:30:59] according to the message. Cuz brother
[1:31:01] Ram said a housewife is an adopted
[1:31:03] position in the body of Christ.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I mean what you're living actually you
[1:31:07] find I think we'll find that we're
[1:31:08] actually more adopted than we realize.
[1:31:10] Oh, one day and then one day all the
[1:31:12] power will come and one day God will
[1:31:13] pour himself out. I tell you what,
[1:31:15] friends, the power is here.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe this word has placed the
[1:31:20] people in their position in Christ.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, one day I've got to take some
[1:31:24] land. I tell you what, Caleb was
[1:31:26] anointed. Amen. When when he believed
[1:31:28] the believed the promise was his. Amen.
[1:31:30] The same power that was with him then
[1:31:33] made him get his mountain.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He did not become powerful when he
[1:31:37] received that mountain. No. When he
[1:31:39] believed it by faith and took it. Amen.
[1:31:41] He was an adopted son of God. God
[1:31:43] brought him into his position.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so why do we put this thing in
[1:31:47] front of us? Well, one day I'll get
[1:31:49] there. You know, it's like a donkey with
[1:31:50] a man and a stick and a carrot, you
[1:31:52] know, and gets the donkey to move. And I
[1:31:54] remember we tried when I was young, we
[1:31:55] had a golden Labrador. We had a little
[1:31:56] go-kart. So, we strapped into it one day
[1:31:58] and we had a stick and some food, you
[1:32:01] know, but when he realized he was
[1:32:02] pulling something, he just stopped here.
[1:32:04] I know this is this is not what I'm here
[1:32:05] for.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I think we need to stop.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; The devil puts things in front of us
[1:32:12] that just makes us disappointed.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we need to say, "No, hold
[1:32:16] on. Is this according to the scripture?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Is this according to really what Malachi
[1:32:20] 4 has revealed?"
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; If it's not, I'd forget it.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; We need to get these mindsets. I'm
[1:32:27] talking to myself very much. We need to
[1:32:28] get these mindsets out of our life, you
[1:32:29] know, because you know, it's not about
[1:32:31] perfection is not flawlessness.
[1:32:33] Actually, no. Perfection is is is
[1:32:36] because of the blood, because of his
[1:32:37] atonement. And sure, because the thing
[1:32:39] is, we will be disappointed in
[1:32:42] ourselves.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Every day. Well, not every day, but you
[1:32:45] know, we will be disappointed till these
[1:32:47] bodies are changed cuz we're human.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, does that mean you're an unbeliever?
[1:32:51] No.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Well, so I just want to labor this
[1:32:54] point. I I just want some liberty to
[1:32:56] come into our lives like never before.
[1:32:58] God saved me. God found me. He's filled
[1:33:00] me with his spirit. Amen. He's working
[1:33:01] in my life. Amen. The badge of skin is
[1:33:03] such a problem. But it shouldn't be.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, we have something within
[1:33:08] us that the world doesn't have.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because only a believer with the
[1:33:11] Holy Ghost can truly forgive. Amen. Only
[1:33:14] a believer with the Holy Ghost can tr
[1:33:15] because forgiveness is more than
[1:33:16] accepting an apology. It's a
[1:33:18] reconciliation. It's a restoration of a
[1:33:20] person back to what they were in the
[1:33:22] beginning.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:24] you can forgive that way. Amen. It's
[1:33:26] not, you know, it's not yes, I accept
[1:33:28] your apology. The world does that. No,
[1:33:30] the Holy Ghost can give true
[1:33:31] forgiveness. Are we all together this
[1:33:33] morning? Amen. Uh only someone with the
[1:33:36] Holy Ghost can actually get, you know,
[1:33:38] be healed and set free. And you can help
[1:33:40] someone else. You know, I've been
[1:33:41] thinking quite quite a bit recently of
[1:33:43] the of the four friends that carried
[1:33:45] their crippled friend into the presence
[1:33:46] of the Lord. you know, they couldn't get
[1:33:48] into the house, but their faith wasn't
[1:33:50] willing to take any obstacle as a as a
[1:33:54] I've got to stop here. They couldn't get
[1:33:55] into the house. Their faith did not say,
[1:33:58] "Well, I guess that's as far as we can
[1:33:59] go." Faith doesn't look at obstacles. It
[1:34:02] just looks at the result that's been
[1:34:05] revealed cuz faith is a revelation. So,
[1:34:06] what they do, they got up into the roof
[1:34:08] and they begin to put a sunroof into
[1:34:10] that guy's house. They didn't ask
[1:34:11] permission. They didn't ask for building
[1:34:13] consent or is this okay? No, they had a
[1:34:16] burden. We must get our crippled friend
[1:34:18] into the presence of the Lord that he
[1:34:20] can be healed. He can get up out of this
[1:34:22] cot that the cot doesn't define him
[1:34:24] anymore. Amen. But full health and
[1:34:26] restoration defines him. Amen. So, so
[1:34:29] what did they do? They took the ceiling
[1:34:30] off and they lowered him down and the
[1:34:32] and and you got to read the scripture.
[1:34:33] It says, "And the Lord said when he saw
[1:34:35] their faith,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; it's not about the crippled man's
[1:34:38] faith." It didn't even come into the
[1:34:40] story at all. It was the faith of the
[1:34:42] friends that got him there. Amen. And
[1:34:44] someone with the Holy Ghost can get a
[1:34:46] crippled person. Many times we look at,
[1:34:48] oh, their faith is not and they don't
[1:34:50] believe. Is that actually got anything
[1:34:51] to do with it? What about your
[1:34:53] revelation? I mean, what about your
[1:34:55] faith that you carry? Amen. Where you
[1:34:57] can actually by prayer and an atmosphere
[1:34:59] of the Holy Ghost take ceiling tiles
[1:35:01] off. Amen. To get people into the
[1:35:03] presence of God that God begin to talk
[1:35:05] to them first person and they can
[1:35:07] realize it's God speaking to me. And
[1:35:09] they'll finish with him saying, "Get up
[1:35:11] out of that affliction. Get up out of
[1:35:12] that unbelief." That's that's defining
[1:35:14] you. Get up out of it and carry it away
[1:35:16] as a trophy of my grace.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; We live in an age where self-esteem is
[1:35:26] so often spoken about.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Low self-esteem.
[1:35:32] And self-esteem we understand is a
[1:35:34] negative self- opinion marked by harsh
[1:35:36] self-criticism, ignoring achievements,
[1:35:38] believing oneself as inferior, and
[1:35:41] experiencing anxiety and shyness around
[1:35:43] others.
[1:35:47] What have you achieved in your life?
[1:35:49] Now, I'm not talking natural now because
[1:35:50] it doesn't matter.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; You can have the bit. You could own
[1:35:53] Tanaki. You can't take it with you.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; I could own I could be the Lord of
[1:35:58] Wellington.
[1:36:03] Thank God I'm not.
[1:36:05] But he said, "I can't take it with me. I
[1:36:07] can be Bill Gates or whoever whoever
[1:36:08] who's rich, Elon Musk or I I don't know
[1:36:10] who the guy is. Doesn't matter." But you
[1:36:11] know, you can't take anything of it with
[1:36:13] you.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; So achievements in life, I'm not talking
[1:36:16] about those achievements. But you see,
[1:36:17] the devil wants us to look at those
[1:36:18] achievements. Where are you? Where's
[1:36:20] your, you know, oh, you're this age, you
[1:36:22] should have this, you don't have this,
[1:36:23] and therefore you're this, and you know,
[1:36:24] all these negative things. But I tell
[1:36:26] you what, if you know, if you know the
[1:36:28] Lord,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; you've achieved
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; life,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; you've won the game of life. Amen. If
[1:36:35] you know Christ, you've won it all.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have eternal life. Amen. If
[1:36:41] you died right now, you know where
[1:36:42] you're going.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, but what about this and my bucket
[1:36:45] list and all these things? No, you've
[1:36:46] won it all.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; You have achieved really what life is
[1:36:50] all about. You know the master. Amen.
[1:36:52] You know the creator himself.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So why do I have low
[1:36:56] self-esteem and negative self- opinion?
[1:36:58] What's God's opinion of you?
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; What's the Lord's opin? Have you ever
[1:37:01] asked him, "Lord, what do you think of
[1:37:03] me?"
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we'll just take one. You
[1:37:07] know, when you go buy something in the
[1:37:08] shop or you make some big purchase,
[1:37:10] right? You put the value of the thing
[1:37:12] you're buying at greater value than your
[1:37:14] money.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you wouldn't buy it.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, the Lord Jesus comes to the
[1:37:19] earth because he's got a lamb's book of
[1:37:20] life that he needs to redeem.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what does he do? He puts the
[1:37:24] value of you at greater value of his own
[1:37:27] life.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; That's why he died on Calvary. If he
[1:37:30] thought his own life was more valuable,
[1:37:31] he would never have died.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And if he just went for you, he would
[1:37:35] have done it all.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; He would have done it all just for you.
[1:37:38] I mean, that's how much value he's put
[1:37:40] on you.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, friends, I think we
[1:37:44] should we shouldn't have a negative
[1:37:45] opinion of ourselves. Remember, he did
[1:37:47] not save us just to kick us off to one
[1:37:49] side. Remember, this message is a
[1:37:50] bridegroom call. Brother Ram said the
[1:37:53] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:37:54] this. It's an individual invitation and
[1:37:56] to become one with our Lord Jesus
[1:37:58] Christ. Amen. So he didn't save you just
[1:38:00] to throw you off on one side. No, he
[1:38:02] saved you to keep you. Amen. He called
[1:38:05] you to take you all the way. He hasn't
[1:38:06] brought you just halfway. And you know,
[1:38:08] God never starts a project he can't
[1:38:10] finish.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; You we are his workmanship.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; We are his project. Amen. He does not
[1:38:16] stop halfway and say, "I just can't work
[1:38:18] with this guy." He set in his ways and
[1:38:21] oh, you know, he just wants to stay in
[1:38:23] his comfort zone all the time and I just
[1:38:24] can't work with him. God never has that
[1:38:26] attitude.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; God can't think a new thought about you
[1:38:30] or anything.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he thought of you before the
[1:38:34] foundation, well, that's why he said to
[1:38:35] Job, "Listen, Job, you're so caught up
[1:38:37] in the bad skin. You're sitting here
[1:38:40] wondering what's going on in this
[1:38:42] defeat, questioning, defending yourself,
[1:38:46] all these things." And then God comes to
[1:38:48] him after Eloh comes along. And Eloh
[1:38:50] actually means in the Hebrew means the
[1:38:51] God of him.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Who and who who's the subject of the
[1:38:55] book? Job. So Job's God comes in flesh
[1:38:57] and talks to him.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and then and then and
[1:39:00] then Eloh was actually angry at Job
[1:39:02] because Job was justifying himself in
[1:39:04] the trial instead of justifying God. And
[1:39:07] what happens in but in the beginning of
[1:39:08] the book when his own wife, you know,
[1:39:10] Job's wife says to him, listen, just
[1:39:12] curse God and die. and and Job says to
[1:39:15] no, the Lord gives the Lord takes away.
[1:39:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So at
[1:39:18] the beginning of the trial, he justifies
[1:39:19] God. But then when his three friends
[1:39:21] come along and basically say, "Listen,
[1:39:23] Job, this is you, man. That's been
[1:39:26] exposed. Look, you're a sinner. This is
[1:39:27] why this has happened to you, Job." You
[1:39:29] know, he begins to justify himself in
[1:39:31] the trial. And how often do we get to a
[1:39:33] point where we're justifying the bad
[1:39:35] skin
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; instead of justifying God?
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; God's in control.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he loved me in the before the
[1:39:42] foundation world, he still loves me. And
[1:39:44] nothing I can do in this plane of
[1:39:45] existence can change his thought towards
[1:39:47] me.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he has the thoughts
[1:39:49] towards me of peace. I'll come to my
[1:39:51] expected end. What's that expected end?
[1:39:53] In a glorified body in eternity. That's
[1:39:55] my expected end. Amen. So he can't
[1:39:58] change his mind about me. Is this okay
[1:40:00] this morning? Have you got to think? If
[1:40:02] God loves you, I'm love. If he loves me,
[1:40:03] I'm loved. If I'm accepted in the
[1:40:05] beloved, I'm accepted.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Hey. Oh, but you know me and I've got
[1:40:10] these flaws and this humanity and
[1:40:11] criticizing and all, you know, all these
[1:40:14] things. Why do we look at the badge of
[1:40:15] skin?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; We're eternal. We're eternal beings.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Having a earthly experience. We're
[1:40:23] just coming through this dark room to be
[1:40:25] developed like a film.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Right. But it's not about your humanity.
[1:40:30] See, many people they wrestle with,
[1:40:31] well, God could never save me and you
[1:40:33] know, because I've done too much wrong
[1:40:34] and all these things. We've all done
[1:40:36] wrong.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I was running from God at university
[1:40:41] making homebrew, partying it up.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I was in the pub. A voice would say to
[1:40:46] me, "What are you doing?" I knew it was
[1:40:47] God. I didn't want to answer him.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Serious.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz I knew who was calling me.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to answer him.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; I know what it's like to be lost. And I
[1:40:59] know what it's like for God to get you
[1:41:00] to a point where you have no more
[1:41:01] excuse.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz so many people have excuses
[1:41:04] because of the badger skin.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; No. God God looks far beyond this th
[1:41:09] this guy.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why why why use the bad skin as
[1:41:14] an excuse why we can't serve God? We
[1:41:16] should actually look at God and he gives
[1:41:18] us all the reasons why we can. Amen.
[1:41:20] Like brother says, when the Holy Ghost
[1:41:21] comes, he takes all the cans out.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I can't overcome. I can't have victory.
[1:41:26] I can't have peace. I can't have joy.
[1:41:27] Holy Ghost comes and takes all the cans
[1:41:29] away. I can because he given it to me.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you deserve it? No. But
[1:41:33] as like brother would say, no. I aired
[1:41:35] it.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; We are joint ears with Christ. So I've
[1:41:38] added joy. I've added peace. Did you
[1:41:40] earn it? No. Did you work for it? No. I
[1:41:42] just it. He gave it to me.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's all mine.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; You know, isn't it, you know, I find it
[1:41:49] interesting if I was say Elon Musk right
[1:41:51] now and I had, look, here's my entire
[1:41:53] fortune in my hand. Who wants it?
[1:41:57] I tell you what, there'd be a lot of
[1:41:58] uncchristian behavior going on.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Let's be honest, okay? and and I say
[1:42:05] only one person can have it. You can't
[1:42:06] share it.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; There'd be some uncchristian behavior
[1:42:08] going on.
[1:42:10] But then if God says, "Look, here's full
[1:42:13] restoration.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Here's salvation.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Here's here's here's here's peace that
[1:42:19] takes away all your guilt.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; I've taken your shame, your guilt, your
[1:42:22] pain, your hurt. I'm going to give you
[1:42:24] joy and love and peace and and and a
[1:42:29] stable walk and a true identity." And
[1:42:31] yet we seem to wrestle with, oh, would
[1:42:33] he really give it to me?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; There's always this what?
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; But it's the same. He's given it without
[1:42:40] money or price.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; So why is there a hesitancy? Oh, can I
[1:42:43] really?
[1:42:45] We must. Friends,
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; this message has come to you that you
[1:42:51] would know all of heaven is is yours.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You are a son or daughter of God.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; He can't lose one of his. Okay. You are
[1:42:59] I've gone way off my notes but I don't
[1:43:01] think it matters. Amen. We are his
[1:43:03] children and he cannot lose one of his.
[1:43:07] And he will not put us to shame. Amen.
[1:43:09] He will be glorified in our lives. He
[1:43:11] will prove his word.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is not ashamed of you. He's not
[1:43:16] ashame in your worst moment. He's not
[1:43:18] ashamed of you. Amen. When you are
[1:43:20] ashamed of yourself, he's not ashamed of
[1:43:22] you. He is proud of you. Amen. You are
[1:43:24] his greatest achievement in existence is
[1:43:26] you. Oh, with my bad skin flaws.
[1:43:29] Absolutely.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of you.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; He's not like, you know, the devil comes
[1:43:34] up before him cuz the accuser still has
[1:43:36] some access. It's going to come to an
[1:43:38] end soon,
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; you know. And he doesn't say, oh, have
[1:43:41] you considered these guys but not this
[1:43:43] person, you know, try and like cover you
[1:43:45] up, you know? You know, like, oh no,
[1:43:47] don't look here, devil. No. Have you
[1:43:49] considered my servant? Actually, more
[1:43:50] than a servant. Have you considered my
[1:43:52] bride?
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; She's part of me. She's bone of my bone,
[1:43:56] flesh of my flesh, life of my life. She
[1:43:57] is me.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed. He's proud of you.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They love me. Amen. They
[1:44:05] gave their free will over to me because
[1:44:07] they they willingly have given their
[1:44:09] lives. They willingly say, "Lord, I want
[1:44:11] to serve you, Lord." They Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] You have been He has been looking for
[1:44:16] you.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we okay this morning? This is
[1:44:21] probably very elementary, but let's but
[1:44:22] you got to realize see we wrestle with
[1:44:24] the skin.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Let's go beyond the skin.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Let's go beyond. No, no. There's a gene
[1:44:28] seed of election.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the foundation, well, God
[1:44:32] deposited in you.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think we should have very
[1:44:38] high self-esteem, not pride. Remember,
[1:44:41] the more I think brother Dean or brother
[1:44:42] Adrian was saying it there last night,
[1:44:44] you know, the more the Lord reveals, it
[1:44:46] just makes a greater awe.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation doesn't make a proud
[1:44:50] spirit. Doesn't make anyone arrogant. It
[1:44:51] just makes us more humble and thankful
[1:44:53] and Lord you're so because remember the
[1:44:55] Lord is sovereign in his giving of
[1:44:56] revelation.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so he will give you it
[1:44:59] all. He may give someone on the street
[1:45:00] just a little bit cuz God has different
[1:45:03] people in his economy, right? But aren't
[1:45:04] you so privileged? I'm so glad you think
[1:45:08] about this. I'm so glad I'm not like
[1:45:10] like Luther was. Sure, that was God in
[1:45:12] his day, you know, but smoking a pipe,
[1:45:15] drinking beer, hating the juice. Yeah,
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; he had a little bit of light and that
[1:45:19] was God's sovereign choosing. And people
[1:45:21] can be in that same condition in this
[1:45:23] day, be justified by faith,
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; right? I'm glad I'm not in that
[1:45:29] condition.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I'm so and I'm not looking down on those
[1:45:32] people. You must understand, I'm sure
[1:45:34] you know my heart, right? But I'm so
[1:45:35] thankful the Lord would actually take me
[1:45:37] from that and cleanse me and fill me
[1:45:40] with his presence. Amen. that I know him
[1:45:42] in the power of his resurrection that
[1:45:44] when I look at the book of Acts and God
[1:45:46] coming and dwelling in them, I can say,
[1:45:48] "Lord, I've had that same kind of
[1:45:50] experience where the word is put on
[1:45:52] flesh again."
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; God is God said, "Look, I'm going to I'm
[1:45:58] going to take the back part of my mind.
[1:45:59] I'm going to share my heart with you.
[1:46:00] I'm going to share love secrets with
[1:46:02] you." Amen. That the world will never
[1:46:04] see, but I'm going to tell it all to
[1:46:05] you. I'm going to hold nothing back.
[1:46:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful for that. Now,
[1:46:12] we got to see where we're going here.
[1:46:15] Praise the Lord. There's the tabernacle.
[1:46:17] It's the It's the flesh will be changed,
[1:46:18] but the Almighty dwelt in that tent.
[1:46:21] Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see, it's
[1:46:24] always been the problem. If thou be the
[1:46:26] son of God. See, the devil isn't even
[1:46:28] sure about you.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; If thou be the bride of Christ, do this.
[1:46:32] Prove it by your life. Prove it by what
[1:46:34] you do. We aren't here to clown for
[1:46:36] Satan.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; You know, we're not here to follow his
[1:46:39] leadership.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if you really are redeemed,
[1:46:41] would do this and do this and do this. I
[1:46:43] don't have to listen to him.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't follow his leadership in
[1:46:47] the wilderness. Why should we follow
[1:46:48] him? We don't have to prove anything.
[1:46:51] Our husband has proved it all. Our
[1:46:53] headship, which is Christ, has proved it
[1:46:55] all. Amen. He conquered hell, death, and
[1:46:57] the grave. And he's the one who actually
[1:46:58] proves his word through us.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so glad for this.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see even even Jesus when he
[1:47:09] would be asked you know that you know
[1:47:10] they tempted him about taxes and all
[1:47:12] these things and you know Jesus was said
[1:47:14] give me a penny whose image is this and
[1:47:17] they could identify a bad drawn image of
[1:47:21] Caesar on a coin but it was the image of
[1:47:24] the invisible God holding the coin
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't identify God in flesh.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but what about you and I now
[1:47:32] when we look at one another? Cuz we
[1:47:35] should be able to identify the word made
[1:47:37] flesh in our midst.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Oh, yeah. That was in Brother
[1:47:40] Barham's day. No, it's in the bride.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That same God, that same mighty
[1:47:45] angel is veiled in a multi-membered
[1:47:47] bride.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in He's in you and I. If you
[1:47:50] say the Holy Ghost is in you, that
[1:47:51] mighty angel Christ unveiled is in you.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's He's now behind these bad
[1:47:57] skins. So, can we discern?
[1:48:00] Can we discern now in one another? Can
[1:48:03] we look beyond the badger skin? Because
[1:48:05] the more we spend time with each other,
[1:48:06] the more we see badger skin.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The more we see quirks and you
[1:48:11] know, we get caught up in, oh well, oh
[1:48:13] well, I can't believe you did that and I
[1:48:14] can't believe she did that and they're
[1:48:16] not knowing what they're doing. You
[1:48:17] know, it's like we never ever I don't
[1:48:19] know anyone I I I trust I Well, if
[1:48:21] you're like this, we can pray. But I've
[1:48:24] never met anyone who wakes up in the
[1:48:26] morning say, "I'm going to offend that
[1:48:27] brother today.
[1:48:29] I've never met I don't mean as a joke
[1:48:31] but you really you know who wakes up
[1:48:32] with that kind of plan oh boy we have
[1:48:34] fun at lunch today sister so and so is
[1:48:37] really going to get no one's like that
[1:48:39] but it's our humanity we can offend one
[1:48:41] another without even meaning it but it's
[1:48:43] cuz it's bad your skins right but can we
[1:48:45] look beyond
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; that humanity to say no there's deity
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; the same God in me is in you amen the
[1:48:53] same Christ who made how uh who made all
[1:48:56] things dwells in you and I can we look
[1:48:58] beyond on this thing
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; and identify the word.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; In one another.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to find this here.
[1:49:10] Let's just go for it. We We'll come back
[1:49:12] to this. This is why I I make slides,
[1:49:15] but I shouldn't because I always just
[1:49:18] jump around too much. Anyway, it says
[1:49:20] here, oh, here this one. No, I can't see
[1:49:25] what's next. But anyway, how the Lord
[1:49:26] says about Peter would say know Paul
[1:49:28] would say about communion. Many are sick
[1:49:30] or weak among you or sleep because they
[1:49:31] do not discern the Lord's body. Right?
[1:49:34] It's not about the communion. That's not
[1:49:36] the Lord's body. That's a symbol of the
[1:49:38] Lord's body. Right? But what are they
[1:49:40] not discerning? The Lord's body.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; There's sickness and people are dead
[1:49:45] because we don't discern the Lord's
[1:49:47] body. Can we discern the Lord? It's not
[1:49:49] up there. But you know, can we discern
[1:49:50] one another? Say, "Listen, I see Jesus
[1:49:52] in that person. I see Jesus in that
[1:49:54] young person. I see Jesus in that old
[1:49:56] person. Can we can we look beyond these
[1:49:59] things and see him?
[1:50:04] And he says, "And what agreement has the
[1:50:06] temple of God with idols? For ye are the
[1:50:08] temple of the living God, as God has
[1:50:10] said, I will dwell in them and walk in
[1:50:11] them. I will be their God, and they
[1:50:12] shall be my people. Wherefore come out
[1:50:14] from among them, and be ye separate,
[1:50:16] sayeth the Lord, and touch not the
[1:50:17] unclean thing, I'll receive you, and
[1:50:19] will be a father unto you, and you shall
[1:50:20] be my sons and daughters, saith the
[1:50:23] Almighty. I'm going to dwell in them and
[1:50:25] walk in them.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; You get up in the morning, who gets up
[1:50:28] in the morning? Jesus gets up in the
[1:50:30] morning.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; You brush your teeth. Who's brushing
[1:50:33] teeth? Jesus is brushing teeth. You go
[1:50:35] to school, who goes to school? You go to
[1:50:37] work, who's going to work?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus is going to work.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm labor. I just I just pray
[1:50:44] these things sink in more. Especially
[1:50:45] for myself. You know,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to dwell in them
[1:50:48] and walk in them."
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; So when you go to a place, you could
[1:50:51] say, "The Lord Jesus Christ has stepped
[1:50:53] into the building."
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave thee nor
[1:50:57] forsake thee. I'll be with you and in
[1:50:58] you to the end of the world." Amen. Not
[1:51:01] a lesser thing. No. But supreme deity,
[1:51:04] amen, dwells in you and I. Amen. It's
[1:51:06] not just a religious spirit that's come
[1:51:08] into us. It's the Lord God Almighty.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:13] Amen. I'll come back to this here. He
[1:51:15] says, "And now the glory of God is
[1:51:16] behind your skin." That's right. And the
[1:51:18] traditions don't see it. It's inside
[1:51:20] it's inside the veil where his word was.
[1:51:22] What was on the inside of that skin back
[1:51:24] there, the old badger skins, which there
[1:51:25] was no beauty that we should desire it.
[1:51:27] And when it was made flesh and dwelt
[1:51:29] among us, it was still no beauty that we
[1:51:31] should desire it. And now the same thing
[1:51:33] is today. There's nothing in a man or
[1:51:34] woman that can be desired. Uh it's
[1:51:36] what's in behind there. That's what it
[1:51:38] is. Well, you say that fellow I know he
[1:51:40] used to be a drunkard. He used to do
[1:51:42] this. I don't care what he used to do.
[1:51:43] What's hid behind that skin? So it
[1:51:45] doesn't matter what you used to be. What
[1:51:47] are you now? Amen. What are if you look
[1:51:50] at your life now and you were 5 years
[1:51:51] ago, what are you? Are you closer to the
[1:51:54] Lord, more humble,
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; more like him, more thankful, going from
[1:51:58] glory to glory. I mean, God is doing a
[1:52:00] work. Amen. So it's not about what we
[1:52:02] used to be. I think many times we look
[1:52:04] at people and and we've taken a photo of
[1:52:06] them in our mind and it was million
[1:52:09] years ago. Who cares when it was, you
[1:52:10] know, like Jurassic period kind of ages
[1:52:12] ago. No one even remembers what you
[1:52:14] remember, but you've got the still frame
[1:52:15] of a person. Oh, that brother I
[1:52:17] remember.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; They have changed.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Have you changed?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; They've changed.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Have they grown? You've grown.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; So why do we keep a photo of someone and
[1:52:28] we're always looking through that filter
[1:52:29] at one another? Why can't we allow that
[1:52:31] we've grown in grace and they have too?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's behind there. That's
[1:52:38] what counts. See, the people is blinded.
[1:52:40] The skin blinds the people. See, they
[1:52:42] say, "I remember when that woman used
[1:52:44] to. I know what she used to. And what
[1:52:45] about now?" See, them skins that was
[1:52:47] once on a badge and now is hiding the
[1:52:49] glory of God. Got it housed behind it.
[1:52:51] It was an animal, but now it's housing
[1:52:53] the glory of God. And so, can your skin
[1:52:55] be changed tonight to be made a housing
[1:52:57] place for God? God dwelling in humanity.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Moses was a murderer.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Not even an attempted murderer. He
[1:53:06] really killed a guy. That's right.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; And yet the Lord used him. God didn't
[1:53:10] change his mind about Moses.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; He miserably failed
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; backside of the desert made a real small
[1:53:16] comfort zone of a life for 40 years. I'm
[1:53:18] just a shepherd. I'm a midian. This is,
[1:53:20] you know, and he just pulled his comfort
[1:53:21] zone and real small and basically forgot
[1:53:24] about the promise of God. God didn't
[1:53:26] forget that Moses had to fulfill his
[1:53:27] word. Many times we all, especially when
[1:53:29] we get older, what do we do? We build a
[1:53:31] very small comfort zone of life. Because
[1:53:34] when we're young, it's our parents that
[1:53:35] push us out into a bigger comfort zone.
[1:53:38] Play this sport. Try this. You're going
[1:53:39] to school here. You know, all these
[1:53:40] things are out of our control. But then
[1:53:42] when we get older, we can choose. Are we
[1:53:44] going to make our comfort zone bigger or
[1:53:45] smaller? And normally humans make their
[1:53:47] comfort zone smaller. Circle of friends
[1:53:49] gets smaller. Hobbies get less. Become a
[1:53:51] creature of habit. And our comfort zone
[1:53:53] gets smaller and smaller and smaller and
[1:53:55] we're comfortable in it.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; So to get out of that comfort zone, you
[1:53:58] got to become uncomfortable.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Right? And then it grows. And what does
[1:54:02] God want us to do? He doesn't want us in
[1:54:03] a small comfort zone. He doesn't want
[1:54:05] our life to be very limited in different
[1:54:07] things that we do. He wants us to go
[1:54:10] beyond our comfort zone.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That God can live through us
[1:54:13] because when we come to our point where
[1:54:15] we know, Lord, we can't do this, then he
[1:54:17] can step in
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; and take over.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses comfort zone was very
[1:54:22] small, but he wanted but God wanted to
[1:54:24] be veiled behind that badge of skin. So,
[1:54:27] he had to leave all that he knew there,
[1:54:28] go down to Egypt, and fulfill the
[1:54:30] promise that was allotted to him to
[1:54:32] fulfill. It's the same thing with us.
[1:54:35] Praise God. I'm glad God stirs the nest.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; We get comfortable, got it laid out,
[1:54:41] everything's just fine, and God says,
[1:54:42] "No,
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to change this."
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Trust is okay.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Apostle Paul, no, we'll go
[1:54:51] here rather. Because you got to realize,
[1:54:53] you say, well, I've just got to see
[1:54:55] brother Brown would make this statement.
[1:54:56] And he said if you take a teaspoon and
[1:54:58] you dip it in the ocean, he says all the
[1:55:00] all the chemicals, all the potentials,
[1:55:02] everything that the ocean's made of is
[1:55:04] in that spoon.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Right? So it doesn't become less of the
[1:55:08] ocean just cuz it's in a spoon, right?
[1:55:10] It's the same ocean. So you take the
[1:55:11] Pacific Ocean or Tasman Sea, whatever's
[1:55:14] here, you know, it's a if I had in a
[1:55:16] bottle, I'd say this is the Tasmin Sea.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You'd say, "No, it's water in the water
[1:55:20] in a bottle." No, it's not. It's the
[1:55:22] Tasmin Sea. It's just in a different
[1:55:24] vessel.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I so so if I took it to the
[1:55:27] lab and analyzed it, all the nutrients,
[1:55:29] the chemicals, the minerals, whatever,
[1:55:30] whatever are in here, right? It's just
[1:55:32] in a different vessel. And what has God
[1:55:34] done? That big fountain of eternal life
[1:55:36] has poured himself into you. He doesn't
[1:55:38] become less because he's now in a
[1:55:40] different skin under a different veil.
[1:55:42] It's exactly the same. Exactly. In
[1:55:44] power, ability, amen, strength, amen,
[1:55:48] everything that he is, perseverance,
[1:55:50] amen, zeal, love, amen, compassion, all
[1:55:52] that he is is now in you. Amen. He
[1:55:55] doesn't become less in any way. He's
[1:55:57] equally the same in you as he is in
[1:55:59] heaven.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if now if he is that one and
[1:56:03] he's overcome all things now, then what
[1:56:05] can stop us?
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; What can stop us this morning? Would it
[1:56:09] can our comfort zone stop us? Absolutely
[1:56:12] not. Can a complex stop us? Absolutely
[1:56:14] not. If the one who conquered all things
[1:56:16] is in you and I, then nothing nothing
[1:56:18] can stop him. He's unstoppable. Amen.
[1:56:21] He's the unstoppable God. So if he's
[1:56:23] unstoppable and the unstoppable one is
[1:56:25] in you, then what can stop him?
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, my past and this is what I've gone
[1:56:31] through. You know, the Lord allows you
[1:56:32] to go through things.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; God uses wounds
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; God uses wounds that he can manifest
[1:56:41] through those wounds. Amen. Just like
[1:56:44] what he died on Calvary, he was wounded
[1:56:45] more than any other man. God used those
[1:56:47] wounds that eternal life would be
[1:56:49] released upon the earth. But what
[1:56:52] happens is the devil wants to use the
[1:56:53] same wounds to bring us into a little
[1:56:56] shell
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't he he hates it when
[1:57:00] God manifests himself. He knows how God
[1:57:02] works, right? But God allows wounds to
[1:57:04] come in that he wants to prove himself.
[1:57:07] Look at Job.
[1:57:09] He was wounded.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; He lost his children. He lost everything
[1:57:13] except for his health. What a massive
[1:57:15] wound. God allowed that
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; because God wanted Job to know, "Job,
[1:57:21] where were you?" He wanted to ask him a
[1:57:23] question.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Job, where were you? Before the
[1:57:26] foundation of the world.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; What a question. When the morning stars
[1:57:29] shouted for joy and all these things,
[1:57:31] and he allowed him to come on that ash
[1:57:34] heap with those wounds, not because God
[1:57:36] was displeased with Job. I know you know
[1:57:38] these things. Let's just go through it
[1:57:39] one more time. God was not unhappy with
[1:57:42] Job. When he said he's a perfect man to
[1:57:44] his enemy, he wasn't lying. He wasn't
[1:57:46] embellishing. It was just how it was.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Job is a perfect And there's Job sitting
[1:57:50] there with his fear.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Remember, he would sacrifice on behalf
[1:57:54] of his children every morning because he
[1:57:55] was afraid they would sit in their
[1:57:57] minds. He was actually operating out of
[1:57:59] fear, though it was according to the
[1:58:01] word.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, here's Job sitting there with
[1:58:04] his fears, his worries. What's going to
[1:58:06] happen to my children? They're adults
[1:58:07] down there doing this and this and he
[1:58:08] would and he would intercede on their
[1:58:10] behalf like any father should, right?
[1:58:12] But he's living there with his fears. He
[1:58:13] says, "The fear that I had has come upon
[1:58:15] me." Who's read that in the book of Job?
[1:58:18] Right? So there he was. But when God
[1:58:19] looked at me as a perfect man.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because God was looking
[1:58:23] through the blood of the lamb that God
[1:58:25] instituted for him to offer. Amen. For
[1:58:27] himself and his family.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; We have more than a blood of a natural
[1:58:32] lamb, friends.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when God looks at you, he said,
[1:58:35] "No, you're perfect. You're more than a
[1:58:37] servant. You're a perfect bride." Amen.
[1:58:39] But there's but then but then he but Job
[1:58:41] has these questions. Well, I see
[1:58:43] flowers, they die, they come forth,
[1:58:44] trees, you know, he saw the resurrection
[1:58:46] and botney life. But a man, he dies.
[1:58:48] Where does he go?
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; God allowed wounds to come in.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; That then Job could stand and say, now I
[1:58:53] know my redeemer liveth.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; God allowed those wounds cuz God wanted
[1:58:58] to reveal to him, "This is where you're
[1:59:00] going, Job. This is where you were."
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Where were you, Job? Dancing, shouting
[1:59:05] before the foundation of the world. So,
[1:59:07] Job, this ash heap you're on right now,
[1:59:10] this ain't how I thought of you.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I thought of you a certain way. You're
[1:59:14] going to end up that way.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw us shouting and rejoicing.
[1:59:18] We're going to end up like that.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so God allowed those
[1:59:23] wounds to bring him to that place. You
[1:59:25] think of Esther in the Bible, Esther had
[1:59:27] a lot of wounds.
[1:59:29] Okay.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Esther would Esther was an orphan.
[1:59:35] I I I grew up with both parents and my
[1:59:37] mom's um mom's parents and my great
[1:59:39] uncle next to us growing up next door in
[1:59:42] Gisbon. I had a wonderful childhood. So
[1:59:44] I don't know what it's like to have a
[1:59:46] wound of not having a parent or both
[1:59:48] parents, right? We know God is father to
[1:59:50] the fatherless, right? So he can heal
[1:59:52] all those wounds.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; But then if you but then you go back
[1:59:54] further, look at the things that God
[1:59:57] allowed for Esther to get to the throne.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; He allowed a split to come into the
[2:00:02] kingdom. He allowed He allowed the son
[2:00:03] of Solomon to be risen up in pride and
[2:00:06] say that my my father you chastise you
[2:00:09] with whips. I'm going to chastise you
[2:00:10] with scorpions. I'm going to put the
[2:00:11] burden greater on you. Cause the split
[2:00:13] to come into the kingdom. Amen. Cause re
[2:00:16] Jeroboam to build those two golden
[2:00:17] calves. There's a domino effect, a
[2:00:20] ripple effect to get Esther on the
[2:00:21] throne. There's a reason Esther had to
[2:00:23] get on the throne. I'm going to probably
[2:00:24] close with this thought. Okay, so there
[2:00:26] so so there there they are there, you
[2:00:28] know, you the two golden calves are
[2:00:30] made. Idolatry comes into Israel.
[2:00:32] Nebuchadnezzar come, different ones come
[2:00:33] along. And now Israel's scattered. And
[2:00:36] now she finds herself an orphan girl
[2:00:39] living in Shushan. Didn't go back to
[2:00:41] Jerusalem. Had no parents, was there
[2:00:42] with Mori. She's living there with these
[2:00:44] wounds. There's a re there must been
[2:00:47] some reason why she wasn't married.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; You know, there must have been a reason
[2:00:52] why, you know, because you look at this
[2:00:53] is her life.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; This is a real person. Had real pain,
[2:00:57] had real wounds. But God allowed the
[2:01:00] wounds because God had to get her into a
[2:01:01] position because there was unfinished
[2:01:04] business with the enemy. Amen. That had
[2:01:06] to be dealt with because we know Hmon
[2:01:08] was an Agite who was an Amalachite,
[2:01:11] right? Cuz King Aad was the king of the
[2:01:12] Amalachites, the ancient enemy of the
[2:01:14] Jews. And what happened was King Saul
[2:01:17] could not do the job that God told him
[2:01:19] to do. There were these Amalachites
[2:01:22] running around that had to be dealt
[2:01:23] with. Amen. So what happens is now King
[2:01:25] Saul both Saul, Mori and Esther were
[2:01:28] from the tribe of Benjamin.
[2:01:30] So there was God would God would allow
[2:01:32] someone to fail. Well Saul failed from
[2:01:35] the tribe of Benjamin. God would raise
[2:01:37] up two people from that same lineage to
[2:01:40] undo and to break and to bring an end to
[2:01:42] what their forebe could not do. Amen.
[2:01:45] It's the same thing with you and I
[2:01:46] friends. There's things in our lineages
[2:01:47] that we're not proud of.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; There's family spirits. There's traits.
[2:01:51] There's things of unforgiveness or
[2:01:53] bitterness or irreverence or
[2:01:55] stubbornness or alcohol, you know, um,
[2:01:58] adultery, whatever it may be, being
[2:02:00] passed down through. But there's got to
[2:02:02] come a person raise up that's going to
[2:02:04] break that thing. Amen. And I believe
[2:02:06] I'm looking at those kind of people this
[2:02:08] morning. It doesn't matter what your
[2:02:10] natural lineage has been down through.
[2:02:12] God says, I'm going to break that cycle.
[2:02:13] I mean, I'm going to raise up a believer
[2:02:15] in that lineage to prove to Satan,
[2:02:17] Satan, you've injected a lot of things
[2:02:18] in these people, but my blood, my power,
[2:02:21] my Holy Ghost is far greater than
[2:02:23] anything you have done. Any scar, any
[2:02:25] wound, I'm far greater. I'm going to
[2:02:26] bring a I'm going to bring a victory
[2:02:28] through those things.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, there's Esther now.
[2:02:31] She's got all these wounds. They they
[2:02:33] cause her to be in shusha and they cause
[2:02:34] her to be unmarried. And then she finds
[2:02:37] herself finding grace in the sight of
[2:02:39] the king.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; She didn't earn it. She just asked,
[2:02:41] "Haggy, haggi, I've got no idea what I'm
[2:02:43] doing. I'm way out of my depth here. How
[2:02:45] do I dress? What should I do?" Same
[2:02:47] thing with us. We realize this is great
[2:02:49] God of heaven and earth. And we realize,
[2:02:51] man, how do I approach this guy? If I
[2:02:53] can put it that sorry, you know, but you
[2:02:55] know, like, Lord, how can I how can I
[2:02:57] walk with you, Lord? This great holy
[2:02:58] God. What did he do? He sent he sent
[2:03:00] brother. He sent Haggi to us. Showed us
[2:03:03] the heart of the king.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; And then and then what? She found grace
[2:03:06] in the sight of King of Hazerus. We
[2:03:07] found grace in the sight of God. And
[2:03:09] then now finally here here is here is
[2:03:12] Esther and she knows that Hmon is the
[2:03:15] ancient enemy of her people. And this is
[2:03:18] what I love about the message. It
[2:03:19] reveals who God is. It reveals who you
[2:03:21] are and it reveals your enemy.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like brother Ram says when
[2:03:25] the seals come open, it just exposes
[2:03:27] Satan.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now here is here is here is
[2:03:31] Esther and she's carrying she's got
[2:03:32] these wounds. She's got this badge of
[2:03:34] skin that she's dealing with. You know,
[2:03:36] even even when she goes to the palace,
[2:03:38] she's told, "Don't even don't even say
[2:03:40] your name is Hadassa.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; You're Esther. Take on a Persian name,
[2:03:45] star rising." You know, and uh but but
[2:03:47] there she is. But she's carrying a
[2:03:49] secret. I know who I am.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; I know who the enemy is.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; And I know who the king is.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here she is. These wounds
[2:03:58] brought her into that position of power
[2:04:00] and authority.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Right? And then what does she do? She
[2:04:02] knows that in her lays the secret of
[2:04:05] actually salvation for her people. I
[2:04:07] mean, she has access to the king that
[2:04:09] no, no, no one else has.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; You're in the story. You see, you're
[2:04:14] you're Esther in the You're a greater
[2:04:15] Esther than she was. She was pointing to
[2:04:18] you. I mean, God has placed you in a
[2:04:20] position of authority and power. Amen.
[2:04:22] God has made you one with him. Amen. You
[2:04:25] are part of him. Are we not? Are we not
[2:04:26] the feminist part of God?
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; If I say it that way. Your God is God
[2:04:30] has made you a certain way. wounds have
[2:04:32] come in to allow you to get to this
[2:04:34] place. And then now what does she do?
[2:04:35] She has the banquet of wines. The first
[2:04:38] one, hallelujah. God loves worship. God
[2:04:41] loves a stimulation of revelation of the
[2:04:43] word. It moves his heart. Amen. To see a
[2:04:45] people not responding mechanically or
[2:04:47] this is expected of him. But this is a
[2:04:49] love comes out as a response. Amen. For
[2:04:51] what God has poured in. Amen. And what
[2:04:53] does it do? It makes the king restless.
[2:04:56] I don't think there's any record of in
[2:04:57] your in the book of Esther where the
[2:04:58] king can't sleep until after that first
[2:05:01] banquet of wines and he can't sleep. He
[2:05:03] says, "Now give me the records of the
[2:05:04] kingdom." So now what happens is is is
[2:05:06] is is a record that was sealed up, you
[2:05:10] know, is opened and a particular place
[2:05:13] was found that records what Mori did to
[2:05:15] save the king's life. Amen. You say the
[2:05:17] seals came off the book. Amen. And now
[2:05:20] what happens is when the book comes
[2:05:21] open, there's now a role reversal. Amen.
[2:05:24] Because before the book came open, amen
[2:05:26] mean the Jews, Esther, um, Mori, they're
[2:05:28] under a death sentence.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; By Hmon, they're living under a death
[2:05:32] sentence. But now when the book came
[2:05:34] open, it's actually a total reverser of
[2:05:36] roles. Cuz now Hmon is coming under a
[2:05:38] death sentence. Amen. Because the king's
[2:05:40] heart has been moved. Amen. Cuz why? A
[2:05:42] woman who has wounds is not worried
[2:05:44] about her bad skin, but knows her
[2:05:45] position. Amen. Comes in before the king
[2:05:47] and has this banquet of wines and moves
[2:05:49] the heart of the king. And then she has
[2:05:51] a second banquet. And then now what
[2:05:53] happens? There's a question.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; What can I do for you?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; What can I do for you, Esther? She's
[2:05:58] carrying a secret cuz even the king
[2:06:00] doesn't know who she is.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; And then she intercedes on behalf of her
[2:06:04] people. And what happens? The wrath of
[2:06:07] the king is turned against her enemy.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his own scheme is what
[2:06:13] he hung on.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. His own gallows he made hung
[2:06:17] himself. right now. I tell you what,
[2:06:19] friends, there's there's there's devices
[2:06:21] that have been put against our families
[2:06:23] and put against people, put against
[2:06:25] yourselves. But I tell you what,
[2:06:26] friends, no weapon formed against you
[2:06:28] shall prosper. Amen. No weapon is going
[2:06:30] to prosper against you. Amen. Every
[2:06:32] tongue that rise in judgment against
[2:06:33] you, thou shalt condemn. Amen. You've
[2:06:36] got to condemn the accuser's tongue.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to stand up and say,
[2:06:40] "No, I'm as righteous as God is
[2:06:42] righteous. I'm as spotless as God is
[2:06:44] spotless. I mean, I'm as sinless as God
[2:06:46] is sinless. Why? By your own
[2:06:47] flawlessness? No. But by his atonement,
[2:06:50] his atoning grace. Amen. His atoning
[2:06:52] blood. I'm as sinless as he is.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say that? Yeah, I can.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Because an atonement is what? You become
[2:06:59] at one. It's at onement.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you receive the baptism
[2:07:03] of the Holy Ghost, there's an at onement
[2:07:04] that takes place. Amen. You and you and
[2:07:06] God become one unit. Hallelujah.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, she intercedes for her family.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; He gets hung. And then now the signant
[2:07:15] ring that was on his finger gets placed
[2:07:17] on your finger. Amen. And now she writes
[2:07:20] a law that overshadows what the enemy
[2:07:23] has done.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they win a great victory. Not
[2:07:26] once but twice. Go read in the book of
[2:07:27] Esther.
[2:07:29] Hallelujah.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; If she could do that, she's pointing to
[2:07:33] you.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; She's pointing to you. Amen. Don't let
[2:07:36] wounds, don't let bad your skin, don't
[2:07:38] let any of these things or oh yes, it's
[2:07:40] just some some spirit in me that's less
[2:07:42] of God. No, it's all of God
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; is in the believer. Supreme deity
[2:07:46] doesn't just dwell in heaven. It dwells
[2:07:47] in you. Amen. So, what people ought we
[2:07:50] to be.
[2:07:52] Amen. Oh, I'm just a little person. No,
[2:07:55] no, you're a big person.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; You got a big daddy.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Your daddy can beat up all the daddies.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; He's God. Why do we Why do we shrink
[2:08:03] back? No. We're going to take God at his
[2:08:05] word. Yes, sir.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; She was fearless in what she had to do
[2:08:07] cuz she realized, well, if I perish, I
[2:08:08] perish. My life's not my own. Are we not
[2:08:11] in the same bracket? Our life is not our
[2:08:13] own.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why Why do we keep silent? We're
[2:08:16] so afraid God's going to get angry at us
[2:08:18] when he loves us with an unfailing love.
[2:08:20] Why don't we turn the wrath of God
[2:08:22] against some evil spirit that's been
[2:08:23] afflicting our family? Amen. Some some
[2:08:25] trouble that's plaguing us. Why don't we
[2:08:27] turn his wrath against our enemy? Amen.
[2:08:29] Well, how do you do that? Create an
[2:08:30] atmosphere around you. Let the Holy
[2:08:32] Ghost because he's within us, right? But
[2:08:34] we're going to surrender this thing to
[2:08:36] him that he can come and take control.
[2:08:38] Why don't we let the Holy Ghost, that
[2:08:39] great presence of divine love flow out
[2:08:42] of our lives?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know you can impart eternal life?
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm ask you asked a question. I
[2:08:50] don't know where it is in here, but he
[2:08:51] says, you know, can a what's the greater
[2:08:53] works?
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; He says it's to impart eternal life. He
[2:08:57] says, can can you do it? He says, well,
[2:08:59] a son of God can
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; A son of God can impart eternal life.
[2:09:04] Well, how do I do that? Do I just go
[2:09:05] here and say he's eternal life?
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; No. You create an atmosphere around you.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; You create an atmosphere of the presence
[2:09:13] of God. Amen. Where where people come
[2:09:16] under the his influence, not your human
[2:09:18] influence, his influence. Amen. What
[2:09:20] happens then? They just drop right into
[2:09:21] it.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't do that. Jesus is the only
[2:09:27] Where is he?
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Where is he?
[2:09:30] What what vocal cords is he going to
[2:09:32] anoint
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; to speak to people?
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're waiting to hear from God and
[2:09:36] God's in you.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; What What are we afraid of? Or what
[2:09:40] might happen? Well, if it's God doing
[2:09:42] it, God will do it.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be afraid. But you can
[2:09:45] impart eternal life. That's why we have
[2:09:47] family altars. That's why we pray.
[2:09:48] That's why we have a loving disposition,
[2:09:51] right? That's why we're friendly.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we're kind. That's why we're
[2:09:55] thoughtful. That's why people when they
[2:09:57] see us, they say, "That person's a
[2:09:58] really nice person.
[2:10:00] Yep.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because what is that? It's actually
[2:10:03] an influence. You're praying, "Lord, may
[2:10:05] you now influence that person
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; that eternal life can be imparted."
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] Praise the Lord. I think I've just
[2:10:15] finished. Wait, let's see what else we
[2:10:17] got. I'm having fun now.
[2:10:23] He says here, "And if a man says he's
[2:10:25] born again," wait, let's just drop here.
[2:10:27] Jesus said in Mark 16, "These signs
[2:10:28] shall follow in the belief into all the
[2:10:30] world to every age, casting out demons,
[2:10:32] uh speaking with tongues and all these
[2:10:33] great manifestations, gifts that would
[2:10:35] follow. They shall, not they ought, they
[2:10:37] may, may be, they ought to, they will.
[2:10:39] And heaven and earth will pass away, his
[2:10:40] word won't." So, it's Christ expressing
[2:10:42] himself in the individual, whether he's
[2:10:43] intellectual or whether he doesn't know
[2:10:45] his ABCs. He says half the apostles
[2:10:47] didn't know it. That's right. But they
[2:10:49] know Christ. They never taken heed to
[2:10:51] Peter and John, knowing that they had
[2:10:52] been out of some seminary. They said
[2:10:54] they taken heed and notice that they had
[2:10:56] been with Christ. When they healed the
[2:10:58] lay man see at the gate they know that
[2:11:00] they had been with Christ. The new birth
[2:11:02] is Christ is a revelation. God has
[2:11:04] revealed to you this great mystery and
[2:11:05] that's the new birth. Now what are you
[2:11:07] going to do when you get all that
[2:11:09] grouped together? I mean where the
[2:11:10] revelation is perfect in harmony and God
[2:11:13] expressing it through his word by the
[2:11:14] same action same things that he did
[2:11:16] making the word manifest. Oh if the
[2:11:18] church only knew its position it will
[2:11:20] one day. Then the rapture will go when
[2:11:22] it knows what it is.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; I know you've probably heard these
[2:11:25] quotes over and over again, but I tell
[2:11:27] you what, friends, if we only knew our
[2:11:30] position.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; I believe we do,
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; but we let this thing
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; rob us of what God has placed us to be.
[2:11:38] I mean, what is this when you when you
[2:11:39] when they all get together that you that
[2:11:41] group get together, what does this
[2:11:42] revelation talking about? Christ in you,
[2:11:44] the hope of glory.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we let the Lord just take
[2:11:48] control in a greater way.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we let Lord flow through us
[2:11:51] Lord as I worship Lord may may you
[2:11:53] worship through me. When I say amen may
[2:11:56] be you amening your word Lord. I mean
[2:11:58] when the preacher stands there and
[2:11:59] preaches Lord may it just be him or
[2:12:00] maybe you through him completely. The
[2:12:02] song leader the musicians when we go
[2:12:04] into the street we talk to people. May
[2:12:06] it be a worship.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; I mean a a love and a joy that flows out
[2:12:10] of us. Doesn't matter what day we're
[2:12:12] going through. You know those things are
[2:12:13] irrelevant. We all have troubles and
[2:12:15] trials and all those things. But don't
[2:12:17] let that thing be the main focus in your
[2:12:19] life.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who do we worship? Do we worship
[2:12:22] our problems?
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; No. Some people, they let it affect them
[2:12:27] too much.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't bear we don't
[2:12:31] have ostrich faith. Ostriches bury their
[2:12:33] head in the sand, right? We don't bury
[2:12:35] our head in the sand and pretend there's
[2:12:36] no problems. We acknowledge these
[2:12:38] things. But brother Ram says that real
[2:12:40] overcoming is recognizing the one in you
[2:12:43] has already overcome. Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; He's already overcome.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we get this group together
[2:12:51] and and I believe this group is together
[2:12:54] where the Lord can manifest himself down
[2:12:56] through.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if we only knew our
[2:12:59] position, it will one day the rapture
[2:13:01] will go when it knows what it is.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; I just want to finish with this if I can
[2:13:08] find it. You say, "Well,
[2:13:14] You know, people people wrestle with
[2:13:17] people want to diminish the power of the
[2:13:18] blood. They want to diminish what Christ
[2:13:21] has done for us.
[2:13:24] Now, Paul, when he spoke about Levi
[2:13:26] paying tithes,
[2:13:28] he didn't say he figuratively paid
[2:13:30] tithes when he was in Abraham. He didn't
[2:13:32] say he was figuratively in Abraham,
[2:13:34] right? He said he was literally in
[2:13:37] Abraham
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; when when when Abraham paid tithes. And
[2:13:40] so what Abraham did was attributed to
[2:13:42] Levi.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; He's he literally said that le I'm just
[2:13:46] reading the scripture, but I don't know
[2:13:47] if you've read it this way. This dawned
[2:13:48] on me a while ago. I thought, "Praise
[2:13:50] God." Amen. So So Paul is literally
[2:13:52] saying when Abraham literally paid tithe
[2:13:54] to Melzdc, Levi was in him. And what
[2:13:57] Abraham did was attributed to Levi.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. So now when So everything that
[2:14:02] Abraham did there was attributed to
[2:14:03] Levi. Levi didn't even know where he
[2:14:05] was. He was he he wasn't even conscious
[2:14:08] of what was going on. But he was in
[2:14:10] Abraham and the deeds of Abraham were
[2:14:11] attributed to Levi. Okay? So now you
[2:14:13] take the deeds of Christ because we were
[2:14:15] in him, right? We were in him. So
[2:14:17] everything he did is attributed to us.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what did he do? He he turned
[2:14:22] down the devil's lie
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. He conquered hell,
[2:14:26] death, and the grave. Amen. He he he
[2:14:28] conquered culture. He conquered
[2:14:30] expectations. He conquered
[2:14:32] disappointments. He conquered rejection.
[2:14:34] He conquered all these things.
[2:14:36] Everything that can be named, he
[2:14:38] conquered. Amen. And then when he did
[2:14:39] that, because you were in him, it's
[2:14:41] attributed to you.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why, you know, you hear the
[2:14:47] word, you hear the gospel, and something
[2:14:48] says, "Yes, Lord. That's right. Why that
[2:14:51] recognition comes?" Because it's
[2:14:52] attributed to you cuz you're in him.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The book comes open. Amen. You
[2:14:56] realize Christ is here unveiled. You
[2:14:58] say, "Yes, Lord. That sounds so I've
[2:15:00] never heard a voice like this voice."
[2:15:02] Amen. What's happening is you're
[2:15:03] realizing that redemption is attributed
[2:15:06] to you.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:08] Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Not not not figuratively. No, literally.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Literally.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was in Christ when he was on
[2:15:18] Calvary. Oh, does that mean I paid for
[2:15:20] my sin? Absolutely not. He did it all,
[2:15:22] but I was in him. And so, what he did is
[2:15:23] attributed to me. And that's why we're
[2:15:25] joint ears.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, did you do it? I did nothing.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; He did it all because I'm part of him.
[2:15:31] It's attributed to me.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:35] Praise the Lord. If he conquered, see
[2:15:36] this why I say friends, if that great
[2:15:38] God is in you, what can hinder you?
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; What do we let hinder us?
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; See, we have a free moral agency. Do we
[2:15:47] let complexes hinder us?
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Do we let our past hinder us?
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Do we let shame or who am I or
[2:15:54] upbringing? Do we let these things
[2:15:56] hinder us or we say no, I can do all
[2:15:57] things through Christ Jesus which
[2:15:58] strengthens me.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Who do you let rule?
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just maybe finish with that
[2:16:03] question. If we we have the musicians
[2:16:05] this morning, I say tell you what,
[2:16:07] friends. If he's in you,
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop you.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing can stop you. The
[2:16:14] prince of God was brought, the ark was
[2:16:16] brought to the temple of Deeon,
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; that idol fell down on its face.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when those two anointings
[2:16:23] came into people,
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Goliath fell down on his face.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He fell down forward, not
[2:16:30] backward. Amen. showing that what God
[2:16:32] did in the temple of Deaeon when those
[2:16:34] two anointings became men.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That spirit fell down on its face.
[2:16:38] I tell you what, friends, greater than
[2:16:40] David is in you. Amen. The God of David
[2:16:43] is in you. Amen. I tell you what, you
[2:16:45] take this word. You say, "I've only got
[2:16:46] a slingshot." You don't even need a
[2:16:48] slingshot. Amen. You just take what
[2:16:50] you've got. I tell you've got more.
[2:16:52] You've got more than you realize. You're
[2:16:54] packing a weapon that made the world.
[2:16:56] Amen. You're packing a weapon that
[2:16:58] cannot be defeated. Amen. But God will
[2:17:00] you got to speak it across your lips in
[2:17:02] faith. Take God at his word. Confess his
[2:17:05] promises back to him. Amen. Then the
[2:17:07] high priest himself can can can can
[2:17:08] manifest what you have confessed. If you
[2:17:11] confess you're nothing and my bad skins
[2:17:12] and I've got these problems, all these
[2:17:14] things, God's basically saying, look
[2:17:16] buddy, I can't help you. But if you
[2:17:18] confess, no Lord, I'm made in your image
[2:17:20] because of your blood. I'm sinless.
[2:17:22] Lord, I'm your bride. Amen. Lord, you've
[2:17:24] called me. You're keeping me. You've
[2:17:25] saved me. Lord, you're my counselor.
[2:17:27] You're my guide. You'll guide me through
[2:17:28] these things. Lord, you're greater than
[2:17:30] my first birth, my lineage, your
[2:17:32] complexes, whatever. Lord, you're
[2:17:33] greater than all those things. Then the
[2:17:35] then the Lord says, "Good. Now I can
[2:17:36] work. Now I can take them at their
[2:17:38] confession and I begin to work." Amen.
[2:17:40] And you watch God, the miraculous, step
[2:17:42] in. Amen. And do the supreme. Praise the
[2:17:46] Lord. Amen. I believe it myself. God is
[2:17:50] more than able to do anything. So is
[2:17:52] anything too hard for the Lord? Not one
[2:17:54] thing. Why does he allow these things
[2:17:57] things to happen to us? He wants to
[2:17:58] prove his word in you and I. So, let's
[2:18:01] do it, shall we? Let's let God prove his
[2:18:03] word like never before. Amen. Let's
[2:18:05] stand, shall we, this morning?
[2:18:07] Amen. Let's pray that I'll turn the
[2:18:10] service to to to brother Al and Amen.

[2:18:22] presence of God in a greater way. Amen.
[2:18:24] And I've got my I got both hands raised.
[2:18:25] Let's pray together. If you want to be a
[2:18:27] member of prayer, raise your hands.
[2:18:28] Amen. Gracious heavenly father, just
[2:18:31] pray you take these chopped up words,
[2:18:32] Lord. Lord, I just ask that we would
[2:18:34] realize, Lord, when we when you come and
[2:18:37] dwell in us, you're not a lesser God.
[2:18:39] You're not a third person of a godhead
[2:18:40] or a religious spirit that's trying to
[2:18:43] win or get control or you're with equal
[2:18:46] power to the enemy. But Lord, you're the
[2:18:48] supreme one. You're the Lord God
[2:18:50] Almighty. You're the Almighty God deity.
[2:18:52] And Lord Jesus, as your prophet told us,
[2:18:55] dead yet, he doesn't just dwell in
[2:18:56] heaven. It dwells in us. So, Father, I
[2:18:58] pray, dear God, when we go out these
[2:19:00] doors we go. Lord, we face whatever
[2:19:02] we're facing. Help us to get beyond our
[2:19:04] comfort zone. Help us to look beyond our
[2:19:06] badge of skin, Lord, our complexes,
[2:19:08] pains, hurts, questions, whatever it is,
[2:19:10] Lord. May we look beyond those things,
[2:19:11] Father. Because, Lord, we know the one,
[2:19:13] Lord, the the part of us that really
[2:19:15] matters, Lord, is you within us, dear
[2:19:17] God. So, Father, may we just let us,
[2:19:19] Lord, just may we just surrender our
[2:19:20] lives completely into your hands. Lord,
[2:19:22] come step into our problems. Step into
[2:19:24] our trials. I'm speaking very much to
[2:19:26] myself, Lord. I ask, Lord, step into
[2:19:28] what we're going through, dear God.
[2:19:29] Father, may not I don't want to rely on
[2:19:31] my mind, my thinking, my ability. Lord,
[2:19:33] I just want you to take over like never
[2:19:34] before. So, Father, may you grant it,
[2:19:36] dear God. I ask, Father, we just have
[2:19:38] such a revelation, Lord, that you dwell
[2:19:40] in us, dear God. The almighty God that
[2:19:42] was there before time began is within
[2:19:44] us, Lord. We just want to commit our
[2:19:46] lives into your hands. May we be like
[2:19:48] Esther, Father. Lord God, come boldly
[2:19:50] before your throne of grace, Lord, to
[2:19:52] Lord, to deal with the enemy, Lord, that
[2:19:53] Lord, that we're facing against dear
[2:19:55] God. We love you, Lord. We thank you for
[2:19:57] this morning. Pray your blessings upon
[2:19:58] everyone here, Lord, in Jesus Christ's
[2:20:01] name. Amen.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. Amen. What

[2:25:11] came and confirmed so many things to us.
[2:25:13] Amen.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:25:17] we're all wired in different ways and we
[2:25:19] have our mindsets and we have our

[2:25:23] and so forth. And
[2:25:27] you know, you can preach the same thing
[2:25:28] week after week, year after year. And
[2:25:31] unfortunately, we all sit and listen
[2:25:33] through our filters.
[2:25:35] Um, so God so graciously decided today
[2:25:38] to use a different vessel to say the
[2:25:40] same things. And maybe maybe and I say
[2:25:44] that in faith I trust God came through
[2:25:48] the filters today.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So many things that we've been
[2:25:51] talking of and and just really excited
[2:25:54] about it. So we just I know God has met
[2:25:57] us and I and I just thank the Lord for
[2:26:00] that. Just really happy with how this
[2:26:02] morning went. And uh I want to say take
[2:26:05] it to heart. Amen.

[2:26:16] two and when we know who we are I mean
[2:26:21] we can get out of here but not head
[2:26:24] knowledge no by revelation
[2:26:28] and it's not some super duper thing it's
[2:26:31] just in simplicity surrendering to what
[2:26:33] the word says about me and not looking
[2:26:36] at the badger skin I I love that.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, God is not looking to find a
[2:26:44] fault in us. God is not trying to see
[2:26:47] where he can trip us up.
[2:26:50] God merely wants us to see.
[2:26:53] Not she is him. I am him. Amen. First
[2:26:57] person. That's what God is trying to
[2:27:00] show to us. And I say trying, the trying
[2:27:02] is not the problem in his part. The
[2:27:04] trying is is us actually getting it.
