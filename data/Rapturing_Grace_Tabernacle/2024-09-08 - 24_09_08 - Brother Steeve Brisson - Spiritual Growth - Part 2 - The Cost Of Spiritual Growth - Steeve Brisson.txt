blessing amen want to thank the musician and all the special singer tonight there was certainly a what a blessing amen let's stand up tonight for the reading of the word of God well that's quite a a full day told Brother already back there in the office I said I guess I'll have to be full of energy tonight more preaching than reading because I'm going to lose some people amen but we got a portion tonight we got a portion of the word and certainly uh the Lord has something for us tonight so we will turn in our Bible tonight in the book of St Matthew chapter 19 it's already our last service but it's been a blessing I enjoy the atmosphere I enjoy the fellowship I enjoy the fellowship with you and it's been me and my wife's been certainly certainly a good a good time amen so let's read St Matthew Chapter 19 Verse 21 actually this is the the verse we uh read this um this morning now our title tonight is the cost of spiritual growth so this morning in Friday night we've looked at um what was hindering spiritual growth but now tonight uh we will dive in and and try to get a bigger a better a better understanding of how this works so we want to read Matthew 19 verse 21 Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou H has and give to the poor and thou shalt have a treasure in heaven and come and follow me amen let's bow our head Lord Jesus thank you thank you for your presence thank you for the fellowship thank you for your word it's been certainly Lord a an amazing time in your presence and which with one another Lord it it's a taste of Heaven Lord and we want you Lord to uh give us strength for this last Service as you may come down and speak to our heart again open your word and open our understanding that we realize the challenge of the hour help us tonight we want to take every Spirit under your control take our mind Lord as we surrender ourselves in your presence we pray Lord in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated so this morning we looked at the word perfect and we realized that perfect was lead was a lead uh link to being mature it's a maturing process it's it's talking about to be complete and so this is the Young Rich ruler that went to see Jesus and he was asking the Lord what he needed to have eternal life and Jesus gave him a couple of Commandments and he says what I've done all this and Jesus told him he says now if you want to be mature a grown man if you want to be complete sell all that you have and come and follow me which I want to call this tonight the call so a lot of time after we gave our life to the Lord and got an experience with God we get a lot of people that doesn't quite know what's the next step especially when we're struggling about our status what we've looked at Friday night am I Son of God uh what if I do a wrong choice what if I fall what if I make a mistake and this morning we look at what is the the meaning of the word perfect because we have to stop disqualifying ourself because we have a call in our life and we cannot listen to the call if we are so busy wondering if we are even in the game amen and so many men in their life heard and heat the call and we have here when uh Peter and those fishermen Jesus come by and say follow me I will make you Fishers of Men and straightway they left their Nets and followed him in many instances when Jesus was just walking by he went to Peter he went to Philip he went to Matthew and he said Follow Me Now Jesus was a pure stranger I'm wondering what Jesus had that was that special that somebody would quit his career his work and leave everything on a split second without even looking back to go in the next step now obviously this this this it's it's talking and the reason why I'm I'm want to use this follow me is that God is calling you tonight this follow me is not just a conversion this follow me is the next step of growth in your spiritual life but when we are so busy wondering who we are and am I enough we don't heed the call but God is here tonight to call every one of you to the next step in spiritual growth to the next level and it's something that we underestimated because when we gave our life to the Lord and we have an experience with God then we think you know well I've arrived and yes You' have arrived as far as as as eternal life you've arrive but this morning when with the prophet is saying that the matur SE the maturing season is about to lay in the presence of God most of you probably got the picture of laying in the presence of the son he like oh perfect brother Steve I like that preaching amazing all I have to do is is is lay in the presence of the sun now you got me wrong that's not Del lay on the beach in the presence of the Sun what well I like this maturing process because now I want to talk tonight about the cost of spiritual growth I need to fix this picture in your mind that's why we need more service to to a to be able to go deeper into this this topic and so again you know Jesus passed from forth then and he saw a man named Matthew sitting in the receive and he said unto him follow me and when Jesus says follow me is that follow me in the next step and that's that's all of our call it was not like the first day Jesus says follow me we have to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost every day of our life and it's not following rules or following laws it's following the leadership of his presence which is a it's a different ball game so you know that that that that follow me thing right now is very very popular but I want to tell you there is one here tonight who wants to be followed by you and his name is Jesus follow And subscribe are we sick and tired to hear that you want to you want to fix your lawnmower and you go on YouTube and they're all about well you know like And subscribe and follow I don't want to follow you I want to fix my my lawnmower but there's how many people we call them influencers and and and every it's a modern age everybody wants to be followed and but we don't you don't know is they follow somebody else they have 100,000 subscriber they follow the one who has a million subscriber and everybody's copying and following somebody else and it's an age of followers amen what in the natural is also in the spiritual it's the age of following Jesus we need to subscribe to his to his fresh daily updates Hallelujah so Jesus passed by the son of Levi and he said follow me and and they got up and and went and and so that's um then he said Jesus unto the disciple If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me because why my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me so as much it was put aside following the law and following Church rules and and maybe some of you left the church this morning it says well what did I do because I'm I I'm used to follow rules and guidance and laws and dos and don'ts so what's my leadership now you got your answer tonight you got to follow his leadership and if you want to know if what he's telling you comes from the right Spirit you have the Bible to back it up because his Spirit wrote the Bible his Spirit sent a prophet in our age and so he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that aided his life in this world shall keep it unto Eternal If any man serve me let him follow me so we're slowly slowly entering into the cost of spiritual growth because every time you follow Jesus he's is's leading you to the next step he's leading you to growth he's not leading you to stay as a child or to stay at a status quo but he's leading you to the next step which you have no clue what it is because the Bible says that God has prepared for us before the foundation of the world some works and some Deeds that we that was prepared for us so God not only has a plan for you but he has a work for you but to be able to upon that task you need to grow inside because whatever God is asking you will bring more pressure in your life but if you don't grow inside you cannot take what's coming from the outside so we need to grow so we we'll look at different Bible character this morning tonight sorry and I want to see that every time that God calls some men and even some wom in their and our calling it came with a price and this is what we're not used to and we're not prepared for that because when we read the Bible we read it like a novel we we read it like a nice book and we underestimate what those character went through talk about David was like oh my this is so amazing it was not that amazing it was actually very very difficult so let's talk about Gideon for a minute when G when God came to visit Gideon he was with his crop hiding behind a wine press and when God visited him the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and the Lord said the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Men of Valor now you have a man that's now hiding his crop from his enemy hiding behind a wine press and God appeared to him and call him a mighty man of Valor I I'm guessing ginon is like who are you talking to like I'm full of fear and I'm hiding Beyond a wine press and you calling me a mighty man of Valor it's the same thing when when when when when Samuel visited Jesse's son family God says you're looking at the stature and the height I'm looking at the heart and there and and Jesse didn't dare invite his son CU while he's just with the Sheep it's not much it's just a kid but when man sees a kid God sees a king God seesing gon a mighty man of Valor because God knew the potential in the seed but gidon didn't know the potential in the sea and that's why God wants to grow you in a space and a position you have no clue the potential and the calling and the gift that were placed inside that seed so we see how Gideon sees himself he says Lord you know I am the least in my father's house and probably many people feel like that tonight who am I and that's why we sometime we push aside when God's called us to do something when God us to to step to the to to the next level we're kind of oh I want to be humble it's not about being Pride be humble it's about obeying the leading of the Lord so Gideon is so unsure about what's going on that you know that God calls him for a great word to deliver is Israel and and then he asked for a sign then he asked for a second second sign and he and he picks himself up because he realize God is calling him and so he's doing what God is asking him so he went at night to destroy the the the alar and the idols in the house of his father and the Bible doesn't really explain who his father was but let me give you my opinion you can take it or not but seems like to me that his father was probably a priest of some sort because when Gideon destroyed the idol Baal in his father's house all the town showed up so it was not just his personal item it seems that the the city was in shock and awe that now the idol was destroyed and so gidon did it at night he's he's following the call he's following the lead of the holy spirit in his life because God wants to grow Gideon now when God calls Gideon he's hiding behind the wine press so if you look at the accessories around him all he have is a crop and a wine press but God is saying you're going to deliver Israel he like what what all I have is a wine press and a and fear and a crop laying there and sometimes this is how we see it is when God Inspire us to do something we look at actually what's around us and how we feel and we're like how is this possible but you got to St of Faith because whatever God's going to give what you need God's going to give it to you along the way so when Gideon started his ministry is first of all to destroy the idols in his father's house but when the people get up in the morning and they found out that this Idol in the city has been destroyed they come with sword and torch and and they're like who did that and finally the Gideon's name come up and they're like well it's Gideon who did that and all the town is coming after Gideon so I want you to picture in your mind this young man has just done this this this first work for God and he did it by faith and he get up in the morning and look at the windows and and you see people coming with with with torch and sword and yelling and screaming we going to kill him we going to kill him and get is looking at the window he's like oh my goodness what's going on here and they come closer and they come closer and you start to start to feel the heat of wow you know I was excited last night I took a stand for God but I mean I'm about to die yeah that's right he feels inside of his heart it's probably the shortest ministry that's ever been I mean I've been serving God for a couple hours and I'm going to die lord well take me home but it doesn't know that he's now growing as he's listening to the call of the Lord but it won't be easy because this is the cost of spiritual growth so forget this thing about laying in the sun Gideon was laying in the Sun he's now maturing because he's entering in service but that son now he feels the heat the problem is when we read the Bible we read it as a story and when we try to do something for the Lord and it turns bad or it turns against us we lose all our courage but my question is what are you reading why are we so surprised when we try to do something for God and it turns against us it doesn't turn the way we think and you know what until Gideon's father stood up so he seems like he was an influential man because when he stood up and talked to those people at the town and he said Baal can defend himself if he's a true God my son killed him so if he's a true God he can defend himself and he and he was able to put to appease them and like get was like boy that was that close to get killed but sometime we have such a romantic view when we read it it's just a story it's like a Sunday SCH you know sometime maybe we've been training in Sunday school you know David is anointing King and he becomes king like wow is it amazing well read the story between the anointing and the crown it was not a matter of week neither of month it took several years when God calls you and inspireing I'm not talking about preaching most of you won't ever preach you won't be a deacon but every one of you have a purpose in your life God wants to anoint you God wants to come down in your life and his Spirit wants to reveal to your spirit that first of all you're a son and a daughter of God but second secondly he wants to reveal to you personally follow me then your question is well in my position brother Steve what is it to follow me I don't know it took everything for me to understand what it meant you know I remember when I started ministering it's n90 it's was in 99 so that's been a little while after I preached seven sermons a brother rose up in church and he started to attack me and I got so discouraged and he went after me and I I thought that created a commotion in the church and I was so affected by that I didn't expect that I didn't expect to preach the word of God to Christian and and one man would rise up against me and start attacking me I don't know what button I pressed but I stepped on something and the B I was so unprepared for that I had no Shield I had such an open heart loving the Lord and and I got crushed so bad and I became sick and and and fever because my spirit was so damaged and and I remembering in bed you know and having fever and you know what I I I had preached seven sermons so I thought it was a spiritual number so I said Lord I preached seventh sermon take me home honestly I thought my Ministry was over I was like I've served my purpose I delivered a message to that church they want it they don't want it it's not my problem Lord take me home little did I know that I just put a toe it was just a baby step in my calling and I already collapsed yeah cuz I didn't realize I was in a war a spiritual war and it wasn't out against that brother God probably God allowed that brother says hit him hard he needs to become a man that young Soldier needs to realize this is not a picnic and he's got to learn he'll have to grow he'll have to be able to get up when he's discouraged when he is pain and when he is crushed and to pick up his sword yes and not attack his brother but keep his mission that's right and we call that expression in war we call it shell shock and many warriors experiment that you know you go to training and I'm going to cover with that later but you go to training and people are not prepared for for the first bomb and for the first first guy who was blow up at at your on your side and they go in such a shock cuz they and Gideon went through that I went through that and that's how God wants to remove the kid out of us to make us men and Daughters of God who can stand up in the middle of discouragement and not say well if this happened I'm not a son of God I quit I'm not good for nothing I fail I this I that and to rip FP apart your service or your office for God cuz God wants to trust us with things and Mission David went through the same thing David was anointed king and and I'm going to tell you the story how I see it so a prophet comes to town to anoint a king he goes to Jesse and Jesse invites all of his sons except David like this just a kid we don't we won't bother a kid right we're here to name a king we're not here to entertain children and so when God goes through all the sons obviously is he's missing he says don't you have another one and and you can go read the Bible at home I don't have time to show all the scriptures but I just want to give you the highlights so Jesse says well he's just with the Sheep you know saying it's little boy taking care of sheep you know we're talking about serious business here we're here to we're here for a king right so he says no bring it so he's not even started he's not even anointing yet for his ministry that his father doesn't even believe in him that's a good start we know how father is important and when your father doesn't believe in you and that you're in your capacity of all these two young go play go play but finally because finally because the prophet is around he gets anointed and and and and I can I can think about David going back in the field that night laying you know in the grass looking at the stars and say man I just got anointed king today is it amazing that a straw in his M you know we're in New Zealand right and he's like wow I've just been anointed king that was so easy all I had to do is come out of the field bow my head respect the prophet all I had to do is believe the prophet oh my oh my all I had to do is listen to The Prophet believe the prophet and wow well he doesn't know God sees a king but he's still a kid he's got a lot to learn so one day his father sends his his father sends David he says you know your brother's at War so I'll pack some uh some food and you bring food to your brothers so he says yeah Dad he obeys his father so brings the food goes to the field goes to the war and and and he start hearing that goliet with the challenge and he's the seed inside start to you know that there's life in there's a lot of potential inside and and that voice of that Challenger kind of kind of trickle something inside of him because there's a there's a deep deep there he so he get all excited and he's like who's that guy why is he challenging the army of God and man God is with us and he's able and he's this and he's that and then his his brother Eliah hear him and he's like well David here you are what are you doing here why are you not with your sheep you came here and you're full of Pride I know you and so first of all his daddy doesn't believe in him and when he's about to step in his ministry to make his first word is is his brother attacks him his own brother and his brother saying you're full of Pride but if we understand the story right eliab's full of Pride because Eliah has it against David that that the cup the anointing was bypassed him and went down the alley and anointing David and now elab is still mad about that but because he's mad about that he accused David of being what he is himself that's a common pattern so his fathers didn't believe in him now his brothers attacking him and so David makes such an argument that at one point he's he was probably real convincing because they brought him to the king we got this boy here he's pretend he wants to go fight this Goliath and Saul is like really you're just a kid like another one that doesn't believe in me I want to do something for God and and every time I step there's somebody who's against me criticized me you better be sure when you have something on your heart God will allow even people that you love that will doubt what you have Jesus went through that when he went to Nazareth his own people well we know his father we know his mother we know his brother we know he's a comforter son he's just this he's nothing and the Bible says Jesus couldn't do much miracle in that town because he had such a backlash against his personal life it takes courage to serve God in the mission he has given us and so finally Saul is like okay go try to put his armor doesn't work get rid of that and then he goes in face Goliad and even his enemies like really come on guys Israel you got better than that you just send me this kid did now not only he's insulted by his own people even his enemy is laughing even his enemy doesn't even believe him if you want to be discouraged you'll be discouraged before you even start it well I knew he was not the Lord why well because it's difficult oh like that's a measuring line so he kills Goliath and then everybody gets exced excited ah finally I'm a national hero and then he gets invited in Sal in in the palace to play music and so finally is sitting in the palace with his music instrument harp and he's 10 feet from the trone and he's thinking now he remembers you know the straw with the Sheep now he says I'm 10t away the throne wow praise the Lord I'm almost there I'm anointed to be sitting in that chair and I'm actually like I'm so close and I'm I'm about to sit the king just tried to pierce him against the wall as he's thinking I'm not that close his World falls apart so he keeps playing was like I probably just dreamed that I mean that's wild imagination and then again and he realized he's in danger did I talk about that in gender confusion those of you remember I talked about that because finally David ran away at one point because he got this courage and he ran into a cave if you remember and so from being that close to the throne David ended up being a fugitive among his own people so unrecognized not appreciated but then sometime we build a complex against the people because we think the problem is the people but God did that for David on purpose amen because he's building a man inside David if he gives him the throne overnight you have a problem because you have a kid sitting on a throne but during that process God allowed all those people to give him a rough time because he's growing a character he's maturing through the trial and through through the to the tribulation but the problem is when we go through that we quit yeah and we're like it's not God it's too difficult it's too painful because the first step in childhood it's about having fun one sign of you want to know if you're mature or not if all you think about is having fun and having easy you you need to mature if you quit because it's hard you need to mature after seventh sermon I wanted to quit because it became too painful I was immature but God used that to teach me something when you feel discouraged your spirit is crushed your heart is broken and you're sick in your body it will pass you won't die there's another step and I went through that that cycle in my Ministry there's a death there's a come back to life there's a death you know even the prophet in his life he had three pool and big valleys in between even before the third pool he thought the vision he he he thought I will die he thought it was he would be die he would be because there in the vision was such an explosion he thought he would die and he was not that far because the third pull would make him diminish for Christ to increase so there was a death there was a death on many like we teach on Friday night the death through the old context the death through the old standpoint because God is about to bring him to another standpoint so there's going to be a death there's going to be a change so when we are a child we need rules because all we think about is about having fun and playing game but as we move to manhood or for our sister to get included when we move to maturity it's not about having games or having fun but it's about the purpose you have in your life when you have no purpose you need rules don't do this I know you want to have fun but don't go don't go too far you know fun at one point you know if you draw by you're drawn by Pleasure you'll get in trouble but as you're maturing God wants to give you a purpose in your life and now you're not seeking pleasure anymore you're seeking the purpose and that changes everything because now it's not about is it right or wrong for me to do that so the Bible says here that all things are lawful unto me but all things things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any so as we preach Friday night and this morning maybe there's people are saying okay brother Steve you're removing all concerns about behavior and rules and law and so what's going to guide me and the answer is tonight what's going to guide you is the purpose that God gave you in saying follow me this will be become your vision and this is why when I talk to young people and it's like brother Steve do you think it's right if I do this I almost never answer a question about the present time like no you shouldn't do that I don't do that because if I if I do that I don't teach them how to take a decision so I always fall back when they ask me a question I did that with my children I do that with young people especially when they're difficult time I always have a step back and I ask them where do you want to be in five years and I want to fall back into their purpose if they have one then I ask them I asked the young young people I saids do you want to get married yes do you want to marry a Christian yeah I want to marry a Christian perfect you want to have kids I want to have kids do you want to bring your kids to church yes I want to bring my you want to raise them you know to love God and re yes that's what I want to do all right so to if that is your vision and this is your mission in life now reconsider that the decision you're taking today will that decision draw you closer to that purpose o away from that purpose and suddenly you're not judging on right or wrong or I'm allowed or I'm not allowed but you are judging on the purpose that God has put inside of your heart so Paul says I'm allowed to do whatever I want because I'm not under the law anymore so he's Guided by a higher purpose than the lawful or not but he's guided now and that's the mature level but when there's a kid you can't you don't ask a kid if he has a vision like what I'm hungry what's your purpose the next meal right what's your purpose I want to go play with my friends what's your purpose in life you know I want to go play hockey I want to go play this right it's the instant gratification instant pleasure it's about getting fed having fun and and avoiding pain at all cost immature so for that stage they need law cuz they don't have a purpose but as we mature we move away from lawful unlawful and we are moving into expedient which means does it profit me does it make me better is it good for me is it profitable for me concerning what concerning this cuz now I have a mission now I have a purpose you're with me so now you're taking your decision based on where you want to be in life now your Eternal destination is solved the question is solv eternal destination is solved so you're not making your decision to be to have eternal life cuz you have already eternal life so now your decision is based on now what's my purpose on Earth while I'm here God you have prepared works for me what is it Lord amen yes I was talking to a brother in F uh after the service and he said I don't know if he's here tonight but he says God has really you know I brought a Revival in my life lately and I'm I testify as much as I can't and I I give scriptures to people and it it can be such at a small it small it's not small it's big but small in a sense that when we talk about a calling everybody think about a position in the church or or being behind a Pulpit or it doesn't have to be in the church it's great if it is but maybe some of you God is calling you to witness somewhere to go in a part to end out tracks to testify whatever God is calling you there is a call am but it will cost you something it might change your life it might change the level of comfort that you have Because unless you're willing to give your life you're not ready to fight follow Jesus and it g across something it might change your habit what if afterward God ask you always to stop at a certain place to testify well no I don't I'm hungry I want to go back home whatever God is asking you it will change your habit it will it will bring some pain some discomfort true so you got to be ready to say Lord what and and and so that discomfort or that that fear of pain is a childish thing so God wants to grow you inside you know when when I went through that after seven service I was probably that small inside so when that backlash came I fell into pieces but when I got back up and God resurrected me cuz he had to do it that's right something had happened I was bigger how do we do muscle yeah you know how we do muscle we lift weight we do something and you know what happened the muscle being teared and it hurts then it heals and in that process it got bigger and stronger and so if in the natural you're willing if you want to go bigger and stronger you're willing to to tear your your muscle so they heal and they go bigger I said who created that well on a spiritual level it's the same thing there's going to be some heartbreak there's going to be some scars there's going to be some pain but that's how God is building us a character because we are called to rign am so that's a different perspective and this is how I try to even lead my family the children you know how do you make your children obey there's many ways you threaten them all the time do it because I'm spank you do that do it CU I'm going to tell Daddy when he comes home well that's fun for Daddy now all the kids are afraid every time dad comes home cu the mother spend all day threatening when daddy's gonna come home when daddy's gonna come home like Daddy comes home he's like thank you honey all the kids are afraid of me but you threaten you threaten because you're trying to make them move but when they start to to grow up and have a little bit of understanding you know what I did one day I made a contract with my children and I asked them I said what kind of home do you want us guys to have I went on the bigger purpose I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't went to that event but I backed off and I we had that discussion what kind of a house do you guys want us to have do you want a house where Mommy and and Daddy are screaming all the time because you guys don't listen do you like a house where where parents scream no no no we don't like that we don't want that so okay so I said if you don't want that kind of house what can we do to have a peaceful house where there there's there's um coordination where it's not chaos so I said what if we ask you something for the first time with a with peaceful voice and quiet and you guys do it we're going to have a peaceful house here because there's going to be a flow and there's going to be Co cohesion between us and then later on you're sitting in the car and they're so noisy and this and that says okay kids please tone it down a little bit and they don't listen and then I raise my voice and then the third time I like okay time out you remember our conversation where I asked you what kind of house do you and when I recall the greater purpose of the house you know what it did to the kids oh yeah this is our vision and sometime they were going to visit maybe other family and it was chaotic sometime and so they knew and they saw us also that if if we re they didn't didn't like me they don't like brother Steve when he's angry my eyes you know and the pnut I would give my kids still talk about that Daddy you're look and your pish nut arm I said do you want us to yell do you want us to hurt you or we can talk when we train our children to hear only when you get punished do you know that it translate with God it was for me now I'm getting away from my notes but I just follow the leading the Holy Ghost I was raised with you know punishment and I got used to to this and later on when I became a Christian God I was I was I was preaching in a church and and one day Brother D called me to he says you know I want you to pray about coming at our church Andre is my wife's father it's my my father-in-law he was the pastor of the church and he says I want you to pray and consider moving in our church to help me in the ministry and I'm like well in my church I was slung song leading I was the youth leader I was preaching I was I was really involved because a smaller church and Warden had that was a church with many people and more staff I you could say so I didn't see I didn't realize the purpose so I prayed but I didn't really take that seriously and I and I called him like a few days later and I'm like no I don't think and he was like he was surprised like I didn't ask you to call me a couple of days later I wanted you to pray and take your time so finally it was a it was no and then in my mind I'm like I don't know if I took the right decision but if I didn't take if I took the bad decision nothing bad has happened to me so I'm expecting I'm expecting a punishment if I made a mistake because for me this is clear if I do something wrong God's going to spank me so I'm waiting for that instead of waiting for the Lord to tell me so I called for that you know what happened couple of days later after I called about Andre to tell him I'm not going my wife was pregnant with William she almost lost a baby she went to the hospital then she's in bed she has to stay in bed because she's about to lose the baby and then I go to work and I was working on night shifts I'm the one who put the alarm close the shop and go back home that day seems like I forgot to put the alarm system and they got robbed and stole the computer and all that and it was my fault and so now I'm starting to listening because now I almost lost my baby my wife is is in bed and now they got stole at my job because of my fault and now I'm now I'm going on my knees why because I got spanked some bad things has happened to me so I feel like this is a punishment so I probably made a wrong decision because I I was trained with punishment later on God showed me you don't have to go that far I I I can talk to you so God wants to talk to you but if you've been trained that he's going to slap you that something bad so nothing bad has happened to me so I guess I'm right don't go there you don't have to have that relationship with the Lord God wants to talk to you God wants to reveal it to you that you're made a mistake here look at my word and Lord oh I'm sorry and you go back in line that's are you with me so that's what I told the kids I says do you want a house where we spank we yell and where there's violence or a house where we talk and when it was going uh astray and the kids were I had to raise my voice I always fail back to the vision and you know I got five kids it always worked every time I fell back I didn't go back to the law to rules but to a principle that me and them and my wife had agreed it was our home contract we want this house to be peaceful we want this house not to yell and we're angry and we're fussing we're a house when we can talk understand that I need for you to do this I need you guys to do that because we we need to move forward we're all the family we're all in together and every time I said that it triggered something in my children I saw them in their eyes they like yep daddy y y y y this all what we want this is how we lead to maturity so it's linked to this it's not about what you're doing is wrong or right but are we going against the mission you're with me watching the clock here all right let's talk about Mary oh we love that story Mary hears the voice of the Angel she says Let It Be Done unto me then she's pregnant is it amazing how easy that look right nice Sunday School Story and we stopped there now what we have to to realize that after she obeyed the voice of God and she becomes pregnant she's there's some spiritual growth then she comes to Joseph and said honey I'm pregnant by the voice of God yeah she's wanted a woman who had such Faith to become pregnant Naturally by the voice of God now name me a woman in the Bible that can match that and we think it's glorious and it is and we think it's easy but it was not because the next day she almost lost her husband that's a hard part you get up in the morning and you hear that Joseph secretly is trying to get rid of you he like Lord why is this happening to me this is the man I love this is the man I want to spend my life with he's a man of God and and I obeyed I trusted you Lord I I've accepted your word I listen to the voice of the Angel and he's about to get rid of me cuz that happened maybe few hours maybe a couple of days but when we read the story we read it quick but we don't go through the process the emotion the downside the crushing of the heart the crying the begging God it's not written but these were real human beings with a real life story but when you take a stand for God he'll have your back that's right Mary didn't have to defend herself and that's why sometime we got it wrong when God ask us to do something and it turns back we're up there trying to defend oursel and try to stay quiet let God come on the scene you trusted God to do it Gideon didn't have to do nothing the father steps in David didn't even want to get rid of Saul twice he had the chance to kill him but he was not it was not for him to make way for his ministry for his calling he says I'm not touching he's in Saul is in between my calling and me I'm I could K kill him right now so I can move on but don't ever kill brutalize or make violence to defend your call let God do it for you so David says not touching Saul God took control of Saul and in the right time the door got open so we need courage we need patience and we need to fall back to our mission and we have to remember sometime we make it personal even in in the ministry God gave me sometime I made it personal I made it about me and when you make it about you you're making a mistake because if you're there it's God called you he's the author of this he wrote the book and he knows the end of the chapter you don't know the end of the book so you don't defend yourself and it's not about you it's about what God wants to do it in your life and he will do it hallelujah hallelujah so finally God talks to Joseph that's getting fixed they're getting but then the rumors in the streets now she becomes a woman of Shame yes but in our mind you know this novel romantic novel we think that if I take a stand for God everybody's going to applaud everybody's going to agree everybody we're not here to be cheered by a a crowd we are here to follow the will of the lord we got to have a revelation of our position amen all right let's move on and so the problem we have is that we read but we're not reading we are used to nice stories andwell and in our society our society is built on avoiding pain at all costs and seeking pleasure at all costs and you know what when they train military personnel they try to make it as much as realistic as possible because and that's why I'm preaching the way I'm preaching tonight I'm not trying to sell you an easy story because that's where I realize many Christian they get excited in church because oh praise the Lord we're the bride thank the Lord we're Victorious thank the lord we read the back of the wood the the book and we win and it's all true but we got to prepare the people that when we walk out of church it's War that's right and it's not war against the people it's not the war against the that neighbor at work that's against you it's a spiritual war but you got to be ready to be crushed to be brokenhearted to be discouraged and not quit I say that but I've quit many times or did I quit and that's where I realized that something something is holding me because what I realized you know I'm a I'm a I'm a strong will man but God has allow me to be broken to Pieces where I was not able I didn't have any strength to hold my Christian Life the ministry he gave me I remember 2016 2017 I had a meltdown burnout I quit the ministry for 6 months I was done I said Lord I quit it's like when you think you're holding onto something too many people here think that you're are you are holding onto the Lord You're not holding and if you think that God will allow a period of your life where you don't have the strength to hold anymore so Lord Lord do something I can't hold anymore Lord Lord I I'll have to let go Lord it Lord I'm warning you is too difficult I'm going to backslide Lord I'm going to quit or it's too difficult I warn you now it's too late I'm still here oh praise the Lord oh you're holding me my I wasted so many effort trying to hold on but and and I went through that experience when I quit I was still there when I said Lord I have enough and my wife saw me collapse at one point she saw she thought we won't have any Pastor anymore cuz I told him I I'm done I'm done but when I said I'm done I was still there and when I quit I realized that inside of my heart it was still there but what what what I die was me I died but the calling was still there then I realized my did I spend so much energy trying to hold this all this together well now you reveal tell to me that he's holding it together and if we don't realize that God's going to reveal it to you cuz it's really important so we need real training you know when I meet people and they try to do something for God and they get so discouraged I'm like this is what I was talking about it's going to be rough well I know but not that rough yes exactly that rough you'll want to quit you'll want to bargain with God you'll say Lord I I didn't know what I was getting into Lord I'm done now this and this and and and it will exploit every um weakness you have inside of you every complex every loose end in your inside of you will be exploit by the enemy but God allows that because all those loosen will get strengthen thank you Lord It's why are we preaching that cuz we're talking about spiritual growth we've done talking about we're Sons and Daughters of God we know that we're not perfect and it's exactly that before we go to war we got to realize I'm going to do mistake and if I do a mistake WIll I throw my gun and walk away from the from the combat or I pick myself up and I reload like the prophet is talking about the war I was how a bomb would miss and the other one would miss the prophet says keep trying until one goes off it's not time to quit We're All in This Together friends so the training has to be real it's good to encourage people we're the bride we're winning glory to God God sent a prophet we have the victory it's it's all good it's all good to encourage the people but at the other side we got to be truly honest the pastor has to be honest to say it is difficult right now church pray for me I took a couple of weeks of vacation in August and when I came back we did a prayer meeting I told the church I need prayer I'm coming back from vacation and I need the inspiration of God we're all in this together and so we kneeled together and all together I says church pray for me now they realized that that the pastor is is is not Invincible he's a man that's fighting his end and so all the church now got together to fight in prayer because we're all in this together there is no Invincible men here Ministry always like they're they're on the victory side because when we preach it's the better version of oursel because it's the anointing because it's the word and and we get caught up in that Supernatural atmosphere and it's the best version of ourself and when people see that sometime they're mistaken I wish I'd be like brother Steve I wish I'd be like brother already I wish I'd be like this minister they look so great they look so strong that's why the word has to be truly honest that yes the word is Almighty the anointing of God is extremely powerful but us a human being we going to go to the thick and to the difficult and if we're not doing that if we don't train the church and teach the church to the reality of the spiritual warfare we are creating trainings cars somebody heard about that training cars if you've been training uh a law enforcement firefighters paramedics they probably taught you training cars training cars is that when you go to school trying to learn your work it's practice and training SCS is that when you practice something but it's not perfectly fit for the real life I'll give you an example one of my friend in in Quebec he's a paramedic but he's also a teacher he teached a paramedics and he said at one point he says we were teaching the the student that they they had a um they would they would have to take the Pulse on a mannequin so he has no pulse take their arm and then the teacher would tell them you know the pul you know 75 or 85 and so they train all the time they take the Pulse take the arm take the Pulse and look at the teacher to get the number but then when they got in real life they took the arm and look at the teacher because now he was a real person and and and in real person in training like the teacher like you're looking at me but there's a real pulse now it's not a mannequin it's a real person that's training scars is that you create an habit of being of training but not in the real world and when you get in the real world you fail cuz you are not prepared I don't know if you heard about the new Hall shooting but some of the first identified fatal training scars is the law enfor enforcement context secured in a gunfight in 1970 later referred to as the new Hall Massacre during this gunfight four California Highway Patrol officers were killed in less than five minutes and the officers displaced several training scars that day which may have led to their death the prophet says he says it's what in the kid that made up the kid what's on the inside of you and what you are now is what you're to probably be the rest of your life you're on a changing spot do you know what 86% of the conversions to Jesus Christ is done before 21 years old it shows it statistics shows it 86% that come to Christ come before they're 21 after you pass that age you become more molded and set in your ways oh it's possible sure they come 70 80 years old but it's very rare why because what we keep doing repetitively we become that and after that we've been like the prophet says after we've been molded into that it becomes even harder to change our ways young people you got to be careful if you come to church just to play to church and you're not serious you are setting yourself up you're setting your ways that you are training yourself to be fake and and it becomes automatic you got to be careful so the officer were not used to recoil the rec of The Recoil for their three 57 Magnum hand guns having only fire 38 Special rounds in training and their lack of familiarity with the Magnum rounds may have contributed to their poor poor shooting performance so when they were practicing they were practicing with a with a gun that didn't have a lot of recoil but in real life when they started toot shooting for real they were not used because they were not trained in real world and I can't apply that to our church where if if we just want to get people happy and excited and oh God is good and praise the Lord and we are not preaching about the reality of life people are not prepared and they are clueless of the cost that's going to come for taking a stand for the Lord growing will come with a price one officer carried his shotgun at Port Arms positioned with the shotgun stock resting and so in in in in the gun range for safety purpose the cops had their shotgun resting on on the belt and the muzzle in the air yeah so while approach approaching the two dangerous armed criminal they had their gun like this approaching so he got shot before he was able because that's how they practice they practice they didn't practice for real danger they were not trained for spiritual war they were trained out praise the lord we believe a prophet everything's going to be automatic like David praise the Lord I listen to the prophet praise the Lord I believe the prophet praise the Lord the prophet has anointed me but he was not ready he didn't know that when he was going out I've listened and believe a prophet and anointing that now there was a war before he would be able to on the throne in rain it's less exciting to hear a sermon like that we're more excited to hear praise the Lord of sons of God and all that and you're still sons of God by the way but why am I preaching like that it's because when you're going to get in the thick of it God's going to bring back this sermon and then and because some of you are not understanding what I'm saying right now and it's it's not a problem God the holy spirit will bring back those words in a thick when you're going going to be in your room crying and Lord H it is so difficult I don't know I can make it then the Holy Ghost will say go listen again that sermon of Brother Steve that's what he was talking about and another officer fired Remington 870 so fast that he actually ejected a live round he was killed with an empty shotgun in his hand and it has been alleged that rapid fire shotgun training was not part of chp's firearms C curriculum at the time and the officer's lack of familiarity with the weapon led to his potential fatal error so when they studied that case all the four polic men made a mistake related to their training they had not been trained to face real situation and from that they wrote a book and and and police training has changed to get closer to the reality and we've been we've been around long enough I've been raised in church we I was not prepared in my generation I was not prepared to face life right we need a generation who is ready to go out there and carry the gospel and ready to go to war ready to have setbacks ready to have a failure and pick yourself up again and keep fighting oh I hope tonight we inspired some courage and another officer maybe not in that case but they found officer that were dead that had empty shell in their pocket you know why because at the gun range they were taught to get to pick their empty shells to keep the gun range clean so they were shooting and when they were reloading they were picking empty shells and got shot it's unfortunate for those men but we're not talking about them tonight we're talking about us amen I'm closing for those who worries shell shock when Peter was following the Lord he didn't have a clue how difficult it would become he had followed Jesus and every time there was a tough situation you have 5,000 men they want to be fed we don't have no food we ask Jesus he's going to take care of the situation we don't have money for the tax collector we go fish a fish there's money give it for me and you and every time they were with Jesus somebody dies he raised them up somebody comes he's sick and they're walking with Jesus and Jesus always has the answer for them because they're in their childhood Jesus do everything for them he Shield them they're they're like behind the Shar not Jesus is not the Shar but I mean they're sheltered but when Jesus is arrested Jesus warns them it's going to be tough and Jesus Peter is like no Lord I'm ready to die for you yeah wait you don't know what I'm talking about so when Jesus get arrested and the heat comes upon all the disciples and now suddenly Jesus is not the flavor of the hour anymore now it's a shame to be with Jesus it gets you in trouble Peter melt inside he is not ready to face the Heat and he denies knowing Jesus three times and when that happened he just collapsed those three years and a half doesn't mean anything for him now because he has collapsed first he had made for him three times the same mistake and so he melt and collapse and he run away and he bitterly cry and you know when hap what happened he falls back to his default program he goes back to his childhood stuff says well we'll go we're going to go fishing so many unprepared people got converted received the Holy Ghost they get all excited I want to do something for Jesus byang Shell Shocked you want to quit everything now it's the thick of it now it these are real bombs now there's real damages There's real Church division family uh this and that and Lord I like he I didn't know that was it was not to be Christian I thought that Christian would be and then we had imagination of something so easy but you got to go through that process and shake out of it maybe there's somebody sitting here tonight that inside of you that's who you are right now you're going to the thick of it and you say Lord I didn't expect it to be that difficult your pastor can talk about it we have men of God here that went through that you got married oh my for the better and the better for health and health and riches over riches we have no clue when we're 20 21 22 right we say for the better or the worse but worse we don't hear it it's just a word no for us it's going to be for the better for health and for riches Hallelujah and then goes the first argument under there goes the first situation and you're like who are you that girl I don't know why do you didn't show yourself in the courtship who are you guy like I I I thought you like in the courtship you look mature you always said the right thing and had the the right attitude you know what's my advice for young people in courtship take your time to see the worst of that person and you want to see the worst in that person delay them a little bit more and watch their reaction rub them on the other side the problem sometime in courtship oh I'm so out of my notes and I'm trying to quit honestly I'm trying to quit well you're responsible cuz you're pulling sometimes the problem with courtship is we're trying to show such a best the best version of ourself which is normal It's Perfectly Normal but we have to see and so you enter into marriage for the best for the riches for the health and suddenly one day there's an argument of situation and and and there's a serious crisis and you are so shocked inside of you that's how you look and then you want to quit you want to quit because nobody told me that we would we we would go through a crisis like that in our marriage nobody told me that we would go in a crisis like that in our church yes Crisis happen in the best churches Crisis happen in the best marriage but when that happened we call it to be shell shock we want to quit because we didn't count the cost that's why Jesus says before you build a tower before you go to war sit down and count the costs you got to know what you're getting into I'm not selling to you tonight an easy War we going to win brother and sister that's guaranteed all you have to do is show up and report for Duty God will fight for you the only thing God is asking you is report for duty but as we've seen you you've you've listened to the gender confusion series when men lose they go hide in the cave they quit but God doesn't want us to quit God wants us to report for Duty he want us to be men of Courage amen praise the Lord I'm closing with this verse Hebrews chapter 10 for ye need have for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise so the Bible is saying is after you've done the will of God you need [Music] Pence you're on a mission and you don't know what's the next step if You' have told me and this October it's going to be 25 years in the ministry for me that number is just I don't understand it because after seven service I was done and if You' have told me that I would become a pastor and it would this this this I was I would it's a good thing to God didn't tell me that because I was not big enough inside to carry that position so what he did to me is that he unloaded a little bit at a time if you're faithful in little thing I'll give you more is what Jesus says and it's not that we're faithful in little because I want more I don't really want more but God has a greater purpose for us and every time that you reach your calling and you're like okay I'm good praise the Lord I I got this don't stop God is about to add more God is about to add more because he wants you to grow this is spiritual growth time that's barhead musician can come while we have our heads bowed maybe musicians can play Softly and Tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me Lord Jesus I hope Lord I was too negative tonight but it's something I've noticed Lord in many Christian people they're not ready for war because we are contaminated by the world where everything is about having good time be with the friends be with people we like having good time seeking pleasure seeking greatest comfort and every time something goes against that we Rebel we we hurt we don't understand we're confused because we're so wired with comfort and seeking pleasure and that goes against everything thing that the gospel is calling us which is to lay our life give our life husband loved your wife like Christ has loved the church that he gave his life it means there's a price to pay well sometime Lord many times we're not ready for that because we've been we've been contaminated by the world we may be in your house we may be as son and daughters of God and may be some of us tonight we realize yeah my life is built about around seeking comfort and seeking pleasure is that what you want from me Lord and it's not Lord that we're going to suffer for suffering that's not the purpose but we don't want to step out of your will because there's sufferings pray Lord as I leave these people that something tonight has inspired courage for mothers that are right now in the thick of it that they thought that raising kids was amazing and all romantic and all nice and it is but sometime there's deep valleys where we don't have the answer and then you're on your knees says Lord I didn't know it was that hard Lord I love this man he's my husband I know you gave it to me but I didn't know it would be that hard to for him to understand me and me understanding him Lord I'm confused new and then we doubt because it gets difficult we're like Lord was was all this from you I'm wondering if David sometime was watching the stars and say Lord was it really real that Samuel really anointed me like now I'm a run away my own people are my own Army is trying to kill me I live in cave I live like a renegade was it really real lord you never told me it would be that difficult [Music] pray Lord that you send your Holy Spirit tonight a spirit of comforter we don't want to measure your call by the level of pain we don't want to measure our position in Christ by the level of difficulties never your Prophet never you told us it would be easy but you said Lord that you would be with us until the end of the world and you are faithful you stood with Mary you defended David never Saul was allowed to kill David it would have never happen because you had a purpose and Lord you have a purpose for these people tonight Inspire courage to your people renew hope and courage to everyone of them if somebody's in the valley tonight Lord may your voice reach that deep deep down in that Valley to tell them I have not forsaken you I am training you I am growing in inside of you for you to become the woman that I see I see a king inside of you I see a queen and I'm training you right now cuz I have greater things I want to to give you stay faithful report for Duty don't [Music] quit if you are shell shock right now and you lost all track and all all sense of what's going on turn to North turn to God you got in the book of Psalm prayers that David made out of out of his cave Lord Hear My Cry hiding in a g in a cave losing like Elijah in a cave losing wanted to die shell shocked the day before he had such a Revival killed all the prophet the anointing was there but then he got threatened he ran away hid in a cave he was Shell Shocked now his life is in danger now it's not fun to serve God anymore oh Mont Carmel was great but then the next day was not that great and we don't cope right Lord with those things if your prophets had such meltdown What About Us train us Lord Jesus we are carrying training scars nice Bible stories easy stories Sunday school night stories and that's all good but Lord our purpose your purpose is to train Us train us for war help us Lord to accept to give our life I give you these people tonight Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen song Softly Ender Jesus is calling calling for you and for me stand up see on the portal is waiting and

be perfect like your heavenly father is perfect in terms of maturity you need to be mature amen but maturity comes at a price life is hard and life was meant to be hard when we accept that life is hard then it becomes less hard because we know that there's a purpose in us and I love that principle if you look at it from a vision perspective if you look at where you are heading and if you look at what the purpose is while you're here then you understand why you go through things the things is not easier just because we know they are expected I mean God works in us and God I mean like I I love the the the the balance here because this morning and and over the weekend we heard you know the all the all the character is already in the seed but it requires a bit of beating to get the the
