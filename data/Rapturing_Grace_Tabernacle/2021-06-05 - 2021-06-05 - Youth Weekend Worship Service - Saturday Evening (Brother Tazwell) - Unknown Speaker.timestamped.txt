[18:13] and there's just a wonderful atmosphere
[18:15] i know some of you are tired i know some
[18:17] of you didn't sleep
[18:17] lots last night and you had a fairly
[18:20] busy day but i trust that you enjoyed
[18:22] the day and that you
[18:23] have been blessed and remember our
[18:26] scripture
[18:28] behold our good and our pleasant it is
[18:30] for brethren to dwell together
[18:32] and that's what we're doing we thank god
[18:33] for this opportunity and it's
[18:35] it's lovely to uh to have everyone here
[18:37] it's wonderful to have so many good sing
[18:39] voices tonight
[18:40] man we're going to have church
[18:44] but so tonight we
[18:47] just just to make sure that everyone is
[18:50] exactly on the same page so what we're
[18:51] going to have tonight is brother tazil
[18:53] is going to bring us
[18:54] a message and i've asked him to uh to
[18:56] keep it to a maximum of 20 minutes but
[18:58] don't time him on your watches now
[19:01] see how much you can suck out of him in
[19:03] that 20 minutes right
[19:05] okay so we suck him dry by the time he's
[19:07] done
[19:09] right but i'm just a real privilege to
[19:11] have you
[19:12] and uh so so just one or two logistical
[19:15] things that i don't want to
[19:17] bother you with afterwards um so firstly
[19:21] tomorrow morning we'll see you again
[19:23] here at church at 10 o'clock it church
[19:25] starts at 10 so
[19:27] doors open at 9 30 so ideally we'll be
[19:30] here at 9 30.
[19:31] if you want a seat you'll be here at 9
[19:33] 30
[19:35] because we probably have more people
[19:37] than we have capacity for
[19:39] so we'll we'll be nice and cozy tomorrow
[19:43] in church we'll
[19:44] we'll see how many people we can squeeze
[19:46] in
[19:47] but um you're just looking forward to
[19:48] that remember your photo competition
[19:50] i trust that you've had some photos and
[19:53] groups will probably need to have a chat
[19:55] to decide what photos they're going to
[19:56] submit before 10 o'clock tomorrow
[19:58] morning
[19:59] um so probably a good idea to to
[20:01] consider doing that quickly afterwards
[20:03] then i also want to say um after we've
[20:06] had this time so so we're gonna
[20:09] let me ask this how many of you have

[29:46] mike loves vegan patties right so mike
[29:50] and leonard they're going to countdown
[29:54] and mike's focus is i want a vegan patty
[29:58] that's what i want it's like he's

[30:15] patty i want the vegan party
[30:17] and we come to countdown and we find
[30:20] that there's a long line
[30:23] of people standing waiting to buy a
[30:26] vegan
[30:27] patty vegan patty a vegan patty
[30:30] and as we're standing in there we're
[30:32] standing in the line and tesla is
[30:34] standing next to mike and and
[30:36] after a while mike is just passing i
[30:38] can't wait to call way back on wait
[30:40] vegan patty vegan patty but after a
[30:42] while tess is standing there and taz is
[30:44] starting to get very agitated
[30:47] because this likes vegan patty as well
[30:50] but you know it's not really
[30:51] his style but anyway mike is focused
[30:55] mike wants the vegan patty and after a
[30:58] while tess says you know mike you know i
[31:00] can't handle this anymore
[31:01] there's too much people we're going to
[31:03] wait too long and you know what i'm just
[31:05] going to give up i don't
[31:06] i don't want this but mike says stairs
[31:08] stay with me man
[31:10] you're going to enjoy it you know when
[31:12] we get it
[31:13] i don't know how this thing looks
[31:16] there's when we get that man
[31:18] you're gonna you're gonna want to come
[31:19] back again but dez is just standing
[31:22] there after a while test is mike you
[31:23] know what
[31:24] i i can't i can't wait in this line it's
[31:27] too long
[31:28] look it's going all the way around then
[31:31] no no i'm not interested
[31:32] like i'm on the go and then tess goes
[31:35] and tears loses out on the vegan patty
[31:37] and mike goes and mike gets his vegan
[31:39] patty because he stands in line
[31:41] and i was i was i was thinking about the
[31:43] story you know
[31:44] and i realize that there's sometimes
[31:46] people that
[31:48] we we there is something that's
[31:51] available to us
[31:52] something that we desire and uh
[31:55] many times if if you're not if you're
[31:58] not
[31:58] focused on on that on what you want and
[32:02] and and you see all the you know the
[32:04] circumstances that comes your way
[32:07] there are people that will focus on the
[32:08] vegan patty
[32:10] that's what i want but then there are
[32:12] people that will focus they want the
[32:13] vegan
[32:14] petty but then they focus on all the
[32:16] other stuff and
[32:17] you know and then and that's all they
[32:19] see they don't see the vegan
[32:21] mic seasons and that's where he's going
[32:24] he doesn't care how long he's gonna wait
[32:26] but he wants to get there but then there
[32:28] are others that just stands you know and
[32:30] they
[32:30] you know it's uh it's going to take too
[32:32] long and then they give up
[32:34] and then mike because his perseverance
[32:37] he
[32:38] pushes ahead he wants it he gets it at
[32:41] the end
[32:42] but then tez loses out you know and i
[32:45] was i was actually thinking of that
[32:47] and i was looking at at the way the
[32:50] world
[32:50] is going and i was looking at
[32:54] the the culture of the world
[32:57] and there's this you know this is this
[32:59] concept you guys might know more about
[33:01] this is what i do
[33:02] but there's you know the you you cancel
[33:04] culture you hear about all the different
[33:06] kind of cultures
[33:08] and um when i look at it from my
[33:11] perspective and i
[33:12] and i look at it through the word of god
[33:14] i look at it and i see you know what
[33:17] these cultures and things that's
[33:19] happening today
[33:20] in the world it's actually it's trying
[33:24] to produce a bunch of weak
[33:28] people i remember i think it was 10
[33:30] years ago
[33:31] i preached a sermon in the church called
[33:34] the power of desensitization
[33:37] and i was saying how you know the way
[33:40] things are working out in our i was
[33:42] talking about
[33:43] television sitcoms at the time and i was
[33:46] saying how
[33:47] it made the man of the house seem like a
[33:50] weakling
[33:51] and i was looking at the world today and
[33:54] i
[33:54] i find out that that is what the world
[33:58] and what the devil wants to do to
[34:01] everybody
[34:02] just make people a bunch of
[34:05] weaklings now i don't know brother
[34:08] brother
[34:08] um uh joseph i gave a quotation i don't
[34:12] know if you have it
[34:13] but i'm uh if you could get that code
[34:15] ready if you don't have it i will i will
[34:16] just read it
[34:17] but i want you know i as as i was
[34:20] looking at the young people today
[34:22] and and my heart just just went out
[34:26] to each one because i realized that
[34:30] all hell is against you
[34:36] all hell is against you the devil
[34:40] is not your friend
[34:44] he is your enemy he crazy he pretends
[34:49] to be your friend the song says he
[34:51] pretends to be so kind
[34:54] but his aim is to destroy you so
[34:58] his whole objective is he wants to have
[35:00] a bunch of weak
[35:02] people he wants to have a bunch of weak
[35:05] young people but
[35:09] that quote can you see it can you see
[35:10] that quote
[35:12] brother branham comes he says this is
[35:15] what god
[35:16] wants he says we're not building an
[35:19] organization
[35:21] i'm not here this morning to build an
[35:23] organization christ
[35:24] never sent me to bolt organization
[35:29] christened me to build individuals
[35:34] and i'm looking at the individuals here
[35:35] tonight
[35:37] to build individuals to the statue
[35:41] of jesus christ that they
[35:44] might be the powerhouse and the abiding
[35:49] place of the spirit
[35:50] by his word that is what
[35:54] god wants that's not what the devil
[35:57] wants
[35:58] the devil wants to make you weak he
[36:01] wants you just to give in
[36:03] when that little thing come i think last
[36:05] time i was here i spoke about
[36:06] temptations
[36:08] and when when that little temptation
[36:09] comes
[36:11] then you you the devil tries to he uses
[36:14] his tricks
[36:15] he makes you so weak that when the thing
[36:18] comes
[36:18] you just struggle you you just give in
[36:22] but it's so important that you
[36:26] and i grow and you know as i talk to us
[36:29] your young people right
[36:30] i speak to myself as well whatever i say
[36:33] to you
[36:34] comes back to me now who knows and i'm
[36:38] assuming
[36:39] many of us reads the bible and reads the
[36:41] messages what does brother branham say
[36:43] in simple words what do you need to do
[36:46] to be
[36:47] a strong christian a strong
[36:50] believer anybody can anybody tell me
[36:54] what does brother branham say yes make
[36:58] read your bible and pray every day
[37:03] simple abcs simple things right
[37:09] but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not
[37:11] going to ask you to raise your hands
[37:13] right but i want you to raise your
[37:15] hearts if you do
[37:18] how many of us can say
[37:21] that monday last week tuesday wednesday
[37:25] thursday friday straight saturday it's
[37:28] saturday
[37:29] so it's monday tuesday i read my bible
[37:32] every day
[37:34] and i prayed you you can answer that to
[37:38] yourself right
[37:39] how many of us can say that now
[37:43] if there are some of us that can say yes
[37:47] i read my bible every day and i prayed
[37:50] i'm sure that you will see
[37:53] and you have seen the results in your
[37:56] life
[37:56] because you would have seen the devil
[37:58] will come and try to do things
[38:00] and try to do tell you things and try to
[38:02] pull you this way
[38:04] but because you just follow that simple
[38:06] abc read your bible every day
[38:08] and pray and it it it pulls you up
[38:11] it makes you it it makes you what is
[38:13] what the brandon says a powerhouse
[38:16] and then and and the more you do that as
[38:18] simple as it is
[38:20] the more you do it the more when the
[38:23] temptation and the situation and the
[38:24] trial come
[38:26] you will be able to say no
[38:31] maybe right now you can't say no and i
[38:33] know what it's like right i'm a young
[38:35] person
[38:36] and it's not only at the young people
[38:38] it's me also
[38:39] i've got to tell the devil every day no
[38:43] so i've got to read my bible every day
[38:45] i've got to pray
[38:47] i've got to feed on the word of god and
[38:49] you know when i read this this this this
[38:52] uh this
[38:53] quote i like to make it very personal
[38:57] so i put that actually individuals in
[38:59] square brackets and i put they in square
[39:01] brackets
[39:02] because when i read that quote i read it
[39:05] as
[39:06] christ sent me brother branham
[39:09] to build tesla
[39:12] to the statue of jesus christ
[39:15] you see where the branham says the more
[39:18] you
[39:18] receive the word
[39:22] the more you become
[39:25] the word you can go and go into the
[39:28] message app and just type that you will
[39:30] find what the branham says
[39:31] the more you receive the word
[39:35] that's why it is so important young
[39:37] people we've
[39:38] got to receive the word when we sit in
[39:42] church like this
[39:43] and the minister ministers he's not just
[39:46] saying stuff
[39:48] i believe he's speaking as god he's
[39:50] directing him
[39:51] and he is god saying sith i need you to
[39:55] hear this
[39:56] because seth next week you're going to
[39:58] face something
[39:59] and this is going to help you so and i
[40:02] read it
[40:03] christ sent me to build tesla to the
[40:05] statue of jesus christ
[40:07] that dez will might be the powerhouse
[40:12] and the abiding place of the spirit
[40:15] by his word young people
[40:18] the word of god is so precious
[40:23] but it's also so important
[40:27] when you leave here this weekend and
[40:28] whatever was going to happen
[40:30] i want you you know i want you just to
[40:32] remember by the time i said
[40:34] that the word of god it's an extremely
[40:38] important part and it must be an
[40:41] important part
[40:42] of my daily diet
[40:46] i need to eat
[40:49] the right things you know those guys
[40:52] that goes and pumps iron
[40:54] if they go and they pump and they pump
[40:56] and they want to make them
[40:58] big muscles it's good if they go in
[41:00] they're going pump and
[41:02] do whatever they do but if they just
[41:05] feed
[41:06] on chocolates and sweets and ice creams
[41:10] and
[41:10] all the bad stuff they actually going
[41:14] against what their objective is
[41:16] but if they go in and they go and they
[41:18] you know do the stuff
[41:20] and they feed on the word of god
[41:25] it will strengthen you it will help you
[41:29] and i i the lord laid on my heart to
[41:32] tell the young people
[41:34] that you are precious to
[41:38] tell you that you are not some down
[41:41] trodden something that you just a young
[41:44] person
[41:44] just coming to church and sitting in
[41:47] church
[41:48] and just you know doing what all young
[41:49] people do
[41:51] but that you guys and sisters you are
[41:54] special
[41:56] there's something great with inside of
[41:58] you
[41:59] and you know what maybe you sit here
[42:01] tonight and you don't know that
[42:04] but that is why the devil fights you and
[42:07] i can tell you as i look at
[42:08] all of you including me none of you can
[42:11] say the devil is not fighting me
[42:14] because if you say the devils are
[42:15] fighting you that means maybe he's got
[42:17] you where he wants you
[42:20] because this is a it's a fight it's a
[42:22] battle
[42:24] we've got to take the sword of the world
[42:26] and fight and fight and fight and fight
[42:30] because that is what you are that's what
[42:33] we are
[42:35] we are warriors brother andy what he is
[42:38] in the army of god
[42:40] and no devil is going doesn't matter
[42:43] how young you think you are no devil
[42:48] is gonna keep you down because you know
[42:51] what
[42:53] while we are fighting right so i'm
[42:56] fighting the devil
[42:57] and i'm fighting this my back might be
[43:00] exposed
[43:01] but mike is standing behind me he's
[43:05] standing back to back
[43:06] and as i'm fighting mike is fighting as
[43:10] well
[43:12] so we fighting
[43:15] we're feeding brother branu says
[43:20] word fed and spirit-led
[43:24] and at the same time while we are being
[43:27] word-fed
[43:28] and we are spirit-led and we are growing
[43:32] we also helping our other young people
[43:37] because you know what you young people
[43:40] know more about each other
[43:44] than what some of us older people do
[43:47] so sometimes some of you guys know hey
[43:50] you know
[43:52] that young brother tez he's actually
[43:54] really
[43:56] he's struggling a bit
[43:59] you guys know you guys know who's going
[44:02] through stuff
[44:03] and it's not your job to go now and tell
[44:06] someone else about it
[44:08] gossip in this but it's your job as a
[44:11] real
[44:12] son of god daughter of god
[44:16] to take them to the lord to encourage
[44:19] them
[44:20] help each other you know what we did
[44:23] when i was in london
[44:25] we we we were dealing with them and i
[44:27] finished off with this
[44:28] finish off the two things when we were
[44:30] dealing with young people
[44:31] we found that some of our smaller ones
[44:34] were really struggling
[44:35] so what we did was we we spoke to the
[44:38] more older and more established and more
[44:41] mature young people
[44:43] and we told them you know what come come
[44:46] up with friends with these young ones
[44:47] just get to know them a bit and as they
[44:50] got to know them
[44:52] they started realizing the struggles
[44:53] that they were facing
[44:55] and that these these older ones
[44:58] could help help that obviously you can't
[45:02] force someone to grow but they could
[45:04] help
[45:05] because they they were closer to them
[45:08] so they knew how to help and that is
[45:11] what they did
[45:12] and today back home in the london church
[45:15] there's a beautiful powerful group of
[45:17] young people
[45:18] that really loves the lord and you know
[45:21] what i know as i look at you
[45:24] and then i look at you know even us
[45:25] older folk you know
[45:27] the the the is tremendous pleasure
[45:32] facing many of us a lot of times you
[45:34] know it's like
[45:35] you've got the pleasure to perform and
[45:38] you know pleasure to be a good
[45:42] message brother or pleasure to be a
[45:46] good message sister and when i sit in
[45:50] church i need to be able to
[45:51] you know sit in such a way and that when
[45:54] people look at me they
[45:56] say man that's a wonderful
[46:00] message young person i was one of those
[46:03] right that used to come into church
[46:05] and i used to sit and i was very pious
[46:09] and i was really you know praised the
[46:12] lord and i you know did all those sort
[46:14] of things
[46:16] but i was doing my bad stuff
[46:20] in the back and i i used to think i
[46:22] fooled a lot of the
[46:24] the older people but obviously i know
[46:26] now in hindsight i know i didn't
[46:29] because a lot of those older people they
[46:32] had discernment
[46:34] but they all said wisdom so sometimes
[46:37] they would come to me and say hey father
[46:38] tears
[46:39] how are you god bless you man how are
[46:42] you
[46:43] and as you'd say how about the god is
[46:45] good
[46:47] but then the brother said but i didn't
[46:49] ask you god i know god is good
[46:52] i want to know how you brother tess
[46:56] you know and and and and then those
[46:59] because they could see that where the
[47:00] tears was you know
[47:02] they didn't come and bash me but they
[47:04] they used wisdom
[47:07] and they helped me and that is why i am
[47:10] the crazy brother tears
[47:11] that you see here because i love jesus
[47:15] and i love him so much
[47:18] [Applause]
[47:21] that i wish you know i sometimes wish i
[47:24] could just take him and just
[47:25] force him inside every one of you
[47:29] but i do realize you know we've got to
[47:32] have our own personal
[47:34] experience with god so i just want to
[47:36] close up with this you know
[47:38] and i was talking about pressures of
[47:39] life and we we get faced with so much
[47:42] pressure and i was thinking of brother
[47:45] branham
[47:47] and i remember how many how many have
[47:50] heard from the brandon's life story i
[47:52] think most of us should have known
[47:54] would know his life story how he was you
[47:56] know carrying the water and he came to
[47:58] the tree and he
[47:59] heard the whirlwind and he heard the
[48:00] voice say don't drink or smoke or defile
[48:03] your body in any way
[48:05] and how brother branham tells you says
[48:07] he was
[48:08] nine years he says he was about nine or
[48:10] 10 years old
[48:12] and he was with his dad and and with his
[48:14] dad's friend and i'll finish off here
[48:16] with his dad and his dad's friend and
[48:18] and he says
[48:19] you know the dad's friend drank some
[48:21] whiskey
[48:22] and they passed on to the next person
[48:24] and took some whiskey
[48:26] and they passed it to brother branham
[48:28] but the branham said
[48:29] no i don't drink thank you and then they
[48:32] said what you were brand new and you
[48:34] don't drink
[48:36] something crazy there and so you know
[48:38] what brother brandon's daddy said
[48:40] he said yes he's a
[48:44] his own dad called him a
[48:47] and brother branham says you know it's
[48:48] probably probably i mean he was human
[48:50] right
[48:51] it affected him so much he said just
[48:52] give me that bottle
[48:54] or whatever it was and i'm gonna drink
[48:56] it he was under so much pressure
[48:59] and you know many times if we get faced
[49:01] with so much pressure
[49:04] friends looking at us and laughing and
[49:06] sniggering
[49:08] because we different if the plane said
[49:11] give it to me
[49:12] and he says as he was going to take it
[49:14] we know what happened right he
[49:16] heard that and then he dropped it
[49:19] and he ran and he says as he ran he
[49:22] heard
[49:23] laughing but you know what god was
[49:26] protecting him
[49:28] and that same god is protecting you and
[49:31] me
[49:32] i want to read this actually and then
[49:34] we'll then we'll then we'll go right
[49:36] we'll go we go read this and then what
[49:39] the brandon talks about
[49:41] he says he says um let me just find it
[49:45] yeah he says here he was about 17 18
[49:49] years old
[49:50] and then he says he he met this um you
[49:53] know you had this this girlfriend
[49:57] i get this girlfriend and he says
[50:02] you know he says how pretty she was
[50:06] she had eyes like a dove
[50:10] he said she had teeth like pearl
[50:14] and and this was his girlfriend was
[50:16] talking about it and a neck like a swan
[50:21] you know when he says i just love them
[50:24] the
[50:25] prettiest thing you've ever seen
[50:28] and he talks about this girlfriend that
[50:29] he had and then he says how one day you
[50:32] know they
[50:32] they went out and then he had to go to
[50:35] turn some bottles and he came
[50:37] back and he says as he came back he seen
[50:40] his
[50:41] beautiful girlfriend sitting in the car
[50:44] then
[50:44] smoking a cigarette and he said oh that
[50:48] just
[50:48] broke him and then this was
[50:51] she was there and the friends were there
[50:54] and then they said she said billy you
[50:56] wanna
[50:56] take a puff and he said no ma'am
[51:00] i don't smoke you had to take a stand
[51:03] right
[51:04] and then she says well i don't smoke at
[51:07] that other day and she made fun of him
[51:09] and
[51:09] probably the other buddies made fun of
[51:11] him and then the priesthood probably hit
[51:13] brother brandon and he said just give me
[51:15] that cigarette
[51:17] and he took the cigarette and i think i
[51:19] think he put it to his mouth
[51:21] and he was gonna light it and he says as
[51:24] i was gonna do that
[51:26] he heard that it was god coming and he
[51:29] says i dropped it on the ground
[51:31] and i cried and i ran
[51:34] and he says if you read it some of them
[51:37] they were following him and they were
[51:38] laughing at him
[51:40] but you see god was protecting that gift
[51:44] and i thank god today that brother
[51:46] branham
[51:47] he he became a success to them
[51:51] but look at what because of brother
[51:54] branham
[51:56] you and i can say that god is building
[51:59] us
[52:00] into a powerhouse so
[52:03] when stuff come your way and when
[52:06] pleasure comes your way
[52:08] listen god has got
[52:12] great things in store
[52:16] for each one of you
[52:19] no exception you might think you're
[52:23] insignificant
[52:24] you might think you this and you're
[52:26] nothing and you're not popular
[52:28] and maybe i can't sing
[52:31] i'll go i'll end up with this ayada uh
[52:34] freddie knows him there was a brother in
[52:37] our church
[52:37] back in south africa his name was
[52:40] brother selwyn
[52:42] and brother selwyn he came from a
[52:45] gangster
[52:46] background in fact his head
[52:49] was skewed because he was hit in the
[52:52] gang fight
[52:53] and his head was skewed and the lord
[52:56] changed his life
[52:57] and the lord just gave him the desire to
[53:01] sin
[53:03] and then saul wouldn't come almost every
[53:06] sunday friday
[53:07] you would come and you would want to
[53:09] sing for jesus
[53:10] and then you take that mic i found his
[53:14] brother brother glenn would play the
[53:15] piano
[53:16] and someone would start singing but man
[53:19] that brother sang
[53:20] false false false
[53:24] i think i mentioned it here when i was
[53:25] here last time to the small group he's
[53:27] saying
[53:27] false false false that even the musician
[53:31] struggled to follow him
[53:34] and then when he was finished he walked
[53:37] off and he was so happy and so proud
[53:39] he from his ears he was singing like an
[53:42] angel
[53:43] and then every time you put a salad and
[53:46] you know what after a while
[53:47] some of us would sit in the seat and we
[53:50] would
[53:51] laugh because when we hear freddy's the
[53:54] song lead sometimes and further said but
[53:56] the show was going to come and sing
[53:58] and then some of us would certainly
[53:59] yourself was going to see
[54:01] he got sick but he had that desire
[54:06] and you know one day i look closer for
[54:08] this one day
[54:10] there was a sister in the church with
[54:12] andy
[54:13] that had suffered with a blood disease
[54:18] and this sister was in church and she
[54:20] had the proof
[54:22] that she had this blood disease and god
[54:26] laden by the servant's heart
[54:28] to come and sing a song about the blood
[54:31] of jesus
[54:33] and brother salvin came up and he
[54:36] started singing as
[54:37] false as ever musicians couldn't
[54:41] follow him but he started singing
[54:44] for jesus and as he started singing the
[54:49] atmosphere in the building
[54:53] started changing
[54:56] and then that sister under that
[55:00] atmosphere felt something is happening
[55:04] to me and then
[55:06] something told that sister come up to
[55:08] the front
[55:09] and she came up to the front the poster
[55:12] laid hands on her
[55:13] prayed for her a couple of weeks later
[55:17] the sister came back with a report to
[55:20] say that the blood disease
[55:22] was gone
[55:26] gone gone gone
[55:31] because a young brother he's a deacon
[55:34] today
[55:35] a young brother said you know what i'm
[55:38] not going to bow to pleasure
[55:40] this word is too precious
[55:43] and too powerful i have to stand
[55:47] and even if i sing false and by the
[55:49] sound if you're hearing this
[55:51] god bless you we love you even if i'm
[55:53] singing false
[55:55] i'm singing this for jesus
[55:58] and we've seen the results that it
[56:02] produced so in closing
[56:05] the world is trying to produce
[56:09] a bunch of weaklings but each one of you
[56:13] from marian
[56:14] right through you are going to prove
[56:19] to everyone and to the devil
[56:23] that you are not going to be part of
[56:26] that
[56:26] statistics of weaklings
[56:31] there's going to be some they say the
[56:33] definition of a weakling
[56:34] is somebody that just bows to pleasure

[1:50:08] testimony as a young kid um my dad
[1:50:11] always hated me losing his sockets and
[1:50:13] his spanish
[1:50:14] and on a drive i lost two sockets and i
[1:50:16] sort of just i just brushed it off i was
[1:50:17] like
[1:50:18] i'll just find them it'll be fine you
[1:50:20] always find your tools you know you just
[1:50:21] leave them out sometimes
[1:50:22] they turn up i've been like two weeks
[1:50:24] and i'm just like okay i'm just gonna
[1:50:25] have to humble myself and pray
[1:50:27] and then like ten minutes later i just
[1:50:29] there's this voice it's just like
[1:50:31] look there and i was like weird climbed
[1:50:33] up there looked up there's my 24 more
[1:50:35] hardened soccer side man that was so
[1:50:37] fast and i was like
[1:50:38] i was like what about the other one god
[1:50:42] and so taught me now i've been like two
[1:50:43] weeks later and i was like that's so
[1:50:44] weird and then i was just cleaning up
[1:50:46] and i just like had this
[1:50:47] funny feeling i should look behind this
[1:50:48] massive square rock bolt washer i did my
[1:50:51] other socket was in i was just like i
[1:50:52] was so happy with that praise god like i
[1:50:54] found it it was like
[1:50:55] it's not until you surrender and ask god
[1:50:57] to help that he actually will like if
[1:50:58] you just go along and think i can do it
[1:51:00] well it probably won't happen so good
[1:51:02] for you eh just
[1:51:03] just gotta surrender and ask god because
[1:51:04] he will help you and he's he's always
[1:51:06] hearing
[1:51:07] what your prayers are so just ask and
[1:51:09] he'll give you what you want
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:19] is there anyone else that had a yes
[1:51:29] getting all um so i'm not very good at
[1:51:32] standing up in front of people um
[1:51:36] i have a short testimony
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:40] about let me think about this
[1:51:43] not this friday the previous friday i
[1:51:46] was um
[1:51:47] at work and where i work at work in a
[1:51:50] service center so you see a lot of
[1:51:51] different people but
[1:51:52] not a really a lot of different
[1:51:56] um i was in the smoker room getting
[1:51:58] coffee ready for
[1:51:59] the guys in the workshop and one of the
[1:52:02] truck drivers
[1:52:03] was waiting for his truck to be finished
[1:52:06] being fixed
[1:52:07] and i've seen him before and i know he's
[1:52:09] a christian and we've talked about it a
[1:52:10] couple of times when i've had to drop
[1:52:12] him off and things
[1:52:13] and this day he asked me
[1:52:17] you know what church do i go to and i
[1:52:18] said oh no rapture and grace tabernacle
[1:52:20] in stratford
[1:52:21] and then he started asking me these
[1:52:23] questions and i was just like
[1:52:24] i don't i don't like where this is going
[1:52:27] and
[1:52:28] i'm not a very open person i won't
[1:52:32] generally talk
[1:52:33] about the message or what i believe
[1:52:35] unless someone actually asks
[1:52:37] i'm just having grown up that way having
[1:52:39] it kind of forced
[1:52:40] down my throat and but making that
[1:52:42] decision for myself
[1:52:44] and just knowing how some people can
[1:52:48] find it i don't talk about unless
[1:52:49] someone asks
[1:52:51] and and i don't have a good way of
[1:52:53] explaining things
[1:52:54] to people so yes just not a good mix
[1:52:59] and um so this guy kept asking me and he
[1:53:01] said so
[1:53:02] why rapturing we're wrapped in grace and
[1:53:04] i was just like it's
[1:53:06] just the name of our building it's you
[1:53:08] know we believe in the rapture and
[1:53:10] i was just kind of like you know i'm i
[1:53:12] have to get back to work
[1:53:13] you know i don't actually have time to
[1:53:15] stand and talk and um
[1:53:18] so we're talking and talking and he
[1:53:19] asked me okay well what do you believe
[1:53:21] and i was like okay
[1:53:23] so you know so kind of trying to explain
[1:53:25] unless you know believe in the bible
[1:53:26] believe the whole bible we're bible
[1:53:28] believers
[1:53:29] and he said okay so what doctrine is
[1:53:31] like you know it's we believe in the
[1:53:33] bible
[1:53:33] you know it's there's no we don't you
[1:53:36] know
[1:53:36] yeah i don't have to explain it to you
[1:53:38] guys but uh
[1:53:40] and he always seems like so you read the
[1:53:42] bible i'm like yes i do
[1:53:44] and he says okay and he goes off on this
[1:53:46] tangent he says you know because the
[1:53:47] bible it's logical
[1:53:49] and i was like and i was like wait a
[1:53:50] minute that doesn't make any sense to me
[1:53:52] and he just like kept going on this way
[1:53:54] and
[1:53:55] and i said you know um well we believe
[1:53:57] you know we were seen
[1:53:58] a prophet an entire prophet so he kind
[1:54:01] of zeroes in on that
[1:54:02] and he just like goes off on this and so
[1:54:06] i say oh you know it's um
[1:54:07] we believe this man william branham you
[1:54:09] know he brought us his word and
[1:54:11] i could see on his face he knew exactly
[1:54:13] who i was talking about
[1:54:15] and i was just like oh no and he starts
[1:54:18] going off
[1:54:19] and i'm like okay and
[1:54:22] i was completely blindsided and i
[1:54:25] just like and he was going off and he's
[1:54:27] saying all these different things
[1:54:29] and and he's like saying how
[1:54:32] i don't even know how to explain it but
[1:54:34] everything he was saying i was like but
[1:54:36] that
[1:54:36] that doesn't make sense you know and he
[1:54:39] just keeps saying
[1:54:40] logic and all these different things and
[1:54:42] i was just like at one point
[1:54:44] because he started talking about brother
[1:54:45] brandon i was like i don't like what
[1:54:48] you're saying
[1:54:49] and i just said straight to him look i
[1:54:50] think we should just agree to disagree
[1:54:53] and he just kind of smiled and said he
[1:54:54] said okay i said yep right i have to go
[1:54:56] back to work
[1:54:57] so i live and i'm just like i'm actually
[1:54:59] angry and i'm just like
[1:55:01] it takes a lot to get me angry but i was
[1:55:04] so angry and i said slow because
[1:55:06] one of the things he said to me was i
[1:55:08] think you should rethink your belief
[1:55:10] what you believe i and i just like oh
[1:55:13] don't tell me what to believe you don't
[1:55:15] know me
[1:55:16] and i was just like i was so angry and
[1:55:19] then
[1:55:20] so i was just like thinking about this
[1:55:21] and i'm trying to work and i've got a
[1:55:23] lot on my plate at work and
[1:55:25] i'm trying to work and i'm not the whole
[1:55:27] time i'm just sitting i'm just like
[1:55:28] sitting in this like
[1:55:29] hi terry he's like and then he talks
[1:55:31] talk starts talking about brother
[1:55:32] branham
[1:55:33] and i'm like no and then all of a sudden
[1:55:36] i said well hang on one thing first the
[1:55:39] bible's not logic
[1:55:41] it's faith so i was like so i was
[1:55:43] sitting there at work having this little
[1:55:45] testimony there's a little revival
[1:55:47] and and then he was he was saying how um
[1:55:50] something about prophets and how it's
[1:55:51] like
[1:55:51] into the bible you know it's he went on
[1:55:53] a whole lot of different things
[1:55:55] and i just thought well hang on malachi
[1:55:57] 4 5 and 6.
[1:55:58] revelations 10 11 i was like thank you
[1:56:01] lord
[1:56:02] and then um bro andy was here last

[1:56:06] and i was actually not being sick the
[1:56:07] weekend so i just streamed the service

[1:56:13] for me thank you lord thank you and i
[1:56:14] was like exactly that's it and he
