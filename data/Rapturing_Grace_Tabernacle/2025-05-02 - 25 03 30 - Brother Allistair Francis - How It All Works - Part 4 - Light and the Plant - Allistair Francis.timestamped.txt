[26:02] Heat.
[26:08] [Music]
[26:12] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[26:29] Oh, how
[26:32] great how
[26:35] great is our
[26:40] God. Amen. Praise the
[26:43] Lord. Wonder if we can take our seats
[26:45] for a
[26:46] [Music]
[26:48] moment. It's a It's just been a
[26:51] wonderful camp, wonderful time. and we
[26:54] have our last official service and then
[26:57] this afternoon the testimony, but that's
[26:59] going to be a little more
[27:00] informal. But um I've just had a
[27:03] fantastic time over this weekend and and
[27:06] I love the down to- earthth practical
[27:10] way that the Lord spoke to us. Um but
[27:13] the wonderful thing is because the word
[27:15] like our brother said because the word
[27:16] is open we can look at the word from an
[27:19] open book perspective but if we can't
[27:21] apply it practically to our lives what's
[27:23] the point right amen and I just love how
[27:28] how all those things come together you
[27:30] need the teaching you need the rain you
[27:33] need that and and and that former rain
[27:36] is is still a bit of milk you know
[27:38] little by little until we until we grow
[27:41] up and then the teaching ing becomes
[27:43] stronger. But you can't just you can't
[27:45] just pour pour teaching on without all
[27:48] the other elements coming together. So
[27:50] we're so thankful that the Lord allows
[27:52] those things for us and and we are just
[27:55] the beneficiaries of his of his
[27:58] wonderful plan. It's a it's a privilege
[28:00] to serve the
[28:02] Lord. Um so I have a a whole bunch of
[28:06] things to get through this morning. So
[28:08] I'll I'll pre-warn you. I'll let the
[28:11] musicians relax. You can sit and relax
[28:13] and start playing, but otherwise you're
[28:15] going to be playing for a very long
[28:17] time. Um, so firstly, welcome Eugene and
[28:22] Flur. It's uh it's really good to see
[28:25] you. Um, for those of you who don't
[28:27] know, I think Eugene used to be song
[28:29] leader here, wasn't it? Yeah, that's
[28:31] right. Praise the Lord. So, that's been
[28:34] a while. So, they live in Perth now.
[28:38] [Music]
[28:39] Um
[28:41] something. What was that? You want to
[28:43] want to do some song
[28:50] leading? Praise the Lord. I've just
[28:52] really appreciated everything this
[28:54] weekend and and I want to say thank you.
[28:56] I'm not going to single anyone out, but
[28:58] so many people have done their part to
[29:00] let it all come together and I'm so
[29:03] grateful. I thank the Lord for you. Um,
[29:06] I also thank thank you for using your
[29:09] gifts and making it available and
[29:11] letting the Lord use it. So, I thank you
[29:14] very much for that and um, it's just
[29:16] been a blessing and I trust that no one
[29:18] feels like they were left out on the
[29:21] blessing because they were too busy or
[29:22] too tired. So, I really trust that the
[29:24] Lord will will just um, give us that
[29:27] injection of strength we need for this
[29:28] morning. I can feel my mind is a little
[29:30] tired. Um, and I'm sure many of you have
[29:33] the same situation, but um, we pray that
[29:35] the Lord will just supernaturally bypass
[29:37] those things and and really speak to
[29:39] your hearts.
[29:41] Okay. So, a few reminders and those of
[29:43] you whose memory is anything like mine,
[29:45] you want maybe want to take out some
[29:47] notebooks and make notes. Um, so
[29:51] firstly, I'll remind you no church on
[29:55] Wednesday. Also, no midweek prayer
[29:58] meeting on Tuesday morning this week.
[30:02] So those are the first two things. Um
[30:05] then also remember brother Tony Murray
[30:08] is here next Sunday. So he will be
[30:10] taking the Sunday service and then um
[30:13] between brother Adrien and brother
[30:15] Steven they will take the the other
[30:17] services while I'm
[30:19] gone.
[30:21] Um so just for interest sake who of you
[30:24] are going to the Easter services in
[30:26] Oakland? Can you maybe raise your hands?
[30:28] Let me get my idea. So one, two, three.
[30:33] Okay. So basically three families. So
[30:35] not not too many people will be gone.
[30:38] Okay. Um
[30:41] so God willing from from our travel
[30:44] perspective. So we we fly it. I actually
[30:46] only figured out this morning that Paul
[30:49] and I on exactly the same flight as
[30:50] brother Alistister from Sydney to
[30:53] Janisburg. So um we're flying out. So
[30:56] flying out to Sydney on on um well be
[31:00] flying out from New Plymouth on Tuesday
[31:03] um late afternoon and then out of
[31:05] Oakland on on Wednesday morning. Then
[31:08] we'll catch up with brother Alistister
[31:09] who will already be in Sydney um
[31:13] overnight. Um so also we God willing
[31:18] we'll be back in um Stratford on Easter
[31:22] Friday. So we we're away for two weeks.
[31:26] um back in Oakland on the Thursday night
[31:28] and then back in Stratford on on Easter
[31:31] Friday. Um which obviously by then the
[31:34] convention is already on on the go. Um
[31:37] so there's a also a few things happening
[31:40] um on Easter
[31:43] Saturday there's a
[31:47] wonderful now all the eyes are going to
[31:50] be on that for the next however
[31:52] long. Um, so on Easter Saturday there's
[31:56] a potluck tea at the Moyers. Um, so I
[32:02] I'm sure Mark will um put the the times
[32:05] and stuff on the social chat, but
[32:10] um maybe we'll ask the deacons to play
[32:13] bird catcher or something. Maybe we
[32:16] should ask the trustees.
[32:22] I know I know he's rejoicing with us,
[32:26] but um Melinda's not going to
[32:31] rejoice. Let's just leave that
[32:35] there. Um okay. So, so remember now
[32:39] Easter Saturday if you can think and
[32:42] look at the bird at the same time. Um
[32:45] Easter Easter Saturday we have a potluck
[32:48] at brother Bruce and Sister Kate's
[32:50] place. Um so um if you would like to be
[32:54] there and you're not on the social chat
[32:55] chat to Mark he will he will give you
[32:58] the the details of
[32:59] that. And then also a week later it's
[33:02] Anzac Day. Um, so on Anzac Day, it's
[33:06] something that we've been kind of
[33:09] planning last year and it didn't happen
[33:11] and and so on and we we'll try and do it
[33:14] this time. So on Anzac Day, we're going
[33:16] to do a progressive um day um and but
[33:22] with a little bit of a twist, we'll make
[33:24] it an international progressive day. So
[33:27] we have identified three countries. So
[33:30] we'll do three stops.
[33:33] um 1:00 in the morning kind of morning
[33:35] teaish time. Um and then we'll do a a
[33:38] lunch and then later afternoon
[33:42] um and um so the countries that we have
[33:46] identified was Moroccan, South African,
[33:50] Turkish. So at each of those stops,
[33:52] morning stop is going to be Moroccan,
[33:54] lunch stop is going to be South African
[33:56] and afternoon stop is going to be
[33:58] Turkish. And then the idea is that um
[34:03] the host family and their support
[34:05] families will cook food from that
[34:08] country um and also do some form of an
[34:11] activity or something associated with
[34:14] that country. So Mark is going to
[34:16] coordinate that again on the social
[34:18] chat. So if you're not on the social
[34:20] chat, speak to Mark to get those
[34:22] arrangements done. Where's the Where's
[34:24] the trustees? They're afraid of chasing
[34:26] the birds out.
[34:30] How do we do this? Do we Yes.
[34:36] I have no idea. I can't think like a
[34:38] bird.
[34:40] Um
[34:45] cardigan or something. Okay.
[34:51] No, but but seriously, um seriously, I'm
[34:54] I'll ask if the trustees can maybe
[34:59] Thank you. Thank you very much.
[35:00] Appreciate that. I know this is going to
[35:03] be a little distraction for a little
[35:04] while.
[35:15] There we go. Praise the Lord.
[35:17] [Applause]
[35:21] Thank you. Thank you everyone.
[35:24] Well, I'm thankful it happened now, not
[35:25] during this
[35:27] service. Um, okay. So, everyone's got
[35:30] that. That's Anzac Day. Um, then also I
[35:33] want to announce Well, time is running
[35:35] very quickly. I want to announce the
[35:37] arrangements for this afternoon. Um, so
[35:40] when when service finishes here, we'll
[35:44] um we need to give the the food team a
[35:47] uh a little bit of an opportunity to get
[35:49] lunch ready. But then after lunch um we
[35:52] we said 2:30, but if we're ready
[35:55] earlier, we can start earlier with um
[35:57] with brother Alistister's testimony. Um,
[36:00] and we'll see what the weather does, but
[36:02] the plan is that we just take some of
[36:05] the chairs from the lunchroom, lunch
[36:07] hall, and do it outside on the on the
[36:09] concrete area in front of the the dining
[36:12] hall. Um, so then we'll just sit around
[36:15] there and listen to that testimony. So,
[36:17] ideally, um, we will try to back up
[36:21] before then. Um, so, um, I know that
[36:25] there's going to be time before and
[36:26] after lunch, um, for you. So, if you
[36:29] want to maybe pack your cars, clean your
[36:32] rooms, um I'm sure Joseph will
[36:34] appreciate a hand with some he No,
[36:37] Joseph doesn't want the
[36:39] hand with the audio and video stuff, but
[36:43] I'm sure I'm sure Oh, Judah will
[36:45] appreciate a hand with backing the
[36:47] chairs back um and that kind of thing.
[36:50] So, if you can just see if you can give
[36:51] hands somewhere and maybe the food team
[36:53] also might appreciate some help.
[36:56] Um, so yes, any questions about this
[36:59] afternoon? Any questions about all the
[37:01] other
[37:02] things? Okay, praise the
[37:05] Lord.
[37:07] Um, then it
[37:10] is unbelievably end of
[37:13] March. So, we have uh some April
[37:16] birthdays and I'm not going to be here

[38:52] the Harvey family. Is that right? Okay.
[40:29] Um, hello everybody. Um, Brother Joseph,
[40:31] have you got the the words to the
[40:33] promise that I gave you the other day?
[40:53] Oh, that's good. Right
[41:05] there. Um, God bless everybody.
[41:09] Um really appreciated a text
[41:13] yesterday. Somebody said
[41:16] um notice I wasn't here and uh realized
[41:20] I've been sick and I'm still not good.
[41:23] But
[41:25] um they said
[41:26] the family camp's not quite the same
[41:28] without you. And I thought that was very
[41:30] special because it reminded me of
[41:33] um when I was back in primary
[41:38] school and uh I only ever missed one day
[41:42] of
[41:45] school. So, I got back the next day and
[41:47] we had a little
[41:49] assignment and um I took
[41:52] it to the teacher to get
[41:55] [Music]
[41:58] um to get marked and I was quite proud
[42:01] of what I'd done. And
[42:03] uh she said, "Thank you. That's very
[42:05] good, but uh go and sit down and be
[42:07] quiet because we had a really good day
[42:08] without you yesterday."
[42:12] And to this day, I couldn't never figure
[42:14] out what it was I'd done wrong. So, um,
[42:17] thank you, brother Jonathan, for that
[42:20] text. I'm still a bit hard of hearing.
[42:23] My head's a bit out, so
[42:30] [Music]
[42:41] The wealthiest farmer in
[42:48] Texas. Is this going

[42:59] [Music]
[43:11] the wealthiest farmer in
[43:14] [Music]
[43:15] Texas throwing a grand
[43:19] jubilee to honor his son who just turned
[43:23] 21. He came down from the
[43:28] east who was rumored he wanted to marry.
[43:34] Every girl in the county was
[43:39] there. He soon grew tired of their
[43:42] passion, their pride. Stepped outside
[43:45] for
[43:48] some. Was
[43:50] there there in the moonlight he saw
[43:57] her? Sorry. It was there on the backst
[44:01] step he saw her.
[44:04] The moonlight shine down on her
[44:07] face. She was washing the floor and
[44:10] stealing his poor heart
[44:18] away. What's the next one? He knew he
[44:21] would love her
[44:24] forever. They walked beneath the
[44:26] darkness of sky.
[44:30] He knelt as he asked her to
[44:34] marry. Then he watched as the tears
[44:36] sprang from
[44:40] bright. He feared she was going to
[44:43] refuse
[44:45] him. Please don't make a
[44:49] sound. Leaving tonight for
[44:54] Chicago. I must ride before the snow
[44:56] lies on the ground.
[45:01] was going there to build there to build
[45:05] you a
[45:08] mansion. Returning to make you my
[45:13] wife. Meet me there by the
[45:17] stables just one year from tonight.
[45:22] Let it be
[45:27] you. Let it be you.
[45:32] [Music]
[46:11] She worked long days in the kitchen.
[46:16] She worked with her needles each
[46:21] night till the day she walked down to
[46:24] the
[46:25] stables in the beautiful gown of pure.
[46:32] The girls they laughed and they mocked
[46:38] too. As the evening shadows
[46:43] fell, their laughter was turned into
[46:48] sorrow at the sound of the carriage on
[46:51] the
[46:54] trail. Bright she's made herself ready.
[47:00] Look now for the bridegroom
[47:05] is onto the marriage. Step up in the
[47:09] carriage and
[47:13] drive. Let it be
[47:19] you. Oh, let it be

[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:45] Precious heavenly father, Lord, eternal

[1:01:49] Lord. Yes, Father. Deep things, rich

[1:02:11] Lord, as they venture out into the the
[1:02:14] various areas that you've called them,
[1:02:16] Lord, may there be such an edification.
[1:02:19] May there be such a a great move of God,
[1:02:22] Lord. May it just bring glory to your
[1:02:26] name, Lord. And Lord, I just pray that
[1:02:28] they'll just push back all the darkness,
[1:02:30] Lord, that's around the people of the
[1:02:33] those that they meet, Lord. And Lord,
[1:02:36] for those that are already in the light,
[1:02:38] Lord, that they will receive more light
[1:02:40] and a greater revelation and a great
[1:02:42] vision of what this message is to
[1:02:44] produce, Lord God. Lord, a great
[1:02:46] marriage between a bridegroom and a
[1:02:48] bride, Lord. I pray, Lord, we commit
[1:02:50] them into your hands. And Lord, of every
[1:02:53] devil and everything that tries to
[1:02:54] hinder them, we bind them in the name of
[1:02:57] Jesus Christ for your glory, Lord. And
[1:02:59] we commit them into your hands, Lord,
[1:03:01] and say thank you, Lord, for what you've

[1:03:58] that song if you want to. Most wonderful
[1:04:01] and loving heavenly
[1:04:03] father. Lord Jesus, there's so many
[1:04:06] things we just had to touch on this
[1:04:08] morning, Lord. Father, we had a sense of
[1:04:13] humor and different things,
[1:04:15] Father. Oh God, but we ask that you will
[1:04:18] come on the scene for us now. We welcome
[1:04:21] you, oh Father. We I pray this morning,
[1:04:25] Lord, that the enemy will not be able to
[1:04:26] disturb our our fellowship with you,
[1:04:30] Lord Jesus, and that Lord, your word
[1:04:33] will reign in every heart, Father. Lord

[1:04:55] whatever reason, battles, maybe came
[1:04:59] here, maybe didn't want to come, Father,

[1:05:19] songs items. as we sung items, Lord. We

[1:05:30] And we ask these things in the precious
[1:05:31] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:05:35] A
[1:05:37] woman tried so
[1:05:40] many
[1:05:45] physicians, yet grew worse.
[1:05:49] her to
[1:05:51] Jesus. She
[1:05:57] came and
[1:06:00] made the
[1:06:02] crowd trying to restrain her.
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:09] He
[1:06:11] whispered these
[1:06:13] words
[1:06:17] through.
[1:06:19] All touching
[1:06:22] Jesus is all that really matters. Amen.
[1:06:28] Yes,
[1:06:30] Lord. And your
[1:06:32] life will never
[1:06:35] be the same.
[1:06:42] There's
[1:06:45] only one way to touch
[1:06:52] him. Just
[1:06:55] believe when you call on his name.
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:05] I was
[1:07:06] found when I now had the
[1:07:15] altar. Praise the
[1:07:18] Jesus could meet my every need.
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:27] In this
[1:07:30] present
[1:07:32] finally does
[1:07:37] Jesus set me
[1:07:39] free. Oh praise the
[1:07:42] Lord is free.
[1:07:48] Oh, touching
[1:07:51] Jesus is all that really
[1:07:59] matter. And your
[1:08:01] life will never
[1:08:05] be the same.
[1:08:11] Oh, there is
[1:08:13] only one
[1:08:16] way to touch
[1:08:19] [Music]
[1:08:21] him. Just
[1:08:23] believe when you call on his name. Now
[1:08:30] is the same as your brother comes. Now
[1:08:33] is the same.
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:37] Yesterday, today
[1:08:42] forever. He still
[1:08:45] remains the word
[1:08:48] today as he was
[1:08:53] there. And
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:16] Oh, touching
[1:09:19] Jesus is
[1:09:21] all really matters.
[1:09:27] and your
[1:09:29] life will never
[1:09:32] be the
[1:09:37] same. There is
[1:09:41] only one way to touch
[1:09:46] him.
[1:09:48] Hallelujah. Just
[1:09:51] believe when you
[1:09:54] call his name.
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:09:59] Amen. The Lord bless you. You may be
[1:10:03] seated. Once again, greetings in the
[1:10:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And uh
[1:10:08] trust you're all well and rested. I
[1:10:10] can't believe it's almost the end.
[1:10:13] Just started having a good time.
[1:10:17] But I certainly appreciate the the uh
[1:10:21] prayers of the saints and the
[1:10:23] fellowship.
[1:10:25] It was uh even the little walk in the
[1:10:27] dark last night to see the
[1:10:29] glowworms. Um it was uh really a good
[1:10:32] experience and good to be here with you
[1:10:35] all sharing the word of God.
[1:10:38] Amen. It looks like he's going to come
[1:10:40] to me now. That's where the light is.
[1:10:45] So um we just want to before get into
[1:10:50] the message just really thank brother Al
[1:10:53] once again for the invite and uh for the
[1:10:57] confidence and we just met briefly but I
[1:11:01] believe that God uh draws us together by
[1:11:04] the revealed word of the hour. It's not
[1:11:07] about our personalities. It's it's not
[1:11:10] about anything else. I think we
[1:11:12] recognize in each other the word of
[1:11:16] God and u obviously the seed that is
[1:11:19] within us.
[1:11:21] Um there's a brother there's a brother
[1:11:25] here who is uh in Canada with brother
[1:11:28] John Simon.
[1:11:30] Uh
[1:11:33] yeah. Uh I met brother John Simon once
[1:11:37] and he preached there in
[1:11:40] Durban and he started off preaching and
[1:11:43] he said we were all in the logos. Sons
[1:11:48] of God in attribute form a long time ago
[1:11:52] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:11:54] that's when the sons of God sang
[1:11:56] together and shouted for joy. He said,
[1:11:59] "How much more when we are in
[1:12:00] manifestation, those same attributes
[1:12:02] must come together. There will have to
[1:12:05] be shouting and singing and
[1:12:08] rejoicing. It shouldn't be division and
[1:12:11] distrust and suspicion
[1:12:13] because we were doing that in him in the
[1:12:15] beginning. It should be a manifestation.
[1:12:18] And that's why I really it I remember it
[1:12:21] after all these years. I still uh remind
[1:12:24] people of the same thing. So we
[1:12:26] certainly appreciate
[1:12:28] uh that God had us in his mind and that
[1:12:31] he purposed this that we could be
[1:12:34] together and expressing God's word.
[1:12:37] Amen.
[1:12:38] So without much ado, we want to conclude
[1:12:41] this subject. I trust that you know you
[1:12:45] may not realize it may have been it may
[1:12:49] look so
[1:12:50] simple but you may not realize how many
[1:12:54] doctrines we have spoken about
[1:12:58] in just simplicity
[1:13:01] I could list them all out for you and it
[1:13:02] and it's tremendous how much we spoke
[1:13:05] about when we spoke about ground we
[1:13:08] spoke about election
[1:13:10] chosen ground
[1:13:13] predestination mysteries that that have
[1:13:17] been hidden from generations. When we
[1:13:19] spoke about seed, we spoke about origin.
[1:13:22] We spoke about the logos. We spoke about
[1:13:25] eternal life. When we speak about water,
[1:13:27] we're speaking about the ministry. We're
[1:13:29] speaking about uh the five-fold
[1:13:31] ministry. We speaking about spoken word,
[1:13:33] which is the original seed. We we spoke
[1:13:36] about the air. We speak about the Holy
[1:13:39] Ghost. the difference between the gifts
[1:13:41] and and the actual nature of the Holy
[1:13:44] Ghost, the the spiritual aspect of the
[1:13:47] body, the church. So I just I hope while
[1:13:51] we spoke about this, you understand
[1:13:54] why this is not a religion,
[1:13:58] why it should not be perceived as a
[1:14:00] religion. It's it's reality
[1:14:03] and that we're not here following some
[1:14:06] just some idea.
[1:14:09] There is a reality that we must possess
[1:14:11] about all of this that we must grasp. It
[1:14:14] mustn't become like we're in a days just
[1:14:17] following a crowd. You must be conscious
[1:14:20] of what of what what is going on. So
[1:14:23] when when it comes to this part on
[1:14:25] light, this is the day that we are
[1:14:27] living in. And I what I really didn't
[1:14:31] like growing up in the message was that
[1:14:36] the the the major doctrines and I hate
[1:14:40] calling them doctrines because that it
[1:14:43] has a bad ring to it, you know, because
[1:14:47] people always seem to fight about
[1:14:49] doctrines and they label it that but
[1:14:52] don't really know what it is. Yeah. When
[1:14:55] you speak about the seven seals
[1:14:57] immediately like people recoil or the
[1:15:01] hair goes up on their back, you know,
[1:15:02] like a cat or like a dog and it's like,
[1:15:06] okay, I'm defensed now. What are they
[1:15:08] about to say? You know, it shouldn't be
[1:15:10] that way. And even when we speak about
[1:15:13] the thunders, it doesn't mean because
[1:15:15] some people label themselves thunders
[1:15:18] that now we have to recoil from it. No,
[1:15:20] it belongs to us and everything to do
[1:15:24] with this. So I want to even make it
[1:15:27] more plain so that the children will
[1:15:29] understand that it's this is not some
[1:15:32] buzzwords that only
[1:15:35] uh you know widely read intelligent
[1:15:38] people in the message can talk about.
[1:15:40] No, it's something so real, so basic for
[1:15:43] you when you apply it to the seed you
[1:15:46] understand what it is. Amen. So it's
[1:15:49] about light.
[1:15:51] It is light. Okay. So we actually saw it
[1:15:55] uh when they switched off the
[1:15:58] lights, right? And I'm and I'm going to
[1:16:01] explain that to you. So let's you all
[1:16:03] kind of know where everything is, right?
[1:16:05] You know where the chairs are. You were
[1:16:08] singing a little earlier and uh you know
[1:16:10] where sort of things are. You know where
[1:16:12] brother Joseph is in the back and the
[1:16:14] camera, right?
[1:16:16] Okay. Imagine if we switched everything
[1:16:19] off and even we switched the sun off
[1:16:21] outside and there was no light. Okay.
[1:16:25] What is your
[1:16:27] psychology? You're basically going to
[1:16:29] stand still. You're going to not move to
[1:16:33] the left or right. You cannot if you
[1:16:36] wave your hand, you might slap
[1:16:39] somebody. You you really have no
[1:16:41] confidence to go anywhere. And if you if
[1:16:44] I said all of you run around the room,
[1:16:48] you'll be filled with fear because you
[1:16:50] can't. You know, if you try to run,
[1:16:52] you'll crash over things. You'll fall
[1:16:54] down. You'll break an ankle or you'll
[1:16:56] hurt yourself. You can't. In other
[1:16:57] words, without light, you have no
[1:16:59] confidence,
[1:17:02] right? So then we put a small candle on.
[1:17:06] Remember, the sun is switched off. All
[1:17:08] the lights switch off. We put a small
[1:17:10] candle. Now you can all see the candle.
[1:17:12] Most people with fear are going to want
[1:17:14] to get closer to the light. And even
[1:17:16] with that little candle, you can just
[1:17:20] about
[1:17:22] shuffle. You still can't run around the
[1:17:25] room. If we start playing music, you
[1:17:28] still can't dance. You can't jump
[1:17:30] around. You can't swear. You can't clap.
[1:17:32] You can't walk around. You can't do that
[1:17:34] thing you were doing last
[1:17:37] night. Right? You can't because it's
[1:17:40] just a little bit of light. And then we
[1:17:44] switch on some some other lights. Maybe
[1:17:46] those side ones there. Now there's a
[1:17:47] little bit more confidence. Now you can
[1:17:49] see each other's faces. You kind of know
[1:17:51] where things are. You can clap. You can
[1:17:53] wave your hands. You can raise your
[1:17:55] hands. But if we put on all the lights
[1:17:58] and then we say run around. You can you
[1:18:01] can run around without bumping into each
[1:18:03] other. You can have more freedom.
[1:18:05] There's a lot more confidence. So what
[1:18:07] what happens when light starts to get
[1:18:10] brighter is it starts to expose
[1:18:12] everything
[1:18:14] and when everything is exposed and you
[1:18:17] can your vision is is full
[1:18:21] you have complete confidence. Now
[1:18:24] remember what what was bringing ability
[1:18:27] was anointing
[1:18:29] right? It's fine to have a you're
[1:18:32] standing in the dark with ability,
[1:18:36] but light is going to give confidence.
[1:18:39] Light is going to give vision. Light is
[1:18:41] going to is going to allow that ability
[1:18:43] to to be powerful to do whatever it can
[1:18:47] do. Uh whatever you were chosen to do.
[1:18:51] But what is the light? Where does our
[1:18:55] confidence come from? remember when you
[1:18:57] first came in from whatever culture you
[1:18:59] are, denomination or maybe you were an
[1:19:02] atheist and then you start learning the
[1:19:04] message. I I notice with people coming
[1:19:07] to the message um like now and they will
[1:19:10] come and sit down and say, "Brother
[1:19:12] Alistister, you know what? You guys are
[1:19:14] so far ahead of me. Uh you're talking
[1:19:17] about this seal and third pull and that
[1:19:19] I don't even know what you're talking
[1:19:20] about." And you can just see that lack
[1:19:21] of confidence. Yeah. And it's like
[1:19:24] they're watching. They're sitting there.
[1:19:26] Everyone saying amen. Amen. Yes,
[1:19:28] brother. And they feel left behind. And
[1:19:30] you can see that and like what can I do?
[1:19:32] What can I do to Now think about it.
[1:19:35] What can you do to get more confidence?
[1:19:38] You have the Holy Spirit moving. You
[1:19:41] have the Holy Ghost in the church.
[1:19:43] You've got worship right. The person is
[1:19:45] dressed right. The person is keeping all
[1:19:47] the rules. Why is he not feeling
[1:19:50] confident? Because of revelation.
[1:19:54] He's actually desiring revelation,
[1:19:57] right? And and you're preaching the
[1:19:59] word. You're teaching something. So, you
[1:20:01] already know what is light. It's divine
[1:20:04] revelation.
[1:20:06] You can have all the doctrine, all
[1:20:08] former and latter rain. It's coming.
[1:20:10] It's educating you. It's giving you
[1:20:12] knowledge. But light, revelation gives
[1:20:15] you confidence. Revelation exposes
[1:20:19] everything. Revelation removes all the
[1:20:21] darkness, all the spot, all the
[1:20:23] confusion,
[1:20:25] right? It's so it's like you take um
[1:20:27] let's take um any brother uh let's say
[1:20:32] he's not a carpenter and you have
[1:20:34] another brother who is a carpenter. So I
[1:20:36] don't know if you have these stores, we
[1:20:38] have some in in South Africa called Mr.
[1:20:40] Price and other things that uh they give
[1:20:43] you this DIY plan for a cupboard, right?
[1:20:46] You take a brother who's not a carpenter
[1:20:48] and there's the tools and the Allen keys
[1:20:50] and everything and the other guy who is
[1:20:52] a carpenter. This guy will assemble that
[1:20:55] cupboard without the plan.
[1:20:58] And the other one will and he will
[1:21:00] tighten here and then realize, oh my
[1:21:01] goodness, I was supposed to do this
[1:21:03] first. First put it together before I
[1:21:04] tighten. He's going to be done in 10
[1:21:06] minutes. He's going to be done in 3
[1:21:08] hours on exactly the same thing. What's
[1:21:11] the difference? He's got a revelation.
[1:21:14] Amen.
[1:21:16] He just has the plan and the theory.
[1:21:19] He's got a revelation. He's more
[1:21:21] powerful. He's more effective with the
[1:21:23] revelation.
[1:21:25] Right? That's the difference between
[1:21:27] people who just have whole bunch of
[1:21:28] theory, whole lot of teaching and no
[1:21:31] light.
[1:21:34] Amen. So light comes in three waves. So
[1:21:37] I want to begin with reading our
[1:21:39] scripture.
[1:21:42] This then is the message which we have
[1:21:44] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:21:47] God is light. We sang all those songs
[1:21:50] today about light. Thank you brother.
[1:21:53] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:21:56] at all. God is light.
[1:21:59] God is
[1:22:00] revelation. Divine revelation. If we say
[1:22:04] that we have fellowship with him verse
[1:22:05] six and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:22:09] not the truth. This guy's competing with
[1:22:13] me. But if we walk in the light as he is
[1:22:17] in the light, we have fellowship one
[1:22:19] with another. Do you know what that
[1:22:21] means?
[1:22:23] If we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:22:25] light, we actually connect. Fellowship
[1:22:29] means to be one. That's right. Right. We
[1:22:32] we can be united. As long as there's
[1:22:35] revelation, we can be united. You can
[1:22:37] you understand how you have the same
[1:22:39] Bible. People read the same Bible and
[1:22:42] cannot have fellowship. They just have
[1:22:44] argument. They have disagreements
[1:22:46] because the written word does not unite.
[1:22:50] Only light can unite you. Only
[1:22:53] revelation can unite you. Can make you
[1:22:55] one because you can read written word
[1:22:59] forever and ever and you'll keep forming
[1:23:01] new
[1:23:02] denominations. But there is a fellowship
[1:23:04] of the mystery. There is a union. There
[1:23:07] is a unity. And only that light is going
[1:23:10] to bring it together.
[1:23:12] What's more is that light does something
[1:23:14] for the plant we've been talking about.
[1:23:17] Amen. So I want to and for the children
[1:23:20] and for young people and new people, I
[1:23:22] want to identify to you what that light
[1:23:25] has been by the stages of the plant.
[1:23:29] Amen. Okay. So the light comes in three
[1:23:33] stages. So, let's look at this plant
[1:23:36] again. All right. So, here it is. Here's
[1:23:38] everything together. You've got the
[1:23:40] rain. You've got the ground. You We saw
[1:23:42] how the the the rain and the ground work
[1:23:44] together, right? To the seed to pull in.
[1:23:48] And then we have the air and the light
[1:23:50] working together with the ground as well
[1:23:53] and working together with the rain. And
[1:23:55] it all works together. But think of your
[1:24:00] life when you started in the message.
[1:24:02] How did the
[1:24:04] seed receive power? The re the seed has
[1:24:08] to receive power. Do you know the seed
[1:24:11] has to have light while the the seed is
[1:24:13] in the ground under the ground? Uh so
[1:24:17] those of you kids, you want to do a
[1:24:19] science
[1:24:20] experiment. You uh take a seed, take a
[1:24:24] box, put a put uh some uh sand inside,
[1:24:27] soil, good soil. Bury that seed, cover
[1:24:30] it in darkness, and then cut a hole in
[1:24:33] the side of the
[1:24:35] box. It's complete darkness inside. That
[1:24:38] plant will grow out sideways
[1:24:41] to the light. While the seed is in
[1:24:44] darkness in the ground,
[1:24:47] the light gives it direction.
[1:24:51] Amen. It will grow towards the light. So
[1:24:54] light you don't even know when
[1:24:56] revelation is striking though the seed
[1:24:58] is in darkness the light is giving the
[1:25:01] seed direction.
[1:25:03] You'd never nature expresses it,
[1:25:08] right? It's a good probably a good
[1:25:10] exercise if you ever do something like a
[1:25:13] youth camp. But it shows you what light
[1:25:15] what what the light is. So let's start
[1:25:16] with the first wave of light. Here's the
[1:25:19] first wave.
[1:25:21] This is you take any believer, you got
[1:25:23] the seed in you. Now I I put there the
[1:25:25] seven church ages. Can you see that?
[1:25:27] Yeah. Seven church ages. But what is the
[1:25:30] seven church ages? Uh I would say to
[1:25:33] young people when you are wanting to
[1:25:36] become more confident in God's word,
[1:25:38] your seven church age book is your
[1:25:40] manual for life. It's the beginning.
[1:25:43] It's the light that brings you. Why?
[1:25:46] Because the seven church ages starts
[1:25:48] with the sevenfold glory of his person.
[1:25:50] It's introducing you to Christ. It's
[1:25:52] introducing you to the the attributes of
[1:25:54] Christ, right? His eyes the flame of
[1:25:56] fire, his hair is white as snow, the
[1:25:58] feet of fine brass, he which was dead
[1:26:01] and which is alive and all the sevenfold
[1:26:04] glory of his person. And then it goes
[1:26:05] through all the seven church ages. But
[1:26:07] in every seven in every age, the prophet
[1:26:10] is teaching every single doctrine. is
[1:26:12] teaching baptism, godhead, serpent seed,
[1:26:15] lamb's book of life, like everything
[1:26:18] that you need to know for the seed to
[1:26:20] start to start swelling within the
[1:26:22] ground to take root. If you don't read
[1:26:26] those church ages, that church ages is
[1:26:28] light for for you to even start
[1:26:30] germinating.
[1:26:32] What What is it? What else is there
[1:26:34] about the seven church ages? There's the
[1:26:36] son of man ministry. It's basically the
[1:26:39] light that started you as God sent a
[1:26:41] prophet.
[1:26:42] You have to recognize the prophet. You
[1:26:45] have to recognize the prophet as the son
[1:26:46] of man ministry in this last day. That's
[1:26:49] the light that starts you even going
[1:26:51] amongst the believers of the bride in
[1:26:54] this day. That's the beginning light.
[1:26:57] And you can't live in that in that light
[1:27:00] forever and ever. That's your starting
[1:27:02] light. That's the light that that
[1:27:05] excites the ground and starts giving the
[1:27:07] seed direction to grow.
[1:27:10] It's not going to make you someone who's
[1:27:11] obsessed with the prophet, but
[1:27:13] definitely recognizing the message as
[1:27:16] the light that you need to follow.
[1:27:18] That's going to give you confidence.
[1:27:20] This is going to tell you about
[1:27:22] everything about the message. It gives
[1:27:24] you the principles of the message. It
[1:27:26] gives you the early doctrines. It gives
[1:27:28] you cood. It's giving you direction.
[1:27:31] This first light stimulates the ground.
[1:27:36] Can you see it?
[1:27:38] dress right, dress holy, act holy, speak
[1:27:43] holy. It's the first light. It's giving
[1:27:45] you revelation. The whole idea of the
[1:27:49] seven church ages is what? It's giving
[1:27:51] you the light of development.
[1:27:54] Ephesus to
[1:27:56] Leodysia. It's putting in you the
[1:27:59] confidence. You're going to know what it
[1:28:01] is like to begin by faith with
[1:28:03] absolutely zero knowledge. Just have
[1:28:06] faith. and then add to your faith virtue
[1:28:09] right it's going to give you that
[1:28:11] revelation so this is the first light
[1:28:13] you want to begin with I want to read a
[1:28:15] quote for you from it is the rising of
[1:28:17] the sun watch how brother combines light
[1:28:21] with the earth with the now as the sun
[1:28:24] was sent across the earth not to bring
[1:28:26] rocks which was dirt also to life
[1:28:31] whole he's going to bring the dirt to
[1:28:34] life with Right?
[1:28:37] He he actually tells you what your
[1:28:39] experience is. Remember the dirt was
[1:28:40] full of smut and filth and smelly stuff
[1:28:43] and all the nutrients in it and but when
[1:28:46] the seed was planted it made the earth
[1:28:48] elected earth chosen earth. It was not
[1:28:52] to bring all the dirt to life which
[1:28:54] means thankfully some of our stuff is
[1:28:56] going to fall off us. Praise be to God.
[1:28:59] Our negatives will be left behind. The
[1:29:01] rest will be glorified for the
[1:29:02] millennium. Look what he says. but was
[1:29:05] to bring the part of the dirt which was
[1:29:08] enclosed around a life.
[1:29:12] The light was going to do that. Not all
[1:29:15] men will receive Christ. Oh no. But
[1:29:17] those which God fore orained is housed
[1:29:20] around some of the dirt of earth. That's
[1:29:23] the one he comes to quicken.
[1:29:26] This is beautiful. I know. You know, I
[1:29:29] like the the part where brother says the
[1:29:31] um the Holy Ghost takes all the
[1:29:33] negatives away.
[1:29:35] There's parts of us that we will shed.
[1:29:39] There's the negative aspects, you know,
[1:29:42] because I come from an Indian
[1:29:44] background. It's like I have investments
[1:29:46] in uh um uh cardiology
[1:29:51] problems. It comes with my genetics. You
[1:29:54] know, heart disease among Indians. It's
[1:29:57] just there. you we have investments in
[1:29:58] that part of the hospital. Uh all our
[1:30:02] other people have different things but
[1:30:04] that's going to drop away.
[1:30:07] You know there may be some other issues
[1:30:09] maybe low iron or something there or
[1:30:12] something wrong with the brain or some
[1:30:13] genetics that's going to drop away.
[1:30:15] There may be superstition in my my
[1:30:18] background. There may that lack of faith
[1:30:21] that light will hit that out. That light
[1:30:24] will will quicken only the dirt that is
[1:30:27] that is needed. See and close around the
[1:30:30] life. It will drop away the negatives
[1:30:33] and it will it will bring a revelation
[1:30:36] to that which is needed for the seed.
[1:30:38] Imagine he says this in rising of the
[1:30:40] sun. Those which God for ordained life
[1:30:44] is housed around some of the dirt. Uh uh
[1:30:47] that's the one he comes to quicken. So
[1:30:49] that quickening light. Amen. They're the
[1:30:51] ones he continues said that now that
[1:30:53] dirt which lay there in the sun said oh
[1:30:56] this old sun is so hot that's what
[1:30:58] happens the light the light starts
[1:31:00] affecting the dirt this old sun is so
[1:31:02] hot that rock say that old sun is so hot
[1:31:04] but that little seed said that's what
[1:31:06] I'm looking for and it begin to spring
[1:31:09] forth to life it quickened that part of
[1:31:11] the dirt because the sun was sent not to
[1:31:14] quicken the rock not to quicken the dirt
[1:31:16] but to quicken the life of the seed and
[1:31:18] the life in the seed begin to quicken
[1:31:20] the dirt. See, there's the the sea is
[1:31:22] going to respond to revelation.
[1:31:25] There's there's going to be and what is
[1:31:26] revelation? Somebody speaks to you and
[1:31:28] calls you and tells you God sent a
[1:31:30] prophet and then they start telling you
[1:31:32] what the prophet said and you don't care
[1:31:35] about this prophet. You don't even care
[1:31:37] about this person telling you that. But
[1:31:39] something about what he's telling you is
[1:31:41] quickening something inside. You can't
[1:31:43] explain it. It's not theory. It's light.
[1:31:47] It's divine revelation. It's not
[1:31:49] explained. You go to your family and
[1:31:51] tell them, "I heard this this uh thing,
[1:31:53] this message thing by this man, William
[1:31:56] Brandon, they tell you he's a cult. Stay
[1:31:57] away from him." But something is
[1:31:59] stirring inside you. Something rings
[1:32:02] true. You can't explain it. And you find
[1:32:04] yourself giving that brother a call. You
[1:32:06] know, I want to talk more about that.
[1:32:08] You don't know because the light is
[1:32:10] affecting like that seed inside this
[1:32:12] box. It's moving towards the light. If
[1:32:15] you don't keep moving towards the light,
[1:32:16] you will constantly be dissatisfied.
[1:32:19] You'll be sitting there in that dark
[1:32:20] place and you be thinking, you'll be
[1:32:22] listening to some denominational
[1:32:23] preacher message and then you think, I
[1:32:25] don't need to be here. Something is not
[1:32:27] ringing true. I don't want to hear about
[1:32:29] politics and Psalm 23 every single
[1:32:32] Sunday and you know, Proverbs that and
[1:32:35] there's something that that brother was
[1:32:37] telling me about. It's I want to know
[1:32:39] more about that. It's a seed responding
[1:32:42] and the seed starts quickening the earth
[1:32:44] to follow.
[1:32:47] That's what revelation does. It puts
[1:32:50] confidence into the ability that is
[1:32:52] already there. Praise be to God. I love
[1:32:55] this. And then he says, "And now see now
[1:32:58] you are ready. You are already
[1:33:00] resurrected. When God raised him up, he
[1:33:02] raised you. The sun s o n is just now on
[1:33:06] you. Now you're growing into a blossom
[1:33:09] life plant like he was to be resurrected
[1:33:14] completely in the last day. Your
[1:33:16] potentials you have now. Amen. Why do
[1:33:20] you know? Your soul changed, didn't it?
[1:33:25] Your body come in obedience. The ground
[1:33:27] come in obedience because your soul
[1:33:29] changed. And what caused it? Light
[1:33:32] caused it. Amen. In obedience to what? A
[1:33:35] church. the word which is the life. Then
[1:33:39] you are now resurrected from the dead.
[1:33:41] It is Easter. I love this message rising
[1:33:45] of the sun and Easter seal because he's
[1:33:47] talking about it is Easter with you, I,
[1:33:50] and Jesus. It is a personal Easter. A
[1:33:53] personal resurrection. The seed fell
[1:33:56] into the ground. It died. Light hit it
[1:33:59] and resurrection took place. That is a
[1:34:02] real Easter message right there. When
[1:34:04] light strikes the earth and life comes
[1:34:07] out, that is Easter with you and I.
[1:34:10] Easter with Jesus and I. Don't you love
[1:34:12] him, saints? So, in this first wave of
[1:34:14] light, the body can feel the effects of
[1:34:17] the
[1:34:18] seed. Now, you you were stuck in
[1:34:20] darkness for so long and you heard
[1:34:23] somebody tell you about the message and
[1:34:24] they start telling about the seven
[1:34:26] church ages. Maybe like a good message
[1:34:28] denominational. You know, somebody was
[1:34:31] telling you God sent a prophet. Do you
[1:34:33] know triple 6? Do you know about serpent
[1:34:34] seed? And you're standing there and
[1:34:36] you're getting hammered like what is
[1:34:38] going on? First this prophet, then
[1:34:41] triple six and yeah, mark of the beast.
[1:34:43] And you're like, oh, oh, that's
[1:34:44] interesting. Still, there's like there's
[1:34:46] a little bit of stirring there, but a
[1:34:47] little bit of like this, who's this guy?
[1:34:50] He's a little bit creepy, you know. And
[1:34:52] then he starts and he starts telling you
[1:34:53] about soap and seed and that grabs you.
[1:34:55] You know, I always thought it wasn't an
[1:34:57] apple. And uh and then the ground starts
[1:35:00] stirring and then you can feel something
[1:35:03] bodily taking place. Wasn't an apple and
[1:35:05] and then he hits you with blood lines
[1:35:07] were crossed. Are you kidding me? How
[1:35:10] can it be that? Immediately your body
[1:35:12] some parts of you are saying no no no.
[1:35:14] Come on. That's a terrible story. And
[1:35:16] then we were warned of that. That was
[1:35:17] like a heresy and so on. But something
[1:35:19] inside you don't know because the seed
[1:35:23] responds to that light. It responds to
[1:35:26] that revelation. You cannot even explain
[1:35:29] to me. You can try, but you can never
[1:35:32] really explain to me the same way you
[1:35:34] can't explain why you love your wife.
[1:35:36] You cannot explain to me how when the
[1:35:39] message hit you the first time, you knew
[1:35:41] it was the truth.
[1:35:44] You didn't know it was the truth, but
[1:35:47] something responded and pulled you and
[1:35:50] kept pulling you. and your body, this
[1:35:52] earth was stirred up and kept
[1:35:54] responding. Just even when you didn't
[1:35:57] want to, your feet were just being
[1:35:59] dragged towards it. Amen. Get to that
[1:36:01] church. Go find that brother. Go talk
[1:36:03] about it again. Go ask another question.
[1:36:06] Light is stirring the ground. Amen.
[1:36:10] Isn't it wonderful how it works
[1:36:12] together? And in this first wave, the
[1:36:15] body feels the effects of the seed
[1:36:18] coming to life. Simply put, it's when
[1:36:20] your soul recognizes the message of the
[1:36:23] hour as the word for that day, for God's
[1:36:26] day. It stimulates the body to follow
[1:36:29] the message so that the seed can have a
[1:36:32] chance to grow. Now, you don't know.
[1:36:34] What you don't know is your body is
[1:36:36] making it more possible for the seed.
[1:36:39] Your body's dragging you to church. Your
[1:36:41] body's actually dragging you to read
[1:36:43] something. I mean, who wants to read
[1:36:45] this boring blue book with no pictures?
[1:36:48] Really, come on. Give us some pictures
[1:36:51] and, you know, cartoons or give us some
[1:36:54] audio. You open the page and it's just
[1:36:57] words. Most humans don't like
[1:37:00] it. What is pushing you to do something
[1:37:02] you don't even like. Most most people
[1:37:05] will tell you, "I'm just not a book
[1:37:06] person. Never read a book in my life."
[1:37:08] Now, you can't get enough of this stuff.
[1:37:11] And this guy doesn't even speak proper
[1:37:13] English, you know. Well, sometimes that
[1:37:17] appeals to us that he's he looks he
[1:37:19] sounds just like me, you know, and I'm
[1:37:22] reading, hey, some of it is so funny
[1:37:25] going on and I don't realize while I'm
[1:37:28] getting through, it's still appealing to
[1:37:30] me. It's stirring up more. There's light
[1:37:33] happening, right? And so the body
[1:37:36] responds so that the seed gets more
[1:37:38] chance to give off its life. Glory to
[1:37:41] God. Some people who are not
[1:37:44] seed, they have no seed inside. They're
[1:37:47] just ground. Even they get excited
[1:37:50] because the light still stirs up ground.
[1:37:52] It starts drying stuff up. Plus, they're
[1:37:54] receiving rain. They're going through
[1:37:56] this emotions of being wet and dry and
[1:37:58] wet and dry. You know, it's that's what
[1:38:00] church goes through because it's given
[1:38:03] freely. We read the quote yesterday
[1:38:05] where he says, "My the sun shines on
[1:38:08] everything with no compromise. The rain
[1:38:11] is poured out on the just and the
[1:38:12] unjust. That's what Christ said. So
[1:38:15] there'll be people who may even respond
[1:38:17] towards us but just have no seed inside.
[1:38:21] That's what happens in the this end
[1:38:23] time. The first wave of light, saints,
[1:38:26] is so important because it tells the
[1:38:29] seed which is not exposed. The seed is
[1:38:32] hidden. You still don't even know
[1:38:34] yourself. You don't have your identity
[1:38:35] yet. You just have this inclination. You
[1:38:39] can't describe it. This feeling, this
[1:38:41] desire, this knowing, you know, I
[1:38:44] remember when my dad went um when he got
[1:38:48] came into the message. This is his
[1:38:50] testimony. And
[1:38:52] um he came to in fact he didn't he he
[1:38:56] also wasn't the one who told him who
[1:38:58] told me this. His brother his older
[1:39:00] brother told me this. He says, "Your
[1:39:03] father,
[1:39:04] uh, in fact, my uncle before he died, he
[1:39:07] told me, uh, he was a drunkard and
[1:39:10] scientist at the same time. He told me,
[1:39:13] "There's only one Christian I know, and
[1:39:14] that's your father." He said, "You got a
[1:39:16] long way to
[1:39:17] go." He said, "That man is a real
[1:39:20] Christian." So I said, "Hey, Uncle Al,
[1:39:22] why?" His name was Alec. Alec. So I I
[1:39:25] said, "What?" He said, "Let me tell you
[1:39:27] about that guy. We We were Hindus. He
[1:39:30] was studying to be a priest." He said
[1:39:31] one day he comes to me and tells me I
[1:39:34] saw the
[1:39:36] light and then he tells me he's becoming
[1:39:38] a Christian. He said as soon as he
[1:39:39] turned around I hit him in the back of
[1:39:41] the head with a golf club laid him out
[1:39:44] and said now are you seeing the
[1:39:48] light? He said he just stood up, packed
[1:39:51] his
[1:39:52] bags. His my dad's mother packed his
[1:39:55] bags and threw his bags out and said get
[1:39:57] out. You're not allowed here. and he
[1:40:00] just didn't say anything, walked away
[1:40:03] and just kept loving them no matter what
[1:40:07] they said or did to him to the very end.
[1:40:09] My grandmother was was a Hindu
[1:40:12] spiritualist in the Hindu faith and
[1:40:15] would come to my house and join our
[1:40:17] family altar. And sometimes she would
[1:40:20] stay with us while my parents were
[1:40:21] overseas preaching. She would insist
[1:40:24] that we keep our family altar. And one
[1:40:26] day I said to her, I said, "Grant, why
[1:40:28] don't you come and visit us more often
[1:40:30] and spend time with us?" She said,
[1:40:32] "Because I know you are okay. I know
[1:40:36] your dad is a real happy man. He loves
[1:40:40] his wife. His wife loves him." He says,
[1:40:42] "It's not," she said, "It's not the same
[1:40:44] with my other children. You have a happy
[1:40:47] family." And from that day when they
[1:40:50] kicked him out, they didn't expect him
[1:40:52] to be so happy. They respected us right
[1:40:55] till the very end to the point of my
[1:40:57] grand even giving her heart to the Lord
[1:41:00] in secret.
[1:41:02] Uh so her family wouldn't even know and
[1:41:06] and criticized but all the sons and
[1:41:08] daughters were really really
[1:41:11] anti-Christian. But um I'm just saying
[1:41:15] you can't explain when you tell someone
[1:41:18] you've seen the
[1:41:19] light. You can't explain it. You just
[1:41:23] have you you got no theory. You you you
[1:41:25] can't explain how the the word of God is
[1:41:29] better than the religion you came out
[1:41:31] from. You've just you're giving up.
[1:41:34] Maybe some of you, most of you here
[1:41:36] probably came from Christian
[1:41:37] backgrounds. You've got no idea what
[1:41:39] it's like coming from a totally Hindu
[1:41:42] anti-Christian background to even
[1:41:45] Christianity.
[1:41:47] Coming from South
[1:41:49] Africa where South Africa was controlled
[1:41:52] by aparate and we are Indians or
[1:41:55] non-white. Do you know what it's like in
[1:41:58] our family for them to tell us you have
[1:42:00] a white
[1:42:02] prophet who tells you a Jew is
[1:42:05] God? You people
[1:42:07] are you know it's like the biggest
[1:42:10] letdown in our race in our culture. It's
[1:42:13] like these people subjected us to
[1:42:16] aparate and you have a white prophet.
[1:42:18] That's like a slap in the face. The
[1:42:20] worst slap in the face. And then your
[1:42:22] god is a
[1:42:25] Jew. How do you explain?
[1:42:28] It's only light.
[1:42:30] They're actually asking you to reach in
[1:42:33] and feel racial
[1:42:36] uh hatred and and and be have some
[1:42:39] solidarity with them because of whatever
[1:42:43] uh they went through in their past. But
[1:42:45] they're asking us to side with them. And
[1:42:47] here am I standing there and I'm just I
[1:42:50] I have light. I have light in my soul. I
[1:42:54] I can see what is truth. I don't see
[1:42:56] what you're seeing. I don't feel what
[1:42:58] you feel. I don't care about all of that
[1:43:01] because light has struck. There's no
[1:43:04] explanation. There's no theory. That's
[1:43:07] the experience we've got to have from
[1:43:09] the beginning. When I see the prophet, I
[1:43:11] don't care about his nationality, about
[1:43:14] his race, but where it comes from.
[1:43:17] Something he says struck something in my
[1:43:20] soul and it ignites it. It moves me.
[1:43:24] Yes. It makes me passionate about it. It
[1:43:26] gives me confidence. It gives me a new
[1:43:29] identity
[1:43:30] and that new identity makes me deny
[1:43:33] whatever old identity I had.
[1:43:36] Amen. Saints, that is beyond theory and
[1:43:40] indoctrin uh indoctrinating people. It's
[1:43:45] beyond that light is necessary for the
[1:43:48] plant to grow. Praise be to God. First
[1:43:51] wave of light is so important because it
[1:43:53] tells the seed which is not yet exposed
[1:43:56] to light. It's it's stuck in the ground
[1:43:58] below ground level. And it's so
[1:44:00] important the seed can tell by how the
[1:44:03] ground is stimulated in which direction
[1:44:05] to go to go. So you see how is the seed
[1:44:09] stuck in the box. It cannot see any
[1:44:12] light. The light is hitting the ground.
[1:44:14] How does the seed know? Because the
[1:44:16] ground gets stimulated. The ground
[1:44:18] senses the the seed senses the
[1:44:20] stimulation in the ground. Something is
[1:44:23] different. Uh if I had to start
[1:44:26] explaining it
[1:44:27] biologically, organisms in the ground
[1:44:30] will start tending towards the light.
[1:44:33] Are you seeing that? Let's imagine that
[1:44:34] box seed there. Seed is there. You cut a
[1:44:38] hole there. organisms in the ground, all
[1:44:40] those nutrients and bacteria and start
[1:44:42] they start responding to the light and
[1:44:44] the seed starts sensing and then the
[1:44:46] seed start the stalk coming out of the
[1:44:49] seed will start moving towards the light
[1:44:50] because it's sensing whatever
[1:44:52] stimulation is happening in the ground.
[1:44:55] That's how it works. But the seed itself
[1:44:57] is not yet seeing the light,
[1:45:00] right? But obviously the seed itself
[1:45:03] already has light in it
[1:45:08] because it's got the life in it. Amen.
[1:45:11] Don't you love him? Which brings us to
[1:45:14] the second
[1:45:16] wave. Now this stalk comes out of the
[1:45:19] ground. It's into atmosphere. In other
[1:45:22] words, you're just got comfortable.
[1:45:24] You're in the church. You're comfortable
[1:45:27] with the name William Brandom. You're
[1:45:30] comfortable with the message of the
[1:45:31] hour. You're comfortable with the
[1:45:33] people. You You're more confident.
[1:45:35] You're moving better. You're singing.
[1:45:37] You're clapping your hands. You're
[1:45:38] giving song specials. You still don't
[1:45:40] know everything.
[1:45:42] But you're just a stalk. You're coming
[1:45:44] out. You're getting used to churches.
[1:45:47] You're so brand new. You don't know
[1:45:49] about Peruia and Seven Thunders and Two
[1:45:54] Lords. And you're just content. You're
[1:45:56] just so happy you found his family.
[1:45:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:01] Amen. You're not, no one has ever
[1:46:04] prepared you. Then you start hearing
[1:46:05] people talk about, you know, this
[1:46:07] doctrine and that. You're thinking, my I
[1:46:10] just got here. What are these people
[1:46:12] talking about now? Just pushed out of
[1:46:14] the ground. And now you're exposed to
[1:46:15] the air and you're exposed to the water.
[1:46:17] And now you start hearing come preachers
[1:46:19] come and talk and they start talking
[1:46:21] about well, you know, in the message
[1:46:23] there was this. And you're thinking
[1:46:24] what? What is that? Now you can't
[1:46:28] continue in the light that was there to
[1:46:32] stir the ground. There is more light
[1:46:35] needed in this new challenge because now
[1:46:38] you've taken a root. You started to
[1:46:41] grow, right? And because you've taken
[1:46:44] root and you're pushing out, there's new
[1:46:46] light that needs to come. You need to
[1:46:48] start learning about the political
[1:46:51] spirit in the church, the religious
[1:46:53] spirit in the church, the demonic, the
[1:46:56] lies, the the false doctrines. You need
[1:46:59] to know about the pale horse rider. So,
[1:47:01] what are we talking about? The second
[1:47:03] wave of light you're going to need is
[1:47:05] the seven seals.
[1:47:07] That's when you break down those seven
[1:47:09] seals. It's again, it's not theory.
[1:47:12] Once you know that you have a political
[1:47:15] nature which is going to be anti the
[1:47:18] life of the seed, it'll work against
[1:47:21] you. Once you know that you have a
[1:47:22] religious nature that will work against
[1:47:25] the purpose of the seed and there's
[1:47:26] there's all these other natures in you
[1:47:28] and you you need to know what those
[1:47:30] things are. That's what the seven seals
[1:47:32] is about. It's not enough to know what
[1:47:34] the white horse rider is. Oh, he's an
[1:47:36] impostor. He didn't have a oh he had a a
[1:47:39] bow and no arrow and he was sitting on
[1:47:41] the horse and and he and he rode through
[1:47:44] the the first and second and third
[1:47:46] church age and you know the theory of
[1:47:48] what happened. No, that needs to become
[1:47:50] personal. That needs to give you light
[1:47:53] that needs to strengthen that stalk
[1:47:55] needs to get stronger. It needs to push
[1:47:57] out green leaves because that green
[1:47:59] leaves is going to absorb this light for
[1:48:02] a specific reason. The second stage of
[1:48:05] this plant is about producing food.
[1:48:09] Why? What's the purpose? There must be
[1:48:11] seed come out in the end. But for it to
[1:48:14] bring seed, this plant now has to
[1:48:17] produce food, right? So this light works
[1:48:21] on the plant because the plant is now
[1:48:24] exposed to air, right? And we know that
[1:48:26] it is the revelation of the seven seals
[1:48:29] because the light shines upon the plant
[1:48:31] that has already grown out of the
[1:48:33] ground. There's a life emanating out of
[1:48:35] you into the atmosphere and light helps
[1:48:38] the plant in this stage to produce this
[1:48:42] mysterious food called
[1:48:46] sugars. You know how this works, right?
[1:48:49] There's this uh is that too loud? Can
[1:48:51] you hear me? You can hear me cuz I feel
[1:48:54] like I need to shout. Okay, so long as
[1:48:56] you can hear me. So the this word
[1:49:01] photosynthesis, children, you've heard
[1:49:03] of that photosynthesis. Good. Photo is
[1:49:07] the Greek word for light. Bet your
[1:49:10] teacher didn't teach you
[1:49:11] that. Photo and synthesis means to bring
[1:49:15] a change,
[1:49:18] right? To put together. So light putting
[1:49:22] together photosynthesis synthesis
[1:49:25] putting together to bring a change. How?
[1:49:28] So what is light doing? Right? So now
[1:49:31] remember what the plant is doing. It's
[1:49:32] extracting water through the ground.
[1:49:34] It's bringing nutrients. The nutrients
[1:49:37] all it's like you know if you're
[1:49:39] collecting things
[1:49:41] you're collecting protein. You're
[1:49:43] collecting vitamin D. You're collecting
[1:49:45] vitamin A, vitamin B, iron. You know,
[1:49:49] you're collecting all sorts of other
[1:49:50] chemicals. You What's the point? You
[1:49:53] collect them all. They're all in a jar.
[1:49:55] What
[1:49:56] now? Right. Your body actually has the
[1:49:59] intelligence to now take magnesium,
[1:50:02] calcium, this you have what they call
[1:50:05] the
[1:50:06] RDA, required daily amounts, right? and
[1:50:11] and and you can take like a thousand
[1:50:14] migrams of of vitamin C and think, "Wow,
[1:50:18] this is fantastic." They're lying to you
[1:50:20] because your body will only absorb about
[1:50:23] 600.
[1:50:25] You can take a,000, 2,000, you're just
[1:50:28] overworking your kidneys because your
[1:50:31] body will only take 600 and kick out the
[1:50:33] rest. So try to get 600 of vitamin C. So
[1:50:38] you can pump yourself with a whole lot.
[1:50:40] Your body has the intelligence to know
[1:50:42] what to extract, what is need, how much
[1:50:44] of calcium, how much of that, how much
[1:50:45] of that. Now this plant needs
[1:50:47] intelligence and it needs intelligence
[1:50:50] and it and that intelligence will will
[1:50:53] take what is absorbed through the root
[1:50:55] what water and everything and bring it
[1:50:57] into the leaf and the leaf is going to
[1:51:00] have some kind of power to transform
[1:51:02] that into
[1:51:04] sugar. Sugar is carbohydrates.
[1:51:06] Everything lives on
[1:51:08] carbohydrates. Okay. So the plant
[1:51:12] extracts water from the ground. It it
[1:51:15] breathes in the carbon dioxide from the
[1:51:16] air. And now what is it doing?
[1:51:20] Synthesis. It puts it together,
[1:51:23] right? It's going to take carbon carbon
[1:51:26] dioxide. It's going to take all the
[1:51:28] nutrients it's pulled in and the light
[1:51:31] when it hits it transforms it into
[1:51:34] sugars.
[1:51:36] Right? So think of that in your
[1:51:38] perspective. You're going to hear
[1:51:40] messages. You're going to pull from
[1:51:42] whatever preaching there's going to be
[1:51:44] in this stalk and leave stage. You're
[1:51:46] going to hear doctrines. You're going to
[1:51:47] hear songs. You're going to hear
[1:51:48] teachings. You're going to have
[1:51:50] fellowship with one another. But you're
[1:51:52] still in a place of like, how do I put
[1:51:55] this
[1:51:56] together? It has to take revelation to
[1:51:58] put this together. At this stage, it's
[1:52:01] the development of the church stage. You
[1:52:04] still haven't hit the headstone yet. You
[1:52:07] still haven't hit the seed stage yet.
[1:52:10] You're still coming through that stalk
[1:52:11] stage, right? And this is where a
[1:52:13] specific type of light. Now, this is
[1:52:15] what happens if you stay in a church
[1:52:17] where it's like, don't preach the seven
[1:52:20] seals, just stay with the deep things.
[1:52:23] Just keep
[1:52:26] cood. What's going to happen? You're
[1:52:29] going to have a stalk that's like that.
[1:52:33] Because you're trying to use light that
[1:52:36] is meant for germination. Yeah, you
[1:52:39] can't live on God sent a prophet. You
[1:52:42] can't live on How many times can we
[1:52:44] preach serpent seed?
[1:52:47] How many times can we retach? Paul
[1:52:49] actually tells you that in in Hebrews 6,
[1:52:52] leave the first principles behind and
[1:52:54] move on unto perfection. That means uh
[1:52:56] and he and he says doctrines. Can you
[1:52:58] believe he says doctrines of baptisms of
[1:53:01] raising of the dead of those miracles of
[1:53:04] uh of all those things leave them behind
[1:53:07] and move on unto perfection. So you you
[1:53:11] need message churches to move on from
[1:53:13] being excited about testimonies of
[1:53:15] brother Brandham. Do you know why all
[1:53:17] those people are falling away with
[1:53:19] believe the sign? Because their faith
[1:53:21] was based on William Brandham.
[1:53:25] That faith is based on the the prophecy
[1:53:28] of the bear and the prophecy of that and
[1:53:30] the prophecy of that and the pro that
[1:53:32] those were things to in the germination
[1:53:34] stage
[1:53:36] and the churches were not preaching the
[1:53:39] seven seals the revelation of the seals.
[1:53:42] They were not helping the people grow
[1:53:44] into themselves.
[1:53:47] They place emphasis on germination light
[1:53:51] and then fall away. So when it comes
[1:53:54] it's like somebody rocked their boat
[1:53:56] like somebody took our us out at the
[1:53:59] knees. William Brandham was our absolute
[1:54:02] now he's not. So give up on the whole
[1:54:04] message and they forgot forgot about the
[1:54:06] truth that's actually in there where
[1:54:09] William Brandham himself says I must
[1:54:10] decrease he must increase. Amen.
[1:54:15] That's where we are. Eliza when he
[1:54:18] introduces Rebecca to Isaac Eliza steps
[1:54:20] off the scene. There's no more Eliza.
[1:54:22] Amen. And she recognizes a light. Who is
[1:54:25] that man in the midst of the field? He
[1:54:26] is my master.
[1:54:28] And then Eliza's gone and and it's Isaac
[1:54:30] and Rebecca.
[1:54:32] Amen. See, that's the problem. If you're
[1:54:34] going to go fall after, believe the sign
[1:54:36] or even be interested in reading their
[1:54:39] nonsense.
[1:54:40] It's because you are still dabbling with
[1:54:43] germination light. You have to move over
[1:54:46] into the next part of the light, the
[1:54:48] next part of the revelation. That's
[1:54:50] going to make you stronger. That's going
[1:54:51] to make that stalk stand up straight.
[1:54:53] That's going to stick those leaves out
[1:54:55] and respond to the light and produce the
[1:54:57] right carbohydrates for it to grow to
[1:54:59] push you for forward and forward and
[1:55:02] forward towards that seed stage. Praise
[1:55:04] be to God. Which brings us to the third
[1:55:06] light which is the seven thunders. Oh,
[1:55:10] seven
[1:55:11] thunders. What do we do now? And like
[1:55:14] nobody has nobody came and preached to
[1:55:16] us the first thunder is this, the second
[1:55:18] thunder is this, the third. Like what is
[1:55:20] it? We just keep hearing about it. They
[1:55:22] just keep mentioning it. I don't know
[1:55:23] what's
[1:55:26] happening. What do we know about the
[1:55:28] seven thunders? It is the light at the
[1:55:30] end time meant for the bride. It brings
[1:55:34] adoption. It brings rapture. It is seed
[1:55:37] time light. The prophet said in the
[1:55:39] church ages, "These things, the the the
[1:55:42] seven thunders will do two things. It
[1:55:44] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:55:46] back to the fathers and it will uh the
[1:55:48] seven thunders will be uh the great
[1:55:51] divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:55:53] contained in the seventh seal. So it's
[1:55:55] going to something that happened in the
[1:55:58] seals. It's going to bring out
[1:55:59] something. It's going to bring out some
[1:56:01] revelation
[1:56:03] to the person. Yes. It's no longer a
[1:56:06] church movement. It's something to do
[1:56:08] with the seed, with the individual.
[1:56:13] If if we had to bring this out into uh
[1:56:16] um like maybe summarize
[1:56:18] it, this is going to take you away from
[1:56:21] being just a human on earth struggling
[1:56:24] to find your way. You went through the
[1:56:27] second wave of light which which which
[1:56:28] made you realize I'm part of the church.
[1:56:31] I'm moving together. I'm learning
[1:56:33] together. We're we're in this air and
[1:56:35] water movement and there's light. But
[1:56:38] now when you hit seed stage, this is the
[1:56:40] point where you come to a personal
[1:56:43] revelation and a confidence beyond all
[1:56:46] other confidence that I am the bride of
[1:56:49] Christ. And if everyone else falls,
[1:56:52] everyone else falls away, I am going to
[1:56:54] stand. I will still remain when
[1:56:57] everything around me is crashing and
[1:56:59] crumbling and everything is being proved
[1:57:01] wrong. I will still stand. That is the
[1:57:04] light of the seven thunders. It is
[1:57:06] rapturing light.
[1:57:09] Amen. This is now the time of the plant
[1:57:12] where it's receiving its last harvest
[1:57:15] rain. This is the time where you're
[1:57:17] getting the former rain and latter rain
[1:57:20] all at once, which means the seed is
[1:57:22] going to start pulling water into
[1:57:23] itself. It reached the shock stage. The
[1:57:26] seed is inside and enclosed by this hard
[1:57:28] shell. Now, it has to pull water into
[1:57:31] that seed to make it swell.
[1:57:33] The seed is going to start bulking
[1:57:36] because it's time for it to to be seen.
[1:57:38] And at the same time, that light is
[1:57:40] shining so strong. It's heat until that
[1:57:44] shock is drying out and breaking while
[1:57:46] the seed is bulging on the inside and
[1:57:48] it's going to crack it open. What are we
[1:57:50] looking at? Body change. This is body
[1:57:54] change light. This is going to make you
[1:57:57] move even away from church religion,
[1:58:00] churchianity. This is going to move you
[1:58:02] into an individual walk with God. This
[1:58:05] is new light. This is a confidence
[1:58:07] beyond the church.
[1:58:10] Like I said to you, you're going to have
[1:58:13] people closest to you let you down. And
[1:58:16] you're going to have to stand. You're
[1:58:18] not going to do this by your own will.
[1:58:20] You have to have that light. Amen. So it
[1:58:24] swells bringing forth the seed, breaking
[1:58:27] forth from the shock. It is body change
[1:58:29] time. Revelation is light that is
[1:58:32] received in the soul. Can you see
[1:58:34] there? Ground is body, air, rain was
[1:58:38] spirit. But when it comes to the seed,
[1:58:40] it's soul time. Third pull time. Amen.
[1:58:45] That's that mystery. Let's go to Job
[1:58:48] 33:28. He will deliver his soul from go
[1:58:51] soul time. His soul from going into the
[1:58:53] pit, which is darkness, and his life
[1:58:55] shall see the light. Lo, all these
[1:58:57] things workketh God oftenimes with man
[1:59:00] to bring back his soul from the pit to
[1:59:02] be enlightened with the light of the
[1:59:04] living.
[1:59:06] See, it's restoration. So, the first
[1:59:08] part was dealing with the body, the next
[1:59:10] part dealing with the spirit, the next
[1:59:12] part dealing with the soul. The light
[1:59:14] required for your soul to make him sit
[1:59:18] in that throne and be the
[1:59:20] king is going to be what those thunders
[1:59:23] are about. And it's going to go far
[1:59:25] beyond religion, far beyond singing
[1:59:28] songs, far beyond prayer, far beyond
[1:59:31] anything. If they lock up churches, if
[1:59:34] they shut everything down, if you are
[1:59:36] isolated and left alone, you know, CO
[1:59:39] lockdowns was a real big deal. It gave
[1:59:41] you a foretaste of what can happen.
[1:59:44] So many people crumbled and became
[1:59:46] weaker during
[1:59:47] CO. when you're locked down and
[1:59:50] isolated, it it it gave us a foretaste
[1:59:53] of what could happen. I I spoke to our
[1:59:55] church before then and I said, "What if
[1:59:58] satellites crash? There's no Wi-Fi. What
[2:00:02] if telephone lines are down? What if
[2:00:04] there's no more
[2:00:06] fuel? You can't drive to to your
[2:00:09] brother's house, to the pastor's house.
[2:00:11] There's what if there's no more
[2:00:13] communication?"
[2:00:14] Yeah,
[2:00:16] we've all been sucked into, you know,
[2:00:21] it electronic things,
[2:00:25] working desk jobs. Nobody's a boat
[2:00:28] builder. I
[2:00:30] think nobody can build boats or ships
[2:00:33] anymore because now we've got these
[2:00:35] massive metal tankers. And if there's no
[2:00:38] more oil, there's no more gas, there's
[2:00:41] no more industry, everything shuts down.
[2:00:43] You have to go find horses again to get
[2:00:46] around and
[2:00:49] boats and you think you have a horse. Oh
[2:00:51] yeah, great. No, someone's coming to
[2:00:53] steal your horse.
[2:00:56] It's going to go back to tribalism.
[2:00:59] I'm just giving as a worst case
[2:01:00] scenario. Please don't get anxiety on me
[2:01:02] now.
[2:01:04] Okay. I'm just saying if you look at
[2:01:07] even these things in the spiritual where
[2:01:09] you're blocked from things that you take
[2:01:11] for granted. Yes. It comes a time where
[2:01:14] you have to stand alone. Without those
[2:01:16] seven thunders, everyone in the world
[2:01:19] who thinks they know God or serve God is
[2:01:22] going to fall, is going to fail. We've
[2:01:24] seen it. We, you know, uh, brother
[2:01:28] dramatizes when they went into the ark,
[2:01:31] uh, um, Noah and his family and how his
[2:01:34] son came up to him, you know, with a
[2:01:36] little bit
[2:01:36] of rubbing his bald head. Pap, are you
[2:01:41] sure the Lord spoke to you? because we
[2:01:43] shut in here and there's no rain. Wife
[2:01:45] comes and says to him, you know, are you
[2:01:48] sure about this? You've been preaching
[2:01:49] for 120 years and here everything is
[2:01:51] built now. The rain is supposed to be
[2:01:53] coming down. Noah says, God told me it's
[2:01:56] going to rain. See, the one who had the
[2:01:58] revelation is going to stay true to it.
[2:02:01] You can see this with uh Lot's wife. You
[2:02:05] can see this with other people in there.
[2:02:07] They turn around and they're they're
[2:02:08] looking at the time of desperation and
[2:02:11] judgment. When they have no light, they
[2:02:14] are going to fold.
[2:02:17] It's going to take that individual time.
[2:02:19] Do you love him, saints? Amen. So, let's
[2:02:22] bring this to a close and we're going to
[2:02:24] talk about the plant. Okay. What then is
[2:02:27] the plant? We know everything now. We
[2:02:30] know how it works, how it all comes
[2:02:32] together. What is then the plant, right?
[2:02:35] The plant that we're looking at is
[2:02:37] actually the manifested life of Christ
[2:02:40] in a completely. So the seed went into
[2:02:43] the ground. There's actually a quote in
[2:02:45] what is it is in Christ the mystery I
[2:02:47] think it is where he said that seed went
[2:02:50] into the ground and died and the body
[2:02:53] laid dormant for all these church ages
[2:02:55] and now here she is standing on her own
[2:02:57] two feet. Right? He was the alpha. Yes.
[2:03:03] He went into the ground for us. He was
[2:03:05] the corn of wheat that went and died and
[2:03:08] and became a new body. Yes. The
[2:03:11] manifested life of Christ that started
[2:03:13] pushing through Gentile darkness. It
[2:03:16] went into a new land. It blindness to
[2:03:20] the Jews, right? Darkness to them, but
[2:03:22] light to the Gentiles. Amen. Right? And
[2:03:25] light started coming and it was a new
[2:03:27] manifestation. This plant was a new
[2:03:29] manifestation. The the old manifestation
[2:03:32] of the life of God was the Levitical law
[2:03:35] amongst the Hebrews. This is the the
[2:03:37] manifested life of Christ. This plant is
[2:03:41] the manifested life of Christ moving
[2:03:43] through gentile dispensation. Think
[2:03:45] about it. It went through from the
[2:03:47] Middle East. It went through Tire. It
[2:03:49] went through Italy. It went through
[2:03:51] Rome. It went through France. It went
[2:03:52] through Germany. It went through
[2:03:54] Belgium. It got to the UK. It got to the
[2:03:56] Americas. It went through the east. It
[2:03:58] went to the to the south. moving towards
[2:04:00] Africa. This manifested life of Christ,
[2:04:04] same God who led the Hebrews is now
[2:04:07] producing a new life in a new vessel
[2:04:11] in Gentiles, among different cultures,
[2:04:14] among different languages. I don't think
[2:04:16] you appreciate how great this is.
[2:04:20] You know, just a thing like um maybe
[2:04:23] some of you Africaners here can tell me,
[2:04:25] but it's in German, it's in in some of
[2:04:28] the African languages. How do you teach
[2:04:30] serpent seed when in the Bible the only
[2:04:33] word is slang
[2:04:37] or schlang in the German? And then you
[2:04:40] must tell these Germans, no, it's
[2:04:41] actually an upright beast. But they
[2:04:43] don't have a word for serpent. It's just
[2:04:46] one word, slang. These people come from
[2:04:49] different languages. They need We make a
[2:04:52] big deal about what it says and what
[2:04:53] that means in a Greek and a Hebrew and
[2:04:55] there's the word here in the English and
[2:04:57] you English people are just enjoying
[2:04:59] this. But the other languages don't have
[2:05:02] the the the the value of having this
[2:05:05] great vocabulary that we can make fancy
[2:05:08] sermons about and have these buzzwords.
[2:05:11] They just have those simple words that
[2:05:14] what do they have for cherubam? What do
[2:05:16] they have for seraraphim? Uh, in the in
[2:05:19] the African languages, no such thing as
[2:05:21] a table because they didn't need tables.
[2:05:23] They ate on the floor. So, they had to
[2:05:25] copy the word table from the Africanos
[2:05:27] who came with taff. So, now it's
[2:05:33] utafoola,
[2:05:35] right? It's a new thing. It never
[2:05:38] existed in our culture. You think that
[2:05:41] the life of Christ could be manifested
[2:05:44] in a new way completely throughout this
[2:05:47] world? This is the manifested life of
[2:05:50] Christ. And if it can do that in
[2:05:52] different generations, imagine what it
[2:05:54] can do in different individuals,
[2:05:58] different people. It actually tells you
[2:06:00] it doesn't have to be the same. We don't
[2:06:03] have to be robots who all act the same,
[2:06:07] sing the same, talk the same, pray the
[2:06:09] same. We don't have to be that because
[2:06:12] the manifested life of Christ can go
[2:06:14] through any ground. Amen.
[2:06:18] Appreciate what God has done for you.
[2:06:20] This is the manifestation of the seed.
[2:06:22] And this is how it all works. It's going
[2:06:24] to need chosen ground. It's going to
[2:06:26] need water, the Holy Ghost, the
[2:06:28] five-fold ministry, the teaching of the
[2:06:30] word, the former and latter reign. It's
[2:06:32] going to need the air, the perfect
[2:06:33] atmosphere of church, the bride church,
[2:06:37] the chosen church, the church of God.
[2:06:39] It's going to have to work through those
[2:06:41] seven church ages. It's going to have to
[2:06:42] come through all the development stages,
[2:06:45] but it can never achieve anything
[2:06:49] without revelation, divine revelation,
[2:06:52] which is light. This is the only proof
[2:06:55] of the seed.
[2:06:57] The only proof that there is a seed in
[2:06:59] there is the manifested life.
[2:07:02] The plant outside the ground is proof
[2:07:04] there was a seed.
[2:07:08] It's the manifested life. Amen. So
[2:07:11] that's what we are going to respond to.
[2:07:13] That's what the the ministry is going to
[2:07:15] see. When we see the manifested life, we
[2:07:18] can work with you. When we see the love
[2:07:20] for the word, the interest in the word,
[2:07:22] the desire to be one with the church,
[2:07:24] the desire to be in unity, that's a
[2:07:27] manifested life of Christ. When you see
[2:07:29] me coming from Africa and you here in
[2:07:31] New Zealand, and we are one in purpose,
[2:07:34] we can work together. We're going to
[2:07:35] respond together. You see someone from
[2:07:37] Japan, someone from uh South America,
[2:07:40] and people you don't you can barely
[2:07:42] understand. But when we meet each other,
[2:07:44] manifest the life of Christ and manifest
[2:07:46] the life of Christ, something rings
[2:07:48] together because it's going to respond
[2:07:51] to that together. Otherwise, we're just
[2:07:53] people trying to work out our intellect,
[2:07:55] which never works well. Amen.
[2:07:58] Praise be to God. The seed is not
[2:08:01] visible while it's in the ground. Once
[2:08:04] the root has appeared, the seed
[2:08:06] disappears.
[2:08:08] It's died. It's disappeared. It's
[2:08:10] frazzled. It's gone. It disintegrates.
[2:08:12] You dig up the ground. You pull out the
[2:08:14] roots. There's no more seed. There's no
[2:08:16] more evidence of seed. What is the
[2:08:18] evidence? The manifested life. The plant
[2:08:22] is evidence that a seed was present. At
[2:08:25] a time in your life when you didn't have
[2:08:27] an identity and you didn't know who you
[2:08:29] were, you thought, "Am I a child of God?
[2:08:32] Am I am am I a believer? Is this message
[2:08:35] really for me? But then when you see the
[2:08:37] manifest in life, when you see the
[2:08:38] revelation, when you see the growth,
[2:08:40] when you feel those that mystery sugars
[2:08:43] pulsing through you, then you know there
[2:08:45] was a seed. There was something there. I
[2:08:48] know who I am. There's an identification
[2:08:51] and I can I can understand. I can see
[2:08:53] I'm together with these people. I find
[2:08:55] myself together under the same cloud.
[2:08:59] Praise be to God. Thank you. That
[2:09:02] manifested life is your evidence where
[2:09:04] no one else can see one.
[2:09:07] Let's close with these few
[2:09:10] quotes. Oh well, this is the summary of
[2:09:13] it. The seed which is the word in
[2:09:15] thought form. The ground is your body.
[2:09:18] The ground must have nutrients and
[2:09:19] vitamins. The rain works on your spirit.
[2:09:22] It has the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:24] ministry. The former and latter rain,
[2:09:27] the spoken word. The air works on your
[2:09:30] spirit which is still working with that
[2:09:31] which is above ground. The plant in
[2:09:34] there is the church which creates the
[2:09:36] atmosphere using the gifts in order and
[2:09:39] the light works on the soul all the way
[2:09:42] through giving the revelation which is
[2:09:44] the word the same word in mystery form
[2:09:47] which will transform all the nutrients
[2:09:50] correctly into exactly what you need for
[2:09:53] each stage.
[2:09:56] Don't sweat the small stuff.
[2:09:59] Just trust it. There is your body. You
[2:10:02] know body, spirit, soul, right? And you
[2:10:06] can see it all working together. You
[2:10:08] have the gene seed placed inside you.
[2:10:11] Before the gene be before you even were
[2:10:13] conscious of the gene seed, you were
[2:10:15] following the desires of your heart,
[2:10:16] doing whatever you wanted. Once that
[2:10:19] gene seed woke up. Amen. Amen. Or then
[2:10:22] you had no chance. From there on, you
[2:10:25] were drawn to the church, the body of
[2:10:27] Christ. Gifts of the Holy Spirit began
[2:10:30] to be impressed on you. It began to work
[2:10:32] in that spirit. I don't know what is
[2:10:34] that center blue or gray? I don't know.
[2:10:36] It looks blue from here and gray over
[2:10:38] there. Anyway, it's my coloring to show
[2:10:41] you the the spirit realm. Okay. And so
[2:10:43] in there you also have the five-fold
[2:10:46] ministry which you should really
[2:10:47] appreciate and the differences of the
[2:10:50] five-fold ministry. The uniqueness of
[2:10:52] every brother who expounds the word.
[2:10:55] There is no greater one among them.
[2:10:58] We're all the same. We're all come from
[2:11:00] the same smutty ground as everybody
[2:11:03] else. We all come with our own way of
[2:11:05] understanding, our own weird way of
[2:11:07] speaking, our stammering lips, our
[2:11:11] interpretation. But God knows us. He
[2:11:13] chose us because he knows we'll only be
[2:11:15] able to see that thing that way because
[2:11:17] he gave us an experience. So, we're
[2:11:19] going to speak from that experience. You
[2:11:21] must appreciate every one of our
[2:11:23] brothers in the ministry. Pray for them.
[2:11:26] It's not an easy thing speaking to the
[2:11:28] queen of heaven. Amen.
[2:11:32] Bless the Lord. Amen. He's wonderful to
[2:11:34] us. And then so you also have now the
[2:11:38] revelation which is the light. Do not
[2:11:41] take revelation for granted. Do not
[2:11:43] think that you can bring out the seed of
[2:11:46] life in the end by skirting the
[2:11:49] mysteries, by running from the truth. Do
[2:11:53] not think you're going to bring out if
[2:11:55] you're struggling, young people, older
[2:11:58] people, you're you're struggling to
[2:12:00] bring out that life of God in
[2:12:02] you. You can't stay with foundation
[2:12:06] light. It isn't enough. You've got to
[2:12:09] get to the depths of the word. You have
[2:12:11] to come to the marriage of the lamb and
[2:12:14] the bride. You have to come to that
[2:12:16] place because that's going to be the one
[2:12:18] that pushes up and brings that body
[2:12:20] change and prepares everything and gets
[2:12:22] everything ready. That's the one that's
[2:12:23] going to put you into your purpose.
[2:12:26] Amen. So don't get stuck on light of
[2:12:29] previous
[2:12:30] days. In closing, here we are. He says,
[2:12:33] formed to the word image. Are you all
[2:12:35] awake? You all together? Yeah, we're
[2:12:38] just going to I'm not even going to try
[2:12:39] and preach from you. I'm going to read
[2:12:41] it and I know you're going to absorb it.
[2:12:44] Who is this MelkiseDC? He says, "Here we
[2:12:46] are formed to the word image to be a
[2:12:49] partaker of the word to feed on the word
[2:12:53] by being predestinated since the
[2:12:56] beginning." What's that? Seed. You see
[2:12:58] that little spark of life that you had
[2:13:00] in you from the beginning when you
[2:13:03] started your journey? Many of you can
[2:13:05] remember it. You joined this church. You
[2:13:08] joined that church. You tried this out
[2:13:09] and that nothing satisfied. That's
[2:13:12] right. But one day you just recognized
[2:13:15] it. Amen. You came out of the
[2:13:18] ground. Oh, if you only travel around
[2:13:21] and see the religions, one has to do
[2:13:24] this, one has to do that, one has to do
[2:13:26] that. But brethren, let's this old
[2:13:28] tabernacle ground one time. Let's get
[2:13:32] straightened out forever. We are
[2:13:33] Christians by the faith through the
[2:13:36] grace of God. We are Christians. God in
[2:13:39] his infinite mercy called us to be
[2:13:41] reconciled to him through his son Christ
[2:13:44] Jesus settles it. Amen. As the musicians
[2:13:47] come forward, not what we done, what he
[2:13:51] did. Do you see that? He changed my soul
[2:13:55] from the things of the world unto the
[2:13:58] things of God. from horse races and
[2:14:01] gambling and adultery and lying and
[2:14:04] stealing. He changed my soul changed my
[2:14:07] thoughts. Then my thoughts became so
[2:14:10] real till they became words in my lips
[2:14:13] and they materialized now and now I am a
[2:14:17] Christian. It made me a different
[2:14:19] person. That's what made you. There's
[2:14:22] how it all works together. That's how
[2:14:24] it's coming together.
[2:14:26] Amen. Time test. I love this. This is
[2:14:28] just to encourage
[2:14:30] you to be more than just a message
[2:14:34] church because there is a world that's
[2:14:37] looking for you.
[2:14:40] The world wants to see something real.
[2:14:42] I'm hungry for real things. I'm hungry
[2:14:45] to see a church stand in this last days.
[2:14:47] I'm hungry to see a good old-fashioned
[2:14:49] Pentecostal body of Christ rise in the
[2:14:52] power of the Holy Ghost calling right
[2:14:54] right wrong. My heart longs to see it.
[2:14:57] The little remnants that's waiting on
[2:14:59] are not waiting to see how big we can
[2:15:01] make our denominations. They're not
[2:15:03] waiting to see how well we can dress or
[2:15:06] how big a church we can build. They're
[2:15:08] waiting to see us manifest the life of
[2:15:10] the Lord Jesus Christ in love and power.
[2:15:14] They're waiting to see the time when the
[2:15:16] oneness tunas trinity thunders per two
[2:15:20] lords stay with the ABCs. They're
[2:15:23] waiting to see all of them put their
[2:15:24] hands in each other's hands and say, "We
[2:15:26] are brothers." It's waiting for the
[2:15:29] assemblies and the holiness and the
[2:15:30] Pentecostal holiness and the church of
[2:15:32] God for the Mexicans and the colored
[2:15:34] people and the Japanese and the white
[2:15:36] all together join ranks as one great
[2:15:39] body of Jesus Christ. They don't care
[2:15:41] how good we educate our preachers.
[2:15:43] They're waiting to see reality. Then
[2:15:46] they got an experience. If there is a
[2:15:47] reality, that's what we need, an
[2:15:50] experience, saints. That is how it all
[2:15:53] works together. Praise be to God. Aren't
[2:15:56] you in love with him? Do not you do do
[2:16:00] you not love how the word reveals
[2:16:02] himself? He is your husband. It is
[2:16:05] beyond religion. It is beyond theory. It
[2:16:08] is an absolute reality. Amen. Let's bow
[2:16:12] our heads together as we
[2:16:14] pray. Heavenly
[2:16:17] Father, Lord, words fail us. No matter
[2:16:21] how many words we have to explain, to
[2:16:24] express the things that you have
[2:16:25] revealed in us, but when when it comes
[2:16:28] to telling you how much you mean to us,
[2:16:30] Lord, we could go on forever and yet
[2:16:33] still not have enough words. Our
[2:16:35] languages are limited. Our ways of
[2:16:38] expressing ourselves are so limited. We
[2:16:40] just do things that we have been taught
[2:16:42] to do. But Lord, we believe that there
[2:16:45] is a life that was manifested in us, in
[2:16:48] our brothers and sisters, in the church
[2:16:50] around us, in the saints across the
[2:16:52] world. We see the manifested life
[2:16:55] wherever we go. We see the humility of
[2:16:57] Christ that he thought it not robbery to
[2:17:00] be equal with God, but took upon himself
[2:17:02] the form of a servant to bring to us a
[2:17:05] new name, a new identification, to raise
[2:17:08] us up into the image of Almighty God.
[2:17:10] How wonderful it is, Lord, to be the
[2:17:13] bride of Christ in this day. I pray for
[2:17:15] these my brothers and sisters. They're
[2:17:17] my family. I feel their pain. I feel
[2:17:21] their joy. I feel their strength. I feel
[2:17:23] their experiences. We are going through
[2:17:26] the same thing. We're going against the
[2:17:28] same enemy. Lord, I pray for every one
[2:17:31] of them. I pray for those, Lord, who are
[2:17:34] new to this message. for the children,
[2:17:35] for the youth, for those who have lost
[2:17:37] their way and want to come back. For
[2:17:39] those who are weak in the faith, for
[2:17:41] those who maybe have gotten old and
[2:17:43] thought they have got no more purpose in
[2:17:46] the church and nobody cares or nobody
[2:17:48] sees them anymore. Lord Jesus, I pray
[2:17:51] that you may bring that final light upon
[2:17:53] us. Lord, that may bring out the seed.
[2:17:56] Make it swell within us. Make it full of
[2:17:59] potential to burst out of this shock
[2:18:02] that it may be seen in this last day
[2:18:04] that it is Christ again on earth. Lord,
[2:18:07] let it be real to your children. We
[2:18:08] pray. Father God, bless us now. Bless
[2:18:12] the as we conclude this part of the
[2:18:14] camp, bless the pastor and the office
[2:18:17] holders, all the brothers and sisters
[2:18:20] and children, those who work tirelessly
[2:18:23] to make this come together. Give to them
[2:18:25] a a special blessing. Oh God, be with us
[2:18:29] now. We pray. Also take us safely back
[2:18:32] to our homes. Lord, be with us. Be with
[2:18:36] us in our heart and our soul. May the
[2:18:38] fellowship of the word never die out. Oh
[2:18:41] God, may there always be a mystery to
[2:18:43] you, oh Lord. I don't want to get used
[2:18:46] to an idea. I want to have a life that's
[2:18:48] constantly learning and knowing more
[2:18:50] about you. Oh Lord, may our love just be
[2:18:54] a constant mystery unfolding and
[2:18:56] unfolding and unfolding. Blessed be your
[2:18:58] holy name, Lord Jesus. You are
[2:19:00] everything to us. We ask it in that
[2:19:03] precious name with praise and
[2:19:05] thanksgiving. Amen and amen. The Lord
[2:19:08] bless you, brother
[2:19:12] [Music]
[2:19:27] Elra. Amen. We've seen how it all
[2:19:31] works. Amen. This is so many beautiful
[2:19:34] things just came together over this
[2:19:36] weekend.
[2:19:37] And what I love is how many things were
[2:19:40] addressed, how many things in individual
[2:19:43] lives for us as a church, just different
[2:19:45] things in families, so forth, how it was
[2:19:48] addressed. And I just really thank the
[2:19:50] Lord. I say thank you to brother
[2:19:53] Alistister for making himself available
[2:19:55] for the Lord to to use and inspire and
[2:19:58] following the leading of the Lord.
[2:20:00] Um, I just I just feel on my heart to uh
[2:20:03] maybe I'll ask that you close your eyes,
[2:20:05] everyone's eyes closed, but maybe
[2:20:08] there's there's someone who who sits
[2:20:10] here and say, um, we've seen how it all
[2:20:14] works. We've seen how it should all come
[2:20:16] together, and Lord, I'm I see I'm stuck
[2:20:19] somewhere in in a place where it is not
[2:20:24] letting this whole
[2:20:25] manifestation happen in my life. If
[2:20:27] that's you, you can express it to the
[2:20:29] Lord now as we
[2:20:30] pray. Let's take it to the Lord in
[2:20:36] simplicity. Precious Father, you see
[2:20:39] every hand
[2:20:41] raised. Father, you see every heart. You
[2:20:44] see the thoughts that's even going
[2:20:46] through our minds right now, Lord.
[2:20:49] Father, you've showed us so beautifully
[2:20:51] and and just such clarity, Lord, for how
[2:20:55] everything that you do, Lord, comes
[2:20:59] together to to bring us to growth, to
[2:21:02] bring us to maturity in you, to take us
[2:21:05] forward in you,
[2:21:07] Lord. Oh father and oh Lord precious
[2:21:12] people have recognized Lord that maybe
[2:21:16] they still stuck in the wrong cycle or
[2:21:18] maybe there's still growth needed Lord
[2:21:21] or maybe there was a wrong perspective
[2:21:23] or wrong application Lord whatever the
[2:21:26] desire is Lord Jesus you see it this
[2:21:31] morning Lord it's my heart's desire Lord
[2:21:34] that we don't just go home from camp and
[2:21:37] just continue as we were. But Father,
[2:21:40] that the things you've spoken to us,
[2:21:42] Lord, you promised in your word that
[2:21:44] your word won't return to you void, but
[2:21:46] it will accomplish the things that you
[2:21:48] sent us to do. Lord, if we pray this
[2:21:51] morning together, Lord, we pray for
[2:21:52] ourselves, but we also pray for each
[2:21:54] other, Lord. Father, let your word
[2:21:57] accomplish in each one of us, Father. Oh
[2:22:00] Lord, break down barriers. Break down
[2:22:02] preconceived
[2:22:03] ideas. Break break break down
[2:22:06] complexes. Father, perhaps there's those
[2:22:08] that have complexes with one another,
[2:22:10] Lord. Issues between different parts of
[2:22:13] the body, Lord. I pray that you will
[2:22:15] break those things down, Father. Oh Lord
[2:22:18] Jesus, I pray, Father, that the rain
[2:22:21] will rain upon us, Father.
[2:22:24] Father, Lord, the air will anoint and
[2:22:28] inspire. Father, I pray that the light
[2:22:31] will come into every life. Lord, I pray
[2:22:34] that you'll stimulate a a desire, a
[2:22:37] thirst for revelation, Father. Lord
[2:22:40] Jesus, I pray, Lord, that you will give
[2:22:41] us grace to delve into the word, Lord.
[2:22:44] That it won't feel like it is
[2:22:47] unreachable, Father. Lord, I pray that
[2:22:49] you've spoken to hearts just in so many
[2:22:52] ways, Father. wherever we are stuck or
[2:22:55] wherever we are behind what you want us
[2:22:57] to do. Lord, help us, Father, not to see
[2:22:59] it as this impossible mountain to climb,
[2:23:02] but to see, Lord, that it's
[2:23:04] simplicity that it's your desire for the
[2:23:07] seed to bring forth what you've already
[2:23:08] placed in the
[2:23:10] sea. Thank you, Father. We just give you
[2:23:12] the glory for this
[2:23:15] weekend, Father. We thank you. And just
[2:23:19] Lord, words cannot express Lord what we
[2:23:22] feel in our hearts. Lord, thank you for
[2:23:24] this weekend Lord. I pray that your
[2:23:25] blessings will rest upon brother
[2:23:27] Alistister. Pray that you will take him
[2:23:29] home with a good testimony Lord but also
[2:23:33] encouraged, strengthened, Father,
[2:23:36] refreshed by your presence, Lord. Oh
[2:23:39] God, we just appreciate you so much. We
[2:23:43] ask these things in the wonderful name
[2:23:44] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:23:49] Amen.
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:23:57] Amen. Let's just stand together and sing
[2:24:00] that song. Oh, glorious
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:03] victory. Oh, glorious victory.
[2:24:07] [Music]
[2:24:08] And they he set me
[2:24:11] free and he made my
[2:24:16] [Music]
[2:24:29] heart.
[2:24:31] I do praise his name.
[2:24:38] I am
[2:24:40] Lord who I
[2:24:44] am. I can see
[2:24:47] now just who I
[2:24:52] am. God of my
[2:24:56] savior, part of his
[2:25:00] word is
[2:25:04] revelation of who I am.
[2:25:09] on
[2:25:12] Cal to redeem his
[2:25:20] lost. He became my
[2:25:24] savior. This is God's dream.
[2:25:29] My love expressed to
[2:25:32] me that Christ and
[2:25:36] I might be
[2:25:40] made who I am.
[2:25:44] Lord, who I
[2:25:48] am. I can't see
[2:25:52] now who I
[2:25:56] am. part of my
[2:26:00] savior, part of his
[2:26:04] word. It's a
[2:26:08] revelation of who I
[2:26:12] am. Amen. Just want to say I really
[2:26:15] appreciated that, brother Alistister. It
[2:26:17] wasn't like lollies where it feels
[2:26:20] really good, but then come crashing down
[2:26:22] and it didn't put me into a food coma.
[2:26:24] It was just a wellbalanced spiritual
[2:26:26] meal. So much appreciate
[2:26:32] it. Before the world began, you knew my
[2:26:37] name. You held me in your
[2:26:41] hand. When the earth was silent, I was
[2:26:46] there with you singing your praise.
[2:26:52] And I came to
[2:26:55] you and I took my first
[2:27:00] breath and the cry that I made was in
[2:27:04] your
[2:27:06] praise. I have a reason to
[2:27:10] worship. I have a reason to praise
[2:27:15] you. I have a reason to lift up my hands
[2:27:19] and rejoice. Every reason to
[2:27:22] [Applause]
[2:27:24] see when I was lost in the
[2:27:28] darkness. You came to find
[2:27:33] me. I heard you calling my name. Took my
[2:27:37] sin and my shame and you save
[2:27:41] me. Now I can call you my
[2:27:46] savior. I can call you redeemer.
[2:27:52] I can call you my healer, my brother, my
[2:27:55] friend. I can call you my
[2:28:00] king. When I started my journey, I
[2:28:04] didn't know but I was not alone.
[2:28:10] You were there with me in every eye in
[2:28:23] every
[2:28:27] eternity. Salvation now for your blood
[2:28:33] redee. I have a reason to worship.
[2:28:38] I have a reason to praise
[2:28:42] you. I have a reason to lift up my hands
[2:28:46] and rejoice. Have a reason to
[2:28:51] sing. When I was lost in the
[2:28:56] darkness, you came to find
[2:29:00] me. I heard you calling my name. Took my
[2:29:04] sin and my shame. and you save
[2:29:09] me now. I can call you my
[2:29:13] savior. I can call you
[2:29:18] redeemer. I can call you my healer, my
[2:29:21] father, my friend. I can call you my
[2:29:29] king.
[2:29:31] Hosana. Jesus has conquered the grave.
[2:29:36] [Music]

[2:29:53] [Music]

[2:30:03] I have a reason to
[2:30:06] worship. I have a reason to praise
[2:30:11] you. I have a reason to lift up my hands
[2:30:15] and rejoice. Have a reason to
[2:30:20] sing. When I was lost in the
[2:30:25] darkness, you came to find me.

[2:30:55] king.
[2:30:58] make
[2:31:03] me.
[2:31:05] I was a
[2:31:07] wretch. I remember who I
[2:31:12] was. I was
[2:31:14] lost. I was
[2:31:16] blind. I was running out of time.
[2:31:23] Sin
[2:31:26] separated. The breach was far too
[2:31:30] wide. But from the far side of the
[2:31:35] chasm, you had me in your
[2:31:39] side. So
[2:31:41] you made a
[2:31:44] way across the great
[2:31:48] divine. Left
[2:31:50] behind heaven's
[2:31:53] throne. Build it here
[2:31:57] inside.
[2:31:59] There at the
[2:32:01] cross. You paid the debt I
[2:32:05] owe. Broke my
[2:32:08] chain. Freed my soul. For the first time
[2:32:13] I at home.
[2:32:16] Thank you Jesus for the
[2:32:24] blood. Thank you
[2:32:28] Jesus
[2:32:30] has
[2:32:33] me. Thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[2:32:40] life.
[2:32:42] brought me from the darkness into
[2:32:48] glorious
[2:32:52] light. You took my
[2:32:56] place inside my tomb of
[2:33:00] sin. You were buried for three days, but
[2:33:05] then you walked right out
[2:33:09] again. And out
[2:33:11] there has no
[2:33:13] se and light has no
[2:33:17] end for I have been
[2:33:21] transformed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:33:27] Thank you Jesus for the
[2:33:35] blood. Thank you Jesus. You
[2:33:41] have
[2:33:43] me. Thank you Jesus. You have save my
[2:33:52] heart. Roll me from the darkness.
[2:34:04] There is nothing
[2:34:06] stronger than the wonder working power
[2:34:11] of the
[2:34:15] blood. The
[2:34:19] blood that calls us sons and
[2:34:22] daughterers.
[2:34:24] We are rising
[2:34:36] by. There is nothing
[2:34:40] stronger than the one working power of
[2:34:45] the blood.
[2:34:53] that calls us sons and
[2:34:56] daughterers. We are ransom by our
[2:34:59] father.
