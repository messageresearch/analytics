[Applause] Lord he is my life speak what is true speak what is true speak what is [Music] [Applause] true right praise the lord well this has gone so quick so quick I think of all the months of looking forward and all the hard work beforehand and looking forward to this time it's kind of scary to think that we at the last service of Camp already we have one day to go but um a fun day exciting day um but um right now I'm really really looking forward to what the Lord is going to speak to us this morning and mean I believe the foundation has been laid I'm really sad for those who can't be here this morning um but really we want to we want to really receive the the icing on the cake this morning I trust that you're all all right not too tired amen I will say again what I said uh what was it yesterday or the day before if if you feel too tired please feel free to stand up but it's it's really crucial that you get this morning service it's really really important that we get maximum out of it and uh like I said last night I want to encourage you to open your hearts and if there's things that that cause your heart to be blocked I want to I want to encourage you right now even to just in your heart say Lord please open my heart so I can receive these things it's so good to be here so good to have you all here um we are slightly smaller group than yesterday but um it's it is uh there's something special special about small small group of Fellowship also so really intimate and so on so I don't want to take a lot of time but maybe we can sing another song so um let's sing that song um we have all foreign musicians that's going to be fun so let's see how we go you guys probably and when I say foreign I mean not my home church I don't mean you know you understand you know I get myself in trouble this what's that now prise the Lord J you have to show them how to do this um so I want to sing that that uh song of kissas broken down all my wealth Stripped Away so if you guys don't know it then I suggest we just quickly swap musicians it is in B flat I think is it in B flat the first chord is a B flat if in if there we go you know someone that knows better than I do um so so you got F now right let's stand together and try in fact Carissa sorry I'm going to abuse you again sorry for that get her light nice and [Music] Loud broken down on my [Music] St I've done so [Music] many habits overpowering [Music] my feel helpless unamed I'm not wory gave him all my reasons why should love me all my reasons why he shouldn't save me all my reasons not to care I gave him all my reasons why shouldn't love me all my reasons why he shouldn't save me all the reasons not to care but he died for [Applause] [Music] me [Music] stand feel his peace surrounding me takes my hands and looks [Music] me I see trust I see love I see he tell me all the reasons why should love me all the reasons why he should save me oh the reasons to care he tells me all the reasons why should love me all the reasons why he should save me all the reasons to care but he died GL Angels get realing he showed me I'm worthy I'm forgiven I'm a Child of God he show me I'm a master peace I'm chosen I'm Victorious he show me I'm redeemed I'm restored I am tells me all the reasons why should love me all the reasons why he should save me all the reasons to tells me all the reasons why should love me all the reasons why he should save me all the reasons take care died for me we just dream thank you that uh I put you on a bit of a spot you see what you don't know is there's all sorts of fillings that's required in in the middle and you don't know them so all around you didn't do too bad praise the Lord amen let's sing a song that hopefully we all know come now is the time to worship I'll call Michael up with this one come now is the time to come now is the time to give your heart Come Just As He are you worship Come Just As You Are before your God one day every time one day every tongue will confess you are God one day every knee will bow still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now come now is the time to work worship come now is the time to give your heart Come Just As You Are to worship just as you are before your God come one day every tongue will confess you our God one day every knee shall bow for [Music] glad come now is the time to worship come now is the time to give your heart Come Just As You Are to worship Come Just As You Are before your God come amen there's some good words right there mean just come as you are yeah you don't have to come with all the wars and the pretenses God meets us a Amen in our condition he met the prostitute on his on her washing his feet in her condition in her State amen and she found forgiveness in a changed life so it's just uh yeah like brother Al said or Al as he likes to be called it's uh it's kind of sad we've come to the last service I'm happy because I get off from now and I'm going to have some fun later that's for sure I'm waiting for that uh that slide and a few other things um but yeah we we we want to make sure we just give this last time to God if that's okay and don't worry I don't have a long sermon necessary planned out but you know we really want the Lord just to be free and if that means certain things take place later on let it take place we don't have to have an agenda as such there's a lot of time even maybe tomorrow morning quickly we can do a few things so let's just allow God that time but I just want to say really from my heart um oh man you've been awesome okay you've really you know Minister um you know you as you stand you're looking for little signs you're looking for openness and and uh you've just been really good that way and I just appreciate that you know s of standing here it's not always easy you know you know you're coming up against things and and um and it's not easy things sometimes sometimes it hurts real bad and or you have to go to places that people don't want to go but you've been kind enough to at least hear me out and I appreciate that and I trust sometimes you know sometimes God is a it's like as we spoke about the other night it's a healing process and some things may have been said that you're still trying to figure figure out and you don't quite understand and you feel the heart is hurting but or you just trying to see Lord I still struggle but I'm I'm but just let him do the healing let him take through you through that Journey Don't Be impatient wait on the Lord he will help you through but um I really believe you know God has really called us to be happy people to be Overcomers in your generation like we said in the first service you being the elite so uh you know it's an opportunity to express yourself to the world around you and it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be saving everyone around you but you'll just be a shining light for those around you so may the Lord just be with you we're going to go on a a slightly different route this morning uh I want to give you some tools okay and I want to help you in the journey ahead and then just help you amongst each other because you know you got each other hey yeah some of us have got some friends out there that respect your stand and there's nothing wrong with that but unfortunately often you only really have each other to to help and and what happens is is uh the devil's going to try and interrupt that and just some bring some feelings amongst you and some hurts and if we're not careful for the Joe's walking up to uh there we go thank you brother JN you know the if you're not careful the devil let little things come amongst us but if we can see the picture if we can see where the devil's tricks are um you know we can just be in a better state so may the Lord just help us this morning by his grace amen so um you can bring up the presentation brother Joe ah I hijacked the Cam's theme we we all know what it was we all in this together but it's not just we all in this together today it's it's supposed to carry on okay this is the idea here and that's how you'll see my sermon title was let brotherly and sister sisterly love continue because that's really where we want this to go that from here it'll just be extended and we'll help each other along life's journey amen so Austra you are dismissed you're all looking at me wondering where am I going to send them down don't wor you are dismissed and thank you once again the singing has just also been such a highlight oh man you guys are talented here and just even that song uh we sang just now Sister Carissa sang uh composed and wrote you know there's such talents in the message and allow yourself to express talents don't don't hinder yourself some of us are just weighed under we think we're not good enough we don't have what it takes but you know God can really use your gift you know in the Bible many of you know the story here the K the you know the the the household sort of king or ruler gave people different talents you know and as you know it and it represents God and some some have got five talents you know and they sometimes look like the heroes you know amongst us and and us as the one Talent we know we don't want to be guilty of burying the talent under the ground because you'll be surprised are that one Talent God can use and multiply so so don't look at each other don't look at each other's gifts and you know that guy's bigger than me and and she's more pretty it doesn't matter God will use you in your place so just trust him he's definitely got a purpose for you amen so we're going to read uh it shows it's on and the battery shows full am I maybe am I supposed to point up here ah maybe we need a restart there we go let's turn to First John chapter 3 and yeah I just want to also just uh say to the um the kitchen staff the food has been great just thanks so much it's been great the service yeah yeah let's give them a hand and then just the behind the scenes team you know I think I've developed friends that I believe a lost the lifetime you know you are amazing people so God bless you all it's just been such a privilege to get to know you all so 1 John 3:14 it reades thus we know that we have passed from Death unto life why what is the one of the great indicators that you have changed you haven't changed life why because you we love the brethren we love each other he that loveth not his brother or his sister just putting a little disclaimer there abideth in death you know and that's quite a hard thing because no doubt things get sent and there's hurtful things that happen and uh you know you could Satan might just Chuck you in there and say you know um you know you don't have life in you because you have feelings one to another and and that's just a a lie of the devil because ultimately it's not that you will not have things happen amongst you but like said last night you some's going to have to give over those hurts to God and be willing for him to apply the soothing bomb and heal those and it can take a long time before you get there but now nonetheless your inward desire should always be this that I want to love my brother and sister irrespective of what they've done and said to me whosoever love hateth his brother is a murderer and he that knoweth no murderer hath Eternal and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of God how because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren amen it's not just about you it's it's not about your little bubble it's about extending the borders to each other but so but who so hath this world's good now this is where we have to be careful because it's easy to say brother I'm praying for you God bless you you know all these things but the Bible wants us to do more because it says here but Who whoo hath this world's good and seeth his brother have a need so you see your brother and sisters got a struggle and you shut up the balls of compassion from him then the question is how can the love of God dwell in you remember that little testimony I said about when I was young and I had just a new spirit how I condemn that guy at school for throwing the acorns but by God's Great later on he could change my spirit and I could realize I need to actually have compassion for these people cuz sudden as they don't know what they're doing and theyve just been inspired of the devil my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue cuz it's easy to say God bless you and I'll be praying for you but in indeed you need to do something about it and in truth amen sorry I know you've been standing but let's just do one more the longer you stand the more time it it buys me to you know preach a little longer so we're going to go second Peter 1 and don't worry you don't have to turn we'll just go through this quickly uh you know this all well but it's it's it's a direct type I'm sure many of you have seen the statue of a perfect man that is displayed in many churches and you would have seen the picture and this is the the scripture that refers to it and besides this giving or Ence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and to temper knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now that's not charity like giving to the poor it's charity of God's love himself the Capstone God himself amen so that's the what comes and caps it all off now look what it says about this for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren as a as a Christian nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and often this is what happens because you allow these things to come and you actually forget that he was purged from his old sins you forget what God did for you you forget the mercy and Grace when you were such a scumbag and a sinner you forget that God lifted you up from that condition and then you unfortunately get to place where you're not you just can't forgive and you can't help others so it's just a it is a real harsh condemnation I mean this is a harsh scripture right here you could say but if we just allow Christ to soothe and teach us these things I believe we'll be in a better place amen Let's Just Close Our Eyes in a word of prayer dear gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we thank you for your goodness and Grace and all you've done for us we believe you've been with us in this Camp thus far and Lord as we now come into the last service may you just be amongst us and just really have a wonderful work May people's lives just be different may they look at things different from this day forward and may you just help them in all their trials that are lay ahead and the characteristics of them that'll have to change and the temperaments Etc help us in Jesus name we pray amen amen so um you know you as I said you may be seated sorry austa was dismissed late you were seated late I'll preach late okay so uh don't worry I don't feel bad brother bam says do you notice I'm always late that's one of his characteristics anyway so I know you're all very familiar with this and he actually this is not correct you know why that Capstone has come down that happened 1963 so yes this is a very well-known thing and and actually brother Brandon preached the statute of a perfect man I believe is in 1962 before the seals so uh when the seals came down by God's grace we all know that picture of Christ on Sunset Mountain that was him coming down to cap us off and yes there was still Lots going to H to happen after that but he sets in motion everything else so you know we we we know there that those that are have been have been familiar with the teachings you know we had a a actually an age change so as much as uh your bodies and where you go to work and you go to school Etc your bodies are still in lishia you'll feel the effects absolutely you'll know you're in lishia it's so nice to know that spiritually speaking we've actually changed into a bride age you know an eagle age and Astronaut age there's been a distinct change of us but the fact of the that is we still bodily speaking and how we deal with each other still in a lan age okay like I said spiritually speaking we s in hard by God's grace but you will feel the effects and have to deal with the effects of Lisha now it's fascinating because as we know the the the pyramid uh situation how it builds up you know you see how uh you know he he shows the faith Foundation was laid by Paul which is the Ephesians Church age and we build our way up and uh you know as I said we are technically still in the ludian age when it refers to the conditions we we we live in and as we know brother Brandon was given uh in part to the ludan age but actually moving off into really actually the the the bride age that's where he's his main focus and point of coming to Earth but nonetheless you know this is where we are currently in the flesh realm so I found it fascinating that brotherly kindness was the attribute of Christ that he desired for the L age where your flesh has to deal with it's interesting it could it could have been patience it could have been something else but God knew in his in in in his for knowledge that we going to need brotherly kindness and sisterly kindness amongst us now understand this is not the agapa love this is not uh you know uh the The Incredible God that just forgives and everything it's a it's shall we say almost a a a a lesser form but not in a not in a bad still attribute of God but it's not in that uh that that peak of a Goa love it's more of a kindness and a love and a good feeling one to another so actually uh you'll see the meaning if you go in the original of that brotherly uh kindness and love in the Bible now you'll notice it says Philadelphia which is actually the age before us and brother BR actually says among amongst the John Wesley age there was amazing cooperation amongst the churches they really had a great drive to get the gospel out of it there and he actually says that was age of great brotherly love and kindness because they work together you know they get rid of their disputes they found a way to be agreeable so that's why it's actually funny enough the the original was Philadelphia but that word means love of brothers or sisters brotherly love and in the New Testament the love which Christians cherished for each other as Brethren and you can say well you know brother the Mark it's all very well what's what's the big the big deal what is Big when you start to see what the prophet says about these things because Satan's Drive is he knows yes he can only get so far but what is the best way to conquer the best way to conquer is if you can get division amongst your enemies am I right that's the best way and even God in the olden days and the Pharisees he did that many times where the the the the Philistines would start fighting each other you know you know the situation of Gideon you know blowing the horn and throwing down the thing and next they all just against each other and they didn't have to do anything they just they just slaughtered each other you know and and Satan knows these things and he's going to do his best to come amongst you sister against sister brother against brother feelings between each other the little relationships form you know feelings get built up and there's a break and there's hurt that is left it goes both ways so these things are real they they're going to be a part of us and and it's really big cuz look what the prophec is here okay so this it's talking about the the Palmer worm there's the cankerworm the Locust Etc but look what he says here so this little Palmer worm come around to take off the fruits and he says I've got two pages of fruits I want just to read some of it now look what the prophet says here first thing so this is first way of attack the first fruit he took off was brotherly love that's right that's one of the things that kills the church right there you know you can have great intentions you can want it but if Satan can get feelings amongst you that's going to be his first line of attack cuz yeah we great we all feeling on top of the world we're feeling awesome but Satan has got a lot of plans of attack when we leave here off the camp he's he's got things lined up for you and if you're not watching you're going to let things get in between you this is a sick world isn't it but you know what's the sickest body on Earth I say this with reverence not to be sacrilegious God forgive me if I say wrong the body of Jesus Christ it needs healing oh and look what it says it can only this is the prophet's words only be healed by brotherly love that's the sickest body I know of or broke to pieces and tore up God I pray for the healing of that body and you're the members of that body and how can we we get these things sorted out it's through brotherly love and it's quite a thought because you know brother will testify this as a pastor you'll be surprised how sick the body of Christ is when he people come to him in counsel and they find out the real trauma that goes on amongst us and it's often because we've allowed things we've allowed an entrance in now you know there's a there's a I don't know why it where it came at one point but there was a bit of an imbalance that unfortunately came in the message where we would so focus on word only and the spirit man that somehow we forgot that we're still humans we're still in this world and we're also human you are you are you are as much as you you know a theop you you got a theophany you still have a natural man on Earth and you have to deal with this guy okay you don't have a choice as much as we would love to as I say just be in control you know it you have your challenges so unfortunately we've had a situation when when when when we as ministers start talking about things that affect us more in the natural sense we get shut down like that's not spiritual enough but the reality is God has purposely given us tools it's wonderful I love the Seven Seals I love all these wonderful Divine mystery truths and it SS in my soul and it places me as a Believer because we know teaching places us but the reality is that we must make sure we also cater for The Human Side because if you don't you'll burn out or you'll have a a you know a situation where you just don't look at life like you should because you still a human that's why brother bam made no he wasn't scared to get out into nature and cut off meetings and say no I can't come to meetings I'm going to you know camp out go hunt for three weeks son was even longer cuz he knew he had to cater for the natural man he had natural things he enjoyed he loved he loved some sports he you know he was a boxer when he was young you know and I I listen he didn't say in the message but someone says said that if he was walking in like what you call a mo today and he saw some boxing on the TV he couldn't help but just hey let's check it out a bit you know he was a boxer in his nature and even though he says I was a safe person he says there still the natural Man part he even talks about that Indian nature that he used to have he says that Indian nature even though I got a rebirth experience it still was part of my makeup so there it's not a problem that's what I'm trying to say don't don't feel bad if you enjoy I I enjoy sports I'm going to be honest I enjoy sports I was a I was big into Cricket We some of the brothers we were talking about the other day I love my Cricket and I was pretty good at Cricket too I'm not bragging but I was and not not now I know not I was going to be disaster Zone but nonetheless back in the day I wasn't too bad and I loved it but there came a point when I realized it wasn't healthy for me it was the environments lot of uh you know F language and you know obviously uh the real good leagues they play on Sunday and and whatever so it just they came a point where I realized this is this is not for me and also I had to become a family man man and all those things and you know responsibility so there's a time you give up things but to be honest so if I walk you know if I see a cricket highlights I'm going to check it out it's like hey let's see this cuz I understand the the psyche as I say that's maybe me you guys might like something else you know whatever basketball think and obviously we have to be careful because that can overtake us also so yes you have to cater for the natural man but what Satan tries to do is push you so over this side and then you forget about spiritual man because just like you have to feed yourself Naturally Speaking you know we have our three meals a day and we even have what do you call it supper still what supper There we go the fourth meal of the day the Jubilee meal um you know even though we have that you know the end of the day is uh you also a spiritual man and if you're not going to feed the spirit man well you're going to be starving and lose weight spiritually speaking so you have to daily also allow for it you have to have a form of discipline so yes you're natural man you have to go to school you have to go to work you have to eat whatever whatever but you need to make time you know brother bam talks about a Christian should read at least one chapter of the Bible a day that's what he recommends and daily two one in the morning one in the evening and and put on a tape for 20 30 minutes It'll Do Your World of good and get on those knees like we heard you know this the weakest believer on his knees gets the whole Satan's uh you know uh Kingdom trembling because they know the power of a prayer you such as you know such as I when I'm in such a bad State like I've just really feel like I've messed up and displeased the Lord and I just feel like you know man I just wish I could what you know the situation you know what I actually get a real kick out of getting on my knees cuz it's like yes devil you got me but I'm it's so nice knowing that when I'm getting on my knees you are trembling back home I just love it it's like I'm getting one back at the Devil like you got me but I'm getting you back now because I know the effect that it's causing cuz he doesn't know what I'm saying to God and where I'm sorting out and cleaning out things cuz he knows as soon as you say sorry it's gone it's like gone disappeared yes we remember we have to deal with the consequences but in God's eyes it's disappeared totally vanished away so yeah we need to understand this so this quote I know many of you might know it but yet again I'm just going to go through it again because I need to lay a platform and I'm going to this is to help us all remember why do we get these little things in between us and it's often not an understanding of understanding the different people and temperaments and way they operate and that's what causes divisions and like I said some people are so spiritual no you can't talk about these things well the prophet talked about it so it's in the message as much as he preached the seals he preached these things so just say it as it is let's just get on the same platform the seals and everything we love but he also preached this cuz he was a balanced Christian okay so let's be balanced and let's not be overs spiritual with everything because this is the reality of life it's been one of the most amazing things I've ever noticed along in the lines of my Ministry for our Lord is the peculiarity of people cuz we're all different we have about different makeups look what he says here and the study some people call this psychology but look what he says you and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study that's the prophet speaking not Michael you take it or reject it it's there in the message you can't deny it to watch the nature of people and that's you know like I said that's what you could say psychology in a way but obviously psychology faltered through the word of God the psychology the world presents it has some a form of benefit and truth but it can't can only go so far cuz ultimately you need the supernatural element to back these things up you know it's not just psychology It's Supernatural psychology amen but we need as humans sometimes just a bit of psychology to say hey you got it you can do this that's psychology you know if you're Son of God you you you make it it anyways but when you're down pit you need someone to come and say you got this you know I'm here you're going to be good that's normal we're humans we need that sometimes and look what he says here this is fascinating he says in the different parts of the Nations and worlds to to where you go you'll notice there's a different attitude that people take towards Christ towards his service and towards his uh service towards a servants towards worship I mean the way you worship is different to what I'm used to and it's okay because I can see the spirit is pleased I get up here I'm feeling comfortable the spirit is here so you know we can be so quick to judge that that something I had to deal with I came from a very conservative white background and um you know for me to see someone just just be expressive to the Lord and jumping around and having a wonderful time in the in the presence of the Lord being a a white conservative uh person and I'm not saying all whites are conservative I'm saying me the way I was raised don't get me wrong you know the end of the day is that was something when I saw that it it's let me just say it as it is I thought that was not the Holy Ghost honestly I was like there's no way that the holy ghost that just can't be because that's just how will the holy ghost ever allow these type of things and then the Holy Ghost whispered to me and he said listen buddy don't let your shall we say tradition or the way you were raised in your mind make that as the shall we say the ultimatum if that is the holy ghost or not don't let your tradition say that's the holy ghost or not just because I feel uncomfortable cuz I'm feeling uncomfortable I'm feeling the a bit like grieved if I can put it like that cuz I'm not used to this and immediately my mind is saying this can't be the Holy Ghost cuz I'm not comfortable and then God say wait a second buddy watch the spirit on the person and what they trying to achieve and yes if it's for showman and trying to get attention and and and dancing provocative and whatever these things of course there's a problem there and it needs to be corrected but the end of the day is you know I'd watch these sisters they'll just be so happy or brothers and just rejoicing just so happy and then I looked at the eyes I looked at the spirit I realized oh man I want some of that actually you know and yes maybe my personality will never let me get to that point but you have to realize don't judge people by the way you were brought up judge it by the spirit behind it and let God even if they wrong let me say this even if they wrong allow the Holy Spirit to sort it out and not let your judgmental attitude sort it out okay and one of the things has been that one type of meeting will just be wonderful in one part of the country where it won't work in the other part of the country fascinating because why we have different temperamental different cultures things like that I was speaking to some of the brothers that go up to some of these Islands nearby and the way they dress they all these traditional things that is like weird for them you they're preaching to you know people that are dress a certain way and it just it's hard but you have to look past that and say well Lord in your good time if it's wrong you're going to sort it out but uh these people love you and let me minister to the need so there's different personality types there's different Natures of people now what was brother brandham he says yeah I'm a temperamental person Melancholy sort of person so he says he tells you his nature is human nature I can't let myself get away but now this is the important part because of his nature what does he say Satan takes advantage uh of that on me so we all we're going to go through this now we all have our little temperamental and personality traits and there's positives and there's negatives and Satan's going to focus on the negatives to try and slip you up and and and vice versa there's such positives that God can use if you're him but you're going to have to deal with that and most of the time we have conflicts amongst Brethren because of different personality types that come up against each other we'll show you now see I'm one of those types that could break down of course say goodbye to you in a few minutes I'd better do it but just so express myself I'll probably go to cry he's just a a Melancholy of heart you know if we break up now this youth service he's the type of nature he would he would put on his smile and everything when he's back home he's crying he's like I miss it I so enjoyed being amongst the people he loved the people but his nature just got affected by it and he says Satan used to take hold of him remember I speaking to you about the uh inferior complex he tolds you one of the main reasons why it drove me because of the rejection of the people because he was Melancholy by Nature because the people rejected him that is how Satan got in there and started to build up all these feelings that he's just going to run away to the Wilderness and try and Escape all that hurt instead of dealing with it because of his nature now another thing I want you to notice about brother brandom he was he was 100% a child of God a minister a pastor he was married he had a child and you know what happened because he listened to his mother-in-law that he lost his wife and his child this is a holy ghost minister of the Gospel the prophet of our age a major prophet no greater man most be born of a woman tried to commit suicide twice because of his Melancholy nature you can have the Holy Ghost but Satan can work it against your nature against you and you can find yourself in places that you shouldn't be so yes these things are powerful and if you want to ignore them do it at your peril it's fine but he's then Satan's just going to play you like a puppet and there comes a point when you have to start realizing who you are and identify your weaknesses what is the what does brother BR says how do you overcome to identify the devil in all his tricks including your own nature against you we trying to give you tools in the weeks and years ahead wherever however long the Lord carries so does anyone know okay well the four temperaments so we already covered melancholic now the best example in the Bible is mosha Elijah the highs and the lows of Elijah one minute he's rebuking uh you know killing the you know the fires coming down the altar you know killing off the prophets you know overcome and next minute he hear his word that Jezebel says I'm going to kill you he runs for his life and goes and mopes and becomes all depressed by the river and godest and God leaves him he's okay he understands Elijah he doesn't come there like Elijah my Prophet how dare you you no he's just leaves them and then slowly he starts to come and you if you can go read it how the Lord builds up and eventually comes to him in a small still voice that speaks to him so God understands this he's not he wasn't upset with Elijah he didn't blame him he didn't do nothing he left Elijah brother brandham also was melancholic and he had obviously had the spirit of Elijah like we know says no wonder okay does anyone else know another one coloric okay koric are we going to come to now I want another one sanguine another one last one flagma okay so we'll next go to flagma now fmatic we're going to go through but just to say in short which is my uh home base uh temperament is we very laidback and it takes a lot to drive us and a great example was Timothy because Paul was like come on Timothy you need to get out there you need to have faith step forward that people need you go and preach and Timothy's like oh I don't want you know uh but this is it this is what what what Timothy was he was a fmatic and uh he needed a bit of pushing you know to get the you know what do we say a bit of fire uh under him get get him get him going so there's the fmatic nature then we have sanguan we'll go through this now but sanguan Peter is the ultimate sanguan man he's the he's the loud one he's the one that you know uh you know he's is just like the the sort of like the shall we say the the the the vibe of the party you know he's like he's the the main attraction and you just see Peter he's always the first one to come and say something and he as much as he he gets into some good things he just as quickly gets himself into bad things you know as we said yesterday one minute he's saying you know Thou Art the son of the Living God and the next minute sat Jesus to say to him get there behind me Satan you know because this guy you know he's just his nature you know then the last one is cheric oh poor man if you go read Paul this guy was rough I mean he doesn't hold back I went and rebuked to Peter directly in his face not like trying to sit down you know can we talk this over he's a cleric he's just a he just boom you know he's a bulldozzer he just you know and these are examples in the Bible and you can clearly see it Go and read the scriptures you'll be fascinating to see how it is so let's go through some of these things hey and these things like I said you have to be so careful because there is the strengths and there's the weaknesses and you have to acknowledge both you must let the strengths be used of God but you must be careful that Satan also with the weaknesses is going to attack you in them so you must make sure you watch yourself so like I said there's the sanguine uh you know that's that's the peders of this world they're sociable charismatic like I say they the the vibe of the party you know you're going to Sure know when they arve they like the peacocks I a rough woo I'm here you know they are the guys like I said that uh you know you know they're there you know they're there and you there's no way you're going to miss them cuz they there they're at the party they're outgoing confident warmhearted Pleasant people they're Lively like us like we saying optimistic fun lover yeah let's go do this woo and we all often like sanguan guys and girls spontaneous a preventer of dull moments you know when you have that like quiet in the room and then there'll be like a sanguan so what we doing now you know let's go play games let's have fun he's a quick apologizer and an easy friend maker okay so so there's guys and girls like that in this room right now and uh you know they're cool we like these guys and girls but you better be careful because if you're not careful Satan also uses the negatives for it so uh this is now the weaknesses of these people they impulsive hey let's go to let's go to uh you know down to the beach today but you actually have to work but yeah let's do it cuz I fun yeah you forget about duties and and things that are important you know hey do you want to come to my party it's this Saturday yeah yeah yeah a phone call later hey do you want to come to this Gathering we're going to get the young people yeah yeah yeah hey uh we're going on a hike this satday do you want to join yeah yeah yeah next minute I've got three appointments but I didn't want to be left out because you know I'm the the the cool guy you know I want to get I want to please everyone and suddenly you have the tendency to start becoming a liar and getting yourself into position you shouldn't be chronically late why because the peacock is getting all the feathers aligned and ready um some Shameless you know forgetful you couldn't remember you promised that and that and then you get in the core hey where are you ahof I forgot I promised someone else another appointment a compulsive talker yeah some guys just the girls man it's just like hey can we like have a open conversation yo it's not just you okay it's not just you too loud sometimes too happy okay can we just have a bit of luck distractable go to the zoom in the bottom there uh not interested in following and so you need to be a you need to be part of a team you know you need to suddenly submit that and say hey I I want to I want to be I want to work this out together and bet you with those little skits uh some of those traits were coming up not interested in following through the tasks that are boring self-absorbed and exaggerator man the fish was that's big it was incredible I fought it it was incredible it was like Wow meanwhile and then sometimes Unfortunately they can appear um authentic you know because you know it's all big ho haa and eventually people like catch on it's like ah you know so yeah you're going to have to if you're a sangan and some of you might ask well I don't know quite what I am well maybe ask a few friends or maybe just there is some good tests online you can Google uh how to find my temperament and then they'll ask you some questions and it'll split out uh thing and remember you can be affected you most likely everyone is affected in a small way about this doesn't mean you're 100% that but you just genely have a dominant one um you do get the extreme R where someone will have a whole bunch but uh like almost in the middle if you can say but generally you're going to have a a strong one so yeah um just go back sorry Brew this is something I wanted to highlight um so there you'll say soci soci socially useful so they're great if you want to get things going get a sanguan on board you know he's going to make she's going to make things go great actors you know they're not they're not scared to just get in front of the camera and display the peacock feathers they they ready they're ready they want to they willing okay they want to this is my ground this is where I'm comfortable good salesman man they'll talk talk talk talk talk and they'll eventually like okay just sell me the stupid thing I'm done you know but they just they're good good speakers stuff like that they actually also the the underline is air an air sign which means they're not always grounded and they tend to around yeah so there we go so there's our good old sanguine so let's go to uh ceric brother poor now we need clerics and I actually have a bit of ceric my my my dominant one is sang um uh fmatic but uh I I actually developed a bit of goric as I got older and had to realize I needed to sort out some problems that I had but we'll go there now so yeah um these guys are the the ruler dominating type you know it's their way you know it's like tunnel vision we'll get there now and they they're good leaders actually but they've got very bad people skills most of the time so often your bosses are cleric but they don't know how to like say hey good job you're such a benefit to the company you very seldom hear that unless they've gone for some you know some some counseling and realizing they need to be a bit more nicer but you know these guys you know producers of the movies you know they're like yeah the scene and no you weren't there you need to be there and they just have this vision and they want to see it and they drive it they build it so positive things but yet again strengths and weaknesses we'll go through the strengths ambitious passionate people leader-like they focus they so Focus efficient look at Paul I mean before he becomes a Christian he's a cheric you can see he's just going off to the churches like on a mission this guy is on a mission and it's so beautiful cuz God took that same CL nature against the church and swung it around for his sake and then he became a cheric against the forces of evil who just like so dominant so going ahead so focused I mean Paul what a guy in that way you know efficient very practical they very good at planners if you want to make an event go well and and things to work out get a cleric they're going to do a good job it's already a bit cleric let's go down okay uh good at problem solving they're very good they sort out things they're confident in their nature motivating a delegator you do this you you you play that part Etc usually right in their eyes at least doesn't mean they are but in their eyes they're usually right and yeah because they are so like Focus minded they Absol they can take a task and really focus on it and they become quite good at it that's why they're good leaders and they're good business people because they have a vision and they just drive that through greater an emergency cuz he's just he he can focus he's all like what am I going to do he's just like okay you get that and you go there pull this thing and boom bo boom and before you know the the situation under control that's a cleric so we need some clerics when the emergencies come we don't want a A fmatic in the emergency well should we call 911 or should we call the fiber GR and by that time the house is burned down you know so you need a cleric to make some moves here okay let's go back to the the negatives here okay some weaknesses they aggressive it's my way or no way okay you better get yourself in line get in line with the company's Vision otherwise you can catch the highway for I care domineering they inter flexible but boss you know can't we no it's my way listen to me I know what I'm doing impatient this is a big problem of clerics they very impatient with understanding other people and like I said if you know you're cleric you need to take note of these things they rude and tus they just say it as it is it's like oh you could have said it a little bit softer man you didn't have to say I'm that ugly just said you know only your mother can love you or whatever just but you don't have to be so harsh man and yet they really yo these guys are rough hope he doesn't mind me saying but I have like a 80 90% cheric uh uh brother-in-law if you hear this brother-in-law forgive me hopefully you don't but yes this guy I work for him man it was rough so we're on outdoor sites and you know as I said I'm ftic and this guy is just like he's a task master he's like and it's like yeah and like for me it's it's straight he's like it's not straight make it straighter go walk there walk yeah walk there walk yeah walk yeah man he was rough rude and tackas argumentative unable to relax they sit down for 5 minutes they're up again hey just chill yeah yeah I know and you sit down and then before you get it they up in another Direction uncomfortable around emotion someone get emotion man they just they don't know what to do low on empathy don't really understand and put themselves in other people's shoes like I said even though you're in this God can do something for you discouraged by failures so a a cheric you know for him it's like the world to to achieve his dream and if things go wrong with his dream it can almost make him almost suicidal cuz he's not prepared to see that there's maybe more going on around him and so it actually can be a real problem when you are so focused on what I must achieve and then it falls apart and then you feel like a complete failure and that you're just useless meanwhile it's okay just get up there'll be another opportunity but clerics are because they're so tunnel vision so minded it can be a real problem too busy for people come come come come what why are you taking so long stop brushing your teeth come get in the car what's going on intolerance and they demand loyalty they want if you if you don't show loyalty to keric hey it's going to be hard for them it's going to be hard for them it's going to be hurting so yeah they are the more hot shall we say quick response people they they got it they they ready they're ready ready go go go now let's move to the other side the more chilled out people yeah I hope I got some chilled out people in the house so we got some chilled out people yeah let's go let's go okay let's go to the next one Brew like I said you need to understand God is giving you nature and you're going to see what the prophet says it's not bad that with when God when God gives you particular nature it's just what you do with it okay fmatic let's now make me the the test dummy okay so I'm relaxed it is good to relax sometimes we need to be relaxed sometimes quiet and calm it's true you can ask my wife I'm I'm the calm one in the in the family when things start going crazy I'm chill content with themselves we generally pretty kind yeah consistent H yeah a steady and faithful friend yeah I believe I am hey some good stuff here keep going keep going uh accepting affectionate diplomatic you know peacemakers rational curious oo that was a bad one for me because I got curious about some bad things at one stage but anyways The Lord At least sorted that out but nonetheless observant and easy friend maker so yeah we good guys right right oh boy let's see what it says about about me now sometimes shy yeah that's true I really struggle I'll be honest maybe this will surprise you cuz I'm standing behind the pulpit and seem so relaxed and so so so good but I really struggle in a big crowd like I really do like I rather just stand quietly on the sidelines but yet again if you told me hey make something happen then I'm cool then I'll get involved and I'll coordinate but I'm not comfortable in a big crowd it's just that's my nature it just is what it is fearful of change yeah that is so true with with me I you know I've I'm like I've been with my job now for what uh 17 18 years same company I don't like change I don't like to move around I don't like I like just to have my root settled that's that's my nature but this is where the problem comes in I'm prone to laziness now you don't may not know this but Alo and I actually worked for a portion of time and this is unfortunately there was some weaknesses that really came through in my work life where I was literally prone to laziness I had like almost no ambition I didn't pursue and and I actually almost got fired not under brother Al such but under a different division and then the Lord made a way and then I I went through life sort of just hanging in there and then I got married and and then there came a point where I realized I need to really provide for my family and I need to tackle this laziness issue I've got and by God's grace he helped me deal with this laziness and but I still you'll be honest when I want to just become relaxed I automatically want to become lazy again and I have to tell motivate myself hey get off this chair and work and I say it might seem strange but that's my nature I just like to to to to to to sit around but but when I then but then as I said it's a inward motivation that's why I say I was naturally uh uh fmatic but I managed to get a bit of choleric and start you know pushing the head a bit more but hopefully with still the good stuff attached to it stubborn yeah we can be a bit stubborn at times you know passive aggressive indecisive no I don't think that's one of my weaknesses no no not no I'm not indecisive I think that's one thing I've either the Lord's delivered me or you know just like I said it's not going to be 100% but there'll be some things permissive uh not goal orientated exactly it comes in with the laziness it's un exactly the same unenthusiastic that's something I had to work on that's why some's good to be married because you'll marry the your better half that will teach you some things that you need to get a bit of life or whatever going into certain things you know uh too compromising that's truth I have to be careful there you know I sometimes have to tell myself hey you know you need to now make a stand and be a bit more firm maybe about these things you know undisciplined H I don't think I'm quite that I'm pretty good I think uh when it comes to the kids at least and stuff like that uh sarcastic yay I struggle with this one yeah I know sometimes as I've hurt some people but I miss so I try to that's something I've just Tred to watch because some people don't take well to sarcasm and sometimes sarcasm has a bit of a nasty Edge to it you you've been sarcastic but you're trying to make a point and not always but you know in certain environments it's just good old friends but I need to watch that thing of me cuz I naturally am sarcastic and I like being sarcastic but it can hurt so I must be careful discouraging I must say I'm okay my my other sort of natural n nature I don't really get discouraged thankfully I've been at my moment I must say during Co I got very discouraged because you know sitting at home can't work for my family funds was a massive issue so yeah then then I I I touched Bas a little bit there but generally I'm okay uh non participative um yeah middle of the road something like that but like I said you guys would know roughly where you would fit in there okay and then melancholic that's my wife but not in a bad way not in a you know we need to understand and she we her and I have spoken about these things that we need to watch these things and that's why also when you get married it can be a real blessing if you really understand this cuz then you can help your partner and vice versa she can help me and I can help her so this is where the Prophet was and you can actually see it in his actions and the way the messenger was delivered we needed a Melancholy Prophet that may sound strange but you'll see now the strength of it and even to a to a form of weaknesses that the prophet had that actually was real a benefit and made the message what it was God used that nature for his benefit so brother Brandon was thoughtful he was considerate that really you can see it in the prayer lines you can see those one-on-one interviews uh and and even uh you know people's testimonies of how they were around the prophet um you know really really nice he was cautious he actually got rebuked by the the angel one time cuz he never wanted to move forward unless he had a direct visitation uh uh vision from uh the the Lord and the angel came to him and rebuked him and said stop pretty much stop being so cautious and just let the Holy Ghost leading come and he will show you where to go but stop always waiting for a vision cuz brother Bram was overly cautious organized an excessive planner man these people cross their Bridges like way before they meant to like it like painful it's like why are you talking about that in 3 years this might take what are you going about who it might never happen why are you even thinking about that's what I'm saying but my wife she doesn't mind we we got an open relationship in that way she's like this she's an excessive planner keeps crossing her Bridges oh but what if this one says that and and then I'm going to come in this situation and they're going to say this and I'm like you haven't even spoken about it what are you saying and then often she gets to that situation and the whole thing blows up and then it's like oh oh that wasn't too bad man I may spent hours worried about this thing sleepness nights and it was like yeah it's fun what that all yeah it's fun schedule oriented when they can of course not always but yeah they like a schedule they like to know what's going on very detailed which is nice it's in a small detail you can see good things highly creative and poetry art and invention most of the time not always and most of the time poets and artists and stuff are naturally um uh Melancholy by nature but it's also very dangerous cuz like brother BR shows in some of the message you're going on a massive High and you write an incredible song an incredible poem or whatever and then you go crashing way down and then the devil meets you at the bottom and unfortunately even some artists is very well known you can go look at it they they eventually go crazy they L up insane institutions and stuff because they can't handle this and you're going to have to understand God can use the highs absolutely but just remember what's coming and say Lord I need you now walk with me in the valley that I'm about to enter but you're incredible amazing people really creative lovely bunch to be around in that way uh independent and good at preventing problems so you can see this was a really needed even in the message many of these good qualities you know understanding problems of of in a spiritual sense and and letting the Lord reveal it and then laying it out so let's go to the weaknesses here so yeah unfortunately they a bit obsessive they can really really go over the top with some stuff it's just like man it doesn't have to be that clean okay just leave it alone the dust is happy there it doesn't need to be removed just leave it but it's like there must shine Sparkle and you know they're really like too cautious you know they don't want to venture out in the unknown and it's scary territory you know but if you had a ceric or a sanguan they just like no issues but but yeah The Melancholy is very cautious but this is the problem now with Melancholy you are prone to depression like the prophet often struggled with depression so if you're prone to depression you have to watch that because that depressive uh uh sort of a weakness Satan will try and use it and get in there and you'll literally start having suicidal thoughts and all these things I'm not good enough I don't have what it takes you know I'm Just a Nobody I'm this and I'm that and I'm not pretty enough and I'm not handsome enough or whatever it is that you think is important in your eyes and he'll come and take that and try and make you so deep in depression that you you'll want to take your life and the prophet struggled with this like I said because he so disappointed with himself that he didn't follow God and then the re remember what he remember he sold the principle you you you you reap what you sow and unfortunately the the the reaping was horrible and he just wanted to end his life right there and then but by God's grace God intervened Amen cuz he pulled the trigger he put his hand on that electric wire to be electrocuted he did not stop it was God that somehow broke the link between the bullet and that electric wire because he would have been dead if it wasn't for God's intervention and may the Lord intervene for every single time any of you may enter those dark places that there will be someone to help you in the time of need and I want you to look out for each other to watch for these things please and remember the depressive people what do most people say when they when their kids find out their kids have committed suicide the parents come and say oh but he looked fine he looked happy we didn't know you have to watch out because sometimes it's just a facade it's just a picture they putting on but deep down inside there's deep hurt and you need to go some to those places and explore and just touch base and just check and make sure and just like how you doing oh I'm fine don't just take I am fine maybe just spend some time and they just need someone to give them a good word and a good season because my wife she doesn't mind saying this but you know we went through a massive trial as a family because my wife after the birth of my second son her adrenal glands practically well they did collapse now for me it's very weird because I like I said my nature you know is I don't struggle with that stuff as I said I'm generally a very happy person but what remember how does the devil work he finds a weakness remember the mind like the damage and that's when he gets a a demon in that channel so what my wife had she got adrenal fatigue and the devil got in depression the demon of depression so the body had a weakness the devil found it and it is depressing because you think about it my M my wife wants to be a mother she wants to be a wife to me and now she doesn't have the energy to deal with it and how she would describe it and as it say strange but it's almost like you're lying on the bed and something is pushing you into the bed that it even feels hard to raise your hand now that something is weird if you don't understand it but if you we were by God's grace you had an open dialect that she could honestly speak to these things and I could in my best ability try and put myself in her shoes and then we would work around it was it tough absolutely I had to at one stage become the mother the you know the cleaner the cook you know everything because my wife couldn't but there was a season we took through and by God's grace we came out but she was be honest she said she came to a point when she had Suicidal Thoughts I remember once she had a real bad moment and she fo me say I can't do this please come and pick up the kids and take them to the grandparents and when I saw her and the way she kissed my kids goodbye I thought I might come back to her lying in the blood bath or something like that because it looked like she was at her end and I was just praying and saying Lord please undertake I knew I had to get the kids out and there's going to be a space of time before I can get back home by God's grace he helped him this is what you to understand people look at uh suicide as a shall we say a a a selfish thing they think that people do it because they're selfish and they just want to sort of cut themselves from the world and they they don't want to it's not like that a a suicidal person thinks they doing you a favor by removing themselves out of your life that's how it actually goes it's not that they're selfish they're actually thinking they're doing you a favor by removing because you are better without them so my wife would look at my burden obviously having to say fulfill the roles of the whole family cuzz she was too weak to do anything and ultimately she was thinking it's better I just die so that my husband can marry another woman and then at least they can have a normal household meanwhile I loved her and she was the one that God gave to me and I just wouldn't want anyone else and I had to remind her and encourage her during the dark times so these are real things brothers and sisters and if you want to ignore them you do it at your peril and brother baham says God's grace is amazing cuz he shows there in the de demonology say is that even if you completely lose your mind God can still be with you and you can have the Holy Ghost and still be a saved Son of God or a daughter of God even if you lose your mind completely so yes there's Grace that extends right through but let's not get there we have the tools to prevent these things we just need to be out remember we're talking about brotherly kindness sisterly kindness let's look out for each other and and and trust and Trust to open yourself and I want to say this brother and sisters make yourself trustworthy that when a fellow youth member friend comes to you that stays between you some of us I don't know why we have this urge that we want to share little things amongst us become a trustworthy faithful friend because there was such power in that and it's tempting hey there's some juicy stories out there but keep it to yourself man that's when unfortunately these things come between us and then we find there's division amongst us but there's such strength lying in these pews before me you are such a strength to each other and when the Bible says confess your faults one to the other it must be under the sanctity and the umbrella of complete trust so if someone comes to you honestly and says listen pray for me brother I have suffering from pornography you know fellow sister pray for me I'm feeling like I just want to expose myself and get attention from other boys and stuff there's something I'm lacking don't now share that you make that your little Santi between you and have a little WhatsApp connection pray for me I'm feeling really bad at the moment so you that are even depressive don't be ashamed to tell someone that hey I'm struggling with depression by now we should be a mature enough Christians to understand that these things can be amongst us we not exempt from it sicknesses don't stop here okay they don't stop here many think in the message that sickness is only allowed to stop you can have cancer you know you can have high blood pressure praise God we praying for you you you have depression that's a devil that needs to remove of course it's a devil but so is flu a devil that's yours to get everything's a devil okay so you need to be balanced with these things and stop and just break what you think is is the realities of of what you think is the message and let yourself open to all things so these depressive things many a Christian has died inside because they couldn't open up themselves cuz they knew it's going to have such bad backlash and they're going to get such cuz when you are depressed the last thing you want to hear you know is someone even adding more coal on the fire like we say more pressure so you just rather keep it to yourself and you live in this world of of continuous cycle when there's help out there there is such strength amongst each other if we would just allow it so make yourself a trustworthy friend and if you have broken that trust go and make it right and say From This Day Forward by God's grace I'll be the friend you need me to be and I'll be the brother you need me to be amen have I got you by in there amen let's be that I mean let's be let's be real because essentially we have each other and so much strength lies in front of us where was I perfectionist pessimistic uh I said depression prone to moodiness brother Bram so many times says I'm a moody person he says it so many times go go type in Moody you'll be surprised how many times whether brah talks about him being moody or stuff like that because was a Melancholy perfectionist now this was strange this is actually a weakness but but God took it around and make it a positive for the message I want a perfectionistic message I want a prophet that will double check everything with the scripture am I sure this is right you know and when he came and brought us the message we had a true you know Wonderful message so God can use some of these things and turn it around where were we uh pessimistic unfortunately yeah you can be a bit too pessimistic look on the B side difficult to please let's go to the bottom half the brother Joe uh deeply affected by tragedy some people just feel feel hurt a lot more some of us like a a cheric you know it's like okay we buryed them next you know it's just like they're rough I mean but like you'll see others they will weeping you can see they're so burdened you know and you know we need to make space for these people you know we need to make sure we understand there different people around us you know a person with tunnel vision sometimes a procrastinator yeah yeah that's yeah I know that I'm married to one forgive me love don't worry we we open dialect remember we have to be honest and open in order to get somewhere and as I said I've I've I've also got all my bad points but we talk about it we even laugh about it you know and it's cool because we must acknowledge these things and S as it's good to make humor of it you know so and tease each other you know whatever it is you know because it's good to understand it and by acknowledging it remember how do you solve something find the root cause we spoke about that yesterday so acknowledge I've got a problem and I need to sort it out and when as I said you got each other discontent with themselves and others always CR very critical on themselves I have to constantly tell my wife you you're amazing you're beautiful you're incredible because she needs that and I think most people actually need a bit of that I think we all need even the cheric that's super confident and a bulldozer needs down again to say hey good job you know prone to play the mar yeah you'll be the victim no don't have that mentality amen because Satan yet again will will go there and say you know you don't have what it takes you know and then the the natural Melancholy person you can see with the prophet go through all these rough hard things so yeah these things are interesting and like I said if you don't know quite where you fit in and you could have a bit of both or you could have quite a nice mixture you know as I said go and Google it you'll find some good tests you can do online but these things are really important and like I said you you can ignore them fine but the prophet said I'm Melancholy and the devil uses that against me we going to expose the devil on all his tricks and you need understand where he's going to get you because all of these things have weaknesses a lot of positives but they have the weaknesses and you have to acknowledge those weaknesses and work on them okay let's move on now this is just to give you an example of the process of getting us so maybe one of those things is stubborn I was the fmatic one of my weaknesses with stubbornness okay so we have to know how do we deal with this what do I do to sort out these things brother brandham I'm saved so yeah you're a Christian wow wonderful and mean baptized in the name of Jesus H but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you get people that's got a stubborn spirit it's usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited from a mother father uncle aunt or grandmother Grand grandfather something like that it's in your traits because remember a lot of your these Temperance you're talking about you've been affected through lineages and all these things that have come down and if you're Trace back through your life you'll find now I've taken this by experience under the zman because I've met uh cases on the platform thousands of those who had that spirit so he knows it a lot of people got this problem and the the first thing you know I'll chase that Spirit right back by discernment and find out that it was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was something else back there and you inherit that by Nature stubborn stubbornness is not of God so those weaknesses we went through it's not an excuse as much as God understands you and he understanded Elijah when he formed him and but he still had to get Elijah out of that condition but God has a way to deal with it you know thank God thank thank goodness we have a God that really knows how to deal with us and now the only way you get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome that you are Christians you have to say Lord remember we spoke about it yesterday you're going to have to identify the problem I've got a weakness I've got a I've got this issue Lord help me and Deliver Me from that put your faith forward and even yet again we said yesterday even when you see yourself fail don't focus on the failing focus on the confession and the faith and then let him heal the situation and this can take years sometimes you are a son or daughter of God whichever you may be and you'll never be able just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it now listen we need we need to be prayed over sometimes but sometimes we can be a little bit over the top because as much as you know as I said I can stand here and say in the name of Jesus Christ remove yourself or brother Bram sayia you know if you want to say I rebuke that uh stub nature me I rebuke it I rebuke it it's fine but you're actually giving it attention essentially you're giving it so much attention when that's not actually the point that's not actually what isn't what is needed we need to get that thing out and we need to rather focus on the faith element look what he says here just like tantalizing a rattlesnake wow hey the prophet has such wisdom with these things it's unbel unable so yeah you want to just rebuke and rebuke and and hit it hard and just put all your attention on it you have to S of just commit it to God and move on and ignore it but if you never want to move on with God you want to stay with this thing and keep going keep going you just playing with a rat or snake and he's going to bite you and bite you over and over again and you're never going to move on as a Christian because you're so focused on this thing meanwhile committed to God have faith he'll sorted out in this time with it's one second as a miracle or 10 years as a healing either way you've committed to God and you ignore that thing and every time this is what the prophet gives us a solution I love it cuz he doesn't just leave it there he's laying there ready to bite you this is the secret if you'll just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you so when you feel that you got a stubborn Spirit lay on the that thing on the altar we heard that the first service amen and believe God that the thing is dead just believe it whether it's still showing its ugly head just believe it and you'll never have it no more and go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil and he will flee from you that's get away quickly that's what resist means so that would be my advice to overcome it we overcome the Devil by faith that's what we overcome all evil is by faith and Faith like I say now let me say this now Faith is a tough thing why it feels like a hypocrite oh I'm confessing I'm I'm delivered but back at the ranch I'm still messing up I'm a hypocrite I don't have faith faith says you look to the things that are unseen as though they are done you have to ignore what you are seeing what you are feeling and you still seeing some of the bad traits come out and say Lord I've prayed about this I really committed to it I'm not going to give it attention I'm moving on and ignoring yes you might have to make some things right because you lost your temper or whatever else yeah that's fine that's still Christian but all I'm saying is you ignore that thing and you don't give it attention oh but Lord please deliver me you already prayed about it why are you asking him again are you telling him how God couldn't deliver you the first time you asked of course he can he has you have to now have faith in what you asked cuz if you have a real heart that wants to get rid of stuff and deliver commit it to God and then keep moving on and never mind if you how many times you fall what does this Solomon say blessed is the man that fth seven times yet rises again and this is where you I made this mistake as a young youth every Camp I would run back to the altar and just re you know restart again no no no the Christian walks like this I'm running the race oh I trip up I F I don't I go back to the starting race I get up from where I am and I start running again that's what you need to focus on stop letting the devil say you have to get back to the altar he's already done the work you must just keep moving and it's hard because Faith makes you deny things that you like but it is I see it I messed up again today he's just saying to you God's saying just have faith in me I'm going to sort it out I know it's hard but just deny your I mean the problem of society today everything must be so factual and prove it and show me on Google you know Faith doesn't work like that you're just going to have to trust God and believe well we thankful to the Lord amen be thankful for all things so now he's talking about his nature so yeah be thankful he made you a ceric be thankful he made you sanguine be thankful he made you Melancholy cuz God needs you he needs your nature cuz look what the prophet says here I am thus because I am thus I am what I am I can't help it God made me that way and I can't do nothing but what he made me Melancholy and these kind of things that comes to the package so don't don't be sad that God Made You melan col you know I'm so depressed prone God you can just commit it to God and he can help you so don't don't despise yourself don't despise what God made you cuz he has a great purpose cuz you have lots of strengths he can use you just have to focus on that them they tell me I just have to be that way in order to to be the help that he sent me here to be look what he says I had to be Melancholy so that I can be in order to be the help that he sent me to be here the profitting knowledge is he needed to be Melancholy as much as it came with some bad stuff it also was what God wanted and I want to be that kind of person he says I want to be a Melancholy and you should want to be what you are cuz that's what God made you and and you need to trust him that he's made you that way for purpose if that's the way I was supposed to be that's what I want to be whatever is the kingdom of God's will or God's will that's what I want to be so be what you are but acknowledge your weaknesses and commit it to God and move on and let him heal those things in his time sorry it's a bit small but I believe we'll still be out of follow now let's get back to this love element remember we've dealt with what is needed to heal the sick uh and the church the sick church and to what is the biggest problem it's it's the lack of Brotherly kindness and love but look what the prophet says and I just want to reaffirm that now as we start closing off amen I'm almost done hanging there amen the Lord the world sorry is dying today for love you know that's how you can sometimes make a difference that's how you can bring people in just by the life you live not what you say we think we must say things to prove who we are your life is saying what needs to be said live a life and if God says open your mouth so be it but this is how amen look what he says here Christians today we've got so finely scholar churches wonderful buildings but we got weak pulpits there's something wrong the congregation don't feel to one another like they used to there's something missing the world is looking to that Christians and I'm saying that to the youth they're looking to you what we need today is a baptism of love for one another this will all men know that you're my disciples why when you have love one for the other and no man has greater love than he will lay down his life for his friends yeah ye him and he was the only one that could do it there was not an angel could do it there was not nothing else could do it and he did it you've got no right to listen to nothing else contrary but to him hear ye him Bible said you the salt of the earth the salt is Savor if it contacts but if it's lost his strength no matter how much it contacts that's where the church is that's a condemnation to us cuz we've allowed so many things in between us so many hard feelings that that's what's the matter they have lost their brotherly love and sisterly love they've lost the feeling for one another the world the peoples are looking for something that's real that's when they'll know you disciples when they can see the brotherly kindness and love amongst each other I mean some people have left churches in the message because of so much fractions and disputes and fightings man you know what it doesn't matter how different your brother is and how different his Doctrine is love him as a brother and just say God if he's wrong sort him out but I don't need to treat him different I don't need to say harsh things to him I just need to say I committed to God and love him irrespective why do you have to sort out God's problems listen I think his brother um uh Marcus Becka says something so good and The Pianist will know exactly what I'm saying but the Marcus Baker says it's easy to play the Pian says all you need to do is to know what chts to play at what time and at what tempo and then it's easy to play but unless you know those things it's not easy am I missing another step love I think that's right yeah he says it's to that effect so what we have we see that you know we see the scriptures you must correct your brother and whatever else and for some reason we feel the need to just always be the one that corrects you shouldn't do that sister you are a place brother but God has also said that we need need to be led of the Holy Spirit and that you need to when you see a a wrong in a brother first pray for that brother or sister because who is the ultimate shooter it's Christ himself there's far better effect if that person can hear directly from Christ let's just say it's the church service and you know the the pastor deals with stuff and then you can stay there and say wow God had deal dealt with that I didn't need to go now there's no more arguments that person knows if they're wrong God told me not my fellow brother and sisters so yes you are called to correct and help each other but it must be done in the right spirit because maybe it's not the right season maybe it's not the right time maybe it's not the right atmosphere so you need to pray God I see this do you want me to deal with it or do you want the pastor or someone else but whatever is the is is the the Avenue I must go may I just be in your leading don't be so quick to just want to sort out stuff wait on the Holy Ghost leading amen cuz we need something that's real let me do I want to I want to it wasn't on my notes I wanted to add it but it's come to my mind and I want to say it because I don't think uh I think the Lord just wants me to say this do you know the Bible says we wrestle not against principal um flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers you know that many of you know that scripture so what we need to realize when my brother offends me or my sister offends me it's not actually them we wrestle not against flesh and blood it's not my sister it's not my brother but there's a principality and power that has unfortunately maybe anointed them for that moment and a little bit of a human nature overrode the spirit of God and they said something that they shouldn't have said now let me give you a nice picture if a pedestrian is walking in the road and a car comes and hits them okay and they get they end up in hospital in intensive care whatever it is do we prosecute the car or do we prosecute the driver for the Markel know okay it's the driver but what did the actual damage to the human being was the car you get it so you see the person that hurt you but actually behind that there was something that was driving them and it's very hard to see because what hurt me was the person but there actually was a driver behind the wheel that is the perpetrator and if you can just understand that sometime yeah I'm not condoning it I'm not saying they got an excuse they should have been uh you know under the Holy Spirit but we all four and we're going to I've hurt people and you would have hurt people and I've said things I shouldn't have said and I had to make them right but you have to go back to base camp so try and always remember that when something does someone hurtful or when they're lashing out rather try look behind the flesh Veil and realize this is maybe just a hurt person that unfortunately the devil's got her Avenue in and they're lashing out to me in a way that is not fair but nonetheless let me focus on rather praying for them that the Lord will deliver them of the driver he amen so the Holy Ghost can drive them that should be the motive of every Christian and every person in the church is for the unity unify ourselves and stick together I would I mean let's let's have that goal after this Camp we're in this together let's stick together let's unify ourselves whatever the church votes for that's what we should vote for then say for instance want to change something in the church well then if that the trust is want to someone else wants to the deacons they want to change something that comes before the church the church then together if and if our idea here seems to be a little different than what the whole church said let's sacrifice that idea do you know when uh brother brandham they wanted to do the AL when he preaches the seals and they rededicate the building and they've done all the upgrades you know brother Brandon was against that he wanted to send that money to the missionary Fields CU that's where his heart was but the church voted for the upgrades to the building and he was the prophet I mean come on but he submitt committed himself to what the greater need the body wanted so it's not just about what you want not you know I wish the music was different in my church and you know that one forget about it submit yourself and even if it's wrong pray about it but submit yourself and let God do the work if it's necessary or maybe you just need to come and line yourself because that's the only way we can stand United because we have to sacrifice ideas and if this church will go on to the way you going now and be United God will it's unlimited what he'll do if we'll stick together amen it's unlimited what can be accomplished amongst us if you can just stick together we must stick together that's how we want to be uh so complete with one another and then so complete in the hands of God Amen I'm very close to being done hanging there with me though I understand all the mysteries of God see and still though I could do it and have no charity I'm nothing see I haven't got nowhere see sh see the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it now surely after all these years in the field and around the world this is Brother Bram speaking to the the church you know he's been around the world so much he's had so much experience look at it 1963 you know and and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in I ought to know a little bit of how God gets pleased with us entering where we should be and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit come amongst you you know what especi sorry to say but I was there when I was young especially the guys I don't know the sisters maybe different but man that that arrogancy is some as a real problem we think we're so good and so cool and we got it all together you need to submit that little spirit and say Lord help me not to have that Spirit anyways but that's more other things that it manifests itself all through your life don't let malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see don't build up Wars you you be sweet and kind you show that person how it's done by God's grace and you don't have to say it you just do it and you become the testimony remember God loved you when you were in sin don't forget that and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's wrong see just pray for them and love one another above everything love God and one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do man the sky is the limit this is my closing scripture finally be all of One mind having compassion passion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous be not rendering evil for evil or raing oh he said this I'm going to say that no no no not raing for raing but contr wise blessing knowing that ye are there unto call that is your calling amen that ye should inherit a blessing cuz it comes with that amen so these are little tools I want you to to take with you amen if you need to make some things right where you stepped out of line and you you betrayed someone's trust I want you to go sort that out and be humble enough to sort it out and then make yourself an honorable Christian and a safe house and a safe place for someone else that has a need for you and your Natures will complement each other you have to allow for it I have to be careful even my children I have to be careful how I treat them CU I have to watch their natures and if I go to a certain way you can hurt them understand this guys different I'm going to be like yeah let's go hike and you'll be like I don't know I want to stay in bed you know these little things that are going to come and don't not be like ah this guy is's just got no drive just understand and try and be just try and accommodate and that but he does need a bit of that vuma so help him along and maybe you need to relax a bit and not you know shoot ahead you know just try work together amen try understand each other God brother Brandon was very open and honest about it his nature let us be the same by his grace so take these tools amen and use it amen and may the Lord just help us all because this has been a great help in my life amen that I've been able to watch even this Camp I've been watching some people I kind of already know what some of you are just by your natur you didn't know hey don't worry not everyone some of you have missed but nonetheless because we just have little natures and it's fine there's nothing wrong like brother BR said God made me this way and it's a blessing so channel the good stuff and be a blessing one to another amen God bless you let's just bow amen let's just bow in our heads in a word of prayer amen and maybe we have an opportunity if some of the s points of hit where you know you just need a bit of helping with the Lord and you know maybe there's some things was coming up that your nature you realize needs a touch of the Master's Hand like the prophet said don't don't just keep moving around it just commit it to God and say Lord you deliver me and help me of this and then move on and and let the Holy Spirit Undertake and let his faith your faith just sort out the situation so we're going to pray together if you want to just mention some things to the Lord that you say Lord help me with these things I realize this is a problem and uh may you forgive me where I've betrayed others trust you forgive me when I've said things I shouldn't have said and Lord may we just be able to be of such benefit to each other in brotherly love and kindness amen let's pray together dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord Lord yes we know Lord maybe this is a bit more of a practical service Lord but we know the devil gets inside of these things Lord and He causes division amongst each other little feelings rise up Lord things are said that shouldn't be said Lord and unfortunately the our words are so much power Lord and when we say things negative Lord it just it just it we know the devil just jumps on that and he just makes it so much bigger and stronger Lord but Lord how do we defeat these things we speak love we show love and then those walls of Jericho around us can come tumbling down lord lord God may you make each and every young person here a real safe house for another person Lord a friend Lord May that someone else really feel they can open up Lord and it's not going to be spoken about it will just stay there Lord may you just give us that Spirit Lord of really being a trustworthy honorable Christian Lord Lord we know Lord that there's such power laying before us Lord we as the Brethren can go and accomplish so much but Lord we need to also acknowledge where we we have our little weaknesses our little slip-ups Lord and be able to admit it and say Lord need your help and then Lord help us not to be slack anded when we do have our weaknesses that get in our way let us Lord rise up again and take the good stuff you've given us the positive things Lord and then move forward and be of benefit to one another help us to be giving Christians Lord whenever we see an opportunity just to reach out let us reach out Lord whereever we see someone's down let us reach down our hand and lift them up Lord let us Lord be one anothers Lord let's not be like Adam and uh Abel and Cain Lord that he says oh I'm I my brothers keeper yes we are each other's keeper Lord may we be each other's keeper protector

traditionally how he heard things presented in this message and and maybe maybe some of you sit here and think m is this really message well it is absolutely it is absolutely and like her brother said in the beginning you know we we our main focus is the soul absolutely but we are in a in a three roomed house we live in a house with flesh and a spirit and a soul and yes the soul is the part that is the Eternal part and the soul is the part where the character is built and so on we understand those things that's the Eternal part but God has also given us a solution for Body Spirit and soul amen like a brother said we we happy to pray for someone who battles with cancer or some ailment in the body but why not also give some attention to to the the spirit you know it's it's like we can deny that those things exist but it still affects us so so I mean it's like it's like someone saying I don't believe in gravity right so I'm going to just not believe in gravity and step with the stage but whether I believe in it or not I'm going to Splat on the on the bottom right and that is what how many people around this message has gone for so many years is like no we're in the message those things don't affect us we don't believe no actually and even brother Bram uses some terms and things and and and you know he speaks about how yes it is actually psychology but Godly psychology and and there's always a balance for these things I understand remember the first thing is our soul absolutely but I believe we received such beautiful tools this weekend to also live happier Freer lives as Christians and also what happens many times is you know God can change that like brother tazwell showed so beautifully on on Saturday morning when that serpent nature is first in the soul and then the rebirth then that that that serpent nature gets cast out and the dove nature comes in but sometimes the dove nature can be in our soul but our Spirits are so clouded over with all our complexes and our hurts and our memories and our things that the the life that's in our soul doesn't shine out all the way and dealing with these things that's in our spirit realm I mean dealing with all these emotional things and so forth actually opens the channel so that that light of the holy spirit in our hearts can shine through thank you Michael God bless you richly I mean we just really enjoyed having you yes give him a round of applause we're not lifting our brother up but we're saying thank you to the holy spirit for using that gift and we say thank you for brother Michael to making for
