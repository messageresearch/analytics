[9:36] in me. Amen. God bless you all. It's
[9:38] good to be here this morning. It's nice
[9:40] to see all the additional faces that we
[9:43] don't see on a on a weekly
[9:45] basis. Amen. I trust this is going to be
[9:48] a a blessed time today. A man, we've got
[9:51] we've got all day. It is uh it's a
[9:54] public holiday tomorrow, so
[9:56] relax. And uh you know, and it's it's
[9:59] good. We um for for I'm sure all of you
[10:02] know already. So um you know we have we
[10:06] have our musicians here this morning and
[10:08] Alre is going to preach to us and
[10:10] tonight we have Kas musicians and
[10:13] brother Ben preaching to us but um you
[10:16] know it's not a it's not a competition
[10:18] it's not seeing who can do it better who
[10:21] can preach better song lead better play
[10:23] better. I mean we want to come and put
[10:26] all of that aside and not accept that
[10:29] from from the devil. Amen. Because if we
[10:32] start comparing, start competing, we
[10:34] we've missed it. I mean, we we're
[10:36] breaking down unity. So, you know what I
[10:39] would say, you know, we all struggle
[10:42] with criticism now and then. I'm going
[10:44] to sing some songs wrong that you're
[10:46] like, that's not the way it should go.
[10:47] And I'll say, well, it is the way it go.
[10:49] You're singing it wrong, right? And we
[10:50] can go back and forth. But when we can
[10:52] come behind and say, look, I'm going to
[10:54] support this brother. I'm going to
[10:55] support the musician. I know what it's
[10:57] like to play piano, so I'm going to
[10:59] support her. I know what it's like to
[11:00] play guitar. I'm going to support that
[11:02] person. And we do it vice versa. And
[11:05] then we can we can live in unity. And
[11:08] you know, all that matters is the word.
[11:10] And Christ in us, Christ in me, Christ
[11:12] in you. Amen. We're all here as uh John
[11:16] 1. Oh, yeah. John 1 says, I mean, the
[11:19] word made flesh today. That's each one
[11:21] of us. Amen. Amen. God bless you all.
[11:25] It's good to be here. Let's sing. Let's
[11:27] start to sing before we um actually
[11:30] let's let's commit this this meeting
[11:32] into the Lord's hands. Where's brother
[11:34] is brother Moses
[11:35] here? Is brother Moses? Would you do you
[11:38] mind if you could come and and just
[11:39] commit this this meeting into the Lord's
[11:41] hands for us, brother? And um while you
[11:43] do that, we also have a prayer request
[11:45] if you don't mind praying for the prayer
[11:47] request. Um uh Pillah's sister Naomi um
[11:52] her husband Yan has broken his leg and
[11:55] he's in severe pain and and needs a
[11:57] healing touch. So there a few
[11:58] complications there, but I mean the Lord
[12:01] can can reach out. Amen.
[12:13] [Music]
[12:17] God bless you all. Praise the Lord.
[12:20] Shall we bow our heads for
[12:21] prayer? Our dear heavenly father, just
[12:25] want to thank you this morning for
[12:28] bringing us into your
[12:29] presence. Father, we
[12:32] pray forgive us father of all our wrongs
[12:35] and our trespasses.
[12:37] Lord, we remember the prophet father he
[12:40] was praying.
[12:42] says, "Lord, if you want to look for
[12:45] clean
[12:46] hands, where would you find
[12:49] them?" And he goes on to say, "The only
[12:52] clean hands, Father, you can find is
[12:55] those that you have
[12:58] sanctified." Father, here we
[13:00] stand.
[13:02] Sanctified,
[13:05] justified. Heavenly Father, we know we
[13:09] are overcomers.
[13:12] Heavenly Father, as we are coming to
[13:13] realize who we
[13:15] are, we thank you
[13:18] master and we bless your holy name. You
[13:22] have made it possible.
[13:24] Today there was a wedding father in Cana
[13:29] and Jesus was
[13:31] there. Today I say there's a meeting in
[13:35] BS and Jesus is here.
[13:39] Lord God of heaven, we know wherever
[13:42] your presence
[13:43] was, there was
[13:45] healing.
[13:47] Father, may when we leave this place,
[13:50] Father, leave it. Father, different
[13:53] people, the sick being
[13:57] healed, the blind
[14:00] seeing, the

[14:42] yesterday, today, and forever. And we
[14:44] thank you for your presence, which is
[14:46] right
[14:47] here. Father, to doubt your presence is
[14:51] sin because he said wherever two or
[14:54] three of you are gathered in my name,
[14:56] I'll be there. We thank you, master. May
[14:59] you bless the song leader. May bless

[47:18] Oh
[47:22] Lord. Hallelujah.
[47:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust that
[47:27] comes from from our hearts this morning.
[47:30] It's just a really special day, really
[47:32] special special time.
[47:35] Um, I
[47:38] remember in that time uh 12 years ago
[47:40] when I became pastor, brother Greg
[47:42] passed me a book called Who Moved My
[47:44] Cheese? And the moral of the story was
[47:47] these mice, their lives were upset every
[47:50] time someone made a little change in
[47:52] their lives. So sometimes we as human
[47:53] beings don't like change, but let's
[47:56] embrace the change
[47:57] today. It's a little out of our usual
[47:59] comfort zone, I guess. and and uh we
[48:02] just um we just want to come to praise
[48:04] the Lord. We just want to come to uh
[48:06] just have a a time of fellowship and um
[48:10] from brother Ben and myself. I would
[48:12] like to welcome each and everyone this
[48:14] morning and trust that you didn't have
[48:16] to get up too early but we kind of well
[48:19] some people scored. I guess we can say
[48:21] it that way that don't live too far
[48:23] away, but um trust that we that we all
[48:26] come for the right reason and that we'll
[48:27] just spend some time to uh to fellowship
[48:30] and so on. I also want to want to say
[48:32] thank you for for the sacrifices. Thank
[48:35] you for putting in the time and the
[48:36] effort to come this morning. May God
[48:38] bless you for that. I also want to say a
[48:41] special thank you to Brother Dean,
[48:43] Brother Moses, Brother John for um
[48:46] closing your churches and and joining us
[48:48] today. just uh just trust that it will
[48:51] be worth it for us today. Amen. Also,
[48:54] just a very brief thank you for so many
[48:56] that's uh done tireless work before the
[48:59] beforehand and I know yesterday there
[49:01] were um Joseph and Mana were here from
[49:03] fairly early till very late last night
[49:05] and Matt and Steven and different ones.
[49:08] So on so many different fronts there was
[49:10] a lot that happened. Brother Kovalin was
[49:12] here and different ones. So my God bless
[49:15] you for that.
[49:17] Let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew
[49:19] chapter
[49:20] 24. Thank you musicians. God bless you
[49:23] and thank you for those song
[49:33] items. There's something else that I
[49:36] forgot to do and that is um where's
[49:39] Joshua
[49:42] Nadia? There he is. I think we need to
[49:45] sing happy birthday to him. By the way,
[49:47] is there anyone else whose birthday it
[49:48] is today?
[49:52] Who?
[49:56] There we
[49:57] go. What's your name?
[50:01] Raha. Okay. Well, let's sing for the two
[50:04] of them together. So, we'll just say
[50:05] happy birthday, dear brother. It applies
[50:07] to both. Okay. Happy birthday to you.
[50:13] Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday,
[50:18] dear
[50:20] brother. Happy birthday to you. Praise
[50:25] the Lord. I mean, we're all family. We
[50:28] can just be ourselves this morning. So,
[50:30] let's turn in in our Bibles to Matthew
[50:33] 24 and we're going to start from verse
[50:39] 22. Is a clicker of mine. Praise the
[50:45] Lord. So Jesus speaking here, "And
[50:47] except those days should be shortened,
[50:49] there should no flesh be saved. But for
[50:52] the elect's sake, those days shall be
[50:53] shortened." We're living in those days.
[50:56] Then if any man shall say unto you, "Lo,
[50:58] here is Christ or there believe it not."
[51:01] For they shall rise false Christs and
[51:03] false prophets, and shall show great
[51:05] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[51:07] were possible, they shall deceive the
[51:09] very elect. Behold, I have told you
[51:12] before. Wherefore, if they shall say
[51:14] unto you, Behold, he is in the desert,
[51:16] go not forth. Behold, he is in the
[51:18] secret chambers, believe it not. For as
[51:20] the lightning cometh out of the east,
[51:22] and shineth even unto the west, so shall
[51:24] also the coming of the son of man
[51:27] be. Amen. Let's just
[51:31] pray. Blessed father, we are so
[51:34] thankful, privileged, Lord, for this
[51:36] opportunity to come and fellowship
[51:38] around your word this morning. Amen.
[51:40] Father, and we just welcome you. Oh
[51:43] Lord, I pray for grace, Lord, to step
[51:46] out of the way. Father, so that your
[51:48] Holy Spirit can anoint and use the gift
[51:51] in my life. Father, I pray for my
[51:54] brothers and sisters, each one maybe
[51:56] some streaming different situations,
[51:58] Father. Lord, I pray that each one of
[52:00] us, Lord, will step beside ourselves,
[52:03] Father. that every channel will be open,
[52:05] Father, so that you can speak, Lord, so
[52:07] that you can feed our souls this
[52:09] morning. Father, we just surrender. I
[52:12] pray, Father, that there will be nothing
[52:13] to hinder or distract. Father, I pray
[52:16] that Lord, every complex, every fear,
[52:19] everything, Lord, that's even now
[52:21] possibly trying to work and get in
[52:23] between, Father, will be out of the way,
[52:25] Lord, so that we can receive from you
[52:26] this morning. Father, we just commit the
[52:29] service to you. We ask it in the
[52:31] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:33] Amen. Amen. You may be
[52:54] seated. Praise the Lord. So before I
[52:58] start, I just want to say, you know, we
[52:59] we're a different we we're a different
[53:01] group than we usually are and we come
[53:04] from a few different assemblies. Also
[53:06] hate the fact that I'm so far away from
[53:08] you. I like to be able to be close and
[53:11] uh and not not so far. And so this is in
[53:15] itself a little um awkward. I guess the
[53:18] other thing is and I'll just as I say be
[53:21] myself. This pullpit's angle is so high
[53:23] that my tablet is sliding off all the
[53:25] time. So hopefully I don't drop it. So
[53:27] praise the Lord that that trust that the
[53:29] Lord will help. Um but I I want to say
[53:32] this that um you know we we all come
[53:35] from different backgrounds, different
[53:36] makeups, different mindsets, different
[53:38] things. And um you know, we all look at
[53:42] the word slightly
[53:43] different. Um and and I want to say this
[53:46] morning, you know, maybe I'll say
[53:48] things using different terminology or
[53:50] coming from a different perspective than
[53:52] than what you say. And and all I'll say
[53:55] is like the prophet says, you know, if
[53:57] you're eating chicken, if you hit a
[53:59] bone, well, spit the bone out and keep
[54:01] on eating chicken. Don't throw the whole
[54:03] chicken away. But I'll also say, as the
[54:05] prophet says, make sure it's a bone,
[54:07] though. Amen. So, we just we just want
[54:10] to be ourselves and we just want to have
[54:12] the Lord um have his his way with us
[54:14] this morning. Amen. Um so, the Lord has
[54:17] really pressed on my heart over the last
[54:19] two or three days to uh to share this
[54:21] thought and it's it's a simple thought.
[54:23] I'll pre-warn you with that. But um we
[54:26] are simple people and and brother
[54:29] Brandham quoted so many times how you
[54:31] know how God said in his word it was
[54:33] hidden from the wise and prudent but
[54:35] revealed to babes. And I'm so thankful
[54:37] that the Lord has revealed the things to
[54:39] us and the revelation makes it so
[54:41] simple. Amen.
[54:44] So I'll pick this up by speaking about
[54:47] how God spoke through prophets over the
[54:49] years and God inspired them to write
[54:53] scriptures and God captured his word.
[54:56] But his word really is his eternal
[54:58] thoughts that was expressed in word form
[55:00] or in logos form. And as God spoke more
[55:04] and as God revealed more, what God was
[55:07] doing is he was showing a little more of
[55:10] his redemption plan. And as the years
[55:13] and the ages rolled on, God revealed a
[55:15] little more and a little more and a
[55:17] little more. And and it's just beautiful
[55:20] how, you know, God in everything he
[55:23] does, he reveals who he is, he expresses
[55:27] some of his attributes. I always love to
[55:30] think about the thought that, you know,
[55:32] when we speak about God and our
[55:33] relationship to God as husband and
[55:35] wife and we see so many beautiful types
[55:38] and we so see, you know, so much about
[55:41] God and about his character and, you
[55:43] know, how he relates to us and so on.
[55:45] But then we we flip that around and we
[55:47] see how we are the child and he's the
[55:49] father and it's the same relationship
[55:52] and it's the same thing. But what God
[55:53] does is he uses all these things to let
[55:56] us show a little more of himself. So
[55:58] when we relate to him as our our abba
[56:00] our heavenly father then then we relate
[56:02] to him maybe in slightly different ways
[56:04] than what we would relate as as wife to
[56:06] husband and different things. So in
[56:08] everything that God does as God created
[56:10] as God spoke as God you know prepared
[56:13] the the earth and all those things God
[56:16] reflected his attributes and showed us
[56:19] really who he is and of course in our
[56:21] day who we are.
[56:24] So even little things like God created
[56:27] the earth in six
[56:29] days and on the seventh day he
[56:32] rested and even in those things God gave
[56:35] us clues about his redemption plan and
[56:37] about his plans for the future. Yeah.
[56:40] And and when mankind fell in Eden, God
[56:44] God had had made this statement. God had
[56:47] given the commandment if you eat of this
[56:48] tree that day you eat thereof. That day
[56:51] you will die. So when mankind fell, God
[56:54] had to keep his promise. God had to hold
[56:57] what he promised. And he's promised that
[56:59] day he will die. So from that time
[57:01] onwards, no man lived through his
[57:04] thousand years because remember a
[57:06] thousand years is a day with God. And
[57:08] even Methuselah, the man that lived
[57:10] longest on record, never got quite to
[57:14] that thousand years time. Amen. But so
[57:17] now if we look at the creation week,
[57:19] creation week in itself also shows the
[57:22] week of time I will call it or or
[57:24] whatever you want to call it. But it's
[57:26] so beautiful to see how 2,000 years or
[57:29] two days it was the flood. Another two
[57:32] days the cross, another two days, that's
[57:34] where we're at. And we're at the point
[57:36] where the earth would be burnt by fire
[57:38] and cleaned off by fire. And then after
[57:40] that, we're going to the seventh day
[57:42] where God rests again. And this time he
[57:45] will rest with his
[57:47] bride. And what's so beautiful even in
[57:49] those things even though it's so so
[57:51] simple God showed us in our day so that
[57:53] we can have the perspective that it was
[57:55] actually the redemption of the earth
[57:57] that was happening because after two two
[58:00] days the earth was justified. After
[58:04] another two days the earth was
[58:06] sanctified. And then this is the time
[58:09] when the the the falling of the Holy
[58:11] Ghost is coming on the earth where the
[58:12] earth is cleansed by fire. Amen. And
[58:15] then back into eternity with God again.
[58:18] So when the fall happened in Eden, God
[58:20] promised already in that time the seed
[58:22] of the woman would come.
[58:25] and and then for years and years and
[58:27] years I I always my human mind can't
[58:30] quite fathom that because you know we
[58:32] read in the Bible of of all those
[58:34] stories in the Old Testament and how
[58:36] those people just lived and you know you
[58:38] read about Abraham he was just you know
[58:40] probably working for his father who made
[58:42] idols and you know he was just going
[58:44] about his business and God came on the
[58:46] scene and God called him and and and we
[58:48] read about the Davids and we read about
[58:50] the Josephs and we read about all those
[58:51] different ones but in each one of those
[58:53] lives lives. God was writing a story.
[58:56] God was showing a little bit about
[58:58] himself. God was pointing forward to to
[59:01] the reality of the type. Amen. The
[59:03] antitype of the type that would come. So
[59:05] through the lives of those people,
[59:07] through the feasts, through the things
[59:09] that God showed about himself in the Old
[59:12] Testament, through the sacrifices,
[59:13] through the laws, through all those
[59:15] things. Amen. God was pointing forward
[59:18] to an answer to that that would come.
[59:20] the Messiah, the full word, the
[59:21] expression of the word, the word in
[59:23] flesh that would come. And then when
[59:26] Jesus came, he was the fulfillment of
[59:28] those things. He was he was the answer
[59:30] to all those prophecies. He was the
[59:32] answer to the feast. He was the answer
[59:34] to, you know, all those different types
[59:35] and shadows in the Old Testament. And we
[59:37] can say he was the bridegroom coming of
[59:40] the son of man or the first coming of
[59:42] Christ.
[59:44] And and he like I said, he was the
[59:46] fulfillment of so many scriptures. And
[59:49] he was the flesh expression of the
[59:51] thoughts that were in God who became
[59:53] word who became flesh. Amen. So you know
[59:58] the Bible records even you know where he
[1:00:00] would be born in Bethlehem and and those
[1:00:03] things but it was done in a mystery
[1:00:04] form. Amen. And and the Bible records
[1:00:07] how you know out of Egypt I will call my
[1:00:10] son. And even there the the people never
[1:00:12] put two and two together I believe. And
[1:00:14] but when you know when when all those
[1:00:16] little babies were killed and and and
[1:00:18] Joseph and Mary was told by an angel to
[1:00:20] go take him away and he went to Egypt
[1:00:22] and all those things. All those things
[1:00:23] were recorded so beautifully and Isaiah
[1:00:26] prophesied about him and and you know so
[1:00:28] many prophecies in the Old Testament.
[1:00:30] But when he came
[1:00:33] they missed
[1:00:34] him. when he came perfectly in line with
[1:00:38] the mind of God, with every prophecy,
[1:00:41] with every type, with every offering,
[1:00:42] with all those sacrifices, all those
[1:00:44] things, he came perfectly in line, but
[1:00:46] they missed him. And very simply, they
[1:00:50] missed him. They even called him Bezub
[1:00:53] because they had a preconceived idea of
[1:00:56] what it would be like.
[1:00:58] Amen. They crucified the very one that
[1:01:01] came for their redemption. the very
[1:01:04] redemption plan that he was playing out
[1:01:06] over the over the ages. Amen. For their
[1:01:10] deliverance, those very ones, they
[1:01:12] crucified
[1:01:14] him.
[1:01:15] Hallelujah. They missed him
[1:01:18] completely. So
[1:01:20] sad. And after Jesus's ascension, he
[1:01:23] took John to the aisle of Patmas and he
[1:01:26] dictated to him the road map for the
[1:01:28] future.
[1:01:30] And what he was doing is he was laying
[1:01:32] out the road map. I'll call it a road
[1:01:35] map for the new testament or the new
[1:01:38] covenant covenant the new agreement.
[1:01:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:50] So it shows us how in the New Testament.
[1:01:52] So so what is so beautiful God recorded
[1:01:55] in the book of revelation he wrote those
[1:01:58] letters to the seven churches and in
[1:02:00] those letters to the seven churches he
[1:02:02] showed how those church ages would play
[1:02:04] out over the next 2,000 years.
[1:02:06] But the situation is if you asked for
[1:02:09] someone in Ephesus, you know, do you
[1:02:11] know you're in the Ephesian church age?
[1:02:13] They would have said no clue, no idea.
[1:02:16] They had no idea where they were.
[1:02:18] Smyrna, Pergamos, all the way. Amen.
[1:02:20] They had no idea where they were at. But
[1:02:22] yet God prophesied it perfectly. God
[1:02:25] described to a tea the nature of the
[1:02:27] age, the things that would happen in the
[1:02:29] age. All those typologies and stuff that
[1:02:31] we can only in this day look back and
[1:02:33] see, yes, that's where how it worked.
[1:02:35] And you know, this is the age where it
[1:02:37] fell and this is the age where Satan
[1:02:38] seed moved. And you know, all those
[1:02:40] different things played out. We are so
[1:02:42] privileged, brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:02:44] Yeah. And so throughout the New
[1:02:46] Testament, all those things that God
[1:02:49] prophesied beforehand played out. But
[1:02:52] God didn't just stop there. He didn't
[1:02:54] just show seven church ages. God also
[1:02:56] then went to another level and he showed
[1:02:58] the the anointings. Amen. God showed how
[1:03:02] what the what the attributes would be
[1:03:05] behind this and the the spirit would be
[1:03:07] behind those different church ages. God
[1:03:09] showed who the the messengers to those
[1:03:11] church ages would be. all those
[1:03:13] different things. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[1:03:17] showed us so beautifully. I I just read
[1:03:19] the other day and I shared the quote in
[1:03:21] church how brother Rams you know he says
[1:03:23] we need the church ages as a foundation
[1:03:26] but the church ages just gives us the
[1:03:28] history of the church. He says but then
[1:03:30] the seals come come on top of that and
[1:03:32] it shows us the spirit behind it and it
[1:03:34] it shows us really the battle plan.
[1:03:35] shows us, you know, what happens happens
[1:03:38] behind the scenes be the spirit that
[1:03:40] that that work behind those things.
[1:03:42] Praise the Lord. And then, Brother Ram
[1:03:44] says it goes from there to the trumpets
[1:03:46] and the vials and different things. And
[1:03:47] what it continually doing is it's just
[1:03:49] showing more of God and more of God and
[1:03:51] more of God.
[1:03:54] But now remember, I spoke about the Old
[1:03:55] Testament. All those things built up to
[1:03:58] Jesus. Yeah. But in the New Testament,
[1:04:01] God is leaving a whole lot of clues
[1:04:03] because God is building up to something
[1:04:05] again.
[1:04:06] Hallelujah.
[1:04:08] We can also look at it in this
[1:04:10] way. The stature of a perfect man. And I
[1:04:13] and I trust, you know, that we're all on
[1:04:16] the same page with these things. You
[1:04:17] know, some people might draw it slightly
[1:04:20] differently and so forth. And and I'm
[1:04:22] I'm going to share things and I and I
[1:04:23] started off with that. I'm going to
[1:04:25] share things today that you know maybe
[1:04:26] some of you see slightly differently but
[1:04:30] but don't don't take it as yay and amen.
[1:04:33] Take it before the Lord if if there's
[1:04:35] differences and so
[1:04:37] forth.
[1:04:39] So let's just let's just go back to that
[1:04:42] timeline again. I mentioned that. I'm
[1:04:43] just going to graphically show
[1:04:46] it how the spirit behind those different
[1:04:49] ages. Amen. So Satan's attack, Satan's
[1:04:54] main focus in those different ages, how
[1:04:57] in those early ages, he came in as that
[1:04:59] antichrist spirit, that deceptive
[1:05:02] spirit, the spirit that looks good but
[1:05:04] twists the word and so forth. That's how
[1:05:06] Satan always start. And then how over
[1:05:09] time he he that that same riot got on
[1:05:12] the red horse which now created war and
[1:05:15] he was you know caused fighting and all
[1:05:17] those kind of things. And then after a
[1:05:18] while under the under the next ages then
[1:05:21] he he changed the horse colors again.
[1:05:24] And then he was on this this this black
[1:05:26] horse which was what? Control. Amen. And
[1:05:29] that's how Satan always does. He does it
[1:05:30] in families. He does it in individuals.
[1:05:32] He did it through the ages.
[1:05:34] Deception, fighting, control. And what
[1:05:37] he aims for eventually is that pale
[1:05:39] horse of death which brother Ram shows
[1:05:40] us is a mixture of all those other
[1:05:42] horses
[1:05:44] together. But praise the Lord the story
[1:05:47] doesn't stop there before because
[1:05:50] brother Ram quotes the scripture. I
[1:05:51] think it's in Isaiah so many times when
[1:05:53] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:05:55] spirit of God raises up a standard
[1:05:57] against it. So when that those horse
[1:05:59] riders were riding, before the horse
[1:06:01] riders came there, before that white
[1:06:02] horse rider got there, there was already
[1:06:05] a lion. Hallelujah. God had already
[1:06:08] given a lion anointing, a lion power on
[1:06:11] the church of those early ages.
[1:06:13] Hallelujah. So that so that that lion
[1:06:15] could withstand everything. That lion
[1:06:17] had everything it needed. The church
[1:06:19] under that power, under that anointing
[1:06:21] of the lion had everything that they
[1:06:23] needed to overcome anything the
[1:06:25] deception of the white horse could throw
[1:06:27] at them. And the same thing when when
[1:06:30] the when the enemy changed horses and he
[1:06:31] became that red horse and he started
[1:06:33] fighting. Amen. Never fight a red horse
[1:06:36] with a red horse. Amen. God's response
[1:06:39] was not to fight back. God's response
[1:06:41] was a a ox sacrificial animal. Amen. A
[1:06:45] burdenbearer. Amen. That's God's
[1:06:48] response to that that red horse, that
[1:06:50] attack. And then when when when Satan
[1:06:53] changed horses and he tried to control
[1:06:55] again and control doctrine and control
[1:06:57] dogma and all those things, God raised
[1:06:58] up a man's spirit against it. And in our
[1:07:02] day when all those things come together,
[1:07:04] God raised up that that eagle anointing
[1:07:06] and we believe we're under that eagle
[1:07:08] anointing. Again, brothers and sisters,
[1:07:09] I come back to this point over and over
[1:07:11] and over and that's really going to be
[1:07:12] my theme this morning. We are so
[1:07:14] privileged because we're not living in
[1:07:17] darkness anymore. We're not living in a
[1:07:19] time when the church is just going
[1:07:20] through the motions, but you know, we we
[1:07:22] we don't have perspective. We've got
[1:07:24] perspective. Remember what I said at the
[1:07:26] start. God showed us a map.
[1:07:29] Amen. God showed us a map of where the
[1:07:32] church was going to go in the New
[1:07:33] Testament. Hallelujah. Today, we can
[1:07:36] look back and we can see this is how the
[1:07:38] map mapped out over time. Or if we look
[1:07:41] at it from the pyramid perspective, this
[1:07:42] is how that that panned out. Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] But there's so many more things
[1:07:48] throughout the Bible, and we can spend
[1:07:50] probably days on these things, but I'm
[1:07:51] just going to refer to one or two. You
[1:07:53] read in the Old Testament of Joel,
[1:07:55] how it says that tree was going to be
[1:07:57] eaten down and was going to be restored.
[1:08:00] Hallelujah. Even in the Old Testament,
[1:08:03] years and years and years before even
[1:08:04] Jesus was on the scene, God already
[1:08:06] prophesied through Joel how that that
[1:08:09] brighter, how that that seed would have
[1:08:10] to die and go into the ground first and
[1:08:12] then through through several stages be
[1:08:14] restored back again. Hallelujah. God, do
[1:08:18] you know God actually through Joel
[1:08:20] prophesied the reformation process.
[1:08:23] Amen. When Joel said thus they thought I
[1:08:26] will restore God's thinking included
[1:08:30] Martin Luther John Wesley brother
[1:08:32] Brandham
[1:08:33] amen because that's the process by we by
[1:08:36] which he was going to restore the bride
[1:08:39] God had put those clues throughout the
[1:08:41] Bible but for years and centuries
[1:08:43] brothers and sisters people had no idea
[1:08:45] what was happening they were just going
[1:08:47] through the motions they were just you
[1:08:48] know in the time when you know when when
[1:08:50] that red horse was going they were just
[1:08:52] you know going and and being killed at
[1:08:54] the stake and burnt and fed to lions and
[1:08:56] all sorts of things. They didn't know in
[1:08:59] perspective what we have today why they
[1:09:01] were going through those things. Can you
[1:09:03] imagine a thousand
[1:09:05] years, generation after generation after
[1:09:08] generation after generation just
[1:09:10] completely hunted and and and and pushed
[1:09:13] out from society and disrespected and
[1:09:16] disowned. And yet the wonderful thing is
[1:09:19] there was a group that was anointed by
[1:09:21] that ox anointing and God kept them. And
[1:09:24] the more pressure the the the the
[1:09:26] Catholic Church put on them, hallelujah,
[1:09:28] the more God kept them through those
[1:09:30] things. And and I want to say, brothers
[1:09:32] and sisters, it couldn't have been easy
[1:09:34] for them to go through all those trials.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. But God gave them the
[1:09:39] anointing to cope with it. God gave them
[1:09:42] the peace in the middle of that storm.
[1:09:43] It wasn't that it wasn't a storm. It
[1:09:45] absolutely was a storm but God kept them
[1:09:48] in that storm.
[1:09:51] So now also God I I referred to the
[1:09:55] reformation process and again the
[1:09:57] beautiful thing is the reformation
[1:09:58] process in itself types the rebirth
[1:10:01] again. Amen. Justification under Luther
[1:10:04] that's the first step of the rebirth
[1:10:06] process and then sanctification under
[1:10:09] Wesley and then the the Holy Ghost in in
[1:10:12] this last age. And in the middle you
[1:10:14] have the restoration of the gifts too.
[1:10:17] But the process brothers and sisters is
[1:10:19] showing so beautifully the the the how
[1:10:22] God reforms the church re reestablishes
[1:10:25] the church again. Brings that bride that
[1:10:28] bride tree back to the fullness of the
[1:10:30] life that went into the ground in the
[1:10:31] first place 2,000 years ago.
[1:10:35] And the point I'm making brothers and
[1:10:37] sisters I'm going to bring it back to
[1:10:38] the map now. God is drawing has drawn.
[1:10:42] In fact, the map was drawn in God's mind
[1:10:44] before the foundation of the earth. But
[1:10:46] God gave us clues. God dropped clues
[1:10:48] through the centuries of his map. How
[1:10:52] the bride tree would be restored back
[1:10:55] and so forth.
[1:10:58] So, I just want to hone in on one or two
[1:11:00] things here.
[1:11:04] So in our age, we we are so privileged
[1:11:08] to to have
[1:11:10] experienced prophecy. I I I want to say
[1:11:14] in an unparalleled way prophecy being
[1:11:16] fulfilled. Hallelujah. We've we've you
[1:11:19] know we we can read in the Bible about
[1:11:21] you know uh in Revelation chapter 4 when
[1:11:23] when John hears that voice come up
[1:11:25] higher. Amen. But in our day it's more
[1:11:28] than just okay we read it John heard a
[1:11:31] voice come up higher. You know, in our
[1:11:32] day, brothers and sisters, we
[1:11:33] experienced it. Amen. We see the
[1:11:36] fulfillment of those things. Prophecy is
[1:11:38] now history. As I always say, we don't
[1:11:41] read the book of mystery anymore. We
[1:11:43] read the book of Revelation. God has
[1:11:45] revealed it in our day. Yet, for nearly
[1:11:47] 2,000 years, I mean, people read the
[1:11:49] book of Revelation and and people wrote
[1:11:51] thesis on it and people try to figure it
[1:11:54] out and they misplaced it completely.
[1:11:56] But in our day, God has just opened it
[1:11:58] so much and he's revealed it to us.
[1:12:01] Amen. And I want to say this, God is
[1:12:02] still revealing it to us. And and before
[1:12:06] you get upset with me, I believe God
[1:12:08] revealed these things to the prophet as
[1:12:10] much as he wanted to reveal to the
[1:12:11] prophet. And that's not the point. The
[1:12:14] point is God is still revealing it to
[1:12:16] the individual. There's so many things
[1:12:18] the prophet preached that we're only
[1:12:21] starting to see today.
[1:12:24] Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] So now to come back to that graphic now.
[1:12:29] So, we've got the seven church ages
[1:12:32] there. Then, in our age, the bride is
[1:12:34] called
[1:12:38] up into the bride age. Here's where I
[1:12:42] might get in trouble with some, but I
[1:12:43] trust not. Amen. The bride is called up
[1:12:46] into the bride age.
[1:12:52] So, we refer to what happened over the
[1:12:54] 2,000 years as the church ages.
[1:12:58] But the bride age is not another church
[1:13:00] age.
[1:13:03] Amen. The bride age is not a eighth age.
[1:13:07] It's not a new day. If it was the eighth
[1:13:09] age, well then we need to start looking
[1:13:11] for eighth messenger. But we run out of
[1:13:13] we run out of types in the Bible when we
[1:13:15] start looking for eighth age for eighth
[1:13:18] messenger. Amen. The bride age is a age
[1:13:21] within an age. And we can hear this
[1:13:24] terminology and then we think, oh my
[1:13:25] goodness, age within an age. And it
[1:13:27] becomes a cliche. But the reality is,
[1:13:28] brothers and sisters, it's still
[1:13:30] Lodicia. This building was built by
[1:13:32] Leodosia. Go out the front door, you see
[1:13:35] Ladyia. Amen. You upset someone in the
[1:13:38] street, you experience Lady, right? But
[1:13:41] the bride is called up. Hallelujah.
[1:13:45] Amen. So the bride, we have the
[1:13:47] privilege, brothers and sisters, that in
[1:13:49] our day, we are you. You see, when
[1:13:51] brother Brandham drew out those those
[1:13:53] seven pictures of the church ages, he
[1:13:55] sat with a conundrum. Amen. Because he
[1:13:57] said, "I gave it a little bit of light,
[1:13:59] but when God drew it on the back of the
[1:14:00] of the tabernacle, he drew the seventh
[1:14:03] one completely dark." But you see,
[1:14:05] that's showing what the what the church
[1:14:07] was like. But the bride, she's in go. I
[1:14:11] mean, the bride is not in lotus here.
[1:14:13] The bride, and I'm speaking spiritually
[1:14:15] now. Don't mix the physical and the
[1:14:16] spiritual now. The bride, brothers and
[1:14:18] sisters, was called up into that into
[1:14:20] that bride age and we are walking in the
[1:14:23] light. We are walking in goan.
[1:14:24] Hallelujah. Like brother Ram says so
[1:14:26] many times so beautifully at the top of
[1:14:28] the tree. Hallelujah. He says the fruit
[1:14:30] ripens the quickest at the top of the
[1:14:32] tree. Hallelujah. And we in that time
[1:14:34] when the fruit ripens the quickest as
[1:14:37] we've been called up higher. We're
[1:14:39] living in goan. I trust that you live in
[1:14:41] goan brothers and sisters.
[1:14:44] So again I'm going to take you to the
[1:14:46] pyramid.
[1:14:49] Now, there's some things here that over
[1:14:53] the years and and and I'll just say this
[1:14:55] is how I believe it. If you believe it
[1:14:57] slightly differently, that's between you
[1:15:00] and the
[1:15:01] Lord. But there's a time when the
[1:15:05] anointing goes from man to eagle.
[1:15:10] There's a there's a time we refer to
[1:15:12] that time as the change of
[1:15:13] administration or the change of
[1:15:17] anointing. The power on the bride of the
[1:15:20] age changes.
[1:15:23] And that happened in this age.
[1:15:27] In this age in inside of
[1:15:32] Leodia the anointing on the bride
[1:15:35] changed from man to eagle.
[1:15:40] Now, for years and years and years when
[1:15:43] I drew that picture, I drew the eagle on
[1:15:45] the seventh
[1:15:48] uh in the in
[1:15:51] Lucia. But that's not how I see it
[1:15:56] anymore. There was a transition inside
[1:16:00] Lodia time wise from man to eagle.
[1:16:07] And we want to make a distinction now.
[1:16:10] The church ages we know was under a son
[1:16:14] of God
[1:16:15] anointing. I hope this is not jumping in
[1:16:17] too deep too quickly. The church ages
[1:16:20] was under the son of God
[1:16:22] anointing. But the eagle is
[1:16:25] exclusively for the bride age. Yes.
[1:16:31] Now, now here's where the confusing
[1:16:34] confusion comes in. Lotusa is still
[1:16:37] running physically speaking. So, you
[1:16:39] you're kind of superimposing the
[1:16:41] headstone over Lotusia in a way. I hope
[1:16:44] I'm not bringing confusion. You're
[1:16:46] getting very
[1:16:48] quiet. Hopefully, you're listening.
[1:16:50] Praise the Lord. But brothers and
[1:16:52] sisters, it's so important to
[1:16:54] understand. Amen. that the bride has
[1:16:58] turned the corner. Amen. And and and I
[1:17:01] want to say this, we've experienced a
[1:17:04] prophet who who ministered who had a
[1:17:07] worldwide ministry, but he ministered
[1:17:09] under two anointings,
[1:17:12] there was a part of his of his ministry
[1:17:14] where he still ministered under the man
[1:17:16] anointing,
[1:17:20] right?
[1:17:24] The eagle
[1:17:26] anointing, it's hard to even put it in
[1:17:29] words. The eagle anointing did not fly
[1:17:31] in Lodicia, but it flew in the time of
[1:17:34] Lucia.
[1:17:36] You understand what I'm saying? The
[1:17:38] eagle anointing is associated with a
[1:17:39] capstone only.
[1:17:43] Even though Lucia time wise is still
[1:17:46] going on.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] So the eagle anointing is specifically
[1:17:54] associated with the opening of the book
[1:17:57] with the opening of the word in the
[1:17:59] bride age. And that is when Christ the
[1:18:02] headstone came down to the body crying
[1:18:06] grace grace in the old testament uh
[1:18:10] example. And in the new testament
[1:18:12] example the mighty angel came down. Same
[1:18:15] ex same exact event.
[1:18:18] Amen. The mighty angel coming down, the
[1:18:21] capstone coming down.
[1:18:23] Headstone on the body.
[1:18:26] And we know because of Revelations 10
[1:18:29] that the seventh earthly messenger is on
[1:18:32] earth when that happens.
[1:18:35] Amen.
[1:18:36] So when that capstone comes onto the
[1:18:40] pyramid, the seventh angel is on earth.
[1:18:45] So I'm going to go back to what I said
[1:18:47] earlier.
[1:18:48] When that capstone comes down, the the
[1:18:50] anointing on that seventh messenger
[1:18:53] changes from man to eagle.
[1:19:00] I think you're on board. Praise the
[1:19:01] Lord.
[1:19:03] Now, there's another implication of this
[1:19:05] if I take it a step further.
[1:19:12] The first and second pull of brother
[1:19:14] Brandham's ministry was under a man
[1:19:18] anointing, a church age anointing.
[1:19:22] A son of God anointing. That's
[1:19:26] true.
[1:19:28] So some guys get really excite upset
[1:19:31] when I say this, so I trust you don't.
[1:19:34] But the healing
[1:19:36] services were not an expression of the
[1:19:40] eagle
[1:19:43] anointing. The discernment services were
[1:19:46] not an expression of the eagle
[1:19:49] anointing. Those services was still
[1:19:51] under the man anointing. It was still in
[1:19:53] a church age anointing. That's true.
[1:19:56] Amen.
[1:19:58] only the third pull when the word opened
[1:20:01] when the focus now now again maybe this
[1:20:04] is controversial to some and maybe some
[1:20:06] get religiously upset you if I say this
[1:20:09] but I don't believe brother Banham even
[1:20:12] saw immediately what was going on there
[1:20:14] because you read you know after the
[1:20:16] seals where brother Banham is expecting
[1:20:19] a new way of healing for the third pool
[1:20:22] it's very clear and and he makes
[1:20:25] statements like well maybe it will
[1:20:26] happen this
[1:20:28] and and and and God supernaturally
[1:20:31] changed that ministration. God
[1:20:33] supernaturally anointed his prophet now
[1:20:35] under the eagle anointing. He was
[1:20:37] already work walking in it. He had
[1:20:39] already opened the seals. He was already
[1:20:40] preaching the seventh seal completely
[1:20:42] open. Hallelujah. But the man part of
[1:20:45] him was still expecting because it went
[1:20:47] from from signing the hand to the
[1:20:48] discernment. He was expecting a new wave
[1:20:51] or a new way of healing. Hallelujah. And
[1:20:55] that was again I get myself in trouble
[1:20:58] here but praise the Lord. It's important
[1:21:00] we see these things brothers and
[1:21:01] sisters. I know this is not an
[1:21:02] evangelistic service but I believe it's
[1:21:04] going to help us.
[1:21:06] Now of course what I want to say is it's
[1:21:08] important to understand God has lap over
[1:21:10] times. You know if you look out in
[1:21:13] nature you don't sew a seed in the
[1:21:14] morning and the next day it's not jacked
[1:21:16] in the bean stalk. Amen. It just grows
[1:21:19] organically. and and with God also
[1:21:22] there's lap over times you know it's
[1:21:24] just nothing today and tomorrow
[1:21:25] everything it doesn't work like that
[1:21:27] amen so we understand that but again
[1:21:31] just to be very explicit with these
[1:21:33] things and and don't don't misquote me
[1:21:35] now if we have to put a date there when
[1:21:39] that change of administration happened I
[1:21:41] will say February March
[1:21:43] 1963 now remember I've I've I've
[1:21:46] preempted that by saying it's not just
[1:21:48] boom right there's lap over periods. But
[1:21:52] but in in 1963, God changed the
[1:21:55] anointing on his prophet. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:02] But now there's some interesting
[1:22:03] implications of this. If we look at the
[1:22:05] end of 1962, brother Brandham, you know,
[1:22:07] remember he saw the the the was it the
[1:22:10] dream or vision of the, you know, the
[1:22:12] the constellation of angels and so forth
[1:22:14] and he was really rattled by that and he
[1:22:16] preached, "Is this the time of the end,
[1:22:18] sir?"
[1:22:19] And when brother Brandon was preaching
[1:22:21] that that sermon, now remember 30
[1:22:23] December 1962 before the opening of the
[1:22:26] seals obviously because you know it was
[1:22:28] after that we actually had the
[1:22:29] experience and then he went back to the
[1:22:31] tabernacle and so forth. But brother
[1:22:33] Brandham in that message
[1:22:36] 1962 under the man
[1:22:40] anointing he made these
[1:22:43] statements. So what he does is he lists
[1:22:46] the
[1:22:48] mysteries or the loose ends that were
[1:22:51] restored. Okay, now you know where I'm
[1:22:53] going with this. He says the serpent
[1:22:55] seed that's been a hidden mystery all
[1:22:56] through the years. The grace
[1:22:58] straightened out, not disgrace, but real
[1:23:00] true grace. Not such a thing as a
[1:23:02] eternal burning hell. You'll burn for
[1:23:04] millions of years, but anything that was
[1:23:06] eternal had never had a beginning or an
[1:23:07] end and hell was created. All these
[1:23:10] mysteries and he continues listing more.
[1:23:12] the mystery of the baptis baptism of the
[1:23:14] Holy Ghost without sensation but the
[1:23:16] person of Christ performing in you the
[1:23:18] same works that he did. Then he says the
[1:23:20] mystery of water baptism where the
[1:23:23] extreme trinitarianism has brought it
[1:23:25] into titles of father son and holy ghost
[1:23:27] and the mystery of the godhead being
[1:23:28] fulfilled in the baptism of the name of
[1:23:30] Jesus Christ according to the book of
[1:23:32] revelation that the church in this time
[1:23:34] was to receive. He says there is some of
[1:23:36] the mysteries. Now end of
[1:23:40] 62 those things were clear. They were
[1:23:44] revealed
[1:23:46] under the man
[1:23:49] anointing. Okay. I don't get many amens.
[1:23:53] Do you agree what I'm saying?
[1:23:56] Okay. Praise the Lord. So So now think
[1:23:59] about this. Now it was not under the
[1:24:02] eagle anointing when those loose ends
[1:24:04] from the previous ages were called
[1:24:07] together and where those things were
[1:24:14] revealed. So those things were revealed
[1:24:17] under the first and second pool
[1:24:21] under the man age or church age
[1:24:24] anointing. So let's think about that
[1:24:26] now. the foundational doctrines. Now,
[1:24:29] you know, most of the time if someone
[1:24:30] asks you, well, what is the message?
[1:24:33] Well, I trust you pass the point where
[1:24:34] you say long hair and long dresses. But
[1:24:37] then people say, well, baptism in Jesus'
[1:24:40] name, um, you know, serpent seed and so
[1:24:43] forth. Some of those foundational
[1:24:44] quotes. Okay? Well, I'm going to
[1:24:47] challenge that today.
[1:24:49] Now I want you to
[1:24:52] understand you know I can so easily be
[1:24:55] misunderstood here. Those things are
[1:24:58] important. I am not for one
[1:25:00] moment you know wiping any of that off
[1:25:03] off of the table. Those are still the
[1:25:05] foundational basis of the things we
[1:25:08] believe. But really those are
[1:25:10] foundational things about actually about
[1:25:12] God's word in general about the gospel.
[1:25:15] Right. And and also today because God
[1:25:19] has taken us a step further than you
[1:25:21] know than Pentecost, than Wesley, than
[1:25:23] than than Luther, we don't wipe those
[1:25:25] things off. We still believe the just
[1:25:27] shall live by faith. Amen. We still
[1:25:29] believe the blood of Christ sanctifies
[1:25:31] us and he cleans us and we are washed by
[1:25:33] the waters of the word. We still believe
[1:25:35] in all those things. We still believe in
[1:25:36] the gifts in the church. We still
[1:25:38] believe that that, you know, God is the
[1:25:40] same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[1:25:41] don't throw away everything. We believe
[1:25:44] all that plus. Amen.
[1:25:47] So, so you know when when I make these
[1:25:49] statements, please don't think I'm
[1:25:50] saying well we've moved beyond that so
[1:25:52] you know disregard those things. This is
[1:25:53] not what we're saying. Amen.
[1:25:57] So those truths, so so here's a big
[1:26:03] statement, but I believe
[1:26:05] it. Those mysteries that brother
[1:26:08] Brandham listed there were
[1:26:11] restored under a Pentecostal
[1:26:17] age. Okay, I see the wheels turning for
[1:26:20] many. It was under Son of God anointing.
[1:26:24] It was in a church age anointing. It was
[1:26:26] not under the bride age. Amen. So
[1:26:30] therefore, it is part of what happened
[1:26:32] in Pentecost.
[1:26:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:39] Now, I'm either painting myself into a
[1:26:41] corner
[1:26:43] here or there's something we need to
[1:26:45] see.
[1:26:47] So now, Brother Brandham refers to the
[1:26:51] the seed that had to go into the ground
[1:26:52] and grow back into seed again. He says,
[1:26:55] "The first corn of wheat, the
[1:26:56] bridegroom, had to fall into the earth
[1:26:58] in order to rise again. So that the
[1:27:00] first bride that was born at Pentecost
[1:27:02] had to go through that dark ages like
[1:27:05] any other seed, be buried. They had to
[1:27:08] die. They must do it." So now he's just
[1:27:10] speaking about, you know, he's really
[1:27:12] referring to the bride tree that had to,
[1:27:13] you know, die, go into the ground and
[1:27:15] and bring forth. Again, it's the
[1:27:17] parallel thing here. They had to die.
[1:27:19] They must do it. But it started
[1:27:20] sprouting again in Luther in the first
[1:27:22] reformation. It didn't look like the
[1:27:24] seed that went in, but it was the light
[1:27:26] of that day. The stalk then went on into
[1:27:28] the tassel Wesley and from the tassel it
[1:27:30] went into Pentecost, the shaq.
[1:27:36] Okay, don't get offended.
[1:27:38] The prophet calls it the
[1:27:41] shock. What happens to the shock? Gets
[1:27:44] burnt.
[1:27:48] In the rapture message, brother Ber
[1:27:49] makes the statement. He says, "From that
[1:27:51] come on up into the tassel, which was
[1:27:52] John Wesley, the great missionary age.
[1:27:54] It dropped back out of there come that
[1:27:56] deceiving age, the Pentecostal age."
[1:28:01] Okay? So, I trust I'm taking you along
[1:28:04] with me. I trust that your walls are not
[1:28:06] up yet. Amen. Keep on eating chicken.
[1:28:09] Praise the Lord. So, so now, Brother
[1:28:13] Brandham calls it the shock and now he's
[1:28:16] calling it the deceiving age. Now, he's
[1:28:17] not referring to when the when, you
[1:28:19] know, the Holy Ghost was poured out on
[1:28:20] the day of Pentecost 2,000 years ago.
[1:28:22] He's speaking about the Pentecostal age
[1:28:24] or Lodia,
[1:28:26] right? That church
[1:28:27] age. Brother Ram says in another place
[1:28:30] he says, "Then along come the
[1:28:31] Pentecostals in the shock so much to
[1:28:35] deceive the
[1:28:37] elected." Strong statements, man.
[1:28:40] Pentecost to deceive the elected. Looked
[1:28:44] like a real grain of wheat. Open it up.
[1:28:46] There's no wheat at all. Let Let me just
[1:28:49] say it straight out. It looked like the
[1:28:51] word was restored, but it wasn't. It
[1:28:55] wasn't back to the original seed, the
[1:28:57] spoken word. Again, there was a lot of
[1:28:59] noise. There was a lot of
[1:29:00] manifestations. There was a lot of stuff
[1:29:02] that went on. There was also a lot of
[1:29:04] copying. There was also a lot of false.
[1:29:07] I'm not saying everything is false.
[1:29:08] Don't misquote me. Now, but brothers and
[1:29:11] sisters, Pentecost and the Pentecostal
[1:29:14] experience, brother Benam, actually,
[1:29:16] when I say the Pentecostal experience,
[1:29:18] I'm not speaking about the true original
[1:29:19] one. Amen. But I'm speaking about under
[1:29:22] the the low and Pentecostal expression.
[1:29:25] That's
[1:29:26] deceptive. Look like a real grain of
[1:29:28] wheat. Open it up. There's no wheat at
[1:29:30] all. But the life passing through the
[1:29:32] shock. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:36] So
[1:29:37] listen that deception that deceptive age
[1:29:42] brother Bam he actually he he's he's
[1:29:45] basically saying that that experience
[1:29:49] under loicia would be so close that it
[1:29:52] would deceive the very elected if it was
[1:29:59] possible. I love how he says it here.
[1:30:01] See here now how close she is. Close
[1:30:03] enough to deceive Luther the stalk,
[1:30:06] Wesley the tassel and Mary the shuck or
[1:30:09] the womb or Pentecost. Amen. See how he
[1:30:12] calls causes it now. The shuck the womb
[1:30:17] Pentecost. It's so
[1:30:19] close. Remember the shuck is that little
[1:30:22] womb that the seed is being formed in.
[1:30:25] It's the environment. It's the safety.
[1:30:29] It's the place where the seed must form.
[1:30:32] But if you just look at the womb and
[1:30:34] there's no seed in there, amen mean then
[1:30:37] it's deceptive. Then you think, well,
[1:30:39] maybe maybe there's something. Well,
[1:30:41] maybe it's growing. Brother Ram says you
[1:30:43] can open that chuck up and you can take
[1:30:45] a a microscope. He says, I can't
[1:30:47] remember, you know, 100 times microscope
[1:30:49] or something. And he says you can't see
[1:30:51] any seed in there. Hallelujah. Under
[1:30:55] Pentecost. So, so think about this now.
[1:30:59] bride today
[1:31:03] 2025 Pentecost so close it would deceive
[1:31:08] the very elected if
[1:31:10] possible. Now raise your hands. How many
[1:31:15] of you would be deceived easily by TD
[1:31:20] Jake, Joel
[1:31:22] Ostein, Joseph Prince, Benny Hinn, Joyce
[1:31:25] Meyers,
[1:31:27] Cra anyone.
[1:31:30] Think about this
[1:31:33] now. Pentecost deception
[1:31:38] today. Now, I hope those are not your
[1:31:40] favorite
[1:31:44] preachers. But there's something deeper
[1:31:46] in this than just thinking the
[1:31:49] charismatic movement. Amen. Yes.
[1:31:57] Those things are so obviously
[1:31:59] wrong. You know, if I accidentally sat
[1:32:02] on my remote and I saw a Joyce Meyers,
[1:32:05] you know, thing pop up on on on YouTube
[1:32:08] on my screen at home, it's not going to
[1:32:11] deceive me. Amen. Why? Because there's
[1:32:15] just no life in there. And I say that
[1:32:17] respectfully, brothers and sisters.
[1:32:20] Those things are so obviously wrong to
[1:32:22] the bride standing in the light of the
[1:32:24] word because it's money chasing. It's
[1:32:27] watered down. It is psychology. It is
[1:32:30] signing. It is not even a distraction.
[1:32:33] There's no there's no temptation there.
[1:32:36] There's no deception there.
[1:32:38] Amen. So, this is the part that is
[1:32:41] really sensitive. And I want you to open
[1:32:43] your heart before the Lord this morning.
[1:32:45] Pinch yourself. Brother Ram says, "Put
[1:32:47] your spiritual thinking caps
[1:32:49] on. The deception is closer." Amen.
[1:32:57] And and I and I want to say this
[1:32:58] carefully and with reverence, and don't
[1:33:00] misquote me or quote what I'm not
[1:33:04] saying, but you can believe the first
[1:33:07] and second pull of this
[1:33:10] message and be still under a Pentecostal
[1:33:13] anointing.
[1:33:19] Right? You can. There's where the
[1:33:22] deception comes
[1:33:25] in. Remember I showed you I showed how
[1:33:28] all those things were were already
[1:33:30] revealed under the man anointing. It was
[1:33:32] under Pentecost where all those truths
[1:33:34] were
[1:33:34] restored. It was it was it was under
[1:33:37] Ladyia. It was under the church age
[1:33:39] anointing. It was under the man
[1:33:40] anointing where brother Brandham
[1:33:42] revealed serpent seed. God sent a
[1:33:45] prophet, right? You can believe God sent
[1:33:48] a prophet, brothers and sisters, but re
[1:33:51] uh refuse to go on with the open word,
[1:33:55] refuse to go into the capstone, refuse
[1:33:57] to go under the eagle anointing, refuse
[1:33:59] to go into the bride age, refuse to come
[1:34:01] into go and remain in the darkness.
[1:34:05] I know this is strong words, my friends,
[1:34:07] and I'm not criticizing brother
[1:34:09] Brandham. I'm not nothing, don't get me
[1:34:11] wrong. But we can stay behind
[1:34:14] and be caught in darkness and there's
[1:34:16] the deception. Amen. And you can say God
[1:34:19] sent a prophet and you can quote serpent
[1:34:21] season. You can understand the the the
[1:34:23] baptism in Jesus name and and all those
[1:34:25] things. The the guided in the right way
[1:34:27] and still be deceived.
[1:34:30] Stay behind.
[1:34:33] Hallelujah. The deceiving Pentecostal
[1:34:36] age is a lot closer than I think we
[1:34:38] thought before.
[1:34:40] We can believe Jesus Christ is the same
[1:34:42] yesterday and today and forever. We can
[1:34:44] believe the sign in the hand. We can
[1:34:46] believe the discernment. We can say he
[1:34:47] was a prophet. We can say it was a
[1:34:49] vindicated prophet. We can even quote
[1:34:51] the prophet. Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] Trust us, he's not making you uneasy
[1:34:56] unless the Holy Spirit needs to make you
[1:34:57] uneasy this morning. But that's still
[1:35:00] all under the restoration of the gifts.
[1:35:03] Remember when that angel came to brother
[1:35:05] Brandham the angel did not say you'll
[1:35:07] receive three gifts
[1:35:10] the angel said like Moses you will have
[1:35:12] two signs
[1:35:15] and those two signs is not so that
[1:35:18] everyone can rally around the signs.
[1:35:20] Amen. God did not gave Moses those two
[1:35:22] signs so that you know every time Moses
[1:35:24] go through the camp so that someone can
[1:35:25] say brother Moses I'm having a bad day
[1:35:28] just show me the sign again. Okay Moses
[1:35:29] put his hand in the bosom get the stick.
[1:35:31] Throw the stick. No. Amen. When the sign
[1:35:34] vindicated the word for their day,
[1:35:37] brothers and sisters, they should look
[1:35:38] away from the sign and look at where the
[1:35:40] sign was pointing. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:35:42] Ran preaches the message, the voice of
[1:35:44] the sign. Amen. God showed the sign so
[1:35:48] that we can hear the voice. And what did
[1:35:50] the voice say? Come up higher. Amen. The
[1:35:53] voice said, "Come up higher, my bride.
[1:35:55] Come away from Egypt. Come into Gan.
[1:35:57] Come away from Lotus year. Come into the
[1:35:59] bride age." Amen. Don't stay in the
[1:36:01] first and second pool. Come into the
[1:36:03] third pool. Come into the open word.
[1:36:05] Amen. And we're not we're not rallying
[1:36:08] around the sign the whole time. We're
[1:36:09] not rallying around. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:11] Oh, the healings are amazing. They were
[1:36:13] amazing. Absolutely. I'm not taking away
[1:36:15] from it. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:36:17] Amen. But we're not rallying around
[1:36:18] those things. God has given us those
[1:36:21] things to vindicate. That is where my
[1:36:23] word is flesh today.
[1:36:27] Hallelujah. God vindicated the message
[1:36:30] that would follow and he told us to
[1:36:33] believe the voice of the
[1:36:37] sign. Now I want to take that a step
[1:36:44] further. You can believe serpent
[1:36:47] seed
[1:36:49] grace. No such a thing as eternal hell.
[1:36:53] Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Water
[1:36:55] baptism. You can believe all those
[1:36:58] things, brothers and sisters. You can
[1:37:00] say, "Well, I'm in the
[1:37:03] message." And again, I it's impossible
[1:37:06] to humanly divide this. So, I just trust
[1:37:09] that the Holy Spirit will do that for
[1:37:10] you. But I don't want to say if you say,
[1:37:13] "I'm in the message because I believe
[1:37:14] those
[1:37:15] things." Well, maybe 50 years ago, you
[1:37:18] would have been in the message.
[1:37:21] remember because even though brother
[1:37:23] Brandham preached the the seventh seal
[1:37:25] open and brother Brandham revealed those
[1:37:26] things so beautifully to the individual
[1:37:29] those things were still mysteries and it
[1:37:31] took years and years and years and years
[1:37:33] and years for God to slowly open up more
[1:37:35] and open up more and open up more. Amen.
[1:37:39] And there was a time where God winked at
[1:37:42] the ignorance of those things.
[1:37:44] Hallelujah. There was a time when all
[1:37:46] you needed was God sent a prophet. But
[1:37:48] that time is not today. The message has
[1:37:50] moved on. Amen. The revelation has moved
[1:37:53] on. God has given us more. Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] And and brothers and sisters, I will say
[1:37:58] it's a sin today to to refuse to go on
[1:38:01] with more when God has given more.
[1:38:03] Hallelujah. Because that's exactly the
[1:38:05] same with the with the seven church
[1:38:06] ages. Hallelujah. When God showed more
[1:38:09] in in Wesley's age to remain under under
[1:38:12] Lutheran saying, "No, I have the message
[1:38:14] for age and I'm happy with and I'm not
[1:38:16] going to move on." If they did not move
[1:38:18] on with the light, they were ikabot.
[1:38:21] Amen. When when Wesley's light came on
[1:38:23] and the more light was given, Amen. to
[1:38:26] stay in in in Luther's message would
[1:38:28] have been kabot. There was no life
[1:38:30] there. The the the glorious departeth.
[1:38:35] And I'm saying this fearfully this
[1:38:36] morning because I don't want to be
[1:38:38] blasphemous in these things, brothers
[1:38:40] and sisters. But we can say God sent a
[1:38:41] prophet serpent seed and all those
[1:38:43] mysteries. And I want to say if that's
[1:38:45] where you stay, the glory is departed.
[1:38:49] The glory is now moved into a place
[1:38:51] where the bride is caught up into a
[1:38:53] union with Christ. And you cannot no
[1:38:56] longer stand and rally around God sent a
[1:38:58] prophet, God sent a prophet, God sent a
[1:39:00] prophet, and just quoting what the
[1:39:01] prophet says. Hallelujah. That personal
[1:39:05] individual revelation of the seventh
[1:39:07] seal which calls us personally up into
[1:39:10] the union with Christ, that's what we
[1:39:12] need for this hour.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah. And that's what the eagle
[1:39:16] anointing is. That's what we get in this
[1:39:19] age. That's where the overcoming power
[1:39:20] lies today to understand who we are.
[1:39:23] Amen. To get the revelation of who we
[1:39:26] are in him.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah.
[1:39:29] So if you say I'm in the message because
[1:39:31] I believe those things, wrong, wrong
[1:39:34] answer. Amen. That is not where life is
[1:39:37] lying today. It's deception. And it's so
[1:39:40] close it could deceive the very elected
[1:39:42] if it was possible. Amen.
[1:39:46] Trust that I'm not hurting anyone's
[1:39:47] feelings here, brothers and
[1:39:50] sisters. Amen. If we refuse the
[1:39:53] bridegroom is here. If we refuse that
[1:39:55] the seventh seal is open, if we refuse
[1:39:57] to believe that we're in the rapturing
[1:40:00] process, if we refuse to believe the
[1:40:03] mighty angel has come down and has
[1:40:05] handed the book to the prophet and that
[1:40:07] we that the mighty angel, I mean, that
[1:40:09] Christ, the three-fold mystery of God,
[1:40:11] has been revealed to
[1:40:12] us. If we refuse to eat that book, to go
[1:40:17] on with the word, to become the book,
[1:40:19] Amen.
[1:40:20] If we refuse those things, we're in the
[1:40:23] shock. Amen. Not seed. I'm not saying
[1:40:27] that you are not seed, but you need to
[1:40:28] move on into the seed. Amen. Come up
[1:40:31] into the capstone. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:34] That still puts you under a man
[1:40:37] anointing. You can't claim to be under
[1:40:39] the eagle anointing and still say,
[1:40:41] "Today, the seventh seal is closed." I'm
[1:40:43] sorry. You cannot.
[1:40:46] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:40:50] Now, now there's something else I want
[1:40:52] to say. And this is something that I
[1:40:53] realized the church
[1:40:56] uh over the last few months. We've had
[1:40:58] questions and answers on on Wednesday
[1:41:00] nights. Um my church is here. So, so
[1:41:03] they would bear witness to those things.
[1:41:05] And what I realized in so many of the
[1:41:07] questions that were answered is that
[1:41:10] there were scarecrows.
[1:41:13] There's so many scarecrows where over
[1:41:15] the years as God revealed things, there
[1:41:17] were so many people. Don't believe Peru.
[1:41:20] Don't say Peru or don't say thunders.
[1:41:23] It's a bad thing. Right? And there were
[1:41:26] so many scarecrows. There were so many,
[1:41:27] oh, don't believe that because then
[1:41:29] you're going to go off in that deep end
[1:41:30] and don't believe that because and
[1:41:32] people gather all these scarecrows so
[1:41:34] that people are eventually so afraid to
[1:41:36] believe the open word because somebody
[1:41:38] 20 years ago said, "Don't believe that."
[1:41:39] But it was not open to that somebody 20
[1:41:41] years ago. And maybe God showed that
[1:41:43] somebody afterwards, but they never had
[1:41:46] the opportunity to come back to you and
[1:41:48] say, "Well, I God showed me more." But I
[1:41:50] want to say, brothers and sisters, God
[1:41:52] has given us more today. Hallelujah. May
[1:41:55] God give us grace. May God break down
[1:41:57] those scarecrows. Amen. We are so scared
[1:42:00] to believe the word. We're so scared
[1:42:02] because, oh, this one has warned me
[1:42:04] about that, brother, and this one has
[1:42:06] warned me about that doctrine. And amen,
[1:42:08] the Holy Spirit will lead us. He's the
[1:42:11] inner teacher. Amen. And I want to say,
[1:42:13] brothers and sisters, cry out with me.
[1:42:15] Lord, I want everything you have for me.
[1:42:17] Brother Ram says, "Pray for revelation
[1:42:19] more than anything else." Yes, sir.
[1:42:21] Hallelujah.
[1:42:24] Let's move on. Brother Ram says, "Man
[1:42:27] always gives God praise for the things
[1:42:29] he did in the past. Look forward to the
[1:42:31] things he will do in the future, but
[1:42:33] miss what he's doing today. And today is
[1:42:36] no different. 2024 is no different."
[1:42:39] Amen. Many times us as people, we place
[1:42:42] things into the
[1:42:44] future. Hallelujah. Hey, listen. If you
[1:42:47] just to make this really practical,
[1:42:50] those Pharisees, those scribes, those
[1:42:51] people in in Jesus's time, the Messiah
[1:42:54] was there, but they were looking for the
[1:42:56] Messiah. Amen. They were putting it in
[1:42:58] the future. This got to be the Messiah.
[1:42:59] We're looking for the Messiah. No. When
[1:43:01] the holy one will come, he will, like
[1:43:03] brother Rand describes, he will roll out
[1:43:04] a red carpet and he will come with the
[1:43:06] angelic choir and the trumpets blowing
[1:43:08] and would walk down and say, "Kephosis,
[1:43:10] here I am." Amen. That's the picture
[1:43:13] that they had. They might not have said
[1:43:14] it in though many those many words, but
[1:43:16] that's subconsciously the idea that they
[1:43:18] had. And we've got the same problem
[1:43:21] today. Amen. man makes up uh ideas or we
[1:43:27] bring ideas from our family culture, our
[1:43:29] church culture, the churches we come
[1:43:31] back from. Sometimes we get ideas just
[1:43:33] by reading a children's Bible. I'm not
[1:43:35] against children's Bibles at all. I
[1:43:37] benefited hugely by by mom reading us
[1:43:40] from the children's Bible as kids. I'm
[1:43:42] still thankful to God for those things
[1:43:43] today. But sometimes some of those
[1:43:45] pictures give us a wrong mental
[1:43:47] impression. And without knowing it, we
[1:43:49] hold on to those things for years and
[1:43:51] years and years and we try and fit that
[1:43:52] in and fit that in and fit that in until
[1:43:54] God comes and breaks down those those
[1:43:56] stones. And it's to remove them so that
[1:43:58] we can see actually that stone in one of
[1:44:00] those bottom layers is wrong. And then
[1:44:02] God needs to remove that stone and
[1:44:04] replace it with a right stone. And then
[1:44:06] the building can go on. Hallelujah.
[1:44:09] Amen. God promised the Messiah would
[1:44:12] come. God prophesied it through so many
[1:44:14] prophets and so forth. And when Jesus
[1:44:16] came in perfect fulfillment in of that
[1:44:18] prophecy and every promise, the very
[1:44:21] people who were looking for him to come,
[1:44:24] the chosen nation of God, I mean, the
[1:44:27] people who dedicated their lives to
[1:44:29] studying the Torah, who were singing the
[1:44:31] Psalms in the temple, like brother Ram
[1:44:32] says, they were singing David's psalm in
[1:44:35] the temple. My God, my God, why? All
[1:44:37] those things. And Jesus was doing the
[1:44:38] reality on the cross and they missed it
[1:44:40] because they were expecting it
[1:44:42] differently. Amen. They missed him
[1:44:45] because he didn't come according to
[1:44:47] their interpretation.
[1:44:49] They wanted God to fit in their box,
[1:44:53] into their understanding, into their
[1:44:55] intellectual interpretation of how it
[1:44:57] was supposed to come. And we do the
[1:45:00] same.
[1:45:02] Amen.
[1:45:04] The very people of God missed the first
[1:45:06] coming of the son of man because of
[1:45:08] their interpretation of the message. And
[1:45:11] obviously I'm saying that as a type of
[1:45:12] today. Instead of just believing the
[1:45:15] message, they try to run ahead of God
[1:45:17] and figure out how it was supposed to
[1:45:19] happen before it happened. Amen. But
[1:45:21] what does brother Bam show us so
[1:45:23] clearly? God reveals his word by
[1:45:26] bringing it to pass.
[1:45:28] So all we can do, brothers and sisters,
[1:45:30] is eat the word and relax. And the Holy
[1:45:33] Spirit will reveal to us. He sovereignly
[1:45:36] reveals to us. Amen. His thoughts are
[1:45:39] higher than our thoughts. I mean, God's
[1:45:41] ways are higher than our ways. And with
[1:45:43] our human thinking, we could never reach
[1:45:45] up into prophet prophecy and interpret
[1:45:47] it right with our human reasoning. We
[1:45:50] cannot. Amen. We will always
[1:45:53] misinterpret
[1:45:55] it. But God is his own interpreter and
[1:45:58] he will bring it to pass exactly as he
[1:46:01] saw it before the foundation of the
[1:46:03] earth. And no matter how much we try to
[1:46:05] interpret it for him, he's not obliged
[1:46:07] to come come according to our
[1:46:09] interpretation, he's only committed to
[1:46:11] his original plan.
[1:46:15] Hallelujah. So, you know what that does?
[1:46:17] It takes off all the pressure.
[1:46:20] Amen.
[1:46:21] Sometimes, you know, even ministers, we
[1:46:23] sometimes put pressure on one another to
[1:46:25] understand something or come up with the
[1:46:27] goods or, you know, what do you think
[1:46:28] about this or what do you think about
[1:46:29] that? And sometimes it's lovely to to
[1:46:31] you know sit and discuss and fellowship
[1:46:33] and say well I think maybe it can be it
[1:46:35] looks like and so forth. And there's
[1:46:36] nothing wrong with that brothers and
[1:46:38] sisters but always leave a comma after
[1:46:41] your statement and say but God can
[1:46:44] change me. God can give me more
[1:46:46] understanding and so forth because he is
[1:46:48] the interpreter and he will bring it to
[1:46:50] pass.
[1:46:53] Hallelujah.
[1:46:55] One of our biggest struggles is our
[1:46:57] denominational interpretations that we
[1:46:59] brought with us.
[1:47:02] And sometimes it's is it's just
[1:47:05] sometimes there's natural cultures that
[1:47:07] influence these things or or you know
[1:47:09] all sorts of influences on our life.
[1:47:11] Sometimes it's just our makeup and so
[1:47:14] forth. And what we do it's like every
[1:47:18] other person in the world. They do
[1:47:20] exactly the same thing. You surround
[1:47:22] yourself by people who agree with what
[1:47:24] you say, right? So then if me and my
[1:47:28] little groupy, we all say the same
[1:47:29] thing, then it's got to be right because
[1:47:31] everyone says it. No, it's just everyone
[1:47:33] in your
[1:47:34] groupy, right?
[1:47:38] That's how it that's I mean, Google
[1:47:40] knows how to work this.
[1:47:42] Amen. Satan knows how to play this game.
[1:47:46] And in the meanwhile, he's dividing and
[1:47:48] conquering because he's building up all
[1:47:50] sorts of groupies. Let's ask the Holy
[1:47:52] Spirit to break down those little
[1:47:53] groupies. Let's all just align with the
[1:47:56] word. And when we come to a place where
[1:47:58] we recognize, I was wrong. Praise the
[1:48:00] Lord. He showed me more. Not I'm going
[1:48:02] to defend it because of my pride. But
[1:48:04] that's what we do unfortunately so
[1:48:07] often. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:48:09] Amen. Let's just speak of some of those
[1:48:11] groups. This is just interesting. You
[1:48:13] know in the time of Jesus when he was on
[1:48:15] earth it was all those religious groups
[1:48:16] they were a Sanhedrin but in that
[1:48:18] Sanhedrin there were so many others that
[1:48:20] were you know part of it Pharisees,
[1:48:22] Sadducees, Zeots, Herodians, Essenes and
[1:48:25] so
[1:48:26] on. But there was one thing they agreed
[1:48:29] on except for a few elected ones. They
[1:48:33] believe this Jesus is false. Right?
[1:48:36] Amen.
[1:48:38] All these other things we don't agree on
[1:48:40] but this guy cannot be the son of man.
[1:48:43] This one cannot be hallelujah. But there
[1:48:47] was a Joseph and a Mary and there was
[1:48:49] different ones. An Nicodemus and a
[1:48:51] Joseph of Arythea and so
[1:48:54] on. Let's just briefly look at some of
[1:48:57] those. So for interest sake, the
[1:49:00] Sadducees. Now I I never can get my head
[1:49:03] around the Sadducees.
[1:49:05] They did not believe in eternity. They
[1:49:08] did not believe in a life after
[1:49:10] death. Their only focus was to keep
[1:49:13] their religious status. They were
[1:49:15] responsible to look after the temple and
[1:49:17] the temple services and all those
[1:49:19] things. And they were just there to keep
[1:49:21] their position. They were typically rich
[1:49:23] people. I mean, come on. Why have a
[1:49:26] religion if you don't believe in life
[1:49:27] after death? I just cannot get my head
[1:49:29] around it. Like, there's something
[1:49:31] missing there, right?
[1:49:33] But the focus of their belief system was
[1:49:35] just to keep the priesthood together and
[1:49:37] preserve their influence and their
[1:49:38] position and so on. Then there's the
[1:49:41] Essins and they they were the exact
[1:49:44] opposite. They saw the temple system as
[1:49:46] corrupt and all sorts and they focused
[1:49:48] on purity and communal living and and
[1:49:51] all those kind of things and um
[1:49:53] according to thus sayith Google they
[1:49:57] they had all sorts of uh apocalyptic
[1:50:00] expectations in in other words you know
[1:50:02] they were probably saying you know we're
[1:50:04] already in the millennium or you know
[1:50:05] things like
[1:50:07] that and the point I'm making is we have
[1:50:10] the same things inside the message
[1:50:12] today. Amen. Amen. I'm not saying that
[1:50:15] just just as a you know put off on
[1:50:17] someone, but I've got I've got cousins
[1:50:19] who believe that that they already in
[1:50:22] the millennium. I mean, what a
[1:50:24] disappointment. What the disappointment.
[1:50:27] And then of course the Pharisees,
[1:50:29] Pharisees, actors, legalists,
[1:50:31] pretenders, hypocrites.
[1:50:35] Amen. Making it look like they are so
[1:50:38] perfect and holy. We've got all these in
[1:50:40] the message. The Herodians, the
[1:50:43] Herodians, all they were about was
[1:50:45] trying to align themselves with the
[1:50:47] leadership and trying to politically
[1:50:48] gain something from it. And then the
[1:50:51] Zeilots again, overthrow Rome and we'll,
[1:50:54] you know, take Rome by force and so
[1:50:56] forth, but not stand back and let God in
[1:50:58] his time deal with it. Amen. And and the
[1:51:02] reason I'm saying this, brothers and
[1:51:03] sisters, you may think, well, this is
[1:51:04] very, very special for a message sermon.
[1:51:07] But the point is people are made up
[1:51:11] differently and we look at scriptures,
[1:51:13] we look at quotes, we look at different
[1:51:16] things from our own perspectives and
[1:51:18] from very very widely varying
[1:51:21] perspectives and and lenses. And then we
[1:51:24] interpret every promise. We interpret,
[1:51:27] you know, every every quote and every
[1:51:29] prophecy. We ex we interpret it through
[1:51:31] our own understandings, through our own
[1:51:34] backgrounds, but many times through our
[1:51:36] own
[1:51:37] needs. Sometimes we interpret promises
[1:51:40] in the Bible through our own motives
[1:51:42] because we want to achieve
[1:51:44] something. We do the same thing today.
[1:51:47] When I say you have we have these kind
[1:51:49] of things in every church where people
[1:51:51] hear the message through our own
[1:51:53] filters and obviously that's the point
[1:51:56] I'm making. May God today break filters
[1:52:00] down. Amen. So we can just look at it
[1:52:03] and say, "Lord, you reveal to me what
[1:52:05] you want." Amen. Amen.
[1:52:10] I'm just going to briefly look at I
[1:52:12] won't be too much longer, but I just
[1:52:13] want to briefly look at a few things
[1:52:14] that we so easily place in the
[1:52:17] future. Let's go to one
[1:52:20] that's ironically still in dispute some
[1:52:23] some
[1:52:24] places. Revelation five. People want to
[1:52:27] keep Christ sitting on the throne and
[1:52:30] the book
[1:52:31] closed. Amen. How can you put Revelation
[1:52:35] 5 in the future? If Revelation 5 is in
[1:52:38] the future, well, then you still have a
[1:52:39] closed book. Then the seals are
[1:52:41] definitely not open. You cannot have the
[1:52:44] seals open and the book's still closed.
[1:52:47] I mean, it's pretty obvious. I mean,
[1:52:49] even even the English language doesn't
[1:52:50] make sense. We need to see, brothers and
[1:52:53] sisters, the lamb has gotten up from the
[1:52:55] throne. He has taken the book. He has
[1:52:57] loosened the seals. The song said, "Thou
[1:52:59] was." Amen. Thou was worthy. Thou hast
[1:53:04] open the seals and so forth. That's the
[1:53:06] song we sing. Revelation 10. Revelation
[1:53:09] 10 is not in the future, brothers and
[1:53:10] sisters. There's a portion of Revelation
[1:53:13] 10 that's 60 years in the past. I mean,
[1:53:16] that seventh angel came, that seventh
[1:53:19] earthly messenger came. He was on earth.
[1:53:22] He did receive the book out of the hand
[1:53:24] of the mighty angel. Amen. And then John
[1:53:27] was instructed to take that book out of
[1:53:29] his hand. And then the the bride is
[1:53:31] instructed to take that book, eat the
[1:53:33] book, become the book, prophesy again,
[1:53:35] express that book, live that book.
[1:53:38] Hallelujah. I mean, that's where we're
[1:53:40] living right now. That's not something
[1:53:42] in the future, brothers and sisters.
[1:53:44] The third pool, well, I've I've dealt
[1:53:46] with that extensively. The third pool is
[1:53:48] not in the future. Amen. We read quotes
[1:53:51] and we think that, you know, when the
[1:53:52] third pool is going to come, there's
[1:53:53] going to be some mighty um, you know,
[1:53:56] things happen. Well, the third pool is
[1:53:57] here. We're living in the third pool.
[1:54:00] And when the need arises, God will
[1:54:01] anoint the bride to do whatever is
[1:54:03] necessary. Amen. Jesus Christ is the
[1:54:05] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:54:07] if there's circumstances that is going
[1:54:10] to require us to speak rain or to speak,
[1:54:13] praise God. But God can do it today. The
[1:54:15] third pool is here. The bride is here.
[1:54:18] Amen. Amen. The bride is under the under
[1:54:20] the anointing of that eagle under the
[1:54:22] third pool.
[1:54:24] Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham had
[1:54:28] those those he discussed that that dream
[1:54:31] of that brother riding this trail again
[1:54:33] and so forth. Amen. The same Holy
[1:54:36] Spirit, the same anointing, the same
[1:54:38] life, the same word in flesh that was in
[1:54:40] brother Brandham is now on the bride.
[1:54:42] Yes,
[1:54:44] God is riding this trail again. Amen.
[1:54:47] Let's not look to something in the
[1:54:49] future. God is riding the straight
[1:54:51] again. What about the bride's revival?
[1:54:54] Brother Brandham says, I can show you a
[1:54:55] quote. The bride has not had a revival
[1:54:57] yet. Well, that's now history.
[1:55:00] Hallelujah. I'm in the bride's revival.
[1:55:02] The word revival is here. I mean, the
[1:55:05] word is open. Hallelujah. Don't misquote
[1:55:09] or quote the the the quote that's now
[1:55:11] history is still as future, brothers and
[1:55:13] sisters. I mean, we're not looking
[1:55:15] forward to the bride's revival. We are
[1:55:17] the bride's revival. I mean, that's why
[1:55:19] brother Brandham said about that little
[1:55:20] cockney who says when they asked him
[1:55:22] where, you know, can you tell us where's
[1:55:24] the where's the Welsh revival? And he
[1:55:25] said, well, you're looking at it. Amen.
[1:55:27] We can say today, can you tell me
[1:55:29] where's the bride's revival? You're
[1:55:30] looking at it. Hallelujah. You're
[1:55:33] looking at the word in flesh today. Oh,
[1:55:35] brother, you don't look like the word to
[1:55:36] me. I don't care what you say. By
[1:55:38] revelation, I am part of him. By
[1:55:40] revelation, I was part of him from
[1:55:42] before the foundation of the earth. By
[1:55:44] revelation, he is taking me through
[1:55:46] every step. He's revealing what I need.
[1:55:48] He's giving me all the spiritual
[1:55:50] vitamins that I need for the battle of
[1:55:51] every single day. And I don't care what
[1:55:53] you see. I don't care what the accuser
[1:55:56] says against me. I don't care what
[1:55:58] anyone says. Hallelujah. He showed me by
[1:56:01] revelation. I am a son of God. That's
[1:56:04] why brother Ram could make the
[1:56:05] statement, I'm not the son of Chelsea
[1:56:07] Braram. God showed me that's not my
[1:56:09] where my where my life comes from. My
[1:56:12] true life comes from heaven. My true
[1:56:14] life in in that revelation I say I come
[1:56:17] from God. I go back to God. In the
[1:56:18] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:56:20] God and the word was with God and I was
[1:56:22] part of that word. That same part of
[1:56:24] that logos was part of me. Amen. My
[1:56:26] theophony was part of that in the
[1:56:28] beginning word.
[1:56:31] Amen.
[1:56:33] Heavenly places. I'm just going to skip
[1:56:35] over some of this.
[1:56:38] My message this morning, brothers and
[1:56:39] sisters, is let's not put things in the
[1:56:42] future that's happening today. Celebrate
[1:56:44] what God is doing today. Embrace it.
[1:56:47] Believe it. Ask God to make it real. If
[1:56:49] it's not real to you, you can't make it
[1:56:51] real to yourself, but ask God. That's
[1:56:53] why Brother Ram says, "Pray for
[1:56:54] revelation more than anything." Let's
[1:56:56] pray for revelation. Let's do what he
[1:56:58] says. Amen. Ask God to make it
[1:57:02] real. I want to ask you something. And
[1:57:04] this this is something to just I I just
[1:57:07] thought about when I was preparing this
[1:57:10] week, brother Rams made many times how
[1:57:15] if God had given him a choice which age
[1:57:17] he want to live
[1:57:18] in. He says I would choose this age. He
[1:57:21] said it would have been wonderful to be
[1:57:22] on earth in the time of Jesus to see all
[1:57:24] the all the miracles and hear him teach
[1:57:27] and hear him explain those things. But
[1:57:29] brothers and sisters, they were still
[1:57:31] looking in a glass darkly with Jesus
[1:57:33] Christ the word there because it was not
[1:57:36] time for the revelation of the things we
[1:57:38] see.
[1:57:39] Hallelujah. But we are so privileged
[1:57:42] that we can now look back over 2,000
[1:57:44] years and say yes that happened
[1:57:46] according to the prophecy. That happened
[1:57:47] according to the prophecy. That happened
[1:57:49] to the according to the prophecy. Now
[1:57:51] John didn't write well it will be you
[1:57:52] know Paulius Martin and so forth. He did
[1:57:54] not write those things but by the
[1:57:56] characteristic of those things today we
[1:57:58] had a prophet that came and placed it
[1:58:00] and that one was Paul and that one was
[1:58:01] Iunius and that one was Martin and that
[1:58:03] one was Columba and we see the whole
[1:58:04] picture unfolding such a blessed thing
[1:58:07] but don't just look all the way to
[1:58:08] brother Brandon we need to look at today
[1:58:11] what God is doing today the the word is
[1:58:14] moving on today so I want to challenge
[1:58:15] you with this this is the thought that
[1:58:17] came to me if I had to choose would I
[1:58:20] want to live in brother Brandham's day
[1:58:22] or in this day
[1:58:24] I take this day any day, my friends.
[1:58:27] Because those people sat in brother
[1:58:29] Brandham's services, but the the the
[1:58:31] curtain of revelation or whatever
[1:58:33] symbology or type you want to use wasn't
[1:58:35] open yet. That's why brother Brandham
[1:58:37] could ask, I think it was Billy Paul
[1:58:39] after the service, Billy, did you
[1:58:40] understand what I was saying? Yes, Dad.
[1:58:42] Billy, did you understand what I was
[1:58:44] saying? No, Dad. Amen. People were
[1:58:46] sitting there and there was an anointing
[1:58:47] and there was an experience and and they
[1:58:49] were excited and people said, "We never
[1:58:51] sat under an anointing like we sat
[1:58:53] there, but they didn't get it because it
[1:58:56] wasn't God's time."
[1:58:59] Today is the day of revelation of those
[1:59:02] things that that prophet preached.
[1:59:04] Hallelujah. I would rather live today
[1:59:06] than in
[1:59:07] 1963. I would rather live today than not
[1:59:10] 64,
[1:59:12] 65. Hallelujah.
[1:59:16] I'm just going to I I'll just refer to
[1:59:18] this in passing. I'm not going to read
[1:59:20] the scriptures and things, but Jesus
[1:59:23] spoke about that pearl of great prize.
[1:59:26] He says, "If you find the pearl of great
[1:59:28] prize, you sell everything you have and
[1:59:30] you dedicate everything to this thing."
[1:59:34] Brothers and sisters, this word that
[1:59:35] we've received, it is the pearl of great
[1:59:38] prize.
[1:59:39] Hallelujah. Amen. This is worth selling
[1:59:43] out everything for. This message is the
[1:59:47] most precious thing that can ever happen
[1:59:49] to us.
[1:59:51] Hallelujah. I want to encourage you,
[1:59:53] brothers and
[1:59:54] sisters. I'm so thankful that God has
[1:59:56] revealed it to
[1:59:58] us. I'm going to go back to our opening
[2:00:07] scripture. Jesus made this statement in
[2:00:09] Matthew 24. Now remember, Matthew 24 is
[2:00:12] prophecy about the future from where
[2:00:13] Jesus stood. Except those days should be
[2:00:16] shortened, there should be no flesh be
[2:00:18] saved. But for the elect's sake, those
[2:00:21] days shall be
[2:00:22] shortened. And then he goes on and he
[2:00:24] says, "But where the carcass is, the
[2:00:27] eagles will
[2:00:29] gather." Where is the carcass today, the
[2:00:31] word, Amen. Where is the carcass today?
[2:00:34] The carcass today, my friends, is not
[2:00:36] God sent a prophet. That's yesterday's
[2:00:40] manner. Amen. Don't be offended at me.
[2:00:43] The carcass
[2:00:45] today, the bride will know who she is.
[2:00:49] If this bride knows who she is, she will
[2:00:52] one day, then the rapture will go.
[2:00:57] The revelation of who you are is being
[2:00:59] revealed
[2:01:01] now. Amen. It wasn't revealed in 63 to
[2:01:06] the bride.
[2:01:08] I trust you're not misquing me there.
[2:01:11] But God is revealing in this day who we
[2:01:14] are. God is making the word alive to us
[2:01:18] in this day. Amen. But brothers and
[2:01:21] sisters, we can't sympathize with this
[2:01:23] word only. We must sell out everything.
[2:01:26] Amen. Amen. God is God is wooing this
[2:01:30] bride to become one with him to come
[2:01:33] into full union with him to come into
[2:01:35] full submission of his headship giving
[2:01:38] him total and complete preeminence.
[2:01:40] Amen. And even if you don't understand
[2:01:44] it, believe it.
[2:01:46] Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] You know, we can refer to the rich young
[2:01:50] ruler and different ones. He was in the
[2:01:52] message. He learned about the word. He
[2:01:54] tried by human effort to keep the letter
[2:01:56] of the word, but there were things that
[2:01:58] he held dearer than the pearl of great
[2:02:01] price.
[2:02:03] Amen. Many people want the benefit of
[2:02:06] redemption, but they don't want the
[2:02:07] surrender. They want a savior, but not a
[2:02:10] lord.
[2:02:12] In other words, a lukewarm loadier
[2:02:15] condition, not fully sold
[2:02:18] out. Hallelujah. But remember that rich
[2:02:21] young ruler in the time that he least
[2:02:23] expected, when his bonds were full, when
[2:02:26] things were going so well with him
[2:02:27] naturally, he opened up his eyes in
[2:02:30] hell. Amen. Don't put off your full
[2:02:34] surrender. Tomorrow might be too late.
[2:02:37] Maybe the musicians can come.
[2:02:40] I just want to say this, brothers and
[2:02:42] sisters. I just want to bring this
[2:02:43] thought together. I don't want to leave
[2:02:44] this hanging. Remember I started off by
[2:02:48] saying God has drawn a
[2:02:52] map and there was no age like this one
[2:02:55] where we can actually see where we're at
[2:02:58] on the map. You see the problem is if
[2:03:01] you if you give someone a map in the
[2:03:04] hand, it doesn't help them at all.
[2:03:08] Okay, get what I'm saying? You see a
[2:03:10] map, what's the first thing you ask?
[2:03:13] Where am I? Amen. You get into a
[2:03:16] shopping center, there's always a, you
[2:03:17] know, a big red arrow sometimes and it
[2:03:19] says you are here. Now, the previous
[2:03:22] church ages, they had the map. They had
[2:03:24] the map. They had the map, but they had
[2:03:25] no idea where they were at on the map.
[2:03:27] They don't didn't even have a revelation
[2:03:28] of what the map means. Today, we have
[2:03:31] such a perspective of the map. We saw
[2:03:34] how all those different church ages pl
[2:03:37] panned out and we saw who the, you know,
[2:03:39] the messengers were and we saw what the
[2:03:40] anointings were behind it and we saw all
[2:03:42] those things, brothers and sisters. And
[2:03:44] God showed us, you're right here at the
[2:03:47] end. Where you're at on the map is right
[2:03:51] there in the headstone. Wonder if I've
[2:03:53] got
[2:03:56] the Let me just go
[2:03:58] back. There we
[2:04:01] go. You are
[2:04:03] here. Amen. I trust you can say today,
[2:04:07] I'm not in ladies here. I'm not out in
[2:04:09] Egypt. Amen. God has shown us we are
[2:04:13] here. And because he's shown us we are
[2:04:15] here at the end of time at the brink of
[2:04:18] time at at this place where where this
[2:04:20] earth will be burnt and we're going to
[2:04:22] walk out on the ashes of the wicked. But
[2:04:25] the thing that is that is so special to
[2:04:27] us brothers and sisters. We know we're
[2:04:29] right here at this point where the bride
[2:04:32] is becoming one with the groom and where
[2:04:35] the next thing that is going to happen
[2:04:37] for us is he's taking us into a marriage
[2:04:40] supper. He's taking us to the feast.
[2:04:43] Hallelujah. And while we're in the feast
[2:04:45] then is the great tribulation on earth
[2:04:47] when God reveals himself to the Jews and
[2:04:49] so forth. And after that three and a
[2:04:50] half years, then he takes us on a
[2:04:53] honeymoon. Praise God. Because we know
[2:04:55] where we're at on the map. We know
[2:04:56] that's what's going
[2:04:58] next. But at the same time, there's a
[2:05:00] warning, brothers and
[2:05:03] sisters. Don't be part of that
[2:05:06] deception. Don't be the chaff that is
[2:05:08] burned. Don't be the one that is left
[2:05:12] behind. Knowing we were out on the
[2:05:15] map is still not enough. If you don't
[2:05:19] submit to where the directions tell you
[2:05:21] to go next, hallelujah. You can still
[2:05:24] end up in the wrong place.
[2:05:28] Hallelujah. God swore by himself in this
[2:05:31] age, there shall be time no
[2:05:35] longer. And brothers and sisters, that
[2:05:37] is not something in the future. We're at
[2:05:41] the place in history where time has run
[2:05:44] out.
[2:05:46] Don't be caught up in just a lukewarm
[2:05:48] Pentecostal
[2:05:49] leodia life where the church is
[2:05:52] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked,
[2:05:54] and don't know it. Sell out. God says,
[2:05:57] "Come buy of me." Amen.
[2:06:00] Amen. Gold tried in the fire and so
[2:06:03] forth without money and without price. I
[2:06:06] mean, let's just stand
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:10] together. If the Lord is speaking to
[2:06:12] your heart this morning, let's just all
[2:06:14] close our eyes. So if the Lord is
[2:06:15] speaking to your
[2:06:18] heart, maybe you you want to respond to
[2:06:21] the Lord and say, "Lord, I need more
[2:06:25] revelation or I need a fuller
[2:06:29] surrender. I don't want to be like that
[2:06:31] rich young ruler that just looked at all
[2:06:34] the successes of life and did not
[2:06:37] recognize my time is running out."
[2:06:40] If that's you this morning, you can
[2:06:42] express it to the Lord with an uplifted
[2:06:43] hand as we
[2:06:47] pray. Most precious and loving
[2:06:54] father, Lord, I know many statements
[2:06:57] were made that could be taken wrong.
[2:07:00] Father, I just place it in your
[2:07:05] hand, oh Lord. But when you departed
[2:07:07] 2,000 years ago, you said that you will
[2:07:10] send the teacher and he will make these
[2:07:12] things known to us,
[2:07:14] Father. Lord, this morning, Lord, I want
[2:07:17] to pray that that inner teacher, Father,
[2:07:19] will go beyond every barrier, every
[2:07:22] defensive wall, every preconceived
[2:07:25] idea, oh, every scarecrow, Lord, and
[2:07:30] reveal to us where we are, where we're
[2:07:31] at, Lord.
[2:07:33] Oh father, this morning I want to lift
[2:07:35] up my hands with my brothers and
[2:07:37] sisters, Lord, and say, "Father, I need
[2:07:40] more of you. I need more
[2:07:43] revelation. Oh, Father, I need to see
[2:07:47] who I am,
[2:07:49] Lord. Father, help us, Lord, not to stay
[2:07:52] behind in in the shack,
[2:07:55] Father." But Lord, your pro prophet
[2:07:57] speaks about it's the coming of the
[2:08:01] combine. We're in the harvest time,
[2:08:04] Lord. Let us be ready,
[2:08:07] Father. Lord Jesus, I pray that your
[2:08:10] spirit will work on hearts even now,
[2:08:15] Father. Lord, have your
[2:08:22] way. Lord Jesus, I pray that you will
[2:08:24] draw every eagle to you,
[2:08:27] Father. Oh Lord Jesus, I pray Lord if
[2:08:30] there's still a bride member, an elected
[2:08:32] seed sitting in Lotusa, sitting in go in
[2:08:35] in Egypt, Father, that you will call
[2:08:38] that seed up higher. Father, reveal
[2:08:42] yourself. Thank you, Lord. We give you
[2:08:46] all the glory and we ask these things in
[2:08:49] the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[2:08:51] Christ. Amen. Thank you, Father. Thank
[2:08:53] you,
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:09:03] How great are you,
[2:09:09] Lord? How great is your mercy.
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:18] Oh, how great are the
[2:09:20] things that you have done for
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:29] me. How great are you, Lord?
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:37] Loving
[2:09:40] [Music]
[2:09:43] kindness is filling my heart as I

[2:10:07] [Music]
[2:10:09] How great is the

[2:10:36] mercy, how great are the
[2:10:39] things that you have done for me.
[2:10:48] How great are you,
[2:10:50] [Music]
[2:10:53] Lord? Your loving
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:11:01] kindness is filling my heart as I
[2:11:06] sing. How great are you,
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:10] Lord? Amen.

[2:11:38] There's only one name that is worthy.
[2:11:44] [Music]
[2:11:46] There's only one king on the

[2:13:32] He is the alpha and

[2:15:38] strongest and most
