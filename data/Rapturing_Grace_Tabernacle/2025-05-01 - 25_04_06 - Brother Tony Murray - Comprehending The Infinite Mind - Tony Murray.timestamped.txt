[1:01:44] I
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:55] create.
[1:01:57] Amen. I mean, brother Tony, when
[1:01:59] whenever you ready, brother, just at
[1:02:01] your own time.
[1:02:04] Amen.
[1:02:09] Let's sing. I have a
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:14] maker. I
[1:02:16] have a maker.
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:25] before my
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:31] heart.
[1:02:33] Before
[1:02:35] even
[1:02:38] began our love was
[1:02:42] in his side.
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:49] He
[1:02:50] knows my name.
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:02:58] He
[1:03:04] my
[1:03:11] he and he me
[1:03:15] where I go.
[1:03:22] I have a father.
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:30] He calls
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:37] me
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:57] never.
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] Yeah.
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:13] Heat.
[1:04:15] Yeah. Heat.
[1:04:19] [Applause]
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:27] Oh
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:37] my god.
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:57] He
[1:04:58] knows
[1:05:04] my heat.
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:16] each and
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] more
[1:05:22] way I
[1:05:25] go. Amen. Isn't that good news? Amen. He
[1:05:29] knows us by name. Praise the Lord. I
[1:05:31] just really blessed by the songs this
[1:05:33] morning. So much along the line that uh
[1:05:35] I believe the Lord's put on my heart,
[1:05:37] the subject to speak on. And so you just
[1:05:39] kind of it's it's a nice thing, you
[1:05:41] know, you hear the song sing this is
[1:05:43] just right along the line that I believe
[1:05:44] the Lord wants us to to focus on this
[1:05:46] morning. So, uh, I'm pleased about that.
[1:05:49] Amen. It's good to see you. God bless
[1:05:50] you each one. We're, um, we're always
[1:05:53] pleased when we can catch up with
[1:05:54] brethren we haven't seen for a while,
[1:05:56] but see, we're still pressing on the
[1:05:57] upward way. We're getting closer to
[1:05:59] home. I think we can see that uh the
[1:06:02] situation in the world, God bless you,
[1:06:03] brother Paul, is uh that the situation
[1:06:06] in the world is just deteriorating so
[1:06:08] quickly, so badly. But um that's signs
[1:06:11] of home for us. Amen. So we're thankful
[1:06:14] to know that uh all the signs that the
[1:06:17] the scriptures given us, the prophet has
[1:06:19] pointed us to, we see them being
[1:06:20] fulfilled and we're we're on our way
[1:06:23] home. Amen. God bless you. Thank you,
[1:06:24] musicians.
[1:06:26] And maybe if you just take your
[1:06:27] scripture while you're standing, we'll
[1:06:29] read out of Romans. Romans chapter
[1:06:33] 11. I heard from brother Al this
[1:06:35] morning. He sent me a text from wherever
[1:06:37] he is over in South Africa. I just uh
[1:06:40] wishing us well and and so just pass on
[1:06:43] greetings from him and um know that
[1:06:46] they're thinking of us as well.
[1:06:51] Romans chapter 11 and verse
[1:06:57] 33. It says here, "Oh, the depth of the
[1:07:01] riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
[1:07:03] of God. How uncarchable are his
[1:07:05] judgments and his ways past finding out.
[1:07:09] Who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or
[1:07:12] who hath been his counselor?" Verse 36.
[1:07:15] For of him and through him and to him
[1:07:18] are all things to whom be glory forever.
[1:07:22] Amen. Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly
[1:07:24] Father, Lord, we just read the
[1:07:26] scripture, but Lord, I pray that you'd
[1:07:28] just break the the thought of these
[1:07:29] things to us, Lord, that we can truly
[1:07:31] grasp how great you are and the position
[1:07:34] that you've called for us to be into. We
[1:07:36] ask and pray in Jesus' name. Amen. And
[1:07:40] amen. God bless you. May be
[1:07:41] seated. Now, the the subject that I've
[1:07:45] uh felt on my heart to speak on this
[1:07:47] morning is is a pretty big subject and
[1:07:50] uh not so much that it's long to preach,
[1:07:52] but uh that it's a it's a big subject.
[1:07:55] And I've entitled it comprehending the
[1:07:58] infinite
[1:07:59] mind. Comprehending the infinite mind.
[1:08:01] Here we know that we are we're in finite
[1:08:04] minds. We know that our thinking is
[1:08:06] limited. um our abilities are limited.
[1:08:09] But yet we're coming to a God who is
[1:08:11] infinite and that his thinking is
[1:08:13] infinite. He he doesn't he doesn't have
[1:08:16] anything that restricts him other than
[1:08:18] his own word. When he says I will do
[1:08:21] something, he's restricted. He has to do
[1:08:23] that. When he says I won't do something,
[1:08:25] he's restricted by that. But apart from
[1:08:27] that, he's unlimited. He's infinite. And
[1:08:31] it would seem like an impossibility for
[1:08:33] us to even broach this subject of
[1:08:36] comprehending the infinite mind apart
[1:08:39] from the fact that he says that's what I
[1:08:40] want you to do. I want you to know me. I
[1:08:44] want you to understand me. So how can
[1:08:47] finite creatures like us comprehend and
[1:08:50] understand him? But that's what he
[1:08:52] wants. So, he's got to make a way and he
[1:08:54] has made a way that we can come to him
[1:08:58] that we can interface with this the
[1:09:00] infinite God. And when we when we get to
[1:09:03] the end of the story, the end of the of
[1:09:05] even the service this morning, we should
[1:09:07] be able to see that not only is he
[1:09:08] wanting us that to to understand him,
[1:09:11] but he says actually you are like me.
[1:09:15] Wow. That that's a far cry from how we
[1:09:18] feel. when you got up this
[1:09:20] morning, did you feel like the almighty
[1:09:26] God? I didn't feel like that. But yet,
[1:09:29] that's who we are. And it's there's an
[1:09:31] amnesia. There's a there's something
[1:09:33] that's got to be broken away from
[1:09:34] understanding that we can actually see
[1:09:36] who we are in him. And so, Lord willing,
[1:09:38] that's where we're going to go with this
[1:09:40] this morning. Amen. So it is a paradox
[1:09:43] that we would come to this understanding
[1:09:45] of who he is and who we are in him. He's
[1:09:49] the great creator that created the whole
[1:09:52] universe. But he wants to be known.
[1:09:54] David in the Psalms he says when I
[1:09:56] consider thy heavens and the work of thy
[1:09:58] fingers, the moon, the stars which they
[1:10:00] hast ordained, what is man that thou art
[1:10:04] mindful of them? How come the great
[1:10:07] creator of the whole universe takes an
[1:10:10] interest in you?
[1:10:11] and takes an interest in me. But that's
[1:10:13] what the Bible says.
[1:10:16] He came and he himself came and became a
[1:10:19] man and died for you, the creator of
[1:10:24] heaven and earth. Amen. And the things I
[1:10:27] want to say this morning, you know, they
[1:10:29] they relate to people who are believers.
[1:10:31] If we're not a believer, we can't claim
[1:10:34] them. But he's given us the opportunity.
[1:10:36] He's he's opened the the the
[1:10:39] availability for us to accept him and
[1:10:41] accept his ways. And if we do, he says,
[1:10:43] "Now I want you to come up and stand
[1:10:45] with me and see your position in me."
[1:10:48] Amen. What is man that they are mindful
[1:10:51] of him and the son of man that they
[1:10:52] visit visitor him. And then Paul with
[1:10:55] all the different things that he writes,
[1:10:56] he gets to Philippians and he says, "Oh
[1:10:59] that I that I may know
[1:11:01] him may know him in the power of his
[1:11:03] resurrection." Wow. He wants to know
[1:11:06] this great Jehovah God. And I'm so
[1:11:09] thankful for the message that we've
[1:11:11] received. We know things that
[1:11:14] generations and uh thousands of years
[1:11:16] ago they wanted to know. Yeah, that's
[1:11:18] right. We know things that science is
[1:11:20] trying to figure out and it's just been
[1:11:22] handed to us. Amen. We should be such a
[1:11:25] thankful people. Amen. If we feel like
[1:11:28] sometimes we're down in the dumps, say,
[1:11:30] "Hey, what's going on here?" because
[1:11:33] that's that's the devil trying to put us
[1:11:34] in that position because actually we are
[1:11:37] kind of his kind. Amen. That's who we
[1:11:41] are. We're kind of of the kind of the
[1:11:43] Lord. It it's it's an amazing thing, but
[1:11:46] hopefully you're not quite convinced
[1:11:48] yet, but by the time we get to the end,
[1:11:50] hopefully he will be. Amen. So, that's
[1:11:51] where we're heading with that. But we
[1:11:54] have amazing insights into uh the mind
[1:11:57] of Christ.
[1:12:00] All right. Now just here we're we are
[1:12:02] three-dimensional beings ourselves. Not
[1:12:04] just so much that we live in a
[1:12:05] three-dimensional world, but we we have
[1:12:07] a body that's physically us. We have a
[1:12:10] spirit which is our human spirit. That's
[1:12:12] that's what we would say that's our
[1:12:14] human life. And then we have a soul
[1:12:16] realm which is that's God himself.
[1:12:18] That's our theophony. That's the eternal
[1:12:20] part part of us. And people when they're
[1:12:24] looking and trying to find answers to
[1:12:25] all sorts of things in in this life,
[1:12:27] it's science. They look in the physical
[1:12:29] world world. They look in this realm.
[1:12:31] They're looking everywhere to try and
[1:12:33] find God. But he is so complex. They
[1:12:35] can't find him. And he didn't intend
[1:12:38] that we would find him in the physical
[1:12:40] realm. We see his handiwork. We're in
[1:12:42] awe of what he's done. You can't
[1:12:44] interface with them because the level of
[1:12:46] his understanding to our understanding
[1:12:48] is the the the gulf is just too wide.
[1:12:51] Amen. And even in the spiritual realm,
[1:12:53] people often get they feel this and they
[1:12:56] go to all sorts of different things to
[1:12:57] try and get psychology and psychology
[1:12:59] and things trying to understand who we
[1:13:02] are and the you can't understand you
[1:13:05] know you know people say no one
[1:13:07] understands me. That's absolutely true
[1:13:10] because we don't understand ourselves.
[1:13:12] That's right. So so what about
[1:13:14] understanding somebody else in spirit
[1:13:16] realm? It's a complete waste of time.
[1:13:19] But supernaturally in the soul realm,
[1:13:22] we're part of him. Amen. And that's
[1:13:24] where we need to be focusing on. That's
[1:13:26] why we come to church. That's we need to
[1:13:28] know him in the power of his
[1:13:30] resurrection. Now, you know, Satan right
[1:13:33] now, Brother Random tells us, is in
[1:13:34] heaven and he's accuser of the brethren.
[1:13:36] He talks with God and and he and he say,
[1:13:40] "Oh, look what they're doing." And the
[1:13:41] Lord says, "It's under the blood. It's
[1:13:43] under the blood." He's saying that but
[1:13:45] you know Satan doesn't know God yet he
[1:13:48] talks to God. Brother Brandham said
[1:13:51] Satan the spirit of the devil which is
[1:13:54] now as the accuser of the brethren. He
[1:13:55] says when Satan when the church is taken
[1:13:57] up Satan's cast out and then Satan comes
[1:14:00] and incarnates himself Antichrist called
[1:14:02] the beast. But he says but the devil is
[1:14:04] religious as can be. Smart scholarly
[1:14:07] polished but yet he knows no more about
[1:14:09] God than a rabbit would know about
[1:14:10] snowshoes.
[1:14:12] So it's not the knowing that we're
[1:14:14] talking about. He can talk to God. He
[1:14:17] can interface with him, but he doesn't
[1:14:19] know him because it's not a relationship
[1:14:22] with him. Amen. So we need to have that
[1:14:24] relationship with him. And he's made one
[1:14:27] way that that's a possibility. Amen. So
[1:14:30] God doesn't just want us to to know
[1:14:32] about him. He wants us to know him.
[1:14:35] Amen. when he was uh talking to Moses,
[1:14:38] he said, you know, and all the great
[1:14:40] things happened to Moses' ministry, but
[1:14:41] he says, um, tell them to make a
[1:14:44] sanctuary. Make a place where I can
[1:14:46] dwell with them.
[1:14:48] Wow. Let them make me a sanctuary.
[1:14:51] Exodus 25:8, let them make me a
[1:14:53] sanctuary that I may dwell among them.
[1:14:56] Wow. And then Steven in Acts 7 when he's
[1:14:59] giving his address to the council, he
[1:15:01] says, Solomon built him a house. How be
[1:15:02] it the most high dwelleth not in temples
[1:15:04] made with hands, is sth the prophet.
[1:15:07] Heaven is my throne, and earth is my
[1:15:08] foottool. What house will ye build me,
[1:15:11] saith the Lord. What is the place of my
[1:15:13] rest? Hath not my hand made all these
[1:15:15] things? But then in Corinthians 6, he
[1:15:18] says, what know ye not that your body is
[1:15:22] the temple of the Holy Ghost? Wow. The
[1:15:24] temple, the place of the of rest for
[1:15:27] Jehovah God. He's chosen to be in you
[1:15:31] and chosen to be in me right here. And
[1:15:35] then brother Brandham says here, God is
[1:15:37] right here. He says, let's see if we can
[1:15:40] see him. And then he says, uh, by God's
[1:15:43] help, I'm going to try and prove to you
[1:15:45] that he's right, that God is right here.
[1:15:47] First, we're going to talk about God in
[1:15:49] his creation, a next God in his word, a
[1:15:52] next God in his son, a next God in his
[1:15:54] people. And let's see if we can see him.
[1:15:57] So, I kind of want to follow through
[1:15:58] this little uh the same sequence this
[1:16:01] morning. And we're going to talk
[1:16:02] sometime just a little while about some
[1:16:05] science facts. And I won't go too long
[1:16:07] cuz some of you will get really bored
[1:16:08] with that. But so maybe some of the
[1:16:10] children might find that a little
[1:16:12] interesting. So we're going to have a
[1:16:13] look at some of those things. God in his
[1:16:14] creation and God in his word, God in his
[1:16:18] son, and next God in his people. Amen.
[1:16:22] So that's where we're we're heading. You
[1:16:25] know, God is incredibly complex.
[1:16:28] Everything that he has made intersects
[1:16:31] and intertwines with everything else. I
[1:16:34] read recently somewhere that the planet
[1:16:36] Jupiter, which is five times further
[1:16:38] away from us than than we are from the
[1:16:40] sun. So, it's a long long way away, but
[1:16:43] they worked out that it is in exactly
[1:16:45] the right place in its orbit from the
[1:16:47] sun to protect Earth from asteroids and
[1:16:51] and comets and so forth. They said if it
[1:16:53] was 10% closer it would protect Venus.
[1:16:56] If it was 10% further away it would
[1:16:59] protect Mars. But where it is
[1:17:02] mathematically they've calculated it's
[1:17:04] it's saves us from a lot of trouble. And
[1:17:08] some years ago there was an asteroid
[1:17:10] that crashed into Jupiter called
[1:17:12] Schumaka Levy and it's it was in 10
[1:17:15] pieces but the biggest piece that hit
[1:17:16] Jupiter it set up a firestorm that was
[1:17:19] bigger than the size of the whole earth.
[1:17:21] So if it hit us, we wouldn't be here.
[1:17:23] But he's got Jupiter just going around
[1:17:26] at the right place. So everything
[1:17:28] intertwines. Everything. If one thing
[1:17:31] was out of place, Brother Brim says that
[1:17:33] would throw the whole thing into chaos.
[1:17:35] But he knows what he's doing. Amen.
[1:17:37] Amen. So because it's so complex, the
[1:17:41] more that science works out, the more
[1:17:44] improbable that we would actually be
[1:17:46] here.
[1:17:48] They've calculated that it just got the
[1:17:51] more and more things that they discover
[1:17:52] the more and more this can't be. It's so
[1:17:55] precise that so they've said because it
[1:17:58] can't be by by chance they've come up
[1:18:01] with this theory they call the
[1:18:03] multiverse and the multiverse principle
[1:18:05] or theory is that there must be an
[1:18:08] infinite number of in of universes or at
[1:18:11] least an infinite number of trials at
[1:18:13] universes and we just happen to live on
[1:18:16] the lucky one.
[1:18:18] Now that this that sounds ridiculous,
[1:18:20] but that's actually what they believe.
[1:18:22] And and there must be an infinite number
[1:18:24] of dimensions that these trials have
[1:18:26] taken place in. And they fail fail fail
[1:18:30] hasn't worked. But we happen to be on
[1:18:32] the lucky one. And I got something here
[1:18:34] just to read to you in a second from uh
[1:18:36] a chap that you probably have heard of.
[1:18:39] Uh Stephven Hawking. Stephven Hawking.
[1:18:42] He was a English theoretical physicist
[1:18:44] and cosmin cosmologist. And he said,
[1:18:48] "They talk about the big bang, right?
[1:18:49] The big bang." Now, we actually believe
[1:18:51] in a big bang. It's called creation. It
[1:18:54] was under control. It was designed.
[1:18:58] Brother says, you know, when he made the
[1:18:59] the heavens and the earth and so forth,
[1:19:01] he said, "Yeah, that was billions of
[1:19:02] years ago." But he just let it play out
[1:19:06] in time till he got everything in the
[1:19:07] right place. He's in no hurry. That's
[1:19:09] the way it is. But I'm sure when he
[1:19:12] started it would have been pretty noisy
[1:19:14] if there been any any air for the noise
[1:19:17] to travel through. But it would have
[1:19:20] been a colossal bang when he started.
[1:19:22] But anyhow, science they believe in a
[1:19:24] big bang cuz they can see the the
[1:19:26] remnants of it uh in space even now. But
[1:19:30] he says here just and I'm not saying the
[1:19:32] science has got everything right. But
[1:19:33] this is just kind of gives you a bit of
[1:19:34] an idea how unlikely it is that we would
[1:19:37] be here by chance. If the rate of
[1:19:39] expansion 1 second after the big bang
[1:19:42] bang had been smaller by even one part
[1:19:44] in a 100,000 million million, it would
[1:19:47] have recolapsed before it reached its
[1:19:49] present size. On the other hand, if it
[1:19:52] had been greater by a part in a million,
[1:19:55] the universe would have expanded too
[1:19:56] rapidly for stars and planets to form.
[1:20:01] They know it's so highly unlikely. So,
[1:20:05] we've got to have another theory because
[1:20:09] uh they have to have an infinite number
[1:20:12] of tries to get what we've got because
[1:20:14] they won't they're not prepared to
[1:20:15] accept that there could be an infinite
[1:20:16] creator.
[1:20:18] The real answer is that the infinite
[1:20:20] mind of an infinite God just tweaked
[1:20:23] things exactly right so we could be
[1:20:26] here. But if you're not prepared to
[1:20:27] accept that, you've got to come up with
[1:20:29] a wild theory that there's just so many
[1:20:31] just universes just blowing up all over
[1:20:33] the show and we happen to be on the
[1:20:35] lucky one. That's insane really.
[1:20:39] All right. Another thing that's insane
[1:20:41] is that if uh if science sees something
[1:20:44] uh complexity is a marker of uh
[1:20:48] intelligent design. So if you see
[1:20:50] something that's that's complicated, you
[1:20:51] see a maybe a Ferrari go down the road,
[1:20:54] you don't go, "Wow, evolution's
[1:20:57] great, you
[1:20:59] know." But if an archaeologist finds a
[1:21:02] stone
[1:21:03] tool, and it's and it's actually it's
[1:21:06] been sharpened to a point. It's a rock,
[1:21:09] but it's been sharpened to a point. He
[1:21:11] goes, "This was a a very advanced
[1:21:15] civilization." It's very advanced. Look,
[1:21:18] it's stone tool. they've made it. And
[1:21:20] then if they find one that's got a
[1:21:21] wooden handle on it, that these were
[1:21:23] intelligent people. These were so
[1:21:25] intelligent. And yet when science
[1:21:28] discovered and decoded the genome, they
[1:21:31] found that our genome, the the DNA of us
[1:21:34] has three billion pairs of coded
[1:21:39] computer
[1:21:40] code. Three billion pairs in every cell
[1:21:43] in every 30 trillion cells that are in
[1:21:45] our body. and they go, "Oh, don't know
[1:21:49] where that came from."
[1:21:52] It's insane. Because
[1:21:55] intelligence, the the complexity of
[1:21:57] design speaks of a designer. Amen. I'm
[1:22:01] glad he's opened our eyes. We see those
[1:22:03] things. It seems so simple when you see
[1:22:05] it. But brother Brennham tells us that
[1:22:07] before the beginning, he says there was
[1:22:10] nothing. He said there was no light.
[1:22:12] There's no dark, no atoms, no nothing,
[1:22:14] nothing tangible, no time, nothing past,
[1:22:16] present or future. There was just
[1:22:18] nothing except the infinite mind of
[1:22:23] Jehovah God. That was
[1:22:25] it. Just that was all there was. The
[1:22:28] infinite mind of Jehovah God. You see,
[1:22:30] there's no light, no dark, there's no
[1:22:32] nothing. It just seems nothing. But in
[1:22:34] there is that great supernatural being
[1:22:36] Jehovah God who covered all space of all
[1:22:38] places of all times. And he says he
[1:22:41] wasn't even God then because God is an
[1:22:43] object to worship and there was nothing
[1:22:44] to worship him. He says and then he made
[1:22:47] angels. He says when he created angels
[1:22:49] there was something to worship him and
[1:22:51] then technically that that made made him
[1:22:54] under the definition of
[1:22:55] God. Amen. Now God can do all things.
[1:22:59] Brother M says and he can do things that
[1:23:01] are not written in the Bible because
[1:23:03] he's God. In Job he says God thunder
[1:23:06] marvelously with his voice. Great things
[1:23:09] doeth he which we cannot comprehend. I
[1:23:11] think if we're being realistic, that's
[1:23:13] it. He He does great things. We say, I
[1:23:15] can't work that out. That's how it is.
[1:23:18] And then in Psalms, he said, "He tellth
[1:23:20] the number of the stars, and he calleth
[1:23:22] them all by their
[1:23:23] names." Okay, that's a lot of
[1:23:26] names. You know, in our galaxy, which is
[1:23:29] the Milky Way, we have up to 400 billion
[1:23:33] stars. 400 billion. I tell you what a
[1:23:36] billion is. Does anybody know what a
[1:23:37] billion is? Okay, it's it's a real big
[1:23:40] number. It's hard to get your head
[1:23:40] around, but if you had a box that was a
[1:23:43] meter
[1:23:45] wide this way and that way, and a meter
[1:23:48] high and you filled it with granular
[1:23:50] sand like this, like salt filled it with
[1:23:54] sand, you'd have a billion. That's a
[1:23:56] billion. A box that big. A meter by a
[1:23:59] meter. A cubic meter filled with
[1:24:01] granular sand is a billion. Just so you
[1:24:03] got a bit of an idea.
[1:24:05] 400 billion in our galaxy and science
[1:24:09] believe that there's two trillion
[1:24:11] galaxies in the universe each with
[1:24:15] around about 400 billion stars in them.
[1:24:19] So a big number but I only say that to
[1:24:21] say this God says I know them all by
[1:24:23] name.
[1:24:26] His understanding is infinite.
[1:24:29] Amen. And some of them have probably got
[1:24:31] your name on them.
[1:24:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. And just while
[1:24:38] we're on the sciency line, the the
[1:24:41] complexity of even our galaxy, it's
[1:24:44] what's what's called uh it's considered
[1:24:46] to be a uh a quiet galaxy. And we live
[1:24:49] in a quiet place in our galaxy on one of
[1:24:51] the the radio arms. In fact, we're just
[1:24:53] slightly off the radio arm. We can see
[1:24:54] through out like a window up and down.
[1:24:57] We can see other galaxies outside
[1:24:58] because we're not in in too uh much of a
[1:25:01] a traffic jam of other stars. In fact,
[1:25:04] if there was any stars that were close
[1:25:05] enough to us that were going to
[1:25:07] supernova,
[1:25:09] um, we would within 50 light years of
[1:25:11] us, we'd be in trouble. But in our
[1:25:14] neighborhood, just as it turns out, we
[1:25:16] don't have any of those. But outside,
[1:25:19] the supernova is happening all the time
[1:25:21] and they would blow us to bits. But not
[1:25:23] here. He knows what he's doing. Amen.
[1:25:27] All right. The Earth is just the right
[1:25:29] distance from the Sun to be what they
[1:25:30] call a Goldilock zone. We've got a
[1:25:33] molten core which creates a magnetic
[1:25:36] field protect us from the sun. I think
[1:25:38] they say here every second one and a
[1:25:40] half million tons of solar material
[1:25:43] shoot out of the sun traveling at 100
[1:25:45] miles per second and our magnetic field
[1:25:48] deflects them away cuz they're ionized.
[1:25:50] So they go either to one pole or the
[1:25:51] other and they miss us and go straight
[1:25:53] past. Otherwise we'd be fried by those
[1:25:56] uh their solar winds and so forth coming
[1:25:59] from the sun. the atmosphere that was is
[1:26:02] made up happens to be just right. I saw
[1:26:05] somebody saying that if we got 21%
[1:26:07] oxygen, but if we had 25% oxygen,
[1:26:10] there'd be wildfires
[1:26:11] everywhere. It's a it's a fine fine
[1:26:14] balance. And then the rest of it, most
[1:26:16] of it is nitrogen, which is an inert
[1:26:17] gas. It doesn't affect anything. But
[1:26:20] oxygen is is a is a really uh it's a
[1:26:24] pretty ferocious gas, but it just
[1:26:26] happens to suit us for us breathing and
[1:26:28] so forth. It'll do a lot of damage if we
[1:26:31] had too much of it. All right, there's a
[1:26:34] couple more things if you bear with me
[1:26:35] because I I find it interesting. The the
[1:26:38] the spin speed of the Earth, you know,
[1:26:40] you think, how does that just happen?
[1:26:42] You know, we're we're doing 1,000 mph at
[1:26:44] the equator, so 24,000 mi round, so we
[1:26:48] go around in 24 24 hours. But if the
[1:26:51] spin speed of the Earth just happened to
[1:26:54] be 10% faster, we'd have wind speeds up
[1:26:58] to 400 kilometers an hour. That's bad.
[1:27:00] Just by the way, it's that's not good.
[1:27:03] 400 km an hour. And if the spin speed
[1:27:07] happened to be 10% slower, we'd go to
[1:27:10] 60° in the daytime and -50° at night.
[1:27:15] They're both bad. Okay. So, so the the
[1:27:18] balance of everything and and you you
[1:27:22] could go on, you know, a scientist could
[1:27:23] could tell you these things for forever
[1:27:25] in a day. The the amazing
[1:27:29] coincidence that just happened to be the
[1:27:31] right the right balance for us to be
[1:27:33] here.
[1:27:35] Amen. So, that's why we're happy to say,
[1:27:38] "Thank you, Lord. You do do all things
[1:27:40] well." Amen.
[1:27:43] And after you've got through all of
[1:27:45] that, then we get to life. And science
[1:27:47] has no idea what life is. They say they
[1:27:49] they know what life does. They've got a
[1:27:51] definition of life, but life's not
[1:27:53] actually in this physical realm. So they
[1:27:56] cannot when somebody uh when when
[1:27:58] somebody dies, the body is still
[1:28:00] absolutely
[1:28:02] complete. But there's something missing.
[1:28:04] That's the spirit of life. Amen. It's
[1:28:07] the spirit of life. It's in a different
[1:28:09] dimension than what we're looking. So
[1:28:10] science can't explain what life is. They
[1:28:13] can't explain where life come from. and
[1:28:14] they can't explain certainly can't
[1:28:16] explain the purpose of life. They can
[1:28:18] just look at some of the biology and say
[1:28:21] we breathe air and we have chemical
[1:28:22] reactions and so forth and that keeps us
[1:28:24] ticking
[1:28:25] along. But and and they do that by
[1:28:28] what's really called reverse
[1:28:29] engineering. You know when you take
[1:28:31] reverse engineering is when you take
[1:28:33] something that somebody else has made
[1:28:34] and maybe like this piano here and you
[1:28:36] pull it all to bits. Oh, that's how it
[1:28:38] works. But it doesn't mean you're the
[1:28:40] designer. It means you are pulling it to
[1:28:42] bit somebody else's design and just
[1:28:44] working out how it works. And that's
[1:28:45] exactly what we do and what what science
[1:28:47] has done with biology. We work out how
[1:28:50] it works. But actually the the mind that
[1:28:53] was behind it that created it, we can't
[1:28:56] understand. We can't understand it from
[1:28:58] that point of view. And David just said
[1:29:01] in the Psalms, he said, "I will praise
[1:29:02] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[1:29:04] made." That just sums it up. That's
[1:29:06] that's the way to say it. We can't
[1:29:08] understand it. Marvelous are thy works,
[1:29:10] and that my soul knoweth right
[1:29:12] well. Amen. All right. You know, when
[1:29:16] you're trying to decipher anything,
[1:29:18] particularly like from a scientific
[1:29:19] point of view, you're trying to analyze
[1:29:21] something, they talk about the five W's
[1:29:23] and the H. That's the who, what, where,
[1:29:27] uh when, why, and how. So, you have to
[1:29:30] go through all those different things
[1:29:31] and and um we won't go into too much
[1:29:34] detail, but if you miss out one of
[1:29:37] those, let's say you miss out the who I
[1:29:41] could tell you a story. There was uh
[1:29:44] somebody once and you know they they
[1:29:46] went to
[1:29:48] uh maybe he worked for
[1:29:51] NASA 1969. When 1969, where did he go?
[1:29:55] He went to the moon. And why did he go?
[1:29:58] He went for science. He went for because
[1:30:00] of the space race. How did he get there?
[1:30:02] He went in a Saturn 5 rocket. The story
[1:30:05] is not very satisfying, is it? Because
[1:30:08] you say who? It's just like who. The the
[1:30:11] who bit is missing. And you have all the
[1:30:13] other details, but without the who. It
[1:30:16] could be Neil Armstrong. It could be
[1:30:19] Buzz Uldren. It could be Michael
[1:30:21] Collins. But we want the who. And the
[1:30:24] thing is in science when they're looking
[1:30:25] at things they analyze everything they
[1:30:28] it's it's the who that they don't want
[1:30:30] to talk about. That's right. And if you
[1:30:32] don't have the who, you don't have the
[1:30:34] why.
[1:30:37] Because what's the purpose if you don't
[1:30:38] know who?
[1:30:40] See, that's the way it is. So, you know,
[1:30:42] people want answers. The whole world's
[1:30:44] looking for answers. They want world
[1:30:45] peace. What's the answer to world peace?
[1:30:48] What's the answer to controlling climate
[1:30:49] change? What's the answer to financial
[1:30:51] stability and equity? What what's the
[1:30:54] answer to these things? What's the
[1:30:55] answer to the cure for all of diseases
[1:30:58] or the big questions? Where did we come
[1:31:00] from? Why are we here? And where are we
[1:31:04] going? But without the
[1:31:06] who? If you don't know him, none of
[1:31:09] those questions make any sense. He is
[1:31:12] the answer to all of those questions.
[1:31:15] Amen. And we know brother Brennham, he
[1:31:17] brings out a lot that God is in his
[1:31:20] word. That's the place that he is
[1:31:22] determined that we can find him. Amen.
[1:31:25] We can't comprehend him by uh natural
[1:31:27] understanding or working him out, but
[1:31:30] God is in his word. And sometimes we
[1:31:32] forget that the same word that we're
[1:31:34] reading, the same word that we're
[1:31:37] hearing is the word of God that created
[1:31:40] absolutely everything. He said, "Let
[1:31:42] there be." And there was
[1:31:46] let there be light. And there was light.
[1:31:48] Let there be the sun, the moon, the
[1:31:50] stars. His His word just spoke that and
[1:31:53] it made it come to pass. But his word is
[1:31:55] the it's the same word that he says, I'm
[1:31:58] going to have a bride without spot or
[1:32:00] wrinkle. It's the creative power of
[1:32:03] almighty God. He says, "I'm going to
[1:32:05] send you Elijah the prophet." It's the
[1:32:08] same It's the same one. It's the same
[1:32:11] one doing the speaking. Amen. It has the
[1:32:13] same creative power. It has the same
[1:32:15] transforming power. Amen. It changes
[1:32:18] something from darkness to light.
[1:32:21] Amen. But you know, when he was alone,
[1:32:24] I'll just read a scripture here. He
[1:32:25] says,
[1:32:29] uh, Hebrews 1:3 says, "Who being in the
[1:32:32] brightness of his glory and the
[1:32:34] expressed image of his person and
[1:32:36] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:32:38] power." This is the power of his word,
[1:32:40] the word of his power. when he had by
[1:32:42] himself purged our sins, sat down on the
[1:32:44] right hand of the majesty on high. Amen.
[1:32:48] The purpose of him coming to reveal
[1:32:50] himself is that by his word is that it
[1:32:52] might transform us into the image of
[1:32:56] himself. In fact, that scripture that we
[1:32:58] read here, if I read on another couple
[1:33:00] of verses out of Romans, it said, "I
[1:33:02] beseech you therefore, brethren, that
[1:33:03] you by the mercies of God that you
[1:33:05] present your bodies a living sacrifice,
[1:33:07] holy acceptable unto God, which is your
[1:33:09] reasonable service." just saying that's
[1:33:11] just that's just reasonable. Nothing
[1:33:12] great there yet. But be not conformed to
[1:33:14] this world, but be ye
[1:33:17] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:33:20] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:33:22] acceptable and perfect will of God. He
[1:33:25] wants to change us. He wants to
[1:33:26] transform us. Even our thinking, he
[1:33:29] wants to transform just from we think in
[1:33:31] natural terms. He's no that's not good
[1:33:33] enough. You have to think in my terms.
[1:33:35] He's he's he's wanting to raise us up to
[1:33:38] think as he thinks. Amen. Now, back in
[1:33:42] the beginning when he was alone with his
[1:33:44] thoughts, he was thinking. But what was
[1:33:47] he
[1:33:51] thinking? Many times, and I don't know,
[1:33:53] you probably do this. I do this. Even if
[1:33:55] I wake up in the middle of the night and
[1:33:56] I've got something that I'm wanting to
[1:33:57] do, something I'm wanting to build or
[1:33:59] design, I'll sit there and I'll think
[1:34:00] and think and think think. And if you go
[1:34:02] over it in enough detail, you can work
[1:34:04] something out just by thinking. You
[1:34:06] haven't actually done anything yet. You
[1:34:08] haven't gone to your workshop. You
[1:34:09] haven't picked up any tools, but you've
[1:34:11] you've thought about it and you worked
[1:34:12] it out how it works. But you know what?
[1:34:15] God couldn't do
[1:34:17] that. He's thinking, but he couldn't do
[1:34:20] that. The reason he couldn't do that is
[1:34:22] because he already knows all
[1:34:24] things. There's nothing he could think
[1:34:27] about and think, "Oh, I've I've worked
[1:34:30] out how to make stars now." No, he knew
[1:34:32] how to make
[1:34:33] stars, but he was
[1:34:39] thinking he's infinite. He's omnisient.
[1:34:42] Means he knows all
[1:34:44] things. The universe is going to make.
[1:34:47] Now, science says that the universe is
[1:34:49] 93 billion light years
[1:34:53] across. Now, I don't know that they've
[1:34:55] got that right, but that still sounds
[1:34:56] big.
[1:34:58] 93 billion light years. And a lightyear
[1:35:01] is equivalent to 9 trill 9 trillion
[1:35:05] kilometers. So every it's a measure of
[1:35:07] distance rather than time. A year it's
[1:35:09] how far light travels in a year. Travels
[1:35:12] 9 trillion kilometers in a year. Then
[1:35:14] you take that by 93 billion times.
[1:35:17] That's how big the the universe they say
[1:35:20] it is. Okay. With all the stars that we
[1:35:23] talked about before. So that that's how
[1:35:26] that's how massive this universe is. And
[1:35:30] he wasn't thinking about
[1:35:31] that cuz Elohim just like I know how to
[1:35:35] do that. You know the things are so far
[1:35:38] away now in the universe that if you
[1:35:40] traveled at the speed of light you'd
[1:35:41] never get to them. They're actually
[1:35:43] moving away from us faster than the
[1:35:46] speed of light. You there's things that
[1:35:48] are out of reach, but they're not out of
[1:35:50] reach to him because the speed of light
[1:35:52] is not limiting to him.
[1:35:55] He's watching them, calling them by
[1:35:57] name. You're okay over
[1:35:59] there? Long way. He's the master of
[1:36:02] extremes. He makes big things and he
[1:36:05] makes minute
[1:36:07] things. Galaxies and supernovas and
[1:36:12] nebulas and black holes, the massive
[1:36:16] things that he makes. But you know to
[1:36:18] make all those first he had to make
[1:36:21] electrons and quarks and lips and all
[1:36:26] the tiny tiny tiny little subatomic
[1:36:29] particles. In fact an electron is so
[1:36:32] small that if you if you enlarged it 150
[1:36:36] billion times it would be the size of a
[1:36:39] small grain of rice.
[1:36:42] How do you make something that
[1:36:44] small? and everything relies on them.
[1:36:49] Wow. He is incredible. He is awesome.
[1:36:54] But he didn't have to think about that.
[1:36:56] He knew how to do that.
[1:37:00] What was on his mind was you and me.
[1:37:04] You and me. Because he couldn't just
[1:37:07] make us love him.
[1:37:11] That's right. He couldn't just make us
[1:37:13] like robots. you will love me.
[1:37:17] That's He had to give us a choice.
[1:37:20] He had to give us a choice and say, "I
[1:37:23] will I will give them my love. I will
[1:37:25] give them my word. And th those that
[1:37:28] love me, they will receive my word. They
[1:37:30] will believe me. They will believe who I
[1:37:32] send to them with my
[1:37:35] word." And he couldn't wait.
[1:37:38] He played the tape
[1:37:41] forward and he saw these people they
[1:37:44] love me. These people they responded to
[1:37:48] my word in 2025 sitting in Teranaki
[1:37:51] these
[1:37:53] people and he looked forward and brother
[1:37:56] Brandham says by his fornowledge he
[1:37:58] could
[1:38:00] predestinate he looked forward in time
[1:38:02] and so that's what they they are it's
[1:38:04] their decision not my decision it's
[1:38:07] their decision what they're going to do
[1:38:09] with my word and he looked forward and
[1:38:12] he saw what you do you do with his word
[1:38:15] and he said That's my bride. I chose
[1:38:18] them. I choose them now. He said we were
[1:38:20] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:38:22] world. He looked forward in time. And
[1:38:24] that's what he was thinking about for
[1:38:26] billions of years. Perhaps he was
[1:38:28] enjoying the
[1:38:30] moment. I'm going to have a bride that
[1:38:33] loves me, somebody like
[1:38:37] me, a mutual love
[1:38:41] relationship. Wow.
[1:38:43] The Bible says that God is love, but he
[1:38:46] needed a recipient for his love.
[1:38:48] Somebody who would receive his love. A
[1:38:50] one-way love relationship is not a love
[1:38:52] relationship. It had to be somebody that
[1:38:55] was going to respond back. That's what
[1:38:58] he was thinking of. Amen. And the Smyrna
[1:39:02] church age, brother says, "Watch
[1:39:03] carefully now and see this. Before there
[1:39:05] was even a speck of
[1:39:09] stardust and he was known only as the
[1:39:12] eternal spirit, the bride was already in
[1:39:14] his mind. Yes, she was. She existed in
[1:39:17] his thoughts. And what about those
[1:39:19] thoughts of God? They are eternal, are
[1:39:21] they not? God is infinite in his his
[1:39:23] abil in his abilities. So therefore, he
[1:39:26] is God must be omnisient. And if he's
[1:39:29] omnisient, then he then he's not
[1:39:32] learning. He's not now learning, nor is
[1:39:35] he taking counsel even with himself. Nor
[1:39:38] is he at any time adding to his
[1:39:41] knowledge. He's omnisient. He's never
[1:39:43] had a new thought about anything. So
[1:39:47] that's why I'm telling you, he wasn't
[1:39:48] thinking, "Oh, how am I going to No, he
[1:39:52] knew because all of his thoughts he has
[1:39:55] always had and always will have and
[1:39:57] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:39:59] he's God. Thus the thoughts of God are
[1:40:02] eternal. They are real. And in Jeremiah
[1:40:05] 29:11 it says the Lord speaking says,
[1:40:09] "For I know the thoughts that I think
[1:40:11] towards you, sayith the Lord, thoughts
[1:40:13] of peacemen and not of evil to give you
[1:40:16] an expected end." What's an expected
[1:40:19] end? It's called
[1:40:21] predestination. Predetermined
[1:40:24] destination is an expected end. He has
[1:40:27] said before time you're going to be
[1:40:30] there. And to me it's like that means
[1:40:33] everything.
[1:40:35] That means everything. Praise the
[1:40:40] Lord. So yeah, he couldn't just he
[1:40:43] couldn't force the choice on us. He had
[1:40:45] to allow us to have a choice. But now
[1:40:48] the problem with having a choice, for
[1:40:50] his bride to have a choice, he had to
[1:40:52] open up the spectrum of choice that
[1:40:54] everybody has a choice.
[1:40:57] Because before he looked forward in
[1:41:00] time, he wouldn't he didn't know who was
[1:41:02] going to choose him and who wasn't
[1:41:04] before he
[1:41:06] looked. So he opens up the choice.
[1:41:08] Everybody, you can either choose the
[1:41:10] Lord or
[1:41:11] not. And because God is everything that
[1:41:14] is good and everything that is lovely
[1:41:16] and everything that is
[1:41:18] perfect, you don't have a choice until
[1:41:20] he makes something else which is not
[1:41:22] perfect and which is not
[1:41:25] good and which is not lovely and which
[1:41:28] is not
[1:41:30] honest. And he
[1:41:32] says I create evil. I form the light. I
[1:41:36] create darkness. I make peace and I
[1:41:39] create I create evil. I the Lord do all
[1:41:42] these things. People say, why did the
[1:41:45] Lord let Satan even exist? Why did why
[1:41:48] did the Lord let Lucifer create him in
[1:41:51] the first place knowing that he lifted
[1:41:53] up in pride and he'd become an enemy to
[1:41:56] God? Why would you create him? I need
[1:41:59] him. I need him. I need to give them a
[1:42:02] choice so they can say, "No, I don't
[1:42:04] want to go that way. I love the Lord. I
[1:42:07] want to go that way." That's why he had
[1:42:09] opened it up. So then there's going to
[1:42:11] be millions of people, billions of
[1:42:13] people that go the wrong way. He said,
[1:42:15] "I had to let that happen. I have to let
[1:42:18] that happen because otherwise they don't
[1:42:20] have a real free moral agency choice."
[1:42:23] Amen. And that's why it is the way that
[1:42:25] it is. All right. Now, in him, Brother
[1:42:29] Brandham tells us, he had many
[1:42:30] attributes that he wanted to be
[1:42:32] displayed. He wanted to be a father. He
[1:42:34] wanted to be a son. He wanted to be an
[1:42:36] overcomer so he could be an example to
[1:42:38] us. He wanted to be a savior. He wanted
[1:42:39] to be a healer. He wanted to be a
[1:42:40] comforter, a husband. He wanted to be
[1:42:42] one of many brethren. He wanted to be a
[1:42:44] king, the king. He wanted to be a judge.
[1:42:46] Amen. All those things that were in him,
[1:42:49] those attributes were in him. They
[1:42:51] needed the theater of a of a conflict to
[1:42:54] bring them
[1:42:56] out. He He couldn't do that in heaven.
[1:42:59] He had to say, "There has to be a
[1:43:01] battle." Brother says, "The greatest
[1:43:03] battle ever fought is in the human
[1:43:04] mind." He had to have a battle scene
[1:43:07] where this war could be fought so that
[1:43:10] there could be an overcomer. How can you
[1:43:12] overcome if there's nothing to overcome?
[1:43:14] So that you could have a choice. All
[1:43:16] these different things. It required this
[1:43:18] theater of conflict as I said to be that
[1:43:21] way. But he also said, "I know that man
[1:43:24] is
[1:43:26] frail. We're just we we're compassed
[1:43:30] with infirmity." The Bible says in Psalm
[1:43:32] 103:13, it says, "Like as a father, he
[1:43:35] pityth his
[1:43:36] children. So the Lord pityth them that
[1:43:39] fear him, for he knoweth our frame, and
[1:43:41] remembereth that we are
[1:43:43] dust."
[1:43:46] H Yeah. You know, he knew from the
[1:43:50] beginning that um there wasn't actually
[1:43:52] going to be anybody, nobody on the face
[1:43:54] of the earth was actually going to be
[1:43:55] able to be the
[1:43:56] deliverer. He's going to have to come
[1:43:58] himself.
[1:43:59] He's like, "They're all frail. They're
[1:44:03] all compassed with
[1:44:05] infirmity." Says, "If they if I make
[1:44:07] this choice, they're they're going to do
[1:44:10] wrong. They're going to be born in sin.
[1:44:11] In fact, it's going to start wrong. So,
[1:44:14] there's going to have to be somebody
[1:44:15] come to deliver them." And he says, "And
[1:44:18] that's going to have to be
[1:44:20] me." Isaiah 59:16, he says, "And he saw
[1:44:23] that there was no man and wondered that
[1:44:26] there was no intercessor. Therefore, his
[1:44:28] arm brought salvation unto him, and his
[1:44:31] righteousness it sustained him. For he
[1:44:33] put on righteousness as a breastplate,
[1:44:35] and the helmet of salvation upon his
[1:44:36] head, and he put on the garments of
[1:44:38] vengeance for clothing, and was claded
[1:44:40] with zeal as a
[1:44:42] cloak. According to their deeds,
[1:44:44] accordingly, he will repay fury to his
[1:44:46] adversaries, recompense to his enemies.
[1:44:49] To the islands, he will repay
[1:44:50] recompense. So shall they fear the name
[1:44:52] of the Lord from the west, and his glory
[1:44:54] from the rising of the sun. When the
[1:44:56] enemy shall come in like a flood, the
[1:44:58] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:45:00] standard against him. Amen. And that's
[1:45:02] us, him in us. Amen. So down through
[1:45:07] time, the Lord has appeared on the scene
[1:45:09] many different ways. And brother Benham
[1:45:11] says,
[1:45:13] uh, it's a drama to him.
[1:45:16] It's a drama. He said that's the same
[1:45:20] God all the time just changing his form,
[1:45:23] amorphe. He just changed it. It's a
[1:45:26] great drama to him. He's acting it out.
[1:45:29] Why? He He's He's fulfilling all these
[1:45:31] attributes that were in him, but he's
[1:45:33] just playing the part out. And while
[1:45:36] he's doing that, he's calling his bride.
[1:45:39] He's calling his
[1:45:40] people. You know, when he shows up to
[1:45:42] Abraham as just a dusty
[1:45:46] traveler, he's like, he'll know it's me.
[1:45:51] He's just acting apart. That's right.
[1:45:54] But Abraham says, "My Lord."
[1:45:57] Why? It was revealed to him. Maybe it
[1:46:00] was something he said like everybody
[1:46:02] else was saying, "How are you doing,
[1:46:03] Abram?" And this dusty traveler comes
[1:46:06] along and said, "Abraham."
[1:46:10] Oh, I've come to fulfill my promise for
[1:46:14] you and Sarah. Sarah. No one calls her
[1:46:17] Sarah.
[1:46:18] Something he said quicken. Yeah. Isn't
[1:46:23] that what happened to us? Something he
[1:46:25] said quicken and that's why we're here.
[1:46:29] Amen. All along the way, it's a drama to
[1:46:31] him. He's playing it out. Wow. But you
[1:46:35] know, he said the hardest thing that he
[1:46:37] ever had to do was to get one ma one
[1:46:40] mortal to believe
[1:46:41] another. Man is God's agent. And the
[1:46:45] hardest thing that God ever had to do,
[1:46:46] you think this is the creator of heaven
[1:46:47] and earth. He's done some pretty tricky
[1:46:49] things. We've talked about that. The
[1:46:51] hardest thing he ever had to do was to
[1:46:53] get one mortal to believe another. When
[1:46:56] he sends his word, can I really believe
[1:46:58] him? Can I really believe this prophet
[1:47:00] that he sent in this day? The bride's
[1:47:03] going to say, "Yes." Amen. And that's
[1:47:06] really what faith is. Without faith,
[1:47:08] it's impossible to please him. For he
[1:47:10] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:47:11] is, and that he's a rewarder of them
[1:47:13] that diligently seek him. It's faith in
[1:47:16] the word of the hour that's all
[1:47:19] important because we have a gene seed
[1:47:21] inside of us and that gene seed has to
[1:47:23] be quickened by something. It can't be
[1:47:25] quickened by our understanding of the
[1:47:27] natural world and the phenomena of his
[1:47:29] creation. It it is amazing and the more
[1:47:31] you look at I love it. But that doesn't
[1:47:34] quicken the gene se understanding if we
[1:47:37] could study psychology and understand
[1:47:39] how we think and how we work and in the
[1:47:42] human sense you won't find them.
[1:47:45] But faith in the word of the hour is
[1:47:47] what quickens the gene seed. Oh, I
[1:47:50] believe in Jesus. Yeah. But if they
[1:47:51] believe in Jesus, they'll receive Jesus
[1:47:53] the word of the hour. Amen. Because if
[1:47:55] somebody says they believe in Jesus and
[1:47:57] reject the message, they don't know him.
[1:47:59] It's no different than Satan talking to
[1:48:01] God, but he doesn't know him. Yeah. We
[1:48:05] need to know him. He's the living God.
[1:48:08] He's the word for the hour. Amen. And
[1:48:11] then you know when we accept that that's
[1:48:13] when the seals are broken to us
[1:48:14] personally that's when the veil is
[1:48:16] removed and we really h we we come into
[1:48:19] communion with him because to to the
[1:48:22] rest of the world even the Christian
[1:48:24] world he's still not known they don't
[1:48:27] even know that he's not three people
[1:48:30] most of them they think he's three
[1:48:32] people but he's the one Jehovah God who
[1:48:36] we know is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:48:39] And he reveals himself to us. He reveals
[1:48:42] himself to his elect, the bride. And
[1:48:45] then there's going to be the 144,000
[1:48:47] Jews also. They're going to know him as
[1:48:49] he really is.
[1:48:52] Amen. But by his design, revelation is
[1:48:56] the only way that a mortal can come to
[1:48:58] know him. Revelation, the revelation of
[1:49:01] the word for our day. Every other way,
[1:49:04] we're never ever going to match up to
[1:49:05] the infinite mind of Almighty God. Now,
[1:49:09] sometimes we think, you know, we go
[1:49:10] through battles in our in our daily
[1:49:12] lives as humans. We feel pretty
[1:49:14] inadequate most of the time. Um, we're
[1:49:18] often disappointed and maybe we let the
[1:49:20] devil even disappoint us and discourage
[1:49:21] us because of our inability, our our
[1:49:26] maybe a lack of commitment or whatever
[1:49:27] it is. Sometimes we just we just
[1:49:30] feel we don't feel like eternal
[1:49:33] creatures.
[1:49:35] We don't feel like kind of his kind.
[1:49:39] You know what? He designed it that way.
[1:49:42] So don't be too surprised. He designed
[1:49:44] it that way. And I'm going to tell you
[1:49:46] in a little while while Jesus didn't
[1:49:48] feel any
[1:49:49] different. Jesus himself felt like you
[1:49:53] and I feel. He felt just
[1:49:56] human. Okay. I'm going to have to
[1:49:58] convince you on that, but we'll see it
[1:49:59] in a minute. Okay. So, we're limited in
[1:50:02] our understanding. We're limited. Our
[1:50:04] cognitive ability is is strictly finite.
[1:50:08] You know, we can try if we if we might
[1:50:11] to understand what everlasting life was
[1:50:14] like. Maybe for Adam, he had everlasting
[1:50:16] life where every day was just the same.
[1:50:18] He was not getting older. It was just a
[1:50:21] paradise. That was great. That's that's
[1:50:22] everlasting. We can kind of get a little
[1:50:24] bit of a grasp on that. But eternal
[1:50:26] terms, we just cannot
[1:50:28] grasp. God is eternal. He never had a
[1:50:32] beginning and he never has an end. Can
[1:50:34] you understand that? Uh we can't think
[1:50:37] in those terms and he knows we can't
[1:50:39] think in those terms but that's actually
[1:50:41] who he is. So he has limited their
[1:50:46] understanding. Um you know God who is
[1:50:50] unlimited he he he never has a situation
[1:50:52] which is too complex for him to
[1:50:55] understand. Never. He never has a
[1:50:58] situation where there's too many things
[1:50:59] happening at once. You know, we don't
[1:51:01] have to say, "Okay, look, maybe just
[1:51:03] this half of the church pray and when
[1:51:05] you're finished, we'll let this half of
[1:51:06] the church pray just so that doesn't
[1:51:08] overwhelm the
[1:51:10] Lord." It's just not so. Everybody can
[1:51:14] be praying at the same time and he can
[1:51:16] hear. He you can never you can never
[1:51:19] over complicate a situation to where he
[1:51:21] can't understand it. Okay? Because his
[1:51:23] mind is infinite. But our mind is not
[1:51:26] infinite and we we've arrived here in an
[1:51:30] impaired
[1:51:33] form. You know, when we get to uh if we
[1:51:36] would come in our theophony form, if we
[1:51:37] come in a glorified body form, we would
[1:51:40] never be tempted by sin because you just
[1:51:44] you just know as God knows. But he says
[1:51:46] the only way I can let you come here and
[1:51:49] be tempted and it's actually his word
[1:51:51] that's being on trial. It's his word
[1:51:53] that's on trial, not us. That's true.
[1:51:57] Yeah. We're his workmanship.
[1:52:00] So, so at the end, he's going to take
[1:52:03] the
[1:52:03] credit, not
[1:52:05] you. He's going to say, "This is my
[1:52:08] greatest victory,
[1:52:10] my bride." So, we're his workmanship.
[1:52:13] That's what he's doing. But he had to
[1:52:15] put us here with a lack of
[1:52:17] understanding, a lot lack of
[1:52:18] comprehension. I was reading in the
[1:52:19] scripture in Job, I think it's Elhoo,
[1:52:21] and he talks about the ostrich and he
[1:52:23] says, he says uh uh God hath deprived
[1:52:26] her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted
[1:52:29] to her understanding. Ostrich, it's like
[1:52:32] he's done a bit of that for us. You
[1:52:34] know, he's withheld understanding from
[1:52:37] us. And we can't nut it out. So, so
[1:52:39] let's not try and do it that way because
[1:52:41] we'll never find him that way. I
[1:52:43] remember brother Perry Green talking
[1:52:45] about brother Brandham he used to reload
[1:52:47] um hand load shells, rifle shells and he
[1:52:50] had a set of balance scales and they
[1:52:52] were so accurate you could put he put a
[1:52:54] piece of paper on each side of the
[1:52:56] scales and it would balance and then he
[1:52:58] took one piece of paper and he drew a
[1:52:59] pen mark on it and he put that back on
[1:53:01] the paper and he called that pen mark a
[1:53:03] scratch. Put it back on the scales and
[1:53:05] the scales would go down. It was so it
[1:53:08] was actually weighing the ink on that
[1:53:10] piece of paper. But I I was just
[1:53:12] thinking about that thinking our
[1:53:13] understanding naturally is like that
[1:53:16] scratch compared to the other side the
[1:53:18] weight of the entire universe God's
[1:53:20] understanding cuz he he the universe is
[1:53:23] just his understanding spoken forth. So
[1:53:26] so we're never going to we're never
[1:53:28] going to get them worked out like that.
[1:53:30] Amen. Um the Bible
[1:53:34] says about us and our understanding it
[1:53:37] does not yet appear what we shall be.
[1:53:40] What we are now is not actually who we
[1:53:41] are. Beloved, now are we the sons of
[1:53:44] God. Not we're going to be the sons of
[1:53:45] God. Now are we the sons of God. But it
[1:53:47] does not yet appear what we shall be.
[1:53:50] But we know that when he shall appear,
[1:53:52] we shall be like him. For we shall see
[1:53:55] him as he is. We're going to be like
[1:53:57] him. He's going to say, "Come up, stand
[1:54:01] by my
[1:54:02] side. Let's rule and reign together."
[1:54:06] The Bible says that we are joint ears
[1:54:09] with Christ. That's that's equal joint
[1:54:13] ears. Amen. Praise the Lord. Takes a bit
[1:54:16] of getting our our head around that.
[1:54:19] Now, when Jesus was here, I said that he
[1:54:21] felt the same way we do. The Bible says
[1:54:23] Jesus wept. Brother Ram takes it a step
[1:54:25] further. He said of all the human
[1:54:26] emotions that he manifested the most
[1:54:29] when he appeared as the son of man was
[1:54:31] this one. He wept often.
[1:54:35] Yet behind that weeping and that sorrow,
[1:54:38] there was still God. That's right. He
[1:54:41] didn't feel like He didn't feel like
[1:54:43] God.
[1:54:44] He wept as a man. Just the anguish that
[1:54:47] he went through so many
[1:54:50] times at some point as he was growing up
[1:54:54] because he was just born as a baby. He
[1:54:57] didn't have he didn't have the
[1:54:59] understanding of Jehovah God as a child.
[1:55:02] He just was growing up. But at some
[1:55:05] point, the revelation struck him of who
[1:55:08] he was. The
[1:55:10] amnesia of humanity was broken away. And
[1:55:14] by the time he was 12, he knew. And he
[1:55:16] was disputing with the scribes and so
[1:55:18] forth, saying, "But why did David say,
[1:55:20] you know, whose son whose whose son is,
[1:55:23] you know, um is the Messiah or
[1:55:25] whatever?" And they said, "Oh, the son
[1:55:26] of David." And he said, "Why does David
[1:55:29] say, "The Lord said unto my Lord, sit
[1:55:31] there on my right hand until I make thy
[1:55:33] enemies their foottool. How could he be
[1:55:35] his son and be his Lord?" And they, "Oh,
[1:55:37] I don't know. Can't they can't work that
[1:55:38] out." So, he was he was questioning them
[1:55:42] about who he was because he knew who he
[1:55:44] was. But if you think of it like this,
[1:55:47] one day he had to look out the window
[1:55:49] and say,
[1:55:51] "Wow, I made all this.
[1:55:56] Yeah, that's who I am.
[1:56:00] Who I am. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I
[1:56:05] can see now who I am. We're part of him.
[1:56:08] Amen. But the amnesia gets broken away.
[1:56:11] You start to see actually where we come
[1:56:14] from, why are we here, and where we're
[1:56:17] going. The big questions that no one
[1:56:19] else knows. Praise the Lord. Some point
[1:56:23] that revelation came to him. But if you
[1:56:25] had asked him and said, "How did you
[1:56:29] create everything?" You know what he
[1:56:31] would have said? I don't know.
[1:56:35] Just by the spoken word. But I don't
[1:56:37] know.
[1:56:40] He would have seemed like an ordinary
[1:56:42] man to anybody else. The people of that
[1:56:44] day, brother Adam says, could not
[1:56:46] comprehend how him being a man could be
[1:56:49] God. How that an ordinary man without
[1:56:52] not even a forceful preacher he says the
[1:56:55] Bible said that his voice was not heard
[1:56:56] in the streets and there's no beauty
[1:56:58] that we should desire him. He could not
[1:57:00] present himself maybe as a minister or
[1:57:02] as an educated or smart as the smart
[1:57:05] could. In fact Jesus said the son can do
[1:57:08] nothing in
[1:57:10] himself. Son can do nothing in himself.
[1:57:12] He say I'm just I'm just like a man. But
[1:57:16] he
[1:57:18] wasn't. And yet the fullness of the
[1:57:21] Godhead bodily dwelt in
[1:57:23] Jesus once he was baptized with John.
[1:57:26] The fullness of the Godhead dwelt in
[1:57:28] Jesus and he felt just like a man.
[1:57:32] You know just out of this if if I was
[1:57:36] designing this now just this is I'm not
[1:57:37] trying to be sacriiggious here but just
[1:57:39] for a moment if a man was born again
[1:57:42] he'd be a
[1:57:43] superman. What? Nothing would get in his
[1:57:46] way. the spirit of almighty God in him.
[1:57:50] He would feel like a superman. He'd
[1:57:52] spring. He only need an hour's sleep at
[1:57:53] night. He would spring out of bed in the
[1:57:55] morning. He he he is empowered by
[1:57:58] almighty God. And yet we feel very
[1:58:03] human that we say, but we know from the
[1:58:07] word that we're born again of his
[1:58:12] spirit. What about Jesus? the fullness
[1:58:15] of the godhead bodily. Now, Peter,
[1:58:17] James, and John did have a preview of
[1:58:19] him on Mount Transfiguration, how he
[1:58:22] actually is, who he actually
[1:58:24] is, his Raymond Shawn, his face shone.
[1:58:28] He he was Jehovah God standing there.
[1:58:32] They had a preview. That's who he is.
[1:58:34] But most of the time, he had to be a
[1:58:36] man. Most of the time he had to go to
[1:58:39] work in a carpenter shop. Most of his
[1:58:42] life he had three and a half years
[1:58:44] ministry but up until then he was just a
[1:58:46] man.
[1:58:49] Wow. He didn't feel like God.
[1:58:54] So let's not be too surprised that we
[1:58:57] feel how we feel. Let's let don't let
[1:58:59] the devil burden you with that. That's
[1:59:01] we're just in this realm for a reason.
[1:59:04] We're limited like the ostrich in our
[1:59:06] understanding. But the word is where we
[1:59:10] can come and we can fellowship. We can
[1:59:12] feel his presence. We can we can get to
[1:59:15] know him. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:59:18] tells us that Jesus, you know, when he
[1:59:21] was going to go to the woman at the
[1:59:22] well, and brother Ram tells that story
[1:59:24] so many times about the woman at the
[1:59:26] well, but he says Jesus didn't know what
[1:59:28] her problem
[1:59:29] was. He said he'd seen a vision that he
[1:59:32] was to go there and he said, "I have
[1:59:33] need to go via Samaria." But he said,
[1:59:34] "But he didn't know." And he's walking
[1:59:37] that extra way around the hill to get to
[1:59:39] Samaria thinking I'm going to meet a
[1:59:41] woman at the well, but I don't know what
[1:59:42] her problem is. And brother Ram says,
[1:59:44] "You have to believe me on this." But he
[1:59:45] says, "But he had to talk to her to
[1:59:47] catch your spirit to find out what her
[1:59:49] problem was." And then he says, "Now go
[1:59:51] and get your husband to come here." And
[1:59:52] she said, "I got I haven't got a
[1:59:54] husband." He said, "Yeah, yeah, you've
[1:59:55] told the truth, but you've had five, and
[1:59:57] the one you're with now is not yours."
[1:59:58] See, because he talked to her as a
[2:00:01] prophet, that that spirit of discernment
[2:00:03] was there, and he could tell what it
[2:00:04] was. But beforehand if you asked him why
[2:00:06] do you need to go and see this talk to
[2:00:08] this woman he would have had to say I
[2:00:09] don't know and yet he was the fullness
[2:00:12] of the godhead bodily limited in that
[2:00:15] way when he was when he went up to
[2:00:17] Calvary and he was carrying his cross he
[2:00:19] didn't have the human strength to carry
[2:00:21] the cross cross and he collapsed and
[2:00:25] Simon Serene had to come and carry the
[2:00:26] cross you think that that's not how you
[2:00:29] would write the story you know Jesus
[2:00:32] little man like Samson
[2:00:34] No, it's not how it was. He gave that
[2:00:37] strength to somebody, but not to him. He
[2:00:40] gave that to
[2:00:41] Samson. Yeah. Amazing, isn't it?
[2:00:47] Yeah. When he was
[2:00:48] here, the Bible says that he did uh he
[2:00:52] did only that which pleased the father.
[2:00:56] Only that which pleased the father. He
[2:00:57] deferred his natural
[2:00:59] thinking to his eternal thinking to the
[2:01:03] infinite mind. He said, "Not my will but
[2:01:07] thine be done." You know, he prayed that
[2:01:09] prayer three times in the garden of of
[2:01:11] Gethsemane. Lord, if if father, if it be
[2:01:13] possible, let this cup pass from me, but
[2:01:16] not nevertheless, not my will, but thine
[2:01:19] be done. He said three
[2:01:22] times. But he he submitted
[2:01:25] himself to the infinite mind because
[2:01:28] there's there's a there's a greater
[2:01:30] purpose than what we can see from a
[2:01:32] human perspective. Amen. He gave
[2:01:34] preeminence to the infinite
[2:01:36] mind.
[2:01:39] Amen. The Bible says that uh he was
[2:01:42] tempted in all all points like us and he
[2:01:45] became an overcomer so that we could he
[2:01:48] could be an example to us. He had to die
[2:01:50] to make a way back for us. And then even
[2:01:52] when he did, he said he gave the keys to
[2:01:54] the kingdom to another man. It's Peter.
[2:01:58] And you know, if you're choosing a man
[2:01:59] to give the keys of the kingdom, too. It
[2:02:02] wouldn't have been
[2:02:03] Peter. He denied him. He kept doing the
[2:02:06] wrong thing. He cuts off somebody's ear.
[2:02:09] He just seemed to get it wrong all the
[2:02:11] time. The humanity was the biggest part
[2:02:13] of the picture.
[2:02:16] But come the day of Pentecost, he took
[2:02:18] those keys and he turned them and he
[2:02:21] said actually Jesus name is the only
[2:02:24] way. You must be baptized. Repent and be
[2:02:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:02:30] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:02:32] Ghost. Amen. And the promise unto you
[2:02:34] and as many as are coming from now on.
[2:02:38] Amen. He took those keys. He turned
[2:02:40] those keys. But as a man, you'd say,
[2:02:42] "Wow, I couldn't have chosen somebody
[2:02:44] else." But see, that's why I say it's
[2:02:48] his workmanship. We are his workmanship.
[2:02:50] He knows what he's doing. When Jesus
[2:02:53] died and he rose
[2:02:55] again, when when he was a man, he didn't
[2:02:58] know all things. But when he rose again
[2:03:00] and he went uh into glory, it was
[2:03:04] revealed to him then all things
[2:03:06] concerning
[2:03:07] himself from his eternal self. The
[2:03:11] eternal part of himself just just to say
[2:03:14] it like this. We are in three parts as I
[2:03:16] said before. We have a body, we have a
[2:03:17] spirit and we have a soul. The soul part
[2:03:20] is the eternal part of us. Brother Ron
[2:03:22] says you, the spirit of God, is a quote
[2:03:26] from him. you the spirit of God, the
[2:03:28] spirit of God is that is that soul
[2:03:31] realm. But
[2:03:34] um in in his humanity, he didn't know.
[2:03:37] But when he actually heard from that
[2:03:40] soul realm, which is the eternal part of
[2:03:42] himself, then he knew all things. I'll
[2:03:44] read it to you here from Revelation 1:1.
[2:03:47] It says, "The revelation of Jesus
[2:03:48] Christ, which God gave unto him."
[2:03:53] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[2:03:55] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[2:03:58] things which must shortly come to pass
[2:04:00] and he sent and signify it by his angel
[2:04:02] unto his servant John. Amen. He's
[2:04:06] telling us through the book of
[2:04:07] Revelation through the rest of scripture
[2:04:09] things that he didn't actually know
[2:04:10] himself when he was here. He didn't
[2:04:12] know. They said, "When are you coming
[2:04:13] again?" He said, "I don't
[2:04:15] know." He didn't know. That's right. He
[2:04:18] said, "Only the father knows." That's in
[2:04:20] the eternal mind. But in my human mind,
[2:04:22] I don't know. H after his resurrection,
[2:04:27] he said, "All power is given unto me in
[2:04:29] heaven and earth." And brother Brandham
[2:04:31] says, Jesus said, "All power in heaven
[2:04:33] and earth is given into my hands." He
[2:04:34] said, "All power then God is powerless
[2:04:37] if he's another person." I just love
[2:04:39] that he's bringing out who this the
[2:04:42] godhead. He said if if you've got three
[2:04:44] people, then if all power is given to
[2:04:46] Jesus, then God's powerless. But if he's
[2:04:49] the same one, then we have an
[2:04:51] understanding. Then we get to know him.
[2:04:53] Amen. God's powerless if he's another
[2:04:54] person. For the Bible says Jesus said
[2:04:57] after his resurrection that all power in
[2:04:59] heaven and earth both was given unto my
[2:05:02] hand.
[2:05:04] Amen. And Jesus is now is the all
[2:05:07] knowing father. That's who he is. That's
[2:05:09] where he's gone. He said, "I come from
[2:05:10] God and I return to God." And brother
[2:05:13] says like this here. He climbs so high
[2:05:15] into power and glory until he sits in on
[2:05:18] the father's throne and looks down.
[2:05:21] There's not even a sparrow can fall to
[2:05:23] the street without him knowing it.
[2:05:27] He knows how sick you are. He knows your
[2:05:30] doubts. He knows your frustrations.
[2:05:32] We're in a terrible storm, but don't be
[2:05:34] scared. There's somebody watching. Which
[2:05:36] one? Which one is watching? He says,
[2:05:38] "The one that broke the bread.
[2:05:41] The one that knowed Peter and called him
[2:05:43] by his name. The one that told the woman
[2:05:46] of her sins. The one that touched that
[2:05:48] the woman touched the hem of his garment
[2:05:50] and told her blood is stopped. The one
[2:05:53] who perceived the thoughts of the mind.
[2:05:55] He hasn't laid down in the grave. So you
[2:05:57] can't see him, but he's climbed into
[2:05:59] glory and he can see even the sparrow
[2:06:01] that falls in the street. Amen. So why
[2:06:04] does it say he sit on his father's
[2:06:06] throne? And later on it says he's going
[2:06:07] to sit on his own throne. And brother
[2:06:09] Ran brings it out. He's sitting on his
[2:06:10] father's throne. Now he says, "And
[2:06:13] tonight Christ is not sitting on his own
[2:06:15] throne. He's sitting on whose throne?"
[2:06:17] The father's throne. This I think it's
[2:06:19] important so that we understand who we
[2:06:21] are in love with. It's important that we
[2:06:24] understand the deity of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:28] Amen. He is the one true living God and
[2:06:31] he wants a bride who is like him to
[2:06:33] stand by his side. He wants us to know
[2:06:35] him. Amen. He's sitting on whose throne?
[2:06:37] The father's throne. and he has overcome
[2:06:39] and sit down. He said, and then he said,
[2:06:41] and he that overcomemeth shall sit with
[2:06:43] me on my throne as I overcame and I'm
[2:06:46] sitting down on my father's
[2:06:48] throne. He, brother Random says, uh, I'm
[2:06:51] trying to do God a service without that
[2:06:52] as well. His physical being was raised
[2:06:54] up to the throne of God where the spirit
[2:06:57] was on the throne. Now Christ is on the
[2:06:59] throne, Jesus. A little while the world
[2:07:01] seeth me no more, yet you shall see me,
[2:07:03] for I'll be with you even in you to the
[2:07:05] end of the world. Amen. The throne of
[2:07:08] God of Christ is erected in your
[2:07:12] heart. Where is the throne of God that
[2:07:14] Jesus sits on? The father's throne is in
[2:07:17] your heart. That's where he is. He says,
[2:07:19] "A little while the world won't see me
[2:07:21] anymore, but you'll see me. I'll be with
[2:07:22] you even in you." That's where he is.
[2:07:25] But there's coming a time where he's
[2:07:26] actually going to be in a physical body.
[2:07:29] He's going to be in a glorified body
[2:07:31] just like we're going to be. And he's
[2:07:32] going to sit on his own throne, not not
[2:07:35] just a spirit. He's here in spirit form
[2:07:38] now in us. That's the throne that he's
[2:07:40] sitting on right now. That's why when we
[2:07:42] pray, pray heavenly father. Brother
[2:07:45] says, when you say heavenly father, I'll
[2:07:46] read it to you. He said when you say
[2:07:48] heavenly father, he said that's Jesus.
[2:07:51] That's who we're praying to. Amen.
[2:07:54] Praise the Lord. But there's going to
[2:07:57] come a time where he's going to sit on
[2:07:58] his own throne. He's going to be in a
[2:08:00] glorified body. And he says he's going
[2:08:01] to be like that forever more. And we're
[2:08:04] going to be with him in glorified bodies
[2:08:06] forever more.
[2:08:08] Amen. You're all with us just a little
[2:08:10] bit longer. Amen. All
[2:08:13] right. Uh now he's sitting on his
[2:08:16] father's throne. In other words, he's
[2:08:17] getting he's sitting in God's power in
[2:08:20] spirit now. But when he comes back,
[2:08:22] he'll be he'll sit in an earthly body.
[2:08:24] Amen. On David's throne. He's sitting in
[2:08:27] the majesty of father. Now when we say
[2:08:30] father, it's Jesus. It's a spirit of God
[2:08:33] by the Holy Spirit in us. Now he's on
[2:08:36] the father's throne at the right hand of
[2:08:37] majesty. And we use the body name Jesus
[2:08:40] who appeared. The Holy Spirit which is
[2:08:43] God. Whenever you ask the father
[2:08:46] anything in my name that I'll do for I
[2:08:48] and my father are one. Amen. But there's
[2:08:51] coming a time he says he will return in
[2:08:54] his body again and he will sit on a
[2:08:56] literal throne. He says, "A man that
[2:08:59] will eat and drink and shake
[2:09:03] hands." Yeah, I love him.
[2:09:06] A man, that's how he wants to express
[2:09:08] himself. This Jehovah God who covers all
[2:09:10] space of all time. He wants to express
[2:09:12] himself. A man who can eat and drink and
[2:09:15] shake hands and fellowship with us. Oh
[2:09:18] my. He said, "You're too emotional,
[2:09:20] brother." He said, "Why? It makes you
[2:09:22] emotional. You can't hold yourself when
[2:09:24] you think of it." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:26] That's our God. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:29] And now, right now, it's his purpose
[2:09:31] that he would be and he would live in
[2:09:33] us. And he wants by his word to be
[2:09:36] transforming us into his thinking, into
[2:09:38] his way. Amen. That scripture we just
[2:09:41] read, be not uh confformed to the world,
[2:09:43] but be you transformed by the renewing
[2:09:45] of your
[2:09:46] mind. The prophet says here in the power
[2:09:49] of transformation, he says, now we have
[2:09:51] been saved. Now that we've been saved as
[2:09:54] we are, there's three parts to this.
[2:09:55] Listen, now that we've been saved as we
[2:09:58] are and we've been filled with the Holy
[2:10:00] Spirit as we have, now we want the mind
[2:10:04] of Christ to be in us. Amen. You think,
[2:10:08] well, you know, I've got the I've been
[2:10:10] saved and I've got the Holy Spirit. I've
[2:10:11] arrived. He says, no, no. He said he's
[2:10:14] wanting the mind of Christ now to be in
[2:10:17] you. He's wanting you to actually start
[2:10:18] to think as he thinks because now that
[2:10:20] you're actually saved and now that
[2:10:22] you're actually filled with the Holy
[2:10:23] Ghost, he says, "Now I'm saying come up
[2:10:25] hither
[2:10:26] and think how I think." Yeah. Yeah.
[2:10:29] That's what revelation is. Revelation is
[2:10:32] catching the mind, the infinite mind of
[2:10:35] God. Yeah. That's what it is. It's a
[2:10:38] revelation. In fact, I say to you even
[2:10:40] this on natural things in this life, you
[2:10:42] think, I don't know what to do. I can't
[2:10:44] work this out. uh tap in to the infinite
[2:10:48] mind.
[2:10:50] Say, Lord, you already know what's the
[2:10:54] best decision to make here. It it might
[2:10:57] it might be a big thing like buying a
[2:10:58] car or getting a job or marrying a wife
[2:11:01] or husband, whatever. Big things, but
[2:11:03] what about little things? The Bible says
[2:11:06] uh pray without ceasing.
[2:11:09] Do you know that means just just ask me?
[2:11:11] I'm waiting. Just ask me. Just talk to
[2:11:13] me about every little thing. Lord, what
[2:11:15] would you have me do here? What would
[2:11:16] you have me do here? He's interested. He
[2:11:19] is vitally interested. And so so many
[2:11:22] times we can miss the blessing because
[2:11:24] we're not actually in the right channel.
[2:11:26] Say, Lord, what would you have me to do?
[2:11:29] He wants he wants to to to reveal those
[2:11:33] things to us. That's what revelation is.
[2:11:35] In Job 32:8, it says, "There is a
[2:11:38] spirit, but there is a spirit in man,
[2:11:41] and the inspiration of the Almighty
[2:11:44] giveth them understanding." Praise the
[2:11:46] Lord. The inspiration of the Almighty,
[2:11:48] the revelation from him, it gives us
[2:11:50] understanding, understanding in his
[2:11:52] terms. Amen. And that's what we need.
[2:11:54] And faith, you know, is accepting the
[2:11:57] infinite mind on something above our
[2:12:00] natural thinking. That's what faith
[2:12:01] really is. He said, he said it. Okay,
[2:12:04] that settles it. I believe it. Just
[2:12:07] accept it that way. That's really what
[2:12:08] faith is. Let the mind, let this mind be
[2:12:11] in you, which was also in Christ
[2:12:13] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[2:12:16] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[2:12:18] God, but made himself of no reputation,
[2:12:20] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[2:12:23] and was made in the likeness of man. He
[2:12:25] says, "Let this mind be in you, which
[2:12:27] was also in Christ Jesus." And the mind
[2:12:30] that was in Christ Jesus was he didn't
[2:12:31] think it's robbery to say he's equal
[2:12:32] with God.
[2:12:34] He says, "You need to think like that."
[2:12:37] He said, "What? What are you saying? Are
[2:12:39] you saying that you're equal with God?
[2:12:41] That's what he said we are." That's
[2:12:43] right. So, we might as well say what he
[2:12:45] said. Joint ears with Christ. So, if
[2:12:49] we're saying something less than that,
[2:12:50] who's the influence to try and say less
[2:12:52] than that?
[2:12:54] It's not the Holy
[2:12:56] Spirit. He says, "You need to think how
[2:12:59] I
[2:13:01] think." That's right. Let this mind be
[2:13:03] in you. Praise the
[2:13:06] Lord. It's a position that he has placed
[2:13:09] us in. And to say any less is denying
[2:13:12] the position that he wants his bride to
[2:13:14] be in. Joint ears with him, sitting with
[2:13:17] him in his throne. The prophet says,
[2:13:19] "Oh, if the church only knew its
[2:13:22] position, it will one day."
[2:13:25] If the church only knew that position
[2:13:28] that he's chosen for the bride, but it
[2:13:30] will one day. I'm so glad he said that
[2:13:32] bit. Amen. It says we're walking into
[2:13:34] this where we're close to every day. It
[2:13:37] will one day and then the rapture will
[2:13:39] go when it knows what it is. So that
[2:13:42] should be our goal for everything. That
[2:13:44] should be our focus. We want to know who
[2:13:47] he who he has made
[2:13:49] us and who he is making us. And he's
[2:13:51] changing our thinking. We are kind of
[2:13:53] his kind. By his word, we're becoming
[2:13:56] all that he is because he cannot marry a
[2:14:00] different species.
[2:14:02] We have to be kind of his kind. Mrs.
[2:14:04] Jesus Christ is going to be like him.
[2:14:08] We have brother Brandham says his very
[2:14:11] potentials.
[2:14:13] You know the potentials. It means that
[2:14:16] if you've got the infinite God and
[2:14:17] you've got one spoonful of the infinite
[2:14:19] God, that's infinite.
[2:14:22] He says, "That's the potentials I've put
[2:14:24] in you." In fact, I haven't got it here,
[2:14:26] but brother Ram says, he says, "In you
[2:14:28] is the potentials." He says, "If the
[2:14:30] power that's in you is enough that you
[2:14:32] could speak a world into existence and
[2:14:34] go and live on it, if there wasn't a law
[2:14:35] that says you not to do that right
[2:14:37] now. That's the power that he is vested
[2:14:40] in his bride. The members of the virgin
[2:14:43] bride will love him. They will have his
[2:14:46] potentials for he is their head and all
[2:14:48] power belongs to him." And in the
[2:14:51] message it's the rising of the sun 1965
[2:14:53] he says she is flesh of his flesh. She
[2:14:57] is bone of his bone, life of his life,
[2:15:01] power of his power. She is him.
[2:15:05] Yeah. Husband and wife. Amen. We are the
[2:15:09] very thoughts, the eternal thoughts of
[2:15:11] God expressed. Amen. That's the way he
[2:15:15] was. This is who do you say this is?
[2:15:16] Just couple more quotes here and we're
[2:15:18] done. That's the way he was. He was in
[2:15:21] the beginning by himself. He dwelt alone
[2:15:23] with his thoughts. He'll never do that
[2:15:25] again cuz his thoughts are being made
[2:15:28] manifest. And that's why we're right
[2:15:30] here this day. God fellowshipping with
[2:15:32] his thoughts being made manifested.
[2:15:35] Amen. You know Jesus when he came out
[2:15:39] from God, he was not created. He was
[2:15:42] expressed. He was begotten.
[2:15:45] He God didn't, oh I need to have a son.
[2:15:48] and I will um create one. No, he didn't
[2:15:51] do that. He was an expression of God
[2:15:54] himself. He did create a body for him to
[2:15:57] dwell in out of the dust of the earth.
[2:16:01] And I think this is important for us to
[2:16:03] understand too or this is a blessing if
[2:16:04] we if we get this right. But when he
[2:16:06] made a body for him out of the earth, so
[2:16:09] he he he grew in the womb of Mary and
[2:16:11] she ate food and so forth that was taken
[2:16:13] from the earth. But what he was doing,
[2:16:15] he was identifying himself with his own
[2:16:18] creation. He was becoming a part of his
[2:16:21] own creation. He didn't create himself.
[2:16:24] He became part of his creation. And
[2:16:26] brother Brandham says he did that for a
[2:16:28] specific purpose that he would redeem
[2:16:31] the part of creation that was in him.
[2:16:33] And by doing that, he would redeem the
[2:16:35] whole earth. Amen.
[2:16:38] All right. Uh and he says, I'll read it
[2:16:39] to you so you get it. He said that's why
[2:16:42] uh death has reigned on the earth ever
[2:16:44] since the fall. Heaven and earth, beast,
[2:16:46] atmosphere is all cursed of God because
[2:16:48] of it. That's the curse because Satan
[2:16:50] got to it first. But he says Jesus came
[2:16:52] to redeem it back to the father. In
[2:16:53] order to do this, he became part of it.
[2:16:56] He says, uh, and from that very dust,
[2:16:59] the part that Jesus was himself, being
[2:17:02] redeemed through him, all the attributes
[2:17:04] of God are redeemed with the earth.
[2:17:07] Amen. Praise the Lord. So that's why he
[2:17:09] did it that way. So he could redeem
[2:17:11] that. He created the earth. Actually,
[2:17:13] this is where we're going to live. This
[2:17:14] is where eternity is going to be. We're
[2:17:16] going to live with him here on the face
[2:17:18] of this earth. But he had to come and
[2:17:19] redeem the very earth. He said, "Only
[2:17:21] way I can do it, I've got to become part
[2:17:22] of that earth." And exactly the same for
[2:17:26] us. We we are not uh created beings, but
[2:17:30] our bodies are But we're an expressed
[2:17:33] image of the very thought of God. That's
[2:17:36] what it is. We're as eternal as God is.
[2:17:39] Amen. The prophet says just that way.
[2:17:41] Well, that's who we are. We We need to
[2:17:43] grasp that. Amen. But our bodies are
[2:17:45] taken from the dust of the earth. And
[2:17:47] we've been in a limited form. Sure, we
[2:17:48] are. But the life quotient that is in
[2:17:51] us, the eternal life quotient that's in
[2:17:53] us is none other than the gene seed of
[2:17:55] God. Amen. And in us right now, there's
[2:17:58] attributes which you know when Adam
[2:18:00] first came here, uh he was just just
[2:18:04] Adam was by himself. And God says, "It's
[2:18:06] not good for you to be alone." And
[2:18:07] Adam's like, "Yeah, I know. I'll get
[2:18:09] that." And he says, "Uh, but the answer
[2:18:12] to Adam's loneliness was in him."
[2:18:15] That's right. And he expressed Eve from
[2:18:20] out the side of him. Amen. The
[2:18:22] attributes that had previously been in
[2:18:25] Adam were now in Eve. And I think I've
[2:18:27] said this here before, but you know when
[2:18:29] when Eve got a vase and put some flowers
[2:18:32] in it and Adam went, "That's
[2:18:36] nice. I never thought of doing
[2:18:40] that." It was in him, but until it was
[2:18:43] expressed
[2:18:45] in Eve, it couldn't be demonstrated.
[2:18:47] There's things that the Lord is seeing
[2:18:48] in his bride, he says, "I I long to see
[2:18:51] this. Yes, I long to see this being
[2:18:53] manifest because it was in me, but it
[2:18:56] had to be in female form before it can
[2:18:58] be expressed. And he's enjoying that.
[2:19:01] Amen. And for for all eternity, he'll
[2:19:04] say, "I'm so proud of what you did."
[2:19:08] That's true.
[2:19:10] So proud. You know, even the
[2:19:12] manifestation of the third Paul in this
[2:19:14] last day, brother Ramon says about the
[2:19:16] manifestation of the the five
[2:19:18] manifestations that we had. The whole
[2:19:21] purpose of that, he said it's going to
[2:19:23] be used. It's going to be used by the
[2:19:24] bride. But he said it was manifest to
[2:19:27] show that the spoken word which was from
[2:19:31] Jehovah God was actually being made made
[2:19:33] manifest and demonstrated through a
[2:19:35] sinner saved by grace. It was no longer
[2:19:37] just in Jehovah God. It was now in a
[2:19:39] sinner that was saved by grace. speaking
[2:19:41] the very words of creation, of control
[2:19:44] of nature, of all the different things
[2:19:46] that took place. Amen. That's what it
[2:19:48] was all about. Praise the Lord. The
[2:19:50] prophet says, "All that God was, he
[2:19:51] poured into Christ. And all that Christ
[2:19:53] was, he poured into the church." That's
[2:19:55] him. It's Christ in you. He says, "Oh,
[2:19:59] if I could get the world to see that,
[2:20:01] there you are. There's the body of
[2:20:03] Christ living standing redeemed.
[2:20:06] Redeemed. Oh my." He says, "Justified in
[2:20:08] his sight. Why are we justified?" He
[2:20:10] says, "We are his victory."
[2:20:14] Wow. We are his victory. We are what he
[2:20:18] was thinking about at the beginning. Oh
[2:20:22] yes. This is this is the greatest vic.
[2:20:24] The greatest work that Jehovah God ever
[2:20:27] has done. Amen. As his bride,
[2:20:32] he was Calvary was his greatest victory.
[2:20:34] No, Calvary, he bought something, but
[2:20:36] what he bought was you. That's right.
[2:20:39] Yeah.
[2:20:40] Amen. He saw something, think of this,
[2:20:44] in you. God saw something in you that
[2:20:46] you don't see in you. You know the story
[2:20:49] in Hosea? Hosea wound up buying his wife
[2:20:52] back.
[2:20:54] And she was a mess.
[2:20:57] And he bought her back. But from that
[2:20:59] time on, she understood something of his
[2:21:01] love that she didn't understand before.
[2:21:04] It's like she probably was proud
[2:21:07] beforehand. Something like that. She
[2:21:09] might have been fancy looking. She might
[2:21:11] have thought she was something. But by
[2:21:12] the time she got to the lowest of the
[2:21:14] low and that she was being sold as a
[2:21:16] slave,
[2:21:17] when he bought her back, he understood
[2:21:20] something of her love, of his love that
[2:21:22] she hadn't understood before. God seen
[2:21:25] something in you that you didn't see in
[2:21:27] yourself. And he says, "I predestinated
[2:21:30] you before the foundation of the world
[2:21:31] to this glorious stand." Amen. He had to
[2:21:35] redeem her.
[2:21:37] He had to have
[2:21:38] her. He would die to achieve
[2:21:42] it. He predestinated her because he knew
[2:21:45] that he she would believe him, that she
[2:21:47] would love him, and she would receive
[2:21:49] whomsoever he sent. Amen. And that's why
[2:21:52] he sent his word to transform you and
[2:21:54] transform me. It's the greatest work.
[2:21:56] It's his final victory. Amen. Death is
[2:21:59] swallowed up in victory. That says, the
[2:22:01] Bible says that's the final victory when
[2:22:03] death is swallowed up in victory. But
[2:22:04] when the bride walks
[2:22:08] out immortal,
[2:22:11] like him,
[2:22:13] he'll say, "This is it. This is the
[2:22:16] final victory. This is my greatest work
[2:22:18] I've ever done."
[2:22:21] Amen. And he will
[2:22:23] rejoice. The Bible says that he will
[2:22:25] rejoice over you with singing. Can you
[2:22:28] imagine that? That's what the Bible
[2:22:31] says. He will rejoice over her with
[2:22:33] singing.
[2:22:35] And in Jeremiah 33:16, it says, "In
[2:22:38] those days shall Judah be saved, and
[2:22:40] Jerusalem shall dwell safely. This is
[2:22:42] the name wherewith she shall be called,"
[2:22:44] speaking of the bride, "the lord our
[2:22:49] righteousness." The Lord Jesus, he will
[2:22:51] present to himself his virtuous bride
[2:22:53] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[2:22:55] thing. He's so in love with her, with
[2:22:59] you.
[2:23:01] He's so
[2:23:02] proud of
[2:23:06] you. He can't wait. But he has But he
[2:23:10] will wait. He looked before time. He
[2:23:12] because he couldn't wait. He had to look
[2:23:14] and see. Yep. She's going to be there.
[2:23:17] Yep. She's all that I wanted. She's all
[2:23:19] I had in my
[2:23:20] mind. The final victory. King and queen
[2:23:23] walk out together in the paradises of
[2:23:27] God. Amen. Then just two more quotes.
[2:23:31] Sorry. And uh he says uh this is good
[2:23:34] len church age. He says then we'll
[2:23:36] finally comprehend because here we're
[2:23:39] only comprehending partial
[2:23:40] understanding. But he says partial
[2:23:42] realization will be made perfect
[2:23:44] realization complete realization. We've
[2:23:47] been looking through a glass darkly but
[2:23:49] soon it'll be face to face. We've been
[2:23:51] go going from glory to glory but soon
[2:23:53] it'll be right in the glory. And in his
[2:23:56] glory, we'll shine because we shall be
[2:23:59] like him. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's
[2:24:03] what I want to be. I want to be all that
[2:24:05] he said for me to be. Amen. And I trust
[2:24:08] that it's encouragement to you, too,
[2:24:09] because don't don't look at the the
[2:24:11] frailties of the flesh. Don't look at
[2:24:13] the even the things that the thoughts,
[2:24:15] oh, you know, it's this is a hard day.
[2:24:17] He said, yeah, we're going through a
[2:24:18] storm. This is it's just we we live in
[2:24:21] the middle of a storm and it's going to
[2:24:22] get worse on the earth. It's going to
[2:24:24] get worse. But we're actually living in
[2:24:27] like a a little I like to think of like
[2:24:30] an
[2:24:31] oasis. We've got all that we need. Yeah.
[2:24:34] We've got we've got all the food we need
[2:24:36] through the message of the hour.
[2:24:39] We've got the long range vision to see
[2:24:41] where we wind up.
[2:24:44] He he he'll be here right on time. So,
[2:24:47] we don't have anything to worry about.
[2:24:48] And even like I said, you know, when we
[2:24:50] say heavenly father, he says that's
[2:24:52] Jesus. But he said he knows how sick you
[2:24:54] are. He knows what you're going through.
[2:24:56] He knows every detail. But just commit
[2:24:59] it to him. It's all going to pan out
[2:25:01] right. Amen. God bless you. Do you know?
[2:25:03] Do we know that song? Maybe we can
[2:25:04] stand. The musicians come sing the song.
[2:25:06] Who I am, Lord. Who I
[2:25:09] am. Oh, glorious victory. That day he
[2:25:12] set me free and made my heart as very
[2:25:13] thrown. My life is no longer mine. I'm a
[2:25:17] prisoner of love divine. And now I live
[2:25:20] to praise his name. But we say who I am,
[2:25:23] Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am.
[2:25:25] I'm a part of my savior, a part of his
[2:25:28] word. It's a revelation of who I am.
[2:25:32] Amen. We'll just start to sing this.
[2:25:34] I'll hand over to brother
[2:25:37] Mana. Oh, glorious
[2:25:41] victory. That day he set me
[2:25:45] free and made my
[2:25:50] heart
[2:25:51] his
[2:25:54] throne. My life is no longer
[2:25:58] mine. I'm a prisoner of love
[2:26:02] divine and now I
[2:26:06] need to praise his name. Amen.
[2:26:11] [Music]
[2:26:12] Who are
[2:26:16] you? I am
[2:26:23] [Applause]
[2:26:23] [Music]
