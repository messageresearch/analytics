[Music] lord [Music] [Music] you seen what ruth [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we are going to read in the book of ruth amen amen my daughter go go now to glean in another field neither go from hence by about here first by my maidens let their eyes be on the field that they they don't reap and go down after them if i not charge the young men that they should not touch thee and when their heart at a thirst go on to the vessel and drink of that which the young men have drawn universally amen amen it's always a privilege to be in the presence of god experiment experienced and wrote it in because if you're still alive it's because god has hasn't done with us yet that's why we want to thank him for that always like to thank our pastor every time i stand here and especially with this uh subject that i didn't want to preach [Music] the the fair commercial conduit i feel like the way he has given us the liberty to do his god lebanese may god bless him so richly amen amen i don't know if this little subject has blessed someone amen amen we are also waiting tonight to hurt something the four steps of root that the perfect type of a gentile church amen amen we have seen those four steps we had opera rit and ruth and we are sin que because in the gentile church there are those that backslide which is oppa retrograde the backslidden uh believer amen a by speaking about this story length answer the dear the intent of god anus by sending us the message is to typify us as a man amen and we've seen ruth elevate about decision she decided she decided first of all and we have seen the decisions that represent the justification and we have seen the serving the working of ruth or the service the service the service of only apocalypse we as the four steps of redemption for the gentile church [Music] and we have seen ruth resting de boers at the feet of bulls sec which represents the baptism the scientists pray of the holy ghost and the fourth step is the reward of ruth which is the adoption we have a justification if everybody was here in the church as we know each other as a member of the church justification at the uh justification or justification uh i spoke about it for two days but there's still something that but that's still bothering me of exactly the plane of redemption that represents it up the steps of redemption as the church of the gentiles amen that is why god analysis during equals to christ and we are seeing naomi naomi naomi leviticus and then he uh redeemed naomi that's what jesus did [Applause] preaching to the gentiles and brother burnham said now for the gentiles decision to bring the church to the decision uh [Applause] to fulfill the complete plane of redemption [Applause] the brothers are set out of evil in this time that we're living a lot of people in the message [Music] the time is over nozzle only a second problem this we are going to read what brother branham said in the order of the church sorry in 1958 10 seconds uh just check what brother branham said here pagar sank faban md paragraph seven illegal cece he said this nuclear we believe in the justification by faith scripture romans chapter seven verse chapter five roman chapter five first verse we believe when the person is justified by faith he has peace with the lord jesus amen we have to take the decision the justification [Applause] lord jesus set it up that's their brother branham called it just mentioned but then probably it's possible for the very same person you still have the habit of drinking water smoking a fair day the the the show's a sad doing filthy habit if you're still noticing these things in your life in this message it's very are you uh you lie to yourself okay it's very important for me to know how to tap the like steps of grace i believe everybody took a right decision amen if they are still people have a pretty decision correct [Music] strength to reach the adoption amen amen and he continues jesus sanctification and we we believe that the blood of jesus sanctifies the person alvi de la merced and today i'm going to speak about the the second step let's read the serving word william all the life of william branham his life was sanctified he said okay he's a tender against [Music] in until 12 but just uh fight with your thoughts try to live a sanctified life totally a person negative in a way that all the negatives but to nestle it's always focused on christ i always turn to the message the word prayer brothers say something like this sanctify life dancing when they criticizing argument we fight with debate for doctrine and every other thing what about the sanctified life amen amen where is the sanctified life basket innovation defense because they sanctified life most of us as you you know jesus jesus jesus was just passing by illy passes he was just passing by you will man of god just noticed a transgender there is a strange presence in such a way that man started crying what are you doing here what are you doing god can help us see the pen even those few problems useless problem will go away diablo for the service of the lord amen amen that's stopped by the justification opportunity to read let me read it gives the scriptures he might sanctify the people with his own blood i suffer all about suffered without the gate and listen to brother brother sanctification and we believe that the sanctification is the thought in the new testament but listen now carefully living today we have to preach the sanctification amen amen one day when i was preaching somewhere yeah listen this person said allah that after the [Music] it's a complete plane of the redemption i will be sincere with god see the second if i know the sanctification it feels like i'm still struggling with jesus i'm still the son of god amen amen because in this step of justification remember sanctification given to this notification depending by number continue but the bottom continues paragraph awaits paragraph eight comes as i thought so many times it's like picking up a glass out of the chicken yard justification with the fact of picking it up pray ready for the use avec and with a purpose the justification is he still has a lot of filthiness my brother when you come this glass is too good i will take it they get to press out once you take it justification that's the justification amen amen justification that's justification messenger [Applause] even oh [Applause] you give yourself freely to god tell me in such a way be happy [Applause] of view problem this becomes a problem especially if it's uh unfortunate it might happen because [Applause] the one that is got a way to justify him dear pelipe god can lose him uh no sorry he can miss the heavens he can miss the rupture silver if he makes mistake here because abba is sovereign but the one who's in adoption god is in him medan called fable but in a weekly body body he'll be committed he can make mistake amen amen may say louis [Applause] the mistake that the person that can do at that step of adoption be careful if you make fun of them those mistakes it can be complicated for your life that's the reason why we see the deepening nowhere the type of noah malgreen despite being said but what he has said realism it happened amen amen objective you had a person because you wanted to use it and nobody's burned yet god wanted to use us amen after cleansing it secular what happened say proper it's clean now amen amen but you cannot use it right away amen amen say prop it's clean before it's it's a glass that had a dirtiness on it second was that effect you're going to take that glass are you going to burn it remember there was a heart who has uh had a serpent inside eh that's what produces evil when we we born amen amen what happened because every time we come back when we listen to [Applause] even if you spend a lot of time in the church but when he sees god blessing another brother he starts saying ah really why only him i studied this word before but why only here you see what he came here amen amen without the new birth jesus was where son nobody will go let's compete can we say amen hello give her the ussr [Applause] a new to give him a hatred to see because that person was promoted he started singing really he did he buy a house he prefers nearly you can spend years in the church rise up again that won't change that serpent needs to be killed that is why we need a fire divine fire when somebody says i need a divine fire [Applause] fire come down hallelujah will never tell this is what god does eh amen amen yes you you are sure now as the glass sighted network has been cleaned let me grab one and the germs have been destroyed everything has been destroyed yes we fear i'm proud to use this to drink the water because i know nothing will contaminate amen amen objective that is the purpose of god when god called us loses defeat he justifies network he cleans us and he wants to use you to lose he wants to use the level he wants to use it he wants to use all of us and there's a lot of work to do what to what boss say i read to roots the work of rules sanctification equals the sanctification amen not knowing what to do la famine even the famine came and she started working why she started working she had to work together and to serve a man let us be productive in the lord amen amen no matter how melissa are predicted let me be predicted let's get you should be productive ruth khan when they got there she told naomi now how are we supposed to do now okay now you have the problem now i mean there's no problem i'm going to seek for a field how come that says oh see there's a record season of harvest and then i'll work yeah and god will help us we're going to survive illegally and then she went out in ruth cambodia she didn't think about reward amen amen answer messina by deciding that should go along with you she didn't know where she was going i've never been there before she didn't know what she was expecting she was decided because she had a revelation i'm already in that part of the family but that god had to be my general [Applause] that's what god does god for the destination when you decide how you your apprene the guy will lead your footsteps where you won't know what to do it's god behind it when you do it [Applause] church mercy teacher lesson by if you decide jeff guarantees a guarantee remember the same god of rules we'll lead your footsteps you will warp yourself oh my god notice your work hallelujah amen may the holy ghost see

nutrition don't go to another field amen amen oh foreign [Music] a good girl [Applause] and sometimes uh redeemer and redemption disposal ruth was uh ready to forget all about idols elected disposal she was ready to forget all a past life ilia de circumstances they are circumstances opposition they are obstacles they are distractions both of them that in the same church there is some church about amen i'm continuing no matter the circumstances she was willing to move forward amen says [Applause] regardless your name is i never like to tell the people you're going to prosper and be a rich man a dear father bernie and god going to bless you [Applause] i don't promise that because god doesn't promise that amen amen says [Applause] i don't care how rough the rock gets no matter what [Applause]

it okay he's on calvary de la route right in the middle of the road listen a motif if it's just a little bit emotional a man's setting christ says yes don't fix it eyes are seven if it's just a little bit emotional la sleeper the first once you are establishing christ a conversation and christ once you are never connected you are not your position in christ what happens when you know you pause your position in christ stay put because if you're a little bit emotional you become a fanatic and then you lose the balance if you go on the other side let's pray that the spirit of god is gone from you yes sir [Applause] and that's why you see stay here same message this message will never be then this is the reason why we have to stay in the [Music] says let me say this if god called you in this church god had a purpose why he brought it he cannot just bring you for no reason let somebody say amen i don't thinks the world the plane of god works and you have to know the revelation amen you know the way god does things circle it's in everywhere yeah i univision god have for that person to execute the vision of god a concert person executed when that person you'll be blessed amen amen that's the reason why why can't you just live in easter ever when i came here in denver jesus i came in this church i god gives the vision to the pastor amen amen benediction for the special blessing to a people see we don't set a vision if god gives him that vision persona nobody will have the vision that he who set a glitch for this church for a very local church god gives a man a pepper god
