bow our [Music] head precious Heavenly Father we are here so that you can teach us very often we are not patient we want the result [Music] quickly sometimes not waiting long enough on our knees I pray that you teach us tonight to wait on our knees until you bring us the [Music] answer we have a lot of request father and sometimes we are on the rush but we pray that you could bring your understanding in the quietness of the spirit to us bless the service take me out of the [Music] way and come speak to us so that we can be right in your sight with the payment of our duties shall it be tight or taxes even credit card even our home [Music] payment Lord we want to honor thy word speak to our heart now in Jesus Christ name we ask amen amen may God bless you may God bless you amen you may be seated while as I greet you also in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus brother nille is it okay uh brother nille as a change the microphone uh you know when you are not used to something I feel like there is something ping hanging here but uh it's a for better reception for them to be able to control the sound amen amen we thank the Technology Group for all their input and effort amen amen so we spoke last Sunday on uh tight is based on the increase and uh tonight it's going to be part 50 uh there are so many things that I can keep going but I think 50 services on just uh blessings it's uh enough and uh for the remaining we pray that God continue to bless each one of you and uh for us to see the materialization of this Ser becoming real in everyone's life the purpose was to see God's people people to be blessed not to be cursed to come to the understanding that um we cannot be confused between blessings and curses because very often when we talk we think like we are blessed but in reality there is no blessing if we don't obey the word of [Music] God so as I said I'm going to stop on part 50 and I will take uh the lesson on Sunday just on offerings because if I want to make it also longer but I I pray that uh the Holy Spirit can reveal unto you more than what I have U brought and uh in your life uh since you become aware that TI is pay on increase you have to make attention in your life that everything that is happening is it really an increase to me or not because when you look even at uh the tax law there are so many many aspect they draw from the Bible you know that when you have you owe somebody something maybe to the credit card company and uh and the credit card company forgive you that Deb you know that the portion that has been forgiven is taxable income yes it is that's what you receive the form 1099 C for debt cancellation so if the legislation does a certain thing like [Music] that I'm not telling you everything but I'm telling you the the necessity for you to be aware on how to handle this matter regarding questions that can happen in common life maybe inheritance is it an increase your dad die he left you as a beneficiary of 100,000 in the bank is it taxable table life insurance benefit accident benefit they hit you in the car it was not even hard but you make it harder you went to see the doctor my back because there is no treatment for the back and then they pay you question mark so there are so many many aspect but I cannot cover all but for tonight let us stand as we read the scripture Malachi chapter 3 always from verse 6 and I will take my subject from Roman chapter 13 for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you said the Lord of host but he say wherein shall we return will a man hope God yet he have HED me but he say wherein have we hop thee in tithes and offerings so this is the topic we are addressing tight and offerings and if we don't do it correctly that means we don't pay it the way it should be don't pay more or don't pay less just 10% and the 10% of what 10% of what God has prospered you amen amen so I'm going to take also Roman chapter 13 from verse 6 Roman 13 uh you know Roman 13 is talking about us to obey authorities etc etc and among what we need to obey for to authorities we have to pay our tribute uh the Bible said for this cause pay tribute also for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their Jews tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear honor to [Music] whom listen now to verse eight oh no man anything oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another as fulfill the law keep it just [Music] that my my subject is oh no man anything especially to God may the Lord bless the reading of the scripture you may be seated oh no man anything if the Bible is saying oh no man anything now as we are studying the tight and offering if from one another oh no man anything how much more if we have to owe God are you with me it's just a reflection the Bible said owe nothing to anybody to any man that brother and sisters we are we are in love for one another that's what the Bible said oh no man anything but to love one another because if you love one another a favor that my brother has done unto me he gave me some money with the promise to pay him back but if there is a real love I have to put myself in his position not to feel yourself like only me only me only me you take you feel good you decrease your brother but it's normal if we can take and pay back but it's bad if we can take it and we don't pay back we start getting our pay but we feel like the money is good and it's good for not even for me not to pay back this is a lack of love it's too much selfishness and we don't want us to be in that condition I may have not something I can go sister L help me with this I'm going to pay you and when I go pay back I have to keep my word and in the previous lesson I I read The Book of Leviticus or the book of Deuteronomy when you learn money to your brother in the faith don't charge them interest and we don't want to take advantage of that because there is no interest I'm not going to pay oh brother Friday Friday no no no no no no this is the point I'm going to heat a little bit with the thought on the tight if God can tell human being don't owe other people don't you understand that God is our priority if we should not owe to one another therefore we should not also oh God you like money I'm talking about money about paying the debt even the credit card companies that company it has it owner they need to make money and you take it and I'm not going to pay but when you took the credit card you knew that there is a payment plan if you cannot afford it brother don't overwhelm yourself with debt because a lot of debt will make you live a life of uh left right left right Z when the Creditor is after you you will be tempted to lie oh I was in the hospital or they did not pay me I lost my job it's not good and I think when we come to the church all later on when I will talk about the function of the trustees administrator the truste are people who are going to watch over the church not to enter into programs let us buy this let us buy this let us buy this to the extent you start putting more pressure on the people to contribute contribute on this we want to buy a airplane for the church really the church need the airplane so there should be the people before they engage the church they should do it on something that is important not wake up tomorrow oh brother you know what let us demolish this building and build another one with a balcony because all the new churches have balcony so there should be people who know what they are doing and same thing with our family the head of the house must be something who know what they are doing with their finances because the money that God gives us we have to use it wisely not going to buy oh I need a this car I need also this car you find yourself with five cars this one payment 1,000 a month this one 2,000 a month how much money do you make and the five car for which purpose so with this in our mind brother NE I think this thing is battling me is I'm in pain some sorry okay I think they are going to adjust it yeah so if God said oh no man he did not say in that scripture oh me no he's just teaching you if you love one another don't owe to each other this doesn't mean that we cannot contract debt no we contract the debt that we can afford and we have to respect our engagement and this is the love from one another and if we love God we will do the same way we cannot owe God we have been taught to pay our TI to pay our offering and we have to pay them timely also if you don't pay it when it's do you owe now God sometimes the debt towards god with our TI and offering is taking month weeks Years brother you are a Believer you make money five years in the church you don't pay your ti one year no no the first thing we have to do is to pay our TI let me go with William Bram in August 15 1965 I did not give you that quot 65 look at the message and know it not preach August 15 1965 paragraph 280 and you know sometimes as preachers you can come across a something that come when you are preaching you just mention it maybe without going into much detail and the people who understand it and they will that will cause sometimes problems when brother B was preaching this message this was August 15 so there was a Sunday he said this and people they came with a lot of questions and the next Sunday that I will give you the next quote that was preached August 22nd 1965 just a week later where brother trying to clarify it but what he said he was telling people clean your lives up clean your life up in which way to to clean up your lifeam say pay your debt oh no man that's what Jesus said amen amen let us remove it go to the next quot so as a preacher he was saying brother his mind was on people cleaning up their life pay your debt with one another pay your ti to God also which is the to God clean your life that means if you owe people money you live a dirty life oh amen you don't like it it's a dirty life you will be a hypocrite you will be a liar you will be a cook because when you get the first loan they give to you in order to get the next one you have to say something sweet and that sweet thing is not always so go in the next quod the first one I gave you that brother preach the next Sunday Christ is revealed in his own word par 12 now now I see laying here there had been many requests this last week what he said last Sunday people came with a lot of request on what I said last Sunday on the message I believe I forget what I titled it on that was that message and know it not but I said something about paying your debt and you know no matter what you say it's misunderstood by many no matter what you say no matter what you say brother we are not in a theology school where I have to do the think or a preacher say think methodically whatever you say people will misunderstand it but the best attitude if you misunderstand approach your brother approach your sister don't go and start talking on the side did you hear what he said what did he meant maybe it's something that slip out of his mouth they don't want to misunderstand it if they don't do it also as I don't want to understand it no but you just simply misunderstand it and now someone said should we buy a car here brother was trying maybe one of the question somebody asked shall we buy everything cash do you know that the Jehovah Witnesses they don't take debt hello I'm teaching you Jehovah Witness Doctrine they are not for that you want to buy something save your money save your money go pay it cash but us that's not what brother is teaching us you can't take a debt as long as you can afford and pay it correctly that's why he said now that isn't what Jesus spoke of all the Bible there that said oh no man nothing it's that lingering debt that you could pay that's what Jesus was talking about the long debt you take money from your brother I pay you tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow no that's what the Bible is talking oh no man in that way pay them that owing no man nothing it doesn't mean oh my we owe our rent our telephone bill yeah we buy we use the telephone on a debt basis at the end of the month we go pay we stay in our apartment at the end of the month we go pay we use the car at the end of the month we go pay as long as we pay it's okay but what Jesus was talking that is clarifying is those things that you can pay and you don't want to pay among us if we go into records brother it will be a shame to the extent this one ow this one this one ow this one not on a single basis but on a regular basis a date that last a long time [Music] and it seems like you don't care yourself and you are claiming that I'm going into the Rapture said don't go in the Rapture with something hanging on your neck clean up your life pay your debt in order to successfully pay your debt manage your debt correctly take the debt you can afford not because that one bought that car I need also that car and Trouble In The Family the wife telling husb this time if I give birth you have to buy the car for me no and you the wife you are putting pressure on your husband and today he can have a [Music] stroke because of pressure we are getting old spare the pressure on one another I have also to have that I have to have this and to the extent people coming to church they are coping one another this one buy this I have also do you have the the same money with that no that's not my problem my time are you a Christian or are you a pan hello hello and that pressure will put the family in big debt to the extent now they can no more pay the debt tight no the money coming is just enough to cover what people can see because if they take the house they take the car ah it's going to be embarrassing therefore let us put God uh behind but the same God is the one who said oh no man nothing don't owe to the dealer don't owe also to Heaven amen amen Bram continu continue he's talking about those hanging depth but an old lering debt that you could be paying on pay it off see now don't go with anything hanging on you like that don't go with anything hanging on you like that is the the translation correct I think paragraph 13 brother who is teaching us the things is giving now his testimony I remember a time when I was sick once when I was a boy I came out of the hospital owing about $2,000 and used to be a drug here Mr swaner I owe him about three or $400 a medicine Bill he didn't even know me oh what a testimony and a man I went to him I didn't know him and he just send it up there anyhow never refused to send it and I said I owe you this is the thing that Christian they don't do anymore you ow somebody you start avoiding eye contact a level advanced level of demonology you owe him God bless you and if you can avoid him you avoid him don't avoid nobody you owe the person be the one looking for him here I am you know I've have a hard time I'm trying my best I still owe you I know your debt has last longer pray for me so that I can work and pay you back this is a Christian attitude even the credit card companies when they call you discover oh discover oh America Express American Express want them you got the money which kind of Christian are you I was with mron down on cour Avenue and spring I said I owe you and I'm just still awful weak but I'm trying to go to work yes you have to go to work not to be lazy now if I can't pay you said I just become a Christian but you the Christian of a long date you are running away are you following what we are not reading just for knowledge but for those things to be applied in our life now if I can't pay you I just become a Christian I said first thing Mr as my my duty to God I owe him my tight amen am when you don't pay your ti this is the thing causing you not to be able to pay your debt because you have no plan at all a Christian has a sound plan a sound a good plan they pay me I know I have those debt but first I pay my TI and then I handle the rest of my debt said as my duty to God I owe him my ti I want to pay him my titting first I want want to pay him my first okay and I said then my next duty is to pay my debt not to buy my food are you the prophet is to pay my debt I said my father is sick and I got there is 10 of us children in the family but I said if I can't pay you no more than 25 on that bill more than 25 where I'm here if I can't pay you even the 25 cents I will come by I will come by and tell you about it not I will run away or trying to pretend like I have forgotten when I came to America I was in New York with my cousin he was already in America for more than 8 years he told me this say they think not to do with American people here don't lend them your [Music] money yes because what they do when you give to them they will pretend like they forgot but they don't forget brother if you have been fainting here just go back and see the brother and sister I owe you I owe you forgive me by God's grace I will pay you as little as I can until I will make sure I pay it off and if the government give me stimulus the first thing is to pay you the bad thing we pretend and we call oursel Christian we are going to heaven and in many churches what keep the pastor busy is the litigation among the people oh took my money he answer me the way you want brother if you see some people coming to you to lend some money ask the pastor first look at the condition you are putting people because I don't want to have any litigation a court of unsettled debt I can't do it this time now by the help of God I pay every bit off said by God's help he pay off the debt to Mr see but that's what I mean I mean see just don't uh somebody say let's continue oh some Christian here at the church one time went out and got some work done on a car here to a mechanic oh papa what is his name Papa fix my car he come and fix your car I will pay you Friday and then you never pay or you go to those African shop they fix your car and going to pay you don't pay and the work we do one another I will pay you and I don't pay said one of member in the church got to work some work done on the car here and the man come down the man said I will pay you I get paid Saturday but which Saturday or something another and he never paid him and weeks after weeks R by never said a word I'm reading the prophet to tell you brother is bad and said and the man come ask me after all if you don't pay people go to your pastor people go see the pastor they went to see and ask me say it reflect against the church it reflects against the [Music] church it reflects against Christ how you are going to teach those people by being a cook and if you can't pay him go tell him and say I owe you and I'm going to pay you I am a Christian but when you do the zigz you don't show that you are Christian I want to I have to tell you these things so that this bad habit S I can't do it right now I owe this listen to this said and remember what you do it's on God's books too you take debt you don't pay back it's in the God's book you know so I'm trying to for myself and for all of us together try to be ready for we know we are getting near something the Rapture is [Music] near very near of something is going to take place so we want to be ready when the coming of the Lord is Dowing tonight now we want to be ready for that great hour that means clean up your life clean up your life pay your [Music] debt even for the tight brother even for the tight don't you be late the T you instead of bringing it on Sunday next paycheck brother once you miss one you invite the devil on the scene the next paycheck you have [Music] hoping a day before the pay you are going to get a phone call your uncle is in coma oh suddenly your car breaks down they to it and to take it back $300 some of the money we pay it's the consequences there are consequences do you don't have eyes to see then that's what is happening the consequence of missing the time to pay the Bible has taught us I read it last Sunday First Corinthian chapter 16 verse 1 and 2 Paul said you can't give us the scripture concerning the collection concerning the collection for the saint as I have given order to the churches of Gala even so do you upon the first day of the week the first day of the week what the first day of the week it's Sunday so let everyone of you lay aside by him in store as God has prospered him God gave you money on the Thursday or on Friday you get your paycheck before you pay everyone let every one of you lay by him in the store put the tight beside first and the family husband and wife you have to talk it over how you get paid did you apply First Corinthians 16 chapter verse lay aside this is my ti I put it there then the first day of the week we come to church let us pray for the offering the basket start going I am happy to contribute if you don't do it this way you are late one time as I said I read this scripture in France they say oh it it doesn't say tight here said give me Redemption by judgment brother gave the interpretation paragraph 57 Our Kind Heavenly Father come on back there the at the end of them huh the end of the sermon the very last Our Kind Heavenly Father thou has taught us in the word that let every man lay aside that which God has prospered him that when the first day of the week when we come together that we bring we should bring in our tight and offerings so that scripture Paul saying in First Corinthians 16 brother is applying it to tight and offering that means you should not miss the first Sunday amen amen if you don't pay the first Sunday you are late but God said oh no man that means also don't owe me don't you be late with your tight and offering when we have to pay the building fund it's part of our duty you don't want to be [Music] late amen amen Brothers sometimes we become negligent lazy or God will understand let me tell you the only language God understands is his word when he said the first week the first Sunday of the week that's what he meant you bring it the second Sunday of the week or the following week you are late question and answer number two they ask brother a question should a person pay tight to an individual or should a Christian work because many people think I'm a Christian I don't want to work I need to study the Bible study the Bible the Paul said he that doesn't work let him eat not study the Bible and fast as long as you can study amen amen don't confuse people oh brother I'm in in the Tabernacle of the congregation it's good yeah but he's working answer the question sure he should that means the Christian should work and he he's adding he's the one man that will work is a Christian if there will be somebody who work hard it's a Christian we are not supporting the lazy [Music] people they take you to this company you do maybe it's hard I can't do it then where is so they can marry you but amen remember when brother went to see to Hope Mr Bach he was a rich person could be concerned about the future of his daughter butam said Mr Bach I guarantee you I will work hard my my my hand I will [Music] bleed to feed your daughter that's a real man a real man doesn't stay in the blanket someone to go to work and give you that money from that cult Les is not from God they like to sleep all the time give me proverb I think proverb proverb 20 verse 13 the Bible say don't love to sleep too much if you sleep too much you become poor a man sleeping more than 8 hours on a regular basis a real man you sleep 6 [Music] hours you sleep midnight 6 6:00 you are but you come no your wife found you on the bed and she left bed and leave you still sleeping and when even she wake up you are snoring ofand the Bible say love not sleep L Thou come to write down this verse if someone comes to marry you give him proverb 2013 start talking now in code it's not a good habit sometimes I I saw a guy coming very often to my office the wife is working hard to the extent you don't even see the wife bringing the paper to the office it's the man the man is not working Julia what is that name of that Dad he was to call himself a stay home Dad it should be a shame I'm a stay home dad why did you get to marriage someone's daughter open thy eyes and thou shall be satisfied with Bread open your eyes Don't Close Your Eyes on the bed if there is somebody working it should be the Christian a Christian go to work make money come pay

it's the same way for parents you lie to the children if you get the grade A I will buy you a bike I will buy you this it's like the speech from the television somebody give money to the [Music] child give I will keep it for you Daddy will spend that money and com mom my mom you parent what are you going to teach the children when I promise let your children know when Daddy promised I have it already if I say you are going to have a new iPad I do this my iPad is coming the way I know my dad the way I know my mom I get it already I can testify but the child have been testifying they with the scriptures speaks of that that the husband would be against wife the wife against husband children against parents just among the elected of the Lord will there be any love left who has who have families become this talking about the families now about the churches the churches has got into the same thing out of social life they brought it into the church their social life and their politics and their other things until they have got to the church so confused that he doesn't know what to do they brought politics in the church they brought also social life their social activities the church is to preach the word of God the rest of the activities all birthday all showers secondary but if you place them ahead of the word you come in trouble Bingo and B those are things oh there is a new company go put the money get a lot of money what if that doesn't happen over what they call it and this sers and dances and so forth in the house of the Lord why it's a pity you say well that isn't that's on the annex the annex is the house closer to the church remember it was the annex also that Jesus beat the merchant out with their merchandise oh we are just in the lobby here we can make noise we can make buies remember it's the house of God [Music] are you reading with me it's written my father's house is made a house of prayer as soon as the service is over maybe somebody praying in the [Music] basement in the lobby making a lot of how many times shall we talk about it and you have made it a den of theves see it's wrong I don't care where it's at as long as the church the church is not so much the building it's the people in the building let's skip here now we find out that the churches two are always promising something like television and so forth that they never get to the thing they promis you promise your children you promise your husband you promise the wife you promise the the pastor promise the congregation things they can never come to accomplish don't you do that when you give your vow your promise try to do it you take something from somebody you cannot come talk to the person nicely to extend the person can really see that you are sincere but when they come as I'm reading here I think maybe there will be a lot of things that will happen after know just forgive me as the in the heart there is no sincerity that's why you continue to live in that mess as I have often said you can take the note and go read it yourself sking to paragraph 60 that's even become in Pentecost in the churches here tonight I say it even in the message Church people take debt they don't pay they promise think they cannot accomplish you promise your your dad your your daughter I will have a graduation party is there graduation King The Garden or your University which graduation are you talking University Kingdom Garden it become into the Pentecostal real that they are always promising something they never get to it's always that every fellow has a different sensation and make it whether it scriptural or [Music] not they are promising something that they never get to E until it seems like it's got to a place to where there doesn't seem to be any sincerity brother give me this I pray you tomorrow it's like a a slogan they never get to it the people don't get down to that real canel of sincerity the very English word of sincerity has lost its value to the people brother forgive me I I will I did not pay you but I will pay you but in the meantime you have money in the pocket brother first pay that oh by the people way of living it lost its sincerity to them sity now they don't seem to understand it paragraph 61 bam said even to our confession there is no confession even to our confessions conf we confess the same sin but there is no sincerity you lie because they CAU you forgive me but are you sincere in your heart sincerity means you recognize first that what I did was wrong second I go see the person for forgiveness then I turn to God with a promise that if you forgive me by your grace help me not to do it again a real confession must lead you to promise that by God's grace I will not do it like a sister was saying uh I always commit adultery he knows that if I do that I come back to him and ask for foress normal do you think it's a confession there is no nothing showing that you are sorry that's why you continue to do it let me with I want you people that are coming here or on the tape I want you to listen closely now for a moment to this quotation unless you are deeply sincere and you cannot be sincere until you are positive understanding sking to 63 you can read it in this message paragraph 63 I think one of the things that keeps our people from being healed is the lack of confession the lack of sincere confession when you go borrow things from your brother be sincere and if you cannot pay it and you go ask for apology be also deeply sincere and if you are not sincere even in your confession there will be no result and the thing that pre brother you know we pray a lot for the people and you don't see sometimes result it's the lack of sincere confession last line on this paragraph I have to skip all these said I believe in confession is straightening up also I did something for it's good to do that said I believe in confession is straightening up also if I that means if I stole I am sincere I ask for forgiveness I have to restore the thing I stole that's what he called straightening up not I did something when telephone he went to see the person and he left there he went to the creek in that place he was to pray he prayed he prayed and he said father Show Me A Sign until he saw a will wind then it was a sign that he get the [Music] peace tonight as I'm closing brother oh nobody oh not God what you did all the month you scaped you have to straighten it up amen skip don't just say so now we're going to start a new life if you don't straighten it up you will start a new you will stop you will stop somewhere do the same and I don't think I'm going to preach this Ser again you know the last time I preach on those was in the old church in 2 I think 2009 or 2010 it took about about 13 whatever years but you have followed these things make sure you ask enough Grace and you streten up things it isn't True Confession unless it is straightened up may God bless [Applause] you
