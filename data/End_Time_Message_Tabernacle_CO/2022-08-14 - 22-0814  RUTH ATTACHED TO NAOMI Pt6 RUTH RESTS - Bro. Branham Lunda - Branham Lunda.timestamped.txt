[18:01] church amen amen
[18:06] it's been a few weeks
[18:12] we've seen that there are four chapters
[18:14] in The Book of Ruth
[18:18] we have chapter one Ruth still taking
[18:21] the decision
[18:23] or service chapter 2 Ruth who are
[18:26] serving
[18:32] as we just read it we see Ruth at the
[18:35] feet of boas El chapite
[18:40] and chapter 4 is Ruth rewarded by
[18:44] marriage
[18:48] to read the four stages for Ruth sad
[18:51] decisions
[18:55] her decision which is a justification
[18:57] foreign
[19:17] to give us a picture
[19:22] if you can just leave the writing on the
[19:25] board because this is Young we have the
[19:28] decision

[20:12] La sanctification sanctification
[20:20] the
[20:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:25] La adoption and adoption
[20:35] amen amen
[20:37] RIT Ruth addition had decided
[20:45] Ruth had to work
[20:48] and because of her work
[20:55] she had the rest
[21:08] and four
[21:10] a Saturday
[21:14] that types the decision of Earth
[21:18] justification for us is justification
[21:22] our work is sanctification
[21:26] rest is the baptism of the Holy ghosts
[21:30] and at the end the marriage is the
[21:34] adoption
[21:37] and this morning we're already at this
[21:40] stage the third amen amen
[21:43] Ruth arrest amen
[21:48] and this morning we're talking on the
[21:50] rest of Ruth GTP categories
[21:55] their types for us the baptism of the
[21:58] Holy ghosts
[22:02] as the pastor asked questions
[22:08] it is really the story of redemption for
[22:12] married
[22:15] how Ruth came from this messy family and
[22:19] neglected
[22:25] but God by his grace will take her to
[22:28] bring her in in the family of Jesus
[22:31] and these four stages of Ruth the
[22:34] exactly
[22:37] it is the same way that God has done
[22:40] with the gentle church amen amen
[22:44] as we know that we are people from other
[22:46] nations
[22:51] we were not counted biologically as the
[22:55] people of God
[22:59] because the biological people of God is
[23:02] the Jew a no no muslim representative
[23:08] we are represented as Gentiles the
[23:11] moabites
[23:12] but what did God do eleven is
[23:17] you came and today to save the Jews
[23:22] at the same time there is uh they are
[23:25] serving the Jews
[23:27] he also saves us the gentile people
[23:31] by Grace amen amen we didn't do nothing
[23:37] but he decided
[23:39] by his own grace de nacion the gentle
[23:43] Church
[23:44] what did God do
[23:48] justification
[23:50] he brought them by justification
[23:52] sanctification
[23:59] we know that the Gentiles church is
[24:01] called after the panther code amen amen
[24:04] yes
[24:10] to raise up this church
[24:16] this church starting with Martin Luther
[24:19] justification
[24:21] because that's him that started that
[24:23] prison justification
[24:28] and God carried on the next stage of the
[24:31] with the Gentile Church John Wesley or
[24:34] through John Wesley
[24:36] Massachusetts and God sent the message
[24:39] of sanctification and afterwards
[24:44] and then came the return of the Holy
[24:47] Ghost the Pentecostal age
[24:49] and after this age
[24:55] perfect and therefore God has to move on
[24:58] and carry on because yes
[25:02] that has to resemble what God wants to
[25:05] have as a bride
[25:17] has to see the quality of work that Ruth
[25:20] has to do amen amen
[25:24] we spoke about the Ruth's work
[25:27] throughout the week is
[25:30] and we saw that Ruth after deciding
[25:34] sentence
[25:38] just to move on so that he can take us
[25:40] into the heavens
[25:43] roof after deciding La decisions
[25:52] that's what we believe
[25:56] and when we accept Christ and we engage
[25:59] ourselves
[26:01] we decide not to go back in the world
[26:05] that pushes us to work
[27:34] and we came into this family
[27:39] in this family we came to find people we
[27:42] never known before
[27:44] and then those people are my family
[27:49] I have no more desire to go back into
[27:52] the family be as rules
[27:56] he died people will be my people
[28:00] be your life
[28:03] when God sends us the message
[28:08] foreign
[29:08] only surrounded by people who always sit
[29:10] down
[29:11] they will always discourage you
[29:14] won't go any further
[29:16] the second level fire
[29:19] that's why that's what happens when we
[29:22] take our decision
[29:24] and when Ruth decided
[29:27] after gleaning in the land
[29:30] Boaz walking by
[29:35] seeing Ruth the way she was working and
[29:38] the boy says
[29:49] that's sanctification
[29:53] we don't stay there lazy
[30:08] [Music]
[30:20] is Christ
[30:23] boys
[30:54] [Music]
[31:23] foreign
[32:25] [Laughter]
[32:48] into what others are doing
[32:51] and boys
[32:53] he said as you have worked
[32:56] so hard now you have to rest
[33:01] you have to rest
[33:03] Beloved
[33:06] the work of God always pays off
[33:11] that's the reason why don't try if I
[33:14] catch you fat the work that you do
[33:16] you're not doing it to impress anything
[33:19] but I'm doing it because I have decided
[33:23] suggest that this God here the god of
[33:27] William Brothers
[33:30] to reveal the Bible he is the true God
[33:35] the religion that ahead
[33:44] I've understood that all these guys
[34:25] you cannot be shaken
[34:51] if you're not a preacher foreign
[35:33] even if I'm not a preacher
[35:36] I can also Ministry
[35:41] [Applause]
[35:42] your life
[35:44] even if you're not on the board in your
[35:48] life is a great sermon
[35:52] is
[35:58] the sisters
[36:00] even if she cannot come up here
[36:03] but her behavior
[36:10] it is
[36:16] you as a role model
[36:18] [Applause]
[36:41] [Music]
[36:45] but everything is all right
[36:55] you said that when they seal a wagon
[36:59] less Specter the inspector Illinois it
[37:04] has to be sure
[37:05] that the work was well done
[37:10] the inspector Jesus less than terrible
[37:13] one they respectables
[37:16] he has to be sure that after you've
[37:20] decided
[37:22] to provide enough is a very perfect word
[37:27] to get you to rest
[37:30] hey man not somebody
[37:34] today he comes he comes to church he's
[37:39] working
[37:40] probably is paying his time
[37:43] probably supposed to cause in a way or
[37:46] another may I pray but
[37:48] then something happens
[37:51] then instead of regrading on those
[37:55] things
[37:56] or even with those denominations
[38:00] oh when we were there with those gods
[38:09] it's not a correct work amen amen
[38:16] but when God sees get you continue
[38:19] Without You carrying on you working
[38:24] dear God Kyle expected us when it
[38:29] inspects your life
[38:32] because sanctification is a work
[38:35] amen
[39:26] [Music]
[39:32] and I will speak on the things that you
[39:35] Wicked
[39:38] and when he's talking
[39:42] meaning when you're listening to the
[39:44] words and you start working oh Lord
[39:49] it is true this part here oh this
[39:52] belongs to me
[39:54] merciful and they say kill me by the
[39:57] grace and remove for me
[40:00] remove from me despair
[40:03] this is the word please the more you
[40:07] work like that was his secretary the
[40:10] more God also sees what you're doing
[40:12] because many people it is they say
[40:18] or works that does not mean anything
[40:26] by grace
[40:31] otherwise we'll get you something else
[40:33] but Braham says
[40:35] actually in James it says
[40:40] without works
[40:43] and I'll tell you it is a dead face
[40:49] it is true that
[41:05] because I'm coming to church
[41:10] saves me by his Sovereign Grace
[41:14] because Grace is God a sovereign
[41:21] are we together
[41:25] effect but what does that Grace do
[41:28] I practically myself after saving me
[41:32] less salvation in me
[41:36] pushes me
[41:38] to work
[41:41] to show to God
[41:43] that I have nothing to give you what you
[41:47] have done is so great
[41:49] even if I work so hard
[41:54] I will not be able to match what you
[41:57] have done for me
[41:58] but Lord I will pray
[42:00] Lord I will give you praise and those
[42:04] are words
[42:13] those are the words that you do to show
[42:17] to God that there is salvation
[42:20] in other words
[42:23] you're not showing words
[42:27] there's no salvation
[42:30] yeah
[42:34] amen amen
[42:37] it's bad words God wants to see it
[42:41] we are sent by Grace
[42:45] salvation in me he says sends me to to
[42:49] sing foreign
[43:37] this is too much
[43:39] Jesus yes sir Matt but
[43:45] when he thought
[43:47] oh there's a certain Brothers there's a
[43:51] certain sister decision acceptable if I
[43:53] don't accept them oh he is a loss
[43:56] forever
[43:58] despite I cannot do it
[44:02] Jesus didn't do anything
[44:05] it's my sins
[44:08] it's your sins
[44:52] innocent individuals
[44:55] Hallelujah
[45:06] [Music]
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:17] he said
[45:49] good health
[45:52] but look in return
[45:56] even to worship him instead of any
[45:59] complicated
[46:02] oh may God open that to us may God help
[46:06] us pray we are ready to clap everybody a
[46:12] king of this world anybody out there
[46:16] but to pray to our upload for him
[46:19] that can make you breathe it is a
[46:23] problem for you we come to church
[46:26] we are more than a Catholic we sit there
[46:30] we say Amen in the heart I'm not against
[46:34] that
[46:35] but him David

[1:18:00] others
[1:18:01] do you think that you are holy
[1:18:15] but repentance was only given to the

[1:19:47] he was always receiving visions
[1:19:53] and what he has to tell people
[1:19:56] and he saw in the vision
[1:20:01] from his birth
[1:20:04] every time while he was growing he saw
[1:20:08] him serving the vision
[1:20:10] you see the man of Galilee at on the

[1:32:01] and there's a holy ghost it's two
[1:32:04] different things

[1:33:39] when God gives him the Holy Ghost
[1:33:41] is not going to remember all these
[1:33:45] mistakes
[1:33:46] but if it happens at a minute

[1:34:14] there are people who are fooling around
[1:34:16] without Authority and his uncle is only
[1:34:18] saying that they have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:27] what is the religious spirit
[1:34:32] is this the spirit that Jesus spoke
[1:34:34] about in Matthew 24.
[1:34:36] they say that the truth shall be so
[1:34:39] close
[1:34:41] that you'll be so hard
[1:34:44] to know who

[1:35:42] the sister don't want to cover
[1:35:45] themselves no more
[1:35:47] they want her to shorten their clothes

[1:35:53] but God
[1:35:54] wants you to cover yourself
[1:35:57] so you can go at his feet
[1:36:01] because Ruth wanted the boy's feet
[1:36:12] when I confess my sins God forgives them
[1:36:18] When God says that I am forgiven

[1:38:09] Jesus said
[1:38:12] when people shall say peace
[1:38:21] something that is sudden it does not
[1:38:23] warn you at first it comes to just all
