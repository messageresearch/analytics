[53:00] and compassion that you have shown a
[53:04] poof
[53:08] uh during this long time of uh morning
[53:14] the day
[53:16] we say sincerely thank you to the entire
[53:20] church
[53:22] and to the pastor
[53:24] for your presence and support during
[53:27] this difficult and painful time
[53:36] you have proven to us that we are really
[53:40] a family in Christ
[53:46] may God reward you for your kindness and
[53:50] generosity
[53:55] and give back to you
[53:58] more than what you have given it is
[54:05] [Applause]
[54:12] we have given you the plan for those who
[54:16] will be traveling to Israel this uh
[54:19] summer God willing yeah
[54:29] yeah that will be during the month of
[54:32] June God willing
[54:35] um
[54:36] and it was said that the first deposit
[54:40] of 500 for those traveling is
[54:48] must be paid during the month of January
[54:54] and I believe everyone has received an
[54:57] email where to send the 500 um
[55:08] yeah please confirmed by paying your
[55:11] portion of the trip
[55:16] I said
[55:18] to hold your spot
[55:22] and the balance will be paid later on as
[55:27] brother George Will indicators
[55:35] and also those who don't have American
[55:39] passport
[55:41] America we will need a visa visa
[55:49] you need to start looking for the Visa
[55:54] Visa those who have Congolese a passport
[55:59] uh Mexican passport feel like you're on
[56:03] the passport Mexican knowing that in
[56:06] order to travel to Europe and uh
[56:09] foreign
[56:11] [Music]
[56:21] [Music]
[56:46] you may obtain One Visa maybe for Europe
[56:49] and not have the visa for Israel
[56:53] opportunities
[57:01] amen amen so I believe everyone who has
[57:04] signed up for trip make sure that uh you
[57:08] comply is
[57:14] amen amen and uh last uh
[57:18] announcement I have
[57:21] is just a reminder for the order in the
[57:26] church
[57:29] we have continuously to remind the
[57:32] people those along countries
[57:36] I believe when you come for service
[57:41] you have to prepare yourself in order
[57:44] for God to speak to you
[57:49] and if God doesn't speak to you that
[57:51] means you did not make the services
[58:00] the first thing is the ins and out
[58:04] during the service
[58:09] I don't know how you make the service
[58:12] really
[58:17] I understand if you have a little ones
[58:20] they need to go bathroom or happen in
[58:22] and out
[58:25] functions
[58:28] but just anticipate that when you are
[58:32] out something can be said that could
[58:35] have helped you amen foreign
[59:14] give them put them on diapers
[59:20] if they need to eat zombies that's
[59:23] something a little bit different when
[59:25] the baby cries
[59:29] on paper control
[59:33] how many know brother Branham said this
[59:35] is
[59:37] during a normal service
[59:40] sometimes babies are not doing much
[59:45] but when it comes time for prayer to
[59:48] cast out demon foreign
[1:00:34] but regardless of the length of the
[1:00:36] service
[1:00:38] there are people who never go in and out
[1:00:41] yeah
[1:00:46] I always give you my testimony
[1:00:49] when I travel last time I went to Congo
[1:00:52] uh
[1:00:54] I knew the service take about eight
[1:00:57] hours
[1:01:01] before going to church people said you
[1:01:05] have to eat a lot and the drink
[1:01:09] I said I will not eat I will not drink
[1:01:15] I was sitting during the service
[1:01:19] for eight hours until I went out never
[1:01:22] go back to the
[1:01:25] restrooms
[1:01:29] I don't want to miss anything
[1:01:33] and also I don't want my presence in the
[1:01:37] church to be a distraction for anybody
[1:01:43] when they see that Pastor is
[1:01:58] they will say you see things that you
[1:02:00] hit in America now see the result
[1:02:02] brother you have to be a blessing and
[1:02:04] control the atmosphere
[1:02:08] atmosphere and sometimes even in the
[1:02:11] little room back there yeah
[1:02:16] you think the mummies are feeding the
[1:02:19] babies
[1:02:25] they are sleeping they don't mean what
[1:02:28] is the purpose
[1:02:30] and after service you ask them
[1:02:33] what was said yes
[1:02:39] this is the beginning of the year
[1:02:42] we have to change some habits
[1:02:46] we need to get closer to God
[1:02:50] we have to show our commitment uh our
[1:02:54] reference
[1:02:59] amen amen another point no
[1:03:05] this place is for worship
[1:03:10] unless you have a special
[1:03:13] conditions
[1:03:16] maybe a pregnant woman
[1:03:21] who cannot control certain things
[1:03:24] you may have your maybe your water
[1:03:27] bottle and uh if that's really necessary
[1:03:35] or somebody may be being disturbed by
[1:03:38] cough
[1:03:47] but here we are not here to drink water
[1:03:50] you cannot exists
[1:03:54] we are sending a wrong message
[1:03:58] maybe to the visitors or somebody else
[1:04:01] visitors
[1:04:03] there is a message on Church order you
[1:04:06] can go read and uh really remind you on
[1:04:09] certain things
[1:04:16] amen amen may God bless you
[1:04:19] this is the job we have to do yes
[1:04:23] from time to time we have to do a
[1:04:26] reminder
[1:04:28] and when we remind
[1:04:30] we trust that somebody is gonna pay a
[1:04:33] little bit attention

[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:18] one way amen we just appreciate the
[1:09:22] atmosphere here this morning
[1:09:25] we just want to say thank you to our
[1:09:27] pastor fossen for another opportunity to
[1:09:29] speak to you
[1:09:30] foreign
[1:09:52] [Music]
[1:10:03] we're not here to
[1:10:09] try to preach our ideas
[1:10:13] but we're here to reinforce the message
[1:10:18] we're here to preach but the message has
[1:10:20] already preached
[1:10:24] amen judges 16 starting with verse 25.
[1:10:31] the Bible says and it came to pass
[1:10:34] when their hearts were merry that they
[1:10:37] said call for Samson that he may make us
[1:10:39] Sport and they called for Samson out of
[1:10:42] the prison house and he made them Sport
[1:10:45] and they set him between the pillars and
[1:10:47] Samson said unto the lad that held him
[1:10:49] by the hand suffer me that I may feel
[1:10:52] the pillars whereupon the house standeth
[1:10:54] that I may lean upon them
[1:10:57] now the house was full of men and women
[1:10:59] and the Lords of the Philistines were
[1:11:01] there and there were upon the roof about
[1:11:04] three thousand men and women that beheld
[1:11:06] Samson while he made Sport and Samson
[1:11:09] called unto the Lord and said O Lord God
[1:11:11] remember me I pray thee and strengthen
[1:11:14] me I pray thee only this once o God that
[1:11:17] I may at once be Avenged of the
[1:11:20] Philistines for my two eyes
[1:11:24] foreign
[1:12:06] foreign
[1:12:24] Lord we just ask that you would just
[1:12:26] come down and have preeminence in this
[1:12:28] service
[1:12:30] Lord we've already sang the songs of
[1:12:32] Zions
[1:12:34] Lord we've gotten all of the
[1:12:36] announcements out of the way
[1:12:40] Lord we're coming to the portion of the
[1:12:42] service where your word is the
[1:12:44] department
[1:12:47] Lord we just ask that you would prepare
[1:12:49] our hearts prepare our minds
[1:12:52] Lord we just ask that you would help us
[1:12:55] to be ready to receive your word
[1:12:58] Lord you said in the scriptures that
[1:13:01] some seeds fall on on rocks and hard
[1:13:03] places
[1:13:07] the some seeds fall by the wayside
[1:13:12] the Lord help us to be that fertile
[1:13:17] Lord we want
[1:13:19] our hearts to be a place where your word
[1:13:21] can abides
[1:13:24] Lord we want to be a church that's
[1:13:26] lining up with the scriptures
[1:13:29] Lord that's our desire here this morning
[1:13:33] or as the preaching Goes Forth
[1:13:36] if there be any here that are sick Lord
[1:13:41] if there's anybody here that's bound
[1:13:43] with chains Lord we just ask that you
[1:13:45] would freeze
[1:13:50] we may be able to put the things in the
[1:13:52] past in the past and move forward
[1:13:55] Lord we know we have another opportunity
[1:13:58] with this new year opportunity
[1:14:01] Lord we expected you're coming last year
[1:14:06] but Lord we know if you didn't come last
[1:14:08] year then maybe you'll come this year
[1:14:12] Lord we want to be ready for your
[1:14:14] comments
[1:14:16] well that's why we're gathered here
[1:14:18] today
[1:14:20] is we want to see your word in power and
[1:14:23] demonstration
[1:14:26] we just asked that you would be with
[1:14:28] each and every one
[1:14:31] amen amen amen you may be seated amen
[1:14:35] and we just want to say thank you to the
[1:14:38] church for the other opportunity
[1:14:42] you know I had uh recently gone over to
[1:14:45] Africa on a mission's tripura
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:53] for me as an American
[1:14:56] being born here in America
[1:14:59] where we're so privileged
[1:15:02] we've got everything that we want
[1:15:05] we've got all the food that we want
[1:15:08] we've got the nice houses
[1:15:11] we've got the cars we have everything we
[1:15:14] want the entertainment
[1:15:17] and when you travel over there to do
[1:15:20] evangelism
[1:15:21] when you go to do Mission work
[1:15:24] and you see that the situation is
[1:15:27] different for them
[1:15:30] and how they still gather themselves
[1:15:32] together in church
[1:15:36] it gives you a different perspective
[1:15:41] I'm sure many of you have traveled over
[1:15:43] there or are from there
[1:15:46] and you know exactly what I'm talking
[1:15:48] about
[1:15:50] people may not have shoes on their feet
[1:15:54] but they'll walk four hours to go to
[1:15:56] church
[1:15:58] and all I can do
[1:16:00] I'm supposed to be there ministering to
[1:16:03] them
[1:16:04] and all I can say is God help me be more
[1:16:07] like them
[1:16:10] Lord help me have a burning desire in my
[1:16:13] heart
[1:16:14] where I would walk four hours barefooted
[1:16:19] just to make it to church
[1:16:23] just to make it to church on Wednesday
[1:16:26] they would walk the church on Friday
[1:16:29] night
[1:16:34] they would walk to church again on
[1:16:37] Sundays
[1:16:39] and I thought to myself do they have
[1:16:41] jobs
[1:16:43] because over in America we have jobs
[1:16:47] we have a hard time making it on just
[1:16:49] Wednesday
[1:16:54] and I thought what is the difference
[1:16:59] it changed me
[1:17:01] I have traveled many places
[1:17:04] but sometimes you just need a reminder
[1:17:09] what your burning desire is about
[1:17:13] what the result can be when you have the
[1:17:16] Holy ghosts
[1:17:18] right and that's why we gather ourselves
[1:17:20] together
[1:17:21] because Paul told the Ephesians he says
[1:17:25] as the day draws near gather yourselves
[1:17:27] together
[1:17:29] don't sit at home and just listening
[1:17:33] to tapes is good
[1:17:36] but you need to get yourselves together
[1:17:40] why because there is an atmosphere
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:44] if you get a lake of fire from over here
[1:17:47] and you get a look at flyer from over
[1:17:49] there
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:03] it can do something for your children
[1:18:07] it can do something for those around you
[1:18:12] so I was just very encouraged by going
[1:18:14] over to Africa
[1:18:18] I learned a lot about just preaching
[1:18:20] yeah
[1:18:22] how to get yourself out of the way
[1:18:27] that was important for me because
[1:18:29] it's not just important when you're
[1:18:32] behind the pulpit and preaching
[1:18:33] performance
[1:18:36] you apply those same principles to your
[1:18:39] everyday life
[1:18:41] and that was the important part for me
[1:18:45] because many times
[1:18:48] when I'm preaching I try to have
[1:18:50] everything planned out
[1:18:54] I try to to make sure that I know how
[1:18:57] the surface is going to go
[1:19:01] but sometimes that's not what God wants
[1:19:05] sometimes God wants to go another
[1:19:07] Direction
[1:19:09] it's many times in our lives we try to
[1:19:11] plan everything out
[1:19:14] we want to get married by this saying
[1:19:18] we want to have so many kids
[1:19:20] we want to make so much money
[1:19:23] and we let all those other distractions
[1:19:27] keep us from moving in the channel of
[1:19:30] the Holy Spirit
[1:19:33] you see it's not only the speaker that
[1:19:35] has to get himself out of the way
[1:19:38] but us as a congregation ourselves
[1:19:44] that we might be able to step into the
[1:19:46] channel of the holy spirit
[1:19:48] that we might be able to receive
[1:19:50] something from God
[1:19:52] so when you travel to Africa you see
[1:19:55] signs and wonders
[1:19:58] many times you see all these great
[1:20:00] things happening
[1:20:02] but when we come over to America
[1:20:05] we're not seeing those things anymore
[1:20:10] Alpha School
[1:20:11] so that's why I wanted to take this
[1:20:13] scripture
[1:20:14] if I were to take a title it would be
[1:20:17] Samson a type of the church
[1:20:23] does so well of setting the scene of
[1:20:26] Samson
[1:20:29] once a great man
[1:20:31] he was a judge of Israel
[1:20:34] and one day he he finds himself
[1:20:39] he's in this great Temple of Dagon
[1:20:43] it's a fish God
[1:20:46] and he finds himself blinded
[1:20:50] and he's in a temple that was shaped
[1:20:52] brother Branham said like a mushroom
[1:20:57] it was such a great Temple
[1:21:00] the scripture says there were 3 000 men
[1:21:03] and women on the roof
[1:21:08] brother Brandon also said there were
[1:21:11] people on the
[1:21:19] it was like the World Cup for them
[1:21:24] they had club seats to the World Cup and
[1:21:27] especially VIP because an enemy that had
[1:21:29] tormented them for so long
[1:21:32] they thought that they had victory over
[1:21:35] himself
[1:21:36] they said let's bring Samson out and
[1:21:39] make sure
[1:21:41] let's have him do a little couple tricks
[1:21:44] for us
[1:21:45] let's have him entertain us
[1:21:50] and brother Brandon types that right to
[1:21:52] the church
[1:21:54] he says back on the day of Pentecost the
[1:21:56] church had great power
[1:22:01] and then a church age comes
[1:22:03] and the devil starts like Delilah
[1:22:07] getting that church to lay down in their
[1:22:09] laps
[1:22:12] tries to warm up to them and say that
[1:22:15] you're you're we're friends now
[1:22:18] if you love me
[1:22:21] you'll tell me your secrets
[1:22:24] you see the devil's been trying to find
[1:22:26] what our secret is for thousands of
[1:22:28] years
[1:22:32] and in the Ephesians
[1:22:36] he cut off the secret
[1:22:38] he bound the church up Brothers
[1:22:42] but then the Holy Ghost moves on I don't
[1:22:44] understand another church age arises
[1:22:48] and it breaks the binds of the devil
[1:22:51] yeah
[1:22:54] and what does the devil do he uses the
[1:22:57] same tactic again
[1:23:00] Wesley oh yeah Wesley Avenue and they
[1:23:03] denominate
[1:23:04] and he binds them back up
[1:23:11] Samsung can't do anything down
[1:23:14] but he needed the Holy Ghost to come
[1:23:16] back
[1:23:20] so he could break those chords again
[1:23:23] and Delilah comes back a third time
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:27] she says you don't really love me
[1:23:30] if you loved me then you would tell me
[1:23:32] yourself
[1:23:36] and he starts getting closer to the to
[1:23:37] the promise
[1:23:39] says well if you just weave my Seven
[1:23:42] Locks I don't see too much
[1:23:44] he started tapping into the Revelation
[1:23:47] the just shall live by faith
[1:23:50] the Pentecostal age
[1:23:54] and what did they do found them right
[1:23:57] back and brother Branham says we must be
[1:24:00] careful church
[1:24:02] because Pentecost is going right back
[1:24:05] where it came from
[1:24:08] separate ourselves from that
[1:24:09] denominational system
[1:24:12] and what I saw with the contrast of
[1:24:15] going to Africa
[1:24:18] is that so many people here in America
[1:24:23] we're letting the claws of of Lady osia
[1:24:29] infiltrate Our Lives
[1:24:33] that's right so many times we treat our
[1:24:35] relationship with God
[1:24:38] like a New Year's resolution right
[1:24:43] yeah today's the eighth right
[1:24:46] how many of you set New Year's
[1:24:48] resolutions
[1:24:58] I want to make more money
[1:25:00] I'm gonna do this different than last
[1:25:02] year
[1:25:06] and today is
[1:25:09] probably half of us have already
[1:25:12] foreign
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:58] a burning desire yeah
[1:27:02] the scripture says in revelation 2.
[1:27:06] God says but I have something against
[1:27:08] you because you have lost your first
[1:27:10] love
[1:27:13] that was back in the first church age
[1:27:18] within 300 years of Jesus coming
[1:27:22] the church had already lost its first
[1:27:24] love
[1:27:28] but let me bring it down to ours listen
[1:27:30] listen
[1:27:31] remember back when you got first Saved
[1:27:36] remember the joy that was in your life
[1:27:40] but to tell somebody else about it
[1:27:44] you remember how you couldn't put this
[1:27:47] Bible down
[1:27:49] remember when you were reading the
[1:27:51] promises of God
[1:27:53] you're saying that promises
[1:28:06] you're excited you had a burning desire
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:11] but now we've cooled off
[1:28:17] the message had come out of Pentecost
[1:28:20] and I'm afraid what we're seeing today
[1:28:22] is that the message churches images
[1:28:31] the devil knows his tactics work
[1:28:36] so he's not going to change it
[1:28:38] but just because we call ourselves
[1:28:45] it does not mean that we're not subject
[1:28:48] to those Temptations
[1:28:52] so we start to nominating around the
[1:28:54] message
[1:28:56] I start saying if you don't believe it
[1:28:59] exactly like I do then you're going to
[1:29:00] hell
[1:29:03] if you don't listen to enough tapes then
[1:29:05] you're not safe
[1:29:08] if you're not a part of our club then
[1:29:10] then you can't come to us
[1:29:14] and brother Branham preached against
[1:29:16] this so hard
[1:29:24] but here we are sitting in message
[1:29:26] churches
[1:29:28] all across the world and we're going
[1:29:31] right back to the Catholic spirit
[1:29:35] so my warning to you
[1:29:37] is be careful
[1:29:42] I had to do some Reflections on my life
[1:29:44] over the last years
[1:29:48] you see when I've tried to preach
[1:29:51] something
[1:29:53] I was telling my dad this last night on
[1:29:56] the phone
[1:29:58] I said
[1:30:00] sometimes it's hard to find inspiration
[1:30:02] for a service
[1:30:05] sometimes it's a lot of work
[1:30:10] we need to pray for our preachers
[1:30:12] to pray for our pastors we need to pray
[1:30:16] for our deacons
[1:30:20] we need to pray for our parents
[1:30:22] because sometimes being a Christian is a
[1:30:25] lot of work basketball
[1:30:29] we're not always at the top of the
[1:30:31] mountain
[1:30:32] but I told them sometimes to find
[1:30:35] inspiration
[1:30:37] I just have to look at my life
[1:30:40] and I have to preach myself
[1:30:43] because I know I can find inspiration if
[1:30:45] I'm preaching to myself
[1:30:49] I don't know what your problems are
[1:30:51] but I know what my problems
[1:30:54] so if I can preach on my problems
[1:30:57] if I can find victory in my promise if
[1:31:01] God can do that for me
[1:31:10] that for sure
[1:31:15] so I'm not trying to offend anybody here
[1:31:18] this morning
[1:31:20] I'm just preaching it myself
[1:31:24] but don't get caught in that
[1:31:26] denominational Spirit
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:28] um
[1:31:30] that same Catholic spirit is trying to
[1:31:32] creep into the message
[1:31:39] our pastor's just been going through all
[1:31:41] of the the Seven Seals in the church
[1:31:42] ages
[1:31:47] exposes what the trail of the serpent is
[1:31:53] that complacent Catholic Spirit
[1:31:56] Catholic it's the spirit that wants to
[1:31:59] mix the good and the bad
[1:32:01] boy and if we can't see that Spirit now
[1:32:05] if we can't look at the world today and
[1:32:08] know what's going on
[1:32:11] then like Samson you are completely
[1:32:13] blind
[1:32:15] the church world has completely
[1:32:23] but I just thank God that we have a
[1:32:25] message
[1:32:28] to be able to expose
[1:32:32] God didn't leave us without weapons
[1:32:35] God didn't leave us without armor
[1:32:39] but he equipped us with a message
[1:32:50] amen praise the Lord
[1:32:55] so we see Samson and there's a way on
[1:32:58] Samsung
[1:32:59] and he finds himself in this predicament
[1:33:03] and brother Branham says and just once
[1:33:05] more Lord
[1:33:07] you'd like to pull it up it's uh 1963
[1:33:11] 1201.
[1:33:14] paragraph 43.
[1:33:18] and brother random says and that's the
[1:33:19] picture of the church
[1:33:21] he says I can read in the Bible of the
[1:33:24] church when it was first filled with the
[1:33:25] Holy ghosts
[1:33:28] free he says great signs and wonders
[1:33:30] accompanied their meanings
[1:33:33] we can remember just a few years ago 40
[1:33:36] 50 years ago
[1:33:44] when the church was filled with that
[1:33:46] same power conversation so listen to
[1:33:49] what he says he says but look at it
[1:33:52] today
[1:33:53] she stands stripped
[1:33:58] something has stripped her shoes
[1:34:02] the same thing that stripped Sampson
[1:34:06] all cause by listening to a woman that
[1:34:09] took him
[1:34:12] um
[1:34:14] well strip the church is
[1:34:17] listening to that organized woman
[1:34:20] situation that old Jezebel silver
[1:34:27] so the same thing that strip Sampson
[1:34:29] back there
[1:34:31] it's the same strategy that the devil is
[1:34:36] trying to get you to come to church on
[1:34:38] Sundays
[1:34:41] and have you sit in your chair right
[1:34:43] there
[1:34:44] and have you completely unaffected by
[1:34:47] what the word is saying
[1:34:52] think about maybe I should say that
[1:34:54] again
[1:34:56] if the devil wants you coming to church
[1:34:58] on Sunday
[1:35:01] sitting in that seat
[1:35:04] and be completely unaffected by the
[1:35:07] words
[1:35:13] I had to do a hard look at myself
[1:35:17] when I come to church when I prepared
[1:35:20] because
[1:35:22] or do I have all these other things on
[1:35:24] my mind
[1:35:26] am I thinking of work when I'm at church
[1:35:30] down in the South they call it fixing
[1:35:32] your tractor at church
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:38] because in the South you're driving your
[1:35:40] tractor it breaks down
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:44] you still go to church
[1:35:46] but the entire time you're trying to fix
[1:35:49] the tractor in your mind
[1:35:53] you're not hearing what the preacher's
[1:35:55] saying
[1:35:57] you're trying to call John Deere the
[1:35:59] next day
[1:36:00] John Deere you're trying to install the
[1:36:03] part
[1:36:05] you're trying to plan out how it's going
[1:36:07] to go
[1:36:10] completely miss a blessing from God
[1:36:13] did you that is greater than fixing your
[1:36:15] jack yep you're gone
[1:36:22] the very thing that Samson had been
[1:36:24] raised up to defeat brother Branham says
[1:36:26] I'm sure
[1:36:27] sorry this is remember
[1:36:33] the very thing that Samson was raised up
[1:36:36] to defeat La memories
[1:36:45] now remember this is that same Samson
[1:36:48] that was in Gaza Gaza
[1:36:51] and the Philistines tried to trap him
[1:36:54] Anthony
[1:36:57] and he woke up at midnight
[1:36:59] and he goes over to the gates
[1:37:03] and he plucks those Gates off the hinges
[1:37:07] it pulls out the posts and all the bikes
[1:37:12] weighing tons each yeah
[1:37:17] now what's amazing about it
[1:37:21] Samson was not a big man
[1:37:26] sometimes a little Samson can be five
[1:37:28] years old
[1:37:30] sometimes we need Samson's letter seven
[1:37:33] years old
[1:37:34] sometimes we need Samson's that are 17
[1:37:37] years old
[1:37:39] sometimes we need samsons that are not
[1:37:41] big men but foreign
[1:38:01] he doesn't need our our human strength
[1:38:05] he is the strength we look at Samson we
[1:38:09] we think of him as a symbol of strength
[1:38:14] but brother Brandon told us that he was
[1:38:16] just a shrimp of a man
[1:38:21] he probably looked a little shorter than
[1:38:23] me
[1:38:26] you could throw me around like a rag
[1:38:28] doll
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:31] but imagine me going and picking up
[1:38:32] those Gates
[1:38:39] over to the hill by by Hebron
[1:38:42] I don't know what this is in kilometers
[1:38:45] but he carried them 37 miles
[1:38:56] 37.6 miles
[1:39:02] sometimes we get winded walking from our
[1:39:04] house to the car
[1:39:10] but when that Holy Ghost comes
[1:39:13] impossible things are possible
[1:39:17] because that's the kind of God
[1:39:20] I don't care if you've got cancer
[1:39:25] impossible things are possible
[1:39:28] it doesn't matter what circumstances
[1:39:32] With God all things are possible we had
[1:39:36] a prophet to bring us back to Hebrews 13
[1:39:38] 8.
[1:39:40] that God is the same yesterday today and
[1:39:43] foreign
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:12] [Applause]
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:30] if the devil of anxiety anxiety
[1:40:38] he begins to get scared
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:41] just like those Philistines did come see
[1:40:44] Philistines when Samson came to them
[1:40:46] boundary
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:49] and they go to take him
[1:40:51] and he breaks the ropes
[1:40:54] and he picks up a Jawbone
[1:40:58] and he starts striking one by one
[1:41:02] a thousand Philistines
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:09] many times we think oh we're not
[1:41:11] equipped to be a good vessel for God
[1:41:16] I can't speak
[1:41:18] I've got dyslexia
[1:41:21] whatever it is
[1:41:25] I tell you one thing that when those
[1:41:28] Philistines heard the name Samson
[1:41:31] probably know something she got scary
[1:41:35] when those Philistine commanders saw
[1:41:37] Samson just whacking their guys down
[1:41:44] brother random said they started to
[1:41:47] scatter like roaches when the lights
[1:41:48] turned on foreign
[1:41:59] [Applause]
[1:42:17] out of here amen we don't just have to
[1:42:20] sit there as a defeated bride of Jesus
[1:42:21] Christ
[1:42:25] God's not coming back for a defeated
[1:42:27] bride
[1:42:29] he's coming back for a Victorious
[1:42:33] one that will take God at his promise
[1:42:37] said that God is honor bound to fulfill
[1:42:41] his problems
[1:42:43] my Bible says that he is faithful and
[1:42:46] true
[1:42:49] amen so where's the doubted
[1:42:53] I don't know what your situation is
[1:42:56] it doesn't matter what your situation is
[1:43:00] this morning
[1:43:03] we don't have to wait for later
[1:43:06] we don't have to wait 10 days like in
[1:43:08] the upper room
[1:43:10] so today you can receive your problems
[1:43:16] that's why brother Brandon would sing
[1:43:18] you'll only believe
[1:43:22] all you have to do is take God at his
[1:43:24] word and believe
[1:43:27] but we don't like it it's too simple
[1:43:30] we need to work ourselves up into
[1:43:32] something
[1:43:33] no it's God hiding himself in simplicity
[1:43:41] but the very thing that Samson had been
[1:43:43] raised up to my feet
[1:43:49] had defeated him lovely thank you and
[1:43:52] the Pentecostal church tonight
[1:43:54] maybe we say the the message church
[1:43:57] tonight
[1:44:05] the very thing she was raised up to
[1:44:07] defeat
[1:44:11] denominationalism
[1:44:14] she has grouped herself back into it
[1:44:17] again
[1:44:18] and her power is gone
[1:44:21] right exactly the power of the Lord has
[1:44:25] left
[1:44:26] I tell you that's not where we want to
[1:44:28] find ourselves
[1:44:31] but we need to reevaluate our lives
[1:44:35] we just need to grow closer to God
[1:44:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:43] brother Branham says later on foreign
[1:44:45] and I didn't copy the the verse I'm
[1:44:48] sorry
[1:44:49] it says
[1:44:52] you they're going to force you into it
[1:44:56] that's why I've been against this
[1:44:58] organizational system
[1:45:01] organization that's it I had to keep
[1:45:04] quiet about it
[1:45:08] but it's late enough now so you can know
[1:45:11] it's the truth
[1:45:15] see it's that exactly
[1:45:20] he exposes it right there he likes fuzzy
[1:45:24] 1963. I mean
[1:45:27] I had to keep quiet about it being the
[1:45:29] mark of the beast
[1:45:34] but it's late enough now
[1:45:36] tell you can know it's the truth
[1:45:42] sometimes we get too uh caught up in
[1:45:44] organized organizing our church
[1:45:48] organizations we get too caught up in in
[1:45:51] teaching doctrines that we forget the
[1:45:52] holy ghosts
[1:45:56] or sometimes we get so uh obsessed with
[1:46:00] preaching our agenda uh
[1:46:09] that we completely forget the Holy
[1:46:12] Spirit
[1:46:14] and brother Brandon was preaching in
[1:46:16] California one time
[1:46:17] he said if this is a small group in
[1:46:20] California
[1:46:22] could fully surrender to the holy ghosts
[1:46:26] it would turn California upside down by
[1:46:29] tomorrow
[1:46:31] [Applause]
[1:46:33] that's the kind of power that we have
[1:46:37] when you think of California did you
[1:46:39] think of holiness
[1:46:42] foreign
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:47:07] [Applause]
[1:47:13] how much more could it do for Brighton
[1:47:16] come on
[1:47:20] how much more could it do Forever Green
[1:47:24] if we could fully surrender ourselves
[1:47:28] we would quit trying to do things on our
[1:47:31] own
[1:47:32] forget all righteousness
[1:47:37] and all we do is rely on Jesus Christ
[1:47:42] amen
[1:47:58] [Applause]
[1:47:59] we have a promise today
[1:48:02] that there is going to be a bride
[1:48:04] Hallelujah
[1:48:09] the moon that's shown on the wall when
[1:48:10] brother Brandon was preaching the seven
[1:48:11] uh Church ages
[1:48:18] there originally was no light in the
[1:48:21] seventh age
[1:48:23] but God allowed a little light
[1:48:28] somebody's gonna be that light
[1:48:32] somebody is going to be an overcome
[1:48:35] and why would we leave that opportunity
[1:48:38] for somebody else
[1:48:40] but today we can stand up and we can say
[1:48:43] I am not light all right
[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:48:50] we're going back to the word
[1:48:53] if the scripture says it I believe it
[1:48:56] if the scripture says
[1:49:04] amen if if the message says speak to
[1:49:08] this sickness and it'll go
[1:49:11] then I believe it
[1:49:13] if the Bible says there's going to be a
[1:49:15] prize
[1:49:16] then I'm going to be that brother
[1:49:19] doesn't matter if there's one out of
[1:49:21] college
[1:49:30] I'll have to skip some of this
[1:49:35] brother random says this where should I
[1:49:37] Strength gone Samson 1959 foreign
[1:49:42] but the church is not an educational
[1:49:45] program
[1:49:47] it's for the power and demonstrations of
[1:49:51] the Holy Ghost demonstration
[1:49:56] we know we come to the house of the Lord
[1:49:58] for correction
[1:50:01] we know we come to the house of the Lord
[1:50:03] to learn Doctrine um
[1:50:07] but don't get so focused on that yes
[1:50:12] that you forget the Holy Ghost
[1:50:15] because that's where the power and
[1:50:18] demonstration is
[1:50:21] that's the whole reason that we're here
[1:50:24] brother Branham said I would rather have
[1:50:27] you wrong in your Doctrine foreign
[1:50:44] because it's the spirit they give it the
[1:50:47] life
[1:50:48] we can read the dead letter all we want
[1:50:50] to come out but if we don't have the
[1:50:54] spirit
[1:50:55] then we won't have the life
[1:50:59] that's why you can only go so far on
[1:51:01] your own
[1:51:03] um
[1:51:09] instead of life out of the spirit
[1:51:13] that would be like trying to take a
[1:51:15] baby's birth certificate
[1:51:19] and saying see this is the baby's life
[1:51:23] I have documentation that the baby's
[1:51:25] alive
[1:51:27] it was born on this date at this time
[1:51:31] it was this many pounds in this long
[1:51:35] kilogram you could see who the mother is
[1:51:37] and the father is
[1:51:39] a man but that is no proof of life
[1:51:43] but it's the spirit that giveth life
[1:51:47] so when that baby is born and the doctor
[1:51:49] gives it a good old-fashioned gospel
[1:51:51] speaking
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:56] spiritual and you hear that baby
[1:51:59] please
[1:52:14] let me uh decide where we're
[1:52:16] gonna go I'm gonna try to
[1:52:18] wrap it up before too long all right
[1:52:24] okay just once more Lord 63 no I'm
[1:52:27] coming foreign
[1:52:34] now the thing of it is
[1:52:36] the people are not willing to pay the
[1:52:39] price to get back
[1:52:44] those are powerful words
[1:52:48] because brother Brown has just exposed
[1:52:50] the Catholic Spirit foreign
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:53:07] and he says now the thing of it is that
[1:53:10] people are not willing to pay the price
[1:53:16] I believe that God just Remains the Same
[1:53:19] as he ever was but the thing of it is
[1:53:24] the people has got so wound up in the
[1:53:27] world
[1:53:28] and the world in them
[1:53:31] till they got just enough religion to
[1:53:34] make them miserable results
[1:53:39] now many times we try to put this
[1:53:41] Catholic Spirit foreign
[1:54:09] or we try to say that the the worldly
[1:54:11] things he says you're caught up in the
[1:54:12] world
[1:54:14] we think of all those Sinners out there
[1:54:17] in the world carousing
[1:54:21] we see uh we think of all those people
[1:54:23] in the clubs or or drinking um
[1:54:28] where brother Branham says here till
[1:54:30] they got just enough religion to make
[1:54:33] them miserable
[1:54:36] that means they're sitting here in
[1:54:38] church
[1:54:40] not enough to really turn loose to God
[1:54:46] and not give your whole heart unto him
[1:54:52] but enough I see listen to what he says
[1:54:56] yeah I go to church
[1:54:59] I enjoy good singing and clapping hands
[1:55:05] yeah I love that but when it comes right
[1:55:09] down to putting what you say you believe
[1:55:11] makes a practice
[1:55:15] and willing to confess the wrong yes
[1:55:19] they don't do it
[1:55:22] just isn't there
[1:55:24] they don't have it
[1:55:27] well that's real conviction
[1:55:30] that's what we need
[1:55:33] we've long left that a long time ago
[1:55:37] prayer confession
[1:55:40] conviction a conviction we've swapped it
[1:55:43] for emotions
[1:55:50] that's the reason there's no holding
[1:55:53] tights
[1:55:55] because there's nothing to hold them
[1:56:02] young people if you want to be held
[1:56:06] you need to get a hold of the one that's
[1:56:08] going to hold you
[1:56:11] growing up in the message church is not
[1:56:14] going to hold you
[1:56:16] I grew up in a youth group
[1:56:20] and very very few are still in the
[1:56:23] church
[1:56:25] why because there was nothing that held
[1:56:27] them
[1:56:29] but something that came out of the same
[1:56:31] youth group the membership
[1:56:34] we were taught the same thing
[1:56:37] and there's people with different
[1:56:39] results
[1:56:41] what's the difference
[1:56:44] you have to have an anchor
[1:56:47] you have to have an absolute
[1:56:50] this message and this scripture is our
[1:56:55] absolutely
[1:56:57] and don't get that Catholic Spirit of
[1:56:59] trying to divide it
[1:57:02] foreign
[1:57:12] [Applause]
[1:57:25] but if you sit in here like a young
[1:57:27] person
[1:57:29] and you get just enough religion
[1:57:32] but you're not willing to give God
[1:57:34] everything
[1:57:36] then you are going to be miserable
[1:57:39] that goes for anyone
[1:57:42] but especially the young people
[1:57:44] if your heart is with Delilah
[1:57:47] and you're going to try to be a judge of
[1:57:50] Israel
[1:57:51] you are going to be a miserable Samson
[1:57:54] miserable
[1:58:03] that Catholic Spirit breaking into the
[1:58:05] message
[1:58:07] we see so many preachers
[1:58:10] I was at a Minister's meeting one time
[1:58:14] that had to do with interracial marriage
[1:58:19] which is a very very sticky subject
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:24] and there was a message preacher hello
[1:58:30] that thought he knew more than brother
[1:58:32] Branham
[1:58:36] and he says the interracial marriage
[1:58:38] does not matter
[1:58:41] God only created love
[1:58:46] God in his Divine wisdom
[1:58:50] created a bond called love
[1:58:54] and nothing can separate that
[1:58:57] God is love
[1:58:59] so if God is in it
[1:59:02] then don't let man rip it apart
[1:59:07] that sounds pretty good right yes
[1:59:12] well what if I decide
[1:59:15] I'm gonna go out there and love a harlot
[1:59:22] you see over here
[1:59:24] the Catholic Spirit Catholic started out
[1:59:27] as a white horse
[1:59:30] goes to a red horse and a black horse
[1:59:33] and a pail
[1:59:35] we're living in the age
[1:59:38] where they're trying to mix everything
[1:59:40] up
[1:59:44] your pastor is the only one that I've
[1:59:46] ever heard
[1:59:49] that has preached on interracial
[1:59:51] marriage
[1:59:53] and tied it back to the Catholic church
[1:59:56] because that's exactly what I was
[1:59:58] telling this brother
[2:00:01] is God likes variety
[2:00:04] he doesn't want everybody to get all
[2:00:06] mixed up
[2:00:07] he doesn't want to throw bread horse
[2:00:09] mixing with a
[2:00:11] donkeys
[2:00:14] because once that mule is born
[2:00:19] and you can never breed it back
[2:00:25] amen
[2:00:26] but they're trying to mix all these
[2:00:28] worldly ideas
[2:00:30] I tried to mesh them with the message
[2:00:34] so now what do you find well that's got
[2:00:38] to be just brother Brandon's opinion
[2:00:40] so then what is brother Brandon's
[2:00:42] opinion and what's God's opinion foreign
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:57] my message says that we get there 30 45
[2:00:59] minutes before church
[2:01:03] he's the message says we should be I
[2:01:06] can't wait to get to church
[2:01:09] do we believe the message or do we not
[2:01:11] believe the message
[2:01:19] remember I'm just preaching it myself
[2:01:34] quit worrying about what the person on
[2:01:36] the other Pew is gonna think
[2:01:42] the scriptures lay out exactly what we
[2:01:45] have to do
[2:01:46] if you find yourself in the wrongs
[2:01:50] don't sit there ashamed and do nothing
[2:01:57] amen
[2:01:59] amen amen why is it so hard because it's
[2:02:02] too difficult I understand do you have a
[2:02:04] pride
[2:02:05] you hear what other people think about
[2:02:07] us
[2:02:26] please
[2:02:30] but you see the Catholic spirit is
[2:02:32] coming to the message
[2:02:42] where people like to
[2:02:44] did you hear them
[2:02:50] and that devil likes to get in and
[2:02:51] church
[2:02:54] not because it hinders
[2:02:59] but it hinders the person in the back
[2:03:01] where God is dealing with them and they
[2:03:03] don't want to come to the Friends
[2:03:08] and instead of going with our Christian
[2:03:10] brother in prayer together
[2:03:14] fighting together again
[2:03:18] Satan gets our our guns trained on each
[2:03:21] other
[2:03:23] where people are going around saying oh
[2:03:26] did you hear this person's doing this
[2:03:27] inside
[2:03:34] we should be working together as a team
[2:03:42] We Are One
[2:03:45] finger can't look at the the toes and
[2:03:47] say oh you're no goodness
[2:03:52] the fingers ain't going nowhere
[2:04:06] so we find Samson there hello
[2:04:12] try to bring this too close
[2:04:17] 10 or 15 minutes
[2:04:22] so now we find Samson here
[2:04:25] he's been made fun of yeah
[2:04:29] and there's a little boy leading him
[2:04:31] around
[2:04:33] he says lead me to those posts
[2:04:36] because Samson had a revelation
[2:04:41] that God had once moved in his life
[2:04:46] Seven Locks that he wants
[2:04:49] me
[2:04:53] and he had an idea hello
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:05:12] he
[2:05:19] said come and fill me one more time
[2:05:38] give me a burning disciples
[2:05:41] [Music]
[2:05:43] give me another chance
[2:05:53] many people like to say that Samson had
[2:05:55] a breakthrough right there
[2:05:58] a breakthrough is a great thing
[2:06:02] just imagine those big great Gaza walls
[2:06:08] and if you're gonna break through
[2:06:11] then you would need a very big battery
[2:06:16] many times that's like our prayers
[2:06:20] Lord help us one more time
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:26] and then the devil hears it in hell
[2:06:30] oh was that our gates just shaking
[2:06:34] another prayer comes
[2:06:39] I think I heard a crack in the door
[2:06:43] just once more Lord
[2:06:46] and one of these days you hit it enough
[2:06:48] times
[2:06:51] [Applause]
[2:06:58] but Samson didn't only have a
[2:07:00] breakthrough
[2:07:02] you see when that strength became to
[2:07:04] come it became to come back on Samson
[2:07:09] and he felt the strength in his body
[2:07:13] and he began to push on those pillars
[2:07:19] I like to say he not only had a
[2:07:21] breakthrough
[2:07:23] but he had a destroyed through he like
[2:07:27] you in a demolition because we're not
[2:07:29] looking just to break through their
[2:07:31] Gates
[2:07:36] it doesn't matter if there's three
[2:07:38] thousand Devils
[2:07:41] we're not looking to break through into
[2:07:43] the temples
[2:07:47] we've got a God that's big enough
[2:07:50] we can push on those pillars
[2:07:58] [Applause]
[2:08:01] all we have to do is submit our hands
[2:08:04] and we say Lord use me just once more
[2:08:11] then we'll have it destroyed
[2:08:15] will demolish everything
[2:08:21] First John 3 and 8.
[2:08:24] it says for this purpose the Son of God
[2:08:27] was manifested
[2:08:30] that he might destroy the works of the
[2:08:34] devil I think he did please reserve for
[2:08:37] the devil not break the work of the
[2:08:39] devil
[2:08:42] if something is broken it can be fixed
[2:08:47] if something is destroyed it cannot be
[2:08:49] fixed
[2:08:54] amen
[2:08:55] amen
[2:08:59] for this purpose was the son of God
[2:09:02] manifested
[2:09:04] that he might destroy the works
[2:09:12] that means this year no more gossiping
[2:09:16] brother Foster the critique
[2:09:19] [Applause]
[2:09:22] no more
[2:09:26] amen
[2:09:28] no more showing up with a bad attitude
[2:09:31] [Music]
[2:09:33] no more grumbling about the person
[2:09:35] across the way please
[2:09:39] but let's spend this year building our
[2:09:41] team
[2:09:43] if you want to win in the World Cup
[2:09:46] you can't just have Messi
[2:09:50] you don't have to have a championship
[2:09:52] team to keep the champion
[2:09:56] what's happening
[2:09:57] we need each and every one of you
[2:10:00] sometimes we might need your prayers
[2:10:02] sometimes we might need your prayers
[2:10:08] that's why we need prayer meetings
[2:10:14] so what are we really focusing on
[2:10:17] what are we really focused on
[2:10:22] we're worried about Ronaldo over on
[2:10:24] another team and what he's going to do
[2:10:28] oh who's the best
[2:10:30] you know who's the best uh minister in
[2:10:33] the message
[2:10:35] who's got the biggest church
[2:10:51] [Applause]
[2:11:15] [Applause]
[2:11:20] [Applause]
[2:11:36] [Applause]
[2:11:39] happened in the book of Acts
[2:11:42] and in our church today
[2:11:56] one more uh
[2:12:00] one more quote Daniel
[2:12:03] perfect Faith 1963.
[2:12:05] that's zero eight two five e
[2:12:09] beginning of the message paragraph 10.
[2:12:14] he says remember I'm not immune to
[2:12:16] Temptations
[2:12:19] He says I've got to overcome that
[2:12:21] because
[2:12:23] don't think you're going to be Samson
[2:12:25] there pushing down those pillars with no
[2:12:27] struggle right
[2:12:32] being a Christian is not for the faint
[2:12:34] of heart
[2:12:37] you might feel like you're on a mountain
[2:12:39] today
[2:12:41] but don't worry
[2:12:45] and the same victory that you have today
[2:12:48] take it to Monday
[2:12:55] but we're not immune to Temptations
[2:12:57] brother Brandon said I've got to
[2:12:59] overcome them
[2:13:01] when I look back and I see something
[2:13:03] like this is
[2:13:06] a convention
[2:13:09] where the church is working together
[2:13:12] where the church begins to have Unity
[2:13:15] within itself
[2:13:20] they begin to pray with one another they
[2:13:23] begin to respond to the words
[2:13:34] they begin to support the the other
[2:13:37] ministers
[2:13:41] he says when I look back and see
[2:13:43] something
[2:13:45] listen to what he does with it he says I
[2:13:48] put it right back in the devil's face
[2:13:52] and I say what about that
[2:14:49] we have to realize the potential of a
[2:14:52] moment
[2:14:55] if you think of Jesus we came into the
[2:14:58] temple and he started teaching
[2:15:01] prophecies for 400 years were pressing
[2:15:05] into that moment
[2:15:10] and when Jesus said this day this
[2:15:13] scripture is fulfilled
[2:15:17] all the pressure
[2:15:19] of all of those prophecies
[2:15:23] were bound up in a moment
[2:15:28] those Pharisees and Sadducees did not
[2:15:30] feel it
[2:15:33] but In Heaven There was rejoicing
[2:15:37] because prophecy had come to pass
[2:15:41] in that moment
[2:15:45] so I'm asking you today
[2:15:49] we have more prophecies
[2:15:53] there's gonna be Christians realize who
[2:15:56] they really are
[2:15:58] and when you can catch that Revelation
[2:16:04] I'm driving a stake down
