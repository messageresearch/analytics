the sun is rising there's a very good [Music] news as we're still standing we're going to maximize the time by reading the word of the Lord we're going to read in Mark chapter [Music] 16 first verse to the sixth verse amen to maximize the time I'm going to read it in French and the rest could follow along in English forant amen just uh John chapter 19 just uh the 19th verse amen amen amen let's pray gracious father it's with a lot of Joy this morning to know that we're calling upon a real God just see from yesterday how you've blessed us with your word and you've given us the courage and the strength to rise up early this morning as that lady in the Bible to be Witnesses at the rising of the sun today bless the sacrifices of your people may nobody go back empty you who Resurrected may you give them real peace in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless the word give us the anointing in this little time we want to do things just as the prophet did give us that Grace Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated Shalom I want to talk on the topic of Shalom or peace God is Jesus is resurrected shalom shalom means Jesus is resurrected amen amen shalom shalom means peace be unto you why peace if you have peace you have comfort when there is peace shom when we tell somebody shalom it's just like we read in the Bible the disciples were scared they were afraid of what happened to Jesus they didn't understand how such a great man could have been taken to the Grave and Jesus knowing that they had they had fear he came to tell them when he resurrected this is God Jesus's first words he said shalom shalom and me this morning I tell you shalom shalom May there not may your souls not be trouble may there not be troubles he who took your place he tells you shalom shalom peace be unto you amen amen and now this morning as we just read we see the first time God created in Genesis he created the sun it was the son to give us life in the natural that was the first time the sun rose it gave us a natural life resurrected it's the morning of the first day of the week the woman went to see Jesus while the sun was Rising brother brandham says that day the same Sun that God created in genis Rises up on this day now in given double life because it continues to give natural life but now this time the rising of the sun there is a good news Rising that called Jesus Christ is resurrected you know for him to resurrect at geeman the Bible says that oh brother brandom says that Jesus Christ died more at than at calary and that the father had left the body of Jesus now in the day of Resurrection the holy ghost that is the father went into the body of Christ it quickened that body and when it quickened that body that's what provoked the resurrection amen amen now as human beings born in sin when we accept Christ we receive the Holy Ghost and it's that very holy ghost that re resurrects us even if we die the Holy Ghost will take that body no matter where it is Quicken that body and we will resurrect that's why brother brandham says in that message what was the Holy Ghost given for uh what was the the Holy Ghost given for brother Bram says in our Christianity the proof that the God we worship is a real God it was that he died and resurrected every other religion their strength but our religion it's a real Rel because he left an empty grave amen amen those Muslims are in their Karam but they worship an imaginary God but now brother brandom says here there can be two men one of them just uh just extremely both of them justly one of them can be good he can do good works he can do but except that man has eternal life in him he will never in Resurrection he cannot do it there is nothing there to ra there is nothing to bring him up there is no life so you see my dear brothers my dear sister except a man be born again was back into this Kingdom I'm going to skip and go a little faster now now if you just got human life enough see that lives in pleasure he's dead where she's alive you can rise you may be the most popular girl in school you might be most popular girl in the the game on your you might be best dress in the country you might be pred you may be best dressed woman in the country you may be best you may be an idol to your husband you might be all those things that's wonderful but sister unless you have the Holy Ghost in you with his eternal life at the hand of this road you are finish and I don't care what you look like or how are or how unop or popular you are pretty or how you are if you got eternal life you live forever amen amen if God if Jesus was resurrected because the father quickened that body and the only thing that can resurrect us that eternal life that is the Holy Ghost amen amen without that we can't even speak of the Resurrection now my beloved brothers and sisters sisters as brother brandham just said you could be pretty well built but if the Holy Ghost is not within you you're done for no matter how many times you come to church when that moment comes won't be resurrected so you have to seek the Holy Ghost because it's the most important thing here brother Brenham says in the rising of the Sun in the rising of the sun paragraph 15 okay now how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine it doesn't matter to the devil are you follow no matter how religious you are no matter how right your do that doesn't bother the devil if you don't have that life that resurrected Jesus you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you've belonged to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again therefore if God raised up Jesus from the dead did he raise and if that power comes in you Christians won't be afraid of that in this day where we're observing the resurrection of Christ it has to give a a certain courage to know that even death doesn't have power over and you can't be afraid of death in fact Christians don't die Christians change Dimensions it's better over there than here glory to God now when that was going on the women when they went to see Jesus at the grave they saw an angel who told them who are you looking for they were seeking somebody thinking that he was dead he's not dead he alive forever more here is where they bury them they saw the evidence of the resurrection of Christ and today the ma the fact that you have the Holy Ghost it's also proof of the Resurrection rapidly I'm going to read something mess shalom in that message shalom okay Shalom brother Bram says in paragraph 18 now my my text for this morning is a old woman shalom shalom shalom shalom in the Hebrews means peace and that's what I said to the church this morning shalom shalom that peace in finishing it's called which mean God's peace Jesus said don't be afraid don't think on what happened to Jesus yes he was dead but he was dead for our good it's that for our good he died because by his death we have life he said as I live you live also now there's a little quote that I wanted to close on that uh that quote will really KO the devil and be ready to receive that blessing that I'm about to pronounce amen amen thank you for this day because the Sun the rising of the sun it gives us life in the natural and it announces that the Son of God Jesus Christ is now the Conqueror he resurrected in our hearts mess and I'm hearing this message perfect Faith amen amen I'm going to read it in French and you can read it in English I'm in paragraph 81 and I'm going to finish and I want to pray all together as we are enjy that death can't scare us anymore illnesses can't scare us anymore trials can't shake us anymore why because Christ gave us that Victory and this morning we're going to ask he's given us the Holy Ghost for our eternal life and everything that we need of is in this is found in the Holy Ghost so now if you need healing the Holy Ghost within you can heal if you have a problem that goes beyond your understanding the Holy Ghost within you will console you amen amen there's nothing to be afraid of brother brandom said in that message perfect faith I like this and I'm going to give you a testimony a brother in Africa he's suffering he fell ill and he fell ill to a cardiac problem and they went to the doctor they examine the heart they saw that the heart was inflated or SL the brother called me he said brother I'm dying here he's saying I'm dying here because my heart is so swollen I don't know what to do I I don't have any money I don't know what to do I told him my brother so long as Christ Resurrected from the dead I don't see why this problem has to trouble you I told him Shalom may peace be in your heart the devil committed a mistake he gave you a lot of Doubt as but as you're speaking to me and you know he just finished talking to me and not even 10 minutes passed I was meditating on the word and I fell upon this quote and I wanted to read this quote Oh I read him the quote and I told him to read this quote with you and my brother brothers since that brother read that quote ever since I read that quote with him after some days the brother went back to the [Applause] hospital the doctor said you have to redo that exam after a week brothers and sisters our God is real and I'm telling you that this message is real there's nothing to be afraid of be strong your God as he left the grave empty it's to show you that the god that you worship he's a strong God he is the master of circumstances he has everything in his hand nothing is impossible listen to brother Brandon even when you don't have faith hallelujah it's not a problem this morning we're going to discover that even if you don't have the faith because some people are scared and they don't have faith listen to brother Brandon the great physician is here let me drink some water that anointing can listen to brother BR the great physician who is here who said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the S they shall recover how many believe that glory to God he says and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart and believe but he didn't finish his thought now listen to this if he could create squirrels who has no way at all or don't believe are you with me squirrels can't believe it wasn't on the squirrel's faith that they were created but if he could create these squirrels that didn't believe he says they don't have any faculty at all brother it's my own faith that goes my faith in what he challenged me to ask he challenged me to ask it and I received his challenge in obedience to his word I asked it and it appeared God in heaven knows that's true can't he also heal the sick listen to brother Brandon he said if he could create squirrels that didn't even have Fai who did have faculty at all and it's my own faith that brought these squirrels into existence can that same God heal brother brandom says if he could raise me with a faith this way even for the people are you with me I want this morning somebody to go back being truly delivered if he's resurrected to bless somebody and somebody who's ready even if you don't have use brother bram's face listen to brother BR if he could lift me with a face even for the people even if they can't climb to that bracket if they can't
