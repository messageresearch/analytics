we hear it's already a joy [Music] therefore this morning pastor foster has given me his pulpit uh we were very very blessed by his welcoming [Music] and we felt really at home nothing is lacking um and probably i'll try to exalt it a little bit i tried everything when i was thinking of pastor foster's church [Music] but i saw that god was straining me from all of those that's why i thought that probably you so it might look like a teaching but actually it's an exhortation i think that the sound is good enough [Music] of the sound system back home we used to be shouting all the time uh we're speaking to a church but israel is we oh we're talking in the open air this is a circumstance but here it seems as if like i don't have to shout yes but also like i don't like to uh to preach like a priest from the catholic church who come and profess at the university also as if i was a professor from the university i don't like it could you make them pretty my god helped it is my job [Music] people i had time to see him right yes uh [Music] a [Music] pastor dick in france he was consecrating a wedding or blessing a wedding in that wedding he was talking about the insert uh uncertainty of uh civilization brings along many many other issues like in social life [Music] a we're not here just as if people who are hopeless or helpless the problem the difficulty despite of what may happen issues and hardships but we know that we have god problems you have an issue come along the pastor will pray for you er sauron solution you will have a solution in your personal cell problem can affect the solution there's no one problem that does not have a solution question [Applause] better among the public probably the lack of papers lack of papers to get a new nationality or citizenship in the bible paul had a roman citizenship for him to preach the gospel hello come with hitler [Music] [Music] it may seem like as if i'm just spinning around wasting time but i know that people have issues i'm attending today i have a bunch of requests that my people have requested brought me along with it to sunset sabine canyon and burnham tabernacle uh and see and to do the problem therefore a people is always a needy people the company part of uv regardless of where you live yeah the problem with the now um there's always issues in that way comfort regardless of all the comfort you might have right there will always be a problem no someday we human beings know some of this human beings therefore we have issues as men and therefore if it's not money and probably it's another thing probably if it's not work it's probably marriage another one the problem we have problem my impulsively problem foolish energy but for all those issues we have to bring them to god and he will give you the solution amen amen [Music] the pastor had showed me that but i'll speak with the technician i don't say that i wasted time but as a pastor i always carry people's heart burdens with me okay

spread the christ in the real past temple if anyone has not the spirit of christ is not of him 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of the previous present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory we shall be revealed in us for the creature was made subject to vanity for the earnest expectation verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by the by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope as i said that i'll be exhorting a little bit this morning here while the during the time that the pastor has allotted to me manifestation defeats i'll speak of the fullness of time and the manifestations of the sons of god okay that's what i'll be speaking about this morning mr i believe that it's a great teaching i will not be able to cover everything this morning as i got something that can have us talk this morning hello um first we will find in the scriptures in the book of ephesians [Applause] therefore we're not just a kind of people who are just here in this message to begin with it's a great message rolled out the plan of redemption to bring us back therefore the plan of redemption was put in place because god has to bring us back because we were his children right therefore when the devil in his angel uh two third actually when they fell yes when he felt the [Music] because with the devil he didn't know he he there's nothing to give win back me but man is a son of god wait lord maurice satan unfounded he is a child of fontaine the great fountain amen amen a less salty the the granted spring and therefore he came out of the great spirit logos and if god took a body called logos and when you look at god in that form he looks like a man he has hands like a man he he was not god yet he was just a great spirit depending on how his creation will have to move forward therefore the first day you say they let light be they have the truth let's say he said on the second day but i know that god is very serious but there at that time he became more serious therefore he said let's make amends and child is really his choice of a child of god is god himself he has the potential that god hates he has the potential that god has amen he has the power that god has come visiting her therefore when you say you don't have to look down at yourself you are sons of god amen you are sons of god amen amen [Applause] fundamental foreign fundamental from foundation for faith i don't know if those are projects i believe paragraph 12 who ventures in front of you that the man is the son of god important regardless regardless of no matter what statement is in front of you he is still a son of god be important regardless if he is sinful regardless of how far he has fallen back house of his fallen son men separated wonderful therefore adam was a son of god therefore when he failed god has left heaven it's at that time that he probably gave the promise of a messiah amen amen continue therefore the plan of redemption carried on may take command but adam was how adam have a total priesthood [Applause] you know from the beginning god didn't name the animals he gave that responsibility exactly can we give a japanese when a tree was moving and you would say like you know stop there and the tree would stop [Applause] when the wind was shaking dished usage then but the man was not falling the man was not growing you didn't know that today we have gray hair we have one of the brothers before then we didn't have any brains what's the second pressure is that this is the cause of sin on the view of yeah we but god didn't leave men alone he had made a promise the face is the lafayette they which are the son of the woman will come and bruise the head of the serpent ah man amen was laid out for six thousand years six million data there's six seven six thousand years economy now and when the plane was moving forward about two thousand years ago and the thing that filled this job and the devil is corrupted you follow i know they are victory and they forgot that they destroyed everything uh truly pressure they got destroyed taken away it says only remain only nowhere in his children here comes him and afterwards and the world carried on cut camilla a prayer four thousand years afterwards and the lord had come along it's on him that the plan of redemption was based upon a fair expediency then he was coming to do the atonement that totally didn't experience the fullness of the atonement that's how he was born from a virgin amen amen he was bringing back the men to where he was before he came so that the man can become back what he was don't did you take the hardship of a man jesus nope did you just say that this is not a man no he led jesus he said jesus is god said your pharaoh is god made flesh amen do you say amen to that we becoming like god because we are with children but we are god media religion but god is still god amen amen so i want to say that just because so if you want to make a stem statement somewhere you you do not get confused well yes amen 4 000 from the previous 2000 years god had only dealt with the jews er enough patriot african cell on the nation he didn't deal with no man from the gentiles mechanism but jesus went jesus christ and the jew rejected him and god also started calling us gentiles now come and say from this church that started there in pentecost you know or from the upper room japanese god has to call a gentile through this dispensation of grace that when jesus said that the holy spirit will come and will fulfill his promise amen amen easier to call his church okay it's a through this holy spirit that god wills couldn't prefer you can only do it through the holy spirit without the holy spirit successful all that you'll do is wrong with dancing because god gives you your soul respiratory whatever your spirit shows you what you have to do yes you follow it the spirit that was in him escape with it amen amen today with it amen you say amen today or dreams because he said to the jews i said this to his disciples do not go outside of jerusalem not go outside of jerusalem it will remain in jerusalem i will send you prisons in power certainly then that and when the holy spirit will come then it shows the comments of faith the things that is [Applause] issues all diseases except coronavirus uh maladie all diseases self-ashes except uh hiv no no telemalada [Applause] gone my belongings there's no more time that'll be played with the bible the apocalypse when they met the angel of our revelation so another mighty angel sounded this year that was coming down from heaven with a rainbow upon his head with his feet like with a small open book hey that there will be no more time no time shall be no more the time shall be no more okay [Music] all the mystery shall be finished and therefore time is gone there's no time time is no more escape you say amen today is no more amen amen and i am talking to you this morning there are plenty there therefore the fullness of time amen amen therefore when there's no more time i want you to follow carefully i'm not going to preach longer ah amen amen amen you see that when time is normal when we get to the fullness of time of probably speaking about the fullness of time amen amen god has elected us for the foundation for this child to become like him if he has any work for this child to come and help him alone these are children in all those areas i think for firsthand children of a man be since hallelujah if the father was this or that america he would want he would not want his children to be just lazy man um you follow women's shoes you follow je pang le de la manifestation de vista i'm talking about the manifestation of the sounds of god there are plenty to determine hey i'm talking about the fullness of time wait [Applause] amen you really wanted that adam to resemble him or to be like him hey and it's true that adam was like him it was for the purpose that the man to become back what he was if he was walking on the waters in focus it requires that when the plane of redemption comes to the end of the world jesus and he carried our sickness you [Music] because when paul came the church has already fallen he was already hello let it it's the place in places where we were leaving the food that we were eating and some became white lizards the sun became black some have become this and very handy [Music] therefore god was calling us alone amen this is a message to call the gentiles and william branham is a perfect messenger is a perfect messenger absolutely and i've heard people say that brother brother is not our absolute carefully what kind of madness he is our absolutes absolutely he is our absolute amen amen because that will because out that gives me so much joy hallelujah hallelujah and they were coming for he's not and [Applause] say my turn this morning feel that you saved say my time this morning you feel that you are healed remember like it is on even really it's not the pastor's faith we will see that for the pastor yes also the pastor's family he has his gifts but it's you that have to pull the gift that's right [Music] this morning [Applause] ah man amen why do i have [Music] [Applause] he's a major prophet second prophet he is a major prophet [Applause] satan prophet muhammad he is a major prayer he's a major prophet to the father plain the mystery there's a lot of mysteries because all was finished amen amen [Music] you know that very very well that he is the forerunner the second village is the second coming of the lord jesus it is the past is that greater than moses he is greater than moses he is the past daniel he is greater than daniel where you little depressed is column this you say this pill of fire [Applause] the women of us that i have elder since my childhood amen amen [Music] interpreting the fullness of the scriptures therefore i availed god [Applause] [Music] jesus said like you know the greater in the in the in the kingdom but the least meaning the last one is will be greater than everyone else are they not baptist with john the baptist donk let me see a teller hey and the man himself is utilizing a memphis they're using the same very same body [Applause] they are in the very same body ah man amen i am pleased to offer it to him oh man amen oh man amen therefore is our absolute amen amen can i move forward now because my subject is the fullness of time and manifestation and the manifestations of the sons of god amen amen therefore when time gets to its fullness when time is no more said um that you might put them together one time shall we come to his fullness amen amen that he might gather together things in christ selkisson and yourself both which are in heaven you see that you follow essence what are things that are in heaven say chris the women it's christ himself david all things are the angels that were in heaven christians christ has brought them down if we went to know and now the things that are in heaven it is the christ in heaven and everything that was in heaven but now the things that are on earth say william it's william brennan a new kid and us who are here jacques revelations i believe in christ revealing his own word where your sister has seen a vision where the pillow fire was coming down hey a grandpa well brother i believe that you also do have one hello illness and they will go follow him they will all get into the pillars therefore was lifted up in the pyramid now we have the zones where they were angels they're certainly in this in that class and there that's where he was given the seven seals message i believe that you say amen today that's where time was swallowed in eternity and jesus coming with eternity i want you to understand the things very clearly william branagh william branham avec with us eternity the lord jesus christ alexis angela with his angel with his pillow fire initially [Applause] don't we can probably do this but it is a time it's an additional time and a goddess abort this time from eternity that's why you can see a man stopping a bulls you can see a man stopping the the the stone don't say it it's a part of eternity that is borrowed amen can you say amen to them there's an eternal thing in us what i'm saying in the stage of a perfect man he says that john cena started what i'm teaching in the stage of a perfect man says [Music] a church in which god is living jesus is living in amen amen the same woman and come and say i live let me start reading now escape you say amen to that no no no in my teaching this is i am we are living in the fullness of time now let them tell me time is no more amen amen in a borrowed time message the greece can you solve but this type of church that we are say deep the gliese cannot serve this type of church that we are say take this allah this church says coming impossible it's not like any other church super complex it's not like the pentecostal church we cannot die no no we cannot feed we cannot feed huh let's put this jesus christ we cannot feed the bread of jesus christ every clip decoratives and we forever with the pentacles sir because with this message separately tradition to lead it are you an authentic expiation to air of the true genuine atonement amen amen are you authentic expiation to a genuine uh uh atonement mechanism but what is that atonement christ is the crisis person are [Music] it's the truth no no boy pascal the holy spirit you know from senior center sweden teaches the holy spirit he says okay the only paragraphs 50 is a proportion to the word the shadow of the holy spirit is a weak failure small okay okay the westlake in uh westley's scientific [Music] and the shadow becomes a little bit greater may allah [Music] very small but not as much but when brother bottom comes it's the fullness of the world it's the third pool of christ coming our lord and therefore so with the things you say with the seals amen amen not resent the spirit our holy spirit celeb person the christian is the person of christ you say amen today man i'll call you even better i'll call you even better a victory of sentence breath with the holy spirit there is a little world like that they fall on the ground i don't know it's a drinking uh baby they it has to be the opening of the seals amen amen pool they are the third pool amen amen premier pool not the first pool is not the mother it's the healing of the sickness address so-called i'm saying the first puller that attaches to the body ah man amen and the second ball is and when you have a part of the stealth [Applause] there's no more is [Applause] redemption [Music] [Applause] [Applause] god himself [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] amen amen amen amen amen you see the holy spirit that people had along the edges jean velez john had the holy spirit why was he crying what was he right again he was even saying that we lost see personally if nobody takes the book sometimes we are all lost amen amen that means that it was not a fulfilled or complete what they had received it required [Applause] therefore you took the book amen amen they counted this song and when it comes down like the mighty angel hey man amen hey amen amen [Applause] [Music] because in the exposition of church ages barbara when he speaks of the messenger he says that the last message the seventh you shall do two things the first [Music] that shall bring back literally literally literally sanu from that takes us live what they said on the voice of the seven times the opening of the seals he takes us it brings us back back to the garden of eden [Applause] oh man amen [Applause] this is the manifestation that i am talking about us teaching performance so at times we forget no no no no we don't have to forget that here where we are you summon the face and they feel they do manifest we are sons and daughters of god manifesting secret game aladdin if somebody is sick there you go get that upon your heart look at what happened with our prophet or everything that he tried to do it was only to heal the sick said this occupied so fast he was to take care of people's sufferings amen amen amen amen [Music] i believe now you have understood where where i'm headed you have a comprehensive planet you have understood this fullness of time amen amen we're not like anybody else no no no but we are [Music] that allows us to kick out that devil manifesto that's the manifestation nature was waiting naturally i had them hallelujah hallelujah and take a machine the plaster and they moved from here but the goddess a set of resources but this power now could move the trees yes you say amen amen amen amen therefore that power lives on the move did they animals have sinned amen amen and you see the man coming back that's a prison it needs power oh let's say motherboard over there let me tell you first that man say william it's william branham first i say william he went to faith in finland less than five somebody goes to the medicine to study medicine where yes at university head to the university to college you need to do this on saturn he learns for seven years with books that a man had written no the curve circumstance

a doctor he is a doctor he is a physician you get you get there he operates and then simply live with knowledge from a book a simple book that a man had to talk about and you heal me i'm much more

[Applause] [Applause] amen what we have we left all of the disease all the way to sickness all the sick be sick what if we feel if we left all these things some puppy without any documents why where

manifest you have to be like william branham not repair service our father that's our father oh man amen but if you stay back home the same choice let me tell you something the amount of god in a person a proportion and a power killer is a proportional to the word that he has oh you live with that love today you hear that tomorrow you won't be there tomorrow you won't be there therefore then it won't be good man therefore then you see god has begotten us so we can get to the manifestation that's why this message has come undone we have to hear your friends god wants people like that and likes people like that say yeah a try amen amen foreign faith is that the amount of the quantity of something like entity the amount of god kidnaps in the person that is in the man and the faith does not come from prayer you can read it in the fundamental foundation for faith you see me differently he does things differently i know and then that's that's what they mean in the world i'll pray for a
