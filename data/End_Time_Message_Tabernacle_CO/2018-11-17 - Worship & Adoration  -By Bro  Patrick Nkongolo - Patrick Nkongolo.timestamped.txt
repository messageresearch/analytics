[15:01] because we believe you the one for the
[15:03] God that brought us here between our God
[15:07] we know each and every one of us father
[15:09] God left whatever they were doing Lord
[15:11] to come into this place father God just
[15:14] like as Peter said Lord Jesus where else
[15:17] can we go only you have the words of
[15:19] life for your children have realized
[15:23] tonight for the garden there's no better
[15:24] place that it can be than in your holy
[15:27] presence Lord and your word says father
[15:31] God wherever two or three I got it in
[15:33] your name you will be a mountain
[15:35] you also said that come on to me all who
[15:38] are weary and I will give you rest
[15:40] you also said in your word for a god
[15:43] that there shall be no disease for a god
[15:45] among us if we call unto you so we just
[15:49] want to hold you on to your promises
[15:51] tonight father god father there's no
[15:54] better word there's no other expression
[15:56] coming from us where I got better than
[15:57] your own or where the Lord Jesus and
[15:59] your prophets said that your word is
[16:02] bigger father you know bigger than your
[16:03] own word Lord and we come on this very
[16:07] same principles father God that there's
[16:08] some people that I got back there came
[16:11] under and saw the result and we believe
[16:13] I regard that if we come under the same
[16:15] very same expectation for a god and if
[16:18] we've made the very same preparation
[16:20] Lord Jesus will see the results or come
[16:24] - now father God and touch your children
[16:27] law Duda has the health needs father
[16:29] those that are sick whether it be in the
[16:32] body for a God or spiritually sick for a
[16:34] god those that are looking for a closer
[16:37] walk with you Lord those that want you
[16:39] into their lives for the guide tonight
[16:42] we caught up on that presence come down
[16:44] for the God and help each one of us Lord
[16:46] Jesus you know what each person is going
[16:48] through Lord but we can only worship
[16:51] your father because you've made us
[16:53] father God to worship you and Lord we
[16:56] believe through the worship through the
[16:58] songs that will be sung for a god
[16:59] through the preaching of your word

[17:03] free Lord they seek would be healed for
[17:05] the guard and the backslider will be
[17:07] brought back Lord Jesus Christ receive
[17:10] glory and honor as we ask for God also
[17:13] forgiveness Lord we believe as human
[17:15] being subject to this body Lord we have
[17:18] seen one way another load and we're not
[17:20] perfect we're not even worthy to stand
[17:21] into your holy presence but we believe
[17:24] through the blood that your son Jesus
[17:25] Christ shed on Calvary Lord we've been
[17:28] made more than able for a god to stain
[17:30] and to claim whatever is ours Lord Jesus
[17:32] Christ father speak to us tonight I'm
[17:36] not your servant where he is oh Jesus

[17:45] can bring life or a God come and quicken
[17:48] us tonight with the preaching of the
[17:50] word come and change our lives Lord
