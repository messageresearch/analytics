[1:30] when i am in trouble
[1:32] incline thy ear unto me
[1:35] in the day when i call answer me
[1:38] speedily

[1:43] and my bones are burned
[1:45] as an earth
[1:47] my heart is smitten
[1:50] and withered like grace
[1:52] so that i forget to eat my bread
[1:56] by reason of the voice of my groaning

[52:00] and i heard the testimony when he
[52:02] preached in south africa
[52:05] arizona and elsewhere here in the states

[53:33] a family uh couple also planning and uh
[53:36] leadership with a different i mean it
[53:39] can be
[53:40] expanded in various of ways
[53:54] so the job we have uh we don't have much
[53:57] time but i believe god willing next
[53:59] sunday uh we will spend some time
[54:02] together praying for those meetings as
[54:04] well
[54:16] you can keep those meetings in the
[54:18] prayers that will be a blessing
[54:26] we are trying to do our best to
[54:30] prepare
[54:31] for those meetings
[54:36] and i would like to have a quick meeting
[54:39] after service today here we have our in
[54:43] your private services
[54:44] with uh the group of coordination so
[54:48] that we i can know where we are standing
[54:51] how much money we need to spend and what
[54:55] needs to be done eventually
[55:03] but i think you have to get already the
[55:05] report from all the commissions
[55:30] okay
[55:36] okay
[55:37] but uh still if we can have a quick
[55:39] meeting uh like that after service maybe
[55:42] 20 minutes uh to make sure that we put
[55:45] the dot
[55:48] where we need to be
[55:49] and also
[55:51] we have received some calls from people
[55:54] who have registered but they don't have
[55:58] a place to to stay
[56:01] so i will ask anyone who would be open
[56:04] to that to receive depending on your
[56:09] capacity that will be certainly welcome
[56:12] if you can be in touch with brother
[56:14] richard
[56:15] probably we will have
[56:18] some kind of
[56:20] accommodation which i don't want to say
[56:22] because people will say ah there is an
[56:24] accommodation let's go so
[56:26] okay about to the memo on the right
[56:49] and uh
[56:50] god willing also next sunday you will
[56:53] now see the dimension
[56:55] oh no next saturday the sunday portion
[57:00] around from 10 a.m
[57:06] i will need
[57:07] anybody to help with the cleaning
[57:12] represented
[57:19] we thank god for
[57:22] uh different brothers and
[57:24] sisters for every effort you are doing
[57:28] so far no i mentioned
[57:31] the first they say
[57:35] foreign and trying to maintain
[57:38] so
[57:46] outside all here it's uh
[57:49] not reflecting good
[57:51] it's very good alexa
[57:57] you know since this year i did not want
[57:59] to make any announcement for the
[58:01] cleaning but i think the adoption need
[58:03] to put us where we belong
[58:28] i think people in the community they say
[58:30] this is a very rich church um
[58:36] but when they look at the property
[58:38] because regardless of property
[58:41] it doesn't reflect really christianity
[58:44] it's an um reflect passover
[58:48] that created to the extent they said
[58:52] i don't want to be labeled
[58:55] african
[59:00] african but i want to be labeled
[59:03] christian
[59:09] so next sunday at 10 we need to do deep
[59:12] cleaning
[59:14] saturday sunday dessert
[59:26] today we did not allow anybody to go
[59:28] downstairs because they are doing work
[59:37] we have
