TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen God bless you Saints um personally before I sing I love to always share scripture and I would like to share second Peter 3:9 to1 it says that the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but in longsuffering to us what not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fent heat the Earths also and the works that the rain shall be burned seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of presence ought we to be in all holy conversations and Holiness looking for and the Hasting unto God unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being of fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with Fen Heat i' like to sing a song titled I want to leave each day as if it be my last one the world is passing away and the prophet said one of these days the preacher man would have to preach for the last time open the Bible for the last time close the Bible for the last time so each day let's live our life as if it' be our last one amen I want to live each day as save my last one I want the true way values in my life for one day surely will be my last one and I will have to leave this SW behind I want to live each day as sa my last one I want the true ways values in my life for one day truly will be my last one and I will have to leave this world behind fill me with your hope Holy [Music] Spirit fill me with eternal life to live each day as if it be my last one far above this world with it kind of stride the years have wasted and a few by me I'm praying for a difference in my life behold my friends and loved ones see me changing till they see no longer me but only cry so fill me with your Holy Spirit daddy fill me with it and alive to live each day as if it be my last one far above this world and it's kind of strife amen
