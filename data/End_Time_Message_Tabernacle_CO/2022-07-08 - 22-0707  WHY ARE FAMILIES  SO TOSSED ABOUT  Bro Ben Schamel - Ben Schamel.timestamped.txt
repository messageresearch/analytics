[59:53] we first of all just want to thank
[59:55] brother fosten and the church for the
[59:56] opportunity
[1:00:26] my brother matthew preached a wonderful
[1:00:28] service last night
[1:00:33] brother we weren't able to be here in
[1:00:35] person but we were streaming online
[1:00:40] and he preached on
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:06] so we're just honored to be among the
[1:01:08] people of god
[1:01:12] if you will and we'll just go ahead and
[1:01:14] turn to our scriptures now
[1:01:18] we know that
[1:01:20] the meetings are centered around the
[1:01:22] family
[1:01:36] why people are so tossed about
[1:01:40] incredible message
[1:01:43] so what i would like to speak on tonight
[1:01:47] much of my scriptures and thoughts
[1:01:49] inspiration
[1:02:02] if the lord would help us we'll turn to
[1:02:04] psalms chapter 127
[1:02:12] we know that families are the backbone
[1:02:14] of the church
[1:02:21] and satan has been trying to destroy
[1:02:23] families
[1:02:26] ever since the garden of eden
[1:02:31] psalms 127
[1:02:37] the scripture reads except the lord
[1:02:38] build the house they that labor
[1:02:41] they labor in vain that build it
[1:02:43] except the lord keep the city the
[1:02:45] watchmen walk wakeeth but in vain
[1:02:50] it is vain for you to rise up early and
[1:02:52] to sit up late and eat the bread of
[1:02:53] sorrows
[1:02:55] for so he get giveth his beloved sleep
[1:02:59] lo children are in heritage of the lord
[1:03:01] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[1:03:04] as arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[1:03:06] man so are children of the youth
[1:03:09] happy is the man that hath his quiver
[1:03:11] full of them
[1:03:13] they shall not be ashamed but they shall
[1:03:15] speak
[1:03:16] with the enemies in the gate amen
[1:03:28] thank you
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:56] dear gracious heavenly father
[1:03:59] lord we just come before you yes once
[1:04:00] more lord
[1:04:03] lord we're just so thankful that we have
[1:04:04] a time and a place to come together
[1:04:10] lord that we can gather ourselves around
[1:04:12] your word
[1:04:14] lord that we can encourage ourselves in
[1:04:17] your word
[1:04:20] lord we're coming together tonight to
[1:04:21] speak about families
[1:04:36] that we wouldn't speak anything that's
[1:04:37] dishonoring to you tonight
[1:04:41] that you might just get the speaker out
[1:04:42] of out of the way that we might hear
[1:04:44] from the holy spirit
[1:04:48] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[1:04:49] christ
[1:04:52] amen amen and you may be seated
[1:04:57] so again we'd like to speak tonight on
[1:04:58] why families are so tossed about it
[1:05:04] and we realize that god has a family
[1:05:14] and he had in his mind a perfect picture
[1:05:17] of what his family would be
[1:05:19] done
[1:05:22] and if we would tonight it may not be so
[1:05:23] much preaching but maybe more teaching
[1:05:26] tonight
[1:05:30] as brother has taught us
[1:05:33] preaching often convicts the
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:43] but teaching positionally places the
[1:05:46] bride of jesus
[1:06:01] so we can only preach so much
[1:06:16] he
[1:06:28] a correct good noble obedient family
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:57] the mother with the father
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:10] you'll see one lovely picture
[1:07:26] was
[1:07:37] and the only way that they could be won
[1:07:39] with the family
[1:08:22] god in his family
[1:08:25] father overall
[1:08:27] supreme
[1:08:29] so we see we're starting to see this
[1:08:31] picture that god has of his family
[1:08:36] it's a beautiful picture
[1:08:39] and he's put into place headship
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:43] he's put into place leadership
[1:08:47] in the family
[1:08:49] the backbone of the church
[1:08:59] but we know that satan is trying to skew
[1:09:01] the portrait of god's family
[1:09:17] it's no longer mother it's no longer
[1:09:19] father mother children
[1:09:24] but here's satan
[1:09:26] trying to distort the picture of god
[1:09:28] they say that really much did you so
[1:09:31] much so
[1:09:41] he's projecting to them mother mother
[1:09:43] and children my mama it is
[1:09:45] what a perverse nation
[1:10:33] the satan is doing his best
[1:10:36] they said they felt this on you to try
[1:10:38] to get god's people who you see the
[1:10:40] point is you're away from the headshot
[1:10:55] that a family should be fully
[1:10:57] surrendered to the leadership of god
[1:11:04] the scriptures say
[1:11:06] except the lord build a house
[1:11:08] except
[1:11:23] we neglect to include god into the
[1:11:25] relationship
[1:11:29] and i'm not talking about the marriage
[1:11:30] side
[1:11:33] i'm talking about before that
[1:11:36] yes when we're dating
[1:12:06] girl
[1:12:08] and it has nothing to do
[1:12:11] with their family
[1:12:13] but they're only talking to her because
[1:12:15] she's pretty meh
[1:12:18] or she's cute
[1:12:20] many times worldly girls
[1:12:23] and it shows what is inside of you
[1:12:28] and it's expressing itself through who
[1:12:30] you're talking to
[1:12:33] same thing for the women
[1:12:47] but we've now become distracted
[1:12:51] by these other worldly things
[1:12:54] and now we're worried about having a
[1:12:56] boyfriend or girlfriend
[1:12:59] not trying to walk in the will of the
[1:13:00] lord
[1:13:13] so are we trying to get a a
[1:13:16] a boyfriend or girlfriend out of social
[1:13:17] status
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:27] i can take my halo off
[1:13:29] i can take my halo off we're just going
[1:13:31] to preach tonight
[1:13:36] do we believe this
[1:13:38] yes
[1:13:39] praise god
[1:13:44] but from the beginning we're starting to
[1:13:45] get our picture distorted
[1:13:51] but marriage we realize is between three
[1:13:56] persons not just two pastors
[1:14:27] the problem is we're all on the boat
[1:14:29] called life
[1:14:33] and many times we want to be at the helm
[1:14:34] of the boat
[1:14:39] and we want this ship to sail where we
[1:14:41] want the ships
[1:14:45] we don't want it to go where god wants
[1:14:47] it to go vulnerable
[1:14:49] but many times we are like jonah
[1:14:52] and we know that we're running from the
[1:14:54] presence of god
[1:14:57] because it doesn't feel as good as where
[1:14:59] we would go
[1:15:05] is this okay
[1:15:22] many times we come to church
[1:15:24] and we sit here on a sunday or a
[1:15:26] wednesday night
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] and we're just playing church
[1:15:32] we come out of traditions
[1:15:35] or we come to show face or see friends
[1:15:48] and this is not just a nominational
[1:15:50] christian
[1:16:16] but you now have the spirit of jesus
[1:16:19] christ
[1:16:21] his blood flowing through your face
[1:16:25] we are now
[1:16:27] children of the living god
[1:16:33] and i'll try to stay on my on my notes
[1:16:37] but brother branham talks about the the
[1:16:38] temple that was in israel
[1:16:42] and how there was an outer court
[1:16:45] there was an
[1:16:46] intercourse and there was a holiest of
[1:16:49] here
[1:16:51] and so many times we are tossed to and
[1:16:53] fro
[1:16:56] we feel like roller coaster christians
[1:17:00] up then
[1:17:15] it's because we are still in the
[1:17:17] justification phase
[1:17:22] brother brown said not a different
[1:17:23] christian
[1:17:26] but a different phase of the christian
[1:17:28] world
[1:17:41] so when the storms of life come in
[1:17:45] that light is blocked
[1:17:49] we feel the rain
[1:17:51] we feel the wind
[1:17:54] but there's a higher calling may yeah
[1:18:05] and that's where we have the seven
[1:18:07] golden candlesticks
[1:18:10] it's no longer the sun is the light
[1:18:13] but that light shines all of the time
[1:18:17] but that light is still a false light
[1:18:22] that is not where we're trying to get to
[1:18:24] it
[1:18:37] then there is no more
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:19] no longer up and down
[1:19:34] a christian must be fully surrendered to
[1:19:37] god
[1:19:39] the father the mother and the children
[1:19:44] must be fully surrendered
[1:20:01] until the storms of life start to come
[1:20:06] and then what do we do
[1:20:08] we throw our hands up and say oh no
[1:20:11] look at the mess
[1:20:14] the batista
[1:20:15] lord just take care of my situation
[1:20:19] when 10 minutes before me
[1:20:22] you were doing what you wanted to do
[1:20:25] and had no regard to the word of god
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:40] he says that faith in god's word will
[1:20:43] give you rest
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:25] and he preached to her at midnight in
[1:21:26] bed
[1:21:46] the christian faith is based solidly
[1:21:48] upon rest
[1:21:54] he says that's right
[1:22:08] and worry about all things
[1:22:11] a christian rest
[1:22:14] he says it's all over it's if you need
[1:22:16] it's finished for the believer at
[1:22:18] calvary
[1:22:20] that's right
[1:22:22] oh sickness
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:50] there is neither
[1:23:04] just let
[1:23:46] and
[1:24:15] as psalms 127 says
[1:24:19] a song of decrees for solomon
[1:24:25] except the lord build the house
[1:24:52] but i want to build a family the way i
[1:24:54] want to build a family
[1:25:06] we've already seen the result of of you
[1:25:08] trying to take this
[1:25:09] video
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:38] doing their own things
[1:25:41] totally disintegrated
[1:25:43] there was no family unity
[1:25:46] and it's the same with the bride of
[1:25:48] jesus christ
[1:25:51] so many times we see the church family
[1:26:09] if you can get the entire church
[1:26:11] surrendered to the holy spirit
[1:26:18] whereas before the church was struggling
[1:26:48] but god must be the centerpiece
[1:26:52] of the family
[1:26:55] otherwise it won't work
[1:26:58] so god has set up an umbrella of
[1:27:00] leadership inside the family
[1:27:16] we see this god
[1:27:19] christ and his church
[1:27:22] are a perfect type of the family
[1:27:25] did you just as god and christ are one
[1:27:28] comes
[1:27:30] christian
[1:27:43] and all that christ is
[1:27:53] he said now the bride cannot be any more
[1:27:55] inferior to the man
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:12] our families
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:54] they told us
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:07] but because we have a promise
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:20] amen amen
[1:29:23] so now when two are married in christ
[1:29:27] they are not now two flesh
[1:29:30] they are one flesh
[1:29:33] just as god in christ
[1:29:36] and when they have children they come in
[1:29:38] no zombies are fun those children are
[1:29:40] now an expression of the father
[1:29:43] expression
[1:29:44] living through the children
[1:29:48] just as we are attributes of god come
[1:30:03] i'm coming into communion
[1:30:15] now we can see why the message families
[1:30:16] are being so bombarded
[1:30:31] many times we don't realize the
[1:30:33] struggles that are going on with the
[1:30:34] person next to us
[1:30:38] many times we think the homosexuality
[1:30:40] demon is outside of our church
[1:30:45] but i'm telling you the devil is
[1:30:46] attacking
[1:31:00] for as many are led by the spirit of god
[1:31:08] they are the sons of god
[1:31:13] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:31:15] bondage again to fear gov
[1:31:20] but you have received received the
[1:31:22] spirit of adoption
[1:31:26] whereby we cry our father
[1:31:56] verse 16 says he says
[1:31:58] the spirit itself bears witness is with
[1:32:02] our spirits
[1:32:05] history that we are the children of god
[1:32:07] you know
[1:32:09] not only our spirit
[1:32:22] so god says you're a son of god
[1:32:40] so the next time the devil comes to you
[1:32:42] in a question
[1:32:44] and he says this message isn't for you
[1:32:46] you aren't the son of god
[1:32:48] this message is for somebody else
[1:32:51] that message is old-fashioned
[1:33:13] [Applause]
[1:33:17] yes praise god
[1:33:20] thank you
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:34:01] if jesus says let this mountain be moved
[1:34:05] don't we believe that it would be moved
[1:34:13] then why did we lack the faith for a
[1:34:15] two-member
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:41] that we may be also glorified together
[1:34:50] but you see here's where satan has
[1:34:52] tricked us
[1:34:54] especially in the american culture
[1:34:59] but the father who's supposed to be the
[1:35:01] head of the home
[1:35:04] has now taken a back seat
[1:35:07] and he's no longer leading the way he
[1:35:10] opted
[1:35:45] he says say what about the man
[1:35:48] he says it's you brother it's your time
[1:35:53] you call yourself a man and the head of
[1:35:55] the house
[1:35:58] and you let your women strip her
[1:36:00] strip herself off and get out there on
[1:36:02] the lawnmower
[1:36:07] and get a cigarette in her hands
[1:36:22] so man as the head of the house
[1:36:26] when you see your daughters
[1:36:28] when you see your wife
[1:36:30] and they're dressed so tight they can't
[1:36:32] even be afraid
[1:36:35] it shows what kind of man you are
[1:36:51] and our place should be at the altar
[1:36:54] we need to be born again
[1:36:56] we shouldn't want our daughters or or or
[1:36:58] our wives out there looking like that
[1:37:03] but when we're fully surrendered to the
[1:37:06] holy spirit
[1:37:08] then everything we do
[1:37:11] is to glorify god
[1:37:14] so if the scriptures say
[1:37:17] i god what you want you to be dressed
[1:37:22] this certain way
[1:37:25] modestly
[1:37:29] and we are in love with jesus
[1:37:44] then you've got a heart problem
[1:37:45] somewhere
[1:38:14] but it shows how much a man you are
[1:38:18] he says that's just exactly it
[1:38:21] you know that's the truth
[1:38:24] what we need is an old-fashioned holy
[1:38:26] ghost revival second say hey
[1:38:42] because we are dealing with the eternal
[1:38:44] destination
[1:38:50] we're not coming up here to to try to
[1:38:52] preach something that might tickle your
[1:38:54] ears
[1:39:20] we're trying to get our families
[1:39:22] prepared for our wraps
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:51] why take that substitute
[1:40:04] he says pentecostal skies are full of
[1:40:06] the real holy
[1:40:35] mothers will never be the mothers that
[1:40:36] they need to be
[1:40:39] outside of the holy ghost
[1:40:42] and children it is our fault
[1:40:44] you will not be the arrows
[1:40:47] in the hand of a mighty warrior
[1:40:50] that you should be
[1:40:53] unless you're fully surrendered to the
[1:40:55] holy ghost
[1:40:58] you're never too young to be surrendered
[1:41:11] [Applause]
[1:41:16] so you can't give me that excuse
[1:41:18] me
[1:41:22] he says why do you take anything like
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:26] listen to what brother brandon says
[1:41:29] and he's talking to the men
[1:41:32] because you're trying to live in sin
[1:41:35] basically
[1:41:37] and possess the holy ghost at the same
[1:41:41] time
[1:41:43] mum
[1:41:58] possess the holy ghost at the same time
[1:42:04] now we can see why we're up and down
[1:42:10] because as men we're living lazy sinful
[1:42:12] lives
[1:42:26] the leadership that god gave the role to
[1:42:29] the to the father
[1:42:32] and we've shifted the responsibility
[1:42:37] over to the wife
[1:42:40] [Music]
[1:42:42] you're trying to live in sin yet possess
[1:42:44] the holy ghost at the same time
[1:42:51] so the men we come in
[1:42:53] yeah and we put the check on the table
[1:42:56] we beat our chests
[1:43:02] and we sit down in the lazy chair
[1:43:06] the wife do everything else
[1:43:19] and that's where satan will come in and
[1:43:20] start to divide
[1:43:36] and it goes on
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:44:04] but we are going to be fully surrendered
[1:44:05] to you
[1:44:08] but with that check we also slap down
[1:44:10] all the bills
[1:44:14] and we don't even know if there's enough
[1:44:15] money in that check to cover all the
[1:44:16] bills
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:57] we try to make everybody else in the
[1:44:59] church think that oh we're so religious
[1:45:42] does not take care of his family
[1:45:45] worse than an infidel
[1:45:48] those are pretty harsh words
[1:45:51] but a message believer sitting here in a
[1:45:52] seat
[1:45:55] that's not taking proper care of his
[1:45:57] family
[1:45:59] is worse than a homeless drunk on the
[1:46:01] side
[1:46:06] that's the scripture
[1:46:10] because when we come in we sit down our
[1:46:11] family knows
[1:46:16] they know the temper that we've got
[1:46:22] they know that we're not reading our
[1:46:24] bible the way that we should be
[1:46:28] we know that we're letting the mom do
[1:46:29] all the bible studies with the kids
[1:46:35] we're letting mama do all the the
[1:46:37] prayers with the children
[1:46:44] just because we have an eight-hour job
[1:46:46] we go to work and come back
[1:46:51] for me
[1:47:04] but we see the same thing happening in
[1:47:06] churches
[1:47:20] he's not afraid to chase out that guy
[1:47:23] why because he's pastoring his people
[1:47:28] that god would pastor his people
[1:47:31] and we praise the lord for that
[1:47:34] he's not neglecting
[1:47:48] so we follow our pastor
[1:47:51] as he follows the message of our hour
[1:47:54] as brother branham followed christ
[1:47:57] it's leadership
[1:48:00] but so many times it gets messed up at
[1:48:01] home
[1:48:31] maybe something that needs to be
[1:48:32] addressed in our family
[1:48:35] how are our children's our parents or or
[1:48:38] our family going to receive it
[1:48:42] the day before you were talking
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:58] but there will come a time
[1:49:01] when we'll realize that we are sons of
[1:49:03] god
[1:49:06] that we are the manifestation of the
[1:49:08] lord jesus
[1:49:12] and some of us fathers are going to
[1:49:13] stand up
[1:49:15] and we're going to look the devil in the
[1:49:16] face
[1:49:20] i've had enough yeah
[1:49:23] i'm not taking this beating
[1:49:26] but i
[1:49:38] step up to the responsibilities
[1:49:52] i will lead my wife
[1:50:07] if the devil is coming against one of
[1:50:20] just as our brother preached the roman
[1:50:22] centurion last night
[1:50:27] he said i am a man with authority
[1:50:31] but i am also a man under authority
[1:50:38] so if we as fathers of our homes can't
[1:50:41] be under authority to the church
[1:50:46] how can we turn around
[1:50:50] and expect our children
[1:51:19] if we won't surrender the boat
[1:51:22] ourselves unto god
[1:51:25] then how can we expect those following
[1:51:27] us
[1:51:29] to do the same they felt the men shows
[1:51:31] them insurance that's why brother
[1:51:32] branham taught us that it's so important
[1:51:34] who teaches you
[1:51:37] it's very important who you're following
[1:51:43] us in this local assembly are not
[1:51:45] ordained to stream another pastor
[1:51:51] but god has put a pastor in your area
[1:51:56] to take care of your neighbors
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:13] he can't attend to your needs
[1:52:35] but many times we try being spiritual
[1:52:37] leaders the wrong way
[1:52:42] brother
[1:52:56] he goes
[1:53:09] just couldn't believe that he would
[1:53:11] associate with such people
[1:53:15] so he grabs oliver
[1:53:18] and and and he goes all pentecostal
[1:53:22] and he says oh god
[1:53:37] he was trying to take the minion of this
[1:53:38] household
[1:53:53] is the way
[1:53:56] brother branham said
[1:53:58] some of the the most uh powerful moves
[1:54:01] of god then the poissons
[1:54:05] are done in quiet places
[1:54:16] what we need is to be surrendered
[1:54:20] [Applause]
[1:54:49] he said brother let's get people inside
[1:54:52] the veil
[1:54:57] let's not only get them to church but
[1:54:58] let's get them to christ
[1:55:02] says that's right
[1:55:05] this is powerful i want you to read it
[1:55:08] he says you want to know a little secret
[1:55:11] would you like to know a secret
[1:55:14] of this age
[1:55:16] here's
[1:56:35] what about a child of god that's that's
[1:56:37] that's squabbling laid out on the floor
[1:56:39] gonna see this don't forget
[1:57:08] love
[1:57:11] amen
[1:57:12] he says the love of god constrains us
[1:57:18] to do such a thing
[1:57:21] he says come in the veil
[1:57:31] so instead of going and trying to cast a
[1:57:33] demon yelling and screaming at your wife
[1:57:50] you know honey maybe we go out and eat
[1:57:52] it
[1:57:55] i know you've been working so hard
[1:57:57] raising the children isn't it
[1:58:00] at least i didn't make it easy on my mom
[1:58:12] but that gives a whole different
[1:58:13] reaction
[1:58:16] because brother branham put this to the
[1:58:18] test time
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:33] and he completely changed the atmosphere
[1:58:38] not by screaming and shouting
[1:58:42] but he was allowing the power of god
[1:58:47] he was fully surrendered to the holy
[1:58:49] ghost
[1:58:51] and he was allowing that to manifest in
[1:58:54] his everyday life
[1:58:59] he didn't say oh
[1:59:01] do you just shut up get the kids out of
[1:59:03] here
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:06] and disaster
[1:59:07] but he said no you know what honey
[1:59:10] let me help you wash those
[1:59:13] total different approach
[1:59:19] and i'm so glad that that's how god
[1:59:20] works
[1:59:23] because if god acted the way that we
[1:59:24] thought we should act
[1:59:28] then instead of sending christ down to
[1:59:30] save us
[1:59:32] then he would have sent judgment and i'd
[1:59:34] be in hell right now
[1:59:37] but the love of god is man
[1:59:42] and he has that love to bestow upon us
[1:59:52] my goodness time flies
[1:59:59] we must get god's picture of headship
[2:00:01] right
[2:00:04] there
[2:00:05] before anyone can take their full
[2:00:07] position in god's portraits
[2:00:38] didn't find her in the morning
[2:00:42] he never found her at noontime
[2:00:45] he found her in the evening
[2:00:49] it shall be liked
[2:00:51] in the evening
[2:01:06] a woman it's her nature
[2:01:09] to surrender to a man
[2:01:12] it's the nature of the church
[2:01:16] to surrender to christ
[2:01:19] and surrender to his will it is
[2:01:34] there's too much
[2:01:37] verse 4 of psalms says
[2:01:41] as arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[2:01:43] man so are children of the youth
[2:01:46] happy is the man that hath his quiver
[2:01:48] full of them that they should not be
[2:01:50] ashamed but they shall speak with the
[2:01:51] enemies in the gate come the flesh
[2:02:01] but in the english language
[2:02:31] so the scripture's saying that
[2:02:33] children are your reward
[2:02:36] components but we live in a society now
[2:02:38] that doesn't want any children
[2:02:43] we live in a society now where they say
[2:02:45] i just want one one boy one girl that's
[2:02:46] it i'm done
[2:02:52] and i won't
[2:02:54] go into that too much
[2:02:56] but you search it out yourself
[2:03:03] [Applause]
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:39] and those arrows if you're fully
[2:03:41] surrendered
[2:03:44] and they can go around
[2:03:46] they can shoot over the wall
[2:03:49] and they can reach places
[2:03:53] don't discount your children and then
[2:03:55] negligible
[2:03:58] many times even as ministers members of
[2:04:00] a member they come to minister they
[2:04:02] think that that that it's our ministry
[2:04:06] our wife and our children don't really
[2:04:07] have anything to do with our ministry
[2:04:14] why would paul have said that you have
[2:04:15] to have your family in order
[2:04:18] for me
[2:04:19] because the children pascale
[2:04:21] along with the wife avec
[2:04:36] and i apologize i'm i'm trying to hit
[2:04:38] these points and move on excuse your
[2:04:39] voice
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:56] all right
[2:04:59] talk to the the dads and the moms
[2:05:03] are your kids ready
[2:05:13] one of the biggest things
[2:05:16] that i've ever seen that destroys
[2:05:18] families
[2:05:31] i'll go into it a little bit but i don't
[2:05:32] have a lot of time
[2:05:36] but many times when you're talking evil
[2:05:38] about your parents
[2:05:41] and you start to harbor bitterness
[2:05:45] it creates a division within the family
[2:05:47] division
[2:05:48] and if you notice
[2:05:50] bitterness is often referred to as a
[2:05:53] root of bitterness
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:57] bitterness oftentimes is not something
[2:05:58] that you can see with the naked eye la
[2:06:00] la
[2:06:11] so when we see all of these other things
[2:06:13] that are manifesting in our children
[2:06:28] peter
[2:06:41] i know a little bit about uh
[2:06:46] i'll give you money tell me how to lay
[2:06:48] my hands on people
[2:06:54] he had an indifferent spirit
[2:07:24] so i i love how the scripture puts this
[2:07:28] bcc we'll go ahead and we'll read it
[2:07:31] give me also this power that on whom
[2:07:34] so ever i lay hands he may receive the
[2:07:35] holy ghost
[2:07:53] nor lot in this matter
[2:07:57] for your heart is not right in the sight
[2:07:58] of god
[2:08:01] repent therefore
[2:08:03] that this thy wickedness descent
[2:08:06] and pray god it's supreme
[2:08:08] if perhaps the thought of thine heart
[2:08:10] may be forgiven
[2:08:15] now without the leading of the holy
[2:08:16] spirit
[2:08:18] he would have not said this next
[2:08:33] and in the bond of iniquity
[2:08:52] so spiritual leaders start looking out i
[2:08:54] mean
[2:08:55] spiritually
[2:08:57] when you start seeing the young people
[2:08:59] and they start to get indifferent toward
[2:09:01] the word of god
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:31] you know the brother branham talked
[2:09:32] about the the birds and how the dove
[2:09:34] doesn't have any gall doesn't have any
[2:09:36] bitterness
[2:09:41] in a message called do you uh now
[2:09:43] believe
[2:09:44] in them
[2:09:58] but forgiveness
[2:10:00] is the antidote
[2:10:02] to bitterness
[2:10:06] i'll say that again for the kids
[2:10:09] forgiveness
[2:10:11] is the antidote
[2:10:27] many times our parents are growing up
[2:10:28] with us
[2:10:31] i have a lot of friends my age
[2:10:34] that now have four or five kids
[2:10:37] on saint kusi zamfar and i'm realizing
[2:10:40] this now
[2:10:58] said that bitterness will hold the holy
[2:10:59] spirit back from your life
[2:11:04] and that's going to be the root of the
[2:11:05] thing
[2:11:07] if we can root out bitterness
[2:11:20] emma
[2:11:36] okay i'll read this one little quote in
[2:11:38] the middle
[2:11:43] god being misunderstood 61.
[2:11:48] now
[2:11:49] if a great
[2:11:51] if a great blessing on see
[2:11:54] benediction and the people are shouting
[2:11:58] and the glory of the lord is falling
[2:12:02] and people want to scream and shout and
[2:12:04] do whatever the spirit tells them
[2:12:08] he said go ahead that's right
[2:12:11] but when a man's coming to be healed
[2:12:16] where the question between death and
[2:12:18] life is involved
[2:12:21] i believe we should uh we should be
[2:12:24] reverent and speak to the father
[2:12:28] and talk to him
[2:12:31] instead of worshiping
[2:12:34] let's ask him
[2:12:36] father i am a worshiper of yours
[2:12:40] i love you
[2:12:41] you know i do you too
[2:12:44] i express my love to you
[2:12:46] now
[2:13:01] so if we want to have restoration in our
[2:13:04] family
[2:13:06] don't take hold of the helm with an iron
[2:13:10] fist
[2:13:14] but start expressing god's love
[2:13:19] and that will turn the entire ship
[2:13:21] around
[2:13:25] just let go and let god have his ways
[2:13:29] and i believe that stronger families
[2:13:33] will result in a stronger church
[2:13:36] on the ground the good fortune and a
[2:13:38] stronger church will result in a
[2:13:40] stronger bride of jesus christ
[2:13:54] good
[2:14:16] blessed be the name of the lord being
[2:14:18] swollen on the senior amen amen it's
[2:14:22] certainly a privilege and a pleasure
[2:14:25] certain mind privilege and pleasure
[2:14:28] when the old men preach
[2:14:32] the younger people they said oh because
[2:14:34] because because legend on this pascal
[2:14:38] but
[2:14:39] god always has a witness
[2:14:44] if there are many young people they said
[2:14:46] the message is for all the people
[2:14:51] god is gonna raise some young person and
[2:14:54] talk to the young people
[2:14:58] amen amen this is the purpose of this
[2:15:01] meeting
[2:15:03] to have at the same time the couple and
[2:15:07] the single davao memo couple
[2:15:10] as i said yesterday
[2:15:13] because this is the target of the enemy
[2:15:16] enemy to destroy family did they tweet
[2:15:19] for me
[2:15:20] amen thank you very much

[2:15:35] to pray for our families
