[12:17] stay with the teacher maybe for 10
[12:19] minutes after service so for tonight we
[12:24] are trying to close up this Mira Church
[12:28] age to solve in Arabic this meal
[12:32] as we read Revelation chapter 2 complete
[12:35] apocalypse a bit will do from verse 8 to
[12:37] verse 11 let us read it together this
[12:43] ensemble and unto the Angel of the
[12:47] church in Smyrna right do you think said
[12:51] the first and the last which was dead
[12:53] and his life I know thy works and
[12:58] tribulation and poverty but thou are
[13:01] rich and I know the blasphemy of them
[13:05] which say they are Jews and are not but
[13:08] are the synagogue of Satan fear none of
[13:13] the things which thou shalt suffer
[13:16] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[13:19] into prison that he may be tried and ye
[13:23] shall have tribulation 10 days be thou
[13:26] faithful unto death and I will give thee
[13:29] a crown of life he that as in here let
[13:35] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[13:37] churches
[13:38] he that overcometh
[13:42] I think the people back there we need to
[13:49] line them up a little bit
[13:51] the selenium is there people playing or
[13:55] what is it there's no jewel about
[13:56] Christine papa
[13:57] you need to know which scripture we are
[14:01] following Kelly kitchen will even seek
[14:04] religious freedom so we are talking
[14:07] about the second church age no baloney
[14:09] second I believe the age of Smyrna like
[14:13] this meal so may the Lord are the
[14:15] blessing to the reading of this urban
[14:18] dictionary kidnapper hole so we spoke
[14:26] about the age of Smyrna the own Polish
[14:28] village this meal and there was a
[14:32] meaning of the word Smyrna everything
[14:35] from the most meal which what our eldest
[14:39] is going to remind us what is the mean
[14:41] that's one who happily if equality if
[14:43] you can show you most men
[14:52] I can stand here for three weeks a month
[14:57] meeting us upon our same thing Perelman
[15:01] de la meme chose if we are not following
[15:03] what will be the purpose Picasso a
[15:06] little bit sister Leah what is the
[15:09] meaning of life occurs when you move me
[15:11] on ah so this is the meaning of smear so
[15:19] as you study something you need to go
[15:22] with the word complete we do capital
[15:25] will help you tella babbu didi as we sow
[15:33] in the message the church age books
[15:35] don't we leave all this manual church
[15:38] age graph one 15-3 Kira to our brother
[15:44] Bonham 7md this is just to recap what
[15:53] the key to this age is most evidently
[15:57] tribulation
[16:02] that's our form this meera church age to
[16:09] this age is most evidently tribulation
[16:14] Vida mala if there was a tribulation in
[16:18] the first age there is now predicted in
[16:23] intensified tribulation throughout the
[16:26] second age limit not ready in
[16:28] tribulation and tone cecum eyes there is
[16:31] no doubt but what the following words of
[16:34] paul applied to the mass of christians
[16:42] whenever they were in the world and in
[16:45] every age they don't move in on
[16:47] important
[16:48] amen so we see that the key the basis of
[16:53] the edge we are speaking about
[16:55] tribulation like level above degrees no
[16:58] no power no fear a tribulation and in
[17:00] the Methodist miniature
[17:02] age 26
[17:06] but eponymous a homonym B it's a
[17:09] persecuted age God called them
[17:14] persecuted dill is absolutely perfectly
[17:16] T so Smyrna is an age of persecution of
[17:20] Muller the persecution and today we are
[17:24] gonna talk about the 10 days of
[17:26] persecution in Malaysia led to the
[17:29] tribulation because we read in the Bible
[17:33] the Madonna deeb first and the Bible
[17:36] saying that is nobility fear none of
[17:39] those things which thou shalt suffer
[17:42] Nicklin path to achieve a sufrir behold
[17:45] the devil shall cast some of you into
[17:47] prison what a cousin don't want pity
[17:50] that he may be tried and ye shall have
[17:54] tribulation 10 days what is 10 days of
[17:59] tribulation so that's the title I'm
[18:03] taking for tonight 10 days of
[18:07] tribulation we will see why the Bible
[18:11] mentioned that Smyrna is going through
[18:14] 10 days of tribulation so in the
[18:21] Methodist miniature CH h paragraph 26
[18:26] what eponymous a it's a persecuted eight
[18:30] church God called them persecuted
[18:35] remember from where we started
[18:38] what is taking place from the very first
[18:41] church is gonna continue until the
[18:45] continuous caliphs and so if the
[18:48] believers in the age of Smyrna we're
[18:50] persecuted me on 80 perfectly that means
[18:53] la Valliere the believer in the
[18:57] subsequent church age will be persecuted
[18:59] in the same way the legatus 51c
[19:02] persecuted Romania and the main reason
[19:05] of the persecution in the 8th the second
[19:08] church age has no príncipe de la
[19:10] persecución elysium abilities is to set
[19:13] up darkness people met Roger
[19:15] tenable for the coming the coming Church
[19:19] ages delegate Chris Reeve and you will
[19:23] see the bloodiest persecution
[19:25] persecution appeasement angry Nia was
[19:28] from age two or three to 312 which give
[19:35] you exactly 10 years city with an exact
[19:38] emojis on and ten years as the Bible
[19:41] said liabilities on so one day is like
[19:45] one is like a thousand is how do they
[19:52] say one year is what one day is like one
[19:58] year so 10 days is 10 years of
[20:01] persecution the persecution so this
[20:05] happen according to history this is a
[20:08] possess the knowledge to us and this man
[20:11] this Emperor from a woman Empire to set
[20:14] up a model on PA woman called Diocletian
[20:17] and we will see why the occasion came to
[20:21] play in this age and we on Second Avenue
[20:23] Adnan satiety he was setting up the tone
[20:26] it may tell you the place led to call
[20:30] the next Emperor Constantine who lumpy
[20:33] lost even constant time and you know
[20:34] under constant time this is where the
[20:38] Catholic Church was born see luckily
[20:40] biscuit allocated name so in 325 Donovan
[20:45] thank so the creation of a Catholic
[20:48] Church did not just come randomly like
[20:54] before it was a work that was a prepare
[20:58] enough want Rebecca to prepare a Satan
[21:01] was working under a certain plants that
[21:04] don't have is once a temple on knowing
[21:06] that before I can impose the Nicolette
[21:09] and here could you put some puzzle
[21:11] inequalities before the Nicolette and
[21:13] become a dog tree uncle any quiet Naveen
[21:16] Naveen blood must be shed from the
[21:19] previous church
[21:22] and blood upon I'm said if I'm doing
[21:25] according to history the new leaf to of
[21:27] Diocletian Diocletian was the bloodiest
[21:30] impeller in the whole history it was the
[21:35] age where many Christians were
[21:37] persecuted us why they call this
[21:41] miniature ch8 represented church
[21:45] enlargement what took place here
[21:48] persecution continued until the end
[21:50] lapis aq a continuous color famine and
[21:52] that's why under the Catholic leadership
[21:55] conduct a pattern no Kristin was even
[21:58] allowed to read the Bible a permanent
[22:01] melody because they found the seat of
[22:05] Satan as you see the church age is
[22:11] moving well example whether you have to
[22:13] be mindful to catch the spirit of a
[22:17] twentieth part of the component here
[22:18] they lost their first love for me remove
[22:22] here came a bitterness in a meal to meal
[22:24] and Pergamos Belgium means just wait
[22:28] video male so it was the only age where
[22:35] politics and religion become together la
[22:38] political evolution city if today we can
[22:41] see a lost every political leader who
[22:44] seconded aa politic I am the leadership
[22:47] of the church the convict the legalese
[22:50] talking about a Catholic Church along
[22:52] the revista to that started actually
[22:54] here lucuma see on fait là-bas
[22:56] where politics and religion became one
[23:00] Lola political religion today when they
[23:02] found one boss is improving answered
[23:04] patron it's the Pope little pub this was
[23:08] the top of the Nicolaitans plus Italian
[23:11] develop real evidence so today in the
[23:13] world regardless of who the president of
[23:16] the country is important president EP
[23:18] whatever they can hold very nearly for
[23:22] the pop I've not / all about this and
[23:25] cream tooth and nobody can go see the
[23:27] pop / 420 Valley pub with your paint the
[23:31] CAF not closed
[23:37] if you perceive every president check
[23:41] president will uncover their parents are
[23:43] in support and when you go it comes with
[23:46] a you kneel down you kiss his ring who
[23:49] possess a bag and when you go out it
[23:52] goes up you can never turn their back to
[23:54] the Pope when approvals I'm a tornado
[23:55] pup and in this age we have a great
[23:59] Minister William a fire to serve and he
[24:06] said I'm gonna have an appointment said
[24:08] by mr. Brownback you see the Pope I'm on
[24:11] the roof a partnership bloom but Tuvalu
[24:13] but they asked him already Monday when
[24:15] you go to their podium you have to call
[24:17] him we have to respect it but what I'm
[24:20] saying I have no problem about it but
[24:22] I'm in a party part as far as me bowing
[24:26] down there is only one I should bow he
[24:32] could not he never met the Pope denies
[24:34] American contribute pop because
[24:35] everybody you meet the party we can
[24:38] continue but we know the condition
[24:40] condition you have to bow before Obama
[24:44] in turn done you name them will it know
[24:48] me tooth every president shocked crazy
[24:50] don't even from face Mandela for when
[24:53] they go there even have to bow they have
[24:57] to bow only before that if today we see
[25:04] all these things taking place suppose
[25:07] it's because what the Nicolaitans has
[25:09] set the could the secular new collide
[25:11] and in the third church age imagine this
[25:15] is where they made the pact the Lucky's
[25:17] not fell apart and then I see a council
[25:20] they say we don't care about the Bible
[25:23] the only thing we care about the second
[25:26] example is what the Pope says and the
[25:29] Pope himself in the problem is
[25:31] Antichrist we don't decrease so that was
[25:33] the age of marriage until a new marriage
[25:35] they follow an age the age of title idea
[25:40] the word tight area means the multimedia
[25:43] a dominating female in
[25:46] they'll move in funky do mean do me not
[25:48] it's gonna be very interesting here
[25:52] Acharya means a dominating female that
[25:56] you video in female domine on and
[25:57] brother but I'm told us wherever you
[26:01] find a female dominating it's a curse /
[26:04] - what Infantino means between
[26:06] malediction and that came through out a
[26:08] church age if you read a letter that I
[26:13] let to date age of tight I realized it
[26:16] you the Bible we say they hate that
[26:19] woman Jezebel Isabel tight area
[26:25] dominating female funky doctrine the
[26:28] cream of Jezebel
[26:30] that's the continuity no silicone that's
[26:32] who that spirit being carried on to the
[26:35] last church age that's why you'll find
[26:38] Laodicea to allow the same means given
[26:42] people's right dude why do purple you
[26:45] cannot tell that you see em something
[26:47] bad your Pikachu's allowed either you be
[26:50] the pastor who try to call the preacher
[26:52] whatever you want to do people will just
[26:54] continue to watch and we're going to do
[26:57] what they want to do continue hatha and
[26:59] you cannot tell them more because I will
[27:02] tell you the video is our privilege as
[27:04] Americans in new privilege on taught
[27:06] America but you see where the church age
[27:09] is starting and we're at hand
[27:12] jacquimo selasa fini people's right this
[27:18] is my right that's the amount one you
[27:19] cannot take it you cannot tell me am i
[27:22] right which whatever you want you wait
[27:25] to yourself I'm gonna do what I have to
[27:30] the seven churches God promised the
[27:33] rapture you approve me long live more so
[27:36] if you don't pay attention to those
[27:38] edges spirit upon spirits having forward
[27:43] whether you will be dead with the spirit
[27:46] of the ages alimony ridiculous
[27:48] redesigned
[27:48] not even realizing what you are doing
[27:51] really is an empathic effect and we
[27:53] thank God in over now few because these
[27:56] seven Church ages but with it settled
[27:59] illegally
[27:59] there were so many name of the cities in
[28:02] minor Asia
[28:03] bokuden on the vid on Lhasa meaner but
[28:06] the 7-piece cities there were pointed it
[28:12] was not appointed by any chance point
[28:15] apart from the meaning of their names
[28:18] from the beginning to the end it was God
[28:22] speaking they did what the continuity of
[28:25] the Spirit of God there are community
[28:27] needed to help his children and no one
[28:31] could discover all these things a funny
[28:33] political until God Himself come down in
[28:36] the last days and give them master to a
[28:40] personal miss example and when the
[28:42] Prophet spoke the message total profit
[28:44] upon us about a seven church a draw us a
[28:48] picture you like they seen a set imagine
[28:50] one day in the midst of the audience
[28:52] toward the end right of the Branum
[28:56] Tabernacle is one antibiotic the angel
[28:59] of the Lord came down and reminded the
[29:03] same twenty Kate this message is the
[29:08] truth and is coming from the Almighty
[29:10] God to be for where they are sitting
[29:12] they should tell us the mighty hand
[29:14] writing on the wall what are you gonna
[29:18] say about the Bible like people being
[29:22] vindicated it don't confirm me and today
[29:25] usually that's what the Bible says
[29:27] blessed are those who are listening good
[29:31] blessed are those who are eating babies
[29:33] are certainly as you are sitting and
[29:36] studying if you really receive it from
[29:40] your heart this is a tremendous blessing
[29:45] so coming back to this muna church age
[29:48] the knowledge did agree with me on
[29:50] paragraph 26 a persecuted a church God
[29:57] called them per security God looked upon
[30:01] their persecutions yeah the fuel of
[30:04] persecution and gave grace to bear it
[30:08] rather regardless of what your turn
[30:11] it was a pop song regardless of what
[30:14] your problem can be reports taking photo
[30:16] problem always faithful to God
[30:18] regardless of who does what exactly
[30:22] perpendicular to look at any man without
[30:24] a pass man will always a failure you
[30:26] know Murata's you do man man will always
[30:28] fail you know as we have to issue a to
[30:31] you we provide only God will take to the
[30:35] magnitude you choose a menage mr. Lapham
[30:37] that's why as we study their seven
[30:39] church age fifty dollars of the legalese
[30:41] take your faith we never call for place
[30:44] it in the Almighty God put it in the
[30:47] church committee first non-buddhists in
[30:49] the pastor in the hospital put isn't a
[30:52] wife nobody ever personal experience
[30:56] with God because when you will be trial
[31:00] as a commissary proving nobody can face

[59:22] a policy they eat the grass of the trees
[59:26] with a modular example they eat the
[59:38] grass of the tree they back off of the
[59:42] tree of the album the grass of the

[1:00:05] Lukaku lapu-lapu they boiled the
[1:00:10] children because they were in the city
[1:00:12] but he never bullied no more guys you
[1:00:15] know pretty and one more thing Napoleon

[1:00:18] disponible

[1:00:23] have to be merciful is informative a
[1:00:25] recognition because the people you are

[1:00:52] thank God for your Christian parrot
[1:00:55] Jimmy of people who apparently and I
[1:00:57] believe they are going to hold you what
[1:00:59] you can do and to the end mother boiled
[1:01:06] their babies and idiot we don't find
[1:01:09] little mangy but a what the persecution
[1:01:12] calcification they were human being like
[1:01:15] us remain calm who say more so let's go
[1:01:21] back to the Bible the end of verse 9 of
[1:01:25] Revelation chapter 2 the Bible said I
[1:01:30] know the blasphemy of them which say
[1:01:32] they are Jews
[1:01:34] cannelli blossom the circuit is Kidsongs
[1:01:36] reef and are not but are the synagogue
[1:01:39] of Satan a synagogue we sat on now the
[1:01:42] synagogue of Satan is very important to
[1:01:45] understand that concept
[1:01:46] my goodness it was important to
[1:01:48] compensate concept a synagogue is not a
[1:01:51] church and if I mean eglise a church is
[1:01:55] a place where people gather you know and
[1:01:57] all these young people to worship God
[1:01:59] but not all the gatherings not to
[1:02:02] intervene you I have to worship God
[1:02:05] don't do it you so during the church
[1:02:06] ages abilities they start gradually come
[1:02:10] on see awesome they are gathering here
[1:02:12] most are to worship God the Papa
[1:02:14] hydrogen but was to kill a Christian
[1:02:16] City put unity and the gathering move
[1:02:19] until the niceic Assemblyman Italy
[1:02:22] Shakuni girls they gather together so
[1:02:25] assembly and they try to find a way to
[1:02:28] vellum nominee to kill Christians which
[1:02:32] we decree that's why brother Bonham
[1:02:34] telling us in the message this Mina
[1:02:37] church age paragraph 115 so that's the
[1:02:42] continuity of the Nicoletta silicon to
[1:02:44] knitted in equal I eat did you not
[1:02:47] did you notice did you to notice Ave
[1:02:51] would the Nicolaitans had got themselves
[1:02:55] a synagogue
[1:02:57] can manipulate set up of PNC doctors in
[1:02:59] a gov'ment
[1:03:00] so now synagogue is not a church it's a
[1:03:04] cadre so now in this age they say they
[1:03:09] are Christian they are Jews but they are
[1:03:12] not Mendelssohn Baconfest we are
[1:03:14] believers but they are not many other
[1:03:17] people we believe the message was until
[1:03:19] Friday don't
[1:03:20] in reality really synagogue so in
[1:03:24] synagogue of satan' this satin so the
[1:03:28] Nicolaitans has got himself a synagogue
[1:03:30] now Ali Nikolai the Bible says so here
[1:03:35] did you notice which are not tricking us
[1:03:40] what are the synagogue of Satan are they
[1:03:45] true church public has been pushed out
[1:03:49] at the on the Nicolaitans Lena :
[1:03:52] had taken over the plaza and they had
[1:03:56] taken over the paprika day and pushed
[1:03:59] out the people that add the holy ghost
[1:04:02] Cecilia Villa sentence so therefore
[1:04:04] alone they didn't have no use for them
[1:04:08] another pretty utility for Earth if
[1:04:10] Smyrna in Asia alla siciliana and all he
[1:04:13] knew that the things additional kun is a
[1:04:16] show that marches grounds would have
[1:04:19] waited them Telugu Honda mafia Tony I
[1:04:22] would ever shoot is a massive way so
[1:04:28] those people of the Nicolaitans is not
[1:04:32] an equal and they form a synagogue a
[1:04:34] group of worship a group of God and in
[1:04:39] the seven church age book smearing a
[1:04:42] church age paragraph 120 - - what a
[1:04:47] bottom said is they were not the true
[1:04:51] church with a palette a big leaves but
[1:04:53] of their false church because God said
[1:04:55] my mother's name is mobility they were
[1:04:58] the synagogue of Satan now their word
[1:05:02] synagogue is not the same word we use
[1:05:06] for church
[1:05:07] Morgan is not fully do you understand
[1:05:10] let's go to completion when they talk
[1:05:12] about synagogue policy no good it
[1:05:14] doesn't mean the church everybody
[1:05:15] Wrigley's come on brother David
[1:05:31] in the exposition of the church age
[1:05:34] analytics position the large villages in
[1:05:41] the Bible donna biebe church means they
[1:05:43] called out one civilian visit really oh
[1:05:46] there's someone's one who's recent
[1:05:49] Opilio that's the meaning of church
[1:05:51] people called out let's go kiss on top
[1:05:53] william softy but the meaning of
[1:05:57] synagogue is assembly or gathering
[1:06:01] assembly assembly mom
[1:06:03] this can be good or bad mood so when
[1:06:07] they talk about synagogue it's just a
[1:06:11] gathering few staff assembly moon but
[1:06:13] the meaning of synagogue is assembly or
[1:06:15] gathering so as we read in the book of
[1:06:23] they are not jews were synagogue of
[1:06:26] satan so this can be good or bad but in
[1:06:31] this case it is vitam all day because
[1:06:35] for this are they whose assembling is
[1:06:40] not of god but of their own self from
[1:06:44] lollipop would you maple mmm so those
[1:06:47] people are lost eternally
[1:06:48] starting with this mean a church age
[1:06:51] gathering together I found God was not
[1:06:54] impunity plodded on so as they move to
[1:06:56] the next church age when I see a crowd a
[1:07:01] synagogue of the gathering God was not
[1:07:05] in their unity fun but the purpose of
[1:07:07] those gathering the purpose of the
[1:07:10] synagogue was to kill Christians really
[1:07:13] and persecute Christians and remember is
[1:07:17] when they've gone Trinity of the spirits
[1:07:19] in our community as we move today we
[1:07:22] have a lot of synagogues buku the
[1:07:24] synagogue you call it Church definitely
[1:07:28] but actually starting with the pastor
[1:07:32] his purpose from it is to check over the
[1:07:37] Jews poop on to the controller to move
[1:07:38] the Holy Spirit aside metal essentials
[1:07:40] video cool and him too
[1:07:42] sit in the heart of the premiums are
[1:07:44] suddenly curved acquire and that's what
[1:07:46] you see sub believers if they poked away
[1:07:47] I think they just swear by their posture
[1:07:52] you have to love the pastor Amira pastor
[1:07:55] but the one who sit in your heart
[1:07:58] we cannot master video Holy Spirit
[1:08:00] Natalie must be God you are not this
[1:08:03] stupidity that we hear somebody say oh I
[1:08:07] love my pastor pastor even if I come I
[1:08:13] find my posture with the tomb open with
[1:08:15] my own wife with my thumb I will kick
[1:08:17] out the wife which asthma and keep the
[1:08:19] pastor no no no no but you are not know
[1:08:22] about revenant I'm gonna tell you that
[1:08:25] not normal
[1:08:26] independent man and if you see that if
[1:08:29] you just become a synagogue of the devil
[1:08:32] the venison above the sat on pastor get
[1:08:35] out of the believers rock so you can
[1:08:37] acquire believer don't put me in your
[1:08:39] heart don't let the Holy Spirit abide in
[1:08:43] you guide and lead you if you can reason
[1:08:46] and love me just hit me muscle no
[1:08:51] otherwise we will turn into big stuff -
[1:08:54] Nabu could achieve synagogue of Satan
[1:08:57] now going to the ten years in the
[1:09:02] message identify seven church age the
[1:09:05] church age method approach a 13 I know
