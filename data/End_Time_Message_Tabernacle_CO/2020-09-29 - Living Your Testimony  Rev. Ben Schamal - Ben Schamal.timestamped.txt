[15:44] [Music]
[15:47] familiar scripture and while you're

[15:52] say thank you to brother fosten in the

[15:58] for another opportunity to be here
[16:01] they wrote me a very nice note
[16:03] downstairs oh
[16:04] my and uh i don't think i'm i'm worthy
[16:07] of such kind words
[16:10] so we just want to say we appreciate it
[16:15] amen so revelations starting chapter
[16:18] 12 apocalypse
[16:27] let's start with verse 7
[16:30] and it reads like this and there was war
[16:34] in heaven
[16:34] michael and his angels fought against
[16:36] the dragon and the dragon fought against
[16:38] his angels
[16:40] and prevailed not neither was their
[16:42] place
[16:43] found any more in heaven and the great
[16:45] dragon was cast
[16:47] out that old serpent called the devil
[16:49] and satan
[16:50] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[16:52] cast out
[16:53] in the earth and his angels were cast
[16:55] out with him
[16:56] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[16:58] heaven now has come salvation and
[17:01] strength
[17:01] in the kingdom of our god and the power
[17:04] of his christ
[17:05] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[17:08] down which accused them before our god
[17:10] day and night
[17:11] and they overcame him by the blood of
[17:13] the lamb and by the word
[17:15] of their testimony
[18:26] like to title it living your own
[18:29] testimonies
[18:32] and we see that there are very many
[18:34] temptations out in the world
[18:38] and the devil is very clever
[18:41] and how he distracts us from our own
[18:43] testimony
[18:46] he's creating distractions and
[18:48] temptations
[18:54] not only young people but old people
[18:58] to distract ourselves from our own
[19:02] testimony amen amen
[19:06] so i want to focus on living your own
[19:09] testimony
[19:13] hey man brother branham said this world
[19:15] is going completely insane
[19:20] uh and i think we can see that so clear
[19:22] today
[19:35] you don't know whether what you read
[19:37] online is true
[19:40] or if it's false oh it's a full or
[19:42] someone that you might be talking to oh
[19:45] you don't know if your opinion may be
[19:46] true
[19:48] or if it may be false but we have one
[19:51] whom we can trust
[19:54] we have a word that is always true
[19:57] and we praise the lord for that we
[19:59] praise the lord for a prophet that would
[20:01] come down
[20:03] show us the spirit that is behind it
[20:07] that is secretly dividing the people
[20:11] we have a very prominent catholic spirit
[20:13] today
[20:16] that is moving up among the earth
[20:45] that if you don't do this writer don't
[20:47] do that
[20:51] they're trying to divide different races
[20:55] they're trying every angle they can
[20:57] divide
[21:00] and we can see it out in the world
[21:04] but i think we need to look at ourselves
[21:06] in the church
[21:08] that's happening out there the devil
[21:11] isn't going to leave us alone
[21:14] but the devil
[21:40] [Music]
[21:43] so the devil is trying to distract us by
[21:45] using all these different things
[21:48] we see the politics the sickness
[21:52] the discontentment it's all to get our
[21:55] eyes
[22:09] he can't get your eyes on on politics
[22:13] then he will try something else maybe
[22:15] he'll try to get your eyes on another
[22:17] brother
[22:19] maybe he has such a great test
[22:22] i wish i had a testimony
[22:51] amen the scriptures say in second
[22:53] timothy 3
[22:55] it says and know this also
[22:59] that in the last days perilous times
[23:02] shall come
[23:05] amen can we identify with that scripture
[23:09] perilous means difficult or hard times
[23:14] so in the last days difficult times
[23:15] shall come
[23:19] there we are
[23:42] without natural affection
[23:45] that's homosexuality that's
[23:47] homosexuality and
[23:48] have we ever seen a time in the history
[23:51] of the world
[23:53] where this has become so prominent
[23:56] where sinners are so unashamed to come
[23:59] out of the closet
[24:02] and show forth all of this sin and faith
[24:06] something that the lord hates
[24:09] homosexuality is a spirit
[24:12] and if you uh maybe we think oh this
[24:14] this isn't in the message
[24:29] amen amen without natural affection
[24:33] true space false accusers
[24:37] incontinence that word means lack of
[24:40] self-control
[24:44] we see that in the world today people
[24:46] just can't seem to control themselves
[24:50] fierce despisers yeah those that are
[24:52] good
[24:53] traitors
[24:59] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[25:01] god i mean developed
[25:03] you having a form of godliness
[25:08] well this is where we're going to drive
[25:10] it down now
[25:12] having a form of godliness
[25:15] but denying the power thereof
[25:22] i have a form of godliness
[25:24] [Music]
[26:03] uh just politics and how how the world
[26:06] is going
[26:08] to come
[26:17] and and and it's gotten to where the
[26:19] president of the united states
[26:21] is going to ban this app he said
[26:32] it's an app i guess where you can have
[26:34] short videos
[26:36] and you can lip sync like singing
[26:40] or all these famous people or or
[26:43] different i guess they had a wipe
[26:44] challenge
[26:48] where you wiped this way and you're your
[26:53] and then you wipe this way and you turn
[26:55] into something completely different
[26:59] what is it they're trying to be someone
[27:02] else
[27:04] they're trying to be something that god
[27:06] has not made them is they say that
[27:08] they're trying to be some famous singer
[27:10] because they said that to our ancestors
[27:11] some great somebody okay can come
[27:13] instead of living in the channel that
[27:15] god had directed
[27:18] amen
[27:31] we don't use that word very often
[27:35] what does the word pharisee mean
[27:38] he said in greek it means an actor
[27:42] someone who acts
[27:59] many times people are trying to act like
[28:01] the other fellow bless your followers
[28:04] it says listen you quit trying to act
[28:07] like that next fellow
[28:10] and just act out your own convictions
[28:13] and you'll get along
[28:20] you see so many little children going to
[28:22] a picture show
[28:26] the cinema and they come back and want
[28:28] to act like the actress
[28:32] what does brother branham say he says
[28:33] shame on you
[28:37] the american people through television
[28:41] they have seen so much of the put on his
[28:43] own v-book
[28:44] [Music]
[28:46] till they become put on themselves
[28:50] that's too bad and we get it
[28:53] in church please
[29:12] amen and he goes on to talk about how
[29:15] some people come up and they'd like to
[29:17] do specials
[29:21] until their face turns blue uh
[29:25] they they hold he they hold their note
[29:29] when they're singing until their face
[29:31] turns blue
[29:34] why because they're trying to be
[29:36] something
[29:38] instead of just worshiping god and then
[29:40] when they come off the platform
[29:43] they're not thinking about praising the
[29:45] lord they're not thinking about his
[29:47] goodness
[29:49] but they're thinking of who they may
[29:50] have impressed me the city is all
[29:52] important because they could hold such a
[29:54] note
[29:58] what a wrong attitude attitude
[30:01] what a thought process okay that we are
[30:04] trying to steal the glory of god
[30:19] in the message my angel shall go before
[30:21] thee
[30:24] brother branham says jeremiah the
[30:25] prophet
[30:27] god said before you was even formed in
[30:29] your mother's womb
[30:32] i knew you and sanctified you
[30:48] see gifts and callings are without
[30:49] repentance
[30:52] god gives them you can't help cause
[30:56] you have you can't help because you have
[30:57] blue eyes
[31:01] taking thought can add one cubit to his
[31:03] stature
[31:07] amen he says therefore the thing has got
[31:09] down into the world today
[31:14] with a bunch of isms and it is
[31:18] it's absolutely absolutely and he's
[31:20] going to nail it on the head right here
[31:23] he says it's nothing but a work of satan
[31:29] try to take away from the real thing of
[31:31] god
[31:34] amen i hope we can see that this morning
[31:40] so we see that us trying to put on uh
[31:43] they said that
[32:11] you must live your own
[32:15] amen amen god has put you here for a
[32:18] reason
[32:19] it's a very specific reason you guys
[32:21] don't specific and the only one that can
[32:23] fulfill that right
[32:38] so we know that there is a very high
[32:41] importance
[32:44] of having a personal testimony
[32:47] as young people a lot of times we base
[32:49] our our
[32:51] uh spirituality on our parents
[32:54] spirituality
[33:06] brother branham said we must have a time
[33:07] in our life
[33:12] and we can point the devil
[33:16] amen amen
[33:24] look at an example in the scripture here
[33:29] we look at the story of david uh david
[33:32] was one of many brothers
[33:36] he was possibly the smallest of all of
[33:38] his brothers
[33:39] [Music]
[33:41] maybe he stood shorter he didn't have
[33:44] the big muscles
[33:47] he maybe felt insignificant significant
[34:04] why because they had gone off to war
[34:07] girl they had the uniforms
[34:09] they stood so tall oh is it this year
[34:11] they were fighting for the country
[34:13] david was patriotic too oh david you
[34:16] wanted to do the same you've lost your
[34:17] fellow members what was he doing
[35:00] [Music]
[35:06] it was a difficulty that arose in his
[35:08] everyday life
[35:11] something arose in his life okay
[35:44] david was building his own testimony
[35:48] amen amen his own personal testimony
[35:55] amen and and i want you to realize that
[35:58] if david had his eyes on someone else
[36:01] he was trying to be something that god
[36:03] has noticed
[36:04] [Music]
[36:06] if he was trying to be the joker in in
[36:08] solomon's court oh see they say that's
[36:10] when
[36:24] david would not have that testimony
[36:26] david
[36:28] because he was trying to blaze his own
[36:30] trail
[36:33] instead of walking the trail of life
[36:36] that god had chosen
[36:42] and god doesn't call amanda judgment
[36:44] without first warning
[36:47] [Music]
[36:48] and this is a paragraph starting 35.
[37:04] and that reason that he has put us here
[37:06] foreign
[37:18] he says you should go to him and find
[37:19] out what he wants
[37:22] [Music]
[37:51] how many times do we want to just do
[37:52] something so big
[37:54] i want to show that yeah
[37:58] that may not be what god has for your
[38:00] life
[38:02] like brother branham
[38:13] maybe your purpose in life is to vacuum
[38:16] the carpets
[38:30] not everyone is supposed to be a a
[38:32] preacher behind the pope
[38:36] there's a very very wise man that said
[38:38] oh yeah i know
[38:40] preach always
[38:43] use words when necessary
[38:47] each one of us should have a personal
[38:49] testimony
[38:51] and living life you will preach that
[38:53] testimony
[38:57] a man a man 37 brother branham says
[39:00] firecraft wants it for one md you say
[39:02] well the trouble of it is would it be
[39:05] each one of us wants to do the next
[39:07] man's job
[39:10] we all want to pack the ball up
[39:15] he's talking about football there's one
[39:18] ball
[39:19] and eleven men on each side
[39:24] if everyone wanted to carry the ball
[39:34] but someone has to get the ball off the
[39:36] ground
[39:39] and hand it to the quarterback and then
[39:42] the quarterback hands it to a running
[39:43] back
[39:45] and if the offensive line is la lino
[39:49] they just want to have the ball they
[39:50] just then they're going to tackle the
[39:52] running back
[39:53] hello alvanta clayton
[40:07] so he goes and tackles the running back
[40:36] foreign
[40:40] 39 brother braham says and that's the
[40:41] way it is with people
[40:45] we've all the body of christ
[40:49] has got to be in their position
[41:04] every man that's come on the face of the
[41:05] earth
[41:08] has to answer to god for our
[41:09] responsibility
[41:12] and too many of us a stewardship we have
[41:16] to answer for uh
[41:43] that's right if it's to be a farmer
[41:59] you've got to answer to god
[42:28] he says but if we all just find our
[42:30] calling in god and abide there
[42:35] god knows just when to use us
[42:38] and how to use it and we don't want to
[42:42] be jumping around here and there
[42:45] but where god puts you be original
[42:49] be just what god wants you to say
[42:55] so we see david if david was trying to
[42:56] run around i don't know
[42:59] i don't want to be a sheep i want to be
[43:03] uh uh um uh some great
[43:06] uh uh warrior in the army
[43:19] well maybe i want to be somebody that's
[43:21] that's just really funny
[43:22] and that everybody likes uh
[43:27] and he's off doing uh different social
[43:29] gatherings
[43:33] instead of counting the
[43:36] he would have been out of the will of
[43:38] god
[43:52] david was faced with a goliath's life
[43:56] he was ready for the task
[44:01] because he was unknowingly preparing
[44:04] himself
[44:05] oh pascal in city pancakes
[44:33] this is such a hard trial no one in the
[44:36] world has faced corona
[44:39] how are you going to open it
[44:43] what was david's response to david
[44:46] well it was it i i feel that i'm just so
[44:49] strong
[44:51] oh my trust is in my sling oh my
[44:53] confidence
[44:55] i'm such a good shot oh
[44:58] i i feel like i can take the devil on oh
[45:09] [Music]
[45:15] that he could recognize was not his
[45:18] own doing but it was god
[45:22] leading him to a certain point and he
[45:26] could say
[45:26] god you delivered the bear i i didn't
[45:30] tell my hand looks
[45:46] can you imagine if if he would have uh
[45:49] if david would have come up to goliath
[45:54] relying on moses's testimony
[45:59] and instead of going down to the brook
[46:01] and grabbing five smooths
[46:05] he goes to the woods and he grabs us
[46:09] a stick oh
[46:13] hmm allah he walks up to goliath
[46:16] and he taps that stick uh no he points
[46:18] the button and he says leave my people
[46:20] and
[46:20] no less what do you think the devil
[46:24] would have done yes
[46:26] i think he would have done the same
[46:27] thing that the devil did in acts 19.
[46:33] cause paul was going around casting out
[46:34] all these devils
[46:37] and someone else wanted to live paul's
[46:40] testimony
[46:55] took up to them to call over
[46:59] which had evil spirits in the name of
[47:01] the lord jesus
[47:03] christ saying we adjure you
[47:07] by the jesus jesus whom
[47:10] paul preaches oh no
[47:15] we enjoy you i love you by jesus
[47:19] who paul preached he was trying to live
[47:23] the testimony that paul had
[47:25] said and verse 15 says and the spirit
[47:29] answered and said obviously
[47:32] jesus i know paul i know
[47:36] but who are you
[47:40] this man didn't have his own personal
[47:42] testimony
[47:43] he's trying to live the testimony of
[47:45] paul
[47:47] knows that jesus is right he knows that
[47:50] paul is
[47:52] and he's trying to cast out the devil
[47:53] maybe they say on someone else's
[47:56] testimony
[47:58] that won't work the goliath in your life
[48:02] must be overcome by the david in your
[48:05] heart
[48:06] oh about by the david in your apartment
[48:12] it can't be overcome by anyone else
[48:16] and we think oh this man was just so
[48:18] silly
[48:31] if we were to say the same scripture
[48:34] [Music]
[48:35] in today's world
[48:38] maybe someone would come and say devil
[48:42] we adjure you
[48:44] in the name of jesus christ
[48:54] see it doesn't sound so far off now
[48:55] allow someone somebody
[48:59] but you're relying on the testimony that
[49:01] brother branham had
[49:03] [Music]
[49:04] to cast out all of these things because
[49:08] i'm a message believer but you have to
[49:09] go away
[49:12] no no no we must have a personal test
[49:43] because they're not afraid of of paul
[49:44] when he's off far away
[49:48] cast him out in the name of paul or
[49:50] whatever it doesn't matter
[49:53] they know who he is
[49:56] but amen we must have our own personal
[50:00] testimony
[50:02] so i hope that we can see where we're at
[50:04] today
[50:07] all of these distractions are to get our
[50:11] eyes off of our
[50:12] own personal testimony
[50:18] would we be so worried about what
[50:19] brother so-and-so is doing
[50:22] disagree with this
[50:37] we can't look at others we have to look
[50:38] at ourselves
[50:51] when he's got the edge on you he likes
[50:54] to boast and carry on like that
[50:59] oh he gives a big boast oh i love you so
[51:02] every one of them hello
[51:04] all of them big degrees uh two seconds
[51:10] goliath comes up and he starts making
[51:12] this big boast
[51:14] why because the the israelites were
[51:16] feeling small pascal israel
[51:19] they didn't have just a big revival
[51:21] inaudible
[51:22] but they had been uh fighting and
[51:24] fighting music
[51:26] and they felt weak and they felt small
[51:30] this is a song
[51:30] to pity and see that is when the devil
[51:33] likes to make it
[51:54] did you ever notice 40 is the number of
[51:56] temptations
[52:01] what year are we living in 2020
[52:04] don't read too far into that but i think
[52:06] we can all agree that we're in the year
[52:08] of temptation
[52:13] brother it happened to fall on the wrong
[52:15] ear that morning
[52:27] praise the lord this is one of my
[52:29] favorite verses since you
[52:43] we think our basketball players are tall
[52:44] no the basketball song
[52:47] there's six eight are you some questions
[52:51] imagine nine feet three inches are you
[52:53] imagining
[52:55] big huge man contomo and he wasn't
[52:58] skinny
[52:58] along your dipper he was a big man
[53:01] and he could crush you
[53:06] and he is making a big boast
[53:10] but it it it fell on the wrong ears that
[53:12] morning
[53:16] because a little four foot eight four
[53:18] foot nine little man
[53:21] the height
[53:25] he knew where he stood
[53:36] because david had a confidence
[53:40] in his testimony
[53:50] it didn't matter if it was a nine foot
[53:52] three six
[53:57] [Music]
[54:35] but god made you
[54:49] we've still got david's too
[54:52] lord amen amen so we must learn to
[54:56] profess our testimony
[55:00] when david was questioned about his
[55:02] faith what did he do
[55:06] he didn't say well i just know that i
[55:08] can take him off
[55:10] the lord's really done some things for
[55:12] me in the past
[55:14] so i know that he'll do it again
[55:19] which is good but he was professing
[55:24] his testimony
[55:29] and i i've got a scripture that we'll
[55:30] get to here in a little bit i love
[55:34] but the testimony of jesus christ
[55:37] jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy
[55:41] the prophecy
[55:44] brother branham says in perfect faith
[55:48] he says now many of you will be waiting
[55:50] over till morning
[55:53] and he talks about how people drove so
[55:55] far to see him
[56:01] and paragraph nine he says epoch of
[56:03] nephrogenesis and i
[56:04] get spells too you know hello see
[56:08] i get moody i get to a spot where it
[56:11] gets me
[56:12] oh jaggery i get
[56:46] [Music]
[56:56] all night
[57:03] [Music]
[57:11] he says i put that right back in his the
[57:13] devil's face
[57:16] and say what about that that helps me to
[57:19] overcome
[57:20] some maida vancouver what about that
[57:23] amen i think we can
[57:24] adopt that one what about that
[57:28] amen amen when the devil comes and tries
[57:30] to make his boss oh connie
[57:32] we could say well what about this dude
[57:36] amen he tries to hit you with corona
[58:19] not only do people love me but god loves
[58:21] me
[58:23] not only does he love me but he died for
[58:25] me
[58:28] not only did he die for me to redeem me
[58:31] but he made me his bride
[58:34] hallelujah
[58:47] maybe he's trying to take you with
[58:49] cancer the cancer is gone
[58:52] what about that maybe he's he's trying
[58:55] to tell you that you can't have children
[58:59] i love somebody because all life comes
[59:00] from god
[59:29] but he looked back where god had
[59:31] intervened
[59:33] what about that devil yes i am as a
[59:36] sinner
[59:37] yes i've done many backgrounds that god
[59:40] is a savior
[59:41] he has redeemed me what about that
[59:57] what is the devil going to do then
[1:00:00] david went back to his testimony
[1:00:07] saul says how are you going to overcome
[1:00:09] david hello
[1:00:11] you're so small you won't take my armor
[1:00:15] this number is so big everyone else is
[1:00:18] afraid of your temptation
[1:00:25] it seems like you can't overcome us
[1:00:26] assembling
[1:00:41] solitaire it was just me out living my
[1:00:43] normal life
[1:00:45] and a trial came my way uh
[1:00:49] and god brought me through it
[1:00:53] i chased that lion down
[1:01:22] he threw
[1:01:33] you can't stop halfway through when you
[1:01:35] get a partial victory people still pay a
[1:01:37] mission
[1:01:42] i have overcome this one time
[1:01:45] david could have stopped right there
[1:01:48] picked up his sheet
[1:01:49] and went home guess what would have
[1:01:52] happened the next day
[1:01:56] the lion would have come right back
[1:01:59] stole the same sheep
[1:02:01] and david would be doing it but we must
[1:02:04] have complete deliverance
[1:02:07] holy to the lord so when he hits that
[1:02:10] line with the stones
[1:02:13] he drops the sheep david ran to him
[1:02:17] grab the lion
[1:02:44] amen if we look at the the noun of
[1:02:47] testimony
[1:02:49] what the actual word means we are giving
[1:02:52] our testimony to another brother
[1:02:56] when we're giving our testimony back to
[1:02:58] the devil
[1:03:00] what does it
[1:03:14] it's
[1:03:25] i think testimony is a very big weapon
[1:03:40] the whole scriptures when you look back
[1:03:42] was filled with
[1:03:46] moses told the children of israel over
[1:03:48] and over and over again
[1:03:51] so tell your children and your
[1:03:52] children's children
[1:03:54] it was on funding tell them what the
[1:03:56] lord has done for you
[1:03:58] always be speaking those good things did
[1:04:01] you hear him say
[1:04:02] i've ever wanted you should tear down
[1:04:05] the preacher
[1:04:08] and you should tear down the deacon if
[1:04:09] you don't like
[1:04:24] amen amen praise the lord so it's
[1:04:27] important
[1:04:28] that we have a testimony and it's
[1:04:31] important
[1:04:32] that we profess that testimony
[1:04:36] amen brother branham said that no child
[1:04:38] of god is going to go around walking
[1:04:39] around saying
[1:04:40] oh i lost my healing
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:46] i had the holy ghost but i
[1:04:50] i think i lost i'll measure this way
[1:04:53] a child of god's not going to do that
[1:04:57] no no proverbs 18 and 21.
[1:05:02] says death and life are the in the power
[1:05:06] of
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:20] a wholesome tongue is a tree of life
[1:05:27] but perverseness therein is a breach
[1:05:31] in the spirit it is free
[1:05:36] how many times do we catch ourselves
[1:05:37] saying negative things
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:40] negative and for what
[1:05:44] do those negative things really help us
[1:05:46] out
[1:05:48] negative but no it it creates a
[1:05:51] breach in the spirit
[1:05:55] that creates bitterness it creates
[1:05:58] separation
[1:06:00] it creates division
[1:06:24] amen brother branham says in accepting
[1:06:26] god's gift
[1:06:28] only he said now healing's not something
[1:06:30] that you'll just say oh well yeah i
[1:06:32] believe it uh
[1:06:37] he said no that's all right but that
[1:06:41] if that's the best you can do he said
[1:06:44] just
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:07:09] say it out loud
[1:07:26] why would i say
[1:07:39] because if i say i am healed
[1:08:08] he had the razor he was going to start
[1:08:10] shaving
[1:08:12] and his eyes pop open why because the
[1:08:15] testimony of
[1:08:16] jesus is the spirit of prophecy
[1:08:20] amen amen so say it out loud
[1:08:24] hallelujah hallelujah just keep saying
[1:08:27] i'm healed i'm healed
[1:08:29] say it until actually you believe it
[1:08:35] if you can't even believe it yourself
[1:08:38] you can't believe yourself
[1:08:40] that you are healed then say it and say
[1:08:43] it
[1:08:44] and say hello
[1:08:49] amen don't be ashamed of the gospel
[1:08:53] no but say i am healed yesterday until
[1:08:56] you believe just a second
[1:08:58] and listen to what brother branson and
[1:09:00] he says and when you believe if you come
[1:09:02] for
[1:09:02] that then it's going to take place
[1:09:06] don't have a negative test negative
[1:09:10] every time when you confess well i still
[1:09:13] feel bad today
[1:09:15] you go straight back in the same rut
[1:09:32] i believe
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:14] is so that's what we're doing this is a
[1:10:17] second
[1:10:18] we're identifying scenarios and his
[1:10:20] tricks
[1:10:21] and we're saying we will overcome it
[1:10:23] because i don't use my tests
[1:10:26] i've had this weapon in my pocket
[1:10:31] i've had a testimonial since the moment
[1:10:34] i was born
[1:10:35] i was already one in a million i came to
[1:10:38] life you gave me life i've had a
[1:10:42] testimonial
[1:10:56] then why wouldn't
[1:11:06] there could be entire sermons preached
[1:11:08] on on
[1:11:10] words
[1:11:24] two words
[1:12:05] because god had given him a testimony
[1:12:20] very familiar scripture here
[1:12:23] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[1:12:28] and he said unto me see that i'll do it
[1:12:32] for i am my fellow servant and of thy
[1:12:34] brother
[1:12:38] have the testimony of jesus
[1:12:42] worship god he said
[1:12:45] for the testimony of jesus christ
[1:13:01] but the testimony of jesus
[1:13:04] is the spirit of prophet prophecy
[1:13:08] so if we are not professing a testimony
[1:13:10] of jesus
[1:13:13] then how are those things ever going to
[1:13:14] come to pass
[1:13:21] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:13:24] the lamb
[1:13:28] and the word of their testimony
[1:13:41] maybe you have a great testimony
[1:13:56] then you must find out what you're
[1:13:58] testing
[1:14:13] tell other people what the lord has done
[1:14:15] for you
[1:14:19] it used to be that people all the time
[1:14:22] when they were at church coins they
[1:14:24] would ask what has the lord done for you
[1:14:26] secretary
[1:14:40] um
[1:14:44] well i remember a tick tock video uh
[1:14:49] but i can't remember what the lord's
[1:14:51] done for me
[1:14:54] um satan's done a pretty good job
[1:14:57] is that distracting us what's important
[1:15:03] amen do we see that hebrews 11 5.
[1:15:08] and enoch was translated
[1:15:12] that he should not see death i think
[1:15:15] and was found not oh you need to point
[1:15:18] because god has translated
[1:15:35] what a testimony
[1:15:49] if you don't have another testimony that
[1:15:51] you can tell other people
[1:15:53] is that i am a christian and i please
[1:15:56] the lord
[1:15:57] with what i do
[1:16:00] what an incredible testimony
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:04] it wasn't i was a drunk
[1:16:32] says for whosoever is born of god
[1:16:36] overcometh the world
[1:16:40] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:16:42] the world
[1:16:44] even our faith that scripture is saying
[1:16:48] we overcome
[1:16:49] educators by faith
[1:16:53] when you become a child of god
[1:16:56] you can overcome the world verse five oh
[1:17:01] who is he that overcometh the world
[1:17:05] but he that believeth that jesus is the
[1:17:08] son of god
[1:17:11] if your testimony is that i believe that
[1:17:14] jesus christ
[1:17:15] is the son of god
[1:17:18] christians all you know foreign
[1:17:31] you can overcome
[1:17:35] that testimonial will overcome any
[1:17:38] goliath
[1:17:42] do we see how powerful our testimony
[1:17:47] praise the lord first john 4 4.
[1:17:53] ye are of god little children
[1:18:10] so if you're building your testimony and
[1:18:14] all i know is that
[1:18:15] jesus christ is the son of god
[1:18:18] and the son of god lives in me then i
[1:18:21] can overcome anything
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:38] but overcome
[1:18:51] if you wake up grouchy in the morning
[1:19:21] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:19:25] but be of good be of good cheer me
[1:19:29] because i have overcome the lord god has
[1:19:32] already overcome the world
[1:19:51] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:19:53] things uh
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:58] it didn't say he that overcometh
[1:20:01] shall inherit everything but healing
[1:20:05] to choose my son or he that overcometh
[1:20:08] shall inherit all things but a good job
[1:20:13] will allow me to be on in church i love
[1:20:16] you
[1:20:42] but that shows the greatness of god
[1:20:57] the resurrection of jesus 56. jesus
[1:21:00] christ
[1:21:01] i'll read this one more close it's only
[1:21:02] see brother branham said if you notice
[1:21:06] it's when you're discouraged when the
[1:21:08] devil can really pour it on you
[1:21:15] if you come to church and say well i
[1:21:17] don't know souvenir visit is the branch
[1:21:19] and super
[1:21:20] i don't know if it'll ever get better or
[1:21:21] not i've been prayed for twice
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:39] i've already been prayed for twice
[1:21:42] just go home you're going to hinder
[1:21:44] those around you
[1:21:48] come to the throne
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:55] we underestimate the power of god
[1:22:01] it boggles my mind sometimes
[1:22:05] just looking at grace you can always see
[1:22:08] how god can
[1:22:09] bestow grace on other people and she's
[1:22:11] welcome on youtube
[1:22:12] on ourselves and go how could god love
[1:22:14] me how could god
[1:22:16] give you me no more we don't understand
[1:22:18] what i've done
[1:22:26] well you might as well just go home
[1:22:31] but when you can cast that aside
[1:22:36] listen listen
[1:22:49] i'm preaching it myself right here oh
[1:22:51] julius crush there's people that don't
[1:22:53] even know i smile
[1:22:58] there's somebody came up to my sisters
[1:22:59] one time and says
[1:23:04] he's always just so serious
[1:23:09] see i don't just preach it you guys i
[1:23:10] preach it myself
[1:23:13] i think that happens all the time
[1:23:14] doesn't it brother foster when you're
[1:23:16] preaching
[1:23:17] you're preaching because because of an
[1:23:18] experience that's happening in your life
[1:23:22] but we ought to be happy god doesn't
[1:23:24] want us to feel beaten
[1:23:26] yeah he doesn't want us to feel like we
[1:23:28] can't overcome it
[1:23:29] but he wants us to feel that we can
[1:23:30] overthrow and if we can overcome
[1:24:00] listen
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:15] don't never be upset in this way
[1:24:18] just walk in his love amen knowing that
[1:24:21] you're walking in him
[1:24:24] and nothing can harm you
[1:24:28] there's nothing that can harm you
[1:24:30] there's no powers
[1:24:32] things present things future
[1:24:35] nothing can separate us
[1:24:41] and we'll never come in by
[1:24:54] so that's his business to take care
[1:25:07] do you think little kids running around
[1:25:09] are worried if their parents are going
[1:25:10] to take care of them
[1:25:15] because they know their parents love
[1:25:16] them
[1:25:18] they expect for their parents to take
[1:25:19] care of it
[1:25:22] they expect their parents tell them get
[1:25:24] dressed
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:28] right it's time for breakfast
