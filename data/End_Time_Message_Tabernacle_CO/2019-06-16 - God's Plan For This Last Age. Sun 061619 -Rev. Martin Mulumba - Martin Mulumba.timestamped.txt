[4:39] Day so Monterey colon cancer walk-ins
[4:41] Avenger special ability pair by the
[4:44] profit of taught us that every day
[4:46] should be Father's Day Mary Poppins idk
[4:48] to Lucilla Judy pair because this is
[4:51] where the great unknown thing begins
[4:54] solarium hormones because David the
[4:59] father of Solomon David Lee Petaluma and
[5:03] was a such a person who understood this
[5:06] great burden
[5:08] have accomplished a confounder when
[5:11] you're reading the book of psalm
[5:12] accomplished gonna leave a tip-- zone it
[5:14] was such a man who set and prayed for
[5:17] his son it's a channel keep people some
[5:19] visa and when Solomon is turned econ
[5:23] only to the saloon
[5:24] he started also praying for his son with
[5:26] cripples Anfisa you understand that even
[5:29] got himself compromising on women I
[5:32] started saying they teach these things
[5:35] on census II unto your son of official
[5:38] and your son son of his devotees you
[5:41] understand that this is a great
[5:42] responsibility responsibility when you
[5:45] look there is a pardon in the Bible he
[5:48] didn't own a Bible because God Himself
[5:51] came and taught that to his son Moses it
[5:54] is a policy choice on Christmas and the
[5:56] son could do nothing except Eocene first
[5:58] done by the fire responsibility and when
[6:07] the father every father can see the
[6:09] pattern of a good father in the Bible a
[6:11] common lineage the only people then it
[6:15] can also have his son also learn the
[6:17] same thing so you can also give it to
[6:19] the museum
[6:24] every man can have ideas a computer what
[6:28] is a day can have way of doing things
[6:30] without issues but there we have a
[6:33] resource in the Rhoyne salsa where we
[6:35] know that when we pick up from that
[6:37] resource is a toxin we will always be
[6:42] and it also it is a responsibility to
[6:46] the children's ability to do something
[6:48] and when the children can sit and look
[6:50] into the word okones I understand the
[6:54] father's position in the family they can
[6:58] also be grateful unto the father's that
[7:00] mechanism
[7:01] Devon repair because the Bible says why
[7:05] son my son emphasized arif defy his
[7:10] father's instruction because the father
[7:13] didn't make it up you are saying it from
[7:16] the father and the father is the
[7:19] heavenly father you know silicon celeste
[7:21] and jesus prayed
[7:24] let thy will be done on earth as it is
[7:26] in the power preset accomplish yet the
[7:29] son can see the father receiving
[7:31] instruction from the Heavenly Father and
[7:36] surely know that this is a great
[7:38] blessing compensation company that if
[7:41] father doesn't just make up stuff to
[7:43] come and tell them therefore the Bible
[7:49] the Prophet says in leadership 1965
[8:01] paragraph 27 the first is the maddest
[8:05] kindness then the fathers would after
[8:10] the mother gives you your first step to
[8:13] put me out then you look to your daddy I
[8:15] love waking out about prepare all of us
[8:17] for wisdom apologize because God his day
[8:23] God has put him as the head of the house
[8:25] it's your dream accomplished chef de la
[8:26] maison note that it is any smaller
[8:29] apartment is just made leader of his
[8:32] family say because when you look in the
[8:35] wilderness chiefs of hundreds chiefs do
[8:43] with chiefs of hundreds to the chef
[8:45] Davidi chef's this song do with chiefs
[8:47] of thousands we have additionally they
[8:51] were Chiefs of 10,000
[8:53] and God also in his great plan he'd use
[8:56] it on say kun has also placed men in a
[9:01] certain with a certain capacity certain
[9:03] capacity to lead 5 to 10 15 and all this
[9:10] man misses on all this woman hundred
[9:13] this little Shih Tzu said Khan have to
[9:15] recognize even econet that's why when
[9:17] God came down consciously to speak to
[9:20] his prophet Moses if we say that this is
[9:22] the commandment SEC that is attached
[9:25] with the problem it wasn't to love God
[9:29] it wasn't to respect other fathers that
[9:34] food should be you obey and respect is
[9:38] expected parents that's the Bible also
[9:41] that people that's the pardon of the
[9:43] Bible because the Bible says my son
[9:47] forget not my law because the father has
[9:51] become the same word remember God is
[9:55] spoken with ya but let dine honey P but
[9:58] I heard keep my Commandments on for
[10:01] length of days
[10:03] that's the secret of every child you
[10:08] were 50 years old ten years old seven
[10:13] years old this promise stands true
[10:16] because Solomon when he received this
[10:20] understand I said if so is father
[10:23] receiving the pattern of the temple
[10:24] he'll agree so pervasive and this day

[20:35] one-column predicate or this man
[20:37] photography is following the Ministry of
[20:41] Allah Jerry profit and the son of man
[20:46] you see that in the Bible wait on a bit
[20:49] he's speaking to the Colossians and when
[20:53] you go
[20:54] I love caboodle Sunday of verse nine he
[20:58] say light not to one another
[21:01] seeing that you have put off the old man
[21:04] with his deeds
[21:06] deep yet he's watching this church this
[21:14] church was supposed to attain unto the
[21:17] heavenly things but this church now they
[21:23] are finding couple of these things in
[21:25] them may not agree to certain decisions
[21:28] and I have put on the new man which is
[21:33] renewed in the knowledge after the image
[21:35] of him that created him
[21:39] kisses or novella Darla connaissance
[21:42] anonymous key to seduce relax al and
[21:45] this man is created after a certain
[21:49] image in its opinion Marge and the other
[21:52] man the old man is also a certain type
[21:57] of deeds many know that the serpent was
[22:01] also in men comments of Colusa potatoes
[22:04] ya know the old serpent with this opened
[22:08] had the lying mouth it came into the
[22:14] Garden of Eden start lying to Eve after
[22:19] lying to Eve brought all the chaos that
[22:23] we have today and started a new
[22:26] civilization Ephesians 4:24 if isn't cut
[22:33] for 24 cut one cut you're going to see
[22:38] Valley Walker that the sermon critical
[22:42] that this preacher is preaching is not
[22:46] reaching that only unto the collusion in
[22:49] predication Coliseum but he's preaching
[22:51] it to the entire to the entire believe
[22:56] body of the believers and that you put
[23:00] on the new man I think we should have it
[23:02] children of a long wish after God is
[23:04] created in righteousness and true
[23:07] holiness there's some sermon it preaches
[23:10] a to the collection aluminum finish
[23:14] Okaloosa it preaches a to the key
[23:17] decision it's all these two churches
[23:20] they call themselves that they've
[23:23] believed the son of man you don't
[23:25] profess the law they believed that the
[23:27] glory of God has been revealed in the
[23:29] last day working like what did you take
[23:31] a village and they were looking unto the
[23:33] appearing of the law amen amen
[23:38] maybe a lot less to consider I'm going
[23:44] to take a title today God's plan for
[23:48] this last God God's plan for this last
[23:50] age
[23:51] I'll only plonk the jacuzzi only ouch
[23:53] and for subject
[23:56] God's new creation under the fo'c'sle
[24:01] because you understand that that any man
[24:06] can come on the pulpit and preach a
[24:10] sermon because they have access to the
[24:13] material because the material the
[24:17] lacunae source has been has been made
[24:19] available to all but to under to come to
[24:23] the understand lip whereof a pompom what
[24:26] is the mystery the Koala mr. hidden in
[24:29] the material it requires a demand the
[24:32] author of the book to come back around
[24:36] pick up the material makes sense because
[24:41] Jesus was such a man he received it from
[24:46] the fan after receiving the word from
[24:49] the fund he went and preached it to the
[24:52] public in a party pushes looping and the
[24:54] public couldn't understand and when he
[24:57] came into the tent with they decided be
[25:00] is now required desire to know what web
[25:05] does things mind and then he explained
[25:09] them to them more clearly understand
[25:13] that when a sermon comes forth on a
[25:16] public level when you go public monthly
[25:18] or on the edge level won't go when you
[25:20] put the lies or the church level
[25:22] delivery not everybody will be able to
[25:25] understand and that's why if you pour
[25:28] quoi sometimes in the Bible you see
[25:31] people would say lives on your home this
[25:33] man also taught is that we have to eat
[25:36] his flesh and drink his blood that was a
[25:40] sermon that sit in protocol only public
[25:42] public more but in the internal place in
[25:48] their heart in the inner veil where the
[25:52] voice does sweet small voice was able to
[25:56] come and reveal and to give the
[26:00] interpretation of the things that the
[26:03] public saying
[26:04] even because you'll notice that on the
[26:08] mountain buzzkill this one time when he
[26:10] came down those questions with this one
[26:12] there II the the cloud of glory came
[26:16] down a linear to Bloody Sunday then
[26:18] there was thundering and those who
[26:22] desired not to be forgot to speak
[26:25] anymore
[26:28] then Moses has to come to take the same
[26:30] things in a wave in the poem and to give
[26:32] it to the people and you understand the
[26:36] company even though that was given to
[26:38] them in the form of tips and books puree
[26:42] and bettan couldn't be abiding in the
[26:46] calling the COO they wanted to raise
[26:49] themselves above the stars of God it is
[26:54] started to withstand the prophet of God
[26:57] and you understand that it is the same
[27:00] pattern that we see in this last day
[27:03] that many people in this nation will
[27:06] also try to do the same thing when God
[27:09] by his own counsel yes establish a
[27:14] prophet
[27:15] some as preachers some as opposed to
[27:19] some as teachers and some with a certain
[27:24] level of a measure of faith to be able
[27:28] to estate to stand as the body of Jesus
[27:31] but you understand that the Prophet
[27:35] tells us so the Prophet that the devil
[27:37] will also bring something and so you can
[27:41] bring him into the house of the house of
[27:44] the Lord is not this building the house
[27:48] of the Lord is the 16 element that you
[27:51] are and in this mystery the devil will
[27:56] bring some people real is on agent to be
[28:03] able to take you it would drift you away
[28:05] from the parent or division gods
[28:08] therefore you understand
[28:11] that this has already happened in the
[28:13] Garden of Eden and what happened in the
[28:16] garden either one has shown up no
[28:20] standing up walking he Marsha and he
[28:24] started targeting in the kingdom of God
[28:27] who can I go to to bring also my new
[28:32] plan you understand that God had a plan
[28:38] but this one here also had his own plan
[28:43] and they wanted to bring it to pass and
[28:47] he looked in the entire kingdom who is
[28:52] the weakest vessel among them to be able
[28:56] to target him or to target her to bring
[29:00] destruction in the car God's plan then
[29:05] you see that's where all the
[29:07] civilization started because men was
[29:11] exposed to reasoning because that our
[29:16] sister didn't remain with the saying of
[29:19] the Lord
[29:21] she had the books and the tape but she
[29:25] couldn't abide by she had the appearance
[29:29] of it but she couldn't live according to
[29:32] the standard of them she started
[29:36] wandering into the land and seeing other
[29:40] things because she was fed up of all the
[29:44] preaching that pasta
[29:45] Adam was able to teach to her and we
[29:49] understand that when a believer comes to
[29:52] deliver and cannot be satisfied with the
[29:56] Lord given by the Prophet and started
[29:59] wandering in the land then we see that
[30:02] the next thing to come is the
[30:04] destruction and we understand also that
[30:08] every time a believer will be able to
[30:12] stand with the word will always be in
[30:15] overcome in all the state the trials all
[30:19] the situation in life
[30:22] then we understand that the Prophet was
[30:25] given unto Eve to be able to understand
[30:29] what kind of Kingdom that we live in
[30:32] they were under the shadow of the
[30:34] Almighty
[30:35] they were living in into the interlocked
[30:38] wings of the cherubim don't expect when
[30:42] she started going out then she found
[30:45] herself under a certain influence oh
[30:48] what a marvelous day we will say oh we
[30:52] come to the church this is another
[30:54] service we come to the this building we
[30:58] believe the message of because when they
[31:03] sit in a pushed her she said surely God
[31:08] said that got to eat this but then the
[31:13] revelation twisting of the word there
[31:17] couldn't follow the pattern of the open
[31:19] book of that base then brought her into
[31:24] a chaos and before she even knew it she
[31:29] thought she thought that if she could
[31:33] bring this revelation unto her pass then
[31:38] the pastor will also become God as it
[31:40] was promised to them unto the next but
[31:44] she didn't understand that what kind of
[31:47] malice was hidden in there because in
[31:52] every age you know shock the Lord of the
[31:55] dig the word of the Lord is brought
[31:57] forth at a point in the time of Moses we
[32:00] see load the load of bringing forth his
[32:02] paranoia luteum a new model bringing the
[32:05] same to Moses the only foreigner
[32:07] reproduce what you have seen in heaven
[32:10] as we've seen on earth as you have seen
[32:12] in on on heaven and Jesus a net that
[32:16] will be done in heaven therefore God
[32:22] will see a union again between Earth and
[32:26] heaven
[32:28] else the days were going back not
[32:31] everybody came to understand
[32:34] that what was God's great purpose to be
[32:38] able to stand a certain profit for the
[32:43] rest of your life and say Amen to every
[32:45] word that proceedeth out of the word of
[32:48] this Gruffalo Musa perfect but then you
[32:52] see no completely nominations that
[32:55] arising just as it happened in the
[32:58] garden started forming new revelation
[33:04] creating friends creating groups the
[33:09] group under the revelation of the
[33:11] process like as I said from Shelly
[33:13] correct and Dayton couldn't sit in there
[33:18] calling couldn't abide in the inner
[33:23] colleagues didn't go by we see that the
[33:27] children of God lives of the sons of God
[33:30] has become wonder with stars not knowing
[33:34] exactly what God has called them unto
[33:37] they wonder into the last year ago they
[33:39] were wandering to the right they don't
[33:41] know what kind of mysteries
[33:44] what can the element God God has given
[33:47] them feel kind of authority that got it
[33:50] given them therefore we see that God is
[33:53] ruies rich in mercy wanted to see is
[33:57] plentiful food regardless he sees the
[34:01] day go by then he understood it was
[34:05] necessary not just to speak about these
[34:08] things in the form of the pillar of fire
[34:10] in the form of the cloud of the glory
[34:13] but he had to come down in a
[34:15] self-defense sure how this thing has to
[34:18] be done it should be a faith Romans
[34:23] chapter 12 our main news I beseech you
[34:26] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[34:30] that you present your bodies a living
[34:33] sacrifice a sacrifice holy acceptable
[34:38] unto God which is your reasonable
[34:41] service
[34:43] and be not conformed to this world but
[34:48] be transformed you understand that these
[34:53] people
[34:54] Mucca Mucca society has fallen from the
[34:57] glory of God God still sends down the
[35:01] Prophet you're what gotta come down in
[35:03] the form of a man who starts showing
[35:06] them the way out all the way back to
[35:09] Eden because remembering the Garden of
[35:12] Eden then try to go back into those
[35:15] other places but God it stopped the way
[35:19] in there for alone he said that the
[35:22] Indus dish that you are in you are not
[35:25] able to go back into that place but
[35:29] there is a time but there is a things
[35:32] that I have to fulfill in order to bring
[35:35] back this great revelation you say be
[35:38] not really but by transformed by the
[35:40] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[35:44] what is there what is that good the
[35:49] parable to the Jew and acceptable and
[35:52] perfect will of God because all my old
[36:01] men the Lord Jesus Christ sees that this
[36:06] is not the place that I have chosen for
[36:08] my son the men started living under a
[36:11] new civilization a civilization of
[36:15] science philosophy they have fallen from
[36:17] civilization of faith and the Lord
[36:20] desires for this to come back around so
[36:24] we understand that this old man has his
[36:28] own deeds but how did this man come
[36:31] about to fulfill this old plan they are
[36:35] complete the devil in right in Isaiah 14
[36:38] is that you cut off the Bible say we can
[36:41] put it up here by the grace of God -
[36:43] Lukas OTC Paula Cassidy 14 14
[36:59] in in in the in in Isaiah the the Bible
[37:03] shows us Israel a bit more that how the
[37:06] devil fell fell from heaven
[37:08] comical diabla it can be UCL and he had
[37:12] a plan Alabama and when he did in this
[37:15] plan of his
[37:16] don't stop law and he wanted to do
[37:18] something you've loved calculus he
[37:22] wanted to lift himself above the stars
[37:24] of God talked to June and when he was
[37:28] doing that then Isaiah 14:13 Fordow and
[37:34] said in thy heart come to this out
[37:36] talker I will ascend into heaven German
[37:39] Terrell's here he sees that this is the
[37:43] placement of the sons of God I will
[37:46] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[37:52] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[37:55] congregation in the sides of the nose I
[38:00] will ascend above the heights of the
[38:03] clouds I will be like the Most High this
[38:09] is what his plan was from the very
[38:11] beginning when you started targeting the
[38:15] people in the church understanding the
[38:18] wit places of every man and he started
[38:23] looking into this place from those
[38:27] weaknesses is going to ascend is going
[38:33] to ascend and the place himself above
[38:36] the stars of God and the Bible says
[38:39] regardless of all that he has done yet
[38:44] he shall yet thou shalt be brought down
[38:47] to helmet to the size of the Peter
[38:51] before the day that CD shallow nearly
[38:56] look upon de Vega is considered a saying
[39:01] is this the man that made the earth to
[39:06] tremble
[39:07] he faced the cumulative and that did
[39:09] shake kingdom
[39:11] this men our longest journey he knew
[39:15] exactly what to do he went out as the
[39:18] first horse rider to overcome and it did
[39:23] overcome regardless of that glory be to
[39:27] God the Prophet sees the flood this
[39:30] God's plan he said that I'll let him do
[39:33] the work for a while but it's after the
[39:35] word is and shall be did the decides of
[39:40] the Peter shall be deep after of the
[39:43] offer of help
[39:44] Oh glory be to God but then we see we
[39:48] want to see a little bit more how does
[39:50] this man is able to bring the stars of
[39:54] God a common elicit what did you and
[39:57] that is feet under is domains under is
[40:01] influence because reading the book of
[40:03] Genesis we only see that he only spoke
[40:07] to him that I'll make a few God and if
[40:11] you eat from this and you'll do this but
[40:14] if the devil ever appears to any one of
[40:16] us here as it did to loser probably
[40:20] everyone will recognize it quickly yes
[40:22] then I cannot that's what he said there
[40:24] but then they chant therefore is not
[40:27] that stupid
[40:28] he knows that some of his truth has been
[40:33] displayed has been brought to reality
[40:35] and if it comes with the same language
[40:38] is going to split this comes with as he
[40:41] is going to be turned down but then it
[40:43] changes the foolish and the Bible in the
[40:46] Book of Daniel shows us that the mystery
[40:49] of this beast was destroying wonderfully
[40:56] to destroy wonderful and when people sit
[41:01] there and they worship the business
[41:04] destroying them wonderful videos more
[41:07] and yet they don't know it that's why
[41:12] the Lord looks at them and say no this
[41:14] year you are blind
[41:17] and naked wretched yet you don't know
[41:22] because this fellow has understood how
[41:26] to process and exactly comment upon
[41:29] three and Daniel looks at that plane say
[41:33] is destroying wonderfully because when
[41:36] Nebuchadnezzar saw the dream because it
[41:40] didn't see how the devil was destroying
[41:42] wonderful a bit on to the dreamers but
[41:46] then when the word of the Prophet came
[41:48] to danger then the prophet a debris had
[41:53] to come to come and explain to him the
[41:57] vision and understanding what are these
[42:02] things
[42:04] Daniel didn't see the fulfillment of he
[42:09] sees it reverse Allah that the things
[42:12] are to come Julie suburbs are complete
[42:14] and if Benny was a process those of his
[42:17] days where the dream and they didn't
[42:21] understand since they didn't understand
[42:24] it Daniel was the first process because
[42:28] they had a war writing of Moses say that
[42:31] if the Prophet gives the dream or gives
[42:34] the testimony or give a prophecy and it
[42:37] doesn't come to pass he's the first
[42:40] prophet but now here we see that the
[42:44] revelation given to Daniel was the
[42:47] revelation that has to last for many
[42:49] days who's a computer and we see a new
[42:55] way by this many every left the words of
[42:59] the prophet Daniel and because of their
[43:03] love the prophet Daniel and their friend
[43:06] himself in the snare of the enemy once
[43:08] again because in the days of Daniel I
[43:11] think that the division was at their
[43:14] dream was given to Nebuchadnezzar God
[43:17] has shown him how the kingdoms of the
[43:21] earth we rise and come to now in Sicily
[43:25] the handlebar but here we find now that
[43:29] it is
[43:30] of the age the time in which they were
[43:33] living in that people came to influence
[43:37] Nebuchadnezzar you are a king wrote you
[43:43] Wow
[43:44] look at this whole King it is your
[43:47] kingdom you can you just allow that boy
[43:51] from captivity that have to come and
[43:53] tell you that this kingdom will pass the
[43:56] way you did you know maybe canister
[44:00] works up the next day and builds a great
[44:04] statue it goes in glanced at you well in
[44:06] the dream I don't know that God has
[44:08] given him let your kingdom is the head
[44:12] of gold select it though but here a
[44:14] significant Easter from snows it builds
[44:18] a statue with the whole body of gold to
[44:23] look to look at such it mo to show
[44:26] Daniel Daniel you are wrong you have
[44:29] charcoal my kingdom will last forever
[44:32] that was you this is the influence under
[44:38] which people live in - they live as if
[44:42] there is there's not tomorrow as if they
[44:45] will live eternally I have my plan my
[44:49] life is not unloaded for 17 years I will
[44:54] do whatever work and then I would live
[44:57] forever and they have a song forever
[45:00] young because the illusion under which
[45:08] they are listening because the great
[45:10] things that they have been able to build
[45:12] it and they were able to build this day
[45:21] and this scene is and they see that
[45:25] there's no way there's no way for us to
[45:29] go to hell in there's no way for us to
[45:32] die we will live forever about people to
[45:35] you and they were forsaken the word of
[45:40] the king of
[45:41] prophet Daniel prophet Daniel and this
[45:44] was happening this is in the 68 week at
[45:49] any time at the end of the captivity in
[45:54] Babylon people were unconscious of God's
[46:01] program the program they were
[46:02] unconscious because whether they were
[46:06] unconscious of the wrath to come back 11
[46:09] years and this is the time in which no
[46:14] can ever canister just enough to raise
[46:18] the statue that everyone had to come and
[46:23] worship of any are doing such the statue
[46:25] this is the time that job was made
[46:29] available to all because to build this
[46:32] great statute required labor in order to
[46:38] build this so to worship the statue we
[46:42] had to have musician's musician in order
[46:46] to him to worship the statue
[46:48] people had to learn how to play the
[46:50] musician upon commercially system oh and
[46:53] people were under the influence of the
[46:57] age but the rough to come luckily was
[47:01] that the door the king of the medians of
[47:04] the world and the presence was at the
[47:07] door teleport me the bells we are living
[47:10] in the day that the third wall
[47:13] collosseum demonium is at the doors and
[47:17] people under the influence that there is
[47:20] no dice there's no death thing about the
[47:23] market you look at the time in which
[47:26] relevant if you remember my sermon the
[47:28] mindset of the restored Church showed
[47:31] you the same parent to show you that the
[47:33] King Cyrus was raised up trying to come
[47:36] in free the people
[47:38] but here the influence of the people was
[47:41] to be blinded to be Richard this one
[47:46] misses to be naked
[47:48] but Daniel the prophet the Gentiles
[47:51] prophet had to come and give them the
[47:54] revelation to put off the old man and to
[47:58] put on the new man the group and to be
[48:00] able to go into the rapture but these
[48:04] people here under the influence they
[48:07] went unto the worship of the be celibate
[48:12] this is the time in which we are time
[48:16] that everybody opens the Bible oh but to
[48:20] find God's Word find God's program to
[48:25] find God's plan for the hour they
[48:30] couldn't find it that's why Daniel into
[48:34] prayer a party-pooper year went into
[48:36] prayer when he understood by the Book of
[48:39] Jeremiah prophet that this was going to
[48:43] happen the end of 7 years when william
[48:47] branham pick up the Bible and understood
[48:50] the time in which you are living in that
[48:52] went bald the Prophet spoken about the
[48:56] coming of the Lord he said that the Lord
[48:58] himself shall descend with a shout with
[49:01] a voice with a trumpet and after this we
[49:06] shall see the falling away and
[49:08] in-betweener
[49:09] in the twinkling of an eye those that
[49:12] are sleeping shall we shall not prevent
[49:15] them all but we shall all be gathered
[49:17] unto the Lord
[49:18] when this revelation is taking place
[49:21] some people are blind in the ODC Bible
[49:27] Paran Pardo Moodle the pattern of the
[49:31] open book everywhere you open it brings
[49:34] up - purpose one goal one purpose that
[49:39] God has was head in the back part of his
[49:42] mind to bring it down in the form of
[49:46] Jesus Christ as the sacrificing lamb and
[49:49] then to bring it in the form of his
[49:52] bride in this lesson in Ephesus in

[50:23] demonstration for the amount of starts
[50:26] figures out of everywhere you bring it
[50:30] out it has to bring the gas fire
[50:34] the pattern of European book look at the
[50:37] deliverable people were under illusion
[50:41] they didn't know what to go to the
[50:44] attraction of Babylon so great because
[50:48] Babylon was the figuratively

[58:28] fallen and one is and the other is not
[58:34] he is not yet is not yet come and when
[58:38] yet it cometh it shall continue for a
[58:42] short period
[58:45] you see that God is revealing the plan
[58:49] of this enemy how is going to fulfill
[58:52] this great mystery else the days go by
[58:56] we receive now under the revelation of
[58:58] the prophet to be able to give us the
[59:01] understanding how did these kings how

[1:01:53] Eddie Hall Ellis Ellis that great city
[1:01:58] Babylon that mighty City for in one hour
[1:02:04] is thy judgment come because the
[1:02:10] Nebuchadnezzar roster and looked at the
[1:02:14] great city that he had built
[1:02:18] God and given him all the nations on the
[1:02:24] prophet Daniel was under because when
[1:02:29] Daniel came in there in the age of 12 he
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:33] transformed the understanding of nul of
[1:02:35] Daniel teaching him the language of the
[1:02:39] Chaldeans and everybody else's that came
[1:02:44] out of the Israel into Babylon was then
[1:02:49] transformed into the image of the Beast
[1:02:52] a Muslim but then glory be together
[1:02:54] let's go that these peoples were under
[1:02:59] this Israel dad is protected goddess a
[1:03:03] desire that these people who picture all
[1:03:07] and in a certain time to come back to
[1:03:11] where they were supposed to be but then
[1:03:13] look at how is that destroying
[1:03:15] wonderfully and the merchants of the
[1:03:19] earth shall weep and mourn over her
[1:03:21] solitary oh it's all there cause death
[1:03:25] for no man buyeth their merchandise
[1:03:27] anymore personal the merchandise of gold
[1:03:33] regardez on door and silver and precious
[1:03:36] stones and of pearls and fine linen and
[1:03:39] purple poo and skilled and scarlet and
[1:03:44] all thyine wood and all manner of vessel
[1:03:49] of every an old men of vessels of most
[1:03:52] precious wood of brass and iron and
[1:03:57] marble and cinnamon and odours and
[1:04:02] anointment of and frankincense and wine
[1:04:04] of an oil and fine flour and wheat and
[1:04:10] beasts and sheep and horses and chariots
[1:04:14] and slaves and souls of men
[1:04:18] everything this King has it so voila
[1:04:22] Nebuchadnezzar has it under his control
[1:04:24] because a servant who is going to escape
[1:04:27] from him
[1:04:29] that's the opinion a beacon itself you
[1:04:33] want to invest you have to mid
[1:04:35] Nebuchadnezzar only because it's you
[1:04:39] want to prosper you have to me and the
[1:04:45] fruit bed that that I so lasted after
[1:04:47] and departed from D a little and all
[1:04:52] things which we're dandy and godly and
[1:04:55] departed from D a total shows a delicate
[1:04:58] a magnifique saw mouse on SSO and thou
[1:05:01] shalt find them no more the merchants of
[1:05:06] these things which were made rich by her
[1:05:10] shall stand afar off for the fear of the
[1:05:14] tournament weeping and wailing are these
[1:05:19] people who we also brought under dis
[1:05:22] Israel to become the people who came to
[1:05:26] understand this then look at this grid
[1:05:29] family we taught that is the final word
[1:05:35] this is the final place that this is the
[1:05:39] resting place now we can sit and look at
[1:05:41] Babylon it is fallen it is but how are
[1:05:47] you I'd be are they going to be able to
[1:05:51] see that so even kumazawa suta but then
[1:05:56] we see the world today being built after
[1:05:59] the manner because Babylon transferred
[1:06:05] his knowledge to the Egyptians and the
[1:06:08] Egyptians transferred it to the Greeks
[1:06:11] and the Greeks transferred it to the
[1:06:14] Romans and the Romans to the entire
[1:06:17] world but how are they able to do that
[1:06:21] with Apple specific about the first
[1:06:23] Allah this is where Daniel comes in this
[1:06:28] is where you have to help Daniel to show
[1:06:30] you the button the mark of the serpent
[1:06:33] of the stone the Masuda supposed to
[1:06:35] negotiate because without knowing the
[1:06:39] trail of the serpent onerous
[1:06:42] Cornette from the palace but i suppose
[1:06:43] you'll be caught in the snare it will
[1:06:46] look so nice
[1:06:49] don't you see the fruit was good to eat
[1:06:54] and when it appeared it is a normal
[1:07:01] thing any man that has is cautious
[1:07:04] Acacio has to do so because if you don't
[1:07:07] do so you'll never be able to make it
[1:07:10] you want children the devil tells you
[1:07:13] this is the way to have you can be a
[1:07:18] similar need to get married just do it
[1:07:21] this way today we have science that
[1:07:28] takes at the sperm people spell they
[1:07:30] putted the frizzy they take the egg they
[1:07:37] freeze it now your children are safe go
[1:07:44] get yourself a career look curry as you
[1:07:48] get yourself a career live however you

[1:07:58] we will take that egg and add the sperm
[1:08:01] and put it in the serger surrogate and
[1:08:05] from that from that surrogate then

[1:08:09] your children will ask you how was the
[1:08:12] how did it happen when you we were born
[1:08:14] the common school some name and if they

[1:08:25] that you were the parent to Chile pero
[1:08:27] destroying wonderful yet with memories
[1:08:30] of destroying wonderful piece of memory
[1:08:36] is beyond human reasoning the logic of a
[1:08:39] human the things that is could never
[1:08:42] think about how was the mo to destroy
[1:08:49] because he had in his heart pastilla
[1:08:51] built to create a more beautiful evening
[1:08:54] than than Michaels the clay and he
[1:09:00] wanted to build a world that everybody
[1:09:03] can leave our heaven the world but not

[1:09:54] destroying wonderful leader never use
[1:09:57] them all
[1:09:58] and how is he able to do Daniel tells us
[1:10:04] that this task in the face of what the
[1:10:08] beacon Esther the work was given to the
[1:10:12] priest and this breeze they had to teach
[1:10:18] us to the people and these people in the
[1:10:23] turn had to give it to the other nations
[1:10:26] that William Branham says that the
[1:10:29] influencer offered the subduer big him
[1:10:33] the influence of the subdued silicon him
[1:10:40] yet when the Romans comes into your land
[1:10:45] lost can you imagine over there they
[1:10:47] start by building schools seacoast about
[1:10:49] considers a call from this schools they
[1:10:54] tell you like you know you guys are not
[1:10:56] civilized
[1:10:58] we will give you new civilization and
[1:11:04] this civilization was not to bring the
[1:11:08] entire world and is inference because
[1:11:12] those who'd knows name were not in the
[1:11:14] book of the left-hand now to worship the
[1:11:17] Beast had to wonder had to look at him
[1:11:21] and appreciate the world that he was
[1:11:23] able to do they will have to appreciate
[1:11:25] how look at this man this being was born
[1:11:30] a man now is a female we could see it in
[1:11:35] the videos of you personally video but

[1:12:07] these men are protected by the kings of
[1:12:11] the earth with their armies avec la me
[1:12:14] and these people and now are destroying
[1:12:18] wonderfully and they had a product of
[1:12:21] the greatest school in the land covered
[1:12:24] hopes for Oxford and forever every month
[1:12:29] and many more episode of the call and
[1:12:32] this which is the result that the people
[1:12:35] now who cannot afford in this school
[1:12:38] they give them a lesser level of classes
[1:12:42] so the task is so laid-back about Sutra
[1:12:45] but in these classes they tell them
[1:12:48] though you cannot attain those high but
[1:12:52] we can give you the knowledge for
[1:12:55] YouTube within YouTube through Instagram

[1:13:19] destroying wonderful memory as a mom but
[1:13:25] these are things that are taking place
[1:13:27] in the world but we are not just to talk
[1:13:32] about them but the devil has a people
[1:13:36] that is a targeting and these people is
[1:13:40] you because if purpose was not been
[1:13:44] people because they were not in the
[1:13:47] books number of life to begin with but
[1:13:49] he was targeting the sons the dolls of
[1:13:52] God and how is he able not to reach out
[1:13:58] to them no communicability hotel but it
[1:14:01] places a system around the internet in
[1:14:05] Internet era inch or less attractive you
[1:14:07] couldn't buy to be positive in the duct
[1:14:10] edges you couldn't sell if you were not
[1:14:13] particular must purchase of that system
[1:14:17] they know that these people they will
[1:14:22] only listen to the words of the but man
[1:14:26] but you know how am I going to attack
[1:14:29] that I achieve them how am I going to
[1:14:31] get the squeeze the life the Lavi deep
[1:14:38] make life harder on them go back in the
[1:14:42] book of Exodus the lord of the work was
[1:14:48] multiplied on them then they had to
[1:14:53] start working more hours though they
[1:14:57] work overtime the check is not still not

[1:15:03] jobs still not enough destroying
[1:15:09] wonderful industries of Mario's mom the

[1:15:27] knows that God is the way of to be
[1:15:31] worshipped there is a provided way of
[1:15:34] everything for God but then if you don't
[1:15:38] get this way of God automatically to God
[1:15:41] you are worshiping the devil because to
[1:15:44] worship God outside of his promise you
[1:15:49] are worshipping the devil and it gives
[1:15:51] them a system around them we's the life
[1:15:56] ellaby wonderfully destroying member use

[1:23:22] know it this is the world in which we
[1:23:28] are living this is the time we are
[1:23:31] living
[1:23:32] one man's practice to be lifted up above
[1:23:40] the stars of God but here you see the
[1:23:44] realities in which we are living in that
[1:23:47] the fulfillment of it and the reading of
[1:23:51] it in the
[1:23:52] two different things you can read about
[1:23:57] it you can become a Greek brother pepper
[1:24:03] on say the tribulation falling away but

[1:24:53] the churches today are no more in the
[1:24:58] way the worship then in the way to with
[1:25:01] this proof you can see in the churches
[1:25:07] there's more time to music to worship

[1:26:00] attending the prisoners of God all is
[1:26:02] gone as the pyramid is going forward
[1:26:08] many are falling away but are they
[1:26:12] falling away this is the way they are
[1:26:14] falling away before you know it I need
[1:26:20] to make a confession I need to repent
[1:26:23] old pray for me here
[1:26:25] I wonder who was praying with Jacob in
[1:26:29] the in the in the in the in the in the
[1:26:31] den Jacobo

[1:26:37] launch who pray with him yep we have
[1:26:39] agree when I pray for me pray for me but
[1:26:44] a reasonable one how well does falling
[1:26:50] constitute to me how have you reached to
[1:26:53] that level escucha Havasu Nivola
[1:26:55] but you didn't see mechina that creeping
[1:26:58] spirit in you to successful occasion

[1:27:18] you the spirit of truth to them under
[1:27:28] the illusion under the wine of the
[1:27:31] prostitute full of regular procedure
[1:27:33] they left the proof at the revelation in
[1:27:36] 1965 since they left it in 1965 look at
[1:27:44] the result yet they can have the
[1:27:49] appearance demons with ties on the
[1:27:54] pulpit preaching the word the devil has
[1:27:59] ministering augury in those days men
[1:28:03] shall come to Jesus a workers of work
[1:28:15] they have the knowledge of the world but
[1:28:17] they don't have the revelation of the
[1:28:19] world and the devil is transforming them
[1:28:26] or deforming them will collective form
[1:28:29] from what they were supposed but the
[1:28:34] Lord says that that demon will end up in
[1:28:38] the beat is it going to be alone William
[1:28:43] Branham say no he will do everything
[1:28:46] that he can to take with him as many as

[1:29:04] die alone I have the a little fever we
[1:29:13] could have stay in under the so high the
[1:29:18] devil is added that the procedure is
[1:29:20] going to die beste the Catholic Church
[1:29:23] this isn't going to be here okay yes but
[1:29:28] you have to eat here you have to see how
[1:29:33] is it doing how are they able to stay
[1:29:37] under the worship of the Lord are they
[1:29:40] able to stay under the influence of the
[1:29:43] word they cannot know one that the
[1:29:47] because you look about the mouth no
[1:29:49] wonder the ways of God do doing no
[1:29:52] wonder the dressings right when they are
[1:29:54] among the believers they have a certain
[1:29:57] style of dressing
[1:29:57] once they find themself out there
[1:30:00] quickly peel them off it's like taking a
[1:30:04] su compañía a piece of meat you put in
[1:30:08] the microwave as long as the microwave
[1:30:10] is hot it's hot
[1:30:15] you take it out you put it outside and
[1:30:17] it's winter all the heat is gone by the
[1:30:22] time they hear going so you see they can
[1:30:24] say I'm not talking to you
[1:30:27] to those on a minute your parcel
[1:30:29] internet well they're here
[1:30:33] I mean once they step out doctor salt
[1:30:39] they can recall 18 The Cedars fallen on
[1:30:44] the land and the birds of the earth has
[1:30:48] come and picked up and left they can
[1:30:53] retain the world since they can retain
[1:30:56] the word then the devil will come and
[1:30:58] beauty but look they're unable to retain
[1:31:03] the word but they are able to have
[1:31:05] degrees and masters and what is that
[1:31:08] what else PhD and all kind of things
[1:31:18] hallelujah we go into heaven who pathos
[1:31:20] that heaven will be this way you won't
[1:31:26] be influenced come from beneath uniform
[1:31:30] above 500 because you are successful you
[1:31:34] can tell that by yourself
[1:31:36] 47 I'm able to play the music but I'm
[1:31:40] unable period that brings me to play the
[1:31:45] music
[1:31:46] I'm able to speak about everything in
[1:31:50] the world but when it comes to the Word
[1:31:53] of God
[1:31:53] I do reading that at all you know you
[1:31:57] are B we should also say lately this
[1:32:04] prostitute is bewitching the entire
[1:32:07] world because the devil s ministering
[1:32:11] spirit the first prophet the false
[1:32:16] teachers
[1:32:16] shall rise bringing perverse doctrine
[1:32:20] and people don't like when you come you
[1:32:25] start telling them in the face look at
[1:32:27] your life look at this look then when
[1:32:34] they wilt ask them you thought I was
[1:32:37] making you trouble but people say
[1:32:38] commercial
[1:32:39] the problem we're unit we know awesome
[1:32:45] yet full of quotations in their mouth
[1:32:48] just like the father in the Garden of
[1:32:50] Eden he was able to bring a lot of
[1:32:52] quotations to stand on the pulpit with
[1:32:56] the message today it's not a problem as
[1:32:59] long as they know that they can project
[1:33:02] it relevancy brother branham's brother
[1:33:06] Brown say alleluia alleluia the Technos
[1:33:09] but are they able even to take notes
[1:33:11] with this kind of preaching they can't
[1:33:16] they don't even know where to start what
[1:33:19] are they going to write but it requires
[1:33:25] the revelation to show you that this is
[1:33:29] the place I'm standing wrong this is the
[1:33:31] things that I have to watch this is why
[1:33:33] I have to write but this I have to learn
[1:33:34] how to fight because with the things
[1:33:40] that are coming out and even to learn
[1:33:43] how to fight through the combat because
[1:33:46] Paul said activity give yourself to
[1:33:49] reading exhortation and exhort us you be
[1:33:52] a part of our good work so I am who
[1:33:55] determines how are they going to be a
[1:33:57] pattern of good work if they don't know
[1:33:59] what the pattern of good will see before
[1:34:05] you know it his hatred in the church is
[1:34:08] the clannish in the church it's all kind
[1:34:10] of behavior in the church there's all
[1:34:12] kind of no sense in the church
[1:34:14] destroying this wonderfully as he is
[1:34:20] destroying day after day you know
[1:34:23] presume how long did it take commas
[1:34:25] 6,000 years to bring forth this whole
[1:34:29] kingdom and how is it going how is the
[1:34:34] person under that influence of the devil
[1:34:38] yeah there's no faith there's no virtue
[1:34:41] but there's no knowledge there's no
[1:34:43] temporary there's no patience there's no
[1:34:45] catalyst does the brother kindness
[1:34:47] there's no headstone
[1:34:50] and yet we're going to direct you see he
[1:35:00] has no need to read the quotation
[1:35:03] explain those things those places to
[1:35:06] bring forth the plan that the devil is
[1:35:10] using to bring down the Church of God
[1:35:15] because the spirit of the process unless
[1:35:18] any prophet is not a spirit of man it is
[1:35:22] the spirit that can discern the deepness
[1:35:24] of God we are gonna say I will go and
[1:35:29] show you what God had in the back pocket
[1:35:33] of his my eyes a is showing us what was
[1:35:40] in the heart of the devil Ezekiel told
[1:35:44] him that you think that you are wiser
[1:35:48] than that Daniel Ezekiel chapter 8 I
[1:35:54] believe is a bit weak
[1:35:57] I said pray for me I don't wanna be long
[1:36:08] ezekiel 28:2 to seven twenty eight to
[1:36:15] seven
[1:36:17] son of man say unto the Prince of Tyrus
[1:36:22] okay OpenCV just said the Lord is
[1:36:28] eternal because thine heart is lifted up
[1:36:32] don't covet elevate and Dallas said hid
[1:36:35] I am a God to just redo what is God
[1:36:39] means just over the object of adoration
[1:36:41] and observe a song of worship that he
[1:36:44] must have people to worship him over the
[1:36:47] circular door I sit in the City of God
[1:36:51] this relationship with the place where
[1:36:54] God was supposed to be no don't they
[1:36:57] have lost the first love
[1:36:59] because they have lost the first love
[1:37:02] somebody else's to pick either it is day
[1:37:06] or it is nice in the midst of the Seas
[1:37:14] in the midst of the sea or send Emir
[1:37:17] this is the man in revelation tells us
[1:37:20] if the Massachusetts the people yet
[1:37:25] Dharmendra no and not God
[1:37:28] though there sit down heart as the heart
[1:37:32] of God
[1:37:33] a temple of Allah to the Jews behold was
[1:37:36] he
[1:37:37] dah dah out wiser than Daniel this is
[1:37:43] where this man is the prophet of the age
[1:37:51] burnham you don't know you just can see
[1:37:56] it in the reaction of the preach them
[1:37:59] one thing when a person shows brother
[1:38:01] got himself knows in other words
[1:38:04] whatever that the past is fresh possibly
[1:38:07] possible and you know what he likes to
[1:38:09] push with you
[1:38:13] what are they say we are wiser than
[1:38:16] Daniel what is their knowing things of
[1:38:20] the Father
[1:38:22] there is no secret that they can hide
[1:38:24] from the India by the second composter
[1:38:26] cashier the devil knows how to get all
[1:38:29] of us come on with a minutos out of 80%
[1:38:33] or 90% of us here I can say it's the
[1:38:37] work of the devil that's why we here
[1:38:39] will cover the diabolo can you show me
[1:38:41] see application can understand my
[1:38:43] language component on that 80 to 90
[1:38:48] percent of us here in other word in this
[1:38:51] land to be a little bit more clear
[1:38:53] televisi won't gossip a easy for you
[1:38:57] because if we were left in the land
[1:39:00] where where before they still to worship
[1:39:05] God we will be doing service every day
[1:39:09] we wouldn't even need cars we were
[1:39:12] working Lido's every day cool as you we
[1:39:17] were going we will present but then they
[1:39:21] become a star understood that these
[1:39:24] vessels of God I have to take them into
[1:39:26] Babylon when I take them there
[1:39:29] then I will wonderfully destroy them
[1:39:32] I will wonderfully deformed and look at
[1:39:38] us here show me see we say wisdom and we
[1:39:49] stain understanding though is getting
[1:39:52] dear itches and has gotten gold and
[1:39:56] silver into decoration Hur the law this
[1:40:01] gold here
[1:40:02] this silver here they didn't they didn't
[1:40:06] get it when they were down there in the
[1:40:09] other land because the other land it's
[1:40:15] only the politicians then you can leave
[1:40:18] the rest of us there's no middle class
[1:40:21] here now they stuff fighting to be in
[1:40:23] the middle class ready let's build let's
[1:40:30] see this destroyed they three wonderful
[1:40:35] that we saw never use them all because
[1:40:39] now all the riches did that they have
[1:40:41] gotten now they are able to face and to
[1:40:46] talk in the parallel because of money
[1:40:50] that's what I told one I like to hear
[1:40:53] first I put it above when you don't have
[1:40:55] it you don't you know but when you do
[1:40:58] and you start to talk when you have it
[1:41:01] don't you then I know one of the
[1:41:03] procedure Louisville opposition because
[1:41:06] bitter under a certain anointing he was
[1:41:10] able to stand to say that men
[1:41:14] that these people are not drunk and look
[1:41:18] at what proceedeth out of the mouth and
[1:41:20] look at now this year the wine in the
[1:41:23] pocket the wine in the pocket middle of
[1:41:29] building up gosh but up I make my choice
[1:41:33] wha-whatever want to do I do it nobody
[1:41:37] else to tell me nothing what this is
[1:41:39] wrong if you don't want I'll start
[1:41:42] listening to the tip at homes destroyed
[1:41:47] wonderfully slowly but surely is that
[1:41:52] listening to the tapes and now a 50
[1:41:55] minute the lamb which is also a struggle
[1:42:01] and as the day goes by accomplishing our
[1:42:06] goals let's find it doe tips that heads
[1:42:10] at the language that I can understand as
[1:42:15] the days go by
[1:42:16] I'll stop streaming now Bob Lucas when I
[1:42:19] put the online at connect II after the
[1:42:21] days go by these preachers also they
[1:42:25] don't repeat when the messengers say is
[1:42:28] being destroyed wonderfully police aid
[1:42:35] forsaking the assembling of yourself or
[1:42:44] as the days go by the devil is
[1:42:48] destroying them good job below the tree
[1:42:51] and you see them and the church becomes
[1:43:05] the resting place won't you put on me
[1:43:08] like Jesus Jesus is born in the barnyard
[1:43:12] and now they typify the church with the
[1:43:16] banya how much they can sleep and I said
[1:43:20] that the angel would bring me
[1:43:24] it is a taking place right in your face
[1:43:29] sometimes one of the preacher said see
[1:43:33] him sleeping so clapping give him a good
[1:43:36] clap and see what is going to do in the
[1:43:39] church but then you see that the poor
[1:43:43] brother or the poorest is the if they do
[1:43:45] that the trouble will be gonna begin
[1:43:47] outside here they are born with chain of
[1:43:50] circumstances solution it's a constant
[1:43:53] ratio faith is a good interpreter right
[1:43:58] you can clarify certain language because
[1:44:03] sometimes you just speak and you don't
[1:44:05] use wood it's just coming out but some
[1:44:08] people can also understand and it's
[1:44:11] become the angel of the loads of some
[1:44:13] time therefore that's said the Lord or
[1:44:21] God the Lord God because thou has said
[1:44:24] Dinah hot as the heart of God behold
[1:44:29] therefore I will bring strangers upon
[1:44:32] thee the terrible of the rear of the
[1:44:35] nation and they shall draw the sword
[1:44:39] against the beauty of the whistle it
[1:44:43] conquers and they shall defile die break
[1:44:49] you can see from what has come out all
[1:44:53] that these people are that ever brought
[1:44:57] in the life imaginations all the
[1:45:00] ambitions they have they can now look
[1:45:03] understand that this is going to notice
[1:45:06] in AHIMA all the schooling all this all
[1:45:12] that they have been able to do look at
[1:45:14] what that is but the Lord says God's
[1:45:20] plan for this last God's new creation
[1:45:27] Bellator future under the for sale
[1:45:33] because under the fo'c'sle we see that
[1:45:36] there was a voice the world 11 who are
[1:45:39] of the ego the letter and the Eagle is
[1:45:42] the profit in a blender Zulu perfect and
[1:45:45] the voice of the process a loved one you
[1:45:47] prefer comes and said come and see and
[1:45:51] i'll show you the mystery atomic column
[1:45:54] instead of this beast you have seen the
[1:45:59] mystery of the first of the first hour
[1:46:03] of the first cell second cill say the
[1:46:06] third cell but on the fulfill this beast
[1:46:10] is gathering all this power from the top
[1:46:14] we saw economic power political power
[1:46:18] religious power in order to destroy in
[1:46:22] order to overcome in order to bruise the
[1:46:26] tree to death we everything that was
[1:46:30] coming in this way but glory be to God
[1:46:33] but in these days is entered in that day
[1:46:36] essentially annoying thing of man was
[1:46:39] able to be too afraid this coming
[1:46:42] hardness rider required the Eagles
[1:46:47] anointing in anointing I can fly a
[1:46:50] little higher higher than the men can
[1:46:53] touch in order to explain these things
[1:46:56] the way it's been explained without the
[1:47:01] revelations the anointing of the ego
[1:47:04] then these people itself bound to
[1:47:08] destruction because the fruit is so
[1:47:12] beautiful the world is so beautiful mood
[1:47:14] the opportunities are so and we wanted
[1:47:18] so sooner so close and we wanted right

[1:54:57] years they will see day and look at you
[1:55:00] bridge whatever you want the fridge they
[1:55:03] will tell you you have no experience of
[1:55:05] life we know better look on you Sonja
[1:55:10] yes because fascicle the devil not young
[1:55:15] has experience 6,000 years and when you
[1:55:20] announced you it gives you all the
[1:55:23] necessary for you to read and to discern
[1:55:28] the spirit of the pastor of the preacher
[1:55:31] and all that so every time that you look
[1:55:33] at the pressure on the brain your your
[1:55:36] mind sick always looks at him according
[1:55:40] to what you've learned in school if you
[1:55:44] don't look at them according to the
[1:55:47] world when they say the pattern of the
[1:55:50] open book uber
[1:55:55] because the man the kingdom know why you
[1:55:58] in them it's babylon babylon all these
[1:56:05] life you see even the reaction
[1:56:09] you you just awesome be merciful that's
[1:56:13] the only thing you can do because you
[1:56:15] can only recognize them because by the
[1:56:18] window you can recognize it did good you
[1:56:21] did good there is it good yeah
[1:56:24] how Babel is the Son of God that's the
[1:56:25] only thing that you can do super dear we
[1:56:30] have to believe you so beautiful -
[1:56:31] welcome sir
[1:56:32] did you a a son of God - wait don't of
[1:56:34] God but they Kingdom in you may not know
[1:56:37] why Amon Fool has to be destroyed
[1:56:39] - I could be tree but how are you going
[1:56:42] to destroy how is it going to be
[1:56:45] transformed the Bible says but the
[1:56:49] renewing of your mind without the
[1:56:57] renewing of your mind there is no chance
[1:57:00] for you for you to get anywhere that's
[1:57:05] right if we do with the deserter
[1:57:07] my title is God's new creation under the
[1:57:12] FAFSA you look under the message of the
[1:57:15] prophets this is where the only place
[1:57:17] that can change you and if the message

[1:57:46] system introduce another system it's not
[1:57:50] easy it's not easy you have a man like

[1:58:00] consequences across the cross to be
[1:58:03] discussed into the dance like the lion's
[1:58:06] den because of the accessibility caused

[2:18:07] simple as that Oh oh brother you see oh
[2:18:12] brother you know no that's not my
[2:18:14] problem
[2:18:14] a possible problem debate as much as one
[2:18:17] become a Greek as you want living in the
[2:18:20] word with CD you can convince the
[2:18:23] preacher pastor pastor just for two
[2:18:26] months dumar supermoon
[2:18:27] you know how much distraction you'll get
[2:18:29] in that two months I might should be
[2:18:34] destroying too much the community under
[2:18:36] more when you run from the church just
[2:18:38] think on the things that you do but
[2:18:44] anyway but God now is standing here is
[2:18:47] showing us that this bread creation that
[2:18:50] this great creation herbs happens under
[2:18:53] the four silk the voice of the Eagles
[2:18:55] process and this prophet does not prefer
[2:19:00] now is showing this mystery and to show
[2:19:03] us that along this time that the Lord to
[2:19:09] loosen himself knew that how these
[2:19:11] things were going to message place and
[2:19:13] how they revelation is necessary in
[2:19:19] order to bring back the children to the
[2:19:22] place that we suppose because only you
[2:19:26] know you're poor your schedule are well
[2:19:30] from this time to this time when I get
[2:19:32] to this
[2:19:33] I get tired fatigued I guess I can pray
[2:19:36] the Holy Spirit in you will have to
[2:19:40] teach you don't take that job don't go
[2:19:45] into that go into this years and go
[2:19:48] don't go there
[2:19:49] the preacher doesn't have to come and
[2:19:51] tell you that the preacher doesn't have
[2:19:54] to be a publisher because here we have
[2:19:58] young and old and everybody and who is
[2:20:03] the preacher going to talk to to the
[2:20:05] smallest detail all they hold this oh
[2:20:10] they did the smallest the middle one but
[2:20:15] the word comes out this thing's
[2:20:16] delicious as you know I've went far from
[2:20:19] here that's why I've said but then the
[2:20:26] way but is not the preacher tells you go
[2:20:29] back to the message a power massage go
[2:20:32] back to the mr. Daniel understood that
[2:20:35] 70 years was enough see we cannot stay
[2:20:40] on the Babylon because he understood by
[2:20:45] the book of the Prophet their house
[2:20:47] Prophet Jeremiah
[2:20:48] at the time the church has spent in the
[2:20:50] world is limited to this and by
[2:20:53] revelation you have to know mahalo you
[2:20:56] will stay in the scene and from there
[2:21:01] years to show you their way back home
[2:21:05] the mindset of the restored Church
[2:21:09] considered Elizabeth to be how they had
[2:21:12] to come back home instability hadn't
[2:21:14] recognized the way you look on and how
[2:21:16] they had to stand as one
[2:21:29] I'm trying to get to disco tation
[2:21:32] quickly and then we'll close me if I
[2:21:36] don't get to the quotation we'll stay
[2:21:38] longer you keep praying for me right the
[2:21:47] grace of God I'm watching the time I'm
[2:21:49] trying really my best because when you
[2:21:55] don't do when you don't go to rotation
[2:21:57] after quotation the Spirit takes over
[2:21:59] you can control it and it's controlling
[2:22:01] you and the time goes and people get
[2:22:04] tired and but hold on hold on fast hold
[2:22:10] fast by the grace of God we'll get there
[2:22:13] like like like the forefathers of
[2:22:16] America when the when they were selling
[2:22:20] on the Seas like you know I want one
[2:22:22] more push one more push will get there

[2:22:56] and that's what all these are programs
[2:22:59] of religion they are still sons and
[2:23:03] daughters of God but it's being deformed
[2:23:06] mr. DiPalma is Sunday for me you see
[2:23:09] just as I showed you all this scheme of
[2:23:14] the devil one is done - but they're
[2:23:17] still sons and daughters of God the go
[2:23:20] to church wanting to do right that's
[2:23:24] what everybody hears you a nun never
[2:23:27] enters in a nunnery to be a mean woman
[2:23:34] to be a mean woman a minister NEFCO
[2:23:40] never goes through school just to be a
[2:23:43] bad man no empathy catanduva poly column
[2:23:45] input even irremovable you never join
[2:23:47] church and shake hands put your name on
[2:23:50] the book or wherever you do in your
[2:23:52] church to be a bad person when you do
[2:23:59] that be a good person that's why
[2:24:03] everybody's here to the moon that they
[2:24:04] see you want a big closer to God listen
[2:24:08] to what the prophets but man it's the
[2:24:10] deception say like deception

[2:24:24] you hear this topic over the courtesy
[2:24:26] system system or Jezebel or Italia takes
[2:24:31] hold of you swipe all these things out
[2:24:38] all the in oldest the sweat and the
[2:24:40] voice and the shouting the profit of
[2:24:43] their preachers doing in five minutes
[2:24:45] and we need some oh forget about this
[2:24:47] thing he doesn't know where we've heard
[2:24:51] preachers
[2:24:52] breaches strikes on fire
[2:24:55] did you see any image did you see
[2:24:58] anybody jumping when God was creating
[2:25:03] there was no jumping in the shop I did
[2:25:07] so it was quiet he just spoke the word
[2:25:10] waited and it was and it was good it's a
[2:25:16] promoting keep keep moving keep moving
[2:25:18] no matter coach Enya was the coaching
[2:25:19] about say Oh God
[2:25:23] if the deformity that does it for my
[2:25:26] sake first sentence prayed it satola
[2:25:28] like me could we see God never had an
[2:25:32] organization there's no such a thing
[2:25:35] anywhere found that in the words of God
[2:25:38] it will only power that you found in the
[2:25:41] Word of God
[2:25:44] dision to church but now he's standing
[2:25:48] in the midst of the church as it stands
[2:25:51] they're revealing who is in the last he
[2:25:56] calls himself the altar of the creation
[2:26:01] of God this is my new creation this is
[2:26:05] another creation this has to do with the
[2:26:08] church this is a special designation of
[2:26:12] himself is the creator of that church in
[2:26:19] other for another word when you see the
[2:26:22] Prophet just go by the prophet standing
[2:26:24] on the pulpit or knowledge share it's
[2:26:26] God said you talking to you just when
[2:26:28] you go pal you
[2:26:35] see another distraction day that's how
[2:26:39] he's destroying wonderfully comes lucky
[2:26:41] to me obvious mom was so tired he forgot
[2:26:43] to turn off his phone the heavenly
[2:26:53] bridegroom created is on bride as the
[2:26:59] Spirit of God it came down and created
[2:27:02] in the Virgin Mary the cell from which
[2:27:06] his body was born call it a name I want
[2:27:10] to repeat that you created the very
[2:27:13] cells in the womb of Mary for that body
[2:27:20] it was not enough for the Holy Spirit
[2:27:23] simply to give life to human human of
[2:27:26] them supply supplied by Mary system a
[2:27:29] simple sentence with the denilla V
[2:27:30] acceptors it shows the nipple for the
[2:27:32] polymer
[2:27:35] that would have been a sinful mankind
[2:27:38] producing a body that would that would
[2:27:44] not have produced the less atoms of him
[2:27:48] it was said lo a body thou done as thou
[2:27:54] father prepare to meet God not Mary God
[2:28:00] not the church God not the preacher God
[2:28:05] you're not the Prophet God not the
[2:28:09] system of the world he is creating this
[2:28:12] new body provided the body Mary was the
[2:28:17] human inhibitor and she carried the holy
[2:28:21] child and brought him to birth listen to
[2:28:25] this it was God he was a god man look at
[2:28:33] how in this creation is going to take
[2:28:35] place he was the son of God he was a new
[2:28:40] creation
[2:28:42] men and God love it you met and joined
[2:28:48] it was the first of his new races this
[2:28:55] other race this old man had to drop off
[2:28:59] a bet obey but there's from Mary Mary
[2:29:03] could not supply those things the church
[2:29:06] could not supply the material but then
[2:29:10] it requires God himself to come down in
[2:29:13] a woman and produce that in other word
[2:29:17] that has to come into a church and
[2:29:20] produce this other bride the heavenly
[2:29:23] bridegroom producing X bride unto
[2:29:27] himself
[2:29:28] remember we did help so because in the
[2:29:32] dream when God said that Nebuchadnezzar
[2:29:36] your kingdom will last so long when I
[2:29:38] say the prostitution sleeping in the
[2:29:42] church not paying the tight all these
[2:29:45] things discussions and all kind of
[2:29:48] nonsense
[2:29:49] God said you will can last only so long
[2:29:53] she sat down and when it begins the new
[2:29:58] creation of Commerce and wealth it is
[2:30:00] not a help of any hand because this
[2:30:03] stone came down without the help of any
[2:30:06] hand and in Mary oh my god has started
[2:30:09] you're showing that first in my church
[2:30:12] look what I'm able to do come up in this
[2:30:16] woman door such virgin woman without any
[2:30:19] touch of us to see I know just say
[2:30:22] brother Joseph suffice yourself will be
[2:30:24] confused
[2:30:25] there are consumed Mary these
[2:30:29] revelations
[2:30:32] even we just came from church
[2:30:35] now you start telling me let you Isaiah
[2:30:39] 7:14 it said cattle said cut off just so
[2:30:43] comes up and in every way she does not
[2:30:47] make us confess when she received a
[2:30:49] revelation
[2:30:50] she goes to Elizabeth you know what the
[2:30:53] cat did the neighborhood could have said
[2:30:56] she ran from home she has been with a
[2:30:59] man but the mystery God gives it to them
[2:31:06] he has chosen to give it unto everybody
[2:31:12] will listen to the way everybody will
[2:31:14] listen to things everybody was at this
[2:31:16] but only unto you that the angel of the
[2:31:20] Lord will come to give you the proper
[2:31:22] understanding yet I'm the pastor of the
[2:31:26] church will say that no buddy no it's
[2:31:29] not true somebody will look at you
[2:31:33] sitting there you working hard you
[2:31:36] working hard just just was more common
[2:31:43] foe but then the preacher of the church
[2:31:45] begins yeah that's what's the Bible's so
[2:31:51] don't be surprised sometimes when you
[2:31:54] see a preacher nailing so hard or
[2:31:56] certain things and yet in your heart you
[2:31:59] know differently if the Bible is the
[2:32:05] Bible the Bible when God gives you the
[2:32:08] revolution at the time that God had
[2:32:12] given her the revelation it is the
[2:32:14] revelation to Zechariah in the courier
[2:32:18] does the revelation and here she lay
[2:32:22] leaves the town and goes into the next
[2:32:24] town you start giving testimony brother
[2:32:30] I believed you my busy day somebody else
[2:32:33] will believe you and the next one that's
[2:32:38] how God does things no then
[2:33:41] in the case of manual in the case of our
[2:33:47] office Joseph and Mary he came through
[2:33:50] the dream will it do it for you question
[2:33:54] mark and even if the gun comes to them
[2:33:58] and tells them a lot a lot D that that's
[2:34:02] my son that's my daughter they will
[2:34:05] never say because the attitude in the
[2:34:08] mind begins to destroy you was to
[2:34:12] destroy your confidence that's how you
[2:34:16] understand people who understand this
[2:34:18] mystery whatever you want to tell them
[2:34:23] doesn't it gets here it goes out there
[2:34:26] the police all of the relation is open
[2:34:35] before wandering because they understand
[2:34:39] out of the ages comes the seal I love
[2:34:43] the seals the trumpets trumpets reveal
[2:34:46] live one we play we play they know you
[2:34:51] know in a period of time there is a
[2:34:53] mystery behind you there is a reason
[2:34:55] yeah wait those things are happening and
[2:34:58] God is blowing the trumpet so let them
[2:35:00] know what kind of mystery and also he's
[2:35:04] showing him the punishment just as as
[2:35:09] their shoulders just as is the killed
[2:35:11] shows as all the Bible shows that they
[2:35:18] ever destroy you
[2:35:19] after they've tried to break you down
[2:35:21] all the songs I'm going to cut them into
[2:35:26] hell and you will be lifted up and
[2:35:31] you'll stand as a mighty by him as a
[2:35:33] mighty my herb the wire
[2:35:35] come come Delta new command so that we
[2:35:37] saw he's the head of this new race
[2:35:41] coalition won 118 and he's the head of
[2:35:48] the body the church who is the beginning
[2:35:52] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[2:35:56] that all things he might have the
[2:36:00] preeminence therefore Allah if any man
[2:36:04] be in Christ is a new creation all the
[2:36:11] things have passed away behold all
[2:36:15] things are becoming new gods with new
[2:36:20] creation and the for sale under the
[2:36:26] message of the problem is and the only
[2:36:28] way to get to God I got you a prophet in
[2:36:34] Israel they understood it completely
[2:36:37] when they wanted to see me see God they
[2:36:40] want to see a prophet
[2:36:44] that's gas provided way because those
[2:36:48] who have in the wilderness said tell
[2:36:54] Moses and Moses we will come to tell us
[2:36:57] Villa and when Moses speak we're not
[2:37:04] living in
[2:37:06] after which the cloud was there oh I
[2:37:10] wish I would have been there glory be to
[2:37:12] God you you have tips the books on
[2:37:16] dissemination is still upon us and it's
[2:37:19] leading us all the way that's why the
[2:37:21] revelation is not just to repeat
[2:37:23] quotation historically but is to see the
[2:37:26] quotation wanna being revealed unto us
[2:37:29] shortly
[2:37:32] otherwise we are pure then we become
[2:37:39] great the Greeks they were known for
[2:37:42] their knowledge in Bulacan itself and
[2:37:49] disputable rosy but ever handsome
[2:37:55] uncircumcised in new creation there you
[2:38:03] can see that don't man who was all was
[2:38:06] of the old order remember in the Bible
[2:38:12] you have the order of Melchizedek and
[2:38:15] you have also this older here Jesus
[2:38:19] Christ when he was brought on earth he
[2:38:21] was lifted up to the order of
[2:38:24] Melchizedek and else also under the
[2:38:27] ministry of the Prophet we have to be
[2:38:30] lifted up to the some other a new being
[2:38:36] a new mindset by what the renewing of
[2:38:40] you mind
[2:38:43] but if psychologists in your head the
[2:38:52] meat of what is way DGP limit the
[2:38:58] limited purpose for poof oh-ho she can
[2:39:01] state six because he knows it's so good
[2:39:06] but then when you come in the world you
[2:39:09] know the loss is what zero minus ten
[2:39:19] in union with christ we come from and we
[2:40:07] have learned in other words what's more
[2:40:44] what's more until then a winner
[2:40:50] it is a desire it is a work you have to
[2:40:55] let birth name I work then we leopard on
[2:40:59] the wall from the rising of the Sun till
[2:41:03] this does appear we're working a love we
[2:41:07] shall respect we shall work in humility
[2:41:14] we shall work sometimes we fail the
[2:41:18] profile we are disrespectful forgiveness
[2:41:22] I didn't want I didn't mean to develop
[2:41:25] algorithms or do you see
[2:41:27] you see yourself do you go to you see
[2:41:32] what Daniel Priya was he went to God
[2:41:35] we have seen our love scene come in a
[2:41:42] repayment I don't have to wait for God
[2:41:44] to come and push me like I got to remind
[2:41:47] me because I am is worthless because
[2:41:51] himself he he went through the same pain
[2:41:55] he had to work I'm going to read it to
[2:41:59] you if we can get to it sometimes a lot
[2:42:01] Jesus my 30 minutes gone this new
[2:42:08] creation is not the old creation made
[2:42:10] over said a lot centers you will affect
[2:42:15] all could not be called a new creation
[2:42:20] this is exactly what it says it says it
[2:42:23] is new creation it is another creation
[2:42:28] this day from the old one what the devil
[2:42:36] made out of you that all the Serpent's
[2:42:42] old man has created something that we
[2:42:46] desire not to be this is exactly what it
[2:42:51] is no longer is dealing by waste of the
[2:42:55] land after is there dealing by ways of
[2:42:58] the flesh that was how it does with
[2:43:02] Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham
[2:43:06] issues through the godly Isaac line but
[2:43:12] now out of every kindred tribe nations
[2:43:19] and he has purposed a new creation he is
[2:43:24] the first of that creation he was the he
[2:43:27] was God created in the form of man now
[2:43:33] by his Spirit is creating
[2:43:38] many sons unto himself Amen God the
[2:43:43] Creator creating himself a part of his
[2:43:47] creation this is the true revelation of
[2:43:51] God I know it's a quotation but you have
[2:43:57] to see it by revelation for it to make
[2:44:00] sense even if I explain it here it won't
[2:44:04] make sense until you see how God is he
[2:44:10] creating a new creation in me on one it
[2:44:17] has to come by reverse even if I sit
[2:44:20] with you and I show it to you rather
[2:44:23] tell me things that you're going to tell
[2:44:25] me and you know that and there are
[2:44:33] things the next your best friend you
[2:44:36] never tell them just like Paul was
[2:44:41] saying he'll go to the - to the Romans
[2:44:44] but you oh man he just uses in language
[2:44:46] you know temptation was in my flesh how
[2:44:51] many passes Paul but then when the
[2:44:59] creation started in him mcenany was both
[2:45:02] to speak pleased the Lord to reveal his
[2:45:06] son in me then in other words it's not
[2:45:11] given to you by amen it's given to you
[2:45:14] by himself he has to come in you his
[2:45:17] workmanship that is why you could look
[2:45:23] right down down at the last age when all
[2:45:29] will be over and you see himself still
[2:45:33] in the midst of the church altar of this
[2:45:38] new creation of his sovereign power
[2:45:42] brought it to pass by use own decree
[2:45:47] elect
[2:45:52] not everybody know everybody will hit
[2:45:57] but the members other ones now going to
[2:46:00] hear how is it going to happen it's
[2:46:03] going to happen and they're going to see
[2:46:06] and they see that already working in
[2:46:08] them because they can tell because if
[2:46:13] you move if you're driving from one
[2:46:15] point from point A to point B or from
[2:46:19] here to the two are to the airport
[2:46:21] you'll know in five minutes I'll be ten
[2:46:27] minutes when you drive it but when you
[2:46:31] see that because we don't know how long
[2:46:32] is it good if you will ever be there
[2:46:36] only those that got as elected green and
[2:46:41] to come to fulfill this new creation
[2:46:45] will be able to get if we designated
[2:46:52] them is only adoption of children
[2:46:54] according to the good pleasure of his we
[2:47:00] listen for adoption on suboxone boom
[2:47:02] please it's a volunteer but by is
[2:47:06] omniscience and omnipotence a body to
[2:47:11] pass how health could he know that he
[2:47:15] would be standing in the midst of the
[2:47:17] church receiving glory from his brethren
[2:47:23] and if he did not make sure all things
[2:47:28] in you and all things he worked out
[2:47:31] according to what he knew in order that
[2:47:35] this purpose and good pleasure will
[2:47:37] brought to pass a zoological Survey
[2:47:42] eternal Lord said O Lord save a person
[2:47:47] particularly the juban plays echolalia
[2:47:49] affair passe in whom also we have
[2:47:53] obtained an inheritance until news about
[2:47:56] the accumulative being predestinated
[2:48:00] according to the purpose of him so no
[2:48:02] model of who work of all things after
[2:48:06] the counsel of his own will to do so
[2:48:10] soon know the sovereignty
[2:48:13] Alleluia amen orange you glad his
[2:48:16] covenant that should be long apart in
[2:48:18] here this is God's will Kozlov alone
[2:48:21] then is fulfilling this work and as he
[2:48:24] is fulfilling this it requires that
[2:48:27] every Son of God
[2:48:29] suck every thought of that because you
[2:48:31] said now that work I can go any further
[2:48:35] because my time is gonna have to stop
[2:48:37] because that's okay I had to show I had
[2:48:41] to show you steps this growth and the
[2:48:45] reward of all these things come on a lot
[2:48:48] of components but our time is up but
[2:48:53] then by this I believe every Son of God
[2:48:56] every third of God should have the
[2:48:59] revelation well should have the
[2:49:01] understanding how the work is being done
[2:49:05] in them what type of Kingdom was in them
[2:49:08] and what type of world the old man has
[2:49:12] to be put off the type of work just to
