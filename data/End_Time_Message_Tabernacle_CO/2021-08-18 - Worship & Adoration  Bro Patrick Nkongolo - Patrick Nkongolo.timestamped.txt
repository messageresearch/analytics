[2:23] [Music]

[3:20] there's nowhere to measure
[3:24] your world
[3:33] [Music]
[3:44] rejected
[3:47] [Music]

[4:02] and follow me
[4:06] [Music]
[4:18] [Applause]
[4:23] you
[4:24] need to
[4:28] rejected
[4:31] [Music]
[4:47] me
[4:53] [Music]
[5:06] about
[5:08] [Music]
[5:21] man
[5:25] [Applause]
[5:27] you were here
[5:29] before the world
[5:31] begins
[5:33] [Music]
[5:49] ever known
[5:52] [Music]
[5:57] and treasures off to you
[6:05] there's no way
[6:07] to measure what you were
[6:12] [Music]
[6:20] [Applause]
[6:24] [Music]
[7:00] let us read as i have 53
[7:03] one to ten
[7:17] let's read
[7:20] who has believed our report
[7:23] and to whom is the arm of the law
[7:25] revealed
[7:27] for it shall grow up before him
[7:30] as a tender plant
[7:32] and as the root out of a dry ground
[7:36] he has no form
[7:38] nor accommodations
[7:40] and when we shall
[7:41] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[7:44] that we should desire him
[7:47] he is despised and rejected of man
[7:50] a man of sorrow
[7:52] and acquainted with grief
[7:54] and we hid as he wear our faces from him
[7:58] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[8:03] surely he has borne our grief
[8:06] and carried our sorrow
[8:08] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[8:11] of god and afflicted
[8:14] but he was wounded for our transgression
[8:17] he was bruised for our iniquities
[8:20] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[8:22] him
[8:23] and with his stripes we are healed
[8:28] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[8:30] have turned everyone to his own way
[8:33] and the law has led on him the iniquity
[8:36] of us all
[8:40] was oppressed and he was afflicted
[8:42] yet he opened not his mouth
[8:45] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[8:48] and as a sheep before her shearers in
[8:51] islam
[8:52] so he opened not his mouth
[8:56] he was taken from prison and from
[8:58] judgment
[8:59] and we shall declare his generation
[9:02] for he was cut off out of the land of
[9:04] the living for the transgression of my
[9:07] people was stricken
[9:09] and he made his grave with the wicked
[9:12] and with the rich in his death
[9:14] because he had done no violence neither
[9:17] was any deceit in his mouth
[9:21] yet he pleased the lord to bruise him he
[9:25] has put him to grief
[9:26] when thou shalt make his soul and
[9:29] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[9:32] he shall prolong his death his days
[9:35] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[9:37] prosper in his head amen
[9:42] amen
