[11:17] verse 11 and he said
[11:21] a certain man had two sons and the
[11:24] younger of them said to his father
[11:27] father give me the portion of goods that
[11:29] fought off to me
[11:31] and it divided unto them is livings
[11:37] and not many days after the younger son
[11:39] got her all together
[11:41] and took his journey into a far country
[11:44] and there wasted
[11:45] his substance with rochester's living
[11:47] and when he had spent all
[11:49] their arose a mighty famine on the land
[11:53] and he began to be in wants and he went
[11:56] and joined
[11:56] himself to a citizen of the country and
[11:59] he sent him into his field
[12:01] to feed swine and he would
[12:04] he would fend and fill his bed with the
[12:07] ask
[12:07] that the swine did hit and no man gave
[12:10] unto him
[12:13] and when he came to himself he said how
[12:16] many hired servants of my fathers have
[12:18] bred enough to spur and i perish with
[12:22] anger
[12:23] and i will arise and go to my father and
[12:26] will say unto him
[12:27] father i have sinned against heaven and
[12:30] before thee
[12:31] and i am no more worthy to be called a
[12:33] son
[12:34] make me as one of thy heart servant and
[12:38] he arose and came to his father
[12:40] but when he was yet agree a way off his
[12:43] father saw him
[12:44] and had compassion and ran and fell on
[12:47] his neck and kissed him
[12:50] and the son said unto him father i have
[12:52] sinned against heaven
[12:54] and in thy sight and no more worthy to
[12:56] be called a son
[12:58] but the father said to his servant bring
[13:01] forth the best robe
[13:02] and put it on him and put a ring on his
[13:05] hand
[13:06] and shoes on his feet and bring either
[13:09] the fatted cough and kill it lessa
[13:12] eat and be merry for this my son was
[13:15] dead
[13:16] and is alive again he was lost and
[13:19] is found and they began to be mere
[13:22] mary now his early son was in the field
[13:25] and as he came and drew night to the
[13:27] house he heard music and dancing
[13:30] and he called one of the servants and
[13:32] asked what these things meant
[13:34] and he said unto him thy brother is come
[13:37] and our father el
[13:38] kill the fatted cough because he has
[13:41] received him
[13:42] safe and sound and was angry i would not
[13:45] go in therefore
[13:46] came his father out and entreated him
[13:50] and answering to his father lord this
[13:52] many years do i serve thee
[13:54] neither transgressed thee at any time
[13:57] that commanded me and yet that never
[14:00] gave
[14:00] me a kid that i might make merry with my
[14:03] friends
[14:04] by soon as this the son was come which
[14:07] have devoured a living with
[14:09] our lords that has killed for him the
[14:11] father cough
[14:13] and he said unto him son thou have her
[14:16] with me
[14:17] and know that i have is dying it was
[14:20] meat that we should
[14:21] be merry and be glad for this thy
[14:23] brother was dead
[14:24] and is alive again and was lost and now
[14:27] is found
[14:52] 8 28 28
[15:01] roman 8 28 and we know that all things
[15:05] work together for good to them that love
[15:08] god
[15:09] and to them who are they called
[15:11] according to his purpose
[15:14] verse 29 for whom it did for know
[15:18] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[15:21] to the image of his son
[15:23] that he might be the firstborn among
[15:25] many brethren
[15:27] moreover um indeed predestinates
[15:30] you also called and um equate
[15:34] them you also justify and whom you
[15:36] justify
[15:37] them you also glorified
[15:50] if god be for us we can be against us
[15:56] our father creator of heaven and earth
[16:00] once again we thank you lord jesus
[16:02] christ
[16:06] for the opportunity to be called into
[16:08] your house tonight
[16:09] jesus christ lord jesus christ i know by
[16:13] myself i cannot do anything
[16:17] but with you i can't do something
[16:48] spirits of destruction
[17:02] those that came
[17:17] he said that you read the stone that was
[17:19] cast with our hands
[17:23] he said that stone was crying grace
[17:25] grace grace
[17:26] jesus christ
[17:45] now take the control of the service now
[17:48] i'll offend you so you'll have glory
[17:50] at the end of the service oh not the
[17:52] jesuit christian in the name of jesus
[17:54] christ amen
[17:55] amen in fact
[17:58] once again may the lord bless you
[18:02] you know in the bible what we just read
[18:06] in luke chapter 11
[18:10] the bible was talking about the two boys
[18:14] that were in their father's service
[18:20] and as the bible was telling us one came
[18:22] to his father
[18:27] and he told him dad i want you to give
[18:29] him my portion
[18:32] so i may go away to do my business
[18:40] by university
[19:09] and he went and joined himself to a
[19:11] citizen of the country and he sent him
[19:13] to the field to feed swine
[19:16] versus it verse 17
[19:20] and when it came to himself
[19:50] i'm no more worthy to be called i said
[19:55] make me as one of the higher servants
[19:59] and here we can understand
[20:03] that he's talking about forgiveness
[20:10] that's why tonight is based on the
[20:13] forgiveness
[21:02] in 1963 october venture our 28th october
[21:10] after reading roman 8 what we just read
[21:27] 63 28 october when i come among the
[21:31] pentecostal people
[21:32] a few years ago wish the lord sent me
[21:35] over
[21:36] when you're over then
[21:42] you remain
[21:56] foreign
[22:24] okay
[22:53] over my weight okay
[22:58] okay 25.
[23:03] may the lord add his blessing to the
[23:04] reading of his word
[23:06] and now i want to speak on the subject
[23:09] of burden
[23:11] now listen carefully about what i'm
[23:13] saying
[23:16] i love to read but when i met a lot
[23:19] because if you come with questions
[23:24] i'll tell you i was there i was not the
[23:26] one who tell this
[23:28] boy
[23:31] now at the moment i will know how to
[23:33] answer you through brother broadband
[23:36] now okay
[23:44] i think i've been saying the bible said
[23:47] here tonight
[23:48] that it gave us all things well we
[23:51] certainly could not speak
[23:53] on all things but we will take
[23:57] one thing that he has given us that is
[24:00] pardon
[24:01] and i think that's a glorious word to be
[24:03] pardoned
[24:05] because we are all guilty of sin we have
[24:08] all seen
[24:09] and come short of of the glory of god
[24:12] and god through his son
[24:13] has broadened us from this guilt of
[24:17] iniquity and sin
[24:21] 26 and a pardon reminds me of a story i
[24:25] read once
[24:26] of the revolutionary war i believe it
[24:28] was
[24:29] that there was a man a soldier foot
[24:32] soldier
[24:33] that had did something that was the
[24:36] court had found him guilty and
[24:37] was sentenced to be shot i believe he
[24:40] was
[24:41] neglecting the post of duty in time of
[24:44] battle
[24:45] and was going to be killed by a firing
[24:47] squad
[24:48] and one fellow felt so sorry for this
[24:51] man until the final made his way
[24:53] to the great president lincoln
[25:09] the pastor asked me to read it in french
[25:11] also
[25:27] and one photo felt so sorry for this man
[25:29] until he finally made his way to the
[25:31] great prison lincoln
[25:33] lincoln being a christian gentleman they
[25:35] said he was riding
[25:37] up in his carriage when the messenger
[25:39] met him and he fell upon his knees and
[25:41] said
[25:42] mr wrinkled the president of the united
[25:44] states
[25:45] cancer he said i ask mercy for one
[25:49] knowing that you are a christian and
[25:51] know that you have turned the nest in
[25:53] your heart for the weary
[25:54] he said my friend was at the pose of
[25:57] duty
[25:58] where he was testing but when the guns
[26:01] was worrying and the cannon firing
[26:04] he got scared and left the post of duty
[26:07] mr lincoln
[26:08] it didn't mean to do it he is a good man
[26:12] and now in a week from this day he must
[26:15] die by a firing squad
[26:17] there is no way to save him except you
[26:19] will sign
[26:20] his burden
[26:23] mr lincoln with tears in in his eyes
[26:26] pulled a piece of paper from his brief
[26:28] and wrote on ear
[26:30] i abram lincoln polled in this man of
[26:33] such
[26:33] and shall not die and sign his name to
[26:36] it
[26:37] and the man gave him god's blessing and
[26:40] returned back to the prison and said to
[26:42] his friend
[26:43] i have your pardon and he put it out
[26:46] upon a piece of paper and showed to him
[26:49] and the man said don't mock me here i am
[26:52] fixing to die
[26:53] and then come with such as that i do not
[26:56] believe it
[26:57] i just can't believe that it is not so
[27:00] any man could sign his name abraham
[27:03] lincoln
[27:04] he said but this is the president's
[27:06] signature said
[27:08] you are burdened and returned his back
[27:10] and walk away
[27:12] and the man died under the firing squad
[27:15] 33 and then here is a release from
[27:18] abraham lincoln
[27:20] the president of the united states to
[27:22] release this man
[27:23] and yet they shot him so it was tried in
[27:27] the federal court
[27:28] and here was the decision a pardon is
[27:31] not a problem
[27:32] unless it be accepted that has a problem
[27:36] so it is tonight that read that god
[27:40] gives us all things
[27:41] and it gives us burden it is important
[27:44] to those who want to accept god's word
[27:46] as burden but if only judges read it it
[27:50] doesn't mean that you are
[27:51] potent it means that you have got to
[27:53] accept it as your pardon
[27:55] that god gave his son to die in your
[27:58] stead and then
[27:59] it is important release from guilt
[28:03] is what we wish to place on this
[28:05] important from god
[28:07] is a release from guilt now they're
[28:09] turning away from psychological doctrine
[28:12] of some sort that might in some way give
[28:15] you a little feeling that you have done
[28:17] what's right but joining church oh
[28:20] taking up some creed
[28:22] but it is a release from your guilt by
[28:24] the power of calvary
[28:27] something has released you there is no
[28:29] more guilt
[28:30] the bible says i believe in romans 5
[28:33] 1 ok mercy thank you
[28:38] i was trying to look at the dictionary
[28:40] la definition
[28:42] pardon the definition of the word
[28:47] in the dictionary
[28:54] is an action to be released from a guilt
[28:56] in offense
[28:58] of the offense
[29:06] uh to not make the the person
[29:09] accountable for his mistakes
[29:15] oh to not have resentment oh it's that
[29:17] person
[29:22] you know in matthew 18 21 the bible
[29:39] me and i'll forgive him till seven times
[29:41] jesus
[29:42] jesus said
[29:45] i said not on today
[29:50] but until 70 times seven hello
[30:01] therefore is the kingdom of god lacking
[30:03] unto a certain king which would take
[30:05] account of his servants
[30:36] [Music]
[31:02] hmm we gave him the depth where
[31:06] verse eventually very strong
[31:14] but the same servant went out and found
[31:16] one of his favorite servants
[31:20] which owed him 100 pence
[31:23] and he laid hands on him
[32:26] is
[32:49] forgive not every one of his brothers
[32:50] their trespasses we
[32:52] allow you but now here piano
[33:06] oh should i forgive to my fellow servant
[33:08] seven times if he's seen again
[33:11] jesus said jesus told him not seven
[33:13] members
[33:14] of san diego but i'm telling you
[33:16] seventeen times seven men tell us
[33:18] but now it is best to you to make the
[33:20] mouth
[33:22] every
[33:33] it means you are on the obligation to
[33:34] forgive him
[33:36] he
[33:37] [Music]
[34:19] ah she did something that didn't place
[34:21] you elvia is the demand power she calmly
[34:23] asked for forgiveness
[34:25] oh annie forgive me you know i didn't
[34:28] know what i
[34:29] have done wasn't right uh it couldn't
[34:33] hurt you well
[34:34] okay and you say okay i'll forgive you
[34:38] and the next day she does something
[34:41] she cut my ass for forgiveness give me
[34:45] what i've done
[35:00] should be the same way you should ask
[35:01] him for forgiveness
[35:04] because she is the daughter of sir
[35:07] it is not you are under your cross
[35:10] oh i am the head of the house
[35:13] i could not go ask for forgiveness
[35:17] not a good attitude for a believer
[35:21] because that daughter
[35:24] she also needs to hear from your mouth
[35:28] forgiveness
[35:30] [Music]
[35:42] there is a trust
[35:57] yes there is something that says
[36:01] trust in somebody oh when you do
[36:04] something evil
[36:06] you say forgive me
[36:09] oh the other one when you listen to it
[36:11] don't set the person
[36:12] up the other one will have more choices

[36:26] decisions

[36:32] i didn't like it
[36:36] you are present jesus christ
[36:52] before praying for
[37:49] must shut you that lie every day
[37:53] he said i have more trust in you
[37:56] in question and answers
[38:34] [Music]
[38:48] oh something bad some please or without
[38:51] more
[38:52] love the bible said jesus jesus said
[38:55] okay
[38:57] that's your yeah
[39:10] [Music]
[39:27] venn word that you have you know that
[39:32] they took the relevant the bible said
[39:34] you will be all held accountable for
[39:36] everything
[39:39] but what kind of people should be there
[39:41] jackie son

[39:47] full of love
[39:53] oh now be fooling around
[40:08] it is in my nature well tell prophet
[40:11] brother what a prophet
[40:14] it could be ambrose because to ask for
[40:17] forgiveness
[40:19] but you cannot ask for forgiveness
[40:36] is
[41:03] i have more saliva
[41:07] when i have to make something
[41:11] oh all kinds of things hey they thought
[41:13] they thought

[41:31] similar
[42:01] up his post of duty along the way
[42:04] then that person has to be fired
[42:08] when they went to abram and possible
[42:12] they think that was impossible
[42:19] [Music]
[42:30] and your father comes up something
[42:32] similar
[42:33] i love bill and she said man bill
[42:38] you go again
[43:08] oh that i may stop doing this
[43:24] this morning when you do the same thing
[43:28] yes sir you must repent yourself
[43:38] i'm not saying you
[44:20] reason why in the message we don't move
[44:22] forward

[50:30] type of christ
[50:32] that's also some effect that you might
[50:33] should be exclusive we are made in
[50:35] christchurch
[50:37] that's the character of a true believer
[50:39] joseph

[54:04] blessed be the name of the lord okay
[54:08] benny i thought when he said
[54:11] short exaltation i thought he is
[54:13] starting the message
[54:19] sometimes god leads his servant in a
[54:21] certain way
[54:22] alfaj conducive service in southern
[54:24] manila
[54:27] it's not the length of what has been
[54:30] preached but
[54:33] if we can take every bit of the word
[54:36] that
[54:36] that was pronounced
[54:41] i think it will do good to us
[54:45] as brothers and sisters they come to of
[54:48] course yourself
[54:49] we have a duty to encourage one another
[54:55] mistakes will be always part of our life
[55:01] but when there is a love projected
[55:04] my you will
[55:08] change those mistakes into
[55:11] an opportunity to assist resolution she
[55:14] says there are an opportunity
[55:17] and when there is real
[55:20] love you will not even
[55:24] see those mistakes remember
[55:30] you will see what is in you
[55:35] if you have god in you unfold
[55:38] you will see god all the time in your
[55:40] brother and your sisters
[55:42] dear to your father vodka of houses
[55:45] if you don't have enough god see we've
[55:48] never passed the day
[55:50] you have more of a devil diablo
[55:53] you will see always evil after evil
[55:59] but um he said
[56:02] maybe faith will
[56:06] is always based on forgiveness
[56:11] and now we have also i mean he said
[56:14] so many things that's why i always like
[56:17] to take
[56:18] notes
[56:21] uh when i go meditate
[56:25] i take the paragraph shape on the
[56:27] paragraph i read it again
[56:30] and i pray you take the scripture
[56:34] you read it again
[56:39] because you know if you take
[56:42] one time i was in a church here it's a
[56:44] very important
[56:45] glacier say another church
[56:50] one of the evening service learn to
[56:52] salvage the soil
[56:54] the pastor came
[56:57] he said i have my bible here my bible
[57:01] randomly he opened somewhere
[57:08] this is the scripture
[57:24] open
[58:04] you will see the leadership of the
[58:06] spirit with all of
[58:08] our country there is pray and that's why
[58:10] i always
[58:11] said
[58:14] that reminds me again
[58:19] we all the minister it was like 11
[58:22] ministers in the church
[58:23] have actually meniscus to come on the
[58:25] glaciers
[58:26] was not in the service many people sell
[58:29] this he came
[58:30] on a sunday eleven years oh pastor lady
[58:33] but
[58:33] gave him another scripture
[58:37] excuse me pastor excuse me 10 minutes is
[58:40] nothing else
[58:43] he took maybe 45 minutes he'll
[58:46] appreciate minutes oh but the bottom
[58:48] line brother sister
[58:50] this bible point of career
[58:53] you can say i'm gonna lock myself
[58:56] somewhere
[58:58] read from the beginning to the end
[59:02] you will still miss a lot of time
[59:07] you take the same verse
[59:12] you read it every day every day you find
[59:15] something different
[59:19] so that's why we um
[59:22] brother branham said a christian must
[59:24] read his bible
[59:29] and pray because it's not like reading a
[59:33] newspaper
[59:35] no but if you are expecting to get
[59:38] something
[59:38] message that on the other cake shows god
[59:40] will always speak to you
[59:43] and every day we have a need
[59:47] we have a problem we have we need the
[59:50] solution
[59:51] and i believe if you say every day i
[59:54] read
[59:55] some what is the the longest
[59:59] summit ah
[1:00:03] sunday school so every day you read
[1:00:06] that song and what is the shortest story
[1:00:13] you read it every day and you say god
[1:00:17] speak to me in your power every day you
[1:00:19] will get
[1:00:20] something so we thank god
[1:00:23] for the inspiration for inspiration
[1:00:37] you know in the army they don't play
[1:00:44] it happened that you are in the front
[1:00:46] line
[1:00:48] enough unless you receive an order from
[1:00:52] the leader a monkey
[1:01:36] death row to enter
[1:01:40] seed for one time today he went to the
[1:01:42] highest level
[1:01:46] to ask for forgiveness and the president
[1:01:49] did not have a lot of things
[1:01:53] took a piece of paper
[1:01:56] forgiven lincoln abraham lincoln go give
[1:02:00] to them
[1:02:01] it was up to that person person
[1:02:14] and then when they killed him i couldn't
[1:02:15] reach a way his friend was
[1:02:17] so mad son i'm
[1:02:32] but the final decision came finally
[1:02:36] forgiveness is forgiveness
[1:02:41] if received as forgiveness
[1:02:46] brother in short
[1:02:49] every day god is calling you jesus
[1:02:52] god calling me je m'appelle and god a
[1:02:55] jew
[1:02:56] want to make sure racial i see way dead
[1:02:59] okay
[1:03:00] we are forgiven god want to
[1:03:04] make sure that we are forgiven
[1:03:08] all our mistakes all our wrongdoing to
[1:03:11] no photo god
[1:03:12] doesn't count the controversy
[1:03:42] very difficult for married men
[1:03:47] to ask for forgiveness to their wife
[1:03:52] and that was the leadership of the
[1:03:54] spirit speaking to our hearts to tell
[1:03:56] our country
[1:03:58] very often we try always to find excuses
[1:04:02] christopher said it where there's excuse
[1:04:04] but the word of god is calling
[1:04:06] us to be humble
[1:04:10] if you want to go up the way
[1:04:13] is always down to the sound do you know
[1:04:16] if you have a wife who never asked for
[1:04:18] forgiveness survivors have been from
[1:04:20] kingdom party power
[1:04:21] the best way to teach her that for
[1:04:24] something
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:37] for children
[1:04:52] that's the way god is looking at all of
[1:04:54] us
[1:04:57] and that's why he is sending the words
[1:05:00] to correct us so let us stand on our
[1:05:03] feet
[1:05:06] based on what uh what was spoken
[1:05:09] by this you say many things was spoken
[1:05:13] to we are going to
