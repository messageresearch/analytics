[44:36] greetings to where we going to
[44:42] go one time in the
[44:46] Bible the children were going to the
[44:48] Lord Jesus
[44:51] Christ and the disciple wanted to kick
[44:54] them out
[44:58] and Jesus said hinder not the children
[45:00] to come to
[45:03] me because the kingdom is like
[45:08] them but there are adult but they look
[45:11] like
[45:13] children and Malachi promised at the end
[45:17] time to bring back the hearts of the
[45:21] children I would like tonight
[45:27] let us be relaxed in the atmosphere of
[45:30] the
[45:30] children
[45:34] tonight if you keep your standard you
[45:38] miss
[45:40] it I want us to behave like children
[45:44] amen
[45:50] amen my text is the walls of Jericho Has
[45:55] Fallen
[45:58] I'm not saying that the walls of Jericho
[46:01] will
[46:03] fall I'm saying they are already been
[46:09] Fallen I came tonight with profound
[46:16] conviction every walls that has been
[46:18] standing for a while before
[46:22] you I'm not saying that they will fall
[46:25] in the future
[46:27] but they already been
[46:31] Fallen we are just coming to notice the
[46:35] the the
[46:39] chaos that is why we we should stand I'm
[46:42] taking Joshua chapter 6 let us
[46:47] stand verse 15 to verse
[46:51] 16 and I'm jumping to verse
[46:55] 20 our reading in the name of the Lord
[47:04] [Music]
[47:14] Jesus and it came to pass on the seventh
[47:17] day that they Rose early about the daing
[47:20] of the day and compassed the city after
[47:23] the same manner seven times only on that
[47:26] day they Compass the city seven
[47:41] times and it came to pass at the seventh
[47:45] time when the priest blew with the
[47:47] trumpet Joshua said unto the people
[47:49] shout for the Lord has given you the
[47:53] City verse 20
[48:17] am so the people shouted when the priest
[48:21] blew with the trumpet and it came to
[48:23] pass when the people heard the sound of
[48:25] the trumpet and the people shouted with
[48:28] a great shout that the wall fell down
[48:30] flat so that the people went up to the
[48:33] city every man straight before him they
[48:35] took the
[48:37] city may God bless his word you may be
[48:45] seated the day of it was the seventh day
[48:48] of the
[48:49] [Music]
[48:53] battle the Army compassed the city
[48:55] seventh times
[48:58] [Music]
[49:03] the war strategy started by the general
[49:10] Joshua it was not to send missiles
[49:13] toward the
[49:16] walls it was not to launch bombs upon
[49:19] the city of the the
[49:23] walls there was another special strategy
[49:26] that was given that
[49:30] day I believe the same strategy will
[49:33] give the same result
[49:35] tonight what was that
[49:40] strategy J didn't say take the
[49:45] walls say shake it or be it up
[49:48] [Music]
[49:51] down he said that they will blow the
[49:53] trumpet by the
[49:55] priest and people will shout are we
[50:00] [Music]
[50:02] together do we have a priest tonight
[50:05] here do we have a people tonight
[50:08] here so the strategy
[50:11] is I will blow the trumpet and you will
[50:15] shout and the Wolves will fall that's
[50:19] why they did back then and the Bible say
[50:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[50:25] and forever amen
[50:27] amen I don't have any
[50:30] trumpet though I have
[50:33] it I will sound The Trumpet of the word
[50:36] and you will
[50:38] shout I told you to be like kids
[50:40] children if or else the thing will pass
[50:43] you by amen and the prophet
[50:47] said in the message the provided
[50:51] way he preach uh the 1st December
