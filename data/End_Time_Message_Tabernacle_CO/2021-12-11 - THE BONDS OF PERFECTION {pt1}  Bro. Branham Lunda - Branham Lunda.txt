through ignorance in holy things of the Lord then he shall bring for his trespass unto the Lord a ram without blemish out of the fork what with the thy estimation by shakel of silver after the shackle of a centuary for the trespass offering and he shall make amend for the harms for he has done in the holy thing and he shall have the fifth part there thereof and give it unto the priest and the priest shall make the atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering and it shall be forgiven him and if a if a soul sin and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the Commandment of the Lord though the wi is not yet is he guilty and he shall B his iniquity and shall bring a ram without blemish out of the FK with thy estimation for the trespass offering unto the priest and the priest shall make an atonment for him concerning his ignorance wherein he heard and wi it not and he shall be forgiven in the First Corinthians chapter 13 in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen CH charity never faileth but whether there's be prophecies they shall fail whether be tongues they shall cease whether be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come and that which is part shall be done away amen amen amen the Lord have the blessing the reading of the word amen amen I greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ we always happy to be in the presence of the Lord we thank God for giving us the opportunity to be counting among the living I also thank our pastor for giv us this opportunity to speak to you the people of God I always say we honored to bring the word of God brother say when somebody trust you you can deceive the person of TR we don't we don't want abuse it let us may God keep us not to abuse it I didn't want really to preach it's just exhortation I would like to share with you if God's willing let us lead us to pray a lot and to examine our I ask for forgiveness to God back always I run away from this job today I wanted to call the pastor to apologize and somebody something told me like who are you what problem with you may the Lord forgive us we believe God will bless us even with one word I don't really have a topic to title to give M I believe God willing on Sunday we're going to have a topic a t but today I just want entitle this the bonds of perfection amen amen this is just a little exaltation I know we are the children of Mal we love the prophet amen amen because the prophet sent to us to help us to know to understand the Bible because if you try to understand the Bible on our ways we will not understand it the Bible is like a Wilderness like a great forest and if you're not used to you will get L it Tak someone who's know is born there to know to show you the way like a guide if you go this way there mountains there's start leading you go let's go this way let's go this is why you know with this Bible it brought a lot of theology a lot of Glory to God this same Bible brought us a prophet we so grateful because we now in confusion amen amen Inus where we read we see that it's a law in the Old Testament people in the Old Testament they were living by laws and here was the law that God gave to Moses he told Moses if am you somebody sin so for me the Lord to forgive that person he has to bring a ram he has to bring the ram to the priest and that real should be blemished it doesn't have to have blish body it has to be a perfect lamb and then that person will present to the priest and the priest has to examine this lamb happening and The Sinner was putting his hand upon the lamb because the land was representing the person how things were happening in the Old Testament as I was saying I won't be long just few words that was just a law by brother bham says despite that law but you notice that lamb it's just a lamb just it doesn't have soul a lamb doesn't have a soul but as a human we're created after the image of God we have this is the reason why the type that God showed in the Old Testament we despite it was just the shadow that things to [Music] come despite that the worshiper will bring the lamb the sin was not completely atoned because the blood of the animal is not comparable with the blood of human that the man will come and say I've done this I did this brought for the remission of my sin the priest will examine the land is without blemish and they will slay the lamb despite that fact men will go back but he still had the desire to do the same thing because in that blood there wasn't any power to deliver us amen amen but we will understand today it was just the shadow that things to come through this is why we have to examine ourselves to know that if back there was the shadow because the lamb typify Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God presented him like a lamb of God that take away the sin of the world and today believers when we do evil we come to Jesus the work of Cal on Jesus Christ the Lamb of God because the king's man Redeemer when he forgive it's for for for for brother bam says the Sinners doesn't have to have the the desire of sin in the Old Testament you confess your sin you bring the L but you always come back with the same desire to do the same but back there they didn't have any power it was just a shadow say that blood could not take away just cover Here Comes Jesus chist Jesus Christ is nothing but because he saw because he saw that a human being that [Applause] fell he he needs to be Redeemed by his kins the blood that has to redeem us according to the r he has to be a king he has to be a man like me he has to be someone without blame somebody doesn't have to go through sex have the power to redeem the person that fell and nobody could do it even the prophet could come Moses for example somebody who go go to the mountain spend 40 days and 40 nights he was also the type of Christ but he could do nothing because he was born through sex amen amen yes sir and we find out that God so according to his own law because that God doesn't go away from he's not like us I can create a law and tomorrow I change it he doesn't go away from his according to his own law he saw the person that has to redeem he has to be a wealthy he has to be a man born without sin he has to be just nobody could be that there is the reason why himself God the superal God created that cells in Mary cells created iny the blood cell Jesus Christ was born it was nothing but Jesus that is why brother say and the blood that was in Jesus it wasn't the human blood it wasn't the Jew blood it wasn't the blood of Joseph it was the the blood of God himself you not Redeemed by Jew blood by the blood of God himself the reason why today when we come to Jesus we confess our sins if it's really God who convince us our sins are not just washed away even the desire of sin hallelujah hallelujah has to die completely and tonight we have to find out if we confess and that desire still there then we have to know who redeemed us are we did we confess really [Music] well brother bam say in this message Christ is not welcome I believe it preached in 1955 the unwelcome Christ welcome Christ let me skip few things here paragraph let me skip a few things here then the land was slay uh the land died so that August 22 Yeah 28 why he has the birth right because the lamb the lamb has the birth right they never examine the they examine the lamb the priest looks at the lamb now you Bible readers know that under the laws of redemption in the New Testament no matter what's wrong with you amen amen brother was talking about like here in the Old Testament was just Shadow you commit you bring a lamb Without Blame to the priest and the priest that's why we can call today the pastors the Ephesians 4 and the pastor will examine the lamb that has to be blemish Without Blame slay the lamb and do the service for the remission of this is why you find out in the Old Testament people has a full consideration to the priest that's right amen amen because this is the law of God you cannot go by yourself to the holiest of because in the Old Testament for God to forgive your sin there was a procedure the worshiper who commit sin because for God to forgive you he has to see the blood you bring your lamb the man of God the priest will take the lamb he will wash the lamb which is the type of the baptism water he will slay the land and the blood will come out and he will take the land and put it in the little amen and this is our God who established that order you cannot go by yourself he has to be the priest he take the blood himself the priest he will take the blood and bring in the holiest of holy and if God agree your forgiveness and there in the Holiness of holy will come to consume the sacrifice he will burn the blood to say I the Lord have forgiven sir amen [Applause] amen and the holiest of holy and the outs C and the in the old test people have high esteem to to the people that were working in the church and today people that know God have high consideration to the priest because if you play with the priest a priest is like an intercessor amen amen people brother bham says those are people that got picked from the levite family their work the speciality it's always in the house of God you see before going in the Holiness of holy he has to go through the same procedure to take a lamb without he will go offer the sacrifice for his own s amen amen because if he doesn't do it he goes inside with unlean life uness sin he will die inside God was very serious in the Old Testament all this was the shadow of things to come yeah brother bam says in the New Testament no matter what's wrong with you don't look at yourself look at your lamb somebody has a lamb today amen amen look at your lamb says amen can you find any fault in him God doesn't look at you let's go slowly he looks at the lamb so if there's no fault in the lamb there's no fault with you there amen amen therefore have faith rise up claim your Goden privilege god-given privilege no matter what it looks like how sick you [Applause] feel how far Advance your stag you can be healed amen amen is somebody has a lamp today who lamb if that lamb doesn't have any if God sees you he SE like you're perfect and you know why God me to read this uh scripture in First Corinthian First Corinthian he says prophe will Sease even the preaching will seize one day because now we know in little in when the perfect will come which is little will done away brother bam says the perfect is always Jesus Christ the perfect is The Headstone the perfect is the Divine love now let me get inside my preaching bam says can you find any fault in him no no God doesn't look at you looks at the lamb so if there's no fault in the lamb there's no fault with you how I I'll be looking at my brother because God himself when he's looking at me Hallelujah as he knows I I've already put my My Hands of Faith at calary upon the lamb the lamb who is Jesus Christ the one the one who went to the cross for my sins when he look at me it says you perfect but when you see your brother when you see your brother your sister how do you see the brother and your sister how do you see them you see them that they're perfect when God sees USF are we really perfect amen amen are we really perfect about I know by myself I'm not perfect this is why I'm always running away from job I'm unw worthy every day I I'm not worthy but because of the blood of Jesus Christ when he sees me look at me he doesn't see me anymore he sees the Lamb of if doesn't have any then you perfect why me as a Son of God why I wouldn't also see as perfect why I wouldn't see my sisters perfect in other words because the bond of perfection says it's the Divine love and brother bham says when the the love and Serv Grace takes place this is why give punches to the devil the devil can preach this is why you see I will not go to heaven because I'm preaching I will not go to heaven because I speak Tong nor because I'm somebody I'll go to heaven if I have the Holy Ghost amen amen and now if God himself by looking at me he says you perfect the love why I wouldn't see my brother is perfect because when God sees me he said why he so M because he has the land I see confessed you perfect but when the devil goes to the father you didn't see what he has done God told the devil you didn't see that he repented but you the devil you never repented since you existed you never repented this is why today I I wanted just to say is unworthy but when God sees me sees me perfect not because perfect but because of the Lamb why then I don't to consider my brother and my sisters perfect in other words as chistian why I have to see only the wrong side of that person why do I have to FOC the wrong a mistake that he has done not to see the good side of that person and let tonight the bonds of love the Perfection let it be divine love to bring us us as children of God see the same thing as our father amen Amen brother says God by taking our place as a lamb he didn't just die for your healing plenty blessing that for which he has taken your place and today you have the privilege to claim it amen amen not just for your healing not just for your forgiveness to for everything that the devil has even poverty even sickness any other link can let it be seen Christ has taken our place the one who believes in him let me do you love brother BR amen amen the message Perfection I love this message says this B of Love beloved is later than we think without love the love of God even said without the love of God nobody would see him brother bam say this is the thing that lack in the church today is delaying the Rapture think about brother bham says we now wait for the church churches for them to come I'm saying we're not going to wait call churches to come close the door close the door and then people we start then all close the church it's open this brother they even shut up the connections everything start thinking going to ask for forgiveness to this brother God has given us time God has given us time I wanted to read a lot of things here now God will help us in the message perfection in 1956 Jun 10 notice I said this for you to understand paragraph 15 today in the world the Bible has predicted it there three kind of people one of them there's a cold people formal formal formal indiffer and different they just go ahead is no more than belonging to a l they go to church talk a little about this that and the Lord and so forth and come back but no actual Born Again experience amen amen formal and different people they go to church they talk a little bit about this and about the Lord and other things and they go back home but no actual notice brother bam said the actual again experience someone who has like a born again experience will hat his brother I don't believe that some of them claim do you love the prophet or some of them claim it but their life proves that it's not [Applause] so now that's over one side one way it's another side The Fanatic and the real true church didn't finish his Jesus said so they will be so closed together it will deceive the very elect I was reading brother bham in the lamb book of the the lamb book that the life L book in this hand time the seduction if it wasn't Go I mean if God didn't cut off the days if there wasn't any elect the seduction will be very great in such a way even for the very elect will be difficult for them seduction it's just here in on the world but the seduction is even here you're thinking you're talking about of Jesus but who who gave up the message it was with a great Pastor who was God himself the Creator but despite that somebody sell the message in the church but I love the attitude of our Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ oh God give me your spirit he knew the person he was living with he never kick him out of the church he never gave him to the hand of the devil they will be very close he will deceive the very elect now many people as soon as they see the fanatism mix up with the real are the there's nothing to it you see that beloved this message is the truth but there's also Fanatics that came along they call themselves Brothers they call themselves sisters amen amen this is why it looks like when some people come when they see those fanatic because they don't know why why they came that's why the backslide you have to know told you in this [Applause] message where you do you stand where as brother preached last Sunday because we believe in this you don't I mean you won't notice that even myself talking to you I'm not saying that the case I can do something that can deceive that can disappo I'm human being but if you don't know why you coming here you don't know why you believe the message you go back to the wall today this is the time that we should know why I'm in the message why am I doing here did I follow a movement did I follow someone or I just follow like so one thing will stop one day may God help us they say there's nothing there this church Fanatics there's nothing there they go ahead you see that the same thing the done Satan doesn't fool with trying to pervert that he's trying to per this truth how does the devil will try to per this Truth by from the pastor from theal by from the brother from by the brother from the message yeah the followers if there's not that actual Born Again experience one day you be the one that will pervert the truth tonight let God bring down the love divine love amen more than able to consume consum desire make help us he's trying to pervert this truth and this Fanatics here is trying to personate the truth see this where your danger line lies right there he us to stay spiritual a fanatic spirit will not should not have a place in your life the spirit that try to per the word should not have a unfortunately it will still be there because those two spirits will go along and they can try to SCE even their very if it was possible the very will not be deceived they will always be fanatic there will always people trying to imitate imp personate the very the very Daughters of God they will stay with the word it behooves us to stay spiritual read the word anything anything that rises outside contrary to the word then cast it aside amen yes sir amen amen everything that is not in the word cast it aside Lord there's the reason why I'm too hard on woman preachers brother says there's a lot of things here let me just skip few things God is showing us shadows in the Old Testament but you know Christ was slain before the foundation of the world when God look at on upon the Earth he saw the only thing that could save a man lost I don't know if in this word I mean terms but it could be something like that man could not be saved he will [Music] se but let me look at I just see thousand of sincere heart coming I see thousand of people trying to be Sav and they wouldn't want to experience the the horrible Destruction for the devil and his angels and they have to go to the perpetual and sincere people will see it and I will have a man by the name of be born there will be another one in the name of jacobob Jacob will be he won't be very good to start by but in his heart he will love things of God this is why I will choose him trying to say here God is in for knowledge he saw us he saw the age of he saw who was going to be the prophet he saw the age of the that go forward until now he saw us he saw you he saw that you love God you believe his word he also saw the person that W believe but it could be be it could be somebody a normal person that's is why brother says we have to be balanced the people like really fundamental they think being that fundamental that one that's wrong there people they're not fundamental they're very extremist they think by trying to be extrem that will save them no God saw us so who will really believe he saw who will give himself to God all his he saw that who will just come to impis as is God he so INF he knows everything every thought every project everything he knows and when he saw everything he saw in that brother he loves God he he know he doesn't question that sister the same and then and he said that person since the foundation of the world I won't mind about his I know because when he does that he will come back to repent and then he for ordained things amen amen and the great God Of Heaven who loves us so much and he came and took our place to die at the cross that's why he chose Jacob and he hated when you see he looks correct a good brother if the pastor sees the TR have somebody to trust in the church this a good sister he respect his H her husband works but in his heart he didn't have any desire of God he didn't have any desire to come to surrender to God the other one maybe sometime you always fall sometime I come God help me God I want to try I want but when God sees the desire God say I will help you do you know God didn't come for only the Saints the holy God came to seek people that cannot save themselves another part when God came for the Sinners he didn't come for them not to stay Sinners amen amen God came for the Sinners he came for me Sinners so that I cannot be sin anymore Save Me by his grace because I've done something it's not because I'm good no amen amen may God help us says he saw you he know that you wanted to be saved so he said the only thing I can do is to go down myself and have a son born or a body of Flesh and be be made like them oh that say God himself he became sin so that he may pay the price because he will take the highest thing there is to lift the man from The Lost condition the the highest place he was he came down just trying to find how and God who loves us with such a love he did that for us to save others right amen amen may God help us let me read maybe the last thing same preaching paragraph 4 the LA having a shadow that can make uh of things to come the having a Shad it's not the exact image of things the image of things it was just a shadow of theage what will happening in the whole test was that's why took the over the world in the Golden Age of Israel what was he the shadow let me skip few things we see here and we see the shadow men and wom who profess to be Christian and live like the world they said oh I belong to church what difference does it make a Shad of the dece from the garden of heden who pretended to be good who pretended to have light who pretended to have wisdom was a Deceiver that's the way men and women does today amen am let let us not be wise on our eyes let count on the mercy of God do not crucify someone just because he did something wrong amen amen because youself you have a lot of mistake that but if you confess God look at you he says you never do the same thing for your brother do the same thing for your sister give him that Grace so that he could be saved that's why men and women does those that call upon the name of Jesus Christ and doesn't depart from sin that's what they do for shadowing the punishment that they will receive with Jesus said to the religious phares you are of your father the devil I hope that you understand this I hope that that sink wild in you amen amen the shadow of Deceit then what does the real real 100% Christian that's born again of the spirit of God whose name was written the Lamb's Book life before the foundation of the world who let it come they hold to the God's unchanging hands why is it this in their hearts for those that say the Bible PL confess that they Testify the testimony the life and they seek the city who build and the maker is God amen amen God help us to be really Christian and the first thing that shows that you're really Christian is the love of God if that love is not found in you even if you raise up dead that has nothing to do with it even if you can do whatever Pastor read the scripture your life worthy of the the gospel the only way to know if you have it if you you you have to agree with every word of God and to punctuate it with a amen and to love your enemies with all your heart just be careful we can say Amen Let It Be careful your enemies brother if God is in your heart he's not in your heart you cannot do it but we living in the age of love how can you find people that can eat the Lord's Supper why we call each other brother and sister that we brothers related we have same father amen amen we have the same father that's why that's my brother that's my sister but you see just a little problem that Happ even for no reason that I'm not going to talk to this person anymore what happened to you I never talk to that brother for what reason yes sir but but he claim that he has the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what is that hunger in your heart this morning to stand in this presence what is that hanger in your heart to reaching out your hands with everything that is in your life is crying for something so you say I don't care what comes oh God something in you looking over the walls and the tears run down of your heart in your heart when something burning that that in your heart you're good say brother lost brother see the woman in the degraded demoralized way and you see men drinking smoking cursing because there are people that curse gambling by still going to church that's why in Church everybody is Holy we believe every here in the church everybody our home there our work that's where we have to see if you really holy your wife has to understand that my husband has the Holy Ghost the husband has to know that my wife right there it doesn't work I don't know how God what God will say what burns what cries out in your heart my lost Wayward brother stubborn brother you have took something up you have been connected ConEd with the other hand of the line you touched the chain chain when your name was put there and seen by the great attribute strength of God's knowledge God look down and see that you come home but by the things of the world you have a conception when the Holy Ghost run down this chain of blood and that catches your heart it speaks about the better land the better land better place the better City you could say this world is not my home I'm just passing through Tre are laid up amen amen when the Holy Ghost Comes This is why it makes you say by you have you say you have the Holy Ghost but you always cling to the things of the world even if the speaks about against it you love it that you still coming just told us just a deceiving but you just getting ready for the punishment God doesn't want to punish you that's the reason why he's sending the word that is the reason why he died on the cross if you really go to to that's your own problem because has provided all the way so that you could not goell somebody can say Amen it's God speaking oh he says it's the shadow if the blood of bulls and goats and the Sheep if the high priest was the right order then the world would have continued death would have seized under that do you catch it let us talk just a minute if the offering of the animal will have perfect the man and give him the eternal life then there was no reason for anything else to take place amen amen because what was happening in the that wouldn't give life etal life would have S in and grown right on if it was the case there had to be a shadow of the real Lamb of God that was come was coming to take away the sin of the world which has been for spoke before by God today men and women that was forn by God before the foundation of the world their names were written in the Lamb's Book of the light if they shout all right are you listening if they don't all right if they do this all right if they don't all right for God has already spoken it has to come to pass it's not him that will or him that run it's God that show Mercy God's choice not our wouldn't offer says what makes this service I feel like a little kid with a Christmas toy I'm just so happy about it I would like to give it to the church to you Believers to let you watch the truth if that was all right we will never we will never have seas God have Bond of perfection it's the love of God and that love of God when it comes in our hearts purifies us takes away the the desire of the world if in the Old Testament they will bring the lamb and the lamb was without BL God will agreed but the sin was not forgiven but today we have the Lord Jesus Christ the one who's perfect we can come by faith confessing our fault looking looking the calvary being sincere tell God lord I still have the desire I come to church I go to church every day but in me I feel like I'm still hypocrite I cannot keep on doing it you going to be brother will see thinking you're a good brother this pastor will see this is a good sister but in the Heart full of things of the world proud hatred stab you know the word doesn't want it but you still doing it why God has sent down his love if tonight every one of us can examine himself to be just sincere before God because brother say God really want to help us more than we want it he's ready he's more than able to remove that that able to give you the true experience of Amen New Birth and then you understand your if he makes mistak you will understand you won't judge your brother and you won't HTE your brother no no even Jesus when Peter denied him he never hated Peter he understood it was a human he just did it as a human know that one day God can if your brother did something even myself talk to the brother if you can't talk speak to the brother pray for if you pray for the brother with a good desire in Your Heart Lord maybe one day you visit this brother you visit that sister and you will change it may God fill our is the end of the year we don't want to cross the you know there's certain people their sin is before them but some of them the sin follow them I want my sin to be before so that I may repent myself if your desire may God fill you love of God God bless you thank you brother Bram did you enjoy it let us give the Lord a [Applause] hand uh he said uh just a very short exhortation but it was H very very deep and I believe each one who have
