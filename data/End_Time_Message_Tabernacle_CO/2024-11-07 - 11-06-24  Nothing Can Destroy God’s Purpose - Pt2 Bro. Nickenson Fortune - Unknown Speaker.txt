Jesus Christ to him be glory and honor amen [Music] amen we can take our Bibles we can take in Romans chapter 8 just take one verse [Music] verse 28 Roman Roman 8 28 amen and we know all we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose may God have the bless to the reading of his word you may be seated may God richly bless you I really feel good to be with you again tonight want to thank the pastor uh to give us the opportunity to take the word tonight bring the word to his church tonight it's a small subject nothing can destroy the purpose of God this is part two glory to God the word of God is a powerful source and this is the example of Noah it's paragraph 13 this example of Noah uh I know that my redeemer leaves paragraph 13 let's take example no way in the Bible the flood came and all the Earth was destroyed vegetation and everything was destroyed but Noah and the seed that he had taken into the ark God's purpose can never be defeated amen do you do you hear this God's purpose can never be defeated never amen there is nothing can't defeat it when we say nothing brother it's really nothing Let Let It Be of fire Let It Be Water let it be the present be the future nothing can defeat the purpose of God nothing can defeat him do you do you understand it brother and sister how we should be happy today when we abiding under this revelation of uh of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present amen no things that can come there's no sick sickness no sorrow no death no perils no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined is in mind God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there's no power there is nothing can ever separate God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said glory to God let's go paragraph 14 [Music] then we find that in the in that day that all of the world was going to be destroyed by a flood that God made the preparation I want to tell you God is a just God he's really even the sense of justice he isn't God cannot destroy the unjust and the just at the same time that's the reason why God always made a prep preparation to allow the just to be saved a preparation for what cause to preserve his purpose he did it in the days of Noah and he's doing it today amen he has made the preparation to conserve to his own purpose amen he will conserve a church he will and you are a part of that church he will conserve a people and tonight you are the people of God he will conserve subject for his great [Music] domain amen that death cannot destroy you are you are the the subject of God you are sub the subject of God if you can understand it before you were born here on Earth we were in God's thoughts God's mind as attributes for an attribute is a thought that it's not expressed and when God expressed it it becomes a word glory to God thank you Lord God has a purpose for all of us and the purpose of God for us all the power of hell can speak against but they would not be able to Prevail amen all the power of hell oh they can come against the purpose of God that will never Prevail amen because God is powerful God is more powerful glory to God the uh the purpose of God there's somewhere the ability to see the purpose of God it's God himself amen it's the purpose of God to really take care of it so that nothing can Destro the reason why we are that nothing can destroy the purpose of God it doesn't depend on me amen it doesn't depend on you yes sir if you will fail or not it depends on God himself God will take care of his purpose nothing can defeat it to the purpose of God glory to God thanks God has the purpose of the three Hebrews to God what was the purpose of God for the three Hebrews uh chapter paragraph 16 now we will think also today upon destruction trying to destroy we have cross on promise we think of the Hebrew children when God had a purpose for them when they were down in Babylon and the F was had seven times harder than he ever was e to destroy the purpose of God and all Babylon was on rage they were determined Satan was to destroy the purpose of God oh we fire brother and sisters for he knew those children was going into the furnace Satan knew it then [Music] he made the furnace when they HED it seven times harder to be sure that the program of God will be destroyed oh what was God's purpose what was the purpose of God for the three children oh listen very carefully my brothers let's listen to the the prophet but God wanted to display his power amen do you understand it yes when were throwing those three Hebrews in the furnace it's not because Satan was more powerful because God has a purpose God wanted to display his power amen glory to God thank you Lord thank you God oh His Marvelous worthy to be praised and so he made sure the furnace was he up seven times harder to be sure that the pray of God will be destroyed but God wanted to display his power and all babon and all hell Hallelujah do not defeat that purpose amen no no matter if they could hit it that furnace a million times God he will never destroy the purpose of God glory to God yes sir God is more powerful God wanted to show God to manifest to show display his power glory to God oh God is worthy tothy to our God wanted to show there was the god of Deliverance yes yes sir and it bring Deliverance to wh whever it desire to bring it and and nothing will interfere with his program yes sir glory to God thank you Lord yes my brother and sisters if there's something happening in your life it's not because Satan is more powerful than God but God has a purpose for you let me take an example for you as Christians as believer of this gospel when we pray ask something from The Lord Oh Lord give me a support Spirit a spirit where I can support when you're asking God to give you that kind of Spirit uh if I can say or not otherwise you asking God to send you trials sometime you don't understand it but this is what you're asking how are you going to have patience if you don't have things to Bear you asking God you asking God to give you a spirit to support things or to bear things but when trial comes and then you start to uh to complain when you asking God to give you the spirit to bear things otherwise you asking God to give you trials to send you trials is it clear everybody was talking the seven Church edges we know that we're going to re we're not going to rain in heaven we're going to rain here on Earth yes sir because heaven is not our jic our jurisic is the earth amen is C certainly we go to heaven we're going to spend three uh three and a half years it's a time it's only three years and a half but our our our dwelling it's the Earth am glory to God thank you Lord nothing can defeat the purpose of God let me tell you something with the story of Joshua glory to God uh paragraph 40 [Music] same paragraph 40 yes now listen said it's God who speaking to J he say I will send you a sign there be a pill of fire will lead you all the way you amen just follow it it will take you that's right and they go right up there amen and the pillar of Fire into be a man oh that P has the capacity he has the ability to transform himself to become a man Hallelujah because they had an obstacle in front of Joshua and Joshua was on the way of Duty and God knew the time it's the time the minut and the time was supposed to display and the pill of fire turned into be a man yes sir God was used to talk to Joshua when they reached to Jericho Joshua saw a man that was a pillar of fire that turned into be man Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that happened in our time with the experience of brother in 1946 he saw a man he was there bare the bit of fire has the capacity to show that and God can do anything that's the reason my brother and sisters in this time that we live in here oh we are so privileged amen glory to God Amen thank you Lord when Joshua saw it he saw a man but it was a man that was speaking who was speaking to him amen and he asked a question to that man and he said to Joshua I'm the captain of the host of the Lord he said we've come this far now why let's go on with the people yes amen now there was all that great land before them all military men and now the captain of the host of the Lord he was a military man too oh God is a military man yes sir he is real it's not a it's a reality yes glory to God thank you Lord you are well taught in the time that I'm speaking to you God is in heaven but when you say God is in heaven it's the physical body of Jesus Christ but you have to understand it not at the time at the exact time I'm talking to you now God is on the earth as well but is in the form of the Holy Spirit of the P of fire I can even say Jesus is on the earth the P of fire amen thank you Lord God is worthy worthy of all worship and amen glory to God God was coming down to to to talk to Joshua he said he talked to Joshua he said now Joshua don't fear I will be with you and nothing will stand in front of you though you'll be alive jhua said oh what word it is my brother after hearing those words and Joshua said now we're going to see what the land looks like amen oh we're going to see what the land looks like because the wall of Jericho was in front of them they couldn't go above it that's the reason why oh in front of that obstacle God came down and became a man oh to take the control of that battle that's what God does in your life there's a lot of things that happen that comes in your life God comes himself to take control of trouble of that sickness glory to God thank you Lord Joshua had two uh spies and they went to over the land and when they reached the land RAB The Prostitute hide them all night amen glory to God I want to highlight something my brothers and sisters har the har was raising a good something happened in that family and RAB was really beautiful and she became a prostitute to take care of his of her parent and I'm uh I'm supposed to tell it to God but RAB had a seat she had a SE that's why you believe the message you don't have to or you don't have to Bel people other people the RAB went to prostitution while she was a seed the true seed of God glory to God and then she went and HD the the spice and asked them to give her something as sign says the house of RAB was over the walls glory to God thank you Lord oh the purpose of God cannot be defeated Raab it had the um and then he used that that thing to actually take the spice down and josua asked the children of Israel to go around seven times six times and the seventh time he asked them to do seven times the walls Amen in this message stand still brother really bring a Precision here I love the Precision here after going around the seventh time they were sounding the trumpet after they they Stood Still what said it wasn't the sound of the instrument that made the Wall fall but it was God Amen it's God himself God respect his word nothing can Destro to God's purpose the Wall fall down and the house of herab was up up up up in the the [Music] walls a little part of the wall where the house of was not Fallen because she applied the sign and that's what you need to do today you have to have a sign to apply the sign the sign as the boms of the holy spirit amen glory to God you have to apply the sign that's what's essential today glory to God thank you Lord Lord is a wory glory I want to highlight something also to give you some quotations uh regarding Jonas I told you that Jonas was under God's will as a preacher I cannot say something if the prophet didn't say you can verify and take notes it's unbelief sin of unbelief preaching 1958 57 uh 89 uh we not going to read it this those are just references that I'm giving and then uh the queen I was preaching 19 Queen of Sheba it was Queen of the South 31 to 41 and now now see Jonas many people think that Jonah was a horrible man Jonah was a prophet of God he was working under God's will amen you will say why did he do what he did he didn't do anything that was contrary to God's will if you are in Christ [Music] amen do contrary if you're walking humbly and upright it may seem like you do but you don't do it nothing happens providential amen the footsteps of the right is order of the Lord and all things work together for the good that love him glory to God and you say oh Lord and He took that ship and went to tarus instead of n when God sent him to and he went to Tes let's just look at it in a few minutes to find out it's the way you look at it you run over the top of them and say oh you were Jonah someone who doesn't obey God's word say i' like to be one certainly he was a man of God yes sir glory to God but was trying to notice uh paragraph 29 Jonah was under God's will notice when he went to go to n there was no sheep so he took a ship to T when he got on the sea the sea got angry because the preacher was backsliding and tie his feet and hands and threw him out of the ship and God had a big fish to swallow him glory to God now this fish God prepare it he prepared oh my goodness he prepared his own servant as food oh God prepare his own servant as a food for that F if God who did it God has an objective and he went to the the ship and T him in the whale's mouth and he went down to the bottom of the sea with his hand behind it him tied and feet tied he was tight glory to God oh thank you Lord oh Jonah had many symptoms I've often wonder how the people in this day and time will ever look at their symptoms and read that story oh my don't look at your brother and sister but take God his word am glory to God it's like Abraham would call things as it was he took God at his word believing that he would be able to fulfill what he promised that's why I want to talk about the church today the problem with the church we coming with hope instead of faith faith is sure Faith doesn't need something uh something to booster Faith knows what it's talking about faith is strong amen faith has hairs on the chest when he speaks and the rest of them shut up yes sir symptom can't even speak at all when real Godly Faith speaks it's God the flow amen glory to God thank you Lord yes brother and sister now was in the well belly of that belly there were a lot of vomits everywhere but he didn't pay attention to all those vomits amen and the whale swallowed them and when they got to n he actually spit that whale I want to say something something here and to now we can ask how this well swallow why does the well spit Jonah there towards the [Music] um God was doing something you can read it in this quot it's in the Queen of Sheba it 1960 710 44 and 45 GL to God said everything my brother how that happened you know you know what happened oh God brought sickness to the belly well it's God who was doing it yes sir that didn't happen just orinary God had a purpose yes and nothing can defeat that purpose the purpose of God Jonah was supposed to go to n certainly the whale went there but it was God who was working and God made very sick in the then it spit him to the amen why because Jonah in the wells belly he was making amen remembering Solomon's word if God in those kind of circumstan when he looked towards the temple that a man built a temple where a man prayed a temple when they had the holy Place how come God will also do it [Music] today and when we take our minds away from and from this and cancer of our tumor any sickness or sin let's look at the Throne of God Jesus sitting at the right side of God with the Lord Jesus Christ brother and sister oh he is the high priest of our confession if you need something you have to tell God and God will do something glory to God thank you Lord oh the God is to Glory let me ask you something glory to God if I ask you this question do you want to be sick or certain to be sick do you want to be sick tonight or you want Satan to be sick let me ask let me tell you something if you want sick to be sick tonight there's something that you need to do let's listen to what the prophet says glory to God you have to forget your symptoms while you looking at your hands if your hand is sick and you say oh it's broken it will always be that way if you say it I refuse to look at it that way I'm looking towards the temple and the prophet saying I assure you something will become sick Satan will become sick if you look at God am your sickness will and Satan will become sick what are you going to choose tonight are you going to look at God are you going to take his word The God Who heal all your oh the pray just as a if you feel don't look at your sickness oh look at Jesus Christ look at the blood of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the high priest tonight do you understand the brother and sister glory to God oh thank you Lord oh God is worthy of all glory it's worthy of all Praises amen glory to God is talking again about Jonah saying it was God's will Lord Jesus in Matthew 12 referred to Jonah glory to God because that people asked for a sign while the Messi Messiah sin was there manifested in front of them glory to God and God referred to Jonah and was saying that Jonah supposed to be someone to talk about Resurrection it was God's plan and that happen again today one scripture can have two side of application or app voice it's the same thing that repeats itself says you don't have to forget that in ninev the people there they will worship animals paragraph 75 and people started worshiping animals and that's what they worship animal an I see those kind of dogs and everywhere and they practicing birth control and D has CAU America and you don't see brother and sister everywhere they take all the dogs like babies glory to God what said that's the same spirit that was manifested in ninev and in our time God gave them the same sign the sign of Resurrection glory to God the sign of Resurrection is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday fulfilling all the Miracles fulfilling all the things amen God has a purpose for his church is to bring his church Perfection and nothing can defeat it my brothers let me tell you something as children of God because the Covenant that God before God has a covenant with ad it was a conditional Covenant and after God had a covenant with Abraham it was an Abraham it was an unconditional Covenant it's a powerful word but you cannot do anything my brothers and sisters to be lost amen God is God God will do everything to save you yes sir that's the reason why when you refuse to walk in the right direction you will always be miserable because God he will do everything to save you it's an unconditional Covenant yes sir it's very powerful but it's the truth that's the reason why to be sure to be in the truth in the right way because God cannot lose you oh let's take the example of theal son there a message prodal son good when he was living with his parents and then he was actually uh eating with all those animals he decided to go back to his place we have a prophet brother said it didn't just happen that way just ordinary you can you can verify that in the message said the father and the mother of the prodal son they were praying constantly for the their son and sometime God sent an angel brother Braham said it was an angel who was giving those advice you can verify that in that message it was an angel that God sent and the angel told that don't don't stay in that kind of your your father and mother are waiting for you it's actually to go back and your par that's the reason why you saw that the prodal son got that decision because it was God's God cannot lose he will do something to bring him back to the right way yes sir nothing can hinder you oh hinder God's plan amen thank you Lord I'm going to take two example again and the Apostle John who wrote the [Music] Revelation you can look at Revelation 4 God has a purpose God had a plan according to God's purpose according to God's purpose he wanted to give us the Book of Revelation to God in that time there a lot of persecution and John was the pastor of that church glory to God when a Time came of God to give us the Book of Revelation in God's plan in order to get that book of ration the time or the place that God God chose was the island of pmos oh God is really unusual the island of pmos criminal it was a island where they were sending all those people people who were against uh uh who were in trouble with the law in that zone or that place they had so many kind of snakes they had crocodiles it was not a good place to live but in God's plan according to God's purpose to give us the Book of Revelation it was that place God is really unusual nothing can defeat brother and sister if you don't understand you even see that Satan is not even the because God is more powerful for God to go and fulfill his plan John was there he was the pastor of the church God did something one day they had a lot of persecution they were uh killing Christians they took Dr and they put him in a they put him in somewhere and they put oil and they put John inside and it was 24 hours nothing happened when he was inside Satan thought that he was destroyed destroy god with fire but says you have to see the oil John the the prophet of God he had the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is fire fire cannot destroy fire and contrary the fire inside it was who created the natural fire do you see that but it was God's plan God an he was to give us the Book of Revelation while don't see these things and then they they labeled John they labeled John as a witch and they took him and they put him in the island of Patmos and he spent two years over there in 85 95 after Jesus two years where there were crocodiles where they had some bad snakes you can say what happened while John was under God's it was God's plan for him to be there according to God's plan John was supposed to be there to receive the Revelation so that we can have today the Book of Revelation nothing defeated defeat God's plan yes sir amen says because they had trou and joh was every single time they trou there's a a brother or sister who was going to and to to fight and God to put some to give him that ration he took John and put him somewhere nothing can destroy nothing can just happen God has a plan for you my brother God is more powerful glory to God after that bream says being there in the island God was spending marvelous times he spent marvelous times of his life in the presence of God Amen God wanted to show that he had Dominion under all those Beast God wanted to show Power amen yes sir and brothers sisters after the two after those two years and God gave him the Book of Revelation and God brought him there and John started contined to Pastor his church and he died with a natural death nothing can destroy nothing can destroy oh to the Son of God to the sons of God brother and sisters God sent this Earth to fulfill something as soon as happen nothing can happen in your life nothing can happen in your life nothing is nothing Let It Be sickness or let it be this let it future even all the demons come together nothing can destroy God's they cannot take your life before God before you have something to do because God is the one powerful he's more powerful yes sir if God let something happen your life it's for your good it's to form your character in theic says we come naked in this world nothing but God doesn't want us to go back you said brother I heard that we're going go back naked certainly we came naked but God want to do something God want to model he is the B God want to make us or to bring and form something in us a character and the same feeling that was in Jesus Christ the character in when we go to heaven there not any it's not because I'm a preacher that they're going to open the the Gat of Heaven because I'm preaching the gospel it's automatic that character that needs to be inside of me if that character is inside of when you come the Gates of Heaven will open it's not because you're white it's not because because you been longer in this message years is to have God inside of you yes sir that's the character yes sir that's what you need tonight a true character but I have to tell you brother and sisters was say in seven Church ages God power without character is nothing yes sir Hallelujah you need something it's that character it's not something that you make up but it's a reality the character of Jesus Christ that's the reason why God send those Tri oh those are Gods my brothers let's take an example if you take Ane oh you can look at the orange you say give me ju no there's only one possibility you have to take that orange and then you have to press when God allow to happen in your life it's god ising making you inside of your character yes sir praise God if you understand my brother and sister sometimes we speak second language say oh it's Satan it's not sat it's goding it's God who's doing something God want to do something God has a purpose for you and the objective that he has for you he had the to give you God has a and that is the the Wilderness when he found J it's not somewhere where you have everything there's not another place there's not another possibility to your character is to suffer you are you have a lot of you have you have God can reflect the character that's what God wants for you that's what that's my brother glory to God oh God is all glory and all Praises God had a purpose for his servant David he was calling a servant there are things that happening in your life those are training for you amen God knows the end before the beginning yes sir now you come to church it's not for nothing my brother it's the serious stuff that you can do because we have an enemy to conquer the last battle the last battle it's with theism it's not going to be easy you have to have something the one inside of you Hallelujah it's not just when you come to church that you have to pray you have to pray a home as well because we have a true enemy in front of us is a true enemy real this message is not a it's a serious things that we have this Earth that's the reason why God Is tring Us is sending a way that Our Roots can there's not another way because there's a storm coming there's a storm coming oh there's a coming God has an objective let me just say this God is great nothing is impossible to God Amen brother and sisters oh the a man cannot live by bread alone every word that comes out of the mouth of the Lord God is asking me God is asking you to give him the tie to give him not to the pastor it's God G to the pastor but God is asking to pay to him not to the pastor God is giving it to the pastor what God God is giving us 100 he just giving he's asking us 10 out of the 100 that he giving us it's God was giving us the money and gold belongs to God God is giving us 100 he's asking you for 10 and then you don't want to give God 10 but let me tell you something there's only one possibility in the Bible from Genesis ration to be blessed materially it's to pay your time it's the word of God but all the way that come the if you see the pastor maybe you won't pay it but God is asking for him and is giving it to the pastor what am I saying here God doesn't need your money God has everything but he want to test your obedience Hallelujah yes sir before rer the Son of God has to be manifested before the rapture God showed it in the house of the the weer in when Elijah came and talked to the widow woman and ask him to to find to make a cake for him what says he only had she only had few uh for for oil as well just to make a little but the prophet asked her first and the Widow came and took all the and make the cake and bring the water to the prophet and the prophet sit there and drink and eat that that means in the house there were no flow they had no oil anymore do you understand they didn't have any flour no oil either but it's God who went and work with wom because it was not ordinary things in that kind of family a man who comes and ask you everything that you have and he eats it and he sit down and he asked the woman he said go and prepare for you and your son naturally Hallelujah if you think about it you say with what am I going to cook there's no more flour there's no more oil but God work with the woman that's what God is he's working with you to go in the to go in his presence yes sir because God work with that woman oh that woman gave the back to go prepare the cake for her and the without oil without hallu she hallelujah hallelujah praise God am said the Lord praise God yes sir yes sir what am I saying I'm asking you to pay your ti when the council there will be manifested you won't have anything you won't have anything to eat nothing to drink but God will continue Hallelujah continue to feed you if you need food you're going to pronounce the word and God will rep because that woman receive Hallelujah we receive will God cannot fail you have to be encouraged encouraging the Lord let me finish with David's story Hallelujah God was training David God allow Allon to come and take one of his sheep away with that sheep David had a lot of Courage David didn't really be uh see his abilities he was really small he was really small but he had courage hallelujah oh take courage of Faith he took his sling and went after took that ship away from The Lion and then and killed the lion and God sent a bear go David did the same thing let me tell you something tonight Hallelujah that happened when Goliath was there let me highlight something for you when David was supposed to fight [Music] go God trained David yes sir but God is unusual if you see the way the event came we can say two three and then if you go the other way you're going to go three and then two my brothers and sisters it was very difficult to kill a lion than to kill Goliath was very difficult to kill a lion than Goliath God was training David Hallelujah yes maybe if Goliath saw a he could have ran yes sir brother and sisters it's God was working yes sir it's God was training you that c is coming you have to stay in prayer you have to stay in meditation God cannot fail nothing can defeat God's plan it used to be it was a time of sacrifice and they killed many Christians when po heard that were trying to kill po came himself to go so that he can be killed but in the time that we're living in it's not a time where you can sacrifice yourself it's the time of the eagle Satan thought he would do the same for us but we have wings to fly brothers and sisters you have to prepare yourself brother and sister you have to spread your wings you have to train it's nothing else with the all the new you have to look at the promise of God what am I saying I was saying just few minutes ago it was tough to kill a lion than Goliath but was saying when you have faith to believe that God has saved you and you can't believe in healing you have to have more faith to be saved then for healing it's more greater yes sir to believe in God to obey to his word God cannot fail you have to stay in prayer you have to stay in
