[41:15] amen
[41:16] uh
[41:20] the exhortation of tonight
[41:24] plasma is
[41:26] truly I don't know how to entitle it
[41:35] but these two scripture was in my heart
[41:40] [Music]
[41:43] depression since Brother Richard was
[41:45] preaching the pastora president and the
[41:49] past to preach is
[41:52] and especially the scripture of Matthew
[41:59] he kept bubbling in my heart so I
[42:02] thought it caught my thoughts
[42:08] I try to speak what does he mean what
[42:11] brother Branham said about it
[42:15] and when the pastor asked me to preach
[42:24] something else
[42:31] but that kept on inspiring me bubbling
[42:35] in my heart
[42:38] while I was meditating I was seeing
[42:41] scriptures men are realities
[42:46] in reality I didn't know how to entangle
[42:50] the preaching of tonight
[42:52] we're just going to commit ourselves to
[42:55] God yeah
[42:57] may God knows our needs our souls amen
[43:04] Jesus Took the word
[43:07] foreign
[43:39] with them
[43:50] they were always seeking a mistake
[43:55] to find a way to accuse Jesus
[44:00] see Jesus was the word of that time
[44:03] the way he was preaching is
[44:18] that word was making them uncomfortable
[44:23] every time when the true words
[44:27] always brings people
[44:38] it always
[44:41] where the true word is coming from
[44:49] and the phrases
[44:56] Jesus look at
[45:24] the Baptist
[45:39] [Music]
[45:50] if you can read it again that would be
[45:53] good
[45:57] verse 14.
[45:59] the distribution
[46:02] then came to him the disciple of John
[46:05] saying
[46:10] why do we end the first is the first of
[46:13] all but that is type of first not
[46:22] can the children of the bread chamber
[46:25] Moon as long as the bridegroom is with
[46:28] them
[46:29] but the days will come when the bread
[46:32] room will be taken
[46:34] and then shall they fast second
[46:38] question that's how with this question
[46:44] now Jesus is keep on keep on answering
[46:47] them yes
[46:52] [Music]
[47:00] which is in
[47:03] the garden
[47:04] and the rent is
[47:09] Divine nouveau
[47:11] neither do men put new wine
[47:20] the barrels will break
[47:25] [Music]
[47:32] they put new wine
[47:35] into new barrels
[47:38] both are preserved
[48:02] but for the elect
[48:04] yes
[48:08] Jesus was able to explain to them what
[48:11] he meant
[48:13] sometimes this Bible is
[48:18] [Music]
[48:25] written amen
[48:28] now we know in the Bible
[48:32] they're all in the wine goes along
[48:38] pay attention to for just few minutes
[48:49] with the message of faith
[48:54] without faith you cannot receive
[48:56] anything from God
[48:57] [Music]
[48:59] as in Ephesians
[49:04] foreign
[49:54] [Music]
[50:18] getting into perfection
[50:42] because God cannot fail
[50:44] Jesus
[51:16] [Music]
[51:23] by saying that
[51:25] foreign
[51:31] uh
[51:40] they're just like a vessel
[51:44] in the old times
[51:47] you know today we have this type of
[51:50] bottles
[51:51] the science says
[52:00] water and all the liquid you can put it
[52:03] even in the little bottles
[52:06] but at all times
[52:32] they look like
[52:35] because if you understand how they look
[52:38] like foreign
[54:04] [Music]
[54:18] blow up
[54:30] [Music]
[54:43] [Music]
[54:52] you
[54:56] [Music]
[54:57] see somebody walking
[55:00] funny
[55:02] [Music]
[55:05] because it took a little bit of wine
[55:11] it's different from a normal person
[55:16] you notice the effects of wine
[55:21] it becomes the crisis
[55:35] foreign
[55:49] [Music]
[56:18] [Music]
[56:41] you don't control yourself
[57:23] [Music]
[57:36] [Music]
[57:39] there has to be something happening in
[57:42] the house
[57:57] [Music]
[58:08] the Holy Ghost is living
[58:19] let us go see
[58:24] when people came it is
[58:30] [Music]
[58:42] why are they like drunk
[58:53] [Music]
[59:01] they are not drunk as you think man but
[59:05] it is
[59:08] [Music]
[59:21] [Music]
[59:55] [Music]
[1:00:09] think real things
[1:00:16] we became so mechanical
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:40] Peter preach 50 50 seconds
[1:01:13] we crucify ourselves
[1:01:17] what shall we do yeah
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:23] each one of you
[1:01:27] for the forgiveness
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:31] wine
[1:01:35] Carlos sentence
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:56] and Jesus by saying that he wanted to
[1:02:00] say yes
[1:02:07] it's when the the skin is fresh
[1:02:12] their skin has oil
[1:02:16] made that that skin has oil and guns and
[1:02:22] when the oil
[1:02:24] when you pull out the new wine fella not
[1:02:28] the old wine
[1:02:30] because the new wine salazi has life
[1:02:34] within foreign
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:48] you cannot lose
[1:03:51] foreign
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:37] the
[1:04:50] you need something that is
[1:04:57] there you pour into it then
[1:05:05] will blow up
[1:05:09] and you lose
[1:05:12] the wine and the bottle
[1:05:15] explication that's why Jesus wanted to
[1:05:18] explain it
[1:05:20] let's see the the spiritual application
[1:05:23] of it is
[1:05:36] conservation
[1:05:40] why some people cannot conserve the life
[1:06:04] when I was reading it I said to myself
[1:06:07] why Jesus spoke in its way
[1:06:12] Prophet but I thank God for the prophet
[1:06:17] there's nothing in the Bible
[1:06:20] or Prophet that God did not reveal to
[1:06:23] the prophet
[1:06:26] I love it
[1:06:29] because we're preaching from an open
[1:06:31] book
[1:06:38] it's a lot about practice that uh
[1:06:43] Western people
[1:06:47] cannot keep the victory
[1:06:50] 30
[1:07:03] foreign
[1:07:28] foreign
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:08:03] it is
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:14] we only have glass bar
[1:08:17] queles
[1:08:20] it doesn't make any difference
[1:08:24] but when I visit the Eastern countries
[1:08:37] what Jesus was talking about
[1:08:45] how I don't look like
[1:08:48] in fact nowadays
[1:08:52] we only have a glass of bottles
[1:08:56] but when I visit the Eastern
[1:08:58] Street
[1:09:01] I found out that the water bottles of
[1:09:04] that day was made of of animal skin and
[1:09:08] then
[1:09:09] fresh and when the animal skin was fresh
[1:09:14] and the new skin
[1:09:16] cells and when it got older
[1:09:21] said
[1:09:23] and to take new non-fermented and
[1:09:27] fermented
[1:09:32] yet
[1:09:35] we had the dream of life in it
[1:09:40] when it begins to fermented
[1:09:50] produce there was an explosion
[1:09:58] wonders
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:11:03] [Music]

[1:12:00] and the best
[1:12:01] it can stretch
[1:12:05] app
[1:12:07] and when you begin to preach the party
[1:12:10] the love of God
[1:12:12] healing
[1:12:14] signs and wonders
[1:12:18] when the Bible says
[1:12:26] amen amen
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:51] it's conceived not to receive the full
[1:12:54] word of God basket because
[1:13:02] you bear with the fermentation of the
[1:13:05] world
[1:13:07] but the one who has the new skin
[1:13:11] when they preacher
[1:13:14] or when they put the words
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:28] foreign
