pair because this is where the great unknown thing begins solarium hormones because David the father of Solomon David Lee Petaluma and was a such a person who understood this great burden have accomplished a confounder when you're reading the book of psalm accomplished gonna leave a tip-- zone it was such a man who set and prayed for his son it's a channel keep people some visa and when Solomon is turned econ only to the saloon he started also praying for his son with cripples Anfisa you understand that even got himself compromising on women I started saying they teach these things

Bible because God Himself came and taught that to his son Moses it is a policy choice on Christmas and the son could do nothing except Eocene first done by the fire responsibility and when the father every father can see the pattern of a good father in the Bible a common lineage the only people then it can also have his son also learn the same thing so you can also give it to the museum every man

they can also be grateful unto the father's that mechanism Devon repair because the Bible says why son my son emphasized arif defy his father's instruction because the father didn't make it up you are saying it from the father and the father is the heavenly father you know silicon celeste and jesus prayed let thy will be done on earth as it is in the power preset accomplish yet the son can see the father receiving instruction from the Heavenly Father and surely know that this is a great blessing compensation company that if father doesn't just make up stuff to come and tell them therefore the

Bible also that people that's the pardon of the Bible because the Bible says my son forget not my law because the father has become the same word remember God is spoken with ya but let dine honey P

things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience say I call this a shows kala kala the Dragons will epistolary be neon you see there is a promise of a compromise and is also an attraction alien attracts you to block you from attaining this revelation we need a villain in the which you also worked some time when you lived in them palak album RC auto follows Cuvier don't appreciate you understand that these are the word of a profit company because only problem prophet and the Prophet is speaking the profit to power he doesn't necessarily mean that he was with you him when you were doing these things could the professor shows but the Spirit of the Lord on him opens up these things so it can help you to be able to attain the level where it's easy way group which are people could appreciate but now he also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth momenta no no no see a Tuesday shows a lot cooler al animosity animation style a colony or parole Ethernet keep per head so to the voter Bush Bush this is the profit absolute perfect oh this is a preacher a one-column predicate or this man photography is following the Ministry of Allah Jerry profit and the son of man you see that in the Bible wait on a bit he's speaking to the Colossians and when you go I love caboodle Sunday of verse nine he say light not to one another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds deep yet he's watching this church this church was supposed to attain unto the heavenly things but this church now they are finding couple of these things in them may not agree to certain decisions and I have put on the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created him kisses or novella Darla connaissance anonymous key to seduce relax al and this man is created after a certain image in its opinion Marge and the other man the old man is also a certain type of deeds many know that the serpent was also in men comments of Colusa potatoes ya know the old serpent with this opened had the lying mouth it came into the Garden of Eden start lying to Eve after lying to Eve brought all the chaos that we have today and started a new civilization Ephesians 4:24 if isn't cut for 24 cut one cut you're going to see Valley Walker that the sermon critical that this preacher is preaching is not reaching that only unto the collusion in predication Coliseum but he's preaching it to the entire to the entire believe body of the believers and that you put on the new man I think we should have it children of a long wish after God is created in righteousness and true holiness there's some sermon it preaches a to the collection aluminum finish Okaloosa it preaches a to the key decision it's all these two churches they call themselves that they've believed the son of man you don't profess the law they believed that the glory of God has been revealed in the last day working like what did you take a village and they were looking unto the appearing of the law amen amen maybe a lot less to consider I'm going to take a title today God's plan for this last God God's plan for this last age I'll only plonk the jacuzzi only ouch and for subject God's new creation under the fo'c'sle because you understand that that any man can come on the pulpit and preach a sermon because they have access to the material because the material the lacunae source has been has been made available to all but to under to come to the understand lip whereof a pompom what is the mystery the Koala mr. hidden in the material it requires a demand the author of the book to come back around pick up the material makes sense because Jesus was such a man he received it from the fan after receiving the word from the fund he went and preached it to the public in a party pushes looping and the public couldn't understand and when he came into the tent with they decided be is now required desire to know what web does things mind and then he explained them to them more clearly understand that when a sermon comes forth on a public level when you go public monthly or on the edge level won't go when you put the lies or the church level delivery not everybody will be able to understand and that's why if you pour quoi sometimes in the Bible you see people would say lives on your home this man also taught is that we have to eat his flesh and drink his blood that was a sermon that sit in protocol only public public more but in the internal place in their heart in the inner veil where the voice does sweet small voice was able to come and reveal and to give the interpretation of the things that the public saying even because you'll notice that on the mountain buzzkill this one time when he came down those questions with this one there II the the cloud of glory came down a linear to Bloody Sunday then there was thundering and those who desired not to be forgot to speak anymore then Moses has to come to take the same things in a wave in the poem and to give it to the people and you understand the company even though that was given to them in the form of tips and books puree and bettan couldn't be abiding in the calling the COO they wanted to raise themselves above the stars of God it is started to withstand the prophet of God and you understand that it is the same pattern that we see in this last day that many people in this nation will also try to do the same thing when God by his own counsel yes establish a prophet some as preachers some as opposed to some as teachers and some with a certain level of a measure of faith to be able to estate to stand as the body of Jesus but you understand that the Prophet tells us so the Prophet that the devil will also bring something and so you can bring him into the house of the house of the Lord is not this building the house of the Lord is the 16 element that you are and in this mystery the devil will bring some people real is on agent to be able to take you it would drift you away from the parent or division gods therefore you understand that this has already happened in the Garden of Eden and what happened in the garden either one has shown up no standing up walking he Marsha and he started targeting in the kingdom of God who can I go to to bring also my new plan you understand that God had a plan but this one here also had his own plan and they wanted to bring it to pass and he looked in the entire kingdom who is the weakest vessel among them to be able to target him or to target her to bring destruction in the car God's plan then you see that's where all the civilization started because men was exposed to reasoning because that our sister didn't remain with the saying of the Lord she had the books and the tape but she couldn't abide by she had the appearance of it but she couldn't live according to the standard of them she started wandering into the land and seeing other things because she was fed up of all the preaching that pasta Adam was able to teach to her and we understand that when a believer comes to deliver and cannot be satisfied with the Lord given by the Prophet and started wandering in the land then we see that the next thing to come is the destruction and we understand also that every time a believer will be able to stand with the word will always be in overcome in all the state the trials all the situation in life then we understand that the Prophet was given unto Eve to be able to understand what kind of Kingdom that we live in they were under the shadow of the Almighty they were living in into the interlocked wings of the cherubim don't expect when she started going out then she found herself under a certain influence oh what a marvelous day we will say oh we come to the church this is another service we come to the this building we believe the message of because when they sit in a pushed her she said surely God said that got to eat this but then the revelation twisting of the word there couldn't follow the pattern of the open book of that base then brought her into a chaos and before she even knew it she thought she thought that if she could bring this revelation unto her pass then the pastor will also become God as it was promised to them unto the next but she didn't understand that what kind of malice was hidden in there because in every age you know shock the Lord of the dig the word of the Lord is brought forth at a point in the time of Moses we see load the load of bringing forth his paranoia luteum a new model bringing the same to Moses the only foreigner reproduce what you have seen in heaven as we've seen on earth as you have seen in on on heaven and Jesus a net that will be done in heaven therefore God will see a union again between Earth and heaven else the days were going back not everybody came to understand that what was God's great purpose to be able to stand a certain profit for the rest of your life and say Amen to every word that proceedeth out of the word of this Gruffalo Musa perfect but then you see no completely nominations that arising just as it happened in the garden started forming new revelation creating friends creating groups the group under the revelation of the process like as I said from Shelly correct and Dayton couldn't sit in there calling couldn't abide in the inner colleagues didn't go by we see that the children of God lives of the sons of God has become wonder with stars not knowing exactly what God has called them unto they wonder into the last year ago they were wandering to the right they don't know what kind of mysteries what can the element God God has given them feel kind of authority that got it given them therefore we see that God is ruies rich in mercy wanted to see is plentiful food regardless he sees the day go by then he understood it was necessary not just to speak about these things in the form of the pillar of fire in the form of the cloud of the glory but he had to come down in a self-defense sure how this thing has to be done it should be a faith Romans chapter 12 our main news I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice a sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed you understand that these people Mucca Mucca society has fallen from the glory of God God still sends down the Prophet you're what gotta come down in the form of a man who starts showing them the way out all the way back to Eden because remembering the Garden of Eden then try to go back into those other places but God it stopped the way in there for alone he said that the Indus dish that you are in you are not able to go back into that place but there is a time but there is a things that I have to fulfill in order to bring back this great revelation you say be not really but by transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is there what is that good the parable to the Jew and acceptable and perfect will of God because all my old men the Lord Jesus Christ sees that this is not the place that I have chosen for my son the men started living under a new civilization a civilization of science philosophy they have fallen from civilization of faith and the Lord desires for this to come back around so we understand that this old man has his own deeds but how did this man come about to fulfill this old plan they are complete the devil in right in Isaiah 14 is that you cut off the Bible say we can put it up here by the grace of God - Lukas OTC Paula Cassidy 14 14 in in in the in in Isaiah the the Bible shows us Israel a bit more that how the devil fell fell from heaven comical diabla it can be UCL and he had a plan Alabama and when he did in this plan of his don't stop law and he wanted to do something you've loved calculus he wanted to lift himself above the stars of God talked to June and when he was doing that then Isaiah 14:13 Fordow and said in thy heart come to this out talker I will ascend into heaven German Terrell's here he sees that this is the placement of the sons of God I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the nose I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High this is what his plan was from the very beginning when you started targeting the people in the church understanding the wit places of every man and he started looking into this place from those weaknesses is going to ascend is going to ascend and the place himself above the stars of God and the Bible says regardless of all that he has done yet he shall yet thou shalt be brought down to helmet to the size of the Peter before the day that CD shallow nearly look upon de Vega is considered a saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble he faced the cumulative and that did shake kingdom this men our longest journey he knew exactly what to do he went out as the first horse rider to overcome and it did overcome regardless of that glory be to God the Prophet sees the flood this God's plan he said that I'll let him do the work for a while but it's after the word is and shall be did the decides of the Peter shall be deep after of the offer of help Oh glory be to God but then we see we want to see a little bit more how does this man is able to bring the stars of God a common elicit what did you and that is feet under is domains under is influence because reading the book of Genesis we only see that he only spoke to him that I'll make a few God and if you eat from this and you'll do this but if the devil ever appears to any one of us here as it did to loser probably everyone will recognize it quickly yes then I cannot that's what he said there but then they chant therefore is not that stupid he knows that some of his truth has been displayed has been brought to reality and if it comes with the same language is going to split this comes with as he is going to be turned down but then it changes the foolish and the Bible in the Book of Daniel shows us that the mystery of this beast was destroying wonderfully to destroy wonderful and when people sit there and they worship the business destroying them wonderful videos more and yet they don't know it that's why the Lord looks at them and say no this year you are blind and naked wretched yet you don't know because this fellow has understood how to process and exactly comment upon three and Daniel looks at that plane say is destroying wonderfully because when Nebuchadnezzar saw the dream because it didn't see how the devil was destroying wonderful a bit on to the dreamers but then when the word of the Prophet came to danger then the prophet a debris had to come to come and explain to him the vision and understanding what are these things Daniel didn't see the fulfillment of he sees it reverse Allah that the things are to come Julie suburbs are complete and if Benny was a process those of his days where the dream and they didn't understand since they didn't understand it Daniel was the first process because they had a war writing of Moses say that if the Prophet gives the dream or gives the testimony or give a prophecy and it doesn't come to pass he's the first prophet but now here we see that the revelation given to Daniel was the revelation that has to last for many days who's a computer and we see a new way by this many every left the words of the prophet Daniel and because of their love the prophet Daniel and their friend himself in the snare of the enemy once again because in the days of Daniel I think that the division was at their dream was given to Nebuchadnezzar God has shown him how the kingdoms of the earth we rise and come to now in Sicily the handlebar but here we find now that it is of the age the time in which they were living in that people came to influence Nebuchadnezzar you are a king wrote you Wow look at this whole King it is your kingdom you can you just allow that boy from captivity that have to come and tell you that this kingdom will pass the way you did you know maybe canister works up the next day and builds a great statue it goes in glanced at you well in the dream I don't know that God has given him let your kingdom is the head of gold select it though but here a significant Easter from snows it builds a statue with the whole body of gold to look to look at such it mo to show Daniel Daniel you are wrong you have charcoal my kingdom will last forever that was you this is the influence under which people live in - they live as if there is there's not tomorrow as if they will live eternally I have my plan my life is not unloaded for 17 years I will do whatever work and then I would live forever and they have a song forever young because the illusion under which they are listening because the great things that they have been able to build it and they were able to build this day and this scene is and they see that there's no way there's no way for us to go to hell in there's no way for us to die we will live forever about people to you and they were forsaken the word of the king of prophet Daniel prophet Daniel and this was happening this is in the 68 week at any time at the end of the captivity in Babylon people were unconscious of God's program the program they were unconscious because whether they were unconscious of the wrath to come back 11 years and this is the time in which no can ever canister just enough to raise the statue that everyone had to come and worship of any are doing such the statue this is the time that job was made available to all because to build this great statute required labor in order to build this so to worship the statue we had to have musician's musician in order to him to worship the statue people had to learn how to play the musician upon commercially system oh and people were under the influence of the age but the rough to come luckily was that the door the king of the medians of the world and the presence was at the door teleport me the bells we are living in the day that the third wall collosseum demonium is at the doors and people under the influence that there is no dice there's no death thing about the market you look at the time in which relevant if you remember my sermon the mindset of the restored Church showed you the same parent to show you that the King Cyrus was raised up trying to come in free the people but here the influence of the people was to be blinded to be Richard this one misses to be naked but Daniel the prophet the Gentiles prophet had to come and give them the revelation to put off the old man and to put on the new man the group and to be able to go into the rapture but these people here under the influence they went unto the worship of the be celibate this is the time in which we are time that everybody opens the Bible oh but to find God's Word find God's program to find God's plan for the hour they couldn't find it that's why Daniel into prayer a party-pooper year went into prayer when he understood by the Book of Jeremiah prophet that this was going to happen the end of 7 years when william branham pick up the Bible and understood the time in which you are living in that went bald the Prophet spoken about the coming of the Lord he said that the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with a voice with a trumpet and after this we shall see the falling away and in-betweener in the twinkling of an eye those that are sleeping shall we shall not prevent them all but we shall all be gathered unto the Lord when this revelation is taking place some people are blind in the ODC Bible Paran Pardo Moodle the pattern of the open book everywhere you open it brings up - purpose one goal one purpose that God has was head in the back part of his mind to bring it down in the form of Jesus Christ as the sacrificing lamb and then to bring it in the form of his bride in this lesson in Ephesus in Smyrna in a detail the programís they terror to Sardis Philadelphia and in this last and we are living in the days after william branham has come and gone and here we are picking it from Colossians and Ephesians following Elijah the prophet John the Baptist but and following Jesus Christ after the demonstration for the amount of starts figures out of everywhere you bring it out it has to bring the gas fire the pattern of European book look at the deliverable people were under illusion they didn't know what to go to the attraction of Babylon so great because Babylon was the figuratively figuratively a figure who Antipa the dwelling place of all evil spirit but this evil spirit Messimer verses P they walk in suits II must invest they work in spies we come back that's why they destroy wonderful if we're in Africa soon someone a flake we will look at a witch like I do we will just look at the way the dress rough my god II mommy don't like be it's a PA I didn't say like you know that's a witch let's not be around thinks that is doing is going to eat but in this world here in which we are living in under this Babylon here the image of the beast in Revelation is destroying wonderfully giving them all the necessary means to be able to be brought under the subject of the the leadership of the devil we see now that as the word is that the world is a preparing me know what's Gouda Muenster clipart is evil scheme at the same time memento moody guy is also training Esther to become the queen of a Davina as the

come into the fold wonderfully is trying bring you people and to this worship as we see the word unfolding I love the new point God's bringing the revelation complete about you understand that knowledge of the mystery doesn't give it to you but the revelation of the mystery opens up the things that are hidden that manner profits of all ages wanted to see I wanted to desire to know but they didn't say Matthew 17 many prophet desire and this is the time in which we are living under this grant for valishia we understand that this here guard also has a plan revelation 18 ably apocalyptic

short period you see that God is revealing the plan of this enemy how is going to fulfill this great mystery else the days go by we receive now under the revelation of the prophet to be able to give us the understanding how did these kings how the power was going to be good to be to be operating in the earth and you see now that is the day happening the days go by people read people look people understand with their own way but then by the highs of the Prophet we see now that else the things are going by we understand that though he has his evil scheme as I've shown it to you in the Bible to

God is the way of to be worshipped there is a provided way of everything for God but then if you don't get this way of God automatically to God you are worshiping the devil because to worship God

branham same better that devil Kazuya their serpent who started creeping into the church but then when you read that because with that revelation you don't see that in your life as the bills that you have to say so many particles above us but you just read that the serpent came he fell a fever epitome be the revelation is far greater the knowledge there are people who can read the message but the revelation Malaga Bellagio remember appreciative five requirements to receive we've done the revelation Peter yeah under their pressure you will curse God this is how the custom this is how I kiss guys so Kentucky mudichu next Sunday the most pushing after next Sunday the Nexus slowly but surely certain moments you gamma the devil is finding his place is being in true until the man of sin has

work go and work and he goes out there without the word it looks just a bell Joseph are you cute destroying wonderfully nervous luck with that revelation the church is that big worshipping the devil without knowing and God looks at it as hello this year if you are blind naked and you don't know it this is the world in which we are living this is the time we are living one man's practice to be lifted up above the stars of God but here you see the realities in which we are living in that the fulfillment of it and the reading of it in the two different things you can read about it you can become a Greek brother pepper on say the tribulation falling away but then how you pray how's your prayer life would appear look in the church just look at the time they spend to pray God on the person who PA no I didn't say look at the time they pray look at the time they spend to pray until possibly you be the boss okay yeah you know how long Daniel prayed was have you come here before at the Dennard pier 21 days 21 days praying with self closed a bacon a little chakras on a minute of prayer let's see they sing more than they can pray and William Branham say the churches today are no more in the way the worship then in the way to with this proof you can see in the churches there's more time to music to worship the devil I do because when is worshiping is mind when i get out here i have my toast dollar now my $50 now a vaccine over $150 now i can he turn over time i know that i'll pay my car bill disappear I know I'll pay more about momma a see all my stuff then by the time you realize the preachers already pulled but he was sitting there laughing destroying this wonderful email via the mom and brick you seen a person the zeal that he had from the very beginning to worship God attending the prisoners of God all is gone as the pyramid is going forward many are falling away but are they falling away this is the way they are falling away before you know it I need to make a confession I need to repent old pray for me here I wonder who was praying with Jacob in the in the in the in the in the in the den Jacobo to fight with the angel boo combat abet launch who pray with him yep we have agree when I pray for me pray for me but a reasonable one how well does falling constitute to me how have you reached to that level escucha Havasu Nivola but you didn't see mechina that creeping spirit in you to successful occasion could be zero the angel of the best in your house you didn't say by the grace of God started opening these things to teach you these things because when the Spirit of Truth shall come shall teach you the spirit of truth to them under the illusion under the wine of the prostitute full of regular procedure they left the proof at the revelation in 1965 since they left it in 1965 look at the result yet they can have the appearance demons with ties on the pulpit preaching the word the devil has ministering augury in those days men shall come to Jesus a workers of work they have the knowledge of the world but they don't have the revelation of the world and the devil is transforming them or deforming them will collective form from what they were supposed but the Lord says that that demon will end up in the beat is it going to be alone William Branham say no he will do everything that he can to take with him as many as he can with him revelation 12 the Woodman's they had the 12 stars on the head clothed with the Sun the dragon stood before him and say that I will not die alone I have the a little fever we could have stay in under the so high the devil is added that the procedure is going to die beste the Catholic Church this isn't going to be here okay yes but you have to eat here you have to see how is it doing how are they able to stay under the worship of the Lord are they able to stay under the influence of the word they cannot know one that the because you look about the mouth no wonder the ways of God do doing no wonder the dressings right when they are among the believers they have a certain style of dressing once they find themself out there quickly peel them off it's like taking a su compañía a piece of meat you put in the microwave as long as the microwave is hot it's hot you take it out you put it outside and it's winter all the heat is gone by the time they hear going so you see they can say I'm not talking to you to those on a minute your parcel internet well they're here I mean once they step out doctor salt they can recall 18 The Cedars fallen on the land and the birds of the earth has come and picked up and left they can retain the world since they can retain the word then the devil will come and beauty but look they're unable to retain the word but they are able to have degrees and masters and what is that what else PhD and all kind of things hallelujah we go into heaven who pathos that heaven will be this way you won't be influenced come from beneath uniform above 500 because you are successful you can tell that by yourself 47 I'm able to play the music but I'm unable period that brings me to play the music I'm able to speak about everything in the world but when it comes to the Word of God I do reading that at all you know you are B we should also say lately this prostitute is bewitching the entire world because the devil s ministering spirit the first prophet the false teachers shall rise bringing perverse doctrine and people don't like when you come you start telling them in the face look at your life look at this look then when they wilt ask them you thought I was making you trouble but people say commercial the problem we're unit we know awesome yet full of quotations in their mouth just like the father in the Garden of Eden he was able to bring a lot of quotations to stand on the pulpit with the message today it's not a problem as long as they know that they can project it relevancy brother branham's brother Brown say alleluia alleluia the Technos but are they able even to take notes with this kind of preaching they can't they don't even know where to start what are they going to write but it requires the revelation to show you that this is the place I'm standing wrong this is the things that I have to watch this is why I have to write but this I have to learn how to fight because with the things that are coming out and even to learn how to fight through the combat because Paul said activity give yourself to reading exhortation and exhort us you be a part of our good work so I am who determines how are they going to be a pattern of good work if they don't know what the pattern of good will see before you know it his hatred in the church is the clannish in the church it's all kind of behavior in the church there's all kind of no sense in the church destroying this wonderfully as he is destroying day after day you know presume how long did it take commas 6,000 years to bring forth this whole kingdom and how is it going how is the person under that influence of the devil yeah there's no faith there's no virtue but there's no knowledge there's no temporary there's no patience there's no catalyst does the brother kindness there's no headstone and yet we're going to direct you see he has no need to read the quotation explain those things those places to bring forth the plan that the devil is using to bring down the Church of God because the spirit of the process unless any prophet is not a spirit of man it is the spirit that can discern the deepness of God we are gonna say I will go and show you what God had in the back pocket of his my eyes a is showing us what was in the heart of the devil Ezekiel told him that you think that you are wiser than that Daniel Ezekiel chapter 8 I believe is a bit weak I said pray for me I don't wanna be long ezekiel 28:2 to seven twenty eight to seven son of man say unto the Prince of Tyrus okay OpenCV just said the Lord is eternal because thine heart is lifted up don't covet elevate and Dallas said hid I am a God to just redo what is God means just over the object of adoration and observe a song of worship that he must have people to worship him over the circular door I sit in the City of God this relationship with the place where God was supposed to be no don't they have lost the first love because they have lost the first love somebody else's to pick either it is day or it is nice in the midst of the Seas in the midst of the sea or send Emir this is the man in revelation tells us if the Massachusetts the people yet Dharmendra no and not God though there sit down heart as the heart of God a temple of Allah to the Jews behold was he dah dah out wiser than Daniel this is where this man is the prophet of the age burnham you don't know you just can see it in the reaction of the preach them one thing when a person shows brother got himself knows in other words whatever that the past is fresh possibly possible and you know what he likes to push with you what are they say we are wiser than Daniel what is their knowing things of the Father there is no secret that they can hide from the India by the second composter cashier the devil knows how to get all of us come on with a minutos out of 80% or 90% of us here I can say it's the work of the devil that's why we here will cover the diabolo can you show me see application can understand my language component on that 80 to 90 percent of us here in other word in this land to be a little bit more clear televisi won't gossip a easy for you because if we were left in the land where where before they still to worship God we will be doing service every day we wouldn't even need cars we were working Lido's every day cool as you we were going we will present but then they become a star understood that these vessels of God I have to take them into Babylon when I take them there then I will wonderfully destroy them I will wonderfully deformed and look at us here show me see we say wisdom and we stain understanding though is getting dear itches and has gotten gold and silver into decoration Hur the law this gold here this silver here they didn't they didn't get it when they were down there in the other land because the other land it's only the politicians then you can leave the rest of us there's no middle class here now they stuff fighting to be in the middle class ready let's build let's see this destroyed they three wonderful that we saw never use them all because now all the riches did that they have gotten now they are able to face and to talk in the parallel because of money that's what I told one I like to hear first I put it above when you don't have it you don't you know but when you do and you start to talk when you have it don't you then I know one of the procedure Louisville opposition because bitter under a certain anointing he was able to stand to say that men that these people are not drunk and look at what proceedeth out of the mouth and look at now this year the wine in the pocket the wine in the pocket middle of building up gosh but up I make my choice wha-whatever want to do I do it nobody else to tell me nothing what this is wrong if you don't want I'll start listening to the tip at homes destroyed wonderfully slowly but surely is that listening to the tapes and now a 50 minute the lamb which is also a struggle and as the day goes by accomplishing our goals let's find it doe tips that heads at the language that I can understand as the days go by I'll stop streaming now Bob Lucas when I put the online at connect II after the days go by these preachers also they don't repeat when the messengers say is being destroyed wonderfully police aid forsaking the assembling of yourself or as the days go by the devil is destroying them good job below the tree and you see them and the church becomes the resting place won't you put on me like Jesus Jesus is born in the barnyard and now they typify the church with the banya how much they can sleep and I said that the angel would bring me it is a taking place right in your face sometimes one of the preacher said see him sleeping so clapping give him a good clap and see what is going to do in the church but then you see that the poor brother or the poorest is the if they do that the trouble will be gonna begin outside here they are born with chain of circumstances solution it's a constant ratio faith is a good interpreter right you can clarify certain language because sometimes you just speak and you don't use wood it's just coming out but some people can also understand and it's become the angel of the loads of some time therefore that's said the Lord or God the Lord God because thou has said Dinah hot as the heart of God behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the rear of the nation and they shall draw the sword against the beauty of the whistle it conquers and they shall defile die break you can see from what has come out all that these people are that ever brought in the life imaginations all the ambitions they have they can now look understand that this is going to notice in AHIMA all the schooling all this all that they have been able to do look at what that is but the Lord says God's plan for this last God's new creation Bellator future under the for sale because under the fo'c'sle we see that

i'll show you the mystery atomic column instead of this beast you have seen the mystery of the first of the first hour of the first cell second cill say the third cell but on the fulfill this beast is gathering all this power from the top we saw economic power political power religious power in order to destroy in order to overcome in order to bruise the tree to death we everything that was coming in this way but glory be to God but in these days is entered in that day essentially annoying thing of man was able to be too afraid this coming hardness rider required the Eagles anointing in anointing I can fly a little higher higher than the men can touch in order to explain these things the way it's been explained without the revelations the anointing of the ego then these people itself bound to destruction because the fruit is so beautiful the world is so beautiful mood the opportunities are so and we wanted so sooner so close and we wanted right now we don't want it tomorrow the

mouth it is all over c'est fini I'm going to speak it alright yes I'm here in the midst of the church the a man of God faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my process oh yes that is so that's aggravation 10-7 and in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when it shall begin to sound in other word that's showing you the mystery of this Babylon in how is destroying wonderfully the mystery of God should be finished why are all this happen why are all these things happening why are we facing are we not the sons of God are we not supposed to be the ones who's just come and worship and live with yourself but then when this man come he has to reveal to us why are all these things are taking he goes into Isaiah it shows you that this man has been in his heart was doing that he had a purpose and it shows you how we came about in destroying wonderfully building schools setting the laws in the land promoting that the right of everybody and this is the house taking place and the same time God sees that I have my sons I have my daughters that has to be on to my own image and out to my likeness and he has to bring them up out of this evil out of this evil age a brighter will come out with us but with a wrinkled without anything alike oh what a wonderful God he is this world everybody has the right to do everybody can do this nobody goes to Ted turtle to begin with the parents themselves the parents themselves and if you don't want the Stadler welcome every day at home what what I'm saying well it's not really a bad thing for you to have you building for you to have this year but understand that there is work to be done and how to do the work in order to find a way of escape because the end of this system is hell what a mocking you see you see or even said don't go to school don't understand no no no no no go to school I listen if you have to build your house or building Consuela one sword in the hand and two on the other balance of the Scriptures oh no he was really extremists know if knowledge you can balance the scripture to you do what you have to do but balance the scripture because if you just go all the way to the left no that's not right the walls are all the way to the right letici Daniel was able all that he was able to do there is a costume yes he was evil that God really angel was able to give him the revelation you do what you have to do you pray you pray brain there's no revelation so why are you praying you go you work you work you can pray anymore so why you be in the middle Bren improve what he says I have to work a work all day and I become an approach all night it's balanced out but if now you big deform into the image of the Beast then something is wrong why is something wrong because you are not the seed of God to begin with Annette policy most with your Pokemon say the messengers begins a Sunday mr. of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the Prophet there it is he's sending a vindicated you know all of that he's sending a prophet after almost two thousand years he is sending someone not some people it's not two three this job is not given to tricky given to me of the Lord doesn't come from two to three Eason is someone who is so far who is so far from organizations education and the world of religion that is John the Baptist and Elijah folder we will hear only from God and you will have that said this is your clue you miss this guy who Marcus forgot you are done you can go to any church listen to any preacher you can listen to promote paramagnet / money has to repeat and when it repeats it goes on his knees he was more revelation since he has be given me this thing do picky modulation and all that take him out who else everything new they take us to the Nouveau from all that I head downstairs to Cochabamba because he loves to give the river I stand before you see me turn the Volvo hardly I can read when I read I start talking again sukemasa poly Oh God it's a techno script in that hour it shall be given to you John the Baptist is larger although it will have that say the Lord and speak for God he will because Muffy's a mouthpiece and he as it is declared in Malachi 4 6 will turn their heart of the children is of but to the father's job the children have strayed from the truth in this hotel their children have gone away how did they go away from the truth by the scheme of the enemy of cause the peace of God ascending he will bring back the elect of the last days and they will hear is vindicated process is the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as the head as day as they had it and listen to this and don't select with him up in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be is bodies and bees voices and perform his work Alleluia do you see without the prophet there's no hearing without hearing there's no knowing without knowing is this dying there it is find the prospect prove low profile listen to the prophet to the prophet do what he says we keep you back and you'll be fine simple as that Oh oh brother you see oh brother you know no that's not my problem a possible problem debate as much as one become a Greek as you want living in the word with CD you can convince the preacher pastor pastor just for two months dumar supermoon you know how much distraction you'll get in that two months I might should be destroying too much the community under more when you run from the church just think on the things that you do but anyway but God now is standing here is showing us that this bread creation that this great creation herbs happens under the four silk the voice of the Eagles process and this prophet does not prefer now is showing this mystery and to show us that along this time that the Lord to loosen himself knew that how these things were going to message place and how they revelation is necessary in order to bring back the children to the place that we suppose because only you know you're poor your schedule are well from this time to this time when I get to this I get tired fatigued I guess I can pray the Holy Spirit in you will have to teach you don't take that job don't go into that go into this years and go don't go there the preacher doesn't have to come and tell you that the preacher doesn't have to be a publisher because here we have young and old and everybody and who is the preacher going to talk to to the smallest detail all they hold this oh they did the smallest the middle one but the word comes out this thing's delicious as you know I've went far from here that's why I've said but then the way but is not the preacher tells you go back to the message a power massage go back to the mr. Daniel understood that 70 years was enough see we cannot stay on the Babylon because he understood by the book of the Prophet their house Prophet Jeremiah at the time the church has spent in the world is limited to this and by revelation you have to know mahalo you will stay in the scene and from there years to show you their way back home the mindset of the restored Church considered Elizabeth to be how they had to come back home instability hadn't recognized the way you look on and how they had to stand as one I'm trying to get to disco tation quickly and then we'll close me if I don't get to the quotation we'll stay longer you keep praying for me right the grace of God I'm watching the time I'm trying really my best because when you don't do when you don't go to rotation after quotation the Spirit takes over you can control it and it's controlling you and the time goes and people get tired and but hold on hold on fast hold fast by the grace of God we'll get there like like like the forefathers of America when the when they were selling on the Seas like you know I want one more push one more push will get there one more push will get there one more push will get there then I tell you just here bro - a burden say god bless you the grace of God gasps at God's power to transform 131 and that's what all these are programs of religion they are still sons and daughters of God but it's being deformed mr. DiPalma is Sunday for me you see just as I showed you all this scheme of the devil one is done - but they're still sons and daughters of God the go to church wanting to do right that's what everybody hears you a nun never enters in a nunnery to be a mean woman to be a mean woman a minister NEFCO never goes through school just to be a bad man no empathy catanduva poly column input even irremovable you never join church and shake hands put your name on the book or wherever you do in your church to be a bad person when you do that be a good person that's why everybody's here to the moon that they see you want a big closer to God listen to what the prophets but man it's the deception say like deception all this to say shows deception Church agree can be the greatest deception ever like look one this church because after you hear this topic over the courtesy system system or Jezebel or Italia takes hold of you swipe all these things out all the in oldest the sweat and the voice and the shouting the profit of their preachers doing in five minutes and we need some oh forget about this thing he doesn't know where we've heard preachers breaches strikes on fire did you see any image did you see anybody jumping when God was creating there was no jumping in the shop I did so it was quiet he just spoke the word waited and it was and it was good it's a promoting keep keep moving keep moving no matter coach Enya was the coaching about say Oh God if the deformity that does it for my sake first sentence prayed it satola like me could we see God never had an organization there's no such a thing anywhere found that in the words of God it will only power that you found in the Word of God dision to church but now he's standing in the midst of the church as it stands they're revealing who is in the last he calls himself the altar of the creation of God this is my new creation this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself is the creator of that church in other for another word when you see the Prophet just go by the prophet standing on the pulpit or knowledge share it's God said you talking to you just when you go pal you see another distraction day that's how he's destroying wonderfully comes lucky to me obvious mom was so tired he forgot to turn off his phone the heavenly bridegroom created is on bride as the Spirit of God it came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cell from which his body was born call it a name I want to repeat that you created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit simply to give life to human human of them supply supplied by Mary system a simple sentence with the denilla V acceptors it shows the nipple for the polymer that would have been a sinful mankind producing a body that would that would not have produced the less atoms of him it was said lo a body thou done as thou father prepare to meet God not Mary God not the church God not the preacher God you're not the Prophet God not the system of the world he is creating this new body provided the body Mary was the human inhibitor and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth listen to this it was God he was a god man look at how in this creation is going to take place he was the son of God he was a new creation men and God love it you met and joined it was the first of his new races this other race this old man had to drop off a bet obey but there's from Mary Mary could not supply those things the church could not supply the material but then it requires God himself to come down in a woman and produce that in other word that has to come into a church and produce this other bride the heavenly bridegroom producing X bride unto himself remember we did help so because in the dream when God said that Nebuchadnezzar your kingdom will last so long when I say the prostitution sleeping in the church not paying the tight all these things discussions and all kind of nonsense God said you will can last only so long she sat down and when it begins the new creation of Commerce and wealth it is not a help of any hand because this stone came down without the help of any hand and in Mary oh my god has started you're showing that first in my church look what I'm able to do come up in this woman door such virgin woman without any touch of us to see I know just say brother Joseph suffice yourself will be confused there are consumed Mary these revelations even we just came from church now you start telling me let you Isaiah 7:14 it said cattle said cut off just so comes up and in every way she does not make us confess when she received a revelation she goes to Elizabeth you know what the cat did the neighborhood could have said she ran from home she has been with a man but the mystery God gives it to them he has chosen to give it unto everybody will listen to the way everybody will listen to things everybody was at this but only unto you that the angel of the Lord will come to give you the proper understanding yet I'm the pastor of the church will say that no buddy no it's not true somebody will look at you sitting there you working hard you working hard just just was more common foe but then the preacher of the church begins yeah that's what's the Bible's so don't be surprised sometimes when you see a preacher nailing so hard or certain things and yet in your heart you know differently if the Bible is the Bible the Bible when God gives you the revolution at the time that God had given her the revelation it is the revelation to Zechariah in the courier does the revelation and here she lay leaves the town and goes into the next town you start giving testimony brother I believed you my busy day somebody else will believe you and the next one that's how God does things no then in the case of manual in the case of our office Joseph and Mary he came through the dream will it do it for you question mark and even if the gun comes to them and tells them a lot a lot D that that's my son that's my daughter they will never say because the attitude in the mind begins to destroy you was to destroy your confidence that's how you understand people who understand this mystery whatever you want to tell them doesn't it gets here it goes out there the police all of the relation is open before wandering because they understand out of the ages comes the seal I love the seals the trumpets trumpets reveal live one we play we play they know you know in a period of time there is a mystery behind you there is a reason yeah wait those things are happening and God is blowing the trumpet so let them know what kind of mystery and also he's showing him the punishment just as as their shoulders just as is the killed shows as all the Bible shows that they ever destroy you after they've tried to break you down all the songs I'm going to cut them into hell and you will be lifted up and you'll stand as a mighty by him as a mighty my herb the wire come come Delta new command so that we saw he's the head of this new race coalition won 118 and he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all that all things he might have the preeminence therefore Allah if any man be in Christ is a new creation all the things have passed away behold all things are becoming new gods with new creation and the for sale under the message of the problem is and the only way to get to God I got you a prophet in Israel they understood it completely when they wanted to see me see God they want to see a prophet that's gas provided way because those who have in the wilderness said tell Moses and Moses we will come to tell us Villa and when Moses speak we're not living in after which the cloud was there oh I wish I would have been there glory be to God you you have tips the books on dissemination is still upon us and it's leading us all the way that's why the revelation is not just to repeat quotation historically but is to see the quotation wanna being revealed unto us shortly otherwise we are pure then we become great the Greeks they were known for their knowledge in Bulacan itself and disputable rosy but ever handsome uncircumcised in new creation there you can see that don't man who was all was of the old order remember in the Bible you have the order of Melchizedek and you have also this older here Jesus Christ when he was brought on earth he was lifted up to the order of Melchizedek and else also under the ministry of the Prophet we have to be lifted up to the some other a new being a new mindset by what the renewing of you mind but if psychologists in your head the meat of what is way DGP limit the limited purpose for poof oh-ho she can state six because he knows it's so good but then when you come in the world you know the loss is what zero minus ten in union with christ we come from and we have learned in other words what's more what's more until then a winner it is a desire it is a work you have to let birth name I work then we leopard on the wall from the rising of the Sun till this does appear we're working a love we shall respect we shall work in humility we shall work sometimes we fail the profile we are disrespectful forgiveness I didn't want I didn't mean to develop algorithms or do you see you see yourself do you go to you see what Daniel Priya was he went to God we have seen our love scene come in a repayment I don't have to wait for God to come and push me like I got to remind me because I am is worthless because himself he he went through the same pain he had to work I'm going to read it to you if we can get to it sometimes a lot Jesus my 30 minutes gone this new creation is not the old creation made over said a lot centers you will affect all could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it says it is new creation it is another creation this day from the old one what the devil made out of you that all the Serpent's old man has created something that we desire not to be this is exactly what it is no longer is dealing by waste of the land after is there dealing by ways of the flesh that was how it does with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham issues through the godly Isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe nations and he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was the he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit is creating many sons unto himself Amen God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God I know it's a quotation but you have to see it by revelation for it to make sense even if I explain it here it won't make sense until you see how God is he creating a new creation in me on one it has to come by reverse even if I sit with you and I show it to you rather tell me things that you're going to tell me and you know that and there are things the next your best friend you never tell them just like Paul was saying he'll go to the - to the Romans but you oh man he just uses in language you know temptation was in my flesh how many passes Paul but then when the creation started in him mcenany was both to speak pleased the Lord to reveal his son in me then in other words it's not given to you by amen it's given to you by himself he has to come in you his workmanship that is why you could look right down down at the last age when all will be over and you see himself still in the midst of the church altar of this new creation of his sovereign power brought it to pass by use own decree elect not everybody know everybody will hit but the members other ones now going to hear how is it going to happen it's going to happen and they're going to see and they see that already working in them because they can tell because if you move if you're driving from one point from point A to point B or from here to the two are to the airport you'll know in five minutes I'll be ten minutes when you drive it but when you see that because we don't know how long is it good if you will ever be there only those that got as elected green and to come to fulfill this new creation will be able to get if we designated them is only adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his we listen for adoption on suboxone boom please it's a volunteer but by is omniscience and omnipotence a body to pass how health could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren and if he did not make sure all things in you and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that this purpose and good pleasure will brought to pass a zoological Survey eternal Lord said O Lord save a person particularly the juban plays echolalia affair passe in whom also we have obtained an inheritance until news about the accumulative being predestinated according to the purpose of him so no model of who work of all things after the counsel of his own will to do so soon know the sovereignty Alleluia amen orange you glad his covenant that should be long apart in here this is God's will Kozlov alone then is fulfilling this work and as he is fulfilling this it requires that every Son of God suck every thought of that because you said now that work I can go any further because my time is gonna have to stop because that's okay I had to show I had to show you steps this growth and the reward of all these things come on a lot of components but our time is up but then by this I believe every Son of God every third of God should have the revelation well should have the understanding how the work is being done in them what type of Kingdom was in them and what type of world the old man has to be put off the type of work just to give you prayer as multiplayer the consecration second reading consecration second reading Braille consecration Zack reading pray you can sit there listen to me for hours sometimes you get tired but under the shadow of the Almighty you'll never get you'll go on you'll desire more you desire more you'll want to know we don't work on it how did this spirit get into Malaya sunset imagine how am I going to stop it forever and how am I going not to have God's life because life is going to cross because some of you we're somewhere and you've been before me just look at your behavior you've been deformed abetted it for me musician step forward you're going to be true going to be transformed now for me by the renewing of your mind Christ Jesus working in you the stone coming down la Pepitone without the help of any holy so cool and by this stone is not the church it's not this one has it's not this year it's not that here if we can sing the song that were the sisters sang here there is a fountain in front then God Himself going to transform the church bring it back that position again so he can be glorified in the new creation not the hope creation but not the old previous not or everything that this one or that one is doing but she took a little above release effect but we want many who love God's creation in this hour because very soon they didn't walk no more the third walk twice iam ammonia is that the end is that the door sorry and we have to stand and know for sure it's a void and what kind of creation we are in order to be able to make it over there what because the only Escape is the Holy Ghost it's not knowledge it's not just attendance you only spend about three four how was he but under his inspiration is going to transform you
