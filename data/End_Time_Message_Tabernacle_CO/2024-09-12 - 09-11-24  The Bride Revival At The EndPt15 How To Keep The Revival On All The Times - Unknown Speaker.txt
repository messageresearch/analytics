short and we are surrendering ourself to you expecting a Special Touch from above your Prophet said the body of Christ is the most sick body he knows of [Music] look at the need we are presenting before you look at the condition physically speaking spiritually speaking financially economically father there are so many needs Among Us but we thank you because we know that you are the Jehovah Rafa you can heal any disease you are Jehovah you are the provider you are Jehovah Shalom shom to bring peace where hearts are Afflicted where there is sadness you are there to bring peace to bring [Music] comfort you are Jehovah shama Jehovah sh the very present help in the time of trouble all those attributes it's you Jesus Christ we have come here [Music] tonight for a prayer service father we pray that you take over of the remaining portion of this service to guide and Inspire each one of us on what we need to pray for whom we should address our prayers because you have told us to pray for one another in order to pray for somebody else we need your leadership to pray for the right person for the right need as we finish this series on revivals we have dedicated this prayer service to ask you one thing that the Revival that you have set on our hearts in our souls could never die and continue with each one of us until the Rapture bless this Gathering that we dedicate to you remembering all the requests that we have among us we get from request from Brother Junior for his daughter Monica and for the lady he transported in his [Music] car who is going to surgery for her kidney and also the blood in her heart we pray also Father for the Kupa and the malos family and for all of us who were acquainted with them during this time of big pain and trial that you bring Comfort your support and to remember those little children who will be growing without a mother to give peace and wisdom for the unity in the family they are not the only one who are mourning somewhere there may be many others also among the bright almighty God we need you and guide us and lead us during this prayer meeting we ask all of these things your leadership in Jesus Christ name amen amen may God bless you as uh we are Still Standing we are going to read just one scripture in first John chapter [Music] 5 verse 4 uh because I want to carry this thought tonight how to keep the Revival on all the time how to keep the Revival on all the times we read brother Bram he said according to the history of Revival it just take three years and it vanished but but our prayer tonight is to ask the almighty God to help us maybe the time ahead of us is not even three years we don't know but until the Rapture if that could be more than three years keep the Revival if it's going to be shorter than that keep the Revival because that the purpose God has sent the Revival and the only way to keep that Revival is by faith therefore the Bible said for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen amen may the Lord bless the reading of the scripture you may be seated yeah in order to maintain the victory it takes faith not the faith of another person but your own faith and brother said faith is a revelation if you have the Revelation that this end time Revival is not for everyone it's particularly for the bride and if you have the Revelation that you are that bride then this is the prayer request Lord not only me my wife my children my husband my church everyone let us keep this revival up we don't know what tomorrow is reserving are you really ready you may go to bed for the last time sleeping in your house without even knowing without even being sick without even being diagnosed with sickness once that happen where are you going to be all the sermons all the messages will be in front of you your own life will stand before you and you will be going and looking at your body where are you going is it from Darkness to Darkness to Darkness to Darkness or from light to light and light at that point there is no way back oh I've left1 million somewhere where nobody knows Lord if you can help me going going back to tell them where it is so that that money can serve somebody nobody can do that it's done the only time you can do everything it's today when you have such prayer meeting pray I remember testimony from uh Rebecca uh Bram Rebecca Smitha Smith she stayed in tuon when brother bam had that accident in Maro because she was dating brother George dating yeah they stayed there and the rest of the family was traveling back to Jeffersonville and the accident happened brother Bram was in a different car than Billy Paul and when Billy Paul saw the crash Sarah was in the Joseph was in the car was in the car was in the car the only person in the family left out was Rebecca and Brother Joseph was only 10 years and Billy Paul was a mature person at that time they not have cell phones he went and find some place to make the call and he called Rebecca said dear sister Daddy and the rest of the family are in a critical condition pray like you never prayed before she used to publish a lot of Mega magazine called only believe that was Sister Rebecca and brother they have to write a lot of stories that's what she said but when I read that only believe magazine that little sentence caught my attention saying you can also so pray like you never prayed before and let that be tonight as we have this prayer meeting brother Bram said in the message diseases and afflictions paragraph 26 someone said does the healings last they last as long as Faith lasts and we can apply it tonight to the revival can the Revival that started in you can it last yes as long as Faith lasts but when Faith fails then your Revival will also fail so all depends on our faith if God has sent those seven tunders to revive us and we are awake so the only way is to keep it up how to keep it up faith faith in what in the word of God to read the word of God and pray said two things will make you prosper spiritually read the word and pray as a Christian if you don't feel like reading the word of God or listening to the word or to pray you are in trouble that Revival is certainly going to die I don't want to take much time to speak but I want really to give some time maybe more than 30 minutes for us to pray so the thing that will keep the Revival is your faith and brother calls Faith the good man of the house the good man of the house if you have a good man standing in the door at the door of your house you are guaranteed no evil will get in in the message show us the father and its suffices parag 56 said remember I have warned every one of you within 72 hours what will take place the Bible said when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walks in dry places then returns again is that right with seven other Devils work than he was be careful let the good man of the house be standing there with faith woring him away telling him he can't come amen amen if you are prayed up or you believe God is set you free from something have always the faith when that person will that disease or that bad Spirit want to get back to cool you off again oh no the Revival is already passed keep the good man of the house at the door he will will stand there he will refuse to see it he refuse to have it or anything else stay right with it amen amen in the message the second Miracle paragraph 71 brother said now what we are trying to get that is more strength in the good man of your house which is Faith is that right now if you can look at here now see that by Revelation because everything Faith is a revelation that's what we find in the Bible in the the book of Hebrews 11 by faith Enoch in other words it means by Revelation by faith Abraham Abraham by faith Joseph Joseph by Faith by Faith by faith means simply by Revelation and if you look at Hebrews 11 they have mentioned so many names I want tonight you to add your name to say by [Music] faith kept Revival don't let that uh heavy Spirit come back upon you heavy when you feel like I can do this too but heaviness come to the extent are you following me that heaviness spirit will come and when you are about to do what you are called to do the heaviness spirit will tell you you will do it tomorrow you get tomorrow you will do it again tomorrow that a spirit of post things but today is today Revival today and forever we need to keep pressing on we need to regardless you know when you are you have a target an objective you want to achieve it let me tell you brother it's not always easy every time you set up a goal the enemy watches the enemy will come as ambition and if you look at the obstacles you will never reach the goal you will all the time be stopped by the obstacles that's the reason why God send a Revival to give us some power because Revival itself it's the action of God in power to continue to press on remember uh Moses with the children of Israel they were corn somewhere in front there was the Red Sea Mountain and mountain and no way to go back because the army of pharaoh was coming now what to do there was a dead end it's like you are driving into a city you don't know you come somewhere you did not see the sign where they put it a dead end you getting in front of you house house house house maybe in you have to go back but with the children of Israel there was no way to go back this is the lesson God is giving to us don't go back don't give up brother sister the distance we have walked is not worthy to go back if we cannot go back we cannot turn to the left or to the right the only thing is keep pressing on remember the vision for the translation where brother was on the sixth Dimension what else to do he heard the voice keep pressing keep pressing keep pring and that's what the Revival has to do and our prayer tonight God set a pressing on spirit in me and among us there is no way back there was a little quote I did not feel like preaching [Music] really in the message speak to the Rock and it shall give forth his water somewhere in the paragraph 28 said that's the way people does today when fear strikes them when they are right in the path of Duty brother the Revival put you in your way of Duty to cast out every demon to refuse any kind of sickness to walk on the serpent and scorpions to possess every territory and without fear and said listen brother let me say this if you are walking in the light having fellowship with god with his people and the Holy Spirit is upon you and you meet an obstacle right in the path of Duty just go back amen amen said you are in the line of duty amen don't stop just keep pressing on but I'm going to continue to press on until where I don't know the only thing I know you just continue to press if you hit the Walling that means Satan come with obstacles don't pay attention keep pressing just keep pressing listen to just keep pressing on God Will Make A Way through it it's not you it's not you the only thing God is asking you with your prayer keep pressing on the doctor said keep pressing on B said keep pressing the enemy come keep pressing until where until God will be forced to make a way listen to that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see God if you to PR brother you are going to see God because humanly speaking you have reached the wall and the only person who can make a way is God in which way I don't know but one way or another he will make a way and when he make a way hallelujah it's always in amazing way amazing way will allow you to see God with your eyes hallelujah hallelujah the oldest man in the Bible you know his story he went through a lot of Tri through a lot of Tri he lost his wife children he lost his to the end he was almost dying and his wife said just that God and died he said no there is no way with that God there is no limitation continue to these three friends came to comfort him the condition they see him under the people who came to Comfort they stay speechless for seven days I call it the mystery of the seven Ser seven days they could not say a word but if you look brother you came to comfort your brother look at the condition sometimes if you go through a lot of experience the people coming to comt you will be comforting them and the only way you can reach that position is when you keep up the Revival you will be a testimony you will see God and then the Bible says at the end I think chapter 42 The Book of Job 42 chapter God restor everything Resto everything you know the statement of job I have heard I see that means who trials dead end that's the only way you can see God and let during this prayer if in there is someone here who have reached a dead end let the door be open so that you can see God when I can't go over it let me show you if I cannot get over it get under it if you cannot get under it around it or anyway God opens up a way and I go through it somehow another his grace is sufficient to carry us through amen amen oh brother I don't feel like talking really I just want to invite you to do that experience say to tonight Lord you have prepared us through the Revival series to break through in which way I don't know maybe brother you are struggling tonight maybe sister you can be struggling with your finances you cannot be stable you get the money you work a lot you make money at the end you don't see tonight God can open a way so that you can have some if you have sickness that the doctor said you know this kind of sickness you have only to live under medication but let me tell you he is still the Jehovah he can change a situation brotherless of the condition regardless of the circumstance regardless of whatever it is he remains God give me some I think P 42 the Bible say Psalm 42 I believe no I mean 46 rather 46 from the beginning God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble and brother call him based on this is Jehovah sh in this time of big trouble you and you have come through the series of Revival let him be seen by your eyes as Jehovah as Jehovah Jehovah sh sh Jehovah shalomov Shalom all those attributes he is for you let us stand on our feet yeah I don't want to continue with the rest of the court maybe later on I will just ask maybe very very soft music maybe one person playing uh very very soft and to prepare our souls to enter into his presence prayer is the strongest weapon and we have it in our hands tonight don't be distracted young people or others I I don't think during prayer ask please always help you will allow people to go in and out and if it happen some emergency that you go out when you come back don't squeeze people and disturb them come sit on the first Pew then we will know this is the Pew of people who goes up out but don't disturb anyone Manuel can give us something what a friend we have
