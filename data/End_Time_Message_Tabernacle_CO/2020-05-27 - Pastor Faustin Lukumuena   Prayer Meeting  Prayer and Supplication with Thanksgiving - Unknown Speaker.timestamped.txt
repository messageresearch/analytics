[50:21] mer gracious Heavenly Father prelest
[50:24] creator of and
[50:27] Earth the Al and the
[50:30] Omega the beginning and the
[50:33] ending you the first and the
[50:36] last you the first and the
[50:40] last you the great
[50:43] Emmanuel we come Lord father before you
[50:48] tonight by your grace and by your
[50:52] mercy because you have Lord made it
[50:55] possible for us Lord to be able to be
[50:57] guarded
[51:02] today because Lord we see that in the
[51:05] book of Philipp
[51:09] Philippians that Paul was Lord wanted to
[51:13] get to the people and bring them the
[51:19] message but it was very hard in the in
[51:23] the land in the city of Philippi
[51:30] but lordmy
[51:32] God you have granted us Lord this
[51:35] privilege Lord through the
[51:40] media to be able Lord to gather together
[51:44] Lord from diverse
[51:49] places from diverse
[51:52] places lord it's by your grace
[51:57] that lord it's not because we deserve
[52:00] anything of our
[52:04] own but it is Lord father God you who
[52:07] have predestinated us onto
[52:11] life to be able Lord to stand Lord in
[52:15] this time lord while the world is
[52:21] changing but Lord to worship you in
[52:23] truth and spirit
[52:27] it is therefore Lord with Thanksgiving
[52:29] that we come before
[52:33] you Lord to say thank you
[52:36] Father that's why Lord are we coming in
[52:39] this time of
[52:42] prayer Lord to bring forth Lord
[52:45] everything that is within
[52:50] us because Lord we know that many a Time
[52:54] Lord we may have have went Lord through
[52:56] the
[53:00] doctors we have went through many people
[53:03] to help
[53:07] us but brother tells
[53:10] us that when all these people
[53:14] fail we have to turn to you
[53:19] father therefore Lord we know that
[53:24] tonight that many things Lord that
[53:26] nobody can be able to
[53:30] help we expressing Lord father God to
[53:33] read unto you in

[53:40] Redeemer be with us throughout this
[53:43] meeting be with us throughout this
[53:47] meeting that you may Lord sustain
[53:52] us that you may give us Lord what Lord a
[53:55] human being could not be able to
[54:01] offer but then in return we can praise
[54:07] you we can Lord glorify your holy
[54:13] name because we know at the end of the
[54:15] day like
[54:19] Paul Lord he was Lord father God
[54:21] rewarded of the work that he worked in
[54:23] his life
[54:28] the same was for William
[54:31] Bram and above it all yourself the Lord
[54:34] Jesus Christ in the days of your
[54:39] flesh we have Lord father God these
[54:42] examples Lord set before
[54:46] us may you help us Lord to stand
[54:51] strong despite Lord father God many
[54:54] Temptations
[54:59] but Lord this is the time to show surely
[55:01] Lord that we are true Christians
[55:06] father we cry Lord father God unto
[55:10] you may you grant Lord father God our
[55:12] heart
[55:15] desire as we ask and
[55:18] pray in the name of Jesus
[55:22] Christ we all say Amen
[55:26] amen amen amen amen may God richly bless
[55:31] you as uh I said last

[55:43] Bible in the book of
[55:48] Philippians as I said we left this
[55:51] chapter
[55:52] 4 for for this Gathering
[55:59] Philippians chter
[56:01] 4 verse 4 to

[56:36] weave Thanksgiving let your request be
[56:40] made known unto
[56:50] God amen amen uh that's what we want to
[56:53] do tonight this a
[56:57] and uh for
[57:00] title I'm taking the middle of uh verse
[57:07] six prayer and supplication with
[57:17] Thanksgiving so we are um going to pray
[57:21] and uh with
[57:23] supplications
[57:26] but we want to add this peace with
[57:32] Thanksgiving so for our
[57:35] prayers for
[57:37] tonight we are going to
[57:40] cry we are going to make the
[57:43] supplication and I want to underline
[57:46] don't forget
[57:52] Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is what Paul
[57:55] is uh underlining here in the book of
[58:06] Philippians as we will continue to read
[58:09] uh the book of
[58:12] Philippians you will see why Paul said
[58:16] not only uh prayer supplication but also
[58:20] with
[58:23] Thanksgiving
[58:27] uh because he saw the Thanksgiving from
[58:32] the people of uh
[58:39] Philippi that's very very
[58:44] important and sometimes we make fun of
[58:47] the people in
[58:51] denomination I believe because they go
[58:54] overboard
[58:58] they don't see anything
[59:00] else they can be in any
[59:04] condition they don't
[59:07] care about prayer to be in contact with
[59:12] God the only thing they want to
[59:15] underline is
[59:18] Thanksgiving but the same Paul
[59:21] said if we can give our body to be
[59:23] burned
[59:26] if we don't have the love of
[59:28] God it's nothing so right
[59:32] here we see that we need always to have
[59:36] a balance in the
[59:42] scripture so from where we came from
[59:45] last
[59:47] Sunday we saw that Paul was
[59:52] arrested and that's why somewhere Paul
[59:55] is
[59:57] saying we are praying so that God can
[59:59] open up the
[1:00:03] way so that we can bring forth the
[1:00:07] gospel and uh in certain
[1:00:11] instances we need our prayers and
[1:00:14] supplication to
[1:00:16] be uh Follow by
[1:00:23] Thanksgiving we need also to make
[1:00:25] promises to
[1:00:28] God what we will
[1:00:31] do and if he does
[1:00:34] something and that's my personal secret
[1:00:39] also I remember when we were sick with
[1:00:42] my wife
[1:00:45] here I was talking to the
[1:00:49] children I exalted them in the same
[1:00:53] angle
[1:00:55] to make a
[1:00:56] promise of
[1:01:00] Thanksgiving uh to the lord it's not
[1:01:03] like they have money or
[1:01:07] something that's not what
[1:01:10] matters but this is a way to teach
[1:01:15] them then in a critical
[1:01:18] situation this is what Dad
[1:01:21] does making a
[1:01:23] promise I I said I don't need to know
[1:01:26] what you are
[1:01:30] promising but you make your own
[1:01:33] promise and from time to
[1:01:36] time I'm following with each
[1:01:41] one did you fulfill what you
[1:01:45] promised because if you don't fulfill
[1:01:50] it that was not the end of
[1:01:53] life
[1:01:55] tomorrow we will be sick
[1:01:58] again if maybe even more sick than
[1:02:03] that or we will have a
[1:02:06] need or a
[1:02:09] situation very critical
[1:02:11] again where we will need a special
[1:02:16] prayer and then when we will talk about
[1:02:20] Thanksgiving you will be
[1:02:23] stuck when you
[1:02:25] remember that when I made that
[1:02:28] promise I did not fulfill
[1:02:32] it that will kill your
[1:02:35] faith but
[1:02:38] if you made once a
[1:02:42] promise and God made it to come to
[1:02:46] pass and uh you know that you also
[1:02:49] fulfilled your
[1:02:52] part that will give you more
[1:02:55] faith and when I'm talking about
[1:02:59] Thanksgiving or making
[1:03:02] promise God doesn't need
[1:03:05] money all the time but what God will see
[1:03:09] for your
[1:03:12] Thanksgiving is what you are going to
[1:03:16] promise or if it's after the
[1:03:19] fact God will appreciate what you are
[1:03:22] going to offer
[1:03:25] as a
[1:03:27] Thanksgiving so therefore it's up to
[1:03:30] each one of
[1:03:33] us to offer something
[1:03:37] consistent that will really touch
[1:03:41] God amen amen so Paul needed
[1:03:46] prayer as he was in a
[1:03:49] prison and uh he did not
[1:03:53] know
[1:03:55] if he's going to get out of
[1:03:58] prison or he will be
[1:04:01] killed I don't know where I read
[1:04:04] it maybe the prophet or the
[1:04:08] Bible but it doesn't
[1:04:10] matter Paul was not
[1:04:12] sure being in prison he did not know
[1:04:16] that by the prayer the earthquake will
[1:04:18] break the prison
[1:04:23] gat
[1:04:25] but he say he could have been executed
[1:04:28] in
[1:04:31] prison he knew he could
[1:04:34] die that's why the prayer or and the
[1:04:38] supplication with Thanksgiving became
[1:04:40] very
[1:04:45] important that's why he say but in
[1:04:50] everything by prayer and
[1:04:53] supplication
[1:04:54] with
[1:04:56] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[1:05:00] known unto
[1:05:05] God your request be made known unto
[1:05:11] God when you have a prayer
[1:05:14] request don't look at the
[1:05:17] circumstan don't look at the
[1:05:20] condition but have faith in God
[1:05:26] therefore take this scripture of
[1:05:29] Paul to do a
[1:05:35] combination of prayer and
[1:05:40] supplication with
[1:05:44] Thanksgiving to make our request be
[1:05:47] known unto
[1:05:50] God and
[1:05:52] tonight whatever request you
[1:05:55] have my brother my
[1:05:58] sister as we are
[1:06:00] praying you can also
[1:06:02] pray and say God inspir me what is more
[1:06:09] appropriate and you can also dedicate
[1:06:12] your
[1:06:13] time in
[1:06:16] Thanksgiving and say
[1:06:19] Lord for this demon of
[1:06:23] television
[1:06:26] pornography
[1:06:27] movies
[1:06:30] entertainment all these things I know
[1:06:34] it's just killing my
[1:06:36] time but your Bible
[1:06:38] said Redeeming the time because the days
[1:06:42] are
[1:06:44] evil Lord I know by watching all these
[1:06:49] things I'm going away from
[1:06:52] you and you will not be able to answer
[1:06:56] my
[1:06:59] prayers so
[1:07:01] therefore Lord if you take
[1:07:04] out this
[1:07:06] demon this is what I'm going to
[1:07:09] do or I can say Lord I'm going to
[1:07:14] spend one
[1:07:17] day for example I don't need
[1:07:20] anybody to serve
[1:07:22] you may go to pray I may go to do a
[1:07:27] service I may going to send spend my
[1:07:30] time to exalt
[1:07:33] somebody or I'm just going to go and
[1:07:36] clean up the
[1:07:40] church do
[1:07:42] something probably what I never been I
[1:07:45] never done
[1:07:48] before offering you this
[1:07:52] time
[1:07:54] for the sake of my prayer to be
[1:07:57] accompanied with
[1:08:03] Thanksgiving amen amen so Paul was in
[1:08:09] prison and he's
[1:08:11] speaking let us take Philippians chapter
[1:08:16] 4 from verse
[1:08:19] 10 U people will look at Paul is
[1:08:22] speaking
[1:08:25] Paul was
[1:08:26] saying I'm not doing
[1:08:29] this because I need favor of
[1:08:35] money or I need people to give me
[1:08:39] this but Paul was
[1:08:42] saying I am used to every condition
[1:08:46] under which God will put
[1:08:51] me if I'm in riches
[1:08:55] I praise God if I'm in
[1:08:58] poverty I praise God I'm not saying this
[1:09:03] talking about
[1:09:04] Thanksgiving for you to bring me
[1:09:08] gift Paul say no it's not about those
[1:09:14] gifts I am
[1:09:16] able to accommodate
[1:09:19] myself in every
[1:09:22] condition so I'm not doing
[1:09:25] this for the sake of getting any benefit
[1:09:28] of
[1:09:30] any so let us take Philippians chapter
[1:09:36] 4 uh reading from verse
[1:09:40] 10 but I rejoice in the Lord
[1:09:45] greatly that now at last your care of me
[1:09:50] has flourished
[1:09:52] again
[1:09:58] wherein ye were also careful but ye
[1:10:01] lacked
[1:10:09] opportunity verse
[1:10:11] 11 not that I speak in respect of want
[1:10:16] for I have learned in whatsoever State I
[1:10:20] am there weave to be
[1:10:36] I know both how to be a based and I know
[1:10:41] how to abound everywhere and in all
[1:10:46] things I am instructed both to be full
[1:10:51] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[1:10:54] suffer
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:18] need Paul is rejoicing for the
[1:11:22] gift
[1:11:24] but he's telling the
[1:11:25] people don't you think I'm after your
[1:11:28] gift or after your
[1:11:32] money I'm used to every
[1:11:36] circumstance and I believe every servant
[1:11:39] of God will say the
[1:11:42] same criticism can
[1:11:45] come or his stressing out this and
[1:11:50] that but Paul said I'm doing this for
[1:11:54] your
[1:11:56] sake for your good and that's how people
[1:11:59] even in
[1:12:02] denominations you see somebody he maybe
[1:12:06] get
[1:12:09] blessed I'm going to offer uh maybe a
[1:12:12] car to the
[1:12:15] pastor I'm going to buy him maybe a suit
[1:12:18] or whatever it
[1:12:21] is I'm going to do this for my
[1:12:25] church maybe buy a new uh music
[1:12:31] instrument so there are many good
[1:12:35] opportunities that's why Paul is saying
[1:12:38] here as we
[1:12:40] read in verse 10 that you have this in
[1:12:44] your
[1:12:46] mind but you did not have the
[1:12:50] opportunity but me being in prison
[1:12:54] that gave you an
[1:12:56] opportunity so brother sister you may be
[1:13:00] having good thing I'm going to do I
[1:13:02] don't know what to
[1:13:06] offer God can give you an
[1:13:09] opportunity
[1:13:11] maybe sickness around
[1:13:14] youor can be
[1:13:16] sick
[1:13:18] opportunity yes somebody can take
[1:13:20] advantage of the
[1:13:22] opportunity
[1:13:24] to do something
[1:13:26] special somebody will miss also the
[1:13:30] opportunity it cannot be only for the
[1:13:33] pastor it can be a brother
[1:13:36] sister who can be in
[1:13:38] hospital he can have lost a family
[1:13:43] member it's an
[1:13:45] opportunity but we don't want to miss
[1:13:48] the opportunity all the
[1:13:51] time but when we have a prayer and
[1:13:55] supplication we have to thank God for
[1:13:58] the opportunity of
[1:14:02] Thanksgiving that's why James said in
[1:14:06] the Book of James 1:27 you can take it
[1:14:13] down 27
[1:14:16] james7 that the pure
[1:14:20] religion is to visit the fatherless and
[1:14:22] the those in their
[1:14:30] Affliction it's an opportunity
[1:14:32] opportunity it's not all together to buy
[1:14:34] a suit to buy a pastor car so people
[1:14:37] know that the car was bought by so and
[1:14:47] so and Paul saying I'm not saying this
[1:14:50] for you to come and give to
[1:14:52] me
[1:14:55] because I am adapted in every
[1:15:00] condition poty I'm
[1:15:02] okay in riches I'm
[1:15:05] okay I'm content in every ccum
[1:15:12] circumstance and I'm saying this for the
[1:15:14] sake of helping
[1:15:18] somebody as Paul
[1:15:20] said I'm happy in every
[1:15:24] circumstance it's not just to beg for
[1:15:28] people's gift or whatever it
[1:15:35] is you do whatever you want to
[1:15:38] do but the word of God still is the word
[1:15:41] of
[1:15:42] God yes so Paul wanted people to visit
[1:15:47] him also in
[1:15:50] prison that's what as Christian we have
[1:15:53] to to
[1:15:55] do visit your brother in
[1:15:58] sickness visit your brother when he he
[1:16:01] has lost family member he's
[1:16:06] mour but you when you heard that brother
[1:16:10] has lost
[1:16:13] somebody you have no time for visit oh
[1:16:16] I'm working working
[1:16:18] working but the day will happen to
[1:16:21] you you will one
[1:16:30] complain the
[1:16:32] church we don't come to church to
[1:16:36] receive the Bible said in the book of
[1:16:40] act it's a
[1:16:43] joy to give them to
[1:16:46] receive you have to learn to
[1:16:50] give with Thanksgiving with your prayers
[1:16:55] and that's why Bram said we cannot have
[1:16:58] a complete
[1:17:01] service without passing the offering
[1:17:07] basket why brother said we don't bum for
[1:17:13] money but we pass the offering
[1:17:18] basket because giving is part of our
[1:17:22] religion
[1:17:24] and I'm not talking about regular
[1:17:26] offerings and tight and so
[1:17:30] forth I'm talking about Thanksgiving
[1:17:33] special
[1:17:37] offering amen amen let's continue to
[1:17:41] read uh as we are in the book of
[1:17:43] Philippians chapter
[1:17:46] 4
[1:17:48] Philippians where we read up to verse 12
[1:17:51] now let's take verse 13
[1:17:55] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:17:58] strengthens
[1:18:03] me not withstanding ye have well
[1:18:08] done that you did communicate with my
[1:18:14] Affliction Paul said in verse
[1:18:18] 14 that ye have well
[1:18:21] done to take part with my
[1:18:27] Affliction because the Bible said I was
[1:18:30] in prison you visit me
[1:18:33] not I was
[1:18:35] hungry you fed me not I was
[1:18:40] thirsty you did not drink give me
[1:18:43] drink I was
[1:18:45] sick you did not visit
[1:18:48] me whatever
[1:18:50] condition but here Paul
[1:18:53] if that's why when you read you take a
[1:18:55] study of a Bible stud Bible
[1:18:59] study if you understand the
[1:19:03] circumstances that will help you so here
[1:19:07] Paul
[1:19:08] said not withstanding verse
[1:19:11] 14 we have well
[1:19:14] done that you did communicate with my
[1:19:19] Affliction verse 15 now Paul praising
[1:19:23] the
[1:19:25] Philippians saying that you were the
[1:19:27] only
[1:19:31] people to come and take part of my in my
[1:19:38] need but you didn't see the colossian
[1:19:41] being
[1:19:43] mad or the the Corinthian being
[1:19:48] mad or theoni getting
[1:19:51] mad what we have done what we have done
[1:19:54] Paul is not talking about it he's
[1:19:56] talking only about the
[1:20:04] Philippians sometimes it's the devil
[1:20:06] Spirit
[1:20:09] speaking if somebody is being
[1:20:12] praised praise God for him and also pray
[1:20:16] that God give you the opportunity to be
[1:20:18] praised one
[1:20:21] day
[1:20:25] I think you are following
[1:20:27] me and you are in good
[1:20:31] spirit to understand the
[1:20:34] spirit so verse 15 Paul
[1:20:37] saying now you
[1:20:40] Philippians know
[1:20:42] also that in the beginning of the
[1:20:47] Gospel when I departed from
[1:20:51] Macedonia no church communicated with me
[1:20:54] as concerning giving and
[1:21:08] receiving
[1:21:11] only Paul is mentioning Philippians ye
[1:21:18] only and he making
[1:21:21] allusion
[1:21:23] when I departed from
[1:21:26] Macedonia and if you look at the
[1:21:30] map
[1:21:31] Macedonia you see all those cities
[1:21:35] around so Paul left
[1:21:38] Macedonia cring until
[1:21:42] Philippi he did not notice as such thing
[1:21:46] as giving and
[1:21:50] receiving so let us be like
[1:21:54] Philippians that's why Paul is telling
[1:21:57] them when you pray
[1:22:06] combination with
[1:22:09] supplication also with
[1:22:13] Thanksgiving and verse
[1:22:16] 16 PA say for even
[1:22:21] in
[1:22:23] ye send once and again unto my
[1:22:31] necessity yes so Paul is saying even
[1:22:36] when
[1:22:38] in the
[1:22:40] Philippians you have taken care of
[1:22:42] me for my
[1:22:45] necessity not once but again so brother
[1:22:50] when you do the Thanksgiving
[1:22:53] it's not
[1:22:54] once but remember do it again and again
[1:23:00] verse
[1:23:01] 1 is saying not because I desire a
[1:23:08] gift but I desire fruit that may abound
[1:23:12] to your
[1:23:17] account amen amen so Paul is clear here
[1:23:23] and I think when I'm saying also I'm
[1:23:27] clear I'm not seeking gift to bring me
[1:23:30] money or
[1:23:33] whatever in saying
[1:23:36] so I desire
[1:23:40] fruit that may abound to your
[1:23:44] account because what you are
[1:23:47] giv is going into your
[1:23:51] account if the Bible say whosoever give
[1:23:55] a glass of
[1:23:59] water will be blessed how much more if
[1:24:03] you really give a
[1:24:08] Thanksgiving oh Pastor I heard
[1:24:13] thisor I feel like this we have a bunch
[1:24:16] of ministers in the church as
[1:24:19] well we have needy people also Among Us
[1:24:24] bless
[1:24:25] you you pay your whatever contribution
[1:24:28] you
[1:24:29] pay don't overlook
[1:24:34] Thanksgiving oh go see a brother go see
[1:24:37] a
[1:24:38] sister God has put this in my
[1:24:42] heart not young people going to give a
[1:24:44] gift to the
[1:24:48] sisters God has put this in my
[1:24:51] heart but behind your
[1:24:54] mind I'm this offering prayer with
[1:25:00] Thanksgiving but in your mind you are
[1:25:03] going to attract you want to attract the
[1:25:05] sister
[1:25:07] attention no not that so Verse
[1:25:11] 18 but I have all and
[1:25:17] abound and I'm
[1:25:20] full having receive
[1:25:30] of the things which were sent from
[1:25:35] you in order of a sweet
[1:25:40] smell a sacrifice acceptable well
[1:25:44] pleasing to
[1:25:47] God that's why Paul is
[1:25:50] saying I have received
[1:25:57] ofus that the good
[1:26:00] brother the thing which were sent from
[1:26:04] you that Paul said I've received it with
[1:26:07] like a good
[1:26:10] order PA did not refuse or reject
[1:26:16] things because he has
[1:26:18] plenty said but I have all and
[1:26:23] abound I am a
[1:26:25] full but I've received of
[1:26:31] epaphroditus the think which were sent
[1:26:34] from
[1:26:36] you as a order of a sweet
[1:26:41] smell a
[1:26:43] sacrifice acceptable sacrif AC well
[1:26:48] pleasing to
[1:26:50] God but my God
[1:26:53] shall supply all your need according to
[1:26:56] his riches in Glory by Christ
[1:27:05] Jesus amen amen so that's really what
[1:27:09] Paul had in
[1:27:12] mind to serve
[1:27:14] god with uh offering
[1:27:19] Thanksgiving
[1:27:20] Etc and also so in the book of
[1:27:23] Philippians chapter
[1:27:26] 2 Paul is telling
[1:27:29] people whenever you do those
[1:27:32] things do it
[1:27:35] freely don't feel any
[1:27:38] pressure that's why he said Philippians
[1:27:42] 2
[1:27:45] verse4 do all
[1:27:48] things without murmuring and disputing
[1:27:55] don't
[1:27:56] give the
[1:28:00] pastor and he doesn't see this
[1:28:04] economy things are
[1:28:07] critical God knows but God also use Paul
[1:28:11] to speak to
[1:28:15] us amen amen so the more the better
[1:28:18] sacrifice the the sacrifice God will see
[1:28:22] that you give with a pure
[1:28:26] heart and God is going to bless
[1:28:30] you and Paul wrote the
[1:28:34] things in reference to his
[1:28:38] situation to his
[1:28:41] condition and uh being in a need in a
[1:28:46] prison because Paul could not do
[1:28:49] much but if you read other writings of
[1:28:54] Paul Paul was
[1:28:57] working and he said I'm not coming to
[1:28:59] you as a
[1:29:02] beggar and Paul was saying also to the
[1:29:08] Thessalonians that you have to
[1:29:10] work don't be uh and somebody who
[1:29:14] doesn't want to
[1:29:17] work don't don't let him
[1:29:20] eat at the mercy of
[1:29:24] somebody you are grown up
[1:29:27] enough even you live with your
[1:29:30] parents you are working help them out
[1:29:35] contribute and they see the people I
[1:29:38] want to get
[1:29:39] married yeah when you get married your
[1:29:42] money you will be sharing with your
[1:29:45] wife you start working you never even
[1:29:49] buy
[1:29:50] a a suit to your own
[1:29:56] dad a suit to your
[1:29:59] mother that's why people who come I want
[1:30:01] to get married I want to get
[1:30:04] married have you what you have done so
[1:30:08] far for your parents if you have not
[1:30:11] done
[1:30:12] anything I know it's going to be a
[1:30:16] conflict between you and maybe your
[1:30:18] family and your
[1:30:20] wife
[1:30:22] when you they will see your wife
[1:30:23] dressing
[1:30:25] up and your mother
[1:30:28] looking this boy if he knew this pain I
[1:30:32] went through with his in his
[1:30:35] life when I say ask
[1:30:38] something
[1:30:41] nothing listen young people before you
[1:30:44] can get
[1:30:46] married this an opportunity to help to
[1:30:49] do something also for your family
[1:30:54] yes that's the
[1:30:56] gospel you are unable to abstain to
[1:31:00] their
[1:31:03] needs and but you come always I want to
[1:31:06] get married when they say wait no no no
[1:31:10] no that's why we find more trouble in
[1:31:17] marriages that was not the
[1:31:19] subject but uh let me close
[1:31:22] up uh this short
[1:31:27] exhortation that I titled prayer and
[1:31:30] supplication with
[1:31:37] Thanksgiving uh to stress out a little
[1:31:40] bit
[1:31:42] Thanksgiving and my
[1:31:44] prayer God to inspire
[1:31:49] you to find something
[1:31:54] every time you have a
[1:31:57] hardship something
[1:32:00] special for the advancement of God
[1:32:04] kingdom not all together about
[1:32:07] money but it can be also other type of
[1:32:12] gift and uh maybe also your
[1:32:16] time Etc to be spent for the advancement
[1:32:21] of the
[1:32:24] gospel take time to go witness to
[1:32:27] somebody for
[1:32:30] example if you can win a soul for the
[1:32:34] for
[1:32:36] God that will not be forgotten by
[1:32:42] God amen amen may God bless you so let
[1:32:47] us get on our
[1:32:50] knees or whatever position is more
[1:32:52] convenient for
[1:32:56] you uh to

[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:12] no we want to thank
[2:11:15] you for Paul
[2:11:18] Paul this great
[2:11:22] messenger who has written many
[2:11:26] letters and we pray that you help
[2:11:29] us as we study those uh
[2:11:35] scriptures not just the
[2:11:39] scholars but as your
[2:11:42] bride because this letter of to the
[2:11:47] Philippians was addressed to the
[2:11:52] Saints to the
[2:11:55] Bishops to the
[2:11:58] deacons and let each one of us take this
[2:12:04] seriously everything that is there
[2:12:08] in so that father it can help us with
[2:12:12] our
[2:12:14] walk you have put in us this the desire
[2:12:17] to dedicate this time for
[2:12:22] prayer to stress out prayer and
[2:12:26] supplication with
[2:12:33] Thanksgiving Inspire your
[2:12:38] people for
[2:12:41] Thanksgiving and I know the spirit could
[2:12:44] not speak in
[2:12:47] vain you have seen that many of our
[2:12:50] prayers and supplication are lacking
[2:12:58] Thanksgiving and that's the reason why
[2:13:00] maybe
[2:13:03] father we don't get what we are asking
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:08] for and father we are very very
[2:13:12] conscious this during this time of
[2:13:16] Crisis many don't have
[2:13:18] jobs many have lost
[2:13:21] jobs their hours has been
[2:13:25] cut but this is the time you have chosen
[2:13:28] for us to speak on the
[2:13:32] things and you are the only one who know
[2:13:34] the reason
[2:13:37] behind and you know whom you want
[2:13:40] to
[2:13:43] exalt and father in everything let your
[2:13:48] will be
[2:13:50] done we don't want just to give because
[2:13:53] we have to do without
[2:13:58] Revelation but I pray that you touch
[2:14:02] every person who's going to listen to
[2:14:04] this
[2:14:05] [Music]
[2:14:08] recording to receive it
[2:14:13] positively for their own
[2:14:16] benefit for their own fruit as Paul
[2:14:23] said help them
