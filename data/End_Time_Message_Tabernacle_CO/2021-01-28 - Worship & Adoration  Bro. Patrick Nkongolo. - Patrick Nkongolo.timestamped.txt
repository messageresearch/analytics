[49:00] yeah it was about the story of the
[49:04] the the cousins users italy steward

[49:12] the rich man
[49:16] all of together is working for the
[49:19] preparation for your rapture
[49:23] preparation don't expect people to

[50:05] with the denomination
[50:09] those fanatics of william branham he
[50:11] said financing the william branham
