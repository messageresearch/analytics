[0:06] so
[0:26] [Music]
[0:27] i've stood on the banks
[0:30] of a wide-ranging river
[0:34] trusting that i'd get across
[0:40] i've weighed my way
[0:42] through some valleys and deserts
[0:47] believing
[0:48] i never get lost
[0:51] [Music]
[0:53] i've been at the foot
[0:56] of what felt like mount everest

[3:21] to descend and survive
[3:25] to come through a lot
