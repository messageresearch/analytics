[11:51] [Music]
[11:59] 42. As the art penteth after the
[12:03] waterbrooks, soth my soul after thee, oh
[12:07] God, my soul thieth of God for the
[12:10] living God. When shall I come and appear
[12:14] before God? My tears have been my midst
[12:18] day and night. While they continually
[12:20] say unto me, "Where is thy God?" When I
[12:24] remember this thing, I pour out my soul
[12:26] in me. For I had gone with the
[12:29] multitude. I went with them to the house
[12:32] of God with the voice of joy and praise,
[12:36] with a multitude that kept holy. Why art
[12:39] thou cast down, oh my soul, and why art
[12:42] thou discredited in me? Hope thou in
[12:46] God, for I shall yet praise him for the
[12:49] help of his countenance. Oh my God, my
[12:53] soul is cast down within me. Therefore
[12:56] will I remember thee from the land of
[12:59] Jordan and of the Hermonite from the
[13:02] hill. Deep callst unto deep at the noise
[13:06] of thy
[13:07] waters. All that wave and that belows
[13:11] are gone over me. Yet the Lord will
[13:14] command this loving kindness in the
[13:16] daytime and in the night his song shall
[13:20] be with me and my prayer unto the God of
[13:24] my life.

[58:46] we have uh pastor
[58:55] Gideon. Uh he's going to be with us this
[58:59] entire
[59:02] week. So we are going to have meeting
[59:05] with him this morning.
[59:10] Wednesday
[59:12] and uh we we start the Easter services
[59:16] on Friday night 6:50 p.m.
[59:26] 6:50
[59:29] and Saturday at the same time
[59:34] and next Sunday there will be two
[59:37] services.
[59:40] The first service will be the sunrising
[59:43] service
[59:47] from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m.
[59:53] [Music]
[59:55] And then we will have a breakfast
[1:00:01] and then we start our regular service at
[1:00:10] 10. Uh so if uh you can take first the
[1:00:14] Bible with me.
[1:00:18] You may remain seated.
[1:00:22] In the book of Matthew chapter 21,
[1:00:28] uh we read the first 11 verses.
[1:00:35] Uh this is a great week.
[1:00:41] A great week.
[1:00:45] Uh that uh if we picture that in the
[1:00:49] time of the Bible
[1:00:55] you will see
[1:00:57] before Easter.
[1:01:02] Uh this is the last Sunday before that
[1:01:09] what people are celebrating saying it's
[1:01:12] uh the Sunday the palm Sunday service
[1:01:16] whatever it is
[1:01:26] Yes. Uh the word came from the fact that
[1:01:30] people saw Jesus entering into
[1:01:34] Jerusalem.
[1:01:42] It was a
[1:01:44] victorious coming into
[1:01:47] Jerusalem.
[1:01:50] People were shouting,
[1:01:54] glorifying. Uh some took uh clothes and
[1:01:57] laid them
[1:02:03] down. And Jesus on the back of a donkey
[1:02:06] was coming to Jerusalem for the great
[1:02:09] event.
[1:02:18] Amen. Amen. And then uh following the
[1:02:22] week
[1:02:25] uh on I believe uh Thursday
[1:02:30] uh he washed the feet of the disciples
[1:02:35] and Friday that's the crucifixion
[1:02:40] and
[1:02:42] uh Sunday morning
[1:02:46] that was the resurrection
[1:02:48] resurrection
[1:02:49] And then
[1:02:51] came Pentecost.
[1:02:55] Amen. So all these historical events,
[1:03:03] we want to bring them up to present
[1:03:09] time. Uh thinking about why Jesus came
[1:03:14] on this world.
[1:03:19] and that week what was taking place in
[1:03:26] Jerusalem and that was the trial
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:36] trial. He went to court.
[1:03:40] Uh they sentenced him
[1:03:44] and they crucified him.
[1:03:48] But next Sunday
[1:03:52] that was the
[1:03:53] resurrection resurrection. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:56] So the Bible said this. And when they
[1:03:58] drew night into Jerusalem and were come
[1:04:01] to
[1:04:03] betai unto the mount of olives, then
[1:04:07] sent Jesus two disciples.
[1:04:21] saying unto them, "Go into the village
[1:04:23] over against you, and straight away ye
[1:04:27] shall find a tied and a cold with her,
[1:04:31] lose them, and bring them unto me.
[1:04:45] And if any man say unto you, ye shall
[1:04:49] say, the Lord has need of them, and
[1:04:53] straight away he will send them.
[1:05:04] All this was done that it might be
[1:05:07] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:05:10] prophet
[1:05:19] saying, "Tell ye the daughter of Zion,
[1:05:23] Behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek,
[1:05:27] and sitting upon us, And they called the
[1:05:30] fall of an ass.
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:46] And the disciples went and did as Jesus
[1:05:49] commanded them.
[1:05:56] And brought the ice and the cold and put
[1:05:59] on them their clothes. And they set him
[1:06:02] there on.
[1:06:12] And a very great multitude spread their
[1:06:15] garments in the way. Others cut down
[1:06:19] branches from the trees and store them
[1:06:22] in the way.
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:38] And the multitude that went before and
[1:06:42] that follow cry saying, "Hosana, the son
[1:06:46] of David. Bless he, blessed is he that
[1:06:50] cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana
[1:06:54] in the highest.
[1:07:08] And when he he was come into Jerusalem,
[1:07:12] all the city was moved saying, "Who is
[1:07:16] this?"
[1:07:25] And the multitude said, "This is Jesus."
[1:07:28] Amen. The prophet of Nazareth of
[1:07:35] Galilee. Nazareth Galilee. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:40] So that was
[1:07:41] the entrance into Jerusalem.
[1:07:47] And you can see how people welcome him.
[1:07:53] Amen. This is how we need to welcome him
[1:07:56] all the time.
[1:08:02] They took benches
[1:08:06] waving and they put clothes on and so
[1:08:09] that he can walk
[1:08:12] on and crying
[1:08:17] hosana. They were not
[1:08:20] quiet. Amen. We don't just come in the
[1:08:23] church to be quiet.
[1:08:28] We have to
[1:08:29] cryosana blessed be his
[1:08:32] name. We glorify him
[1:08:36] because he is the only one who deserve
[1:08:38] all the
[1:08:40] praises and in the midst of acclamation
[1:08:43] and
[1:08:46] praises. If you continue to
[1:08:49] read, he enter in the temple
[1:08:53] and he cast out all those people were
[1:08:56] praying in the
[1:09:00] temple and he start healing the
[1:09:03] people. Amen. Amen. If you are sick this
[1:09:08] morning, just praise
[1:09:10] him. Hosana
[1:09:15] and receive your healing.
[1:09:17] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:09:21] So we need really to be prepared for
[1:09:24] this week.
[1:09:28] Uh that all the m Easter
[1:09:32] meetings until next Sunday the
[1:09:35] resurrection.

[1:16:37] Amen. May God bless the reading of his
[1:16:40] word. You may be
[1:16:47] seated. We are going to title our
[1:16:55] inspiration. Jacob woke up and changed
[1:16:58] loose into
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:04] beta. Lose means a tree that bears
[1:17:08] certain kind of food.
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:17] Fruit
[1:17:18] that city was called that way because uh
[1:17:21] that's where the the the fruit was uh
[1:17:23] being bur.
[1:17:28] and the inhabitant of this
[1:17:32] city. They could only see the
[1:17:38] trees and they were enjoying the fruit
[1:17:40] of these
[1:17:44] trees. And when Jacob got to that
[1:17:47] city and that city of those kind of
[1:17:52] fruits, he slept there.
[1:17:56] because the hours was well advanced.
[1:18:01] He wasn't there is the destination final
[1:18:06] destination. He left Basha to go going
[1:18:09] to
[1:18:11] Karen but somewhere in the middle he had
[1:18:14] to rest a little
[1:18:16] bit while he was sleeping.
[1:18:25] He saw the letter from the earth to the
[1:18:28] to
[1:18:30] heaven and God was at the top of the
[1:18:35] ladder. The angels were going up and
[1:18:40] down noticing that
[1:18:44] experience when he woke up.
[1:18:49] I want you to notice
[1:18:52] It did not say Jacob woke
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:57] up but woken
[1:19:01] up because that's where my message
[1:19:05] lay. They didn't say Jacob rose
[1:19:09] up but he woke
[1:19:13] up. Are we together?
[1:19:16] I'm not talking about the revival.
[1:19:20] I'm talking about the waking
[1:19:23] up. I woke
[1:19:25] up and he
[1:19:29] said, "This place is
[1:19:34] dreadful. God is in this
[1:19:38] place and I did not know it." Think
[1:19:41] about
[1:19:42] it. Are we together?
[1:19:46] The inhabitants of L.
[1:19:50] They could only see the trees,
[1:19:53] they were used to those kind of fruits
[1:19:56] and with the
[1:19:59] almond. But
[1:20:02] Jacob and m the
[1:20:05] almond and the
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:11] trees. He took conscious of another
[1:20:15] reality. He did not
[1:20:18] say the Lord had just come.
[1:20:22] But he said the Lord is in this
[1:20:25] place. But I did not know
[1:20:29] it. God did not come right there at that
[1:20:32] moment. But God was already
[1:20:37] there. But the people living there, they
[1:20:39] didn't know it. But
[1:20:44] Jacob when he's so conscious of this
[1:20:47] reality are we
[1:20:49] together as
[1:20:53] inhabitants they could only see the
[1:20:55] natural side of
[1:20:57] it. They could only see the material
[1:21:00] side of
[1:21:01] it. The almond and the fruit of it. But
[1:21:06] the meat of all
[1:21:07] this there was another reality.
[1:21:12] They were not well
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:21] sacious of this
[1:21:23] reality that was already there and he
[1:21:27] said his
[1:21:31] place is in this place and I
[1:21:36] I did not know it. Amen.
[1:21:40] He has seen angels going up and coming
[1:21:45] down on the ladder. Are we
[1:21:49] together? And when Jesus came, he said
[1:21:52] the same thing. If thou believe, you
[1:21:55] will see angels going up and descending
[1:21:58] upon the son of
[1:22:00] man. Somebody still with me. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:06] And Jacob said since God is in this
[1:22:11] place, he changed the name of the city.
[1:22:14] Are we together?
[1:22:16] The city was called
[1:22:18] Lose. But after this
[1:22:20] experience, Jacob
[1:22:22] said now his name
[1:22:25] Bethl because Bethl
[1:22:28] means the house of God.
[1:22:31] Are we together?
[1:22:35] And when he discovered that, he said,
[1:22:37] "Therefore, if God keeps me, if gives me
[1:22:43] food and dress or clothes through, if he
[1:22:48] keeps me on the journey and brings me
[1:22:51] back, I will bring the tide of God
[1:22:54] here. I want to tell somebody before
[1:22:57] going further. When you
[1:23:00] discover that God is here and this
[1:23:03] church is the house of God,
[1:23:08] then you bring the touch of everything
[1:23:09] that you receive. Are we still
[1:23:12] together? Somebody still with me this
[1:23:18] morning. I'm reminding you that the Lord
[1:23:22] was not there at that
[1:23:24] moment, but he was he has been there
[1:23:27] before but people did not know it.
[1:23:31] Even Jacob himself did not know it.
[1:23:33] Until he discover he had that
[1:23:35] experience. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:39] They awakened.
[1:23:43] It's not the fact of uh waking up from
[1:23:46] sleep.
[1:23:48] You can be
[1:23:50] awake but the people of LS was sleeping.
[1:23:53] They were waking
[1:23:54] up but they never took conscious of God
[1:23:57] was there.
[1:24:01] They
[1:24:03] awakened. It's not the fact of sleeping
[1:24:06] and res rising up. They were raising up
[1:24:10] every morning but they did not know God
[1:24:12] was there.
[1:24:15] But Jacob woke up.
[1:24:18] He noticed God was
[1:24:20] there. He changed loose to Beth. Amen.
[1:24:24] Amen.
[1:24:25] Then the they
[1:24:28] awaken. It's coming out of
[1:24:31] sleep with being conscious of another
[1:24:37] reality. A reality of an invisible
[1:24:40] dimension.
[1:24:42] Are we
[1:24:43] together? Are are you ready?
[1:24:48] Benam says
[1:24:50] in the resurrection of Lazarus.
[1:24:56] I'm saying to be awakened is taking
[1:24:58] conscious of the invisible
[1:25:01] dimension. You're not seeing just the
[1:25:03] trees, natural
[1:25:05] trees,
[1:25:07] trees, but you see God there. Amen.
[1:25:13] in the message the resurrection of
[1:25:14] Lazarus
[1:25:18] uh November 20 22nd 53
[1:25:24] paragraph uh 36 second
[1:25:27] part is saying
[1:25:31] this God always war send always send his
[1:25:35] warning are we
[1:25:38] together God always send his warning
[1:25:42] Just before the coming of
[1:25:44] Jesus, he sent an angel down out of the
[1:25:47] heaven by the name of Gabriel.
[1:25:49] Now, my minor angels comes mine. Yes,
[1:25:55] you see
[1:25:56] angels now be with me. Are you
[1:25:59] ready?
[1:26:01] Says,
[1:26:03] "Everyone has a guardian
[1:26:09] angel. Is there anybody
[1:26:12] here? Is there anybody here? What says
[1:26:17] everyone has an
[1:26:21] angel? Say with me, I have an
[1:26:25] angel. Repeat that with me. I have an
[1:26:27] angel.
[1:26:29] Hallelujah. I know what I'm
[1:26:32] doing. Be conscious of that
[1:26:36] dimension or else you're going to leave
[1:26:38] the way you came.
[1:26:41] Even if you don't see that
[1:26:43] angel, just begin to believe he's
[1:26:46] there. Begin to believe you have an
[1:26:50] angel. If you don't believe that you
[1:26:53] have an angel, that's your
[1:26:55] problem. That's how depends all the the
[1:26:58] meetings. Are we together? Repeat that.
[1:27:01] I have an angel.
[1:27:05] even though you don't see it,
[1:27:08] you can feel
[1:27:10] it. But what I'm saying
[1:27:12] here, God always send warnings. Sometime
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:17] say somebody something was telling me to
[1:27:20] do something but I
[1:27:22] didn't. What is that thing that was
[1:27:24] telling you? It was the
[1:27:27] angel. The angel always send
[1:27:30] warnings, always speak to us one way or
[1:27:36] another. But we are not exercised to
[1:27:38] catch his
[1:27:40] voice. It's not that the angel will
[1:27:43] come. The angel is already
[1:27:45] there. You don't know it. This
[1:27:49] morning, I want somebody to say, "The
[1:27:53] Lord was already there, but I do not
[1:27:55] know it." Are we together?
[1:27:59] Repeat that again. I have an angel. Now
[1:28:01] listen, if everybody has an angel
[1:28:05] now, that means this room is full of
[1:28:08] full of angels.
[1:28:10] There are angels
[1:28:12] everywhere. I I want you to be conscious
[1:28:15] of
[1:28:16] it because what the rest depends on
[1:28:19] that. Are we still together? Are we
[1:28:22] together? Whatever say somewhere else,
[1:28:26] the whole building is full of
[1:28:28] angels. The
[1:28:30] angels that on every aisles, the
[1:28:34] angels or every
[1:28:37] seat are we
[1:28:39] together. Believe that you have an
[1:28:43] angel. You
[1:28:46] know, don't expect you don't expect to
[1:28:49] see it to believe it. believe
[1:28:51] it because sometime our vision can lie
[1:28:54] to
[1:28:55] us by faith does not
[1:28:58] lie. The word does not
[1:29:03] lie. Don't wait for the sign of healing
[1:29:06] to believe that you are
[1:29:08] healed. Believe that you're healed
[1:29:10] because God said so.
[1:29:15] The improvement of your health,
[1:29:17] it's not the sign of your healing.
[1:29:20] He can get better a little
[1:29:22] bit and he get worse after and somebody
[1:29:26] dies and they start
[1:29:29] saying it was getting
[1:29:31] better. If it's getting
[1:29:34] better, it's not the sign of the
[1:29:37] healing. The proof that you are
[1:29:39] healed is the word that says you are
[1:29:43] healed. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:46] Yes, my brothers and
[1:29:48] sisters. Repeat that with me again. I
[1:29:50] have an
[1:29:51] angel. Says, everyone has a guardian
[1:29:58] angel. When you go out and come back,
[1:30:01] that's the same angel keeping
[1:30:04] you when you sleep and wake up. That's
[1:30:07] the angel keeping
[1:30:11] you in the message, the authority of the
[1:30:13] word.
[1:30:16] June uh 10 June uh 2nd June 53
[1:30:22] paragraph 8 better says let's bow our
[1:30:25] head once more time one more
[1:30:27] time he say
[1:30:32] Lord in whom we take delight to call up
[1:30:35] thee to call on
[1:30:40] thee our heart just melt with love when
[1:30:44] we think of your great
[1:30:47] grace that you have had toward Adam
[1:30:50] fallen
[1:30:56] race. How the father gave his son as
[1:30:59] ransom there at
[1:31:03] Calvary to take away the sin of the
[1:31:05] world and to heal the sick and
[1:31:07] afflicted.
[1:31:08] Now listen. He
[1:31:12] said, "And how down through the age,
[1:31:18] every time a great stir steering has
[1:31:22] been in the church, not just a
[1:31:26] revival, a
[1:31:28] steering has been in the church. There
[1:31:31] has been healings,
[1:31:33] miracles, and
[1:31:36] signs. Every time people take conscious
[1:31:40] of the presence of God,
[1:31:44] listen, people are getting healed
[1:31:46] without laying on
[1:31:49] hands. They are getting healed without a
[1:31:51] special
[1:31:53] prayer because the thing that heals not
[1:31:56] the hands but it's the presence of
[1:31:59] God. Every time a great steering has
[1:32:02] been in the church,
[1:32:05] people are too conscious of the presence
[1:32:06] of God.
[1:32:08] There have been a lot of healings,
[1:32:10] miracles,
[1:32:13] signs I down through the ages where you
[1:32:16] came.
[1:32:18] There was miracles,
[1:32:20] signs and wonders. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:26] These are the things that happens when
[1:32:28] people to take conscious of the presence
[1:32:30] of God. Now listen, the prophet
[1:32:35] Elijah never
[1:32:38] prayed for God to come,
[1:32:41] for the fire to come, for the chariots
[1:32:44] to
[1:32:45] come. When his servant told
[1:32:49] him, we are surrendered by Syrian
[1:32:53] army. Elijah did not say, God, send the
[1:32:56] chariots of fire, be still, be with me.
[1:32:59] He did not say God God send angels or
[1:33:03] please God send the fire. He
[1:33:06] said open the eyes of the
[1:33:09] servant so that he can see the reality
[1:33:12] that hasn't been
[1:33:14] there.
[1:33:17] Elijah was in contact with that
[1:33:20] dimension. The chariots were there. The
[1:33:24] fire were
[1:33:25] there but the servant could not see it.
[1:33:29] He was like a people
[1:33:31] loose. He had to be awake to take
[1:33:34] conscious
[1:33:36] of this presence and things was
[1:33:40] changed. But when his eyes were
[1:33:44] opened, Elijah said, "You see, people
[1:33:48] are are with us. They're in great
[1:33:50] numbers.
[1:33:52] the people that with them. But I want
[1:33:55] you to
[1:33:57] understand, the chariot just did not
[1:33:59] come at that
[1:34:01] moment. They were already there.
[1:34:06] But the servant did not know it.
[1:34:09] But Elisha knew it.
[1:34:12] Somebody still with me.
[1:34:16] I see God this morning will do
[1:34:18] something. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:21] Yes, my brothers and
[1:34:23] sisters is preaching a message.
[1:34:27] The attitude and who is God.
[1:34:30] As we are moving
[1:34:33] forward,
[1:34:35] August
[1:34:38] 1950 paragraph nine.
[1:34:42] Granted, Father
[1:34:45] tonight, let a lot of things happen.
[1:34:50] Are we together?
[1:34:53] Let a lot of things be done.
[1:34:56] Send your spirits.
[1:34:58] Give people faith. Amen.
[1:35:06] Amen. Sometime it it startled
[1:35:09] them. Now listen now.
[1:35:16] Father, they can't realize the presence
[1:35:19] of this great
[1:35:21] thing. He's already
[1:35:24] there. But people don't realize of this
[1:35:27] presence, this great
[1:35:30] being, the Jehovah of the Old
[1:35:33] Testament, Jesus of the
[1:35:36] New, the Holy Spirit of this day,
[1:35:41] standing here tonight,
[1:35:45] to make good any promise that you have
[1:35:47] made.
[1:35:49] Bless us
[1:35:50] Lord. Now I'm take paragraph 21 to save
[1:35:54] some
[1:35:55] time.
[1:35:57] People are not taking
[1:35:59] cautions. He say well
[1:36:02] now no
[1:36:05] wonder
[1:36:09] cripples when you realize
[1:36:13] that you can straighten
[1:36:17] out. They are not straightened out
[1:36:19] because they have been anointed with
[1:36:21] oil not because they lay hand on
[1:36:25] them but when they realize the presence
[1:36:28] of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:32] They straighten up. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:36] The creator is here.
[1:36:39] No
[1:36:41] wonder blind that can
[1:36:44] see opens up
[1:36:47] because the creator's here. The
[1:36:51] creator realize who the Bible
[1:36:55] say we are sons and daughters of God.
[1:36:59] as offspring. Now
[1:37:03] we are something like God was.
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:10] When you are son of God, you are like
[1:37:11] God.
[1:37:13] Amen.
[1:37:14] Amen. Jesus said himself, it is
[1:37:19] written, you are
[1:37:22] God's. Written in your love.
[1:37:26] We become a part of God,
[1:37:30] a son of God by
[1:37:32] adoption through Jesus
[1:37:35] Christ.
[1:37:37] Therefore, if you realize,
[1:37:41] that's the
[1:37:43] problem, if you realize that the very
[1:37:46] God that created the dirt, the earth,
[1:37:50] and whatever it
[1:37:53] is living among men,
[1:37:57] Where's your faith
[1:37:58] at? If you realize that God is
[1:38:02] here, you will come every
[1:38:05] day. You will live with
[1:38:08] solutions even without special
[1:38:10] prayer. Because the presence of
[1:38:14] God is being conscious of that
[1:38:18] presence that does something
[1:38:22] that does change loose to Beth. Amen.
[1:38:24] Amen.
[1:38:28] In question answer on Hebrew.
[1:38:33] In question and answer on Hebrew
[1:38:37] part
[1:38:40] three paragraph
[1:38:43] 634 I'm talking about realizing take it
[1:38:48] conscious at a certain time we will see
[1:38:51] how it will happen.
[1:38:55] Or if the
[1:38:56] great if the great holy church only
[1:39:00] realized only
[1:39:02] realize it's power to do
[1:39:07] things. Don't ask for power. The power
[1:39:11] is already
[1:39:12] there. We just don't realize it.
[1:39:16] If we can only
[1:39:18] realize the power we have to do these
[1:39:21] things
[1:39:24] says. But there is so much
[1:39:27] doubt and
[1:39:29] fear and
[1:39:33] trembling wondering if it will could
[1:39:36] happen or not. Will it happen or could
[1:39:40] it
[1:39:41] happen? Will it happen? Could happen.
[1:39:44] Adam
[1:39:48] says as long as that exists, the church
[1:39:51] can never stand
[1:39:53] upright. As long as you doubt, as long
[1:39:56] as you fear, as long as you
[1:40:00] wonder, faith does not ask
[1:40:04] questions. How? It's not faith
[1:40:08] business. When God says it, how will do
[1:40:11] it? It's none of my business.
[1:40:15] If when God says it, God knows how will
[1:40:18] do it, I will believe it and I move
[1:40:21] forward says sometime we wonder how a
[1:40:25] cow, how a black
[1:40:28] cow will eat
[1:40:31] dark wheat,
[1:40:35] but he has a red
[1:40:37] blood and white milk.
[1:40:42] Who can explain it?
[1:40:44] though I don't understand it reality but
[1:40:46] it's the
[1:40:48] reality. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:52] Yes, my
[1:40:54] beloved. How? It's none of my business.
[1:40:57] When God makes the promise, the believer
[1:41:00] believe it and he moves
[1:41:03] forward. If God says you have an
[1:41:06] angel, start walking being conscious of
[1:41:09] that angel. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:13] You are sure no matter the problem, I
[1:41:16] got an angel
[1:41:18] and it's a guardian angel.
[1:41:20] Are we together?
[1:41:22] Is an angel to keep me safe.
[1:41:25] A body God. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:29] You are not
[1:41:31] whosoever. You are not anybody.
[1:41:34] You have a body God. He is an angel.
[1:41:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:40] He's there to keep you.
[1:41:42] No wonder, no ask yourself question.
[1:41:45] Don't be afraid.
[1:41:48] Every time Jesus intervene, he always
[1:41:51] says fear not is I when is
[1:41:56] him fear lives. Amen.
[1:42:01] Amen. You don't
[1:42:03] question
[1:42:07] says when every talk of fear is vanished
[1:42:18] and the Holy Spirit completely in
[1:42:19] control of the
[1:42:22] church then all fields are
[1:42:25] gone and that church
[1:42:28] has the power. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:33] See
[1:42:35] why people are here the way you
[1:42:40] are they have everything that heaven
[1:42:44] owns behind
[1:42:46] them I don't know if you feel
[1:42:49] that behind
[1:42:52] you everything heaven behold held
[1:42:57] don't look like on anybody
[1:43:00] Amen. Everything heaven
[1:43:04] owns to go with you at work,
[1:43:08] to be with you when you
[1:43:10] travel, and everything that you do. Be
[1:43:14] conscious that you have behind you,

[1:43:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:32] Of the throne, my brothers,
[1:43:35] the throne of God, the great throne.
[1:43:40] The ambassadors of the throne.
[1:43:44] Absolutely. A beloved say,
[1:43:47] an ambassador of
[1:43:49] Christ has the authority.
[1:43:52] Do we have one here? Do we have an
[1:43:54] ambassador here?
[1:43:56] Then say I have an authority. Amen.
[1:44:00] He has the authority.
[1:44:03] And everything that Christ owns
[1:44:06] belongs to that
[1:44:08] ambassador. Everything that Christ owns
[1:44:11] belongs to
[1:44:12] you as an
[1:44:16] individuality. If you're not conscious
[1:44:18] of that
[1:44:19] reality, you will lose the battle all
[1:44:22] the time. Amen.
[1:44:25] Yes, my brothers and sisters, this is
[1:44:28] the exact truth.
[1:44:30] It's being conscious.
[1:44:32] It's the awaken of your conscience.
[1:44:34] Amen. Yes.
[1:44:37] They awaken of your conscience that
[1:44:39] changes

[1:45:04] me and by
[1:45:08] faith we'll leave this building in the
[1:45:11] rapture. Are we together? I'll come back
[1:45:15] to
[1:45:16] that. One day whatever was there in
[1:45:19] front of prayer line they brought a a
[1:45:22] blind girl. He started praying the the
[1:45:26] girl did not see after a while she told
[1:45:30] brother
[1:45:31] Benham Bham told brother Neville he said
[1:45:34] brother
[1:45:36] Neville I went to
[1:45:38] heaven while he was
[1:45:40] there he said I took the child by my
[1:45:43] hand I took him to the throne and I took
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:46] blood and applied on your eyes with
[1:45:51] just still
[1:45:53] while he was in my this morning.
[1:45:58] I'm taking you by faith in the rapture.
[1:46:00] Amen.
[1:46:02] By faith,
[1:46:04] in the rapture. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:08] Where things
[1:46:10] happen in an invisible
[1:46:13] dimension where God is real. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:18] While we still sitting
[1:46:21] together in a heavenly places around the
[1:46:24] throne of God, we are here but at the
[1:46:28] same time we are there. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:32] Don't stay stuck
[1:46:34] here. He said we are leaving this
[1:46:38] building in a rapture. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:42] Yes, my brothers and sisters.
[1:46:45] Our heart was warmed
[1:46:48] up many
[1:46:51] times by the things we have seen you
[1:46:59] do and unfold your mysteries to
[1:47:02] us. But Lord
[1:47:05] tonight I'm all
[1:47:07] weary who to
[1:47:09] me. He said, "And
[1:47:15] Jacob, when he saw those angel coming
[1:47:17] down and letter and going back, he said,
[1:47:22] "This is a dreadful
[1:47:25] place none other than the house of
[1:47:29] God and there Bethl was
[1:47:33] established. This
[1:47:35] church, it will just be a building.
[1:47:40] As long as you don't realize God is in
[1:47:43] here
[1:47:45] says the church is just a piece of
[1:47:49] building with the same
[1:47:51] materials, the same material they build
[1:47:53] the house with and
[1:47:56] supermarkets. They are built with the
[1:47:58] same materials. How we stood together.
[1:48:01] Even bars, nightclubs are built with the
[1:48:05] same material. But the difference is the
[1:48:08] presence of
[1:48:10] God. Amen.
[1:48:14] If God is not there,
[1:48:17] it's not different than the
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:23] supermarket. Are we
[1:48:26] together? If God is not
[1:48:28] here, it's not different than a
[1:48:31] supermarket.
[1:48:34] The difference is the presence of God in
[1:48:38] this
[1:48:39] moment. What was just a
[1:48:41] building becomes the house of God in
[1:48:45] that
[1:48:45] time. Roose become
[1:48:48] B.
[1:48:51] Amen. And when you know it's
[1:48:53] Bethl by leaving your place, your
[1:48:56] home, you know I'm going to the house of
[1:48:59] God. you the way you come is different
[1:49:04] and when you come
[1:49:06] differently you will also live
[1:49:08] differently and that will happen all the
[1:49:11] time because God is not a habitual
[1:49:14] God. God is a God of every
[1:49:17] day a new experience every
[1:49:21] day when he taught us to pray he said
[1:49:24] pray and
[1:49:26] say give us our daily bread. Amen.
[1:49:31] Not a meal for all life, all the life,
[1:49:34] but a daily
[1:49:36] life. Every day new
[1:49:38] bread, every day new
[1:49:42] experience, every day new testimony.
[1:49:45] Yes, my brothers and
[1:49:47] sisters, that's the house of
[1:49:49] God. And when you know that
[1:49:52] way, you will come sick and leave
[1:49:56] healed. No, if even even though they
[1:49:58] don't speak about healing, The presence
[1:50:01] there will do
[1:50:03] everything says
[1:50:07] God chose seven
[1:50:09] names to meet all your needs
[1:50:12] the seven compiled names. Amen.
[1:50:16] Amen. And if it's El
[1:50:19] Sh the one is
[1:50:21] here same time Jehovah
[1:50:25] Rafa says the seven compound
[1:50:29] name you cannot separate
[1:50:33] them when it
[1:50:36] comes he did not
[1:50:38] forget he did not
[1:50:41] forget he comes with all the
[1:50:44] names you are sick your heals you. Amen.
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:49] You have a need, he
[1:50:51] provides because listen, all your
[1:50:56] needs are found in the seven compound
[1:50:59] names. Amen.
[1:51:01] Amen. The seven names is the answer to
[1:51:05] all the questions is the solution to all
[1:51:09] problems.
[1:51:11] Yes, my brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:51:14] And when God is there,
[1:51:17] amen and we know he's
[1:51:19] here, we expect him. And every
[1:51:24] day, something happens. Amen. Amen. Yes,
[1:51:28] my brothers and
[1:51:29] sisters, this is
[1:51:32] exact because the angel of
[1:51:34] God ascend and
[1:51:37] descend, they don't say he descend
[1:51:40] ascend, but they
[1:51:48] and the latter touches the the earth and
[1:51:53] the the the the throne. What does he
[1:51:57] mean? He links the earth and
[1:52:01] heaven. He links people with
[1:52:04] God and the angel assist with our
[1:52:07] request and it comes down with the
[1:52:10] answers.
[1:52:15] That's what they do all the time.
[1:52:18] Once you're
[1:52:19] there, once you in the battle, the angel
[1:52:22] ascends with your
[1:52:25] needs. All the needs that you didn't
[1:52:28] express. They ascend with them and they
[1:52:31] come down with angels. They go
[1:52:33] up. That's the
[1:52:35] ministry. They don't get tired.
[1:52:38] They just go up and come down. When they
[1:52:42] go up, they come
[1:52:44] down. Something
[1:52:47] change and desendmotion.
[1:52:50] Something somebody has a promotion, they
[1:52:52] comes down, they go up, they come down,
[1:52:55] somebody's healed. Amen. Amen. Every
[1:52:58] time they go up and comes down,
[1:53:01] something has to change. Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] Yes, my brothers.
[1:53:08] Be cautious of that
[1:53:11] reality. Come
[1:53:14] knowing I'm going where they have a
[1:53:16] light. I have a lot of Jacob. The angel
[1:53:19] go up and
[1:53:20] descend upon the son of man. Yes my
[1:53:23] brothers and
[1:53:24] sisters and we at the well appropriate
[1:53:27] place. The ministry of the son of man
[1:53:31] has been manifested today. It's not for
[1:53:34] nothing. It's to bring back the ladder.
[1:53:37] So that the angel can ascend and
[1:53:40] descend. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:53:44] They ascend with our tears.
[1:53:47] And they comes down with our
[1:53:50] joy. They come down with
[1:53:52] our trouble.
[1:53:55] They ascend with
[1:53:57] them and they come down peace and
[1:54:01] joy
[1:54:03] that overwhelm our hearts. That's what
[1:54:06] they do in the church. That's why they
[1:54:08] do in
[1:54:09] Beth. That is why my
[1:54:12] invitation. You got to live
[1:54:14] loose. You only see almond. You only see
[1:54:18] trees. You only see the natural side of
[1:54:20] it. Go to bed in the heart of God. Amen.
[1:54:25] Amen.
[1:54:26] Yes, my beloved brothers.
[1:54:29] This is the exact truth. Hallelujah.
[1:54:32] Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] Oh, God is wonderful.
[1:54:38] My God is wonderful.
[1:54:40] Do you feel it?
[1:54:45] And awaken that changes lose to
[1:54:48] better taking conscious. But says in the
[1:54:52] third seal
[1:54:55] third
[1:54:56] seal. I haven't started preaching
[1:54:59] yet. My message will not take long. I'm
[1:55:02] just placing foundation so that we can
[1:55:04] all reach the same level.
[1:55:09] March 20, March
[1:55:11] 20, paragraph
[1:55:15] 105, 105 and 183. He says,
[1:55:21] he can do what he wants.
[1:55:24] God, he can do what he wants
[1:55:27] to. Do you believe
[1:55:30] it? God can do what he wants to.
[1:55:35] Repeat that with me. God can do what he
[1:55:37] wants
[1:55:39] to
[1:55:40] God. The
[1:55:43] creator, the only thing to
[1:55:45] do is to just speak it. That's right.
[1:55:50] He's the creator.
[1:55:52] If you pronounce that you are healed,
[1:55:54] you are healed.
[1:56:01] Now, if we just get to realizing how
[1:56:04] great he
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:07] is, realize how great he is, I want to
[1:56:11] tell somebody this morning that came in
[1:56:15] despair with a a great problem. Your
[1:56:19] problem is not greater than Jesus.
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:24] Amen.
[1:56:26] Says if you can only
[1:56:29] realize how great he is,
[1:56:33] you will ignore your problem.
[1:56:38] You will forget that
[1:56:40] problem if you can only realize how
[1:56:43] great he is.
[1:56:46] Oh my brothers and sisters,
[1:56:48] The infinite
[1:56:50] God, the God is unlimited.
[1:56:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:57:03] Amen. If he can just realize how great
[1:57:06] he is, you
[1:57:09] see, he just does what he wished to.
[1:57:12] Amen.
[1:57:16] of 183
[1:57:20] says the bride has not seen the revival
[1:57:23] yet. Amen. Amen.
[1:57:27] You
[1:57:28] see there has been no revival there. Now
[1:57:37] listen, no manifestation of God to steal
[1:57:40] the bride
[1:57:42] yet. That is why I'm making the
[1:57:45] difference between the revival and the
[1:57:47] stirring up.
[1:57:51] It's the awaken that trigger the
[1:57:53] revival.
[1:57:56] If there's no awakening, we don't have
[1:58:00] the
[1:58:02] revival. Say the bread has not Isaiah
[1:58:04] hasn't been seen the revival yet. Why?
[1:58:10] No manifestation of God to steal the
[1:58:12] steal of the bride yet.
[1:58:15] Because when the bride is
[1:58:17] awakened when she takes conscious of the
[1:58:20] presence of God, then the awakening
[1:58:22] happens. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:58:28] Now I was speaking of
[1:58:31] lose. It's a natural
[1:58:33] city where there were a lot of
[1:58:35] almond. There was a lot of almond.
[1:58:39] People were used to have to see those
[1:58:42] trees and to eat almond. But when Jacob
[1:58:45] came around in the midst of the armor
[1:58:49] trees, he's seen the another
[1:58:52] reality in the invisible
[1:58:55] dimension. He was brought in contact
[1:58:58] with that dimension. He changed loose to
[1:59:01] better. It was the same
[1:59:03] city. Some they were living in L. But
[1:59:06] Jacob was living in better. Hallelujah.
[1:59:12] Are we still together?
[1:59:14] Are we together?
[1:59:16] Now I'm going to start preaching. What
[1:59:19] says in invisible union? He said
[1:59:23] God has given us a new
[1:59:25] land. Now leave this the
[1:59:28] history, a new
[1:59:30] land. The message for this hour, this
[1:59:35] message, it's a whole
[1:59:37] land in which we are living
[1:59:40] in. But in this
[1:59:42] land, we have almond trees. We have
[1:59:47] almond and there are people that only
[1:59:50] see those
[1:59:51] trees. But
[1:59:53] today, God need
[1:59:56] Jacob. Beyond almond
[1:59:58] trees, beyond those trees,
[2:00:02] you will see another reality. Amen.
[2:00:05] Amen.
[2:00:07] I want to say something my brothers and
[2:00:09] sisters.
[2:00:11] I've seen a lot of men of God that have
[2:00:13] preached this
[2:00:15] message started saying I I forsake the
[2:00:18] message. I'm leaving the
[2:00:22] message. They have been living in
[2:00:25] ruse. They only see the natural side of
[2:00:28] it.
[2:00:30] They only seen almond trees and
[2:00:33] almonds, but they never had a revelation
[2:00:36] of the person that was a mother. Yes, my
[2:00:39] brothers and
[2:00:40] sisters, great men of
[2:00:42] God, they preached for a
[2:00:45] while. All the message is
[2:00:47] false.
[2:00:52] Lied this. It wasn't true.
[2:00:56] They were just living in loose.
[2:01:00] They could only see the natural side of
[2:01:02] it. They only see
[2:01:04] books. That's what I'm talking about.
[2:01:07] They could only see books. They only see
[2:01:10] pictures and that's
[2:01:12] it. But in the midst of all this, Jacob
[2:01:16] looked he
[2:01:18] said the
[2:01:20] Lord in this message and I do not know
[2:01:25] it.
[2:01:28] Oh my, oh my brothers and sisters, the
[2:01:32] Lord is in this
[2:01:36] message. The major inhabitant of this
[2:01:40] land of this
[2:01:43] message. They live in the midst
[2:01:45] of they wake up in the midst of they eat
[2:01:50] almond.
[2:01:51] They eat coats. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:55] They enjoyed
[2:01:58] it. They have all kinds of
[2:02:01] doctrine.
[2:02:02] But in the midst of all this,
[2:02:06] let me say it.
[2:02:08] I I I live I I'm here with my
[2:02:12] friends. If the message is just
[2:02:15] books, then we are not different from
[2:02:18] Jehovah witnesses.
[2:02:21] I'm going to repeat it.
[2:02:24] If the message just bunch of books,
[2:02:28] there's no difference with Jehovah
[2:02:29] Witness.
[2:02:31] The difference with this message, it's
[2:02:33] the
[2:02:34] angels. It's the supernatural.
[2:02:38] That's the difference with Jehovah
[2:02:41] witness. It's the holy message where the
[2:02:44] angel ascend and descend. Hallelujah.
[2:02:48] Because the angels,
[2:02:50] they only ascend and descend on the son
[2:02:53] of
[2:02:55] man. And the Pentecostals,
[2:02:59] they don't have that ministry. The
[2:03:01] Protestants, they don't have that
[2:03:02] ministry. Catholics, the Catholic, they
[2:03:05] don't have that ministry. The
[2:03:07] angels
[2:03:09] and the son of man. Hallelujah. That's
[2:03:12] the difference. Hallelujah.
[2:03:17] That's the whole
[2:03:20] difference. If you remove the angels,
[2:03:25] you remove the
[2:03:26] supernatural, you have bunch of
[2:03:30] books. Are we still
[2:03:32] together? Yes, my brothers and sisters.
[2:03:35] That's the exact truth. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:41] Now begins to preach.
[2:03:45] I'm only going to preach with two
[2:03:48] quotes. The first one,
[2:03:51] why?
[2:03:53] Why? Why people are backsliding? Why
[2:03:56] people are leaving?
[2:03:59] Oh, I follow brother
[2:04:01] Bham though you eat with brother
[2:04:03] Bernham. If you backslide, that's your
[2:04:06] business. You you have been living
[2:04:09] loose. I'm not going to be
[2:04:11] influenced. Even if you were sleeping in
[2:04:13] the same bed with
[2:04:15] Renham, that's none of my
[2:04:17] business. You know, when Jesus was on
[2:04:19] the earth, one day a a woman
[2:04:24] came, they only called her the woman for
[2:04:27] blood, they don't know her name until
[2:04:30] today. She came to church that day. She
[2:04:34] was saying to
[2:04:35] herself, "If I could only touch, I would
[2:04:37] be healed."
[2:04:40] Are we still together?
[2:04:42] When she got there, she touched Jesus,
[2:04:45] she was
[2:04:46] healed. That woman, my brother, when I'm
[2:04:49] thinking of that woman, I I'm
[2:04:52] being brother says, she didn't have any
[2:04:57] promise. She didn't have any
[2:05:00] reference. She didn't have the holy
[2:05:04] ghost. It It's It was before the cross.
[2:05:07] It was before the cross.
[2:05:09] She was under this the blood of goats
[2:05:11] and but Jesus was not dead
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:16] yet but she went to
[2:05:19] church saying to
[2:05:22] ourselves how what do you say to
[2:05:24] yourself
[2:05:25] today don't come like that church come
[2:05:29] telling yourself
[2:05:32] something now
[2:05:34] listen that
[2:05:36] woman everything was against her. She
[2:05:39] had a blood issue. And the law was
[2:05:42] saying, the the woman with a blood
[2:05:45] issue. She has to be put away. The woman
[2:05:48] was
[2:05:49] coming, breaking the law.
[2:05:55] Is he getting
[2:05:57] it? Breaking the
[2:05:59] law. She look at the law. I have a blood
[2:06:03] issue. I have to be put
[2:06:06] away. by my only chance to be delivered
[2:06:10] is to touch this man and I have to know
[2:06:14] the
[2:06:15] law I should move people around touch
[2:06:19] Jesus Jesus said who touched me Peter
[2:06:23] said Jesus this is not possible
[2:06:25] anybody's touching you I wanted to
[2:06:28] say touching Jesus is not a
[2:06:31] problem but the way to touch
[2:06:36] [Applause]
[2:06:38] Amen. Amen.
[2:06:41] Touching Jesus is not a problem.
[2:06:43] Everybody's touching you. He said, "No,
[2:06:47] Peter, somebody touched me a very
[2:06:49] special
[2:06:50] way. I felt a special
[2:06:55] touch. A virtue left me.
[2:06:59] No eating with
[2:07:01] bread, sleeping in the same bed. That's
[2:07:03] not a
[2:07:04] problem. It depends on how you realize
[2:07:06] it. That is why my
[2:07:09] brothers, no matter who backslide, I
[2:07:12] will not
[2:07:13] [Applause]
[2:07:15] backslide. Oh no, brother. Oh no. And
[2:07:19] that's not a
[2:07:21] problem. They were living loose. Only
[2:07:24] the concealed
[2:07:26] But Jacob the newcomer. So
[2:07:30] God and they were still in loose. They
[2:07:33] were still
[2:07:37] los. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:41] I am in battle. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:45] Says paragraph 56. Why
[2:07:52] March 1960?
[2:07:57] He said one
[2:08:00] day the trumpet was sound for the last
[2:08:06] time the Bible will be closed and laid
[2:08:09] on the
[2:08:11] pulpit. The actor will play the last
[2:08:15] act. The son will set down at the west.
[2:08:21] The weapon will be gathered for the last
[2:08:23] time. Now listen my
[2:08:26] problem and
[2:08:30] then we will be asked to give a
[2:08:34] reason for what we have
[2:08:38] done with the
[2:08:43] treasures that has been sent to
[2:08:47] us. It's a book of
[2:08:50] treasures. Are we together?
[2:08:55] The Bible is a book of treasures.
[2:08:58] God has given us treasures.
[2:09:02] 167 is praying.
[2:09:05] He said, "Our heavenly
[2:09:08] father, the riches of
[2:09:13] God is sent to us by a letter."
[2:09:17] Now keep this very well.
[2:09:20] When God is sending the riches, the
[2:09:22] treasures, how does he send it?
[2:09:27] By letters.
[2:09:31] The message of the Bible.
[2:09:34] The the the letter is the message of the
[2:09:36] Bible.
[2:09:39] that the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit was
[2:09:41] ordained of God our
[2:09:45] father with the blood of his son Jesus
[2:09:50] to bring us this
[2:09:55] message. He's the true witness of
[2:09:56] Christ. But it's
[2:09:59] written when he the Holy Ghost is come,
[2:10:05] he will bring this thing into your me
[2:10:08] remembrance. Remind
[2:10:14] you that you've got treasures and riches
[2:10:18] untold in the pages of this book. Are we
[2:10:22] together? God has given us treasures
[2:10:25] that we have to give an account.

[2:12:56] businessman and you still living in this

[2:14:25] her why can't he just help you
[2:14:27] out where he said she
[2:14:31] said I just can't ask
[2:14:34] him. I just can't do it.

[2:15:07] letters that any boy could write to his
[2:15:10] mother." And in his letters,
[2:15:14] he tells me how much he loves me.

[2:15:53] "I just can't do
[2:15:54] it. tell my
[2:15:57] son that I'm poverty
[2:16:01] stricken and I just couldn't do it. And

[2:16:12] letters. He sent me the prettiest
[2:16:14] pictures I've ever seen in my life.

[2:16:26] pretty little pictures about this
[2:16:29] be. The man says, "May I see one?" And
[2:16:33] they ask her, "Where do you go there,
[2:16:36] man? Stay with me. This is where my
[2:16:38] message is. Where do you keep this
[2:16:40] message? This pictures, are we
[2:16:43] together?" She
[2:16:45] [Music]
[2:16:46] said, "Keep them in the Bible. Are we
[2:16:49] still together?"
[2:16:54] She had a
[2:16:55] suitcase. She had a
[2:16:59] purse. Why keeping the letters in the
[2:17:02] Bible?
[2:17:04] In the
[2:17:05] Bible.
[2:17:07] Then the old mother crossed the floor
[2:17:10] went.
[2:17:12] Now
[2:17:13] listen. She picked up her Bible,
[2:17:17] her own Bible.

[2:18:27] is in this place, and
[2:18:30] I do not know it. And this woman was
[2:18:34] rich,
[2:18:36] but she did not know
[2:18:38] it. But where did she find her riches?"
[2:18:42] Whatever say in
[2:18:45] revival, whatever is telling you
[2:18:49] now, you don't have to act like the
[2:18:52] world. Are we
[2:18:54] together? You don't have to act like the

[2:20:01] Bible. Where do you find it?
[2:20:04] Amen. But say in the
[2:20:07] Bible. When I was in the office, I said
[2:20:10] this is
[2:20:12] God. They were they were singing every
[2:20:15] chapter, every verse, every promise in
[2:20:17] the Bible is mine.
[2:20:22] Says, you just looked
[2:20:27] over and you thought it was just a
[2:20:31] picture, a picture book.
[2:20:35] Do we have pictures here?
[2:20:39] Do we have pictures here?
[2:20:43] The best pictures that you have never
[2:20:45] seen in your life.
[2:20:48] Somebody stay with me here.
[2:20:52] The best
[2:20:53] pictures that you have ever
[2:20:56] seen. She said he sent me the prettiest
[2:20:59] pictures I've never seen in my
[2:21:02] life. Say this
[2:21:04] pictures. It's not a book story.
[2:21:09] These are riches.
[2:21:11] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:14] It's not a picture book
[2:21:17] or some other true story.
[2:21:20] But there it is.
[2:21:22] It's God's
[2:21:24] word because the word you are rich.
[2:21:30] Now
[2:21:32] listen in the spiritual things. I'm rich
[2:21:35] spiritually speaking
[2:21:37] in health. I'm
[2:21:39] rich in the material things. I'm rich
[2:21:44] in the riches of God is in all
[2:21:45] dimensions.
[2:21:47] When God delivers perfect in delivering
[2:21:50] per perfectly, his deliverance is
[2:21:55] total. Are we together? Are we still
[2:21:58] together? Are we here?
[2:22:02] I want to tell somebody before I start
[2:22:06] preaching. The message that we
[2:22:10] received are riches and treasures of
[2:22:15] God that have been sent to
[2:22:20] us in the very kind and sweetest
[2:22:25] letters and the prettiest
[2:22:29] pictures that we have never seen. You
[2:22:32] won't see this manington,
[2:22:36] but you will see it in a museum in
[2:22:38] Washington
[2:22:40] DC. The prettiest
[2:22:43] pictures, the cloud of glories back
[2:22:46] there. I want to tell
[2:22:50] somebody these pictures are not just
[2:22:54] pictures. It's not psychology.
[2:23:01] This picture is the evidence that the
[2:23:03] pill of fire is
[2:23:08] real. A woman saw that picture. The pill
[2:23:12] of fire leaving the picture healing
[2:23:14] her. And if he did it, he can do it
[2:23:17] again.
[2:23:19] Oh my beloved
[2:23:22] brothers, it's not a picture book.
[2:23:28] I don't put a picture book in my
[2:23:32] church. This picture is to tell you
[2:23:36] that the pill of fire is real.
[2:23:41] And what was it? What was the use of it
[2:23:43] in the time of
[2:23:44] Israel? When it was
[2:23:46] dark, he was lighting the way. Are we
[2:23:51] together? When there was the Red Sea
[2:23:53] before them, he was parting the Red Sea.
[2:23:56] Where there was no way, he was making a
[2:23:59] way. Where there's no opportunities, he
[2:24:02] gives
[2:24:03] opportunities. That's the
[2:24:06] purifier. It's not a picture book, it's
[2:24:10] riches, a great
[2:24:12] treasure. Understand it that
[2:24:15] way. And the cloud of glory when it was
[2:24:19] sunny.
[2:24:21] The cloud of glory covers
[2:24:23] them. When people were crying left and
[2:24:26] right, they were under the shade of the
[2:24:28] cloud. The cloud of glory were covering
[2:24:30] them were protecting them. Amen. Amen.
[2:24:34] and my
[2:24:35] prophet in the birth
[2:24:38] pain and of the ministry of his life. He
[2:24:41] said this prayer,
[2:24:43] let the cloud and the pill of fire
[2:24:47] leaves the picture and gets in the
[2:24:53] people. Oh my beloved brothers and
[2:24:55] sisters,

[2:25:32] this, don't just believe it's a letter.
[2:25:36] Go wake Jesus. It's not a
[2:25:39] letter. When you have a problem, wake
[2:25:42] him
[2:25:44] up. But you keep it as just a letter.

[2:25:51] letter.

[2:26:19] find yourself in that same I have a
[2:26:20] lovely sonsper? He's very prosperous
[2:26:23] business. He sends me letters.
[2:26:26] Those are just not letters. These are
[2:26:29] riches.
[2:26:32] These are not letters.
[2:26:34] I'm saying these are
[2:26:36] [Applause]
[2:26:37] riches. When you read go wake
[2:26:41] Jesus, it's not just
[2:26:44] letters. It means wake Jesus up.

[2:27:42] see in the midst of all this. The Lord

[2:29:49] There were not just paragraphs.

[2:32:24] poverty that's your problem.
[2:32:26] Let me tell

[2:32:50] healing. He's not coming to change your
[2:32:52] situation.
[2:32:54] The role of the
[2:32:56] investigator is to wake you up,
[2:33:00] the role of the investigator
[2:33:03] is to awaken you

[3:03:28] Most gracious heavenly father,
[3:03:33] we thank you for your grace
[3:03:37] because this message is a message of
[3:03:41] grace and we are not worthy of
[3:03:46] anything. What we
[3:03:49] are, what we have, it's just your grace.
[3:03:54] And we want to be thankful and
[3:03:58] grateful. And this morning, Father, we
[3:04:01] want to say thank
[3:04:03] you for reaching out to every
[3:04:08] need. Oh God, it was not a man
[3:04:13] speaking. It was you, the living
[3:04:16] God, the creator of heaven and
[3:04:20] earth. The one who knows the need.
[3:04:25] Father, you have
[3:04:27] spoken. It's not in vain. You have an
[3:04:30] objective and we pray that that
[3:04:36] objective come to
[3:04:39] pass maybe
[3:04:41] Lord or
[3:04:43] certainly we needed a wakeup
[3:04:47] call. the things that we
[3:04:50] have, the thing that are in
[3:04:54] us. He took
[3:04:58] your wake up
[3:04:59] call the same
[3:05:02] way you did with Jacob.
[3:05:07] Wake up our
[3:05:09] conscience that we are not sick,
[3:05:13] we are not
[3:05:14] poor, we are not
[3:05:17] needy, but we have everything at our
[3:05:21] reach and we come with the power that is
[3:05:26] already in the message. The power that
[3:05:30] is within
[3:05:31] ourselves. The power that is in the
[3:05:35] church to claim
[3:05:38] every situation situation, every person
[3:05:42] to take
[3:05:44] conscience and to go to the angel
