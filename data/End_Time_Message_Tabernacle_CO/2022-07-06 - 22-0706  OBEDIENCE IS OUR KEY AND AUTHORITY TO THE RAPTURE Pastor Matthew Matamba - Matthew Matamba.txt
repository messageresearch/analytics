and a warm welcome [Music] and i know you some of you have made a lot of sacrifices coming from a different state spend your money for traveling hotel food etc and but i i'm expecting what you are going to receive will be more than what you have spent because even in the bible they are talking about the queen of sheba members when he heard about a special meeting somewhere don't you parliament special gift then don't special she did not stay quiet and nepal stayed from killer she took a lot of risks going through the desert the travis desire where the children of ishmael were there laurie javilison found ismael but let me tell you when god is calling for you for something faith we don't see any obstacles and if it's a real faith it constitutes even foreign that's why the queen of sheba was under such a great expectation grand expectative she went a little party regardless of the risk very importantly she was there elitilla and the brother banham said she did not sleep during the meeting the first night a bastard solomon did not address her needs but she was not discouraged [Music] he [Music] but i guarantee you before the meeting finish god will address your condition condition and that expectation he said that we'll put you under preparation vavvu susan preparation did you come that will bring the manifestation give up manifestation so we thank god for all your sacrifices and this is special services special there should be a special guard a dwarf ngo special to address every special need for a ponder special because he's always a special man amen so during the meetings we will uh have two boxes back there new zealand [Music] so if you came with any question on your heart occur write it down if you want to sign your name that's fine if you don't that's fine also so the way we will do today tomorrow today there will be a pastor matamba from north [Music] ben shamil uh they got a little delay on their way but i think they should be here tomorrow morning god willing with uh pastor david silo pastor david sagar so each one of the speakers checking this writer certainly will say something you may question or you may want a little bit more of light certainly certain choices during the banquet speakers will be addressing the questions because if we will let everybody speak during the banquet with a lot of questions maybe we will not be able to address all the needs but still during the banquet we will be open for some questions but if you can address your question up front i see who will you see uh this way those repetitive questions we will uh eliminate them and address one so the boxes are not here tonight but i'm expecting them to arrive tomorrow god willing so without any further delay today we are going to stand and welcome pastor matthias matamba from north carolina north carolina do you appreciate brahma tamba yeah he came with uh his entire family you live nearby for me uh his wife i didn't see her visa farm oh she's there in the back sister esther elena and uh six children yeah rebecca one is not yet here in nepal is here she will come with the husband it'll be so mari so let us sing as uh we welcome pastor mature [Music] [Music] the word of god [Music] [Music] we [Music] [Applause] life [Music] [Music] in [Music] [Music] great of god [Music] changing me and changing your [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is my second trip to colorado colorado god bless brother [Music] i want to give thanks to the lord jesus for this opportunity is opportunity and i want to give thanks to our local pastor pastor foster and his family such a welcome bienvenue i feel like uh i'm treated way like in a overrated way but i just say thank you lord merci senor and we have traveled uh almost uh a whole day a little over 24 hours to be here with you in the house of the lord and i told i told somebody my wife or somebody i was talking to je parlect camp did my fam i said uh we're just gonna go there to receive something something that will draw us closer to the rapture because surely i'm tired of this world and i want to get out of here how many can say that's my desire said on wednesday i'm just going to be there to welcome the folks to the house of the lord and we thank him for his love and he is a concern for each and every one of us and so uh my family has already been introduced here hey my family i did this yeah uh you may be seated for a minute i'm so sorry to keep you standing the lord has given me a wonderful family listen for me and i say uh many many years ago and now some 30 years later the lord has given me a family and so i thank god i do not deserve it he's given me a wonderful wife and wonderful children and wonderful friends all around me and so we want to go straight to the world and i know this is uh uh the theme is family as the holy spirit leads me to speak asian i'm a very disorganized preacher i see modern preachers they come with a little uh device and everything and may the lord bless us amen amen well let's give him a hand [Applause] so we are going to stand and read the word if you have first samuel v and samuel chapter 15. kenza and we can begin at verse 13. but before we read the bible let's just pray a little eternal god we come before you humbly this afternoon lord in this lovely place where your children have left their homes and many have left their states to come and fellowship around the things of christ and lord it's following my lord to be here this evening and may you prepare the hearts to receive the word [Applause] all the sacrifices that have been put forth to the sacrifice may you reward every child of god a hundred percent conform some people that maybe when we look back to this these services later on we can say it has been good to have been at denver for the services and so lord we commit the reading of the word into your hands may you help us lord adeno we depend on you one hundred percent and we ask this blessing benediction in that great magnificent name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen so we read from first uh samuel chapter 15. beginning at verse 13 and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord and samuel said what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear is and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed this sacrifice then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord have said to me this night and he said unto him say on islam and samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed the king over israel israel and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed where for then did thou not obey the voice of the lord but did fly upon the spoil and its evil in the sight of the lord and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agg the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed their malachites but the people took of the spoiled sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams summer d letter may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated our key to adoption and authority notre claire paula dobson and the rapture so that's a little long text uh but i'll repeat it again obedience our key to adoption and authority and the rapture amen amen how many are interested in making the rapture praise the name of the lord see when this thought came to me i was going to title it obedience your key to adoption authority and the rapture voter but then the holy spirit said you have to change that don't say your key need pervertedly say our ki amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so obedience we're talking about family for me now family and family was instituted by god institute about you and family is really the nucleus that's where everything is learned that's where children are conceived that's where children are born that's where children are raised that's where children learn are you with me and so in order to have a strong church in bonnie gleason we need to have strong families [Applause] and in order to have a strong family people avoid the family up we need strong churches see they are interdependent are you with me the prophet says when you see the confusion amongst the people it's weak pulpits is that right and when you see the the people the prophet says a man of god comes there and has the word of the lord and the people neglect to pay attention it's not juvenile delinquency you have an absolute is that right he said the absolute of the nation is the supreme court we may not like their decision but we have to abide by it because that's the nation's absolute best question are you with me and the prophet says because when a nation coincides losers faith and respect in their constitution constitution that nation is gone he says if a church did he see negligence loses respect for its pastor that church is gone if a family sin for me loses respect for the parent spell respect these are key elements in a family so it's only associated with the name of the lawyer [Music] in first corinthians chapter 11. the bible says that the hair is a covering to a woman is that right now listen to the prophet he says be your followers of me so i am as imitator even as i am of christ come jesus amen amen now there had to be obedience to the apostles some people in the days of paul certain person did not recognize the authority the apostolic authority of powell who is the guy he's in jail see the word of god not as the word of a man comely hallelujah hallelujah god is a mystery and god is so great but he can humble himself maybe then he can't make him small anymore he can make himself small anymore he stays big he'll let the god he want to sit like this he wants when he walks in for everybody speak to the name of the lord he says the man that was just converted last night a drunkard that was just converted in the sight of god he is just the same as the greatest minister [Applause] are you with me so man gets big and can't get back but god can get himself so small oh hallelujah hallelujah he says be followers of me as i am of christ so you see paul was under the authority of christ then he was requiring for the church to obey the word because he himself must remember was obedient to the to the word of christ and so now the prophet says this prophet this is he says no i praise you brethren i praise you because you remember me in all things is christ the head of every man is christ a christian and the head of the woman is the man he'll accept the affair the head of christ is god hey this is a jew amen amen the head of every man is christ the head of every woman is the man he says see how it is god dear christ [Music] amen amen god you christ easter men lumber woman elopham amen amen oh we want these things to sink deep i've talked to people they live in africa in viva africa and they want to send their daughter to america on america and they want to send her to france but they want to send this young lady villa voices and she has no authority says i got enough money you go and find an apartment and you live in that apartment that is lack of wisdom now these things that i say and they show brother neville i just speak as they come to me and uh i know maybe somebody following the tape might say who is the guy let me say that because they might help someone who is humble enough to pick it up it's not right to send a daughter alone away no may god help us get you said because no woman basket or kunufam can live without a head bow vivre so's in detail she has to have a head el dora avoir dead her head is her father ceson pere is that right correct when she leaves that house kyle kitty said and is married elle maria her head is her husband says so marie we just had a wedding in charlotte and after the ceremony was said the veil was taken off and the lady put the veil over the man is that right it's correct but if a child has to go to america then you know there is a man in denver but could you advise me what to do where she could live and and papa foster will say hey papa foster all right you can send her over to my house are you with me decisions whether you go here or not he will be the one to decide get your vote obey him the way you would operate hallelujah the church of the living god hallelujah needs to know these things legally there is something connected if there is a responsible man in town see i ain't not responsible for fostering will say brother is going to have that temporary authority or headship over here hallelujah hallelujah what are we looking for we send kids anywhere and we don't even monitor what happens there are they even attending church we don't know oh god help us there's got to be authority you've got to be hatred does that mean that the woman is inferior to a man [Music] my because the prophet said that if you say that means the woman is inferior to man then you would have to say that christ is inferior to god are you with me it has nothing to do with inferiorities it has to do with the great eternal wisdom of god and we will see god and christ are one jail a man and his wife are one the lord may suffer now in two different bodies don't do it god defeat christ and god are one christian in one body a man and his wife are one lord made a firm son uh in two different bodies hallelujah hallelujah no no he said the glory that i had with you before he prayed that that glory would be with us the oneness that he had with the father that's the same oneness he wants to have with us and in saint john 14 20 he said at that day you'll know i am in the father father it means hallelujah my god separated the the the he he took a rib off of the man made another body here and he took the feminist part of the spirit of the man in the woman and all that was portraying christ and the church the majestic paul says it's a mystery amen amen so now obedience may not low bases see it can only result why is your day from love amen true obedience amen amen let's read the prophet here a little bit he's on the prophet now he's speaking to he's speaking here in palisi oh my he says my son monfisa joseph joseph if you love me si tium and then you'll mind me i pray to sushi i have that here praise the lord now watch this observation see he is first let's comment here on this roman centurion his servant was sick this is from the message jairus of los angeles august 3rd los angeles august 3rd 54. the he says i'm not even worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word giza my mo now consider this man men considered he's a great centurion and a centurion is a gonzaga is a soldier that has a hundred soldiers or so under and we realized that now jesus i'll go and heal that he should come under my roof hallelujah hallelujah oh brother sister humility humility it is a revelation something that god has to reveal jesus did not even have a home jesus jesus didn't have a place to like his jesus many nights he spent in the world with wild beasts i'm not worthy for you to step under my roof that was needed for the healing of that person now how did he learn this what gospel did he read he knew his survey that in him and we in jesus name was invested the power of jehovah and he knew he would survey oh [Applause] [Applause] oh what [Applause] and they executed have power to speak over every spirit you took a spleen every demon to let them on every cancer shotgun only [Music] [Applause] [Applause] authority [Applause] [Music] why am i like this why should she come to see can anybody help me get camping and the devil would come here take that away and make him go wild again oh brother sister but there was a great king hallelujah hallelujah who left his kingdom in glory the bible says [Applause] insert one word and those evil spirits left man and they could not even get in those pigs [Music] that [Applause] you see they obey god's voice all the stars of the galaxy they obey his voice he says but god only has trouble with human beings that's truth my brother and why is that because he did not give the moon a free moral agency [Music] is an act of free moral agency gentlemen he doesn't force doors in a force of punishment he doesn't break doors in a breeze when he comes to a door can't even apologize as a gentleman come in he stands and knocks he says you know the story of this great artist how that is our portrait was so beautiful jesus knocking on the door and uh before it went to the hall of fame it had to go to the hall of critics [Music] he is in the middle of the darkness jesus comes to your life to bring light jesus amen he said we can see all that and it's beautiful that was by [Applause] with all the blessings he said you see here ac the man says the king says oh great prophet of the lord oh god prophet good morning good to see you already displeased [Applause] god help us and then they find some wonderful sheep they say oh this ship here could be a wonderful offering unto the lord he even spoke to samuel said look we saved them to bring a sacrifice unto the lord your god and samuel said it's a melody you have disobeyed you are this will be so partial obedience is disobedience and if we read the verse there 23 we didn't read it but let's just look at verses for rebellion is as the scene of witchcraft don't even greet them [Music] pasque [Music] l-d-e-d she wants to send you a come on from the new yeah uh a woman some kind of woman they have an affair in the night with everything for you infamy i said but i've never had anything like that to happen to me in the night revelation and i said now i said now when you when you gave that message were there any judges to judge it oh no we're just a little group here the lord spoke to us that way i said now now if my mother is my enemy and my bible tells me if your enemy is thirsty give them to drink [Applause] [Applause] the prophet says this the prophet dc he says now i'm happy i get tired you can imagine how satan fights with me day and night i have a battle that no one knows about it he says but i love people i love them with all my girls hallelujah hallelujah and therefore esc people know that legend he says i love the people and the people know it i have never let my ministry get to be a place to where it would look like a it would be big grandiose it might go to my head amen amen my ministry has been kept little more minister and i deal with a few people and [Applause] amen it's this we see to please my heavenly father [Applause] [Music] amen he says my whole mother motif is to please my heavenly father that's only thing i have to do is to please him say to me replay when a man lives

within my spirit my own spirit i think it's shocked foreign sight i'm a purpose you lord senior keep me little got the my pt amen amen when i can be to where he can use me i want to a place to where he when the angelic beings come out together [Applause] do you know that god once in a while holds a council up there angels come he he'll pay attention to my words brother fred that's what we're looking for because he had a special task basket special do you know that god has a special task with you oh blessed be the name of the lord patriarch abraham let's speak of him a little abraham was just an ordinary man wasn't something special is that right god never called him as far as we have any record until he was 75 years old so some kenzan now think of this man he got married he said marie he was probably 26 27. that was probably 16-17 yeah no promise and when he was 75 he received the promise promise and the bible says abraham believed god abram and that was imputed unto him for righteousness and that faith in god he said to want you he had faith in god you he received the word brother branham says what more does any people need than to receive a promise of god amen people want to doubt the prophets doubt the promises why do you go to church what is the message god you sent this message to special hearts yo people who will believe that without reasoning serve the fleshy [Applause] because there's a master is i said brother you could find sons here they both [Music] they say give i said what a generation a is it is a fashion of the world and you are longing for the world and when you can find the crack somewhere out you go there give me a quote such people it's a journey even when you find the code how can you love the god that you don't see if you can't love the people that you see how can you obey your heavenly father and your paul writes in the bible i can read it to you right here foreign the holy spirit the sanctity moves that's who does those things he faces and you see young people in the message everywhere there's john john on him around marsha and you look if we got there oh god would you this is the church of tomorrow silly gliese brother yeah the bible says you have an action in you the trouble we have today is with people who read the bible they only read what's written but the revelation is hidden between the lines hermit huh let his hair grow his whisker says live in the wilderness as the prophets of the old commonly prophet sierra said if the lord would speak to me i just come out of the lord in the world how many know that was his desire come here so much higher than moses he was smooth-shaved he didn't go in the pool with a bunch of jeans that's what he put on when he was hunting that belongs to the wilderness but i have brought you up to a much higher office was even more important to god than the messenger duty you've got to come to full obedience with evaluations complete to obey what he says god demands that geology you can't do it no other this he says when a ministry he says my crowning [Applause] are you with me hallelujah he says i would like for him to crown my ministry this way [Applause] and that's the character of jesus christ the greatest victory of abraham victor oh hallelujah [Applause] when he got up there oh think of it abraham obama see he proved it to me see this is speaking himself god proved it to me i was childless this sounds like i was an old man i was terrible my wife's room was dead she was 65. l.a.t 25 years of trial he didn't mean anything to abraham he come out stronger than he was in the first place still giving praise to god [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you act like the [Applause] [Applause] said doctor all right all right fine sir we all will fix those things did you notice that guys to be harmless hey so we won't have him locked up no he's harmless he's harmless he's off his mind but abraham when he gets out of praise 25 years old [Applause] god is going to prove to the devil diablo the bride loves him take him up there destroy the very evidence we remember and when he started to take his child's life you're [Applause] this was the man that waited 25 years on juventus finally he was there and the prophet says isaac was about 16. and then god speaks to him kill him oh brother sister sir he lives by his eternal life we ought to stop and think abraham loved god abraham i met you he was going to sacrifice his begotten son because he loved god he limits you above all things produces obedience amen amen if a woman really loves her husband i wouldn't want my wife to obey me on that kind of ground pakistan no no no no no no no i'd rather live alone in some places i have to beg for something to do i'm going to tell you the pastor is your daughter my wife she has to say but i still dear my family follow her example swiss an example she loved her husband ella miso marie she called him milo who told sarah to do that hey man amen who told her where did she read that question but you have read it metwatchulalu you have been told that on that diesel you have been preached that on that priscilla but you don't want to do it remember obedience god never puts a word in his bible in his message that's idle and every word is important brother told me oh brother matamba you know this particular sister came to see me said uh and she was speaking in lingala you can interpret my lord lies a lot now you see me the prophet says if a man lives the life that man because god asked you the reason he requires obedience god is a god of order a friend told me and at one time the dictator mubutu he had all the university students to go to the army amen and he said to them said you become soldiers who defended the soldier and uh my friend was telling me he must have me then the commandment would come down move this way in the army orders are not argued about on a discrete passion orders are executed but we want to understand why all the thinking has already been done for you all you have to do is execute this question and all the thinking about the word has already been done [Applause] and when god speaks it's to execute [Applause] and so in that symphony in that harmony and she doesn't sit simply don't say termini god has a man to give instruction to his family god gave a little discernment a little extra discernment to men than to the wife and so when he says let's go let's go [Music] we're just trying to do the best we can with our african languages how many know the church has to come to adoption jesus had proven to god that he had been the right kind of a son and god took him up on the top of the mountain shine like the sun is supernatural something taking place his garments glistened like the sun in its middle of the day amen amen we're speaking of mountain transfigurations is that right yes god and how many know that the prophet of the lord was adopted god adopted his prophets on prophet because he was obedient to obey his son and the prophet says that's the thing that god will do to his son here on earth he sees you later amen you believe that he will call you aside if you only obey him and stay on the and he will place into the church even before the coming of jesus christ he will place into the church he has blessed us all the powers that christ christ in him and we will be in the church say that donald glieser believers though this before the rapture have fun one holy spirit and self-centered speech revelation 22 17 apocalypse and the spirit taylor sweeney and the brother shake up these vienna the spirit and you become amen listen to the prophets he says this dccc see the day because the same power of god basketball that was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ jesus the same power that rested in jesus christ rests in the placed sons [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is he says the holy spirit he didn't send his plea always gives a report to the father of how the son is progressing hallelujah the holy spirit comes with oh your son he loves your affair he does not want to miss services or he's he's willing to even let go of a big opportunity at work oh he doesn't even care about the things of the world every day he's thinking about the rapture nepal's gonna live more he loves you and the father says is that right yes sir we miss you do you believe it's time
