[1:28:04] it's one of the law by which God is
[1:28:07] ruling over the universe
[1:28:12] it's God who created this universe
[1:28:16] hey it is
[1:28:22] raining over this you all Universe by

[1:28:46] is the law of continuity
[1:28:49] uh
[1:28:56] of it I read it
[1:29:02] is
[1:29:05] I said job had the same perspective of
[1:29:08] that law of the nature
[1:29:10] we will see the prophet him also the
[1:29:13] prophet
[1:29:15] IC yeah
[1:29:17] now continue with the
[1:29:20] the Lord he said there was there is a
[1:29:23] continuity of the law of the nature
[1:29:27] like continuity the last few
[1:29:31] the continuity of the action of the
[1:29:34] spirit of God will continue with the LA
[1:29:38] parole the continuity of the word of God
[1:29:43] see
[1:29:50] continuity
[1:29:53] if I can recap the law of the continuity
[1:29:56] of the nature
[1:29:58] shows
[1:30:00] those are things that are leading us
[1:30:05] what's up
[1:30:14] you can see it if you throw a rock in a
[1:30:18] lake of water
[1:30:29] you can see the waves spreading from
[1:30:32] where you drop the rock uh
[1:30:36] it will go uh indefinitely
[1:30:41] Mala
[1:30:57] temperatures
[1:30:59] there is a spreading of that movement
[1:31:02] all the way to far away from you
[1:31:10] all that I'm saying is a prophet who's
[1:31:12] speaking about it
[1:31:14] and see
[1:31:26] never lost
[1:31:34] it's the same thing about every motion
[1:31:37] that we are doing

[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:14] but the devil he doesn't think he can
[1:33:17] watch over somebody
[1:33:20] his work is to destroy the other person
[1:33:27] he cannot have somebody to walk come on
[1:33:30] come on
[1:33:36] somebody's house experience a country
[1:33:38] like this

[1:36:04] of Jesus Christ
[1:36:22] it's only the blood of Jesus that can
[1:36:25] take a evil action and take it away
[1:36:34] if it's not through them
[1:36:38] everything that we have already done
[1:36:41] things that we already said
