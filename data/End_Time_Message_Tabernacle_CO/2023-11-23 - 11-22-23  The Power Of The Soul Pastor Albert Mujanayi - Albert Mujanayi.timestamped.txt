[25:20] upon the
[25:26] trees
[25:29] you know Sunday I thought about speaking
[25:31] about something
[25:40] else and uh my spirit was coming to what
[25:43] I was talking about on last
[25:49] Sunday and we just uh waiting upon the
[25:56] Lord
[26:07] I was reading the prophet and the
[26:08] prophet said one of the fundamental
[26:10] reason that we see no more going on in
[26:13] the
[26:20] church because there's not enough
[26:23] traveling of the
[26:26] Soul
[26:31] to bring the person in contact with his
[26:41] [Music]
[26:42] maker the progress of the church is uh
[26:46] linked to the traveling of the
[26:56] souls
[27:02] I know you know the scripture that say
[27:04] you have to prosper in any ways as the
[27:07] state of your souls
[27:15] [Music]
[27:19] Prosper the progress that we can have in
[27:21] our life is linked to the progress of
[27:24] our
[27:26] souls
[27:33] the one that wrote the Book of
[27:42] Revelation prison he was physically as a
[27:46] prisoner in the uh island of Patmos
[27:54] [Music]
[27:56] well
[27:59] he said I was caught up in
[28:04] [Music]
[28:09] spirit and said that he was caught up
[28:11] into that vision for almost two
[28:14] [Music]
[28:20] [Music]
[28:26] years physically was in the island of
[28:29] Patmos but he went to the days of the
[28:37] Lord it
[28:42] wasn't he was still there physically in
[28:45] the island of
[28:47] [Music]
[28:49] Patmos surrounded by all the snakes and
[28:56] scorpions
[29:01] but Esau was caught up very far that he
[29:03] could see the thing that we seeing
[29:06] [Music]
[29:07] today when he was caught up in
[29:13] spirit when his soul was caught up in
[29:16] higher
[29:18] spheres he saw the
[29:22] throne he saw what was happening in
[29:26] heaven
[29:28] he saw that great
[29:36] prostitute amen he even saw the United
[29:39] States before United States could come
[29:41] into reality do you
[29:44] [Music]
[29:51] know he saw that lamb was talking like a
[29:56] dragon
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] he started slowly talking Slowly by
[30:06] starting to Marvel the
[30:10] world and brother says that that was
[30:13] United
[30:17] States they're able to bring down fire
[30:20] from heaven those
[30:24] [Music]
[30:26] are
[30:27] [Music]
[30:30] yes John saw all these things before
[30:32] United States was
[30:35] created he saw the
[30:39] bride he see the opening of the
[30:44] seals while the opening of the SE was
[30:46] supposed to happen in the last days what
[30:51] happened that was the soul that was
[30:53] caught up
[30:55] physic physically was blocked
[30:58] [Music]
[31:00] but spiritually was in great
[31:03] spheres I want to tell
[31:07] you you can be
[31:10] here but you can concentrate
[31:13] yourself you can lift up your
[31:16] soul and you can go to Great
[31:20] spheres and see great
[31:26] things
[31:27] it's just up to you to think about
[31:36] those I want to talk about something
[31:39] that we reserve ourselves to talk
[31:48] [Music]
[31:51] about let me tell you that before God
[31:54] created the world he has to think about
[31:56] it
[31:59] that's what the prophet
[32:05] says amen the prophet say he started to
[32:08] think about how things were supposed to
[32:13] happen he he didn't have another word
[32:15] that he wanted to copy that word
[32:16] [Music]
[32:18] from but it was his own
[32:22] thoughts when he T when he thought about
[32:26] it he spoke the
[32:30] word and what he had in his thoughts
[32:33] became a
[32:37] reality amen God has to call it soul up
[32:43] amen and you can call your own soul
[32:47] up and you can bring things into
[32:51] existence because for our
[32:55] Prophet what we think thinking
[32:58] about that's what's happening to us amen
[33:03] I don't know if you believe it
[33:07] amen even the
[33:12] angels why the church doesn't see many
[33:16] angels because the church doesn't think
[33:18] about
[33:20] them but if you're thinking about those
[33:24] angels the angel will appear to you
[33:29] the two disciple on the road
[33:32] of they were talking about
[33:35] Jesus and Jesus came to towards
[33:38] them let me tell
[33:43] you and bring him out of the seven
[33:48] Dimension and come near
[33:52] you it's a power that we
[33:55] incarnate amen yes sir
[34:00] Hallelujah but that
[34:14] exercise that exercise to think about
[34:17] those things to cut up your souls those
[34:19] things that's what the church is not
[34:22] really where it's supposed to
[34:25] be
[34:27] may God help
[34:39] us I I feel like I want to say
[34:42] something I didn't want to say
[34:44] it you
[34:47] [Music]
[34:54] know a man can recreate his
[35:02] wife just with it with her
[35:12] soul mayor with his soul he can think
[35:15] about a wonderful woman or better
[35:23] woman and every single time is actually
[35:26] directing his touch towards
[35:35] it the same way that our thoughts can
[35:38] bring God out of his Dimension and bring
[35:40] him near
[35:44] us the same way that God's thought
[35:47] that's what brought the world into
[35:52] [Music]
[35:53] existence and you can bring a wife
[35:56] according to your own
[35:58] thought even your
[36:07] children that's why we are not allowed
[36:09] to talk with our children or treat them
[36:12] as a
[36:15] ambel because they're going to become
[36:18] what we thinking about
[36:20] them amen yes
[36:25] sir
[36:32] even the church
[36:36] here you becoming what the pastor think
[36:39] of you
[36:43] amen every time when he
[36:46] prays he has an
[36:48] image of what the church
[36:51] [Music]
[36:54] is that's the anting that
[36:57] transmits it can take
[37:02] time I'm just taking talking
[37:08] ordinary if you go to a church where the
[37:10] pastor always does
[37:12] this you say all the church will do this
[37:15] as well yes
[37:19] sir I believe that
[37:24] it if you come to
[37:27] B you're going to see
[37:36] me you're going to see towards the
[37:38] behavior of believer you see oh this is
[37:40] Pastor
[37:44] Albert you see like me I don't know how
[37:46] to speak like a
[37:52] priest if I want to talk like a priest I
[37:55] want to respect the
[37:57] [Music]
[37:59] I want to control all the
[38:01] words I'm a a little bit like a Savage
[38:06] white uh even my
[38:10] church every time they
[38:13] shout that's how they
[38:23] are there's a power that transmits
[38:28] there's a power to transmit from our
[38:30] souls and we can bring into existence
[38:33] numbers of
[38:38] [Music]
[38:45] things Jacob was thinking about
[38:49] his and he was thinking about he was
[38:53] reing and a certain time he had the
[38:56] better
[38:59] spiration because he was aspiring to
[39:01] become a
[39:03] boss and he became a
[39:06] boss
[39:10] amen I'm talking to you as adults right
[39:19] now fish instead of go and fish uh get
[39:23] some fish for you they can help you to
[39:25] become a fisherman
[39:29] that's my true thought
[39:33] amen
[39:41] our existence also has the power to go
[39:44] out and think about something and bring
[39:46] into
[39:48] existence
[39:55] uh
[39:59] that's why we established I think you
[40:00] didn't
[40:02] forget it's with the
[40:16] prophet that our souls were created the
[40:19] day that God created a man to his own
[40:25] image
[40:29] you have to exclude your
[40:35] thoughts you have to exclude in your
[40:37] thoughts that that day it was only Adam
[40:39] that was
[40:41] created but say it's between the
[40:46] lines he didn't say let's create a
[40:50] man he said create man to our own image
[40:58] it's the day that our souls were
[41:09] created you believe that our souls were
[41:11] existing before we exist into this uh
[41:21] body we even assist God or help God
[41:25] while he was creating the
[41:28] Earth God was not
[41:31] alone we were around God as the
[41:38] Gathering and we saw our
[41:41] father create the
[41:44] [Music]
[41:46] Earth and we even clap our hands
[41:50] amen God never forgot
[41:54] that but in this body sometime we forget
[41:58] it then based on
[42:01] that we are
[42:05] able to speak like
[42:08] Jesus and to tell the
[42:10] father
[42:12] father glorify
[42:19] me of the glory ahead near you before
[42:23] the foundation of the
[42:25] world
[42:27] we are able to say the same
[42:30] thing because when God created your
[42:34] soul he gave him
[42:37] glory he gave it a
[42:41] commission and the commission was to
[42:43] rule over to
[42:48] dominate and when I see things going
[42:52] wrong I can concentrate myself in my
[42:55] soul tell
[42:57] God oh
[43:00] Father glorify
[43:05] me of the glory I had near you when
[43:08] before the foundation of the
[43:10] world and things can changed amen praise
[43:16] God it's a
[43:18] revelation
[43:19] amen it's a
[43:23] revelation and for tonight
[43:31] I want to keep that
[43:40] same to show you
[43:43] something or uh what make the SWS to be
[43:46] caught
[43:54] up I want to ask you something but you
[43:56] don't have to
[43:58] [Music]
[44:00] answer I think that with everything that
[44:02] I talked about
[44:05] here you agree with
[44:14] [Music]
[44:17] me that before the existence of my body
[44:20] my flesh my soul was existed
[44:23] already not just that
[44:28] my soul is in
[44:30] [Music]
[44:33] activity before I even came to this
[44:35] world as a baby in Christ
[44:39] amen even when I am in this
[44:43] flesh my soul is still
[44:50] working even when I will be out of this
[44:54] flesh even when this flesh will
[44:59] end my soul will continue working
[45:03] amen if you agree may you lift up your
[45:06] hands
[45:13] amen this flesh cannot block my
[45:24] soul my flesh can see a certain way but
[45:27] my soul can see in another
[45:29] [Music]
[45:38] way and the soul is working before the
[45:41] existence of the body while the body is
[45:43] existing and after the body will
[45:49] end ET because say our soul that's our
[45:52] Eternal
[45:54] part
[46:00] it was never said to our souls that you
[46:02] are dirt and you go back to
[46:05] dirch that was taken from that that was
[46:08] said to the
[46:10] body
[46:19] am it's to the body that they gave the
[46:21] promise that you start it and you have
[46:23] an
[46:24] end
[46:26] that was never spoken to the
[46:32] soul my soul is working even if this
[46:35] body ends
[46:38] Amen Let me give you a few
[46:41] examples here in the United
[46:47] States say somewhere I don't know there
[46:51] were an
[46:54] accident

[47:16] place many
[47:20] times and many
[47:23] years someone driving his car
[47:30] and he sees a man uh walking or crossing
[47:34] the road with that the
[47:36] [Music]
[47:37] coat and he will run over that
[47:42] man and that person will actually get
[47:45] out the
[47:46] road and you say oh I ran over
[47:49] someone and when that person gets out of
[47:51] this
[47:52] car even when your your police came
[47:56] and they don't see the person that was
[47:58] run over by the

[58:26] when real people amen
[58:31] Souls they were

[58:40] says Theologian called them the
[58:43] bride the Bride of
[58:46] Jesus who was asking for
[58:50] Revenge until when until
[58:53] when said through their
[58:57] language I
[59:01] knew that he wasn't the Bride of
[59:08] Jesus Amen because death doesn't change
[59:11] the nature of a

[59:19] Jew because the Jew they don't know any
[59:22] other thing the Revenge yes sir

[59:51] Moses that's why I'm saying you becoming
[59:53] what you hearing

[1:00:36] people's
[1:00:37] hearts he said it couldn't be the
[1:00:44] [Music]

[1:01:38] the
[1:01:39] groom they're talking about the bride as
[1:01:44] [Music]

[1:01:52] are people still with the teaching of of
[1:01:58] Moses do you understand what I
[1:02:02] mean in people's
[1:02:09] houses they know really well the book of
[1:02:14] Chronicles the teaching of
[1:02:18] Moses I don't know if you really
[1:02:20] understand what I
[1:02:22] mean the book of Chronicles
[1:02:28] it's the book of

[1:03:22] me and a generation like
[1:03:26] that they will lose their
[1:03:32] identity and they will find themselves
[1:03:34] under the book of the New

[1:03:42] place
[1:03:46] there they recognize the Jew through
[1:03:49] their
[1:03:51] teachings they were claiming vengeance

[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:41] sin Jesus came to take
[1:16:47] sins to bring to bring it back to the
[1:16:51] original owner who was the devil

[1:17:00] was lay dead it's through his soul
[1:17:05] Hallelujah says in the Old
[1:17:10] Testament they were using two
[1:17:14] goats for the
[1:17:18] atonement they had the Lord's book
[1:17:22] goat
[1:17:23] they have the they are the goat for

[1:17:40] Lord for the atonment of
[1:17:46] sin and they would take all those burden
[1:17:49] all those
[1:17:51] sin and they would pouring that to the
[1:17:54] the other
[1:17:55] goat and the other goat was going
[1:17:59] away and when he was going far
[1:18:03] away that means the sin was going
[1:18:06] away away from the sights of
[1:18:11] gods
[1:18:15] Jesus was represented to those two
[1:18:18] Gods he played the
[1:18:21] role
[1:18:23] of the book of the Gods of the
[1:18:26] Lord and the gods of
[1:18:29] AEL as the goat of the

[1:18:36] cross and they killed
[1:18:38] him yes

[1:18:54] that we take all the
[1:18:56] sins and we take it away very
[1:19:00] far when Jesus was
[1:19:04] killed it was his soul that continued
[1:19:07] Hallelujah in other words it was his
[1:19:13] soul that played the role of the god of
[1:19:15] AEL
[1:19:17] Amen to take those things away thank you

[1:19:41] repentance it's what coming from the
[1:19:46] soul when a man repent from his
[1:19:50] soulet when the soul regrets

[1:44:11] Amen Let us give the Lord a
[1:44:15] hand amen amen amen they same God who
[1:44:21] delivered them in the
[1:44:24] fullness he is here he's the
[1:44:28] one when you are listening to the word
[1:44:31] of
[1:44:32] God and you receive
[1:44:35] it God is recreating your
[1:44:40] soul and you have to test
[1:44:43] yourself how you receive the word of
[1:44:48] God because the Bible says
[1:44:51] uh uh I think Psalm
[1:44:55] 42 sorry give me Psalm 42 verse one or
[1:45:00] two we are talking about the
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:06] soul go to the next
[1:45:11] verse yeah my soul thirsted for
[1:45:17] God we are talking about the soul
[1:45:22] it's
[1:45:23] true but to know who you
[1:45:27] are what your soul is thirsting
[1:45:34] for that's the
[1:45:37] difference I don't want to make any
[1:45:39] additional
[1:45:43] comments but keep in
[1:45:45] mind what the fire did to the three
[1:45:49] Hebrews
[1:45:52] it was just to cut the
[1:45:57] chains God's fire is
[1:46:01] here to set you
[1:46:03] free to cut all the chains of
[1:46:08] sin but you have to accept
[1:46:10] it and the more you accept
[1:46:13] it God is recreating your
[1:46:17] soul and then you become a mystical
[1:46:20] person
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:22] you can send your soul
[1:46:27] somewhere blessed be the name of the
[1:46:30] Lord let us bow our
[1:46:36] head Let each person now speak a little
[1:46:39] bit to the
