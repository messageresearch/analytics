name is I [Music] wrote um I just wanted to share a quick story of what I met Isabelle um my family M her as ja now just trying to picture where we lived and when we met ja there was two buildings um that faced each other and they were on a short steep slope our building was at the top of the slope and Cha lived Cy corner from the bottom of the SP during the summer we used to love in B in the grass and hold down the hill or use a water and create it and turn it into a was um but in the summer of 1996 I was seven and my little sister had just turned five um she she had been gifted a Little Mermaid tricycle bike with SH it was the first time she had I so really excited um my mother would always tell us not to play the rain um but it was the beginning of Summer and with B Forest play outside um and she said okay she gave okay but only on the porch um but once we were out on the porch and we realized that she was distracted um we slow started to venture off of the porch until eventually I got the brilliant idea and said hey let's roll this bik down the hill I don't know what we were thinking because the moment my little sister went on the hill she hit the curb of the sidewalk that was right in Fr of's house um and she flipped over a tricycle LED on her face first hitting her head on the sidewalk by the time that I ran to see my sister she was unconscious undisposed school I was in shock I remember scaming for help when suddenly I someone had Pi sister up in her arms and sister to her house that someone was I don't remember what happened after I had into the house with my sister in her arms mostly from a sh I thought I might have killed my sister um but I do remember crying outside the house of a porch and out and she come with me and I remember that she asked me if I wanted to pray I didn't know I do know that it not response to my I honestly believe that my sister could have died or after from that day on sh became she was at every birthday party every family event my grandmother became my aunts and uncle Grands and Uncle when my mom started to work full time and my grandma was struggling with my older sister because she had a disability my grandma was CH and you can hear my is from the bottom of the hill and she would be at the house in last than a minute she was [Music] knew she was with us every moment she Babys us Sheed us um she left play with her cats until we moved away from but even though we moved away and on every holiday there wasn't a holiday that she never called she was always calling our family love CH and we are grateful that we had the privilege to have known her and to have her friendship for over 30 years there are no words that I could take to describe this to L or family M like but we Rejoice that she has moved on to a better place and I believe with all my heart that she is in heaven now and with this I want to finish by saying thank you to love we love you and we'll see you again ink [Applause] you thank you for all your testimonies so we are are going to have a song [Music] radi [Music] than [Music] [Applause] sh [Music] all still you are [Music] my [Music] take our love it leaves our whole soul only and you then do we wonder why this living so you [Music] [Music] I [Music] my [Music] [Applause] sh [Music] all faceful till [Music] death our loveing I few more days to laor and to of is RO will and see as as we sweep [Music] through you is [Music] for [Applause] we [Music] [Music] know she my [Applause] Liv the [Applause] [Music] we all thank you for this song this time I want to speak a little bit on the word of God before we go to the ceter in a moment like this the only comfort we have is the word of God I want to take the scripture in the Book of Job the 14th chapter I'm going to read the first two verses and then I'm going to skip to verse 7 to verse 10 job is one of the oldest book of the Bible Job 14 verses 1 and 2 man it is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he FL also as a shadow and contined not skipping to verse 7 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tend the branch thereof will not cease though the root there of Works old in the earth and the star thereof die in the ground yet through the sight of water it will B and bring forth B like a plant but man dieth and wasteth away yeah man give up The Ghost and where is he that's the question friends family brothers and sisters this is one of the crucial moment in life that each one of us got the opportunity to think about tomorrow death is one of the unwelcome friends or enemy that can come to our home regardless how well prepared we might be death always is unwelcome so this will give us the opportunity to examine ourself just in case death can come and knock at our doors when death comes there is no notice death sometimes is not even polite he she is good regardless how many body gods or Army surrounding you when death comes nobody can stop her let her think about that so this morning uh we are gaed here to pay our last respect to our sister Isabella m this is the last thing that we can do for her on this Earth even though what we are doing right now she cannot hear us but we want to use this as an example as a moment to think that one day unless you be taken into the rapt we will be also laying down in a casket and there will be people gathering for us as we are gathered this morning for sister Isabel those who knew her and through the testimony given here her life and her testimony speak speaks louder in my eyes my personal acquaintance with sister Isabella is back from around 2011 when she start attending our church she was coming always in a wheelchair with a bus dropping her at the church door and uh she had really hard time to sit and to stand but R of the pain sister Isabella was always attending service and from the time she stopped coming to church because of her health condition she was always following the service home streaming uh sending me messages even when I write on the board of the church she always was there to say I don't like that color because I cannot read and uh she would go and in her condition buy some markers and sheep to the church you can tell how dedicated and faithful she was you heard the testimonies here that she was never complaining about her condition and I remember few months ago uh I went to visit her and I recorded a video uh where she sent a message to the congregation uh I projected it in the church but she was saying I'm still here whenever you get in time out of your busy schedule please remember come and visit me she was always in such a wonderful good mood but my experience with her as a pastor when I saw her life moving toward the end I had some conversation with her trying to find out where she was standing as believer where she will be going every time I had such such a conversation she was always telling me I want to serve the Lord I want to serve the Lord I am ready I am ready and she could not even accept whatever the doctor said according to science she always said I have faith one of these days I'm going to stand I'm going to walk I'm going to attend the church so until the last minute she always have that kind of Faith so if I can identify her I will say she died as a soldier she never give up one minute to the extent even the doctors they were very very M we want to do this no I don't want pain medicine I want if I have to go I have to go in the natural way my life is in the hand of the Lord what kind of Faith very often people in such condition maybe not a lot of people around to encourage you but the word of God within yourself was the encouragement always ready to sing to praise Etc uh a week before she passed away when I went to visit her she was unable to speak but she could hear she could move her eyes and uh you can tell that she's listening to whatever you ask saying word of encouragement and the prayer you can really see that she was struggling to speak but she could not and you know when you reach that point where you cannot speak I always believe there is something going on because before you pass away you will see where you are going and God always show the people the direction for the remaining portion of your life but what you see very often God will shut your mouth so that we cannot communicate we don't want to wait until we get to that spot so that we can confess our hung and confess the Lord Jesus to be your savior and God when we still have the opportunity let us think about that according to the scripture I read in the Book of Job job said man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble brothers sisters friend family we are pilgrims we come on this Earth for few days as the Bible declares and during the few days there are a lot of troubles and I can tell you sister Isabella had enough TR she was laying on the bed inactive for some nine years everything on the bed where somebody else would even Curse God and say why don't you take my life why do you allow me to suffer like this yes but she was courageous amen looking always for her healing what kind of testimony we are pil as the Bible said for a few days but those few days is full of trouble brother a lot of nobody here is Exempted from troubles there are time we cry time we laugh time we Rejoice time abs and down abs and down to show us that this is not a peaceful place yes sir amen but this morning sister Isabella is at a place of Christ amen younger than she looks like now amen in a special body that's right that can never get sick amen where you will never die yes where you will never complain oh brother sister if they would ask her sister please come back look at the number of people Gathering here for you she will say certainly do your best come and join me over here I don't want to come back I know how painful that life is medicine after medicine pain after pain but there is a hope that one day after we cross the Jordan there is no more pain amen no more sorrow yes it's just living in the presence of God thank you Lord for eternity amen eternity means it will never end amen because eternity never started and if you are Eternal a portion of God is within you amen it can be dant but you need to be quickened by the word of God yes and I'm taking this opportunity to Quicken that portion of God that is in You by reminding you that there is a God this world did not exist by itself yes you did not come on this world by chance there is an invisible power somewhere yes and that power is dealing with each individual before your last day don't you turn down that small voice of God I'm just making some few noise but I know through those noise there is something deeper that God is speaking to each one of you don't you turn it down but consider that one day it might be too late and at a time you might be laying down on the hospital bed where you cannot speak probably you will remember see me standing in front of you by the side of sister Isabella casket but it could be too late my brother it could be too late my sister God is a loving God Amen he will never never let anyone go into judgment before warning yes remember in the days of Noah as the Bible always declare remember the of before the ark was close there was a message yes God always want the people and the way of warning the people is by a message it's not a good message that come with a lot of messages there is always one messenger per age and in this age there is a message yes sir and a messenger yes I'm so happy to testify before you that I met that message some 40 years ago while still living in the combo but I'm originally form after I originally form heaven but I landed in yes sir that's a good one yeah so this is where I come across this message and they told me according to the Bible open your scripture in Malachi 4 the Bible declares he will send you Elijah the prophet before that day amen I said what I read the Bible there is Elijah Elijah was raptured but after Elijah was raptured his Spirit fell upon Elisha and for the first coming of the Lord Jesus there was another Spirit of Elijah on a messenger and the Bible said you will see the spirit of Elijah and people start wondering where is Elijah when they search the Bible they found that Elijah lived a long time ago but it was not the man Elijah but it was the spirit of Elijah that was upon a man called John the Baptist after John the Baptist who was the four hun of the first coming for the Second Coming the same Bible in the Book of Malachi promise there will be Elijah yes sir before a dreadful day and with John the Baptist it was not a dreadful day but now as you see science everywhere declaring that this world has reach the end we look at climate change we look at Wars among Nation everybody is like perplex what shall what will happen brother I'm telling you something is fixing to take place prepare yourself amen there is a secret and sudden going away of the church so as I'm speaking about to watch my time as I'm speaking about Jo Jo the verse two said he cometh for like a flower and is cut down job is refering speaking about the nature even if you cannot understand the language of Elijah but the nature itself is teaching you and I giving the example of the flower a flower even the tree in the natural way we are now in the winter all the leaves of the trees are dried up the branches they don't have fruits and so forth but as soon as this season is over yes we go to Spring we will see the Life coming back again amen now the question is where was the life of the tree the life of the tree was hidden in the woods yes so that means three nature with the four season is teaching us about death burial and Resurrection yes it's not a new tree that will be planted but it's the same tree but the life is just going down and hidden in the wood waiting for the season yes so as human being with the life that is in you and I there is a season yes because job in his trouble job went through a lot of pain job lost his his wife job no I'm sorry job lost his children his belonging to the extent his wife was telling just curse God and die to face until the last minute and during that time J start meditating what is this if this body is going to be dead so what will happen to me and job received an inspiration from nature he said well if the trees which are not created unto the image of God they can season Changing Life birth death burrial and then Resurrection what about me a human being created unto the image of God God will just let me go like that if he can bring back the life of the tree what about me and suddenly the inspiration strike through and that's in the Book of Job still uh Chapter 19 Verse 25 J said for I know that my redeemer liveth amen and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin warms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God Amen that was the greatest Revelation praise God coming from this scripture amen so you know all the great prophets Abraham Elijah and so for they died they went but job is the first one to have the revelation of the Resurrection he said I know and let me tell you this morning I know am and let everyone say I know I know what do you know you you must know that my I know yes regardless of your trouble your difficulties I will let you go with one word I know am they will criticize you just say I know amen those critics will vanish one day sir I know I may not have everything I'm looking for but let me say I know that my redeemer amen thank you Lord if Sister Isabella could speak as we all repeated I know she will say I know or even she will say I knew amen My Redeemer liveth amen even if the Ws of my body you know the Ws are not elsewhere the Ws are in our body just waiting for this per of Life leaves you and then they will take over your body they don't care about how much lotion you put which kind of clothes you wear no sir which kind of perfume you anoint your yourself with the we are inside but said even though it will be the time of manifestation for the ones I know my redeemer believe amen one day I will see God not just a picture but my eyes my own eyes I will see that means there is a resurrection yes sir so there is a hope for our sister Isabel we are just saying goodbye this morning but it's temporary we will say soon we will see each other again am and when we will see each other again oh brother we will forget all the pain amen all the TR of this life what a joyful moment so I'm going to exalt you to do your best not to miss such an opportunity to be present when all said will be gathering in that morning of Resurrection am sister Isabel is just resting and there is another scripture in the Bible saying don't you be troubl [Music] yes and a certain signal the voice of the trumpet the voice of the Archangel the dead in Christ will resurrect amen amen and we will have un corable body in which we are going to live forever so so be ye encouraged and encourage one another family friend isab encourage yourself and ourself there is a promise God is not a man who can promise and fail everything he promised is already done am we have just to take the promise believe it and continue to walk so I will say in closing I know this life is temporary we will have eternal life yes are you prepare for if you are not prepared let this be an opportunity for you to think about before it's too late God has spoken in these last days he has sent a messenger and I'm going to leave you with his name openly his this messenger I came from Africa I heard him being a preached since con his name is William BR he is the Elijah of these days if you never I encourage you you see what the devil trying to cut it off I encourage you to find one of the pastors one of the believer said that man said something about a name was it Abraham Lincoln no I say William Maran he is a Native American he is the Elijah of this who God sent with a message when he said the spirit of Elijah is upon him to unveil all the mysteries of the Bible amen amen may God richly bless you [Applause] amen so we are going to go to the cemetery and uh I don't think that we will be speaking the word of God over there but I want just read a scripture just in case I don't have the opportunity to read it over there that's uh the Book of Genesis chapter 3 verse 19 Genesis 3 verse 19 just to remind us the last step of our life the Bible said in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the C for out of it was thou taken for dust thou are and unto dust shall thou preer may God bless you we are going to Bow our head precious Heavenly Father we want to thank you for the privilege and opportunity to come and pay our last respects to to our sister Isabella Maria Martinez father we thank that this opportunity was given for a purpose I pray that the little portion of the scripture I have read and exalt his audience will make an impact in everyone's life I pray father that you don't let it go in vain because your word is not sent in vain but I believe there was a purpose let that purpose be accomplished let somebody somebody's life be changed as we depart from this place but never from your presence we want to go with our sister to the cemetery and we pray that you give each one of us traveling mercies until the scripture we just read come to pass as we lay our body in the count we thank you for everything as we ask all those things in Jesus Christ name amen amen so at this time we want to thank uh all the families all the
