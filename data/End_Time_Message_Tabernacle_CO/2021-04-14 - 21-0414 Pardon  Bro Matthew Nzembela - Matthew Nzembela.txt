because they have left everything aside and they have come here to speak unto you and to worship you and once again bless the preacher in our church above everything receive honor and power majesty to the century amen we'll read them look chapter 15. okay luke 15. verse 11 and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that fought off to me and it divided unto them is livings and not many days after the younger son got her all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with rochester's living and when he had spent all their arose a mighty famine on the land and he began to be in wants and he went and joined himself to a citizen of the country and he sent him into his field to feed swine and he would he would fend and fill his bed with the ask that the swine did hit and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bred enough to spur and i perish with anger and i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and i am no more worthy to be called a son make me as one of thy heart servant and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet agree a way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and no more worthy to be called a son but the father said to his servant bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring either the fatted cough and kill it lessa eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be mere mary now his early son was in the field and as he came and drew night to the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant and he said unto him thy brother is come and our father el kill the fatted cough because he has received him safe and sound and was angry i would not go in therefore came his father out and entreated him and answering to his father lord this many years do i serve thee neither transgressed thee at any time that commanded me and yet that never gave me a kid that i might make merry with my friends by soon as this the son was come which have devoured a living with our lords that has killed for him the father cough and he said unto him son thou have her with me and know that i have is dying it was meat that we should be merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and now is found 8 28 28 roman 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god and to them who are they called according to his purpose verse 29 for whom it did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover um indeed predestinates you also called and um equate them you also justify and whom you justify them you also glorified if god be for us we can be against us our father creator of heaven and earth once again we thank you lord jesus christ for the opportunity to be called into your house tonight jesus christ lord jesus christ i know by myself i cannot do anything but with you i can't do something spirits of destruction those that came he said that you read the stone that was cast with our hands he said that stone was crying grace grace grace jesus christ now take the control of the service now i'll offend you so you'll have glory at the end of the service oh not the jesuit christian in the name of jesus christ amen amen in fact once again may the lord bless you you know in the bible what we just read in luke chapter 11 the bible was talking about the two boys that were in their father's service and as the bible was telling us one came to his father and he told him dad i want you to give him my portion so i may go away to do my business by university and he went and joined himself to a citizen of the country and he sent him to the field to feed swine versus it verse 17 and when it came to himself i'm no more worthy to be called i said make me as one of the higher servants and here we can understand that he's talking about forgiveness that's why tonight is based on the forgiveness in 1963 october venture our 28th october after reading roman 8 what we just read 63 28 october when i come among the pentecostal people a few years ago wish the lord sent me over when you're over then you remain foreign okay over my weight okay okay 25. may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and now i want to speak on the subject of burden now listen carefully about what i'm saying i love to read but when i met a lot because if you come with questions i'll tell you i was there i was not the one who tell this boy now at the moment i will know how to answer you through brother broadband now okay i think i've been saying the bible said here tonight that it gave us all things well we certainly could not speak on all things but we will take one thing that he has given us that is pardon and i think that's a glorious word to be pardoned because we are all guilty of sin we have all seen and come short of of the glory of god and god through his son has broadened us from this guilt of iniquity and sin 26 and a pardon reminds me of a story i read once of the revolutionary war i believe it was that there was a man a soldier foot soldier that had did something that was the court had found him guilty and was sentenced to be shot i believe he was neglecting the post of duty in time of battle and was going to be killed by a firing squad and one fellow felt so sorry for this man until the final made his way to the great president lincoln the pastor asked me to read it in french also and one photo felt so sorry for this man until he finally made his way to the great prison lincoln lincoln being a christian gentleman they said he was riding up in his carriage when the messenger met him and he fell upon his knees and said mr wrinkled the president of the united states cancer he said i ask mercy for one knowing that you are a christian and know that you have turned the nest in your heart for the weary he said my friend was at the pose of duty where he was testing but when the guns was worrying and the cannon firing he got scared and left the post of duty mr lincoln it didn't mean to do it he is a good man and now in a week from this day he must die by a firing squad there is no way to save him except you will sign his burden mr lincoln with tears in in his eyes pulled a piece of paper from his brief and wrote on ear i abram lincoln polled in this man of such and shall not die and sign his name to it and the man gave him god's blessing and returned back to the prison and said to his friend i have your pardon and he put it out upon a piece of paper and showed to him and the man said don't mock me here i am fixing to die and then come with such as that i do not believe it i just can't believe that it is not so any man could sign his name abraham lincoln he said but this is the president's signature said you are burdened and returned his back and walk away and the man died under the firing squad 33 and then here is a release from abraham lincoln the president of the united states to release this man and yet they shot him so it was tried in the federal court and here was the decision a pardon is not a problem unless it be accepted that has a problem so it is tonight that read that god gives us all things and it gives us burden it is important to those who want to accept god's word as burden but if only judges read it it doesn't mean that you are potent it means that you have got to accept it as your pardon that god gave his son to die in your stead and then it is important release from guilt is what we wish to place on this important from god is a release from guilt now they're turning away from psychological doctrine of some sort that might in some way give you a little feeling that you have done what's right but joining church oh taking up some creed but it is a release from your guilt by the power of calvary something has released you there is no more guilt the bible says i believe in romans 5 1 ok mercy thank you i was trying to look at the dictionary la definition pardon the definition of the word in the dictionary is an action to be released from a guilt in offense of the offense uh to not make the the person accountable for his mistakes oh to not have resentment oh it's that person you know in matthew 18 21 the bible me and i'll forgive him till seven times jesus jesus said i said not on today but until 70 times seven hello therefore is the kingdom of god lacking unto a certain king which would take account of his servants [Music] hmm we gave him the depth where verse eventually very strong but the same servant went out and found one of his favorite servants which owed him 100 pence and he laid hands on him is forgive not every one of his brothers their trespasses we allow you but now here piano oh should i forgive to my fellow servant seven times if he's seen again jesus said jesus told him not seven members of san diego but i'm telling you seventeen times seven men tell us but now it is best to you to make the mouth every it means you are on the obligation to forgive him he [Music] ah she did something that didn't place you elvia is the demand power she calmly asked for forgiveness oh annie forgive me you know i didn't know what i have done wasn't right uh it couldn't hurt you well okay and you say okay i'll forgive you and the next day she does something she cut my ass for forgiveness give me what i've done should be the same way you should ask him for forgiveness because she is the daughter of sir it is not you are under your cross oh i am the head of the house i could not go ask for forgiveness not a good attitude for a believer because that daughter she also needs to hear from your mouth forgiveness [Music] there is a trust yes there is something that says trust in somebody oh when you do something evil you say forgive me oh the other one when you listen to it don't set the person up the other one will have more choices i was so overwhelmed i made the decisions to talk to laurie i was not home i didn't like it you are present jesus christ before praying for must shut you that lie every day he said i have more trust in you in question and answers [Music] oh something bad some please or without more love the bible said jesus jesus said okay that's your yeah [Music] venn word that you have you know that they took the relevant the bible said you will be all held accountable for everything but what kind of people should be there jackie son called people yeah oh seriously full of love oh now be fooling around it is in my nature well tell prophet brother what a prophet it could be ambrose because to ask for forgiveness but you cannot ask for forgiveness is i have more saliva when i have to make something oh all kinds of things hey they thought they thought that um any time to another my family even my wife tells me i love bill then bill jd i was saying she said jesus i play with kids they say i play with you of something similar up his post of duty along the way then that person has to be fired when they went to abram and possible they think that was impossible [Music] and your father comes up something similar i love bill and she said man bill you go again oh that i may stop doing this this morning when you do the same thing yes sir you must repent yourself i'm not saying you reason why in the message we don't move forward because we don't have the life of prayer every night how to gather people for not praying my mind said [Music] why dad still love the child is he took i shall die it is a good thing genesis 50. genesis 50. they [Music] before he died as joseph i so shall you say unto joseph i'll forgive her pray thee the trespasser of the brevant anderson for they did unto the evil well done mentally appreciate the taste of they said we tell them and now we pray forgive the trespass of the servant of thy father i say forgive the trespasser and joseph when they spoke unto him and his brethren also went to the philippines they fell down before his face and they said no summit yourself you already be thy servants joseph joseph sit onto them for emma in the place of god comforted them says joseph selectively joseph is the type of christ that's also some effect that you might should be exclusive we are made in christchurch that's the character of a true believer joseph woman are they thought joseph will return evil to evil i've even been joseph rich in justice they say oh joseph no someone let's say that we are the servant of your god the god of [Music] but that is not a good attitude boom forever let me discuss this ballaram says this daily massage in the mess that's the message uh serpent seeds burden otherwise and you bring [Music] [Music] [Applause] is blessed be the name of the lord okay benny i thought when he said short exaltation i thought he is starting the message sometimes god leads his servant in a certain way alfaj conducive service in southern manila it's not the length of what has been preached but if we can take every bit of the word that that was pronounced i think it will do good to us as brothers and sisters they come to of course yourself we have a duty to encourage one another mistakes will be always part of our life but when there is a love projected my you will change those mistakes into an opportunity to assist resolution she says there are an opportunity and when there is real love you will not even see those mistakes remember you will see what is in you if you have god in you unfold you will see god all the time in your brother and your sisters dear to your father vodka of houses if you don't have enough god see we've never passed the day you have more of a devil diablo you will see always evil after evil but um he said maybe faith will is always based on forgiveness and now we have also i mean he said so many things that's why i always like to take notes uh when i go meditate i take the paragraph shape on the paragraph i read it again and i pray you take the scripture you read it again because you know if you take one time i was in a church here it's a very important glacier say another church one of the evening service learn to salvage the soil the pastor came he said i have my bible here my bible randomly he opened somewhere this is the scripture open you will see the leadership of the spirit with all of our country there is pray and that's why i always said that reminds me again we all the minister it was like 11 ministers in the church have actually meniscus to come on the glaciers was not in the service many people sell this he came on a sunday eleven years oh pastor lady but gave him another scripture excuse me pastor excuse me 10 minutes is nothing else he took maybe 45 minutes he'll appreciate minutes oh but the bottom line brother sister this bible point of career you can say i'm gonna lock myself somewhere read from the beginning to the end you will still miss a lot of time you take the same verse you read it every day every day you find something different so that's why we um brother branham said a christian must read his bible and pray because it's not like reading a newspaper no but if you are expecting to get something message that on the other cake shows god will always speak to you and every day we have a need we have a problem we have we need the solution and i believe if you say every day i read some what is the the longest summit ah sunday school so every day you read that song and what is the shortest story you read it every day and you say god speak to me in your power every day you will get something so we thank god for the inspiration for inspiration you know in the army they don't play it happened that you are in the front line enough unless you receive an order from the leader a monkey death row to enter seed for one time today he went to the highest level to ask for forgiveness and the president did not have a lot of things took a piece of paper forgiven lincoln abraham lincoln go give to them it was up to that person person and then when they killed him i couldn't reach a way his friend was so mad son i'm but the final decision came finally forgiveness is forgiveness if received as forgiveness brother in short every day god is calling you jesus god calling me je m'appelle and god a jew want to make sure racial i see way dead okay we are forgiven god want to make sure that we are forgiven all our mistakes all our wrongdoing to no photo god doesn't count the controversy very difficult for married men to ask for forgiveness to their wife and that was the leadership of the spirit speaking to our hearts to tell our country very often we try always to find excuses christopher said it where there's excuse but the word of god is calling us to be humble if you want to go up the way is always down to the sound do you know if you have a wife who never asked for forgiveness survivors have been from kingdom party power the best way to teach her that for something [Music] for children that's the way god is looking at all of us and that's why he is sending the words to correct us so let us stand on our feet based on what uh what was spoken by this you say many things was spoken to we are going to sing this song we need a heart that is flexible ornamental flexible a broken heart thank you you know the bible said in the book of ezekiel i will give you a new heart not a stoney heart buying child but a heart man curl that is flexible he is flexible and the god has already created that heart attack creates a girl and that heart [Music] me [Music] oh within me [Music] me [Music] away [Music] [Applause] [Music] sports [Applause] screaming for me [Applause] [Music] me [Music] within me
