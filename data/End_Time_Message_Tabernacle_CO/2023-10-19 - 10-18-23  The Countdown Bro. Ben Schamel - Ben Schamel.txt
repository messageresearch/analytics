we are depending on without the blood of Jesus I'm just wondering I'm just wondering demand where would we be amen amen let that blood cover each and every one of us T So before the preaching of the Gospel I would like to invite the entire congregation to stand to pray uh there has been a prayer request made since yesterday for brother Billy Paul Bram who is in the [Music] hospital don't follow the social media uh he's in the hospital and uh I think you your and my prayers will make a difference and also to remember uh brother Donnie ran from uh Happy Valley Church what's the new church name H Word of Life in Tennessee Word of Life uh he's uh the pastor of uh brother darl W that you know and uh David Sy David Sy uh I heard this morning this today he has lost his daughter of about [Music] uh I don't know exactly age but around the 40s so shall we our head to pray for those [Music] cases [Music] [Music] spee [Music] [Music] you [Music] this [Music] PR [Music] [Music] most gracious Heavenly Father we want to thank you for the breath of life you have given to us as we are thinking about our brothers and sisters around the world we want to come before you with this prayer request Lord to add also our little prayer to the rest of the world praying for brother Billy [Music] PA you are are the greatest physician you know what is going on we pray father that your Mighty hand can visit him that you may use also all the medical personnel who are treating him either they understand or they don't but you do we pray for the supernatural [Music] healing according to your perfect will we want also to remember the ran family for the loss of their daughter spouse mother sister that you bring the Comfort to their heart we want also to remember the bti [Music] family the family family who are going to lay their daughter mother sister at at her final Dwelling Place on this Earth we pray now father that you anoint your servant who's going to speak to us that you use him for the preparation of our soul as we reach the last stage of this Earthly Journey remember also Israel your people fighting the enemy you be their God bless us now as we are listening to your word ask this in Jesus Christ name amen amen as we are still standing we need to bring uh brother Ben shaml to the platform sh As we sing Amazing Grace am gra How Sweet Day [Music] sound D he like [Applause] me I [Music] once was lost but now I found was BL but now I [Music] see was [Music] gra my heart to Fe and gra my feet [Music] how [Music] preious [Applause] D Happ de [Music] I in amen amen is that our prayer this evening Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wret like me I think to a True Believer that song just never gets old every time I hear it it just brings a smile to my face because it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter where you've been but we serve a Great and Mighty God the man that wrote that song was a slave trader a fornicator a cheater but he wrote Amazing Grace we're just so happy to be here with you this [Music] even we just want to say thank you to brother f for giving us the opportunity amen we're just very blessed and we don't take these things lightly so we just have a small thought as you know I'm not a a deep [Music] preacher we just take what the message says and remind you what he said and as long as we stay with the message we know that we're on track amen so if you have your scriptures and you would turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11 very familiar scripture here brother Bram takes this section of scripture many different ways Hebrews chapter 11 verses 1 two and three the scripture says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of go ahead go ahead for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear [Music] amen Amen Let bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you yet once more Lord Lord just asking that you would be with us just this once more Lord we just ask that you would come down in the service tonight Lord that you would just make yourself real to us tonight Lord our desire is to draw closer to you even though the world is against us Lord we've set aside this time to come and to study your word to Worship You So Lord we just ask that you would prepare our hearts for the word Lord that I might be able to get myself out of the way that I wouldn't preach any of my thoughts but that as a congregation we might be able to find the channel of of the holy spirit because Lord we still believe that you are real and we believe that you are here so Lord if we could just get into the channel of the Holy Ghost Lord we believe we can grow we just be with you amen amen amen you may be seated so with this little scripture reading [Music] here brother brandham takes these three verses and he preaches the [Music] countdown and if I could this evening just take the same title he brought and title it the countdown and brother brandham just points out how we can look at the world and see where we're at and I just believe that today more than any other day if we're to look out at the world and see where we're at then we can see that the Rapture is getting close the bride is getting herself ready if the world is getting themselves [Music] ready then that means that the church is getting herself ready brother Bram said if we want to know what time it is then all we have to do is look at Israel and we can see where she's at so can we see where we're at amen amen so brother brandham tells us that the natural types the spiritual and growing up in the message I know this is a struggle for me that so many times we hear these idioms or these sayings that brother Bram would say and they become so common to us that we don't know what they really mean but brother brandham says that the natural types the spiritual amen we can look at into nature and it's fall time and the the leaves are changing colors what the leaves that were green just a couple weeks ago now they're red and orange and yellow right and it is that natural thing is testifying of a spiritual happening he says the natural types the spiritual but we have to stay with God's provided way there was that story of where brother Brenham went to meet with the uh the Infidel and he gets to talking to him and he says I am an old man and I've never seen God he'd been looking through nature looking for God but he had never seen God he thought but but then when when the prophet comes on the scene and he takes a tree that's been there for 40 years a tree that this man himself had planted and he begins to explain to him the ways of God and he begins to preach to him how the natural types the spiritual and he says there is some intelligence somewhere that is inside of that tree that is telling that tree that it is time to take the sap from the branches that it's time to take the sap from the leaves it's time to take that life and hide it down in the roofs and we can see that happening right now the nights are getting colder we still haven't had a frost so what intelligence is telling all of those trees that it is time to take that life and hide it down in the roof there is some intelligence and brother brandham says because because the gentleman says that's just nature that's just nature it just happens he says if that's just nature then take a a bucket of water you set it on a wood post and nature should take that water down into the ground back up in the right but there is some intelligence somewhere see if you're looking for God then you'll find God and a man who was once an Infidel when a prophet comes on the scene and he begins to reveal that the natural types the spiritual a man that once denied God existed he he could no longer deny that God existed amen because science who does not know God still testifies of God why do you think that the world comes against science so much as young children they're indoctrinating the young kids in public schools saying evolution is true they're trying to replace God with all this time millions of years ago there was nothing and then something exploded and cre created everything that's here really when you step back and think of that it sounds like just a silly fairy tale but brother brandham said the natural types the spiritual so if there's an intelligence inside of that tree telling them that there is a change coming that that tree needs to prepare itself we had a prophet in this age that the voice of God spoke through and that Divine intelligence came down to tell his little bride that there is a change coming the countdown is counting down it's time for a change we need to get ourselves ready just like those trees because we're getting ready for a Rapture we're not going to stay here forever just like the life that's in the tree when it goes down when spring times comes that life is going to come back up again huah amen and we believe that there's a Resurrection coming it's the same intelligence and so many times we just take it lightly we just hear natural types the spiritual and we say amen and we move on and we don't really think of the depth of what brother brandham is saying another one that he says he says you have to have the mechanics and the Dynamics do we have any mechanics people that have studied mechanics then you'll like tonight brother brandom says and once more Lord he says that's where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics he says back all the Dynamics and no mechanics see you've got to put it together but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on Creed it won't burn it chokes up it won't burn it chokes up the flu it will not burn it was it was made for the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by some of the words of God no by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of [Music] God Amen that means when we're reading our scriptures we need to study every word amen because this word is a lot more than what it we when we take it at face value but we need the mechanics and we need the Dynamics so let me let me draw this can I use the board I'm gonna draw for you a diagram of an [Music] engine and you that work in uh or no Machinery you know this very well you know okay fuel comes into an engine right here and then we have a cylinder there's four stages of the cylinder that will come into but this is what they call the piston and this is the cylinder and what happens inside the cylinder makes all the difference because you see brother brandom said for thousands of years mankind had gone with the horse and buggy gone with a horse and buggy and and and then recently they had a scientific breakthrough okay and when we hear scientific breakthrough that's the natural term for Revelation so the natural types of spiritual right breakthrough natural Revelation spiritual are you with me so far so we went thousands and thousands of years with horses and CS the and walking from place to place and then over the last couple hundred years all of a sudden we go to cars and then we go to airplanes and now we go to spaceships that's what they call a breakthrough because mankind came through a mechanical breakthrough all of these other things could come to pass then they could have all of these other inventions built off of this one thing and that's what happens when you begin to read this message and when God begins to start unfolding this Revelation that he's not a god of the past but God is just as real today as he was when he was hanging on the cross and that the days of Miracles have not passed the days of Miracles are now amen then this Revelation this breakthrough will begin to make this this this Bible a brand new book to you and then all of these other Revelations will begin to follow but as long as Satan can tell you that this is is a a word for some other age as long as he could tell you that the third poll is just for brother Bram or this message was just 60 years ago then he's already got you because we aren't applying the word to ourselves today and that's where we need to get to every time we come to church we have to be thinking to ourselves how can I apply this word to me today right now amen not how can I have a Revival some time in the future not how I can Pitchfork this to somebody else but what is God trying to tell me right now because when we come to church as Believers we believe that this is our time to commune with God and maybe you see a face the preacher is up here preaching but it is our job to get ourselves out of the way so we can get into the channel of the holy spirit that God can lead guide and direct us so God can communicate what he [Music] wants amen we're not here to to listen to me I sure hope not that you're not here to listen to me I don't have anything to say Amen but if God has anything to say to you and I can get myself out of the way then great things can happen then Faith Can Build because then your faith is not built on a human but our faith is built on Christ and when the revelation of Faith strikes then God can do the miraculous Amen brother brandham was preaching one time and he said that you guys don't believe in miracles he said you'll never see a miracle until you become a miracle yourself and that Miracle happens when God can take a sinner he can take a for fornicator when he could take a traitor when when he could take a cheater when he could take a sinner and he can miraculously change him into a when he can change him into a Christian when he can change him into a son or daughter of God and when you experience becoming a miracle that's when you can see the miracles happen because people kept asking him if God is here where are all the Miracles if God's working in our church brother fost why don't we see all these Miracles happening Brother Bram said one time he said take a step of Faith he said if you're blind wave your hand in front of your face and see what God will do that's a step of Faith blind you can't see but you're taking God out his word you can't see nothing he said wave your hand in front of your face and see what God will do ameno yes sir and that's just one line in one tape that ought to give us enough faith brother fosten to to go down and if we're blind that we would receive our sight amen he said if you're crippled you can't walk anywhere he said stand up and see what God will do am see what God will do I don't know what your situation is tonight but all I can say is what the prophet said and let's take a step of faith and see what God will do we're taking God out of his word this isn't a message for some other age I don't believe that that that that that that paragraph that brother brandham preached that was recorded audibly that was recorded on paper for me me to listen to for me to read was for somebody else in 1962 but I believe that the prophet of God came and he preached that for me today tonight for my situation so I can say God this is my situation tonight I'm waving my hand in front of my face and I'm going to see what your going to do not because I deserve it not because I can earn it because you are God and you are able am praise God but we need the mechanics and the Dynamics and US message Believers we got the mechanics down P mechan mechanic down P we know the mechanics I've got to wear a dress this long or brother fost is gonna get mad at me but they always want to push it huh brother brother brother brand starts preaching one time and there's this man who wants to go across the dangerous mountain range this is in the days of the horse and and and buggy and there were three three taxi drivers with these horse and Buggies and he's one of the first one pipes up he said I am such a good driver I can run my horse full speed around that [Music] mountain get that cart within six in of the edge and I can make it all the way around the mountain well the second one he goes well I can run my horses with within three in of the edge all the way around the mountain the third man he says well what about you he says well I I don't know I just like to go real slow and I don't like to hug the The Edge but I want to hug the mountain side as close as I can all the way around just so I make sure I make it there safely well which one do you think the gentleman [Music] took so don't push the edge let's not see how how high our skirts can go before we get past the [Music] edge simple right let's just get there safe let me just ER on the side of God but scientific things type the spiritual things uh and brother Bram begins to say he says that the horse and buggy was an age for a long time and then the right Brothers come up with a breakthrough and they come to a Pentecostal age here's what's interesting I believe the wri brothers had their first flight in 1906 1906 I believe [Music] somewhere brother Bram comes out and says that the right Brothers had a natural happening of a spiritual type within two years of when the right brother had their first flight was when the isusa Street Revival happened who could have typed those together except for amen and you want to say the prophet's not [Music] true but he said we're we're we're we're getting off the ground now and we're we're reaching this Pentecostal age our feet have now left the ground we're getting up into the heavens now amen here's what another interesting thing 1961 is when the first man went to space within two years the seals break and brother brandom says I I won't call you church anymore I will call you bride so that you might understand it's a natural happening of a spiritual type hallelujah amen and without this message where would we be we have to cling to what the prophet is telling us and the more we study it the more Revelation he'll give to you and the more that you can study it the more that he'll give to you so because my little picture is not big enough this is how an engine cylinder works this little plate here it moves up and down the first step is called [Music] intake intake when the fuel comes in and this little plate will be down here and then there's compression and it brings the plate up here it gets really tight a spark hits it and it explodes and it shoots straight back down uh so compression and I'm not good at writing backwards and then expansion and then exhaust ex and that's when the fumes come back out okay that's how an engine works when you intake the word of God you see where we're going with this amen because the natural types the spiritual if you want to grow closer to God all you have to do is look for God everything speaks of him we're doing flight lessons and I'm just thinking oh this is just how God works because everything will testify amen so then compression happens you begin to meditate on that word of God and then you get the mechanics and the Dynamics together and that little spark comes and that's what drives the engine around is that that is is that explosion that happens now brother Bram says that there's always a phase of three justification sanctification filling of the Holy Spirit and we hear that all the time and we hear when when brother brandham says that you could have the Holy Spirit every day of your life and go to hell and that's very confusing for and that's in the the message leadership he says many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he says that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell he says that's what the Bible says exactly right so if if we have this this is my little cylinder and I have blown the top of this off before but we won't do it tonight this is a replica of what a cylinder is like so this is the mechanics and the dynamic is the fuel right well if I just put this here and then I pour gas on top of this and I light it on fire guess what'll happen it go bang no it actually won't it won't if I light the gas on fire then there will be a yellow flame about that tall and it'll burn until the fuel is gone and then the cylinder will be the same as it was before that's what we call an anointing of the Holy Spirit right and that's what many children at a youth camp experience they experience an anointing of the Holy Spirit it creates a fire they're very excited but they don't continue on and then the fire goes away and they remain the same as they were before came same thing when we come to church we roll into church on Sunday morning brother Richard preaches an amazing sermon on Sunday and we walk out those back doors going I am somebody else I am a changed person because we only got an anointing instead of a a filling and a ceiling when the fire goes away we remain the same but here's what's interesting about a gas cylinder is I can fill the cylinder with gas and if I light it on fire then what happens bang right no no it does the same thing here's what's interesting about a cylinder if I put this cap on and I seal it then something changes but that gas that petroleum the same gas that was on top I put it inside and seal it something happens and what happens is that liquid changes and then it's no longer a liquid but it turns into a [Music] gas and so instead of just having an anointing on a part of the [Music] cylinder the inside of the cylinder is full of gas there are gas fumes inside of it that have filled up every crack every aspect on the inside is full of that gas there's no area in your life that the Holy Spirit isn't infiltrating and you have been sealed now because if we took that petroleum and we light it on fire is that little fire going to make your car go 60 mil an hour is that little fire going to put an airplane in the sky but we take the same cylinder we take the same Fuel and we we seal it inside a vessel then when I add the spark then it creates an explosion and the reason I'm not going to demonstrate it for you tonight is that little innocent fire if I took that same Fuel and put it on the inside and I I lit the this little hole in the bottom it would put a big dent in the ceiling because it would blow this lid are you catching what I'm saying we're not just Desiring a a falling of the Holy Spirit like an an anointing but our desire is to be filled with the holy spirit because then when we are sealed with the Holy Spirit and we get the mechanics and the Dynamics then we can have something so we intake the word of God we meditate on the word of God God gives us the spark of Revelation then the last one is the exhaust you can't help but to keep it inside there you would explod you have to share it with somebody the Bible says that the people in Jerusalem could tell that the disciples had been with Jesus because they were in the exhaust phas they were sharing the gospel let me ask you this if you're in the exhaust phase and sharing the gospel then can you at the same time be ashamed of the Gospel no because you are sharing something that is already with inside of you that is bubbling up and over and you can't help to keep it inside but you have to explode you have to share this message with somebody and what is going to do that just the mechanic just having long hair or or long dress one preacher said the message girls they've got it down they've got the long skirts the long hair long face he's on the long uh fast we were up at brother John Andy a couple weeks ago and we were talking and he said there's some churches that if you were going to come in and haul out if somebody died and the Medics come rushing in to find the dead person he said sometimes they'll haul out 16 people before they find the right one because our churches are just so quiet they can't tell which one the Dead one is that's having mechanics and no Dynamics but if you have the the the Dynamics with no mechanics then it doesn't work so we need both to come together and the prophet came to show us how are you with me so faren and I've been trying to take this a little bit slow and I'm I'm already almost past my time horse and buggy cars airplane now here's where brother bam says it in the countdown he says now the right Brothers through their achievement they were able to take science and pattern something here on Earth to show that there was a great spiritual thing fixing to happen within two years within two years and I'm going to have to skip some of these the next [Music] quote brother Bram says questions and answers 59 he said if you were to go out here into this field in the middle of the dark he says oh great electricity electric I know you're in the field and now and now I'm lost I don't know where I'm going give light so I can see how to walk there's enough electricity to light up the field that's true yes sir there's enough electricity in this room to light it without even them lights without that but you have to govern it now you might scream tell that you can't scream no more it never light it up but if you work according to the laws of electricity then you'll get light and then he goes on to say verse 38 is my it's in my 38 he says well that's the same way that it is by God God is the great creator of heavens and earth he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still God but he only works as you follow his laws and instructions amen amen as long as we're following the laws of God as long as we're following him then we can have his results am but so many times we're going where are the Miracles when the scripture says the signs and wonders follow them that believe and we're not believing and then we try to blame God Amen but brother random says we're finally coming to an astronaut amen amenah amen yes sir we're coming to an astronaut age an age where we're not only getting off the ground but we are completely clearing the atmosphere we going to another Land one not made by hands but there's a countdown and the world's countdown starts with 10 and brother brand says it goes 109876 5 4 3 2 1 Z but he but brother random said that is the world's countdown but they have it backwards because God's countdown starts at one and it goes to seven amen it goes first church with Paul and then it goes second Church Third Church fourth Church fifth Church age sixth Church age seventh Church age lift off I'm telling you it's time for lift off church we can see where we're at the countdown is here it's time that we lift off and what's the first thing that happens when the clock strike zero the engines begin to fire gas engine will get an airplane in the sky I'm telling you this rocket isn't run by a gas engine it's run by an atomic power it's run by something so far greater than what Pentecost has something so much greater than what happened on isusa Street something greater than what got all of them shouting something greater going to lift the bride off of this Earth it's going to make us have a body change something greater but you want to just sit there in church sir oh brother fost was preaching about my hair extensions I need to pick up on the boys too we can't just pick on the ladies but boys need to be men enough of those little skinny pants it's time that we grow up well you think the girls out in the world think it's cute I want my hair to look a certain way I want to put highlight tips in it oh I want to wear the flashiest clothes at church I want I want to sing a special and wave this this finger is not got to ring praise the Lord praise the Lord sing the countdown is here it's Blast Off time and the first thing that happens when rocket begins to to to go off you start hearing up yes sir well the Clock

airplane a car they all have a pilot inside see the thing about a rocket is totally different the astronauts are just along for the ride it's not I but Christ amen hallelujah amen but it is Guided by a tower somewhere we are Guided by a tower somewh the greatest message that's ever hit the face of the our age Atomic power am that's guiding you and brother brandom said that radar is prayer you want

the countdown has gone 10 98 and brother Bram ends his prayer and he say 10 N8 seven six six five four three two it's takeoff time so my message tonight is let's make sure we're ready we've already got the dynamic or the the Dynamics and a prophet came to tell us that we're not just looking for an anointing we're we're not just looking for a temporary filling we're looking for a seiling seal amen I don't know what your situation is I don't know what your daily life looks like but I know one thing that it's time to get serious we're running out of time we have to be ready those astronauts are dressed a certain way those astronauts have to have a certain Vision those astronauts had to have studied certain things those astronauts have to be at a specific place they have to be strapped in they had to check all of their gauges you know when you're flying an instrument airplane they're teaching Us in in my instrument training he said if you fly into clouds where you can't see anything you have to rely on your instruments and they said your main focus should be on the indicator in the middle which is called your attitude [Music] indicator and I thought what a name for an instrument but keep an eye on your attitude because that will give you a good idea idea of what all your other instruments are saying am I pitched up or pitched down your attitude indicator will give you a good am I turning right or turning left your attitude indicator will give you a good idea I think it's the same thing in a spiritual walk when we come to church and we're already angry at somebody across the Pew or all this preacher he preaches too long whatever the case [Music] is your attitude [Music] indicator will give you a good idea of what all of your other indic indicators are saying and then sometimes you wonder how brother foston pinpoints you so much because brother F's up here looking at your attitude [Music] indicator with this power that's been given to this church through this message we should be the happiest people amen so whatever your need is tonight we don't have to worry about the Dynamics Christ is here we just have to line up with his word we just have to follow his laws the electricity is already out there just follow his laws and we'll get the results so whatever your need is whatever your situation is this Revelation this Revelation can bring you through final Family Church situations you name it God is here amen let's bow our heads if you have a need just lift it up to the Lord because I believe he's here to answer prayers I believe God comes to answer prayers I don't believe he just comes to hang out but God comes with a [Music] purpose and I believe he's here tonight and if he's here then he has a purpose and that purpose is to meet your need let's just take our needs dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord I've preached my voice out I've I've just been able to to to preach like it was my last message Lord because we don't know when the Rapture

blessings will be so Lord we just come before you with our needs Lord together as a church body a bride body with all of the needs in the church Lord and we're bringing them to you Lord there's nobody
