[55:26] you
[55:42] [Music]
[55:49] should thank
[55:51] you
[55:53] uh May maybe you don't understand what
[55:56] is taking
[55:59] place uh that was a discussion in the
[56:06] court that uh uh yeah Senate yeah that
[56:12] Mark zberg Mark zberg who is the CEO of
[56:17] uh Facebook director the the
[56:20] Facebook he was responding to
[56:26] uh the Senate
[56:30] people who realized that many teenagers
[56:34] have been victim of his
[56:41] product those application
[56:44] Facebook Instagram Tik
[56:47] Tok Facebook Instagram Tik Tok Snapchat
[56:52] does the CEO when they P the uh launch
[56:55] those
[57:01] product they don't allow their own
[57:04] children to use
[57:08] them but who are using
[57:12] it it's on the
[57:15] public and they are making they are
[57:21] billionaires
[57:23] but who are the victim are the
[57:30] children that's why I saw uh the Sunday
[57:35] school teacher teaching the
[57:36] [Music]
[57:42] teenagers I said why don't I want to
[57:44] share a little bit with even the
[57:50] parent you know it's all about business
[57:54] money
[57:57] even if they take them to
[58:00] Congress they cannot stop
[58:03] them it's like when this is the
[58:06] technology of
[58:08] today it's like
[58:11] telephone it's like
[58:13] television back then it caused more
[58:18] disaster than we have
[58:22] today but nobody has stop it
[58:27] uh I saw they are teaching the young
[58:29] people you know this this
[58:35] this but one thing I want to
[58:41] report all this is the devil sitting
[58:47] behind it's the
[58:49] devil Congress cannot stop the
[58:53] devil
[58:55] the only thing they ask Mark is to
[58:57] apologize to the victim uh the
[59:05] families there are children who have
[59:08] died who have been
[59:11] abused who have
[59:14] disappeared do you think a apology is
[59:18] going to solve the
[59:21] problem so that's why I'm talking to the
[59:24] teenager
[59:27] to the parents those
[59:30] applications is intended to destroy your
[59:36] life and I believe the church we have
[59:39] also a certain
[59:43] responsibility
[59:45] but the
[59:47] CEO they will not arrest
[59:50] him because he's saying he's acting
[59:54] because he he has the freedom of
[59:58] expression which is the basis of our
[1:00:02] democracy so the only thing to fight the
[1:00:08] devil is the word of
[1:00:11] God that's why I want to read a little
[1:00:14] bit few quotes
[1:00:17] here uh brother bam said in the
[1:00:22] message the world is falling apart
[1:00:25] paragraph
[1:00:28] 43 so we don't not we don't want to take
[1:00:31] it lightly or our teenager are on Tik
[1:00:34] Tok they say jokes no it's a spirit
[1:00:44] behind and it's not only
[1:00:47] teenagers they are also
[1:00:51] adult watching what they supposed not
[1:00:54] even to
[1:00:56] watch it's not only about
[1:01:01] pornography all the
[1:01:06] things you see young people
[1:01:08] communicating Tik Tok
[1:01:14] Instagram with unknown
[1:01:17] people and then they come and invite you
[1:01:20] to meet
[1:01:23] somewhere is the end of your
[1:01:29] life uh one paragraph
[1:01:40] 43 brother bam said and we see the
[1:01:44] Nations
[1:01:46] today our political and Nation life is
[1:01:50] roten to the
[1:01:53] Core
[1:01:56] Congress will not do
[1:02:00] anything it's all full of
[1:02:04] things or of Television
[1:02:08] corruption all kind of
[1:02:11] dirty filthy
[1:02:14] jokes and
[1:02:16] gags and before our young
[1:02:20] people the schools are so corrupt
[1:02:26] my I'm from
[1:02:28] Arizona I was at one of the big
[1:02:33] school other day and see those young
[1:02:36] ladies and
[1:02:41] men boys out there on the
[1:02:46] campus Waring
[1:02:50] around I said I hope
[1:02:54] I never have to send one of my children
[1:02:58] to place like
[1:03:02] that and such
[1:03:05] corruption yet called
[1:03:09] America some of the worst I have ever
[1:03:13] seen is behavior of American in
[1:03:16] different part of the
[1:03:23] country in the message one in a
[1:03:28] million Bram
[1:03:31] said just let me give you a little
[1:03:34] inside
[1:03:37] something they have made a analysis
[1:03:41] throughout Arizona where I
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:46] live of all the
[1:03:50] schools they gave the children
[1:03:52] unknowingly to them
[1:03:57] a mental
[1:04:00] test they give them a
[1:04:02] test without them being
[1:04:07] aware and guess
[1:04:10] what including high schools and grammar
[1:04:16] schools uh I'm On One in a Million
[1:04:20] paragraph
[1:04:23] 45
[1:04:25] yeah guess
[1:04:31] what including high
[1:04:34] schools and grammar
[1:04:37] schools there was 80% of children
[1:04:41] suffering with mental
[1:04:47] deficiency 70% of them was television
[1:04:53] Watchers
[1:04:58] back there it was the instrument was
[1:05:02] television today it's not television too
[1:05:07] much it's the
[1:05:09] telephone with all the modern
[1:05:13] applications Tik Tok
[1:05:15] Instagram
[1:05:17] WhatsApp
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] see see the evils
[1:05:25] they just sleeped up on
[1:05:31] us slipped up on
[1:05:38] us they have get evil has found room in
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:47] US last
[1:05:49] one
[1:05:52] influences par
[1:05:54] six so we cannot just be happy to send
[1:05:58] our children to Sunday school which is
[1:06:04] good but to follow
[1:06:08] up maybe take those uh
[1:06:14] quot no there those quot with uh
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:22] Senators what over they are debating
[1:06:25] they are debating but the end result is
[1:06:33] known it will be just we noticed it we
[1:06:36] said it
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:42] but influences paragraph six
[1:06:46] influence I think
[1:06:48] today our great
[1:06:52] problem of what we believe to be
[1:06:55] juvenile
[1:06:58] delinquency is a parent
[1:07:04] delinquent a home
[1:07:07] delinquent our people got away from the
[1:07:10] things that they should have stayed
[1:07:16] with the church got larm or
[1:07:21] cold the children got out in the
[1:07:26] world now
[1:07:29] Hollywood puts out lots of movies and
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:38] televisions they talk about
[1:07:41] Hollywood but today it's all those
[1:07:47] CEO creating those
[1:07:50] things have you ask yourself this
[1:07:52] question
[1:07:55] where they get all those
[1:07:58] ideas this uh Mark zuk
[1:08:02] andberg he a young person but where he
[1:08:06] get
[1:08:08] intelligence to create the
[1:08:11] things he's defending himself it's a
[1:08:14] tool to connect
[1:08:17] people it's a tool to promote
[1:08:22] businesses so everything we do as a good
[1:08:25] side and the bad
[1:08:28] side I did not put your children to what
[1:08:30] to do this
[1:08:35] evil I'm a business
[1:08:37] person I'm looking for
[1:08:40] ideas where do those idea come
[1:08:44] from Satan is
[1:08:47] somewhere creating those things to
[1:08:50] destroy our youth generation
[1:08:56] the future of
[1:08:58] tomorrow if we don't see the devil back
[1:09:02] there we cannot take any
[1:09:07] action and he said Hollywood uh puts out
[1:09:12] lots of movies and
[1:09:16] television and so forth that even
[1:09:21] uncensored where they curse and use
[1:09:25] God's name in
[1:09:31] vain and it used to
[1:09:34] be it was wrong for the children in the
[1:09:37] Holiness
[1:09:41] churches to go to uh bioscop or picture
[1:09:48] shows and now
[1:09:51] Satan got One Jump Ahead
[1:09:55] head brother I'm just taking quotes from
[1:09:59] the time of brother
[1:10:03] Bram and try to make it actual
[1:10:10] today to show you that Satan is getting
[1:10:13] a jump
[1:10:16] ahead business will follow the
[1:10:22] connection to give all those
[1:10:25] arguments but the person ahead of
[1:10:29] everything is
[1:10:31] Satan and please young
[1:10:35] people stay away from those
[1:10:40] application and us as a church and

[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:04] you happy to be here this
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:09] morning because Sunday is the day of the
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:16] Lord the day where we think about our
[1:15:18] great
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:22] victory if it wasn't for that day that
[1:15:25] Sunday
[1:15:28] morning what happened about 2,000 years
[1:15:32] ago we wouldn't be
[1:15:35] here and when we come on Sunday
[1:15:40] morning we think about the greatest
[1:15:43] victory that never been
[1:15:47] won that is what makes
[1:15:50] us because we were lost
[1:15:55] without
[1:15:57] hope but somebody that was
[1:16:00] righteous he
[1:16:03] accepted our
[1:16:04] burdens our
[1:16:08] Pains come and support us people
[1:16:10] hopeless like
[1:16:13] us now we don't have any reason to
[1:16:20] worry no reason to worry to complain
[1:16:26] because the cross was done for
[1:16:29] us that is why we
[1:16:32] sing that is why we gather
[1:16:35] together because there's a
[1:16:38] hope because the Hope was there and we
[1:16:42] received it that is why we
[1:16:44] come we don't come
[1:16:48] here as people
[1:16:51] defeated no we come here
[1:16:55] because the calary did
[1:16:58] everything nobody can accuse
[1:17:03] you nobody can tell you
[1:17:09] otherwise Paul says even if an angel
[1:17:11] comes
[1:17:13] down and tells you what God didn't tell
[1:17:18] you
[1:17:22] reject
[1:17:24] there's no one that can tell you other
[1:17:26] because the blood was
[1:17:28] shed that is why we sing I'm
[1:17:34] happy and I also thank the
[1:17:38] pastor for giving me another
[1:17:44] opportunity to come and fellowship and
[1:17:47] to share with you our common
[1:17:50] treasure that the Lord has given to us
[1:17:57] I would like to ask you to see it a
[1:17:58] little
[1:18:05] bit once again I greet you all in the
[1:18:07] name of the Lord Jesus

[1:36:12] [Music]
[1:36:13] dream we are going to read in the Book
[1:36:16] of Daniel chapter

[1:36:26] the Lord speaks through
[1:36:28] vision when he
[1:36:31] speaks a proph has to
[1:36:36] follow we're going to take an an example
[1:36:40] in the Book of Daniel chapter
[1:36:47] 2 uh there was a
[1:36:50] king
[1:36:53] he had a lot of
[1:36:56] dreams but one
[1:36:59] time he had another
[1:37:01] dream and he was
[1:37:04] troubled he was
[1:37:07] troubled the B
[1:37:08] says he couldn't
[1:37:12] sleep when the Lord
[1:37:16] speaks something has to
[1:37:19] shake you won't have any peace
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:24] until you do what the Lord has asked you
[1:37:26] to
[1:37:27] do when the Lord
[1:37:29] speaks you can close your
[1:37:35] eyes you can cover yourself under the
[1:37:40] cover until you do what he has you to
[1:37:44] do it's not up to you it's the Lord
[1:37:50] speaking
[1:37:52] if he
[1:37:53] calls you can stand up and said I don't
[1:37:56] want to go to
[1:37:57] church

[1:42:28] God gives you the dream
[1:42:32] first we have a lot of
[1:42:34] interpret especially in this

[1:42:47] of money but gentlemen do you did you
[1:42:50] see my dream
[1:42:56] we have a lot of
[1:42:58] interpretation but that King was
[1:43:00] inspired he said first give him my
[1:43:03] dream I'll tell you one
[1:43:05] thing the king knew his
[1:43:09] dream because if he give him another
[1:43:12] dream he will recognize not the dream
[1:43:14] that he
[1:43:17] dreamed but he said the thing has gone
[1:43:19] from me
[1:43:23] he wanted to be sure that interpretation
[1:43:25] was
[1:43:26] right because he didn't
[1:43:28] know dreaming know
[1:43:33] it you will know you know you know that
[1:43:36] you are children of God you know that if
[1:43:39] I tell
[1:43:40] you gave you the

[1:43:45] that because from the beginning you knew
[1:43:48] who you
[1:43:49] were
[1:43:53] and the King
[1:43:55] said if you give me
[1:43:58] my then I'll will know the
[1:43:59] interpretation is
[1:44:01] correct for
[1:44:04] me to know the interpretation is right
[1:44:06] just give me my dream
[1:44:14] first uh what the king is
[1:44:17] asking no man on the earth can do it
[1:44:23] only the king the gods that dwells in
[1:44:26] the Heavenly
[1:44:29] places what the king is
[1:44:32] asking only God can do
[1:44:35] it if you have
[1:44:38] God it will give you the interpretation
[1:44:41] of your
[1:44:43] life but the age in which we're living
[1:44:46] in the problem that we have
[1:44:49] now the dream has gone from
[1:44:53] us the dream has gone from
[1:44:57] us we are coming in the
[1:45:03] message we thought that we really
[1:45:08] dreamed but somehow the
[1:45:12] dream we don't we don't know our
[1:45:15] identity in the message we in the
[1:45:17] message as just uh
[1:45:21] brother
[1:45:23] said I will read it
[1:45:27] rapidly amn I believe in the message
[1:45:31] spiritual
[1:45:36] Amnesia
[1:45:39] says it's a
[1:45:43] very the state the church is right
[1:45:47] now it's dise of meure it's a very
[1:45:51] serious
[1:45:53] case the Bible
[1:45:56] says you are naked and you don't know
[1:46:01] it that is the case of the Church of
[1:46:04] they don't
[1:46:07] know it's a very serious dangerous
[1:46:11] case people they don't know who they
[1:46:14] are and Os came
[1:46:17] out and it did the DI
[1:46:21] that of that
[1:46:26] church he
[1:46:28] said
[1:46:30] God does
[1:46:32] nothing without revealing his
[1:46:35] secret speaking through his
[1:46:44] Prophet I try to take notes and to give
[1:46:47] out for us to
[1:46:49] read
[1:46:53] the way I
[1:46:55] prepar I didn't know what to give us so
[1:46:58] they can
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:05] project we are going to read
[1:47:08] together the Prophet The Prophet says
[1:47:14] this I certainly blast
[1:47:19] it
[1:47:22] okay he was certainly
[1:47:27] blasted okay he will certainly blasted
[1:47:30] with all that was in
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:37] him
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:41] exp for he had D the
[1:47:45] Lord and he couldn't do
[1:47:49] nothing but
[1:47:53] that he found them in that
[1:47:57] day with a bad case of
[1:48:02] disease spiritual
[1:48:06] amnia and that's just exactly why we got
[1:48:12] today that's why the
[1:48:14] prophet he
[1:48:17] got
[1:48:19] he
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:22] that's why we got today
[1:48:25] brother I want to have you can be in am
[1:48:30] but you don't know
[1:48:35] theet the church doesn't know the
[1:48:41] condition they pleased that they
[1:48:47] belong but they don't know
[1:48:51] when you come to that
[1:48:53] word you have to identify yourself with
[1:48:56] the
[1:48:57] word become the
[1:49:01] word it's not the knowledge of the
[1:49:04] word it's to become the word the prophet
[1:49:10] says the cause of the
[1:49:15] Amnesia it's that people don't know who
[1:49:17] they
[1:49:19] are
[1:49:21] what causes
[1:49:25] Amnesia when you came to the
[1:49:29] message you you have
[1:49:33] Zeal I
[1:49:35] remember in the morning when I woke
[1:49:38] up I had to go see all the
[1:49:42] brother because I thought go to the
[1:49:44] rupture because I didn't want to miss
[1:49:46] the
[1:49:47] rupture and when I see some the brothers
[1:49:50] then I can I can say the rupture hasn't
[1:49:52] taken place yet we were under the
[1:49:58] emergency because now we took and then
[1:50:02] we we start looking
[1:50:05] what pay attention to what others
[1:50:08] does we
[1:50:13] failed we just want to be members of the
[1:50:17] church but the message took out from the
[1:50:20] church not to build another church but
[1:50:24] the message called us to prepare
[1:50:27] us to meet the
[1:50:30] Lord we
[1:50:32] came we a
[1:50:35] group we comfor each other and we forgot
[1:50:39] the
[1:50:41] purpose why God called
[1:50:44] you we completely forgot
[1:50:47] it but I want this morning
[1:50:51] to renew our
[1:50:53] emergency to know that
[1:50:55] today it can be our last
[1:50:59] meeting how are you going to meet the
[1:51:01] Lord Jesus
[1:51:02] Christ how are you going to speak to the
[1:51:04] Lord Jesus Christ how you going to tell
[1:51:08] Jesus you understand it was
[1:51:13] difficult how are you going to tell
[1:51:17] Jesus all this time you've been sitting
[1:51:19] on the pews
[1:51:25] you can't identify
[1:51:28] yourself when the prophet
[1:51:30] comes is to tell you who you
[1:51:33] are it comes with the
[1:51:36] prophy so that the ego can identify
[1:51:41] themselves not to identify thems in the
[1:51:45] courtyard but when they recognize in the
[1:51:48] cour yard am the chicken
[1:51:51] they know they have wings to
[1:51:54] fly it's not just
[1:51:57] to spread it out and to work to fly
[1:52:03] upu has to
[1:52:05] work to
[1:52:08] have the B says she was working night to
[1:52:12] the point where B
[1:52:15] came the work of Ruth
[1:52:18] attracted
[1:52:20] the work of Ru
[1:52:22] attracted it's not the beauty ofu but
[1:52:24] it's the work of
[1:52:28] Ruth a Christian when he comes to church
[1:52:32] he comes to
[1:52:33] work he works every
[1:52:37] day what you yest that's not who you are
[1:52:41] today because you read one more
[1:52:44] verse and you believed
[1:52:48] it
[1:52:50] the case
[1:52:52] today and people are in
[1:52:55] Amnesia what causes
[1:52:59] Amnesia three things that causes
[1:53:05] Amnesia you know when
[1:53:10] somebody was in the accident and the the
[1:53:13] the the thing was really
[1:53:16] hard sometime he he lost his memory
[1:53:20] he can't he can't recognize where he
[1:53:24] is maybe he can take time to recognize
[1:53:27] his
[1:53:30] name the first thing that causes Amnesia
[1:53:33] it's a
[1:53:35] shock they shock caus Amnesia the shock
[1:53:38] causes Amnesia shock what shock they
[1:53:41] shock the do shock of
[1:53:48] Doctrine it will
[1:53:52] not it will not Rapture
[1:53:58] you Doctrine will not H
[1:54:02] you it just drives you
[1:54:07] away I spent a lot of time without
[1:54:10] seeing my sister and
[1:54:13] then one day I went to her
[1:54:16] City at that time we didn't have phone
[1:54:20] she didn't know I was going to
[1:54:23] come she wasting at home she saw me
[1:54:26] coming she ran to me and she huged me oh
[1:54:30] my brother oh how are you I said I'm
[1:54:34] well and she
[1:54:36] stopped do you believe that the tunders
[1:54:39] are
[1:54:40] revealed I said I believe all the word
[1:54:43] and then she was
[1:54:46] disappointed with the joy is gone
[1:54:49] because
[1:54:52] people that believe the if you
[1:54:55] them you will get
[1:54:58] it that's the
[1:55:01] doctr shock
[1:55:03] of and they don't people don't know
[1:55:05] where to
[1:55:07] go they fall into the
[1:55:14] Amnesia the second thing that put people
[1:55:16] in
[1:55:17] Amnesia it's worries
[1:55:21] yes they don't
[1:55:25] know if Pastor is a servant of they
[1:55:30] worry they start looking
[1:55:37] elsewhere he cannot work with all energy
[1:55:41] because he has worries in his
[1:55:44] heart worries takes away Faith right
[1:55:48] right right
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:55] to take advantage of his ministry have
[1:55:57] to believe in that man with all his
[1:56:00] weak or everything will be saying won't
[1:56:03] help
[1:56:04] you you have to start from
[1:56:10] there the third
[1:56:14] thing it's where when you don't know
[1:56:17] where to go that's why the prophet Bram
[1:56:21] said when you are split between two
[1:56:25] opinion you won't have any
[1:56:29] position you have to choose your
[1:56:32] church and your own
[1:56:35] church you
[1:56:37] always you are visitor
[1:56:39] everywhere you are in Amnesia brother
[1:56:43] wake
[1:56:45] up amnesia is a bad
[1:56:48] case
[1:56:51] you have to leave to quit
[1:56:54] Amnesia
[1:56:56] said amnia made the
[1:56:59] king with all his
[1:57:02] Gods he forgot that he was a
[1:57:05] king he went to
[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:09] eat he stay with the Beast seven animals
[1:57:12] seven
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:16] years it's a terrible case
[1:57:20] sometime you don't
[1:57:21] realize the church is inia
[1:57:26] now it's the time to
[1:57:29] understand there's a spiritual sickness
[1:57:32] that is really
[1:57:35] bad the devil is just ping you you're a
[1:57:38] Son of God Son the Son of God without
[1:57:44] work I will show you my
[1:57:48] work
[1:57:50] what do you do for
[1:57:58] God you may think that I'm speaking of
[1:58:00] somebody else but you have to understand
[1:58:03] that
[1:58:04] Amnesia it's that you don't you can't
[1:58:07] recognize
[1:58:08] yourself you can't identify yourself you
[1:58:11] don't know the prophet
[1:58:13] says when you
[1:58:15] identify if you say you're
[1:58:18] American you bear the shame of America
[1:58:21] you bear the glory of
[1:58:25] America everything that America is you
[1:58:29] are if you're a
[1:58:31] Christian you bear the shame chity you
[1:58:36] bear the glory of Christianity
[1:58:39] everything that Christ is you
[1:58:45] are you are seeking
[1:58:48] perfection
[1:58:50] God works in
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:56] humility even Paul that wrote
[1:58:59] the there are people that
[1:59:04] left deas has foren me the prophet
[1:59:09] says that deas that brother deas didn't
[1:59:12] go back
[1:59:13] to he didn't go to the
[1:59:17] tavern everything
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:23] he thought that the ministry of Paul was
[1:59:26] done because Paul was
[1:59:30] crying he had a sickness that God
[1:59:32] couldn't heal
[1:59:34] him while was
[1:59:37] walking his own shadow was Healing The
[1:59:41] Sick but it happens that he pray for
[1:59:44] himself must looked he said this man
[1:59:48] doesn't have God anymore
[1:59:52] that is why you see people leaving the
[1:59:57] church but they they leave God there in
[2:00:02] Simplicity because they look to
[2:00:05] the they looked up the the pastor
[2:00:08] couldn't do this the shouldn't have done
[2:00:12] this I don't know where people have the
[2:00:15] meaning things of a
[2:00:17] pastor let's go back to to the
[2:00:22] word the prophet
[2:00:25] [Music]
[2:00:28] says paragraph
[2:00:31] 37 what I told you about the
[2:00:34] causes of
[2:00:37] Amnesia the prophet describes it
[2:00:39] there it says paragraph
[2:00:43] 40 when you
[2:00:46] have you can't identify yourself
[2:00:51] you cannnot identify
[2:00:55] yourself but when you identify
[2:00:58] yourself you identify to Christ and
[2:01:02] Christ is the
[2:01:04] word everything you shall ask the father
[2:01:06] in my name I will do it he cannot
[2:01:10] lie he said heaven will pass
[2:01:13] away my word will never pass
[2:01:18] away what are you
[2:01:20] worried it's not
[2:01:25] Amnesia am spiritual
[2:01:31] amnia it's something that destroys
[2:01:36] the I saw the pastor projecting a video
[2:01:39] I was
[2:01:46] troubled but it's the target is the
[2:01:48] church
[2:01:52] when the brother
[2:01:54] says invasion of
[2:01:57] America it says invasion of
[2:02:00] families the
[2:02:02] purpose the target is the families
[2:02:05] destroy families that is the purpose of
[2:02:07] the
[2:02:08] devil we were thinking
[2:02:11] with in the old
[2:02:13] time we were sitting with
[2:02:17] theing and that was creating atmosphere
[2:02:21] we were growing with atmosphere but
[2:02:24] today the child is on the side
[2:02:27] with is on his phone on Mom on
[2:02:35] YouTube
[2:02:36] that's that's not why the devil wanted
[2:02:39] to destroy the family to divide you
[2:02:41] there's no Fellowship in
[2:02:43] the and the
[2:02:45] church the church is not here start from
[2:02:50] home if you have two
[2:02:53] families uned at
[2:02:56] home in a true fellow you have a strong
[2:02:59] church
[2:03:08] then the devil is targeting
[2:03:11] you the time to give testimonies you on
[2:03:15] YouTube what are you looking
[2:03:17] for you have the message of what are you
[2:03:22] looking it's not a curiosity of
[2:03:26] he trying to taste something
[2:03:31] more that's the human
[2:03:33] nature when they got out of EG they
[2:03:37] played they
[2:03:39] danced and they eat man they were
[2:03:43] happy but after a few
[2:03:46] month they said don't we have anything
[2:03:48] else just man man every
[2:03:54] day God is full of
[2:03:57] love we are his
[2:03:59] children because things that we do we
[2:04:02] ask God I want this when God gives we
[2:04:07] are tired of it there was a
[2:04:10] mother who gave birth to a child and the

[2:15:57] wives he was fighting with my mothers
[2:16:00] all the time I didn't love that life
[2:16:02] since I was in the
[2:16:04] Seminary I thought I was out of the I
[2:16:07] was so
[2:16:09] happy when I saw the pr hugging and
[2:16:13] kissing the the
[2:16:14] nun I was
[2:16:16] troubled said I thought this man was
[2:16:20] holy now he's doing things like my
[2:16:23] dad I was troubled I was
[2:16:27] young and I went back to see my dad I
[2:16:30] told
[2:16:31] Dad I don't want to go back
[2:16:33] there he said you have to go there you
[2:16:36] have to stay
[2:16:38] there I didn't know how to explain to my
[2:16:42] dad
[2:16:46] finally I left the in the middle of the
[2:16:48] year I went I
[2:16:50] left what I wanted to say I was not in
[2:16:54] my place and there God was burning in my
[2:16:58] heart I left the Seminary because I
[2:17:01] didn't see God I was
[2:17:04] sincere they disappointed
[2:17:07] me I couldn't stay there I
[2:17:11] left my father kicked me out of the
[2:17:14] house and since then I started going
[2:17:20] I went to the Baptist Church they were
[2:17:22] preaching
[2:17:23] There They Don't Preach with the Bible
[2:17:26] they in
[2:17:27] the they were they were preaching with
[2:17:29] the books coming from
[2:17:30] war and there I saw them the Bible the
[2:17:33] preaching of the Bible I was so happy I
[2:17:36] stayed with the Baptist after a
[2:17:40] while I saw Baptist started drinking a
[2:17:42] little bit and then I said I don't think
[2:17:46] I don't think I to serve God drinking
[2:17:48] alcohol I
[2:17:50] left I went from church to
[2:17:55] church
[2:17:57] until one day I crossed this
[2:18:02] message I identify myself I was
[2:18:06] thinking that is why I preach on
[2:18:09] Wednesday when you tell me this message
[2:18:11] is wrong tell me where to
[2:18:14] go if you show me to the Baptist I've
[2:18:17] been there
[2:18:18] if you show me to the Catholic I've been
[2:18:22] there where should I go
[2:18:28] now I only have one hope is this
[2:18:32] message you have to identify
[2:18:35] yourself let no one take away that
[2:18:40] hope there was a lady that was a
[2:18:44] when prayed for her
[2:18:49] she had aach pain she went
[2:18:53] home she started testifying I'm Healed
[2:18:56] I'm Healed I'm Healed and her husband
[2:19:00] said hone you can't even
[2:19:03] heat
[2:19:05] keepy you bringing shame on the message
[2:19:09] he
[2:19:10] said she told her
[2:19:13] husband the only hope that I have you
[2:19:16] want to take that away for
[2:19:19] me the only hope that we have this
[2:19:24] message when somebody comes and show you
[2:19:29] mistak that's the only hope I have
[2:19:32] left you want to take that away from
[2:19:38] me we don't have any
[2:19:40] other all that we have to do is to leave
[2:19:44] the
[2:19:45] amesia the world is upon us
[2:19:49] the world is upon
[2:19:50] us what people started
[2:19:53] doing is to build like the
[2:19:58] world they wanted to be like the
[2:20:01] world if
[2:20:04] really we can believe
[2:20:07] [Music]
[2:20:08] sincerely it's here that we can find
[2:20:11] Natural
[2:20:16] Woman things put
[2:20:18] on you don't put it for
[2:20:21] God you are putting it for
[2:20:24] men but you have to live for
[2:20:31] God that beauty that you put on do you
[2:20:34] do that for
[2:20:37] God
[2:20:42] says was putting on uh things for the
[2:20:46] man for the men
[2:20:50] but when God
[2:20:51] you and you identify yourself you don't
[2:20:54] live for men you live for
[2:21:04] him but how to get out of that nation
[2:21:07] that is upon the
[2:21:11] church something that is in joy that
[2:21:14] makes me happy it's
[2:21:19] the elect will not be
[2:21:22] deceived the devil can come any way he
[2:21:26] wants when the elect will hear me as
[2:21:28] he's hearing me right
[2:21:30] now he will take the
[2:21:33] stand because that's the word that was
[2:21:35] sent for him it's not for the
[2:21:38] world everybody can hear
[2:21:43] listen but it's not given to
[2:21:46] everybody
[2:21:48] it's for
[2:21:49] you if you
[2:21:52] don't after hearing that the church is
[2:21:56] and
[2:21:57] you it means the word is not for
[2:22:00] you because in every group three kinds
[2:22:03] of
[2:22:05] Believers that is why I'm advising you
[2:22:09] don't look at your
[2:22:10] neighbor don't look at the pastor don't
[2:22:13] look at the
[2:22:15] deacons our holy
[2:22:18] example the word anointed
[2:22:25] word to live like
[2:22:28] Jesus not to live like
[2:22:34] f the time left it's
[2:22:39] numbered you have we have to overcome
[2:22:41] The Last
[2:22:42] Enemy and the faith is our
[2:22:46] victory
[2:22:48] we have to stand firm in the Faith with
[2:22:50] in everything that God has
[2:22:53] say God wants the faith not
[2:22:57] Mi you cannot mix ibrid your
[2:23:03] faith when you place your faith in the
[2:23:06] things that is not your
[2:23:07] word you're ibing your
[2:23:12] word it's going to be like a fig leaves
[2:23:15] for Eve you're going to cover
[2:23:19] yourself as long as the Lord when the
[2:23:22] Lord will appear it will dry out and
[2:23:25] will see how naked you
[2:23:27] are but the word comes this
[2:23:30] morning to help
[2:23:32] you to get ready before that

[2:23:56] resist
[2:23:57] here you create problems there at the
[2:24:00] river when you about to cross the J
[2:24:04] everything will be clear I always say to
[2:24:06] the people you see our
[2:24:08] eyes it will not help
[2:24:11] you you want to contemplate us it will
[2:24:14] not help

[2:24:25] buried
[2:24:28] people I preach in
[2:24:32] funerals i' like to see somebody when at
[2:24:35] the last
[2:24:37] minute I want to speak to somebody at
[2:24:39] his last
[2:24:42] minute I saw two people
[2:24:45] dying
[2:24:48] that one was was dying crying he told
[2:24:53] me you going to take care of your

[2:25:49] minute of your life will reveal who you
[2:25:52] are I can preach the way I'm preaching
[2:25:55] the last minut will reveal who I
[2:26:02] am maybe I will preach a good Ser but I
[2:26:07] remember but there will be one day with
[2:26:09] God am I going to face God that
[2:26:15] day with body that all lied watching
[2:26:20] me how am I going to face
[2:26:24] him a
[2:26:26] Christian it's the person that has a
[2:26:29] long range Vision he sees from Far
[2:26:32] because faith is a longrange vision he
[2:26:35] say from far by
[2:26:37] faith Abraham saw already
[2:26:41] Isaac before he was even born he saw
[2:26:45] Isaac
[2:26:50] but now the message
[2:26:53] came I want to
[2:26:55] say I'm not going to read it because I
[2:26:58] want to put everything
[2:27:00] together
[2:27:02] Moses in the time of Moses Paul said in
[2:27:06] First
[2:27:09] Corinthian Moses to deliver the
[2:27:13] vision to to give prophecy when God
[2:27:16] spoke
[2:27:19] he had to give prophecy to the people he
[2:27:21] had to Veil his
[2:27:23] face and Paul
[2:27:25] said that's a a temporary
[2:27:32] Glory but even
[2:27:35] now when they read
[2:27:38] Moses the veil is still upon the
[2:27:45] faces but the Veil
[2:27:48] lives when they go back to Christ
[2:27:55] amen if you don't go back to
[2:27:57] Christ you still have Veil on your
[2:28:01] face that's why they said we have Moses
[2:28:04] they say they have
[2:28:06] Moses but when the heart is converted to
[2:28:09] Christ the veil
[2:28:11] Liv now they can
[2:28:13] know Jehovah of the whole Testament
[2:28:16] Jesus in the Old Testament the New
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:21] Testament and they can identify thems to
[2:28:24] that
[2:28:26] Jesus we want to identify
[2:28:29] ourselves we
[2:28:31] dreamed and the dream that we had it was
[2:28:34] Malachi 4
[2:28:37] malach it was
[2:28:44] prophesied I will send you L the the
[2:28:47] prophet I will send you Elijah the
[2:28:51] prophet it was a
[2:28:53] dream said all them
[2:28:57] people they were praying for this to
[2:29:02] happen now when it
[2:29:05] happened they tried to look at
[2:29:07] it God sent the
[2:29:09] vision Revelation chap
[2:29:14] 10 to give the explanation of
[2:29:17] Mali but they turned their
[2:29:21] back for job was the same thing there
[2:29:24] was no
[2:29:26] man that God loved as
[2:29:31] job the devil went to see
[2:29:34] God God told him did you see my servant
[2:29:39] there it's because you gave him so much
[2:29:42] good God knows our
[2:29:45] hearts
[2:29:47] he say go touch him he will not deny
[2:29:51] me the devil
[2:29:54] came he destroyed everything around
[2:29:58] job he started even touching his own
[2:30:02] body
[2:30:04] but knew there was a god there in
[2:30:09] heaven the
[2:30:11] devil I will make him deny
[2:30:15] you the prophet
[2:30:18] says when you pray to God you pray to
[2:30:21] the Holy
[2:30:23] Ghost it's because you believe that the
[2:30:25] holy ghost
[2:30:29] exist if you
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:32] believe as you believe the holy ghost
[2:30:34] [Music]
[2:30:36] exist the same thing the
[2:30:40] devil that's why we
[2:30:42] can devil this body because we know know

[2:30:54] that he hear he hear

[2:31:23] speaking through
[2:31:26] you be mindful of what you speak because
