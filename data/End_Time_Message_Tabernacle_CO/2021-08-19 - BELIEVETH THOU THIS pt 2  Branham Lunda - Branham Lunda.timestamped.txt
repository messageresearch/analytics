[56:42] purge
[57:22] when you say the name of jesus
[57:38] notice
[57:51] in front of elizabeth
[58:00] and the bible said john the body was
[58:01] filled with the holy spirit
[58:03] and bible says
[58:05] not the jesuits
[58:24] she was just a woman ella now she was
[58:27] she was not an angel any person coming
[58:29] towards them she was a poor uh sinner
[58:31] like you and me
[58:33] but she was a believer
[58:47] the name of jesus christ it will give
[58:50] the same effects
[58:52] i remember another testimony
[58:58] there's just like a
[59:00] a prayer meeting
[59:07] you know how people pray in the name of
[59:10] jesus in the name of jesus
[59:12] and when they were praying for montreal
[59:14] just to show you
[59:17] in the the senior jesus christ
[59:19] it's a powerful name it may not descend
[59:22] in the name of jesus christ
[59:24] it's a marvelous name amen
[59:28] they pronounce that name
[59:44] that's why the
[1:00:12] of heaven and earth elohim elohim
[1:00:16] it's jesus christ himself
[1:00:18] i come back the devil fought this
[1:00:20] doctrine
[1:00:22] and
[1:00:23] all along the ages
[1:00:25] of the devil for this
[1:00:38] father son and holy
[1:01:07] the human name of celeste
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:50] the name of jesus will never be changed
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:53] brother don't personically experience
[1:01:56] jesus every person that experienced the
[1:01:58] name of jesus christ
[1:02:00] that's a cycle of productivity
[1:02:03] it has fear while pronouncing
[1:02:34] even in the message
[1:02:41] or this is the older uh covenant
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:03:01] did you learn the name of god say

[1:04:36] not the only name selling no
[1:04:47] another worshiper
