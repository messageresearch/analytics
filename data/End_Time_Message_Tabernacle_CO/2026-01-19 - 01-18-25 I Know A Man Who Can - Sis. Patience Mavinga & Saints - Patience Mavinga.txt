God bless you. [music] I can take the heart that broken. Make it over again. [singing] But I know [singing] a man [music] who can [singing] I can take a sim [singing] make [music] it all white and snow. [singing] But I know [singing and music] a man who can. [music] Some call him savior, the redeemer of men. But I call [singing] him Jesus for he [music] is my [singing] dearest friend. [music] And when [singing] you feel no one can help you and your life is out of hand. [singing] [music] But I know [singing] a man who cares. I can take [music and singing] walk upon the water. I can't make [singing] a walk again. But I know a man [singing] who can when I can't walk upon the water. I can come this raging sea. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; But I know a man who [singing and music] came. Some call him [singing] savior, [music] the redeemer of men.
