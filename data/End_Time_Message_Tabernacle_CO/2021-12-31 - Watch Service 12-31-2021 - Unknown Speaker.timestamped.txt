[1:32:50] it's good enough
[1:32:52] so we are going to
[1:32:54] read the scripture for the baptism
[1:32:59] uh i'm going to take ephesians chapter
[1:33:02] four
[1:33:04] pancreatic faith
[1:33:14] from verse 4
[1:33:16] about university card
[1:33:20] um
[1:33:22] baptism is one of the key things to go
[1:33:26] to heaven
[1:33:34] um
[1:33:36] should not be done by your influence
[1:33:39] it's a lonely paper etc
[1:33:42] influence
[1:33:43] but by conviction
[1:33:47] and
[1:33:48] if for some reason you have been
[1:33:52] baptized the simple certain reason
[1:33:56] and then you look at your work
[1:34:01] and you feel like no
[1:34:03] something did not
[1:34:05] work the way it should ever been
[1:34:11] you can be re-baptized
[1:34:15] and uh sister julian willa sergilian
[1:34:19] she received the message i believe in
[1:34:22] 1977.
[1:34:25] elaborate message on his nephew said
[1:34:28] when she was baptized for the first time
[1:34:30] kindly but is a polar premiere for
[1:34:33] and i did not believe at that time
[1:34:39] after a while they apparently
[1:34:42] she decided to be re-baptized to
[1:34:46] start a closed walk with god in 2022.
[1:34:58] this is to say brother sister if you
[1:35:01] question somewhere your baptism
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:08] don't look at anyone regard a person a
[1:35:11] person just make sure that
[1:35:14] you and god may revoke
[1:35:17] you
[1:35:19] to be very very convinced with a
[1:35:22] treatment on vancouver because the going
[1:35:24] away of the bride is very close
[1:35:30] you know i told you last
[1:35:33] sunday
[1:35:34] of the day

[1:36:37] if i can just show the numbers on the
[1:36:39] board
[1:36:43] ephesians start at 53.
[1:36:48] and at 170. afternoon

[1:38:12] 52 53 to 170 which
[1:38:27] 2022 um david the midfielder we'll have
[1:38:30] 116 vapor totalization
[1:38:35] as we said
[1:38:37] where are we at
[1:38:41] this is the time to make everything you
[1:38:45] have to write
[1:38:46] celebrand
[1:38:49] shows if for some reason you have been a
[1:38:51] negligent somewhere simple certain
[1:38:53] results
[1:38:57] you have to think twice would ever pass
[1:38:59] you therefore you have not been baptized
[1:39:01] navigate but easy we have a water you
[1:39:04] have the law there will be no excuse in
[1:39:06] your apartheid excuse if your baptism
[1:39:09] was not really really sure see what
[1:39:11] happened the performance issue we you
[1:39:14] can make it
[1:39:16] right
[1:39:18] now
[1:39:18] ephesian ephesians chapter 4 verse 4.
[1:39:23] the bible said
[1:39:25] there is one body yeah instead called
[1:39:28] and one spirit yes
[1:39:30] even as ye are called in one hope of
[1:39:33] your calling
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:53] there is only one baptism
[1:39:56] fairness about them which is correct
[1:39:59] here correct
[1:40:00] you can have hundred thousand of
[1:40:03] baptisms
[1:40:06] the butter
[1:40:09] i see
[1:40:10] i don't want to be critical
[1:40:12] if you buy it at all critic i've seen
[1:40:15] people even baptizing others
[1:40:29] but baptism is a symbol mainly by
[1:40:32] themselves
[1:40:34] of dying they love more
[1:40:37] buried philosophically small and
[1:40:40] resurrection in the resurrection have
[1:40:42] you seen somebody dying like this
[1:40:46] come see
[1:40:47] i don't know
[1:40:48] so what i'm saying is
[1:40:51] jda there are so many forms of baptism
[1:40:54] yeah they formed about them the catholic
[1:40:57] they have their baptism the catholic
[1:40:59] protestant they have the baptisms
[1:41:04] but
[1:41:05] if those baptisms are correct you may
[1:41:08] see see but some correct then ours is
[1:41:11] wrong and loudly not if a foe if ours is
[1:41:15] right
[1:41:15] not foreign
[1:41:30] make sure that your baptism is correct
[1:41:33] as you revoke your vote
[1:41:35] correct and to take the baptism
[1:41:38] at them it means you have to make your
[1:41:40] confession as paul
[1:41:42] as
[1:41:44] peter said in act chapter 2.
[1:41:51] don't go to the gate nearly
[1:41:55] and then they tell you no your baptism
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:03] just be sure that
[1:42:06] whatever cost let me get in the water
[1:42:12] and we cannot
[1:42:16] was telling me pastor we were coming
[1:42:18] quickly i forgot my clothes
[1:42:24] no we were coming to church last
[1:42:35] there is no way go get something
[1:42:37] somewhere and then uh just to put it on
[1:42:53] so
[1:42:53] baptism about
[1:42:56] is
[1:42:57] something very critical the second
[1:42:59] question is that critique jesus said
[1:43:03] go preach the word allah those who will
[1:43:06] believe
[1:43:23] just the key is on the faith but la clay
[1:43:27] says
[1:43:28] four because that's the bible
[1:43:30] one lord a celtic one faith in that lord
[1:43:34] himself fourth ancestor and one
[1:43:37] baptism he answered them
[1:43:39] that's the key
[1:43:42] therefore you cannot baptize people in
[1:43:45] three lords
[1:43:51] one lord ancestor
[1:43:54] remember
[1:43:55] one faith in cell four and faith cometh
[1:43:59] by the hearing of the word
[1:44:03] which word did you hear to know that
[1:44:05] there is one word and one baptism
[1:44:09] one i want you to go slowly what which
[1:44:12] kind of word did you hear
[1:44:16] to have faith
[1:44:18] in
[1:44:24] brother sister
[1:44:25] sir if
[1:44:27] you receive this this this this it's not
[1:44:30] sure if it was a very successful let's
[1:44:32] pass you just dump it
[1:44:35] seller and get to the water
[1:44:38] because the baptism asking you about
[1:44:40] them is belief say la croix
[1:44:45] let me read you this quote here in the
[1:44:47] message expectations
[1:44:53] uh
[1:44:54] expectative
[1:44:55] program 14
[1:44:59] the fact that you don't believe you are
[1:45:02] living in sin the
[1:45:04] left even
[1:45:09] now here it is get it
[1:45:12] um
[1:45:13] you see
[1:45:14] uh
[1:45:27] he that believeth not is condemned
[1:45:30] already
[1:45:35] because you're still
[1:45:37] passing
[1:45:39] like smoke drink commit adultery because
[1:45:42] have a female
[1:45:48] that's the attribute of sin success
[1:45:52] attribute you perceive you do that
[1:45:54] because you don't believe
[1:46:14] the rest
[1:46:15] the rest
[1:46:16] is attributes it's always attributed
[1:46:19] it's like jesus said

[2:03:12] and he said take it this is my body
[2:03:16] which is broken for you this do in
[2:03:19] remembrance of me yeah
[2:03:22] andrew grass
[2:03:25] says
[2:03:30] we have to remember
[2:03:32] the spain of the
[2:03:35] body of christ that day on calvary new
[2:03:38] zealand
[2:03:39] [Music]
[2:03:40] you
[2:03:43] after the same manner also he took the
[2:03:46] cup when he had suffered saying this cup
[2:03:50] is the new testament in my blood
[2:03:53] this d do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:03:57] remembrance of me
[2:03:59] the meme is
[2:04:13] you see even the scripture said
[2:04:16] do it as often as
[2:04:21] faith
[2:04:22] totally four
[2:04:24] it's not we have to take communion only
[2:04:27] once a year we send it back in the
[2:04:29] pandora community
[2:04:31] and i believe by god's grace we will try
[2:04:34] this year 2022 as we are raising the
[2:04:37] objective
[2:04:43] uh
[2:04:45] to have as many communion services
[2:04:51] some wednesday night you will come and
[2:04:52] find the table already
[2:04:55] in suarez
[2:04:58] and we want to get closer and closer to
[2:05:00] god
[2:05:02] please prepare you next verse
[2:05:07] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:05:10] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[2:05:13] death till he comes
[2:05:18] up
[2:05:24] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:05:27] and drink this cup of the lord and
[2:05:30] woefully shall be guilty of the body and
[2:05:34] blood of the lord
[2:05:44] but you don't want to take it unworthy
[2:05:49] you have to check yourself with a very
[2:05:52] very fearful meme because you know your
[2:05:54] own work musculus i've evolved
[2:05:57] we've unconfessed the scene you are
[2:06:00] taking a condemnation condensation avec
[2:06:01] de patient unconfessed
[2:06:04] incondonation and it is as consequences
[2:06:07] of even death and sickness
[2:06:13] and paul continue but let a man examine
[2:06:16] himself and so let him eat off that
[2:06:20] bread and drink of that cup upon
[2:06:22] continuity
[2:06:26] i can see
[2:06:28] japan
[2:06:31] for he that eateth and the drinkers
[2:06:34] unworthy eaters and the drinkers
[2:06:37] damnation to himself
[2:06:39] not discerning the lord's body garcia
[2:06:42] wikimanship
[2:06:52] many are weak and sickly among you and
[2:06:56] many
[2:07:07] so this is very important also for the
[2:07:10] church asia present potential eglise we
[2:07:13] cannot play with communion from pacific
[2:07:15] la comignon if you look at the message
[2:07:18] of respect silver gado message le
[2:07:21] respect there were some young people
[2:07:23] javes attention
[2:07:30] they came to church they saw they
[2:07:32] started playing i got to do this do this
[2:07:36] video
[2:07:41] one was dead and the two were in an
[2:07:43] insane institution
[2:07:48] institution
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:55] you cannot play with communion
[2:07:59] that's the cause sometimes people can
[2:08:01] have sicknesses and trouble in their
[2:08:03] life they look they dig where is this
[2:08:06] coming from may be coming from communion
[2:08:10] is on the problem
[2:08:21] for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:08:24] should not be judged
[2:08:32] but when
[2:08:34] we are judged we are trusting of the
[2:08:37] lord that we should not be condemned
[2:08:40] with the world
[2:08:46] park underneath
[2:08:50] wherefore my brother
[2:08:51] when he come together to eat terry one
[2:08:54] for another.
[2:09:01] you have to be in agreement with the
[2:09:03] veterans

[2:45:29] from verse 1 to verse 16. you may
[2:45:32] remain you can remain seated
[2:45:41] this is a practical lesson that jesus
[2:45:44] gave to the disciples said in lesson
[2:45:46] particularly
[2:45:49] he washed everyone's feet
[2:45:54] and he said you also do it versus
[2:45:59] in the time of the bible
[2:46:01] de la billa they did not have nice shoes
[2:46:04] you have a padded judicious here they
[2:46:06] went everywhere with a dirty feet
[2:46:12] and then they tell you to wash
[2:46:14] somebody's feet
[2:46:18] and when you wash your brothers your
[2:46:20] sister's feet
[2:46:22] less
[2:46:38] private now before the feast of the
[2:46:40] passover when jesus knew that his hour
[2:46:43] was come that he should depart out of
[2:46:46] this world unto the father having loved
[2:46:49] his own which were in the world he loved
[2:46:53] them until the end
[2:47:08] and uh
[2:47:10] supper being ended
[2:47:12] the devil having known
[2:47:15] having now put
[2:47:16] into the heart of judah is carrying out
[2:47:19] simon's son to betray him
[2:47:30] delilah
[2:47:33] [Music]
[2:47:34] jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:47:37] all thing into his hand and that he was
[2:47:40] come from god and went to god
[2:47:42] jesus
[2:47:55] and laid aside his garment and
[2:47:58] took a towel and girded himself
[2:48:11] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:48:15] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:48:18] to wipe them with the towel where with
[2:48:21] he was girded we invest the law daniel
[2:48:24] bassen a semi a la velez
[2:48:28] this
[2:48:33] then comments to
[2:48:35] come as he to simon peter and peter said
[2:48:38] unto him lord
[2:48:40] do thou wash my feet
[2:48:42] in viendo
[2:48:49] jesus answered and said unto him what i
[2:48:52] do thou knowest no not now but thou
[2:48:56] shalt know
[2:49:05] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[2:49:08] wash my feet
[2:49:09] jesus answered him if i watch thee not
[2:49:13] thou has no part with me
[2:49:20] jesus
[2:49:24] the power of ecmo
[2:49:26] simon peter said unto him lord not my
[2:49:29] feet only but also my hand and my head
[2:49:33] simon pierre
[2:49:36] selma
[2:49:38] and
[2:49:41] jesus said to him he that is washed
[2:49:44] needed not safe to wash his feet but
[2:49:47] he's clean every week and ye are clean
[2:49:51] but
[2:49:52] not all
[2:50:07] knew who should betray him therefore
[2:50:10] said he ye are not all clean
[2:50:20] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:50:23] had taken his garment and
[2:50:26] was set down again he said unto them
[2:50:30] know ye what i have done unto you
[2:50:34] can't dunk
[2:50:44] you call me master and lord and he say
[2:50:47] well for so i
[2:50:56] if i then your lord and master
[2:50:59] have washed your feet
[2:51:01] ye also ought to wash one another's feet
[2:51:15] for
[2:51:16] i have given you an example
[2:51:19] that ye should do as i have done unto
[2:51:22] you
[2:51:24] an example
[2:51:30] of very very i say unto you
[2:51:34] the servant is not greater than his lord
[2:51:38] neither he that is sent greater than he
[2:51:42] that sent him i'm verified
[2:51:51] amen amen so this is a perfect example
[2:51:56] of jesus teaching his
[2:51:59] humility
[2:52:01] an example of perfectionism
[2:52:05] humility as you watch one another's feet
[2:52:09] [Music]
[2:52:11] this is to value your brother your
[2:52:13] sister sasebo accorded
[2:52:18] as you humble yourself i can't vote for
[2:52:22] the medieval man so we will wash our
[2:52:25] feet after the prayer
[2:52:30] so it's ten minutes before
[2:52:34] the year change

[4:02:26] respected
[4:02:28] i hope everybody has his bible
[4:02:32] let's read
[4:02:34] the word which came unto jeremiah from
[4:02:36] the lord in the days of joe kim the son
[4:02:40] of josiah the king of judah saying
[4:02:43] go on to the house of harakabad and
[4:02:46] speak unto them
[4:02:48] bring them in the house of the lord into
[4:02:50] the chambers and give them wine to drink
[4:02:54] then i took
[4:02:55] jasanya the son of jeremiah the son of
[4:02:58] ab bazimna and his brethren and all his
[4:03:01] sons
[4:03:02] and the whole house of jerichobi and i
[4:03:05] brought them into the house of the lord
[4:03:07] into the chambers of the sons of anand
[4:03:09] the son of igad idablya a man of god
[4:03:13] which was by the chamber of the princes
[4:03:16] which was above the chamber of messiah
[4:03:19] the son of jesus the kip of the daw
[4:03:22] and i said before the sons of the sons
[4:03:25] of the house of the recovered pots full
[4:03:27] of wine and cups and i say unto them
[4:03:30] drinky wine
[4:03:32] but they say we will drink no wine for
[4:03:34] jonadab the son of rakab our father
[4:03:38] commanded us saying you shall know wine
[4:03:41] you shall not drink wine
[4:03:43] neither ye nor your son forever
[4:03:46] neither shall he build houses
[4:03:49] no soul seed no plant vineyard
[4:03:52] no heavy have any but all your days you
[4:03:56] shall draw on tents
[4:03:58] he may live many days in the land where
[4:04:01] he be strangers
[4:04:03] does have
[4:04:05] thus have we obeyed the voice of jonah
[4:04:07] that the son of rakab our father in all
[4:04:09] that he has charged us to drink no wine
[4:04:13] all our days
[4:04:15] we our wives our sons not our daughters
[4:04:20] now to build houses for us to dwell in
[4:04:23] neither have we vineyard no field no
[4:04:26] seed
[4:04:27] but we have to dwell in tents and have
[4:04:30] obey and done according
[4:04:32] to all that jonadab our father commanded
[4:04:35] us
[4:04:35] but it came to pass when nebuchadnezzar
[4:04:38] the king of babylon came up into the
[4:04:40] land and we said come and let us go to
[4:04:43] jerusalem for the fear of the army of
[4:04:46] kalden and the fear of the harmony of
[4:04:48] sinning
[4:04:49] so we will draw in jerusalem
[4:04:54] then came the word of the law unto
[4:04:56] jeremiah saying
[4:04:57] that says the lord of hosts the god of
[4:05:00] israel
[4:05:01] go and tell the men of judah and the
[4:05:03] inhabitant of jerusalem
[4:05:05] will they now receive instruction to
[4:05:07] earthen the my to my words says the lord
[4:05:10] the word of jonah the son of rakab that
[4:05:13] he commanded his son not to drink wine
[4:05:15] are performed for unto this day they
[4:05:19] drink none but obey the father's
[4:05:21] commandment

[4:06:01] the fathers
[4:06:03] which he commanded them but these people
[4:06:06] has not hurricaned my hearken unto me

[4:06:19] the inhabitant of jerusalem all the evil
[4:06:21] that has pronounced against them because
[4:06:24] i spoken unto them but they have not
[4:06:26] heard have called answer them but they
[4:06:28] have not answered

[4:06:33] recobyte that said the lord of hosts the
[4:06:36] god of israel because you have obeyed
[4:06:39] the commandment of jonah dubbed your
[4:06:41] father and kept all his precept and done
[4:06:43] accordingly
[4:06:44] unto all that he has commanded you
[4:06:47] therefore that said the law of host
[4:06:50] the god of israel jonathan the son of
[4:06:53] recap shall not want a man not stand
[4:06:56] before me forever
