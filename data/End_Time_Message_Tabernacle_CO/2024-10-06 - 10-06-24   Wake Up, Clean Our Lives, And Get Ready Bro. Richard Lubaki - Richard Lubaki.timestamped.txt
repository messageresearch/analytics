[1:22:13] little
[1:22:14] children that he should put his hand on
[1:22:18] them and pray and the disciples rebuke
[1:22:23] them
[1:22:32] but Jesus said suffer little children
[1:22:36] and forgive them not to come unto me for
[1:22:42] of such is the kingdom of
[1:22:52] heaven and he lay his hand on them and
[1:23:02] departed

[1:31:46] amen amen
[1:31:49] amen so as we still sitting let turn
[1:31:53] again
[1:31:55] our Bible in Luke
[1:32:06] Luke we're going to read in Luke chapter
[1:32:13] 17 from
[1:32:15] verse 26
[1:32:22] to wow
[1:32:25] the time is
[1:32:28] flying and as it was in the days of Noah
[1:32:34] so shall it be also in the days of the
[1:32:37] son of
[1:32:43] man they did eat they drank they married
[1:32:49] wives they were given in marriage until
[1:32:53] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[1:32:57] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:33:10] all likewise also as it was in the days
[1:33:14] of lot they did itat they drank they
[1:33:19] bought they sold they planted they build
[1:33:23] it
[1:33:34] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:33:37] Sodom it rained fire and Brin Stone from
[1:33:42] heaven and destroyed them all
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:55] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:33:59] the son of man is
[1:34:06] revealed amen amen amen amen so we may
[1:34:13] say because if even in the
[1:34:16] churches people read this but they don't
[1:34:21] understand what as we do understand
[1:34:25] but when you read you said they were
[1:34:28] eating they were marrying they were
[1:34:31] giving their children to
[1:34:33] marriage what is wrong with
[1:34:37] that there is nothing wrong with that
[1:34:40] because even us we doing the
[1:34:43] same but there was something and there
[1:34:47] is something which is the main thing
[1:34:51] that them they neglect
[1:34:54] that it was the presence of
[1:34:58] Noah amen with a
[1:35:01] message here
[1:35:04] is come here enter
[1:35:07] in because the
[1:35:11] rain fall and you going to
[1:35:16] perish amen amen that's the
[1:35:21] details and today
[1:35:24] as the Bible says it's going to be the
[1:35:27] same
[1:35:28] thing if the same thing if we are eating
[1:35:33] if we are drinking if we are marrying if
[1:35:37] we giving our children to marriage if
[1:35:40] that has to be the same
[1:35:43] thing it means Noah has to be also
[1:35:48] somewhere warning people for the to come
[1:35:57] are you there
[1:35:58] church are you there because eating is
[1:36:01] not
[1:36:02] bad marrying is not bad giving our
[1:36:06] children to marriage is not
[1:36:09] bad amen but one details
[1:36:16] is they
[1:36:18] miss to see the message
[1:36:23] amen yes sir which was supposed to
[1:36:26] prepare
[1:36:27] them to give them the Hiding
[1:36:33] Place against
[1:36:36] the and today we have Noah in the
[1:36:41] camp amen if it has to be the
[1:36:45] same Noah has to be in the
[1:36:50] camp but remember that side
[1:36:54] that
[1:36:55] side that side in that time it was about
[1:36:59] the water it was about the rain but now
[1:37:05] it's about the
[1:37:06] fire we are not getting in the
[1:37:10] AR but we are going
[1:37:14] up in the Rapture right so we have a
[1:37:20] Noah who Noah yeah the Noah of the
[1:37:25] age is brother Bram William Mar
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:31] Bram is's not around the message is
[1:37:36] there because the angel told you I'm
[1:37:40] sending you with the
[1:37:43] message the message of
[1:37:48] preparation Amen brother amen amen
[1:37:51] sister amen sir so as you eat
[1:37:54] as you drinking as you marry as you
[1:37:58] giving your children to
[1:38:00] marriage you have also to give your ears

[1:54:23] good we need them money I am the first
[1:54:27] one I need it amen but

[1:54:58] blessing is eternal life reason why we
[1:55:02] are sitting here
[1:55:05] today get our hypocrisy
[1:55:09] outside let us face the
[1:55:12] reality where am I standing at with this
[1:55:19] message amen amen
[1:55:22] and you
[1:55:24] parent remember Noah had entered with
[1:55:29] his
[1:55:32] family Amen brother
[1:55:37] amen amen
[1:55:40] amen amen
[1:55:44] amen I I remember the Pastor said the
[1:55:47] other
[1:55:49] time I'm I'm I'm trying to get in my
[1:55:53] subject I'm trying my way to get
[1:55:57] in the Pastor said last time that uh if
[1:56:03] you can call it what the thing that we
[1:56:06] used to to bze people I don't
[1:56:09] know he said he said that has to stay
[1:56:14] there we kept that
[1:56:18] here no one came in
[1:56:22] you see now we remove it it's not no
[1:56:26] longer but it's still
[1:56:29] somewhere why are you
[1:56:32] waiting why are you
[1:56:36] waiting
[1:56:38] look to be baptized in
[1:56:42] water that the first step of
[1:56:46] Salvation
[1:56:49] justification amen amen if
[1:56:54] you didn't decide yourself since
[1:56:58] then you never start Christian
[1:57:02] Journey so what we are talking about
[1:57:05] here it doesn't even concern
[1:57:10] you because you know the
[1:57:13] truth but you don't want to do it so you
[1:57:16] are closing the door to yourself

[1:57:46] people come to consult
[1:57:53] here we have the
[1:57:56] truth which can change your
[1:58:04] life that the very same
[1:58:08] thing the message that you are
[1:58:12] hearing and if you are so
[1:58:15] serious you know
[1:58:17] yourself that these people are different
[1:58:23] this message is
[1:58:25] different I've been in
[1:58:28] churches but the way they present the
[1:58:32] word the order in the church the way
[1:58:36] people wear clo the way they
[1:58:39] behave it's
[1:58:42] different so why can't you take your
[1:58:47] decision we will be more than happy to

[2:28:20] God has to create a
[2:28:22] body and he has entered
[2:28:26] in amen and the god this is how you
[2:28:30] understand the Bible what happened the
[2:28:33] time of Lord because some people read
[2:28:36] what happened the time of
[2:28:39] Lord and you stop by

[3:12:20] again in the name of Jesus
[3:12:27] Christ where was it

[3:13:03] Moses the Bible says
[3:13:06] people they they believed Moses and they

[3:13:59] be born Emmanuel the Son of God but they
[3:14:05] never they never say Jesus

[3:14:18] because Jesus was there
[3:14:21] already do you want us to write another
[3:14:25] Bible no

[3:14:31] that Jesus has done in our
[3:14:35] time the B could be
[3:14:39] written are you there
[3:14:42] church don't blame
[3:14:45] us it our
[3:14:48] you talk about the man you talk
[3:14:51] about why why because the children of
[3:14:54] the LA children of
[3:14:56] isra when they were mming against Moses
[3:15:00] they said why only God has to talk to
[3:15:04] you why God has to talk
[3:15:08] to he's a prophet
[3:15:11] Propet 37 that's your Bible
[3:15:17] they said to Moses we want God to speak
[3:15:19] to to
[3:15:22] ourselves we don't want somebody in
[3:15:25] between we don't want a man Moses you
[3:15:29] are a man we want God himself to talk to
[3:15:34] us Moses went to God he said your people
[3:15:38] they want you to talk to
[3:15:40] them God said they said the right thing
[3:15:44] God tell them to sanctify them

[3:15:51] woman wash their
[3:15:53] clothes and they come then the people
[3:15:57] were happy we going to see God then when
[3:16:00] the third day
[3:16:01] come when they were there God came down
[3:16:06] he was
[3:16:07] speaking when God speak it was
[3:16:11] standers
[3:16:13] Bo Bo behind the boo
[3:16:17] it was I am the Lord but only
