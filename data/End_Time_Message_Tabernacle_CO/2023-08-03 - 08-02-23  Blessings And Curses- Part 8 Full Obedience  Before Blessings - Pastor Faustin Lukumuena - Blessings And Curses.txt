was in religion chaos in religion and all these things that are taking place it's telling us father they're going home is ready we are the University foreign and we want to order bless us once again tonight our understanding that what all those blessings addiction becomes subject of our prayers go go all those places and The Interpreter as well come and speak to us in Jesus Christ maybe student foreign it's very complicated it's a very complicated it's a very long reading such in a 10 long literature 28 68 verses uh Society versa now you want me to read it in the church it's not possible so if you want really to be part of this civilian foreign because uh the way I look at this when I read it I stop in my head and I claim it and the more you do it the more this becomes here in reality you start learning everything for certain type of blessings but if you don't read you are not going to be blessed be because even as a member The Book of Revelation delivered apocalypse they said that those who are going to read this this is so how you will receive the blessing if you don't read it there is no way you will just anyway we left last Sunday okay talking about um generously and that's the thing we need to get rid of before we see the blessing falling upon us this I'm gonna insist on this even bothering system because I want each one of us to receive blessings you cannot receive a blessings with a bad heart no no Envy is not from God jealousy is not from God because I think I did not read it last Sunday question and answer on Hebrews part one question is asking foreign [Music] satisfree dailym [Music] OT was the son of Adam which was a Son of God where did that evil come from do he was a murderer he was jealous and now that the nature of his dad they're very smart in the beginning and he was in the beginning he was jealous of Michael okay and the King was the nature of his father which he was jealous [Music] [Music] those blessings become foreign [Music] also we spoke in the message Christ is the mystery of God to revealed the message I'm just reading a part of 86. you think he's a little bit wrong or it's the sister to pass don't let uh say Lord say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness start to think that just is a reality if your brother has something or your sister you see what Affairs and you are not fully happy and you feel like something is bothering you something you get the shows no that's that's that thing sashek is a sexual love foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] he was saying he was saying a little a little thing that doesn't have a name that is something okay shows the fatigue you can smell something get the shows ah it doesn't have a name if you have it you cannot Progressive you cannot win but when I come to the word of God I say that to think as a name I know friend just Rejoice for your brother and your sister if you cannot fully rejoice examine that thing and get rid of the blessings will be coming your way so this thing is a little bit uh recap of what we went through uh now we are going to move a little bit to the book of Deuteronomy I told you to read Deuteronomy chapter 28. uh four verses 1 to 68.50 on Twitter so let us stand as we read it economy 28. I'm just going to read the first two verses is the goodness of playing the music [Applause] the more you practice the more you become experts you know even Julia and Sheriff I saw them they did not know anything is uh when we started Gathering no music instrument you have a bad instrumental music we have to play there was a brother who came with the bank and that was it yeah and then you know you have to have always a vision I took them to a piano schools Sharon they started learning practices practical learning engine practice something never went to school for anything from the sister he learned the piano she moved to the drum he is the best of one of them and the Joe I don't even know when he started playing the keyboard George entertainment piano I believe hope also the policy up the only people they send the person who did not learn anything it's me and my wife but this need to say Japan when you are a young girl you have more attitude to learn because because you don't have a lot of things in your mind and that's why I said try to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you are still younger you see here they are worried about ten percentage when you become older we've married a problem the time become very very limited become religious so let us go to Deuteronomy 28 1. I'm gonna read the first two verses the first two verses and then I will take also verse 15. pay attention to this uh but you will notice before the Bible is that mentioning the bless the kind of blessings he gave a poor requisite recommendation this is the conditions to get the Blessed vaccines the Bible says and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt how can diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I commend thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth yes I like the French words and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt how can unto the voice of the Lord thy guide so this thing to say is over myself ascended but before you get to the blessings obey to the voice of thy Lord Now we move to Deuteronomy 28 to 15. but it shall come to pass if the will not how can unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his come treatments and his statutes which I commend thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee messages foreign [Music] this is the choice blessings and curses are a choice something short all these things are mentioned in the book Siri [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and the choice is given in the word of God don't you just say thank you I was thinking about this write the big word Hawkins is there anymore [Music] e a h okay e n and turn it to the people we see the book is saying if Thou Art because yes in fact they said but in English they say if the how can you see you'll be there is no kind of marker anymore give me the head the blackened yeah if you're Hawken I see to your baby if I cut it like this is here is a executive yeah in other words if you hear your blessing is coming from listening amen yes yes yes what you hear is what is going to determine blessings or curses [Music] this is in reality then you can obey all disobeyed Mexican I put there uh how can ease to listen there are many definitions and uh tonight this is why I'm gonna take as a subject full obedience before blessing I wanted to talk about the promised blessings I wanted to talk means but I look closely in the Bible before even talking about the blessing they are outlined in the Deuteronomy the the most related there was this condition he Advanced the condition if you hearkened so they say and then I start breaking down the word I look in the I did not put all the description but they said how can is to give here to uh on the years [Music] [Music] [Applause] make sense amen that's what they say to hear to how can is to be obedients on the knock at the door comes to listen who is it uh who it is [Music] Egypt so I think this word is very very important what is important let's go back to Deuteronomy chapter 28 verse so I'm just gonna stay a little bit on this word about obedience because the real blessings oh what is gonna determine the curse is the best on obedience now and it shall come to pass if thou shall how can diligently amen since nobody follow me please if Thou shalt Hawken diligently um if Thou shalt hearken diligently Seafood [Music] do they add to the voice of the Lord so the voice of the Lord is speaking to everyone's heart we have the written words man this will keep it this word is written into our hearts and every time you have to act foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] that's right are you with me I told you this is a change on the scary blessings and curses we have to break it in the business in order to follow then the remaining will be easy the Earth investigations it will stay in one year if you do this and centrifice you give to faces this is the blessing this is wonderful but the conditions to make your choice are you gonna Hawken foreign [Music] that the Lord God the Lord thy God will stay today on high amen Above All Nations is above all the nations Israel [Music] God is fighting foreign you know in the sum of the attack against Israel the September Israel they said the missiles they sent missions and they cannot hit the target because God is somehow is gonna deviate those peace all your equipment and that's what the Bible says spiritual Israel yes [Applause] all right [Applause] [Music] [Music] the Commandments in other words and the faith will come by healing the word if you want to receive a blessings eight verses of 28. foreign [Music] I don't listen to the message with my thoughts as well [Music] expectation what is this mean I want to understand it if you how can diligently damn no you will have the abilities to observe what the Commandment says oh [Music] amen above everything above all the nations see our nation our nation our message is either amen your God I don't know who you are serving but based on where I know I know equal to my God yeah your church [Music] [Applause] [Music] I will have 68 services foreign the only place they can open the Bible is when they come to church you can take the Bible sometimes I take this one you flash a passage and see sometimes you see me bringing this way I have four more sometimes I go to this one before I go to this world if you read brother Brown I'm saying according to a Traditions King James Sometimes you go to come and make a foreign murders no time to read no time to pray don't do nothing they knew they turn the the prayers so you are on High Above All Nations when you are Above All Nations wrong [Music] wrong foreign [Music] [Music] yes [Music] what I'm saying think about to Joseph um [Music] there is a change [Applause] [Music] speak up a little bit I don't know if they follow you why my business is it doesn't work the question is foreign amen amen Christians started with disobedience [Music] if ever rejected one word average doubted one word if F was unbeliever it is God is Not Gonna Change if you doubt one situ dude didn't said but all don't you expect blessings brother God has given us the opportunity foreign [Music] they tried foreign you think it's not important is important but in return they bless her they said they blessed us foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] what [Music] without winning not how can sit me and to the voice of the Lord thy God that means the voice of the Lord thy God is speaking deadly to your heart boys nothing can happen to anybody without making the choice [Music] when you give yourself consequences will follow my prediction that we will detail it is alone as we go through the book of Deuteronomy advances every time you do a good thing you obey the world the voice is speaking inside of your house every time you do that you are blessed foreign [Music] uh to do this in the first election I chose to do this this is no I don't need enough money tell me here who doesn't need the money okay you are pretending not to love it yeah foreign [Music] let's go back to which verses in 13. he said you will lend to people and you will not borrow it and the Lord shall make the kids and thou shall be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if thou foreign [Music] yes the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure determinate amen amen [Music] they happen to give the name unto thy land in his scissors without today there is no cups [Music] and to bless all the all the women yeah if only the CEO of King Super new this is are not going to cheat The Hours come late and punch in yeah Too Many Nations become your own bank blessing means we have to get out of poverty it's a curse [Applause] no no [Applause] [Applause] [Music] he was just pushing the Chariots outside [Applause] [Music] are yours I see people looking for blessings [Music] I'm not gonna eat but maybe you don't have already the required to wait and you are fasting too much again but in order to receive what you are fast enough is better than the sacrifice the sacrification believer [Music] you choose what you want to do to ask you as a secretary and compel yourself greatest blessings with a great level of obedience to obey like I'm not gonna smoke for many of us it's a prime problem but what I'm talking about [Music] obeyed obeisance to things that you are challenged to do the shows sacrification [Music] of uh what do they call it the fact of uh cow or something like let me find the verse in the Bible the same amount of energy this is verse 22 in verse 17. first Samuel 15 to 22. yeah listen to the Bible I understand your understanding as the Lord as great Delight in the burn offering and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord come a second behold was better than sacrifice that's one

my sacred to praise [Music] [Music] obedience is the best not the sacrifice that is sacrifice you know those are prophets they cut themselves into pieces he says yes there is nothing now again Paul Paul said again you can offer your body it will be Birds [Music] let me tell you the most important thing listens obedience not to a piece of words let's go to verse I've read this for many many
