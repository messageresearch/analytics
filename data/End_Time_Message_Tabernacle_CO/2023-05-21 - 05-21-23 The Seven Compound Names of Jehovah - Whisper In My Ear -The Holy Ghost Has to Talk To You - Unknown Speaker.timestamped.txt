[1:08:27] gone but Emmanuel will be gone we will
[1:08:30] have only brother Neville piano
[1:08:33] friends everywhere
[1:08:45] it will be the only interpreter
[1:08:49] unless God provide a miracle
[1:08:53] maybe brother Vincent
[1:08:58] oh
[1:08:59] it's okay
[1:09:00] if they say like that it's the way they
[1:09:04] say yeah we have always to double up
[1:09:07] certain places so that uh
[1:09:10] everything works the way it should be
[1:09:14] okay
[1:09:18] and also on the musician ah there will
[1:09:23] be also some Gap but I believe God
[1:09:33] but I think brother Jose ilunga will be
[1:09:35] already back by the end of the months
[1:09:41] he went to Congo to celebrate the birth
[1:09:45] of his uh first daughter
[1:09:49] celebrate yeah
[1:09:52] so you we will need a little bit of
[1:09:55] coordination
[1:10:00] so that everything works the way it's
[1:10:03] supposed to be okay yes
[1:10:08] and for those going to home and Israel
[1:10:12] in Israel
[1:10:14] I think everybody got his uh tag foreign
[1:10:25] but the key things is when you go there
[1:10:28] you may need to take some cash with you
[1:10:31] baby brother George always said about
[1:10:34] 500 for your little things to maybe to
[1:10:38] buy with a short specials
[1:10:50] yeah and uh also the power outlet
[1:11:01] in Europe is different from here
[1:11:08] so what you will use in home will be
[1:11:10] different from what you will use in
[1:11:13] Israel
[1:11:16] it will be better to look already maybe
[1:11:20] uh Amazon or whatever it is
[1:11:30] image
[1:11:44] also I think uh brother this time did
[1:11:46] this last time brother Emmanuel was out
[1:11:49] featherstonculla
[1:11:55] to take the offering and the money that
[1:11:58] will be given to go make the deposit to
[1:12:01] the bank the plan is
[1:12:06] amen amen
[1:12:09] and also this week was he said cement
[1:12:15] we will have the visit of a pastor
[1:12:17] Albert
[1:12:20] visit
[1:12:23] he has been here since uh
[1:12:27] the beginning of the month
[1:12:32] but uh to make him to come he has a lot
[1:12:36] of schedule he came for the graduation
[1:12:38] of his daughter eleven collection
[1:12:41] disaster
[1:12:45] we keep postponing so finally he will be
[1:12:49] here that willing on Tuesday
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:55] so I have asked him if he can allow uh
[1:13:00] to have services on Wednesday this
[1:13:03] Wednesday
[1:13:07] and we are going to add another day
[1:13:10] Friday
[1:13:13] and he will finish on Sunday in Buffalo
[1:13:17] the match it is a very very good
[1:13:19] preacher
[1:13:21] and we want to take benefit of it today
[1:13:25] Advantage he's the one who taught me to
[1:13:29] beat somebody in and out it is
[1:13:39] when I told him passage this to beat me
[1:13:43] to beat me in and out yeah so uh make
[1:13:48] sure that uh
[1:13:51] you support him
[1:13:55] blessings
[1:13:58] amen amen and uh I have a lot of
[1:14:02] announcements
[1:14:04] last last Wednesday
[1:14:06] it was a masterpiece from Bad uh
[1:14:20] so this morning it's a matter we are
[1:14:24] going to have a
[1:14:26] banaya
[1:14:27] dedication
[1:14:32] and before we do the dedication of this
[1:14:35] baby
[1:14:41] I want to give
[1:14:43] a little testimony
[1:14:48] that's the reason why I want to preach
[1:14:51] this morning
[1:14:54] on the seven compound names of Jehovah
[1:14:58] they are proposed they said no compose
[1:15:01] over
[1:15:06] I think in uh
[1:15:10] September last year
[1:15:16] I heard I think I told the church
[1:15:22] dream
[1:15:34] stay with me all night
[1:15:43] and I came to church
[1:15:46] it was the time I was preaching on the
[1:15:49] Plan of Redemption today
[1:15:52] Redemption but very often things happen
[1:15:56] we don't want to talk about it in detail
[1:15:59] before our conditions
[1:16:06] but it was so real
[1:16:10] to the extent I was wondering should I
[1:16:13] preach on the seven compound names or
[1:16:16] should I continue on this area on the
[1:16:18] series
[1:16:28] replanted Redemption
[1:16:32] the Seven Seals oh they said so
[1:16:36] so uh
[1:16:38] I believe whatever God does
[1:16:43] even in so simple
[1:16:48] always give him thanks
[1:16:51] testify and praise him
[1:17:00] these things started a while
[1:17:04] you know sometimes I observed people the
[1:17:08] first of the age of cellulation
[1:17:11] they had Julian Emmanuel they have a
[1:17:15] baby
[1:17:20] the baby grow up the baby are grandi and
[1:17:24] uh until one day I asked them
[1:17:27] ready Monday
[1:17:30] where is the next one
[1:17:32] um
[1:17:33] they say wow
[1:17:35] it's not coming it's only born in a
[1:17:38] vampire
[1:17:41] and I let them go
[1:17:44] and uh
[1:17:45] I started to
[1:17:47] prayer and you know there are prayers
[1:17:50] and prayers
[1:17:52] and
[1:17:53] it was the same time I was watching
[1:17:56] sister Gracia and the sister
[1:18:00] foreign
[1:18:23] pastor we have trouble to get the second
[1:18:26] one those have only two brothers it's a
[1:18:29] gun and found every time we conceive
[1:18:31] other conception at this time we are
[1:18:34] coming to you to pray for it
[1:18:38] but when you
[1:18:41] give a request like that um
[1:18:47] it's like you are putting the pastor on
[1:18:51] yeah
[1:18:52] I don't know how to qualify the
[1:18:54] positions
[1:19:00] it was really a huge burden
[1:19:04] Lord why this is
[1:19:07] now you have allowed them to come to me
[1:19:10] my name is
[1:19:14] so that this can go forward
[1:19:17] it was every day
[1:19:22] among many problems I have uh
[1:19:26] brother when
[1:19:31] it's not just for
[1:19:34] wasting of times
[1:19:38] we may be
[1:19:40] victim of a lot of distractions
[1:19:45] and stay away from destruction
[1:19:49] they are people with huge needs and
[1:19:53] problems you may not know yeah
[1:19:59] when somebody just give you a pastor
[1:20:02] pray for me for this
[1:20:05] I am in a big debt yes
[1:20:09] and you don't know how I cry to God
[1:20:12] because of the situations
[1:20:17] and then the
[1:20:19] thing went on
[1:20:22] and the day since the journey gave birth
[1:20:28] it was a relief
[1:20:33] and then I turn again to Julia and
[1:20:37] Emmanuel without talking to them at that
[1:20:39] time
[1:20:42] I was wondering
[1:20:46] if they could have a problem since
[1:20:51] the first child of the premium song but
[1:20:55] now maintenance if see it doesn't come
[1:20:59] she said not that they wanted
[1:21:02] but they want to have child and not
[1:21:06] confirm but nothing is coming
[1:21:09] and it became a burden it's a definition
[1:21:13] and remember in September
[1:21:17] it was the time my wife
[1:21:21] Emmanuel Julia they traveled to
[1:21:25] congoose
[1:21:29] and I was
[1:21:31] born with my mother-in-law
[1:21:36] and Sharon was always saying dad come
[1:21:39] eat my place
[1:21:43] very often I don't want to go to their
[1:21:45] places
[1:21:48] but one day she impressed me so much
[1:21:51] impression
[1:21:54] and like because they know that I like
[1:21:56] breakfast
[1:22:00] after pressure one of the Saturday
[1:22:06] Sunday I accepted and I went he accepted
[1:22:11] I remember it was September 2022.
[1:22:15] on the 17th City lady said
[1:22:19] went to the house we ate you know so she
[1:22:23] said
[1:22:24] and I asked them also what's going on
[1:22:30] we don't know
[1:22:34] there is no problem yeah okay problem
[1:22:37] and we finish
[1:22:40] I do remember about uh one o'clock one
[1:22:43] P.M
[1:22:46] they could not notice what happened in
[1:22:48] my heart
[1:22:52] I was almost crying
[1:22:55] I left the home coming straight to
[1:22:59] church
[1:23:01] I said Lord what is this
[1:23:04] I have so many problems in the church
[1:23:10] but you cannot realize
[1:23:13] bear with me a little bit um
[1:23:17] there is the little boy God sankai yeah
[1:23:21] his problem also is on my heart so
[1:23:25] problem extreme okay one day sure after
[1:23:30] church I pray the grace I see a little
[1:23:32] boy coming
[1:23:33] here pastor Pastor God is calling you
[1:23:37] God tape
[1:23:39] I went to the car this is a reason about
[1:23:41] you you know every other kids they play
[1:23:43] outside
[1:23:45] but God is locked in the car God great
[1:23:49] and foreign
[1:24:25] thinks that
[1:24:27] as I say bear with me
[1:24:30] something I don't want to even say it
[1:24:33] yeah
[1:24:34] but sometimes you pray
[1:24:37] you may see a black sheep
[1:24:41] on certain conditions
[1:24:44] and you try to understand what this kind
[1:24:47] of answer a lot they may not compound
[1:24:49] the question or the responses
[1:24:52] you have to speak because you are God
[1:24:56] of God always speaks
[1:25:01] if we are not connected this is where we
[1:25:04] don't get the answers
[1:25:12] that will talk to you
[1:25:16] and if God talked to you you don't pay
[1:25:19] attention to the attention it's your
[1:25:22] problem Brother Richard Bridge here I
[1:25:25] don't remember what word he was using uh
[1:25:30] you have to separate the man and the
[1:25:34] office something like that
[1:25:38] sometimes you get used to the person at
[1:25:40] the moment
[1:25:41] he can tell you something but he didn't
[1:25:44] show us you take it lightly it can be
[1:25:47] God giving you the answers
[1:25:50] that's why coming to church you have to
[1:25:53] be in a certain atmosphere atmosphere
[1:25:55] certain atmosphere to get into the
[1:25:58] dimension of God
[1:26:00] to hear what God is
[1:26:03] going back to the story
[1:26:06] I left Sharon's home
[1:26:09] to the church that was the night I came
[1:26:13] I came early around 2PM here uh
[1:26:20] until
[1:26:22] maybe five o'clock in the morning
[1:26:28] I was reading praying crying
[1:26:35] I say Lord
[1:26:37] why I have cases in the church here
[1:26:40] where people cannot give birth when they
[1:26:42] want to uh
[1:26:43] the problem is
[1:26:50] and you know the cases the problem was
[1:26:54] available
[1:26:57] and then around
[1:26:59] five o'clock in the morning mental I was
[1:27:02] on the secondary matter I was so tired
[1:27:05] and I said let me rest a little bit
[1:27:09] I think I slept for 45 minutes or an
[1:27:12] hour
[1:27:17] as a social
[1:27:19] and I believe it was God
[1:27:23] telling me medicine
[1:27:25] I am Jehovah Jara
[1:27:28] if I'm Jehovah I'm alsoever
[1:27:35] Shalom
[1:27:37] I see you are so worried
[1:27:45] but man I want to tell you
[1:27:48] the problem you are concerned about the
[1:27:51] problem
[1:27:56] and I have the seven compound names said
[1:28:01] to know
[1:28:02] composite is over
[1:28:04] we stay with me it was like a dream when
[1:28:07] I wake up it was like shaking
[1:28:10] comments
[1:28:12] take away and there are some other more
[1:28:15] details they tied the place and when I
[1:28:19] came to the platform that Sunday
[1:28:21] uh the platform City martial I started
[1:28:24] talking
[1:28:25] I did not want to tell it to the church
[1:28:29] but it was so pressing
[1:28:33] questions until I said something
[1:28:37] do you remember that
[1:28:42] for those who don't remember who
[1:28:44] selected
[1:28:45] since they hope if you can give that
[1:28:48] portion of the video
[1:28:56] yesterday I came a little bit early then
[1:28:58] usually yeah

[1:32:31] and
[1:32:32] when I was speaking to the church
[1:32:35] I did not know what is going to happen
[1:32:40] but man I want to tell you this you know
[1:32:43] sometimes when you are praying the
[1:32:46] followers God has already given a
[1:32:48] solution
[1:32:52] two or three days after I spoke to the
[1:32:55] church
[1:32:57] Julia called me from Congo uh
[1:33:02] Daddy I'm expecting
[1:33:05] for me it was it

[2:13:20] oh 46.
[2:13:23] Jehovah
[2:13:25] so in those seven names
[2:13:28] the first one the premiere is Jehovah
[2:13:33] and the last one is
[2:13:36] Jehovah
[2:13:38] now maintenance

[2:14:35] need to representative person amen and
[2:14:39] if you have a need this morning
[2:14:42] regardless
[2:14:43] whether your faith can produce it think
[2:14:49] about let me go to Abraham
[2:14:53] Abraham Abraham God started walking with
[2:14:56] Abraham
[2:14:58] since Genesis 12
[2:15:01] and if God has done all these things
[2:15:04] and the Genesis 18 19. God is human
[2:15:09] flesh
[2:15:11] Abraham saw all these things
[2:15:20] and the Bible says in Genesis 22. that
[2:15:25] was the final test of everything
[2:15:28] you may think foreign
[2:15:33] [Music]
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:04] and
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:13] and it came to pass after the things
[2:16:18] objectives
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:40] was for God to reveal to Abraham
[2:16:44] Abraham because in Genesis 17 he said he
[2:16:49] came to Abraham in many ways
[2:16:54] human flesh and God even reveal himself
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:16] [Music]
[2:17:23] [Music]
[2:18:01] you still don't see that
[2:18:06] [Music]
[2:18:10] a single life
[2:18:16] Samuel gospel sicknesses
[2:18:20] disease that the doctor said they cannot
[2:18:23] tell them
[2:18:25] just to show that there is a Jehovah
[2:18:29] who can handle all kind of disease
[2:18:34] amen amen even
[2:18:38] people
[2:18:39] memories
[2:18:42] God can handle that
[2:18:44] and guiding his way of doing things
[2:18:48] it's so complicated
[2:18:51] what scripture came in my mind
[2:18:54] John I believe John chapter 9 question
[2:18:59] there was a boy yeah
[2:19:10] and the people start questioning
[2:19:13] why he is
[2:19:21] and as Jesus passed by they call me the
[2:19:25] passage he saw a man which was blind
[2:19:29] from his birthday is
[2:19:34] and his disciples asked him saying
[2:19:38] master who did this thing this man or
[2:19:41] his parents that he was born blind
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:54] Jesus answered neither as this man
[2:19:58] sinned no he is the parent but that the
[2:20:02] words of God should be made manifest in
[2:20:06] him yes
[2:20:10] [Music]
[2:20:14] very often when we see a case
[2:20:20] calling the Jehovah name of redemptions
[2:20:25] we started looking for the victims
[2:20:30] we start looking for the one to blame
[2:20:34] if you take that road
[2:20:37] you are on the wrong path yes
[2:20:40] the disciples the discipline they ask
[2:20:43] Jesus
[2:20:45] is this man
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:58] is for the works of God
[2:21:01] God manifests
[2:21:02] [Music]
[2:21:05] for the attributes attribute of the
[2:21:09] seven Redemptive names
[2:21:15] because if he was not born blind
[2:21:20] they will not know that there is
[2:21:22] somebody who can open eyes
[2:21:26] yeah their condition that condition is
[2:21:30] to show us
[2:21:31] somebody
[2:21:33] who can solve it
[2:21:35] you can have kids
[2:21:40] because he wants glory and honor be
[2:21:44] given to him
[2:21:48] you did the same things
[2:21:52] and you did the same thing the baby
[2:21:55] doesn't come baby
[2:22:01] foreign

[2:24:05] look Beyond this way
[2:24:10] and deceive Jesus in the same fear of
[2:24:14] fire yeah the same as the seven compound
[2:24:18] names
[2:24:20] and you look at one of the names
[2:24:24] applicable to your situation
[2:24:26] you will work here happy Tuesday
[2:24:30] so that man was looking I said
[2:24:32] personally
