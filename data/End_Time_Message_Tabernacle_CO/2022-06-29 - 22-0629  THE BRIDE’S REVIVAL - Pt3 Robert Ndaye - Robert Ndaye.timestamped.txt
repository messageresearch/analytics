[59:06] with your life the way where you have
[59:09] hatred
[59:10] selfishness
[59:12] you don't want to see the the happiness
[59:14] of christ
[59:16] you are destroying
[59:25] [Music]

[1:22:21] i surrender
[1:22:22] amen

[1:23:04] the message
[1:23:30] the church
[1:24:00] you have a great baby in paris
[1:24:08] as she was playing uh going going home
[1:24:11] going home
[1:24:13] i was wondering
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:31] [Applause]
[1:24:40] there's no repentance no dry eyes
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:38] and she's lining up with the word of god
[1:25:40] and the prophet says
[1:25:42] if you live in a series of adoptions
[1:25:46] you have to line up
[1:25:48] one to another
[1:25:51] brothers and sisters
[1:26:20] i was invited
[1:26:32] he greeted the brother was on the side
[1:26:35] and then he came before me he just
[1:26:36] looked at me
[1:26:38] he jumped
[1:26:39] and then he went to school greetings the
[1:26:40] other people
[1:26:44] i checked myself i never had a problem
[1:26:46] with him
[1:26:48] secretary what kind of attitude is that
[1:26:53] prayer brother
[1:26:55] look what the prophet says
[1:26:58] if you cannot respect the man respect
[1:27:01] at least respect his office
[1:27:06] commander to speak people do it and
[1:27:08] others the holy ghost can lead the man
[1:27:10] divine so act like that before the man
[1:27:13] of god
[1:27:31] it forever but brother venom says before
[1:27:32] the restriction you got to respect that
[1:27:35] if the public is not there
[1:27:40] juventus
[1:27:42] you want to be the beast if the public
[1:27:44] was nothing
[1:27:58] beast because he's fulfilling the
[1:28:00] scripture
[1:28:03] even if he's the first one just respect
[1:28:05] himself
[1:28:06] because we know that we will be forced
[1:28:09] to also doing the work
[1:28:12] so that the word of god might be
[1:28:13] fulfilled if you cannot respect a man
[1:28:16] at least respect his office
[1:28:19] respect yourself
[1:28:20] respect to the servant of god commander
[1:28:22] said this without saying no
[1:28:24] why don't you just say the man
[1:28:40] you see we can the truth
[1:28:45] destroy everything we declare to be
[1:28:46] experienced
[1:28:48] start from scratch
[1:28:50] from the justification it's very
[1:28:51] important to find the truth or
[1:28:53] negatively i have to destroy your
[1:29:08] refuse that spirit and prove it to a
[1:29:09] member of the spirit and check your own
[1:29:11] spirit officially and refuse it
[1:29:14] and seek the genuine word
[1:29:16] and it's there you're going to have it
[1:29:19] amen amen amen the church
[1:29:23] all beloved brothers
[1:29:27] what could we say amen amen
[1:29:30] what could we say
[1:29:34] that is why the prophet said submission
[1:29:50] before anything
[1:30:32] there's no
[1:30:44] it can be in the man of god that is
[1:30:45] unfounded
[1:31:00] don't you look at the group
[1:31:02] god is speaking to you
[1:31:04] god once comes
[1:31:06] up
