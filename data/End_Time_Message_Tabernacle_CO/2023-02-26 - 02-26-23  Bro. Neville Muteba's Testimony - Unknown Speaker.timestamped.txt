[0:02] I have a little testimony
[0:04] uh sit down
[0:07] it was last Tuesday
[0:11] it was about midnight
[0:14] I was working at home
[0:19] we are president and after a certain
[0:22] time when apparently the internet we
[0:24] didn't have a connection internet
[0:28] I tried to check it up again
[0:32] I found out that we didn't have
[0:34] connection
[0:56] a message to tell us the internet will
[0:59] be restored in two hours
[1:11] you have to go back to the office to
[1:14] work
[1:23] and I said I will go to a friend who's
[1:26] closer to the our office
[1:29] is
[1:32] closer to the office
[1:42] and our office far from where he is that
[1:46] I decided to go by his place
[1:49] he said yes you can come
[1:53] I got in the car
[1:56] come on
[2:02] traffic light and then I said uh in this
[2:05] time I don't want to take a normal Road
[2:07] I have to take like a rapid Wood Road
[2:11] E470 I took you for 70.
[2:18] traffic and for them
[2:21] on that road there's not a lot of
[2:24] traffic around that time
[2:31] and I was going towards South uh toward
[2:34] Aurora
[2:37] um
[2:45] and then I was driving and I passed the
[2:48] exit of Pina Boulevard
[2:53] I noticed there was three vehicles
[2:58] that was also about to get inside they
[3:01] are into the highway a regional
[3:04] enormous difference
[3:09] usually according to the rules I had to
[3:12] leave the the extreme Lane to go to the
[3:15] middle one lovely still opportunity the
[3:18] address to the highway you leave them
[3:20] the the place to get inside the drive
[3:23] into the highway
[3:31] just about five seconds
[3:36] I saw just close uh just in front of me
[3:40] if he uh the filed what you're giving it
[3:43] as I saw the the the the light of the
[3:47] car coming toward me she'll remember and
[3:50] on the same Lane where I was
[3:55] police
[3:57] I wonder like that could be the the cups
[4:03] and then I said the police the cop could
[4:06] not drive like this on the opposite way
[4:15] 70 miles away seven miles yeah an hour
[4:19] yeah
[4:55] driving the opposite direction of people
[4:57] that going south
[4:59] foreign
[5:24] to see a car driving your opposite
[5:26] direction in the highway
[5:31] and then I saw death and God spared Our
[5:34] Lives
[5:44] God will provide ways to spare Our Lives
[5:49] [Music]
[5:51] I wanted to give my testimony
[5:55] because God is so great
[5:58] okay
[5:59] speaking I don't know how to explain
[6:02] it I can explain the words
[6:06] but the way things happened
[6:10] with you by the grace of God bless you
