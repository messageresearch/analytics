[1:34] [Music]
[1:49] [Music]
[1:55] [Music]
[2:11] your father had
[2:14] and it's been true the promised
[2:20] [Music]
[2:27] about me
[2:34] [Music]
[2:39] no more
[2:41] bigger than to bear
[2:45] no more sickness
[2:50] [Music]
[3:10] what it is
[3:15] [Music]
[3:22] [Music]
[3:34] when I lose
[3:39] [Music]
[4:07] back
[4:08] then easy to change your clothes or you
[4:10] are there to take pictures
[4:16] are you there for picture
[4:18] oh I will take your picture one day
[4:22] so let us take the scripture when all is
[4:25] a creature the creature
[4:27] in the book of Acts chapter 2 when all
[4:30] done delivered that chapter
[4:34] we read verse 37 and 38.
[4:39] [Music]
[4:40] now when they heard this they were
[4:44] picked in their heart and said unto
[4:47] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[4:49] men and the burden what shall we do this
[4:54] [Music]
[5:02] this is a call from the heart
[5:07] [Music]
[5:08] they have heard the word
[5:11] thank you
[5:13] when they heard the word
[5:16] about the preaching of the Gospel
[5:20] they were pricked in the heart
[5:25] you cannot be baptized if your heart is
[5:28] not touched
[5:31] and when your heart is
[5:41] [Music]
[5:43] maybe there are people sitting here
[5:46] if you have not baptized been baptized
[5:51] it's because your heart has not been
[5:54] depicted
[5:55] to shake because a Christian
[5:59] when you look at the grace God has
[6:02] brought to you
[6:05] it must touch the heart
[6:08] you may say oh I've been baptized many
[6:11] years ago
[6:13] where your heartbreaked
[6:25] you are fed
[6:27] is your heart touched
[6:30] if that's the case
[6:34] [Music]
[6:35] the scripture said
[6:37] they asked what shall we do and this is
[6:42] the answer
[6:45] then Peter said unto them repent
[6:47] [Music]
[6:56] [Music]
[7:12] [Music]
[7:30] maybe you pretended to be innocent
[7:35] but in the sight of God
[8:03] but everyone it's individual Affairs
[8:08] in the name of Jesus Christ
[8:11] for the remission of your sins
[8:14] because we came anywhere in this world
[8:19] in the way of sex
[8:23] which was by Nature sin
[8:27] and that's why we need the real
[8:30] Christian Baptist
[8:33] and brother has been sent as the prophet
[8:37] to store because
[8:43] from the time this happened the two
[8:47] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[8:49] Christ
[8:56] the Baptist was twisted
[8:59] and they start baptizing people in the
[9:02] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[9:04] ghosts
[9:17] Father Son and Holy Spirit
[9:20] it's not a name they are titles if you
[9:25] had been baptized in those titles
[9:28] it was wrong
[9:31] and then showed us the real baptism
[9:36] is by total immersion
[9:40] immersion total in the name of the Lord
[9:44] Jesus Christ
[9:46] not even in the name of Jesus Christ
[9:50] which Jesus Christ are you talking about
[9:53] I can change my name today
[9:57] I go to court
[9:59] and I say my first name is Jesus
[10:04] my last name is
[10:06] Christa and everybody can call me Jesus
[10:09] Christ
[10:10] but when you baptize in the Jesus Jesus
[10:13] Christ
[10:15] it's not me
[10:18] there is only one
[10:20] who is Jesus Christ
[10:23] who is the Lord
[10:25] and it's in those names
[10:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:33] is it what Pentecostal do is
[10:36] it what Jehovah Witnesses
[10:42] So based on this uh
[10:46] brother Moses and the sister Angela
[10:50] Angela they have heard the word of God
[10:53] and they want to be baptized and we
[10:57] spoke and they have made what they need
[11:00] to make right
[11:02] and now we are going to do the service
[11:08] amen amen
[11:10] who that has ears
[11:15] we are always remind those things
[11:19] and we believe that one day somebody is
[11:22] gonna hear
[11:23] [Music]
[11:25] who will be the first born among the
[11:28] twins
