[9:56] here anywhere so that we haven't forgot
[9:58] about you that we love you and we're
[10:00] just going to see how we're going to
[10:01] move forward with this school for those
[10:04] who are in my price
[10:07] subjects but we had talked about where
[10:09] possible Caesarea of joke and we're part
[10:11] of jokes testimony and how he was a
[10:13] presser meant and the kind of testimony
[10:15] that he had among the people and how old
[10:19] the Lord harbored ever saw his testimony
[10:23] and decided that he was going to go and
[10:25] arrest him and oh they're forbidden to
[10:27] go to that chair and was lost and how
[10:29] his friend came and tried to comfort him
[10:31] but there were miserable comforters
[10:32] obviously I said the live decided to let
[10:35] the child pass and he rewarded him with
[10:37] mother did not say he had and we had
[10:39] left us with the book of Judges we
[10:41] hadn't started talking about the dresses
[10:43] yet but maybe when we get back we'll
[10:46] start talking about that the best
[10:48] basically that we kept with those that
[10:49] were in my Sunday school choir sounds
[10:54] good Thank You Shalom and for those who
[10:57] are in my class you know since the
[10:58] beginning of the year we've been talking
[11:00] a lot about prayer and you know
[11:03] different stories and just to kind of
[11:05] talk about this you know we're going to
[11:07] this time of twenty nande everybody is
[11:09] at home we can't go to school we can't
[11:11] go out you know to church or to other
[11:13] places that were used to going out to
[11:15] it's a time where everybody wants to
[11:17] stay in the house we have to stay stay
[11:19] but just kind of to remember the stories
[11:22] that we talked about also relating to
[11:24] prayer talks about Daniel and we talked
[11:27] about Daniel how even though he was all
[11:30] by himself and he didn't have been in
[11:33] church to go gather to pray and he
[11:34] didn't have any family to pray with but
[11:37] still on his own even as a young boy he
[11:39] found time always to lock himself up in
[11:42] the room and to pray to God so that just
[11:45] shows to us that also in this time of
[11:47] pointing you know we can't go out to
[11:49] church or to Sunday school to worship
[11:51] God but even on our own we can always go
[11:54] we'll find time going our looms read our
[11:56] Bibles
[11:57] pray even we don't have to have our
[12:00] parents voices all the time so we can
[12:03] always do that and for Jonah also he
[12:06] talked about the story of Jonah and how
[12:07] even in the belly of the whale when
[12:10] things looked bad when he wasn't at
[12:13] church but he still had time where he
[12:14] could go on his knees and pray to God so
[12:17] even as us also where by our
[12:20] on our own excuse me maybe
[12:23] we can't go to church but we can still
[12:25] have timing no matter what situation to
[12:27] always go get down on our knees and pray
[12:29] to God pray for our parents pray for our
[12:32] church pray for our siblings pray for
[12:35] each other because the Bible tells us
[12:37] you know pray for one another so
[12:39] especially during this time maybe you
[12:41] might be okay I don't have school I'm
[12:42] kind of bored you know God always wants
[12:45] to hear your prayer and he loves when
[12:47] little children speak to God so take
[12:49] your time
[12:50] pray to God he's gonna hear you and he's
[12:53] gonna answer you because that's the God
[12:54] we serve all right thank you very much

[17:58] thank you
[18:00] for your blessings on me
[18:08] thank you Lord for your blessings on me
[18:20] [Applause]
[18:35] we all know that during this time we all
[18:39] have to stay at home the reason I have
[18:41] to stay at home is basically because
[18:42] they're trying to keep ourselves safe
[18:44] we're trying to pilot people say so
[18:46] amazing you might throw out a few mousy
[18:49] people with masks on we have that we
[18:51] called our social distancing basically
[18:53] you know not to get too close to anybody
[18:55] so that we don't throw jabs all get in
[18:58] contact with Jerry we're just washing
[19:00] your hands lease for 20 20 minutes and
[19:03] all that is good basically you're
[19:05] supposed to be doing that to keep myself
[19:06] safe but as Christians we also have to
[19:08] remember that we have our earth also and
[19:11] spiritual eyes that we have to try to
[19:12] protect and keep safe and keep
[19:14] maintaining right so it is more
[19:18] important a lot of times as well if we
[19:31] can give a better example and moving
[19:35] your phones or someone around us if
[19:37] they're happy and they're laughing
[19:38] they're even just a stranger with
[19:40] laughing or something like that you know
[19:42] even though rather lucky but all of a
[19:44] sudden you find yourself you're laughing
[19:46] and we're smiling well because they
[19:48] rubbed off on you right it's time to
[19:51] adjust so officials it's easy to catch
[19:53] so that's why a lot of times you ask
[19:55] them for SMS cooties rape are you all
[19:57] service and bad influences from Bad feds
[20:01] right because we're 10 so here goes to
[20:04] protect your physical your virtual
[20:06] office so that method would be nothing
[20:08] will be with you in birth rate but maybe
[20:10] right members a little bit ever really
[20:12] applied to me because we don't go I
[20:14] wouldn't do anything there even at home
[20:17] you know there's nothing to do these
[20:18] days now we have some other boosters our
[20:20] phones tablets or whatever and we might
[20:23] get distracted and remove that respect
[20:25] about our own spiritual life every but
[20:28] better with this triple and restores
[20:31] virtualize because we
[20:32] to take care of it so in all this we
[20:35] have to be careful that we're watching
[20:37] what we're listening to right to make
[20:39] sure that we have our particular member
[20:41] but I marvel oh yes so all that in comes
[20:44] in handy right because we never would
[20:47] try to do anything to just hinder our
[20:49] growth in the Lord and you know
[20:50] everybody will use anything any medals
[20:53] any little small from difficult earn you
[20:55] can't feel the junk it was very small to
[20:57] have to use your special microscopes
[20:59] special glasses just to see something
[21:01] with the bevel but that was very sneaky
[21:03] so here attitude to try to destroy you
[21:06] and took you from spiritual growing and
[21:08] let's virtual system I should say in
[21:09] that way so where is the key read your
[21:12] Bible for every day to keep your
[21:14] spiritual walk with them they're fresh
[21:17] growing and health and healthy we're
[21:19] trying to keep other people safe right
[21:21] if you have to watch how am i acting on
[21:25] people
[21:25] what am I saying you know this members
[21:30] helping Romania pegs listening or bowing
[21:33] just doing what you're supposed to do
[21:34] whatever the Word of God told you to do
[21:36] and obviously passed we were through
[21:40] that and all these things you just have
[21:42] to remember that God has survived in his
[21:44] hand he knows what he's doing he knew in
[21:46] his head he's protecting your best way
[21:48] at Sunday school here teachers here
[21:50] we're here baby
[21:52] we're help you in your spiritual
[21:54] multiplied so but you don't stop there

[21:58] Bibles probably better if you don't
[22:00] reassuring you were buying the best
[22:02] reputable ones to be happening to you so
[22:05] for the next week I whispering this time
