[27:23] peace if you have
[27:25] peace you have comfort
[27:29] when there is peace shom when we tell
[27:32] somebody
[27:34] shalom it's just like we read in the
[27:38] Bible the disciples were
[27:42] scared they were afraid of what happened
[27:44] to
[27:52] Jesus they didn't understand how such a
[27:54] great man could have been taken to the
[27:57] Grave
[27:58] and Jesus knowing that they had they had
[28:02] fear he came to tell them when he
[28:06] resurrected this is God Jesus's first
[28:08] words he said shalom
[28:12] shalom and me this
[28:14] morning I tell you shalom
[28:19] shalom May there not may your souls not
[28:22] be
[28:23] trouble may there not be
[28:26] troubles he who took your place he tells
[28:30] you shalom
[28:33] shalom peace be unto you amen
[28:37] amen and now this morning as we just
[28:40] read we
[28:44] see the first time God created in
[28:48] Genesis he created the
[28:53] sun it was the son to give us life in
[28:56] the natural
[29:00] that was the first time the sun
[29:02] rose it gave us a natural
[29:07] life
[29:09] resurrected it's the morning of the
[29:11] first day of the
[29:15] week the woman went to see
[29:19] Jesus while the sun was
[29:21] Rising brother brandham says that
[29:26] day the same Sun that God created in
[29:30] genis Rises up on this
[29:33] day now in given double
[29:37] life because it continues to give
[29:39] natural
[29:40] life but now this time the rising of the
[29:44] sun there is a good news Rising
[29:48] that called Jesus Christ is
[29:55] resurrected you know for him to
[29:57] resurrect
[30:00] at
[30:06] geeman the Bible says that oh brother
[30:09] brandom says that Jesus Christ died more
[30:11] at than at calary and that the father
[30:15] had left the body of Jesus now in the
[30:18] day of
[30:20] Resurrection the holy ghost that is the
[30:25] father went into the body of Christ
[30:29] it quickened that
[30:31] body and when it quickened that
[30:35] body that's what provoked the
[30:38] resurrection amen
[30:40] amen now as human
[30:43] beings born in
[30:45] sin when we accept
[30:48] Christ we receive the Holy
[30:53] Ghost and it's that very holy ghost that
[30:55] re resurrects us
[30:58] even if we
[31:02] die the Holy Ghost will take that body
[31:04] no matter where it
[31:06] is Quicken that
[31:09] body and we will
[31:11] resurrect that's why brother brandham
[31:14] says in that
[31:16] message what was the Holy Ghost given
[31:21] for uh what was the the Holy Ghost given
[31:26] for
[31:33] brother Bram
[31:36] says in our
[31:42] Christianity the proof that the God we
[31:45] worship is a real
[31:47] God it was that he died and
[31:50] resurrected every other religion their
[31:54] strength but our
[31:56] religion it's a real
[31:59] Rel because he left an empty grave amen
[32:07] amen those Muslims are in their
[32:11] Karam but they worship an imaginary God
[32:14] but now brother brandom says here there
[32:16] can be two
[32:18] men one of them just uh just extremely
[32:24] both of them
[32:26] justly
[32:32] one of them can be
[32:37] good he can do good
[32:40] works he can
[32:43] do but except that man has eternal life
[32:48] in
[32:50] him he will never in
[32:55] Resurrection he cannot do
[32:58] it there is nothing there to
[33:02] ra there is nothing to bring him
[33:07] up there is no
[33:09] life so you see my dear
[33:13] brothers my dear
[33:15] sister except a man be born
[33:20] again was back into this
[33:26] Kingdom
[33:29] I'm going to skip and go a little faster
[33:31] now now if you just got human life
[33:42] enough see that lives in pleasure he's
[33:46] dead where she's
[33:50] alive you can
[33:53] rise you may be the most popular girl in
[34:00] school you might be most popular girl in
[34:05] the the
[34:07] game on
[34:10] your you might be best
[34:14] dress in the
[34:16] country you might be
[34:20] pred you may be best dressed woman in
[34:24] the
[34:26] country
[34:28] you may be
[34:33] best you may be an idol to your
[34:39] husband you might be all those
[34:43] things that's
[34:45] wonderful but
[34:47] sister unless you have the Holy Ghost in
[34:52] you with his eternal
[34:55] life at the hand of this
[34:59] road you are
[35:03] finish and I don't care what you look
[35:09] like or how
[35:13] are or how unop or popular you
[35:19] are pretty or how you
[35:25] are if you got eternal
[35:30] life you live
[35:35] forever amen
[35:38] amen if God if Jesus was
[35:43] resurrected because the father quickened
[35:45] that
[35:47] body and the only thing that can
[35:49] resurrect
[35:50] us that eternal life that is the Holy
[35:53] Ghost amen
[35:56] amen
[35:58] without that we can't even speak of the
[36:00] Resurrection now my beloved brothers and
[36:03] sisters
[36:05] sisters as brother brandham just
[36:08] said you could be
[36:10] pretty well
[36:13] built but if the Holy Ghost is not
[36:15] within
[36:16] you you're done
[36:20] for no matter how many times you come to
[36:24] church when that moment comes won't be
[36:31] resurrected so you have to seek the Holy
[36:34] Ghost because it's the most important
[36:35] thing
[36:38] here brother Brenham says in the rising
[36:41] of the
[36:45] Sun in the rising of the
[36:52] sun paragraph 15 okay
[36:56] now
[37:00] how religious you
[37:04] are or how right you are in your
[37:13] Doctrine it doesn't matter to the
[37:17] devil are you
[37:20] follow no matter how religious you
[37:25] are no matter how right your do
[37:29] that doesn't bother the
[37:32] devil if you don't have that
[37:35] life that resurrected
[37:39] Jesus you won't come up
[37:43] anyhow no matter how
[37:46] religious how
[37:49] good how many churches you've belonged
[37:53] to or will belong
[37:56] to
[37:58] it doesn't matter one
[38:00] thing unless you have been born
[38:03] again
[38:06] therefore if God raised up Jesus from
[38:09] the
[38:12] dead did he
[38:20] raise and if that power comes in
[38:24] you Christians won't be afraid of that
[38:31] in this day where we're observing the
[38:32] resurrection of
[38:36] Christ it has to give a a certain
[38:40] courage to know that even death doesn't
[38:42] have power
[38:45] over and you can't be afraid of
[38:49] death in fact Christians don't
[38:52] die Christians change
[38:55] Dimensions it's better over there than
[38:57] here glory to
[39:02] God now when that was going
[39:06] on the women when they went to see Jesus
[39:09] at the grave they saw an angel who told
[39:13] them who are you looking
[39:16] for they were seeking somebody thinking
[39:19] that he was
[39:21] dead he's not
[39:23] dead he alive forever
[39:26] more here is where they bury
[39:30] them they saw the evidence of the
[39:32] resurrection of Christ and
[39:36] today the ma the fact that you have the
[39:39] Holy
[39:41] Ghost it's also proof of the
[39:45] Resurrection
[39:48] rapidly I'm going to read something mess
[39:52] shalom in that message
[39:56] shalom
[40:04] okay
[40:13] Shalom brother Bram says in paragraph
[40:18] 18 now my my text for this
[40:24] morning is a old woman
[40:29] shalom shalom shalom shalom in the
[40:33] Hebrews
[40:35] means
[40:37] peace and that's what I said to the
[40:41] church this
[40:44] morning shalom shalom that
[40:48] peace in finishing it's
[40:56] called
[41:00] which
[41:01] mean God's
[41:13] peace Jesus
[41:16] said don't be
[41:20] afraid don't think on what happened to
[41:23] Jesus yes he was
[41:26] dead but he was dead for our
[41:29] good it's that for our good he died
[41:33] because by his death we have
[41:36] life he said as I
[41:39] live you live
[41:44] also now there's a little quote that I
[41:47] wanted to close
[41:51] on that uh that quote will really KO the
[41:56] devil
[41:59] and be ready to receive that blessing
[42:01] that I'm about to pronounce amen

[42:09] Sun the rising of the
[42:11] sun it gives us life in the
[42:14] natural and it
[42:16] announces that the Son of God Jesus
[42:20] Christ is now the
[42:23] Conqueror he resurrected in our
[42:26] hearts mess and I'm hearing this message
