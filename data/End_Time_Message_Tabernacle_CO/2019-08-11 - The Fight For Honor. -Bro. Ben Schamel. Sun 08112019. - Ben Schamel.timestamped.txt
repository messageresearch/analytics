[10:10] boy secure movie all they know is to
[10:12] depend on themselves to give something
[10:14] deep oq amendment do you see the mixing
[10:17] that Satan has gotten into in the same
[10:19] middle school student
[10:22] the doctrine of balaam has has taken
[10:24] over and I go to develop my pilipenko
[10:26] nothing is white nothing is black here
[10:28] two billion won everything is great so
[10:31] again and we see this happening back way
[10:37] back in the world curse after balance
[10:39] about brother Branham saw way back
[10:40] trouble available bossy the John in
[10:45] Revelation saw way back I know Jean de
[10:47] la revolucion Ibaka this level above all
[10:49] bossy but we see how a wheat starts with
[10:52] a seed maneuver could do bleep most of
[10:54] all that you see man that seed is
[10:55] planted in the ground it's it's the most
[10:57] polluted no out there and then that that
[10:59] that seed has to die to itself it's the
[11:02] motor Dumoulin element and once it dies
[11:05] it cracks it lifted mr. deshield and
[11:07] that life starts producing in the ground
[11:10] I look at would be the research to grow
[11:13] some room a second if I put it in a
[11:14] scene and it starts shooting forth a
[11:16] blade it's not the Muslim so tell me
[11:18] like TVs are for long issues into a stop
[11:20] and also and then it's got a tassel its
[11:25] kind of shocked LaBelle and inside that
[11:29] shock as they see a link to the ballet
[11:31] Ellis emotes and we see the same thing
[11:33] happened with the church a new vocalist
[11:35] we started the times of Christ did it
[11:38] don't don't this and we start stair
[11:40] stepping up the seven churches does it
[11:43] actually give got Ephesus Smyrna
[11:45] Pergamum and we start climbing these
[11:48] statuses it Dublin up to the toward the
[11:50] top is just good be small and brother
[11:52] branham said that lady osya
[11:53] is the pinnacle aid a human and we could
[11:57] only leap if we could realize that this
[11:58] morning uncle is loose in my den that we
[12:00] are living in the pinnacle age to play
[12:02] but I love you blue kills for men a man
[12:05] we know that each age is built on the
[12:07] past church a usable to chuck a ship go
[12:09] Lucy will kill applause mr. Don now when
[12:12] that life began a put forth analyst is
[12:14] that victim was assaulted right there
[12:15] for a time that blade had life in it
[12:18] duties la pampa Navidad though that
[12:20] blade was Green
[12:21] these attempt aver that stock was green
[12:24] if they're in a belly dump event for a
[12:26] while that tassel was green but then
[12:28] dumped in a don't go vet it had
[12:30] life in it happen I'd be like they don't
[12:32] and we see that throughout the church
[12:34] ages the Lord would be in this church
[12:37] age they denominator around the holy
[12:41] store would have to move and it would go
[12:44] to the to the tassel and now it's going
[12:48] in back to the seed age I love the
[12:51] pinnacle age and a lady Asya that's you
[12:54] submitted I would you see a man I'm in
[12:58] the entire purpose under the big
[13:03] complaint of that plant descent Butler
[13:06] was to bring forth
[13:07] Sinitta poppy the original seed life
[13:11] Decimus oh you should never bring it up
[13:13] past the blade the purpose that the
[13:15] villa bring it up past the tassel
[13:17] possibility they put it into that see
[13:20] that it might produce that same life so
[13:23] it would be remembered it Dumbo so why
[13:25] would we look at our lives and expect
[13:28] anything different was shown in Jesus
[13:32] Christ himself men weren't anything
[13:35] different than what was in brother
[13:36] branham's life okay so before the secret
[13:38] don't because we are here to manifest
[13:40] something super when this same see gene
[13:43] life momentum nope that was in that see
[13:46] don't think the more food Abdullah the
[13:49] scripture says the qgs science shall
[13:51] follow them that believe
[13:53] you think Apple by numbers of gold
[13:54] please we are here to manifest that
[13:56] scripture people money for synthetic
[13:58] Petula if you're a believer he wasn't it
[14:01] how many believers do we have here this
[14:02] point
[14:03] then we have seed bringing forth light
[14:05] news of Elizabeth Gaddafi another
[14:08] purpose for that plan and no two-bit
[14:10] with that blah blah is to take a single
[14:12] seed to the put in filthy mouth and when
[14:15] it grows and it brings forth enough girl
[14:16] gonna be a boatload it would have no
[14:19] purpose if it brought forth one seed
[14:21] I'll still upon the beach the
[14:22] instruments uppity no to Samos
[14:23] there would be no game but again with
[14:27] the benefits but that seed must bring
[14:30] forth multiple green the program the
[14:36] scripture says greater works than these
[14:38] shall you do I know that
[14:40] not that we would do greater works than
[14:42] what Jesus nor the blue globe would have
[14:45] a multitude of evil enmity with that
[14:49] same see gene light if it the
[14:51] memberships living through their life he
[14:53] built over the no-fee that would be
[14:54] producing poor Jews are the Word of God
[14:57] not followed the Jew not some
[14:58] wishy-washy bucket there solutions like
[15:01] the word of Jesus max on the jitter
[15:03] their life look familiar no feet we
[15:05] should have people looking at our lives
[15:07] and be able to identify that they are
[15:10] Christians they could identify maybe
[15:15] don't they have been with Jesus Messiah
[15:16] double just you amen amen
[15:19] that's what they were producing back and
[15:22] look at the apology burgers are booked
[15:24] and they could identify that they had
[15:26] been with the double kiss can they do
[15:29] that with us don't baby them embrace the
[15:32] Lord some attempts are Benny hallelujah
[15:37] so I'd like to take our our thought from
[15:41] Esther this morning I love gonna be
[15:43] someone good person leave that stuff to
[15:45] Matt down Esther is a very common story
[15:48] to us as believers hello you start this
[15:51] there's a boom oh come come in for me
[15:52] new and there's a lot of focus on Esther
[15:55] herself epic ordered attacks on me as
[15:58] their element because she's a type of
[15:59] the brightest good HTP feely pulls the
[16:02] crystal mmm and I would like to look at
[16:05] it a little bit different and instead of
[16:07] looking at at at Esther I would like to
[16:09] look at Mordecai I love Melinda
[16:12] Doolittle us there's a measure to Lagos
[16:14] you
[16:14] because Mordecai is is a type of the
[16:18] believer but muggle should apply you and
[16:21] I believe that there are some lessons in
[16:22] here that we can take a look what
[16:23] evolution super bullzooka that would
[16:25] help us in our walk with you our go to
[16:28] Mass Effect live down there so if we
[16:29] look at Mordecai you'll see the good our
[16:30] model here is the uncle of Esther it did
[16:32] not lead us there he was a strong
[16:34] believer in it wasn't wishy-washy make
[16:38] the public they wasn't going to school
[16:40] and put me loose and then turn around in
[16:43] on Sunday morning it'll be motion about
[16:45] their say another thing you do not watch
[16:47] shows trying to be a chameleon they say
[16:49] that facility of my Bakula Mangla and
[16:51] when I'm in the green video way I dream
[16:53] I'm in the brown I turned brown specific
[16:56] good boy you see what that's a
[16:57] wishy-washy don't let my ability
[16:59] that's that's what Balaam one of your
[17:03] Israelites who that Israel it we're not
[17:05] to lose some pop but let's mix it
[17:09] couldn't ever know that's what happened
[17:11] with the Catholic Church particular
[17:12] disbelieve that faith and we see where
[17:14] it his brother su zombunny
[17:19] but regardless of the circumstances good
[17:22] book the Sikkim snows Mordechai believed
[17:25] God mothership he do it didn't matter
[17:28] what was happening I won't miss a bus
[17:30] another V Mordecai believed Johanna
[17:32] Shipley don't you the government comes
[17:34] in and takes his is this this girl that
[17:37] he took for his daughter
[17:38] yeah Mordecai didn't get upset mother
[17:43] sooner said before she he didn't hate
[17:44] their king you know by you know what he
[17:47] knew that God had a plan they said yeah
[17:49] and regardless of the circumstance so
[17:52] mystical stoic I believed God he could
[17:55] take God's Word
[17:56] Suffolk you pull up over the to apply it
[17:59] to his life today it's not jewelry not
[18:01] just put it back in the days of Moses
[18:04] the Muslims with employees not just put
[18:06] it back in the days of Adam no but
[18:08] someone shoot that dog but he had the
[18:09] Word of God being available for his day
[18:12] he tells you and that he
[18:14] me and his family it's tough for me it's
[18:17] fulfilling scripture for his day it
[18:19] feels like ability to pull else who a
[18:21] man I'm in so they take Esther out of
[18:24] his home no it's not a live inside my
[18:26] zone and he knew that it must be for
[18:28] good a Sabbath the scriptures say all
[18:32] things could you do could work together

[29:31] Mordecai was an unrecognized hero of the
[29:34] faith I know mother it didn't work
[29:36] in a typical Coonan I just love that it
[29:38] was should suck because there's there's
[29:40] there's Esther which was made a great
[29:42] name
[29:43] instead if they pop you love it then go
[29:45] Mordecai had saved the life of the king
[29:47] Manu Simon Seville did you walk and it
[29:50] went completely unrealistic balcony

[30:15] saved the life of the king another
[30:17] service to Villa did you walk we're
[30:19] getting something I lose I don't talk
[30:21] about but Haman hated it Mordecai he
[30:25] said because he wouldn't bow basically
[30:28] the Satan hates the believer I'm so
[30:30] happy because the believer will not bow
[30:32] to tourists one of the best things in
[30:34] before you hey man I'm in and so more
[30:40] I'm sorry Haman
[30:41] I know Amin didn't want to kill just
[30:44] Mordecai you know Villa but you just
[30:46] model he wanted to kill Mordecai he
[30:48] relate to your model he wanted to
[30:49] kill his family if I meet him up here
[30:51] cousins if the entire nation do
[30:55] planisphere the mother she because the
[30:57] acts of one man I cause his evidence
[30:59] alone Heyman thought it was worthless I
[31:04] know I'm not perfect at this if indeed
[31:06] to kill Mordecai just yet Matlacha soon
[31:09] and you're wondering why do I have all
[31:11] these problems
[31:12] Vudu pockets due to su problema well if
[31:16] Satan can't get to you then he'll find
[31:19] another route and he'll start working on
[31:21] someone else Ivanka both of us we've got
[31:23] conduct to try to get to you who is that
[31:26] game try to get to your children that
[31:27] was also try to get to your husband or
[31:29] wife Maria the pump will pump because he
[31:32] hates you basket you knew who improved
[31:38] so where it comes to Esther only
[31:40] probably nice there that Haman had
[31:44] devised to kill all of the Israelites
[31:46] I'm an ability that you do this writing
[31:48] so she invites the king and Haman to a
[31:50] private banquet I know a little bit
[31:52] I mean why doesn't banquet and they say
[31:55] so what do you want you guys tell you
[31:57] the boy says come back tomorrow and I'll
[31:59] tell my boy I didn't do much to do it

[32:06] prosecutor body goes ankle I am the next
[32:08] in line because he don't leave

[34:05] has everything under his control
[34:08] I'm looking at three months we only one
[34:10] or two oh wow
[34:13] didn't even buy thinking me but we must
[34:16] trace that all the way back to Matthew 4
[34:19] I don't know much about to look for Ida
[34:22] glue the gut because he had faced this
[34:24] same exact situation of emphasis in the
[34:28] body of Jesus Christ so this is reduced
[34:31] he took him out to the wilderness you
[34:33] know me too though the desert and he
[34:34] tempted him he that thought this I don't
[34:36] give you popularity sure to not make you

[34:47] what you have to do in return
[34:48] oh it is bow to me then clearly vermois
[34:50] worship me not do live walk but Jesus
[34:53] Christ could not do it by the fair
[34:55] because he knew he was about to purchase
[35:00] and then he goes down to you go to hell
[35:03] a boy don't fair and Jesus knocks on
[35:05] that door Susan plumb the answer and you
[35:07] will feel the devil says ah hi ha ha why
[35:10] does it do you I knew I could overcome
[35:13] just recursively Bank but what happened
[35:16] miss cos if I see Jesus Christ grab
[35:18] those leaves a billet of hell in the
[35:20] grave and now they are no longer in us
[35:23] overcoming being the Christian life
[35:25] Ventura because they have no hold on the
[35:28] believer even Buddha so soon acquire and
[35:30] you are that the devil's you you are
[35:34] losing the devil's reminder lose that
[35:38] Kiki's a bit luck that day with Christ

[35:44] sees you and you are bowing and a little
[35:46] work of Lulu thinking upon that scar
