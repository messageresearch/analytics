[1:02:12] wrong way from far could
[1:02:17] tell I
[1:02:21] said it might happen so let me just
[1:02:23] continue because I know I'm in the right
[1:02:27] way but as long as I was getting
[1:02:31] closer and I could notice the guy was
[1:02:33] just coming directly to my
[1:02:38] direction his way was empty Lane was
[1:02:43] empty I said wow what's going on okay I
[1:02:47] kept on
[1:02:48] going and then he was still coming

[1:04:14] glass and I was like what's going on
[1:04:17] with this

[1:05:36] the week
[1:05:37] Along on

[1:05:43] pastor I don't know how I'm going to

[1:06:01] that one day I was
[1:06:04] sick and God healed me
[1:06:07] here when I
[1:06:09] remember and I didn't tell him
[1:06:14] anything yesterday called me texted me
[1:06:16] was asking if I was doing

[1:06:26] asking me as if I told him I was
[1:06:31] sick may God bless you Pastor where you

[1:07:18] you and give you Victory amen
[1:07:22] amen uh don't
[1:07:25] as I have a little cold just bear with
[1:07:28] me a little
[1:07:30] bit I'll see how the Lord will lead
[1:07:38] me I just finish my thought about
[1:07:41] letting off the
[1:07:45] pressure letting off the
[1:07:51] pressure as we said last time
[1:07:59] the pressure it's something really
[1:08:00] really
[1:08:03] bad and the pressure gets
[1:08:07] everyone chisan or
[1:08:09] not everybody gets the
[1:08:13] pressure it gets to
[1:08:19] everybody now see people that are not
[1:08:22] Christian
[1:08:26] the way they do to uh relax themselves
[1:08:30] to to let off the
[1:08:34] pressure there's some that will go and
[1:08:36] take
[1:08:38] alcohol they will get
[1:08:42] drunk I I'll let off the pressure like
[1:08:47] that but after the the effect of the
[1:08:49] alcohol is gone the problem is still
[1:08:52] there
[1:08:58] some will go find pleasure in games and
[1:09:01] all kinds of
[1:09:04] things but that's not the
[1:09:08] solution but for the
[1:09:11] Christians the Christian has a
[1:09:15] solution and we we know that that
[1:09:18] solution
[1:09:20] amen and that's new birth
[1:09:26] that will take you to the City of
[1:09:30] Refuge but when I'm was speaking here in
[1:09:33] this
[1:09:35] message I believe in the same message
[1:09:37] letting off the
[1:09:41] pressure he preached in that
[1:09:47] context You Preach five times the same
[1:09:52] title
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:59] he was talking about a weapon that was
[1:10:07] bought a brother bought a a weapon to
[1:10:11] brother Billy
[1:10:13] Paul and the
[1:10:18] weapon brother Billy Paul was
[1:10:22] left-handed
[1:10:25] and that uh weapon that was purchased to
[1:10:29] for Billy
[1:10:37] Paul I'm in the message letting off the
[1:10:39] pressure preached in 1962 at Los Angeles
[1:10:42] June uh 6 June I mean June 22 in Los
[1:10:48] Angeles you said the paragraph
[1:10:52] 41
[1:10:59] I believe for our sister Carol
[1:11:01] everything is everything's good right
[1:11:06] okay uh it he said
[1:11:17] this my mother who know he just slipped
[1:11:20] to Heaven a few weeks
[1:11:22] ago was a half
[1:11:26] Indian and I just I just love the
[1:11:30] outdoors that's where I gave my
[1:11:34] shootings I never
[1:11:44] could I've got friends that would have
[1:11:47] bought me with buy a
[1:11:51] gun yeah don't say
[1:11:57] and that's right I have
[1:12:02] it but I couldn't think of letting my
[1:12:05] friend buy me a with buy
[1:12:10] gun that uh that brand would buy because
[1:12:13] it's a good
[1:12:15] quality that brand is a good quality and
[1:12:18] it cost a lot of
[1:12:20] money to some but bham says how a friend
[1:12:25] can buy me weapon like this that lot of
[1:12:29] money because while I have friends in
[1:12:33] Africa they are
[1:12:36] missionaries they preach the gospel
[1:12:38] without
[1:12:43] shoes I couldn't do
[1:12:47] it no I couldn't do
[1:12:49] that and so a brother
[1:12:52] said
[1:12:55] I have that gun bought out for you
[1:12:58] Billy and to be all
[1:13:04] right the brother said I'll take that
[1:13:07] gun that they bought for Billy
[1:13:17] Paul that was not the brand that wanted
[1:13:19] the buy
[1:13:22] gun
[1:13:25] brother say he will take that the
[1:13:27] brother said he will take that gun and
[1:13:28] take it to the
[1:13:31] company so it can be done
[1:13:39] again so that it can make it so it looks
[1:13:41] like it's a weby gun are you with
[1:13:45] me are you all right
[1:13:49] now and the
[1:13:52] brother
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:56] brother said the brother who had an idea
[1:13:58] was a Baptist filled with the Holy
[1:14:01] Ghost and he took it
[1:14:05] there and when I took it
[1:14:08] back now when Venom went to the shooting
[1:14:13] field to try to try
[1:14:18] it then what
[1:14:21] happened and I I
[1:14:24] introduced a bullet
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] there I tried to shoot to test it
[1:14:36] out and when he shoot to test
[1:14:41] it he found
[1:14:43] out it blow it
[1:14:47] up almost lost his
[1:14:51] life follow me that way brother
[1:14:55] bam got
[1:14:58] inspiration to preach about the
[1:15:03] pressure
[1:15:08] exploded of bullet just almost hit
[1:15:15] him could not understand why was going
[1:15:19] on he was thinking that he was dead
[1:15:21] while he was still alive
[1:15:26] and the the the the blood was coming out
[1:15:28] and spreading
[1:15:31] everywhere and I stood up easily and
[1:15:34] then I thought I was
[1:15:36] dead and it was uh
[1:15:40] just it's a tremendous
[1:15:51] thing I I got a little a message out of
[1:15:54] that that rle wasn't started started
[1:16:02] a if it would have been started at the
[1:16:05] beginning
[1:16:07] whereby it would have been all
[1:16:14] right because the still would have held
[1:16:17] the pressure of
[1:16:22] it because the that
[1:16:25] gun was another
[1:16:27] brand the brother said I'll take that
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:34] weapon and we can remodel it and by the
[1:16:38] the company called
[1:16:44] W say another message the way they did
[1:16:46] it
[1:16:51] again it's as if put a lot of holes in
[1:16:54] the the beginning of the the beginning
[1:16:56] of the the
[1:16:59] gun while the brand of that gun
[1:17:05] whereby it's done in such a way that it
[1:17:07] can
[1:17:12] hold after the the weapon was well
[1:17:16] done he was thinking everything would go
[1:17:19] well when he tried with the the gun with
[1:17:22] the bullets
[1:17:24] exploded and injured brother bham he
[1:17:31] said the reason why the the the the gun
[1:17:38] exploded because he wasn't the original
[1:17:40] of
[1:17:43] w Mr W was so
[1:17:47] nice he searched
[1:17:51] the he couldn't tell tell what
[1:17:58] happened but I thought it was head space
[1:18:01] that did
[1:18:05] it if that ra would have started at the
[1:18:10] beginning and come it will never blow
[1:18:16] up now listen
[1:18:19] friends let me say
[1:18:21] this
[1:18:23] when you go
[1:18:26] out professing
[1:18:32] Christianity just don't just take a Rec
[1:18:35] conversion idea of
[1:18:40] it are you follow what is coming out of
[1:18:43] that experience of the
[1:18:46] raffle that raffle was as a perfect
[1:18:50] one they just wanted to polish
[1:18:56] so that it can look
[1:19:00] like but it wasn't the original
[1:19:03] one that is why it
[1:19:06] exploded are you with
[1:19:11] me when a Christian claim to be a
[1:19:18] Christian while is not inside of him by
[1:19:23] what will
[1:19:24] happen it will blow
[1:19:27] up because the
[1:19:31] original is not original
[1:19:39] Christian don't try to impersonate
[1:19:41] someone
[1:19:42] else now
[1:19:47] listen don't just make
[1:19:51] out
[1:19:54] and join the
[1:19:57] church or sing the
[1:20:02] songs you got to be born
[1:20:08] again and start from the
[1:20:12] beginning amen amen amen amen
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:21] beloved to be a member of the
[1:20:25] church that will not save you
[1:20:30] amen that wouldn't save
[1:20:33] you the fact that you
[1:20:36] sing to be in a group we going to church
[1:20:40] that's good
[1:20:43] but if they inside of
[1:20:48] you there never been personal experience
[1:20:56] something changed
[1:20:58] you have been changed I have been
[1:21:03] changed if that's not the
[1:21:06] case you end up
[1:21:11] blowing because the pressure will come
[1:21:14] in various ways you see says he
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:20] said I I repeat this
[1:21:25] don't just make
[1:21:27] out and join
[1:21:31] church or sing the
[1:21:35] songs you got to be born
[1:21:39] again and start from the
[1:21:42] beginning
[1:21:45] then if you start from the
[1:21:51] beginning
[1:21:56] then it all the pressure as long as you
[1:21:59] got it so you won't blow
[1:22:01] up amen
[1:22:03] amen it means that
[1:22:08] that it couldn't hold the pressure of a
[1:22:12] bullet as a
[1:22:15] Christian when we come to
[1:22:17] Jesus when we believe the
[1:22:20] word we have to believe the word
[1:22:23] with all our
[1:22:25] hearts something has called
[1:22:29] us that thing convinced
[1:22:32] us
[1:22:34] that this message is the
[1:22:37] truth and once we have been
[1:22:42] convinced that has to take us to the new
[1:22:45] ver because Jesus
[1:22:47] said in John chapter
[1:22:51] 3
[1:23:05] John John chapter
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:13] 3
[1:23:16] okay these are the thing that we already
[1:23:20] know we can take verse
[1:23:25] five Jesus answered this is the
[1:23:28] interview of Jesus with
[1:23:33] Nicodemus I
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:38] said except a man be born of
[1:23:44] spirit of water he cannot enter in the
[1:23:47] kingdom of God he
[1:23:51] said
[1:23:55] that which is born of flesh is
[1:23:59] flesh that which is born of spirit is
[1:24:05] Spirit Marvel not I said unto thee he
[1:24:08] must be born again amen
[1:24:12] amen that which is flesh is
[1:24:16] flesh but if someone is born
[1:24:21] again he will not work according to the
[1:24:23] law of
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:25] [Applause]
[1:24:26] Flesh he's a change man he works
[1:24:29] according to
[1:24:30] the even though the pressure
[1:24:34] comes that thing inside of
[1:24:39] him will be like to cool down his life
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:46] amen if there's not that thing in
[1:24:51] him
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:24:56] that's why I love my my young brothers
[1:24:58] and
[1:25:05] sisters the fact that you agreed to come
[1:25:07] to church that means there's something
[1:25:09] inside of
[1:25:10] you but that doesn't stop
[1:25:15] there that did something to bring us
[1:25:19] here maybe mom mama was pushing you go

[1:31:58] prayer the wrong medication that he
[1:32:01] got you you would have you would have

[1:32:14] Billy to meet God face to face
[1:32:18] amen are you with
[1:32:20] me
[1:32:23] religion of your father and your mother
[1:32:25] will not save
[1:32:28] you you have to be sure
[1:32:34] yourself even now the the atomic
[1:32:39] bomb I have to be sure that there's
[1:32:41] something
[1:32:42] inside that will take me where brother
[1:32:45] bham is am
[1:32:47] amen it's not because my my dad was a
[1:32:50] preacher
[1:32:54] my mother she's a servant of
[1:32:57] God it needs I need
[1:33:00] myself you
[1:33:03] know if there's one thing that God
[1:33:09] loves it's to see The Thirst of the
[1:33:11] child of God SE after when you have that
[1:33:15] thirst God will manifest always
[1:33:20] amen is not right I always
[1:33:25] said I don't want to
[1:33:30] impersonate I don't want to be actor a
[1:33:36] pH people know that he's a good brother
[1:33:40] he always comes to
[1:33:41] church every time he's
[1:33:44] there if you ask him to do something
[1:33:46] he'll do
[1:33:47] it that's from the eye of people
[1:33:52] but what we speaking of
[1:33:56] here what does God say about your life
[1:33:59] is inside of your
[1:34:00] life because when the pressure will
[1:34:03] come that will destroy
[1:34:06] everything in Matthew chapter
[1:34:11] 18 Matthew chapter
[1:34:15] 18 was speaking
[1:34:18] of on the basis of New Birth
[1:34:41] uh say he says
[1:34:50] this
[1:34:59] Matthew 19 Jesus was saying
[1:35:17] this verse 18 he
[1:35:20] says uh uh uh rather ver verse 13 and
[1:35:27] 14 my thought in verse
[1:35:31] 14 children was Bor to
[1:35:34] Jesus now notice what Jesus
[1:35:50] said
[1:36:01] 194 but Jesus said suffer the little
[1:36:04] children and forbid them not to come
[1:36:07] unto me for of such is the Kingdom of
[1:36:11] Heaven amen
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:22] for of such is the kingdom of God of
[1:36:26] Heaven All The
[1:36:28] Children notice the children how they
[1:36:33] behave you can have you can be in
[1:36:36] trouble with a kid you beat him for
[1:36:39] example you slap him right
[1:36:43] now he will weep and
[1:36:47] shout and after just few
[1:36:50] minutes ask ask him you told you you
[1:36:52] call
[1:36:55] him he will be as happy as nothing
[1:36:59] happen you won't even know that you bit
[1:37:05] him and Jesus telling us that the
[1:37:08] Kingdom of Heaven is as
[1:37:11] such to be like that it takes the new
[1:37:15] birth because as human
[1:37:17] beings especially us
[1:37:19] adults you do something to me now and
[1:37:23] after a
[1:37:25] while you call me to do something for
[1:37:29] you it takes God in my
[1:37:32] heart that's the reason why
[1:37:34] Jesus the king
[1:37:38] of belongs to them that like these
[1:37:44] children Beloved the basis of
[1:37:47] Christianity is the new
[1:37:49] birth we can do
[1:37:52] everything we can preach
[1:37:55] Mysteries and you notice the new
[1:37:59] birth will balance our
[1:38:02] church the new
[1:38:05] birth will give love to a
[1:38:10] family the man has to know my wife she's
[1:38:13] born
[1:38:15] again and my the husband the wife knows
[1:38:18] also my husband is born again yes we can
[1:38:23] make but there's evidence that shows
[1:38:25] there the new
[1:38:27] birth if there's that new
[1:38:31] birth we are in the City of
[1:38:34] Refuge because the new
[1:38:37] birth will allow me to respect my
[1:38:40] brother I'll respect my sister even if
[1:38:44] it's a little I'll respect him amen
[1:38:49] amen God happen
[1:38:52] us may God help
[1:38:56] us told
[1:39:02] us when there's a lot of shaking or
[1:39:06] problem it's by the lack of New Birth
[1:39:10] but if there was a new birth everyone
[1:39:12] would have
[1:39:13] understood and simplify things the new
[1:39:18] birth will lead you to for get that you
[1:39:23] right to save somebody amen
[1:39:30] amen amen
[1:39:34] amen are you
[1:39:36] tired this is just
[1:39:42] introduction my thought is more on that
[1:39:47] City how will you be in that City if
[1:39:49] you're not born again
[1:39:53] you know it will be like a
[1:39:55] song we are in the City of
[1:39:59] Refuge no wonder that people that in the
[1:40:01] City of
[1:40:02] Refuge but they criticize one
[1:40:06] another they don't trust each
[1:40:09] other here we in the City of
[1:40:13] Refuge you ran to seek
[1:40:16] refe he ran to seek
[1:40:19] safy that would have brought us
[1:40:23] closer but instead of
[1:40:26] that we criticize one
[1:40:29] another there's something wrong
[1:40:32] there we have to go back to the
[1:40:36] beginning or it will be as that gun will
[1:40:40] explod but just a little pressure that
[1:40:42] will come they got to help
[1:40:46] us in that
[1:40:49] message the
[1:40:52] pressure the message preach and on the
[1:40:57] 1862 May
[1:41:10] 18
[1:41:13] parag 43 he says
[1:41:19] this
[1:41:23] he says
[1:41:25] this notice there are you
[1:41:33] there may
[1:41:42] 1862 notice there the zone of safety of
[1:41:47] God the place of Refuge of God
[1:41:53] when we are
[1:41:54] there in that place of
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:59] Refuge we have right to the power
[1:42:02] healing
[1:42:08] power if God will forgive his enemy and
[1:42:11] take him into the
[1:42:17] Refuge how much more will he take off
[1:42:20] take care of him after he has got him
[1:42:23] there
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:26] see there's a healing
[1:42:29] power so when a Christian gets
[1:42:33] sick there's no need of being all steam
[1:42:36] up
[1:42:37] body just
[1:42:41] remember by stes we are
[1:42:44] healed that's the
[1:42:46] promise he promised
[1:42:49] it
[1:42:51] so he can't just take it
[1:42:55] back it's a place of Refuge for our
[1:42:57] sickness for our
[1:43:01] worries cast all your
[1:43:04] cares cast all your cares upon
[1:43:07] Him for he cares for you am
[1:43:11] amen that's a
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:14] refuge trust in his
[1:43:17] word his
[1:43:19] promises every promise that he had
[1:43:22] made belongs to
[1:43:25] you as long as you're you in in his
[1:43:31] kingdom as long as you come to him for
[1:43:37] Refuge then you have a right to every
[1:43:39] promise that he made amen amen amen
[1:43:44] amen I believe that we understood that
[1:43:47] City of Refuge as we learned last time
[1:43:51] it's in the Old
[1:43:54] Testament with that law of ey for ey and
[1:43:57] to for
[1:43:59] to you do something
[1:44:01] wrong they will hunt you to kill
[1:44:06] you even if you didn't do it
[1:44:10] willfully you you forced to
[1:44:13] die but by the grace of
[1:44:15] God the god who's rich in
[1:44:18] Mercy he always found
[1:44:22] he always finds a
[1:44:24] way to escape
[1:44:27] innocent he always made a
[1:44:30] way always a
[1:44:32] way so that his own
[1:44:35] children so that they may not

[1:48:14] the child and he took the child to the
[1:48:16] bed of el he said that can work
[1:48:21] call me the
[1:48:24] prophet and she took the
[1:48:27] camels and she said I'm going and she
[1:48:30] was
[1:48:31] going to find El Elijah who was at the
[1:48:36] mountain and
[1:48:39] notice elah as a
[1:48:41] prophet where the mountain where he
[1:48:44] was he noticed the woman
[1:48:47] coming he said wow how so
[1:48:51] the way I'm sewing that woman the
[1:48:53] pressure coming something's going
[1:48:56] on says as a prophet he started
[1:49:01] saying what's going on but God didn't
[1:49:04] tell him
[1:49:07] anything and when the woman got
[1:49:10] to and the prophet ask a
[1:49:13] question is everything all right with
[1:49:16] you and the shunamite woman said all is
[1:49:22] well say I love that kind that the
[1:49:26] attitude that brings
[1:49:30] Miracle when you do the very opposite of
[1:49:32] what the devil is presenting to
[1:49:34] you God will be obliged to come on the
[1:49:38] scene with a dead
[1:49:41] child they asking you is everything all
[1:49:45] right and and the woman
[1:49:49] said all is
[1:49:55] well may God give us people with such
[1:49:59] F somebody's going through the fire but
[1:50:04] he could
[1:50:05] say all is
[1:50:09] well somebody is shaken by sickness but
[1:50:12] he can say all is
[1:50:16] well you will see how God will change
[1:50:19] the situation
[1:50:21] and the
[1:50:23] prophet when he saw something was
[1:50:26] wrong just go a little
[1:50:31] faster the prophet got to the house of
[1:50:33] that
[1:50:34] woman when he got
[1:50:39] there the prophet started walking up and
[1:50:43] down
[1:50:45] said he
[1:50:47] wanted the prophet wanted
[1:50:51] the prophet wanted God to reveal him
[1:50:54] something but as he was walking
[1:50:57] around God did not reveal him
[1:51:03] anything sometime God doesn't reveal
[1:51:05] everything to his
[1:51:07] Serv and he did this he was
[1:51:10] walking and he noticed there was nothing
[1:51:14] and then and then he said I have nothing
[1:51:17] to
[1:51:18] do and he lied
[1:51:21] over over the
[1:51:25] child his
[1:51:26] no his nose on the nose of the Dead the
[1:51:30] eye on the
[1:51:32] eye he lied on top of him and you know
[1:51:35] the
[1:51:36] story
[1:51:38] until I believe a
[1:51:42] prophet I believe even everything that
[1:51:44] he's wearing is Anointed to the the
[1:51:47] point you know in the time of Paul
[1:51:51] the handkerchief that he was
[1:51:54] using people would just take those
[1:51:57] handkerchief and they will send to
[1:52:00] people and they were healed and I
[1:52:03] believe a man of God that is
[1:52:07] Anointed that has the anointing of
[1:52:11] God everything he touches has to be
[1:52:15] anointed because Elijah was
[1:52:18] anointed
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:22] when his body was in contact with a dead
[1:52:26] child the miracle
[1:52:28] happened the child rose
[1:52:31] again say see what
[1:52:35] happened theam
[1:52:39] woman let off the
[1:52:41] pressure what
[1:52:44] happened she knew how to do
[1:52:47] it she knew
[1:52:51] if I go to the representative of
[1:52:54] God God can use the man of
[1:52:57] God the same God that used the man of
[1:53:00] God still using men of God today he
[1:53:04] doesn't change but
[1:53:07] says when the Bible

[1:53:14] today and
[1:53:16] forever brother bam says
[1:53:21] he says it's the same yesterday today

[1:53:24] forever except this

[1:53:33] body Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:53:36] today and
[1:53:36] forever not the body amen
[1:53:41] amen except this physical
[1:53:44] body what does it
[1:53:47] mean that God doesn't change
[1:53:52] he can use any other
[1:53:54] body he can use you you pray for
[1:53:58] somebody and the thing
[1:54:00] happen it's still the same God that is
[1:54:04] yet the

[1:57:46] seeing those were the wings of God for
[1:57:49] is
[1:57:52] that's how God took them to the promised
[1:57:56] land today we had another
[1:58:00] Moses and he explained to us the
[1:58:04] Bible when we follow what he
[1:58:06] says when we believe what he

[2:04:02] trust even when Jesus didn't answer the
[2:04:05] prayer what

[2:06:46] Refuge when you are SE in the
[2:06:50] meeting and you are being
[2:06:54] pressured I didn't receive the prayer
[2:06:57] card I've seen people doing
[2:07:00] it they were so
[2:07:05] tensed they missed
[2:07:11] everything I see them standing in the
[2:07:13] prayer line in the
[2:07:15] meeting they come up and
[2:07:17] say
[2:07:20] you fighting you fighting all your
[2:07:24] kids I need this I need
[2:07:26] this don't do
[2:07:30] that come with
[2:07:33] boldness
[2:07:36] re come in the presence of
[2:07:41] God knowing that God made a promise that
[2:07:44] settled
[2:07:45] it Mar came up
[2:07:51] and said Lord if you would have been
[2:07:54] here
[2:07:56] listen she didn't say why didn't you
[2:08:01] come but she said if you would have been
[2:08:05] here my brother will not
[2:08:09] die but even now
[2:08:12] Lord whatever you ask God God will give
[2:08:16] it to you I'm
[2:08:20] saying she let off the
[2:08:22] pressure because of that
[2:08:29] attitude though her eyes was stri with
[2:08:35] tears even though her feeble body was
[2:08:40] war but she she was at the
[2:08:46] feet but she could say this
[2:08:50] if you would have been
[2:08:51] here my brother would have not de but
[2:08:55] now even
[2:08:56] now whatever you ask
[2:08:58] God going to give it to
[2:09:02] you I like
[2:09:05] that yes
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:11] sir and she got what she came
[2:09:14] for
[2:09:16] why she come up into
[2:09:19] presence not all Ste
[2:09:21] of oh
[2:09:24] my maybe sometime when we come to
[2:09:28] church yes it's true we might have
[2:09:30] problem we might have pressure but when
[2:09:33] we
[2:09:36] come let's show to God a good
[2:09:39] attitude you know you're coming to
[2:09:43] God you don't come to meet the
[2:09:46] pastor you don't come to meet the
[2:09:49] or
[2:09:51] whoo you come into the presence of
[2:09:55] God change your
[2:09:57] attitude because your
[2:10:01] attitude God is able to change just
[2:10:03] based on your
[2:10:05] attitude when we come into the presence
[2:10:07] of
[2:10:09] God we don't come as we are so
[2:10:12] frustrated
[2:10:14] we when problem comes to us we still
[2:10:18] this
[2:10:20] flesh I'm not saying you cannot cry even
[2:10:23] Jesus chry will even wh because we're
[2:10:28] still in this body but
[2:10:31] inside when the new birth is
[2:10:35] there it gives you a certain
[2:10:39] approach how you can approach to
[2:10:43] the many people
[2:10:47] think
[2:10:49] if an evangelist comes from
[2:10:51] somewhere he comes and he preach to
[2:10:54] preach he pray for the
[2:10:57] sick
[2:10:58] says and people are healed and people
[2:11:04] says that eventually has more power than
[2:11:07] our P say that's wrong he
[2:11:11] says
[2:11:14] it's expectation that people have toward
[2:11:17] the
[2:11:20] that what brings forth the
[2:11:22] results if you have the same
[2:11:27] expectation any other
[2:11:29] GI God will bring the same results am
[2:11:33] amen and Mary
[2:11:36] Mar has the same
[2:11:39] approach she was not
[2:11:42] Disturbed despite
[2:11:44] all she came with reverence you see oh
[2:11:49] oh she

[3:00:30] father so long as your name is in our
[3:00:34] mouths we know that hell is
[3:00:37] trembling because brother brandham
[3:00:42] says even the weak weest Christian of
[3:00:46] all when they bow their
[3:00:50] head and call on the name of Jesus
[3:00:53] Christ and starts to
[3:00:56] pray hell starts to
[3:00:59] tremble truly we believe that hell is
[3:01:02] trembling by the power of the word that
[3:01:05] has been preached
[3:01:07] Lord what
[3:01:09] Grace to hear such
[3:01:12] things as one day
[3:01:14] you
[3:01:17] said many sought to hear what you are
[3:01:22] hearing but it hasn't been given to them
[3:01:26] but for you it's been
[3:01:29] given it's the food that you've kept in
[3:01:34] store and when the food is kept in
[3:01:36] [Music]
[3:01:37] store it's for us to take the
[3:01:41] key to open
[3:01:45] the place where the food is
[3:01:47] kept and to take forth and eat
[3:01:51] of that food is nothing else but the
[3:01:54] word of
[3:01:55] the and everything that we
[3:01:58] need is found in this
[3:02:00] [Music]
[3:02:01] message to even have the
[3:02:05] medicine that could help us release that
[3:02:08] press found in the Bible and in the
[3:02:12] message time where the pressure is
[3:02:15] everywhere even our
[3:02:17] sisters our little
[3:02:19] brothers
[3:02:21] Lord they come and
[3:02:24] they even at school that
[3:02:27] there's even us at
[3:02:29] work there's so much pressure
[3:02:33] Lord the doctors that could do
[3:02:36] something they go through
[3:02:39] pressures sometimes even in church
[3:02:42] there's even pressures
[3:02:45] but the world doesn't
[3:02:47] know have that remedy that could solve
[3:02:50] that
[3:02:51] problem turn our sight
[3:02:55] towards and they go and
[3:02:58] take
[3:03:00] drugs and drink an
[3:03:03] alcohol thinking that they could release
[3:03:06] that brother brandom says the act of
[3:03:09] drinking the act of
[3:03:10] smoking that is not going to release
[3:03:14] pressure but that on the other hand is
[3:03:17] add to the pressure oh God one day they
[3:03:21] asked to a small
[3:03:22] go why are you taking
[3:03:26] drugs and he said that it helps me
[3:03:28] release
[3:03:29] depression but if that helps you release
[3:03:31] the
[3:03:32] pressure why are you finding yourself in
[3:03:36] places it'll never release the pressure
[3:03:39] but the only
[3:03:41] thing that could help us release
[3:03:45] word
[3:03:46] Lord that's why we want to receive your
[3:03:49] word in our hearts so that when pressure
[3:03:52] comes once
[3:03:54] again that we can seek refuge in you
[3:03:57] Lord I remember one
[3:03:59] day Moses had so much pressure to one to
[3:04:03] the point where he
[3:04:07] said I
[3:04:10] have I don't have the breast so I can
[3:04:15] give so that they don't seek me
[3:04:19] Lord there was so much
[3:04:22] pressure one day our
[3:04:24] Prophet was going through so much
[3:04:27] pressure to a point where he even li
[3:04:30] when he
[3:04:31] left he
[3:04:34] said why did you do
[3:04:36] that but the prophet said I was there
[3:04:41] but your servant was going through
[3:04:42] pressures
[3:04:44] one day even M
[3:04:46] herself was going through so much
[3:04:49] pressure to a point where she even asked
[3:04:53] brother you not Joseph and brother Bram
[3:04:58] said I can't do it but she closed the
[3:05:02] door at the difference
[3:05:06] Lord you took position for your service
[3:05:09] you told him to go pray to go repent
[3:05:14] because you didn't like that but for
[3:05:17] Ma you told your
[3:05:20] servant go and talk to
[3:05:22] her she has saddened the Holy
[3:05:25] Spirit and the prophet went
[3:05:27] towards and the prophet said
[3:05:30] to Ma I want to talk to
[3:05:33] you Ma you know how much I love
[3:05:36] you you have done it sad in the Holy
[3:05:40] Spirit God you you didn't like it so
[3:05:42] much that
[3:05:44] even her attitude wasn't correct towards
[3:05:47] your
[3:05:49] servant and Lord you Afflicted her so
[3:05:52] bad and
[3:05:53] father the one
[3:05:56] thing you sent your Prophet to
[3:06:00] that and when the prophet went towards

[3:06:08] acted father wouldn't you act in this
[3:06:11] place Lord look among

[3:06:28] Mercy can you be merciful to
