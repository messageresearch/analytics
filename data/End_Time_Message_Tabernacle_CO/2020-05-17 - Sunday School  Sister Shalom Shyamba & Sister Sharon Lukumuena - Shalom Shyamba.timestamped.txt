[5:10] you know few minutes we're just gonna
[5:11] share a little something with you just
[5:13] encourage you and today we're gonna talk
[5:15] about some of the stories that brother
[5:18] Branham told he liked he liked to tell
[5:20] stories to children because you know
[5:22] Plus children are also important and
[5:24] what you're learning now is you know I'm
[5:26] not sleeping here for the rest of your
[5:28] life so I'm just going to tell you a
[5:29] little story that brother Dan I'm told I
[5:32] know I don't know some of you the credit
[5:34] but it's a story talking about it other
[5:38] than a little bit of the school and one
[5:41] day there was the Kings was gonna pass
[5:44] by and so the teachers gathered all the
[5:47] students from each class you know from
[5:48] first grade second grade from
[5:50] kindergarten all the little kids
[5:52] gathered and they were gonna go outside
[5:54] and see the King and they gave that all
[5:58] the little kids little flags so every
[6:00] time so when they see their King passed
[6:01] by the kids will mix up their flag and
[6:03] wave it's the king and there was a seal
[6:05] king pass sight so all the kids gathered
[6:08] outside and everyone was excited yes
[6:10] we're gonna see the king we're gonna see
[6:12] the king and the King passed by in his
[6:14] chariot and all the kids waved their
[6:17] flags even the little kids and the older
[6:19] kids everyone waved the flag as the King
[6:20] passed by it and then the
[6:23] and after the king passed by and all the
[6:26] children kind of gathered themselves
[6:27] back to go back into the classroom the
[6:30] teacher noticed that one of the girls
[6:32] was missing and she started looking
[6:34] around for that girl and she couldn't
[6:36] find the little kid once where did she
[6:37] go what happens here where they should
[6:39] go and she heard all the sudden she
[6:43] heard a little boy sleeping you know
[6:44] like when someone is crying she could
[6:48] hear so she went and she followed the
[6:50] weeping found me she found the little
[6:52] girl sitting down and crying and so the
[6:56] teacher asked her what's going on why
[6:58] why are you crying why are you sad
[7:00] didn't you see the king and she said yes
[7:02] thank you
[7:04] and then the teacher was like then why
[7:06] are you crying that you saw the king did
[7:10] you wave your flag and political said
[7:11] yes I raised my blood and the teacher
[7:15] said so why are you crying then why are
[7:17] you so upset
[7:18] is something wrong what happened and the
[7:20] little girl said well I waved my bag and
[7:23] I'm father king but I'm so little and so
[7:26] small that's the King didn't see me and
[7:31] that's where the random told backstory
[7:33] the backstory is kind of like us maybe
[7:36] the king back then we told healer king
[7:39] to the human being like he was talking
[7:41] by and there was a lot of children he
[7:43] couldn't see all the little children but
[7:45] that's different with us and origins our
[7:47] King eirick unique the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:49] and Jesus feed everything he feeders no
[7:52] matter how small we are no matter how
[7:54] little we are no matter where we hide
[7:57] ourselves even if we hide ourselves
[7:58] under the bed in the dark got to look
[8:01] everywhere we are everything that he
[8:03] does keep people so that's why that's
[8:06] what's different between our team the
[8:08] God the king that we said in the king
[8:10] and the king of this world so what is
[8:12] the perfect is color for something to
[8:14] tell us that no matter where you are
[8:16] just know that we're the king watching
[8:18] over you no matter what you do even if
[8:21] you're like well my mom and dad can't
[8:23] see me I'm just gonna steal this little
[8:25] piece of candy and nobody's gonna see it
[8:27] you know who can see you God can food
[8:29] and he could be in the Black Moon I
[8:31] think I'm stealing I see this little
[8:33] girl steering it's simply stealing and
[8:35] God's God
[8:37] and you will remember that if you don't
[8:40] confess that so another story that I
[8:46] wanted to tell you what's also from
[8:47] rebel Brownback he told kid
[8:49] it was in brother Branham was a little
[8:51] boy see brother Branham came from a big
[8:54] family he had a lot of students Auto
[8:56] brothers especially and one day since
[9:00] they grew up in of course families they
[9:02] would go out maybe once in a while and
[9:04] you know they would get candy and they
[9:05] gave him all little pieces of candy you
[9:07] know all kids love candy so they gave
[9:10] all the venoms pieces of candy and
[9:12] brother Brandon had his piece of candy
[9:14] but he covered it but he colored his
[9:16] when he just ate a little bit and he
[9:18] took his wrapper and he put it back on
[9:19] I'm gonna chew spit and I'm gonna hide
[9:21] it and I'm gonna use it for some time
[9:23] later so then you know at home always
[9:27] okay sometimes our parents can call it
[9:29] and be like hey Michael give me water
[9:32] HM you're going to this so that how it
[9:34] was in brother branham's houses so one
[9:37] day I think it was Monday mornings the
[9:40] branham's mom called them in that area
[9:42] and he said yes mom and he said and she
[9:46] said can you go get the water you know
[9:48] they didn't back then we didn't have a
[9:49] lot of the chicken you know it's you
[9:51] know the thing that a fussing get water
[9:52] they have to go get water from down the
[9:54] stream at the river and she said William
[9:57] can you go get water and Lillian was
[9:59] like I don't want to go get water he
[10:01] didn't want to go get water but again we
[10:03] don't want to go get the water so he
[10:04] said I'm going to my brother to do it
[10:06] and he thought he went a little good and
[10:09] said can you go get the water for me and
[10:11] he said no that's your job you go get it
[10:13] under the denim well you know what he
[10:15] did he pulled out the candy he said here
[10:18] he'll kill the piece of candy I'll let
[10:20] you suck on this candy and you go get
[10:23] the water for me and the brother was
[10:24] like yes candy so he put the candy in
[10:27] his rock and studied and said
[10:28] I'll give Kelly you suck at Kentucky
[10:30] it's a 10-9 it was a were you counting
[10:32] too fast nor dost and he started
[10:34] counting ten nine eight seven six five
[10:37] four three two one and he took it up and
[10:40] the random rap that they can be gonna
[10:42] kept against the next time so I know
[10:45] some of us I know the Benham told the
[10:47] story when he told her story he told a
[10:48] keep it that don't try that don't try
[10:50] doing that he stopped
[10:51] it's not being honest right because if
[10:53] you can't tell you to do something you
[10:55] have to do it because it's your
[10:57] responsibility you can't try you know
[10:59] passing off with Emily a little brother
[11:00] so you do that if you do that now if
[11:03] your parents tell you to do something
[11:04] you have to be obedient and make sure
[11:06] that you listen trunk am you obeyed to
[11:08] them so that's just to show you that
[11:10] even when we do little stuff like that
[11:12] was do our little sneaky tricks you know
[11:13] I'm gonna lie to my parents I'm gonna
[11:15] feel this God he's everything that we do
[11:18] and not only their teeth we are negative
[11:20] stuff but he seemed all to the positive
[11:22] stuff that we do maybe one day maybe
[11:25] your parents blamed you for something
[11:27] that you didn't do God will see you
[11:29] right God will be like no I know that's
[11:30] display the good boy every morning when
[11:33] she wakes up she gets on his neither be
[11:34] praised as you read the Bible God sees
[11:37] all the good things that you do and even
[11:39] at times when you're sitting there maybe
[11:41] you're sad or just crying about
[11:43] something we upset so that God is gone
[11:46] and even when you say your prayer no
[11:48] matter how down or how big enough you
[11:50] miss me God is always there to listen
[11:52] and he sees everything that you need and
[11:54] the wonderful thing about our King is
[11:56] that he he knows what we mean even
[11:59] before we say it so maybe I think I
[12:01] might wake up and I'd be like I want a
[12:02] couple of juice but God already knew
[12:05] that way before I even really asked him
[12:08] that so that's why I wasn't listening to
[12:10] keep our relationship that God always
[12:11] all that you know God hears me God is
[12:14] watching over me God is affecting me God
[12:17] wants to hear from me if you want
[12:18] something to be in fellowship then don't
[12:20] stop it so those are the little lessons
[12:23] that I wanted to share for you for today
[12:25] I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned
[12:27] something and when we get back together
[12:30] I'm gonna be asking you guys questions
[12:32] about these so make sure you're paying
[12:33] attention forgive me go back to Luke oh
[12:35] I'm gonna be asking guys question so
[12:38] make sure you pay attention all right
[12:40] thank me when they're gonna patch it up
[12:42] with Stallone
[12:43] all right Sharon thank you for the
[12:46] lesson there's a lot that you can learn
[12:48] out of that listening excuse me
[12:51] basically everything that you do no
[12:54] matter what you do just know that God
[12:56] can see you you can never hide from him
[12:58] even if you dug a big hole in the ground
[13:00] or you swam into the big ocean and you
[13:02] went all the way down
[13:04] we're out outer space you know was still
[13:08] find you because he created everything
[13:10] and the Bible says everything that she
[13:12] would do even if you were doing it unto
[13:14] men or to whoever do it as if you're
[13:16] going to do it unto God so just remember
[13:18] that Auto Oh God always sees whatever
[13:20] you do and he's gonna hold you
[13:22] responsible for doing if you did it
[13:24] right if you did it wrong right if you
[13:26] do it and you neglected how you were
[13:28] doing it right because everything he
[13:30] wants you to do whatever you're doing
[13:31] you're you're doing it as if you're
[13:33] doing unsubscribed you know because even
[13:35] the Bible says that even a little cup of
[13:37] water that you give to someone so every
[13:41] even the littlest small thing even if
[13:44] you're praying for somebody or you just
[13:45] go over you say hi to somebody asked how
[13:47] they were doing right or helping
[13:49] somebody or giving a little small
[13:51] courage meant to somebody God sees that
[13:53] and keep counting that off he's checking
[13:56] that off the case and saying oh look at
[13:57] my daughter look at my son they're doing
[13:59] a good job they're leaving they're right
[14:00] there let the right kind of life as a
[14:02] Christian supposed to live so for next
[14:06] Sunday you guys won't be seeing us so
