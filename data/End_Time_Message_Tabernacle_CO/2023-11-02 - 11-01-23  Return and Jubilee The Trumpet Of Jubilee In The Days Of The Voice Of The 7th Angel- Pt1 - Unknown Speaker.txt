going to take Leviticus in Old Testament lus chapter 25 verse 8 to3 and we read Malachi 4 as well 5 and six and then the third we read John chapter 8 30-36 and Revelation 10 verse 10 s lus 25 read in the name of the Lord and thou shall number seven Sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven Sabbath of years shall be unto the 49 years [Music] then shall thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land if [Music] amen and you shall H the 50th year

shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase their off out of the field in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession may you sit down we're going to keep reading we see it Mali ch 4 verse five and [Music] six behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the [Music] Lord and he shall turn to of the father to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse let's John chapter [Music] 8 verse 30 to 36 as he SP this words many believe on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believe on him ye continue in my words then are ye my disciple indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free [Music] they answer him we we be Abram seed and we never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made amen Jesus answered them very the very I say unto you whosoever commit of sin sin is the servant of sin amen and the servant abideth not in the house of of forever but the son abideth [Music] ever amen if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen [Music] amen now let's take Revelation 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet amen may God Jesus Christ bless his word my beloved brothers and sisters tonight I've taken a message from the prophet I've been inspired to this message that he preached November 22nd 1962 and he titled that message the return and Jubilee and in that message and I took a subject I took it I want to talk about the Jubilee trumpet on the day of the seven the voice of the Seven Angels amen amen the Jubilee trumpet on the day of the seven Angel and the the trumpet in this end time today the Jubilee trumpet sounded amen do you believe that we live in the end time we live in the day of the voice of the seven Angel we have read in Revelation 10 verse 7 where it was written that in the days of the Seven Angels sound the trumpet when he will sound the trumpet the mystery of God will be fulfilled as he has declared to his servant the prophet we are living in that time we are living in the days of the voice of the seven angels we are in the last days amen when God has Sent His prophets with a message the prophet sounded the and he gave us this message amen amen amen amen and he gave us a great Revival brother Bram started a great Revival it's the Revival of the Bride amen amen amen amen while sounding the Jubilee trumpet the mystery of God has been fulfilled or complet when he was sounding that trumpet you know tunders were being heard amen the voice of God in this last days amen amen amen and that was a great Jubilee amen amen amen amen amen now to really well grasped it [Music] I refer to what happened in the Old Testament here the brother say Israel was a type of the church amen he's considering Israel as a symbol as a type I'm just going to read it directly just listen to what the prophet say in the message the return and Jubilee He says this paragraph 16 1962 he says this now we take Israel as a type or the symbol because it is a time of Jubilee a church was given a portion amen amen who is Christ himself was ped to the Holy Ghost into each heart that will receive it and become sons of God when we consider Israel as a type God has given to his people of Israel a possession a portion of land that was their inheritance that was a possession and as is he also gave to the church a possession am a portion it's Christ himself who our inheritance amen am amen amen and he says now Israel was a servant to God he was given a possession and this possession amen was not to be given to anyone else he was to beat Israel only Palestine belongs to them amen could they couldn't leave Palestine Palestine was their POS and all the promise that God has given had to be complet amen when the people of Israel were in the land in the promised land every time the children of Israel was out of the land they were backsliding am amen they were losing their inheritance but when they were finding themselves in pal that's when all the promise that God have done a promise was supposed to be fulfilled to them that's the same thing for us God has given us promis amen do you believe that we have promises that God has given promis all the promises made to the church we are rejoicing about them amen when we are in the land it's in Christ where we are rejoicing with all those promises Christ is our Christ is our inheritance chist is the promised land for a Believer amen am you have to abide in Christ so that we can have you have to abide in Christ to have life let your abide in Christ to be happy to be blessed you have to be in Christ it's ch is our inheritance it's ch our possession that's our Promised Land Hallelujah are you with me amen amen says we live in the end time today all the uh Parable all the parabs all the types in the Bible have been fulfilled or completed today do you believe that the Old Testament was a shadow of the New Testament all that Israel lived in the old test was a shadow for us the bride or the the the Church of the Living God amen amen amen it was a shadow now listen to what he says again in the message theing [Music] God message preach June 14 [Music] 1964 says paragraph 3 337 all the parabs in the Bible all the types in the Bible are manifested here in front of us amen that Year of Jubilee that God has given to the children of Israel it was the only thing only way for God to manifest his grace to Israel for Redemption every single time that children of Israel was leaving his country or land or if he will lose his land and found himself somewhere else there were one year the Year of Jubilee that was a way for everybody that lost the inheritance way another to go back to their possession to the land to The Inheritance amen amen and that Year brother says for Israel am amen it was the way of God to express his grace for restoration amen what was going on for Israel it's for as a type am amen we also have a Year of Jubilee every single time there's a Revival that was sing the year of jubile and today with the bride's Revival that's that's where God is showing us his grace to go back to our inheritance in a way or another we forget we lost our inheritance we lost our inheritance and the devil kept us and made us slaves slave of things of the world slaves of sin slaves of slaves of Wars slaves of all those things but but there the Year of Jubilee amen the gospel amen is telling us is proclaiming of our freedom the gospel itself it's the good news that telling us the good news amen amen the gospel is telling us amen the price for our sin have been paid amen amen amen amen we were condemned to death we were like Barabas you know the story of The Passion of Christ amen he was judged by the Judgment of this Earth they said that he was judged to death they let it be crucified what wrong did he do [Music] I don't see anything WR he said for us let it be crucified and pilot said then I will find a murderer it was Barabas amen a murderer someone who did wrong he presented and people there the Jew were was to choose who they wanted to be freed and everybody cried out shut out they said may you free Barabas and crucify Jesus Christ amen what they were talking about they were fulfilling the word of God they were fulfilling the will of God Barabas was kept uh slaves for for a little bit he was judged by the justice of this world and he was condemned to death for his freedom someone had to take his place amen Jesus Christ the man of Galilee he didn't do anything wrong he came to take the Barabas place and today we are like Barabas a way or another we are kept in the prison somewhere of the things of the world the love of the things of the world worries of this Earth of everything for sickness that's your prison today but Jesus the good news the gospel is telling you one man came to take your place it's not anybody else it's the Lamb of God oh we take the sin of the world the the man of Gile Jesus of Nazareth took your place he came and took your place he's been condemned to your place your curse Came Upon him your slavery came to him and that day baras was freed and Jesus was

hand we believe that Jesus Christ is here Jesus Christ is alive Jesus is real he is here he's manifesting or proving his word amen amen amen and he says he's here manifesting it showing just exactly what it was interpreting right back and to make and to make it sure that it's the interpretation 341 he says I'm talking about Revelation that he is supposed to do that's what it is but now as Revelation 10 is revealed the mysteries of God is made manifest known as the seven seal book promised am am am amen amen it was also a mystery Jubilee it was a symbol it was a law in Israel when the children of Israel when the child of Israel could lose his his inheritance that was given to him by God and that and their inheritance was going generation to generation someone could lose his init but they had the law they had the law they had the law am amen it's jubile the Year of Jubilee when the high priest was coming out with the trumpet of Jubilee and he was s in the trumpets all the children of Israel when he will hear that sound the sounding of the trumpet he said oh it's the Year of Jubilee I am free I am living I'm living slavery I am going amen amen it was Liberty but today

those who love him am and those who have been called to and everything that happen to you if you're a Son of God you are an elected of God it's for your good everything works together for those who love God am amen hallelujah there's nothing coming in toward God God has a plan for you God has a plan for each one of you we are born with a purpose and we have to fulfill God's purpose amen amen amen amen amen amen amen we see in the Bible I can give an example the example of Joseph one of the patri one of the the son of Jacob he was loved by his father Jacob but he was hated by his he was by jousy because he was spiritual he had dreams spiritual dreams one day you saw in the TR they had the shav there 12 sheep they were bowing towards one and his brother they had interpretation do you mean that we have to bow down to you and then and they did everything to uh eliminate so that that dream will not being fulfilled brother and sister there's no there is nothing that can stop the plan of God in your life nothing hallelujah amen praise God we are sons of God God explained any everything for us plans and not of words God want us to be happy God want us to prosper God want us to be in good health God want us to be happy we be joyful he gave us the joy of Salvation that's what God wants but the devil come with all the Greeks with all the world he comes to to S today I want to t you you are Son of God you are daughter of God you you you inance it's Christ who your inheritance go in Christ go out from the world and go in Christ and Joseph he could tell himself how come my brother don't love they could have been even SI they tried to take to get get rid of they tried to kill him finally they say you know what let's let's just sell him they sold him to a man and he found himself in P house and and when he went in and all the business of P was going for huah amen and was a son of prosperity and brother say Joseph is the perfect type of Jesus Christ everywhere Jesus is there's Prosperity there's blessing Hallelujah there's joy there's peace you have to receive Jesus and you will be happy and Joseph going all his businesses was going forward and one day his wife last after him and Joseph had a good position in the house of and he was governing all his he was he was a governor he was a manager and his wife last after him he wanted to commit adultery and Joseph said no I don't want to do that I am an elected of God as he was prospering says Prosperity usually we take a man away from his God Amen let's be like Joseph even though he has that position if he [Music] accept maybe he could have received some from P for wife but but he he would have said his God he said no I am an El I am Jew I'm an Israelite I cannot do it even though he was very far he was in his he wasay in another land but he kept theth he kept the word he respected the law of God my brother and sister wherever you go if you're Son of God elected of God you have an inheritance God knows you you are in God's hands amen amen am Hallelujah don't compromise amen don't compromise ever and when he refused that wife uh really stting shouting oh he wanted to rap me that's how Joseph was arrested and he found himself in prison he was innocent but he was in prison just put yourself in Joseph's place he didn't know anything his brother hated him and he found himself in prison without doing anything wrong he was in prison just put yourself in this place what could he been said himself to himself God I'm honoring you do you know my don't you know my situation God God knew his [Music] situation he was fulfilling his plan because if Joseph didn't go to prison he could not go out and become a great person in Egypt he had to go in Reon my brother my sister your situation is under control if you Son of God your situation is under control amen and he found himself in prison am amen amen amen amen he had a dream and he always had dreams hallelujah amen and one of pharaoh was the other one was killed according to the interpretation of Joseph he even told to the one that was to be fre when you will be next to pharoh may you talk to him about me I am innocent he went as it was not the plan of the time of God yes he forgot he forgot you go and do all the things asking for jobs you want to become this and that sometime it doesn't work good news for you don't be afraid if you're Son of God your situation is under control Hallelujah the time we come when pharoh had a dream it troubled him and the one that in prison there's an isra who can uh interpret your dream hallelujah amen they brought him up and interpreted the all those seven that was eating those fat grass cows he said we have seven uh years of famine you say you have to to make provision and then he was placed in that position it was a plan of God God told Abraham amen am amen amen amen when he called Abraham the prophet said the call of Abraham it's the type of the calling of each as God called Abraham that's the same way he's calling you that's the same way he called me said get out of that people and Abraham said he said go out this land of your land of the House of your father to the land that will show you Abraham was moving he saw his father he took his nephew but God told him to separate him says Abraham was not blessed as he was still with L he had to separate himself to be blessed to go in Christ we have to separate with the things of the world we have to separate separate with unbelief to all that's against the word amen hallelujah amen hallelujah says in Redemption there's always two parts you have to get out off to go in go out from to go in Holiness you go of unbelief to go into Faith you go out of the world to go in Christ amen hallelujah that's where going Rejoice to all the promises of God do you believe that all the promises of God of the Bible is ours every verse every chapter every book everything in the the Bible it's for the believer every promise that God has made it's for the believer to Rejoice on you have to go back to inheritance you have to go in Christ it's the the land of promise amen amen am amen and then you saw when God called Abraham he came amen he had to separate himself completely and when he separate himself God blessed them and God gave him a promise promise of the the promised son Isaac the the promised son amen amen he also told him I will give you a larger posterity amen amen and your posterity will to a where they they will be in in in the in bondage after 400 years with my mighty hand I will deliver them that word was supposed to be fulfilled you see the plan of God that was God's plan but to be fulfilled had to go to all those things so that he can go to Israel amen there famine everywhere amen amen Jacob to go and and you know all the story that's how Israel founds in Egypt amen amen it's to tell you if you are a son of God a son or daughter of God you are born with a purpose your life is in God's hands your situation is under his control fear not don't ever fear don't ever voice go out of sin of the darkness of things of the world and go in Christ that's our inheritance but now he's telling us a lot of people today they are slaves slave of things of the world amen amen amen amen and then he says return and Jubilee where I was reading and he says this paragraph 20 in in the middle and during that Jubilee Every Man Who Lost His inherit if he was born free and it was Israel born whoever had that inheritance he had to go back to him freely amen he had to pay nothing he didn't have to do anything but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inance say Oh Oh my he had the right to it it was a god-given right amen am amen because by Grace had inherited it and also it's by Grace it's not by our Merit it's by Grace am God knew us before the foundation of the world and elected us before the foundation of the world and call us to he gave us this because we are elected can you realize this we were growing up with with friends and family in the family many people believe in this message realize the grace of God for you amen amen just few what did you do what did you pay what did you do are you more holy no it's only by his grace because he known he has known us before the foundation and elected us before the foundation of the world it's by his grace amen amen amen amen amen amen amen and then he say oh he had the right to it it was a right given by God in him by Grace he had inherited it it' be given to his father and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost If he if he lost this amen it must go free Hallelujah meant Grace is way provided for each individual to turn to the rightful inheritance it's by Grace amen amen now what a picture it gives it gives us tonight of the church in his last day in this last days you see what man can do and then you see what God does What man does is failing and will fail fell and always will fa but what God has done is eternal it's a the Jubilee it's a way for God to express to his people amen amen amen amen his grace his restoration he wanted to express his grace for restoration it was the law of God says what God does is eternal amen am God Amen am amen what go what a man does but what God does is eternal amen amen it's God who give it it his free gift am amen am amen amen [Music] amen amen and Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for [Applause] restoring or be brought back to the rightful position amen amen oh my beloved brother and sister today if you have to put it

the trumpet of Jubilee so that every one of us can go out [Music] freely we have to be free of what uh what putting on in slavery God didn't create to be in bondage amen amen and the Jew told Jesus we have never been slaves how do you say that we are going to be free he said whoever give himself to sin is a slave to sin whatever is taking Dominion you maybe it's hunger it's a demon of anger
