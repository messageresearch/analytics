[8:32] while you're still standing
[8:35] verse one
[9:07] says that when we read the word of god
[9:10] national it's like the national anthem

[11:24] you may be seated i'll greet you on your
[11:26] next
[11:29] thank you dear pastor for the
[11:30] opportunity
[11:33] and i'm happy that
[11:36] to be among you
[11:40] not just to stand before you
[11:44] but to fellowship with you
[11:49] to have a little bit of a talk with you
[11:53] you know i had to travel today
[11:58] when the pastor asked me to bring the
[12:00] word of god
[12:03] into my heart
[12:08] if the lord has touched the pastor's
[12:10] heart
[12:14] regardless of where i was invited for
[12:16] some purpose
[12:18] i would rather stay home
[12:35] where we will be
[13:04] if i don't have anything that can help
[13:05] the people of baskets
[13:07] in grand responsibility because it is a
[13:10] great responsibility
[13:14] if the pastors put out his stress on us
[13:18] to bring the word of god
[13:22] by god's grace we cannot misuse that
[13:24] stress
[13:26] that's the deal and by god's grace
[13:30] i like every time that i stand here may
[13:32] god
[14:01] you know you can do it that way for the
[14:03] interest for the child
[14:06] you have to know that that child is
[14:08] wrong
[14:09] one day they will grow like you
[14:12] would have been foreign
[14:30] you know remember
[14:34] you know the child even being still in
[14:35] the mother's womb
[14:39] that this child still has senses in him
[14:55] the same blessing that you're receiving
[15:09] we have to be as much serious as
[15:11] possible
[15:13] very serious
[15:17] it's a life of death
[15:19] you know
[15:21] god is god
[15:24] and he remains
[15:52] david as a human being
[15:55] and you saw what a god did against him
[15:58] correct he said that's not correct
[16:04] i didn't do anything
[16:20] right on the spot
[16:23] the book is since i read that scripture
[16:29] i don't
[16:30] compromise with the word of god
[16:32] regarding
[16:34] luke moses
[17:01] he forgot what god had asked him
[17:05] instead of going to talk to the rocks
[17:09] he went and smote the rock
[17:11] hey do you have to comment yeah
[17:14] god said that since you disobeyed
[17:51] [Applause]
[17:58] and if it's the word of
[18:27] do nowhere in the time of noah
[18:30] is the time of moses
[18:34] history always repeats itself
[18:39] and um
[18:49] [Music]
[18:54] magic
[18:56] in other words the story of life
[19:00] apocalypse
[19:01] you read from genesis
[19:05] and you don't see jesus in the word of
[19:07] god in every scripture he said that
[19:10] you've read it wrong

[20:33] of a bearing place with you that i may

[21:11] a sepulcher but thou mayest bury thy
[21:21] and abraham stood up and bowed himself
[21:24] to the people of the land even unto the
[21:26] children of heaven
[21:28] see
[21:43] a and he communed with them saying if it
[21:46] be your mind that i should bury my dad
[21:49] out of my sight hear me and in threat
[21:52] for me to affront the son of zor di

[24:43] unto abraham for a possession in the
[24:46] presence of the children of
[24:49] before
[24:50] all that went into the gate of his city
[25:03] and after this abraham buried sarah his
[25:05] wife in the cave of the field of matpela
[25:08] before mom read the same is abraham in

[25:23] that is therein were made to show unto
[25:26] abraham for a possession of a bearing
[25:28] place by the sons of health
[25:33] let's pray once again
[25:39] you are the god of all revelations
[25:43] if you could give abraham the revelation
[25:47] but not to bury abraham every year

[27:23] demanded abram the sons of heaven has to
[27:26] embrace
[27:27] to bury sarah anywhere
[27:30] in the land about my dinner
[27:44] and they brought abraham to the sons of

[38:18] point
[38:20] the time had come in
[38:22] for a break one time the evil children
[38:26] when they were carried over in babylon
[38:29] listen let a tiffany
[38:43] where we have to stand for what is right

[40:16] make you sicker when you prepared for
[40:19] fair work
[40:21] what experience
[40:23] make you think you've lost your
[40:24] experience with god sasela picked the
[40:27] shows that's the worst thing
[40:31] that a christian can do
[40:34] is to let they just say quack
[40:39] to let you all know that uh you've lost
[40:41] your experience with god now let's
[40:43] james spirit comes up don't ever let the
[40:46] devil inspire you that way
[40:50] you know david puts you a goal yet david
[40:53] to keep goliath
[40:57] experience personally he had to lean
[40:59] upon his personal experience

[41:21] kill this man
[41:24] and listen to what to the good thing
[41:26] david did he love poseidon

[42:31] and david got today before the kingdom
[42:36] david said but you were a child before
[42:37] this

[1:10:42] disciple amen
[1:10:47] the 13th disciple of jesus christ joseph
[1:10:50] jesus joseph
[1:10:54] tonight you can also be joseph for
[1:10:56] foreign

[1:13:46] journey
[1:13:47] please deliver in a higher dimension
[1:13:55] only the lord jesus christ had to go
[1:13:56] there
[1:13:57] because a man of flesh by the sun could
[1:14:00] not go in there
[1:14:02] gabriel could not be bothered
[1:14:04] michael could not go down
[1:14:07] angel could be god
[1:14:09] only jesus christ
[1:14:11] that's why when they came down
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:15:22] that's the reason why
[1:15:24] the only person that could hear his
[1:15:26] voice
[1:15:27] it was only lazarus
[1:15:29] when jesus christ
[1:15:31] he didn't call everybody
[1:15:35] no i'm not talking about the
[1:15:36] resurrection of jesus
[1:15:39] hey send a genuine amendment only god
[1:15:41] himself
[1:15:45] call lazarus
[1:15:47] by his name
[1:15:49] the same god
[1:16:04] god
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:46] that's
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:12] is the lord jesus christ
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:57] he comes all right
[1:17:59] when you always say
[1:18:02] when nobody can help you kill the person
[1:18:04] in the people when nobody can help you
[1:18:06] will happen at that time
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:52] that jesus christ was still working
[1:18:57] what is something is taking place
[1:18:59] they're in heaven
[1:19:01] something is also taking place
[1:19:04] for jesus christ
[1:19:32] his body
[1:19:48] because they were fighting for the body
[1:19:49] of god oh god mikhail happily called
[1:19:52] them therefore when michael took the
[1:19:54] body of the lord
[1:19:56] he went to hide it into the ring
[1:19:59] the type of jesus christ the lord of
[1:20:01] lords
[1:20:30] the body of
[1:20:44] the only person
