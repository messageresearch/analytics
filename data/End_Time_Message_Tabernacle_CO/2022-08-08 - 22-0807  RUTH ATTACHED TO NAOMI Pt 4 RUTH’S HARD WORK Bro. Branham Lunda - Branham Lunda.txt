meetings and then i went for the youth meeting in uh france even herself with all the visits we had it was a lot of stress amen i think it's also good thing as we grow old to take really vacation you depend on the vermouth of accounts not really time off just the time off from work is okay but sometimes we take off we are busy with other things maybe i don't know but i think a real vacation where you relax yourself it's very very important i will really encourage people from time to time for your own benefit to take vacation time for yourselves amen amen and also from time to time do a physical checkup with your doctor the thousand thousand fed this examiner physical doctor when i came back from congo i the first thing is to schedule an appointment with the doctor to check you to do the basic things because you don't realize even the preaching work how much pressure that is you see a preacher standing on the platform predicated you don't know what he has been doing during the week and even the night before he come here um so before we bring our brother brandon lunda to the platform i think i asked the people to read the book of ruth right so we are going to check out a little bit here those who have read and those who did not how many chapters we have in the book of ruth brother no way come away brother bring the microphone when they do a teaching it's very very important the preacher as usually will not finish all the aspects if you read you will take more and when he is speaking you will read between the lines brother no way how many parts we have in the book of roots how many chapters come here look at me don't look at it i have a issue with my eyes do you also have a problem with your ears so listen now okay like most of the questions if people miss it will come to you because you are rooted how many parts brother branham has explained to us about uh oh thank you they raised the boat and i'll see your name if i say later how many parts you should sister lucoccolo coco showing that i will start with the hardest question i mean she was in the land of moab tell them and they returned back to bethlehem with naomi [Music] with naomi naomi and the people looking at naomi thank you musician you can be there so that i can see also part of the questions and the people say oh is this naomi naomi [Music] don't call me naomi but call me no no no

sister jenny don't call me naomi but call me more [Music] that's in the bible uh who to chapter 1 verse 20. and what does matter mean what does matter mean brother john what is maraming thank you merci she said i went with my family my family to the land of moab but now i'm returning no husband no son and she said unto them call me not naomi pele me for the almighty has dealt very brutally with me i think now you are going to read the book right nearly live in the spa amen amen what is the meaning of naomi naomi means what a significant naomi christina christina what does naomi means when they give you a name you have to go see the open and say what why did you give me the name of naomi significance [Music] spend time and time to ex to preach those things and read here at least a lie you cannot assist the patient redeem yourself okay okay about uh the other one was naomi and what was the uh naomi's husband oh who does her no naomi husbands israel israel what was the husband of naomi they know me rashel yes sister rachel where is her rachel [Music] means sister melissa so melissa sunday is good for the adult this is the patience the self-esteem huh adoration so naomi and the husband was a pleasant worshiper hello right i know me emily marise what was the name of the boys they called nondegasson sister grace uh gracia sir gracia i think there was milk [Music] the second one was julia julia huh who was the husband of the first husband of route between the two premier marianne holliday yes about the junior virginia and what does the the name mean brother patrick patrick brother john okay okay now and no i mean what is the meaning of ruth it's significant yes way chickener check you know don't don't blame the child she's part of this what is the meaning of fruit guess where it's ready i like that courage what is the meaning of ruth who means what root vedi the hardest question for sisterhood compassionate thank you god bless you uh the translation say the translation said root means female friend compassion why do they call root the moabitess because it is more british why if you heard that they call her the morbidities right why they call her morbidities we scale a bit too because she lives well because uh originally she was not from uh the jewish she was not from israel she was from uh from moab is uh thank you like a foreign yeah because the family of elimelech and naomi who are the jew they left jew is a palestine because they did not have food bread and they went to the land of moab and this is what they found so the family was a family a jews family right amen allah for me for me and they had the children in the land of moab he's only the founder of the moab and the two boys chilean and uh maryland and my lord who did they marry did they marry women from their home country or they marry the woman from moab a bit frank frank so now we are talking about moab more and more who can tell me where moab came from sister play [Music] oh no i sure you should know everybody no no no no no no no that's not my my listen with this only thank you is [Music] thank you pastor um i think that um when lotto left um they left he left him i love him oh so if you can understand the reason i'm asking this because the book of roots is a big book of redemption [Music] you cannot understand the full story of redemption without understanding what god did in the life of roots and you know every time they talk about women in the bible it's talking about church we talked about opera what does open represent which kind sister christina if you can remember yourself are you here crazy okay okay what does your sister patience what's your passions yeah she was a backslide but is it um the bride that's question no no don't ask a question if you are not asked representing the bride representative so she represents which kind of church will represent a gentiles that's very important and hoot both represent gentile churches no no opera and the hood they represent the gentile church one is a lukewarm church which is backslide which is oppa and a tiered represent and the other one root which represents the gentle church of the bride so in other words when you look at the book of root the book of good is the book of the bride so this is a great mystery hello mistake this would say read she came from a shameful family a venue for me on tours because when you know the story of lot because of the lord lord was separated with abraham lord abraham and when they have to leave sodom and gomorrah can they recognize they told gulot and his wife not to look back only a lot esa from the paris garden and they were running to a certain extent lord's wife formed a lot so therefore lord did not longer have a wife a lord lord never play the farm is that correct without a wife a lot of sons in the family lot was going to the land of zoa hello with his two daughters and they wanted to know everybody connected to the moon but the lord said hello today i have two daughters who never knew men but don't touch the angels i learned to i can offer you these two daughters but the inhabitants of sodom they refused elizabeth when the angel told the lord to go out with his two daughter plus his wife so lot went with his two daughters where we are going there is no brother there are no men to help us have children who knows that what is um for the only man we have here the son um he's not going to accept to sleep with us he never accepted the new pond therefore don't let us give him wine a lot of faith only what you thought and they gave their dad wine dad drunk papaya and at night the oldest daughter went to sleep with her dad and the next day she told her younger sister you too go sleep with daddy today and they gave again daddy wine called and the daddy slept a papaya satan with the youngest avec laplacian so therefore donkey the two daughters of lord they defeated the lord they became a pregnant from their father and santa are you listening to the story so the eldest hello deliver the first child and they named the child moab hello owned and the second daughter has another child they call him ben annie omni or something like that which is the origin of the ammonite bride we came from a very shameful background we have no merit but the work of redemption has provided a way for roots from the ridiculous to the sublime to the sibling to be the wife of the boys and from that relationship [Music] is coming from the descendant of root the more batista i will give you the scripture if you want to take genesis chapter 19. from verse 30 to verse 38. you will read the story of how the children listen foreign uh went and gave wine to their father somebody donated this is to tell you wine is not a good thing don't you drink because you will do things that you may never thought show me genesis 19 verse 30. hunter if the usher can give the mic to our brother lord went out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and he and his two daughters with him next verse and the first one said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come into us after the manner of all the earth latte come let us make our father drink wine and we will lay with him that we may preserve seed of our father not repairing you can read the rest of the verse i'm skipping that's where both the daughters of lord with the child by their father philip defeat the lord to consider the lord paige you see that's the bible and the first born to bear his son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day when they called hoot the moabites but regardless of what the name was [Music] he said when hoot made her decision she did not expect to receive any reward what about you and i connected with a decision in and out not a stable decision a vacuum decision balance my prime decision stable when you even know that there is a great reward waiting for you yes i think we will continue to do sunday school for the welcome back to the fair they called the dimanche police you make sure that you read the book of good that's whatever they learn because there are more questions in storage [Music] shine all around oh he says oh light jesus life and mercy [Music] we [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] heaven wearing jesus the light of the world we walk away walking [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] come [Music] [Music] and [Music] day [Music] come where the two drops of mercy are bright [Music] jesus the light of the world [Music] may god bless you good job may god bless you [Music] for the privilege that you give us to be in good health fully privileged for the privilege to be in thy presence our presence because we know that in thy presence we can receive the strength coming from a problem solution to our problem that's why the lord jesus christ like ruth had defeated boaz here we are this morning come and use us [Music] and himself may speak [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen amen we're going to read the word of god while we're standing and we are in ruth chapter 2 discover one to nine and naomi had a kinsmen of her husband a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz and ruth the muabaitis they said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean here is of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was too light on on a part of the field belonging onto boaz who was at the kindred of mahali malek and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord blessed thee then i said boaz unto the servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitess damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gathered after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and have continued even from the morning until now that she carried a little in the in the house then said boaz unto ruth he rest doubt not my daughter good not to glean in another field neither go from hands but abide here faster by my maidens nine let thine irons bees be on the field that they do reap and go down after them i have if i not charge start the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art our thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn amen amen we're going to save time you may be seated and i greet you all in the name of jesus christ salvation where i greet your brother eddie lucas god bless you god i think as if the pastor the question that he asked a old man is still a grown man amen amen and then i wondered what should we say again this morning even myself when he was asking questions i was wondering myself or what would have been scared but i think that but i think that he since he's a teacher i think that you know the foundation was laid down come over scientifically how do you fulfill with those questions as the pastor recommended us to read the book of ruth it's for our god it's for the good understanding basque on paper for two days because at times we cannot say all things too long possible from every angle i did since the pastor said it can vomit when you read yourself and when the preacher will go you are enlightened amen i think that all these questions that we asked are to come back i think that this time is clear amen amen i believe that everybody have the understanding of what the name of ruth means eliminations and so on now to save us time no some da notre days and now we are on our second part of ruth nozavon complete we understood the ruth tipifi leglis types the church or part epiphyosileglys all paratypes also the church both ruth and oppa the typical eglise de gente types the gentile church melle seleglis retrograde but one is the box of lighting churches and the other one is the bride america random or you're meditating you read the english church thank you eglise church eglise church you see iglesias a a church with uh uppercase grand amazing skill with uppercases with uppercases with a lowercase c significant of the bride amen amen this is uh the bride essa and this denomination that speaks of the church as a denomination when the church begins with a lowercase c denomination that's a church as a denomination a congregation or just as a guy by the church beginning with an uppercase when these things are very well precise hello opa oppa seto philip leglis and if we say that we in this tabernacle anti-message we're not going to say that etm is the the uppercase siege as a church nomination but instead it is the gathering as with a lowercase set congregation but in that gathering the church there is the uppercase church tabernacle in this tabernacle etm le petit there's a small city who believes that he is the the church here amen amen oh dear quacking gliese who believed that he is the church oh somebody because if you confess that you are the brother the church the more confessor the more you confess your mind your everything to obey to us if you confess that you are the bride member they already even if you have your happens now uh even if you haven't gotten to adoption please fully quiet the more you believe it the more you please fully confess it the more you confess the god will do that for you to become that's god's law amen amen represent retrograde represent the bachelorette and ruth that represents the church as the pastor just explained it well why only ruth that came from a that he just foreign every set person sometimes they say and this person coming of that message becomes even the great parent of jesus amen amen amen satan said the pharmacy so they said gastrula hey this woman coming out of this mess i've always wondered jaipas have it i think of ruth jay pass i think of rahab the possition a well-known prostitute darling in the world oh probably like you know that one will never make it to hell [Music] you do not know what god will do with them set a fear this girl prostitute and prostitute but one day he lay definitely eloc she became herself in the family that's why i believe that this morning jesse christ jesus christ element and these people coming from this mess yes god will take them people they can be people that can be counted they cannot restore their writ just like our story with russia legalize the jaunty that types are the gentiles church regardless but look at this plane of redemption no never noti are written but we have to type ourselves to ruth comey new as us we are not jews personally he loves video suppression he's so in his full knowledge he loves me he is so commensational zwift even if i am not from the jewish people but he starts with even if you're not from the jews [Applause] and all kinds of things but god takes us commerce like ruth eleven zamene wants to bring us our redemption to redemption adoption wants to get us to adulthood family no way we can become the bride of jesus christ amen you cannot put your destiny so we can become share this a share the flesh of his flesh falsely bones of his bones we cannot push your destiny so we may become parallel the supper the word of his word it is grace hallelujah hallelujah that's why i love jesus he loved us well we didn't seek him forever that's why brother says i'll tell it's the is of sin that came first pastor of allah because before the foundation of the world in god's mind god already found the solution for sin amen rich ruth jelly paddy garcia god takes him from the mess pass a grass by his grace great deceit the ruth decides great decision [Applause] on le trav li the hard work of rape [Music] amen amen the second step the truth is affair i'm taking my time here may
