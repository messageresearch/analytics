[19:02] amen
[19:04] and i want also to thank you for
[19:07] your prayers
[19:21] meeting on finances
[19:26] and uh i think uh your prayer really
[19:30] did support us because it was not very
[19:33] easy
[19:36] to
[19:39] yeah
[19:42] i think one of the tape
[19:45] i played it here last uh
[19:49] last sunday
[19:59] but
[20:00] i think they did cut it off where i did
[20:04] not ask to cut off
[20:10] and uh
[20:12] if a brother you can project the last
[20:15] portion of the
[20:17] service when a pastor neville was
[20:20] speaking
[20:23] [Music]
[20:28] because just after when i finished to
[20:30] preach probably this is where they cut
[20:32] it off better
[20:35] man
[20:38] i want just a two minute from our pastor
[20:40] neville to hear his comment what he said
[20:48] he is the one who
[20:50] asked that those tape not to be made
[20:53] public
[20:54] this
[21:01] go is
[21:02] god bless
[21:04] [Music]
[21:05] [Applause]
[21:42] you know the
[21:56] as children of god they come up from the
[21:58] jail we must be also the head
[22:03] because the bride and the bridegroom are
[22:05] one basketball
[22:13] let's take advantage of this time let's
[22:15] see
[22:20] let's spend some time before god
[22:22] assuming
[22:53] on youtube
[22:57] you know i was thinking
[23:04] lord what's going on with us in this
[23:05] message then you're questioning about my
[23:07] recommendation
[23:10] i can read brady right now to pay you
[23:12] forward now
[23:14] oh that brother i didn't know god has
[23:16] blessed him so much
[23:20] benitez
[23:29] when he was talking about the
[23:30] intelligence that was just the first
[23:32] meeting
[23:34] the palestinian
[23:37] and i think we played the second service
[23:40] last wednesday
[23:47] yeah i did ask him that i want to place
[23:50] those tape also
[23:52] at our congregation
[23:58] and
[23:59] we agree that
[24:01] as soon as we play them in some mountain
[24:04] uk or she talking
[24:05] laser bonjour
[24:07] to keep them private they delegate
[24:13] the bottom line i want to highlight here
[24:15] is
[24:30] he told me you never said certain things
[24:32] in our church in my decade
[24:36] the certain shows are not regressive
[24:39] it's true some of the concepts i never
[24:41] mentioned them it's a very question the
[24:43] concept
[24:45] but as you will see the rest of the
[24:48] services over there
[24:54] i spoke on uh
[24:56] entrepreneurship
[24:58] japanese which is very very important
[25:02] yeah very much important and i also
[25:05] spoke on many concepts of taxation
[25:10] concept
[25:12] attacks
[25:13] uh
[25:14] because most of the people in america
[25:18] basketball could join america they
[25:20] complain always that would they pay a
[25:23] lot of taxes which is true he'll say
[25:25] completely
[25:38] but another category of people
[25:41] not a categorization they don't pay
[25:43] taxes in a paper the taxes and uh one of
[25:46] the big concepts i developed over there
[25:49] throughout the remaining of the meetings
[25:53] developed
[26:04] to show you that most of the
[26:06] entrepreneurs they don't pay taxes over
[26:12] why
[26:14] i saw some of i used the
[26:17] red
[26:18] mark but it was not coming clear let me
[26:21] try this
[26:22] dizzy this was the biggest concept
[26:26] that's a daily program concept
[26:33] i developed is
[26:38] they are the first category
[26:40] is
[26:41] the premier category is the w two people
[26:44] say something
[26:49] the first the first box in the premiere
[26:52] what people are struggling they don't
[26:55] make enough with their w-2 jeans
[27:02] but here you see people are making still
[27:05] receiving w2
[27:10] but man
[27:12] they make enough
[27:14] i said that they make enough money for
[27:16] that but here they don't make enough
[27:18] money the got to rename it
[27:20] but this category here
[27:24] the best the biggest concept i developed
[27:27] was w-2 people the premier league
[27:30] playground
[27:32] junkie
[27:41] most of them they receive a schedule
[27:43] which they call schedule k1 a la prepar
[27:46] day
[27:56] when they pay you then you can
[27:59] pay they deduct always social security
[28:02] it is unless joe larson de la security
[28:05] social they deduct medicare he's on
[28:07] level our sunday medicare social
[28:09] security is six point two percent social
[28:12] security support some point
[28:19] up to a certain maximum uh up how much
[28:23] is this maximum
[28:24] of us equally maximum day
[28:28] oh but you do a lot of payroll
[28:31] i think it's up to 137
[28:35] or 140 000.
[28:41] when you reach this they don't deduct
[28:44] 6.2 percent anymore calvo touches
[28:49] 6.
[28:50] security social but the average salary
[28:53] is not 100 000. it's uh
[28:56] nationwide it's about 60 000.
[29:05] and the medicare they deduct 145 percent
[29:08] medicare is a lever and
[29:10] [Music]
[29:12] which becomes six point
[29:15] six
[29:16] seven oh
[29:18] seven point sixty five second
[29:22] set for some point
[29:24] and the employer has to match it
[29:30] that means we contribute
[29:32] 15.3 percent everyone of the w to people
[29:36] to pay social security
[29:50] [Music]
[29:52] this one is somebody who work eight to
[29:54] five
[29:59] regular job
[30:01] here you are maybe in the management
[30:03] function you make a little bit more but
[30:05] you are still on w-2 w2
[30:09] management
[30:10] here you have a little business it seems
[30:13] available
[30:15] affair but here is the box of people who
[30:18] invest
[30:19] they see sesame
[30:21] investigation the investors the son is
[30:24] investigating i can give you a simple
[30:25] example
[30:27] you have money
[30:29] let's say you buy a complex building it
[30:32] was a stay in complex department maybe
[30:36] hundred or two hundred apartment people
[30:39] are hunting
[30:44] you have used your money or you have
[30:46] borrowed somebody's money to invest uh
[31:02] that money that is coming to you
[31:05] there is no w-2 in your body
[31:09] is that clear yes
[31:11] there is no w-2 yeah
[31:14] many many people yeah
[31:16] who are
[31:25] they don't pay social security they pay
[31:27] palace secretaries they don't pay
[31:29] medicare pay by medicare because people
[31:32] complain all the time or they deduct a
[31:34] lot of taxes
[31:35] they just complain to your company
[31:38] when you file your income tax return
[31:40] they refund you the federal withholding
[31:43] a gun who will
[32:13] the
[32:15] disability and you are also funding the
[32:18] people who don't have medical insurance
[32:21] evolution
[32:23] on parliament medical this is the
[32:25] logical that's a logic so my point as i
[32:29] preach over there
[32:33] was trying to tell the people to move
[32:35] from this w-2s
[32:40] to come
[32:43] this is where trump is
[32:45] a trump
[32:47] and people say if trump doesn't pay
[32:48] enough taxes malaysian just get trump
[32:50] they pay publicly tax those people they
[32:53] have financial advisors is on the
[32:56] channel they can say they finance they
[32:58] tell them what to do
[33:00] this is the security affair to minimize
[33:03] their taxes
[33:06] so my ideal was money
[33:09] who are making the law to help those
[33:13] people on w2
[33:19] they are the people who are here say
[33:21] something is only business
[33:30] so therefore hello this concept of w-2
[33:34] will never die it's a concept of the
[33:36] dublin
[33:39] because every investor must get shark
[33:41] investors when they invest
[33:43] they have to find some employees
[33:49] in order for you to move from this
[33:51] category to come here
[33:55] [Music]
[33:57] it takes a big intelligence
[34:01] intelligence
[34:05] it's not the only form of income
[34:07] exempted from social security and
[34:09] medicare
[34:13] exempted a social security medicare for
[34:16] example you have a little money on your
[34:18] saving for example
[34:22] at the end of the year they give you a
[34:24] form called 1099.
[34:30] this
[34:32] interest
[34:33] rate that interest you finally to pay
[34:36] taxes on the interest
[34:40] there is no social security deduction
[34:43] right in your parlor deductions
[34:46] there is no
[34:51] same thing with your 1099 div
[34:55] for dividend you receive
[34:59] dividends same thing for your 1099-b
[35:05] this is for the brokerage account
[35:12] the commission account not really when
[35:14] you trade the stock you trade bitcoin
[35:17] you trade money that's a public junkie
[35:19] from the trading the bitcoin somebody
[35:21] they buy the
[35:22] for example the japanese yen to convert
[35:25] them in american dollars this is people
[35:27] doing a lot of things they are investing
[35:29] in many kinds of categories only jenkins
[35:32] versus
[35:33] shows
[35:34] money
[35:35] so when you will listen to the probably
[35:38] the tape whenever i will have the
[35:40] opportunity to play them i don't know
[35:41] when
[35:42] you
[35:54] and those
[35:55] people in the congress they are all on
[35:57] the side they say junkies
[36:02] lawmakers are on the side
[36:05] they junkie funny
[36:07] they protect their investment with less
[36:10] taxes
[36:14] and then they pass all the taxes who is
[36:16] paying for social security it's not a
[36:18] trump it's you and i okay people are
[36:21] secretary so senator trump said
[36:24] and let me tell you with the social
[36:25] security you are paying listen
[36:29] you may die before you retire
[36:34] where is the money going
[36:36] where is the medicare money going that's
[36:39] not the medicare value
[36:43] so that was the concept that's italian
[36:45] concept
[36:47] but um
[36:48] i think we had uh several services after
[36:52] that
[37:05] yeah we don't need to stay brother happy
[37:09] with our w-2 job
[37:16] yeah you are making money working for
[37:19] somebody with like
[37:22] keep in mind i'm learning to have my own
[37:25] opportunity
[37:29] a traditional
[37:31] opportunity to be an entrepreneur
[37:34] entrepreneurship
[37:38] most of the people who are in the last
[37:40] box
[37:43] what it's not the people who went with a
[37:45] college degree
[37:48] but
[37:49] university no no maybe people who have
[37:53] college degrees
[37:57] universities most of them are here
[38:00] they're essentially business maybe a
[38:02] lawyer my says
[38:04] medical doctor my main doctor they can
[38:07] have their own practice if they have a
[38:09] valuable property they have their own
[38:11] business it's only a proper affair but
[38:13] they work maybe more hours
[38:16] to maintain them so the business owns
[38:19] them
[38:26] your business but the idea
[38:28] is even if you have a business usability
[38:31] affair every somebody you hire people to
[38:33] do it
[38:36] and you just take your k1
[38:40] this is the type of business people who
[38:44] own the business and they don't do any
[38:46] work for the business

[47:36] we just thank brother faustin for the
[47:38] opportunity to come and
[47:40] preach to god's children
[47:46] we don't take these opportunities
[47:48] lightly
[47:50] opportunity i believe all ministers can
[47:53] agree with this that it's a big burden
[47:55] on a person
[48:01] and we know that everything that we
[48:02] preach
[48:09] so we always want to be careful that we
[48:10] stay exactly with the word
[48:15] exactly with what the message says
[48:17] exactly
[48:30] they feel an urgency that if this was my
[48:32] last time to preach
[48:47] so we appreciate the opportunity to be
[48:50] here
[48:51] opportunity
[48:52] it's been a while since i've been here
[48:54] yes
[48:58] traveling around quite quite a bit yeah
[49:07] if you have your scriptures and you
[49:08] would turn with me we'll read our our uh
[49:11] scriptures from the book of daniel yes
[49:23] we'll take our text from chapter 3
[49:25] starting with verse 8.
[49:30] and it's talking about the three hebrew
[49:32] children in this scripture
[49:38] and i'll go ahead and i'll read verses
[49:40] eight through
[49:41] fifteen
[49:45] the scripture says wherefore at that
[49:48] time certain chaldeans came near and
[49:50] accused the jews
[49:51] and they spake unto the king
[49:53] nebuchadnezzar o king live forever
[49:56] thou o king has made a decree that every
[49:58] man should hear the sound of the cornet
[50:00] flu
[50:01] the harp
[50:03] the suckbutt
[50:04] sultry and dolcmer and all kinds of
[50:07] music shall fall down and worship the
[50:10] golden image
[50:11] and whoso fail it falleth not down to in
[50:14] worship
[50:15] that he shall be cast into the midst of
[50:17] the burning fiery furnace
[50:19] and there are certain jews whom thou has
[50:22] set over the affairs of the province of
[50:25] babylon
[50:26] shadrach meshach and abednego
[50:28] these men o king have not regarded thee
[50:31] they serve not thy gods nor worship the
[50:34] golden image which thou hast set up
[50:37] then
[50:38] nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[50:40] commanded to bring shadrach meshach and
[50:42] abednego
[50:43] and they brought these men before the
[50:45] king
[50:46] nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[50:49] is it true o shadrach meshach and
[50:51] abednego
[50:52] do not ye serve my gods nor worship the
[50:55] golden image which i have set up
[50:57] now if you be ready that at what time
[51:00] you hear the sound of the cornet flute
[51:03] harp suckbutt
[51:04] sultry and dokmer and all kinds of music
[51:08] ye fall down and worship the image which
[51:10] i have made
[51:12] well
[51:13] but if you worship not ye shall be cast
[51:16] the same hour into the midst of the
[51:18] burning fiery furnace
[51:20] and who is that god that should deliver
[51:22] you out of my hands
[53:41] lord we are just so thankful for that
[53:44] we just asked that you would be with
[53:46] this service
[53:49] the speaker might be able to get himself
[53:51] out of the way
[53:52] [Music]
[53:54] lord that we can hear directly from the
[53:56] throne of god this morning
[54:01] as we say many times we know that we can
[54:03] gather together
[54:08] we can fellowship one with another
[54:10] landed
[54:12] the lord if you're not here it's all in
[54:13] vain
[54:16] so lord we just ask that you would come
[54:17] down in this service right now
[54:22] that you would have full preeminence in
[54:24] the services
[54:27] lord you know the needs of the people
[54:31] we just asked that you would lead guide
[54:33] and direct us this morning
[54:40] amen amen amen you may be seated amen
[54:45] so if we were to take a
[54:47] text out of this
[54:49] scripture i believe that this
[54:51] story we all learn it in sunday school
[54:56] and texts
[55:00] it's a very amazing story
[55:04] and i believe that this story is
[55:06] specifically in the scripture
[55:09] specific modern executive not only for
[55:12] them back there
[55:15] but it's so we can look in the
[55:16] scriptures
[55:46] i don't believe that we take the
[55:47] scripture and we place it in some other
[55:48] day
[55:52] but we take the scriptures and we apply
[55:54] it to our hearts
[55:58] and that doesn't mean to have a
[55:59] pitchfork religion
[56:36] because we know the crumbs from jesus's
[56:38] table
[56:40] gave the woman the healing that she was
[56:42] looking for
[56:57] uh uh loaf of bread
[57:00] but just a crumb
[57:04] a teeny tiny piece it's just
[57:07] is enough to give you physical healing
[57:24] and that's why satan
[58:18] that john the baptist didn't eat some
[58:20] wild red pepper
[58:48] exposes who the devil is
[58:51] diablo brother branham said that there
[58:53] are two books in the bible
[58:59] more than any other book
[59:01] bible
[59:28] and we can see that it's it's
[59:30] such a a gray area
[59:35] they're trying to mix up everything
[59:41] and we had a prophet come here
[59:44] to show
[59:57] now our morals are
[1:00:40] so if i was to take a a text out of this
[1:00:43] scripture
[1:00:46] it would be knowing exactly where you
[1:00:49] stand
[1:00:53] the problem is today is we've got too
[1:00:54] many
[1:01:08] it's not
[1:01:21] i was listening to a message
[1:01:35] and it's about ready to eat
[1:02:04] but the
[1:02:17] we believe that
[1:02:40] if we take our eyes off of what the
[1:02:42] scripture says
[1:02:58] you see how when you when you get off
[1:03:00] just a little bit in the beginning
[1:03:05] by the time you get a mile down the road
[1:03:09] you're way way up
[1:03:12] that's right
[1:03:14] brother brandon talks about shooting his
[1:03:15] rifle
[1:03:19] and if he's off just a slight
[1:03:24] by the time it hits the target
[1:03:27] way off along
[1:03:40] there's many preachers inside the
[1:03:41] message
[1:03:53] oh if you break down what this word
[1:03:55] really means
[1:04:10] but it's gone
[1:04:38] to really study
[1:05:20] but they
[1:05:48] you grow
[1:06:02] we would listen to tapes
[1:06:04] every uh wednesday and sunday night we
[1:06:07] would listen to tapes
[1:06:10] and sunday morning they would do a
[1:06:11] little exhortation on the on the tapes
[1:06:18] my family my family
[1:06:21] and my uncle's family
[1:06:24] are the only children
[1:06:27] out of that entire church still serving
[1:06:29] the lord
[1:06:45] and then when they start getting older
[1:06:48] and they start getting exposed to the
[1:06:50] world
[1:06:54] they don't know where the foundation of
[1:06:56] the faith was built is
[1:07:09] so if you don't know why you believe
[1:07:11] brother branham
[1:07:26] if god gives you a revelation
[1:07:29] it's based on his word
[1:07:32] then you see it in his word
[1:07:36] if the world didn't give it to you
[1:07:39] the world can't take it away
[1:08:06] they go in one day and get an x-ray
[1:08:20] is
[1:08:35] it's because we're living in the
[1:08:36] supernatural the past
[1:08:38] unless you're natural we don't base our
[1:08:40] our faith off of five senses
[1:08:45] but we base it off the sixth sense
[1:08:50] which is faith in
[1:08:58] so we could see in this story of these
[1:09:00] three hebrew children
[1:09:16] they knew exactly where they were
[1:09:18] standing with god
[1:09:27] [Applause]
[1:09:32] that can do
[1:09:44] so we thank god for holy ghost-filled
[1:09:46] pastors
[1:09:59] is
[1:10:13] but i can guarantee you one thing
[1:10:15] measure guarantee
[1:10:17] that when my dad would come home with
[1:10:19] his belt
[1:10:22] i deserved that
[1:10:26] it wasn't because he wanted to hurt
[1:11:04] there's a we built a church in
[1:11:07] in houston texas
[1:11:11] houston texas huge baptist church
[1:11:15] many many many members
[1:11:21] and in dealing with some of their uh
[1:11:23] higher-ups
[1:11:36] the young people can come and they can
[1:11:38] have their little concerts
[1:11:42] they've got light shows inside the
[1:11:44] sanctuaries
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:48] they have songs that'll get you all
[1:11:49] pumped up and you jump up and down
[1:12:47] says and unto the angel of the church of
[1:12:49] the ladies
[1:12:50] right
[1:12:54] says i know thy works
[1:12:57] that thou art neither cold or hot get
[1:13:00] your name
[1:13:02] i would
[1:13:17] out of my mouth
[1:13:22] can we see what's happening in the in
[1:13:24] our culture right now
[1:13:29] because you say that i am rich
[1:13:43] we have never seen so much prosperity
[1:13:48] prosperity like we have in the world
[1:13:50] today
[1:13:53] where children can post videos on
[1:13:55] tick-tock
[1:13:58] videos
[1:14:12] that
[1:14:35] all these little
[1:14:37] children running around
[1:14:39] funky
[1:14:40] let's
[1:14:49] and they don't even know
[1:14:57] and the prophet of our age even a member
[1:14:59] of the prophet you would preach against
[1:15:01] those things
[1:15:03] you would warn him and say this could
[1:15:05] destroy your ministry
[1:15:08] that you're ready
[1:15:36] and they don't
[1:15:52] that in christ's time wasn't very far
[1:15:54] off
[1:15:57] but here we are two thousand years later
[1:16:01] in the catholic church
[1:16:03] it's the thing farthest away from the
[1:16:05] truth
[1:16:11] and we see the same thing happening in
[1:16:13] the message
[1:16:15] we must study
[1:16:22] [Applause]
[1:16:32] and we see the same thing happening in
[1:16:34] the message
[1:16:36] you have two extremes
[1:16:38] extreme we're walking a tight rope you
[1:16:40] know someone travel and we must keep
[1:16:42] perfect balance
[1:16:45] because on one side
[1:16:59] ignoring the revelation of today
[1:17:04] in ephesians the the scripture talks
[1:17:06] about it
[1:17:09] oh god will reveal himself
[1:17:13] but how is he going to reveal
[1:17:28] you're ignoring the
[1:17:42] reveals himself
[1:17:55] trying to put brother branham the
[1:18:24] you must keep balance
[1:18:28] when they started baptizing in brother
[1:18:29] branham's name he took himself off the
[1:18:31] scene
[1:18:36] but yeah he told brother perry green may
[1:18:38] idea for peregrine
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:18] oh but you can't preach against all
[1:19:20] these things
[1:20:01] when people see you dressed modestly in
[1:20:03] the store
[1:20:08] offensive to them
[1:20:12] but they say it's offensive
[1:20:15] because of conviction
[1:20:43] something that can help them out of that
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:20:58] praise
[1:21:08] oh if you're democrat or you're
[1:21:10] republican
[1:21:12] republican i mean people are sending
[1:21:14] death threats to one another
[1:21:17] because you believe a little bit
[1:21:19] different politically well
[1:21:25] they're trying to divide the the whites
[1:21:27] and the blacks
[1:21:32] it's a shame
[1:21:35] i know people in the message
[1:21:39] claiming that brother branham was a
[1:21:40] racist
[1:21:52] so you can't deviate to the right
[1:22:05] none of this has been in my notes i'm
[1:22:06] sorry yes
[1:22:08] we believe
[1:22:22] do you see that
[1:23:05] so here we are yeah
[1:23:07] we've got the three hebrew boys
[1:23:10] we're now presented with a choice
[1:23:14] the king is said i i heard
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:31] you three are not bowing
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:27] where he says
[1:24:38] he says and who is that god
[1:24:43] that shall deliver you out of my hands
[1:24:47] oh unbeknownst to him
[1:24:50] not knowing to him
[1:24:53] he just challenged
[1:25:10] to a true believer
[1:25:26] he is challenging the healing power of
[1:25:28] christ
[1:25:34] he's going to take god at his word
[1:25:37] and say lord you gave me a promise
[1:26:05] because who is that
[1:26:32] we are not careful to answer thee in
[1:26:47] we're not going to try to make you feel
[1:26:48] good
[1:27:03] serve
[1:27:04] praise the lord glad you
[1:27:07] our god who we serve
[1:27:10] is able to deliver us
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:14] burning fiery furnace
[1:27:29] did you
[1:27:45] oh praise the lord
[1:27:48] but
[1:27:49] amen if not messi no
[1:27:52] be it known unto the o king
[1:27:56] that we will not serve thy god
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:12] it doesn't matter if we get sick
[1:28:15] we serve a god that will heal us
[1:28:18] he decides not to
[1:28:20] mercilessly known oh satan oh we're not
[1:28:24] going to bow down
[1:28:36] oh praise the lord
[1:28:42] well that didn't really make the king
[1:28:44] very happy
[1:28:46] i'm sure you can i mean
[1:28:50] he's got a little bit of a god complex
[1:28:54] complex the superiority as king they
[1:28:56] said a royal crown upon history
[1:29:01] everybody does as he commands them to do
[1:29:04] hello
[1:29:07] so when someone is honest with him
[1:29:11] it tells him how it really is
[1:29:14] it doesn't make him very happy
[1:29:18] same thing happens with the devil
[1:29:22] he's so used to
[1:29:49] and therefore we will overcome
[1:30:03] the king commands them to make that
[1:30:06] fiery furnace
[1:30:10] the one that would already burn someone
[1:30:12] to death
[1:30:15] he gets angry
[1:30:17] and he says make that thing seven times
[1:30:20] hotter
[1:30:23] first church
[1:30:28] fifth church age hotter
[1:30:30] than j hotter
[1:30:32] there is
[1:31:11] he dismissed them to get the most
[1:31:14] great warriors
[1:31:27] is
[1:31:54] it seems that they have control of their
[1:31:56] life
[1:32:08] too much for the greatest
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:53] oh it's so fantastic
[1:32:56] the warriors were killed
[1:33:00] the bonds that they were in
[1:33:03] turned away
[1:33:05] but it did not touch the balloon
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:34:02] we meet god in the midst of the fight
[1:34:06] but we're we're afraid of of tribulation
[1:34:10] we're afraid
[1:34:12] you want to get closer to god
[1:34:15] you want to build your faith
[1:34:28] this is
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:35:26] hallelujah
[1:35:39] all of us were
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:54] i'm going to just jump to this is this
[1:35:55] is a little off topic but it just came
[1:35:57] to my heart
[1:36:04] there was a wise man that told me one
[1:36:06] time
[1:36:09] he said if you're struggling with things
[1:36:11] of the world
[1:36:15] he said you must have a holy ghost
[1:36:18] experience
[1:36:20] experience
[1:36:21] that is greater than
[1:36:24] the outside worldly experience
[1:36:30] the experience of demand
[1:36:34] and that's our problem
[1:36:36] as many times we don't have that
[1:36:38] experience with the holy ghost
[1:36:42] or at least we don't have an experience
[1:36:44] with the holy ghost
[1:36:49] is greater than the experience
[1:37:15] greater than that experience
[1:37:18] experience so until you get an
[1:37:20] experience with the holy ghost
[1:37:24] that is greater than your experience
[1:37:26] with the world
[1:37:28] experiences have a problem
[1:37:41] he was talking about
[1:37:42] how
[1:37:44] um
[1:37:45] jacob
[1:38:01] emilia and you would say
[1:38:04] if any one of us break our words
[1:38:08] so shall we be and see what you say
[1:38:13] and he said on the
[1:38:14] cross how jesus came down
[1:38:18] when he died
[1:38:20] christ broke him in half
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:24] body and spirit
[1:38:27] and now his body is up sitting on the
[1:38:29] throne
[1:38:32] portion of the deal
[1:38:37] your portion
[1:38:41] is the holy ghost under
[1:38:54] and we'll leave that there there's your
[1:38:56] villain
[1:38:58] where do we find god in the midst of the
[1:39:00] fire
[1:39:02] amen do we believe that
[1:39:04] if we were to hop over into um joshua
[1:39:07] yes
[1:39:09] we see an amazing story here you know
[1:39:12] historic stella excellence dc uh joshua
[1:39:15] 10.
[1:39:17] and there was a king that came to joshua
[1:39:20] and he said joshua i've got a problem
[1:39:23] he said i've got five other kings
[1:39:27] each one of those kings is bigger than
[1:39:28] isis
[1:39:31] but i have five kings coming against it
[1:39:35] would you help me
[1:39:38] so joshua goes to the lord
[1:39:41] and he says lord should we
[1:39:43] go down and fight with them
[1:39:47] in verse 8
[1:39:49] chapter 10 of joshua
[1:39:51] and the lord said unto joshua
[1:39:54] he said fear them not.
[1:39:57] for i have delivered them into thine
[1:40:00] hands
[1:40:04] i just love the way that christ says
[1:40:06] things
[1:40:19] but he says i have already deleted
[1:40:23] so now joshua has the promise
[1:40:27] it's already done
[1:40:30] all he has to do is play his part
[1:40:47] believe the word of god did you he says
[1:40:51] for i have delivered them into thy name
[1:40:56] there shall not a man of them stand
[1:40:59] before thee
[1:41:02] there's
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:14] whatever problem comes your way
[1:41:45] so then i like what the scripture says
[1:41:48] after receiving the promise
[1:41:52] joshua didn't say yeah okay i've got a
[1:41:54] promise
[1:41:56] we can go to battle with
[1:42:05] but the scripture says that joshua went
[1:42:06] down immediately
[1:42:12] and went down to battle with it
[1:42:16] and i just think it's pretty amazing
[1:42:20] that god didn't just leave
[1:42:22] joshua by himself
[1:42:26] but he sent hailstones out of heaven
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:33] killed more of the enemies
[1:42:40] but because joshua had a promise in
[1:42:42] verse 8.
[1:42:49] joshua was fighting
[1:42:52] fighting a combatant
[1:42:54] and
[1:43:36] i
[1:43:36] [Applause]
[1:43:50] you have
[1:44:05] bartimaeus
[1:44:07] and there's jesus of nazareth walking
[1:44:09] down the road
[1:44:12] and he says
[1:44:13] jesus
[1:44:14] jesus jesus thou son of david have mercy
[1:44:17] on
[1:44:31] so i ask you now
[1:45:00] we read these scriptures about joshua
[1:45:04] and we think oh there's no way
[1:45:08] but what is greater
[1:45:10] stopping the sun in the sky
[1:45:13] we're stopping the son of god in his
[1:45:15] trust
[1:45:17] because you have a need
[1:45:22] which one was more supernatural
[1:45:27] praise the lord
[1:45:29] but joshua knew exactly where he stood
[1:45:31] me
[1:45:33] god gave him a promise
[1:45:36] all he had to do was stand on that
[1:45:38] problem
[1:45:41] and there's scriptures that say
[1:45:43] electricity repent
[1:45:46] be baptized
[1:45:49] for the remissions of your sins
[1:45:52] and then the other scripture says in
[1:45:53] this promise
[1:46:10] foreign
[1:46:51] brother branham preached why christ
[1:47:34] screaming and yelling
[1:47:46] you guys can't get too excited
[1:48:03] people already think you're so spiritual
[1:48:04] what happens if you come up to the altar
[1:48:11] oh but you're a preacher oh no
[1:48:13] you don't you if you come up here to
[1:48:15] repent
[1:48:58] if they were to get a ticket for the
[1:49:00] world cup
[1:49:04] they would fly all the way across the
[1:49:06] country
[1:49:09] across the world
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:33] [Applause]
[1:49:37] right
[1:49:52] we have nothing to be ashamed of
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:50:04] [Applause]
[1:50:22] going down
[1:50:36] he
[1:50:49] the son of god
[1:51:05] he said go your way for your faith saves
[1:51:08] you edicano
[1:51:11] hallelujah hallelujah your faith saves
[1:51:14] you
[1:51:15] that was enough
[1:51:18] desperation
[1:51:40] [Applause]
[1:52:00] let me
[1:52:16] i don't see nothing yet
[1:52:18] when jesus said thy faith has saved them
[1:52:23] that was enough
[1:52:27] we can think of
[1:52:29] was it uh what was that blind man's name
[1:52:31] in brother branham's meetings
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:36] when brother john ryan comes up through
[1:52:38] the prayer lines
[1:52:41] brother random says you're healed
[1:52:42] everybody
[1:53:10] it seems that nothing has
[1:54:21] and you know what he quit caring about
[1:54:22] what other people
[1:54:24] say
[1:54:26] hey he starts selling newspapers
[1:54:30] hey extra extra read all about it
[1:55:03] and then he gets up
[1:55:05] just like any other day he's just to
[1:55:07] come to todd rojo he sits in the barber
[1:55:09] chair
[1:55:13] and they're poking a little bit of fun
[1:55:14] at him
[1:55:31] [Applause]
[1:55:40] [Applause]
[1:55:44] you go
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:26] he was just half halfway shaved
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:34] oh he didn't care what people thought
[1:56:35] about it
[1:56:35] [Applause]
[1:56:40] he just
[1:57:06] [Music]
[1:57:08] god loved you so much
[1:57:13] he's above everything
[1:57:15] to choose but he loved you so much
[1:57:19] but he didn't want to live in paradise
[1:57:21] all by himself
[1:57:28] and brother vincent when you get a bride
[1:57:30] don't you want to give her everything
[1:57:31] you can ask forever
[1:57:36] so imagine
[1:58:16] the pressure at the bottom
[1:58:20] have you guys ever gone swimming and
[1:58:21] tried to see how deep you can die
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:45] imagine the pressure from
[1:59:01] the pressure on the bottom of that pipe
[1:59:05] is less
[1:59:07] than what god wants to fill you with the
[1:59:09] holy ghost
[1:59:13] amen
[1:59:15] so he also said
[1:59:17] you see that if you go to hell guess he
[1:59:19] was alone
[1:59:24] the holy ghost on display
[1:59:27] blatantly denying it
[1:59:56] then this promise is for me
[1:59:59] hallelujah hallelujah it's just that
[2:00:02] simple
[2:00:11] i'll try to wrap it up with one more of
[2:00:13] it
[2:00:19] i'm sure brother foss and some of these
[2:00:20] other brothers know yeah
[2:00:25] sometimes you get so many things built
[2:00:27] up
[2:00:31] that trying to fit it in one message
[2:00:35] it can be very difficult
[2:00:38] there's just too much to talk about
[2:00:42] like that song says
[2:00:45] if the oceans were full of ink
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:51] and all the skies were full of
[2:00:53] parchments
[2:00:57] it still couldn't contain it
[2:01:01] so then you're trying to cram the pasta
[2:01:06] into an hour
[2:01:14] i'm not a long-winded preacher so i can
[2:01:16] preach that pretty easy
[2:01:18] all right wisdom versus faith
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:46] if you could type that in sister i want
[2:01:47] you guys to read this word
[2:02:02] foreign which is the holy spirit
[2:02:07] in the church
[2:02:11] there it is well
[2:02:14] sure right there
[2:02:16] in the
[2:02:30] the holy spirit in the church the santa
[2:02:32] speed only gliese i like this part
[2:02:35] he says satan
[2:02:38] be careful
[2:02:40] hallelujah hallelujah that's enough to
[2:02:42] make a methodist shout out
[2:03:10] you can lock my brother paul in prison
[2:03:21] oh you could give my my my sister a
[2:03:23] heart problem
[2:03:26] it doesn't
[2:03:38] you better be careful
[2:03:50] we've already received the promise that
[2:03:51] there's going to be a bribery
[2:04:22] because there's going to be a generation
[2:04:23] basketball generation that isn't going
[2:04:26] to take death as an answer
[2:04:31] and i believe that it is this generation
[2:04:35] we're not going to have to taste death
[2:04:50] oh
[2:05:04] you
[2:05:16] [Applause]
[2:05:18] and the world can't take
[2:05:40] [Applause]
[2:05:46] just because we're here on earth it
[2:05:47] doesn't change who we really are
[2:05:52] and the devil always likes to come and
[2:05:53] say oh yeah you think you know who you
[2:05:56] are
[2:06:00] you've done
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:28] let's look in this book of all my sins
[2:06:30] and shortcomings
[2:06:33] because according to the word of god
[2:06:36] that when i confess my sins because you
[2:06:38] confess me
[2:06:39] they are put into the bleach
[2:06:42] and those sins
[2:07:19] he's the guy that tries to trick you
[2:07:20] into doing something
[2:07:36] and then he calls the cops
[2:07:50] but when you turn back into the law
[2:07:52] books mekong
[2:08:06] and we're both standing
[2:08:15] he was the one who did it
[2:08:20] so you want to keep talking about our
[2:08:21] pastors
[2:08:24] he doesn't want to talk about that
[2:08:27] because we're just taking god at his
[2:08:28] word
[2:08:30] and that settles it is
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:48] filled with the holy spirit
[2:08:50] and when that happens
[2:08:53] satan
[2:08:54] be careful
[2:08:57] praise god
[2:09:01] job had it happened one time and i'll
[2:09:02] close with this
[2:09:05] job
[2:09:06] everybody was against job
[2:09:09] oh they loved him when he was prosperous
[2:09:11] oh you don't let prosperity he only only
[2:09:13] makes it on a prosperity but as soon as
[2:09:15] things start to go wrong
[2:09:31] the thing that was closest to him
[2:09:34] i told him just curse god and die it is
[2:09:36] just
[2:09:38] that there was something
[2:09:40] something rose up with inside of jokes
[2:09:57] just say let my redeemer live
[2:10:11] we don't have to put this off for
[2:10:12] another generation
[2:10:33] hopefully something was said to
[2:10:34] encourage you baby
