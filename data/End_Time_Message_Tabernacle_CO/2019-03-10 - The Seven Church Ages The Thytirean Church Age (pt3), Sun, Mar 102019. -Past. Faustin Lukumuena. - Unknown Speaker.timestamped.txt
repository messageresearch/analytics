[35:46] and then the Bible said appealability ah
[35:50] I have a few things against the de
[35:53] contrato ah you the people of the age of
[35:57] title even though your works your first
[36:02] works were less than the present one
[36:06] evoke cumulative mind work yourself but
[36:15] number one thou sufferest that woman
[36:19] Jezebel which calleth herself a
[36:25] prophetess not people are calling
[36:29] Jezebel prophet she's calling herself
[36:35] and you know if you call yourself a
[36:39] prophet she was a playful member a
[36:41] prophetess that means you are a preacher
[36:48] Jezebel put herself on the pulpit is
[36:54] that the Bible and Jezebel proclaim
[36:59] himself I'm a preacher the best to
[37:01] proclaim a predicate no you cannot be a
[37:03] prophet if you don't have a doctor so we
[37:09] will talk about the doctrine of Jesus
[37:14] and to teach and to seduce My servant to
[37:20] commit to fornication
[37:24] so they don't win of Jezebel teaching
[37:29] she was a teaching and in the meantime
[37:32] trying to seduce God's servants to
[37:37] commit fornication her teaching will be
[37:41] to tell young boys you know you are a
[37:44] young boy don't wait until marriage go
[37:48] to fornication are they going to do
[37:51] fornication we will some young girls
[37:56] she will teach them how to look sexy
[38:01] cooperate with sexy
[38:02] the high-heeled short skirt all this
[38:06] makeup brother branham say there is no
[38:11] woman in the Bible before Jezebel who
[38:15] started painting her face but she was a
[38:20] beautiful lady Mediterranean Jolie done
[38:22] painting herself
[38:24] Elmen painting and you know all the
[38:33] style and fashion a lot to say still a
[38:35] mood was coming from Jezebel and we will
[38:39] go in to study their life of just a bell
[38:45] was in a social life
[38:49] the first lady Isabella T not from your
[38:51] damn she was traveling with Arab in Air
[38:56] Force One going everywhere every time
[39:02] she named chocolate maybe four to three
[39:05] hours she dressed differently maybe
[39:09] short skirt hi him and when she bored
[39:13] again the next landing she's in a
[39:18] legging the top empty she was a stylist
[39:26] that's what I'm saying I think if I'm an
[39:29] MD the first lady Kennedy Kennedy you
[39:34] know what she did for this car if she
[39:36] were a head like this attention to more
[39:39] watch do melt all the woman to Michelle
[39:43] Obama Michelle Obama always sleeveless
[39:49] there is no more mobility in the White
[39:52] House got to see the White House no
[39:56] regard apollomon go to the house of Ahab
[39:58] eyelid on amazon.com you will see know
[40:01] where all these does though things
[40:03] started so she's putting people to
[40:08] commit fornication
[40:09] Matala fornication because she was a
[40:11] prophetess calling herself perfectly she
[40:16] was against all the preachers you preach
[40:21] you want to start marriage this way this
[40:23] way no c'mon silly mommy has come sister
[40:25] welcome no no start in secret first know
[40:33] yourself know your depressor you are
[40:36] going to even sexually kiss all these
[40:40] things don't follow those preachers and
[40:43] when the preacher will say Jezebel will
[40:47] take this sword to kill them visible
[40:48] rally pathology and to eat thick
[40:53] teaching the people out to eat things
[40:56] sacrificed to idols they kill and we
[41:00] read this this meaning in the previous
[41:03] age it's not to eat things to be
[41:08] partakers of the scene of the people
[41:15] verse 21 regardless of how bad Jesus
[41:18] Abell could be God gave her space to
[41:24] repent of her fornication he painted
[41:30] upon the Bible she said she repented and
[41:33] not you get the spirit of Jezebel we can
[41:44] preach as hard as we can because in the
[41:49] time of Jesus there was a mighty
[41:52] preacher on the bonham said Elijah was
[42:03] the pastor of Ahab and the pastor of
[42:07] Jezebel even though Jezebel did not
[42:10] accept him here I'm gonna throw a
[42:14] concept that some pastors want
[42:20] if they got to this Court I think the
[42:22] world of message will be booming again
[42:28] it's the concept of the pastor of the
[42:32] community brother Branham said when God
[42:42] sent a pastor Pipkin do either you
[42:48] accept him or not we like the pupa
[42:50] he is the pastor of the community so
[43:01] it's in the message what Dow what does
[43:05] Dow here
[43:08] Jeff a team hug after 10 dots toward the
[43:14] end and they add a queen there by the
[43:27] name of Jezebel and she added led all
[43:32] the children of Israel is Trey with her
[43:36] modern fantastic way of living shared
[43:47] caused them to commit fornication and to
[43:50] do evil things the teaching of Jesus if
[44:00] that isn't good parallel to today so
[44:06] it's not about history but Elijah in the
[44:10] midst of it all yet many of the children
[44:15] of Israel dozen of them had compromised
[44:20] and wanted to leave the modern trend of
[44:23] life
[44:26] de la vie yet Elijah would not
[44:29] compromise
[44:31] he told Jezebel her place amen the
[44:37] spirit of Elijah and how she must do
[44:42] Kumud every fail oh she hated that
[44:45] prophet but just the same she wouldn't
[44:50] claim him but he was her pastor oh there
[44:57] is a lot of time they don't want to
[45:00] claim it but a God sent men to a
[45:04] community is the pastor of the entire
[45:09] community
[45:12] amen that including Baptist Presbyterian
[45:16] and whatsoever even if you come to
[45:20] church then you said that's not my
[45:23] pastor I am I still your pastor just in
[45:28] a pool in a queer mom we are on Google
[45:30] now it's becoming hard that's the truth
[45:34] that's what it happened with just a bad
[45:37] mistake is a pathogen I'm not I don't
[45:39] accept her I don't accept him I'm a
[45:43] prophetess myself you see prophetess one
[45:45] by elijah said your place is not on the
[45:48] pulpit to start with you are a woman
[45:52] with you should belong to the kitchen
[45:57] god anoint his man and he will not
[46:00] compromise your wife is a pecan for
[46:03] metal and the people sometimes hate
[46:09] that's the reason why they hate all
[46:11] God's spiritual men we will not be
[46:17] surprised that some people hate us
[46:20] because the nature of the people when
[46:24] one time they give them a choice
[46:27] they gave them the choice between Jesus
[46:31] and Barnabas they say we prefer this
[46:36] what did Jesus do wrong that's the
[46:40] spirit of Jezebel hate God servant but
[46:46] yet he's God pastor for the amen so as
[46:56] we go back to the scripture Jezebel did
[47:00] not repent that was a verse 21 of
[47:04] Revelation 2 and then the Bible
[47:08] continues there are three verses I will
[47:11] combine them in many sessions so just a
[47:17] bell spirit no repentance verse 22 the
[47:23] spirit said because she did not repay
[47:26] must be party party behold I will cast
[47:29] her into a bed and brother bottom said
[47:34] the meaning of the bed he will cast her
[47:38] into the world worldliness and them that
[47:45] commit adultery so you see Jezebel did
[47:50] not do only fornication but she's also
[47:54] teaching adult oh you know you cannot
[48:00] just live with one wife one wife for
[48:02] life you cannot live just with one man
[48:05] there you know this is a free country
[48:08] you can go with Andrew we can go with
[48:13] Joseph right you can go with and God
[48:21] said those people all of them I will
[48:28] cast them into a bed and them that
[48:32] commit adultery with her
[48:34] Tsukiko matter you aim to Great
[48:36] Tribulation except they repent of their
[48:41] deed and I will kill her children with
[48:45] death
[48:47] Dumas is on phone they children of
[48:50] Jezebel Abed
[48:51] Garza will kill all of those you follow
[48:55] after Jezebel fashioned the spirit of
[49:00] dominating the husband God said I will
[49:06] kill their children of Jezebel and all
[49:09] the churches shall know that I am he
[49:13] which searches the rain and hot and I
[49:18] will give unto every one of you
[49:21] according to your works so my sister's
[49:27] keep in mind the good work you are doing
[49:31] for God willing there is a reward and
[49:36] those who don't want to repent there
[49:42] will be consequences that woman Jezebel
[49:47] when you say if you see a woman painting
[49:51] acting like Jezebel magic he comes
[49:54] Isabel just cause just say hello mrs.
[49:58] dogmeat that was how they just about
[50:04] life ended Isabela Tiffany the dog had
[50:09] to lick her blood so that's being said
[50:18] so my title this morning Montezuma is a
[50:23] dominating female is the greatest curse
[50:25] in the world and we will see why
[50:31] whether Bonham made that statement that
[50:36] a dominating female it's the greatest
[50:41] curse in the world in the exposition of
[50:46] Church edges dietary encourage paragraph
[50:51] 227 - 1
[50:59] so after the eulogy of the age Barnum
[51:05] said now the whole cry of God against
[51:09] this for age is found in his
[51:12] denunciation of this so the summary of
[51:22] the age of Styria
[51:25] they cry of God about this age is
[51:34] centered on these prophets and to
[51:42] understand exactly why he denounces her
[51:46] so we will have to look up her history
[51:52] in the Bible and when we find what she
[51:59] did back there Toula
[52:02] we will know what she's doing on at this
[52:06] time so we are not going about history
[52:11] but in we go back to boot to pull the
[52:16] material in order to better understand
[52:20] what she's doing now the first and very
[52:24] important thing that we learn about
[52:26] Jezebel is that she's not a daughter of
[52:36] thats not the seed of no is her
[52:42] induction into the tribes of israel one
[52:47] of spiritual admission as was was that
[52:51] of hoods the mob attests and a plan on
[52:54] prediction delete rebuild Israel do not
[52:58] mission spiritual completely like a
[52:59] sacred lamo a big no sir no Monsieur
[53:02] this woman Jezebel that from Jezebel was
[53:06] the daughter of F Bale you can see the
[53:12] name of
[53:13] just a bell father probably know you
[53:15] parishes I've been ad Bale you remember
[53:19] the four hundred profit of bail
[53:21] vindication for federal that the name of
[53:24] Jezebel that Ethel we know you paired
[53:26] Isabel earth bail at he was the king of
[53:30] Sidon they tell you what is he Don who
[53:34] was the priest and to Astarte what did
[53:39] Jezebel dad do he had gained the throne
[53:44] by murdering his puss predecessor
[53:47] Phillies so Jezebel alone was the
[53:55] daughter of a criminal they tell a
[53:58] hidden criminal how can you go marry the
[54:02] daughter of a criminal that's why
[54:05] brother Branham said in the message
[54:08] fundamental foundation of for the face
[54:12] of seven you want to marry check out the
[54:18] life of the White Witch family she's
[54:20] coming for me amen amen
[54:27] because if Arab could check out that the
[54:33] father was a murder she could quickly
[54:37] have an idea this girl I'm about to
[54:42] marry effectively memory may kill me
[54:46] tomorrow to make sure the man or caused
[54:49] me to be killed so we see right away
[54:57] that she was a daughter of a murder this
[55:03] certainly reminds us of Cain with
[55:06] inhibition Monica but we are going
[55:10] slowly in teaching we have all these
[55:13] different aspects and the way she become
[55:17] she became part of Israel impacted
[55:22] Israel was not through their spiritual
[55:25] channels
[55:26] that God has ordained for the Gentile
[55:28] admission a new spiritual Kaduna pool
[55:32] admission agency but she came in by
[55:35] marriage to the king of the ten tribes
[55:40] of Israel
[55:43] now this Union as we ever seen was not
[55:48] spiritual so there are many marriages
[55:53] they are not spiritual to spiritual it
[55:58] was political a politic I will see the
[56:01] people today rejoicing and married
[56:03] praise God praise God but which marriage
[56:07] is it spiritual marriage how did you
[56:11] start out wrinkle going what was the
[56:15] motive what was the objective political
[56:22] and so this woman who was steeped in
[56:28] idolatry did not have the least desire
[56:32] to become a worship when do they still
[56:38] that do hate the worship of the one true
[56:42] God but rather she came with about
[56:48] intentions this is how many people get
[56:54] into married you see the people getting
[56:58] married but there is intention
[57:03] jessabelle intention in getting married
[57:08] was to turn Israel away from the Lord no
[57:14] wonder we will see many good brothers
[57:18] many good sisters right after marriages
[57:22] the problem I can barely recognize them
[57:24] they append every connect because
[57:27] somebody added intention are you are
[57:32] living like this do this do this I'm
[57:36] gonna marry that person
[57:39] I'm gonna turn her you like points for
[57:42] me I think I will go in more detail on
[57:52] the political marriage in the days to
[57:54] come but skipping going to paragraph 214
[58:02] - 3 this is where marijuana made that
[58:06] statement it is most worth Lee of note
[58:12] that the very name tight area means
[58:19] dominating of female that's the meaning
[58:24] of the edge tighter it's a dominating
[58:29] female and brother bottom told us
[58:33] whenever you find a dominating female
[58:36] occupy in from domina trees it's the
[58:39] greatest curse in the world Allah
[58:42] prediction dilute Nam and I'm not
[58:45] talking or it's not concerning our

[1:00:06] dominating female is the greatest curse
[1:00:10] in the world and I pleaded my addiction
[1:00:13] dalam on that's my title
[1:00:16] lastly motive skipping a little bit we
[1:00:21] read it last Sunday and Paul said I
[1:00:27] suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp
[1:00:34] authority that's the Bible
[1:00:38] let's take it in first Timothy chapter
[1:00:40] two when I don't anticipate for do I
[1:00:45] suffer not a woman to teach and permian
[1:00:49] from depression now you look at
[1:00:50] revelation jessabelle was teaching and
[1:00:57] said juicy but the Bible cannot
[1:01:02] contradict itself and this is also valid
[1:01:07] for all their religions any religion
[1:01:12] where they can F a woman preaching in
[1:01:16] funky fresh that's a dominating force at
[1:01:19] 1850 you mean that's occurs I cannot
[1:01:23] understand somebody who has been taught
[1:01:26] in the message leave the message to go
[1:01:30] in a church with a woman pastor awakened
[1:01:33] from pastor and I'm gonna touch a little
[1:01:37] bit the approach of the woman allows you
[1:01:39] Pamela have posted on why a woman cannot
[1:01:43] deplete wala family to appreciate
[1:01:45] because she was not in the original
[1:01:47] creation that's it and the policy Paul D
[1:01:56] but I suffer not a woman to teach so a
[1:02:01] woman whose teaching is exactly the
[1:02:05] same as a woman who's usurping authority
[1:02:08] over the man a lot of things that don't
[1:02:11] issue along so don't blame the woman
[1:02:14] preaching Alabama in funky-fresh if you
[1:02:17] as a woman not you as Jezebel as a woman
[1:02:22] I was you shopping authority over the
[1:02:27] husband the husband could not say much
[1:02:33] everything was sent on Jezebel to the
[1:02:38] extent when somebody does anything to
[1:02:41] the husband they ours were was going to
[1:02:46] complain to his wife Melissa plan pick
[1:03:01] up that spirit of domination do me no
[1:03:11] you have to watch it twice a woman was
[1:03:17] not made for such a woman shall never
[1:03:27] but to be in silence there is for Adam
[1:03:36] was the first for Bianca me for me then
[1:03:40] if that's the reason because the woman
[1:03:44] was not in the original she and Adam was
[1:03:52] not deceived identity possibly but the
[1:03:57] woman being deceived was in the
[1:04:00] transgression myself um kisses said with
[1:04:03] 70 Cooper the translation because the
[1:04:06] woman was the one was deceived
[1:04:08] especially from Kate is a bit and that's
[1:04:10] what how the woman if what they see and
[1:04:15] we see it from that time until today
[1:04:19] when a woman is at the age to bear
[1:04:24] children the world is on phone she add a
[1:04:27] period every month I like to use a
[1:04:28] period shot more so you see a baby girl
[1:04:31] born children there is no age does the
[1:04:45] blood of guiltiness until she reached
[1:04:51] the age of menopause now you will let a
[1:04:58] woman in with the blood to lead the
[1:05:03] church that's why knowing that the woman
[1:05:13] came not to do this but he did not say
[1:05:17] that the woman are lost there is an
[1:05:20] opportunity given to the woman to those
[1:05:25] who want to conduct themselves as real
[1:05:27] real that's a policy notwithstanding
[1:05:35] they are more she shall be saved in
[1:05:38] childbearing as soon as so the undoing
[1:05:41] and even on male that's why God gave to
[1:05:43] the woman three special virtues special
[1:05:48] virtue virtue of her mother would that
[1:05:56] means a woman must have the mother would
[1:06:00] but it would mean willing to deliver
[1:06:03] babies because in delivering the baby
[1:06:07] that built another character in the
[1:06:10] woman to love and care for the baby they
[1:06:14] may show you baby look at even the
[1:06:17] animals when a dog is the baby's whole
[1:06:20] animal neighbor even if you are you out
[1:06:24] acquainted with the dog as he was at a
[1:06:26] beach ocean one share the baby you come
[1:06:29] closer baby then doctor
[1:06:32] because her heart hallelujah these in
[1:06:36] their babies so one of the virtue that
[1:06:40] God has given to the woman is the woman
[1:06:43] would not afford to live her babies
[1:06:50] unattended that's a strong statement
[1:06:56] that these where the baby is only baby
[1:07:03] so that's something God as differentiate
[1:07:07] between a man and a woman can play with
[1:07:14] the babies
[1:07:15] watch out two men a man who's taking the
[1:07:19] position of knowing to change you can
[1:07:25] help your sister your wife
[1:07:26] you can change but you become special in
[1:07:30] the cooking in the diaper changing the
[1:07:34] children I will look at you twice that's

[1:07:47] teaching we have to go in more detail so
[1:07:51] not only the woman would but their
[1:07:56] womanhood the woman would is her way of

[1:17:01] when there is issue in somebody's family
[1:17:04] don't get involved up on a pitch the
[1:17:10] message the religion of Jezebel 19 this
[1:17:18] is where brother Branham was telling the
[1:17:23] matter regarding marriage it's not yours
[1:17:28] leave it to the pastor why because just
[1:17:33] a very clever
[1:17:34] yourself as a prophet with the spirit of
[1:17:39] Elijah in the last days will continue to
[1:17:43] send her back well apart so the woman
[1:17:47] must have own character
[1:17:51] differed in talking before me even in
[1:17:55] acting Manoj ISA dressing they should
[1:17:59] dress as a lady you cannot break the
[1:18:04] limits with a publicity man leave me
[1:18:06] something happen here the man the woman
[1:18:08] is always ahead the man is the following
[1:18:12] run this is exactly what to Jezebel did
[1:18:19] you may think I'm just telling the
[1:18:23] stories as I said on Wednesday but upon
[1:18:28] him said in the message Mary's belief
[1:18:32] fog after teen he said a woman must be
[1:18:39] sweet soft
[1:18:45] well her pretty eyes talk about Joseph
[1:18:48] and Mary Joseph and Mary while her
[1:18:54] pretty eyes look at him like that of the
[1:18:58] dog the comely hidden column soft
[1:19:01] innocent country I think that's the way
[1:19:05] a woman should look report if he comes
[1:19:07] in a confirmed operator innocent
[1:19:09] soft and sweet but if you see a woman
[1:19:14] not too sweet my severe anemia produce
[1:19:17] military military so that's what a
[1:19:23] military military that's something is
[1:19:26] wrong
[1:19:28] God has given men a wife to soften the
[1:19:33] men who even in argument even in debate
[1:19:40] the woman when the women take a position
[1:19:43] on maybe the men said I'm gonna punish
[1:19:46] this child
[1:19:47] I'm gonna punish this child prefer the
[1:19:50] woman is this soft possible approach you
[1:19:53] do you'll be to be to be trap you will
[1:19:57] come because this is where you can
[1:20:06] that's the nature of a woman but if we

[1:20:29] can sink deep eyebrow say that a woman
[1:20:35] cannot beat the child but I'm showing is
[1:20:53] something different Jodie DeFeo a woman
[1:20:56] is a different she must be soft tender
[1:21:05] when even the men are in argument with
[1:21:08] other people then nature God knows the
[1:21:21] men get into argument even with his own
[1:21:23] family that is asking too much money
[1:21:29] here women died if they are coming to
[1:21:35] you it's because they don't have a wife

[1:24:52] place a woman is feminist sweet loving
[1:25:00] not being even in school sisters in a
[1:25:22] feminine way she's not supposed to be
[1:25:27] and when she does that
[1:25:30] her life is prophetic
[1:25:34] she's sweet loving kind where Adam is
[1:25:39] more the burly type a lot I don't
[1:25:41] approve did the character for he was the
[1:25:45] man the masculine type masculine the

[1:54:45] not involve in the thing as a commanding
[1:54:51] they want to take even the church and
[1:54:54] all the file of marriages will she will
[1:54:58] be involved that was just about doing

[1:55:18] one brother with one sister no just a
[1:55:23] bell quit even it is normal without the
[1:55:30] intention praise God but if there is a
[1:55:36] hidden motive wait because the end of

[1:56:59] was Israel in the south it was Judah
[1:57:08] with Jehoshaphat as the king
[1:57:12] so Jezebel without daughter in the north
[1:57:15] but I feel no it was not even the

[2:06:10] Israel to anger cap tsipras on co2 level
[2:06:15] Israel then all the kings of Israel
[2:06:18] where before him stove only one Israel
[2:06:21] cavity of only among all the King in

[2:06:24] Rami to miyawaki Tony's what Eric did
[2:06:26] take a cab he was the worst thing but it
[2:06:32] was not a habit doing Makka pakka
[2:06:35] there was a power behind a sexual power
[2:06:39] bill with all the makeup long nails
[2:06:45] sister you know that you cannot keep
[2:06:47] your leg your nails when I get to the
[2:06:54] dressing I'm gonna touch all those
[2:06:57] little things to say to teach that
[2:07:00] Jezebel was doing that's why I say I
[2:07:03] have a long Syria and because of this
[2:07:10] the anger of God you came let me skip
[2:07:15] this let's take another chapter first
[2:07:20] King chapter 17 I'm not gonna hit but
[2:07:28] I'm just if you can follow if you put
[2:07:31] this right so that I can get this idea
[2:07:39] first King that was chapter 16 chapter
[2:07:43] 16 was talking about how Jezebel was
[2:07:47] married hollynewcombe Elizabeth City
[2:07:49] married now we move to first Kings
[2:07:53] chapter 17 godsend Elisha the prophet
[2:08:00] and Elisha the prophet in spoke the word
[2:08:05] there will be no rain during that time
[2:08:10] the panettone that was no held and God
[2:08:15] took Elijah yep really to the widow of
[2:08:19] theropod to feed Elijah and chapter 18
[2:08:27] of first King repeatedly sweet it was
[2:08:32] now Elijah before the prophet of bail
[2:08:35] manasa
[2:08:35] alida valli profitable because Jezebel
[2:08:39] was a prophetess she as her servant and
[2:08:47] Elijah the pastor of the age he did not
[2:08:53] bow Jezebel regardless you are a woman
[2:08:59] I'm a man God sent me it was a fight
[2:09:04] finally it come to a showdown the common
[2:09:09] mount Elisha said if your God is really
[2:09:16] good let him respond by fire if mine is
[2:09:21] god and the prophet of bail they came
[2:09:27] they cry the guy being in vain
[2:09:31] and Elijah was coming cry louder maybe
[2:09:37] your God is in vacation somewhere I
[2:09:41] think
[2:09:43] and then Elijah came and when he set up
[2:09:47] everything they call a table to do so
[2:09:49] they fire for take all the four hundred
[2:09:54] profit of a bale and it wasn't
[2:09:57] profitable kill them and when they kill
[2:10:02] them if only that you Jezebel was not
[2:10:04] their disability Paula but Ahab was day
[2:10:07] mayor Kabat illa a heifer was looking in
[2:10:11] his heart was not happy but what did he
[2:10:24] ever went to accuse Elijah to his wife
[2:10:30] let us read the Bible because when I say
[2:10:33] he said let's take first Kings chapter
[2:10:39] 18 I was a bit wordy sweet let's take
[2:10:45] verse 37
[2:10:50] first Kings chapter 18 verse 37 hear me
[2:10:55] o Lord hear me that these people may
[2:10:58] know that they are the Lord God and that
[2:11:03] is au has turned their heart but again
[2:11:05] yes a Toki remember what that was the
[2:11:09] prayer of Elijah till appeared then the
[2:11:12] fire of the Lord fell and consumed the
[2:11:16] burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[2:11:19] stones and the dust and linked up the
[2:11:23] water that was in the tribe will absorb
[2:11:25] allocated all of knowledge for sale and

[2:14:10] without how he added slain all the
[2:14:13] prophets with the sword
[2:14:15] come I'll evacuate when Jesus heard that
[2:14:18] verse 2 then Jesus about send a
[2:14:22] messenger to the man cannot say Amen

[2:16:31] Philippa Elijah went to play in the cave
[2:16:37] and so forth and when he went let's go
[2:16:44] to verse maybe 25 I believe verse 18 the
[2:16:59] Bible said nobility everybody was afraid
[2:17:01] of Jezebel but regardless Malala there
[2:17:06] was about seven thousand they did not
[2:17:10] bow before Jessa regardless of their
