let's admire my own inheritance redeem doubt my right to dissolve for i cannot redeem it now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoes and gave it to the neighbor and this was a testimony in israel therefore the kinsmen said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoes and boa said unto the elders and unto all the people he are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was eliminated and all that was killings and macrons of of the hands of naomi moreover ruth the moabitess the

of his place he witnesses this day amen in revelation chapter five we're going to read from verse 2 to 3 and then we jump from verse 11 and 12. and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in the earth neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look at them their own levers development and when he had taken the book from the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hops and golden vial full of orders which are the prayers of saints i'm jump to verse 11 and beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the numbers of them was 10 000 ten ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was land to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and every creatures which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing honor and glory and power be unto him that seedeth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen we shall pray lord almighty god it's truly you our kinsmen redeemer oh god we don't have enough way to say how much you have done for us as the lot of people in the world dejan repeated the president well-known people president kings of this earth master and artinapa panda knew the zinnitis by god you didn't pay attention to them but you came through tonight we're so grateful and we say thank you alexandra if the angel can worship them that it never sins just leave only because you have found worthy to take the book oh father bless our pastor rick unfortunately strengthen him give him good health give him grace so far letting me here as the brother branham good and the blessed servants of your mouth that has been prepared for you before the foundation called the lesson yeah granted father precious name of the lord jesus amen amen amen continue you may be seated i'll continue uh what i was saying on sunday russia about the requirement of redemption basque citrus important because it's very important as brother burnham says [Music] when the people don't know anything [Music] somebody can mess around with you because you don't know what you're talking about and you know today with the message nobody anybody can come with uh miscourts especially if he knows that you don't read you don't know anything you get a manipulation he can manipulate you man gracious my grace be to god god is ascendant and god that spoke to us about the whole bible uh says the existence you see the requirements here is important are very important to know them so that our worship to be perfect today there's a lot of people saying uh william branham is our god worship the truth is because of all these things amen you have to be a kiss to the family says those are the requirements god wanted to manifest as we read in the book of ruth we have seen foboas whisper mariage rita to take ruth as his wife in reality ruse was not a jews la person que teste the one the jewish one that had to be with him was naomi naomi was the one to be redeemed because naomi was a jews and by elimelech was the husband of naomi and uh when you redeem something that belongs to a person you have to redeem everything that belongs to the person and the reason why khan boaz rashed now when bo was redeemed naomi automatic ma you rasheed when the pastor wanted to ask questions if to see if people understand or not malaysia i saw even simple thing people were not able to answer them i felt like i didn't do anything people didn't understand what i was preaching man but i think that boasts represent the christians boasts represent christ naomi represents the jewish church [Music] and ruth represent the church of nation and brother william is saying in plenty messages a perfect plane of redemption that represented in the book of ruth amen amen what is happening with ruth that's the same thing that's happening with us talking about the plane of redemption i'm saying this message i really love this book as the belief this message you know the feasts are defeated here as sons and daughters of god shaken every one of us at home for me in the family we need to have this book and to cast a certain leaf this is a book that you cannot like at your home company and today we're going to understand that this book no tradition our inheritance is found in this book and god required a kingsman redeemer and he must be a human as we see in the top of boas boaz was a king's men redeemer because it was a king's fault to eliminate he was the one who has the the the right to redeem everything that belongs to elimelech in the same way we deem naomi that's the same thing god did with the church now me naomi when you place them on the yoyo heart he had eternal life he had a joy tonight he didn't have any misery the wonderful plane of god met question what happened i'd not have accepted it i had them with that inheritance no suffer not enemy we know our enemies the devil came back by uh uh life disciples what he lost when you you buy your land members if you donate a election even if you give money see a per empty if there's no tarot care test that uh yeah that that land belongs to people anybody can come and play but if you have a tyrant tranquilize shall we see that this part of the land belongs to this person literally reigns on us the appropriate the tarot did they donate gives you the right and goddamn problem in case of the truth to claim you can watch the death that i have the tarot set person on the test i'm about to this part of the land belongs brother branham says the tarot his brother he could say to the mountains [Applause] the ownership of adam says that slide into from the hands of the secretary went back to god himself amen amen to get back some pufa his power son authorities authority let the existing second seller that took requirements that took a kingsman amen amen emperor prosthetic the king's men close to adam dog you have their sexists they had requirements their condition conditions so the enemy totally have the authority back that is why conditions first requirements the one that was will be able to redeem edward okay foreign [Applause] he but the angel never failed he says that satan expressed difference he's a different kind of being called different he has a different body [Applause] don't thought i would never continue and every man on the earth was born of sacrifices this way it came from le pesce even sex the the sin came from sex that means the one that has to be accused he doesn't have to be born by sex amen amen he has to be upright man a man and justin desjardins it seems it means like that person they cannot be condemned by the problem of sin because that's where sin started 135. he must be a kingsman now you see energy when we see these things people like i don't remember everybody couldn't do it because it fell yes it's here moses came mal gray first of all despite that he made god's faith as he's born out of sex disconfirmed disqualified john baptist john the bastard the one that jesus said let's because every prophet spoke about the language i tested every person he was the one who had to present him they call me leonard palace but since he was born out of physical fear he was also disqualified a precious yeah and jesus died jesse louis jesus himself kailene when he was born said yesterday he was god the spirit that sent the word by the angel to i cannot leave my children he got to marry except that it was with sinless amen amen amen and patience without sins without any condemnation that's our prayer kingsman amen redeem the wonderful yeah he had to be a man yes sex but he didn't have to be born out of sex therefore like a young woman but now see god himself be become a flesh even when he was growing up he let his sister a model he was just an example he was living a life in a video model a life of an example that means [Music] that gave birth to jesus he says i was born from a dad called shaw bruh that is born from a man and a woman he cannot be a kingsman [Applause] affect the same as yourself we are in the serpents you see the sin is in the blood the sin was in the blood to be uh enough wealthy foreign [Applause] but when they see that scene who's worthy who's worthy the angels they never knew any sin menu but we just went with you really say some posters they bow down allah [Applause] [Applause] we would have been lost so secondly story written that's the story of what the story of ruth is saying you see or see virginal or also in the virgin birth lesentes jesus was not a gentile jessie jesus was god exactly that exactly his blood didn't come from any sex acts [Music] he was the holy created blood of god and we are now saved by juice blood priest neither are we saved by gentle blood no summer survivor we are saved by the blood of god that's according to the bible that's the second ability that's what the bible says amen amen set on the kingdom please say condition this man that fulfill all the requirements that man that fills all the equipment the men that call goel go just is the mind that fills all the requirements to redeem and no matter amanda the king's men an integral a upright man just just said the man who's wealthy enough he has to testify publicly after being a close kinsman a pretty little integra after being upright men are pretty less if he's a marriage after being enough a rich public he has to testify publicly that is what you see when god says he was worthy to take the blame he was worthy of people because he testified publicly upon the kingdom of god before the coming of jesus personally even when jesus was resurrected when people went to see the truth they saw that the rock was the place it was empty was resurrected for years amen [Music] in most of the case they are not saved you'll find out that that person was called gold question what was gold means go well it was called gold oh tremendi in other words go well go ah satisfy attutela's existence he has met russia all the requirements of redemption he was a person that commits the requirement and the goal must be able only god could be a kingsman redeemer he says he'll never enter a prayer affair he must be willing to do it yeah he'll never eat an emperor there must be a kingsman and plush next to the king's movie to do it hey there is [Music] his problem is to make somebody fall you'll not force the relevant he has no strength to take him back a certain person he is himself he's a senior people say sovereign he cannot save himself that is why he has no rights by the one who never sinned and definitely not happened became our king's us now we are redeemed but he has not claimed his position okay let me jump this is i want to go with you in paragraph 134 foreign eh and that portion of land that's affected your body with money yeah and it took a witnesses and he says we're gonna have a contract unfair contact and when they made the lease he gave to barron he said you have to keep this list keep using the uh the vessel of focus which passes [Applause] the pedigree of adam amen that story of jeremiah say exactly my second year affair it's exactly [Applause] he was
