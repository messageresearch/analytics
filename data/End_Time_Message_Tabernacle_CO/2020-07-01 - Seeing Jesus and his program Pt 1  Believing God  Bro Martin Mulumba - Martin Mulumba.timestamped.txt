[0:19] welcome god bless you everyone
[0:31] Jib ministers happy to be on the house
[0:35] of the Lord Ksenia it's not necessarily
[0:56] the building it requires the spirit to
[1:05] be because without being in the house of
[1:10] the Lord as important to them as on DJ
[1:13] you can find yourself in the building we
[1:16] don't live anymore but the devil can
[1:18] take you like it took Jesus in Matthew
[1:20] if you made you fall in other places
[1:24] which is a domotic come down the good+
[1:27] he-man I mean I'd like to speak to night
[1:32] about faith but not in the traditional
[1:36] way upon in my own traditional the Lord
[1:44] will to give me the utterance today's
[1:48] you know if it's my identical eyes to be
[1:50] able to express what he has given unto
[1:53] me that amazing this chromatic in my DNA
[1:55] and for you also on your end to be able
[2:00] to receive it the work aquatic
[2:02] appreciate commented the reservoir
[2:04] so we can be able to help us along the
[2:06] way I think you said Masood Amedeo
[2:09] unconditional as we see the Day

[2:14] just approached yesterday the barrel is
[2:16] getting stronger
[2:17] Jojo about those on here but by his
[2:21] grace he has made it possible on to us
[2:24] to see the world my parks are Casa de
[2:27] Monte possibly Pune develop our because
[2:29] without would ask us on apparel will
[2:32] never be able to overcome on comm is the
[2:34] other banker we we see Jesus in made you
[2:38] fall the varnishes yumichika tuo he
[2:40] overcome with the world love and
[2:42] curricula power 7 mg that the word will
[2:47] defeat the devil kill apavarga van
[2:49] college I blew it at any time
[2:52] Alif and eaten at any time Dallas a zone
[2:57] at any place done important well
[3:01] whatever it may be in whatever situation
[3:03] then I podcast it just really makes you
[3:07] 17 Machida said no that system is not
[3:14] running basically system in Emmaus pas
[3:16] and I say they lived in OB blue and
[3:22] after six days Jesus taketh Peter
[3:27] Matthew 17 verse 1 a message is if Iraq
[3:34] Lybia you can see that six-day this this
[3:38] was the seventh day procedure associated
[3:41] with idioms oh and you can clearly
[3:44] understand that every time that you see
[3:46] the scripture speaking in a certain way
[3:51] those who live need time of Jesus they
[3:57] spoke about it regarding the time they
[3:59] will live in in its own probably they
[4:01] set up about it on TV they
[4:02] and we also Eddie and time I know Co
[4:05] Tony Rafa we speak about it as it
[4:07] applies to us today only power led to
[4:09] quash it not at all because Jesus Christ
[4:11] is the same yesterday today and forever
[4:13] secretly many hours or j-town almost
[4:16] does the key stone to the Bible Jesus
[4:18] lyrically principality blow you miss the
[4:21] Keystone whoo monkey-like a principal
[4:23] you'll be speaking of a historical Jesus
[4:27] mr. Haeckel after six days a procedure

[4:36] correctly pio sake John hope faith and
[4:40] love le soir
[4:43] love y el amor he takes these three
[4:45] things

[4:49] another dimension lon Don's not a
[4:51] demotion it goes at the end of the
[4:53] seventh age elephant is a to Mars his
[4:56] brethren and bring of them up into a
[5:00] higher mountain apart it men alacazam in
[5:04] autumn on time you can see that it's a
[5:06] in a different place awakens design on
[5:09] what you favor after a certain walk up
[5:12] when certain mouse he wanted to show
[5:13] them something greater than they already
[5:15] known shows the blue conquer the cities
[5:18] on the Taccone and was transfigured
[5:21] before them if it once we give it away
[5:23] as you remember when I preached the last
[5:26] sermon first December 31st 10 days on
[5:32] Isaiah was in the spirit is I hated on
[5:35] his pay John was in the spirit lead on
[5:38] his prey all of them did we lifted
[5:40] higher a to leave a plea or in a pas de
[5:42] place cause he not on her and this is
[5:45] the place where everything must be
[5:47] understood from I say see that you must
[5:49] support like a shock show's director
[5:50] complain and when you miss the place a
[5:52] come from Oak Island or I'll be able to
[5:54] see Jesus mezzo departures and his
[5:57] program a some cocom everything else you
[6:00] have ready you've been defeated a lot to
[6:02] identify key you bear with me the
[6:04] reading would be a longer paper long
[6:08] because after that we'll get to some
[6:10] other stuff and was transfigured before
[6:14] them and was transfigured before them if
[6:18] it wants to give a Devon a and his face
[6:21] did shine as the Sun as some visage
[6:24] responds he calmly Saleh and his raiment
[6:26] was like white as the light is if it's
[6:28] more develop Lancome Lynette but in the
[6:31] area that we have seen it in the Old
[6:32] Testament and Levon Aronian testimony
[6:34] see it in the middle of the Bible and
[6:36] over on salami I did IP and we have seen
[6:38] it also at the end
[6:40] a newborn celosia laughs Angela people
[6:42] and all this thing has never taken place
[6:44] in a very low dimension it so much I

[6:49] would have taken place taking place in a
[6:51] hired I don't see much Amplio this is a
[6:54] wonderful thing

[6:59] notes but the Lord is opening it my sin
[7:02] upon necessarily reversal did not manage
[7:04] a note on to the loove-ray oh thank you

[14:04] economy level now say they saw no man
[14:07] new person saved Jesus alone amen
[14:11] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[14:13] word want to talk to night one of things
[14:18] first the pastor the pastor I want to
[14:21] thank the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[14:24] because every time that for the last
[14:27] couple months the Moapa say for the last
[14:30] couple months
[14:31] last couple months l'amour passe he'll
[14:36] get their new more Papa say uh it has
[14:39] been on my heart that the Lord has
[14:42] predicted some stuff to happen okay
[14:46] listen y'all política shows they say
[14:47] passe and every time that we were coming
[14:49] on the pulpit it was always like you
[14:51] know this is not the time and this is
[14:52] not the time it's a velocity
[14:56] until until last week then we we had the
[14:58] confirmation like you know this was the
[15:00] time a just kinda Simon persons of
[15:02] consumers wanna talk about seeing Jesus
[15:06] and his program because the Tyrell
[15:09] enough for the subject or take believe
[15:11] in God well do because we can see here
[15:18] long voyage that you have to believe God
[15:21] they require everything
[15:22] that is telling you access to the new
[15:25] journey in your daily life what a joke
[15:28] what you must have to see Jesus Rousey
[15:31] some poker because when Jesus came to
[15:33] the disciples big to them he must talk
[15:36] to them about certain people certain
[15:39] truth to certain very certain things
[15:41] that we because they were walking with
[15:44] Jesus was this one moxie discipline
[15:46] because some of the people would come
[15:48] around necessarily if you said to me
[15:51] before Sultan Bazaar bread
[15:53] food fellowship testimony or they want
[15:57] ammonia sermon redesign all these things
[16:00] here shows but here now may Jesus now
[16:03] she is coming not to open your example
[16:06] something that was hidden quiet in
[16:09] elevation into high this is the time
[16:14] that we see invite that the time was
[16:17] approaching and it does occur in which
[16:19] the prophecy on a kelipah for which this
[16:22] man well I guess it was born on earth
[16:24] come to be fulfil the vessel continued
[16:27] as a you and I just come from a woman
[16:29] out of synergy bishop in iniquity coming
[16:32] into this world speaking line- a noisy
[16:35] professor on to my song but then by
[16:37] God's grace all across then when the
[16:39] light struck a corner in Africa then we
[16:41] started walking I don't have a combat
[16:43] this world allows it comes in two stages
[16:46] event on this every step of the way
[16:48] shock by assurance its own challenge a
[16:51] most proper in its own revelation and
[16:54] favela Daniel is allotted to the stage
[16:57] of the journey a secure message the
[16:59] discernment because we were that
[17:01] understanding the personal said compare
[17:03] every time that you met you you face an
[17:05] issue a shock what you're wondering come
[17:07] on sir I will just don't know what I was
[17:09] doing over there that's why it was
[17:11] necessary in situations to take the
[17:14] disciples in the pond and bring them up
[17:16] there I mean show them please
[17:20] and that's why it says that when they
[17:23] saw Jesus alone in services first nine
[17:26] person and they came down of from the
[17:29] mountain economy desandem on Jesus
[17:31] charged them saying don't you need Azhar
[17:33] tell the vision television this is the
[17:40] church say see l eglise you have people
[17:43] in the church the Verrazano agrees with
[17:46] the vision of a clear vision who sees it
[17:48] deliver who fight for it you can make it
[17:52] clear and explain it's just exactly as
[17:56] others yeah I hope they are dead so more
[18:00] because Matthew 13 much it is that many
[18:03] desire to hear and understand this thing
[18:06] is all said demotion from approach for
[18:12] most people
[18:13] Danielle Moses movies and the rest of
[18:17] them you know because they didn't know
[18:19] at what time this vision has to take
[18:21] process of if I cared more like vision
[18:23] so it is also in the life of the
[18:25] believer
[18:26] Arase tissued olivine times that people
[18:28] want about what's going on in your novel
[18:31] is also the most accessible
[18:32] what is he hub to artist the way she hub
[18:35] too hard also people shown like Peter
[18:41] yeah like James on shark who hold the
[18:44] mystery the secret and they say to whom
[18:48] these things are given I can assure
[18:49] Sandow name Amen and it is like a
[18:52] disciple asked him and he disappeared
[18:54] them on there saying this zone I know
[18:57] you don't see you don't you don't you
[18:59] not seen v as yet here but you I didn't
[19:04] say they say described said that aligns
[19:06] Allah Elias must first come on up on GOG
[19:09] who Kali
[19:10] disc a little phenom kami and Jesus said
[19:13] answered and said unto them a yoke upon
[19:15] don äôt
[19:16] Elias truly shall first come and if we
[19:19] leave Jim Kannamma
[19:20] and restore all things great ability and
[19:23] now Jesus now is started opening on to
[19:25] them
[19:27] dependency program
[19:30] how it's supposed to the unfolding
[19:32] almost a C+ every pose without having
[19:35] the vision I suppose in the vision it
[19:38] shows you the work
[19:39] Oscar than a vision of immortality shows
[19:41] you the steps it shows you what's going
[19:44] on and how you can refer to that you
[19:48] know exactly what it's going to do
[19:51] exactly mostly and what kind of attitude
[19:54] that you have to adopt a guys are better
[19:56] educated you don't have to manufacture
[19:58] your own with the apartment festival
[20:00] purpose but you have to take what is
[20:02] already said whether they were once the
[20:04] cat is a they did that sentence is very
[20:06] important for the rest of the service
[20:07] that passive because you find yourself
[20:09] in situations but then you know that
[20:13] this is the scripture service aesthetic
[20:15] but then if you do not adopt the
[20:17] attitude and the pepper that's written
[20:19] in the world on a pillar on bring
[20:21] something else I love sorry about the
[20:22] game machines are we showing them if you
[20:25] want to understand what is taking place
[20:27] composite you see if you want the fist
[20:29] of the tablet about now another word if
[20:32] you have them on the path of rain in the
[20:38] potential millennia not a millennium but
[20:40] you have to see first what has happened
[20:44] with alliance avec le because we don't
[20:48] knowing what has happened with Elijah
[20:50] photos that was the kiss episodic and
[20:52] then you won't be able to see what will
[20:54] take place if Amazon do not secure
[20:56] everything that will be taking values
[20:59] diversity for you it will be so strange
[21:00] as I see you adopt all kind of things
[21:03] you see in the Bible of Levi but what
[21:07] kind of attitudes that we have to adult
[21:10] this one doctor when we see these
[21:12] closures the shows
[21:13] that's be he believing God losses
[21:15] equivalency if you do not do this must
[21:18] not believe it and you'd like the
[21:20] movement of a per se but I say unto you
[21:29] that Elias is is already coming
[21:32] medically I deserve a knee and they knew
[21:35] him not in a non-pom economy but I've
[21:37] done unto him in your face who he's done
[21:41] it
[21:42] a the system that the people were they
[21:44] living with the system okay VA they were
[21:48] contemporary with a certain system
[21:50] morale is at a beach of exegesis reached
[21:52] a crisis assistance Democrats the
[21:54] Sadducees and the Pharisees defied
[21:57] visionaries at the same and they did
[22:00] unto Him whatsoever they listed in your
[22:02] fate to schism and now we're saying unto
[22:04] them here see likewise shall also the
[22:08] Son of Man softer of them you see they
[22:11] feasted on Vasu is showing them that
[22:14] look here again the things that Michelle
[22:16] coming shortly here after his Valley
[22:19] become do not be astonished is a
[22:24] positive name because look at what
[22:26] happened to Elias I see other cities
[22:28] across this is the anthem Elias that
[22:31] we're talking about because this Anthony
[22:34] Elias is a William Branham don't we let
[22:37] when you look at what has happened to us
[22:39] also understand this we shall also
[22:42] happen to deliver your privacy
[22:44] compensate verse if I select leepu's
[22:47] this is the same pattern they CL mmm
[22:49] O'Dell it's coming back again oh sorry
[22:52] I try my best just to hold the word but
[22:55] oh my god
[22:57] I try I try sometimes just to diversify
[23:02] but you know I'll just give you the
[23:04] testimony ammonia when when the Lord had
[23:07] given that song to me I I started
[23:12] wondering you know how humans yeah I
[23:14] started wondering like is there no other
[23:16] things like you know like the pardon and
[23:19] stuff more dead then the voice came to
[23:22] me they with the power ok slightly more
[23:25] dead then I repented Allah upon T then
[23:28] from that time on I don't even force it
[23:31] the false memory I can sit anywhere that
[23:34] I mean because you know the word has to
[23:37] be remain the word you cannot come up
[23:41] with some new stuff of your own episode
[23:43] everything like if it's the word the
[23:45] word you speaks the word cause the word
[23:48] revealed itself in seven lmmod bride
[23:51] detects the word and reveal itself in
[23:53] itself if we wanna prevent
[23:55] you cannot deport for me Salani de cèlle
[23:57] a man a man and and and he said look at
[24:02] what has happened unto them let the very
[24:05] onset you see look at Alliance the
[24:07] Jordanian why are we supposed to look at
[24:09] Alliance on the walk your baby remember
[24:11] I just wanted to use of innovation with
[24:13] a point a the Feast of the Passover la
[24:16] fête de la pack the unleavened bread
[24:19] depends on the van and the wave sheaf of
[24:24] the first fruits the premise though
[24:27] that's why the Bible is coming around
[24:30] he's showing us that in layers must
[24:33] first come and restore all these
[24:35] elements like a little revenue estimate
[24:37] three throws why to restore it was
[24:40] estimated sure layers must come and
[24:42] restore the after of pray lead revenue
[24:44] every stroke a hotel the Lapierre and
[24:47] when the altar of praise is restored
[24:50] Ethel appears and follows the fire
[24:52] allows relief ray because the fire takes
[24:55] place and the evening time must comply
[24:58] so at the time of the evening sacrifice
[25:00] a alternative sacrifice and when the
[25:02] evenings suffer in order for you to have
[25:05] the evening sacrifice whatever after the
[25:07] sacrifice desire in other words them for
[25:10] you to have Jesus on the scene with the
[25:13] Rogers Elias must first come the drop in
[25:15] your you cannot display simple
[25:18] mechanical every time that you see God's
[25:20] program for the world
[25:21] eNOS to that with the passion almost
[25:24] like the pattern for you to have the
[25:25] Passover that what a blue must must have
[25:27] Alliance have Moses are from rest why
[25:31] Jesus Christ the same yesterday two days
[25:34] will turn and on the mountain among cash
[25:37] to start with momentarily
[25:41] this is the Bible serum if everywhere
[25:44] you go about to lose a leg when you go
[25:46] in Exodus 20:5 oh thanks Kayla in the
[25:51] first half for first King 19 is
[25:53] sub-assembly widest nest about them I'm
[25:55] sure I'm just sparing me my dearest
[25:57] preserving them at some time there so I
[25:59] can at least like you know get to where
[26:00] one second then we see a way that when
[26:04] Elias come my living in layers must
[26:07] first come in order to restore all
[26:10] things restoration in order to restore
[26:12] the principles of the word which
[26:14] develops once destroyed the family's
[26:23] aesthetic because that the Roman and the
[26:28] systemic majestic is already destroyed
[26:30] everything we Shack showed but in order
[26:33] for you to receive the word again but I
[26:37] know how to become victorious madhavan
[26:39] is victorious must first and Jesus now
[26:43] is telling them back to Elias regards
[26:46] verily how did Elias work a camellia
[26:49] much why did he preach it Christopher
[26:51] William Branham says let's remember read
[26:54] webb says the baby $0.50 a pound because
[26:57] this is the true solution you hear from
[27:00] an obvious water for you to get back to
[27:02] where we will save the universe because
[27:04] remember whenever Peter said we want to
[27:08] be here at the Feast of the Tabernacles
[27:11] the last feast is it a down your feta
[27:14] and this is the end of the sixth day
[27:18] still a firm decision but then Jesus now
[27:22] is repenting the scripture houses
[27:24] everyone called the Medtronic retail
[27:27] also in order for them to understand
[27:29] that the walk I think it will be much
[27:33] easier it's a sacrifice to go to the
[27:35] airports in the van I'll move from here
[27:37] I can all do use my GPS you can use
[27:40] anywhere but never without the GPS on a
[27:45] map I won't be able to get you with
[27:48] promises jesus is making it plain
[27:54] that if this disciples took this word
[27:57] see the power only gave it to the rest
[27:59] of the leaders all of them will repair
[28:01] it is mostly all of them will we believe
[28:04] they shall be saved someone who is
[28:07] saying on to them they basically give
[28:09] tell no man what is on the city such as
[28:12] vision that's why a preach here is
[28:16] offensive coach appreciated the five
[28:18] requirements to receive the revelation
[28:20] saying excisions Perceval revelation
[28:22] that group that selected group is said
[28:25] group selection dancing that is able to
[28:28] hear from God and so on Mizzou Dakota
[28:30] did you dress as a period John and James
[28:33] are you go to our Cherokee Thomas Berman
[28:36] said like this is the man you need to do
[28:38] a launch of the vague that this is the
[28:40] way to walk it's now taking us button
[28:45] out to Elias you okay - not very we see
[28:48] that Elias is born in 1909 way not any I
[28:51] mean if sinus the Bible doesn't gives us
[28:53] that Lebanon try to say that I shall
[28:55] send you Elijah then huh shall you know
[28:59] that this is Elijah must all three two
[29:03] cheese's is giving them the keys out on
[29:06] that play for you to know Elias and to
[29:09] be second we thought the King even us of
[29:12] the law be able to know anybody can
[29:17] present itself to me that Haley but
[29:22] Jesus is being real precise so do you
[29:26] must see Elijah only Trinity Aleya it's
[29:29] okay tell you when you go back to the
[29:31] hotel you see what happened to
[29:34] electricity was wrong to the Eddie
[29:36] beginning of the new Ramos you see what
[29:39] happened to the second villager doesn't
[29:41] mean load the penny larger sorry Millie
[29:43] then when you come back to the end of
[29:45] the the New Testament to near offended
[29:47] on system then you see also another
[29:49] Elijah we're not in the same thing must
[29:52] happen again so that's the person call
[29:54] the semi traceable system must limit
[29:58] system this is Abaddon necessary at the
[30:00] same Roman system
[30:01] kill mmm system over the governmentís
[30:03] Appel so in this end time the boy struck
[30:06] him in the car we also Catholics the
[30:09] boys that killed him in the car we
[30:11] Catholics maybe have some kolache way to
[30:14] kill on shouid olive watch a little
[30:17] Catholic the same system the mem system
[30:21] it appears as as small as it is apparel
[30:25] complications are the elements that are
[30:27] very important to know CC this is
[30:30] important
[30:31] amen amen then the disciples understood
[30:34] the disciplic impaired if spake unto
[30:37] them of John Hill our pilot is only a
[30:40] man but because now we see along that I
[30:42] wanted to paint that picture like well
[30:45] now I'm speaking about Elijah and what
[30:48] is taking place in Rachel's life is a
[30:51] Palazzo we can be able to tie water food
[30:55] you know answer the audience is always
[30:57] you know mixed audience you know John's
[30:59] mix different people different stage and
[31:03] all the completeness by God's grace you
[31:06] know if when it is situated daughter and
[31:09] son of God if you should be able to
[31:12] catch some of this thinking about Elijah
[31:17] and it's not necessarily but yesterday's
[31:22] in apopka with the air but us this alone
[31:24] the new we're talking about the bright
[31:26] to be opportunity because what we have
[31:28] seen but the seconds are intentionally
[31:30] being done in the numerator Phaeton of
[31:33] the Prophet this prophet we shall see it
[31:35] being fulfilled also need a volleyball
[31:37] cause a complete only pose because
[31:41] remember but here the type of the bride
[31:44] they are desiring the feasts of the
[31:47] tabernacle read the tabernacle in other
[31:49] word but every desiring of the change of
[31:52] the body there's the only choice we do
[31:54] very often better world in which we are
[31:58] living in Jesus now is telling us demon
[32:01] look at how William Brown
[32:04] madoka mobium panama marche for you to
[32:07] have that feast cook yourself of Safed
[32:10] look at what he went through
[32:12] even the other cichlid understand bad it
[32:14] confirms they have the same attitude
[32:15] that he had because at the end does get
[32:19] a free was sit on the parallel universe
[32:21] see that if you don't look it was a
[32:23] different body it what she didn't want
[32:26] to go back in the purview of a tune a
[32:28] play in order for him to get there he
[32:31] had to believe God either
[32:33] everything that God was leading the
[32:35] oceans could unit rather say that's a
[32:39] Friday see Allah for God has put a
[32:42] program here me to focus bringing people
[32:44] out lightly showing them not to deal of
[32:48] event that the desire who wants test of
[32:52] this living greatest desire remained in
[32:56] the Holy of Holies even Aaron Pascal
[33:02] wanted to be to dwell in the presence
[33:04] the megadose that presence but then it
[33:07] was only allowed to him once a year is
[33:09] the Moto Guzzi but I'm here the toy see
[33:12] David in Psalm 27 levied of some very
[33:16] inspired also to remain in the palace
[33:20] but we are the living people in solution
[33:22] from this beginning of the right of the
[33:25] of the scripture for most modern
[33:26] Christmas day discusses you are looking
[33:29] unto that change you versus 11 remaining
[33:33] of the Lord 11 it is a shall not be a
[33:36] deeper ago before the those who are
[33:38] sleep different Collierville city but we
[33:40] shall be changed to be changed to help
[33:44] the Feast of the Tabernacles that the
[33:46] members believe God don't want you in
[33:49] what shall we believe God in don't want
[33:51] Evonik want you we have to watch alleged
[33:54] evocative it was when Elias comes and
[33:56] restores but if young history brings
[33:58] down the sacrifice to show that Jesus
[34:01] Christ is the same yesterday lays out to
[34:05] the world we don't have power the
[34:07] unleavened bread depends on the run had
[34:09] not
[34:09] remove Medfield on there you must eat
[34:12] Bassett unleavened bread service asleep
[34:15] rest on the van
[34:16] seven days it's a jewel and I'll at the
[34:18] end of the seventh day and after
[34:20] dissension they take the wave sheaf of
[34:22] college is a wave before I the vanu
[34:26] do sir is it making sense a set of it
[34:29] that slight scratch Jones they could
[34:32] tell amen amen
[34:34] then we see now a lot of iron man that
[34:36] now when we see a liar sort of an
[34:39] incoming into the scene he knows that he
[34:41] must come and restore all the nervous
[34:43] tension Elias has to go certain events
[34:47] he is going through a certainty because
[34:50] a certain sure he had to face the
[34:52] surface to desam system as am MC stem
[34:56] because the system must be system will
[34:59] come to you
[35:00] the over heaven here to every men a
[35:02] shock on his portion suppose you know
[35:06] because William Brennan say in the
[35:08] church age that I should regard as
[35:10] reserved the jack is a very portion of
[35:13] itself respond to everyone over a second
[35:17] in noon and we have to believe in you
[35:18] this on quarter it is a must say and
[35:22] because he that comes to God must be
[35:25] tested hooray without that something who
[35:30] I busted whose eternal form and a bad
[35:35] measure of suffering we saw Jesus with
[35:40] the cross of a clock or falling down
[35:43] before the sound with that mass of
[35:45] suffering we see Elijah running in the
[35:49] wilderness a googol of Arizona desert
[35:51] winter with damage of cell fragments we
[35:54] see layers were being beheaded a tone at
[35:58] wrong way decapitate the measure of
[36:02] suffering visitors and we have to
[36:04] believe along the warranty on sailor
[36:07] because that's the cost Vasquez a syrupy
[36:10] just like the poet said calmly pointed
[36:13] shall the rest of them ask you arrested
[36:15] throw into the heavens Allah say with
[36:18] blood
[36:19] suffering the song and me just on the
[36:22] better worse we know we have to go
[36:26] through later after the show that ships
[36:29] the correct item could it a little makes
[36:32] us because when we be walking in
[36:36] paradise for long luxury Chalet where
[36:40] did you get all this work we tried to
[36:42] suppressor where did you get all this
[36:44] was to try to see cicatrice
[36:46] this is believing God as the equivalent
[36:49] you not always the first brother up is
[36:53] gonna go well don't worry no you must
[36:57] believe buddies with warranty because
[37:00] the Jesus when when he came out of the
[37:04] money had to go straight to the part of
[37:08] the scripture that was laid before he
[37:12] complete that's why you must have got
[37:14] programs EEE go away you know the work
[37:20] is disliked him he will achieve a in
[37:25] other words so to tell you'll have to
[37:27] accept to the V accepted to be ashamed
[37:29] of our Auto to be lifted up that
[37:32] whenever in heaven an earth need

[37:42] the part of faith silk la parte de la
[37:45] for that if the conditions set condition
[37:48] that conditions set condition to

[38:07] program if you come did you you just
[38:10] coming and you making your own moving
[38:12] your own attitude discharge assisting me

[38:21] gives you in this program what if you do
[38:24] not come that way even coming in dead is
[38:27] it more because this is in Genesis was
