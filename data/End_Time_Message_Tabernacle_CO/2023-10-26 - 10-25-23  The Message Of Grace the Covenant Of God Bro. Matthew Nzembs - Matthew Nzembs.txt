tonight we came to your house want you look at each one of us your blood want you support us and come Lord Jesus be our Master oh Father help us we are in needy people if we see what's going on in Israel we can really understand there's no more time that's why we want to give you our bod our spirit so that we can say until here here God has supported us God support us all the the the the day and where we came from it's still far Lord and we don't know how much left how much left on this Ro we want to finish it with [Music] you I can understand the sacrifice in this end time that is doing for the people of God it's not easy [Music] father say if they ask me which age I wanted to live what I want to say I will choose this age because this Isen age to serve you in this age it's not an easy task but father you chose us to serve you what else can we do the only thing we can do is to surrender ourself we surrendering ourself to you may you start with us and may you also end with us oh wasn't it burning inside of us when you were talking to us along the way may you speak to us through your word may use me as your instrument through which and may that people be also the instrument that they will be [Music] listening may we lord Jesus Christ shut all those bad candels of and may you open the candels of the spirit so that yourself The Great I Am can talk to us when you speak to us there's Assurance father but when a man speaks there's confusion and death that's the reason why I'm asking tonight this is the time that we're going to spend in your presence may you speak to us oh this is the goal may you help us and fix where we need to fix so that we can fix it help the families that came tonight and they understand the purpose for which they came here so that they can become better surrendering everything into your hands we ask the pill of fire wars to be with us in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior amen amen may God bless you once again without delay you're going to read in Genesis chapter 12 1 to three for amen now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindr and from thy Father's House onto a land that will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curse thee and in the shall all families of Earth be blessed Genesis 157 7 217 this is the Lord that was speaking to Abraham AB for [Music] let's read seven and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of her of Cal to give thee this land to inherit and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherited and he said unto him take me an eer and three years old and he and the and she go of three years old and the ram of three years old and the turle Dove and the young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and led each piece one against another but the birds divided it not and when he F when the F came down upon the carcasses Abram thr drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and L oh an arrow of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abraham know of shity that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and Shall Serve serve them and and they shall afflict them 400 years and also the nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shallal go to to thy fathers in peace thou shal be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come here again for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full and it come to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking for furnace and the burning lamp that pass between those pieces for tonight the Lord is put in my heart something that I want to share with you I the and as the inspiration I want to talk about the um the Covenant of Grace and once again thank you Father thank you may be seated may God bless you let's pray God father God this time that we're going to spend in your house bless us with your word now help us and you know the desire of our hearts may you give it to us father and take us under your control and may your angels take this church under their control in the name of Jesus amen amen I want to ask you something may you really bear with me tonight sometime it's not easy to speak in front of big people like you are tonight sometime the Devil comes and fights you here and there but we know the Bible says we are overcome by the blood of Jesus am sometime we come to preach you the word we're not coming here to attack you it's like our pastor always says it sometimes someone can come with a subject but God knows the desire in the heart of people and God answers according to each our hearts desires and sometime people say why are you preaching like that do you think you're a pastor like Brother Richard said and I always believed it I'm don't I'm not saying that because the pastor is here I will say from the depth of my heart in this church the God cannot put someone two people the same level when God called the man of God he always give him a place to the Tower and there's not other man more spiritual than him when you also come here we're not coming to attack anybody but we always ask God to put something in our hearts that will bless people people sometime it can it can happen we can be inspired through his preaching it's really normal you can take Luke 6 verse 40 Luke 640 may you watch what the Bible says the Bible say the disciple is not above his master perfect shall be as his master it's very deep a disciple cannot be above his master by a disciple will fulfill will be as his master he can also do the work that his master does that's even the age of adoption let's go to Zechariah Chapter 4 zear chapter 4 verse one the Bible [Music] says and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me up as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me what's his d and I said I have looked and behold a candle stick all of with a bowl upon the top of it and seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven l L which are upon the top and two olive trees by it upon one upon the right side of the bow and uh and he said so I answer and spake to the angel that talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what this be and I said no my Lord then he answer and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerob say not by might nor by power my spirit said the Lord of host who are thou oh great Mountain before zerel that shall become a plane and it shall bring forth The Headstone [Music] thereof crying crying Grace Grace unto it verse two and said unto me what is that and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick of all gold with a bowl upon the top of it and is seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof John first uh chapter one verse 14 and the world was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory uh with glory and Truth full of grace and truth we have behold his glory the glory as the only begotten of the Father John bear Witness and Christ saying this was he he that comes after me and of his fullness have all we received and Grace for Grace I was I was thinking when the pastor preached about Grace and blessings something like that and the pastor talked about the scripture that the prophet took in that message the prophet is talking about his story I'm not going to read all of it if you have time you can go and read it brother is talking in the the Day of Victory paragraph 55 there's a boy that committed a crime I don't know if you heard about it or not he committed a crime and they put him in C and uh and the jury was supposed to come and said we have discovered that this man needs to be punished and the jury said and we claiming his life and the judge said we are condemning you they're going to uh they're going to hang you so that your uh the life will your body and may God have mercy to your soul 56 and they pleaded for the boy so that they won't do it and after a while the governor of the state the matter of the boy went to see the governor she cried she we so that they can let her in after while the man came he say Mr Governor the mother of this boy is looking for you she she want to see you and the governor say let her in and the woman in humility crawled on her hands and feet up to the governor and took a hold of his shoes and said sir that's my child don't kill him don't kill him is the only one that got don't kill him say it didn't mean to do that just give him life in prison but don't take his life Governor the governor said well I'll go down and see him said all right what says so the governor went down to the word uh to the world word where he was the boy wanted to be arrogant they told him got someone to see you here and the governor went in and said young man I'd like to talk to you say he got real arrogant just sit down button up wouldn't say a thing he said young man I want you to speak speak to me I want to talk to you and the boy just acted like he didn't even here he said young man I can help you if you let me he said get out of here I don't want to hear nothing you got to say he said well son he said shut up don't you see I'm service I don't want to hear one word you're going to say he said well I come he said get out this so he walked out they closed the doors what says 59 159 so when he went out the police guy that was there he told the that you are the you are the foolish man or insane man that I've known you he told him he said who was was knocking on the door he told him that was the governor the state Governor no he said we no not the governor you see the the only man that can forgive me and I told him to get out of myself cell the only man that can pardon me and I told him to get out of my when the governor went out he said he made his choice if you notice everything that we do we have to make our choices it's true and the last word of that man when they put the Black Mask over his face to hang him when they pull the Rope up and tied put the mask over him he said think of it during that time his conscience starting to talk to him and the governor stood in my cell and have pardoned me if I hadn't turned him down says we can also reach a certain situations when someone can Inspire someone to speak to us we reject it and also we can reject our Grace and the the the guy said the boy said think about it the governor stood in my cell and brother said tonight there's a governor who's more than all the governor amen is the Lord Jesus Christ he is in your cell tonight is in front of your heart can't you listen to him can't you receive him can't you speak speak to him he is the king of kings and that Governor can take a form of a brother he can take a form of a sister he or she can tell you brother sister why are you behaving this way the pastor after many series about curses and blessings God who knows how to lead his service we bring him and say reconcile yourself but some people would not want to reconcile with others it's very painful you can reject Jesus Christ in your life for the last time and says when the grace is presented to you if you're not receiving that Grace but Grace that Grace becoming a disgrace how do we know tonight that the governor is not standing by our it was in the morning there when you preached but tonight I'm talking don't turn him away if you haven't never Reed not only the governor the king the only one who can pardon you he may be standing by that little that you've been living in for a long time why don't you just let him in if you haven't haven't done it if you haven't made a complete surrender to him somay you'll find out that this little humble way that you might think is just a bunch of a bunch of people that don't know what they're talking you'll find out the governor is here tonight amen the in zear where we just read there's something that really struck my heart with this great servant of God he said zear 41 he said the angel that spoke to me came back and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep you know when someone is sleeping it's very hard to control yourself and he said he said unto me what SE thou and I say I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and there seven lamps and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top there on he said the cand represent the seven ages seven Church ages what saying something in the message of Grace but says we all know this scripture we are Bible readers we knew it was a time of preparation of building the temp zel was a great Chief among the people they have put the um foundation of the build building and now now you will notice that is asking I want you to cover up yourself with a spiritual understanding while I'm [Music] speaking saying this great Chief had a touch to build a a temple and when he was doing it the one that uh put the first stone when we read far and we see that God said the hands of Z put the first stone he will he will also put the the cup Stone and I also want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth the headone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cor and it's also The Headstone yes now if we if we will think for a few minutes says was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by by my spirit said the Lord not by organization not by denomination God will bring forth the church in the last days in this last days God didn't send him to build churches when they talk about churches they see building God has brought him to build individuals now according to the prophecy he said The Headstone will come I want you to notice when the head com the chief that will proclaim the mess will say Grace Grace Grace because it's by grace that we are saved say it's not by our work so that nobody will puff up the message of Grace has been tramped under the feet until it's become a disgrace when you reject the message of the hour that becomes disgrace for you some of them runs out of uh some runs in everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same amen and there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the it's the grace of God that we are all saved by and now the deity of Jesus Christ if the Lord God could come here and confirm that that is the truth not only that but by his word confirms it's the truth and by signs and wonders he confirm it's the truth then also Grace is the truth amen my beloved brother and sisters the grace is the truth why then why could anyone criticize and say that Grace is wrong that we saved by works we are saved by grace that true faith not by works works shows that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God works it's what you do to show appreciation of what God did for you by grace are you saved some people thinks because I go join a church I put my name on the book that's all I have to do some people think because I shout that's all I have to do all those things because I speak in Tong that's all I have to do some things because I got power to that's all I got to do it's not the grace of God that God's Amazing Grace I cannot trust in any merits some said oh oh there's a great man that man I've heard him stand up and do this I've heard him stand up and do that Paul said in 1in 13 though I speak with tongue of men of angels though I have discernment though I have gift I take all my goods to feed the poor though I can move mountains with to understand all things I am nothing till love comes in which is Grace amen God has to do it you can do all these things and still be lost that's right it's Grace that saves you God's grace to the human think about him amen says I was thinking of that immediately after that appear Friday morning just at the break of day up there in that field when I said at the L later and later on tears come down in my eyes say I told oh God Your Grace has stoed to save me why did you ever have such pity theate rich like me how did you ever come down to our humble little Tabernacle people of low Walk of Life poor have nothing of this world and still your grace PR in our heart by the holy spirit that you heal our sickness our people so that you can treat with us deal with us and then I I thought about David when he had the idea to build a a uh Temple for for the Lord he said it's not right for me to leave in the house of Cedar I'm just putting a foundation and the Ark of the Covenant of my God under shipin under ship skin and the Tabernacle God told the prophet go tell my servant David I took him from the ship from feeding them few sheep out there your daddies and I thought about the grace of God and how did he do that to the uttermost and then will take a PO like myself and give me the opportunity to preach the gospel and to see others saved see them healed see homes have been broken up straighten up again see lives that been ruined made right again and to give me Grace I thought oh it's amazing grace then come to a degraded L scur Hunter out into the woods and from himself in the form of the red which means a covenant with a message that he gave me to preach and form it there in a covenant that is behind it it be behind it because the message is of Jesus Christ and His glory this message that you believe in is the message of Jesus Christ it's not the message of brother BR it's not a message of a man it's a message of God himself amen says it's not not by knowledge it's not by theology it's by the spirit of God that it's a spirit of God that heal people it's the spirit of God that gives the message to people it's the spirit of God that confirms the word but you have to have humility in God so that his word can be manif show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you have to have a humble heart and you have to be consecrated to God to bring God in the prison time amen what says you have to have a humble heart a humble that's consecrated to bring Jesus Christ in the present time we are not Liv believing in the Jesus Christ the Jesus Christ of 2,000 years ago we believe in Jesus Christ in the present tense is the same yesterday today and forever says if we have to get theology what are we talking about Methodist and Baptist Catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a chance as poor unlearned people I'm saying if God could choose Great Men great theology andian all the Pentecostal where could we find ourself unlearned people but it's only his grace and I believe that that same Grace is here tonight look what the grace of God has done for us the grace of God gave us this message a glorious message the grace of God gave us the pastor a grace of God gave us this place where we can come and worship and pray without any problem what are we doing of this place uh last [Music] Tuesday there's a few Pentecostal people that came to here that came to uh to the burial of brother Champ's mothers when they came here they came here they started you know visiting our place talking to his I don't know his brother or sister he said oh our pastor they're taking our money they're not doing he said look at pastor fost but sometime we don't understand the grace that God has given us you have a place where you can worship when you have problems you can leave your house you can come here even spend the night but how many people come here and spend the night how many times people come here to pray the grace that God has given to you it hasn't been given to anybody else everybody says God didn't go to the high priest unless would have been condemned by him but he took a Sinners poor people who were living ordinary Liv and he revealed himself to them and said follow me I make you fishes of men so that his grace still reach down even to call the people for his name in this last days as we just been true it Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound the grace of God is old Grace is as old as the world Grace was first shown to the to the human race when we had the beginning of the human race when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dark morning when the little woman had stepped across the sep and had gone against God's commandment and her husband to do the same thing then the law was broken the law must have a penalty or it isn't no law Prophet said the day that you eat thereof that day you shall trly die that's why God told to Adam and Eve says now remember and remember this remember this and keep it remember the first judgment seat was upon the Earth and it was in the Garden of Eden says and the last judgment seat will be uh the the white Throne will be upon the Earth at the end time amen that's really deep in Genesis chapter 15 where we just read Bible says the Lord talk to Abraham I am the one that took you from Earth C to give you this land to inherit it says uh in our God in his thought he has laws says he said the first law is the law of death he said the second law is the law of life and there's also many other laws that God has said the law of seed or the law of reproduction there's also another law it's the law of uh impunity the law of seed it's the law that depending on your choice so if you go and and you're going to get you're going to have corn back it depends on your choice if you do good you're still going to have good back it depends on your choices but there's a Cho there's a law of impunity and that law of impunity God doesn't Let It Go by you know later sooner or later that La will catch up to you examp example uel host me in his house I go and and abuse his his children and I go and uh repent myself to God God will not leave me that way God will punish me because of the ACT but host me to his house and I'm starting flirting with brother emanuel's wife the god of Heaven won't leave me that way one day when I will be married someone someone else will come this is the law of impunity God doesn't leave that law just like that regardless of repentance God will not leave the law of impunity go VI remember what happened with David David went and took B you know what God Said God severely punished David look what happened in David's house what God he is that's why you have to remember you you have to always think before doing anything says in the place of God worship that God paragraph 24 I'm saying deom means two lows the word Deuteronomy and God is two lows one is the law of death by Disobedience to the word if you disobey to the word of God that law will catch up to you we see that Eve disobeyed to God's word and that brought death it's one of his laws the day that shall you shall die and he also has another law it's the law of life by obedience what am I telling you tonight you have to obey to the word of God to live if you don't do this or that and then if you if you observe his word or you keep his word you will leave says you say according to me that it's coming to two things either You observe or you keep his word or or you disobeying his word one of his was given in the mount and one was given that one that law that law was the law of death the other law was given to the Mount of calvary that's where the law of life was given by Jesus Christ it's that it's according to that law that I want to talk about the law of Grace it also has two covenants he made a covenant with Adam the first man that lived on Earth and that Covenant was conditional if you do this or that I will do this or that for you Adam had to do certain things in order to maintain this he had to work in God's way he had to keep all his words to not disobey one of his words but he also did another Covenant that one was with Abraham that Covenant was not abiding with but the Covenant was unconditional God gave the Covenant to made the Covenant with Abraham without conditions it was an unconditional covenant not that I will do I I already done it it's through that same Covenant that the Christian should live by it a Christian should live by the Covenant that God has made AB it's not depending on what we do it's regarding what he has done for us the only thing you should do is to believe him is to believe what he has done Christ was already sacrificed it's not that he will do he already been sacrificed it's already a done work God cannot do a work without being accomplished God will always do etal work a Grace to have a God Like Jesus Christ he has lived he he died and resurrected he went on Earth and came back in the form of of the Holy to live inside men or Believers what a Grace says it's a work done Christ who didn't know sin he became a he became sin so that I can take his place he took my place I was with him when he died I had to die there with him so that I may as the law of death and life is inside the body you have to so that you can be reconciled with him amen it's not concerning what I'm going to do it's not according what my dead is done it's because of his grace because he took my place amen says he said the faithful Abraham says he say observe this watch this he said this little umer he said those goat and all those uh he said three different species he said the pure sacrifices he said those little pigeon and ABR took all those animals and cut them into two and put them towards looking at each other but the pigeon he didn't cut that says that means that the healing is already there the dispensation will change he say the the Divine Healing will never change it's already abiding with your faith you see he said don't cut the pigeon he said the the the sacrifice the and everything else and the sickness it's the same thing it's always rest upon fa your own faith and then and when Abraham done it and he said when he has done he said all those uh um and starting to mess up with those sacrifices and Abraham cast them out until the down the day and now listen they had three elements they had they were threaten there were Darkness there where Abraham was and after a while he saw a great furnace and after that he saw flames and what that was represented that little FL was going through all those little pieces of sacrifice confirming the Covenant of ABR there's nothing that Abraham has done amen that was the grace of Covenant for Abraham without condition not because you want says it's what I've done not that if you do or if you do this it's what I've done what I've already done that's what he will do he will show in Christ showing the sacrifice just a moment I'll get to it first the darkness that's death every man though I walk through the valley of shadow of death next a smoking furnace that's hell where every sinner belongs but after that comes a little light oh God grace Amazing Grace lighting up the way making a covenant well you say I don't see the Covenant all right here it is now before closing let me say this listen close now if you want to see whether it's it's by Grace or not what I'm say and then here's the Covenant between God and the church he showing how he's going to do that with Christ he put Christ to Calvary BR to Calvary and there in Calvary it has the the Earth was going to Darkness and there were a lot of uh tunders gruning and everything God took the body of Christ and uh uh cut it into two the type of sacrifice that Abraham had amen amen and the the Covenant the posterity of Abraham the Glorious son of the great son of Abraham and T it apart and pulled the spirit out and took it away and sent the spirit into hell bearing our sins body on the third day lifted it up and set it on the right hand of God and send the other piece of the Covenant the Holy Ghost down on the church hallelujah hallelujah that's it am amen that same spirit that that was in Christ to be in the church the same holy ghost that dwelt in Christ DW in us and when the Rapture comes them two pieces has to come to the church that Christ died for says all your denominations won't mount to that your little differences and and so forth of baptism forward he said say will not get you anywhere says if God has said it that's the Covenant that God he uh split Christ he split Christ and took his took body and set it on the right side of and sent the other part of the Holy Ghost down to the Earth to baptize the church with the same Faith give them the same faith that he had give them the same work that he accomplished you do the same work as well when Christ died on the cross said oh my father everything has been done all your sicknesses all your problems God has taken to Calvary it was the uh the work of Grace it didn't depend on what you were doing I always uh putting a foundation talking paragraph 56 now a complete separation with unbelief and uh remember Abraham ABR wasn't completely blessed if he didn't fulfill completely what God has told him and never never we will be blessed and we have blessings if we don't obey to what God has told us to [Music] do if you want to be blessed if you want to receive blessings you have to obey to what God has asked you to do say another thing I want you to notice in chapter 12 of Genesis where we read said that Covenant was unconditional God is not giving you a covenant with because you are uh um the because you are the posterity of Abraham when God gives you the Covenant give you a covenant without conditions what a Grace to have a God Like Jesus Christ says it was without conditions he say I not if you and if was excluded because I already done it he said I gave the Covenant to Abram that now you know with the covenant made with it was if you don't then I will do this but but if you touch it then I would have done this you see that was uh resting upon and with this Covenant with the Covenant of Abraham I already made you a father of a multitude of people and he said he uh this Covenant is unconditional this covenant What Covenant is it says it is Grace it's a Grace in his Purity Grace it's nothing the only thing that he want he was supposed to do to keep that Covenant is to stay in the land and then all the blessing attached to the Covenant will be following him the only thing he has to do was to stay in the land and then we are noticing they went to Egypt and they lost their blessings say when the children of Israel went from Canan to egy that's where they lost their blessings when you leave the message of the hour and then you go to the world that's why you're going to lose your blessings you know the little advice I have for everybody stay in the message of the hour stay in the message of the hour it's to accomplish or to fulfill what the the message is asking us to do and then we won't lose our blessings they lost their blessings but not that's a good news for you tonight you may have lost your blessings but your Covenant is still with you the Covenant was still with them they lost the blessing but not the Covenant because the Covenant was the grace without condition your Covenant it's Grace without condition says and exod chapter 19 I'm not going to read it it say Israel made one of the greatest they've never done before when they refus Grace and accepted law look what Grace has done Grace and look what Grace Grace and furnish them a a deliverer and said and watch what Grace had done great opened the Red Sea for them great given them deliver Grace had brought them a prophet with a pillar of fire and that same Grace has come tonight look at what the Grace has done Grace has given us a major prophet a powerful Prophet not because of our might by his spirit said the Lord say given them a prophet and given them a deliverer Propet and give them a great prophet with a pillow of fire to V and then there was a sacrificial lamb Grace had give them a great Revival Grace had brought them through open up the Red Sea brought them across that deliver them with signs and wonders all by grace but they wanted something so they could make themselves some big names now that's just isn't the people today it's just the same thing they got to they got to be man man has got to get itself involved somewh there is where that Israel made it great when he rejected Grace and instead of that they took the law and then still by the Covenant was still unconditional it's still the same thing today the Covenant that God has made with you it's an unconditional Covenant Abraham was a great prophet of God but he went through many trials said the trials in the Christian life means that God trust when God sent that means god is trusting and that was the condition of job God has sent Tri to job because in your only job was supposed to Bear those trials and tonight God is sending because you are the only one that can bear it not another person not the prophet but the grace of God in this end time has given us a prophet with the pit of fire said the P of fire it's always to vindicate that it is the true Prophet this message is the truth it's the message coming from God David regardless of his mistakes regardless of all his done the grace of God was always with him that's what I like with our God he said David it's not you is going to build a temple for but I promise hi the Lord I will give you a house and brother say the temple that God has promised to David was not a a building made by human hands that's why when Jesus talk in John 14 he said in my in my in my father's house there's many uh there's many mention and brother say I don't believe that there in [Music] Heaven There are buildings made in bricks I don't believe that Immortal beings can live in humans in in houses made by hum but God has promised us a house a place that means a body and to go inside that body we have to be prepared we have to change our Ro like God has T Moses to the children of isra change their so that I the God would speak to them what a Grace to have a prophet he's showing us things that we didn't know before [Music] things that out to be the prophet says in the [Music] beginning in the beginning of the world when God and took the uh took the waters from the earth as is DED in the sea a world was created what says yes and people started to live in it after God has placed it and there they started to sin and they were baptized in immersion in Noah's time and they was sacrificed through the blood uh of the Creator who uh was given and then it's through that way that you came to justification believing in God you were baptized so that after repentance for the remission of your sin you have repented to Christ to God and he has forgiven you and you've been baptized to show that you had that you had been forgiven confessing to people and showing to the world that you believe that Jesus Christ died for you and he took your place and now you stand in his place he became you that you might become become him what a Grace God Of Heaven he left heavens and came to become a sinner so that you can become a holy or a holy person what a great news amen the message of Grace God Of Heaven then the sanctifying power cleans all the habits of your life and take out all those habit you used to smoke drink do things that wasn't right everything and the sanctifying power of the blood of Jesus Christ comes into your life and takes all the things away from you if you happen to say something that wrong or something that's not wrong and you say wait a minute pardon me I didn't mean to say like that see the devil got TR but if you're a true Christian you have the grace to come up to yourself and say I was wrong yes now now the next thing that you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire now God when this Millennium is over God is going to give the world a baptism of Fire it's going to blow the whole things up it's going to blow the whole thing up says and you will say wait a minute forgive me I wasn't supposed to say says oh 65 he said this whole world Must Fall because he come through sex he come through disobedience in the beginning was born here to sex to the [Music] fall and he must go right back the same way but the one who is trying to prepare now can fall is making it so says what if what if we just had to stay in this kind of body ex aren't you glad there's such a thing as congregation says amen Now isn't it strange isn't it strange but now say for instance a few years ago I was a little boy and now I'm a middle-aged man I got a friend sitting right here Mr and is 93 years old a few days ago look at him now now 40 or 45 years years that will be me now put another 40 years on him where would you go think a little bit brother says he say example here brother Walter how old is he give him another 40 years he say after 40 years where would it be he has to go somewhere what does it mean we're coming from somewhere and we're going somewhere and to go that place we have to to have a God will send us a message and that message will show us the way that that me will show us the way and the way that God has shown us today it's Malachi 4 it's William Bram is the one who knows the way is the one who knows and God is the way that he prepared and that way is called the way of Grace regardless of your condition regardless of your situation God has provided a way the grace uh unconditional Grace uh the grace of God it's brought us from the world has made us what we are today what a Grace oh he left many people great people on in the world and came to redeem us what a Grace that's the reason why brother says Grace is graceful for someone we receive it as a Grace amen I think I have to stop sometime I will prepare many things and sometime you don't have enough time God knows everything receive the grace said that Grace is Grace when you receive it as such says the same camels that uh Rebecca water it's the same camels that brought him to his house to her house the same message that you will take with value is the same message that will take you home you have to be ready there's no more time live like you're going to live for only 10 more hours left live a Pure Life speak about Jesus Christ and work speak about Jesus Christ and the same God who gave Grace to Abraham he going to give us the same Grace may God bless you the lord it's a message of Grace and that's all that we are uh it's really a very complex uh topic uh but I want to help you as you go home for your personal study yeah brother Matthew took uh Genesis chapter 15 uh this is the fifth time God was dealing with Abraham uh he started in Genesis 12 asking him to leave and uh Genesis 133 still Genesis 12 he came second time in a vision and later on he asked him to be separated with lot and uh Genesis I believe the next chapter uh I think 14 uh this is where after the fight he received a he gave communion but in Genesis 15 that was the fifth time God dealing with [Music] Abraham and in that fifth time it was God now willing to give a confirmation of the [Music] Covenant and uh in the old time to give a confirmation uh they used to take like a piece of paper they cut in two you keep one I keep one that's the confirmation but in case of Abraham the way God did it he told him to bring three beasts plus two birds the three Beast where the the Hyer Hyer R and the goat and he told them to cut the three animals to cut them and to put them side by side but he could not cut the bird the toal Dove and the pigeon because they two represent Divine Healing and you cannot cut Divine Healing but only the three animal as he cut them in two you have to put them side by side and wait until till the night the dark which is the type of death and then then when the other birds come to eat Abraham is chasing them because that was the kind of confirmation of the Covenant I don't want to go further because of the time anyway I think I was understanding it more than I believe most of the people that's why I give you this little summary and if you can take the message Jehovah where explaining the those animals and the the darkness coming and then the light came this is is the type that after death there will be a resurrection Etc that was the sign God gave to Abraham through those animal cat cut that this is how you we were separated how Christ was cut at the calvary Etc I think for your own benefit you can go home and study it you will understand really the confirmation of the [Music] Covenant because with Abraham it God wanted this time to confirm the Covenant he had with Abraham and that's why it was those animal bird etc etc so let us stand on our feet and uh bow our head each one to speak a little word based on what you have learned what you want God to help you do in your life to realize your confirmation of the grace that you have received this message is a message of Grace all that we are it's Grace and let us thank him for the grace he has given to us [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
