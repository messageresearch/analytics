to be so but you have blood on your hands you have a [Applause] product [Music] who did you fire I said you mischaracterized 37% of teenage girls between 13 and 15 were exposed to unwanted nudity in a week on Instagram you knew about it who did you fire Senator this is why we're building all who did you fire TOS Senator that's I don't think that that's who did you fire I'm not gonna answer that um because you didn't fire anybody right you didn't take any significant action it's appropriate to talk about like decisions do you know who's sitting behind you you've got families from across the nation whose children are either severely harmed or gone and you don't think it's appropriate to take a talk about steps that you took the fact that you didn't fire a single person let me ask you this let me ask you this have you compensated any of the victims sorry have you compensated any of the victims these girls have you compensated them I don't believe so why not don't you think they deserve deserve some compensation for what your platform was done help with counseling services help with dealing with the issues that you're your services caused our our job is to make sure that we build tools to keep people safe are you going to compensate them Senator our job and what we take seriously is making sure that we build industry-leading tools find harmful cont take it off the services to make money and to build tools that Empower parents so you didn't take any action you didn't take any action you didn't fire anybody you haven't compens s let me ask you this let me ask you this there's families of victims here today have you apologized to the victims would you like to do so now well they're here you're on National Television would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been harmed by your problem show them the pictures would you like to apologize for what you've done to these good [Applause] people through the things that your have have suffered and this is why we invested so much and are going to continue doing industry leag efforts to uh to make sure that no one has to go through of things that youres you know why Mr Zuckerberg why should your company not be sued for this why is it that you can clim you hide behind a liability Shield you can't be held accountable shouldn't you be held accountable personally will you take personal responsibility Senator I I think I've already answered this I mean this is these try this again will you take personal responsibility Senator I view my job and the job of our company is building the best tools that we can to keep our community safe well you're failing it well Senator we're doing an industry-leading effort we build a i tool nonsense your product is killing people will you personally commit to compensating the victims you're a billionaire will you commit to compensating the victims will you set up a compensation fund with your money I think these are these are with Senator these are complicated no that's not a complicated question though that's yes or no will you set up a victim's compensation fund with your money the money you made on these families sitting behind you yes or no Senator I don't think that that's my job is to good tools my my job is make sure that your job is to be responsible for what your company has done you've made billions of dollars on the people sitting behind them are you here you've done nothing to help them you've done nothing to compensate them you've done nothing to put it right could do so here today and you [Music] should thank you uh May maybe you don't understand what is taking place uh that was a discussion in the court that uh uh yeah Senate yeah that Mark zberg Mark zberg who is the CEO of uh Facebook director the the Facebook he was responding to uh the Senate people who realized that many teenagers have been victim of his product those application Facebook Instagram Tik Tok Facebook Instagram Tik Tok Snapchat does the CEO when they P the uh launch those product they don't allow their own children to use them but who are using it it's on the public and they are making they are billionaires but who are the victim are the children that's why I saw uh the Sunday school teacher teaching the [Music] teenagers I said why don't I want to share a little bit with even the parent you know it's all about business money even if they take them to Congress they cannot stop them it's like when this is the technology of today it's like telephone it's like television back then it caused more disaster than we have today but nobody has stop it uh I saw they are teaching the young people you know this this this but one thing I want to report all this is the devil sitting behind it's the devil Congress cannot stop the devil the only thing they ask Mark is to apologize to the victim uh the families there are children who have died who have been abused who have disappeared do you think a apology is going to solve the problem so that's why I'm talking to the teenager to the parents those applications is intended to destroy your life and I believe the church we have also a certain responsibility but the CEO they will not arrest him because he's saying he's acting because he he has the freedom of expression which is the basis of our democracy so the only thing to fight the devil is the word of God that's why I want to read a little bit few quotes here uh brother bam said in the message the world is falling apart paragraph 43 so we don't not we don't want to take it lightly or our teenager are on Tik Tok they say jokes no it's a spirit behind and it's not only teenagers they are also adult watching what they supposed not even to watch it's not only about pornography all the things you see young people communicating Tik Tok Instagram with unknown people and then they come and invite you to meet somewhere is the end of your life uh one paragraph 43 brother bam said and we see the Nations today our political and Nation life is roten to the Core Congress will not do anything it's all full of things or of Television corruption all kind of dirty filthy jokes and gags and before our young people the schools are so corrupt my I'm from Arizona I was at one of the big school other day and see those young ladies and men boys out there on the campus Waring around I said I hope I never have to send one of my children to place like that and such corruption yet called America some of the worst I have ever seen is behavior of American in different part of the country in the message one in a million Bram said just let me give you a little inside something they have made a analysis throughout Arizona where I [Music] live of all the schools they gave the children unknowingly to them a mental test they give them a test without them being aware and guess what including high schools and grammar schools uh I'm On One in a Million paragraph 45 yeah guess what including high schools and grammar schools there was 80% of children suffering with mental deficiency 70% of them was television Watchers back there it was the instrument was television today it's not television too much it's the telephone with all the modern applications Tik Tok Instagram WhatsApp [Music] see see the evils they just sleeped up on us slipped up on us they have get evil has found room in [Music] US last one influences par six so we cannot just be happy to send our children to Sunday school which is good but to follow up maybe take those uh quot no there those quot with uh [Music] Senators what over they are debating they are debating but the end result is known it will be just we noticed it we said it [Music] but influences paragraph six influence I think today our great problem of what we believe to be juvenile delinquency is a parent delinquent a home delinquent our people got away from the things that they should have stayed with the church got larm or cold the children got out in the world now Hollywood puts out lots of movies and [Music] televisions they talk about Hollywood but today it's all those CEO creating those things have you ask yourself this question where they get all those ideas this uh Mark zuk andberg he a young person but where he get intelligence to create the things he's defending himself it's a tool to connect people it's a tool to promote businesses so everything we do as a good side and the bad side I did not put your children to what to do this evil I'm a business person I'm looking for ideas where do those idea come from Satan is somewhere creating those things to destroy our youth generation the future of tomorrow if we don't see the devil back there we cannot take any action and he said Hollywood uh puts out lots of movies and television and so forth that even uncensored where they curse and use God's name in vain and it used to be it was wrong for the children in the Holiness churches to go to uh bioscop or picture shows and now Satan got One Jump Ahead head brother I'm just taking quotes from the time of brother Bram and try to make it actual today to show you that Satan is getting a jump ahead business will follow the connection to give all those arguments but the person ahead of everything is Satan and please young people stay away from those application and us as a church and parent let us take it to our heart to pray for our Young Generation may God bless you so this morning we are going to have uh Pastor uh foran cumo from Boston massachusett who will uh bring the word to us if we can stand uh uel give us that song [Music] God will not reject your pray praying make you stronger I have never seen the righteous forsaken begging for prayer all left to suffer have patience just wait I see what can we do for you when

think about our great [Music] victory if it wasn't for that day that Sunday morning what happened about 2,000 years ago we wouldn't be here and when we come on Sunday morning we think about the greatest victory that never been won that is what makes us because we were lost without hope but somebody that was righteous he accepted our burdens our Pains come and support us people hopeless like us now we don't have any reason to worry no reason to worry to complain because the cross was done for us that is why we sing that is why we gather together because there's a hope because the Hope was there and we received it that is why we come we don't come here as people defeated no we come here because the calary did everything nobody can accuse you nobody can tell you otherwise Paul says even if an angel comes down and tells you what God didn't tell you reject there's no one that can tell you other because the blood was shed that is why we sing I'm happy and I also thank the pastor for

Amos chapter [Music] 3 just as a background of what I'm going to say I'm going to ask the brother to read from the first till the verse uh8 hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you all children of Israel against the whole the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the family of the earth therefore I will punish you from for all your iniquities can can two work together except they be agreed will a lion roll in the forest when he has no prey will a young lion cry out of of his den if he has not taken nothing can a bird fall in the snare upon the Earth with where no gin or is for him shall one take up the snare from the from the earth and have taken Nothing At All Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall they be evil in the city and the Lord has not done done it surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servant the prophet eight the lion as Roth who will not fear the lord has spoken who can but prophesy thank you not let bow our head our heavenly father once again we come in before th face having nothing in us but we waiting on you Lord you are the creat Lord Jesus only father that can bring word our heart we [Music] re even [Music] [Music] if the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen you may be seated I will do a little but I'm going to repeat first the verse 6 and seven I have aen Bible shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be shall there be evil in the city the Lord has not done it God will do nothing he reveal his secret unto his servant the Prophet The Lion Ro the lion has r who will not fear the lord God has spoken who can but prophesy the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy to prophesy the Lord has to speak my title this morning I took the great uh subject that the prophet spoke about Amnesia but I took just a subtitle a forgotten [Music] dream we are going to read in the Book of Daniel chapter 2 the Lord spoke [Music] the Lord speaks through vision when he speaks a proph has to follow we're going to take an an example in the Book of Daniel chapter 2 uh there was a king he had a lot of dreams but one time he had another dream and he was troubled he was troubled the B says he couldn't sleep when the Lord speaks something has to shake you won't have any peace [Music] until you do what the Lord has asked you to do when the Lord speaks you can close your eyes you can cover yourself under the cover until you do what he has you to do it's not up to you it's the Lord speaking if he calls you can stand up and said I don't want to go to church [Applause] the where God called you to be the King Nebuchadnezzar he dreamed by that time he he was troubled [Applause] Magan the all the asant the prophet he called them say I'm in trouble I'm in trouble I have no peace I want you to tell me the interpretation of my dream it's the prophecy that can you the [Music] prop it's the interpretation of the thought of God when you have the prop of your life peace that's why you find peace as long as you know where he asked you to be that's where Amnesia falls into amen amen are we do agree The Book of Daniel chapter 2 the Bible says I'll skip a little bit verse three the king told them I have I've dream and my spirit was TR to know the dream my spirit was troubled now listen and then speak the to the king of syri oh King for tell us th servant the dream and th [Music] servant we will show Thee the interpretation that is where I got my subtitle verse the king answered and said to the the thing has gone from me I dreamed but that gone iot my dream the dream I want you first to give me my dream then you can give me the interpretation thean this thean said verse if you will not make known unto me the dream there but one decr for you for he have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and I shall know that can show me the interpretation thereof when [Music] before they even finish telling me it's not interpretation we need that God gives you the dream first we have a lot of interpret especially in this time interpreters brother I dreamed about eggs it means you're going to have a lot of money but gentlemen do you did you see my dream we have a lot of interpretation but that King was inspired he said first give him my dream I'll tell you one thing the king knew his dream because if he give him another dream he will recognize not the dream that he dreamed but he said the thing has gone from me he wanted to be sure that interpretation was right because he didn't know dreaming know it you will know you know you know that you are children of God you know that if I tell you gave you the holy you know that because from the beginning you knew who you were and the King said if you give me my then I'll will know the interpretation is correct for me to know the interpretation is right just give me my dream first uh what the king is asking no man on the earth can do it only the king the gods that dwells in the Heavenly places what the king is asking only God can do it if you have God it will give you the interpretation of your life but the age in which we're living in the problem that we have now the dream has gone from us the dream has gone from us we are coming in the message we thought that we really dreamed but somehow the dream we don't we don't know our identity in the message we in the message as just uh brother said I will read it rapidly amn I believe in the message spiritual Amnesia says it's a very the state the church is right now it's dise of meure it's a very serious case the Bible says you are naked and you don't know it that is the case of the Church of they don't know it's a very serious dangerous case people they don't know who they are and Os came out and it did the DI that of that church he said God does nothing without revealing his secret speaking through his Prophet I try to take notes and to give out for us to read the way I prepar I didn't know what to give us so they can [Music] project we are going to read together the Prophet The Prophet says this I certainly blast it okay he was certainly blasted okay he will certainly blasted with all that was in [Music] him [Music] exp for he had D the Lord and he couldn't do nothing but that he found them in that day with a bad case of disease spiritual amnia and that's just exactly why we got today that's why the prophet he got he [Music] that's why we got today brother I want to have you can be in am but you don't know theet the church doesn't know the condition they pleased that they belong but they don't know when you come to that word you have to identify yourself with the word become the word it's not the knowledge of the word it's to become the word the prophet says the cause of the Amnesia it's that people don't know who they are what causes Amnesia when you came to the message you you have Zeal I remember in the morning when I woke up I had to go see all the brother because I thought go to the rupture because I didn't want to miss the rupture and when I see some the brothers then I can I can say the rupture hasn't taken place yet we were under the emergency because now we took and then we we start looking what pay attention to what others does we failed we just want to be members of the church but the message took out from the church not to build another church but the message called us to prepare us to meet the Lord we came we a group we comfor each other and we forgot the purpose why God called you we completely forgot it but I want this morning to renew our emergency to know that today it can be our last meeting how are you going to meet the Lord Jesus Christ how are you going to speak to the Lord Jesus Christ how you going to tell Jesus you understand it was difficult how are you going to tell Jesus all this time you've been sitting on the pews you can't identify yourself when the prophet comes is to tell you who you are it comes with the prophy so that the ego can identify themselves not to identify thems in the courtyard but when they recognize in the cour yard am the chicken they know they have wings to fly it's not just to spread it out and to work to fly upu has to work to have the B says she was working night to the point where B came the work of Ruth attracted the work of Ru attracted it's not the beauty ofu but it's the work of Ruth a Christian when he comes to church he comes to work he works every day what you yest that's not who you are today because you read one more verse and you believed it the case today and people are in Amnesia what causes Amnesia three things that causes Amnesia you know when somebody was in the accident and the the the the thing was really hard sometime he he lost his memory he can't he can't recognize where he is maybe he can take time to recognize his name the first thing that causes Amnesia it's a shock they shock caus Amnesia the shock causes Amnesia shock what shock they shock the do shock of Doctrine it will not it will not Rapture you Doctrine will not H you it just drives you away I spent a lot of time without seeing my sister and then one day I went to her City at that time we didn't have phone she didn't know I was going to come she wasting at home she saw me coming she ran to me and she huged me oh my brother oh how are you I said I'm well and she stopped do you believe that the tunders are revealed I said I believe all the word and then she was disappointed with the joy is gone because people that believe the if you them you will get it that's the doctr shock of and they don't people don't know where to go they fall into the Amnesia the second thing that put people in Amnesia it's worries yes they don't know if Pastor is a servant of they worry they start looking elsewhere he cannot work with all energy because he has worries in his heart worries takes away Faith right right right [Music] to take advantage of his ministry have to believe in that man with all his weak or everything will be saying won't help you you have to start from there the third thing it's where when you don't know where to go that's why the prophet Bram said when you are split between two opinion you won't have any position you have to choose your church and your own church you always you are visitor everywhere you are in Amnesia brother wake up amnesia is a bad case you have to leave to quit Amnesia said amnia made the king with all his Gods he forgot that he was a king he went to [Music] eat he stay with the Beast seven animals seven [Music] years it's a terrible case sometime you don't realize the church is inia now it's the time to understand there's a spiritual sickness that is really bad the devil is just ping you you're a Son of God Son the Son of God without work I will show you my work what do you do for God you may think that I'm speaking of somebody else but you have to understand that Amnesia it's that you don't you can't recognize yourself you can't identify yourself you don't know the prophet says when you identify if you say you're American you bear the shame of America you bear the glory of America everything that America is you are if you're a Christian you bear the shame chity you bear the glory of Christianity everything that Christ is you are you are seeking perfection God works in [Music] humility even Paul that wrote the there are people that left deas has foren me the prophet says that deas that brother deas didn't go back to he didn't go to the tavern everything [Music] he thought that the ministry of Paul was done because Paul was crying he had a sickness that God couldn't heal him while was walking his own shadow was Healing The Sick but it happens that he pray for himself must looked he said this man doesn't have God anymore that is why you see people leaving the church but they they leave God there in Simplicity because they look to the they looked up the the pastor couldn't do this the shouldn't have done this I don't know where people have the meaning things of a pastor let's go back to to the word the prophet [Music] says paragraph 37 what I told you about the causes of Amnesia the prophet describes it there it says paragraph 40 when you have you can't identify yourself you cannnot identify yourself but when you identify yourself you identify to Christ and Christ is the word everything you shall ask the father in my name I will do it he cannot lie he said heaven will pass away my word will never pass away what are you worried it's not Amnesia am spiritual amnia it's something that destroys the I saw the pastor projecting a video I was troubled but it's the target is the church when the brother says invasion of America it says invasion of families the purpose the target is the families destroy families that is the purpose of the devil we were thinking with in the old time we were sitting with theing and that was creating atmosphere we were growing with atmosphere but today the child is on the side with is on his phone on Mom on YouTube that's that's not why the devil wanted to destroy the family to divide you there's no Fellowship in the and the church the church is not here start from home if you have two families uned at home in a true fellow you have a strong church then the devil is targeting you the time to give testimonies you on YouTube what are you looking for you have the message of what are you looking it's not a curiosity of he trying to taste something more that's the human nature when they got out of EG they played they danced and they eat man they were happy but after a few month they said don't we have anything else just man man every day God is full of love we are his children because things that we do we ask God I want this when God gives we are tired of it there was a mother who gave birth to a child and the baby was not crying the baby was not crying he went to the church he said pastor I'm wor and the baby's not crying I want you to pray I want my baby to to cry and theor didn't say he took the baby he said let the baby cry and he went home the baby started crying and she couldn't sleep she went back to the pastor I went to the [Music] doctor he said the baby is in good house but this baby cries all the time I don't know why I want you to pray that's a human nature but God is our father I wanted to give a little testimony of the love of God God is wonderful I had a mother very strong mother she was really strong I knew her like that really beautiful woman and very strong but when she got old I went to visit I didn't know how to comfort her I couldn't I couldn't recognize her I was saying what can I do for her this woman that was very strong she was weak in body she couldn't even stand I said wow and every time I I didn't want to stay longer because I was suffering suffering in my heart but when I was coming back I was thinking the other side we young we'll be young and then she died I had one of old picture when I look at that picture I said this is not my mother I only have this to keep and I put it in my room one of this day I was sleeping I don't know how to explain you I find myself before her no was very beautiful very strong another woman that I knew I was happy Mama how are you she she looked she was very I wanted to follow her follow her and then I woke up I prayed the Lord I said what it is and the Lord wanted to comfort me and since that day I know she's in the body that I knew her very strong when when I was speaking to my mother here and she said sometime I look myself through the mirror I don't recognize [Music] myself you have a body waiting for you you have a good body keep this message keep this word that's why will take you to that body what we have right here it it will just melt we give so much attention to this body but you always deceive us but give care to the word because this word has prepared a body since I dreamed that dream I don't know in my heart comfor me I never thought about it [Music] I was saying I could only take the picture of what I saw in my dream and replace the picture that I have in my room God answers to our question our worries I was day Heaven story he came to show me don't worry look what how she is right now continue let's continue I wanted just to open this to show you how how father is the prophet preached he takes care he takes care what you're going to do is to is to follow to follow word don't stand on side don't in the church where the word you want to we serving the word ask your question what should I do it's not just to be a it's not just to be a pastor God called us in this hand time [Music] it's not in order of the priesthood of a but of MEC everyone is a priest made the kingdom of priest if you cannot stand here to preach You Preach anywhere in your life when you speak to your when you project love to your sister prach more than the that is coming out and God want us to be preachers amen job forgot I will stop anyway I'm not asking you when when to stop but listen you understand understood with me the causes of I will also show you how to get out of it and I will stop there because that's my purpose church is an Amnesia and they don't know I I my I my knows and that's it but that's not it you have a dream your petition has to come and you will identify yourself who you are God had called you you have to identify yourself don't look to be arms like me or they heal like n no God will reveal to you are in this church and you will take your and you will see how the joy will your heart as long as you not in your place you will create TR you are in trouble you just because you're not where you're supposed to be when God called me I remember very well I was still in the primary school and I went to my father I wanted to go swim in the river I took my towel I wanted to go down the valley and to go to the river I was getting ready to go to the C and it was and the sun was it was the the wind was blowing and I was going to the river and I heard a voice and the voice was very strong and they said I want you to serve me I left and right there was nothing the wind was BL and was just thinking maybe to and I ran again because there was a time to go to the cin and when I was going The Voice came for the second time it was stronger than the first one and I looked nobody I got I got scared I went back when I got home I saw my father's laying there on the couch I told my dad somebody told me going to be my servant my dad was not a Christian he was a Catholic he was just going uh to church on Christmas Day and then he woke up he said uhuh he said he said he saw like I was shaking somebody told me you're going to be my servant and he told me it's a good thing he called his younger brother said took this man take this man he has to go to the Seminary and I was convinced a servant of God is a priest cuz I was happy they took me to the Seminary because I was convinced I was very smart there in the Seminary and the priest adopted me you know they in seminary they they L small people since I was very small the priest adopted they used to call them Father [Music] and one day he told me let's go visit the the N I already spent two years there and we went there Ser us drinks and we ate and we had to go there and we started going out there's a n that followed us and were there three of us walking and then he told me you called this your mother I didn't get it and we were still walking you know the Seminary it's in the in the forest in the wilderness it's not in the city the N has to come back with and then he told me just move forward and and when I was moving forward I started looking back my my my my father was had a lot of wives he was fighting with my mothers all the time I didn't love that life since I was in the Seminary I thought I was out of the I was so happy when I saw the pr hugging and kissing the the nun I was troubled said I thought this man was holy now he's doing things like my dad I was troubled I was young and I went back to see my dad I told Dad I don't want to go back there he said you have to go there you have to stay there I didn't know how to explain to my dad finally I left the in the middle of the year I went I left what I wanted to say I was not in my place and there God was burning in my heart I left the Seminary because I didn't see God I was sincere they disappointed me I couldn't stay there I left my father kicked me out of the house and since then I started going I went to the Baptist Church they were preaching There They Don't Preach with the Bible they in the they were they were preaching with the books coming from war and there I saw them the Bible the preaching of the Bible I was so happy I stayed with the Baptist after a while I saw Baptist started drinking a little bit and then I said I don't think I don't think I to serve God drinking alcohol I left I went from church to church until one day I crossed this message I identify myself I was thinking that is why I preach on Wednesday when you tell me this message is wrong tell me where to go if you show me to the Baptist I've been there if you show me to the Catholic I've been there where should I go now I only have one hope is this message you have to identify yourself let no one take away that hope there was a lady that was a when prayed for her she had aach pain she went home she started testifying I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed and her husband said hone you can't even heat keepy you bringing shame on the message he said she told her husband the only hope that I have you want to take that away for me the only hope that we have this message when somebody comes and show you mistak that's the only hope I have left you want to take that away from me we don't have any other all that we have to do is to leave the amesia the world is upon us the world is upon us what people started doing is to build like the world they wanted to be like the world if really we can believe [Music] sincerely it's here that we can find Natural Woman things put on you don't put it for God you are putting it for men but you have to live for God that beauty that you put on do you do that for God says was putting on uh things for the man for the men but when God you and you identify yourself you don't live for men you live for him but how to get out of that nation that is upon the church something that is in joy that makes me happy it's the elect will not be deceived the devil can come any way he wants when the elect will hear me as he's hearing me right now he will take the stand because that's the word that was sent for him it's not for the world everybody can hear listen but it's not given to everybody it's for you if you don't after hearing that the church is and you it means the word is not for you because in every group three kinds of Believers that is why I'm advising you don't look at your neighbor don't look at the pastor don't look at the deacons our holy example the word anointed word to live like Jesus not to live like f the time left it's numbered you have we have to overcome The Last Enemy and the faith is our victory we have to stand firm in the Faith with in everything that God has say God wants the faith not Mi you cannot mix ibrid your faith when you place your faith in the things that is not your word you're ibing your word it's going to be like a fig leaves for Eve you're going to cover yourself as long as the Lord when the Lord will appear it will dry out and will see how naked you are but the word comes this morning to help you to get ready before that day because there's a black brother was telling [Music] brother I want to fix everything here because when I will be there at the river so I can cross without is I don't want to have issue at the river if you resist here you create problems there at the river when you about to cross the J everything will be clear I always say to the people you see our eyes it will not help you you want to contemplate us it will not help you look somebody who's ready to die in Grace by the grace of God I buried people I preach in funerals i' like to see somebody when at the last minute I want to speak to somebody at his last minute I saw two people dying that one was was dying crying he told me you going to take care of your brothers I don't know who's going to pay tuition for my kids and it was weeping crying and he dies I saw another one hiden by disease sicknesses he was not even strong to stand up from his bed but I was there his last minute he stood up standing on his bed without he told me brother Foster let's pray and we prayed and he went back lay down and sleep how you want to die my brother how you want to die the last minute will reveal who you are you can Li to everybody but the last minute of your life will reveal who you are I can preach the way I'm preaching the last minut will reveal who I am maybe I will preach a good Ser but I remember but there will be one day with God am I going to face God that day with body that all lied watching me how am I going to face him a Christian it's the person that has a long range Vision he sees from Far because faith is a longrange vision he say from far by faith Abraham saw already Isaac before he was even born he saw Isaac but now the message came I want to say I'm not going to read it because I want to put everything together Moses in the time of Moses Paul said in First Corinthian Moses to deliver the vision to to give prophecy when God spoke he had to give prophecy to the people he had to Veil his face and Paul said that's a a temporary Glory but even now when they read Moses the veil is still upon the faces but the Veil lives when they go back to Christ amen if you don't go back to Christ you still have Veil on your face that's why they said we have Moses they say they have Moses but when the heart is converted to Christ the veil Liv now they can know Jehovah of the whole Testament Jesus in the Old Testament the New [Music] Testament and they can identify thems to that Jesus we want to identify ourselves we dreamed and the dream that we had it was Malachi 4 malach it was prophesied I will send you L the the prophet I will send you Elijah the prophet it was a dream said all them people they were praying for this to happen now when it happened they tried to look at it God sent the vision Revelation chap 10 to give the explanation of Mali but they turned their back for job was the same thing there was no man that God loved as job the devil went to see God God told him did you see my servant there it's because you gave him so much good God knows our hearts he say go touch him he will not deny me the devil came he destroyed everything around job he started even touching his own body but knew there was a god there in heaven the devil I will make him deny you the prophet says when you pray to God you pray to the Holy Ghost it's because you believe that the holy ghost exist if you [Music] believe as you believe the holy ghost [Music] exist the same thing the devil that's why we can devil this body because we know know he hears you have to to acknowledge that he hear he hear that he to God make him deny you but who push God to job to deny God his own wife the Devil incarnated Himself that's why sometime when you careful if you don't speak the word it's the devil speaking through you be mindful of what you speak because the devil it's he can slide he can slide in in the pulpit and the woman the wife of job said this suffering just cursed God and job stood firm job said when the prophecy came when the light sh was shed job stood there said with my own eyes even if death destroy my flesh with my own eyes I will see I know I know [Music] my if you haven't got to that point the veil still on your [Music] face amnia just walk on you but when you hear my voice don't hearken your voice your your heart that's the time that the church is going through right now God came down to reveal his word to joob he said job I saw that you resist I can ask you a question where were you when I I was placing the foundation of the world I know you know it forgotten dream job I know you know it it just you forgot about it but just remember when the stars of Heaven Sent for Joy where were you when I was lay down the Earth where were you you know that job the Prophet The Prophet is telling us calary was done before the foundation of the world we were attribute of God and we we didn't want to be lunch on the earth because we didn't want to be lost we wanted to stay in God but what did God do before the foundation of the world what did he do he took one attribute he launched it and the attribute left went he wanted to be lost God rose up the cross before the foundation of and then he slow the lamb and the attribute came back and God told to remember that the Redemption happened already and the memory opened up now job said I know I know my redeemer liveth you shouldn't that God has to reveal you and for God to reveal you I told you on Wednesday if you are sincere and honest God is obligated to reveal himself to you you don't have to go see for ration but just be honest and sincere God is forced to reveal himself to you it's individual re it's not an end message Revelation no it's a personal individual Revelation you just give yourself to God you say Lord here I am I don't know what to do I do my best I stopped there now I will just obey what you tell me if you are sincere and honest God will reveal himself and the veil will leave you brothers and sisters it's a blessing when God doesn't show you other people's mistakes when somebody speaks about something no he wanted to attack me the pastor for preached to me about me maybe his brother told me about me that's why he went up there to preach against me you still have the veil on your face but if you are that you came this morning for God to speak to you and you receive that you are sincere and honest God is obligated to reveal himself to you you will stand up as a job I know that my redeemer liveth don't choose a church because your husband is there because your wife is there no let God re just be honest God himself he the one who he the one who cleans he the one who bapti Redeemer nobody else job said when God told him you know you know what I told you because you were there when the stars was clapping their hand because when was created the first day got created the the Stars clapping their hands the second day stars were clapping their hands job was there as attribute of God when he came on the earth that it happened that we were in it's the message of the end time that comes to reveal to us who we are that is why if you don't take this message honest way and sincere way knowing it's the host that's taking you to Jesus you will stay member of you will change from church to church the church will not change you if you are the the water the watering the seed will not change the seed AB Abraham God spoke to him but before Isaac comes God came in the human flesh he revealed himself because Abraham was sincere how to get out of Amnesia when you look at the message at the end time you are sincere and honest God will come to reveal Abraham was seated God saw that he was honest he was sincere he came down he took the Flesh and then went to see him when God comes in a human flesh is to reveal himself jaob Jacob he was a thief but God saw that he was sincere he wanted to be righteous God he made him Jacob understood that this is my day this morning you understood it's your day it touched God it touched God I will not let you go until I see something that is why I told you if you believe you are working it's not to come oh I heard God called me now I'm just sitting there Jacob fight fought the whole night God called you you have to take God called Israel he told them I give you the I give you the Promise Land where the honey and milk you will not you will just eat but when they got there they had to fight oh church I'm not doubting that the Lord had called you but you just in am you have to stand and take the word as your own and the prophet says if you identify yourself and you American you understand you were with Washington you were with Lincoln the mistakes the failure of America it's your failure the success of America it's your success and when you're also Christian you have to identify yourself that you were with Abraham when he was running there you AB when God gave him the promise you were with him you were with when the lion you were with him when he went before you were with David you overcame goath you [Music] have when Li you with Daniel when you identify yourself as a Christian as a true [Music] Christian everything that is in the Bible belongs to you you were with HEB children with in a furn fire you with them you overcame with them but now listen this morning you were with Jesus when he cried at the cross oh Father Why th forsaken me you were with him when he was D at the when he was suffering at the cross when he was paying the price you paid the price that is why I'm telling you nobody can condemn you you were at the cross nobody can accuse you when stood before the can you accuse me of sin I was with him who are you to accuse me but this morning of Sunday when he rose up again you Rose up with him the greatest Victory ever won you hi it that is why the Bible says we are now seated in the Heavenly in Christ Jesus not tomorrow right now we are seated in the Heavenly places why because we overcame the world we overcame everything under our Fe when you speak you believe it the thing has to happen because you are from God putting yourself in that position you cannot walk there like this no you cannot respect your ESS you walk like slav you have to walk knowing that you overcame you were with disciples there at the hoer room don't look at the symptoms telling you you see how you li you don't have the Holy Ghost do tell get me you came late I had when we in the H room I heard him you were with disciple in the upper room amen everything belongs to you the dream that you forgot the Bible says there's no man that can tell you the dream and the interpretation only the person that has Intelligence of God that is why you are a blessed people a people that have a prophet a blessed people because the prophet gets in the mind of God it gets in the mind of God who can tell the mind of God to tell the king his own dream you have to have a Prophet brothers and sisters do not neglect the thing that you have on your hands you did not come for condemnation no no you have come because God wants to glorify himself in you and walk like that do not do not look at your mistakes look at him because when you look at yourself you getting weaker look at to him just to close up there was a concert and there was a student musician that studed the music and became professional and organized a concert and then he went up to the stage the stage and he played very well he preached very well and the church was on fire everybody was rolling he said you are a master you are a doctor when it was done he didn't want to he lifted up motion he looked back there at the balcony there where where I'm pointing you to look at you looked back there the master was sitting there the master was sitting there while the the room was on fire the master was sitting there and the people was looking they in Emotion they were clapping their hands but that that man was not looking at them everybody looked he said why is not so happy he he plays so well but he has his eyes pointed to the master and then they realized he had his eyes fixed back everybody stood quiet looked where he was looking at and there was the master his problem it's not what people say it's what the master says don't look at what people say what your pastor will say look what the master say we are human beings I can call you a demon evil but don't look at it look to the master back there he said where two or three got in my name I'm the mother and this morning Look to Him the word at the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was church look to the word this morning don't look to the one who preached but look to the word and identify yourself be sincere and honest identify yourself to the word look what the word is telling you this morning and stand us if God revealed to you what you have to be this morning you have to confess you have to say right now I know nobody else I myself know my redeemer let us [Applause] stand the Church of the Living God the prophet Amos came he looked in the church he saw a disease and he came with THS the Lord he said the Lord has spoken who cannot be afraid when we are into chaos I heard the pastor uh reading here in the uh the world that is breaking away I wanted even to preach about it because when the world is reaching the point where end everybody is trying to look for a messiah they looking for a super smart man Superman the world [Music] together that's why if you open the startup you'll be found tomorrow because America has spies

it will change his way of [Music] coming or you want to You're Expecting The White Bird coming for you to believe God is working in humility Simplicity in the weak body that's where God speaks because
