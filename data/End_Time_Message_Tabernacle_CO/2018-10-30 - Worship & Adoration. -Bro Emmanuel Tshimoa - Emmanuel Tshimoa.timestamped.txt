[49:02] some tres important usually they are the
[49:05] small things that we neglect that are
[49:06] very important is required on to chose
[49:08] and I believe in all things
[49:10] if you come aside to support the British
[49:12] strokes we always tell we should always
[49:13] start with small little things the gun
[49:16] shows to get to the greater things civil
[49:19] debate debate it shows if you dodged low

[50:16] it wasn't subtle that represents satan
[50:19] solana to the subtle that Satan's nature
[50:22] in the matter
[50:24] he likes to be great in the meta
[50:26] population it likes to be popular m70
[50:29] like to probably proud is a proud
[50:33] levanta he'd like to show himself of
[50:36] Maputo away but while is nothing
[50:38] oscillating create joy because it's just
[50:41] a creator in a very evil creature a kid
[50:45] with an aleppo bientôt there will be a
[50:47] new annihilated very soon elated
[50:50] he was created just a victory and God
[50:54] knew why it created him a new
[50:56] combination because God does not make
[50:58] any mistakes
[50:59] elevated up when chose he was there for
[51:01] a purpose sup with us his presence tell
[51:05] me as allowed that could be deduce what
[51:07] can you do know that all the attributes
[51:09] of God to be known unto us because if
[51:13] the devil was not there the Genesee
[51:16] Valley
