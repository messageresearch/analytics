[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] sweet [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] amen let us give the lord a hand of our peace [Applause] bless be the name of the lord and i want to greet you this morning in the mighty name of the lord jesus [Music] amen amen i'm very happy to see each and every one of you and i also want to transmit greetings from our brothers and sisters from france [Applause] especially from pastor muya [Music] and many other saints [Applause] amen amen and i want to welcome brother nathan lubacky [Music] [Applause] uh uh i really believe that's a privilege for me to be in your midst and this is made by god's foreknowledge [Music] daddy is my uncle is the little brother of my father we have not seen each other almost 15 years now but uh god knew that we will meet one day i believe that if our earthly program can be accomplished what about the rapture then complicated and i believe that one day we will meet jesus on the years and also may god bless pastor foster yeah we have been in touch uh actually almost one year contact he's a good pastor and he's so humble you can feel that when he's speaking professional his voice is like a catholic priest so may god bless you i'm going to just say something very short you know the greatest revelation is to know who's god what kid you who's your brother and who is satan often in the message people believe in their experiences but they don't believe in others i want you this morning to believe that the same holy spirit that you have mentioned your you will notice that when judah betrayed jesus [Applause] the holy spirit could not drop down unless there will be twelve listen and they say then the body was completed completely because the twelfth camp pascal and they went up to the harper praying god he created you and the holy ghost dropped down they sent his freedom in other ways but because your brother is amen may not bless you thank you very much uh there is also a death in the community yeah it was a sister celine bombo celine bombo the wife of pastor bombo bastian bombos many of you may not know pastor bombo don't revolutionize that's the first pastor i knew in this message under whose ministry i believe this message is a crucial message whose ministry i started preaching ministers say i appreciate that was a mighty humble man of god did you puss uh she the pastor passed away i think uh 20 some years ago maybe 25 years 25 years right because i remember that was the year probably i had the sharing and uh the pastor passed away then the memory i kept from that pastor souvenir ah he was a very very very humble minister minister i remember one time there was a trouble in the church a big intention which even led to the big separation between the church and the creation of chicano [Music] at you know sometimes believers they want to say anything they want to say to the ministers one of the believers want to see the pastor and the queen taliban pastor you don't even have the holy ghost what you now mentally said to speak that man of god see dumb did you he went down on his knees you see and he said brother come probably myself i will not do it but that was really something that marked my life but after he is passing away a press on the pubs some more his wife stayed safa mirristi travel to south africa and it was time for him for her to go back home she has a daughter married to brother cherry in virginia uh elaine marie of africa virginia and uh another daughter married by uh pastor zakola for those who know him you know mario pasteur zakola for success and another daughter who is now who is also married by uh pastor paul who took tabernacles as a pastor now uh so we wish we presented our condolences to the family and i want to also let you know about the event and i want also to take the opportunity to thank you again i think you have done a tremendous work in our preparation and the behavior during the meeting was also wonderful um and uh i think it's time for god to accomplish what he has promised for each one of you the only thing for you is to hold your faith and keep believing you continue your acquire and keep moving you continue advancing and uh also during the time i was in uh europe yeah europe i met with a lot of ministers a lot of people brother sister you don't know how they look at you as an example here a lot of people from different places have their eyes on you pleasure person they plus different owners you fix your voo and we want to keep the quality up not only the quality for what they see from the outside person exterior but to really have the good christian quality inside our and a little mistake that you and i can do you may not realize how many people will be impacted just keep it at the higher level standard garden standard especially musicians special musician technology technology song leaders the little thing you do you say many many people are watching personally and a little mistake you can not imagine how many people will be impacted by i have seen many churches in europe jv preachers on europa they don't have a room of their own proposal by the technology group technology they have always to be there very earlier to plug equipment on the machine and after service they have to unplug them services do have debunks oh if we could only realize the privilege we have imagined brother you don't know the value of what you have seen until you see elsewhere amen people who are coming to unplug and try to fix and try to all these things to continue and to keep up with a wonderful job we have a wonderful job i know continue the meeting i have in france it was pretty much the copy of everything we have done here i had a question we did not see the question and answer from your youth and your couple online in this is to tell you how detailed they are following and some of the people they say we want also to have a banquet we want also to have a couple meetings but the schedule was already filled up with the young people meetings it was uh a lot of young people you have a book with shenzhen some coming from belgium other parts of france oh germany and uh even some pastors they were there with their sheep members and we also had a session for questions and answers and you know some of the questions and answers are very very tricky certain questions okay one asked me if a brother beat his wife uh is he gonna divorce ask her if i divorce it i did not have anything in mind imagine a very end upon but i just gave them the answer marriage is for good and worse so if you get beaten a sea of kappa ah pray the lord so that he can't stop but you cannot divorce because of that divorce the word doesn't give you permission to marry another one anyway but you know in the meetings like that with people coming from different places we were very very cautious when we collected all the questions the one i could find answers directly from the message director i would give them the answer from there [Music] to consult the head deacon and ministers the pastors from just to avoid giving my own opinion and stuff is opinion personnel and create some trouble among the believers which uh we are not allowed to do in some papillary affairs issues consola amen so i thank you for your prayers because going to the mission missionary field it's a lot of a lot of challenges i left here on tuesday and i arrived there on wednesday and uh the meetings started thursday morning and afternoon friday morning and afternoon di martin sua and they even requested a special service in addition so i have uh for three days i had six services and uh then i preach on a sunday april after sunday april i was really terribly hit by sickness i did not know what happened [Music] i was so tired and the pastor there did not know what to say what to do and in the meantime here my wife also was very very sick my family was she tripped him and she could tell from my voice and i could tell from her voice i think that would be due to an accumulation of fatigue i see an accumulation of fatigue i was so tired but i believe because of your prayers even if you did not know what was going on i was sick monday tuesday my life and uh on the next wednesday i was supposed to preach this song i did not know what to do but uh somebody told me i can't get maddie you know with the work you have done avec travis satan uh feels a little bit attacked uh he was really attacked okay so here to react hello and friday they had a watch service all night [Music] and i preached and i finished on last sunday and i want to thank you for your prayers and uh keep this in mind regardless as the prophet said come the prophet you preach on sunday you practically demonstrate all the demons that you are casting out to let the monkey was it on trending they will be turned loose against you you say only be controversial sometimes the preacher they don't have a nice sleep after sunday service on monday because all those spirits being cast asking this is speaking onto this chassis they turn against you and uh something we need to know so therefore i think really i need a big rest and i'm going to take some days of rest and uh the services the meeting i have i was invited again dedication in congo i have just cancelled that meeting i could not make it super measured and i think i will take some uh time off and uh on my way back i lost all my luggage but i thank god they brought them yesterday morning but i believe god is on our side to give us the victories amen and people have requested the same repetition of special meetings like that even from people who came here memphis uh we want to see how the lord will guide marion if it is something that will uh bring us closer to god all the time knowing the time is at the end we will try to do even on a small scale etc amen amen so we want also to thank our brother richard for bringing the word all these services and i think god was wonderful and we will continue with the same series and i think uh on the book of ruth yes so he started just the first part on the decision i believe yes and uh we want god to take his leadership to see until he will uh be satisfied on what he want to deliver and uh i want also to rest so this morning we will have uh brother uh branham london uh he will uh bring us the word zapote so we are going to bring uh reverend branham lunda to the platform as we welcome him as we stand please [Music] is

legless de gente and with the gentile church effort that would be a perfect type of plan of redemption the new testament no voyage [Music] uh israel and the two boys that they came out of israel among they went to moab they got married out there landed on foreign [Music] when the two children of naomi died oprah and ruth remained widows and after a while le because naomi had left the israelites

and was it just pleasure because i am jew i am to go back to my house and they started crying and when they cried or paparazzi and ruth representing the true believer i come for surveillance and as you know i don't know if you're representing the true creature but for opera it was a grace to say oh we believe that since we believed the message that william branham came i've already understood that your god is a true girl i will doubt i will not leave you secretly what thou shall eat if you die me too threatening nobody pushes her to decide amen amen elasticity she only understands she had the revelation that they own me she's [Music] [Music] encounter i will remain with the message now meet you feel like er zwift and they want me to be fine the jewish church [Applause] but we want also to put on your mind cannot perform here now with me that we cannot type naomi ossi is the message of the hour okay jesus that as we receive jesus christ when you take a decision on the basis of the word yeah when you rest god will take care of the rest afraid of what i'm saying explain [Music] coming into the land of the jewish travail ruth working on chapter two she's gleaning she's working in chapter [Applause] and ruth was rewarded amen amen ruth was rewarded by marriage the rest and the reward said because of her decision therefore for the principle the foundation of the christians is your first step with prayer with christ amen amen and the rest is the baptism of the holy ghost and the reward still adoption is the adoption okay sir you see that all right justification justification that's sanctification the sentence of the glitter he started justification with lucy definitely god wanted to have a bride you wanted to help you and i hey and after the pentacles justification i believe that i am with the pastor there's anything strange from the scriptures the pastor will uh align it amen amen and i'll agree with it [Music] [Applause] [Music] now let's read the prophet that it be something starting with the prophet because we cannot uh make up the message and we cannot bring our own [Music] you have you projected it revelation chapter five relationship to three the third part second pressure second part june 1861 he says i like to start some with ruth and boaz ilyakat there are footsteps in the story of ruth and boaz premier first have heard me talk on this message first she had to decide whether she was going to eat to go into this land with uh naomi elena in the decision she had to make a decision that's the end this that's first in foreign after she got there the next thing she had to do was that was was she had to do this in the field they're working for the lord dan let's shot everywhere in the field of board in order to bring in the ruth the morbid amen that's the third step and then going to say the right last and then swivel the next stage is ruthless rewarded amen amen four stages met now observation pronounced a decision now watch ruth deciding in the bible you cannot read your bible and to say that god is not perfect only by reading this story [Applause] baptism of the holy there sanctification level daughters others only bottom the sentence they have the baptism of the holy ghost and others they have adoption affects the difference and with this each level that everyone we are all in the body of christ in a it requires that say luke please elevate the one who is at the higher level you must be fellas to to get him to park well that's why i don't believe simon connect calculations he found i know something and that the other has not understood yes to call him a babe oh no he ain't baby spiritually but he's a spiritual being no it's in a cropper concert i don't believe that no something because we are all still based but if somebody is adopted it's not that the one he in not the son of god he is still a son of god but he is not mature you want under sanctification he's still a struggle but he's still a summoner each one of us has a phase or a stage in the christian life in the kingsman redeemer there was a wonderful uh sweet woman in the name of neville mississippi pleasanter naomi means pleasure elimelech somebody signified adoration like her husband means a worship dude i have to go pleasant worship was her family elizabeth malcolm they had a son malhon malady there was the [Applause] god told him not to leave that land [Applause] and he made a mistake when he went to down into guerrero in trouble a palestinian a jew is never to leave palestine [Applause] god who lives at the dome at the place that god is giving them a politic and the follows politics [Applause] and the brave men can be very good in himself [Music] got hold of him amen amen and i believe that i'm still leaning towards decisions when the time gets there we'll leave uh i think i won't do any better jennifer can peripheral and i'll probably just have this devoted to her are you out of your place you're only getting yourself in trouble amen amen as long as you're staying in the world yes god will bless you merciful but if you leave all depends [Music] the decision that the rules had taken la condi or travail i'll begin paragraph 11. enter a to take a decision for his son isaac who should be made for the to fulfill god's program amen amen seems like people are not here abraham abraham and [Music] on our part amen amen hey beloved tiana shaws you have things to do today things on which you have to decide is this setting a problem in mariah this is a marriage issue and friends university a brother if he wants to get married of course first year will you pray he praise the lord pray listen you praise the lord and after a while yes they see god wants you to decide lord i'm leaning toward this one here amen amen and the girl's descent you're not going to take all the brothers in the message we are not uh yes there is a partner [Music] and i believe that i will decide and to be the same person [Music] is because the decision you didn't take it correctly and normally they see a man that decides you to say first all his strengths don't cesar miss you all is ambitious he doesn't see anything else but it is gold everyone and you'll see the change in your life we believe the message but you'll see even the pagan knows fred 20 brother you go out there you believe that the message that william branham i believe in the pagan looking jesus if they don't say no to cropper you don't believe leopard pagans it is not what in the world you say no you don't what why it is sad they know the same message that this message give somebody reason when you transform that has to transform him they're commenting about transformation that scene should not transform yeah you have a foot out yet and a foot in here in between [Music] a lentil yeah [Applause] is [Applause] but he allowed for you to live in this end time yet one minute nelson too god has on history the jews yeah there's with god the jews god definitely not redeemers become our god who are your ancestors when we believe in jesus christ can't deal foreign when god sends out the prophet he comes to speak to us about this mistake say very technically that all these people do not know maybe not regardless but not notice satan it's in us to take the good decisions i may receive a vision in that vision there were seeds planted there was a seed that grew up so fast directed by the food yeah gave out fruits and people could eat may not serve us by the another one he did mature quickly he was a growing for with a lot of pain a message and this message is a issue we are those trees we are those bridges that god wants us to bear foreign we are forced to take decisions there are times that we may not stay neutral yeah that we have we have don't have to stay neutral and problemative a problem you cannot remain uh we will not you have to say yes or no and i'd like to tell you that this is your decision certain different facts in in the different phases somebody may come here it's been a while that god is called but when are you going to make the decision when shall you do it but if you postpone it and tomorrow it belongs to you amen amen what a decision you have to decide oh no uh a message oh no the message is preached is but you still love the old religion that god wants us to kill that religion like paul paul paul was probably right paul was reported he knew all you are a servant of god just second equal a power i know that you believe the word what they go to the right strategy and a good day on the pastor and then that's them for three years [Applause] and god was revealing to him and the word was being taught by god and today is paul preaching the new testament [Applause] nosotros and some of us we were also in denominational churches [Applause] we were praising the lord we [Applause] he wanted to come and greet the church yeah he left honey and he came despite his weakness and we already listened to the prophets for me it was just kind of a fact i didn't understand but when the pastor spoke he had this shallow negligence he said the shalom church [Music] of god and you know out there [Applause] [Applause] and god says that you die secondly what he will do he takes you amen amen you like your father taking yourself like a mother taking his child now hallelujah always have a representation of god in him [Applause] representation [Music] this year by all kinds of difficulties but all the diseases it's only normal because of this world to be long we are just perfect passing through but this time from a new pressure as we're preaching probably at times we'll come to attack us off when we speak about his deeds menus [Applause] illegal but he says well yes we said i am alone how dare this is this phone because of our prince by the character after a while universe tell him he only sees the two of them hallelujah [Applause] a companion with us when he sees us that the battery is full he is very strong and you're able to fight elena and there is [Music] [Applause] it's the footspring [Applause] [Music] mask and he's walking oh no oh we have a wonderful guard city prague that's easy if you take the right decision this morning get the brother above the destiny you should take the right decision for less service to serve him he will be there next to you guys when i heard those things said i said oh oh you're doing two days i have to be baptized and when i got there yes i want baptism eh malorisma and unfortunately the grand villages in the big cities leslie and progression and church are growing up and by the time the church is renting a place the service was not available at the time they recognize that this is god that decision director they take the decision right away the way of god is not to force yourself yes that's why it gives you the free choice agency so that you can decide yourself [Music] listen to what brother haram says dancer in this message the message oh setentia murray oh it's a wonderful guard jelen i love him so much say probably to judy that's what i always say pampot sekima even after serving him a la feli media at the end he tells me my servant venezuela may god bless you do i have enthusiasm you with everything that you did yo you deserve help i'm going to read it in french because i don't have the french the marriage of the land foreign english but that upon you this is your rule see why you got to do something too would everyone see first date that overcome psyche shall inherit all things shows day that overcomes victoria brothers [Music] he says this you have no you have power to do it amen amen she had met made him himself ready el say preparing i like that eugene you see god could not push us through a little pet paper to you pull us out under the other hand and then saying blessed bless is he come overcome because you had nothing to overcome you have got to make decisions this is you for yourself woman amen amen i have to make a decision for myself you don't need to see them one minute you have to make a decision for yourself i'm pleased to say like i'm a brother or go to i'm going to heaven that's true but i have a situation that i forgot where my bed did uh william branham says let's see if he said that your heaven is not a suspect will drop everything over it's just a deposit too therefore hello come see the person for safety come say since he's not assessed therefore since i've received this message i cannot start all over again i can start all over i'll probably have started i just followed somebody that's not yet because there are people coming oh no i want to believe the message basically because i know that one day probably i will be married if i marry somebody from the message it's a people who are always obedient she's a certain objective if that's your goal retrograde you that's a lie foreign probably you was born again with long skirts long jeep long skirts exterior when you look at her outside oh she has the holy ghost but once you marry her then you'll be surprised objectively because your goals it was not to be saved but i believe this message excel objective one goal separate level is for the rapture that's why we lose it i feel that i can preach when ruth took the decision she started facing obstacles lessons obstacles [Applause] of the foundation of the world secular which is true i pray and afterwards in a lesson do you believe that it's god that lets our trials to come it's that you can lack money but since you don't have money to pay avar and i be making correct you may have a dressing that is not a foreign formal el esoter akuti and says it's not because of paul was leaving paul it's not because he was not preaching the word he has at the same code [Music] and this holy ghost is clean fred what's the story fundamentally you with a great big ministry deep repulsion you're praying for people you listen getting they are healed and you oh you're always like this oh they have to check you out they must do they must say no we feel like amen amen giving your own husband [Music] amen amen when god is sending us at the trials and you have [Applause] you follow jesus [Music] you are criticizing you you have your part with you and keep on with that word and keep on discouraging others oh how is it dressing like that say look here anybody is but [Music] it's not the worst set up and that approach brother that will redeem somebody find somebody yeah he's always smoked he always smokes america it's not that he was encouraging the person to set the person alive but that person in that place i'm a female he has never spoken let's pray against one let the spirit of god be in us this is you our decision will sweep racism to follow jesus that determinant will determine notre benedict our blessing amen amen god is able to do it while you're working friend you're not the second are you for you you play because we're going to follow this is [Music] [Music] [Music] but you don't you respect the order [Applause] but say to a man take it legally and now if you leave the church you'll leave the message you said that i'm not coming back and tell my faces no because such a woman has died because that one is you ah i would never carry it on my way anyway because after all if you don't want to serve him god will remain god no us but he is god amen amen ruth coming [Applause] every time that you get along with christ i happen to be beautiful at the beginning the people are coming back you are a brother you've been baptized yet and then the trials come for chris that when we receive christ we are to get into a family people who have the holy ghost to beat us all together to learn a jewish tradition yes because of the decision he said that i'm going to adapt a decision when somebody decides from her heart nothing can stop her failure if you can decide this morning it will focus seven times it requires that this consultancy going out we have decided to say for instance for our christian life william branagh william branham prophetically is the prophet that god has sent us to preach us the bible that everything that leave though to not believe the message oh we could believe the whole thing we don't want to be like scribes and pharisees they start finding mistakes in jesus poorly crucified to crucify crucified electricity and they want to crucify him and if we accept it and if we hear senate papers it's not because we didn't know the bible before believing the message we read the bible we prayed to you we're also playing around but we knew that we were in wrong amen amen i am only in the church everybody says but when i'm out there and i start supporting you and my life conforms with all the pentecostals [Music] is neither hot or cold no no full operate we don't want to be natural we sell a message we want to say yes it's the message i accept it as a life or death despite of what branham says since i have the revelation that this bible have said i will send you elijah i want to see elijah the prophet i leave all the understanding that i have of the bible amen practice i understand yeah god sends me to teach me the bible to better understand the bible i'll go to branham myself that that's delaying our blessings prepare for the prayer you might have prayed oh senor jefferson oh lord i need this i wouldn't you would give me this and the god looks at you what about my words sitting upon compression you have not taken that decision you would be not there you're still a son of god but you still just are okay well foreign you cannot take a decision affect the condition that you don't donate condition you're giving god's conditions we to pay the right yeah you can say to god yes these are our vows oh senior oh correct that's correct my ctd if you say senior lord if you heal me from sickness you'll be a city faces or if you do this i'll take the decision to follow you february a god and the rest he will take care of it ah man i have to [Music] where the lord will lead you and now notice what the set upon decision because of that good decision and god will start deleting your food god will lead your footsteps so you can get to your rewards you follow me and now she goes the bible says that like you know by chance so she found in the from morning she didn't mind what other people were saying probably a boy would tell her she wasn't even listening to them though that's the type of a christian when you do a [Applause] [Applause] knows the oh i'm not a christian at all like reverend richard would say who party to us not at all a servant every critique i am going to be a true christian body too oh not a christian take the decision you'll see what god [Applause] is the message of jesus christ jesus also sent servants and to watch the fear and they are also officials and now ret rose gleaning mariah marriage and divorce she eats [Applause] invisible inspector saint luikipewa is the one that can see please allow memory pastel awards farther than the pastor can say i'll cut the pasta because you can be good next to the pasta i'll present the flavor you can be good [Applause] [Music] whom belongs to the brothers [Applause] but she likes to work you let [Music] [Music] servants beloved what would they example for comprehensive well many people misunderstand illipascus they think that civil vanilla if you come to church and you work a lot they can perform and the times the person will notice certainly and some will say that has nothing to do of course you don't do those things amen get the pastor's attention to get the brother's attention you do those things because it's gathered you have the revelation you have decided to stop and what [Music] i have that experience every time i was down there in kinshasa one time i had a really a thing that a problem that was disturbing and those days i was not paying my tithes it's as if like you know curses were upon me and things that i was doing were not working out i was making a little bit of money but it was not working and one time i went to church and the pastor had traveled i don't know who preached every little and [Music] the brother is not around when i get my jobs uh my contracting job for
