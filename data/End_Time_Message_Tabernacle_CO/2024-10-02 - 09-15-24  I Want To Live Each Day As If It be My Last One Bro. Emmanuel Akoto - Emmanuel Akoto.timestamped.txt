[0:02] amen God bless you
[0:04] Saints um personally before I sing I
[0:07] love to always share scripture and I
[0:09] would like to share second Peter 3:9 to1
[0:14] it says that the Lord is not slack
[0:16] concerning his promise as some men count
[0:18] slackness but in longsuffering to us
[0:21] what not willing that any should perish
[0:23] but that all should come to repentance
[0:25] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[0:27] thief in the night in the which the
[0:30] heavens shall pass away with a great
[0:32] noise and the element shall melt with
[0:34] fent heat the Earths also and the works
[0:37] that the rain shall be burned seeing
[0:39] then that all these things shall be
[0:41] dissolved what manner of presence ought
[0:43] we to be in all holy conversations and
[0:47] Holiness looking for and the Hasting
[0:50] unto God unto the coming of the day of
[0:53] God wherein the heavens being of fire
[0:55] shall be dissolved and the element shall
[0:57] melt with Fen Heat
