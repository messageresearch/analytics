[4:54] deep I'm a powerful application pad
[4:56] kappa phone of the year is coming to an
[4:58] end
[4:59] not nearly as often as we see in the
[5:02] world come to Montana parole after this
[5:04] oppressive we understand that the Bible
[5:09] is showing us a John Newcombe cannot
[5:11] kill our people and mantras on which is
[5:13] the type of the bride's Achilles if do
[5:15] leepu's he has seen certain things left
[5:18] without insurance and now is coming to
[5:20] the end I mean I'm sorry if I suffer and
[5:21] as we under we'll look in the word the
[5:24] Bible says we come to make other people
[5:26] happy blatant that God spoke to Moses
[5:28] yeah Pamelia Moyes and he said unto the
[5:30] children of Israel thank you some point
[5:32] is right at this month hear him ye shall
[5:34] be the first month of the year for you
[5:37] generally premium waddleon approval
[5:39] which is a month of Abib say kill him
[5:42] what a pair a big a big which is in the
[5:46] first Exodus 12 verse 2 Sakina exudes of
[5:51] exit and God is showing them the time
[5:55] and the season Giuly immortally toyless
[5:57] as long as we also gathered here for a
[5:59] special evening someplace special
[6:02] a timing of the year all right don't be
[6:05] sad you like me and we understand that
[6:07] this is a very specific time that people
[6:09] have to gather those who usually don't
[6:11] come to church especially don't have any
[6:15] significant paddock listen not like you
[6:16] know this is the end of the years of
[6:18] this is elephant Delany and we have to
[6:20] come and worship the Lord evolved in
[6:22] adore listen yeah and to thank him every
[6:24] day mercy for everything that he has no
[6:27] but then the attention that I want to
[6:30] bring here occupancy as we are crossing
[6:33] into a new unit rock solid me reserve to
[6:37] see the parent between Isaiah the
[6:41] prophet of the age Diwali Motel uncle
[6:44] the Prophet is idolize and
[6:46] a John the bride of the age is only
[6:50] paused Elijah and we understand that in
[6:52] the time of Isaiah you know communicate
[6:54] a little desire and at the year that
[6:57] King Uzziah
[6:59] reign has finished it only don't you
[7:01] know what was I
[7:03] and I paid a little more because you
[7:08] wanted to go into a place which was not
[7:10] he fast if we wanted anaplasma typically
[7:13] police told him like no this does not
[7:15] pattern to your ministry local medicine
[7:17] about empathy to me in Israel and when
[7:19] Isaiah had seen such a thing happening
[7:22] in the church is a happy tell shoes are
[7:24] you a tonic as somebody was looking up
[7:26] to a great day and he could not be
[7:31] standing holding his position therefore
[7:35] we see now that God wanted this
[7:38] situation to happen in the church lady
[7:41] said suppose I leave it on likely so it
[7:43] can be able to unfold a different
[7:46] mystery unto this man Thank You mr.
[7:48] cuvee not come instead on sit down
[7:50] and as you seen this mystery unfolding
[7:53] everyone I can say mean is that you say
[7:55] mr. mystery being unfolded then it
[8:01] required that certain elements in the
[8:04] church to be put out allow exist a
[8:06] pencil metallic whisper said we find
[8:09] that if you go back in the Book of
[8:10] Isaiah cocoa no way to deliver design
[8:13] the book shows us the political system
[8:16] in the country lived nomadically system
[8:19] politically it shows us the states of
[8:21] the spiritual the the spiritual states
[8:24] of the people it a spiritual the
[8:27] Pepitone sadhana
[8:28] as you can see that Isaiah was looking
[8:30] up to the political system you come over
[8:32] a key is Erica audio system politic and
[8:35] he knew that if we can look up to
[8:37] somebody who's big was blessed by the
[8:40] Lord and is called King look Ivanka
[8:43] didn't keep any abilities any aha
[8:45] and then this is somebody to to Perrin
[8:48] yourselves after it's like a cash reward
[8:50] but then when the King died I'll call
[8:54] you why mom it is the same situation
[8:56] that John found himself into a Lhasa mmm
[9:00] situation John Sakata way and we know
[9:04] that in the seven church edges Branham
[9:06] teaches us that John was in the Isle of
[9:08] Patmos touch the grease cap common
[9:11] question I didn't leave Department this
[9:13] brother here was lift up in the spirit
[9:16] in Safari
[9:16] the only wit only spree and is so the
[9:19] seven church edges it is attached the
[9:21] big leaves so what was taking place in
[9:23] the church it obviously is it passes
[9:24] only place now you find out you know
[9:26] some of the people where carried away
[9:29] with Nicola ISM but then at the end of
[9:38] this seven church age is attached to
[9:41] decrease then now the revelation count
[9:43] I don't like Villanueva then it shows
[9:45] them that you know come up here
[9:47] I love Salah Appel Vinnie to be able to
[9:51] see greater things than what you've
[9:54] already seen the preconscious give it a
[9:56] shot because as we have walked all this
[9:59] year long Republicans are on Maui to
[10:01] Satan a revelation has unfolded
[10:03] revelation civilly and things as happen
[10:06] additional she's don't pass it only
[10:08] please some with spiritual essential
[10:10] spiritual or somewhere a kernel
[10:12] essential charnel and all these things
[10:15] will happen if you see shows if it's a
[10:17] person I want to bring about the idea
[10:19] tonight Elijah me reportedly pieces well
[10:22] as we come to the end upon the canoes
[10:24] upon Sarah from the end of Isaiah
[10:26] laddoos is the end of the church seven
[10:28] Church ages and now the Lord is bringing
[10:32] the attention of the people uh nominally
[10:35] say Neapolitans don't you people that
[10:37] now that you are crossing into new realm
[10:39] upon decay would cover sit-ins in novo
[10:42] attack didn't you have to have a concept
[10:45] conception that we develop are in
[10:48] concepción to be able to get into this
[10:50] new year because as I said that Moses
[10:55] community Muys as received from the Lord
[10:58] the return to know that time and
[11:01] decision it's a wallet don't it as a
[11:03] song if you cannot understand the time
[11:05] on the system people concurrently Tyler
[11:07] says oh then you won't be able to know
[11:09] what time of the year it is I love when
[11:11] super busy this of what captain Delaney
[11:13] and you'll be missing your appointment I
[11:15] love the LaMacchia vodka rendezvous
[11:16] therefore the Lord when he had prepared
[11:19] a month of Abib and secondly co-op
[11:21] apparently wanna be looked at the nature
[11:24] illogicality Alana
[11:26] looked at the Stars I know does it well
[11:28] and he has synchronized these two it is
[11:31] I think when he said and then when if
[11:33] synchronized easy buddies I think when
[11:35] you say he knew that there was a time of
[11:37] death it's not Vicky's event on
[11:38] dell'Amore and there was a time of life
[11:40] event on de la vie that's what Iglesias
[11:43] tells us absolutely Chris as there is a
[11:45] time to everything yeah Tom push action
[11:47] has now is unfolding dismissed Ramon
[11:50] docusate mr. Santa Catarina is showing
[11:53] to the people Montalban that you are
[11:56] coming out of Egypt you've assaulted in
[11:58] Egypt then you have to observe this time
[12:00] here of develop service it is then
[12:02] levitate 23 comes into view and only
[12:05] with treatment who I'll give a para it
[12:07] shows you the Passover some Montilla
[12:09] Park does the first feast so the premium
[12:11] feta which is def Dickey Lamoure then he
[12:15] gives you the first fruit a lot of the
[12:17] only premiere of week and the first food
[12:21] the first foot of the harvest the creamy
[12:25] so delighted to be able to show the
[12:29] resurrection that come into the
[12:31] Wallabies next year and then it is also
[12:33] the same time allows the Scylla mapped
[12:35] on that the year is coming to the end
[12:38] kill it'll give us a fact to be coming
[12:40] to die the movie and to be able to New
[12:43] Year to start up I think you deliver any
[12:46] piece apart therefore we understand this
[12:48] you know confirm that as believers
[12:50] inquire the work that we are walking
[12:52] amongst Kingdom action everything that
[12:55] the way it's synchronized in the world
[12:58] has to unfold unto us is program again
[13:01] is the book a trip with dutifully some
[13:03] cooker because as the year goes about if
[13:06] inoculum a wrong we are able to see what
[13:09] is taking place some amazing diversity
[13:11] see pathos the Roman calendar vascular
[13:14] calendar on man has given us the month
[13:16] of December as the last month is that a
[13:18] little more deeply some communitarian
[13:20] but according to God's program is not so
[13:22] medically pookums it is in a pine see
[13:24] just as were abhorrent teaches us on
[13:26] Christmas Day on Amazon sent only
[13:28] Noel that Christmas is not the mass that
[13:32] Jesus was born into you know I knew
[13:34] qalam wattages equisetum and it teaches
[13:37] us also the same thing also with
[13:39] December
[13:39] you see the memory shoes and goes the
[13:41] first month as I shown to you basically
[13:43] play no more conscience than wisdom
[13:45] alpha of a baby silly moi tepee which is
[13:48] between March and April they can't come
[13:50] axially but nevertheless even as it is
[13:54] known in the entire world only mountains
[13:56] because we are living under a Roman
[13:58] system the system Obama that we
[14:00] understand that December it is so can
[14:03] you come can actually what it bc depends
[14:05] but it is not actually the first month
[14:07] january is not the first month along any
[14:10] path you pay me more but then we it is
[14:12] known to everybody not Sakuni the tool
[14:15] more that general is the first you penny
[14:18] why did i point the reason why are
[14:20] pointed out two short days like you do
[14:24] is to synchronize these things here so
[14:27] that it is still with the same
[14:28] understanding synchronous issues and the
[14:31] complement comprehension that at the end
[14:34] of the year kill a friend Lonnie it is
[14:37] the end of the season that death has to
[14:41] pass out slices oculomotor salt and then
[14:44] life has to come fall in a video apart
[14:47] because in the month of Abib Rask you
[14:49] don't wanna be it is the time that life
[14:51] starts coming up to see the more like we
[14:54] commence our plan you to be able to see
[14:56] the life
[14:57] coming up remove a trauma the qualities
[15:00] of you have to have God's program if we
[15:02] are going to come with you without
[15:04] having God's program to come did you it
[15:06] is a ritual allows the end which will
[15:08] come to church in December to the first
[15:11] assemble 10 week in the bread alimony
[15:15] look man after just having couple of
[15:17] confession I make a confession
[15:19] we do not conceptualize the physical
[15:22] body conception of what God is bringing
[15:25] out in our life is a cage a taunt in a
[15:27] potted and we lost the 70 years that has
[15:30] been allotted to our life it is a given
[15:35] to us to fulfill God's purpose
[15:38] computability they will see that Isaiah
[15:41] alone where he is I received all the
[15:43] ones on which both is the type of the
[15:46] belief the latest of the choir if they
[15:48] are both at the type of the believers
[15:51] disciplic way on solid tip the choir so
[15:54] having decent mind Yun seong's we find
[15:58] that at the end of every single Junction
[16:00] the world can defend its actions you
[16:03] know there is a new beginning
[16:04] Yunho c'mon smell this new beginnings in
[16:07] the kimono and fall out to us sipping
[16:10] well Diwali what is coming forward sick
[16:13] year he and then I would like to go back
[16:16] into Exodus 12 I don't want kids because
[16:19] in nature Baskin idea when we have that
[16:23] time of the end of the year Conservancy
[16:26] Tony laugh and Delaney we have to first
[16:29] understand that this seed has to go into
[16:31] the earth the Volcom Kentucky lies the
[16:33] most don't here and there and when they
[16:34] see God goes into the earth as the most
[16:37] uncommon tell it has to rot set up and
[16:40] after rotting the pool then it has to
[16:43] start coming for an odd sort of good
[16:45] years and wildlife is start coming back
[16:48] again moanikeala really so we have to
[16:51] understand different compounding
[16:53] principles you can see that governs well
[16:56] did the growth of the tree likewise more
[17:00] de la la casa de la vez de la because
[17:03] when we see the tree growing up very
[17:06] large country and then we know that at
[17:09] this certain time I don't suffer can
[17:10] start and we will have our first fruit
[17:14] and then if we don't have our first
[17:17] fruit to the one who promised to come if
[17:19] who it then we know that we have failed
[17:21] probably to have so that the proper
[17:24] thing in the early sort is I will fight
[17:26] the plant Allah may have samosa right
[17:28] there and then we understand that I
[17:31] don't know that as the year is coming to
[17:33] the end a common love Lana he was a fan
[17:36] we have things that we did throughout
[17:38] the years I want to show you some people
[17:40] and links that we have sold throughout
[17:42] the years just as I want plant upon
[17:44] under the knee and those are the things
[17:47] that will follow us after here this only
[17:49] shows you one received a pretty kernel
[17:51] because a man cannot play a plant some
[17:56] corn seed in the earth as can only
[17:59] probable until as the most be my
[18:01] solitaire and then rip in avocados
[18:04] equality love hookah therefore that we
[18:06] understand is in the complaint that
[18:08] before the year and avuncular ferry was
[18:10] a lot nah give us a fact we have to look
[18:13] back to navigator now yeah what did we
[18:16] plan just feels about Plan C and if we
[18:18] plan hatred since I've implanted AA and
[18:20] expect hatred in the next year at
[18:23] Antonio Allah and the new portion it is
[18:25] true that you did repent but your
[18:29] repentance will replace the seed that
[18:32] you plant that's the most use of a plant
[18:35] to plant joys of a plant LSU and you
[18:39] place a consecration until a consequent
[18:42] you're going to reach our broad
[18:44] revelation in the next year of the
[18:46] lirikgoty like if that's why you need to
[18:49] understand the time and decisions of the
[18:51] V component Lee Tyler says because as
[18:53] the time is coming to the end
[18:55] luckily talk if as a fan of leopard
[18:57] along the years of attorney because the
[19:01] time that you put to pray the turkey of
[19:04] is having me up here you are looking
[19:06] forward to God's answer with that on the
[19:08] kid Yahoo gay porn when you had repented
[19:11] there was a trip on see you are waiting
[19:13] for a revelation that don't delegate
[19:15] realized God that God's confirmation of
[19:18] his forgiveness for your sin is it a
[19:20] confirmation to probation but then if we
[19:22] do not have these principles in our
[19:25] daily walk and also the open sequence if
[19:27] I know Mark scooted yen we are just like
[19:30] you know we had this one here and the
[19:31] one GCC we fight this one combat to make
[19:34] you think that you the best hero
[19:36] positive that the mayor and then wait
[19:38] again a lot on the next year that means
[19:41] you'll do the very something in a map
[19:43] shows because the sister came to brother
[19:45] branham in solving a problem he said
[19:47] that every time that I'm in the service
[19:49] shop only some of these I
[19:51] feel good give me some balm but once I
[19:54] go out really focuses I go back to the
[19:56] very something again Alabama shows why
[19:58] because the key is the seed that was in
[20:02] her that's the mosque you tell me we
[20:04] have to have now the revelation of the
[20:06] Belvoir people I still be able to see
[20:08] that kameez you before what you did
[20:11] and what do you are you expected hand
[20:14] she will be but then not to draw the
[20:17] attention that nobody will be sitting
[20:21] here at the end of the year I see
[20:23] Elephant Island me I had to desire to
[20:24] hear such a sermon in this you couldn't
[20:27] tell me that hey okay look what I have
[20:31] done which was wrong
[20:33] moving am I going to just expect the
[20:36] same thing German can I'm sure than the
[20:38] Bible teaches a lot of people new zones
[20:40] and when the cycle returns only see
[20:42] Clara - we have to break the cycle I
[20:45] don't even then we have to have the time
[20:47] the volatile plant a new seal not
[20:50] investing Buddha to have the new crop
[20:52] event the volume development course when
[20:55] the lamb was slain local annuity mu it
[20:58] is the very same lamp that will come
[21:00] forth slightly Monica donkey - because
[21:03] when teacher of Israel were coming out
[21:04] of Egypt what is guys so ticklish they
[21:07] had to have the level of the blood of
[21:09] the lamb upon them developer listen
[21:12] didn't you see her to be able to give
[21:14] them a proper understanding of the new
[21:16] land a friendly doubt didn't move
[21:17] nouvelle comprehension the new puppy now
[21:20] that we come to this understanding upon
[21:22] the concern across then we see that John
[21:25] is being given now the program I don't
[21:27] want you cited the newly cook who when
[21:30] he found himself in that position the
[21:32] Louboutin said positional Isiah himself
[21:35] you can go and read it he says that when
[21:39] I saw the king which was great because
[21:42] really what all that system that we were
[21:45] abiding ourself onto this tomato I love
[21:50] my family more than the world my family
[21:53] anymore I love this year model of the
