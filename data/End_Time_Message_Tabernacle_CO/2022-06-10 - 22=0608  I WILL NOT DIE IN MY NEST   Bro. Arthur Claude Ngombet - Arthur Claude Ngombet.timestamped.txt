[10:57] is vis-a-vis sydney there was something
[11:00] about that nest
[11:02] job released sample mode
[11:04] that that job wanted just to die in that
[11:07] nest
[11:10] you wanted to prosper in that nest
[11:12] if
[11:20] would you ask yourself did you ever ask
[11:22] yourself excuse me
[11:26] is the purpose of the birds is to die in
[11:28] the nest
[11:32] casa come over here what does it mean
[11:35] die to die queso que la mo what is death
[11:39] the more the prophet music
[12:09] plan to park they don't plant us or no
[12:12] less like in their produce for
[12:14] prosecutors they just laid us there
[12:16] there's no hope for that body personally
[12:21] nobody stay in the cemetery until your
[12:24] body wakes up
[12:28] they can stay for a while and then after
[12:30] a while they go back home
[12:32] continue because the life goes on
[12:39] believers we know the body that we put
[12:41] on the on the ground le pere knows
[12:45] it the the father has promised us not to
[12:47] replace that buddy
[13:00] and then he will bring us back the body
[13:02] in his own state it's a pokemon
[13:19] but we keep in mind that it's just for a
[13:21] little while
[13:27] but the prophet says also there's a
[13:28] death for inside body hey local anterior
[13:32] osi is
[13:46] because it was meant to be the likeness
[13:48] of someone you readily imagined
[13:50] to be the image after somebody eh
[13:56] when your inside body dies
[14:08] and that death is the most dangerous
[14:12] start tomorrow
[14:13] don't you follow me that death is the
[14:16] one that you have to get away from
[14:21] or
[14:22] dying means to separate yourself
[14:27] if you're living your life separated
[14:29] from christ with a very common cell
[14:31] movie you started to die civil prone
[14:35] evil decision
[14:37] if you have taken your decision without
[14:39] the word vupre never sure son christian
[14:42] you have made your choice without christ
[14:46] you're living your days without christ
[14:51] your death has started
[14:55] because dying means to separate yourself
[14:57] from
[14:59] that
[15:02] if you are able to live without god over
[15:04] here
[15:07] from monday from morning to evening it
[15:09] doesn't mean you don't miss him gw
[15:11] elephant so many novel monk from the

[15:21] presence
[15:23] is a normal you just
[15:32] will condemn you in an eternity in his
[15:35] presence
[15:37] allah while his presence
[15:40] bothers you
[15:44] if yeah upon the earth you don't bear
[15:45] with his presence
[15:49] you don't seek to be with him come on
[15:54] how would you expend eternity with him
[15:57] see a sinful decided sundry if yeah you
[16:00] decide without him will that be sorry
[16:04] you good enough without him sasuraj if
[16:09] it would be difficult to be always with
[16:11] him
[16:15] that means those that will live
[16:17] eternally with him
[16:20] has already started living here yeah
[16:25] there's something in them seeking his
[16:27] presence
[16:30] to stay away from him
[16:49] [Applause]
[17:00] but there's something in them info
[17:03] it takes god
[17:07] in assembly
[17:10] either they have church or not a love
[17:12] for christ don't love it he takes god in
[17:14] their lives a lot of skills the wrong
[17:16] case when they will have christ christ
[17:20] the communion
[17:22] christ will stick to fellowship with
[17:24] other christ
[17:25] supporters
[17:28] they won't bear to to live without
[17:30] others

[24:23] elephant
[24:24] and forget it that the food may crush
[24:27] them can you believe their champagne
[24:29] and that the world beast may break them
[24:32] legion conversely she's hiding against
[24:35] the young ones
[24:38] as though they were not elves and they
[24:40] sent her to pat the lean nuclear
[24:43] television a labor is vain without fear
[24:46] cardiology
[24:49] because god has prev deprived her from
[24:53] wisdom
[24:55] and television
[24:57] has impaired imparted to her
[24:59] understanding
[25:02] you have a mother ostrich with a very
[25:04] parallel twist you have ostrich parents
[25:07] cameron de la petite they're just laying
[25:10] eggs the little ones
[25:12] exposed to danger and exposing them to
[25:14] the danger yes
[25:16] come since they tell you
[25:18] behaving like that didn't mean anything
[25:23] because it was uh deprived from them
[25:26] wisdom dancer nature in the nature and
[25:29] also composed by community pool
[25:32] she doesn't behave like a like a
[25:34] chicken chicken
[25:36] and a man doesn't fall she she makes she
[25:38] made uh
[25:40] children little ones
[25:42] come see little pile but she acting like
[25:44] the the little ones were not elves but
[25:47] scary monkey does such as because she
[25:49] lacked wisdom
[25:51] may not to journey but our god is not
[25:53] like this
[26:02] [Music]
[26:05] when they're talking about little ones
[26:07] was in the kingdom of birds buffalo mama
[26:10] pools sometimes it's like a mother
[26:12] chicken but foreign sometimes it's like
[26:15] a madder ego
[26:17] any particular and the mother eagle has
[26:19] a particularity circumference
[26:24] that means he builds his nest in the
[26:26] highest
[26:28] prison accessible in a way that you
[26:31] cannot access
[26:34] that means the mother eagle celebrate
[26:41] find first the the tip of the rock in
[26:44] front of love foreign and build his nest
[26:47] there is a lucky preparation
[26:51] that's where you prepared the coming of
[26:53] is the little one
[26:55] atmosphere
[26:57] that is where his prepared atmosphere to
[26:59] cover the little ones
[27:03] that's where the little ones coming upon
[27:06] the earth in the highest places
[27:09] they were born in the highest in sunny
[27:12] egler they were born eagles
[27:16] that means the mother eagle said you
[27:18] were fairly
[27:19] if you want to have
[27:21] do you want to make eggs with them you
[27:23] don't keep up the volatile you have to
[27:25] be able to fly in his uh highest set
[27:28] your paper for let's see what if you
[27:30] cannot uh fly high as an ego
[27:34] you cannot have eggs with her no would
[27:36] they exist yourself you have to be uh
[27:40] you have to acquire that sincere
[27:42] negligence if it's not an ego just drop
[27:45] it pascal and
[27:47] because the eggs that you will bring
[27:49] forth the natural the leg let's secure
[27:52] level the nature of the ego secured that
[27:56] nature
[27:58] the nature of the ego lacks the highest
[28:00] places
[28:01] egler the bright eagle continue the
[28:03] first episode when he wants to make the
[28:06] little ones the profounder cut only the
[28:08] deepness that inside of him
[28:11] will always seek the highest places for
[28:13] lessons
[28:14] to leave the eggs over there
[28:17] he belongs there
[28:20] the prophet
[28:22] the prophet tells us
[28:54] very far from uh compared to other belts
[28:57] blankie drops
[28:59] on the ground to later though he has to
[29:02] feed himself from the ground
[29:04] element
[29:06] but he put them up there
[29:08] a funky survivor
[29:11] in order for them to survive
[29:17] the only way for him to protect them for
[29:19] the children to survive really it was a
[29:22] level he has to go higher
[29:26] civilization if you are in the nature of
[29:28] the ego
[29:30] retrograde
[29:33] for you backsliding for you to backslide
[29:36] say don't join up
[29:37] it's very dangerous for your kids
[29:41] attitude
[29:44] to stay in the lowest is danger for you
[29:47] are off springs
[29:51] for you to go up it's very
[29:59] is the survivor of your little one
[30:01] cellar protection
[30:02] it's your protection of your little ones
[30:04] covered under the
[30:06] travis
[30:12] you separate yourself from god for no
[30:14] matter what we met down don't you ever
[30:16] descendants you just endanger your
[30:18] offspring that's right
[30:20] what because your relationship with the
[30:23] father who potential whoever to this one
[30:26] protects you with you and your offspring
[30:31] because the nature of the ego is to stay
[30:33] up there
[30:34] about
[30:43] there's something strange with the eagle
[30:44] in our days second leg
[30:47] doesn't need that glove that means
[30:49] eagles is born in the nest of the eagles
[30:54] but there was someone who took the egg
[30:56] of the eagle el amir doesn't nothing and
[30:58] then put it in another nest i needed a
[31:00] bicycle and then at the the lowest
[31:03] court's uh nest safari
[31:07] that means the eagle little eagle when
[31:09] he was born
[31:10] he has two nests
[31:14] there was one nest that is for the
[31:16] lowest here
[31:18] in aspiration
[31:20] and there's another knees they're not a
[31:22] nest that has like uh highest calling
[31:26] there's a birth
[31:29] where you fellowship with the lowest
[31:31] cost he's trying to fit in he'll say
[31:34] this
[31:36] is adapted
[31:37] questions
[31:39] but there's something in him that makes
[31:41] him
[31:42] win some money
[31:44] my next i was born there mister come to
[31:46] your super vermonter it seems like i
[31:48] wasn't really born there
[31:50] several days see there comes job if you
[31:53] decide like job java murray dominique i
[31:56] would die in my nest local
[32:06] the lowest quotes can give you comfort
[32:09] lab
[32:11] the lowest cost can feed you the
[32:13] basketballs are too red than me there
[32:16] but the lowest cost can
[32:18] surround you with friends
[32:21] we can be tempted to prosper there
[32:24] for lunch and we want our days to get
[32:27] longer there cj satisfied the sound if
[32:31] you were so happy about that
[32:33] you're not an ego person making a
[32:35] purpose is satisfactory because an ego
[32:37] cannot be pleased with that
[32:40] though
[32:52] that doesn't match that comfort
[32:55] county london
[32:57] but when he hears the cry calling the
[32:59] poor concerns me
[33:01] when he knows that it's right illness
[33:06] he doesn't even know why he's right in
[33:08] the perfect split common function
[33:12] sometimes he doesn't know how to it
[33:14] doesn't i know to explain but find
[33:17] numbers the voice of the ego performance
[33:20] palette
[33:21] sometimes it doesn't matter the the
[33:23] details of the cry may circulate jesus
[33:25] but he knows it's right yeah
[33:28] there's something in him that says amen
[33:33] he does more than saying amen
[33:36] nature
[33:37] because it's nature that's calling yeah
[33:40] the swift delivers your thirst to rise
[33:43] up yeah questions there's something in
[33:46] him kiss your contact partners
[33:48] attenborough
[33:49] that doesn't contend to say this is just
[33:51] a good preaching content by the
[33:53] president he doesn't content to
[33:54] appreciate the tape it's a content part
[33:57] that could tell you the language he
[33:58] doesn't contend to hear the voice of the
[34:00] ego
