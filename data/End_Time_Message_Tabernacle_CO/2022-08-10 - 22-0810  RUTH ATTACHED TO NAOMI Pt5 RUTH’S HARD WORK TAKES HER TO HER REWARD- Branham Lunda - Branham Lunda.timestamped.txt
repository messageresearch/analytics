[34:11] [Music]
[34:54] [Music]
[35:01] one with another
[35:02] vout la valle in the grand court are you
[35:05] working for a great cause
[35:09] that's the cause of christ
[35:14] i think that's absolutely true
[35:19] i think that's absolutely true i'm in a
[35:22] glaze amen to the church
[35:25] there's a reason why
[35:26] siddhi if god
[35:57] we don't end with a purpose he gave you
[35:58] a new people
[36:00] that you never knew before
[36:02] as ruth
[36:07] and your hard work certainly certainly
[36:10] was we'll take you to the road
[36:14] the man of god preached here
[36:19] we had special meetings
[36:22] and i know you work hard
[36:52] without
[37:04] the work of ruth is very great but
[37:20] there are things that we undermine
[37:24] can i speak to you from my bottom of my
[37:26] heart amen amen
[37:30] some people think
[37:33] to really work
[38:00] i have to be a preacher don't read this
[38:02] something's even saying
[39:12] what's happening with god second we
[39:14] should do city city city pressure it's
[39:17] today if you preach to someone set
[39:19] personally that person
[39:22] is converted
[39:23] god convert the person
[39:26] and it's filled with the holy ghost
[39:28] he comes to church
[39:30] he becomes a solid member
[39:33] and he also him is in the flesh he
[39:35] preaches
[39:37] he brings someone we uncover something
[39:39] in his discernment
[39:48] that's why the minister shouldn't pay
[39:49] attention how many people just simple
[39:52] they just have to preach how god is
[39:54] leading them to preach amen amen basket
[39:57] because can't you press when you preach
[39:59] you know separate you don't know come
[40:01] from and i'm religious
[40:06] organizations
[40:22] she did everything
[41:04] there was no choice
[41:06] maybe the preacher said he could indulge
[41:08] in am i gonna do it imagine it yes sir
[41:11] imagine you're just by yourself
[41:14] a little musician i don't know if she
[41:16] rented the musicians i don't know may i
[41:18] pray but afterwards i praise have a
[41:21] commercial pleasure after preaching i
[41:23] felt long so i said that anointing
[41:25] touched the creature
[41:29] the preacher preached
[41:31] as there was a lot of people wait
[41:32] forever bananas
[41:35] you got called you to preach precious
[41:37] employment just preach but may disappear
[41:39] because it's even from the stone guy can
[41:41] we raise
[41:42] any the anointing
[41:45] of pressure and the preacher said
[42:13] he came to give his life to jesus
[42:18] and the preacher the preaching was made
[42:22] is that little man i gave to his life to
[42:24] christ
[42:27] that little man was converted
[42:31] in that little man
[42:33] louie he had a gift
[42:35] he was a preacher
[42:36] a question
[42:37] what happened the campaign the the
[42:40] campaign was over
[42:42] maybe
[42:57] uh equals to ten thousand souls at ten
[42:59] thousand world a plethora and later on
[43:02] set on last session
[43:05] that little guy agrande allah grew up in
[43:08] the face yeah
[43:09] baptism in the holy ghost
[43:12] that is why the purpose of the prophet
[43:14] the purpose of the preacher
[43:19] to be really saved
[43:24] just one soul see dialogue
[43:27] he god fills him with the word
[43:30] and he saves the person
[43:33] he has done a great job it's a
[43:35] psychopath that's what paul was doing
[43:38] he can stay
[43:52] if he leaves
[44:05] [Music]
[44:16] [Music]
[44:34] is he the preacher or the old lady amen
[44:36] amen
[44:38] they recognize
[44:39] it's very important to recognize your
[44:41] position
[44:44] it's important to recognize who you are
[44:46] in christ
[44:48] and to work
[44:54] knowing that i'm doing this work for god
[44:56] no papa calcutta not for somebody
[44:59] not just to influence anyone and partake
[45:02] in justice
[45:30] is
[45:45] the celebrity will be rewarded that's
[45:46] not all
[45:48] you have precious
[45:49] people who preached under the anointing
[45:52] without any worse anybody who would be
[45:54] rewarded that's not all
[45:57] that gave her money too she won she wins
[46:01] everything amen amen
[46:03] amen
[46:08] there's a little work that we have asked
[46:12] because god will reward us at the end of
[46:14] the journey
[46:15] means per second what if you don't
[46:17] underestimate what you're doing amen
[46:19] amen amen
[46:22] a preacher that would preach
[46:23] vulnerability
[46:25] you don't know the things that you will
[46:27] say
[46:29] under the anointing
[46:34] they influence the impact that would do
[46:35] it in one source somewhere
[46:37] you just give yourself to god
[46:40] when god will use your gift personally
[46:42] now he can save us
[46:46] you don't know the world will come to
[46:48] you
[46:50] a brother that will sing
[46:52] that's why
[46:54] everything that we don't
[47:08] will come down
[47:10] amen amen season what shall tell you if
[47:13] i have to sing generally
[47:15] i have to sing in such a way that's your
[47:17] song when i sing
[47:18] yes
[47:19] even god will be happy about it
[47:27] as i was saying she said batman if it's
[47:29] this building
[47:31] we can't afford to pay it
[47:34] it means one thing
[47:36] will
[47:50] i'm
[47:59] the money to pay the mortgage they don't
[48:00] want to pay questions
[48:02] what god would do
[48:03] no
[48:04] shall we reward us
[48:11] do the work willingly
[48:16] we fear and conquer
[48:18] as ruth did
[48:19] amen amen
[48:22] knowing that our reward
[48:25] is not from the men upon the earth
[48:28] that is why i always say
[48:31] to your position always ask that
[48:46] today was you you didn't preach well
[48:51] do you want to tell me every time it was
[48:52] he was always good
[48:54] yeah basket
[48:56] brother say one time
[48:59] he started
[49:04] maybe one time when the spirit when
[49:06] anointing to attack the scene
[49:09] maybe that day that that day will go out
[49:12] and everybody will be looking away
[49:42] because today
[49:56] it was coming
[50:10] they went there to the judgment
[50:25] crucify him
[50:27] of the year man of god
[50:30] affair
[50:34] to wait for clapping
[50:37] we're working for boasts
[50:52] and i
[51:48] [Music]
[52:16] that we have
[52:18] that's what i told you
[52:21] uh that's what brother bonham says
[52:26] when roots started working
[52:30] with
[52:31] uh he started giving her instructions
[52:35] don't go anywhere else
[52:38] i even told him i charged my servant my
[52:40] reapers
[52:41] when they will work if only
[52:43] they can one day they will leave
[53:12] internet
[53:14] instead of uh picking them in the
[53:16] board's field
[53:18] because i can be assured okay
[53:21] even if i'm mistaken
[53:26] she works so hard in the bose field
[53:28] that revenge
[53:31] 90 percent she she should be a good girl
[53:34] ain't no partner larry mcconnell no
[53:35] somewhere here on the street
[53:40] traffic
[54:22] i want this thing not to be here you
[54:24] focus as well you want you should move
[54:26] it second shadow what i have to do
[54:29] i will obey what the pastor says
[54:32] amen amen
[54:35] a musician that's singing something a
[54:37] paranoid his life is not right
[54:40] the person comes and says
[54:43] brother can you sit down a little bit
[54:47] if you're a ruth you won't give up
[54:50] you won't ask questions why is there
[54:52] doing it
[54:53] why why written a possibility ruth
[54:55] doesn't ask questions
[54:58] stay here
[54:59] yeah don't go anywhere else
[55:01] [Applause]
[55:04] amen amen
[55:09] [Music]
[55:31] you have to have the obedience in your
[55:33] heart amen amen
[55:35] jesus christ if i'm a minister
[55:39] i know my limit amen amen amen
[55:43] if i sing
[55:45] and the person says
[56:06] the obedience lead someone to the
[56:08] adoption amendment amen
[56:12] we have been
[56:13] work obeying
[56:29] the message today
[56:30] and tomorrow it comes
[56:33] uh he comes right away a predator
[56:35] service after two three services
[56:41] i was a great
[56:42] singer was in the denomination
[56:47] you see him you see him coming
[56:49] this is a disorder
[56:51] dear i mean lord my god has said in
[56:53] order
[56:54] that's the reason why
[56:56] ruth has to follow talent
[56:59] revolution because she went there
[57:01] on the wheel working for boston
[57:04] working in the field mayor president
[57:07] after working
[57:09] she received all this
[57:22] without any doubt boaz was writing down
[57:36] everything that they said to here
[57:51] [Music]
[58:20] when we go back
[58:48] do it
[58:51] amen amen
[58:58] because we're talking about the work of
[59:00] ruth
[59:02] james
[59:05] you know
[59:06] they will never talk about this mission
[59:07] without talking about you
[59:12] they will never mention about this
[59:14] mission without talking about you
[59:16] can use that
[59:19] it means we have a play to a part to
[59:21] play in the plan of redemption
[59:27] if we are part of that plane
[59:42] foreign
[1:00:10] joining the church it's not all

[1:01:53] and when they passed the preaching of
[1:01:56] the evangelist who kelly kendall or
[1:01:58] something like that ella anthony
[1:02:01] depression he's preaching
[1:02:03] japan
[1:02:04] personally
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:21] with everything they got in them avex
[1:02:25] edema with the tight sesophant with the
[1:02:28] offering
[1:02:32] if
[1:03:22] but don't let that just be on the only
[1:03:24] thing
[1:03:26] get inoculated just say devotee that's
[1:03:29] what i'm trying to say
[1:03:33] the holy ghost
[1:03:36] and the rest of will come upon it
[1:03:41] and go together
[1:03:58] and to support this cause with the titan
[1:04:00] offering
[1:04:03] with everything that can be done in the
[1:04:05] church
[1:04:09] and if it happens that your pastor asked
[1:04:11] you to do something
[1:04:13] i advise you said the lord you should do
[1:04:16] it
[1:04:20] the past asked me to preach
[1:04:22] foreign
[1:04:52] do it willingly
[1:04:54] beloved jd okay
[1:04:57] i just say i would do it
[1:04:59] that's the day i tested it
[1:05:01] i was sick
[1:05:03] i came here
[1:05:06] and i said is
[1:06:02] they will take you to things when you
[1:06:04] ask for quotes
[1:06:06] and then they will tell you jesus
[1:06:08] i'm led to tell you this
[1:06:11] then i found out
[1:06:13] they're just hiding stuff
[1:06:16] and i told them
[1:06:31] be sure if your pastor is saved or not
[1:06:35] it should be assured if he has the holy
[1:06:37] ghost or not
[1:06:39] if he has the holy spirit
[1:06:41] and you sure it's amazing
[1:06:43] because her god has to reveal
[1:06:59] oh my god but why are you saying that
[1:07:01] i told them
[1:07:03] paul or paul b in the bible
[1:07:06] he preached the coincidence
[1:07:09] and then he said
[1:07:11] what i'm going to say
[1:07:27] because it wasn't coming from god
[1:07:30] imagined
[1:07:32] but why was he written in the bible
[1:07:39] we reached the point
[1:07:40] certainly
[1:07:54] i believe to have the holy ghost
[1:07:56] awesome
[1:07:57] successful messenger that's very hard
[1:08:00] but it's not always telepathic it's not
[1:08:02] enough it's a new testament this is the
[1:08:04] new testament i said let's go back to
[1:08:06] the others
[1:08:07] moses died joshua
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:36] is
[1:08:50] uh
[1:09:00] and you have to repeat what moses says
[1:09:02] eliza eve agerico and
[1:09:17] the only way to win the battle is to
[1:09:19] repeat what moses said that was written
[1:09:22] about why joshua then hillard open he
[1:09:25] told the people men are you see now
[1:09:28] pakistan
[1:09:30] you're not going to repeat what is
[1:09:31] written easy yeah
[1:09:44] where was he written in the book
[1:09:46] think of moses
[1:09:48] oh us that's a phone oh this is very
[1:09:51] very powerful
[1:09:52] yes it's really hard
[1:09:54] it's because you don't understand josue
[1:09:57] joshua who was a man of god
[1:09:59] in irreconcilable
[1:10:13] if you only have what is written son
[1:10:15] let's put a second avenger
[1:10:18] having the spirit of whom
[1:10:20] the three that is why we have a whole
[1:10:22] bunch of stuff
[1:10:23] is joshua joshua
[1:10:28] in jericho
[1:10:32] because it's god who led them to settle
[1:10:36] down
[1:10:36] the leadership of god in joshua
[1:10:40] to go around jericho yeah
