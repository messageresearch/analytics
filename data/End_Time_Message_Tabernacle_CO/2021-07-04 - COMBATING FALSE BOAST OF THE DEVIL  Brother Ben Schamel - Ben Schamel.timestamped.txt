[5:48] chapter 18
[5:50] i'll read a uh i'll read a couple of
[5:53] verses here and then i'll have you be
[5:56] seated
[6:00] um i'm going to do quite a bit of
[6:01] reading there's a story that takes
[6:03] three chapters long
[6:19] story is about a man named hezekiah
[6:23] and many of us know the story about
[6:25] hezekiah
[6:28] brother branham speaks of him as a man
[6:30] of faith
[6:33] he was a great man of god and brother
[6:36] branham said that his
[6:37] prayer changed the very plan of god
[6:43] brother branham uses him as an example
[6:45] the prophetic point on an example
[6:48] of what prayer can do in your life
[6:52] when you have troubles come your way
[6:58] brother branham says prayer changes
[7:00] things
[7:03] the scripture says that uh the prayer of
[7:05] a righteous man
[7:13] not a little bit but your prayer
[7:17] my prayer can change the mind of
[7:20] almighty god
[7:23] amen that's a pretty incredible thought
[7:27] this story here is not so well known
[7:30] for being but it happened when hezekiah
[7:32] was still young
[7:38] amen second kings 18 i'll read verses
[7:40] one through seven and then i'll have you
[7:42] seated
[7:46] and it came to pass in the third year of
[7:48] hoshia the son of elka the king of
[7:50] israel
[7:51] that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of
[7:53] judah began to reign
[7:55] twenty and five years old was he and he
[7:57] began to reign
[7:58] and he reigned 29 years in jerusalem his
[8:01] mother's name was also
[8:03] abby the daughter of zechariah and he
[8:06] did that which was right in the sight of
[8:08] the lord
[8:08] according to all that david his father
[8:10] did he removed the hype
[8:13] places and break down the images and cut
[8:15] down the groves
[8:16] and break in pieces the brazen serpent
[8:18] that moses had made
[8:20] for unto those days the children of
[8:22] israel did burn incense to it
[8:24] and he and called it
[8:28] he trusted in the lord god of israel so
[8:31] that after him
[8:32] was none like him among all the kings of
[8:34] judah
[8:35] nor any that were before him for he
[8:38] claimed unto the lord and departed not
[8:40] from following him but kept his
[8:42] commandments
[8:43] which the lord commanded moses and the
[8:46] lord was with him and he prospered
[8:48] whether so ever he went forth
[8:50] and he rebelled against the king of
[8:52] assyria and served him
[8:54] not
[8:57] would you like to read it in french sure
[9:02] what israel is
[10:05] amen may the lord add a blessing to the
[10:07] reading of his word you may be seated
[10:11] we will continue reading here just so we
[10:13] can get a background to the story
[10:18] so if you have your scriptures and you'd
[10:20] like to follow along with us
[10:23] we're going to hop to verse 22.
[10:27] but and and this is a servant of the
[10:30] king of assyria comes
[10:32] to jerusalem jerusalem
[10:35] and he says but if you say to me
[10:40] we trust in the lord our god
[10:44] notre dame is not that he whose high
[10:47] priest places
[10:48] whose alters hezekiah taketh away
[10:58] and said to judah in jerusalem you shall
[11:01] worship before
[11:02] this altar in jerusalem
[11:09] now therefore i pray thee
[11:13] now give me pledges
[11:16] give pledges to my lord the king of
[11:18] assyria
[11:19] faith and i will deliver
[11:23] 2 000 horses if thou be able to on my
[11:27] part
[11:27] to set writers on them
[11:34] so here's the servant of another king
[11:39] they're an enemy
[11:55] saying i will give you 2 000 horses
[11:59] if you have enough writers to put on
[12:01] them
[12:06] 24. he says how then wilt thou turn away
[12:10] the face
[12:11] of one captain
[12:16] of the least of my master servants
[12:21] and put that i trust in egypt
[12:24] for chariots and horsemen
[12:28] and i now come up without the lord
[12:34] against this place to destroy it
[13:04] eddie saying hear the word of the great
[13:08] king
[13:10] the king of assyria thus saith the king
[13:15] let not hezekiah deceive you
[13:19] for he shall not be able to deliver you
[13:21] out of his hand
[13:25] neither let hezekiah make you trust in
[13:27] the lord
[13:31] saying the lord will surely deliver us
[13:35] and this shitty shall not be delivered
[13:37] into the hands
[13:42] of hezekiah for thus saith the king of
[13:46] assyria
[14:01] his fig tree and drink ye everyone hit
[14:04] the waters of his sister
[14:08] until i come and take you into a land
[14:11] like your own land
[14:47] he says hath any of the gods of the
[14:49] nations delivered
[14:51] at all his land out of the hand of the
[14:54] king of assyria
[14:55] the nation until delivered
[15:14] have they delivered samaria out of my
[15:17] hand
[15:19] you see the boasting that he's doing no
[15:21] one can stand against the king of the
[15:24] series
[15:33] and hezekiah sent messengers unto the
[15:35] prophet of the age
[15:38] and isaiah said unto them yes thus
[15:42] shall you say unto your master
[15:45] thus saith the lord
[15:48] be not afraid of the words which thou
[15:50] hast heard
[15:52] about with which the servants of the
[15:55] king of assyria have been blasphemed
[16:01] behold i will send a blast upon him
[16:04] jeremiah
[16:05] and he shall hear a rumor
[16:09] and shall return into his own land
[16:14] and i will cause him to fall by the
[16:16] sword in his own land
[16:20] verse 32 verses therefore thus saith the
[16:24] lord concerning the king of assyria
[16:31] he shall not come into this city
[16:34] nor shoot
[17:02] to save it for my own sake
[17:05] and for my servant david's sake yeah
[17:09] and it came to pass that night that the
[17:12] angel
[17:13] of the lord went out
[17:16] and he smote in the camp of the
[17:18] assyrians
[17:21] 104 in 5 000.
[17:28] and when they arose early in the morning
[17:57] that the devil is really boasting
[18:13] what is it that's going to perform
[18:27] i foreign buildings collapsing out of
[18:31] nowhere
[18:34] all of these things that are happening
[18:35] in the world today
[18:38] it's the devil boasting
[18:55] there's no way that you can overcome
[18:56] yeah pam where could you piss franco
[18:58] don't listen to your pastor pastor when
[19:01] he says with the lord you can overcome
[19:03] god don't listen to your parents
[19:07] when they try to train you in the way of
[19:08] them
[19:28] isn't it interesting he promised a land
[19:30] like their land
[19:31] imagined if he was going to take them to
[19:36] a land like their
[19:48] i'm going to take you to a land where
[19:49] you can be happy
[20:15] what he wanted is you to stay put
[20:28] and then one day i'm going to come and
[20:29] i'm going to get you hey
[20:32] and i'm
[21:12] but things get worse and worse
[21:16] amen amen so how do we combat these
[21:19] false boasts of the devil
[21:23] the boasts with faith
[21:27] there's nothing that we can do within
[21:29] ourselves
[21:31] but we must have faith in god when you
[21:33] develop our fought on you
[21:35] when the numbers are are too high
[21:39] when there's too many with the enemy
[22:09] faith is not something that we just put
[22:11] on la force
[22:14] faith isn't something it's not some hope
[22:16] so
[22:18] experience but but faith is something
[22:20] that we
[22:21] firmly believe on absolute
[22:24] the scripture says in hebrews that faith
[22:26] is a substance
[22:28] between something's not seen
[22:31] it's an evidence it's an evidence before
[22:35] the results certain evidence
[22:38] hallelujah
[22:45] hallelujah amen isn't it great that god
[22:47] can give us something
[22:49] more something tangible we can hold it
[23:01] like a sheep doesn't manufacture wool
[23:04] coma
[23:06] coma
[23:11] thank you he doesn't have to pray to the
[23:14] lord

[23:39] it goes on its day just like it does
[23:41] every day oh it contributes on some eggs
[23:44] it's just eating grass oh it continues
[23:47] to remain some water
[23:48] continued
[24:02] inside
[24:16] it doesn't bring forth fear
[24:21] it doesn't bring forth regrets it brings
[24:24] forth
[24:25] faith and faith grows stronger
[24:29] this is like a muscle the force come and
[24:32] miscreate the more you use
[24:33] faith uh the prison the stronger it gets
[24:36] the
[24:36] truth and your faith you can overcome
[24:40] bigger things
[24:42] and bigger things become true and bigger
[24:44] things
[24:45] it's one day it's a water that's the
[24:47] same fate set memphis
[24:49] change your body into a younger body
[24:54] and we're going to step one of these
[24:55] days from this
[24:58] body
[25:19] if we want to put fear in today's terms
[25:21] anxiety
[25:24] oh it's such a big thing in today's
[25:26] world sorry
[25:28] anxiety is such a big thing in today's
[25:30] world
[25:33] everyone's suffering from anxiety
[25:40] fear is a spirit and society is a spirit
[25:44] alongside this it's that you said you
[25:45] said then it's free amen
[25:47] amen believe that this morning
[25:52] but we see that even in the human nature
[25:58] humankind is not as strong as they once
[26:00] were
[26:04] why because of all of this hybrid food
[26:07] of course the two says
[26:27] and then satan has done the same thing
[26:29] to the believer in ladies
[26:35] what has he done he's made
[26:41] we don't have to face the fierce uh uh
[26:44] uh romans
[26:45] that they had to back in the bible days
[26:50] to say we didn't have the persecution in
[26:53] the dark ages
[26:59] but if we just make things easy
[27:04] where we can sit in church please
[27:07] pay our tithes shake the preacher's hand
[27:12] and off we go hey we've done our
[27:15] religious duties for the week

[27:39] we think we're rich we think we have all
[27:42] these things
[27:44] we're naked we're blind we saw my friend
[28:00] he says now isn't it strange
[28:04] just like it is now he was talking about
[28:07] the disciples
[28:10] and how they got on the boat with jesus
[28:13] and they had a testimony service
[28:14] services and services
[28:17] of all these great things they have just
[28:19] seen jesus do the tuskegee zone visas
[28:21] refer
[28:22] okay and they're on the water and he
[28:25] says as we're coming down to the end
[28:26] isn't it strange
[29:10] new lesson in petite maladies or a
[29:12] little s trouble strike the home
[29:17] watch what happens it's all gone to
[29:20] pieces
[29:23] all hope is gone
[29:38] when the is preaching me happy
[29:41] i can say hallelujah hallelujah i can
[29:43] say praise the lord
[29:45] but when correction comes yeah
[29:50] when correction comes we should still
[29:52] shout hallelujah
[30:06] hallelujah
[30:10] amen amen we praise the lord for his
[30:12] correction
[30:15] paragraph 115. he says trouble set in
[30:20] and they forgot that the very one they
[30:24] were talking about
[30:26] the person
[30:29] the very creator
[30:34] was in the boat with them
[30:38] those storms start to rise
[30:42] oh we've got great revival meetings
[30:46] we get in our car and we start going to
[30:48] another place
[31:01] he's still in the boat with you today
[31:04] and it doesn't matter how high those
[31:06] waves get it's coming out it doesn't
[31:09] matter how much that boat is tossing
[31:11] again but the same jesus christ
[31:15] that was with brother branham get that
[31:17] right now this in those meetings
[31:20] that was in the burning bush with moses
[31:23] jesus christ but memphis is with us
[31:26] today
[31:28] so why are we afraid
[31:46] and we're afraid how we're going to
[31:47] provide us
[31:49] we're afraid how we're going to uh keep
[31:51] our health
[31:52] free
[31:55] we are sons and daughters of some
[31:58] defeats they defeat the druid
[31:59] hey man that ought to make us happy
[32:03] oh it reminds me of that story
[32:06] a man came to buy slaves uh
[32:10] he's looking at all of those slaves
[32:55] no it's the same message but what makes
[32:58] us happy
[32:59] because we can identify with the
[33:03] scripture
[33:04] with the message and we know that we are
[33:07] a child
[33:21] amen enthusiasm
[33:24] it's god in you
[33:27] that's what enthusiasm is the second
[33:29] enthusiasm
[33:30] amen we're talking about false boasts
[33:36] there's many many examples we could take
[33:38] throughout the scriptures
[33:42] on how satan wants to boast
[33:47] have you ever played basketball or
[33:49] soccer
[33:50] basketball
[34:03] oh i'm so good
[34:08] [Music]
[34:32] no because we have the all-star on our
[34:34] team
[34:38] amen but we don't have to boast because
[34:41] we are sure where we stay
[34:44] we don't have to try to convince other
[34:45] people we know what we're doing now
[34:46] about convacular zones the secondary
[34:48] physical because we are on god's side
[34:50] that's gonna sound decorated
[34:52] amen amen but one time there was a
[34:55] little
[34:56] ruddy fellow man julia van nom
[34:59] i pretty much and he had built up
[35:03] strong faith in god in grant foreign and
[35:07] he was a young man named
[35:09] david davido and when we think of david
[35:13] we think of such a great man a component
[35:15] that vidcom and gotham
[35:17] a a man that was had so much faith in
[35:20] the lord
[35:23] a man that had overcome so many things
[35:29] but i don't want you to think of david
[35:30] like that
[35:33] i want you to go back with me before all
[35:36] of that happened
[35:39] david was just like you and i let's say
[35:42] he's
[35:43] 12 14 years old
[35:46] and he's doing chores for his daddy
[35:52] sometimes we limit our our kids our
[35:54] siblings all the children
[36:03] here's david 12 14 years old
[36:06] watching his father's sheep by himself
[36:10] uh
[36:32] so what happens every time a trial comes
[36:35] in
[36:36] so many times we're saying oh lord take
[36:37] this from me
[36:41] and the lord is saying i am giving you
[36:43] an opportunity to grow
[36:47] we're trying to refuse that opportunity
[36:51] instead of looking at that trial that's
[36:53] an opportunity to grow close
[36:58] so here's young little david and john
[37:00] david do we have any
[37:01] kids here 12 14 years old
[37:06] got some young ones in the
[37:25] 12 14 years old and what did he do
[37:29] did he pull out his iphone and whoa
[37:34] text his dad
[37:45] see it's done sephini
[37:50] no but he sprung into action
[37:55] but when that when that we're not
[37:56] promised
[37:58] when david's father's promised that's
[38:01] stolen by the enemy
[38:14] no no what we need to do is together as
[38:17] a family
[38:19] are talking for me with childlike faith
[38:22] we need to claim the promises for our
[38:24] parents
[38:26] as many times as a church we see these
[38:30] problems with other people in the church
[38:33] we think that's their problem but when
[38:36] we need
[38:36] me we need some little david's zombies
[38:40] they'll get down on their knees and
[38:42] they'll go to bat they keep on living
[38:44] they will fight
[38:58] hey amen amen he had a right to go get
[39:00] that chef
[39:04] amen amen so what seemed to be just
[39:07] another monday morning
[39:11] normal doing chores for his daddy
[39:16] it was just another normal day but
[39:20] what he didn't realize at the time
[39:26] was he was about to have a trial
[39:30] he was about ready to have an
[39:32] opportunity
[39:35] to grow his faith
[39:38] a man amen
[39:45] he didn't look at the symptom
[39:48] but he looked at the promise
[39:52] brother branham said but you see faith
[39:56] knows no failure
[40:00] hallelujah yes i think i need to say
[40:03] that again
[40:05] that faith knows no failure
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:22] hallelujah amen praise the lord praise
[40:24] the lord it says it's
[40:25] anchored okay it stays right there
[40:30] no matter what anything said bro
[40:34] i don't care if the doctor says this is
[40:36] an incurable disease
[40:49] or are we listening to thus saith the
[40:51] lord
[40:53] praise the lord i'll i'll side with us
[41:01] in the supernatural mastodon let's see
[41:04] what the doctor
[41:09] amen we've got friends that live in
[41:11] oklahoma
[41:14] their last name is green uh
[41:18] lord north green and they were atheists
[41:21] probably six or seven years ago
[41:25] and they come into the message
[41:29] and they don't know anything and
[41:32] they had smoked a female they've done
[41:35] drugs
[41:38] oh they drank a zombie and this sister's
[41:42] colon was
[41:43] destroyed
[41:59] and she came to the pastor down there
[42:03] the pastor said here's my situation did
[42:05] i get my situation what do i do
[42:08] and he says well you pray
[42:11] you give the lord your need uh
[42:36] [Music]
[42:42] she didn't take any surgery
[42:45] she had no scar there they didn't even
[42:48] replace her cola
[42:51] oh but they went through a surgery that
[42:53] the doctor didn't know about
[43:09] perfectly healthy
[43:22] amen so david turned a trial into an
[43:25] experience with the lord
[43:28] experience maybe we're going through
[43:30] trials today
[43:34] maybe financial troubles maybe troubles
[43:37] with our health
[43:40] maybe maybe the devil's just trying to
[43:41] steal your joy but that
[43:43] was just the part of what's wrong i
[43:45] think every single one of us can
[43:46] remember
[43:49] when we were first saved
[44:06] we've
[44:20] is some little davis second of all how
[44:23] many people do you get little david
[44:24] you're sorry
[44:25] i'm gonna fight for what's rightfully
[44:28] and the devil can't steal my joy
[44:32] because it is my problem it's not his
[44:38] amen praise the lord so we need to have
[44:40] a showdown with the devil right now
[44:45] [Music]
[44:48] so here's david and he has two
[44:50] experiences with the lord
[44:52] experience and then we get to samuel
[44:55] chav
[44:56] chapter 17.
[45:00] and there comes this big giant voila
[45:15] how big his armor
[45:28] he's had two experiences with the lord
[46:03] amen amen the scripture says that david
[46:05] encouraged himself in the lord
[46:08] he knew how to write himself
[46:21] this giant comes out twice every day
[46:25] saying i despise
[46:40] and what's notable is saul was
[46:44] head and shoulders above all the other
[46:46] israelites
[46:50] but he was scared
[46:54] he should have been the leader of
[46:57] the leader goliath would have been the
[46:59] smallest to saul than any of the others
[47:05] but he didn't have the same experiences
[47:09] those experiences that david had was
[47:11] preparing him for this day
[47:16] those trials that david had seen in the
[47:18] past
[47:20] getting him ready for this big child
[47:22] that was coming
[47:27] david had an experience that he could
[47:29] point back to hey
[47:31] he said two weeks ago in some youth
[47:33] meetings
[47:35] i had an experienced
[47:48] so what is this giant now it is
[47:58] satan is trying to just get you to
[48:00] destroy yourself
[48:04] in your own
[48:19] boasting for 40 days
[48:25] saying choose you a man
[48:30] one on one here we go
[48:46] he starts making his boasts
[48:50] and those words fell on the wrong ears
[48:52] that day
[48:56] because those words fell on the ears of
[48:59] a believer
[49:00] says that suits
[49:13] say i have already had an experience
[49:15] because are you an expert
[49:17] and this trial will be no different why
[49:20] because my
[49:20] anger is the same
[49:23] hallelujah and nothing is going to
[49:26] change
[49:28] so choose you this day
[49:31] so david says why are you all cowering
[49:33] down
[49:36] this uncircumcised philistine has no
[49:38] rights
[49:40] we have the right lucifer we are the
[49:42] children
[49:53] so then david goes and saul calls him up
[50:09] oh you're too small to fight
[50:40] he overcame by the word of his testimony
[50:46] well you better wear my armor
[50:49] you see saul was afraid it
[51:06] fear loves company
[51:10] so many times as believers
[51:13] we hear these testimonies of other
[51:14] believers
[51:17] oh i've got such and such a problem i
[51:20] praise the
[51:35] on you see what saul is doing there do
[51:36] you want to tell you that affair
[51:39] because of his lack of faith he's trying
[51:41] to impose that on david i cause there's
[51:43] some mob the foreign so you better try
[51:46] this twelve step program that i tried
[51:47] it wonders it
[52:00] here's saul way up here head and
[52:02] shoulders above everybody so you know
[52:04] what was he thinking of course that
[52:07] armor is not going to fit david
[52:12] david said i haven't proved definitely
[52:16] i don't have experience with some
[52:18] 12-step program
[52:21] i have an experience with the lord
[52:23] experience
[52:25] and my confidence is in him not in some
[52:28] armor
[52:29] but my confidence is in the lord
[52:39] david goes out hey david italy he picks
[52:41] up
[52:42] five smooth stones of faith
[53:00] take it from here on out okay from uh
[53:03] apache dc
[53:05] no david had more to do daffy dave plus
[53:08] affair
[53:09] the lord could move mountains he said uh
[53:39] he's put us here in the last stage for a
[53:41] reason
[53:43] what hands does god have but yours
[53:46] what hands does he have
[53:50] what feet does god have but yours
[53:54] what
[54:12] no no david was enthusiastic
[54:18] he knew what he had in his sleep more
[54:20] importantly he knew he
[54:22] who he had in his heart and he went out
[54:25] with
[54:25] enthusiasm and he gave god everything
[54:28] that he could give him
[54:30] and he went out there and swung that is
[54:32] as hard as he could
[54:35] and once it left the sling
[54:38] once david had no more control
[54:41] that is when the lord can say but we
[54:44] must give god
[54:45] everything we'll give him all of our
[54:50] prayers
[55:23] they're trying to give their everything
[55:24] done
[55:26] why am i because they're they're king
[55:28] basically
[55:30] scored a three-pointer
[55:40] amen but when we see someone get saved
[55:45] that should create a revival
[56:00] but people give me more give me uh
[56:03] hallelujah amen the creator of heaven
[56:05] and earth is living in us
[56:08] that's a reason to shout selectively
[56:10] that's a reason to give him praise
[56:13] the least we could do is raise our hands
[56:15] say glory to god
[56:18] amen hallelujah amen
[56:21] we need to give god our everything
[56:26] right then when it gets beyond us then
[56:28] the lord can take it because
[57:06] she didn't save some of the perfume
[57:08] perfume for later
[57:10] but she bought
[57:25] or uh too angry
[57:29] brother branham says that's the way
[57:30] you've got to come to him
[57:35] he says give him all the praise pour out
[57:38] all the glory on him lay everything down
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:44] he says that's why we can't have revival
[57:48] because you're stingy with it he said
[57:52] you want to share some of your glory
[57:53] with
[57:54] something else
[58:00] go out miss jones you know she wears
[58:03] these kind of clothes
[58:07] or she does this or she does this
[58:10] or if this is she says
[58:14] yeah you're too stingy with it
[58:18] you want to share your glory with
[58:19] something else
[58:33] wow wow because we're trying to save
[58:37] some of the glory for something else
[58:41] we're trying to save some of our praise
[58:43] for something else
[58:45] no we need to pour out all of our
[58:47] prayers
[58:54] amen amen praise the lord yes that's a
[58:57] good quote
[58:58] praise god
[59:01] oh you pharisee you walk along and you
[59:04] want to pattern after somebody else
[59:15] yeah he says no wonder jesus can't break
[59:18] through this nation on a revival
[59:28] but our eyes should be on the lord
[59:36] amen so we're going to hop back
[59:39] to second kings real quick
[59:44] and hopefully i won't be much longer
[59:53] eighteen and four i wanna bring your
[59:56] attention to this verse number four
[1:00:07] it says and he removed the high praise
[1:00:09] places and break
[1:00:10] down the images and cut the groves and
[1:00:14] break in pieces the brazen serpent that
[1:00:16] moses had made
[1:00:37] that brazen serpent that was over in
[1:00:40] numbers 21.
[1:00:44] that same serpent that that that gave
[1:00:46] them victory
[1:00:50] they gave them freedom they gave them
[1:00:54] life
[1:00:56] and the scriptures saying he was in the
[1:00:58] will of the lord when he broke it down
[1:01:04] i think that's just shows the
[1:01:05] denominational spirit that they were
[1:01:07] fighting back then
[1:01:19] amen and we see throughout the seven
[1:01:22] churches
[1:01:25] the the the the messenger to that age
[1:01:28] would grab a scripture
[1:01:31] and he would run with it and they would
[1:01:33] have a revival with it
[1:01:36] and then they'd denominate
[1:01:49] around the brazen serpent is
[1:02:04] so antichrist they try to take brother
[1:02:07] branham
[1:02:08] they put him in the place of god and by
[1:02:11] doing so
[1:02:13] they make him antichrists
[1:02:17] oh took him off the field oh
[1:02:20] uh denomination
[1:02:26] but he removed the denominational
[1:02:29] barriers
[1:02:33] amen verse 22.
[1:02:38] but if you say unto me this is the the
[1:02:41] servant of the king of assyria speaking
[1:02:46] uh
[1:02:56] is that not he whose high places and
[1:02:58] whose altars hezekiah have taken away
[1:03:08] and hath said to judah in jerusalem ye
[1:03:10] shall worship before this
[1:03:12] altar in jerusalem
[1:03:28] isn't he the same guy
[1:03:33] that tore down all of these other things
[1:03:35] okay
[1:03:37] try to make him look like he's made a
[1:03:39] mistake over here
[1:04:10] trying to create
[1:04:35] all these liberal and conservatives
[1:04:52] you know amen
[1:04:55] so wait wait so
[1:05:00] isn't this your pastor that tore down
[1:05:03] the the oneness
[1:05:05] is the
[1:05:17] if you don't believe the return ministry
[1:05:18] like i believe it you're not going in
[1:05:20] the rapture
[1:05:35] now therefore i pray thee
[1:05:39] go ahead chris i give pledges
[1:05:43] to my lord the king of assyria and i
[1:05:46] will deliver thee
[1:05:47] 2 000 horses if thou be able to set
[1:05:50] rioters on them
[1:06:00] false promises those horses aren't going
[1:06:04] to be theirs
[1:06:07] those horses are going to be the same
[1:06:08] horses that carry them back into
[1:06:09] captivity
[1:06:13] captivity that's what the devil does
[1:06:16] he'll show you the glamour iv glamour
[1:06:20] but he won't show you what's on the
[1:06:21] inside
[1:06:22] i'll show you the end story
[1:06:26] i'll just take a little drink oh you'll
[1:06:29] have a good time
[1:06:45] verse 25 verses am i now come up
[1:06:49] without the lord against this place to
[1:06:51] destroy it
[1:06:57] can you see that snake
[1:07:12] for the lord said unto me go against
[1:07:16] this land and destroy it
[1:07:19] let's put that in today's terms
[1:07:22] it's the lord's will that you're lost
[1:07:36] yeah you can be safe but you're not
[1:07:38] bright
[1:07:42] you see the trick of the devil i've got
[1:07:45] the word of the lord
[1:07:47] look at this quote you said there might
[1:07:50] be one out of this city and one out of
[1:07:51] that city and
[1:07:52] you live in the same city as your pastor
[1:07:54] uh
[1:08:03] but watch how it changes from the word
[1:08:04] of the lord to the king of the syrian
[1:08:22] stood and cried with a loud voice in the
[1:08:24] jew's language
[1:08:29] he's speaking the same language as the
[1:08:31] jews do
[1:08:34] he seems to be as one of them
[1:08:37] saying hear the word of the great
[1:08:41] king the king of assyria
[1:08:47] he starts off with the word of the lord
[1:09:02] no we must stick with the words
[1:09:19] let hezekiah make you trust in the lord
[1:09:21] saying
[1:09:24] the lord will surely deliver us
[1:09:28] and this city shall not be
[1:09:30] delivered
[1:09:32] of assyria
[1:09:43] any of the gods of the nations delivered
[1:09:45] at all
[1:09:46] his hand or his land out of the hand of
[1:09:49] the king of assyria
[1:09:54] look young people
[1:09:59] did god hold this so and so that went
[1:10:02] astray
[1:10:08] youth group he was so on fire for god
[1:10:14] yeah he claimed to have the holy ghost
[1:10:17] but the
[1:10:17] the the the holding power of the lord
[1:10:20] didn't help him
[1:10:22] how's it going
[1:10:34] they're going to be lying to you
[1:10:37] so the next time the devil comes to
[1:10:39] boast
[1:10:41] a claim
[1:10:56] listen to the
[1:11:02] where are all these other gods whose
[1:11:04] songs
[1:11:05] second kings 196.
[1:11:10] dysnoxis so they bring this to the
[1:11:12] prophet of the age
[1:11:15] of prophet and isaiah says unto them
[1:11:18] thus shall you say to your master
[1:11:22] thus saith the lord be
[1:11:25] not afraid of the words which thou hast
[1:11:27] heard
[1:11:30] with which the servants of the king of
[1:11:32] assyria
[1:11:33] have blasphemed
[1:11:38] behold i will send a blast upon him
[1:11:42] he shall hear a rumor it shall return to
[1:11:46] his own land
[1:11:48] and i will cause him to fall by his own
[1:11:50] sword
[1:12:02] the word blast means a wind
[1:12:06] or it means a spirit with heavy
[1:12:09] breathing
[1:12:09] it's a common and it's uh as
[1:12:13] a souffle
[1:12:16] a spirit of heavy breathing
[1:12:33] and he's not even going to shoot an
[1:12:34] arrow at this city
[1:12:40] i want to tell you church please if you
[1:12:43] think we
[1:12:44] suffer from anxiety and fear and
[1:12:45] depression
[1:13:03] and the child of god gets down on his
[1:13:05] knees
[1:13:07] and that demon comes running back to
[1:13:09] hell
[1:13:13] satan did you hear that's what you want
[1:13:30] he goes what you did quoi that can't be
[1:13:32] right oh no
[1:13:34] shane's bounding them down
[1:13:38] oh we had them handcuffed they couldn't
[1:13:41] raise their hand because we had them
[1:13:42] handsome
[1:14:26] before the beginning
[1:14:33] and they open up their spiritual ears
[1:14:36] and they start hearing this
[1:15:20] they're probably trying to give them to
[1:15:21] you because they don't want them
[1:15:35] that's right they were cursed to the
[1:15:37] lord back then and they're still cursed
[1:15:43] but what are you going to do with that
[1:15:44] box oh i hate snakes i'll just i'll just
[1:15:48] leave it in
[1:15:49] a closet
[1:16:04] to do you said no no no no no i ain't
[1:16:08] signing that page because i've been
[1:16:09] passing this
[1:16:10] you can take those devils and you can
[1:16:12] send it back
[1:16:16] and when that comes back to satan
[1:16:18] because
[1:16:32] he's scared he's running out of time
[1:16:36] what do we have we have to look forward
[1:16:37] because time is running out
[1:16:40] experiences
[1:16:43] we're going to live eternally because i
[1:16:44] don't leave right there anymore what
[1:16:46] promise does the devil have promised
[1:16:49] he's got hell waiting for him on the
[1:16:51] other side
[1:16:57] oh praise the lord
[1:17:01] but that blast is going to hit satan
[1:17:03] harder than it hits us
[1:17:10] hallelujah hallelujah when he thought he
[1:17:14] had you coin
[1:17:19] what a disappointment for the devil oh
[1:17:23] this is deception why because the
[1:17:26] children of israel had a promise
[1:17:31] amen 1933
[1:17:35] prophet says by the way that he came
[1:17:41] by the same shall he return amen
[1:17:49] and shall not come into this city saith
[1:17:51] the lord
[1:17:55] the promise of the lord
[1:18:08] he told me to apply the token on you and
[1:18:10] your house
[1:18:13] and they cannot be lost
[1:18:16] why because it's your inheritance
[1:18:20] amen it's your right it's your promise
[1:18:35] amen so he departed and went and
[1:18:37] returned and dwelt in nineveh
[1:18:41] 36 king of assyria
[1:18:45] hello yes go ahead
[1:18:48] 37 and it came to pass
[1:18:52] hello
[1:19:04] that his two sons whatever however
[1:19:19] there was not one israelite soldier
[1:19:23] israel not one soldier from judah
[1:19:27] that had to lift a sword against the
[1:19:29] king
[1:19:32] why because they had a promise from the
[1:19:34] lord
[1:19:37] that i will fight your battle because
[1:19:41] when it looked like there was no
[1:19:43] possible way
[1:19:46] god made a way
[1:19:53] when you're standing on the walls of
[1:19:54] jericho looking out against those
[1:19:56] assyrian armies
[1:20:00] of soldiers
[1:20:03] and in one night god killed 185
[1:20:08] 000.
[1:20:11] overnight just like that
[1:20:17] if he could do that for them back then
[1:20:20] how much more would god do that for us
[1:20:24] when he sees his little bride out here
[1:20:27] struggling against the things we have to
[1:20:29] struggle with
[1:20:39] and he didn't want to live in paradise
[1:20:41] by himself
[1:20:43] but he wants a bride to live with
[1:21:09] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:21:12] paragraph
[1:21:13] 447.
[1:21:20] he says but in every generation
[1:21:26] every revival brings forth some prophet
[1:21:29] of god
[1:21:29] amen amen
[1:21:34] a prophet is a preacher a prophet
[1:21:36] predicate
[1:21:37] a true preacher on the word
[1:21:45] and they bring forth a revival that
[1:21:47] gathers the elect
[1:21:49] of that generation
[1:21:55] hallelujah amen yes sir so we believe
[1:21:57] that we're living in a revival
[1:22:01] only a revival but we're living in the
[1:22:05] greatest revival of all time
[1:22:35] a revival that we can see ourselves in
[1:22:37] the world
[1:22:40] a revival because we can see that the
[1:22:42] rapture is coming
[1:22:46] and i believe in this revival
[1:22:49] it won't just be a revival because the
[1:22:51] sick were healed
[1:22:54] there won't be a revival because the
[1:22:55] blind can see
[1:22:59] before i don't believe it'll be a
[1:23:00] revival just because the dead walk
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:17] where you don't need healing from
[1:23:18] sickness
[1:23:20] where you don't need your blinded eyes
[1:23:22] to be old
[1:23:24] but i believe it will be in this revival
[1:23:28] where we will see our theophany body
[1:23:46] do you know that song i don't think
[1:23:50] my theophany is calling out to me do you
[1:23:52] know that song
[1:23:54] i don't think so no no
[1:23:57] there's i've got the chorus here
[1:24:00] and i don't have much voice left but i
[1:24:02] want to sing this song i don't know if
[1:24:04] you guys have heard it
[1:24:10] it goes like this i'll read you the
[1:24:11] words it says one day
[1:24:14] i'm gonna take a step to play yeah if
[1:24:16] you can play it
[1:24:17] let's play it
[1:24:21] because this is what's got me excited
[1:24:25] brother brandon thought the rapture was
[1:24:26] coming in his age that was
[1:24:28] 50 years ago 60 years ago we are
[1:24:32] that much closer to seeing artheophany
[1:24:36] because one of these mornings we're
[1:24:38] going to be
