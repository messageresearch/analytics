[6:31] it was really wonderful
[6:43] [Music]
[7:02] i was with pastor kambali and many other

[7:06] asked me to greet you
[7:12] so i went for
[7:16] pastor muya's son
[7:21] who had his wedding july 10.
[7:29] so he wanted me to stay there after
[7:32] the wedding
[7:36] but i could not do it because of some uh
[7:40] weddings here of course the the javed
[7:43] conservancy so
[7:44] i preferred i preferred to go earlier
[7:51] and the height after the wedding
[7:56] celebrations and that's what was
[7:59] done it's a security effect so
[8:02] um the first sunday uh
[8:05] i mean i landed there i think tuesday
[8:09] elijah liu maori
[8:24] so it was
[8:38] this is where i had about five services
[8:45] i preached on uh the divine
[8:48] vaccine
[8:52] i think that was a timely message
[8:59] so i was a preaching waiting for the
[9:01] time for
[9:02] us to go to belgium because his son
[9:05] married a sister from pastor cambale's
[9:07] church
[9:08] in belgium
[9:22] so after the first service as i greeted
[9:24] the people outside
[9:26] yeah service conscious on exterior
[9:29] i saw a sister i knew
[9:34] we talked a little bit and i'm preparing
[9:36] i asked the sister where's your husband
[9:38] i didn't see him in the service you
[9:39] should demonstrate
[9:40] way too much have you done your service
[9:42] oh no the father is
[9:44] uh in a critical condition in hospital
[9:47] only foreign
[10:01] i said you know sister the only thing i
[10:03] can do because i always travel with
[10:05] a tissue that uh brother
[10:09] prayed upon a surveillance session
[10:17] i gave to the sister god give to the
[10:19] brother
[10:21] of her and uh two days later i went to
[10:23] the hospital
[10:26] i saw the brother really dying
[10:43] there is nothing that can hold my
[10:46] healing inheritance
[10:48] he had faith we prayed
[10:53] i left that was a tuesday
[10:57] wednesday after i finished the wednesday
[10:59] service
[11:02] one of the deacons told me that uh you
[11:04] know the hospital
[11:05] has already given up on him
[11:11] and they gave him a choice only i do not
[11:14] ensure either to stay in the hospital
[11:16] and die
[11:18] or to go home to stay with his kids to
[11:21] say goodbye to them
[11:25] and he decided to go home and stay with
[11:28] the kids
[11:31] so wednesday they send him home
[11:35] and he told me after church to come to
[11:37] his house
[11:53] he was almost dying at home you see more
[11:56] amazon and they came they took him back
[11:59] to the hospital

[12:22] hospital and he passed away

[13:24] student mother for me
[13:25] they wanted them to be buried the
[13:27] following sunday saturday
[13:30] someday
[13:33] and that saturday was pastor moya's
[13:36] son wedding
[13:40] celebration brother we have a spirit
[13:44] all over yeah and that's why we find out
[13:48] that people are in the churches but no
[13:50] new birth
[13:51] in savanka in reconnaissance on the
[13:54] renaissance
[13:55] no new birth sound of renaissance and
[13:58] the people start putting pressure
[13:59] election commercial
[14:03] not even taking into consideration the
[14:06] condition of their pastor
[14:07] a memphis consideration on the condition
[14:09] of our pastor
[14:10] this is how human beings always are
[14:13] everywhere
[15:09] are you going to be in the funeral or
[15:11] are you going to be in the party
[15:15] and you know people start even people
[15:17] who don't go to church
[15:19] so they may jump into our english they
[15:20] become more spiritual
[15:22] are you different from spiritual they
[15:23] start giving quote come on suddenly
[15:26] in the book of ecclesiastes better to be
[15:29] in the funeral
[15:30] than to be in the party of faith
[15:34] but god gave us a little bit of reserves
[15:38] not to say
[15:47] but it will be a vain scriptural battle
[15:51] and combat vendors equitable we have to
[15:54] use wisdom
[15:55] do you want to say that yes what to do
[15:57] or
[15:58] fair and the marriage was in belgium
[16:02] city on basic about a four hour drive of
[16:05] course
[16:06] in course the category and the wedding
[16:09] was scheduled
[16:10] too and uh
[16:14] past the sun and the past the family
[16:15] said past the first time you came
[16:17] for the wedding passage
[16:33] because we were scheduled to leave
[16:35] france to go to belgium on
[16:37] thursday two days before the wedding
[16:44] hotel room already booked
[16:49] but it was a tough decision message dave
[16:51] come on in decision julio
[16:52] but god did the help made you inside
[16:55] there finally
[16:56] with the pastor's condition finally
[16:58] conditioned you pastor you remember
[17:00] seeing him here oh
[17:02] why he could not make a trip the same
[17:05] day
[17:05] and be in good condition to attend the
[17:07] party
[17:12] so the pastor left with his family on
[17:14] thursday
[17:16] hello and i was
[17:19] forced to stay with my wife aged foxy
[17:21] the restaurant farm
[17:22] to do the funeral service a fairly
[17:25] selfish neighborhood
[17:26] i don't know the way people are done
[17:29] ask one of the local ministers
[17:33] to perform the service oh they found the
[17:35] salvation philanthropy but you know the
[17:36] people go
[17:37] talk to the sisters
[17:40] you know you are in this church
[17:44] this is the time you have to see what
[17:45] the church is going to do for you
[17:49] but it's a very very sad situation first
[17:52] of all my situation twister
[17:54] somebody has lost their husband i can
[17:56] crap your marriage instead of
[17:57] encouraging
[17:58] oh you're the you are coming with some
[18:01] things to put her down
[18:05] but uh we did the service on uh that
[18:08] saturday night for your selfish remember
[18:10] someday
[18:11] we want to we finished the service and
[18:14] then
[18:14] we took the car to belgium
[18:20] but uh as i was doing the service
[18:22] sometimes your physio selfies
[18:24] ah i preach on a little bit a little
[18:27] observation on the book of
[18:29] job expressions
[18:32] but towards the end
[18:35] i felt an inspiration inspiration
[18:39] i started talking to the sisters
[18:45] ah you are now dad and mom for your
[18:47] children trivia empowering male 1
[18:50] don't pay attention to the people
[18:52] sayings
[19:05] remember what happened with martin
[19:07] luther king
[19:27] what was martha's attitude messi quality
[19:30] to the mountain
[19:32] criticisms are always in the house
[19:37] people going instead of comfort somebody
[19:39] is to put
[19:40] somebody down already
[19:43] and you know sometimes you know a
[19:45] preacher remain a preacher
[19:49] and i told the people now you come to
[19:51] fill out their church for the funeral
[19:56] but where are you seeing the brother in
[19:58] the hospital
[20:04] now you are trying to put the system
[20:06] down i mean obviously say they have
[20:08] still and i'm pretty much sure
[20:11] as soon as the body is laid down in the
[20:14] casket
[20:14] or in the in the ground or she took a
[20:17] like
[20:18] you
[20:34] keep the attitude like a martyr girl
[20:36] like you cheat come out
[20:38] and the conclusion was a conclusion we
[20:40] are leaving a critical time
[20:42] envy doesn't critique if you don't pay
[20:45] attention
[20:45] switching quite patterns people
[20:57] what the devil was trying to do the
[20:58] second job they said the first try to
[21:00] discourage
[21:12] and their plan was played well by the
[21:15] living god in the point of being
[21:17] shrieked
[21:18] sometimes we travel a different way god
[21:21] saw the need ahead of beijing
[21:25] and you just go you don't even know evo
[21:27] jesus
[21:28] but
[21:59] even those people making a lot of noise
[22:04] when it came time to put the money for
[22:06] the burials
[22:10] it was not you have a production they
[22:12] have to call everywhere
[22:14] you live out too oh you know people
[22:16] already said
[22:18] they shouldn't say we are waiting for
[22:20] the church contribution
[22:22] contribution that exists where the
[22:24] church is going to get the money from us
[22:27] the only place the church will get the
[22:28] money is from the believers
[22:32] but if you believe it don't do it
[22:34] mercifully quiet from the faith
[22:36] you are causing a problem between the
[22:38] pagan and the church
[22:42] because the pagan will say church do
[22:44] pascal
[22:45] agree to the affair but the church also
[22:47] knows may the villages say or something
[22:48] but you did not contribute
[22:51] we are obligated to our own new summer
[22:53] blizzard and not have popcorn

[32:01] psalms chapter 34
[32:05] let's read together in psalms 34.
[32:11] and then psalms 51.
[32:23] and the lord already pre-planned the
[32:26] service
[32:28] program and i didn't know who was going
[32:31] to be here
[32:33] i don't know but the lord jesus
[32:38] knows your personal life individual
[32:41] so i'm not going to preach way up in the
[32:43] clouds somewhere
[32:47] there's things very specific
[32:51] that the lord gave us a message to
[32:52] deliver today
[33:01] [Music]
[33:35] for predestinating us
[33:56] [Music]
[34:02] we can put up a little front and a
[34:04] little facade
[34:05] [Music]
[34:16] but speak very clearly
[34:45] we surrender to you we submit to you
[34:51] may the holy spirit just cover every
[34:54] life
[34:56] in the name of jesus christ
[34:59] amen amen now if we had a weekend of
[35:03] services
[35:05] on weekends two or three services
[35:09] by the end we'd get to know each other
[35:13] but we don't have time for that
[35:23] [Music]
[35:27] psalms 34 17.
[35:32] the righteous cry and the lord heareth
[35:36] amen
[35:37] and delivereth out of all
[35:41] their troubles amen
[35:48] the lord is nigh unto them that are of
[35:53] a broken heart amen and saveth
[35:57] such as be of a contrite spirit
[36:08] the bible says
[36:17] [Music]
[36:19] but the lord delivereth him out of them
[36:24] all
[36:37] he keepeth all his bones
[36:41] to sizzle not one of them
[36:45] is broken
[36:48] i want you to be thinking spiritually
[36:52] but you are the body of christ
[36:56] he keepeth all his bones
[37:00] not one of them is broken
[37:05] have you ever heard of a broken heart
[37:09] how many has heard of a broken heart
[37:13] but when the healer comes
[37:17] he touches the broken heart
[37:20] we're going to speak about spiritual
[37:23] heart conditions today
[37:27] can we can we turn to psalms 51. let's
[37:30] compare
[37:32] verse 15. versace
[37:44] [Music]
[37:47] oh lord open thou my lips
[37:51] and my mouth shall show forth thy praise
[37:59] for thou desirous not sacrifice
[38:03] else would i give it thou delight us
[38:06] not in burned offerings
[38:15] so what is god looking for this morning
[38:19] the sacrifices of god
[38:23] are a broken spirit
[38:26] is this the bible that's what god is
[38:30] looking for from
[38:31] denver colorado colorado
[38:35] a broken spirit breeze a broken
[38:38] and a contrite heart oh god
[38:43] thou wilt not
[38:50] [Music]
[38:58] now if you would go into a hospital
[39:03] and the church is like a hospital
[39:07] you don't find a lot of people jumping
[39:09] around and
[39:11] oh happiness and joy a lot of times
[39:27] so today as we come in the front door
[39:32] we passed the waiting room
[39:37] we are also going past the birthing room
[40:06] it's not just a general md
[40:10] [Music]
[40:12] but we need the holy spirit to touch us
[40:18] in deep places of our lives
[40:22] and that's where
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:18] and it's not just our souls
[41:23] you'll see there is healing for our
[41:25] spirits
[41:28] and also healing for our bodies
[41:31] i believe right in this service today
[41:35] it's about 11 29 a.m
[41:39] that in the next few minutes someone in
[41:42] this meeting
[41:44] can be totally delivered completely
[42:00] oh so don't let your heart become
[42:03] hardened
[42:06] because of the age we're living in a
[42:08] cause
[42:11] is that true many hearts have become
[42:14] hardened
[42:26] but it's coming from a spiritual heart
[42:29] conditions
[42:33] that much of their natural lives
[42:37] is being reflected from a spiritual
[42:40] condition
[42:55] now if you look back in the scripture
[42:57] that we read in psalms
[43:02] chapter 34 verse 18
[43:07] when the bible says the lord is nigh
[43:10] unto them that are
[43:38] careful satan can come in
[43:43] and he can crush a heart
[43:46] he he seeks to destroy alive
[43:50] that god wants to rescue him
[44:05] a heart that has been broken in pieces
[44:10] a heart that is crushed
[44:14] a heart that has been a wreck
[44:20] as i just saw coming to the service this
[44:23] morning
[44:26] i didn't mention it to brother foster
[44:28] her sister anne but
[44:31] just looking over the overpass
[44:34] there was a very
[45:16] but the lord is near to you today
[45:21] you might have had plans you might have
[45:24] had a schedule
[45:27] you might have wanted things to be in a
[45:29] certain way
[45:44] and the holy spirit is here today
[45:47] to say that it's not over
[45:52] i am here to heal you
[45:55] he's close to the brokenhearted
[46:00] and saveth such as be of a contrite
[46:04] spirit only about you
[46:08] that word contrite it means to be
[46:11] brought to the dust
[46:31] have you ever been around someone that
[46:33] has been heavy-hearted
[46:38] maybe this service today is for
[46:45] [Music]
[46:53] because you thought it was all over pete
[46:57] but the heart specialist just walked
[46:59] into the room
[47:04] the angel of the lord is in the service
[47:22] now in psalms chapter 51 verse 17.
[47:28] this is another amazing scripture
[47:32] say what is god desiring
[47:36] what does he want of end-time message
[47:39] tabernacles
[47:42] what is the mind of the lord for us

[48:00] god

[57:10] keep the football
[57:23] there's three things today
[57:38] he said it's been some time ago i was
[57:40] speaking to someone about that
[57:46] he's talking to a scientist and things
[57:48] about
[57:49] how when jesus died
[57:53] he said it was not because of the roman
[57:55] spear that he died
[58:01] neither was it the loss of blood that he
[58:03] died
[58:34] he came to his own and his own received
[58:37] him
[58:40] he died he had a broken heart
[58:45] can you see that let it go
[59:01] and to save time later down into the
[59:03] quote paragraph 31.
[59:06] he's talking about our makeup as
[59:08] believers we're we're not
[59:09] like that

[59:29] can you see that on the screen
[59:41] high five
[59:58] king but he's my king
[1:00:03] amen he's our lamb

[1:03:55] this is when brother john wished we had
[1:03:57] two or three services
[1:04:02] but we've got to just stay with the
[1:04:04] message
[1:04:06] stay with what god said you told you to
[1:04:08] say remember
[1:04:24] there will be times as believers
[1:04:28] that we also face

[1:05:05] and i think we're all finding that
[1:05:17] our hope is in the word of god
[1:05:32] not just in 1963
[1:05:48] is
[1:06:02] seeking
[1:06:14] thank you jesus messages in amen
[1:06:19] now let me just be real honest today
[1:06:23] it's good to be honest if brother
[1:06:26] branham was standing behind this pulpit
[1:06:30] he had a certain
[1:06:58] she went into the restroom and she shut
[1:07:01] the door
[1:07:03] and there was a pain
[1:07:06] there was something she was going
[1:07:07] through
[1:07:10] she didn't even tell you brother but
[1:07:12] sister
[1:07:24] and i'm sure that sister would say
[1:07:26] praise
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:40] and he would just say something to you
[1:07:42] evil director
[1:07:43] maybe publicly republican but it was
[1:07:45] privately
[1:07:46] messed up wouldn't that give you faith

[1:08:04] [Music]

[1:08:24] because william brown and pastor william
[1:08:27] that same gift of god
[1:08:33] do you believe that but i really have a
[1:08:36] question

[1:10:00] you can still receive the same holy
[1:10:03] ghost
