[37:35] prayer we are in a time where we need
[37:37] prayer than ever
[37:39] before dece during the month of
[37:44] December I was coming from

[37:50] home and something told me you have to
[37:55] pray I was uh you know getting something
[37:59] ready to
[38:01] eat and there's a voice inside of me say
[38:03] you need to
[38:06] pray and that voice told me take three
[38:09] days of
[38:11] prayers as I was fixing something to
[38:15] eat and I told
[38:18] myself I'm already cooking something to
[38:21] to bring to uh to work tomorrow
[38:24] morning and I there's a voice inside of
[38:27] me say you need to stop praying
[38:30] tomorrow and I just say you know let me
[38:32] obey to the voice inside of
[38:34] me and I told myself I'm going to go

[38:45] fasting I'm just going to you know just
[38:47] eat just something small at
[38:53] night you know every single time when
[38:55] there's a little voice inside of you
[38:57] that talk to you pay attention to
[39:01] it and I told myself since the voice
[39:04] talked to
[39:05] me I'm really going to pray as old
[39:09] time I remember back a day back in
[39:13] the mom was bringing us to

[39:19] bed and we didn't have any
[39:23] pillow we were just spending nights in

[39:29] Church we've done those things you know
[39:32] for five
[39:34] years and I just told myself I'm going
[39:36] to do it as I was doing
[39:40] before I remember the first
[39:44] day God talked to me about something I
[39:47] asked
[39:48] him and he even gave to me with a
[39:51] sign and the second day of
[39:55] prayer
[39:57] God also answered me on something I ask
[39:59] him and he gave me also another
[40:02] sign and the third
[40:06] day I told myself since God answered
[40:10] me now I can just eat as
[40:14] usual and I know that God already
[40:18] answered and after five days there's no
[40:21] snow
[40:24] there I just little bit like a little
[40:27] bit of
[40:30] snow and I was supposed to go to work
[40:32] early at 5:00
[40:37] a.m. I almost reach uh my
[40:41] workplace like from
[40:45] nowhere and then my car started to you
[40:48] know go you know
[40:50] like back
[40:53] andth and then there's a track that was
[40:55] just next to me
[40:57] and in front of me there's a car that
[40:58] was
[41:00] there and my car was going back and
[41:02] forth and I couldn't control
[41:05] it and I was uh driving 35 miles an
[41:10] hour but the way my car was taking me
[41:15] it's like I was driving above 65
[41:18] jesuses and I started screaming Jesus
[41:24] J and my car just
[41:27] suddenly and I told myself oh Lord
[41:30] what's going
[41:34] on and three days before
[41:40] that there's a guy at work that really
[41:43] uh you
[41:44] know attacked me he was insulting
[41:49] me I was saying Lord what's going on
[41:51] with
[41:55] me and the first January 1 as we had
[41:58] prayer
[42:00] here after the 3rd of
[42:03] January uh you know I got
[42:07] sick three days I was just
[42:10] sleeping I wasn't
[42:15] eating I was forcing myself you know
[42:17] trying to eat
[42:19] something I couldn't eat
[42:23] anything I was only sleeping
[42:29] I asked myself Lord what's going on with
[42:32] me is it a time for me to go or what's
[42:34] going
[42:37] on if there's something you want me to
[42:39] do just tell tell
[42:41] me brother John is
[42:44] here he's there I even share a few
[42:46] things with
[42:50] him and few days the
[42:55] pastor
[42:56] I didn't want to talk to anybody you
[42:58] know outside of people where I
[43:03] live and when the pastor called called
[43:06] me he told him uh he told me that
[43:08] someone told me told him that he was I
[43:10] was
[43:12] sick said yes Pastor I was very sick
[43:15] almost three
[43:17] days but I'm feeling better
[43:21] now I just bought some medication and
[43:23] I'm going to be taking it
[43:27] and the pastors told me that don't take
[43:29] it
[43:30] now if you want to take
[43:32] medication you have to wait at least a
[43:36] night and I already know that God has
[43:38] healed
[43:39] you and then I say
[43:43] amen I went home and I just put the
[43:46] medication on the
[43:47] table I said I'm not going to touch
[43:51] it if I want to go I will
[43:54] go why am I sharing in this with
[44:01] you don't try to look God only when
[44:04] things are not going well for
[44:08] you and don't just wait to pray when
[44:11] things are not going right you have to
[44:13] pray even though you're in good health
[44:16] amen even though good things are going
[44:18] well with you you just have to
[44:22] pray brother said you can do much you
[44:25] can do
[44:27] you can sing a
[44:31] lot you can preach a
[44:33] lot you can read a
[44:37] lot but says something that you will
[44:40] never do enough a lot is
[44:43] prayer you won't be able to pray a
[44:47] lot and to also
[44:51] pray you also need to
[44:54] persevere because if you don't
[44:57] persevere you're going to pray like
[45:00] [Music]
[45:01] pagans they pray and they're just
[45:03] waiting for the right
[45:06] then and our God doesn't do things that
[45:14] way that's why in Luke chapter 11 where
[45:17] we read remember I'm going to talk about
[45:19] the power of
[45:21] prayer just give me your divided
[45:23] attention for a few
[45:24] minutes
[45:29] Luke 115 where we
[45:33] read that was a parable that Jesus
[45:36] talked to his
[45:38] disciple he told them
[45:41] again if someone has a
[45:45] friend and shall go unto him at
[45:48] midnight and say unto him friend L me
[45:50] three
[45:53] laws for a friend of mine in his journey
[45:56] to and I have nothing to set before him
[46:00] vers
[46:01] s the Bible
[46:07] says and he from within shall answer and
[46:10] say trouble me
[46:12] not the door is now
[46:15] shut and my children are with me in
[46:19] bed I cannot rise and give
[46:22] thee but Jesus say I say unto
[46:28] you though he will not rise and give
[46:33] him because he is his
[46:38] friend yet because of his opportunity he
[46:41] will
[46:43] rise and give him as many as
[46:46] needed and I say unto
[46:49] you ask and it shall be given to
[46:53] you seek you shall find
[46:57] look and it shall be open unto
[47:00] you for everyone that ask
[47:03] receive and he that Seth
[47:07] find and to him that knth it shall be
[47:14] open Luke 18 Jesus Christ talk about
[47:17] another
[47:19] Parable saying the same kind of
[47:22] ideas Jesus Christ told them this
[47:25] parable
[47:27] to show them that you always need to
[47:31] pray and you cannot cease to
[47:35] pray remember that guy that went to ask
[47:38] for three loaves of
[47:40] bread he knocked two or three
[47:43] times they didn't open the
[47:46] door he knocked for the third the the
[47:49] third
[47:50] time and they didn't open the
[47:54] door and Jesus say It was in the middle
[47:57] of the
[47:59] night when he came he insisted and
[48:02] knocked on the
[48:03] door and his friend said what are you
[48:05] looking
[48:08] for don't you know I'm already in bed
[48:10] with my
[48:12] children he say I have a friend that
[48:14] came from
[48:17] uh can you can you can you give me three
[48:19] loaves of
[48:22] bread he say it's impossible this is
[48:25] midnight
[48:28] maybe can say you don't have respect why
[48:31] can't you come that L I'm already here
[48:33] with my wife and
[48:35] children and that friend was still
[48:38] importuna him and
[48:41] insisting and 18 Luke
[48:45] 182 Jesus
[48:50] saying there was in the city a judge
[48:53] which fear not
[48:54] God neither regarded
[48:58] [Music]
[49:00] man and there was a widow in that City
[49:03] she came him saying avenge me of my
[49:09] adversary and Jesus said that for many
[49:12] many years he
[49:15] refused and he talked to
[49:18] himself even though I fear not
[49:22] God no regard any
[49:24] man
[49:27] yet because this Widow troubled
[49:30] me listen very carefully Jesus
[49:34] said this Widow was coming every single
[49:41] day and she was traveling the
[49:45] judge and Jesus
[49:48] said the judge said to
[49:52] himself although I fear not God no
[49:56] regard
[49:57] man
[50:00] yet because this Widow trouble me I will
[50:05] avenge
[50:08] her unless by a continual coming she
[50:12] worried
[50:13] me and the Lord
[50:15] said he what the unjust judge
[50:21] said and shall not God avenge his own
[50:24] elect which C day and night
[50:28] him that means that it's not something
[50:30] that you just do for one for a few
[50:32] days and it's something that you
[50:34] continuously do you come in the morning
[50:38] you come in the
[50:40] evening you pray for the same
[50:43] thing in other words Jesus
[50:49] Christ it's not something that will be
[50:51] given to you at the same time you
[50:53] ask he also uh requires PA or
[51:01] perseverance and shall not guard avenge
[51:03] his own
[51:05] elect which cry day and night unto
[51:10] him though he bear long with them I tell
[51:15] you that he will avenge them
[51:18] speedily
[51:21] nevertheless when the son of man
[51:24] cometh shall he faith on the
[51:27] [Music]
[51:28] earth just to say that prayer works with
[51:32] faith if you don't have
[51:36] faith you won't be able to receive the
[51:38] thing that you're asking
[51:41] for Luke Chapter 20 uh
[51:45] 22 verse
[51:49] 31st listen to something good that Jesus
[51:53] Christ is saying
[51:54] here
[51:58] Luke
[51:59] [Music]
[52:01] 22 verse
[52:08] 31st and the Lord
[52:12] said Simon Simon behold Satan has
[52:15] desired to have
[52:16] you that he may sift
[52:20] you but I prayed for
[52:24] the thy faith fail
[52:27] not and when thou are
[52:30] converted strengthen thy bre
[52:34] amen just to
[52:37] say even though you believe to this
[52:43] message even though you live in the
[52:45] pastor's
[52:47] house even though you were daughter or
[52:50] son of a servant of
[52:52] God you're not uh uh
[52:58] you're not under the protection of the
[53:01] devil you always come after
[53:04] you he's trying to uh to do
[53:09] something but the only thing you can do
[53:11] is to go to
[53:14] prayer that's what Jesus told
[53:16] Peter I pray I pray for
[53:19] [Music]
[53:22] you amen
[53:27] verse
[53:30] 33 and he said unto
[53:34] him Lord I am ready to go with
[53:38] thee both into prison and to
[53:41] death and he said I tell the
[53:45] Peter the shall not cwl this
[53:49] [Music]
[53:50] day before that thou sh twice deny that
[53:55] th me verse
[53:57] 35 and he said unto
[54:01] them when I sent you without purse and
[54:05] SCP and
[54:09] shoes like
[54:12] anything and they said
[54:15] nothing Jesus was talking to his
[54:17] disciple and he told
[54:20] them
[54:24] now
[54:25] he that has a purse let him take
[54:28] it and likewise his
[54:31] strip and he that has
[54:35] no and he that has no
[54:39] sword let him sell His Garment and buy
[54:43] one I just want you to pay attention
[54:46] here can you listen very
[54:50] carefully while they were with Jesus
[54:54] Christ
[54:56] Jesus Christ never asked them for
[55:00] anything while Jesus was going toward
[55:02] the end of his
[55:05] journey he said I never ask you to bring
[55:10] something but now is the time to G
[55:15] up if someone doesn't have K
[55:19] sword let it even sell
[55:22] his so that he can buy a
[55:26] sword listen
[55:28] carefully now I say to
[55:32] you that this that is written must you
[55:35] be accomplished in
[55:38] me and it was reckon among the
[55:41] [Music]
[55:43] transgressors for the thing concerning
[55:45] me have an end and they
[55:49] say Lo behold here are two
[55:52] swords and he said unto them
[55:55] it is
[56:00] enough they presented two sword to Jesus
[56:04] chist and Jesus Christ answered them
[56:07] said it is
[56:10] enough and brother said the sword
[56:12] represent the word of
[56:15] God and here when they presented two
[56:19] swords and Jesus Christ told them that
[56:22] that that was enough in other words
[56:28] and some people said that reading the
[56:30] the the U the quotes
[56:32] [Music]
[56:33] or reading the quotes I think it's
[56:36] really uh I'm very tired of
[56:39] it when I read the Bible I feel
[56:43] good but that doesn't have to work that
[56:47] way we need both the Bible and we also
[56:51] need the Cod from the
[56:52] prophet but if you don't have those
[56:56] and you only have the Bible
[57:00] with you won't be able to understand
[57:02] what Jesus Christ was talking
[57:04] about because Jesus Christ was talking
[57:06] in
[57:08] Parable even the disciple couldn't
[57:10] understand
[57:12] him some people say
[57:15] no I don't like to pray a
[57:19] lot I just like to pray for five
[57:23] minutes I don't want to multip many
[57:25] words but also
[57:29] say if you also see a Christian that
[57:31] praying enough that means that it
[57:34] doesn't read
[57:35] enough because if you read
[57:38] enough you'll be able to say things to
[57:43] PR you don't have to pray like
[57:48] Pharisees didn't say
[57:51] that say in the mark of the
[57:53] beast
[57:55] paragraph
[57:57] 138 he
[57:59] said Jesus Christ was talking to his
[58:02] disciples don't be like
[58:06] pagans they always multiply words in the
[58:09] prayers now brother
[58:13] says how do they do when they
[58:19] pray they come with little words that
[58:21] were taught to them
[58:23] in
[58:25] and brother
[58:26] says I I salute you
[58:30] maryy you you listen to those
[58:33] prayers he said full of
[58:36] grace and blessed are
[58:39] thou he said that's not
[58:42] prayer
[58:46] says he
[58:49] said don't be like
[58:53] hiddens using V
[58:57] repetition he say I H
[59:00] Mary say how Father in
[59:03] Heaven that's not
[59:05] prayer said he
[59:08] said
[59:11] and I am a member of a
[59:13] church I'm going to a certain
[59:16] Church they taught me how to
[59:18] pray since I was a child in the
[59:23] Catholic
[59:27] but you find the Christian that cannot
[59:28] spend one hour in
[59:33] prayer listen to what the prophet
[59:36] says I am a
[59:38] Protestant yes
[59:41] sir I am member of this church yes
[59:45] sir and on
[59:49] Sunday it's only if you respect
[59:52] it uh if you respect to go in
[59:55] when it's raining outside he say
[59:59] yeah instead of going to prayer
[1:00:02] meetings you closing the
[1:00:05] church and you're sitting in your home
[1:00:07] watching
[1:00:08] TV and they go and they
[1:00:12] drink and they do many kind of
[1:00:15] things and they're behaving like other
[1:00:17] people in the world while they are
[1:00:19] members of church
[1:00:22] remember that's the mark of
[1:00:29] sin a Christian that only comes to
[1:00:31] church Su when when it's
[1:00:36] when they say let me just stay at
[1:00:39] home let me just listen to those at home
[1:00:43] let me just do this at home what
[1:00:46] says that's the mark of
[1:00:51] sin say if I am a Christian
[1:00:55] I go to a
[1:00:57] city and I find that they don't have
[1:01:01] a
[1:01:03] says I will go somewhere where to preach
[1:01:06] the word of God I will listen to the
[1:01:08] word of
[1:01:09] God I will say Amen to what I can
[1:01:14] say say that a Christian cannot be
[1:01:17] home I really uh in my life when I when
[1:01:23] I I
[1:01:25] even though I'm sick I always go to
[1:01:28] church if I'm not at
[1:01:30] church I probably somewhere
[1:01:33] traveling you can ask
[1:01:36] the when I'm very sick I ask to stay in
[1:01:39] the
[1:01:41] back I don't have any interest to stay
[1:01:43] at
[1:01:45] home but the Bible said those who are
[1:01:49] coming they have to believe that God
[1:01:53] is reward for those who are seeking
[1:01:58] him it's just because the Christian
[1:02:00] don't understand who is their God let me
[1:02:04] go here a little bit here
[1:02:07] further and Jesus asked them to find
[1:02:12] two and in other words God told them to
[1:02:15] love the
[1:02:18] word but said the word of God we we have
[1:02:21] Victory against the devil everywhere any
[1:02:25] circum in any other
[1:02:27] circumstances the word of God will have
[1:02:29] victory over the
[1:02:31] devil the Bible
[1:02:33] says after they
[1:02:36] went and he came out and went as he
[1:02:40] was to the Mount of
[1:02:45] Olives even Jesus Christ was spending
[1:02:47] more time in the mountain to
[1:02:51] pray he said to the Mount of Olives
[1:02:55] and his disciple also followed
[1:02:58] him
[1:03:01] yes verse
[1:03:04] 40 and when he was at that place he said
[1:03:08] unto them
[1:03:12] pray that you enter not into
[1:03:16] temptation Jesus asking his disciple to
[1:03:20] pray how about you and
[1:03:23] me
[1:03:24] he said
[1:03:26] pray that you enter not into temptation
[1:03:33] amen and he was withdraw from
[1:03:36] them about a
[1:03:39] stonecast and kneel
[1:03:41] down and
[1:03:43] prayed saying
[1:03:47] father if thou be willing remove this
[1:03:50] cup from
[1:03:52] me nevertheless not my will by be
[1:03:58] done and there appeared an angel unto
[1:04:00] him from Heaven to strengthen
[1:04:03] him and being in agony he
[1:04:07] prayed more
[1:04:11] earnestly and his sweat was as he were
[1:04:14] great drops of
[1:04:16] blood falling down to the
[1:04:19] ground and when he
[1:04:22] prayed and when he rose up from prayer
[1:04:24] and came to his
[1:04:26] disciples he found them sleeping from
[1:04:29] sorrow listen
[1:04:31] 46 and said unto
[1:04:34] them why sleep
[1:04:36] ye rise and
[1:04:40] pray L you enter into
[1:04:44] temptation and while he
[1:04:46] SP behold the
[1:04:49] multitude and he that was called
[1:04:52] Judas one of the 12 went before them
[1:04:55] and Drew near Jesus to kiss

[1:05:06] the
[1:05:10] Bible even in Matthew Jesus Christ when

[1:05:22] mountain and Jesus Christ
