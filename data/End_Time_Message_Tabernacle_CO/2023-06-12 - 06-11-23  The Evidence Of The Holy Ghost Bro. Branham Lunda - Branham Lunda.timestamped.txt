[1:20:48] I have survey Israel uh
[1:20:53] you know Israel when the we're walking
[1:20:56] to the promised land
[1:20:58] is
[1:21:00] they were hungry a certain time
[1:21:05] a God gave them manner

[1:21:20] make food
[1:21:21] out of it man
[1:21:24] Israel is a family as the familiarism
[1:21:28] but after a while Israel got used to the
[1:21:31] Mana

[1:22:51] placed in the center of the new spirit
[1:22:54] amen amen
[1:22:57] if we want to recap a little bit
[1:23:08] there are two different things
[1:23:13] that takes the Holy Spirit
[1:23:17] and put it in the new hearts
[1:23:21] in the center of the new spirit amen
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:27] and we saw that that new spirit
[1:23:34] is the spirit that convinced you that
[1:23:36] the word of God is the truth the tennis
[1:23:42] it's a spirit that makes you realize
[1:23:44] that this is wrong this is good
[1:23:49] it makes you realize or make the
[1:23:52] decision that you should be baptized
[1:23:57] you can start even to wanting to leave
[1:24:00] the word
[1:24:03] the Venom was worried they said
[1:24:08] and the meaning of Billy Graham amen
[1:24:13] even in his own meetings

[1:25:00] foreign
[1:25:12] they don't have faith to stand all the
[1:25:15] way to the end is
[1:25:31] that makes them to impersonate
[1:25:33] Christianity
[1:25:35] he was just emotions
[1:25:41] the word is spoken therefore God
[1:25:44] convinced you you accepted cases you
[1:25:48] accept Christ upon the basis of the word
[1:25:50] if God decides some scientists it takes
[1:25:54] his holy spirit
[1:25:58] he places it in the center of your new
[1:26:01] spirits
[1:26:03] that person one will be unshakable
[1:26:06] if they won't be any emotions
[1:26:11] that is why you can see somebody being

[2:49:44] spirit amen amen
[2:49:46] you can jump

[2:50:07] because you can have the Holy Spirit
[2:50:11] and draw the anointing from the
[2:50:14] preachers
[2:50:15] it concerns me but
[2:50:20] there has been left out
[2:50:24] we must find one place that Jesus says
[2:50:31] happiness of the Holy Ghost
[2:50:35] is the fruit of your spirit
[2:50:38] Jesus said so
[2:50:40] [Music]
