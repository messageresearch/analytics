bless you you may be seated as I greet you all this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen and we are all happy we are all we are all happy to be in the house of the Lord and uh this is where the blessings are falling upon the people amen amen thank you musicians uh song leader the worship was fantabulous you remember that word [Applause] amen when we put a new word we have to use it it's very very important when you come to church to praise God uh let's take first Samuel as you are sitting first Samuel 16 verse 23 listen to what the Bible say and it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took a hop and play with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him am Soul was refreshed and was well so when you come with heaviness and many things maybe sicknesses worries and you cannot really get into the spirit of worship just tell David tell David take the har play some courses and the bad evil spirit are going to leave in the message the mighty conquer preach April 1st 1956 in the morning April 1st 1956 in the morning paragraph 36 the mighty conquer do you believe the prophet Propet he is uh the mouth of God the only one authorized for this age to interpret the Bible and he is interpreting the scripture we read no no did I write it wrong paragraph 366 no it was another scripture 56 April 1st in the morning but that's the quot brother was explaining 1 Samuel 16 oh it's rather I'm sorry this great warrior David this great warrior David David January 18 1955 rather January 18 1955 paragraph 20 is interpreting that scripture and the Bible the message say pay close attention shame on you people don't believe in string music that's the interpretation when you come to church you feel [Music] heavy instead of worshiping the king you feel like uh no if I do it somebody's going to see it's not for me I'm a very important man let me tell you about the David David was a king a King when he came in the presence of the Lord he forgot he wear suit he forgot he has a body guard he just take the guitar or the har he was playing with all his mind all his being his mind was in the worship of the Lord to the extent the evil spirit could not stand that's why brother sister whoever you are when you come time to worship even young people stand up don't you think if I stand my next next candidate candid he's not that guy no forget those things get in the spirit evil spirit are going to depart from you said according to what the Bible said shame on you people don't believe in string music no wonder evil spirits never like it they have to get away David cast out Devil by playing on his string instrument that's what the scripture says that's right and when David will begin to play the evil spirit leave soul is that right let me ask you the question is that right is that right my favorite PE here the first one where is ne ne you should sit there Anna sit there oh keep that for Anna amen amen so I have a good favor team of singers those teenagers our eyes are upon them they are the generation of Tomorrow future spouses of preachers who want to be the wife of a Preacher show me don't

word long prer for our in this world every sound with God's on heart oh let the word of God oh word of God word of God if true changing me and changing you oh we have come with open heart oh let the word of God God bless you all this morning we are standing let's take our Bible First King chapter 3:8 first king chapter 17 verse 8 thank you Lord Jesus [Music] J Alo [Music] for for for and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Zara which which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zerath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he cth he call it to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in the vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and and said bring me I pray thee a muscle of bread in in thy hands and she said as the Lord thy God leaveth I have not a cake by a handful of meal in the in the barrel and the little oil in the cruise and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it to unto me and after make after make for thee and for thy son for thus said the Lord of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of all fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did accordingly according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the bear of meal wasted not not neither did the cruise of all fail according to the word of the Lord which spake by Elijah we going to say a prayer L almighty God we approaching before you this morning this is a very special place in humility father we counting on you your Prophet is telling us that the angel is here I believe it with all my heart that is why we need to be respectful take me out of the way so that you can act the way you want oh God sanctify me Lord so that I can sanctify others oh Heavenly Father take control over the atmosphere take control over our thoughts take away on our belief take away our weaknesses we laying all our burdens at your feet bless the pastor of this church bless the all congregation this morning bless them abundantly it give it give us good pleasure to see your children happy bless the congregation please bless the word Lord I know heels I know my mouth let the six Saints take the first place in the name of the Lord Jesus our savior beloved savior amen amen may God bless his word you may be seated glory to Jesus glory to Jesus thank you again the pastor for the privilege to allow me to share this this morning again we simply want to be a blessing for one another we are living in a very special time a very extraordinary time and I think one of the preaching that we hear in this message is the getting ready of this little bride and I believe we have reach a time where we have to speed up uh based on our preparation the day of marriage is waiting is coming do you agree with that this morning we can uh notice around us that the prophecy is being fulfilled we can see the falling down of the world everything is ready everything is ready at this very time God is waiting from us God is expecting is waiting for us it's now the time to go back it's not the time as a Lord's wife to ask more time it's death that's why that's how was the plane don't look back when you are living s that's how there was the instructions very severe and we want to emphasize on that have your eyes fixed on Jesus Jus everything that the word is telling us is the type to prepare us today don't look back it seems to be uh little we say we made a decision to leave Sodom Andor but we're not going back but just allow my eyes to see but why God asked them not to turn around because he know exactly what's going to happen that's how was the instructions and this morning we are going to title our word our preaching make me first amen amen make mine first the all the instructions God is asking us it's very precise very precise amen amen we are learning every day when we are young we always hear Elders telling us they telling us to be careful be careful over there but when we young we wondering why it's like a father asking to the children don't run quickly on the road and the children will say you don't understand how to drive that is why that's why you're saying that that is why I appreciate people of God before getting out of the car the house before taking the call we ask for protection amen amen hallelujah hallelujah this is the very wonderful place this morning David said I'm enjy when they said let's go to the house of the Lord the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want hallelujah amen he lay me down in a green pasture lay me down in a green pasture Allelujah Hallelujah that makes me think about prodal son he didn't know who he was he thought that when he was leaving his father's house in the world was better Hallelujah extraordinary privilege that is why our Prophet is telling us we are living under our Privileges and when we know our privileges we are the happiest people on the Earth David says blessed be a man that is not walking according to the ways of the the wicked this morning I'm challenging you I'm believing with all of my heart that a child of God he's the happiest person on the earth and the word is telling us that and we are not the tail but we are the head everything he does prosp everything he does pros it's not the case for the evil ones everything he does prosper when we're living in the program of God when we fulfilling everything that the word we will succeed all the time I'm challenging we have to prosper if God give us the goad amen amen that's why we have to seek the will of God you don't get into things quickly that's why we're going to hear this morning you always have to seek the face of God always seek the the face of God we have an extraordinary privilege we have to recognize that that is why when their eyes opened amen they recognized them if this morning our eyes are open we will see in this Church angels are here the angel is here this morning the word is saying where two or three my name I will be there the angel is here that is why we need to respect when we are looking at the Tabernacle only the high priest had to go in the Hol of look at the type how the preparation was very specific this man had to prepare himself before getting in he wasn't whatsoever it was a special preparation you had to cut ties with the world you have to have a spiritual life it's the type of the Bride when he gets inside it was between death and life if there's no preparation it's death and the high priest has on his feet a cord imagine this morning when we claim to be a Christian we don't realize sometimes well the importance the responsibility that I a Christian to be the name of Jesus we have to clear our mind we have to clean our heart we have to disconnect from everything else it's between life and death amen amen that's why brother per he said when I walk with the prophet where I have to control my thoughts because the man of God knows everything I'm thinking of this morning is not different from us God knows our thought this morning God knows the way we came this morning he knows if you are well prepared this morning it's very serious it's very serious hallelujah hallelujah we have to come into the presence of God fear we fear people of God this is between life and death it's not a game it's not just to Bear the name of chrisan this is very serious even when we are far away and we are not known where we are but God is present when I think about job when God looked job on the earth he was proud proud to look at job this morning can we give God the possibility to say Lord I want you to be proud of me I want you to be proud to look at me I want you to say the same thing you said about Job amen the importance to Bear the name of the little bride that is why you have to be careful when we look at we look at our brothers and sisters the Bible is telling us it's better to have a cord your neck to be thrown on the bottom of the sea than hurting a child of God amen amen do we realize this morning the seriousness do we have the fear in our hearts that this morning then everything that we do it's under control that is why we need the fear of God go ask for forgiveness it's nothing compared to our position we have in the name that we bear we shouldn't be a scar scar to fix little things we shouldn't be afraid of it we we are ambassadors of Christ fix little things there we should be proud to ask for forgiveness I want my life to be in order with the word I want my life to be in order for the price God has paid for me for the type that I'm bearing I have to fix everything this morning we're going to take the prophecy is the word of God for our time and we want to take it seriously make mine first morning God is asking us to put him first in our hearts question and answer on the seal paragraph 74 hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord now look at here look how perfect it is everywhere you go listen this morning God is speaking to each and every one of us it's for now it's always in present time sir it's perfect everywhere we go if I could stand here and talk to the things that are revealed in this room and I tell you it swing your head around it's very strong the church why the prophet the eye of an e can see we don't realize the atmosphere in this room the angels are here watching over the children of God there's something that blessed me when the prophet asked God to allow his son to see the angel this is a strong Dimension it's strong the church he said Lord allow my son to see him and bil is giving describing the angel he was there and when Paul is saying that way he said I could see the eyes of Angel upon the man of God oh what a privilege body it was like a bodyguard the angel of God Is Watching Over the man of God is more than the body God that we have is watching over nobody can touch nobody can touch that's another dimension that's another dimension we realize what we are this morning the understand one day one day hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I tell you you swing your head but how are you going how you going to do it when you got a whole thing here and then you I don't know why but when you get away there it begins to open up Myst when you get away from people there it begin to open of mysteries then you see things that you are not thereare to to tell the people the Church of the Living God if this morning we have our eyes open Lord Open the Eyes of My servants Hallelujah the servant of Elijah he was scared he was scared worries were surrounding him he could only see the negative all of a sudden by the prayer of the prophets Lord Open the Eyes of My servants and from that time once more Lord that's when he understood what was in him was greater than that was in the world what is inside of us it's stronger that is in the little be still pleased the father to give us the kingdom of God [Applause] hallelujah of the hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah and there you see things that you can't even tell people people will take us as crazy if we can tell them what we see this morning if we can tell them what we feel this morning people say he lost his mind do you realize this morning why the prophet is telling us who we are where we are in a Celestial place in a Heavenly Place hallelujah hallelujah and then when you they start they start a little they take the uh enticing Spirit paragraph 45 now all things had to be considered prayerfully first seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added I'm positive sure this if men and women could only get into that position where the soul they thinking their attitude be perfect in the sight of God look at my servant job that will be one of the most powerful churches that ever exist that will be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed let's continue paragraph 52 tell me a preacher show me a Christian give me a wife give me a farmer or the factory worker that will put God first in everything that will God put God first in everything I will show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him hallelujah amen [Applause] hallelujah I will show you then a man that will be Su inite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first we must first seek God we must have first hallelujah [Music] amen more Evar by prophecy paragraph 60 be patient with me we're going to read is the he's still believing the doctor condemned but he's still believing amen amen everything seems to be negative but he's still believing he's still positive he's still smiling Steven uh after all the stones that was coming on him I love talking about it when the anointing of God is upon somebody look what is happening I believe if the stones are being launched on us as we're still living in in five senses it will be hard to pray it will be hard to think positive for the five senses we will try to to prevent it froming us we try to survive but when the six sense happen look at the difference Steven his eyes on the his face was shining amen ordinary man cannot do it an ordinary man cannot do it hallelujah hallelujah we left home with maybe problems we probably left home with people will say he's still happy we sing a song that says on Sunday I'm happy on Monday I'm full of joy on Tuesday I have peace that the world doesn't know on Wednesday Thursday I live in the light on Friday and Saturday it's heaven on Earth yes we walk joyfully even in trouble we still injy hallelujah hallelujah amen amen they seal the testimony with the blood even seal the testimony with blood the living testimony even to have your

walking yes again it's less than that just have faith in his word and if you make his word your absolute any Divine promise in the Bible you can tie your soul to it no matter how much the waves with you still TI to your absolute 55 amen Pro God's promises are always uncondition they are always condition sometime we have to jump over conditions there are conditions you must first accept the conditions that's mistakes when we we have our eyes closed and the word is asking us to do something with things difficult but when the woman believe the word listen to the word she had the revelation of the word she knew that there will be a change of dispensation she knew that the food will not lack in the natural they said it will not be enough amen amen hallelujah hallelujah you have to no matter how fundamental you are with the promise it's under condition if we can just stop here and turn this scripture hours and see that the condition is what means something you can just be as as fundamental as you want to but it's under condition by the promise predestination Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness what orble things it will be to meet the Civilized world man of 75 years old with a woman 65 and had lived together since they were young couples oh she was his half sister and now going to have a baby by her but he had an absolute there was nothing going to move him when the first month he didn't happen is absolute held that's the key there's no [Music] time God is never late the absolute is always present the absolute always stands is absolute held because he know that he had talked to God the second month the second year year 10 years 25 years later when he was 100 and Sarah was 90 his absolute still he amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the typ continues the church we know what happened in the life of the prophets when he pronounced for Joseph the coming of the little Joseph God allow the girl to come first and people said people watching over the prophecy he say there got to be a problem there got to be a problem you said this but no the way God works is different from the thinking of a man people were started talking about Joseph but the word of God stands the same Joseph had to come Joseph had to come this morning if God said you're going to be healed the healing was already pronounced for God for us we have time but for God there's no time God there's no time church when God pronounce something for us if it's the will of God the word stays the word that is why we come in the presence of godu Hallelujah you have to always look to the word the word says it where two or three I got in my name that has to come down and the first to jump in the pool has to be healed the first to catch the first person to couch the reation we have the blessings the blessing was already given the prophet said the check was already signed you got to just put your number that's the only effort we got to do to keep the absolute absolute States just put your number on the check how long is it going to take just put the number just put the number you want we came with needs just put the number God God has to do it he respect his word hallelujah hallelujah oh on Monday on Sunday I'm happy on Sunday I'm happy there's no meeting less than the other there's no meeting less than the other there's no meeting oh we don't have blessing there always a blessing that depends on our attitude if time we come to church there's not a lot of people there's nobody to play music there's no one to leave songs the pastor not there they not there there's no problem our absolute stands I will worship His name start singing I start worshiping I start dancing because God is pres is my absolute R for Hallelujah my redeemer live eternally My Redeemer liveth forever hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when he didn't come the first month is Absolut held that is why it's important the church to be United there's sometime I'm strong I have to have the weak ones it's turning it's a everybody has his turn come on come on we're going to move forward I'm praying for you brother I'm with you brother come let's go to the church oh God has something for us encourage one another encourage one another because we are living in a very difficult time the best thing is to encourage one another don't take advantage when we see a brother falling we don't take advantage of it it's not a pleasure for us when we see somebody discouraged somebody doesn't come to church we pray for him let's go to him let us be a blessing oh sanctify me so I can sanctify others me Lord so I can be a blessing for others when we see the devil coming before us saying you cannot do it the devil can tell you forgive that person now this is very extreme what he did but when we look at the absolute when the six sense takes his place Chang the ma of this world he Chang what the man said is impossible he can touch it by he can say I love you with all my hearts amen amen if a man drunk with wine his problem he forgot if he's poor he forgot if he doesn't have anything he even forgot his friends he started doing things he's not used to do if he's a man he started hugging another man he started kissing another man things is not used to do it becomes easy for him why because he's under the influence of wine how much more today when we under the influence of the Holy Spirit fill with the Holy Spirit we can dance even if we are Tim David was alone he started dancing but David you're alone your there's no musician around there's no choir nobody in the church you're all alone why can you do it it was not on the earth he was in the heaven places people his eyes could not see the flowers he could not see the house no more he could not see people around him he was with angels he started dancing he started dancing his wife looked at him he said my husband he lost his mind he snapped what's going on with him that's extraordinary example when we got in the spirit let's get into the spirit hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible says when his biog biography was written after his death Abraham doubted not St not at the promise of God but he was given strength how giving praise God stay quiet this message the room has to be filled with hallelujah it's a Fountain of Living Water the love of God is infinite it's a great Fountain of Love don't sing song lightly get into the spirits the atmosphere God is Among Us God is God is coming in the human flesh he can be next to to us this morning we can see a man we can see a woman we can see a sister we can see a brother we see a little kids singing here God is in the human flesh they sing before us they worship before we have to appreciate that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah have you ever ask why he was positive positive the only thing he could do what was it there was a condition to separate himself from his people amen amen we have to separate oursel from things that we love that is not under the condition of Goden we have we have to separate oursel from our hobby we have our Hobbies that please these five senses that if we ask ourself questions what are we gaining out of it we give so much importance to it we giving more time to it we have to ask ourselves questions why are we getting out of it we invest time in those things we don't even gain anything back bu a businessman he do business I feel like he don't get anything out of it even if I love that stop doing it stop doing that kind of business focus on things that you can get anything out of it that's a priority amen you have to have both you have to have both together but the essential thing you have to have profits when we go to the accountant he's always looking for profit it will tell you you're spending a lot you are spending a lot you have some of the expenses unuse useful spending you're spending a lot even my mother's at home I'm at home we always try to move forward to cut off some use unuseful the only way to go up the only way to move forward is cut off some of the spend amen amen going to the restaurants there's nothing bad about it but the mother starts saying you know you have to cut off some of this SP we going to cook at home amen amen because we move we have to move forward a little bit we have planes we have to make the house bigger we we have a baby coming Focus to make profit and this morning what we reading here if you're believing the promise of God if we believe with all our hearts in the promise of God just write the numbers on the check just put your number on the check and we seek the first the face of God if it's the will of God God will do it God has to do it hallelujah hallelujah I believe with all my heart I'm not seeing it so lightly I believe in it all my heart sometimes God give us exceeding above everything that we ask when we respect conditions sometime God give us things that we didn't even ask amen amen it's our father he loves us it's not because he correct us doesn't mean he doesn't love us as a father that loves the kids when he sees him driving faster on the road he will try to get back his motorcycle and the day you will start listening to me and the day you will start driving respecting the speed limit I'll give you back your motorcycle amen amenu the word of God is so wonderful if you understand the type that is hidden the whole blessing is hidden in the type God doesn't change his way of doing if you already done in the past he can do it again today still the same yesterday today and forever God blessed in the [Music] past don't say that was David no no we can be as David he was in the human flesh as us if he could was able to stand before Goliath he trusted his God it was as little came before everybody while everybody was criticizing while every everywhere around him was negative even Saul was there even his brothers his brothers his family is close people they said things that we didn't have to say it to discourage him you little D you have so silly you always have to be silly we've been here for a long time we've been here for a long time we know how to fight and you telling us how to do but God is and reveal himself in simplicity came little things that you don't even use in a battle and he's using the name of the Lord what a trust he had in his God what a trust he had in the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah do you love him this morning he can give us again Abraham struggle not [Music] Hallelujah God never blessed him before he had done it the condition was to separate himself from his people God never did bless him until he did it he took his daddy his daddy died he took lot when after Lord separated from abrah then God came to him and said now walk through the land obedience promise under condition always goes with God and His word sometimes we expect many but we don't see things to to come to pass you have to come back and to see again conditions when somebody goes to the bank he doesn't content to get a loan he ask for loan and the bank approved it but the mistake that we do we don't read the condition the rules condition we don't argue to have a good interest rate andtime then we wonder why we keep paying it doesn't stop because you're paying a lot of interest you're paying a lot of interest you have to read the condition first don't be excited to get a loan I I got a loan but read the condition after reading the rules and the conditions then you can sign when you rent a house to somebody it's very important there's a contract you have to go read it and the law lays in the words sometime you have to go see a lawyer because you don't have much knowledge and then you ask the lawyer to check double check every lines and it will double check every lines if that's okay and then you can move forward you don't Rejoice because you have a customer condition can make our life difficult tomorrow and when your Cent doesn't pay you're not happy but in the condition there was nothing to repossess what gave and he has it he doesn't pay this morning and we have before us a prophet of God he's telling us everything to do it's important to come in the presence of God and to listen carefully not to be distracted and not to have our ears everywhere to be focused we have an objective this
