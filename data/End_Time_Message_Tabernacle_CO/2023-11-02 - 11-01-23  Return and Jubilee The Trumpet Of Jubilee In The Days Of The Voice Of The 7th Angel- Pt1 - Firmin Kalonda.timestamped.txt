[2:14:23] precious heavenly
[2:14:25] father with Thanksgiving from the bottom
[2:14:28] of our

[2:14:39] message with the illustration of the
[2:14:42] mother
[2:14:44] ego this is our experience
[2:14:49] we were scattered in the
[2:14:52] world in a lot of
[2:14:56] distractions but when we heard this
[2:15:02] message a clear
[2:15:05] sound calling
[2:15:07] us to leave
[2:15:10] Egypt to leave the
[2:15:13] world and father we have
[2:15:16] responded but as it was with
[2:15:20] Abraham when you called him he
[2:15:24] responded but when he started the
[2:15:27] journey there were still some other
[2:15:31] stuff attached to
[2:15:33] him and he needed additional
[2:15:39] separation until he had a complete
[2:15:42] surrendered unto
[2:15:45] you then you manifested yourself to him
[2:15:48] in a human
[2:15:52] flesh father I pray
[2:15:55] tonight based on the word that was
[2:15:58] preached let the same
