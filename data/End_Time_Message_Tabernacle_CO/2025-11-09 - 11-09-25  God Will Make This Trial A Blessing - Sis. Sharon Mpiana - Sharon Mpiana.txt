========================================

[music] I've just [singing] come into a valley, [music] one like I've Never been before. [singing] I keep [music] searching for a way [singing] out. Seems like padlocks [music] are on the door. [singing] Oh, there must be another [music] [singing] sunrise, another sunset that I [music] see. God will make [singing] this trial a blessing. That's the [singing and music] love he has for me. God [singing] will make this trial a blessing. Though it [singing] sends me to my knees, though my [singing] tears flow like a river, [music] yet in him there is [singing] sweet relief. There's no [music] need to get discouraged. [singing] There's no need to talk defeat. God [music] will make this trial [singing] a blessing. And the whole wide world will [singing] see. I was not the first one [singing] to come into this place. You [singing] see, every son of God, this [singing] test [music] he must face, it is here that [music] God will mold you and make you what [singing] he wants you to be. God will make this trial a blessing. [music] Just be patient [singing] and you'll see. God will make this trial a blessing. [singing and music] Though he sends me to my knees, though my tears [music] flow [singing] like a river, yet in him there is sweet [singing and music] relief. There's no need to get discouraged. There's no [singing] need to talk defeat. [music] God will make this trial a [singing] blessing and the whole wide world will see. Now [singing] standing on the mountain, looking [music and singing] back, I can see when I was in that lowest valley, [music] his [singing] strong hand was leading me. It [music] was [singing] good to see the sunshine and to [singing] taste sweet victory. God has made my trial a blessing. [music] Oh, the [singing] grace he gives to me. God has made my trial a blessing. Though he [singing] sent me to my knees, though my tears [singing and music] flow like a river, yet in him there [music] we relieve. There's no [singing] need to get discouraged. There's no [singing] need to talk defeat. God has made my trial a blessing and the whole [music and singing] wide world will see. God has made your [singing and music] trial a blessing and the whole [singing] wide world will see. [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it one more time together. God will make this trial a blessing. [music and singing] Lord, he sends me to my knees. Though my tears [singing and music] flow like a river, yet in him the sweet relief, [singing] there's no need [music] to get discouraged. There's no need [singing and music] to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing [music] and the whole wide world will see. You believe that? Amen.
