Praise God. the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thanking you for coming tonight. &gt;&gt; You may sit please for a minute. &gt;&gt; May God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; I know tonight [Music] It was again a sacrifice for you to come in the house of the God of God. But &gt;&gt; I believe we will have a reward. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. We can feel tired. &gt;&gt; But I believe one of these days &gt;&gt; Paul said &gt;&gt; the suffering of present time be compared to the glory to come. &gt;&gt; And this message is a great message. Take you courage &gt;&gt; and one of the days you will be rewarded &gt;&gt; being tired, hardship, problems. &gt;&gt; Then one day we'll be rewarded. [Music] I was thinking of uh preaching and pray for them that are still feeling sick and I felt like the Lord didn't want me to do it. Maybe he would give it to somebody else one day. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, the pastor's here for all these things because the prophet says the pastor. He has all the power to pray for the sick. It's not only reserved for the evangelist. &gt;&gt; Then our pastor, &gt;&gt; he can pray for the sick. But again tonight I feel treated as a prince. [Music] And I was saying when you're being treated as a prince, what can you do? [Music] Therefore, let us stand and greet each other. Greet the person next to you. &gt;&gt; Greet as many as you can. The pastor warned me here as everywhere everywhere else &gt;&gt; during the week we don't have much Hi. I will take a topic, a golden uh topic. &gt;&gt; May God richly bless you. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I really wanted to pray for you, but I will nevertheless do it at the end of the meeting. &gt;&gt; If somebody's sick, if somebody's going through hardship, &gt;&gt; we will pray for him. I think if the pastor has a bottle of oil in his office, anointing oil, &gt;&gt; we will now. &gt;&gt; Anyone that would like to be anointed I will pray for he that's going through hardship at the end. You have the right for it. &gt;&gt; You are coming here so we can do everything that we could do for you. And we have to do it. &gt;&gt; It's your right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As when we preach, we preach as we preach like this every day. We preach responsibility. &gt;&gt; It's a responsibility. The time is gone. When we're young, we're preaching that as we were seeking for glory. &gt;&gt; But when you get older in the business, you understand. &gt;&gt; It's a responsibility. &gt;&gt; It's your right. when heaven will come. &gt;&gt; So you can enter into the heaven &gt;&gt; with the message of William Brennham. &gt;&gt; We have to make sure if there be God, you may see him. If there's ever heaven, you will go. and all your sin be taken away. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll be completely changed. &gt;&gt; And be different from the people of the world that will please us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say inashi that I always love to see men and women &gt;&gt; leaving the earth &gt;&gt; and going up to glory &gt;&gt; from this church and that's what we want. &gt;&gt; It's a crowning of the job that we doing. Have joy. &gt;&gt; Be blessed. &gt;&gt; Let sickness leaves you. &gt;&gt; Let death gets away from you &gt;&gt; and you be happy, truly happy. May God grant you the desire of your heart and everything that you need of may really give it to you and when we could be back next next year or for in the next time. Let us see that he truly bless you and he truly blesses you &gt;&gt; and that will give us joy to hear that God has taken away your sickness. hearing that God has blessed you to learn that God has given you children when you didn't have them &gt;&gt; and even though you have them &gt;&gt; and may God give you more will give us joy. We want to be in heaven us with our children &gt;&gt; as Jesus will say &gt;&gt; myself and the children that you have given me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Now we wanted to take this scripture. doesn't discipline. I was I wanted to make sure to ask so that I can be disciplined. &gt;&gt; May God bless you richly. &gt;&gt; If I say one word and that blesses you, I think that will be enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's take the scripture &gt;&gt; in this day. I was thinking of the scripture firstian chapter 4. Amen. Thessalonians Thessalonians chapter 4 [Music] &gt;&gt; from verse 13. Amen. [Music] [Applause] But I will not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep. &gt;&gt; That you s not even as others which have no hope. Amen. But &gt;&gt; we if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, [Music] &gt;&gt; even so them also which sleep in Jesus with God bring with him. [Music] But this we say unto you by the word of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the Lord himself [Music] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout &gt;&gt; with the voice of the archangel with the trumpet of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Will come from heaven will descend from heaven. And the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain &gt;&gt; shall be caught up up together &gt;&gt; with them in the clouds to meet the Lord &gt;&gt; in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another &gt;&gt; with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated, please. &gt;&gt; I will say a word of prayer. Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Lord our God, &gt;&gt; I can see your children. that have left far away &gt;&gt; with distances that are here, &gt;&gt; but they have come in your house &gt;&gt; to hear your word. [Music] The Bible says, "Men shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but But every word that proceedth out of the month of God, &gt;&gt; and the month of God in this hour is the prophet of the end time. &gt;&gt; Oh God, bless this church here. &gt;&gt; Each man by his name, &gt;&gt; each woman by his by her name. Every child bear his name. &gt;&gt; Distribute the benediction. &gt;&gt; Share pour the blessings. &gt;&gt; Announce your people. &gt;&gt; Bless our dear pastor. &gt;&gt; Bless his ministry. &gt;&gt; Bless this church. Bless. &gt;&gt; We want our Lord. this church grow in number. May this church be filled within and without. &gt;&gt; And let nobody fall sick. &gt;&gt; All of them be in good health. &gt;&gt; Fill them with your spirit and bless the reading of the word. May you take us aside and you yourself speak in this place &gt;&gt; that will give us life that will do us good &gt;&gt; that will heal the sickness &gt;&gt; and that will bless this church &gt;&gt; for the glory of your name &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wanted us to add another scripture. &gt;&gt; I believe it's not just a little one, but it's a big one. It's in the first Corinthian chapter 15. I believe you found that place. &gt;&gt; I believe you find it. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 15. I would want us to read from verse 50 51. [Music] &gt;&gt; Behold, I show you a mystery. &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep, &gt;&gt; but we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the moment, &gt;&gt; in the twinkling of an eye, &gt;&gt; at the last trumpet, &gt;&gt; for the trumpet shall sound, &gt;&gt; and the dead shall be raised uncorruptible, &gt;&gt; and we shall be changed, and we shall be changed. For this corruptable body must put on in corruptionality &gt;&gt; and this mortal must put on immortality. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. So when this corrupt shall have put on incorruptionality &gt;&gt; and this mortal shall have put on immortality shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory. Where is that steam? &gt;&gt; Oh, great. Where is that victory? May God bless the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Tonight, &gt;&gt; we are going to speak a little bit. &gt;&gt; If you don't finish it up, &gt;&gt; I think one day we will be able to do it. Hello. [Music] &gt;&gt; I wanted just a little bit tonight speak of the mystery of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Because for all of us that have come in the message of bread of bread, [Music] We have come to go to the rapture. We came to go to heaven. [Music] &gt;&gt; We do not come here [Music] to be Christian for Sunday morning. Sunday morning Christians. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sunday morning Christian. [Music] our Bible or the Jehovah witnesses, but we have come here as the elected. [Music] Our name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And God brought us in this world &gt;&gt; that is not really our world. &gt;&gt; That is the world that the way it is. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen to this? [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; We see how bad the world has become. said, "The world is finding himself in a gross darkness." In which it never been before. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you will say amen to this. &gt;&gt; There are wars everywhere. lay everywhere as was prophesied by brother Brennham &gt;&gt; because our messenger the prophet William Brham [Music] &gt;&gt; he's not an evangelist &gt;&gt; but he's a prophet a prophet He's [Music] someone that went before God and spoke to with God. &gt;&gt; And God gives him the message for that time and for people that are living in that time. So they can know what God thinks &gt;&gt; because of them. &gt;&gt; And that's the prophet s. And when he comes, God shows him everything that is happening in that time. God is showing him what is seen in that hour. what the prophet calls sin. That's what God calls sin. &gt;&gt; And then you warn the people. &gt;&gt; This is how we hear. You have people that can say amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to this? And then people they know what God thinks and William Brham &gt;&gt; he's not as Luther. &gt;&gt; He's not like Wesley. &gt;&gt; He's not likeosphet. &gt;&gt; He is a prophet. That's why we know everything God has prepared for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message demonology so we can go quickly. &gt;&gt; He's praying. &gt;&gt; It was preached uh June 6, 1953. Dear God, [Music] &gt;&gt; I realize the great uh darkness of civilization is setting taking place [Music] and is now over. &gt;&gt; The middle of the day is gone. The evening shadows are falling. &gt;&gt; Great light is breaking forth from the kingdom of God to take its place of this gross darkness &gt;&gt; coming on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he's saying I realize that there's a sunset. &gt;&gt; Now time is over. &gt;&gt; We are at about the evening time and now the great light of God is breaking forth. from the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; to take its place of this gross darkness [Music] coming on the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now this is the time in which we are living in a very darkness time. In a few time plagues will be falling &gt;&gt; and they are already some are falling now. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we have seen with co that killed a lot of people but people don't understand it. All them plagues is showing us God is upset &gt;&gt; and he's about to destroy this earth. &gt;&gt; Let me read another quotation before I start talking to you about my topic and then I will end. My brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; you truly have to understand &gt;&gt; that requires to be careful. That is why we have come in this message. This is the message of the prophets as the elected. [Music] We shouldn't die as just anybody. &gt;&gt; No, no, &gt;&gt; we have been warned. &gt;&gt; The words that brother Benam is giving us. &gt;&gt; It's for us to escape &gt;&gt; to go to to the glory [Music] vista. &gt;&gt; He preached in Sar Vista. uh &gt;&gt; uh January 1264 say [Music] the world in a very chaotic age of darkness that never been before. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, there's a blessed light that never shine. [Music] The difference just is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness [Music] upon the earth. [Music] And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be light separated the light from the darkness." &gt;&gt; And I believe [Music] now we are now living in that hour again. [Music] that when &gt;&gt; when God is separating light from darkness &gt;&gt; and is pressing it to the other side of the world &gt;&gt; on to the other side of the world &gt;&gt; and that lightest &gt;&gt; that's the light may be made manifest &gt;&gt; and then the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason I will say shalom to them is because that is God's peace. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I say shalom. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to bring to you this morning &gt;&gt; for the new year. Not looking back, &gt;&gt; but we are looking forward to the breaking of the new day. until there's something &gt;&gt; great laying ahead of us &gt;&gt; where the years has been [Music] there. There has been a joy that we looked forward to. [Music] And we see the pressing the coming of the great light. &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; we can see that's we can see it's breaking over. It's breaking over the [Music] breaking between moral and mortality. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And we see the world find himself in a very chaotic age. in a very chaotic age. &gt;&gt; And for us the elect, [Music] &gt;&gt; our name has been written before in the blame's book of light before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And God had chosen us. He did not choose some other people. Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Even before the world was created, [Music] God was standing as we are and we were coming. And when we were coming He knew people that will love him. &gt;&gt; That was before we do any evil and good. &gt;&gt; Before the world ever begin and but when we were coming, &gt;&gt; he takes this one he put on the side &gt;&gt; and the other way passing. &gt;&gt; He take the other one, &gt;&gt; he put him on the side. and the rest were passing. He take the other one, he put him on the side and the rest they will keep passing. &gt;&gt; And that's the way it was and move over in this age in which we're living in. And God looked and he called them and start writing their names. This one he writes his name [Music] &gt;&gt; and the names the name the name the names &gt;&gt; and he writes &gt;&gt; and he knows they will go in the war and slay the man and shed the blood. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been chosen. The rest the work is the walking. But when God finished to write the names, he takes the book and he placed it here upon his room and he kept it in. He is sure that you will never be lost. &gt;&gt; No matter what will happen. [Music] No matter the teaching that will be given because you are an elect. It says the elect they will never be deceived because the elect have the words. You cannot come. You interpret the word on your own way. The elect will never believe it. The egos are very stubborn against lies. &gt;&gt; You are the eagles. &gt;&gt; You are very stubborn against lies. &gt;&gt; Because the word that we are preaching is in your hearts. &gt;&gt; God placed it in your hearts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The words there He allows you to verify. Nobody can deceive you. Even the devil himself, &gt;&gt; he cannot entice you because you are an elect. Your name are written in the book. It's kept by God. No matter where you go, let it be you are in the United States. You are in China where the way you be, find yourself, it's kept. &gt;&gt; Nobody can deceive you. &gt;&gt; Nobody can take you away. When they give you something wrong, God comes, he takes it away. He cast it away in the dust. &gt;&gt; He leaves you and lets you leave. because you are an elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He started calling his children. &gt;&gt; When he was done with Israel, &gt;&gt; you say amen. &gt;&gt; And then he started calling his children. Jesus died at the cross. &gt;&gt; His blood was shed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; His blood was for to redeem them that had the name written in the book. Amen. Amen. And then now &gt;&gt; the church started &gt;&gt; God started his own church &gt;&gt; in the time of &gt;&gt; in the time of Aris in the time of &gt;&gt; mountainesley &gt;&gt; in the time of William. [Music] God had to call his church &gt;&gt; through seven times &gt;&gt; the elect. &gt;&gt; Seven time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; The the the the seven time is calling them the watchers. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He's calling those seven time the watchers. And there have been seven watches. Amen. &gt;&gt; God had a church in the time of Paul that was engaged. Just engaged. &gt;&gt; She was just engaged. &gt;&gt; And somebody went to find a a wife. He knows about the same time there will be a wedding. &gt;&gt; He gives her the wedding ring. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The engagement ring. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He gave her the engagement ring. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; And then he started with his wife. He comes and gives her the word &gt;&gt; because she's the word &gt;&gt; because the the the groom is the word. &gt;&gt; The groom and the brides are one. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? Wait. as a groom is the word. The bride has to be the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he started moving forward with her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? Every age would call people. &gt;&gt; Okay. [Music] his bride. &gt;&gt; He gives a special message to his only bride. &gt;&gt; That is why the ego are very stubborn against lies. No matter what the Pentecostals can do, &gt;&gt; we will never believe. Though they wake, they they raise the dead, we will never believe. &gt;&gt; We have our own message. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know you can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; And now when we get at the end time, &gt;&gt; this is the time of a wedding. We are at the seventh hour. &gt;&gt; We are at the seventh watch. And there it's a right time for the groom to come and take his bride. [Music] &gt;&gt; And it's right that those people that called from Paul all the way to William Brennham. And you are here. &gt;&gt; You are there. &gt;&gt; You are the people that have been called at the seventh watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we come, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because since he started calling people since the time of Paul all the way to the end, &gt;&gt; it was to rapture them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Do you understand? He &gt;&gt; is to bring them to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; To bring them to the wedding supper of the lamb &gt;&gt; because this is the evening time &gt;&gt; and then it's a wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Who understood it so far? Were you? [Music] &gt;&gt; It's It's not dining &gt;&gt; the time of the the the moon the noon was gone &gt;&gt; it's not a breakfast &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; no no [Music] &gt;&gt; breakfast time was the time of Paul God has reserved a time &gt;&gt; for the wedding supper and when all the virgin that God called &gt;&gt; I showed you Paul it's from the year 53 to 170 &gt;&gt; and the from 170 to 312 &gt;&gt; and Mark &gt;&gt; from 32 to 600 something &gt;&gt; in time of Columbus. We were one of 520 to 1750 [Music] &gt;&gt; and the time of Wesley &gt;&gt; and 1750 &gt;&gt; and the time of Wesley came about. Are you with me? And that went all the way to 1906 &gt;&gt; and then afterward &gt;&gt; in the time of William Brham. &gt;&gt; And this is the evening time. &gt;&gt; This message is the message of the bride. This the message that we have is the bride's message. &gt;&gt; It has been given to the the wed bride. [Music] It's uh addressed to the elect's bride, elect lady. Are you saying amen to this? &gt;&gt; Because I want you to understand. &gt;&gt; I don't want to start teaching about the rapture if you don't understand what it means. [Music] Now, it's about the wed bride. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's about the elect lady. That's you. &gt;&gt; That's all of you this morning. It's all of us here. &gt;&gt; This is the time of the brided bride. &gt;&gt; And the word that is bringing forth is the opening of the seals. The mystery that have been hid before the foundation of the world. the the the mystery that got hit in the back part of his mind. Now he's taking it and reveal it to us. &gt;&gt; That's why God had revealed everything to us. He had revealed us the marriage. If you have mistaken about marriage, that's your own problem. But God has given the whole revelation about marriage. for God. A man has to have only one wife, not many. &gt;&gt; God did not give Adam a lot of wives. He gives him only one wife. It's Eve. &gt;&gt; Who knows is the truth. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we really want to keep the purity of the word &gt;&gt; for God. A a a young lady has to go to marriage virgin. &gt;&gt; That's what we believe. I I know you know the the the par parable of the the 10th virgin. [Music] Now I'm speaking about the waiting time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God after calling the seven churches, &gt;&gt; all them churches, a time has to come where the groom that was in heaven has to come on earth. He has to take his bride [Music] &gt;&gt; meaning all them churches from Paul to all the way to William Brham that's his bride &gt;&gt; and he has to take her back who understood it who understood it and when he take her back is to took her to heaven. &gt;&gt; That's why we call rapture. &gt;&gt; We have come to go to the rapture. &gt;&gt; All them that was asleep. &gt;&gt; From Paul to Irene &gt;&gt; to Martin. &gt;&gt; All of them &gt;&gt; to all the way to William. All them churches are &gt;&gt; his bride. &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I I want you to understand it. I don't want it to move like that. &gt;&gt; You see that's his own bride. And when we get to the evening time, &gt;&gt; about the evening time, &gt;&gt; he said there was a time that was neither day or night, &gt;&gt; but about the evening time, &gt;&gt; the light shall come &gt;&gt; and the light is this message. &gt;&gt; It's this message that we have. &gt;&gt; Are you happy? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's the evening light. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's the evening light. We don't walk in the darkos. They just make their own songs in their own mind. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Our prophets, &gt;&gt; God gave him songs. &gt;&gt; That's what we see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this church that we are that's here that's everywhere &gt;&gt; that has been called by this message &gt;&gt; it's the bride of Jesus Christ and when we are there is the end of the dispensation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] This is the the end of the time of redemption. &gt;&gt; There's no prophet after us. &gt;&gt; There will not any be any people be after us. We are the last ones. And Jesus comes. Do you understand it? &gt;&gt; To take us and to take us to heaven. to the wedding supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Natural types is spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's like as a man, &gt;&gt; he choose his wife and the wife. When the time comes, he takes the wife to the pastor and the pastor, he he consecrates them and he bless the wedding. But right after the wedding, when they leave, they go to the reception, the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God does the same thing as men. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; God is he found out that the seven churches are not complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they constitute his beloved bride because people the tender of Paul they slept &gt;&gt; because from 53 to 170 that's been a while people from they slept already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. them of mountain they slept &gt;&gt; because now it's 600 after Jesus &gt;&gt; them of Columbus they slept that's 1600 after Jesus that many years they died them of Luther died &gt;&gt; do you understand so Then of Wesley they died they slept theos they died they slept &gt;&gt; the only living people &gt;&gt; is the people of William Brenham it's you here and now the time has come &gt;&gt; and Jesus has to come &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven &gt;&gt; taking his own bride and then he takes care. &gt;&gt; I was thinking of bringing three books and then Jesus has to come. The time is no over. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; There will not be anything behind. We are the last. &gt;&gt; You could be the last one that was called. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus comes from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul is saying. He's explaining the mystery of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; we don't have much time. But I'll just say what I can say. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Jesus comes three times on the earth. &gt;&gt; In all the plane of redemption, Jesus will come three times on the earth. The very first time he was to redeem his bride. That's what he did at the cross. &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And now the second time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he comes, &gt;&gt; when he came first, &gt;&gt; he was to redeem his bride. &gt;&gt; He went to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He died on Calvary. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He died on Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he had to come back for the second time. And that was to finish the plan of redemption. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to take his ride that he called since Ephesus. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And then at that time, &gt;&gt; it's now. &gt;&gt; That's the time. &gt;&gt; It's when it comes on the cloud. I see the cloud back there. Wait, that's when he comes to take his bride. &gt;&gt; Who understood it so far? That's the time we are living in is coming to reveal the fullness of the plan of redemption &gt;&gt; because he took the book &gt;&gt; out of the hands that he that was sitting on the throne now is coming to take his bride. &gt;&gt; But that bride, &gt;&gt; that's who we are. &gt;&gt; It's us here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to take us to take us to heaven &gt;&gt; because we are on the earth. &gt;&gt; It takes care of to taking three things. It takes the shout when it comes down. &gt;&gt; It takes the shout. These are the things the material to rupture us. &gt;&gt; It takes the shout. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He takes that with him. And then after he takes the voice of the archangel, &gt;&gt; he takes that with him and it comes along with it and he take the trumpet of God. And then he brings the three things. &gt;&gt; These are the things that allowing him to rapture us. &gt;&gt; The shout, &gt;&gt; the sh the shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the voice of the angel &gt;&gt; and then afterward and oh he also takes &gt;&gt; and the trumps &gt;&gt; I don't know if you say amen says the say this is a very glorious mystery of of all the mystery because he caps all the mysteries of the all the plan of redemption is to rapture us. &gt;&gt; It takes three things. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; While he's descending on the earth and he says now the seven churches are united now &gt;&gt; and to rapture them He knows that he takes three things. He take he comes as a bride as a groom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; And we are his bride. &gt;&gt; But to take us to take us out of the the earth to take us to the wedding supper way there in heaven. He has to take three things. The shout. He has to take the voice of the angel. &gt;&gt; And also the sound of the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Do we have people that can say amen now? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why the cry the shouts? Why? What is it for? They shout. &gt;&gt; It's the message &gt;&gt; to gather together the bride &gt;&gt; to call the brideenver. &gt;&gt; People from Denver, &gt;&gt; people from Washington, &gt;&gt; them that are over there. &gt;&gt; It's the shouts calling them. &gt;&gt; But Paul said the Lord himself. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No his friend &gt;&gt; nor his theophony &gt;&gt; know his pill of fire. &gt;&gt; But Paul said the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Lord himself &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; and the prophet says &gt;&gt; the Lord does the three things. Kill &gt;&gt; while he's &gt;&gt; he's descending. &gt;&gt; That's the materials requires to rapture us &gt;&gt; who understood it. &gt;&gt; Even if I don't finish it, &gt;&gt; our pastor will finish it up. &gt;&gt; But the thing that you had to know the Lord when he realized that all the seven churches are ready &gt;&gt; and now they all formed the bride of Jesus &gt;&gt; the last church then he should he had to come amen [Music] &gt;&gt; he had to come to reveal the fullness of his and he gives to his bride over there, but he knew that it took three things to rapture his bride. He required the shout. &gt;&gt; That's the message to gather the together the bride. &gt;&gt; That's the message. &gt;&gt; The message of winner. &gt;&gt; And then afterward He had to take the voice of the angel &gt;&gt; and that voice &gt;&gt; he comes along with it. &gt;&gt; And then afterward he also brings the sound of the trumpet that's Paul said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what these three things &gt;&gt; allow allows him to rapture us. The shouts &gt;&gt; message &gt;&gt; it's the message &gt;&gt; says brother says &gt;&gt; brotherham says &gt;&gt; and you when you believe that the brother bam says &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; it changes your body &gt;&gt; it gives you a change of the body &gt;&gt; amen because in the rapture There are two people, two category of people that going in. &gt;&gt; Some are already dead. &gt;&gt; You've seen people of four, they already dead. &gt;&gt; The people, the mountain, &gt;&gt; Wesley, all of them, &gt;&gt; they were already dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's only us alive. &gt;&gt; Even us, there are people, some of us are already dead. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of the rapture concern two kinds of people, the first category. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very the three things [Music] allow him to rapture the two kinds the two category of people that are concerned for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One group they dead. &gt;&gt; You understood it. &gt;&gt; You understood it. &gt;&gt; They were already dead.

[Music] We are still alive. Then we are concerned &gt;&gt; because we need to go to the rapture as well to to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Two category of people that go to the rapture. [Music] Them that were dead. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? [Music] &gt;&gt; They go into the rapture by resurrection. &gt;&gt; They go in. They enter in the rapture by resurrection. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But as alive, [Music] &gt;&gt; we go we enter into rapture by translation. [Music] That meaning our body will change. We don't die. &gt;&gt; We are alive. The time of the rapture comes and then God it changes our body without passing through the grave and we are walking we are walking like this. As we walking and then we change and we go to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Who can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we change, &gt;&gt; we are going to meet them that were already dead, &gt;&gt; that were resurrected. &gt;&gt; Now here, &gt;&gt; the three things here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Yes. The the very word church means called out of. As Moses called the nation out of the nation, the Holy Spirit is calling a bride out of the church. &gt;&gt; A church out of the church members from every denomination making up a bride. &gt;&gt; Bride tree. &gt;&gt; It's in the tape. The bride tree. &gt;&gt; A bride coming out call. And that's the one that the bride tree is the bride rather. He is the one that is going to be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's alone.

Because we don't steal, we don't lie, &gt;&gt; we don't do things. [Music] &gt;&gt; We go to the rapture because God elected us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God told the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is the tutor, the master of the church, &gt;&gt; as I showed you. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's the tutor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the one keeping the child. &gt;&gt; God tells told the the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because God has his book. &gt;&gt; As we are preaching, he's calling his calling his people. &gt;&gt; And they are in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are in the book. I give a little teaching, right? &gt;&gt; I always tell people what I give it's a teaching &gt;&gt; but there's a boss himself. There is a boss himself. When he comes, he just choose you. He put you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He takes you and then he send you to the rapture. He takes the other one and send you to the rapture. &gt;&gt; He take the other one to the rapture. &gt;&gt; He's the boss himself. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's the boss himself. &gt;&gt; Does he make you happy? Do you know that the boss knows you? &gt;&gt; Yes, he knows you. &gt;&gt; He knows you. &gt;&gt; That is why he calls you here. &gt;&gt; The one that didn't call, they're not here. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go quickly. I see now you understand it. &gt;&gt; Let me read a little bit. Do you did you understand a little bit &gt;&gt; where this great ministry ministry of the rapture is going? &gt;&gt; We have come here to go to the rapture. Somebody asked me a question uh on on the TV when I was speaking of the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was in China. He said, "Pastor Masi, you are speaking of the coming of the Lord. Do you know that only people that knows the coming of the Lord will go to the rapture?" I was with another pastor there at the platform. I told him, "Pastor, I know the answer. I know the answer. &gt;&gt; I told him &gt;&gt; to understand simply the mystery of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the grace God has given to us. But when it comes to go to the rapture, it's God himself that is choosing them that will go to the rapture. I don't know if there are people that understand you. &gt;&gt; You know, Peter understood better. &gt;&gt; He said, "You are the son of God." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You have been revealed by God." &gt;&gt; But Thomas didn't understand anything. &gt;&gt; Thomas have no clue. Even John at that time didn't understand anything. &gt;&gt; But when you look around the throne, &gt;&gt; there are 24 elders, &gt;&gt; Matthew is there. &gt;&gt; You see, Paul is there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; yeah, it's there. Even to that did not believe I don't believe he's resurrected. &gt;&gt; I have to touch I have to touch him. &gt;&gt; But when you look there are 24 elders around the throne. &gt;&gt; Meaning it's just the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It's just the grace of God. It's not because you understand very well the mysteries that does not depends how well you understand the mysteries. I always tell people &gt;&gt; we you are here in the great city never &gt;&gt; it's true but there are people in the villages they don't even have a page of the message &gt;&gt; but they believe brother Benham is a prophet and they believe the liter that has been taught to them. &gt;&gt; They believe the litter. They believe the litter &gt;&gt; and they are there in the jungle. &gt;&gt; They never seen a car. &gt;&gt; But [Music] the pastor write hands write everything on his book. notebook. &gt;&gt; Yeah, in the notebook. &gt;&gt; That's from what he's teaching from. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know all them mysteries. &gt;&gt; But when the rapture will come, &gt;&gt; God will rapture them. God doesn't say, "Oh, they don't have a laptop. They're not going to." No, &gt;&gt; just one page. And that was enough for them to go to the rapture. &gt;&gt; But how about you? &gt;&gt; You're going to go to the rapture. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. There there's a woman &gt;&gt; but I'm speaking of &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; I think it's influence &gt;&gt; that women [Music] &gt;&gt; it's it's called Monro Marilyn Monro. &gt;&gt; Marilyn Monroe. [Music] &gt;&gt; She was a celebrity in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; She was in Holyhood. What about one day? She was a true prostitute. the she they had a lot of books of her that has been published &gt;&gt; now. Bam went to the mountain to rest with his family. And the newspapers publish that uh she was killed when she was in &gt;&gt; she she committed suicide when she was in a room. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But now &gt;&gt; saw that in a vision and told his family this woman did not commit commit suicide. She had a heart attack and no better &gt;&gt; in the message the flashing red lights of his coming &gt;&gt; he started talking about this woman [Music] he said this woman &gt;&gt; she's the the most beautiful woman since Eve all the way to the end. &gt;&gt; Okay. But she did not commit suicide. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No. [Music] &gt;&gt; But she had a hard time. And when she she reach out her hand to take the the pills and she died. &gt;&gt; Okay. And says in the message the flashing red lights of his coming. I believe Marilyn Monro &gt;&gt; she was looking for something say I believe she's saved a prostitute she did all kinds of things but says &gt;&gt; I believe she's saved &gt;&gt; because she was looking for something. She was looking for something. &gt;&gt; It's this message. &gt;&gt; But she never came across the message. But since she was looking for it, I believe she's saved. Now listen. If the fact that she was just looking for the message, &gt;&gt; a prostitute, &gt;&gt; but she's saved. &gt;&gt; How about you? &gt;&gt; You that have found the message &gt;&gt; that have come here and the pastor supposed to baptize you in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; How about you? &gt;&gt; She did all that. Oh, he did all that. Oh, you did this. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; Is that the &gt;&gt; You are saved. &gt;&gt; You are saved. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. &gt;&gt; This just the grace. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in the grace? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to read &gt;&gt; just a little something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now the great mystery of the rapture. &gt;&gt; We came to go to the rapture. &gt;&gt; I believe you will be there. &gt;&gt; I believe you will be there. As long as Jesus is our God, &gt;&gt; I believe you will be there. The way you sing. Amen. Are you doubting or &gt;&gt; I preach with my picture here? &gt;&gt; It's the Lord of all the glory. &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. &gt;&gt; He knows all of you. &gt;&gt; He knows your name. &gt;&gt; He knows that you're here. But please, &gt;&gt; you will be in that great rapture. Whatever Moses asked, &gt;&gt; how do you know that you're an elect? &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; I feel it in my heart, &gt;&gt; and I I put myself in there. You want to put yourself in there, right? &gt;&gt; You want to put yourself in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you putting yourself in there? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No, you will be there. &gt;&gt; I read to close. We are going to say &gt;&gt; paragraph 130. In the midst of the rapture, [Music] three things has to happen before Jesus appears. &gt;&gt; A shout, &gt;&gt; a voice, a trumpet. &gt;&gt; Let's take the shout. Jesus does the three things &gt;&gt; as he's descending a shout. &gt;&gt; What is the shout? &gt;&gt; It's the message going forth first and &gt;&gt; the living bread &gt;&gt; of life bringing forth the bride. Did you understand very well &gt;&gt; and this message? &gt;&gt; It's the shout &gt;&gt; and to call the boy &gt;&gt; and to be likened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the message that called us paragraph needs to be enough. He has to send this. &gt;&gt; The first thing that comes when he starts descending &gt;&gt; from the heaven, &gt;&gt; there's a shout. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; It's a message to get the people together. &gt;&gt; A message comes forth first. Now lming lamp trimming time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a lamp trimming time. Rest &gt;&gt; and trim your lamp. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can say amen. &gt;&gt; It's a midnight cry to call the virgin &gt;&gt; and we are those virgin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But &gt;&gt; it's a lamp trimming time. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You put your oil &gt;&gt; in your lamp. &gt;&gt; You go from justification &gt;&gt; to sanctification. &gt;&gt; From sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; from the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to the sealing &gt;&gt; and the sealing translation &gt;&gt; to the translation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And your body changes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we go to this wedding supper. &gt;&gt; But your new body, &gt;&gt; it's in you right now. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have to trim your lamp &gt;&gt; to go to that great rapture. &gt;&gt; Okay. I believe &gt;&gt; that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the justification &gt;&gt; to the sanctification &gt;&gt; sanctification &gt;&gt; and to sanctification &gt;&gt; to the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; from the bottom of the Holy Ghost to the ceiling there at the summit of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; That's where we are. We are in the third pool my friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are working for the change of our body &gt;&gt; and the the shout. &gt;&gt; It's the message and the voice of the occasion is the voice of the resurrection calling the the dead to the resurrection. Paul said that the Lord himself shall descend with shout with the voice with the sound of the trumpet. &gt;&gt; The very first thing that happens the dead in Christ shall resurrect first and then we that are alive. And said when it was asked There's the bread we gathered in the west. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; they don't have to gather there at the west. &gt;&gt; They will be gathered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when Jesus descends when revelation 10 happens, he'll say the very first thing &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ &gt;&gt; will raise first and then us which are alive. You can read in the question answer number one paragraph 53. He says &gt;&gt; the very very first thing that happens &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; We that which are alive &gt;&gt; we will continue simply &gt;&gt; as nothing happened. And then after we will start running in the the speed of the mind &gt;&gt; and we will meet them that were already resurrected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says why we don't see them. But you could see them. He said I see brother Stewood. Hey brother. He's waving his hand. He's over there at the door. &gt;&gt; He say because when we look &gt;&gt; we see about the the 70th of second. It really go fast when we look &gt;&gt; with our own eyes. But they are in a faster dimension. Okay. A faster dimension. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But the day we will be in the same body as them, we will be able to see them. Amen. Amen. And then brother says &gt;&gt; we will be changed &gt;&gt; and he says in Abraham and his seed &gt;&gt; we will uh change according to the the principle of Eston said if two cars or two objects are traveling in the speed of Right? [Music] &gt;&gt; They can cross paths without hearing each other. &gt;&gt; Okay? Why? Because in that speed, &gt;&gt; do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Because in that speed, &gt;&gt; everything breaks apart. &gt;&gt; You know why we change the body? When you reach that speed, &gt;&gt; our body, &gt;&gt; it's formed &gt;&gt; with calcium, &gt;&gt; potassium, &gt;&gt; potassium, &gt;&gt; petroleum, &gt;&gt; and the petroleum &gt;&gt; and the cosmic light and the body goes back to the dust &gt;&gt; because of the speed. &gt;&gt; And then we go into another body. a faster body. [Music] &gt;&gt; At that time, brother say we'll meet together for about around 30 days [Music] and then we'll be seeing each other. Brother Neighbor's there. &gt;&gt; Oh, we are there, &gt;&gt; our pastor's there, mama. Oh, mama's there. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. We are there &gt;&gt; and we will be spending 30 over 30 days. &gt;&gt; And then after that &gt;&gt; with them, God will rapture us and then we will meet in the in the air. But Bam says &gt;&gt; what Paul is calling the air, &gt;&gt; it's the heavens. Paul, he's calling it the heavens. &gt;&gt; And we'll meet in that time, in that moment, in the place is the most wonderful moment. We will meet. Oh, mama is there. Oh, my husband is there. It'll be a catching up time. It's the time we'll be catching up and we'll meet &gt;&gt; and then we will go to the wedding supper. [Music] &gt;&gt; This is wonderful. &gt;&gt; This is glorious &gt;&gt; to dine with the king with a long table of two,000 kilometers. No matter where you are, &gt;&gt; you see Jesus. No matter where you find yourself, &gt;&gt; you will see the Lord. &gt;&gt; You will greet him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will be looking at him. &gt;&gt; You will see the Lord himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You'll be blessed. All sins forgotten. [Music] We are even in the mystery of experation or atonement. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But what is the atonement? &gt;&gt; It's Christ personified in his word and made flesh among us. &gt;&gt; This is what we're going to be. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that will resurrect us. I wanted to take only one minute &gt;&gt; to show you the importance of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that will resurrect you. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's why you have to do all you can to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He is the one who will resurrect you. &gt;&gt; He will take you to heaven. He will take you to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; He's the one checking up your name. &gt;&gt; As long as your name is in there, &gt;&gt; you'll be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please, maybe the last sheep has been already called. Everything that we doing is teaching. is just to have you &gt;&gt; is to maintain you says &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost that we have &gt;&gt; that is why he's saying the seven weeks of Daniel &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will be raptured since people don't know what is what's the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; they will never know &gt;&gt; they will go on continue to preach calling souls to Christ &gt;&gt; to go to church &gt;&gt; to sing. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost will be raptured. &gt;&gt; That is why while he's still here. &gt;&gt; You have to seek after him. &gt;&gt; You have to have it. &gt;&gt; He is the one giving you the new body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Explain to us the mystery of translation &gt;&gt; in question answer number three. He say it's a change. Abraham changed his body. Sarah changes her body. He said this eye this senses. God is in confusion. But &gt;&gt; but this new body &gt;&gt; that comes from the new birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A new body will materialize. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A new body will be materialized. &gt;&gt; Then your new body &gt;&gt; is in here in this building, right next to you, &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; No. Like people, seven thunders people that sing. when the thunders will be sounding there. The thunders already been thundered. The message I'm reading to you, those are the thunders. &gt;&gt; They have been out of the voice when he got inside of you. It gives you the faith of the rapture. It gives you new body. I believe tonight, &gt;&gt; tonight, &gt;&gt; a new body got into many people &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; May God bless the king of his word. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, pastor. &gt;&gt; Seems like I took a little bit of your time.
