[1:01] Isabelle just cause just say hello mrs.
[1:05] dogmeat that was how Jezebel life ended
[1:14] the dog had to lick her blood that's it
[1:21] and the policy apology but I suffer not
[1:25] a woman to teach me policy so a woman
[1:29] who's teaching is exactly the same as a
[1:33] woman who's usurping authority over the
[1:36] man so don't blame the woman preaching
[1:42] already blended fine funky fresh as
[1:44] Jezebel as a woman or as a Jezebel come
[1:47] from was you shopping also little over
[1:50] the husband the husband could not say
[1:54] much everything was sent on Jezebel to
[2:00] the extent when somebody does anything
[2:04] to the husband they ours were was going
[2:08] to complain to his wife
[2:11] and they said take all the 400 profit of
[2:17] [Music]
[2:19] kill them me and when they kill them
[2:23] they probably thought you just a bell
[2:25] was not there but he was looking in his
[2:32] heart was not happy what did they have
[2:45] one to accuse the ledger to his wife in
[2:53] commending woman that's not a woman
[3:02] their four young boys willing to get
[3:06] married
[3:07] Sumalee what look at the woman look at
[3:11] those things today the young boys the
[3:14] only thing they want to about the
[3:16] futility that's all but the woman would
[3:21] they don't care you will have a virgin
[3:25] who is gonna dominate on you and that
[3:29] will be a curse
[3:31] [Music]
[3:33] the Casa de salut they are everywhere
[3:37] talking talking to Papa they dominate
[3:41] like that I do mean and to the extent
[3:43] that woman Jezebel was not only
[3:48] commanding her house upon the Paschal
[3:50] mother Papa's she became also able to
[3:53] command other houses should go see other
[3:57] sisters Jezebel a prophetess with a
[4:02] doctrine how do you do my dear sister
[4:16] [Music]
[4:19] fifty-fifty not only fifty-fifty we are
[4:23] almost the 60 new semester Santos a new
[4:28] life a man go down you don't see the
[4:34] salary that means you don't shop you
[4:39] don't know those are tied to sex a
[4:42] passage we practice they fix
[4:44] influence the other woman and she feels
[4:46] the other and then she goes tomorrow do
[4:51] man
[4:52] the men come to discourage from now on
[4:59] don't buy me a skirt anymore that's the
[5:02] doctrine of Jesus teaching
[5:06] and Bonham said being a dominating
[5:11] female is enticing
[5:16] but you don't want to be enticed into
[5:20] Christ not only Antichrist but the seeds
[5:25] of the Roman Catholic Church unless the
[5:28] most delicious Roman Catholic are in her
[5:30] know she made the seed of the Catholic
[5:38] Church list the most religiously even in
[5:40] the Catholic Church members demands
[5:42] don't believe there is no female
[5:47] preacher
[5:49] no female priest so putting a woman in
[5:59] the pool it's out of the will of God the
[6:09] same way this is what I want to make on
[6:17] the
[6:19] [Music]
[6:31] when a woman gets from behind the table
[6:37] in the kitchen in the house taking care
[6:42] of her own leader ministry God gave her
[6:45] [Music]
[6:46] her babies she's out of the will of God
[6:52] put her in a pulpit with a metallic
[6:54] shell she's out of the will of God hello
[6:59] oh we don't preach we just work you are
[7:08] a dominating female someone a woman on
[7:14] the pulpit is exactly the same as a
[7:18] woman going to command men dr. Malcolm
[7:21] in from kotaku they promote me assistant
[7:24] manager ah you are working with the flow
[7:28] and all the men you say a wife a woman
[7:38] can be dominating with her elegance
[7:43] stubborn and some with quietness young
[7:51] people don't think that the one who
[7:53] talked a lot the sweet thunders are
[7:58] thundering in therefore when a woman
[8:06] tries to act like a man dress like a man
[8:15] like a man that's not given to a woman
[8:20] you may think I'm making comments now a
[8:23] woman has a special way of talk
[8:26] [Music]
[8:28] different from a man we feel not with
[8:31] authority but if you see a woman very
[8:34] authoritative you're welcome when I say
[8:38] it is the period
[8:42] something is wrong I talk like a man
[8:48] she's out of her place
[8:51] a woman is feminist sweet loving not big
[9:00] and carrying on made before my men
[9:13] develop laughs even in school a girl
[9:18] sisters act in a feminine way she's not
[9:24] supposed to be and when she does that
[9:29] her life is profitable she's a sweet
[9:34] loving kind where Adam is more the burly
[9:38] type and regardless of how bad G's Abell
[9:44] could be God gave her space to repent of
[9:50] her fornication is jessabelle he banged
[9:55] upon the Bible she said she repented and
[9:59] not you get the spirit of Jezebel
[10:04] [Music]
[10:09] and I don't believe that to you my
[10:11] sisters you are not listening to the
[10:14] things in pain we have some wonderful
[10:18] sisters when this is the young sister
[10:31] can go there good advice this is how to
[10:38] leave this is what to do and when they
[10:42] try to go over some certain questions
[10:45] well in case they report I always hear
[10:49] the hypocrisy I go see the past about
[10:51] this she's not involved in the thing as
[10:54] a person to enough issues
