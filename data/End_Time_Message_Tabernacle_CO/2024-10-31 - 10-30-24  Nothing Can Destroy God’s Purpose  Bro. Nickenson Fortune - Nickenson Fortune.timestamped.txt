[1:01:36] something if brother did not come with
[1:01:39] this
[1:01:40] message they wouldn't have any Rapture
[1:01:43] outside of this message because to go to
[1:01:45] the Rapture you have to have the faith
[1:01:48] of the
[1:01:49] Rapture and to have the faith of the
[1:01:51] Rapture you have to have the spirit of
[1:01:53] God in you as was saying
[1:01:57] this is the way to do
[1:01:59] it enough
[1:02:01] word enough spirit for
[1:02:04] it that is why time God had revealed all
[1:02:08] the word seven
[1:02:11] tunders everything is revealed it's not
[1:02:14] for
[1:02:15] nothing to give us the rupture
[1:02:18] faith that is why outside of this
[1:02:20] message there's no
[1:02:22] Rapture if you are in this message take
[1:02:25] the message
[1:02:26] seriously there will not be a second
[1:02:30] turn either you go to the Rapture or you

[1:08:15] church to raise good child children so
[1:08:19] that they can be preachers tomorrow they
[1:08:21] can be deons

[1:08:44] and sister seek the face of God God
[1:08:48] needs you amen let me tell
[1:08:53] you according to the plan of God
[1:08:55] according to the plan of
[1:08:59] God Joel 2 verse
[1:09:03] 28 the
[1:09:05] young the young people will have
[1:09:08] Vision the old one will have
[1:09:13] dreams don't think it's something
[1:09:16] extraordinary all these people they in
[1:09:19] the
[1:09:23] church at the birth of every one of
[1:09:27] you there's something it's called
[1:09:30] conscience and there's something that
[1:09:32] called
[1:09:35] subconscious God is placing it in a
[1:09:37] certain distance from each
[1:09:39] other
[1:09:41] the people that God created to have
[1:09:46] dreams is placing a conscience away from
[1:09:50] sub that is why was saying somebody's
[1:09:54] dreaming
[1:09:59] he's not sleeping
[1:10:01] deeply because now I'm
[1:10:05] conscious when I'm sleeping I'm getting
[1:10:07] into a
[1:10:09] subconscious being in a subconscious we
[1:10:12] can see
[1:10:13] things let me open a little paresis when
[1:10:16] you sleep to wake up it's a
[1:10:23] miracle potentially it's death
[1:10:28] it's conscience you leave your
[1:10:29] conscience subconscious you in the
[1:10:32] subconscious it's a
[1:10:34] miracle it's a
[1:10:36] miracle every time you sleep and you
[1:10:39] wake up the first thing you got to do is
[1:10:43] to give glory to God you Rose me up
[1:10:49] again can you say Amen to that because
[1:10:53] that's the TR and when you say Amen
[1:10:56] you not say Amen you say Amen to the
[1:10:59] word because is nothing what is
[1:11:02] important is the word he's the almighty
[1:11:04] God in the beginning was the word the
[1:11:07] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:11:09] the word was made fles and dwell Among
[1:11:12] Us the word is nothing than the Lord
[1:11:15] Jesus
[1:11:16] Christ best brothers and
[1:11:19] sisters say look it carefully there are
[1:11:22] people they don't dream
[1:11:27] you might think oh I'm not a Christian I
[1:11:29] don't dream God let it be like
[1:11:32] that God created this person he places
[1:11:36] subconscious away from the
[1:11:39] subconscious when the person sleep he
[1:11:42] gets into his subconscious to wake
[1:11:46] up he forgets
[1:11:48] everything God made him that
[1:11:51] way but God creates some people to have
[1:11:55] VIs
[1:11:56] the example of the Prophet can place the
[1:11:58] consci and subconscious together the
[1:12:02] prophet can speak to you while still
[1:12:05] awake he enters in the sub I see this I
[1:12:09] see that you were
[1:12:11] there being in conscious he can talk to
[1:12:15] you he
[1:12:18] means when it comes to young people
[1:12:21] old Visions dreams
[1:12:25] them people they are
[1:12:27] there you just have to consecrate
[1:12:29] yourself so that God can use your
[1:12:32] gift that's the way brother
[1:12:35] resisters I want to tell
[1:12:37] you like
[1:12:40] Joshua the crossing of the Jord he invit
[1:12:43] his people to sanctify them sanctify
[1:12:47] yourself God needs you want to do
[1:12:51] something we are getting into the
[1:12:53] Promised Land and our Prophet is
[1:12:57] saying the promised land is nothing that
[1:13:00] the B of the Holy Spirit but he was
[1:13:02] saying
[1:13:03] it but he was saying in another way
[1:13:06] because brothers and
[1:13:09] sisters say we there's two
[1:13:12] seasons the season of mortal
[1:13:15] life in which we're living right now in
[1:13:17] the season of mortal life we die every
[1:13:22] age but there's a season of immortal
[1:13:25] it's a season to come but you have to
[1:13:28] prepare
[1:13:29] yourself while you still in the Mortal
[1:13:31] life to get
[1:13:35] into into Immortal
[1:13:38] Life Like A
[1:13:40] th oh the four is crucifixion is
[1:13:44] crucifiction four is getting
[1:13:46] old because the winter will
[1:13:49] come but the life in this
[1:13:52] s will not die
[1:13:55] before
[1:13:56] winter he will leave the the that is why
[1:14:00] you see the Lea
[1:14:01] falling it's it's it's a life leaving
[1:14:05] the the leaves so that we cannot destroy
[1:14:08] it where is that life that that was in
[1:14:12] the the leaves it goes back to the orig
[1:14:16] it goes back to the roots because after
[1:14:19] that after the fall there will be there
[1:14:23] will be after the
[1:14:26] winter there will be
[1:14:30] a the
[1:14:31] spring the same life that left the
[1:14:35] leaves to hide in the roots in the
[1:14:39] origin to
[1:14:42] for that represent death do not kill him
[1:14:47] that life will come back
[1:14:48] again that life will come back
[1:14:52] again do you understand that
[1:14:55] life will come
[1:14:57] back
[1:15:00] but highlight
[1:15:02] something like the leaves that
[1:15:05] fell the life that will come
[1:15:08] back it's not in the
[1:15:10] original it's not in original Le but
[1:15:13] it's in the new le now glory to
[1:15:16] God thank you Lord it will come back in
[1:15:19] a
[1:15:22] new I want you to understand this very
[1:15:24] carefully
[1:15:25] when Abraham over
[1:15:28] there was old about 90 years old God
[1:15:32] visited him God told Abraham the next
[1:15:37] year you will have a son with
[1:15:42] Sarah you say today there were ordinary
[1:15:44] man let me tell you brothers and
[1:15:47] sisters God can do
[1:15:49] anything nothing can hinder the purpose
[1:15:53] of God purpose of God God can do
[1:15:57] anything there were there were ordinary
[1:15:59] man that came to Abraham there were like
[1:16:03] ordinary men when you look at eyes but
[1:16:07] the prophet was
[1:16:08] saying between those among those three
[1:16:12] men one of them was the Eternal
[1:16:15] God and the two others were Angels God
[1:16:19] can do anything let me tell
[1:16:21] you God is the one who gives you that
[1:16:24] body
[1:16:25] God gives you that
[1:16:27] body that is the reason
[1:16:30] why because disease are demons dises are
[1:16:34] from the devil that's what prop says if
[1:16:37] that demon comes in the body it's your
[1:16:40] body it's your
[1:16:42] Poss you can go to
[1:16:45] God this is my
[1:16:49] body you to leave this body because it's
[1:16:52] my body
[1:16:56] get to position because God has given
[1:16:58] you that
[1:17:02] body God is taking that chemicals
[1:17:04] elements he builds a body he get into
[1:17:08] that he made another body for
[1:17:13] war Abraham he was in under the tree
[1:17:18] tree he show three
[1:17:20] men now you ask your a
[1:17:23] question AB
[1:17:26] knew that one of them was eternal God we
[1:17:30] have a
[1:17:35] prophet two day before that
[1:17:38] happened God met
[1:17:41] Abraham he did not call him ABR he
[1:17:44] called him
[1:17:47] Abraham God Called to
[1:17:50] Abram you will not be called ABR now you
[1:17:53] be called Abraham
[1:18:01] the
[1:18:02] way Abraham recognized that was the
[1:18:06] Lord because only Abraham the Lord
[1:18:10] knew the name was
[1:18:12] changed when that man stood before
[1:18:15] AB even if he looked like an ordinary
[1:18:18] man he said
[1:18:20] Abraham Sarah your
[1:18:23] wife ABR recogn quickly that was the
[1:18:26] Lord
[1:18:28] amen glory to
[1:18:30] God
[1:18:33] Abraham was married when he was
[1:18:36] young when they were still 16 they they
[1:18:39] got
[1:18:40] married Abraham was not sterile but
[1:18:44] Sarah was
[1:18:45] sterile or
[1:18:47] baren at that
[1:18:51] age what can they do what can they do to
[1:18:53] have babies
[1:18:55] when they were
[1:18:58] 19 said God was doing
[1:19:02] something God made them young
[1:19:05] again God made them young
[1:19:08] again they became young
[1:19:11] again you can say
[1:19:13] again it's it's your Prophet saying that
[1:19:17] I'll tell
[1:19:20] you Sarah became so young
[1:19:25] the young king
[1:19:27] ABC saw a old
[1:19:30] lady of
[1:19:33] 0 he fell in
[1:19:36] love God made her young again I want to
[1:19:40] tell
[1:19:41] you with this body we cannot go to the
[1:19:44] Rapture even if God make us young again
[1:19:48] we cannot go to the
[1:19:50] Rapture not only God made them young
[1:19:54] you cannot forget Sarah was
[1:19:58] bar God took away the
[1:20:02] barness not just God will make us
[1:20:05] young he will change his body to a new
[1:20:09] heavly body
[1:20:11] glorify to go to the
[1:20:14] rupture in the wedding
[1:20:20] supper I want to have to stop after 5
[1:20:23] minutes
[1:20:24] it looks like I haven't started
[1:20:26] preaching yet there's a lot of things to
[1:20:28] say Amen because the word is unable SCE
[1:20:31] I love this message this is my only
[1:20:34] Pride amen glory to God thank you Lord
[1:20:38] yes servant
[1:20:40] Jonah it was there brothers and sisters
[1:20:43] glory to
[1:20:44] God there was
[1:20:46] something on the
[1:20:49] sea the cast a
[1:20:52] lot and Jonah said I'm the problem
[1:20:55] problem you can bind me and throw me in
[1:20:58] the water in the
[1:20:59] sea he was confident in the
[1:21:04] Lord you can ask yourself why Jonah
[1:21:06] asked that he can be
[1:21:10] bound but don't don't forget the the
[1:21:13] topic the purpose of God the purpose of
[1:21:16] God for
[1:21:18] Jonah Jonah had to go to
[1:21:21] n Jonah had to go to n
[1:21:24] they took Jonah they bound Jonah they
[1:21:28] cast him in the
[1:21:31] sea God is God of
[1:21:34] Miracle God is God of
[1:21:37] miracle and there was a there was a
[1:21:40] fish that swallow
[1:21:44] Jonah brought about prec very
[1:21:49] important and the the the the the the
[1:21:52] Fisher
[1:21:53] took the shock
[1:21:56] and at that time there that time there
[1:21:58] was an unbeliever that was
[1:22:00] there he said well the Bible is
[1:22:05] explaining there was the fish that
[1:22:07] swallow
[1:22:11] Jonah even a little uh piece of meat
[1:22:14] cannot go through
[1:22:16] this but I'm believer was saying it was
[1:22:19] true it was true
[1:22:21] right was
[1:22:23] there I cannot stay
[1:22:25] quiet I have to stand up for the
[1:22:28] word I came forward I said man sir
[1:22:33] there's something that you miss to
[1:22:35] see the Bible
[1:22:37] said the the fish that swallow
[1:22:41] Jonah it was a fish created by
[1:22:45] God it was a fish that was created right
[1:22:48] there brothers and
[1:22:51] sister nothing can stop the purpose of
[1:22:56] God for Jonah to go to
[1:23:00] n to Proclaim this
[1:23:04] message needed a special
[1:23:09] anointing he had to go away from
[1:23:12] people God has to prepare
[1:23:15] boat a
[1:23:17] boat that's SW Jonah and he going down
[1:23:21] in the bottom of the sea with Jonah

[1:23:44] of the fish and you start thinking about
[1:23:46] something he thought about
[1:23:49] prayer a prayer of
[1:23:51] Solomon when they were dedicating the
[1:23:53] temple
[1:23:54] when the Israel was in
[1:23:56] trouble when they turned their
[1:23:58] face oh to the
[1:24:01] temple the prayer

[1:24:09] naturally Bell of the fish there's no
[1:24:11] Oxygen
