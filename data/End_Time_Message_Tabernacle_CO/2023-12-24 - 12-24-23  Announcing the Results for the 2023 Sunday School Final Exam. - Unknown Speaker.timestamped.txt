[0:00] God bless you
[0:01] all
[0:03] um first of all i' like to say um we're
[0:07] very proud of all the students of our
[0:11] etm Sunday school
[0:13] class and we want to also thank the
[0:16] parents for their sacrifices for their
[0:19] time and dedication and letting the kids
[0:22] come to Sunday school so I would like to
[0:25] start off by a round of applause for

[0:57] four um to four and five and then we
[1:01] also have the kindergarten class and
[1:03] then we have the junior class and then

[1:09] like the Juniors and the seniors if they
[1:11] can step aside and let the little ones
[1:13] finish first and then we'll go by each
[1:16] class so you guys can step and stand on

[1:23] here and for that class we have Grace um
[1:27] who's been teaching them uh there's a
[1:30] lot of little ones but we kind of
[1:32] divided them by their age some are still
[1:36] in preschool and some are a little bit
[1:39] older so um if they can also project the
[1:43] test we did do a test for them and also
[1:47] they're going to do their recital so

[14:00] applause for
[14:01] [Applause]
[14:09] everyone so we're gonna go on to the
[14:19] test so as you could see up there I
[14:23] split it into two parts because it was
[14:26] two different classes between the
[14:27] kindergarten class class and the
[14:29] preschool class for the kindergarten
[14:32] class I had them do all 14
[14:35] questions and then for the preschool
[14:38] class I only had them answer five
[14:41] questions and then do the Lord's prayer
[14:45] prayer and um Ephesians
[14:49] 4:32 so they all did very well I've seen
[14:54] a lot of
[14:55] improvement so I'm really proud of all
[14:58] of them
[14:59] but we have
[15:01] some that did exceptional today so we
[15:05] want to give them awards for that so I'm
[15:10] going to start with the preschool
[15:19] class so for the preschool class we did
[15:24] five
[15:27] questions and the one who got four out
[15:32] of five was Bri star
[15:39] choa so not only did she do get four out
[15:43] of five for the questions but she also
[15:46] did the Lord's Prayer and Ephesians 4:32
[15:50] completely so if you could give her a
[15:52] round of applause for
[15:57] that
[16:00] and coming in second place for three out
[16:04] of five there was a tie between three
[16:07] people so it was Joe yoan and
[16:21] David
[16:26] so so we're going to do Ephesians
[16:29] 4:32 for a tiebreaker between
[16:33] them so I'm going to give them the mic
[16:36] and see how it
[16:44] goes
[16:47] [Music]
[16:57] fire
[17:10] Ephesians
[17:12] 432 and be kind and compassionate to one
[17:17] another
[17:19] forgiving just as in Christ God forgive
[17:25] you so it's going to go the second place
[17:29] prize will go to
[17:47] Joe so for my kindergarten class they
[17:52] also did very well very proud of them so
[17:56] for the first place
[17:59] there's also a tie we um between Jason
[18:04] Gad and Dave so if you can give them a
[18:07] round of
[18:10] applause so they had to answer out of 14
[18:15] questions and they got 11 out of 14
[18:19] right so that's really
[18:25] good yes and before I go to um give them
[18:30] to recite I want to also mention
[18:33] happiness and blessing who did also very
[18:37] well they got a 10 out of 14 so if you
[18:40] can give them CL for
[18:46] that okay so we're going to do a tie

[32:56] forward
[33:06] so for the senior
[33:08] class um I like to say good job to each
[33:11] and every one of you um it's definitely
[33:16] the toughest class because this is the
[33:18] age where sometimes they think they're
[33:20] too coold to be in Sunday
[33:22] school but um they're still here and I
[33:25] appreciate them a lot there's some who
[33:29] um still give their best in class and I
[33:32] would like to start by giving
[33:35] participation awards for those who
[33:37] really love participating in class um so
[33:40] the first one is going to go
[33:42] participation is going to go to goodness
[33:47] lubaki followed by Anna
[33:53] mavinga followed by
[33:55] buim
[33:59] oh and
[34:01] also uh n
[34:07] maishi oh well I have your award and
[34:10] then um it's probably over there uh for
[34:14] the next one we have good effort award
[34:17] so that is just for somebody who um
[34:20] definitely gives a little bit extra
[34:22] effort they may not always know the
[34:24] right answers they may not always um do
[34:27] all the homework but they definitely are
[34:30] trying to do their best and that award
[34:31] goes to chance
[34:37] maishi and then the last um award we're
[34:41] gonna call is the Christian character
[34:43] and attitude award this award I think we
[34:46] added recently with the teachers um
[34:49] because sometimes we realize that Sunday
[34:50] school is not really just about the
[34:51] brain about knowing the books of the
[34:53] Bible about knowing but it's also your
[34:55] attitude in class it's also your way
[34:57] that you treat your peers around you and
[35:00] this um award is going to go to Deborah
[35:09] chiango uh throughout the year we had a
[35:12] test um it was about roughly 90
[35:16] questions um it was about five-page test
[35:21] it was a lot to memorize throughout the
[35:24] year uh I think they're going to project
[35:26] it and I'm going to to get the test
[35:35] um while she hands out the test I just
[35:39] want to say um for me it was a huge
[35:42] experience teaching to you or I should
[35:45] say learning from you because I learned
[35:46] a lot from you um I never went to Sunday
[35:50] school so it's a huge experience for me
[35:53] to learn by you and um I want to to
[35:57] thank you for um being patience with me
[36:01] and also thank the parents for bringing
[36:03] them um I want to encourage you again
[36:07] like I said on um on Thanksgiving um to
[36:12] take the time to talk to your kids
[36:14] they're great they have um an amazing
[36:19] potential and talent but I think we can
[36:23] all improve that um if you take the time
[36:26] to talk to them chat with them maybe
[36:29] play a game or something and start to
[36:32] get to know them better um they're great
[36:35] I'm very proud of all of them um some do
[36:38] better but sometimes um that has a lot
[36:42] to do with the work of the parents at
[36:45] home so um encourage that and
[36:55] congratulations
[36:57] uh so as we said the test
[37:00] um composed of about 90 questions about
[37:05] everything we learned throughout the
[37:06] year uh but before I give the results um
[37:09] I would like um couple students to say
[37:12] because they did learn the seven
[37:14] Messengers The Seven Church ages and
[37:17] also the seven uh virtues or the seven
[37:21] steps of the pyramid so that's what
[37:24] we're going to start with recitals for
[37:25] this class because they're a little bit
[37:27] older so that's where we're going to
[37:29] start and then right after we're going
[37:30] to give the results of the test so I'm
[37:32] going to start with Joshua and go down
[37:33] that
[37:41] way um for the seven messages it's uh
[37:45] Paul um
[37:47] irius um then it's Martin then it's
[37:51] Columba uh after Columba it's Luther
[37:54] Wesley then it's brother grantom and for
[37:58] the Seven Virtues it's um Faith
[38:03] knowledge um
[38:08] virtue virtue Holiness Temperance
