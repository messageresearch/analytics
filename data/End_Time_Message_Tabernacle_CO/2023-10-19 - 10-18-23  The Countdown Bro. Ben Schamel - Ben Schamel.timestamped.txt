[45:29] smile to my
[45:34] face because it doesn't matter where you
[45:38] are it doesn't matter where you've
[45:41] been but we serve a Great and Mighty
[45:45] God the man that wrote that song was a
[45:47] slave
[45:50] trader a
[45:54] fornicator a
[45:57] cheater but he wrote Amazing
[46:02] Grace we're just so happy to be here
[46:05] with you this
[46:05] [Music]
[46:07] even we just want to say thank you to
[46:09] brother
[46:11] f for giving us the
[46:14] opportunity amen we're just very blessed
[46:17] and we don't take these things
[46:21] lightly so we just have a small
[46:24] thought as you know I'm not a a deep
[46:27] [Music]
[46:29] preacher we just take what the message
[46:31] says and remind you what he
[46:35] said and as long as we stay with the
[46:38] message we know that we're on
[46:42] track amen so if you have your
[46:44] scriptures and you would turn with me to
[46:46] Hebrews chapter
[46:50] 11 very familiar scripture
[46:54] here brother Bram takes this section of
[46:57] scripture many different
[47:04] ways Hebrews chapter
[47:08] 11 verses 1 two and
[47:13] three the scripture says now Faith is
[47:15] the substance of things hoped for the
[47:18] evidence of go ahead go ahead for by it
[47:23] the elders obtained a good report
[47:26] through faith we understand that the
[47:28] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[47:32] that things which are seen were not made
[47:35] of things which do appear
[47:44] [Music]
[47:54] amen
[47:57] Amen Let bow our
[48:00] heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[48:03] we just come before you yet once more
[48:06] Lord Lord just asking that you would be
[48:08] with us just this once
[48:11] more Lord we just ask that you would
[48:13] come down in the service
[48:16] tonight Lord that you would just make
[48:18] yourself real to us
[48:20] tonight Lord our desire is to draw
[48:23] closer to
[48:24] you
[48:26] even though the world is against
[48:29] us Lord we've set aside this time to
[48:31] come and to study your
[48:35] word to Worship
[48:38] You So Lord we just ask that you would
[48:40] prepare our hearts for the
[48:43] word Lord that I might be able to get
[48:45] myself out of the
[48:48] way that I wouldn't preach any of my
[48:51] thoughts but that as a congregation we
[48:54] might be able to find the channel of of
[48:55] the holy
[48:59] spirit because Lord we still believe
[49:01] that you are
[49:03] real and we believe that you are
[49:05] here so Lord if we could just get into
[49:08] the channel of the Holy
[49:14] Ghost Lord we believe we can
[49:17] grow we just be with you amen amen amen
[49:21] you may be
[49:23] seated so with this little scripture
[49:25] reading
[49:25] [Music]
[49:26] here brother brandham takes these three
[49:29] verses and he preaches the
[49:32] [Music]
[49:33] countdown and if I could this evening
[49:35] just take the same title he
[49:39] brought and title it the
[49:43] countdown and brother brandham just
[49:46] points out how we can look at the world
[49:48] and see where we're
[49:51] at and I just believe that today more
[49:54] than any other
[49:57] day if we're to look out at the world
[50:00] and see where we're
[50:02] at then we can see that the Rapture is
[50:05] getting
[50:07] close the bride is getting herself
[50:11] ready if the world is getting themselves
[50:16] [Music]
[50:17] ready then that means that the church is
[50:19] getting herself
[50:22] ready brother Bram said if we want to
[50:24] know what time it is
[50:28] then all we have to do is look at
[50:31] Israel and we can see where she's
[50:35] at so can we see where we're
[50:38] at amen amen so brother brandham tells
[50:42] us that the natural types the
[50:47] spiritual and growing up in the
[50:51] message I know this is a struggle for me
[50:56] that so many times we hear these idioms
[50:59] or these sayings that brother Bram would
[51:02] say and they become so common to us that
[51:06] we don't know what they really
[51:12] mean but brother brandham says that the
[51:14] natural types the
[51:19] spiritual amen we can look at into
[51:24] nature and it's fall
[51:31] time and the the leaves are changing
[51:36] colors what the leaves that were green
[51:39] just a couple weeks
[51:42] ago now they're red and orange and
[51:46] yellow
[51:47] right and it is that natural
[51:52] thing is testifying of a spiritual
[51:57] happening he says the natural types the
[52:02] spiritual but we have to stay with God's
[52:04] provided
[52:07] way there was that story of where
[52:09] brother Brenham went to meet with the uh
[52:11] the
[52:15] Infidel and he gets to talking to
[52:18] him and he says I am an old man and I've
[52:21] never seen
[52:24] God
[52:26] he'd been looking through nature looking
[52:28] for
[52:31] God but he had never seen God he
[52:35] thought but but then when when the
[52:37] prophet comes on the
[52:40] scene and he takes a tree that's been
[52:42] there for 40
[52:45] years a tree that this man himself had
[52:51] planted and he begins to explain to him
[52:53] the ways of God
[52:58] and he begins to preach to him how the
[53:00] natural types the
[53:04] spiritual and he says there is some
[53:07] intelligence
[53:09] somewhere that is inside of that
[53:12] tree that is telling that
[53:15] tree that it is time to take the sap
[53:18] from the
[53:20] branches that it's time to take the sap
[53:22] from the
[53:24] leaves
[53:25] it's time to take that life and hide it
[53:27] down in the
[53:30] roofs and we can see that happening
[53:32] right
[53:33] now the nights are getting
[53:37] colder we still haven't had a
[53:42] frost so what intelligence is telling
[53:45] all of those
[53:48] trees that it is time to take that life
[53:50] and hide it down in the
[53:53] roof there is some
[53:57] intelligence and brother brandham says
[54:00] because because the gentleman says
[54:01] that's just
[54:05] nature that's just
[54:07] nature it just happens he says if that's
[54:10] just
[54:13] nature then take a a bucket of
[54:17] water you set it on a wood
[54:21] post and nature should take that water
[54:24] down into the ground
[54:26] back up in
[54:35] the
[54:37] right but there is some intelligence
[54:42] somewhere see if you're looking for God
[54:44] then you'll find
[54:46] God and a man who was once an
[54:51] Infidel when a prophet comes on the
[54:54] scene and he begins to reveal that the
[54:57] natural types the
[55:01] spiritual a man that once denied God
[55:08] existed he he could no longer deny that
[55:11] God
[55:13] existed amen because
[55:16] science who does not know
[55:19] God still testifies of
[55:24] God why do you think that the world
[55:26] comes against science so
[55:30] much as young children they're
[55:32] indoctrinating the young kids in public
[55:33] schools saying evolution is
[55:38] true they're trying to replace God with
[55:41] all this
[55:44] time millions of years
[55:47] ago there was nothing and then something
[55:53] exploded and cre created everything
[55:55] that's
[55:58] here
[56:02] really when you step back and think of
[56:05] that it sounds like just a silly fairy
[56:12] tale but brother brandham said the
[56:14] natural types the
[56:18] spiritual so if there's an intelligence
[56:21] inside of that tree telling
[56:23] them that there is a change
[56:27] coming that that tree needs to prepare
[56:32] itself we had a prophet in this
[56:35] age that the voice of God spoke
[56:38] through and that Divine
[56:42] intelligence came down to tell his
[56:44] little
[56:46] bride that there is a change
[56:48] coming the countdown is counting
[56:52] down it's time for a change
[56:55] we need to get ourselves
[56:57] ready just like those
[57:00] trees because we're getting ready for a
[57:03] Rapture we're not going to stay here
[57:06] forever just like the life that's in the
[57:09] tree when it goes
[57:11] down when spring times
[57:14] comes that life is going to come back up
[57:17] again huah amen and we believe that
[57:20] there's a Resurrection
[57:23] coming it's the same
[57:27] intelligence and so many times we just
[57:29] take it
[57:31] lightly we just hear natural types the
[57:35] spiritual and we say amen and we move
[57:37] on and we don't really think of the
[57:40] depth of what brother brandham is
[57:45] saying another one that he says he says
[57:47] you have to have the mechanics and the
[57:52] Dynamics do we have any mechanics
[57:57] people that have studied
[58:00] mechanics then you'll like
[58:04] tonight brother brandom says and once
[58:06] more
[58:09] Lord he says that's where Satan got
[58:14] in to make it all mechanics and no
[58:21] Dynamics he says back all the Dynamics
[58:24] and no
[58:28] mechanics see you've got to put it
[58:33] together but we've got to come back with
[58:35] the word to feed this
[58:40] machine we can't feed it on
[58:43] Creed it won't
[58:46] burn it chokes
[58:51] up it won't burn it chokes up the flu
[59:00] it will not
[59:03] burn it was it was made for the word of
[59:09] God man shall not live by bread
[59:12] alone but by some of the words of God
[59:19] no by every
[59:23] word not just part of
[59:26] it every word that proceeds out of the
[59:29] mouth of
[59:31] [Music]
[59:32] God Amen that means when we're reading
[59:34] our
[59:35] scriptures we need to study every
[59:41] word amen because this word is a lot
[59:43] more than what it we when we take it at
[59:45] face
[59:49] value but we need the
[59:51] mechanics and we need the Dynamics
[59:57] so let me let me draw
[59:59] this can I use the
[1:00:02] board I'm gonna draw for
[1:00:05] you a diagram of an
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:14] engine and you that work in uh or no
[1:00:18] Machinery you know this very
[1:00:22] well you know
[1:00:27] okay fuel comes into an engine right
[1:00:33] here and then we have a
[1:00:36] cylinder there's four stages of the
[1:00:38] cylinder that will come
[1:00:40] into but this is what they call the
[1:00:43] piston and this is the
[1:00:48] cylinder and what happens inside the
[1:00:50] cylinder makes all the
[1:00:53] difference
[1:00:56] because you see brother brandom
[1:00:58] said for thousands of years mankind had
[1:01:01] gone with the horse and
[1:01:05] buggy gone with a horse and buggy and
[1:01:08] and and then
[1:01:13] recently they had a scientific
[1:01:19] breakthrough okay and when we hear
[1:01:21] scientific
[1:01:23] breakthrough that's the natural term for
[1:01:30] Revelation so the natural types of
[1:01:32] spiritual
[1:01:34] right breakthrough
[1:01:37] natural Revelation
[1:01:40] spiritual are you with me so
[1:01:43] far so we went thousands and thousands
[1:01:45] of years with
[1:01:49] horses and
[1:01:53] CS the
[1:01:55] and walking from place to
[1:01:58] place and then over the last couple
[1:02:00] hundred
[1:02:02] years all of a sudden we go to
[1:02:05] cars and then we go to
[1:02:07] airplanes and now we go to
[1:02:11] spaceships that's what they call a
[1:02:15] breakthrough because mankind came
[1:02:17] through a mechanical
[1:02:20] breakthrough all of these other things
[1:02:22] could come to pass
[1:02:25] then they could have all of these other
[1:02:26] inventions built off of this one
[1:02:30] thing and that's what happens when you
[1:02:32] begin to read this
[1:02:35] message and when God begins to start
[1:02:37] unfolding this
[1:02:40] Revelation that he's not a god of the
[1:02:43] past but God is just as real
[1:02:46] today as he was when he was hanging on
[1:02:48] the
[1:02:50] cross and that the days of Miracles have
[1:02:52] not passed
[1:02:55] the days of Miracles are
[1:02:58] now amen then this
[1:03:01] Revelation this
[1:03:04] breakthrough will begin to make this
[1:03:07] this this Bible a brand new book to
[1:03:11] you and then all of these other
[1:03:12] Revelations will begin to
[1:03:15] follow but as long as Satan can tell you
[1:03:18] that this is is a a word for some other
[1:03:23] age as long as he could tell you that
[1:03:25] the third poll is just for brother
[1:03:28] Bram or this message was just 60 years
[1:03:33] ago then he's already got
[1:03:36] you because we aren't applying the word
[1:03:38] to ourselves
[1:03:41] today and that's where we need to get
[1:03:43] to every time we come to
[1:03:46] church we have to be thinking to
[1:03:49] ourselves how can I apply this word to
[1:03:52] me today right now
[1:03:56] amen not how can I have a Revival some
[1:03:59] time in the
[1:04:02] future not how I can Pitchfork this to
[1:04:06] somebody
[1:04:09] else but what is God trying to tell me
[1:04:12] right
[1:04:15] now because when we come to
[1:04:17] church as Believers we
[1:04:20] believe that this is our time to commune
[1:04:23] with God
[1:04:26] and maybe you see a
[1:04:28] face the preacher is up here
[1:04:31] preaching but it is our job to get
[1:04:34] ourselves out of the
[1:04:36] way so we can get into the channel of
[1:04:38] the holy
[1:04:40] spirit that God can lead guide and
[1:04:42] direct
[1:04:44] us so God can communicate what he
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:49] wants amen we're not here to to listen
[1:04:53] to me
[1:04:56] I sure hope not that you're not here to
[1:04:58] listen to
[1:05:00] me I don't have anything to
[1:05:02] say
[1:05:04] Amen but if God has anything to say to
[1:05:08] you and I can get myself out of the
[1:05:11] way then great things can
[1:05:15] happen then Faith Can Build because then
[1:05:18] your faith is not built on a
[1:05:21] human but our faith is built on Christ
[1:05:26] and when the revelation of Faith
[1:05:29] strikes then God can do the
[1:05:33] miraculous Amen brother brandham was
[1:05:35] preaching one
[1:05:36] time and he said that you guys don't
[1:05:39] believe in
[1:05:40] miracles he said you'll never see a
[1:05:43] miracle until you become a miracle
[1:05:47] yourself and that Miracle happens when
[1:05:50] God can take a
[1:05:52] sinner he can take a for
[1:05:54] fornicator when he could take a traitor
[1:05:58] when when he could take a
[1:05:59] cheater when he could take a sinner and
[1:06:02] he can miraculously change him into
[1:06:06] a when he can change him into a
[1:06:09] Christian when he can change him into a
[1:06:11] son or daughter of
[1:06:13] God and when you experience becoming a
[1:06:18] miracle that's when you can see the
[1:06:20] miracles
[1:06:22] happen because people kept asking
[1:06:25] him if God is here where are all the
[1:06:29] Miracles if God's working in our church
[1:06:31] brother
[1:06:34] fost why don't we see all these Miracles
[1:06:38] happening Brother Bram said one time he
[1:06:40] said take a step of
[1:06:43] Faith he said if you're blind wave your
[1:06:46] hand in front of your face and see what
[1:06:48] God will
[1:06:53] do
[1:06:55] that's a step of
[1:06:57] Faith
[1:06:59] blind you can't see but you're taking
[1:07:03] God out his
[1:07:05] word you can't see
[1:07:08] nothing he said wave your hand in front
[1:07:10] of your
[1:07:12] face and see what God will
[1:07:15] do
[1:07:18] ameno yes sir and that's just one line
[1:07:20] in one
[1:07:22] tape
[1:07:24] that ought to give us enough faith
[1:07:25] brother fosten to to go
[1:07:28] down and if we're
[1:07:31] blind that we would receive our
[1:07:34] sight amen he said if you're
[1:07:38] crippled you can't walk
[1:07:41] anywhere he said stand
[1:07:43] up and see what God will
[1:07:47] do am see what God will
[1:07:50] do I don't know what your situation is
[1:07:52] tonight
[1:07:54] but all I can say is what the prophet
[1:07:57] said and let's take a step of
[1:08:00] faith and see what God will
[1:08:02] do we're taking God out of his
[1:08:05] word this isn't a message for some other
[1:08:09] age I don't believe that that that that
[1:08:12] that that
[1:08:13] paragraph that brother brandham
[1:08:16] preached that was recorded
[1:08:19] audibly that was recorded on
[1:08:22] paper for me me to listen
[1:08:25] to for me to read was for somebody else
[1:08:28] in
[1:08:30] 1962 but I believe that the prophet of
[1:08:34] God came and he preached that for me
[1:08:40] today tonight for my
[1:08:43] situation so I can say God this is my
[1:08:47] situation
[1:08:48] tonight I'm waving my hand in front of
[1:08:51] my face and I'm going to see what your
[1:08:53] going to
[1:08:54] do not because I deserve it not because
[1:08:58] I can earn
[1:08:59] it because you are God and you are
[1:09:04] able
[1:09:06] am praise
[1:09:10] God but we need the mechanics and the
[1:09:15] Dynamics and US message
[1:09:18] Believers we got the mechanics down
[1:09:21] P mechan mechanic down
[1:09:29] P we know the
[1:09:33] mechanics I've got to wear a dress this
[1:09:35] long or brother fost is gonna get mad at
[1:09:45] me but they always want to push it huh
[1:09:51] brother brother brother brand starts
[1:09:53] preaching one
[1:09:55] time and there's this man who wants to
[1:09:57] go across the dangerous mountain
[1:10:05] range this is in the days of the horse
[1:10:07] and and and
[1:10:12] buggy and there were three three taxi
[1:10:14] drivers with these horse and
[1:10:19] Buggies and he's one of the first one
[1:10:21] pipes
[1:10:22] up
[1:10:24] he said I am such a good
[1:10:27] driver I can run my horse full speed
[1:10:31] around that
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:35] mountain get that cart within six in of
[1:10:39] the
[1:10:41] edge and I can make it all the way
[1:10:44] around the
[1:10:47] mountain well the second
[1:10:49] one he goes well I can run my horses
[1:10:53] with within three in of the
[1:11:03] edge all the way around the
[1:11:08] mountain the third
[1:11:10] man he says well what about
[1:11:14] you he says well I I don't
[1:11:17] know I just like to go real
[1:11:21] slow and I don't like to hug the The
[1:11:27] Edge but I want to hug the mountain side
[1:11:29] as close as I
[1:11:32] can all the way
[1:11:36] around just so I make sure I make it
[1:11:39] there
[1:11:43] safely well which one do you think the
[1:11:45] gentleman
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:48] took so don't push the
[1:11:52] edge let's not see how how high our
[1:11:55] skirts can go before we get past the
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:05] edge simple
[1:12:08] right let's just get there
[1:12:11] safe let me just ER on the side of
[1:12:18] God but scientific things type the
[1:12:21] spiritual things uh
[1:12:26] and brother Bram begins to
[1:12:28] say he says that the horse and buggy was
[1:12:32] an age for a long
[1:12:35] time and then the right Brothers come up
[1:12:38] with a
[1:12:41] breakthrough and they come to a
[1:12:43] Pentecostal
[1:12:46] age here's what's
[1:12:49] interesting I believe the wri brothers
[1:12:51] had their first flight in 1906
[1:12:58] 1906 I believe
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:01] somewhere brother Bram comes out and
[1:13:04] says that the right
[1:13:07] Brothers had a natural
[1:13:13] happening of a spiritual
[1:13:17] type within two
[1:13:21] years of when the right brother had
[1:13:23] their first
[1:13:26] flight was when the isusa Street Revival
[1:13:31] happened who could have typed those
[1:13:33] together except
[1:13:36] for amen and you want to say the
[1:13:38] prophet's not
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:40] true but he said we're we're we're we're
[1:13:44] getting off the ground
[1:13:47] now and we're we're reaching this
[1:13:49] Pentecostal
[1:13:51] age our feet have now left the ground
[1:13:54] we're getting up into the heavens
[1:13:57] now
[1:13:59] amen here's what another interesting
[1:14:03] thing
[1:14:06] 1961 is when the first man went to
[1:14:11] space within two years the seals
[1:14:16] break and brother brandom says I I won't
[1:14:19] call you church
[1:14:21] anymore I will call you bride so that
[1:14:24] you might
[1:14:26] understand it's a natural happening of a
[1:14:29] spiritual
[1:14:31] type hallelujah amen and without this
[1:14:34] message where would we
[1:14:36] be we have to cling to what the prophet
[1:14:38] is telling
[1:14:39] us and the more we study
[1:14:42] it the more Revelation he'll give to
[1:14:45] you and the more that you can study
[1:14:48] it the more that he'll give to
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:54] so because my little picture is not big
[1:14:59] enough this is how an engine cylinder
[1:15:05] works this little plate
[1:15:08] here it moves up and
[1:15:16] down the first step is called
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:22] intake
[1:15:24] intake when the fuel comes
[1:15:26] in and this little plate will be down
[1:15:30] here and then there's compression and it
[1:15:32] brings the plate up
[1:15:36] here it gets really
[1:15:39] tight a spark hits
[1:15:42] it and it
[1:15:44] explodes and it shoots straight back
[1:15:50] down uh so compression
[1:15:57] and I'm not good at writing
[1:16:00] backwards and then
[1:16:03] expansion and then
[1:16:07] exhaust
[1:16:11] ex and that's when the fumes come back
[1:16:16] out
[1:16:18] okay that's how an engine
[1:16:22] works when you intake the word of
[1:16:27] God you see where we're going with
[1:16:30] this amen because the natural types the
[1:16:35] spiritual if you want to grow closer to
[1:16:38] God all you have to do is look for
[1:16:43] God everything speaks of
[1:16:46] him we're doing flight lessons and I'm
[1:16:49] just thinking
[1:16:52] oh
[1:16:55] this is just how God
[1:16:57] works because everything will
[1:17:01] testify amen so then compression
[1:17:05] happens you begin to meditate on that
[1:17:07] word of
[1:17:09] God and then you get the mechanics and
[1:17:12] the Dynamics
[1:17:14] together and that little spark
[1:17:17] comes and that's what drives the engine
[1:17:22] around
[1:17:25] is that that is is that explosion that
[1:17:29] happens now brother Bram says that
[1:17:31] there's always a phase of
[1:17:34] three
[1:17:37] justification
[1:17:38] sanctification filling of the Holy
[1:17:42] Spirit and we hear that all the
[1:17:45] time and we hear when when brother
[1:17:47] brandham says that you could have the
[1:17:49] Holy Spirit every day of your life and
[1:17:50] go to
[1:17:52] hell and that's very confusing
[1:17:58] for and that's in the the message
[1:18:03] leadership he says many of you think I
[1:18:06] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:18:07] going to
[1:18:11] heaven he says that don't mean one thing
[1:18:14] that you're going to
[1:18:16] heaven you can have the baptism of the
[1:18:18] Holy Ghost every hour of your life and
[1:18:20] still be lost and go to
[1:18:21] hell
[1:18:25] he says that's what the Bible says
[1:18:27] exactly
[1:18:29] right so if if we have this this is my
[1:18:31] little
[1:18:33] cylinder and I have blown the top of
[1:18:36] this off before but we won't do it
[1:18:42] tonight this is a replica of what a
[1:18:44] cylinder is
[1:18:48] like so this is the
[1:18:51] mechanics and the dynamic is the fuel
[1:18:55] right well if I just put this
[1:18:59] here and then I pour gas on top of
[1:19:04] this and I light it on fire guess
[1:19:06] what'll
[1:19:09] happen it go
[1:19:11] bang no it actually
[1:19:16] won't it
[1:19:18] won't if I light the gas on
[1:19:21] fire
[1:19:24] then there will be a yellow flame about
[1:19:25] that
[1:19:30] tall and it'll burn until the fuel is
[1:19:35] gone and then the cylinder will be the
[1:19:38] same as it was
[1:19:43] before that's what we call an anointing
[1:19:45] of the Holy
[1:19:50] Spirit right and that's what many
[1:19:53] children at a youth camp
[1:19:57] experience they experience an anointing
[1:20:00] of the Holy
[1:20:02] Spirit it creates a
[1:20:04] fire they're very
[1:20:07] excited but they don't continue
[1:20:10] on and then the fire goes
[1:20:12] away and they remain the same as they
[1:20:14] were before
[1:20:18] came same thing when we come to
[1:20:20] church we roll into church on Sunday
[1:20:24] morning brother Richard preaches an
[1:20:26] amazing sermon on
[1:20:29] Sunday and we walk out those back doors
[1:20:31] going I am somebody
[1:20:33] else I am a changed
[1:20:36] person because we only got an anointing
[1:20:38] instead of a a filling and a
[1:20:42] ceiling when the fire goes away we
[1:20:45] remain the
[1:20:48] same but here's what's interesting about
[1:20:50] a gas cylinder
[1:20:55] is I can fill the cylinder with
[1:20:59] gas and if I light it on
[1:21:02] fire then what
[1:21:06] happens bang
[1:21:09] right no no it does the same
[1:21:15] thing here's what's interesting about a
[1:21:19] cylinder if I put this cap
[1:21:21] on
[1:21:24] and I seal
[1:21:27] it then something
[1:21:32] changes but that gas that
[1:21:36] petroleum the same gas that was on
[1:21:41] top I put it inside and seal
[1:21:47] it something
[1:21:50] happens and what happens is that liquid
[1:21:55] changes and then it's no longer a liquid
[1:21:58] but it turns into a
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:02] gas and so instead of just having an
[1:22:04] anointing on a part of the
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:10] cylinder the inside of the cylinder is
[1:22:13] full of
[1:22:16] gas there are gas fumes inside of it
[1:22:19] that have filled up every crack
[1:22:25] every aspect on the inside is full of
[1:22:27] that
[1:22:30] gas there's no area in your life that
[1:22:33] the Holy Spirit isn't
[1:22:37] infiltrating and you have been
[1:22:40] sealed now because if we took that
[1:22:44] petroleum and we light it on
[1:22:46] fire is that little fire going to make
[1:22:49] your car go 60 mil an
[1:22:51] hour
[1:22:57] is that little fire going to put an
[1:22:58] airplane in the
[1:23:03] sky but we take the same
[1:23:06] cylinder we take the same
[1:23:08] Fuel and we we seal it inside a
[1:23:14] vessel then when I add the
[1:23:18] spark then it creates an
[1:23:21] explosion
[1:23:23] and the reason I'm not going to
[1:23:24] demonstrate it for you
[1:23:27] tonight is that little innocent
[1:23:31] fire if I took that same Fuel and put it
[1:23:34] on the
[1:23:36] inside and I I lit the this little hole
[1:23:38] in the
[1:23:42] bottom it would put a big dent in the
[1:23:48] ceiling because it would blow this lid
[1:23:56] are you catching what I'm
[1:24:00] saying we're not just Desiring a a
[1:24:04] falling of the Holy Spirit like an an
[1:24:09] anointing but our desire is to be filled
[1:24:13] with the holy
[1:24:15] spirit because then when we are sealed
[1:24:17] with the Holy
[1:24:19] Spirit and we get the mechanics and the
[1:24:24] Dynamics then we can have
[1:24:29] something so we intake the word of
[1:24:32] God we meditate on the word of
[1:24:35] God God gives us the spark of
[1:24:38] Revelation then the last one is the
[1:24:40] exhaust you can't help but to keep it
[1:24:42] inside
[1:24:48] there you would
[1:24:51] explod you have to share it with
[1:24:56] somebody the Bible says that the people
[1:24:59] in Jerusalem could
[1:25:01] tell that the disciples had been with
[1:25:04] Jesus because they were in the exhaust
[1:25:09] phas they were sharing the
[1:25:14] gospel let me ask you
[1:25:16] this if you're in the exhaust phase and
[1:25:19] sharing the
[1:25:21] gospel
[1:25:24] then can you at the same time be ashamed
[1:25:26] of the
[1:25:30] Gospel no because you are sharing
[1:25:32] something that is already with inside of
[1:25:36] you that is bubbling up and
[1:25:40] over and you can't help to keep it
[1:25:45] inside but you have to
[1:25:48] explode you have to share this message
[1:25:50] with somebody
[1:25:53] and what is going to do that just the
[1:25:56] mechanic just having long hair or or
[1:25:59] long
[1:26:01] dress one preacher said the message
[1:26:06] girls they've got it
[1:26:09] down they've got the long
[1:26:12] skirts the long
[1:26:15] hair long face he's on the long uh
[1:26:21] fast
[1:26:23] we were up at brother John Andy a couple
[1:26:25] weeks
[1:26:28] ago and we were
[1:26:31] talking and he said there's some
[1:26:34] churches that if you were going to come
[1:26:36] in and haul out if somebody
[1:26:39] died and the Medics come rushing in to
[1:26:42] find the dead
[1:26:46] person he said sometimes they'll haul
[1:26:49] out 16 people before they find the right
[1:26:51] one
[1:26:56] because our churches are just so
[1:27:00] quiet they can't tell which one the Dead
[1:27:02] one
[1:27:06] is that's having mechanics and no
[1:27:11] Dynamics but if you have the the the
[1:27:14] Dynamics with no
[1:27:17] mechanics then it doesn't
[1:27:20] work so we need both to come
[1:27:24] together and the prophet came to show us
[1:27:30] how are you with me so
[1:27:33] faren and I've been trying to take this
[1:27:35] a little bit slow and I'm I'm already
[1:27:36] almost past my
[1:27:38] time horse and buggy cars
[1:27:46] airplane now here's where brother bam
[1:27:48] says it in the
[1:27:51] countdown
[1:27:52] he says now the right Brothers through
[1:27:54] their
[1:27:59] achievement they were able to take
[1:28:01] science and pattern something here on
[1:28:05] Earth to show that there was a great
[1:28:07] spiritual thing fixing to
[1:28:10] happen within two
[1:28:14] years within two
[1:28:19] years and I'm going to have to skip some
[1:28:21] of these
[1:28:23] the next
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:32] quote brother Bram says questions and
[1:28:36] answers
[1:28:37] 59 he said if you were to go out here
[1:28:39] into this field in the middle of the
[1:28:45] dark he says oh great
[1:28:48] electricity electric I know you're in
[1:28:51] the field
[1:28:54] and now and now I'm lost I don't know
[1:28:56] where I'm
[1:28:58] going give light so I can see how to
[1:29:02] walk there's enough electricity to light
[1:29:05] up the
[1:29:08] field that's true yes
[1:29:11] sir there's enough electricity in this
[1:29:13] room to light
[1:29:18] it without even them
[1:29:20] lights without that but you have to
[1:29:24] govern
[1:29:25] it now you might
[1:29:28] scream tell that you can't scream no
[1:29:31] more it never light it
[1:29:34] up but if you work according to the laws
[1:29:37] of
[1:29:40] electricity then you'll get
[1:29:43] light and then he goes on to say verse
[1:29:50] 38
[1:29:52] is my it's in my 38 he says well that's
[1:29:55] the same
[1:29:57] way that it is by
[1:30:00] God God is the great creator of heavens
[1:30:03] and
[1:30:05] earth he's the same yesterday today and
[1:30:09] forever he is still
[1:30:12] God but he only works as you follow his
[1:30:16] laws and
[1:30:20] instructions
[1:30:23] amen amen as long as we're following the
[1:30:27] laws of
[1:30:30] God as long as we're following
[1:30:34] him then we can have his
[1:30:38] results am but so many times we're going
[1:30:41] where are the
[1:30:43] Miracles when the scripture says the
[1:30:45] signs and wonders follow them that
[1:30:48] believe and we're not believing and then
[1:30:52] we try to blame
[1:30:54] God Amen but brother random says we're
[1:30:58] finally coming to an
[1:31:01] astronaut
[1:31:05] amen amenah amen yes sir we're coming to
[1:31:09] an astronaut
[1:31:12] age an age where we're not only getting
[1:31:15] off the
[1:31:17] ground but we are completely clearing
[1:31:20] the atmosphere
[1:31:24] we going to another
[1:31:27] Land one not made by
[1:31:33] hands but there's a
[1:31:35] countdown and the world's countdown
[1:31:37] starts with
[1:31:39] 10 and brother brand says it goes
[1:31:42] 109876 5 4 3 2 1
[1:31:47] Z but he but brother random said that is
[1:31:49] the world's countdown
[1:31:53] but they have it
[1:31:57] backwards because God's countdown starts
[1:31:59] at
[1:32:01] one and it goes to
[1:32:04] seven amen it goes first
[1:32:08] church with
[1:32:10] Paul and then it goes second
[1:32:13] Church Third Church fourth Church fifth
[1:32:17] Church age sixth Church age seventh
[1:32:20] Church age
[1:32:22] lift
[1:32:24] off I'm telling you it's time for lift
[1:32:26] off
[1:32:27] church we can see where we're
[1:32:30] at the countdown is here it's time that
[1:32:34] we lift
[1:32:36] off and what's the first thing that
[1:32:38] happens when the clock strike
[1:32:43] zero the engines begin to
[1:32:50] fire gas engine will get an airplane in
[1:32:53] the
[1:32:57] sky I'm telling you this rocket isn't
[1:33:00] run by a gas
[1:33:05] engine it's run by an atomic
[1:33:09] power it's run by something so far
[1:33:12] greater than what Pentecost
[1:33:15] has something so much greater than what
[1:33:18] happened on isusa
[1:33:20] Street
[1:33:22] something greater than what got all of
[1:33:24] them
[1:33:26] shouting something
[1:33:28] greater going to lift the bride off of
[1:33:31] this
[1:33:32] Earth it's going to make us have a body
[1:33:35] change something
[1:33:37] greater but you want to just sit there
[1:33:39] in
[1:33:43] church sir oh brother fost was preaching
[1:33:45] about my hair
[1:33:50] extensions I need to pick up on the boys
[1:33:56] too we can't just pick on the
[1:33:59] ladies but boys need to be
[1:34:03] men enough of those little skinny
[1:34:13] pants it's time that we grow
[1:34:16] up well you think the girls out in the
[1:34:18] world think it's
[1:34:20] cute
[1:34:23] I want my hair to look a certain
[1:34:26] way I want to put highlight tips in
[1:34:31] it oh I want to wear the flashiest
[1:34:33] clothes at
[1:34:36] church I want I want to sing a special
[1:34:38] and wave this this finger is not got to
[1:34:45] ring praise the Lord praise the
[1:34:49] Lord sing
[1:34:52] the countdown is
[1:34:54] here it's Blast Off
[1:34:58] time and the first thing that
[1:35:00] happens when rocket begins to to to go
[1:35:06] off you start hearing
[1:35:11] up yes
[1:35:14] sir well the Clock Struck
[1:35:18] zero Z brother random went off the scene
[1:35:24] what have we been doing this whole
[1:35:26] time the rocket hasn't
[1:35:30] moved but all I hear is
[1:35:35] a that's the rocket getting
[1:35:39] prepared bride that's getting
[1:35:42] prepared down the world can only hear
[1:35:46] them and I guarantee you they hear it in
[1:35:50] hell
[1:35:51] Satan and his angels hear
[1:35:54] the what is that that's the bride
[1:35:57] getting herself
[1:35:59] ready she's getting herself ready for a
[1:36:02] liftoff she's not staying here on the
[1:36:04] ground she's not staying here with all
[1:36:06] these worldly
[1:36:07] things but she's taking off to
[1:36:11] glory and you know the great thing about
[1:36:13] a
[1:36:15] rocket you see a horse and
[1:36:17] buggy an
[1:36:19] airplane a car
[1:36:22] they all have a pilot
[1:36:24] inside see the thing about a rocket is
[1:36:26] totally
[1:36:29] different the astronauts are just along
[1:36:31] for the
[1:36:37] ride it's not
[1:36:40] I but
[1:36:42] Christ amen hallelujah amen but it is
[1:36:46] Guided by a tower
[1:36:50] somewhere
[1:36:51] we are Guided by a tower
[1:36:55] somewh the greatest message that's ever
[1:36:58] hit the face of
[1:37:01] the our
[1:37:04] age Atomic
[1:37:08] power am that's guiding
[1:37:12] you and brother brandom said that radar
[1:37:14] is
[1:37:15] prayer you want to see where the church
[1:37:17] is
[1:37:19] going listen to their prayer
[1:37:22] next time you're
[1:37:25] praying listen to your where you're at
[1:37:28] with
[1:37:29] god listen to your
[1:37:31] prayers Lord give me
[1:37:34] this Lord give me
[1:37:39] that yeah we have an atomic power
[1:37:45] message the countdown is
[1:37:47] here I got to
[1:37:50] stop
[1:37:54] but the clock is striking
[1:37:57] zero I am a true
[1:38:00] believer that Christ could come before
[1:38:05] morning amen we are that
[1:38:09] close I believe
[1:38:11] that so I need to start living my
[1:38:15] life where when I walk out that
[1:38:18] door and I start walking down the steps
[1:38:22] I am already
[1:38:24] prepared to leave this
[1:38:27] world Amen sir before we walk out those
[1:38:31] doors we have to be
[1:38:34] prepared to meet the
[1:38:36] Lord because the Rapture is coming
[1:38:40] soon we see Russia is where she's
[1:38:43] at we see Israel is where she's
[1:38:46] at we see America is where she's
[1:38:49] at all of been
[1:38:52] prophesy none of it's coming by
[1:38:55] surprise but the countdown has gone 10
[1:39:00] 98 and brother Bram ends his
[1:39:04] prayer and he
[1:39:08] say
[1:39:10] 10
[1:39:12] N8 seven six six five four three two
[1:39:24] it's takeoff
[1:39:26] time so my message tonight
[1:39:30] is let's make sure we're
[1:39:34] ready we've already got the dynamic or
[1:39:37] the the
[1:39:40] Dynamics and a prophet came to tell
[1:39:46] us that we're not just looking for an
[1:39:49] anointing we're we're not just looking
[1:39:51] for a temporary
[1:39:56] filling we're looking for a
[1:39:59] seiling
[1:40:01] seal
[1:40:03] amen I don't know what your situation
[1:40:08] is I don't know what your daily life
[1:40:10] looks
[1:40:14] like but I know one
[1:40:17] thing that it's time to get
[1:40:19] serious
[1:40:22] we're running out of
[1:40:26] time we have to be
[1:40:28] ready those astronauts are dressed a
[1:40:30] certain
[1:40:33] way those astronauts have to have a
[1:40:36] certain
[1:40:38] Vision those astronauts had to have
[1:40:41] studied certain
[1:40:43] things those astronauts have to be at a
[1:40:46] specific
[1:40:48] place they have to be strapped in
[1:40:52] they had to check all of their
[1:40:58] gauges you know when you're flying an
[1:41:00] instrument
[1:41:03] airplane they're teaching Us in in my
[1:41:06] instrument
[1:41:09] training he said if you fly into clouds
[1:41:11] where you can't see
[1:41:14] anything you have to rely on your
[1:41:19] instruments
[1:41:21] and they said your main
[1:41:26] focus should be on the indicator in the
[1:41:30] middle which is called your attitude
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:38] indicator and I thought what a name for
[1:41:41] an
[1:41:43] instrument but keep an eye on your
[1:41:47] attitude because that will give you a
[1:41:50] good idea
[1:41:52] idea of what all your other instruments
[1:41:54] are
[1:41:58] saying am I pitched up or pitched
[1:42:03] down your attitude indicator will give
[1:42:05] you a
[1:42:09] good am I turning right or turning
[1:42:13] left your attitude indicator will give
[1:42:16] you a good
[1:42:19] idea I think it's the same thing in a
[1:42:21] spiritual
[1:42:23] walk when we come to
[1:42:25] church and we're already angry at
[1:42:27] somebody across the
[1:42:30] Pew or all this preacher he preaches too
[1:42:36] long whatever the case
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:41] is your attitude
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:45] indicator will give you a good
[1:42:48] idea of what all of your other indic
[1:42:50] indicators are
[1:42:53] saying and then sometimes you wonder how
[1:42:55] brother foston pinpoints you so
[1:42:59] much because brother F's up
[1:43:02] here looking at your attitude
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:11] indicator with this
