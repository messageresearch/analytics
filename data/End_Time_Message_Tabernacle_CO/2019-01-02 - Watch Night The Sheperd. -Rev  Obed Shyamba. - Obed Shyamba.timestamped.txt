[2:09] I'll speak from some the Lord David says
[2:23] let em under the Lord is my shepherd I
[2:29] shall not want in a very positive
[2:33] element me to lie in the in green
[2:36] pastures pretty so he left me beside the
[2:40] still waters he restoreth my soul
[2:44] to second does go goddess for David it
[2:48] may convey that the Santee leadeth me in
[2:52] the paths of righteousness of course
[2:53] this one for his namesake country Merced
[2:57] Oliver a del hombre de lama yea though I
[2:59] walk you through the valley of the
[3:00] shadow of death
[3:01] okay Molly you know I will fear no evil
[3:05] for thou art with me
[3:08] now let it on bottom receive thy rod and
[3:11] thy staff they comfort me
[3:13] we dress the vomit in a table that
[3:15] prepares the table before me how fast
[3:18] the method versed in the presence of my
[3:20] enemies the way the word will matter
[3:24] thou anointest my head with a mock up
[3:26] the world with my all with all and
[3:29] macabre l'avenir Allah grass surely

[3:42] the Lord speaking of his experience he's
[3:51] speaking about him alone he said the
[3:55] Lord is my shepherd not our ship support
[4:00] directly came to mean that he was a
[4:02] shepherd a little nerve apart the book
[4:05] and the law doesn't have goats he only
[4:10] has
[4:12] Bathsheba Kanazawa because the Bible
[4:15] says that the ship knows my voice and
[4:17] follows him they forgot the vid with
[4:20] Kailah that's why when David he knows
[4:24] that the law the prophets there's a
[4:26] protest just as a shepherd protects his
[4:29] ship maintenance alicetin
[4:32] now as we are coming into this new
[4:34] elevator and are you going to be shipped
[4:38] beyond book or a a gold card a bit
[4:43] because we can see David and a
