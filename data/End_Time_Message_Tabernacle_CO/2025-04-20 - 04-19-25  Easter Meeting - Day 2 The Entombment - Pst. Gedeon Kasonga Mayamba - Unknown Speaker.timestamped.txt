[52:42] flow and it
[52:45] flow to the
[52:48] lowest
[52:50] valley. Oh, the
[52:53] blood. Oh, the
[52:55] blood that gives me
[52:58] strength from
[53:01] day to
[53:04] day. He would
[53:07] never. One more time.
[53:10] He wish for he
[53:14] reaches for he
[53:17] reaches to the
[53:20] highest
[53:23] mountain
[53:25] where it
[53:27] flow to the
[53:31] lowest valley.
[53:33] [Music]
[53:34] Oh, I
[53:36] live the blood that gives me
[53:41] strength from
[53:44] day to
[53:46] day. He will
[53:49] never
[53:52] lose his
[53:56] power. May the Lord bless you.
[54:02] We are going directly to take Isaiah
[54:04] chapter 53.
[54:08] We're going to read from verse 4 to
[54:10] verse 5.
[54:13] We are going to read in the name of the
[54:15] Lord Jesus
[54:22] Christ. Amen.
[54:45] May God bless the reading of his word.
[54:47] You may be
[54:51] seated. With this uh text, we are going
[54:54] to talk about the atonement.
[54:56] [Music]
[54:59] Because one Saturday, brother Benham
[55:00] preach about the atunement.
[55:05] The atunement has something special.
[55:10] We saw last Friday was uh the death the
[55:12] death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:17] What was an extraordinary thing?
[55:21] It's by dying he saved us.
[55:25] He didn't look at his precious life,
[55:30] but he sacrificed his own life to redeem
[55:35] us to restore us everything we lost when
[55:38] Adam fall
[55:40] fell. That was
[55:45] wonderful. He bore our sin upon his own
[55:49] body. He bore our sickness upon his
[55:52] body.
[55:54] I want you to pay attention
[55:59] tonight. As long as that body was not
[56:05] buried, God could could see this uh the
[56:10] sins upon this
[56:13] body and could tell who did sin.
[56:20] Oh, God does not bear to see
[56:26] sin. If the body of Jesus was there
[56:29] exposed despite being
[56:37] dead, the anger of God would have been
[56:40] uh strong and uh deprive us from the
[56:43] benefits of his
[56:46] death if he sorry.
[56:51] If he was risen wi without being
[56:56] buried, we I believe we would have been
[57:01] lost. It's not uh no wonder the poet
[57:06] said dying. He saved
[57:09] me and
[57:13] buried he take took my sin away.
[57:20] As long as he wasn't buried, sin was
[57:22] still
[57:24] there upon his body but at the sight of
[57:28] the
[57:29] father. Are we together?
[57:32] He had to be
[57:34] buried to take our sin away. Amen. Amen.
[57:40] to take our sickness
[57:43] away. Verse four, we
[57:46] read. It's our suffering that he took
[57:51] away to bear means
[57:54] here to take
[57:57] away far far
[58:01] away as it was happening in the Old
[58:03] Testament
[58:06] in Leviticus chapter 16.
[58:10] from verse 7 to verse
[58:13] 10 says Leviticus chapter 16 the Bible
[58:21] says you shall take the two
[58:24] goats he's talking about Aaron you will
[58:27] take two
[58:29] goats present them before the
[58:32] Lord at the door of the
[58:37] tabernacle Aaron shall has lots upon two
[58:43] goats. One lot for the Lord and the
[58:45] other lot for the
[58:52] scapegoat. And Aishan bring the goat
[58:55] upon which the Lord Lot
[58:59] fell and offer him for the sin offering.
[59:07] But the goat on which the Lord fell to
[59:09] be the
[59:11] scapegoat shall be pres presented alive
[59:14] before the Lord
[59:18] to make their
[59:21] atonements and to let him go for a
[59:24] scapegoat into the
[59:26] wilderness. They will bring two goats
[59:28] before the
[59:29] priest. He will slay one uh
[59:33] goat for the
[59:35] atonement. He died for the
[59:40] sin. They had to take the blood, the sin
[59:43] to put on the living
[59:45] goat and to cast him away in the
[59:49] wilderness to take the sin of the people
[59:53] away. Are we together?
[59:56] says in the message living, dying, uh
[1:00:02] buried, rising and coming
[1:00:05] back. Uh
[1:00:08] 59 paragraph
[1:00:12] 37, he said when something is buried,
[1:00:17] it's hid.
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:20] It's out of sight. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:27] buried. He carried my sins far
[1:00:35] away. God cannot see our sins no more
[1:00:38] because they are
[1:00:41] buried. It means before the buried at
[1:00:45] our sin was not upon us. They were upon
[1:00:48] Jesus. But God could still see see them.
[1:00:52] Are we together?
[1:00:54] God could see them.
[1:00:57] As long as God could seal them, he could
[1:01:00] tell this is a Gideon sin. This is
[1:01:04] Boston
[1:01:06] sin. He was still on the site, out of
[1:01:10] sight. The king of God that does not
[1:01:12] support bear the
[1:01:14] sins could be strong
[1:01:18] again and make us lose
[1:01:22] salvation. That is why the atonement is
[1:01:24] very important. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:31] I cannot see our sin no more because
[1:01:34] they are
[1:01:35] buried. Where they are
[1:01:38] buried in the sea of
[1:01:41] forgetfulness. Think of a sea of
[1:01:45] forgetfulness. God cannot remember
[1:01:51] them. The atonement makes God not to
[1:01:54] remember our sin.
[1:01:57] Oh, what a blessful
[1:01:59] day. Death is good.
[1:02:03] But it took the atonement. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:07] Yes, my
[1:02:09] brothers because they are both dead and
[1:02:12] buried. Brother says,
[1:02:18] even remembered no more.
[1:02:22] You will tell God he did
[1:02:25] this. God cannot even remember anything.
[1:02:30] He cannot even remember
[1:02:34] it. Come tell me that I sin. I'll tell
[1:02:36] you no. I'd never
[1:02:38] sin. If God doesn't remember them,
[1:02:42] don't remind me about it.
[1:02:46] God forgot about it. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:51] They out of God's memory.
[1:02:56] Us with our little memory,
[1:02:59] we can still remember he did
[1:03:02] this. But for God, he got he got out of
[1:03:05] his
[1:03:06] memory. Are we
[1:03:10] together? That is why what man says
[1:03:12] about me does I don't care.
[1:03:15] What matters for me
[1:03:17] in what God says about me. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:23] It's out of God's memory.
[1:03:26] Paragraph 40 says
[1:03:32] and Jesus was represented in these two
[1:03:36] goats because there's a false teaching
[1:03:40] saying Jesus was the goat of the Lord
[1:03:43] that was
[1:03:44] slew and the living one was
[1:03:48] better said
[1:03:52] Jesus was represented in both the
[1:03:56] animals, both
[1:03:59] goats. One, he
[1:04:02] died. He died for the
[1:04:06] atonement. The second the sin from the
[1:04:09] atonement was put upon the
[1:04:12] scapegoat, the
[1:04:14] scapegoat. And the
[1:04:16] scapegoat took the sins of the
[1:04:19] people and went far into the
[1:04:23] wilderness to bear the sins of the
[1:04:27] people. Why does it mean that the gods
[1:04:30] that was released? The one that was
[1:04:32] sued. What was
[1:04:35] it? He was the
[1:04:38] death. He was the death and the burial
[1:04:41] of our Lord Jesus.
[1:04:43] The gods that were
[1:04:46] slew represented God in his
[1:04:49] death and the one that was alive.
[1:04:53] It was God in his. Amen.
[1:04:57] Amen. He said
[1:04:59] dying living. He loved
[1:05:02] me. Dying he saved me.
[1:05:06] Buried. He carried my sins away.
[1:05:12] He took the sins of the
[1:05:16] people. He took the sin of the people
[1:05:18] upon himself and carried them plum down
[1:05:20] in the lowest of
[1:05:23] others. He was the sin
[1:05:27] offering. He had the sins of the
[1:05:30] people. He died for them. And
[1:05:35] also he took our sins upon him.
[1:05:40] and took our sin far
[1:05:43] away
[1:05:47] says so far that God could never see
[1:05:49] them no more.
[1:05:52] Think of it.
[1:05:54] God cannot even see your sin no
[1:05:59] more. I believe on what the word
[1:06:03] says. God can never see my sin in this
[1:06:07] day.
[1:06:09] because Christ took them
[1:06:11] away. Say, think of
[1:06:18] it. The church could scream hallelujah
[1:06:21] for such a
[1:06:22] savior. Hallelujah. Can I hear some
[1:06:26] hallelujah? And I hear glory to God.
[1:06:31] For what a savior
[1:06:33] who died for your sins
[1:06:36] that took them carried them
[1:06:40] away so far that they cannot even
[1:06:42] remember it. Oh my
[1:06:46] brother, what which was
[1:06:50] buried they cannot even be found on
[1:06:53] you. Stay with
[1:06:56] me. If your sin have been buried if lies
[1:07:00] have been
[1:07:01] buried, they cannot be found upon you
[1:07:04] because they have been taken
[1:07:07] away. Are we do you agree?
[1:07:11] If they have been buried,
[1:07:14] they cannot be found on me. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:18] Yes, my brothers and sisters, even
[1:07:22] sickness that have been
[1:07:24] buried, take and dump never been found
[1:07:27] on you. Are we together?
[1:07:31] The pain that you feeling, it's a lie.
[1:07:33] Amen.
[1:07:34] Amen. I want this tonight by
[1:07:40] faith. I want you to start feeling your
[1:07:43] sins going
[1:07:45] away, your sickness going
[1:07:48] away, going far
[1:07:51] away far away, away from you, away from
[1:07:56] your body, away from your life. Amen.
[1:08:00] Amen. Yes, my
[1:08:02] beloved. Somebody can say shout amen.
[1:08:06] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Shout
[1:08:10] hallelujah.
[1:08:11] Yes, my beloved
[1:08:13] brothers says paragraph
[1:08:16] 41, you say our
[1:08:19] sins are not just forgiven,
[1:08:26] but they are buried in the sea of
[1:08:29] forgetfulness to be remembered no
[1:08:32] more.
[1:08:34] buried. They carried our sins far
[1:08:40] away. No more can they be
[1:08:44] remembered for they are
[1:08:48] gone. They out of the eyes of the
[1:08:52] God, you know, in the Old Testament.
[1:08:58] When they hire a prophet to curse the
[1:09:01] children of Israel,
[1:09:05] they were showing you. Look at your
[1:09:07] people. God said when I
[1:09:11] look, I don't I don't see any iniquity
[1:09:14] in
[1:09:15] Jacob. You look what something
[1:09:18] else. He doesn't say I don't see
[1:09:21] iniquities in Israel. That's not what he
[1:09:22] said. But he said in Jacob
[1:09:26] or Jacob means a liar.
[1:09:29] But God
[1:09:31] looked I don't see any iniquities in
[1:09:34] Jacob. When God forgives,
[1:09:38] he carries your sin
[1:09:41] away. He cannot even remember
[1:09:44] them. God look at the atonement. Amen.
[1:09:48] Amen.
[1:09:49] Yes. My beloved brothers, this is the
[1:09:52] exact truth. Amen.
[1:09:56] Amen. They cannot be
[1:09:59] remembered. They are
[1:10:01] gone. They are out of the eyes gods.
[1:10:06] Oh, they are
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:08] paralyzed. Is using all the terms. They
[1:10:10] are paraly. They are devoid. They are
[1:10:13] put
[1:10:14] away. God don't remember them no
[1:10:17] more. Say what? the church
[1:10:22] how to rejoice. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:26] How to rejoice this morning or
[1:10:28] tonight to know
[1:10:34] that our gods will no more be no our God
[1:10:39] sorry that our sin will no more be
[1:10:42] remembered. They are putting the sin of
[1:10:45] forgetfulness into the
[1:10:49] grave beyond any resurrection.
[1:10:53] They are dead forever.
[1:10:57] Amen.
[1:10:58] Amen. Forgotten.
[1:11:01] Do you want me to read the rest? What
[1:11:05] says they are if they had never been
[1:11:08] they never happened.
[1:11:12] never happened
[1:11:14] before by leaving
[1:11:17] Easter. We will be
[1:11:20] surprised to see things that was buried
[1:11:23] in your
[1:11:24] life that would be a
[1:11:27] disappointment to see sins that were
[1:11:30] buried to be seen in your
[1:11:33] life. No, since it's
[1:11:35] buried in this day,
[1:11:39] they have to be carried away from your
[1:11:41] life. God will never remember them no
[1:11:44] more.
[1:11:46] Kick him out. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:49] Yes, my brothers and sisters. This is
[1:11:52] the exact truth. Dying. He saved
[1:11:56] me by
[1:11:58] buried. He carried my sin
[1:12:04] away. He carried my sins so far till
[1:12:07] they went into the se of
[1:12:09] forgiveness. I love this part
[1:12:13] says, "Oh, we know those
[1:12:17] things are most truly believed among
[1:12:20] us."
[1:12:22] Not just believe.
[1:12:26] but most surely believed among
[1:12:29] us. When he was buried,
[1:12:33] he carried our sins, our sickness away
[1:12:35] from
[1:12:38] us. These things are most truly believed
[1:12:41] among
[1:12:43] us and they are most surely the
[1:12:48] truth. They are most surely the
[1:12:51] truth. You can doubt about anything else
[1:12:54] but not this
[1:12:57] one. Your sins, your sickness have been
[1:13:00] carried away from
[1:13:01] you. And tonight they had to go away
[1:13:04] from you because this is the evening of
[1:13:08] buried. Your sickness have been buried.
[1:13:12] Your sin have been
[1:13:14] buried. Your problem
[1:13:17] buried. Buriness
[1:13:21] buried. Everything wrong had to be
[1:13:27] buried. These things are surely surely
[1:13:30] the most truth.
[1:13:32] I don't know if you
[1:13:33] understand the the acting the emphasis
[1:13:36] that the prophet is putting on
[1:13:38] this. These things are most truly
[1:13:43] believed. They are most surely the
[1:13:45] truth.
[1:13:47] He's repeating.
[1:13:50] All these things are God's
[1:13:53] truth. All those great
[1:13:57] things we're beyond human
[1:14:01] expressions, words to express this. We
[1:14:04] don't have words to express
[1:14:06] this. God should have given us another
[1:14:11] language to express what we think about
[1:14:14] these things.
[1:14:20] We can never express our gratitude for
[1:14:21] such things. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:26] Buried. He carried our sins
[1:14:29] away. When he went to the cross of
[1:14:32] Calvary, he had our sin upon him, my
[1:14:35] sickness upon him. When he died, he paid
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:39] price. My sins was still upon him. God
[1:14:43] could see them. God said then you need
[1:14:47] the atonement. Amen.
[1:14:49] Amen. He had to be in
[1:14:51] tuned for your the sin to be gone away
[1:14:55] from you. For that sickness to be gone
[1:14:57] away from you. That is why tonight it's
[1:15:00] very
[1:15:02] important for everybody that is sick or
[1:15:05] they have a certain need. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:10] to have a right mental
[1:15:12] attitude to have a renewal of
[1:15:17] mind to be in harmony with the mind of
[1:15:22] God. Don't be out of the face of the
[1:15:25] mind of
[1:15:27] God. Be in harmony with the mind of God.
[1:15:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:36] When God said they had been carried
[1:15:37] away, be in the same harmony with that
[1:15:39] mind.
[1:15:42] Don't be God say one thing and then you
[1:15:44] think something else. No my brother
[1:15:47] notice the
[1:15:49] healing or it comes after the
[1:15:52] forgiveness of sins. Are we
[1:15:55] together? We read in verse
[1:15:58] four. He was wounded for our
[1:16:00] sins, bruised for our iniquities.
[1:16:05] Then by his stripes we are healed. Are
[1:16:08] we together?
[1:16:12] Healing always comes after the
[1:16:13] forgiveness of
[1:16:14] sins. God first drill with the sins and
[1:16:18] when it's
[1:16:21] settled the consequences of sins have
[1:16:23] been settled. Amen.
[1:16:27] That is
[1:16:29] why even when they brought the the
[1:16:32] before
[1:16:33] Jesus before healing the man he told him
[1:16:37] first take courage my
[1:16:40] son your sins had been
[1:16:43] forgiven it's after then he said take
[1:16:46] your bed and go are we
[1:16:49] together he had first to settle this
[1:16:52] problem of sin when that problem has
[1:16:54] been settled
[1:16:56] healing comes after. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:01] That is why in Psalm chapter
[1:17:05] 103 verse two verse three,
[1:17:09] David said this, my soul, bless the
[1:17:15] Lord and forget not his all his benefit.
[1:17:21] Listen, who forgiveth all thy
[1:17:25] iniquities? I want to convince
[1:17:28] somebody that God does not forgive
[1:17:31] certain
[1:17:33] iniquities, not few certain
[1:17:37] iniquities. No matter your
[1:17:40] iniquities, my Bible says,
[1:17:45] he forgiveth all thy iniquities.
[1:17:50] means all your iniquities. Amen.
[1:17:53] Amen. And when he forgives all your
[1:17:55] iniquities,
[1:17:59] he health all that
[1:18:01] diseases. There's no
[1:18:04] diseases. That is stronger than the
[1:18:08] atonement. I don't know in what language
[1:18:10] should I speak.
[1:18:13] There's not
[1:18:14] disease or
[1:18:16] sin stronger than the blood of Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ.
[1:18:21] It does not exist, my
[1:18:23] brother. No matter your
[1:18:26] disease, no matter what it is, the Bible
[1:18:32] says God forgiveth all that
[1:18:37] iniquity. I want your mind be in harmony
[1:18:40] with the mind of God. Amen.
[1:18:43] When God says all your
[1:18:45] iniquities, don't say but this one, even
[1:18:48] this
[1:18:49] one, what do you mean even this one?
[1:18:52] What do you mean?
[1:18:55] When he says health all their disease,
[1:18:58] don't say he heals. That's true. But
[1:19:01] this one, no. Listen.
[1:19:05] Let's all read together out loud. All
[1:19:07] out loud.
[1:19:10] You you can read it in English. Verse
[1:19:13] four. Who Who forgiveth all thy
[1:19:16] iniquities? Who healeth all thy
[1:19:19] diseases? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:26] He forgives all thy
[1:19:29] iniquities and he heals all their
[1:19:31] diseases.
[1:19:33] in the message guarding his
[1:19:36] people uh 27 February 1950
[1:19:42] uh second part five says and
[1:19:47] then go and see no
[1:19:51] more he was speaking to the women that
[1:19:54] committed he said go and see no
[1:19:58] more a worse thing come upon
[1:20:01] thee So
[1:20:04] therefore in order to obtain your
[1:20:08] healing you'll have to become Christian
[1:20:11] after you are healed to heal
[1:20:14] you God can even heal the s even the
[1:20:18] pagan you don't need to be a Christian
[1:20:20] to be
[1:20:22] healed but to keep your
[1:20:26] healing you have to become Christian are
[1:20:29] we
[1:20:30] together therefore
[1:20:33] To keep your
[1:20:36] healing, you will have to become
[1:20:38] Christian after you
[1:20:39] heal. And I believe I will say
[1:20:44] this. Talking of the dual
[1:20:47] atonies. When you are
[1:20:50] healed, your sins are forgiven
[1:20:53] you. They both go together. When God
[1:20:57] forgives you, he heals you. If he heals
[1:20:59] you, that means he forgiven you. Amen.
[1:21:02] Amen.
[1:21:06] I didn't hear very amens on that. Amen.
[1:21:10] Amen.
[1:21:12] But this is the exact truth.
[1:21:14] Amen. They all go together. He heals and
[1:21:18] he
[1:21:19] forgives. If you are healed, that means
[1:21:21] God has forgiven
[1:21:23] you. Become Christian if you were not
[1:21:25] Christian. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:29] upon the word Lord.
[1:21:34] March uh
[1:21:37] 48 second part paragraph
[1:21:39] 5 says
[1:21:44] now he's here to heal
[1:21:52] tonight. Why will he heal some and leave
[1:21:55] others go?
[1:22:00] Why? As if God was lacking
[1:22:04] power, as if he was limited in
[1:22:07] power, why would he heal
[1:22:10] some let others go without being healed?
[1:22:13] He say,
[1:22:20] see, it's not God's will for any of you
[1:22:23] to go unhealed.
[1:22:28] Let your mind be in harmony with the
[1:22:30] mind of
[1:22:31] God. It's not the will of
[1:22:33] God to let none of you to go unhealed.
[1:22:40] It's not God's
[1:22:42] will for any of you to
[1:22:45] go, to go unsaved.
[1:22:48] The will of God is to heal you all and
[1:22:52] to save you all. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:55] And when God works, imagine a God in
[1:22:59] whom we believe, the great Jehovah, the
[1:23:03] almighty God,
[1:23:06] the seven compound name. Imagine that
[1:23:09] God, he wants to heal
[1:23:11] you. What is that
[1:23:13] power that will hinder God from doing
[1:23:18] it? What is that
[1:23:20] demon that will stand in the way of
[1:23:22] God's healing? when it's his will.
[1:23:28] What is that power that will hinder God
[1:23:32] to save you?
[1:23:35] When it's the will of God to save
[1:23:39] you, when you
[1:23:41] realize, it is the will of God. Oh my
[1:23:45] brother,
[1:23:48] rejoice because there's no
[1:23:51] kingdom that can stand in the way of God
[1:23:54] that can hinder him to fulfill his will.
[1:23:58] Amen.
[1:24:00] Amen. When God wants to bless you, who
[1:24:03] can hinder
[1:24:06] him? Nobody.
[1:24:09] I say
[1:24:11] nobody. I want you to understand that
[1:24:13] very well.
[1:24:14] It's the will of
[1:24:16] God. That is why I don't pray. Oh God,
[1:24:20] if it's your will, bless me.
[1:24:24] It's already his will.
[1:24:28] There's no if.
[1:24:32] I don't put
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:35] if. Oh God,
[1:24:38] if if you want, heal me.
[1:24:42] He already said his his
[1:24:47] will. When you come back before him if
[1:24:49] it's your will, it means you are
[1:24:52] doubting his
[1:24:53] will and you will not be
[1:24:56] healed and you will not receive that
[1:24:59] thing. Go before God. Tell him you say
[1:25:04] you want to hear
[1:25:06] me. Amen.
[1:25:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:16] Go. Don't go using C. If
[1:25:21] somebody went in the Bible,
[1:25:23] he had a leprosy, he told the Lord,
[1:25:27] Lord, if if you
[1:25:29] want cleanse me.
[1:25:33] Why did
[1:25:34] Jesus I I want it. Be cleansed.
[1:25:37] Yes, he wanted it.
[1:25:39] We came for that.
[1:25:45] Don't you doubt the will of God.
[1:25:51] As long as your need is the right knees,
[1:25:55] it's the will of
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:04] God. If you're asking millions to serve
[1:26:06] the Lord,
[1:26:08] It is will.
[1:26:12] Don't say if you will what you will
[1:26:14] want. No.
[1:26:16] That's not how I
[1:26:22] pray. Once I know his will, I go before
[1:26:25] God with
[1:26:27] courage. I'm speaking to him
[1:26:30] in I'm claiming my rights and he gives
[1:26:34] me because that's his will.
[1:26:38] Another one when the
[1:26:41] Bible he was doubting the power of Jesus
[1:26:45] Christ and this child has had epilepsy.
[1:26:49] He said if you want if you can if you
[1:26:53] can heal my son Jesus said if I can you
[1:26:59] said if I
[1:27:00] can you don't even know who you're
[1:27:02] talking to.
[1:27:07] if I can.
[1:27:10] Jesus was
[1:27:11] worried. He said, "You really asking me
[1:27:15] if I have power? You really telling me
[1:27:17] if I have power to heal your son? You
[1:27:20] don't even know who you're talking
[1:27:23] to. Don't go before God using if you
[1:27:25] can, if you could.
[1:27:30] Go before God with his word."
[1:27:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:37] When you have his word,
[1:27:42] go before him with his
[1:27:45] word. Just take that if away from your
[1:27:50] mouth. It is the will of God to heal
[1:27:55] you. It is the will of God to save you.
[1:27:58] And when God
[1:28:00] saves, he saves completely.
[1:28:04] saved fully,
[1:28:07] perfectly.
[1:28:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:11] Yes, my brothers and sisters, I believe
[1:28:13] in a God that saves me that even saves
[1:28:17] my job, my whole house, my enterprise,
[1:28:22] everything that I do, Hallelujah.
[1:28:23] Hallelujah.
[1:28:25] Yes, my brothers and sisters, this is
[1:28:27] the exact truth. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:30] It's the will of God to give you that.
[1:28:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:36] It's the will of God to bless
[1:28:38] thee. It's the will of God tonight to
[1:28:42] heal you. That is
[1:28:47] why. He forgiveth all your
[1:28:51] iniquities and he health all your
[1:28:54] diseases. Then if you know his
[1:28:57] will, I can have a will
[1:29:00] and I can be limited. Are we together?
[1:29:04] The pastor can have a will but it's very
[1:29:07] limited.
[1:29:09] But the one who has a will here, he has
[1:29:12] all the
[1:29:16] resources before making promises. I said
[1:29:20] it the other
[1:29:21] day. It takes his time to have
[1:29:26] calculations. I have all the
[1:29:29] resources and when I'm sure I have the
[1:29:31] resources then he can pronounce the word
[1:29:34] once he said it says
[1:29:39] God is bound by his
[1:29:42] word sometime we don't understand it
[1:29:44] very well
[1:29:46] amen when you remind God his word you
[1:29:49] are bound in
[1:29:50] God becomes weak
[1:29:54] the only way to get away from it is will
[1:29:57] fulfill the promise. Praise God.
[1:30:03] If you want to seek God's weakness, take
[1:30:06] his word, stop bonding him. Stop binding
[1:30:08] him.
[1:30:10] He becomes weak without power until he
[1:30:14] fulfills his
[1:30:15] word to freed
[1:30:18] himself. And God doesn't like to be
[1:30:21] bound. As soon as you burn him, as soon
[1:30:25] as he release himself by fulfilling his
[1:30:27] word.
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:30] Amen. Praise God.
[1:30:34] God is bound by his word until he
[1:30:37] fulfills it.
[1:30:40] Yes, my brothers and sisters, when you
[1:30:44] know, who has the will to bless you who
[1:30:48] wants to heal you, who wants to save
[1:30:50] you, you know his
[1:30:53] power, you can be comfortable. Amen.
[1:30:58] Amen. In torment of the Lord Jesus,
[1:31:03] it's the perfect
[1:31:05] expression of his will and of his power.
[1:31:12] to give you all that you
[1:31:14] need. But the Bible says,
[1:31:17] Revelation chapter 5, second
[1:31:22] part
[1:31:25] 61, 18th June 61, paragraph 15. He
[1:31:34] says, sister on the in the on the
[1:31:36] wheelchair
[1:31:40] or maybe others that are sick and
[1:31:42] afflicted. Now
[1:31:44] listen, I want us all to read together.
[1:31:48] Let's all read
[1:31:50] together. That's how I
[1:31:52] preach. Let's go. If you can have
[1:31:55] perfect understanding that it's God's
[1:31:58] good pleasure to make you well, there
[1:32:02] isn't enough devils in the country to
[1:32:06] keep you sick.
[1:32:09] Do you understand
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:14] this? How you going to stay
[1:32:18] sick? If you can
[1:32:21] understand and the perfect
[1:32:23] understanding, it pleases
[1:32:26] God. So please God, good pleasure to
[1:32:30] make you well. Bam
[1:32:33] says, there's not enough devil in the
[1:32:36] country to keep you
[1:32:41] sick. There's not enough demon in the
[1:32:45] country to keep you sick. In another
[1:32:49] place he
[1:32:50] says there's no enough demon in
[1:32:53] hell. One hell is not
[1:32:56] enough. It takes maybe 50
[1:32:59] hells. Unfortunately, there's only one
[1:33:02] hell. Hell is not enough to keep you
[1:33:06] from being healed. Praise God. I want us
[1:33:09] to understand tonight by
[1:33:12] burial. It's in good
[1:33:15] pleasure. It pleases God so
[1:33:20] well. God is not happy to see you
[1:33:24] sick, to see you mourning,
[1:33:29] complaining, to see you childless while
[1:33:32] you want
[1:33:33] it. It's not God's good pleasure. It
[1:33:36] doesn't please God. What says it's God's
[1:33:40] good pleasure to make you well.
[1:33:46] He pleases God so well. You are in need.
[1:33:50] I want you to
[1:33:52] understand. He pleases God,
[1:33:55] to grant you that desire.
[1:33:59] It's God good pleasure to heal you, to
[1:34:03] bless you, to fill you, to save you.
[1:34:08] It's God's good
[1:34:09] pleasure in such a way.
[1:34:15] There's no enough demon in her.
[1:34:19] There's no enough demon in
[1:34:21] her to keep you in that condition.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:34:27] Oh my beloved brothers. It's God's good
[1:34:30] pleasure. That's
[1:34:33] burial. See, you see that's
[1:34:36] true. When you
[1:34:39] understand that good, it's God's good
[1:34:42] pleasure to make you
[1:34:45] well and he has did it for you. Amen.
[1:34:48] Amen.
[1:34:50] And you
[1:34:53] understand and then how that you are
[1:34:55] going to do a certain
[1:34:57] thing there's no hindrance. Go move
[1:35:00] forward. Do it.
[1:35:03] It's God's good will.
[1:35:06] It's got good pressure.
[1:35:08] Hey my beloved brothers, if you
[1:35:12] understand when you realize
[1:35:16] when your conscious being is being
[1:35:17] awakened, when you
[1:35:20] realize Jacob was awakened. Amen. Yes,
[1:35:24] my brothers and sisters and change loose
[1:35:26] to better. Somebody tonight can realize
[1:35:31] can take
[1:35:33] conscience. It's God's good
[1:35:35] pleasure. He pleases
[1:35:38] God. What demon can come and certain
[1:35:41] you and make you sad
[1:35:46] and be a hindrance for God to fulfill
[1:35:49] his will for you. God already promised
[1:35:52] in the land that I'm calling you. There
[1:35:54] will not be a barren woman
[1:35:59] near that's God's good pleasure to visit
[1:36:02] you in that
[1:36:04] land and the message is the
[1:36:08] land God has separated us and open us a
[1:36:12] new land the message for this hour and I
[1:36:16] believe in this
[1:36:18] message there will not be a woman a
[1:36:22] buried woman
[1:36:24] Yes, my brother and
[1:36:25] sister in our album pictures book of the
[1:36:29] family. Everybody that
[1:36:32] was they ended up having
[1:36:34] kids. We can take
[1:36:37] Sarah. They ended up giving birth. We
[1:36:40] can take Rebecca. She ended up giving
[1:36:43] birth. We can take Rachel. She ended up
[1:36:46] giving birth. We can take Elizabeth. She
[1:36:48] ended up giving birth. Even close here.
[1:36:53] Lo, the wife of Philip, she was buried
[1:36:57] and she ended up giving birth, you as
[1:36:59] well. If you in the same line, you will
[1:37:02] end up giving birth.
[1:37:05] It's God's good will. Amen.
[1:37:08] Hallelujah. It's God's good
[1:37:12] will. This is the family book, pictures
[1:37:15] book.
[1:37:19] There was none that went without a
[1:37:22] child.
[1:37:24] I want to tell somebody
[1:37:26] tonight
[1:37:27] buried. He took my sin
[1:37:30] away. I want to tell somebody
[1:37:34] the perfect
[1:37:36] expression of the will of
[1:37:39] God to grant you your
[1:37:41] desire.
[1:37:44] Amen. Oh me, my brothers and sisters,
[1:37:47] Oh, he doesn't have a
[1:37:49] seat. What other look like in our album
[1:37:53] of family?
[1:37:55] Our father Abraham, he was too
[1:37:57] old. God made him young again. God renew
[1:38:01] his body. May God renew somebody
[1:38:05] tonight. Yes, my brothers and
[1:38:07] sisters. God make somebody young again
[1:38:10] tonight.
[1:38:11] Amen. Because Christ was
[1:38:14] buried. He took barness away.
[1:38:18] When he's taking barness
[1:38:22] away takes place. Yes my brother and
[1:38:26] sister. When it takes away
[1:38:29] sickness come. Yes my brother. This is
[1:38:33] exact
[1:38:34] truth.
[1:38:37] Say these things are surely right the
[1:38:41] truth among us.
[1:38:46] They are surely the
[1:38:48] truth. Amen.
[1:38:51] Yes, my brothers and
[1:38:52] sisters in our genealogy of the family
[1:38:56] even brother Brenam he was even the
[1:38:59] cabin in a poor
[1:39:01] condition did not die. No my brothers
[1:39:05] and
[1:39:05] sisters in the ped. Yes, my brothers and
[1:39:09] sisters in
[1:39:13] the you don't need your parents to be
[1:39:15] rich.
[1:39:17] You can start your own story.
[1:39:21] Amen. Praise
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:27] God. You can start your own history
[1:39:30] right now. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:36] when you speaking of John
[1:39:40] Char was born of a spirit the poor
[1:39:43] spirit everything was against them poor
[1:39:47] parents poor they were divorced parents
[1:39:50] they were
[1:39:52] separated and after that he was
[1:39:54] stuttering he didn't even have an easy
[1:39:57] language but when he believed this
[1:40:01] word God healed his speech
[1:40:04] He was not stuttering. He had a barren
[1:40:07] women. The women gave birth. He was
[1:40:10] poor. He was selling
[1:40:13] things. Now he was paying two three
[1:40:16] millions for the for the good
[1:40:20] work. That's the God that
[1:40:25] believes. The poverty of my father has
[1:40:27] nothing to do with me. It has nothing to
[1:40:31] do with me.
[1:40:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:37] Yes, my brothers and
[1:40:38] sisters. Oh, that's
[1:40:41] it. It's because it was buried. Amen.

[1:40:48] Hallelujah. I feel good.
[1:40:51] Yes, we feel good. Amen. Amen. Praise
[1:40:55] God.
[1:40:56] Bam
[1:40:58] says in the same message paragraph
[1:41:02] 77 he
[1:41:04] says therefore you
[1:41:12] see before you ever get or feel any
[1:41:16] different or anything else are you with
[1:41:24] me before you ever get or feel anything
[1:41:27] or anything
[1:41:33] else. You can just be as happy over your
[1:41:37] healing in saying you got
[1:41:41] it. Don't wait to feel it. Then you can
[1:41:44] believe God had done it. But says when
[1:41:48] the angel told Mary, you will have a
[1:41:51] child. There was no sign. Amen.
[1:41:57] Mary went to testify to Elizabeth. She
[1:42:00] didn't expect to wait to
[1:42:01] see. Let let me see this month. I want
[1:42:04] to see if I will see if I if I will feel
[1:42:08] what I'm going to
[1:42:09] feel.
[1:42:11] Listen, we have two
[1:42:14] dispensation. Under
[1:42:17] Moses, are you with me?
[1:42:20] It just fell right now.
[1:42:22] God told the children of Israel,
[1:42:24] the Egyptian that you see here, you will
[1:42:27] see them no more. The Israel was there.
[1:42:30] They did not rejoice.
[1:42:33] Amen. Once they crossed the the
[1:42:37] the saw the
[1:42:39] Egyptian, they
[1:42:41] took and they started singing.
[1:42:44] Hallelujah. We are not like that.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] Hallelujah.
[1:42:49] [Applause]
[1:42:55] When Moses
[1:42:57] left, Joshua took over. What about says
[1:43:01] Joshua?
[1:43:04] He's the leader of the end time. Amen.
[1:43:06] Amen.
[1:43:08] The leader of the third pool. Amen.
[1:43:10] Amen. When he
[1:43:14] says just walk seven times around the
[1:43:17] walls when they started shouting and the
[1:43:21] walls will
[1:43:23] fall. They did not wait to see the crack
[1:43:27] on the wall to start shouting. Are we
[1:43:29] together? Are we together?
[1:43:33] Don't wait to see the crack on the wall
[1:43:36] to start shouting
[1:43:39] because the walls is waiting for the
[1:43:42] shout to fall. Praise God.
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:47] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:52] This is the end of the third.
[1:43:54] When God speaks,
[1:43:56] it's already done. It's settled.
[1:44:00] It's over.

[1:44:22] Moses. To see the Egyptian falling. Then
[1:44:25] we can take a tambourine and start
[1:44:27] worshiping God.

[1:45:23] meeting, he went by the shop. He got a
[1:45:27] pair of shoes. He brought to the
[1:45:31] church without crippling
[1:45:34] limping. Somebody asked him, "But these
[1:45:38] shoes, it's for your father. It's for
[1:45:41] somebody else.
[1:45:43] The one who was asking the question was
[1:45:45] looking at the feet. He said, "Your your
[1:45:48] your feet is crippled and then you have
[1:45:50] shoes. It's for your father or for your
[1:45:53] somebody else." And the man said, "I
[1:45:56] will wear them. I will wear
[1:46:00] them
[1:46:02] says at the end of the
[1:46:06] meeting, he wore them." Hallelujah.

[1:47:07] There's not enough demon in the
[1:47:09] house to keep you in that
[1:47:12] condition.
[1:47:14] Never say therefore you
[1:47:20] see before you even feel different or
[1:47:23] anything
[1:47:29] else. You can just be as happy over your
[1:47:32] healing in saying you got it.

[1:48:36] boy, buy a boy clothes, you want a girl
[1:48:41] clothes. Yes, my brothers and sisters,

[1:50:03] and his
[1:50:05] burial is bringing back the
[1:50:08] believers in a condition to pronounce
[1:50:10] the word and things will take place. Are

[1:50:20] from me and that putting me in the
