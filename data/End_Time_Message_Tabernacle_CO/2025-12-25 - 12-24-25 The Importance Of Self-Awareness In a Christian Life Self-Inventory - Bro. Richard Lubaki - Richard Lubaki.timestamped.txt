[38:51] So I'm going to read quick in English.
[38:54] So for the French you can follow on the
[38:57] the screen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; And unto the angel of the church of
[39:04] louditions, right? These things say the
[39:08] Amen, the faithful and the true witness,
[39:13] the beginning of the creation of God. I
[39:17] know thy works
[39:19] that thou art neither cold nor hot. I
[39:23] will thou wet cold or hot. So then
[39:27] because thou are lukewarm and neither
[39:30] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[39:35] mouth. Verse 17 is where is our thought
[39:39] tonight.
[39:42] Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[39:46] increased with goods, and have need of
[39:50] nothing,
[39:52] and knowest not that thou are wretched,
[39:56] and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
[40:00] naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[40:05] dry in the fire, that thou mayest be
[40:09] rich, and white remnant, that thou
[40:13] mayest be clothed, and that this the
[40:16] shame of thy neck, thy nakedness do not
[40:21] appear, and anoint thy eyes with eyes,
[40:27] that thou mayest see. As many as I love,
[40:32] I rebuke and chasten.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Be jealous, therefore, and repent.
[40:40] 20 Behold, I stand at the door and
[40:44] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[40:49] the door, I will come into him, and I
[40:52] will s with him and he with me.
[40:58] To him that overcomemeth
[41:00] will grant to sit with me in my throne,
[41:05] even as I also overcame, and sat down
[41:11] with my father in his throne. He that
[41:16] had here, let him hear what the spirit
[41:21] said unto the churches. May the Lord add
[41:25] a blessing to the reading of his word.
[41:29] You may be saved.
[41:31] So as I said
[41:33] uh our major thought
[41:36] it in verse 17
[41:39] where it speak about the condition of
[41:42] the church.
[41:44] The church doesn't know
[41:48] it condition.
[41:50] So it worries our thoughts because thou
[41:53] sayest, I am rich and increased with
[41:56] goods and have need of nothing and
[42:01] knowest not.
[42:04] So the condition of the church, the
[42:07] church is ignorant of his condition.
[42:13] When we talking about the church, it's
[42:16] not about this building.
[42:18] But we talking about the individual,
[42:20] right? You are the church. I am the
[42:24] church. So when we say about church,
[42:27] don't see end time message,
[42:30] but see yourself as the church we're
[42:33] talking about.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're going to take again
[42:41] another scripture here
[42:44] &gt;&gt; in Luke Luke.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 15. Verse
[42:50] 8 to 10.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Either what a woman having 10 pieces of
[42:59] silver, if she lose one piece, do not
[43:05] light a candle, and sweep the house and
[43:09] seek diligently till she found it. And
[43:13] when she had found it, she called her
[43:16] friends and and her neighbors together,
[43:20] saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have
[43:23] found the peace which I had lost."
[43:28] Likewise, I said unto you, there is joy
[43:32] in the presence of of the angels of God
[43:37] over one sinner that repented.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; So if we have a thought tonight,
[43:47] &gt;&gt; we will be speaking for this short time
[43:49] about
[43:53] &gt;&gt; the importance of selfawareness
[43:57] in a Christian's life.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me?
[44:06] the importance of selfawwareness
[44:10] in a Christian's life
[44:15] and my inspiration will be self
[44:18] inventory.
[44:23] Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; So if you understand the subject,
[44:28] you're going to have a major idea about
[44:30] what we'll be talking tonight.
[44:33] the importance of selfawareness
[44:39] in a Christian's life.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; So where we read in the Bible in
[44:44] Revelation,
[44:47] the Lord saying
[44:49] the church is naked,
[44:53] &gt;&gt; poor,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; but the church doesn't know about it.
[44:59] The church thinks he's rich.
[45:03] is clothed
[45:06] but it's the contrary of that but the
[45:10] church doesn't know the condition which
[45:13] he is.
[45:17] So again when we say about church
[45:20] we're talking about you as individual.
[45:24] So as the church doesn't know his
[45:28] condition
[45:30] it very important
[45:32] for you as a church
[45:35] &gt;&gt; to know your condition.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Because if you know your condition,
[45:42] you're going to know what to do next.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; If you are ignorant of your condition,
[45:51] you're not going to go anywhere. You're
[45:54] not going to know what to do.
[45:57] Amen. Amen. That's why when even you go
[45:59] to the hospital,
[46:02] To see a doctor, a good doctor, before
[46:05] to do anything, he has to do an exam
[46:09] first
[46:11] and see what's wrong with you.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Once he's aware of your situation,
[46:19] then he can prescribe a medicine.
[46:24] Are you there with me? Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; So it is very important.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; The selfawwareness in a Christian's life
[46:33] is a very very important.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And for you to know,
[46:45] you have to check yourself up,
[46:49] you need to do a self inventory.
[46:52] Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. For you to know your condition,
[46:56] for you to be aware of your condition,
[46:59] you have to do the inventory.
[47:04] Are you there with me? Do you
[47:06] understand?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Is that clear?
[47:11] We are at the end of the year,
[47:15] isn't it?
[47:17] I think in one week or two we're going
[47:20] to turn the page of 2025.
[47:27] But if you go those who working for the
[47:30] company or those who have companies,
[47:35] when we reach December 31st,
[47:39] they need to close the book
[47:44] for 2025.
[47:50] Why? because the company
[47:54] has to know
[47:56] how the business was doing for the
[47:58] entire year.
[48:03] Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Even those who have a stock in their
[48:07] storage,
[48:10] doing business, buying, selling, buying.
[48:15] So you only writing your book I bought
[48:18] this amount I sold this amount. Yeah but
[48:22] that's what what you are writing on the
[48:24] paper but the reality you have to go
[48:28] check physically
[48:30] because you don't know maybe a thief
[48:33] stole something
[48:36] but you in your book oh I bought 100 I
[48:40] sold 50 that means I have 50 left.
[48:45] start the book.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; But the reality you need to do
[48:50] inventory.
[48:52] So when you do the inventory,
[48:54] then you're going to be aware
[48:58] of the true situation.
[49:02] Are you there church? And the businesses
[49:06] the accountant people
[49:09] in this period they are busy and until
[49:14] next year they are busy closing the
[49:17] book. They need to report
[49:22] to the stakeholders
[49:26] the prospect investors
[49:30] the situation of the business.
[49:34] So when everything is done
[49:37] then you have the knowledge of the true
[49:42] situation of the business.
[49:46] Are you there with me church? And us
[49:49] also Christians as the year ending
[49:54] it's not about turning the page.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Oh 2025 is finished. Now is 2020
[50:04] 26.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[50:07] We have to know
[50:09] how I have walked
[50:13] through this 2025
[50:17] as the years ending
[50:19] knowing my situation,
[50:22] my weaknesses.
[50:24] How did I work?
[50:26] Am I in the Lord
[50:29] or am I outside? What is not going good
[50:33] with me?
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; And we do that through the word of God.
[50:41] The word of God is the mirror. So we
[50:45] heard the word of God the entire year.
[50:48] All the knowledges that we have. Now we
[50:52] have to do some reconciliation
[50:54] because if you don't know your true
[50:57] situation,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; you're not going to do some corrections,
[51:04] do some adjustment.
[51:07] That's why people of the business they
[51:10] do some inventory.
[51:12] They said then when they find
[51:15] discrepancies
[51:18] the difference
[51:20] between what they have on the book
[51:24] and what they have in in reality
[51:27] physically.
[51:30] If they find some differences,
[51:34] they have to do the adjustment,
[51:38] some correction.
[51:41] But to do that, you have to know, you
[51:44] have to be aware of the true situation.
[51:49] Are you there with me church also as a
[51:52] Christian as the yet ending?
[51:56] We don't just turn the page.
[51:59] Amen. Amen. We have to be aware.
[52:04] Am I really a Christian?
[52:07] Am I really a Christian?
[52:09] Am I doing some progress?
[52:13] Am I moving with the Lord?
[52:17] I'm backsliding.
[52:20] Are you there with me church? So tonight
[52:23] we are calling upon each and every one
[52:25] of us
[52:28] to do self inventory.
[52:32] Amen. As the year ending,
[52:36] how was the year 2025?
[52:40] Did I live Christian life? Did I
[52:43] progress with the Lord?
[52:45] Did I regress with the Lord?
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you find that true
[52:51] situation of yourself,
[52:53] when you are aware of your situation,
[52:59] then you can adjust
[53:02] where you find yourself short.
[53:08] Are you there, church? This year, I
[53:11] didn't pray like I was supposed to.
[53:15] Lord help me 2026
[53:19] I have to dedicate myself in.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; This year I didn't pay my tithe. Lord I
[53:29] am a thief father. Oh father forgive me.
[53:33] Oh father I promise help me. 2026
[53:38] I have to be a genuine Christian and pay
[53:40] my dues. Lord, this year I was running
[53:45] away from the church. This year I was
[53:48] not a dedicated Christian, Father, but
[53:51] you have given me grace. You have kept
[53:54] me alive until today father as the yet
[53:58] ending. I am a promising if you help me
[54:02] father I'm going to adjust my life.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Are you the church? Oh father, I find
[54:08] myself this year. I had a lot of
[54:12] problems. Oh father, I have a lot of
[54:14] enemies. I didn't talk to my brother.
[54:18] I'm not getting along with this one.
[54:20] Getting along with that one. Father, as
[54:22] the year ended, I am a promising Lord to
[54:26] fix my life, to see my brother to fix
[54:30] it, to see my sister fix it. And I am
[54:34] promising, Father, if you keep me, if
[54:36] you protect me, 2026,
[54:40] I'm going to do my best to live as a
[54:43] Christian.
[54:45] Amen. Amen. But to come to that
[54:47] conclusion,
[54:48] you have to be aware.
[54:53] Are you there with me, church?
[54:56] We just don't turn page like that.
[54:59] That's why Jesus in the Bible in the
[55:01] revelation
[55:03] is blaming the church.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Us.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; So if you are not aware
[55:16] that means you are suffering with
[55:18] amnesia.
[55:22] Are you there church? For you to act,
[55:26] you have to know. That's why they said
[55:30] information,
[55:32] knowledge is power.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Are you there? And you knowing your true
[55:41] situation,
[55:43] where you are standing with the word of
[55:45] God,
[55:47] when you know it, it's going to help you
[55:50] to adjust where you find yourself short.
[55:55] Do not be happy. Oh, 20 2026 is coming.
[56:00] Yes. But are you going to enter in that
[56:02] new year like that?
[56:06] Always the same.
[56:09] Yes, we do make mistake.
[56:11] But we have to do some inventory.
[56:15] Realize I fell here. I fell here. I fell
[56:20] here. I fell here. I didn't do this
[56:23] correctly. But Lord, I am promising if
[56:26] you help me, I am aware of my situation.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; I want to be a better Christian. And to
[56:33] be aware, take every word that you know
[56:40] and compare our life.
[56:44] Are you there, church? Do you understand
[56:46] where we heading to?
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; The yet ending.
[56:51] Yes, I believe all of us we're going to
[56:55] enter in 202
[56:57] that there is no doubt about it. But
[57:00] despite that, we don't know what 2026
[57:06] keeping for us, we don't know.
[57:10] Amen. Amen. We are not Christian here in
[57:12] the church but outside living a worthy
[57:17] life.
[57:19] No,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; it is a time
[57:22] &gt;&gt; to pose as the year ending. We're
[57:26] calling on all of us,
[57:29] myself included.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; How was 2025?
[57:37] Are you there, church?
[57:43] Anything can happen anytime.
[57:47] We don't know.
[57:49] What waiting for us in 2026?
[57:53] Anything can happen
[57:56] in 2026.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; In 2025,
[58:00] all of us we going it. We already going
[58:03] there, but we don't know what's waiting
[58:06] for us in 2026.
[58:10] Amen, brother. It the end of the year.
[58:18] Are you there? Are you there? If those
[58:22] worldly people,
[58:24] those businesses
[58:26] need to pause
[58:28] and realize and be aware of their
[58:32] situation.
[58:34] As as a Christian, we need also to be
[58:38] aware.
[58:40] Are you there, church? Are you there?
[58:43] Remember
[58:45] there is two person that you can never
[58:47] lie.
[58:49] God and yourself. You know if you are a
[58:53] Christian or not. You know yourself.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And remember we've seen I think two
[59:03] weeks ago
[59:05] about the question
[59:08] who am I a prisoner? To whom am I a
[59:11] prisoner?
[59:12] Even for you to answer that question
[59:17] a self inventory.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; When you do the inventory
[59:29] then you can respond to that question.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; I am a God prisoner
[59:38] or the devil's prison. And remember
[59:41] said, you're not going to live for
[59:43] yourself. You are bound to be one
[59:47] person's prison.
[59:52] You can't be prison of God and prison of
[59:55] the devil at the same time.
[59:59] No. And you can't be neutral. There is
[1:00:03] no neutral because there are only two
[1:00:06] powers
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; controlling this world
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; and you have to belong to one of those.
[1:00:17] Where are you standing at?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; How was your Christian experience in
[1:00:25] this year 2025?
[1:00:35] So it require
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; to do self inventory.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? Tonight church we
[1:00:44] are called
[1:00:47] as the word of God is moving.
[1:00:50] Let us get inside ourself
[1:00:54] and do our inventory
[1:00:57] wherever we find ourselves.
[1:01:00] Then we ask for God's mercy
[1:01:04] as this year's ending.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; If I never been a good Christian,
[1:01:10] father, I would like to be one
[1:01:13] in 2026.
[1:01:16] Father, please help me.
[1:01:19] Are you there church? Are you the
[1:01:21] church?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; But brother Richard, you talking about
[1:01:27] selfawareness.
[1:01:28] self awareness.
[1:01:32] According to the dictionary here,
[1:01:36] what selfawwareness means
[1:01:39] in general?
[1:01:41] Selfawareness
[1:01:44] is the ability to see yourself clearly
[1:01:48] and objectively
[1:01:51] through the reflection and
[1:01:54] introspection.
[1:01:57] General
[1:02:02] itility
[1:02:13] from the inside
[1:02:16] that ability
[1:02:18] to see yourself
[1:02:20] clearly. And how are you going to see
[1:02:22] yourself in the glass of the weight of
[1:02:26] God?
[1:02:28] in the mirror of the word of God.
[1:02:33] Amen. Amen. You take the word which is a
[1:02:36] mirror and you look through it
[1:02:41] to see yourself
[1:02:44] where am I standing
[1:02:48] clearly and you can do that only
[1:02:52] yourself alone.
[1:02:56] Only you and God
[1:02:59] know that.
[1:03:02] Amen. Church,
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; are you there with me?
[1:03:06] Please, my brothers and sisters,
[1:03:09] this world, it's ending.
[1:03:14] It's already ending.
[1:03:16] Whatsoever we have lost.
[1:03:20] As you read in Luke, as we're going to
[1:03:22] read as well, Anything that you have
[1:03:26] lost,
[1:03:28] how are you going to realize that I lost
[1:03:30] this? I lost my prayer life, I lost my
[1:03:34] fellowship with God, I lost this, I lost
[1:03:39] that. If you to do self inventory,
[1:03:48] even this woman here in the Bible, for
[1:03:52] her to start searching and sweeping, she
[1:03:56] has to be aware
[1:04:00] of what she has lost.
[1:04:06] She has a face to be aware of a
[1:04:08] situation.
[1:04:13] of her situation
[1:04:15] I'm losing this
[1:04:19] then you can take the action
[1:04:23] of sweeping
[1:04:27] the thing that you have lost
[1:04:31] my brothers and sisters
[1:04:34] what have you lost this year
[1:04:38] as the years ended
[1:04:40] What have you lost?
[1:04:43] Are you aware of what you have lost?
[1:04:48] Are we right with the Lord?
[1:04:52] If the rapture takes place even tonight
[1:04:57] though we know but I'm saying it's
[1:04:59] between 6 and 9 in the morning
[1:05:06] which time I don't know [laughter]
[1:05:08] which time America time Africa time
[1:05:13] eastern China time I don't know but what
[1:05:16] I know between 6 and 9 whatever the case
[1:05:21] brother If that takes place,
[1:05:25] are we ready?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Richard, are you ready?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Goodness, are you ready?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Are we ready?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; What have we lost?
[1:05:44] Are you the church
[1:05:48] to find what you have lost?
[1:05:51] You have to be aware of your situation.
[1:05:55] I am insisting here.
[1:05:58] You cannot progress
[1:06:00] if you don't know what you're doing.
[1:06:03] That's why even the businesses
[1:06:06] they don't run only like that.
[1:06:10] The objective
[1:06:11] is to make the profit.
[1:06:15] They have to make sure [screaming]
[1:06:17] that they are making the profit.
[1:06:20] Otherwise, the business doesn't make
[1:06:23] sense.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And how did they do that? They have to
[1:06:28] do the report of how the business was
[1:06:31] run for the entire year.
[1:06:41] Are we there?
[1:06:43] Am I scaring you?
[1:06:47] This
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; must help us.
[1:06:51] I can preach to you about faith is good.
[1:06:55] But what next? [snorts]
[1:06:58] What next? We we not going just spoke.
[1:07:02] You supposed to preach us. We are tired.
[1:07:06] You have to encourage us. Encourage.
[1:07:09] Yes, I can encourage you. So what next?
[1:07:13] What next?
[1:07:14] Let us pause. Let us be on the ground.
[1:07:18] What is the true situation of our life?
[1:07:23] Where are we going?
[1:07:25] How our business is doing? Are we
[1:07:29] progressing?
[1:07:30] Are we back? Are we backsliding?
[1:07:34] Are we are we stopped somewhere?
[1:07:39] To be aware
[1:07:42] to be aware.
[1:07:44] When you are aware then you can take the
[1:07:47] action
[1:07:49] like this woman in the Bible. She was
[1:07:52] aware that I have lost this virtue.
[1:07:56] Which virtue have we lost in this year?
[1:08:02] If we realize, if we are aware of our
[1:08:05] true situation,
[1:08:07] then we can take the action. Otherwise,
[1:08:12] we're going to move like a blind like
[1:08:14] that
[1:08:17] and we're going to be surprised.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Are you there, Steven? Steven,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; there is a time.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. The parent they taking you to
[1:08:30] church.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; How old are you?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; 11.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; With 11 years old,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; you're not going to get in heaven behind
[1:08:42] the parent.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Only when you are you are not conscious
[1:08:47] of the reality of life.
[1:08:51] And those small those small there they
[1:08:55] don't know what they do. Their
[1:08:56] conscience is not really aware of what
[1:08:59] they doing.
[1:09:00] Then they are innocent. But at 11, oh
[1:09:05] the tape was already recording what you
[1:09:08] are doing for so long. So everything you
[1:09:11] are doing is recorded.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; That means you have to take conscience
[1:09:18] of yourself as you coming to church.
[1:09:24] Are you there? Even when you go to
[1:09:26] school, you have to be Christians. Don't
[1:09:30] say I'm 11. I'm old enough to be judged.
[1:09:34] To be judged.
[1:09:39] If we talk about 11 years old, what
[1:09:42] about us big mama and big papa?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; They knew the grandma, the grandmama,
[1:09:46] the grandpa.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Brother, let us pose.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Let us see the reality.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be running business
[1:09:59] pork pop like that.
[1:10:02] Where are we standing?
[1:10:08] But give us faith brother.
[1:10:10] Then then after then next
[1:10:14] faith will take you to to rapture.
[1:10:17] If there is not a Christian life in you,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; faith
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; without work
[1:10:34] is dead.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Faith
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; without work is dead.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Are you there, brother?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; The ending.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Don't think everything is going to be
[1:10:50] going like that so easily.
[1:10:54] Even the small boy they die too because
[1:10:57] they are
[1:11:00] rapture or death. So we don't know what
[1:11:03] waiting for us. We don't know. We need
[1:11:06] to be ready.
[1:11:09] Amen. Amen. So I am encouraging you to
[1:11:13] stop
[1:11:15] and do self inventory
[1:11:20] looking at my life I am missing here I
[1:11:24] am missing here I am missing here I have
[1:11:28] this year I didn't do good here same
[1:11:32] thing like as we going to school
[1:11:36] self evaluation
[1:11:41] If the Lord can give us the test or we
[1:11:45] need to pass the exam tonight,
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; what's going to be our report,
[1:11:53] our grade?
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; I know this kind of subject people need
[1:12:01] to be silent. Don't worry. I'm preaching
[1:12:04] for quite a while now. I know.
[1:12:08] [laughter]
[1:12:08] I have been preaching at the the year
[1:12:11] end so many times.
[1:12:15] I have I have preached so many time the
[1:12:17] service of the year and I know this kind
[1:12:20] of sermon and there must not be a lot of
[1:12:24] amen if this is the way it must be
[1:12:27] because everyone need to go back inside
[1:12:34] reality.
[1:12:35] It's not a group affair here.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a group affair.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Let readana.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; We're going to read in the sudden secret
[1:12:52] going away of the church.
[1:12:56] Do you understand?
[1:12:59] I think the way I explain it, it is
[1:13:02] enough for everyone to understand what
[1:13:05] you need to do. Isn't it clear?
[1:13:09] It is clear. It is simple.
[1:13:12] We have to realize our true situation.
[1:13:17] I am not doubting of your Christian
[1:13:19] life.
[1:13:20] No, no,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I don't have
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; I don't have a scale.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I change the
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I don't have
[1:13:34] [laughter] that. I have to to put back
[1:13:37] there those years they do this
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; moment to check I don't have that to to
[1:13:48] check if you are a Christian it doesn't
[1:13:50] belong to me
[1:13:55] to to check the level of God in you
[1:13:58] level of God in you
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; it belong to each and every one of us
[1:14:04] we know where we are standing.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Yes brother mistakes we will make
[1:14:12] but we must [clears throat] not remain
[1:14:14] in our mistakes.
[1:14:16] Are you there? Are you there?
[1:14:20] Wherever we find ourselves short we need
[1:14:23] to fix it.
[1:14:25] If we are not getting along I have a
[1:14:28] problem with my sister there my brother
[1:14:30] there. What if that person you hear not
[1:14:34] this year, this year we already closing.
[1:14:37] What if you hear next year, the very
[1:14:40] same person is no longer there
[1:14:43] in your heart.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; If you didn't love that person,
[1:14:48] I wonder
[1:14:51] maybe one of you one one will not be
[1:14:53] there. I don't know.
[1:14:57] So as we are leaving, let us get along.
[1:15:00] Ready
[1:15:02] to forgive.
[1:15:05] Ready to forgive. No matter what you
[1:15:07] have done unto me. Yes, I may cry. I may
[1:15:11] feel like.
[1:15:14] Yeah. But the end of the day, I am a
[1:15:16] Christian. I have to forgive.
[1:15:20] Are you there church?
[1:15:23] I have to forgive. I am forced by the
[1:15:26] word to forgive.
[1:15:28] And the forgiveness becomes a part of
[1:15:32] our life.
[1:15:34] What will I do? Just forgive.
[1:15:39] But don't take that. You can do evil to
[1:15:43] your brother and tell me brother the
[1:15:45] word said you must forgive. No, you are
[1:15:49] another side. Don't do that. The brother
[1:15:53] can forgive you but will not forget as a
[1:15:56] human being what you are.
[1:15:59] that that that's not good. But when it
[1:16:02] happened by mistake, we didn't plan it.
[1:16:07] We always remember
[1:16:10] we are Christians.
[1:16:12] We are bound to live together.
[1:16:15] We are bound to forgive one another.
[1:16:18] Amen. If we want the Lord to forgive us.
[1:16:22] Sudden secret going away of
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; preaching 58 October 12.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read uh paragraph
[1:16:31] [clears throat] six.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And we ask that this is brother's
[1:16:38] prayer. us that will just look upon us
[1:16:41] as we speak as
[1:16:45] and speak to us that
[1:16:50] who are here this evening should take
[1:16:54] inventory of our own situation.
[1:17:07] Are you brother?
[1:17:09] And we ask that you just look upon us
[1:17:12] and speak to us that we who are here
[1:17:17] tonight should take inventory of our own
[1:17:22] situation.
[1:17:33] Say to me,
[1:17:35] say one of the prophets
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; and try me and see if there be any evil
[1:17:43] in me.
[1:17:47] And then Lord in searching if you find
[1:17:51] that there is evil in us,
[1:17:56] purge us Lord as we humbly confess our
[1:18:00] sin and our evil doings.
[1:18:08] Are you there church please?
[1:18:11] and ask only that you remember us as you
[1:18:16] look at as you look at Jesus thy son
[1:18:24] who died to be a prosperation for our
[1:18:28] sins and our iniquity
[1:18:35] as we confess that we believe that he
[1:18:38] died for for this purpose and rose
[1:18:42] again. That would have the great
[1:18:45] privilege of doing this.
[1:18:56] Grant it Lord and speak to us through
[1:19:00] thy written word as we wait further
[1:19:04] to hear from you. In the name of Jesus,
[1:19:09] we pray
[1:19:11] amen. Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; The seal of God.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Preaching 54
[1:19:18] May 14.
[1:19:20] So you see there
[1:19:22] saying we take inventory for our own
[1:19:26] situation.
[1:19:30] Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we do that and we find our
[1:19:34] our shortcomings,
[1:19:37] we cry to the Lord
[1:19:40] that the correction that we doing. But
[1:19:43] you cannot cry if you don't know your
[1:19:46] your true situation.
[1:19:50] You cannot cry to the Lord for help even
[1:19:54] to ask a help.
[1:19:57] You have to know that I'm short here.
[1:20:00] Then I need help. Even to ask a brother
[1:20:03] to help you, you have to know because
[1:20:06] you have to tell him what help you need.
[1:20:12] You have to be aware of your situation
[1:20:14] for you to ask help
[1:20:17] because help me help me. Yes, I'm here.
[1:20:22] What do you want me to help you with?
[1:20:26] So if you don't know what you need help
[1:20:29] about,
[1:20:32] how the Lord can help you.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; So to know what you need to be aware of
[1:20:38] your situation, you need self inventory
[1:20:46] as businesses are doing that
[1:20:49] prepare all their financial report.
[1:20:55] us also as the year is ending. Let us do
[1:20:59] inventory to be aware of our Christian.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 289.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; I know you say he said you are rich and
[1:21:18] had a need of nothing.
[1:21:22] talking to the church
[1:21:24] said you said I'm rich I have a need of
[1:21:29] nothing
[1:21:30] we are greater organization
[1:21:34] and you don't know what you don't know
[1:21:37] that you are wretched
[1:21:40] poor
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; miserable blond naked and they don't
[1:21:47] know it
[1:21:49] if a man is in that fix and knows it,
[1:22:00] he will help himself.
[1:22:07] If you are in that condition and you
[1:22:10] know it
[1:22:13] then you can be helped.
[1:22:18] Is this bad?
[1:22:21] For you to know your situation, then you
[1:22:24] need to do the inventory.
[1:22:26] You need to check your life through the
[1:22:29] mirror of the word
[1:22:32] as the earth ended.
[1:22:34] But
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; when you are that way
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and don't know it
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; and
[1:22:46] Christ said that the churches in this
[1:22:50] day will be that way and would know it.
[1:23:01] Are you there church? Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Are you the church
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; 290?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; P your spiritual being.
[1:23:16] P your spiritual being my dear my dear
[1:23:20] dear brother.
[1:23:25] P your soul as it was with a prayer and
[1:23:29] a saying.
[1:23:34] Lord Jesus,
[1:23:36] check [screaming] up on me.
[1:23:39] Let me take inventory tonight
[1:23:46] before I go to bed
[1:23:49] and find out what the matter with me.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Are you there? Is this brother?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Let me take inventory tonight
[1:24:04] before I go to bed
[1:24:07] and find
[1:24:10] found out what the matter with me.
[1:24:16] I've been professing for years and I
[1:24:19] don't see these things that Jesus said.
[1:24:28] that he will be with me that he would be
[1:24:33] with me
[1:24:36] and these things will go on
[1:24:41] I don't see it
[1:24:44] what the m Lord Jesus
[1:24:51] do you see the person doing inventory
[1:24:55] I am a Christian. I've been professing
[1:24:57] for so long. Yes. But I'm not seeing
[1:25:00] this. The word say as a Christian I have
[1:25:05] to live this way. I have to live that
[1:25:07] way. But why am I not seeing them?
[1:25:11] The word say as a Christian I must not
[1:25:15] supposed to be stealing.
[1:25:17] As a Christian I must not be lusting. As
[1:25:20] a Christian once I'm married
[1:25:25] it finish no divorce not looking to
[1:25:29] another woman
[1:25:31] faithful to my wife
[1:25:33] and the s on
[1:25:36] why am I not seeing these things
[1:25:40] with me Lord Jesus
[1:25:51] 291.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Be honest.
[1:25:56] [applause]
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Be honest.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Be sincere.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Come down and talk to him
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; as a face to face with a brother
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; with a brother.
[1:26:12] He re He will reveal you.
[1:26:15] He will tell you,
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; tear your soul apart and laid out there.
[1:26:24] Lord Jesus, if it cost me my family,
[1:26:30] if it cost me my life, if it cost my
[1:26:34] job, if it cost my membership,
[1:26:38] if it cost my prestige in this city,
[1:26:42] I'll take the way with the Lord.
[1:26:47] Despise few
[1:26:53] Are you there church? No matter what can
[1:26:57] cost you
[1:27:00] when you realize your situation,
[1:27:02] I am short here. I have done what is
[1:27:06] wrong.
[1:27:07] I need to fix it. But if you fix it, it
[1:27:11] going to cost your marriage.
[1:27:14] If it has to cost my marriage, let me
[1:27:17] fix it and cost my marriage. If it going
[1:27:20] to cost my life, let me fix it and let
[1:27:24] my life be gone.
[1:27:27] Are you the church?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Only you
[1:27:33] only me and brother saying be honest,
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; be sincere.
[1:27:43] Now remember
[1:27:45] Jesus said, "Straight is the gate and
[1:27:49] the narrow is the way,
[1:27:52] but few dare be that will find it.
[1:27:58] How broad is the way that leads to
[1:28:01] destruction,
[1:28:04] a million more
[1:28:08] 54 in
[1:28:11] broad is the gate that leads to
[1:28:14] destruction.
[1:28:17] Many dare be that go in there it
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; He that will lose his life for my sake
[1:28:29] shall find it.
[1:28:32] He that loves his he that loves father,
[1:28:37] mother, sister, brother or anything
[1:28:42] better than me is not worthy to be
[1:28:45] called mine. Amen.
[1:28:54] Are we ready to do that inventory
[1:28:57] we love the most?
[1:29:02] He will put his hand on a plow and start
[1:29:06] forward. Even 10 look back is not worthy
[1:29:10] the time. Brother,
[1:29:19] one of these days the last Holy Ghost
[1:29:23] anointing gospel sermon will be
[1:29:25] preached.
[1:29:29] One of these days the last gun will be
[1:29:32] fired.
[1:29:35] One of these day the last song will be
[1:29:37] sung.
[1:29:40] One of these day the last prayer will be
[1:29:43] prayed.
[1:29:45] One of these days the doors of the
[1:29:48] tabernacle will be closed the last time.
[1:29:57] The Bible will be closed on the purpose
[1:30:04] and you'll stand in the presence of God
[1:30:10] to give an account for what you you've
[1:30:14] heard tonight.
[1:30:19] What then? What then? The the the great
[1:30:23] book is open. What then?
[1:30:28] When tonight comes on record, what then?
[1:30:35] And tonight will come on record
[1:30:39] that means that day in the presence of
[1:30:42] the Lord you see myself preaching these
[1:30:46] days that's what I'm saying tonight
[1:30:52] as it recorded
[1:30:54] will come up there and you find that you
[1:30:57] are hearing the very same thing
[1:31:01] then what Then
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; you've heard tonight. What then? What
[1:31:08] then? When the great book is open, what
[1:31:12] then?
[1:31:14] When tonight comes on record, what then?
[1:31:19] As the song say, what then?
[1:31:22] When the great book is open, what then?
[1:31:26] And the ones that rejected the savior
[1:31:29] today will be asked to give a reason.
[1:31:32] What today?
[1:31:38] Your job stood in your way. Your parent
[1:31:42] stood in your way.
[1:31:47] Your boyfriend stood in your way.
[1:31:51] Your girlfriend stood in your way.
[1:31:55] Your church stood in the way.
[1:31:58] What then? What then? When the great
[1:32:01] book is open, what then?
[1:32:04] When the ones rejecting this message
[1:32:08] tonight, you're going to ask to give a
[1:32:11] reason. What then?
[1:32:17] What are you going to do about it?
[1:32:21] You know what the mark of the beast is.
[1:32:26] You know what the seal of God is.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It
[1:32:32] happened to you.
[1:32:39] Are you there to tonight church?
[1:32:42] Are you there tonight church?
[1:32:45] I'm saying it's up on you.
[1:32:52] I'm going to run [clears throat]
[1:32:57] in the preaching the second coming of
[1:32:59] the Lord
[1:33:02] preaching 57 April 17 paragraph 59
[1:33:08] I'm going to skip so many thing here
[1:33:11] let me start uh
[1:33:16] oh let me skip this
[1:33:18] We about to read what we read in Luke
[1:33:20] about that woman with a lost coin, but
[1:33:23] I'll skip some. Let me start on
[1:33:27] paragraph 58.
[1:33:31] Each of those coins
[1:33:35] if only if I if we only have time,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; but I haven't like myself tonight. I
[1:33:43] haven't.
[1:33:45] I'm going to try to keep my word as as
[1:33:49] close as possible.
[1:33:55] Let's go to 59.
[1:33:57] If you want to look it up,
[1:34:02] look in Galatians 5. You found out that
[1:34:07] that woman represented the church. The
[1:34:11] woman sweeping to find the lost
[1:34:14] represent the church where we read in
[1:34:15] Luke.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Church is a nouse
[1:34:21] wife to Christ.
[1:34:26] And the tablet that the church is
[1:34:30] possessed to where is found in Galatians
[1:34:33] 5
[1:34:36] which is love, joy, peace,
[1:34:40] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[1:34:42] gentleness, patience that the tablet
[1:34:45] that supposed to be worn in the church,
[1:34:51] brotherly love, kindness, fellowship
[1:34:54] ship.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And this woman when he must have been
[1:34:58] along about the duck that she realized
[1:35:01] that she had lost one of the coins.
[1:35:08] So the big thing is about realizing
[1:35:16] are you there church?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Because you you're not going to seek for
[1:35:20] something that you don't know that you
[1:35:22] lost.
[1:35:27] to try to fund it. You have to recognize
[1:35:32] that selfawareness
[1:35:36] that they have lost this
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; then you're going to find it.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Are you there church
[1:35:46] 60?
[1:35:48] Oh,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; if there ever was a time that the church
[1:35:53] ought to take inventory to find out if
[1:35:58] you have got all the coins on. Oh.
[1:36:07] Oh. If there ever was a time that the
[1:36:12] church ought to take inventory to find
[1:36:16] out if you have got all the coins on.
[1:36:28] So mentioned all those drag right.
[1:36:34] What have you lost? It should be now.
[1:36:38] And if there is time it should be now.
[1:36:43] It getting dark.
[1:36:46] The very heart and the clouds of
[1:36:49] destroying civilization is hanging over
[1:36:52] the earth.
[1:36:59] on every hand.
[1:37:03] We are living in the tremendous time
[1:37:07] when there is weakness and wicked
[1:37:10] wickedness.
[1:37:12] People who go who go to church
[1:37:18] for a share.
[1:37:23] People who go to church
[1:37:26] to try to hide from their meanness.
[1:37:32] People who go to church and profess
[1:37:36] Christianity
[1:37:38] and live like the rest of the world
[1:37:43] thinking,
[1:37:45] smoking, tumbling,
[1:37:48] too many morality.
[1:37:52] Women immorally dressed,
[1:37:57] wearing the clothes that they to wear
[1:38:05] in their own dressing room. wearing the
[1:38:09] the clothes that they're not supposed to
[1:38:12] wear in their own dressing room
[1:38:21] out on the street before public
[1:38:27] even in the church.
[1:38:30] I don't want to be responsible
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; for somebody to last after me.
[1:38:38] then cover your body.
[1:38:41] That story of wearing a boot,
[1:38:45] wearing a boot. You wear a boot, boots,
[1:38:48] boots, boots. You wear a boot and the
[1:38:52] the skate is here.
[1:38:54] All this is open.
[1:38:58] Keep it for your husband.
[1:39:00] If you are not married and sister,
[1:39:04] keep it for your husband to be.
[1:39:08] I'm not saying you wearing that. It's
[1:39:10] just an example, right? That will repeat
[1:39:13] it.
[1:39:15] The clothes that you cannot even wear in
[1:39:17] your your room, you wear it in the
[1:39:19] church.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Then you said, "Ah, look at the brother.
[1:39:24] They looking at me. You are the problem.
[1:39:27] That's why the brothers are looking at
[1:39:29] me. Oh, those brothers, they are wly
[1:39:33] brothers.
[1:39:34] They are lasting sisters. How they
[1:39:37] cannot last? Because you you just open
[1:39:39] your body like that. You think the eyes
[1:39:42] you may be Christian, you may be
[1:39:44] brother.
[1:39:46] But when the eyes is there to see
[1:39:52] the bad thing is the second look.
[1:39:57] So let us hide our body. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:06] That's the way you are. Even myself, I
[1:40:10] preach you. I preach to myself.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I preach you. You go. I
[1:40:20] preach to myself. I go to my knees as
[1:40:23] well. Yes, sir.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; All of us. We need to get to heaven.
[1:40:29] Amen.
[1:40:31] Amen.
[1:40:34] So husband
[1:40:35] watch your wife too.
[1:40:38] I hope when you come out all this
[1:40:43] here it see through nothing here.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; I wonder but the husband didn't see this
[1:40:49] going out here. Nothing. Oh it hot.
[1:40:52] [screaming] It hot. Can't you see it
[1:40:54] even here?
[1:40:58] Then you make a noise. I'm a man. You
[1:41:00] are
[1:41:02] You are not. If you are a man, you see
[1:41:05] when she's coming out, you say, "No,
[1:41:07] this one, go back. Go back."
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; I'm the one who's going to drive to
[1:41:11] church. Are you going to walk?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Then walk. When you going to the church
[1:41:16] is already finished
[1:41:19] from
[1:41:21] you walking. You don't You don't want to
[1:41:23] take me, I'm walking. But when I come
[1:41:25] here, the church is already finished.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we blame the brother for no
[1:41:33] reason.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Only God knows
[1:41:39] because he's the one who knows better
[1:41:41] each and every one of us. He's the one
[1:41:44] who knows even our intention.
[1:41:47] He's the one who knows everything.
[1:41:50] That's why sometimes
[1:41:52] sometimes you don't have to give any
[1:41:54] explanation because God said Lord
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:42:04] [clears throat]

[1:42:09] wearing clothes that they to wear in
[1:42:13] their own dressing room
[1:42:19] out on the treat before public
[1:42:23] and the brotherly love a king that
[1:42:27] passing almost.
[1:42:32] We have not lost one coin, but we've
[1:42:36] lost practically [screaming] every one
[1:42:39] of them
[1:42:45] and
[1:42:46] was getting night and remember
[1:42:50] husband will return. And if he found
[1:42:57] if he found her with one of those coins
[1:43:01] out
[1:43:03] It showed
[1:43:05] she had been marked a lot.
[1:43:14] What? What coins have we lost?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Are you the church?
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Are you the church?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I tell goodness

[1:43:31] Unless I didn't see when she wear her
[1:43:34] clothes, I'm the one who iron it most of
[1:43:38] the time.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; You You see, brother Richard, you are
[1:43:42] only a soldier. Look, but I'm not a

[1:44:33] something heavy down.
[1:44:43] I'm someone who talks too much. You
[1:44:45] starting to get lighter.
[1:44:52] What? What do you have?
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But she's a a girl that
[1:45:03] I take it
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; because I'm going to be the first

[1:45:44] theirel by the word of God.
[1:45:51] our purity, our loyalty, [screaming]
[1:45:54] our devotion.

[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; painted off Jezebel,
[1:46:14] everything in the calendar that rest on
[1:46:19] the world does.

[1:47:49] but Abraham never tell we're not going
[1:47:52] to tell because we don't know. Ah, we
[1:47:55] consider all of us as a Christian going
[1:47:57] to heaven.
[1:47:59] The kind of believer you are, only God
[1:48:02] knows. But for us, we treat one another
[1:48:06] as a brother in Christ, as a sister in
[1:48:09] Christ. and all of us going to heaven.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; The Christian church is associating in

[1:51:17] flying.
[1:51:20] They had a real house cleaning, house
[1:51:24] cleaning.
[1:51:27] The husband was about to come.
[1:51:32] And if he [screaming] caught her with
[1:51:35] that one corn out,
[1:51:40] she was a lot.
[1:51:44] How many coin have we lost?
[1:51:49] How many coins?
[1:51:51] Maybe you have lost your prayer coin.
[1:51:56] Maybe you have lost your zeal of the
[1:51:58] gospel corn.
[1:52:03] Which con have you lost?
[1:52:06] Which corn have I lost?
[1:52:10] You have to know that by doing self
[1:52:16] through the word of God
[1:52:18] as preaching. You searching yourself.
[1:52:23] I'm searching myself.

[1:52:39] But let let us say what I'm saying. It
[1:52:43] condemns me, I also go to my knees.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself knows.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's why that singer knows.
[1:52:58] That's why people say, "Yes, you know my
[1:53:01] heart. Oh, you know my heart." Sometimes
[1:53:05] we don't have to argue.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Don't argue.
[1:53:10] We make that mistake to argue for no
[1:53:12] reason. Most of the time it good. Don't
[1:53:16] argue. Just go on your knees. Oh Lord,
[1:53:20] you know my heart. You know my heart.
[1:53:23] You know my heart.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; 68.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:53:32] [laughter]
[1:53:33] The time is flying.
[1:53:36] Brother,
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; we the church of living God in 67.
[1:53:41] Brother, we the church of living God in
[1:53:44] this great hour we we are now living.
[1:53:53] It behooves us to check up,
[1:53:58] go before God,
[1:54:00] light the candle
[1:54:03] of the word of the gospel
[1:54:06] and examine yourselves
[1:54:09] and found out if we are not falling
[1:54:14] short
[1:54:17] and especially when we see all these
[1:54:21] things coming.
[1:54:24] We are at the end time.
[1:54:27] The coming of Christ is at the end.
[1:54:31] There is [screaming]
[1:54:32] not
[1:54:34] there is not another hope in the world
[1:54:38] for the church
[1:54:44] and it took the church and it look
[1:54:48] [screaming] the church is lonely.
[1:54:55] The church has no conscience no more.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; So you see our subject.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; You see our subject
[1:55:07] selfawareness
[1:55:10] in our Christian life. The church has no
[1:55:13] conscience no more.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; You can hardly wake them up.
[1:55:22] The Bible says they will come in that
[1:55:25] condition when they say
[1:55:31] when they say, "Lord, our Lord delays
[1:55:36] his coming
[1:55:39] and they be devouring and biting one
[1:55:44] another."
[1:55:49] one after another biting.
[1:55:53] I respect
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; a person who can come to me and tell me
[1:55:59] brother you are wrong here. You have
[1:56:02] done wrong here. Look what I have
[1:56:05] against you.
[1:56:07] That kind of person I respect him. I'm
[1:56:11] not going to argue. If I know what
[1:56:13] you're saying is true, I'm going to
[1:56:14] repent. But not those who going to say
[1:56:17] at your back. But when you meet
[1:56:21] [laughter]
[1:56:22] David,
[1:56:25] the replacement of brother,
[1:56:29] you have something against me.
[1:56:33] No. Tell me what you think I'm wrong.
[1:56:37] Come and d that the word. Come tell me
[1:56:39] what you think I'm wrong.
[1:56:42] and let us talk about it. At the end of
[1:56:45] the day, you think I'm going to repent,
[1:56:47] maybe you going to repent.
[1:56:51] May the Lord help us. We don't have to
[1:56:53] be bite biters.
[1:56:59] Oh Lord, you know, you know, may the
[1:57:03] Lord help us.
[1:57:08] And they'll be devouring and biting one
[1:57:11] another
[1:57:13] and so forth and fighting around
[1:57:17] just exactly that hour.
[1:57:22] Everything is ready. The pages turned
[1:57:27] as it was like that and it really
[1:57:32] the coming
[1:57:34] of the Lord.
[1:57:38] Now 71.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Now she had a house cleaning time.
[1:57:47] She scrubed the floor. She swept the
[1:57:50] wall.
[1:57:53] She looked down to the co webs
[1:57:58] until she found what she had lost.
[1:58:05] And when she did,

[2:01:18] used to be a holy place.
[2:01:22] The people used to be a holy people
[2:01:26] that went there.
[2:01:28] But look at them today.
[2:01:32] Like look like go like can't tell one
[2:01:39] other
[2:01:42] just
[2:01:52] This is what they say. This thing in the
[2:01:55] message as well

[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, even in our
[2:02:08] marital relation,
[2:02:12] you see
[2:02:14] husband and wife, they don't talk
[2:02:18] for so many days.
[2:02:20] Ah, that means you don't pray together.
[2:02:26] That means the family is broken.
[2:02:30] Oh God help us.
[2:02:33] That may be the corn we have lost.

[2:03:09] Notice if that little deer
[2:03:13] when he get away I'm closing now. In
[2:03:17] case you think it's time, but when that
[2:03:21] little deer can't get away, what
[2:03:24] happened? When he got bleeding,
[2:03:28] he goes to test.
[2:03:31] He's got to find water.
[2:03:34] What David said
[2:03:37] as a heart test of the the water book
[2:03:43] is wounded. His life is bleeding out of
[2:03:47] him. Heart test for water.
[2:03:51] My soul taste after thee. God, if that
[2:03:55] little
[2:03:57] can find water, he's going to die. But
[2:04:01] if he can find water, he will survive
[2:04:04] it. Oh God, I will every soul in here
[2:04:10] tonight see the wound of Satan.
[2:04:16] Oh God, I
[2:04:20] every soul here tonight
[2:04:23] will see the wounds of Satan
[2:04:28] where the devil has wounded you.
[2:04:34] He wounded you by taking your prayer
[2:04:35] life.
[2:04:37] He wounded you by by by putting hatred.
[2:04:43] Oh, that's why I always pray. Lord, no
[2:04:47] matter what, give me a Christian
[2:04:50] feeling.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; No matter what, give me a Christian
[2:04:55] feeling. Even when I'm suffering. Even
[2:04:58] when I'm crying, oh Lord, give me a good
[2:05:03] Christian feeling.
[2:05:11] In such way when even somebody has has
[2:05:15] hurt me
[2:05:17] I grieve I I cry but Lord give me
[2:05:21] Christian feeling.
[2:05:24] Amen. Amen. So when I see my brother God
[2:05:28] bless you not only by m but going deep
[2:05:31] in prayer forcing myself to forget
[2:05:36] and to forgive
[2:05:39] though I am suffering
[2:05:43] what the devil has wounded you
[2:05:47] say but brotherham I haven't I've got
[2:05:51] all the way well child you are wounded
[2:06:04] where the devil has wounded you, what
[2:06:07] the devil has taken out from you.
[2:06:11] To know that you have to do self
[2:06:14] infantry.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:06:34] you are wounded.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Does your soul taste for God?
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; You see, as that heart is wounded, he
[2:06:43] has to run to find water.
[2:06:47] Pastor Pastor F has explained it so many
[2:06:49] times. When the the deer is wounded,
[2:06:53] find water for you to run and find
[2:06:56] water. You have to be aware
[2:07:00] that I am a wounded
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; the
[2:07:05] run to find water because it's wounded
[2:07:09] because he's aware that I am wounded. If
[2:07:13] I don't find water, I'm going to die.
[2:07:18] But you, the devil has wounded you. The
[2:07:21] devil has wounded you. By putting
[2:07:24] hatred, the devil has wounded you by
[2:07:27] taking your prayer life. The devil has
[2:07:30] wounded you by pushing you to live as a
[2:07:33] pagan.
[2:07:36] The thing you have to do, [screaming]
[2:07:38] you have to run and find water. And the
[2:07:42] God, his word is the water for you to
[2:07:47] run. You have to be aware.
[2:07:52] a blessing.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; If you are not aware,
[2:08:01] he's not aware that is wounded. He's
[2:08:05] going to die.
[2:08:07] He's running to find water. He's running
[2:08:10] to find help because he's aware
[2:08:15] that I am wounded. But us Christian, the
[2:08:20] devil has wounded us. We are not aware.
[2:08:23] If you are not aware, how are you going
[2:08:25] to find help?
[2:08:29] Are you the church? Self inventory.
[2:08:33] When you do self inventory, then you're
[2:08:37] going to be aware
[2:08:39] of your situation. And when you are
[2:08:41] aware of your situation, you're going to
[2:08:44] find help.
[2:08:47] Are you the church? The year is ending.
[2:08:52] I've preached the service of the year
[2:08:54] and so many years I know years
[2:08:59] this kind of things while the years
[2:09:02] ending
[2:09:05] don't fly let us get on the ground
[2:09:15] but all these things has the end if the
[2:09:18] reality is a different to our dancing.
[2:09:23] We if our dance is a different of our
[2:09:27] life, we lying to ourselves.
[2:09:32] I better don't dance.
[2:09:35] But I am lying with the word of God.
[2:09:40] Are you the church?
[2:09:42] Are you the church?
[2:09:45] You have to be aware that I'm
[2:09:49] saying boy you are wounded.
[2:09:52] You have to be aware where the devil has
[2:09:54] wounded you.
[2:10:12] I have to close.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; The rest
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; may the God
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; put it in our heart
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; and help us to we're going to take this
[2:10:24] short one which going to help us to
[2:10:26] pray. I already finished. It's a short
[2:10:28] one
[2:10:32] him preaching 60 July 12
[2:10:37] paragraph 57. I'm skipping a lot to go
[2:10:39] down. [snorts]
[2:10:41] What we need today
[2:10:44] is a real genuine cleaning up.
[2:10:52] Are you there with me? Are you there
[2:10:54] church? Oh Richard, you are so boring
[2:10:57] today. You see I came with all my
[2:11:00] problem.
[2:11:02] The problem has the end. It it's going
[2:11:05] to end one day. But if you are not right
[2:11:08] with God with your problems, You're
[2:11:11] going to die twice. You die with your
[2:11:14] problem. At the end, you die again.
[2:11:20] You receive the armor of the word.
[2:11:24] The armor.
[2:11:26] You and I, we correct ourselves.
[2:11:30] And even if our problem is not solved
[2:11:33] here, one of these days this world is
[2:11:36] going to finish. And we're going to
[2:11:38] forget all our problem forever.
[2:11:42] What we need today is a real genuine
[2:11:45] cleaning up
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost fil church
[2:11:54] backed up with the Holy Ghost
[2:11:58] ready
[2:12:00] filled and with God's Holy Spirit.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe that.
[2:12:10] If we fail to preach it,
[2:12:14] if we fail to preach it,
[2:12:17] God will raise up the Baptist
[2:12:22] or Presbyterian
[2:12:24] or somebody to do it.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; He certainly will
[2:12:34] have a church there without spot or
[2:12:38] wrinkle.
[2:12:42] He will do it. So brethren,
[2:12:46] let just shake ourselves
[2:12:49] and rise out and rise out. Rise out of
[2:12:55] the dust
[2:12:58] and shake ourselves
[2:13:01] and get in the great all the gospel way.
[2:13:09] and match up the highway.
[2:13:14] That the only thing to do
[2:13:18] is all one Christian soldiers.
[2:13:23] No time [screaming] to slack
[2:13:28] or be easy now.
[2:13:31] Let's start going for the kingdom of
[2:13:34] God.

[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; The year is ending.
[2:13:46] Inventory

[2:13:51] When you do that, you are aware of your
[2:13:54] condition.
[2:13:56] Like they

[2:14:00] then you learn to worry.

[2:14:50] No time to slack. By what I'm saying, no
[2:14:53] time to slack.

[2:14:58] what's waiting for us.
[2:15:01] 2026.

[2:15:05] us get ready, brother. Let us get ready,

[2:20:18] Beloved, beloved Jesus, we say thank you
[2:20:21] tonight
[2:20:23] [music]
[2:20:25] because we ask you to talk to us and you
[2:20:26] talk to us. [music]
[2:20:29] The time in which we living,
[2:20:32] it's a time of emergency,
[2:20:36] as the preacher [music] said from the
[2:20:38] word.
[2:20:40] Lord, we don't know what's 2026 hold for
[2:20:44] us,
[2:20:46] the rapture can come.
[2:20:49] The Bible says
[2:20:54] how much that is worth for a man to gain
[2:20:57] or the entire world and lost his soul.
[2:21:01] But we come to church for everything to
[2:21:04] fix our lives
[2:21:08] to be shaped
[2:21:10] according to thy will Lord
[2:21:13] so that we can go to heavens.
[2:21:15] [music]
[2:21:17] Elijah stay with Elisha stay with Elijah
[2:21:20] many years
[2:21:24] so he can be shaped
[2:21:26] [music]
[2:21:28] so he can be able to work
[2:21:32] the same
[2:21:33] larger world. We come also to church
[2:21:36] [music]
[2:21:37] the Lord according to your will
[2:21:41] so you can go to heaven.
[2:21:43] Your word has been preached. [music]
[2:21:47] We want to to search ourself every day.
[2:21:51] We have to search ourself every day so
[2:21:54] that we can go to heaven
[2:21:57] where we have short
[2:22:00] and pass to fix the Lord
[2:22:03] so we can go to heaven. The prophet said
[2:22:06] [music]
[2:22:08] in the last uh quote that we read,
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have to clean up
[2:22:15] our lives
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; so we [music] can light up with the
[2:22:21] word.
[2:22:24] Yahweh, this is the time
[2:22:28] that we really need
[2:22:30] [music]
[2:22:32] to be searched.
[2:22:35] We need the Lord to clean up our lives
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; because we don't know what tomorrow
[2:22:42] holds
[2:22:46] [music]
[2:22:50] a church.
[2:22:53] that servant that you use, our brother
[2:22:55] Richard, [music]
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; bless his ministry,
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; bless our pastor,
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; bless each and every every member of
[2:23:03] this church
[2:23:05] as we receive this word.
[2:23:08] We want to go out from here, Lord
[2:23:11] so we can be meditating about it, so we
[2:23:15] can know
[2:23:17] the time ahead of us,
[2:23:19] it's no longer.
[2:23:22] That's why
[2:23:24] each in every one of us in what we can
[2:23:28] [music]
[2:23:29] we want to fix our lives so we can go to
[2:23:32] heaven
