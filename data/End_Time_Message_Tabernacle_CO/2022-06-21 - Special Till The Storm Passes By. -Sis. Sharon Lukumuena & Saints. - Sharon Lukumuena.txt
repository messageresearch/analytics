TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] out on the waters a storm raging high the waters are round travelled at night and fear filled their hearts and they thought they would die but they fail to like the master he spoke the word and the winds all stood still even the water they obeyed his will and he come there stone just like he will mind if I just streaming bird that he lives deep inside should I worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus he stays always he lives in my heart and he hears when I I called on his name till the storm passes by why should i why should why should I fear when the very same Jesus he stays always he lives in [Music] and here's when I cry I call on his name till the storm passes by [Music] we read in the Bible how he walked through them brought light to their darkness when the way grew slowly how great it would be to have his tax lien in mine and to walk with stuff Oh when trials come and F is I just search for the master he said he'll be there on time and when I'm in trouble and my body isn't a all I have to do is car on his name and why should see when the very same Jesus he stays always me he lives my [Music] when I cried I called on his name till a star passes by so why should I and why should I fear when the very same Jesus he stays always near he lives in my heart any tears when I cry I call on his name till the storm passes fine why should I and why should I see when the very same Jesus he stays always me he lives [Music] and here's when I cry I call on his name till the storm passes by I call on his name till the storm passes by [Music] [Applause]
