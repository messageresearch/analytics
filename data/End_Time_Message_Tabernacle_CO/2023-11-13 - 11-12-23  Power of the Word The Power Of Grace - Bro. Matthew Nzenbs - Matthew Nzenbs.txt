happily he might find anything there on and when he he came to it it found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus J answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciple heard it let's read on Luke Chapter 13e Luke 13 Verse 6 till verse 9 [Music] for he spake also this Parable and certain man had fig tree planted in in his Vineyard and he came and sold fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dressers of the vineyard behold these three years I came seeking fruit on his fig tree and found none cut it down white cumbered it the ground and the answer the and he answering said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dunk it and if he may it bear fruit well it's not then after thou shall cut it down and he was teaching it on one of the synagogue of the Sabbath beloved God we ask you to come out down and take us out of the pulpit and to take full control and to speak to your people then circumcise the mouth that will speak and hear that will listen send down your angels and you sent in the time of elah time of Malachi 4 so that they will show us things that we shall say by the power of the Holy Spirit beloved God ourselves we cannot do anything but with you we shall do anything that is why this morning let the pit of fire that was above Willi BR be also be with us let the angel of the Lord Camp around this house let the devil be Cast Away In The Name Of The Lord Jesus let the angel of the Lord take all Spirits under his contr contr power of this word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated may God bless you there's been a month since Israel was a war the president Benjamin Premier Minister Benjamin the Prime Minister Benjamin [Music] n said that the war will be long but it won't be easy War I remember before the 7th of October Minister when the Prime Minister came here in United Nation with the President Joe Biden in their speech they were praising the the AI the intelligent artificial intelligence they were speaking as they were doing great things how the artificial intelligence came into sin I said to myself well Joe Biden he's coming and doing a speech speaking of uh artificial intelligence prime minister Benjamin nany he came as well and speaking about the same thing artificial intelligence as if you go to Israel they built a great wall they put hidden cameras surveillance of high uh high tech surveillance if you follow the news they said that they are amazed about it is couldn't see the enemy coming how the the safety the the the Serv secet of Israel can fail the the journalist was saying Israel is the the best uh in terms of security there's something that happened Israel as they were counting on intelligence artificial intelligence they forgot that their strength doesn't depend on those things but their strength it's in God when they going through hardship when he's surrendered by its enemy it's not their own strength or the Chariots or the weapons that gives them Victory no it's the god of Israel and when they put the trust in artificial intelligence they failed they said in that City in that kib they they killed of one 1,400 people see alloc Co of Shah something never happened S as such that has to wake us up as Believers when we put our trust in the things of the world that's where we fail but when we put our trust in the god of Israel that is where we're going to have victory if you remember during the the war of six days Israel didn't fight Israel was surrendered by its enemy all them Arab countries they said they will destroy Israel they will wipe away Israel from the map all of a sudden something happened and the enemies of Israel they were seeking the war against Israel they were defeated what strength Israel had what weapon Israel was using because they trusted in the God and today if you look those countries Arab countries they know themselves Israel is powerful look at Yemen Lian look at Egypt Syria all them countries Iraq the people that the country that were trying to wipe away Israel from the map today we don't speak about them anymore but we speak of Israel remember brother says you are Israel spiritual Israel what is happening with Israel in natural it's the same that happening in Israel in the spiritual then that gave Israel the strength victory is the same God that will give us strength over our enemies and the victory but then you have to know what is God expecting from me did I came on the earth just by chance am I coming to church just by chance am I useful for God in something if at that time somebody is asking himself that question he has to know he has more value to God but what when we don't ask ourselves that question that is the reason why we don't fulfill the purpose for which God has sent us on the earth God is counting on us if you notice in Mark chapter 11 where we read Jesus Christ needed something when Jesus Christ came to Bey say he was hungry the day after when he came out from Bethany Jesus was angry looking from a tree that didn't have he was seeking if he could find something and coming near he only found uh leaves in other words the the the the tree was sterile didn't have fruit though it was his season the tree was good beautiful you see when you look at the tree from afar with the leaves you think that there probably something there but when Jesus got there he thought he would find something he thought he would find fruit but unfortunately he couldn't find any fruit the says that was not the season but Jesus God was conning to have something the Bible says Jesus take the word and said and said it no man eat fruits of thee what did the the TRU do was it his fault Jesus was expecting something from the tree and then he said no man eat fruit of the Jesus Christ was showing the power that he hold though it was not the season of the tree but he was showing to the disciples though even though you need something even if the thing is not there but if you speak it if you believe in the power that is inside of you the thing will happen that's the same thing that Jesus Christ is saying he's saying the same thing in Luke Luke Chapter 13 but in Luke it's speaking of uh in terms of parable the Bible says he spake also this Parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineard remember Christian are the types of the the vine a man a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vard he came and sld fruit there and found none when somebody has a tree or in his Vineyard he's hoping to find something he's expecting the fruit the tree to bear fruit so that he can heat and the Bible says when Jesus Christ got there the tree didn't have any fruit Jesus Christ cursed the tree and here Jesus Christ is telling us the parable and then he's saying to the V the vine man therefore three years I came to seek for the the the vine in this V tree but I can't find none cut it down what is he going to occupy the land the Christian are the type of the tree words they are like Vine then your creator expecting something from you what can you produce for your creator are you just occupying the ground for no no reason no it's for a purpose that God placed you on the earth and Jesus Contin by saying and the V man said Lord let it again let it alone this year verse eight let it alone this year till I shall dig about it D it and maybe in the future if he bear fruit or else then he that shall cut down you know in Africa there we see how people were uh tilling the ground when somebody plant the tree in his Vineyard he's expecting to see avocados or mangoes but if he finds after the tree is not producing what he was expecting he will dig around the he will take the the dong and place around the the tree expecting to find something and the the dong for us is the word of God we are the tree without the fruit but the creator of Heaven and Earth the almighty God in his patience is coming to look for the fruit and he can't find any fruit the Lord Jesus Christ he said oh Master my Lord instead of cutting it down let it alone time let me about it let me D it maybe in the future it will bear fruit the word of God that you eat every day that will make in the future that you bear fruit even if now you don't have any fruits just hope that in the future grace to the word that you listen you bear fruit he's also saying something in Isaiah Isaiah chapter 5 verse first verse listen carefully the Bible says now will I sing to my beloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard my well beloved has a vineard in a very fruitful Hill and he fenced it GA it out the stones there and planted with the choice the choices Vine and build the Tower in and then also made a wind wind wind press there in and then it just brought for the wrong one therefore inhabitant of Jerusalem and Men of Judah judge I pray you between me and my vineard what could have been done more to my vineard that have not done in it where uh verse four [Music] when and then the wrong one I'm going to tell you now what I would do to my v i will take away so they may be cast down I will build the fence so they shall be T in down I will thr it down and they shall not be pruned died and they shall come up breath and thones and I also command to the cloud that there r No Rain upon it the vineard of the Lord of host is the house of Israel remember brother vam says we are the types of Israel the Lord God in his patience dog around you he wants you to produce to be fruit he want you to be useful in his Society he want you to win souls for him say everybody cannot preach but everybody can do something for God God just didn't let you to believe a message and your neighbor not be saved no no God called you on the earth for a purpose you believe the message of the hour you accepted the word of God but ask yourself a question my colleague at work my neighbor next to me our home has he ever heard the word of God does he even know brother Bram does he know how will he know Mal never spoke to him about Malachi 4 if you never told him Malachi already came you had a work to do you not going to preach because you're a woman but you can also testify you can say how much God saved you you can say how much you received this message how this message change your life this message has just no power to change your life but this message has the power to bring us all the way the Lord God is counting on you how many Souls you ever went won for Christ what you present to God over there or you are ashamed to say that you received the message are you just ashamed to say God saved me you have to have that deepness inside of you the deepness to tell people that God has sent us Prophet the deepness to say this message the deepness to say this message coming from the Throne of God this message is from God himself says if there's a desire in your heart they has to have some something somewhere to respond to that Des God didn't create the tree just for the Earth but he created the tree for the the God created the ground for the tree is speaking of the FK say that animal back then they were walking on the Earth but they were not walking fast the deepness that was inside of the animal is to walk faster but the only way to walk faster is to live in the water remember the what typify the words says because of that deepness that was inside of the heart the nature created the the the that the nature created the thing around him saying in the only way place of worship that God has given paragraph 67 says as I always said when the deepness call to the deepness there has to be a deepness to respond to that you know you that they said the folk were walking on the river the side River with the the legs but now it doesn't have any legs they transformed themselves in things around it because they could he didn't have anything around him when he left the Earth for for the sea the animal the natural just made thing around him without instead of instead of the legs because he could just uh swim more than walking says that animal he was living in the water but without the deepness that was inside of the house the nature gave him the thing around him now he lives in the water says if the power could create in an animal things that he needed how much more you the creator of Heaven how much more you got created after his own [Music] image this morning I would like to speak about the power of the word the power of the word as a subject the power of the grace says something very important here in the message the de of Jesus Christ says and today this is the problem of the church the hope of glory the baptism of the Holy Spirit it has come into people's hearts that's my prayer this morning that the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes into your heart so that you may bear fruit for Christ so that you may win souls for Christ you may testify for Christ says but they don't recognize it they think it's a little joining or something like that but it's God the Creator living in you you know when God is inside of you you do great things that the world cannot do say John chapter 15 John chapter [Music] 15 you bear fruit needs fruit from you God created you so that you may bear fruit more fruit Jesus Christ is giving another parable John chapter 15 verse first verse Jesus said I'm the True Vine and my father is the husband every branch is in me that bear no fruit he taketh away and every branch that bearth fruit it purged it if don't bear fruit God will take it away from the earth what is your desire this morning the nature is capable of giving you everything that you need Jesus said he's the the the [Music] the he's a True Vine and you the branches in other words you attached to him if he B the Miracles you can produce Miracles as well if he did great things you can also do great things verse three verse two every branch in me that be no fruit it taketh away and every branch that he purged it that he may bring forth more fruits the little bit of fruits that you have take care of it because God is purging so that you can bear more fruit just have that desire in you he says now he are clean through the word which I've spoken unto you abide in [Music] me and I in you as this as this Branch cannot bear fruit of except abide in the vine do your best love the word attach yourself to the the Lord Jesus Christ made flesh in our day and we bear more fruit therefore you will not if you don't abide in me I'm the the theine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him they bring forth much fruit for without me he cannot do anything if a man abide not in me is cast forth what is it to abide in him to have that thirst have the love of the word to love him with all your heart it's not you that have chosen me nobody Among Us chose Christ nobody chose God but it's God that chose us if he chose us because he that we had value that is the reason why he chose us why he didn't chose Joe Biden to believe this message why didn't chose great people in this world to believe this message why he just chose us because you have value we only choose what we love we don't choose what we only choose we only choose what is value it's valuable to us but the condition is to abide in him say if you abide in me and my words abide in you what is's asking us is his word to abide in US the word canot abide in you if you don't thirst for the word the word cannot abide in you if you don't have that deepness to call the word in you he says when the word app in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if you bear much fruit that's how my father will be glorified God wants to be glorified in his children the Bible says the father had loved me as the father has loved me so I have loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I kept my father commandment and abide in his love ye as well keep this commandment somewhere the Apostle Paul says commandment are not difficult as you may think had 10 commandments that he gave to Moses but by his grace by the death of out of that commandment God made two commandment the first commandment what it is you shall love the Lord your God above everything the second one what it is love your brother if I love my brother I won't hurt him I won't steal his good I won't take his wife I won't destroy I not destroy his reputation says these 10 commandments made two Commandments What A Grace it says this commandment are not difficult but it takes love when you love Christ even if he ask you the tough you will do it because you have his love that is why Jesus Christ me if you AB in me you shall bear much fruit says God did not create the human heart to suffer God created the human heart to be happy to be enjy in other words to Bear much fruit you bear much fruit your heavenly father will be proud of you I say this thing so that my joy May remain in you if his Joy remains in you you are happy so that your joy may be full this is my commandment that he love one another that is the Commandment of God the Jew the Jews has three more than 300 uh Commandments when they're going to buy a salad if they they heat they eat the the the thing in the salad animal in salad they sin By Us by the grace of God he only gave us two Commandments love one another he says there's no much greater love that to give his life for his beloved you are my friends if you do what I command to you what is commanding to you to love him says

heart the Holy Spirit I believe Ephesians saying something something alike listen what James says CH James chapter 5 James chapter 4 he says where the the the St coming from it's not from your last coming from your members you you you you fight but you don't you are a murderers cannot obtain you have stripes and fight and you have not because you ask not says when a Christian has everything in his heart that will take Christ from his heart and Christ represent the the dove when the do is not in your heart what it comes in your heart it's a serpent the snake this is not a good sign says if you serve him and embrace him and love him keep in your heart and love him I can tell you what a church who Gather in this kind of power will have or has the power to bind the heaven heal the sick Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah the death speak and the dumb speak and the walkind see why recognizing the power of almighty God in your heart recogniz in your heart what is in there it's the power of God there the de of Jesus Christ abiding in you says do you love him no wonder the poet said amazing grace of our God swe sound that saved I was lost but now I'm found I was blind now I see when I was in denominations in the world I didn't know this message exist but God has provided a way so I can leave this message it's only to abide in God that things will blow glow you says in the message the Redemption is fullness in Joy paragraph 51 bam says and there's a big Shadow Dark Shadow sitting y before us called death and every time our heart beats we move one step closer to that one of these days it's going to take his last beat and we are going in I want to be there at my time make my as I hope as I hope every one of you is tonight this morning when when I know that he laying just before me and I have to meet it I don't want to be a coward I want to wrap myself in the robe of his righteousness to have the love of Christ to have the righteousness of Christ continues and to be to walk into it knowing this that I'm sure that I know him in the power of his resurrection it's true so that when when you shall call to wake up from the dead I shall be called living God is the god of the Living God of the Dead says oh the children of Israel when they were in Egypt they were not the people of God or they were not the Church of the Living God because in Egypt they were under slavery but one day God by his grace came down he took a human flesh and he made a journey to Egypt to save the people of Israel if you read in the Bible the Bible says God is in spirit sometimes these things are very difficult for the Believers they said how God the God in heaven can come down to get in human flesh to save to bring the people of Israel out while God himself promised them he will come down but when you read in the Bible the Bible says God is in spirit and the true worshipers will worship the father in the spirit and the truth now a question who was the man that fought with Jacob where that man coming from the Bible says Jacob fought with that man whole night but in the setting of The Day The daing of the day the man said to the jaob let me go because now the ding of the day he said I will not let you go until you change me until you do something for me sister you might say I'm a sister can I do for God says the man that buil the person bu the city of Bethlehem it was a prostitute woman RAB says buil with his husband and today you can do much things you can save a lot of soul just by way of living now that man fought with Jacob all night long when the morning was setting rising up the man told Jacob let me go soon the the the the sun will rise people will see me he said no I will not let you go you blessed me you changed me just insist until he Chang he has the power to transform remember brother preach message the power of God to transform the transformation the Redemption by power the fellowship by Redemption all this message he didn't just PR preach it to because there's a power behind it abide in his love abide in his word the same power that came into Jacob to change his body the power is here among us to change your body to transform you the same power it's moving in the building when the sun was about to rise Jacob told that man let me go no Jacob said I will not let you go until you change me and the same God that changed Jacob the same yesterday today and forever to change us if he comes in the heart of a man how much more today says paragraph 53 he's speaking of the children of Israel they they applied the blood that was applied which was a very beautiful type of the Believers that when he had accepted the death of Christ in then he becomes a child of God he start his journey down the death for the innocent lamb provided life to the guilty Believers is not the perfect type now the the church says amen the death of innocent providing life for the guilty and the death of the innocent Christ provides life for we the guilty says after God gave them life through the blood and pro that death passed over them he started them in their Journey now notice then the next thing God did as soon as they were become Believers and children and accepted God the enemy of the physical death took after them and he had them cornered right up the desert on the side the Red Sea on the side mountains says on the other side Pharaoh's Army coming up pursuing them milons of coming in to match them now God has already manifested that he gave them life when if God gave you life nobody will take it away says to the death of the now he's going to show them physical Redemption that is what we need to be transformed the physical red I have high high and D I'm always in the world I'm always make I always make mistakes says it's normal because the body hasn't been red when the the body will be redeemed God will put the devil under your feet I already believe the devil is under your feet says hallelujah do you see that for the Salvation oh for the you see for the natural man and for the spiritual man says the death angel passed over proving that God has made a way of Escape through the offering of the blood and they accepted it now he's going to make a way of escape from the physical death says like the Believers as soon as they get saved maybe cancer has hidden or some disease God has Redemption also through the power the same as he has Redemption for the soul he has Redemption for the body your body there a certain time will bear fruit of itself I believe you will not force anything I believe G gan gan saying the same thing Gan chapter 5 he says the fruit of the spirit love the joy peace peace shom a great Shalom one day that Shalom will be at your door have that desire patience longsuffering gent goodness Faith [Music] goodness Temperance that's why it's many couples Miss many Christians many Believers Temperance self-control the Bible says the law is not against [Music] that in Jesus Christ have crucified the flesh with their affection and last the only thing the secret that you can have this is to sacrifice the desire of the flesh the passion the lust of the flesh he says if we live by the spirit we also to walk in the spirit do not seek a vain Glory like sometime what is killing us it's when we seeking after the vain Glory let not seek after V Glory provoking one another envying one another do not seek after V Glory but seek from things from above love joy patience James 5:7 the Bible says be therefore patient brother until the the the rupture the patience the rupture of the Lord at the door the coming of the Lord the door brother bam says now every believer every children of God born again when death TR the door the angel of the god stand between you and death good news for you this morning the same Angel of the Lord here is standing between you and death death cannot hurt you butam says he's standing between you and death say it's been three years at the hospital and the that doctor gave me three hours one of the best surgeon that you have in this city give me three years to leave now I'm still alive Hallelujah tonight Hallelujah why but the undeserved grace everything that you have the life that you process undeserved grace of God why did you give him to have a good Breath of Life who are you to be in the condition where you are now it's just the grace of God says the angel of God stood between me and death to protect me the same angel of God is standing between you and every situation in life to protect you abide in him much fruits says the angel of God stood between me and death to protect me and I accepted it and in my gratitude by Grace God God's I won half a million souls to him tonight looking to win souls for christ5 how God knows how do to do things if we only just follow don't try to lead God let God lead you be like a ship on the water let God lead you surrender yourself to unto his hand as Moses as the child Moses that was L the crocod but the power of God came inside of Moses had no power to hurt Moses says let God lead you don't try to lead godam says you [Music] see we have to be led I think that's why God lacken us onto sheep says a sheep doesn't know the way he doesn't know the way back home says if you let him somewhere he will get lost says and that's the way a man when he's lost is totally helpless says when a sheep got a man of in the wilderness he find in a forest there's a serpent all kinds of animals the only thing we will try to do it will begin to sound to make noise to make noise to cry he will keep on making noise because there's a danger somewhere it becomes helpless but as Christians we have a Shepherd when we we have we have no power he sent the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes inside of us he gives us power things that were impossible become possible by his power says you cannot change anything what is it's God by the way of Grace that can lead you to Christ that can lead you back home Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that he draw and comes I will give him everlasting life say what a promise the promise of everlasting life God has created us for eternal life we are living in a time when we leave time we step into eternity said The Eternity that is going with our hands abire to be much fruit have the desire to do something for when he shall come he will not take you away but it will D around you to to put more so that you may bear much fruit says now notice the children of Israel God came stood between them and the danger the power of redemption the Redemption by power the Redemption by Blood the Redemption by power a good type of a Believer under the blood abide in the love of God abide in the blood of Christ says [Music] then go between the between still in Redemption paragraph 72 by the power of God sparing his life prolonging it for time they will have everyone been killed right there would have massacred them right there in the wilderness if God hadn't stood between them says when the children of Israel was coming out of the Wilderness or when they came out of Egypt they stood between before the the Red Sea in the wilderness without any hope without god without birth of life cornered said at the same time the angel of the Lord between them and the danger says Pharaoh with his army would have massacred them them right there in the wildness if God hadn't stood between them says if God also didn't stand I would have been dead a long time ago if God had hadn't stood between me and death every believer here would have been dead stood between you and every one of you so God Sovereign Grace [Music] Mercy stands between the Believers and death now we have a perfect Redemption Grace by the blood of Christ it's not the blood of a man it's not the blood of the animal the blood of the animal just cover the sin but the blood of Jesus Christ that doesn't just cover the sin but divorce us from sin takes away the sin not the blood of a man but the blood of Christ says it just cover the sin but once the blood of Jesus they hold the most H blood and the most righteous blood was shed the sin was no longer covered but was divorced and cancelled deler and the Believers stepping into the presence of his creator to dwell in it what a promise the Bible says be therefore patience brother until the coming of the Lord says we are at the time all the signs that the prophet foretold are being fulfilled the problem with the unbeliever problem with unbeliever is to seek for Det details they always find great the big picture they want things to happen the way they think says our God is unusual God he does things in a very [Music] unusual very unusual time things to happen the way you think God may make things go way unnoticed way When You're Expecting Los Angeles to S maybe you didn't understand things say there three things that you don't want to do or you shouldn't do misinterpret the word misplace the word break the word I won't get into that the Bible says you as well be patient with your hearts because the coming of the Lord dra near do not complain one another that is why it's happening in the the world of Christian or message Believers Christians become complainers they always complains about one another I think it's red the other things I think is going to be when the Los Angeles will sink God is very unusual the Bible says now my brethen take as an example Prophet verse 10 take my brethren the [Music] prophet of suffering or patience the prophet that has spoken in the name of the Lord behold [Music] we become them happy which Eno we patially [Music] enjo you have heard of the patient of job I've seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very peaceful and tender Mercy but Above All Things my brethren swear not neither by Heaven neither by neither by any other but you fall into condation patience to say no to the things of the world to reject the things of the world time is no more time is long gone the Jews they're saying we need two states so that we can live with our Brethren side by side that is human High some sometimes the human eyes doesn't look the promise but brother says search the scripture in other words read the word read the scriptures because in them you have the eternal life the paragraph 274 Jesus said a man get got out and work and another man went out now after and he worked another man went out and worked and one man went out at 11th hour when he stopped at the 11th hour he gives every one of them the same portion the 11th Hour they wonder why why did he he got the 11th Hour where everybody was coming in says 275 Lu under Luther dispensation died in he said others shouting me Methodist died under Wes's age died in Grace we not at the age of Wesley we are not at the age of [Music] Luther are still waiting but no at the age where the power of God has to be manifested we are the age where he had already come we are not full of them that waiting but we believe he already come how did he come and why he came he came to dwell in Us in the form of the holy spirit in the form of the power we are living in another age no at that time says here before M Used To Go in O C and we go in a mod V almost a jet Propel it's true we are living in a different age Al together and we are living in a different dispensation we are living in the day of restoration of the powers of God the age in which we're living in it's not the age of westle it's not the age of Luther we are living in the age of the restoration all the powers of God all the powers of God have to be manifested in the bodies of the Believers them that believe the message of the hour says we see the power of God like they did in the beginning we are living in another age don't look back there to Wesley Methodist and all those Baptist don't have your eyes look back there don't have your eyes look back to Noah says if Moses who would come could come to preach the message of Noah at the time where the children of is were expec to come out for ex but nothing would have happen because the message of Moses was the appropriate message for the time says if Jesus Christ we bring forth the message of Moses at the second ex nothing would have happened because the Moes of Moses was appropri for the first says if he com to bring forth the message of the second Exodus at the Third Exodus nothing will happen why because we are no longer at the time of the message to be born again we are at the message where the message has to reveal the seals the message uh the the junction of time now listen what the prophet says says when the Holy Spirit is taking over you and reveals to you that is God supernaturally resurrected now you know where you are standing that's my prayer that you should know where you are standing you are not planted by chance says now you know where you are standing outside of it you are not born again and you don't know it you can only take what mother said what the preacher said but what do you think [Music] it will not happen until it reveals to you say the time of Junction is here the head of all things has come the time the end of all time has come notice what is happening after it's the eternity we are at the time where the seals are revealed we are at the time of the coming of the Lord says the coming of the lord it's a time frame it's not something in TI time said the coming of the Lord at the time of the children of Israel where they were thinking God would come down from heaven like that but said no unusual God came in the form of a baby born in the M says while he was there two years to see the coming while he was already there recogniz after two years said he sent out to kill all the children of of two years says s saw that coming at his time an saw the coming at his time it was already there says until the death of the cross it was still the coming of the [Music] Lord says the the second coming of the Lord it since Malachi came the head of all things the revelation of Revelations Supreme of Jesus take the form of Mali to proclaim the word to break the says if you bring us the message of second Exodus that wouldn't work at the time of the fresh fruit the eag fruit the opening of the the fulfilling of the word in coming in the body of you proclaim the coming of the Lord while the others saying the Seven Seals are not revealed but the holy spirit is revealing to you he said the heads of all things has come down we are living the underr rooms we are getting into the gr of the king at The Headstone the Lord Jesus Christ the gate that come down the head has come down to United with the body you are the body the Temple of Christ the temp of the holy spirit says Bri the word the word of of hour listen to what brother saying oh thank you for William brandham if you take the books you take the Bible away from me I become zero without any inspiration I won't be standing here thank you Jesus for William Bram brother says I believe it's in the fellowship communion bear with me don't don't give a lot of importance value said this type of thing it's already condemned says love the Lord all your heart don't give so much importance to this old thing the message things to be says this hey terral body I will tell you one thing this terrestrial body to which you give so much importance you take you follow after Hollywood it will not be longer says you remember you heard the proph prophecy you see but the that's given me it will sink notice he will sink just notice he never he never said something that was wrong says and I will stand before anybody that has something to say I don't know when when and where but is done the judgment is right there or above them there's no Redemption for him it's already pass gone if you dwell in God you will not care about this body the message things that to be he said this whole flesh body it's for very soon it will be destroyed but there something inside of you that will live forever and that's the reason why the Bible says in John chapter 14 L to what the Bible says John chapter 14 Jesus said to disciple and to us as well let not your heart be troubled believe in me in God I repeat let not your heart be trouble you believe in God believe also in me in my father many mans if it were not I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come and receive you unto myself so that where I am that you may be [Music] also what a promise therefore when you have the revelation of that promise you care more about your souls than your body in the fellowship by Redemption says a man in the beginning was created even in his condition or Fallen decision position paragraph 24 says but today the Man was created to serve God the tree that is there on the earth it has a one purpose is to serve God says Man was created to serve God that is has what he has to do absolutely on the Earth but notice John chapter 14 he went to prepare a place for us says now listen this great man the wise man of all the men Solomon oh he speaking of in ecclesiast said he said all of them he said let's hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his command for this is the full duty of men fear God and keep his commandment that's very important says that's the full duty of a man we wonder why we running along here men and women where that we wear clothes and have to strive and the animals don't says God feed his little old b birds and take care of everything else but us we have to shift for ourselves it's because sin separate us from our maker that's why we did that no man is moving along you don't see an animal embeding themselves it can't if he gets any better [Music] treatment it got to come from the other source the inner Source the animal says if he has to Bear himself he has to come from other source say he doesn't build himself a better house that's animal he doesn't make himself fry his where he used to eat it ra it has to be done because he's an animal says there there's nothing in him to give a an animal doesn't have a soul but a man has a soul says therefore is a part of God what a promise even in Fallen States even in your Fallen States even in your mistakes you have a part of God your maker even in your Fallen he knows you by your name says yet it's the most greatest species all of what a consideration God has for you and when he get him in connection with his maker super he becomes a Superman what is the problem is to get in connection with your maker the only thing that can make you get in contact with your is the baptism of the Holy Ghost says with the creator of all things let me repeat so that it can sink well in you says yet the man is the most greatest species of all the species of the earth therefore and when you get him in connection with his maker he becomes a Superman almost because he's a Son of God with the creator of all things then when he make acquainted with his maker becomes a part of his maker not a part of a man not a part of William Bram William bham is a man born in sin came in this world by grace of God he said he said himself when I get there I sing aming saved by by the Creator God the Lord Jesus Christ when you get in connection with him you become part of him he becomes you what a revelation says and he refine the fellowship with his maker every Divine word becomes a living reality to him and he believes it no no wonder people can't believe Divine Healing today P doesn't don't believe in theal they are in error because if you don't believe in Divine Healing how can you believe in the Rapture divine is a part of the Rapture because the body has to be in good because the body has to be changed that's the same thing that people that to the rupture said this flesh will not go to the rupture this thing has to be changed that is why there's some people that say we all go we shall not all die they have to be a type of how did Enoch went to the Rapture through the death he was changed div healing is to change something in your flesh in your body the Rapture also before going there we going to be changed to be as himam says put him in connection with his maker he will recover the fellow every Divine word becomes a living reality and he believes it says there's nothing they got nothing in them to believe it until God comes into the human heart a human heart a man is much better than BR much better than his reason he will think it out all out how can this be says and explain it all way but when God ever takes position in the human heart all the reasoning goes away God comes first amen in the beginning when God created a man to worship Him and leave God taking care of him Fe him man had perfect fellowship with God there was nothing wrong God came down in the evening and talk to Adam and Eve what a beautiful picture no arm nothing could harm them no sickness could ever come to them they didn't even know what sickness was they didn't they didn't know what old age was they didn't know what being hurt nothing could hurt them they were in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which had them in control gued them there was nothing could harm them says bring the man in the presence of the omnipotent when the omnipotent speaking always happen what a promise says if it happens to think yeah believe this morning little group of Believers could take away put aside the thought and get down to the fact to know that the great Jehovah God that created you in the beginning in this place today in this Tabernacle at the heart of every believer you believe it now at in the beginning when God come down and talk to ad and in the cool of the day and his great voice whisper to them and they had Fellowship they would love one another the way the spirit will the lion come up the tig and all the animals they will worship the Lord man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him brother bam says when Adam was in the Garden of Eden he was a mature God he had everything under his control Adam could call The Lion and the lion could come and worship the tiger would come and worship they were not worshiping ad worship the creator of Adam and the lion of the Tigers don't worship the Creator worship the Creator say the Creator the Lord Jesus himself one day people came to worship Willam Bram one man came and said what we were there in the room The Voice told us the brother is the Lord Jesus Christ my brother and my sister just keep this all your life if you worship Willam you go to hell says worship toship he said yes in that room The Voice told us to worship got in the spirit he said no don't worship me if you worship me you are making me of an antichrist is not an antichrist he said don't worship me I'm a child of andam says if you are worshiping me I will leave the and the man told us that you are the Lord Jesus Christ told them when I got in the vision I saw there were people there when they got in that room before you they started worshiping in the name of those Spirit stay in the walls that is why even the things that we use they are spirit and them spirits have to be Cast Away only in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ outside of that name you will be possessed with those spirit says I will never be an antichrist I will be one day to be at the foot of the person that I love so much I serve so much the Lord Jesus Christ the creator of heavens and earth of the Old Testament Jesus in the New Testament says them that will recognize the God will do exploit John is telling us let your heart be not troubled do not be troubled he said believe in God believe also in me believe in God believe also in Jesus Christ he said in my father's house are many manions if it were not St I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you if I go and prepare a place for you I will come back and receive you unto myself that where I am that he may be as says now now fasten your seat belt says I never believe that heaven was somewhere where there's much buildings or many menion of hous is built with brick or where the walls are tappered where the that pain I never believed supernatural being we live in literal house or literal house I believe when Jesus was speaking John 14 saying in my father's house there are many manions he will me a body says I don't believe they In Heaven There are many houses built with bricks painted with colors with Tails and all kind of things says I believe when he was saying John In My Father's House many mentions says he meant a body says this is deep I want this to sink says he meant a body a dwelling place for the scriptures verifies the same thing if this healthy tab we have one already Wai you see it mortal beings he's the only one who lives in the moral habitation Immortal beings live in Immortal habitation therefore the place that we go into until we return back it's not a place of brick moral clay precious stones it's a place a condition a condition that we move out of this that we live into into another dimension it's a house a tabernacle a dwelling place that is not made of human hands that is not made by Architects that was not drawn by the God himself the creator of Heaven and Earth went to build says Jesus said destroy this Temple and I will raise it up in three days and they thought he was speaking of while Jesus was not even speaking about Temple but he was speaking of his own body he's going to prepare a place for every believer that's at the time that the very moment we step out of this moral region we don't go we don't go out of into a myth or some Supernatural Spirit but we go into a tabernacle a dwelling place that might be right here in this Tac right now in the dimension radio acity or nothing can touch me what is that Dimension that is right here in this Tabernacle that is in this church this church there no radio activity or nothing can touch it says it's a state that was not made by human hands to get into that state you need to be born again because this body says is heavy to get into that we have to leave the he body to get in the body that will be mixed with everybody you be in the glorified body if you went your in the glorified body we as well will be like him we will be changed in the twinkling of an eye in a moment to get into that body says that promise it's a true promise have that hope work so that you can be much fruit even if hard work hard the Bible sayri to get into the promise because they still have a promise says listen it's prepared by God itself say he's not prepared by himself William bham didn't go to prepare a place for us but it's the Lord Jesus Christ the creator of heavens and earth listen Moses had been dead for 800 years 800 years Elijah had been translated for around 6 and 700 years and there was they stood on the month Transfiguration both of them in the moral looks talking to Jesus just before he went to cover you see what I mean then what am I saying trying to say that we are looking at some mythical something way off under a million years that's the reason why I'm saying oh we are going we are going we're all going to die this is wrong says there will be people that will be the type of Moses there will also be people that will be as a larger says in their perfect form old age will not harm you anymore you old one you accepted Jesus Christ when the time will come and you will be changed the Lord Jesus Christ will appear you will also be there at the age of 21 and 23 says just take me a picture at the age of 23 at that day we will recognize brother at the age went on the other side he saw a woman coming our precious brother our precious brother if you wouldn't come you didn't come look at him look at her who are you I'm the lady that you baptized there in Canada at the age of 93 says she was so young very beautiful without any flaws why because she had the love of the she loved God love the word no matter how it hurts you just love him humility comes before Glory Pride preed before the the Bible to F they became proud we going to build a tower where we going to see God face to face says God confounded to show that God the house they went to prepare for us it's not a place that was not created by man it's a place that was created by God himself what grace receive the spirit of God of creator of heavens and earth the Lord Jesus Christ says the omnipotent speaks and they sick are healed the five Junction of time paragraph 98 the blind see the the DB walk the evil spirits are cast the holy spirit is placing gift in the church and is manifesting itself people have Vision prophets appearing what it is time at time of the end we are at the junction we at the junction of time at the Crossing of the road we need the grace of God to step into the house say Friends Christian friends you them that profess to have the Holy Spirit why don't you forsake yourness and come to God and to be regenerated to be born again in the spirit of God if in your heart you don't believe Miracles you don't believe God does things today if God is still God he has to be the same God if he lose his power he's a dead God but now God never loses power even if he was dead never even upon the sick never loses power the Dead the sick are healed the power of God still exist we don't serve a dead God says what good will serve you the god of Elijah ask yourself something how good will serve you the god of Moses if he's dead I will serve you the god of Elijah if he dead if he not the same it means it's some way something historical but it's not a historical Christ it's the resurrected Christ we don't worship the god of we don't worship the god of we don't the god of Budd we are worshiping the God ofes we are worshiping the god of elij worshiping a god of Mali the Lord Jesus Christ The God Who resurrected Jesus Christ from the dead The God Who can Quicken your body where STS if you say God is dead how good will serve you the god of Elijah how good will serve you the god of Moses says they saw today the god that we serving there is not a historical God it's a living God a real God we believe him by we walk by faith we live by faith we going to live this world by faith we going to live by faith says they live today he lives today in all his power and the fullness as he always lived Among Us now right now same yesterday
