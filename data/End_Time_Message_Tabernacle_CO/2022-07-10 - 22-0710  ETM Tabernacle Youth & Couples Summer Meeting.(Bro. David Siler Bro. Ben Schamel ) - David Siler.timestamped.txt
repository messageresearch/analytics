[1:01:10] the little effort i can do is to pray
[1:01:12] for you

[1:01:16] proves but your reward must come from
[1:01:19] the one who called

[1:03:04] another opportunity
[1:03:07] let's talk about opportunity
[1:03:09] as soon as you can have the visa god
[1:03:11] willing he will be here
[1:03:16] so that was the reason why i have to
[1:03:18] change the schedule and try to fill up
[1:03:21] myself
[1:03:28] with
[1:03:30] even though i did not want to do it
[1:03:35] because i have about
[1:03:39] six meetings in uh
[1:03:42] probably three or four days
[1:03:49] uh
[1:03:52] starting this uh wednesday or thursday
[1:03:55] in france for myself
[1:03:59] they are also organizing uh young people
[1:04:02] meeting over there
[1:04:06] so i will have our morning evening
[1:04:08] morning evening morning evening services
[1:04:23] but we want to do the best we can do to
[1:04:25] serve the lord
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:31] so i think another point here
[1:04:39] tomorrow god willing damage
[1:04:42] uh for those who will be visiting uh the
[1:04:45] places brother burnham was in the
[1:04:47] mountain here of colorado
[1:04:54] colorado we have a programme
[1:04:56] program and i will ask brother dale
[1:04:59] who know the path
[1:05:04] if you can please talk to the people
[1:05:07] about the program for tomorrow
[1:05:20] on okay sorry
[1:05:23] um some of the places will be uh going
[1:05:26] um
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:28] if you could let
[1:05:30] brother emanuel know if if you're for
[1:05:32] sure going
[1:05:34] and
[1:05:35] and
[1:05:36] so what we're planning on doing is
[1:05:38] there's there's a nice little restaurant
[1:05:40] that brother brandon used to go to so we
[1:05:42] like to meet there and have breakfast
[1:05:52] yes and so
[1:05:53] that um
[1:05:55] it's very small so it can't accommodate
[1:05:57] a huge amount of people
[1:06:01] so it's helpful if we if we know how
[1:06:03] many people want to make it up in time
[1:06:05] for breakfast
[1:06:10] and so what we like to do to allow for
[1:06:13] congo time
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:20] is let us know which ones are on
[1:06:22] american time will show up
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:30] in other words we'll we'll start meeting
[1:06:33] for breakfast around with some uh groups
[1:06:35] around 8 30.
[1:06:40] and some around nine
[1:06:42] uh
[1:06:44] and then
[1:06:45] at the the latest 9 30 if you would like
[1:06:48] to come for breakfast
[1:06:53] and then we're going to go um after
[1:06:55] breakfast so if you're if you're not
[1:06:57] there by 10 you're going to miss the
[1:07:00] departure
[1:07:07] and it's it's roughly i think two and a
[1:07:09] half hour drive
[1:07:12] from here in in the metro area up there
[1:07:15] so that gives you an idea
[1:07:19] um so corral peaks um it was uh burned
[1:07:23] last year in the in the trail on the
[1:07:25] back side
[1:07:31] so the trail on the back side is not
[1:07:33] very accessible anymore
[1:07:38] but
[1:07:40] but god has blessed us
[1:07:43] with a a brother who's a message
[1:07:45] believer that's a good friend of ours
[1:07:51] and they own a property on on the other
[1:07:54] side of the mountain where we can get
[1:07:55] access
[1:08:00] so we'll have we'll drive up to that
[1:08:02] area
[1:08:05] and they have a little camp spot
[1:08:12] for those of you that don't want to take
[1:08:13] the hike maybe you bring a lawn chair or
[1:08:15] something and you can just hang out
[1:08:17] there it'll be very beautiful
[1:08:23] and then for the rest of us we'll take a
[1:08:25] hike that's about one mile
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:31] and we'll take you into what we call the
[1:08:33] herford gate
[1:08:47] you remember the story where brother
[1:08:48] branham talks about the blood tag
[1:08:53] and he would sit on his horse there at
[1:08:55] the gate and watch the cattle come from
[1:08:57] the private land to the public land
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:04] and we can take you to that spot
[1:09:08] and and you'll have a nice view of the
[1:09:11] the corral peaks in the valley
[1:09:17] and we'll take you to another place
[1:09:19] where you can get photos of the cabin
[1:09:21] that brother branham stayed in when he
[1:09:23] was there
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:30] but most importantly
[1:09:33] we'll have a wonderful time of
[1:09:34] fellowship
[1:09:37] and uh i think you'll see the um
[1:09:40] the beauty of what attracted brother
[1:09:42] branham to this area
[1:10:06] and we enjoy seeing the wilderness where
[1:10:08] god's prophet went to receive from god
[1:10:10] to bring back to us
[1:10:16] so just a couple of um
[1:10:19] warnings
[1:10:24] it'll probably be very warm um almost
[1:10:26] it'll probably be
[1:10:29] have a matte hot
[1:10:31] but should we get a rainstorm it can get
[1:10:34] very cold quickly
[1:10:40] so make sure you bring a light jacket
[1:10:43] something with long sleeves so if you
[1:10:44] were to get a little bit of rain on you
[1:10:46] it you can be warm
[1:10:53] perfect
[1:10:59] and it's at very high altitude well you
[1:11:02] know what altitude
[1:11:04] so the the hike is not very strenuous
[1:11:09] but because of the altitude you will
[1:11:11] we'll go slow and take our time it's not
[1:11:13] bad at all we've had uh
[1:11:15] elderly people make the the hike with no
[1:11:18] problem
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:24] but you will i recommend at least two
[1:11:27] bottles of water per person
[1:11:32] so bring your young men
[1:11:35] with their backpacks
[1:11:38] in all the waters
[1:11:42] and that's it anything any questions
[1:11:46] any questions
[1:11:49] okay god bless you we'll look forward to
[1:11:51] seeing you tomorrow
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:05] so this morning we are going to have two
[1:12:07] [Music]

[1:18:36] we are truly going to need your grace
[1:18:51] of the resurrection and the
[1:18:52] rapture and we believe lord that is
[1:18:55] imminent
[1:18:57] lord that it could be in any day
[1:19:00] for every scriptural promise that you've
[1:19:02] given us
[1:19:04] we've seen that become manifested
[1:19:47] reading of the word
[1:20:02] in the name of jesus christ
[1:20:05] and let all the church say
[1:20:08] amen god bless you this morning

[1:20:18] to be here to be a part of these
[1:20:20] meetings
[1:20:23] trust that you've received something
[1:20:24] from the lord
[1:20:28] i thank our pastor our precious brother
[1:20:30] falston for the invitation
[1:20:42] i want to say thank you to our
[1:20:43] interpreters
[1:21:12] if you would be so kind to turn with us
[1:21:14] to the book of john chapter 11 today
[1:21:19] i want to start with verse 17.
[1:21:23] and i want to read this portion of
[1:21:25] scripture
[1:21:38] he found that he had lane in the grave
[1:21:40] four days already
[1:21:51] and many of the jews came to martha and
[1:21:53] mary
[1:22:03] as soon as she had heard that jesus was
[1:22:05] coming
[1:22:08] oh martha i hope you can do the same
[1:22:12] just as soon as you heard jesus was
[1:22:15] coming
[1:22:17] she went out and met him
[1:22:20] but mary sat still in the house
[1:22:36] isn't those
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:48] spoke so many years ago
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:17] now what she's going to get spiritual
[1:23:19] now and think that she knows
[1:23:24] one day soon
[1:23:30] i know there's going to come a
[1:23:31] resurrection
[1:23:46] jesus
[1:23:56] [Applause]
[1:24:00] whosoever live it and believe in the
[1:24:02] nation never die
[1:24:05] and he asks martha this question
[1:24:09] is the question that brother and
[1:24:10] preached
[1:24:13] believe us now this is
[1:24:28] without this
[1:24:51] she went her way and called mary her
[1:24:53] sister secretly
[1:25:08] oh
[1:25:52] hallelujah
[1:25:54] i'm going to you may be seated this
[1:25:56] morning
[1:25:58] god bless you
[1:26:00] thank you brother foster we'll just get
[1:26:01] rid of that code if that's okay
[1:26:07] we read from the book of john today
[1:26:12] the book of john is a special book
[1:26:16] because we know that it's brought by
[1:26:18] four gospels
[1:26:25] and every one of the writers of the
[1:26:27] gospels
[1:26:29] they could only write about the
[1:26:31] anointing that they was given
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:43] [Applause]
[1:27:55] [Applause]
[1:28:12] the four
[1:28:40] is represented
[1:29:06] he did not look back into the genealogy
[1:29:08] of jesus
[1:29:22] in the beginning
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:48] and you realize when it comes to saint
[1:29:50] john chapter 11
[1:29:53] and john is the one
[1:29:56] who writes about the resurrection
[1:30:00] and just let me say this
[1:30:03] john is the only writer
[1:30:06] that wrote about the resurrection of
[1:30:08] lazarus
[1:30:10] wrote about it
[1:30:12] mark never wrote about it
[1:30:14] we've never wrote about it
[1:30:16] but it took an eagle messiah
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:44] and it would have such a great amount of
[1:30:46] significance in
[1:31:00] according to
[1:31:15] junctions in time
[1:31:18] god was going to reveal himself
[1:31:21] and make himself known under a certain
[1:31:24] son's name
[1:31:27] god loved to reveal himself under the
[1:31:29] name of son of man
[1:31:33] so much when it comes to the gentiles
[1:31:37] god will reveal himself to the gentile
[1:31:39] church
[1:31:41] is the name of son of god
[1:31:44] at the end of the millennium
[1:31:46] he's going to reveal himself
[1:31:49] that's the son of david
[1:31:51] but between the revealing of the son of
[1:31:53] god
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:10] jesus tells us in the scriptures
[1:32:13] as it was in the days of the world
[1:32:16] so shall it be in the days of the son of
[1:32:19] man
[1:32:22] timing of the son of man
[1:34:02] is
[1:34:33] [Applause]
[1:35:09] is
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:26] so it was
[1:35:56] you know that the first time
[1:35:59] the son of man ministry showed up
[1:36:03] changing messages
[1:36:07] to the bodies of abraham and sarah
[1:36:10] the second time melchizedek showed
[1:36:12] them for commissions
[1:36:19] the perfection of the melchizedek
[1:36:22] perfection
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:50] himself in the flesh
[1:36:52] that's condescended in this hour
[1:36:55] in the form of a mighty angel
[1:36:58] that is revealed to the bride of christ
[1:37:01] and we believe that almighty god is the
[1:37:04] ministry of the son of man so let me
[1:37:05] study physically among the same signs
[1:37:08] and wonders
[1:37:09] that was revealed to abraham
[1:37:13] when did he do it
[1:37:14] just before the destruction of saudi
[1:37:16] arabia
[1:37:30] he's going to destroy this life
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:52] what was the last thing that melchizedek
[1:37:54] did with abraham
[1:37:58] he took communion
[1:38:00] [Applause]
[1:38:02] was the last thing that jesus did with
[1:38:03] his disciples
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:07] he took communion
[1:38:10] what was the last sermon that william
[1:38:11] branham
[1:38:14] it was
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:25] stimulation
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:56] the love
[1:38:57] [Applause]
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:09] you're a wonderful group to minister to
[1:39:13] john chapter 11
[1:39:15] lazarus is dead
[1:39:18] and the scripture tells us
[1:39:20] that jesus loved lazarus
[1:39:24] and it also says he loved mary and
[1:39:26] martha as well
[1:39:30] and he said jesus love martha and her
[1:39:32] sister
[1:39:35] so martha and mary and lazarus
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:16] and
[1:41:41] sometimes we think pastors are
[1:41:42] superhuman people
[1:41:57] oh
[1:42:25] and many of the jews
[1:42:39] martha and mary had left their old dead
[1:42:41] toad churches
[1:42:47] they left their synagogues
[1:42:49] i left their temples
[1:42:52] let me say like this is
[1:43:07] and when jesus doesn't come immediately
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:50] oh
[1:44:18] that's all you're saying
[1:44:45] oh
[1:45:14] is
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:56] jesus
[1:46:05] [Applause]
[1:46:09] is
[1:46:23] because the lord is
[1:46:49] sickness
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:47:06] jesus ain't
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:20] then
[1:48:02] because
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:50:07] brother you talking about faith in the
[1:50:09] word
[1:50:11] you know what she's telling him
[1:50:12] questions he's been here

[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:18] hallelujah hallelujah had you been here

[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:57] [Applause]

[1:52:27] america
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:46] nothing can happen now
[1:52:51] [Applause]
[1:52:58] i've heard these things
[1:53:00] oh if only my favorite preacher was here
[1:53:09] if only my pastor was here
[1:53:15] [Applause]
[1:53:21] [Applause]
[1:53:24] hallelujah i'm talking about the son of
[1:53:26] man
[1:53:28] the lord himself
[1:53:32] with an open book in his hand
[1:53:34] to reveal the promises
[1:53:36] under the seals
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:44] face
[1:53:46] [Applause]
[1:54:06] now he said listen to this idiot
[1:54:10] pour the cogs

[1:54:15] begin to meet god

[1:55:48] but you get another car
[1:55:52] that's running right
[1:55:54] [Applause]
[1:55:56] and you take those jumper cables of
[1:55:58] faith
[1:56:01] [Applause]
[1:56:12] what

[1:57:28] [Applause]
[1:57:42] [Applause]
[1:57:52] [Applause]
[1:58:02] jesus christ is the same today
[1:58:06] [Applause]
[1:58:33] he said you're going to get light pretty
[1:58:34] soon

[3:06:35] because we realize that we're coming
[3:06:36] together as family planning and
[3:06:38] leadership
[3:06:43] and there's no greater leadership than
[3:06:45] the holy spirit
[3:06:48] is free amen if you would turn in your
[3:06:50] bibles to proverbs chapter 29 and 18.
[3:06:53] yes
[3:07:04] read this yesterday afternoon to the
[3:07:05] young people
[3:07:07] uh
[3:07:16] and the scriptures read where there is
[3:07:17] no vision the people perish
[3:07:23] let's bow our heads
[3:07:25] dear gracious heavenly father
[3:07:27] lord we're just coming before you again
[3:07:31] lord we're just so thankful for your
[3:07:32] words
[3:07:35] lord we're just so thankful that that we
[3:07:37] can rely on your words
[3:07:41] lord we're coming before you this
[3:07:43] afternoon
[3:07:45] lord we're just asking that we wouldn't
[3:07:46] be a blind people
[3:07:50] lord that we might be a people with
[3:07:51] vision
[3:07:54] lord we know that the the blind that
[3:07:55] follows the blind
[3:07:59] they fall into the ditch
[3:08:02] but we've had an eagle anointing in our
[3:08:04] age
[3:08:19] we just ask that you would lead and
[3:08:20] guide us this week
[3:08:25] help us to be subject to the holy spirit
[3:08:29] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[3:08:30] name
[3:08:32] amen amen
[3:08:34] you may be seated
[3:08:38] in luke chapter 6 and verse 39
[3:08:44] with jesus speaking
[3:08:46] the scripture reads like this
[3:08:49] and you speak a parable unto them
[3:08:52] can the blind lead the blind
[3:08:55] [Music]
[3:08:57] shall they
[3:08:58] shall they not both fall into the ditch
[3:09:03] so we realized that it would be
[3:09:04] something kind of silly
[3:09:08] if the blind was to lead the blind
[3:09:12] because neither one of them has vision
[3:09:13] in their life
[3:09:53] that we might be able to see where our
[3:09:54] position really is
[3:10:10] and he didn't work
[3:10:20] even though it didn't seem to him that
[3:10:22] he was
[3:10:23] maybe the son of the king
[3:10:53] of this world
[3:10:55] but our heritage is of a world to come
[3:10:59] and we're not just children of a king
[3:11:03] but we are children of the king of kings
[3:11:20] and we cannot be blind to the things
[3:11:22] that the devil's doing to us
[3:11:27] so on thursday night
[3:11:30] i was able to
[3:11:32] preach uh to the adults
[3:12:02] we
[3:12:15] if you don't have a vision for your
[3:12:29] if you're just working a job
[3:12:43] you're just gonna get stuck in the rut
[3:12:45] of life
[3:12:48] and you'll start to realize that the joy
[3:12:50] of the lord starts to depart
[3:12:53] the joy you used to have is no longer
[3:12:55] there
[3:12:57] why because the vision
[3:13:00] is no longer there
[3:13:02] so us as young men must create a vision
[3:13:04] for our life
[3:13:08] and this starts before we are even
[3:13:10] married
[3:13:20] years ago we used to play ice hockey
[3:13:24] and it was kind of us boys that would do
[3:13:26] that
[3:13:38] where we had a family vision
[3:13:57] [Applause]
[3:14:08] so if we're ever going to get vision in
[3:14:10] our lives
[3:14:12] and we must start this morning
[3:14:15] even if you are a single man
[3:14:18] maybe your father doesn't have a vision
[3:14:19] for your family
[3:14:22] then you must
[3:14:51] university or maybe we're working a job
[3:14:54] no real direction
[3:14:57] and so when the devil throws things at
[3:14:59] us
[3:15:01] we're just
[3:15:02] going with the uh the things
[3:15:31] coming out of denominations
[3:15:59] so we must prepare before
[3:16:15] fully surrendered to the spirit of of
[3:16:17] god
[3:16:22] we must become as young men and young
[3:16:24] women leaders in our family
[3:16:27] don't come to genomics
[3:16:44] in a family the oldest child will have a
[3:16:46] great effect on the younger children
[3:16:51] because they have been put in a position
[3:16:53] of leadership basketball
[3:17:25] yes
[3:17:26] and your father has vision
[3:17:28] and you're a young man like me
[3:17:31] then your vision should fit with the
[3:17:33] father's vision
[3:17:38] the church's vision should never alter
[3:17:41] god's vision for the church
[3:17:46] but it should always dovetail
[3:17:51] it should not be a different vision
[3:17:56] but so many of us
[3:18:00] we see this even in the churches
[3:18:03] there are preachers that don't know how
[3:18:04] to submit themselves
[3:18:33] believes he's called to be the pastor
[3:18:37] and then they can't get along
[3:18:40] and he breaks off
[3:18:44] as long as that pastor is under the the
[3:18:47] leadership of the holy spirit
[3:18:55] [Music]
[3:19:02] we have all those five gifts
[3:19:05] within the church
[3:19:08] not all of us are pastors
[3:19:12] so when i am living in my father's house
[3:19:16] it's not my rules
[3:19:28] you're with me so far
[3:19:32] but sometimes we need we we think that
[3:19:33] we have to be the biggest voice
[3:19:37] of war
[3:19:40] sometimes we're trying to get god to
[3:19:42] always trust us in the big things
[3:19:53] you're trying to to get your father to
[3:19:54] trust you with the finances
[3:20:12] the scriptures say in matthew
[3:20:14] chapter 25.
[3:20:17] says his lord said unto him
[3:20:20] well done good and faithful servants
[3:20:23] for thou hast been faithful over a few
[3:20:25] things
[3:20:38] then he which he had received the one
[3:20:40] talent is
[3:20:43] he saw the blessings that this other
[3:20:44] brother had he loved
[3:20:47] so he came into the lord
[3:20:52] i know that
[3:20:53] i know
[3:20:54] that thou art a hard man
[3:20:58] reaping where thou hast not sown
[3:21:03] and gathering where thou has not uh
[3:21:06] struggled
[3:21:08] and i was afraid and went and hid my
[3:21:10] talent in the earth
[3:21:15] thou hast that is thine don
[3:21:20] and pay attention to what the lord's
[3:21:22] reaction to this once
[3:21:26] his lord answered and said unto him
[3:21:29] thou wicked and now slothful servant
[3:21:36] so god has given each and every one of
[3:21:38] us talents
[3:21:43] and you will get one of two reactions
[3:21:49] but you decide what you do with the
[3:21:50] talents that god gave you
[3:21:55] god has made each and every one of us
[3:21:57] different
[3:21:59] but many times we think maybe because
[3:22:01] we're athletic
[3:22:04] maybe because we're better at kicking a
[3:22:05] round ball than the next guy
[3:22:11] maybe maybe we're better at soccer
[3:22:14] oh and because i can pop it over my head
[3:22:16] then i'm better than the next guy
[3:22:31] and more attractive to the ladies
[3:22:35] [Music]
[3:22:41] but that's not the talent that god gave
[3:22:43] you
[3:22:46] to attract them
[3:22:48] but we must be doing something else with
[3:22:50] our our talents
[3:22:55] but maybe you have the the talent to be
[3:22:57] a servant
[3:23:00] maybe god has called you to have an
[3:23:02] office in the church
[3:23:06] maybe god has called you to be a
[3:23:07] minister to his people
[3:23:10] to lend them a helping hand when they
[3:23:12] need it
[3:23:15] but we're too busy concentrating on
[3:23:17] ourselves
[3:23:19] that we miss why god gave us those
[3:23:21] talents
[3:23:24] and we're hiding our talents in the
[3:23:25] world
[3:23:28] instead
[3:23:34] many times we we maybe we have the gifts
[3:23:36] of singing
[3:23:40] and instead of having the true heart of
[3:23:42] worship in our
[3:23:56] and
[3:24:06] brother branham said i can't i don't
[3:24:08] care if you can't sing yourself out of a
[3:24:10] wet paper bag
[3:24:20] and that's what brings the holy ghost
[3:24:24] down there are those of us that have the
[3:24:27] gift of worship
[3:24:31] and when we sing the lord comes down
[3:24:35] this song because the lord loves to hear
[3:24:37] the praises of his prayers
[3:24:51] and the first thing god said
[3:24:54] was let there be light
[3:24:56] and there was light
[3:24:58] and god said
[3:25:00] and there was
[3:25:02] a god
[3:25:04] and there was
[3:25:06] there are power
[3:25:13] [Music]
[3:25:20] but yet instead we're we're trying to
[3:25:21] bury our talents in the world
[3:25:27] so here we are you know
[3:25:29] thinking we're just such an eligible
[3:25:31] bachelor
[3:25:33] in person
[3:25:47] do any of you ladies care if a man can
[3:25:49] dunk or not
[3:25:53] [Music]
[3:25:56] do you care if we could kick a soccer
[3:25:57] ball past another brother into a net
[3:25:59] escape
[3:26:02] or market
[3:26:12] but ladies would you care if your man
[3:26:14] had vision for your family
[3:26:30] because a man without vision shall
[3:26:31] perish
[3:26:34] and that's why these women think
[3:26:36] they're the only ones getting ready for
[3:26:38] marriage
[3:26:43] so many of the brothers in the church
[3:26:56] when the playoff game goes into overtime
[3:27:11] or are you on the edge of your seat
[3:27:16] saying hey wait there's more oh
[3:27:18] yeah
[3:27:19] it's getting more exciting
[3:27:22] we know the time is getting shorter
[3:27:25] we've got one last goal
[3:27:31] [Applause]
[3:27:37] i know this is elementary
[3:27:39] school
[3:28:08] should have received
[3:28:22] so many times we see where god keeps
[3:28:24] blessing one brother
[3:28:28] and we see the blessings just keep
[3:28:29] pouring out and keep pouring out and
[3:28:31] keep pouring it
[3:28:34] it's because he's not gathering up all
[3:28:35] the talents for himself
[3:28:57] [Applause]
[3:29:16] of what christ had
[3:29:30] just like christ has a vision for
[3:29:31] history
[3:29:46] and if you
[3:29:58] so who wants to point at themselves and
[3:30:00] say i will perish
[3:30:15] so we must be faithful
[3:30:18] to the gifts that god has given us
[3:30:21] you can't just bury your talents
[3:30:25] but whatever talents god has given you
[3:30:49] [Music]
[3:30:53] uh so many of these christian singers
[3:30:55] today
[3:31:08] and i saw one of her music videos once
[3:31:10] she was preparing
[3:31:24] videos
[3:31:28] i can't even listen to the song anymore
[3:31:34] because it was perverted
[3:31:36] it was tainted
[3:31:38] she had
[3:31:57] [Music]
[3:32:05] he wants to use you to reach the lost
[3:32:14] [Applause]
[3:32:34] there's
[3:32:57] already been 30 minutes i'll try to wrap
[3:32:59] it up here shortly
[3:33:16] and the character
[3:33:31] in for in a wife
[3:33:34] is character
[3:33:37] but we don't have character ourselves
[3:33:41] and that is what they are looking for
[3:33:44] because we
[3:33:51] [Applause]
[3:33:58] what you find attractive in a woman
[3:34:02] will show what is in your heart
[3:34:06] if you are only looking on the outside
[3:34:10] that is going to be the thing that
[3:34:12] attracts you
[3:34:30] [Music]
[3:34:38] if we're only looking for what's
[3:34:40] attractive
[3:34:49] we're looking for something a little
[3:34:51] more than just good looks
[3:34:54] now we're about
[3:35:01] amen
[3:35:04] but the holy ghost will change our
[3:35:07] character melissa
[3:35:20] the holy spirit
[3:35:30] so you can't just expect to receive the
[3:35:32] holy spirit today
[3:35:36] and be a man of perfect character
[3:35:38] tomorrow
[3:35:41] but your character is something that
[3:35:43] you're constantly working on
[3:35:47] paul said i die daily in politicians
[3:36:02] but that is why brother branham said
[3:36:04] read your bible and pray every day
[3:36:16] brother branham said and hear him
[3:37:00] we're given
[3:37:28] and
[3:37:41] i believe we've had a supernatural
[3:37:43] weekend
[3:37:45] and and
[3:37:46] has done incredible things in our lives
[3:37:50] he's poured out his holy spirit
[3:37:54] but when we walk out those doors
[3:38:11] says
[3:38:13] in uh god identifying himself
[3:38:18] and god was in christ
[3:38:22] reconciling himself
[3:38:24] the world to himself
[3:38:27] and his characteristics identified him
[3:38:30] is a characteristic
[3:38:32] what he was saying
[3:38:34] in so much that he said
[3:38:37] if i do not the works of my father
[3:38:41] then don't even believe it
[3:38:45] if i don't have the character of my
[3:38:47] father
[3:38:48] character
[3:38:49] don't believe me
[3:38:51] don't believe my claims
[3:38:54] declaration if i haven't got the
[3:38:55] character my father is me
[3:38:58] character
[3:38:59] don't believe it at all
[3:39:05] so this will be my last point and i'll
[3:39:06] draw it to an end
[3:39:11] but i want you to realize that character
[3:39:14] is not the same as reputation
[3:39:19] a reputation is something uh by how
[3:39:22] other people know you reputation
[3:39:28] but character is something that is
[3:39:30] behind closed doors
[3:39:34] we might work
[3:40:35] [Applause]
[3:40:42] [Applause]
[3:40:54] who can raise your hand and say i will
[3:40:55] manifest
[3:41:04] [Applause]
[3:41:24] and that character will match
[3:41:53] so if you abide in me allah and i abide
[3:41:56] in you
[3:41:58] then what hey hello
[3:42:02] then ask hello
[3:42:04] put the spoken word
[3:42:06] into action hello
[3:42:21] the spoken word can pull out a bribe
[3:42:25] so let's put the word into action
[3:42:32] [Applause]
[3:42:36] so whatever our need is
[3:42:40] whatever is within your heart
[3:42:44] if there's a deep calling there must be
[3:42:45] a deep to response
[3:42:49] so if your heart is looking for more of
[3:42:51] god let's see
[3:42:54] i believe that we can even put it into
[3:42:55] our daily lives
[3:42:58] there's a deep in your heart looking for
[3:43:00] a bride
[3:43:02] and there must be a deep response
[3:43:13] [Applause]
[3:43:18] he's not only limited what i can preach
[3:43:21] he's not only limited to what brother
[3:43:23] fosten or our other brothers can preach
[3:43:27] but he has more revelation that he's
[3:43:29] willing to pour into it
[3:43:32] all
[3:43:37] may the lord
[3:43:39] [Applause]
[3:43:48] give us a song to praise the lord a
[3:43:50] little bit
[3:43:53] word of god
[3:44:01] [Music]
[3:44:11] we
