[27:03] like
[27:06] [Music]
[27:36] [Music]
[27:46] [Music]
[27:55] No man can take credit for healing. Not
[27:58] looking good.
[28:02] [Music]
[28:13] [Music]
[28:46] There's no
[28:47] doctor now. Doctors give you aid and
[28:51] they are operating to make things
[28:53] necessary. But you never heard a doctor
[28:56] say that he's obedient.
[29:12] What's
[29:24] up? Hallelujah.
[29:52] Look out.
[30:23] and not

[35:11] That's what
[36:13] Glory.
[36:40] [Music]

[42:25] You

[42:34] humble
[42:39] cry
[42:43] while thou
[42:45] [Music]
[42:49] go
[42:50] to the past
[42:56] Hear our humble cry. Lord,
[43:00] do not pass just by.
[43:04] Let our humble cry stop you
[43:08] tonight. Oh Lord
[43:10] Almighty. We want to thank you for what
[43:13] you are for us, for what you are doing
[43:16] for us. Oh God, we are gathered
[43:21] tonight to dedicate this
[43:23] time for prayer because your prophet
[43:27] said in order to grow
[43:30] spiritually we have to listen to the
[43:32] word of God and we have to pray. Father,
[43:36] we have heard a lot now we are
[43:40] coming to pray so that that thing all
[43:44] that there was
[43:45] preached could be
[43:48] materialized. We commit therefore this
[43:50] gathering into your
[43:52] hands. Bless your people. Touch each and
[43:56] every one of us and incline your ears to
[44:00] every prayer.
[44:03] [Music]
[44:05] We ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[44:10] Amen. Amen. You may be seated as I greet
[44:14] you tonight in the name of the Lord
[44:16] Jesus.
[44:19] We had
[44:21] a wonderful meetings
[44:26] uh not only just for the
[44:30] Easter but uh we have been having a lot
[44:34] of good
[44:37] meetings and uh if you will
[44:42] notice most of the meetings are centered
[44:46] around
[44:50] revival, divine
[44:53] healing, deliverance
[44:55] which is wonderful,
[44:58] but uh I don't know if you pay
[45:01] attention when uh Pastor Gideon was
[45:06] preaching, he said something about
[45:12] maintaining your
[45:14] healing and uh that really touched my
[45:18] heart.
[45:21] I remember it has been maybe two three
[45:23] years.
[45:26] Uh I think I was
[45:28] uh teaching on uh the principles of
[45:34] God but there was a chapter that I did
[45:39] not speak
[45:42] on. It was on how to maintain your
[45:46] healing.
[45:49] And I think after all that we have
[45:53] heard I have to remind you about these
[45:59] things. We don't want to be living from
[46:03] service to
[46:07] service. We don't want to be leaving
[46:10] from coming to church going home and uh
[46:13] in that uh
[46:19] But we want to
[46:20] come. What we receive, we keep it and we
[46:25] maintain
[46:27] it. Otherwise, it will be a certain
[46:33] cycle and we need to get out of that
[46:37] cycle.
[46:39] So for
[46:40] tonight, uh I'm going to exhort on how
[46:43] to maintain your healing.
[46:49] and for inspiration.
[46:51] Thy faith has healed you.
[46:56] So we are going to take
[47:00] uh Luke chapter
[47:03] 18 vers 1-7
[47:08] Luke 18
[47:12] because we need to understand one thing.
[47:17] Divine healing
[47:20] works only by
[47:23] faith. It's not by your
[47:28] church. Either you believe or you don't
[47:31] believe are a believer or you are not a
[47:35] believer. But if you believe and you
[47:38] take God by his
[47:40] word, he is under obligation to heal
[47:43] you.
[47:46] And uh we need also to be perseverant.
[47:52] So this parable said
[47:55] and he spake a parable
[47:58] unto unto them to this end that men
[48:02] ought always to pray and not to faint.
[48:07] [Music]
[48:12] saying, "There was in a city a judge
[48:15] which feared not God, neither regarded
[48:28] man. widow in that city. And she came
[48:32] unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine
[48:42] adversary." And he would not for a
[48:46] while, but afterward he said within
[48:49] himself, "Though I fear not God, nor
[48:53] regard men,
[49:04] Yet because this widow troubled me, I
[49:08] will avenge her, lest by her continual
[49:12] coming she weary me.
[49:25] And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[49:28] judge said?"
[49:36] And shall not God avenge his own elect,
[49:41] which cry day and night unto him, though
[49:45] he bear long with them.
[49:56] Amen. Amen. Think about this parable.
[50:00] That unjust
[50:03] judge was fear not God. She had no
[50:07] consideration for
[50:09] nobody. But because the widow, that
[50:14] widow who always come insisting,
[50:17] insisting
[50:20] Finally he said I have to avenge her
[50:27] so that she cannot continually come to
[50:29] bother me.
[50:32] We are going to close with Hebrews
[50:43] 11. Hebrews 11 verse one.
[50:50] Now faith is the substance of things
[50:54] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[50:58] seen.
[51:08] the reading of his word.
[51:18] I want to say this.
[51:21] We have just to continue praying.
[51:25] We have always to continue to persevere
[51:30] in prayer and in faith.
[51:35] Not to have this kind of faith
[51:39] when uh you are always looking for
[51:42] something to lift you
[51:46] up which is not bad but as soon as I
[51:50] think is
[51:52] stopped and we go back to the
[51:57] normal but the real faith is to
[52:01] continue we don't need to put ourself in
[52:04] a position
[52:08] that uh we come to church when they say,
[52:12] "Oh, you have to be healed."
[52:15] Oh, you jump. Oh, and and really I
[52:19] believe at that
[52:21] time. When you have faith to grasp
[52:26] it on the spot, you are healed.
[52:32] But
[52:34] after a while,
[52:36] do we maintain
[52:38] that or we need just us to come every
[52:43] day? We are going to have
[52:46] a twins
[52:48] triplex. It's
[52:50] wonderful. But what has been said, what
[52:54] has been
[52:55] received, keep it
[52:58] up. Amen. Amen.
[53:03] Because in the way God does
[53:06] things, brother told us there is a
[53:10] difference
[53:12] between miracle and divine
[53:17] healing. Miracle
[53:20] will happen on the
[53:21] spot. Boom. A blind eyes
[53:26] open and start walking.
[53:30] A people stand up.
[53:34] Wonderful.
[53:35] But miracle
[53:39] are less than divine
[53:44] healing. Divine healing it is something
[53:48] that we have to fight and maintain and
[53:52] keep it
[53:55] up. Amen. Amen. Brother said in the
[54:01] message of faith preached August 15,
[54:05] 1956.
[54:08] Uh this is just for introduction.
[54:12] Paragraph five. I know that uh sometimes
[54:17] you can go into
[54:21] a
[54:25] teaching of just how to maintain a
[54:28] divine healing.
[54:33] uh you have to look at uh many
[54:36] aspect and touch on
[54:40] demonology because Satan knows
[54:44] that when you come to church you receive
[54:47] it. He knows that and he's filled
[54:54] is when you go out and you see little
[54:58] symptoms and you start doubting and this
[55:01] is where he's going to knock you
[55:04] down. And if we are not taught
[55:08] enough, we don't know what to do, how to
[55:13] react, we will be praying sometimes in
[55:16] vain.
[55:17] Listen to brother, but then it's like a
[55:23] little animal run over in the
[55:27] street, a little dog or
[55:30] something, but leave him lay there for
[55:34] about 72
[55:38] hours and watch what takes place.
[55:43] He's way bigger than he was the first
[55:48] time. See, it shrinks, then it goes to
[55:55] swelling. For as soon as that growth
[55:59] begin to
[56:03] swell and the patient thinks
[56:07] that, oh, I'm so sick.
[56:12] Oh, I'm so sick.
[56:14] [Music]
[56:15] I lost my
[56:19] healing. You know that you can lose your
[56:21] healing.
[56:24] You come to church, they pray for you,
[56:27] you are
[56:29] healed and after
[56:32] you lose completely that
[56:34] healing and you and I believe sometimes
[56:38] we are living in this kind of uh uh
[56:42] [Music]
[56:44] routine. You come to church, they preach
[56:47] the word, you feel good, you praise God.
[56:51] As soon as the service is over,
[56:54] What you
[56:55] receive is
[56:58] gone. That's a sign you got your
[57:03] healing. You got just it vice
[57:09] versa and I believe without any
[57:13] doubt that the word of God is
[57:16] true. Every time it has been brought to
[57:21] action.
[57:23] It must produce this effect. The
[57:26] effects people are healed all the time.
[57:30] But the question is, are they
[57:33] maintaining that healing?
[57:38] That's why brother Bam give the example
[57:40] of the little
[57:43] dog when it killed
[57:46] after a while it start growing
[57:51] and then and then in
[57:53] strength but when it's
[57:55] growing it the sign
[57:59] that when you are sick for
[58:02] example or you may have a tumor or a
[58:05] cancer
[58:07] when they pray for you or any sickness.
[58:11] If you feel like it's becoming to hurt
[58:15] more, that's a sign of
[58:19] healing, but it's not a sign to be
[58:24] discouraged. And that's the step where
[58:27] the devil come
[58:30] on. See, they pray for you. They
[58:33] anointed you with oil.
[58:35] But look at now it start hurting more.
[58:39] If it hurts more say praise the Lord
[58:43] because I am healed. And at that time
[58:46] it's a time to
[58:49] testify and maintain that
[58:54] testimony. Brham
[58:56] said and I suppose in the afternoon
[59:00] service
[59:04] they are teaching those things
[59:10] anyhow. So in the big campaigns we try
[59:14] to get that
[59:18] in and in my
[59:21] tent. I am going to try to do it myself
[59:25] in the afternoon
[59:29] service. Listen to what he saying.
[59:33] what he's going to do in the service
[59:34] afternoon.
[59:37] Give the instructions
[59:40] on how to approach,
[59:43] how to maintain your healing.
[59:48] Amen. Amen. It's a it's an instruction
[59:54] on how to maintain your
[59:58] healing just as much as to know how to
[1:00:02] maintain
[1:00:07] it. But try to repeat what I'm saying.
[1:00:10] Don't try to go
[1:00:12] ahead just as much to know how to
[1:00:15] maintain it.
[1:00:19] And it is to receive
[1:00:22] it. So if you receive it, you have to
[1:00:25] maintain it. If you maintain it, you
[1:00:29] have to believe that you have received
[1:00:30] it. And that should be coming in your
[1:00:33] mind all the
[1:00:35] time. Otherwise brother we will have uh
[1:00:40] services after
[1:00:42] services turning around on the same
[1:00:45] thing and result is not
[1:00:51] materialized. Are you with
[1:00:53] me we want to come to a
[1:00:58] spot they pray for you and you say you
[1:01:02] believe you maintain that prayer.
[1:01:06] They anoint you with oil. You maintain
[1:01:09] it. It's not service after service.
[1:01:15] You know my bottle of oil will end.
[1:01:21] No. No.
[1:01:23] Are you with me? So if it leave it a
[1:01:26] little bit if it's a new
[1:01:29] case then they can pray for you. But if
[1:01:33] it in existing, let me ask you, how many
[1:01:36] times shall we pray for the same thing?
[1:01:45] Are you with me?
[1:01:48] Is it the
[1:01:49] truth? We We have to move forward. We
[1:01:52] have to make a step forward.
[1:01:57] Oh, brother, I get this.
[1:02:00] Pray for me.
[1:02:01] I believe with all my
[1:02:03] faith and you pray, I take it and I
[1:02:08] start moving. I've been prayed for God
[1:02:13] is going to enter into
[1:02:15] action based on that prayer of faith and
[1:02:19] my faith. That's why Brham said we have
[1:02:23] to give instructions.
[1:02:30] I will give you a few
[1:02:33] example even in the Bible. Do you know
[1:02:37] that
[1:02:38] Jesus he prayed for the
[1:02:41] people he never said I have healed you?
[1:02:47] He always said thy faith
[1:02:51] has healed you. Amen. Thy faith, thy
[1:02:54] faith, thy faith.
[1:03:00] If you don't have faith,
[1:03:02] then you can come. Pray for me to have a
[1:03:07] faith but not pray for me to be healed
[1:03:11] for
[1:03:13] that. Pastor,
[1:03:15] am pray for it, pastor.
[1:03:21] Uh
[1:03:27] vent where is the
[1:03:30] faith unless God has put that desire
[1:03:37] again
[1:03:39] but it's not it should not be a routine
[1:03:47] because Our faith does not depend on
[1:03:52] anyone.
[1:03:56] Amen. Amen. Our faith is
[1:04:00] once we take it and we move
[1:04:05] forward. Let me give you a few
[1:04:07] scriptures
[1:04:09] here. Jesus never said, "I made thee
[1:04:14] whole.
[1:04:18] When they say I make thee whole, that
[1:04:23] mean Yeah, that's how he said. Jesus
[1:04:27] never said that. He always said thy
[1:04:35] faith and if a pagan
[1:04:39] come he
[1:04:41] believes with faith God is also under
[1:04:45] obligation to heal
[1:04:48] him. That's why in Pentecost they have
[1:04:52] things. It's a matter of faith,
[1:04:56] but as we have the faith of the age,
[1:05:01] the faith of William Brham.
[1:05:04] Amen. Amen. Bless my faith. Bless your
[1:05:08] faith. Let us move
[1:05:11] on. Let us take the Bible. Mark chapter
[1:05:16] 10. Let us get to from verse
[1:05:20] 50 to 52.
[1:05:23] talking about the blind Baptist.
[1:05:27] And he casting away his garment rose and
[1:05:31] came to Jesus.
[1:05:39] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:05:42] What will thou that I should do unto
[1:05:45] thee?
[1:05:51] The blind man said unto him, "Lord, that
[1:05:54] I might receive my sight." Amen.
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] Listen to what Jesus said. And Jesus
[1:06:04] said unto him, "Go thy
[1:06:08] way. My faith has made you."
[1:06:11] Huh? That's what Jesus said. What did he
[1:06:15] said? Whose faith?
[1:06:20] blind
[1:06:21] batimus. He Jesus said, "Thy faith has
[1:06:25] made thee
[1:06:29] whole." And immediately he receive his
[1:06:32] sight and follow Jesus in the
[1:06:37] way. Amen. Amen. I want you to pay
[1:06:40] attention closer to attention to the
[1:06:42] scripture.
[1:06:47] Matthew chapter 9,
[1:06:50] let us take verse 20 to 22.
[1:06:55] This is about the woman with blood
[1:06:58] issue.
[1:07:01] And behold, a woman which was deceased
[1:07:05] with an issue of blood 12 years came
[1:07:09] behind him and touched the hem of his
[1:07:12] garment.
[1:07:23] For she said within herself, "If I may
[1:07:28] but touch his garment, I shall behold."
[1:07:37] But Jesus turned him about, and when he
[1:07:42] saw her, he said, "Daughter, be of good
[1:07:46] comfort. My faith has made thee whole."
[1:07:53] Are you with the Bible?
[1:07:55] It's thy faith.
[1:08:00] Thy faith has made thee whole.
[1:08:09] And a woman was made whole for that
[1:08:12] hour.
[1:08:16] Luke chapter 17
[1:08:20] from verse 15.
[1:08:24] This is the 10 lepers that uh Jesus
[1:08:29] pray for them.
[1:08:31] And one of them when he saw that
[1:08:33] Jesus that he was healed, turned back
[1:08:37] and with a loud voice glorified God.
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:45] And fell down on his face, face at his
[1:08:49] feet, giving him thanks. And he was a
[1:08:52] Samaritan.
[1:09:00] And Jesus answering said, "Were there
[1:09:03] not 10 cleans? But where are the nine?
[1:09:16] found that return to give glory to God,
[1:09:20] save this
[1:09:27] stranger. And he said unto him,
[1:09:31] "Arise, go thy way, thy faith has made
[1:09:36] thee whole."
[1:09:44] Amen. Amen brother
[1:09:46] everywhere dealing with
[1:09:49] Jesus or brother or any minister it's
[1:09:54] all about your
[1:09:57] faith and if you don't have such faith
[1:10:01] then continue to come back and
[1:10:04] forth brother don't take me
[1:10:06] wrong if you have to come
[1:10:09] come because you have little faith until
[1:10:13] your faith is going to
[1:10:17] Pastor Gon was telling
[1:10:19] me last time I pray for the people
[1:10:24] but you know some people they need the
[1:10:28] touch the
[1:10:30] contact which is
[1:10:32] true. They need just to put them the
[1:10:36] vest or put
[1:10:40] oil. This is how if it's going to help
[1:10:43] somebody's
[1:10:44] faith, let us do
[1:10:48] it. But we are talking about that kind
[1:10:51] of
[1:10:52] faith. I'm prayed
[1:10:55] for and I'm
[1:10:58] persevering and I have no doubt.
[1:11:02] what they prayed me
[1:11:05] for, even 20 years
[1:11:07] ago, God will never forget that prayer.
[1:11:12] Amen. Amen. Matthew chapter 15,
[1:11:17] you know that
[1:11:19] story of that woman.
[1:11:30] She
[1:11:32] came asking, begging
[1:11:37] to show you brother faith it's not
[1:11:41] something
[1:11:42] maybe you must be
[1:11:45] convinced that woman was sure that this
[1:11:51] Jesus this is he I my healing is
[1:11:55] there now Even if Jesus tried to push
[1:12:00] her
[1:12:02] back, faith is a
[1:12:06] conviction. He Jesus said, you know, I'm
[1:12:11] not sent to the uh lost
[1:12:15] sheep for the Isra the people of
[1:12:20] Israel. It doesn't matter. Have mercy.
[1:12:24] And you
[1:12:25] know the food I have this precious
[1:12:30] message is not for the dog.
[1:12:34] Lord dogs they don't deserve to eat on
[1:12:38] the
[1:12:39] table. I don't need a seven course
[1:12:44] menu but I just stay on the under the
[1:12:49] table for the little crown.
[1:12:55] He was a perseverance. Perseverance.
[1:12:58] Brother Bam said faith and perseverance
[1:13:03] they are brothers.
[1:13:05] You cannot have faith and not
[1:13:08] perseverance.
[1:13:10] If you see somebody say I have faith but
[1:13:13] doesn't
[1:13:15] persevere that's not faith.
[1:13:19] They are brothers.
[1:13:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:25] So they continue. Let's go to the end
[1:13:27] maybe verse 28. You know the story of
[1:13:30] this verse 28.
[1:13:34] Then Jesus answer and said unto her, oh
[1:13:38] woman, great is thy faith.
[1:13:42] Amen.
[1:13:47] That means a real
[1:13:49] faith must be
[1:13:52] tested. Jesus testing that
[1:13:56] woman. If they fight a woman, that woman
[1:13:58] did not have
[1:14:00] faith like some church
[1:14:03] members. If the pastor said,
[1:14:06] you know, I cannot waste my time to
[1:14:08] preach to
[1:14:11] you race of
[1:14:18] dogs to the door.
[1:14:22] Amen. Amen. But that woman, she had
[1:14:29] faith. Amen. Amen. That's what really we
[1:14:32] call faith.
[1:14:35] It's not a
[1:14:38] hope. Peter said, "Oh master, to whom
[1:14:43] shall we
[1:14:44] go?" Again, Jesus was casting them away.
[1:14:49] 70 left.
[1:14:52] And he said, "I don't need a big church.
[1:14:55] The rest of you, what are you doing
[1:14:58] here?" Some say, "Did you hear
[1:15:03] that? I won't be here anymore." They
[1:15:05] walk away. But Peter,
[1:15:10] master, where
[1:15:12] else? To whom else?
[1:15:16] faith, perseverance.
[1:15:21] Jesus told that woman,
[1:15:24] "Oh woman, great is thy faith,
[1:15:29] not great is my faith."
[1:15:34] Brother, faith is also a gift.
[1:15:40] Amen.
[1:15:42] Be it unto thee, even at thou
[1:15:49] wilt. And her daughter was made whole
[1:15:53] from that very hour.
[1:15:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:01] Let me review my examples here. Beside
[1:16:05] blind the Bimus and the 10 lepers,
[1:16:07] probably they were men.
[1:16:15] and they pray. But the woman with the
[1:16:18] blood issue, that was a woman. This one
[1:16:22] was a woman. And the last one I'm taking
[1:16:26] is the woman who wash Jesus
[1:16:29] feet. And woman always typify a church.
[1:16:36] I for problem with all your problems.
[1:16:42] You must have faith to go over
[1:16:45] that. Not be cry baby all the time.
[1:16:52] Luke 7, Luke chapter
[1:16:55] 7 verse 48.
[1:17:01] And he said unto her, "Thy sins are
[1:17:05] forgiven." Stop there.
[1:17:09] even the forgiveness of your
[1:17:12] sins. It's by
[1:17:16] faith. It's not I did
[1:17:19] something or I committed
[1:17:25] adultery which
[1:17:27] cannot finish. Amen. Amen. I did a
[1:17:31] mistake. I know I did wrong.
[1:17:34] The Holy Ghost convinced me and I look
[1:17:38] at the scripture. What does the
[1:17:41] scripture recommend to fix
[1:17:44] it? I'm a married man. I take my wife. I
[1:17:48] confess with all my
[1:17:51] heart. Forgive me. And I keep
[1:17:55] questioning. Did you really forgive me?
[1:17:58] Let us fulfill what the prophet said.
[1:18:01] Let us go see.
[1:18:04] That woman. I did that with this woman.
[1:18:10] And you woman, you are not my wife. Look
[1:18:14] at my wife. She's
[1:18:17] beautiful. That was a mistake. Would you
[1:18:20] also forgive
[1:18:22] me? I forgive you, brother. Confess his
[1:18:28] sin is forgiven.
[1:18:33] Now the battle is going to come in your
[1:18:35] mind.
[1:18:38] When the pastor is going to preach,
[1:18:42] oh he's he's not talking to
[1:18:46] me, he's talking to those people who
[1:18:48] have never
[1:18:50] confessed. But don't
[1:18:54] you keep talking about it? Which
[1:18:57] position are you putting yourself?
[1:19:03] about me all the time. You are not in
[1:19:05] that
[1:19:06] context. Unless you put yourself in that
[1:19:13] context, this is why they say that's
[1:19:15] your problem.
[1:19:19] Amen. Amen. I am not concerned
[1:19:23] if they say people who who
[1:19:26] steal. Did you see me stealing at your
[1:19:29] house?
[1:19:31] That's not me.
[1:19:34] So even the forgiveness of
[1:19:37] sins, it's by faith that all that I have
[1:19:42] done is in the sea of
[1:19:46] forgetfulness. If the
[1:19:48] devil try to remind you
[1:19:51] that it's easy, Satan, you see the water
[1:19:55] I went to in the baptism.
[1:19:59] Okay. Okay, it's already gone.
[1:20:04] If you are a warrior, go get my sin in
[1:20:08] that world. Bring it
[1:20:11] here, then I will
[1:20:13] believe that I'm a sinner. If you cannot
[1:20:17] bring it, it's in the sea of God
[1:20:22] forgetfulness. And that's how faith must
[1:20:25] kick in.
[1:20:27] I'm not saying go do it and I'm not
[1:20:30] saying that but I'm showing you another
[1:20:33] face. Amen. Amen. So then thy sins are
[1:20:38] forgiven. Next verse and they they that
[1:20:43] sat at the meat with him began to say
[1:20:47] within themselves, who is this that
[1:20:50] forgive sin also?
[1:21:00] And he said unto the
[1:21:03] woman, "My
[1:21:08] faith," this can be a good teaching, not
[1:21:11] just thy faith has saved you, thy thy
[1:21:15] faith has forgiven you, thy faith has
[1:21:19] healed you.
[1:21:21] Amen. Amen. So all it's all about thy
[1:21:25] faith.
[1:21:28] Amen. Amen. Let's take brother Barnam
[1:21:32] here
[1:21:34] in the message the living Jesus Christ.
[1:21:39] The living Jesus
[1:21:41] Christ paragraph 39.
[1:21:50] And I will assure you
[1:21:53] If the believer will come and
[1:21:58] believe, right here,
[1:22:02] presently, no matter what's wrong with
[1:22:07] it, it will take place right
[1:22:12] here. But if the word of God is
[1:22:15] preached with all the
[1:22:17] anointing and your faith is anointed,
[1:22:22] and you accept it, it's a done deal.
[1:22:28] You have never seen it
[1:22:31] fail and it
[1:22:34] won't. But now if you go out of
[1:22:39] here and
[1:22:42] disbelief or just with a little weak
[1:22:47] faith, it will come right back on
[1:22:51] you even worse than that what it was in
[1:22:55] the first place.
[1:23:00] So when the word is preached,
[1:23:04] you may not say don't say amen,
[1:23:08] say maybe.
[1:23:11] I'm not
[1:23:12] sure if you don't have faith.
[1:23:16] But if you
[1:23:18] believe it's the word of God and you say
[1:23:23] amen to
[1:23:25] it, stay with it.
[1:23:28] Because if you don't, those spirit they
[1:23:32] are casting casted
[1:23:34] out. When a bad spirit
[1:23:38] leaves, he will come back with seven
[1:23:43] more. And your condition
[1:23:46] will be worse than the the state before.
[1:23:52] For the unclean spirit goes out of a
[1:23:56] man, he walks in dry
[1:24:00] places. Is that
[1:24:02] right? Then he returns
[1:24:05] back. And if the good man of the house,
[1:24:11] the good man of the house
[1:24:13] is faith. So that mean when it
[1:24:17] leaves with
[1:24:19] faith. So that when he try to
[1:24:22] come, he looks faith. He look here
[1:24:27] faith, faith, faith,
[1:24:31] faith. There is no way.
[1:24:34] But if he saw the faith only
[1:24:37] here when he goes
[1:24:40] out there is no faith. He will say this
[1:24:45] person
[1:24:47] kicked me out
[1:24:49] once. But now I need seven
[1:24:55] moreh so that we can resist.
[1:24:59] Brother don't put yourself in that
[1:25:00] position.
[1:25:02] I don't know if there are people
[1:25:04] here who are always they kick
[1:25:08] out and the the devil goes and get seven
[1:25:12] more they stay they kick them maybe they
[1:25:17] kick only one six
[1:25:20] stay and the one who went bring seven
[1:25:24] more and they are 13 and they kick
[1:25:28] one the 12 you
[1:25:31] Seven
[1:25:32] more. Some may have
[1:25:37] 20. Doing that
[1:25:40] exercise. You come. You believe, they
[1:25:44] kick out, they come back. You have you
[1:25:48] have you have been surrounded with a lot
[1:25:50] of
[1:25:55] demons. Branam continued to tell us.
[1:25:59] Then he returned
[1:26:01] back. And if the good man of the house
[1:26:04] isn't there to keep him
[1:26:07] away, you must take God at his
[1:26:11] word, not your
[1:26:14] feelings, but take God at his
[1:26:18] word. Your
[1:26:20] faith keeps him
[1:26:25] away. Just refuse it.
[1:26:28] But when the the devil want to come,
[1:26:32] refuse it.
[1:26:35] Amen. Amen. Brother, it must be an
[1:26:38] exercise. You refuse it. Are you see
[1:26:43] something? I start talking to you. Oh,
[1:26:46] you know this kind of
[1:26:48] sickness. No, not that simple
[1:26:54] prayer and you can see most of the
[1:26:56] cases.
[1:26:58] you. Jesus did not even pray.
[1:27:01] He was just telling them your faith
[1:27:05] go your faith go.
[1:27:12] We we ended we ran out all the water
[1:27:15] that pastor bought from Israel. Believe
[1:27:16] we don't
[1:27:20] believe I will keep my downstairs.
[1:27:24] Brother sometimes we have done
[1:27:26] everything we
[1:27:29] could. I have the
[1:27:32] tissues on which brother
[1:27:35] prays. I keep it secretly and
[1:27:39] jealously it's for hard
[1:27:43] cases but the rest of the case you can't
[1:27:45] just believe and move
[1:27:53] on one time I was preaching in South
[1:27:57] Africa. I was
[1:27:59] preaching. Uh when I mention about that
[1:28:03] tissue after service, it was a line of
[1:28:06] people.
[1:28:08] I cut I start cutting even little
[1:28:13] little until it was
[1:28:16] finished. I have always a reserve
[1:28:18] somewhere
[1:28:22] hidden. Don't come ask unless very very
[1:28:25] critical.
[1:28:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:34] He will torment and peck at your
[1:28:39] door and hound at your
[1:28:43] windows, but just turn your head and
[1:28:47] keep on looking forward toward Christ
[1:28:50] and going on.
[1:28:56] Amen. Amen. If you
[1:28:59] believe how long the then how long the
[1:29:02] healing will
[1:29:07] last. Brother said in the message
[1:29:34] try to search for me. Uh,
[1:29:37] how long does healing
[1:29:42] last? Vanam said, "As long as faith
[1:29:50] last." Amen. Amen. How long healing will
[1:29:53] last?
[1:29:56] So if I'm healed
[1:29:57] today, I'm going to be healed for how
[1:30:02] long? I will be
[1:30:05] healed
[1:30:07] until long as my faith
[1:30:13] last. Amen.
[1:30:15] If you
[1:30:19] fail then you are going to lost lose
[1:30:22] your faith.
[1:30:26] I don't know if uh somebody can help
[1:30:28] them.
[1:30:30] Yeah, it's I don't know it it should be
[1:30:32] in the message diseases and affliction.
[1:30:36] Uh it's yes diseases and afflict. I
[1:30:40] don't know how I cut it. So someone
[1:30:43] said, "Does the healings last?"
[1:30:47] Someone said, "Does the healing last?"
[1:30:53] They last as long as faith
[1:31:01] lasts. That's the
[1:31:07] settlement. That's it.
[1:31:10] You come, you say you believe, they pray
[1:31:13] for you, you say you believe, keep
[1:31:18] believing. The day you are going to stop
[1:31:23] believing, your healing is going to
[1:31:26] stop and we have been in a cycle of
[1:31:29] stopping the healing.
[1:31:33] But when faith fails,
[1:31:38] then your healing will fail.
[1:31:42] Would you say every person that came to
[1:31:45] the altar and got converted will be a
[1:31:50] Christian all their days?
[1:31:57] He could be tonight a child of
[1:32:01] God and tomorrow be a child of the
[1:32:04] devil.
[1:32:06] Oh, don't say, "Oh, brother, I'm safe
[1:32:08] for Yes, you are save
[1:32:12] forever. As long as you believe you are
[1:32:16] saved." And if you come to say I'm not
[1:32:20] sure if I will
[1:32:21] save then you are
[1:32:26] lost. And when he loses faith in
[1:32:31] God what sent him back
[1:32:39] in uh paragraph 28 disease and
[1:32:42] afflictions.
[1:32:51] paragraph 28. And any power that could
[1:32:54] heal you here at this
[1:32:59] platform can keep you
[1:33:02] well. If that power that heals
[1:33:06] you in which you had
[1:33:08] faith, the same power must keep
[1:33:11] you. If you have confidence and you have
[1:33:15] faith, that's the reason I made this
[1:33:21] statement that nothing comes here
[1:33:26] but what is delivered here.
[1:33:30] Amen. When we come to church,
[1:33:34] nothing but what is delivered
[1:33:38] outside
[1:33:40] here outside here.
[1:33:43] It's according to your faith whether it
[1:33:48] stays. I have seen people come to the
[1:33:53] platform totally
[1:33:55] blind and read the same Bible.
[1:33:59] He came blind.
[1:34:01] They pray for him. Eyes open. He read
[1:34:04] the
[1:34:06] Bible. In less than five
[1:34:10] days, come back again just as blind as
[1:34:13] they ever
[1:34:17] was. Why did they read
[1:34:21] here? The power of the devil recognized
[1:34:24] the that gift of God and he had to
[1:34:27] leave.
[1:34:31] I know that's a real statement to
[1:34:35] make, but I know where I stand.
[1:34:40] I know who I have
[1:34:42] believed and I know his power to
[1:34:46] heal. Amen. Amen. So therefore, don't
[1:34:50] have this kind of faith that move,
[1:34:53] shift, etc.
[1:34:56] Even to the extent to think oh my case
[1:35:00] only if brother could be here. There
[1:35:04] were so many people in Braham
[1:35:07] meetings who are not
[1:35:10] healed. The principle of divine
[1:35:14] healing paragraph
[1:35:17] 24. No man can take credit for
[1:35:23] healing. Not even to a
[1:35:25] doctor. There is no doctor can heal
[1:35:28] you. Now doctors give you a
[1:35:33] and they will
[1:35:34] operate and thinks that
[1:35:37] necessary. But you never heard a doctor
[1:35:40] said that he could heal you because he
[1:35:45] can't. There's only one
[1:35:47] healer and that is
[1:35:50] God. Paragraph 36.
[1:35:53] Now, no man can heal
[1:35:56] you. When a preacher
[1:35:58] comes or anybody else and says, "Well,
[1:36:03] he has got healing
[1:36:06] power." That's
[1:36:09] error. Healing
[1:36:13] power lays in Calvary,
[1:36:16] not in man. In Calvary.
[1:36:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:24] One in a
[1:36:26] million
[1:36:50] ed. I went to pastor D's
[1:36:54] birthday. He turned
[1:36:58] 60. I was making joke with him.
[1:37:03] I say you the French people. Why you
[1:37:06] have to say
[1:37:19] you have
[1:37:23] 5010? Everything is by convention,
[1:37:25] right?
[1:37:27] The day they will agree, they will say
[1:37:30] it
[1:37:31] and like like what you you have created
[1:37:36] here. One in a million. Paragraph
[1:37:41] 80. Now healing is in the reach of every
[1:37:48] person. Remember healing is in you. It's
[1:37:53] in you. You just believe.
[1:37:56] that I am
[1:37:58] healed. Brother refuse those
[1:38:01] things even going to the medical
[1:38:05] exam. You go claiming your
[1:38:09] healing or they are going to check this.
[1:38:12] My blood pressure is
[1:38:15] normal. My blood sugar is
[1:38:18] normal. My everything is
[1:38:21] normal. Doctor say something. Doctor,
[1:38:24] you are
[1:38:27] mistaken. This is how faith will
[1:38:30] work. I have to close up
[1:38:33] here. You have to be perseverant
[1:38:36] in the message. Perseverance
[1:38:38] perseverance. If you believe we have
[1:38:41] organized all these meetings for the
[1:38:43] sake of the
[1:38:46] people. Now we want to see the result.
[1:38:54] Then I got to thinking on
[1:38:58] perseverance and I thought yes many man
[1:39:02] is
[1:39:04] perseverant before you can be
[1:39:07] perseverant. You have to have faith in
[1:39:10] what you are trying to
[1:39:13] achieve. You have got first to have
[1:39:16] faith before you can be persevered.
[1:39:23] So faith and perseverance
[1:39:27] works end in end together.
[1:39:32] They are
[1:39:34] brothers. You must
[1:39:36] believe or you will not have
[1:39:42] confidence. You won't you won't know
[1:39:44] whether you are right or
[1:39:49] wrong. But when you have reached that
[1:39:54] place that you have faith in what you
[1:39:57] are trying to
[1:40:01] do then you can be
[1:40:04] persevering. That's the concluding
[1:40:08] statement. We will need to draw a lesson
[1:40:13] tonight. I have to reach that place.
[1:40:20] the place of
[1:40:24] faith to believe
[1:40:27] the word of God and nothing
[1:40:30] else. And when you reach that level of
[1:40:34] faith, then you will be
[1:40:56] persever. We are going to pray that God
[1:40:58] help us maintain the victory.
[1:41:04] Don't pray for something
[1:41:06] else. Pray for you to maintain the
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:12] victory. You can have a victory over a
[1:41:16] cigarette. Victory on
[1:41:19] pornography. You have to maintain that
[1:41:21] victory.
[1:41:26] My
[1:41:27] faith looks
[1:41:30] up to
[1:41:35] thee, thou
[1:41:38] lamb of
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:46] Calary,
[1:41:50] saveior divine.
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] Now hear me
[1:42:03] while I
[1:42:08] pray. Call my
[1:42:12] king the way.
[1:42:18] Oh, let me
[1:42:21] Lord this
[1:42:24] day behold.
[1:42:34] He
[1:42:36] died rich
[1:42:39] grace in
[1:42:43] power. Strength
[1:42:46] to my
[1:42:49] faithing heart.
[1:42:56] My sin is
[1:43:03] found
[1:43:05] as thou has
[1:43:09] done for
[1:43:12] me.
[1:43:15] Oh my
[1:43:19] love to thee.
[1:43:24] You are made
[1:43:28] changes beyond
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:52] Here
[1:43:54] I mean
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:59] pray
[1:44:01] be thou my
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:08] God be
[1:44:13] I'm
[1:44:15] turn
[1:44:18] today.
[1:44:20] Why
[1:44:22] sorrow
[1:44:24] tears
[1:44:27] away?
[1:44:29] No, let
[1:44:34] me stray from thee.
[1:44:43] Let us pray together.
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:45:03] I don't
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:23] know.
[1:45:32] [Music]
