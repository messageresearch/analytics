[41:54] prophet Palace the prophet is speaking
[41:56] the Jews woman the prophet balance the
[42:00] perfect about the bride
[42:03] the same scripture

[46:15] at the end time okay right
[46:20] and though it seems that at the end at
[46:24] this time
[46:28] this time this time right here

[46:49] bread of Neville in his accident
[46:52] brother Chris there is
[46:57] something let's see he looks like that

[49:30] get to the inside
[49:32] then he comes in he lives
[49:35] rides on the hide waves
