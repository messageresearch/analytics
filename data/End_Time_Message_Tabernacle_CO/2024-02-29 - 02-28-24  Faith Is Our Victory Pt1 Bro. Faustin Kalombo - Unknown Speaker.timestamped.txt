[34:25] okay
[34:28] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the

[34:42] our
[34:44] faith let bow
[34:50] our Lord Our God once again we are
[34:52] coming before
[34:55] that we know that we have nothing in
[35:03] ourselves you yourself you created us
[35:05] you know that we have
[35:10] nothing that is why you promised the
[35:12] comforter of the
[35:15] spirit he alone can lead us through all
[35:18] the
[35:20] truth that is why we bow Bing
[35:23] our we pray in the name of the Lord
[35:26] Jesus Christ

[36:16] amen you may be seated God bless you
[36:20] once
[36:24] again I would like to share with you a
[36:26] little the
[36:29] subject faith is our
[36:32] Victory I love to talk about
[36:37] faith because a
[36:40] Believer is a
[36:44] fighter he doesn't fight with the
[36:48] bomb he doesn't fight with
[36:52] a but God has given him something to
[36:54] fight with it's his faith
[36:57] his
[36:58] faith it's your
[37:02] Victory the devil knows that your faith
[37:04] is your
[37:08] Victory he's coming to take away the
[37:11] faith when you have
[37:14] no you can have all the
[37:16] knowled that won't help you
[37:20] because for the
[37:23] word it has to be added to the faith
[37:28] that is why
[37:30] brother faith is a revelation coming
[37:32] from
[37:34] God to have the knowledge of
[37:37] God to have the true word of
[37:41] God to see the
[37:43] effect you need to have
[37:45] faith and we see
[37:47] [Music]
[37:50] today the devil is working to take away
[37:52] fa from
[37:54] people that is why with the manufacture
[37:57] a lot of
[38:00] church only comes by the hearing of the
[38:04] word and the devil what he
[38:07] do he multiply a lot of program in the
[38:10] church taking
[38:13] the the word that ra
[38:16] [Music]
[38:20] faith when activ
[38:24] Church you will notice that that church
[38:26] has no
[38:27] fath it becomes
[38:29] [Music]
[38:30] mechanical and that church cannot
[38:33] overcome the faith is your
[38:37] Victory now when you have you are in the
[38:44] church you see many
[38:51] time people are so happy
[38:54] when they enjoy when they
[38:58] emotion
[38:59] and but when the word
[39:01] comes they're not ready to receive
[39:04] [Music]
[39:06] it notice it's the devil
[39:11] doing placing you
[39:15] ining beleving that
[39:19] you I pay a
[39:22] TI and you think you are satisfied with
[39:25] that
[39:27] but look
[39:28] at at the end things are
[39:34] coming and reality happening before
[39:38] us because everyone will reach the
[39:42] end
[39:43] [Music]
[39:49] your overcome this
[39:53] life only the Overcomers that
[39:58] you will have
[40:03] Victory you will notice that that
[40:10] will only the word will
[40:16] stand we have to pay attention to the
[40:19] word not just to have intellectual
[40:23] knowledge because they are study
[40:25] biblical stud
[40:27] things are
[40:31] [Music]
[40:32] happening witnesses that can recite the
[40:35] whole Bible all the
[40:39] verses just in front of a little trial
[40:42] the forsake to drop
[40:44] it but we
[40:46] see the Bible is telling
[40:49] usth it's your
[40:53] Victory it's your
[40:55] victory
[40:57] and that faith has to be applied by the
[41:00] word I'm going to read brother
[41:04] BR
[41:10] just there's a lot of victory that has
[41:15] been for example
[41:17] when you
[41:20] enjoy you thought you had
[41:22] [Music]
[41:24] Victory thought you overcame
[41:27] [Music]
[41:29] receive the message of your
[41:31] time but your Victory doesn't
[41:35] last why your Victory doesn't
[41:39] last because you just lean on your
[41:46] Illusionist
[41:49] what now I'm going to read it in
[41:55] English
[42:01] they need to project because sometime
[42:03] you might not
[42:06] give is our
[42:10] Victory but let me tell you uh something
[42:16] tonight you on the in and
[42:20] outside of this
[42:25] building
[42:26] you are going to wind up at a
[42:29] destination one of these
[42:33] days that's going to be in the Valley of
[42:37] the shadow of
[42:39] death you I advise
[42:43] you at this hour to prepare to meet the
[42:48] Lord that will have to meet you at the
[42:55] hour
[42:57] you will either meet him as a
[43:02] masterpiece that he has worked
[43:08] on or a floating piece DW uh a d wood to
[43:15] go into your final
[43:23] destination so don't use this life
[43:26] just like a drift
[43:31] around float uh float
[43:35] around and get a better
[43:38] job and to dress
[43:40] better to get a new
[43:43] [Music]
[43:47] television life mean more than
[43:52] that don't you try to use it just to say
[43:56] well if I was uh of them joh
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] Church Life mean more than
[44:08] that life mean more than to join a
[44:14] church mean more than to have a good
[44:18] job why because one of these day we're
[44:22] going to come to the
[44:24] end we going to the
[44:27] Lord the one we come every time to
[44:30] serve the one we claim that we are
[44:33] [Music]
[44:35] sons and that day you going to find that
[44:38] all your work is is
[44:42] nothing
[44:43] why because you didn't
[44:47] understand that you need to have a
[44:51] purpose when you come to God you need to
[44:54] have a purpose
[44:57] don't just come to God like that you
[45:00] need to have a purpose what is your
[45:02] purpose to coming to
[45:05] God if you don't have any
[45:08] purpose yourself will not be
[45:12] solid because you don't have any
[45:15] purpose you are just shifting up and
[45:20] down you don't have any
[45:24] Focus but
[45:26] said that's why your your Victory
[45:29] doesn't
[45:31] last you can have a victory
[45:34] today because somebody pray for you you
[45:37] have a
[45:38] victory and when you go out the same
[45:42] faith that bring you to
[45:45] victory the doubt going to get you out
[45:48] of your
[45:51] Victory doubt going to get you
[45:54] out because doubt is a contrary of
[45:59] faith and for your faith to be solid you
[46:03] need to have a purpose what is your
[46:06] purpose you come to go to have a good
[46:08] car did you come here to become rich you
[46:12] come here to have a good job what is
[46:15] your
[46:19] purpose say that
[46:23] Daniel when he went to another strange
[46:27] country he was a slave there but he had
[46:31] a
[46:32] purpose he decide by himself that I will
[46:36] not def my faith with
[46:41] anything and he stand by his purpose and
[46:45] we see through the Bible that he
[46:50] overcome Abraham
[46:53] overcome because he had a purpose
[46:56] [Music]
[46:57] if you have you come to the church you
[47:00] come to the message you need to have a
[47:03] purpose because if you don't have a
[47:06] purpose just a little
[47:09] shaky you're going to pick up your Bible
[47:11] and work
[47:13] out in this church they don't love
[47:16] people the pastor didn't greet
[47:21] me if you come here because it's a
[47:24] community you want to
[47:26] Jo you going to walk the same way
[47:31] came says when Daniel had a purpose in
[47:37] his
[47:38] heart and the devil made him Pro prove
[47:44] it but we found out that it stoned good
[47:50] in the face of the angry
[47:54] lion
[47:57] because even if you have a clear
[48:02] purpose your faith become
[48:05] solid there is nothing that can overcome
[48:08] your
[48:10] faith your faith is your
[48:13] Victory and it's going to stand in every
[48:17] occasion it's going to stand in every
[48:21] situation and everywhere you go that
[48:24] faith will stand
[48:29] one day I was coming
[48:33] from and uh in the
[48:35] plane the pilot said that there is a
[48:39] cloud that cannot land in
[48:42] Miami
[48:46] cloud and uh the pl start
[48:51] shaking and everyone in his Corner start
[48:54] singing gospel
[48:57] song start
[48:59] praying I just
[49:02] quiet I don't pray because of the
[49:05] situation I didn't believe to God not to
[49:08] die in this
[49:13] flesh no he promised me eternal
[49:17] life he promised me eternal
[49:20] life even though you are dead you shall
[49:24] live
[49:26] I don't scar to
[49:29] die it can come any
[49:32] time I'm glad that I know
[49:37] him and I don't have fear to meet
[49:40] him because I did my best I can
[49:44] do brother Bram says if you are
[49:48] sincere honest God is
[49:52] obligated to reveal himself to you and
[49:56] when God reveal himself to you it's not
[49:59] a public Revelation it's not a thing we
[50:02] come to show
[50:04] here is is a a a
[50:08] relationship that is in
[50:11] private you know God he knows
[50:14] you regardless what people
[50:17] sayless what
[50:19] people you know your
[50:22] God you may not know all the book of
[50:26] brother
[50:29] Bram one one guy told Brother
[50:32] Bram he say you know you don't know your
[50:36] Bible and brother say yes you are right
[50:40] I don't know my Bible but I know
[50:44] the but I know
[50:46] the I know him that's the main point
[50:51] your pastor can say that you are evil
[50:54] but you know him
[50:56] that's the main
[51:00] point we need to have a
[51:02] purpose for us to
[51:05] conquer because if you have a faith it's
[51:09] for you to go to
[51:10] conquer there is a law of B you don't
[51:14] have faith to relax and se you need
[51:18] to because it's your
[51:21] promise God give to Israel a promise he
[51:25] said I'm going to give you a land and
[51:28] that time he was in
[51:31] slavery and he has just a a a
[51:35] imagination of
[51:37] land that God promised to them that you
[51:41] going to have a
[51:43] land and the land he described that land
[51:47] to
[51:48] them many of many of them they born in
[51:53] Egypt and they don't know anything
[51:57] they keep repeating to them we have a
[52:00] land and they make
[52:03] bricks they work for
[52:05] Egyptian but they repeat one
[52:08] another oh my brother be strong we have
[52:12] a
[52:13] land strong we have a land we have a
[52:16] land brother it's not a problem we have
[52:19] a land and they keep working like the
[52:23] boy today working the Temptation the
[52:28] trouble be and all things but remember
[52:32] we have a
[52:34] promise we need to
[52:39] conquer and one
[52:42] day they saw the
[52:46] land because when God says
[52:49] something is more than
[52:51] truth before God speak the word already
[52:55] made it he already do it if he said that
[53:00] by my trip you shall be
[53:03] healed provide the healing
[53:08] power if you have
[53:11] tonight your healing is tonight if you
[53:14] have faith you get Faith tomorrow your
[53:17] healing is
[53:19] tomorrow fin all the
[53:23] work is up to you you need to stand as a
[53:28] conqueror you need to conquer he G to
[53:32] Abraham a promise you going to have a
[53:35] son and Abram has to fight 25 years he
[53:40] need to conquer every
[53:45] doubt for you to
[53:47] overcome and the God is telling us that
[53:51] your faith is your victory
[53:55] and we see let me go a little bit
[53:59] deeper even in the message my brother my
[54:04] sister the enemy is working to remove
[54:08] faith in The
[54:11] Believer if you see somebody telling
[54:14] you oh you
[54:16] know was a
[54:19] man what you
[54:23] mean we know that
[54:25] God sent a message God sent a prophet if
[54:29] you go to Egypt and tell to the people
[54:33] mes is just
[54:35] a you will not reach the
[54:38] country because he is Joshua when he
[54:42] come God told him I don't give you
[54:45] another message you need to take what
[54:48] Moses said if you want to be
[54:53] successful now when you come to me said
[54:57] you know Bram is a
[54:59] man you want to give me a
[55:02] job that brother bil Paul told me long
[55:06] time
[55:08] ago we were in Canada and he told me
[55:13] there is a guy who told me that God give
[55:16] him give him a job to correct the
[55:21] prophet and uh he
[55:23] stopped I asked him
[55:25] who's that guy he said I told him that
[55:28] he's a good good job I like that
[55:33] job and I was looking to him he said why
[55:37] he said because you will not have
[55:39] anything to
[55:42] do to correct the prophet you would not
[55:45] have
[55:46] it because the prophet is the mouth of
[55:50] God if you tell me that the prophet is
[55:53] the man you want to give me a job for me
[55:57] to go to the message to look the man and
[56:02] to look what
[56:04] go I don't have that
[56:07] intell I take his
[56:09] mistake and God is
[56:12] responsible I don't have the ability me
[56:16] to go the message what
[56:18] is no he not me I saw a guy who told me
[56:23] oh you need you see him he didn't say
[56:26] that's is the
[56:27] Lord that's the husband of
[56:32] [Music]
[56:38] me's husband but to me I take
[56:45] everything that's my message I defend it
[56:50] with all I got
[56:53] me I have a Sunday
[56:56] school that I teach those i t I give a
[57:01] ttle the blind
[57:04] [Music]
[57:10] spot because there is a lot of blind
[57:13] spot in the message that make that
[57:16] people bring doubt in the
[57:22] message is the blind SP to us but not to
[57:25] the
[57:28] message and they told
[57:30] me 1977 is not
[57:36] happen I don't prophesize I
[57:40] predict I don't care what he say but as
[57:43] long is in the message for me is
[57:48] true you want to see God with your five
[57:53] senses no no when God Cur the F
[58:00] [Music]
[58:02] tree that the disciple looked to the
[58:06] tree nothing
[58:08] happened but at the
[58:11] moment the power of curse was on the
[58:15] tree you cannot see with your
[58:20] eyes your it
[58:23] happened
[58:26] and go brother said God never give you
[58:29] five senses to deal with
[58:33] him no you cannot understand god with
[58:37] your
[58:40] five you need God
[58:43] help that you can understand because the
[58:47] Bible says tells us about
[58:50] Abraham that he took everything that God
[58:54] didn't say that it doesn't
[58:58] [Music]
[59:04] exist but what God has said in this
[59:09] hour I us to say to
[59:12] people I'm in the position of
[59:15] P because when you come to tell me this
[59:18] is wrong I turn just around and ask you
[59:22] to whom shall me go
[59:26] show me another message show me where I
[59:29] can go if I can doubt this
[59:32] message I'm asking myself where can I
[59:36] go because before I come to this message
[59:40] I
[59:41] Catholic I was about to come a
[59:44] priest I went to the
[59:47] seminar and I was so
[59:50] faithful till I saw the priest they told
[59:53] me that they don't have God they have
[59:55] their system I have to obey to their
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:00] system and I left I went to Pentecost
[1:00:05] Baptist
[1:00:07] Church and it could not satisfy me I
[1:00:11] went to Pentecost Church it could not
[1:00:15] satisfy church now I get this
[1:00:18] message and you come to tell me I don't
[1:00:22] know where you're going to send me again
[1:00:24] go back where I come
[1:00:27] from you come just so
[1:00:31] late brother says when you come to him
[1:00:36] when you come to God don't come as a
[1:00:41] floter you will go up and try it and see
[1:00:46] if it
[1:00:48] work there is a lot of people they come
[1:00:51] to the
[1:00:52] message they come like floter
[1:00:56] that's why you see many
[1:00:58] doctr that's why you see preacher they
[1:01:00] want to go higher they become higher
[1:01:04] than the
[1:01:05] prophet they become they they they want
[1:01:09] just to uh
[1:01:13] uh amazing people impress impress people
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:19] very there is a time for that there is a
[1:01:24] time
[1:01:25] you know that we get to the
[1:01:27] end there is no more time to impress
[1:01:30] people you need to meet him
[1:01:35] yourself and you will not get to the
[1:01:37] back
[1:01:39] there you read the uh uh the preaching
[1:01:43] to come to impress the
[1:01:47] church I come to help myself and help my
[1:01:51] brother because has to set in as our
[1:01:56] Victory we we don't have to come like
[1:01:59] the
[1:02:01] FL why come
[1:02:06] here we think that life is just good
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:13] fellowship or just having a good job or
[1:02:17] get help by the
[1:02:20] ministers get applauded by people they
[1:02:24] can say that this is a good Christian
[1:02:27] this is
[1:02:29] boy all this one will
[1:02:32] stand but I tell you when you come to
[1:02:36] God you need to have a
[1:02:38] purpose your purpose is to live with him
[1:02:43] forever to meet him
[1:02:46] anywhere that's why when bam get to the
[1:02:50] end he said that even though they cut my
[1:02:53] flesh in peace
[1:02:55] even though they burn my flesh or they
[1:02:58] put me in the war when he show up I will
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:04] see that's the purpose of true
[1:03:08] Christian having that in mind he fight
[1:03:12] against every
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:15] sin he knows that he's in love of
[1:03:21] God brother says
[1:03:25] I can go
[1:03:26] out even get another uh wife my wife can
[1:03:31] forgive
[1:03:34] me I know she can but I love her de that
[1:03:38] I cannot do
[1:03:41] it but if you love
[1:03:44] God if your purpose is
[1:03:48] God I think that you will overcome all
[1:03:51] the Temptation that come
[1:03:55] it's going to be easy for you to
[1:03:57] overcome brother
[1:04:02] says did I not tell
[1:04:06] you let
[1:04:09] me I will skip this see uh he may not
[1:04:15] hard to deal with the same
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:21] FL you said
[1:04:25] when he wrote that he did he did not
[1:04:29] have my
[1:04:33] troubles he did not have to deal with
[1:04:36] the folk that I deal
[1:04:41] with he did not have to go through the
[1:04:45] things that I go
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:48] through you may not have to deal with
[1:04:52] the same Folk
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:56] he may uh he may not had the to overcome
[1:05:01] the same
[1:05:05] thing but he never exclude
[1:05:09] them all the things we are going through
[1:05:13] he never exclude them so he
[1:05:17] said
[1:05:18] this the faith is the
[1:05:22] victory that all
[1:05:25] the
[1:05:27] world what you going to
[1:05:30] overcome the
[1:05:32] world the world is all the
[1:05:36] systems you need to overcome
