[21:14] in the book of Ephesians
[21:17] &gt;&gt; chapter 6
[21:20] from verse 11
[21:24] verse 16.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 6
[21:35] verse 11.
[21:42] The Bible says,
[21:44] "Put on the whole arm of God that you
[21:48] may be able to stand against the devil."
[22:00] &gt;&gt; For we wrestle not against flesh and
[22:02] blood, but against principalities,
[22:05] against power, Against the rulers of
[22:08] darkness of this world, against
[22:10] spiritual spiritual wickedness in high
[22:13] places.
[22:27] Wherefore take up unto you the whole arm
[22:30] of God that you may be able to stand
[22:32] with stand the evil day and having done
[22:35] all to stand.
[22:47] Stand therefore, having your loins
[22:49] girded about with the truth, and having
[22:51] on the breastplate of righteousness,
[23:02] and your feet showed with the
[23:03] preparation of the gospel of peace,
[23:11] above all, taking the shield of faith
[23:13] where wherewith ye shall be able to
[23:16] quench all the fear fury dots of the
[23:18] wicked
[23:26] and take the emit of salvation and the
[23:29] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[23:32] God
[23:37] praying always with all prayer and
[23:40] supplication in spirit spirit and

[23:44] perseverance and supplication for all
[23:47] saints.

[24:07] or we can just read in the book of Psalm
[24:10] to save some time. Uh
[24:14] 91
[24:19] Psalm 91
[24:23] He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[24:25] the most high shall abide under the
[24:27] shadow of the almighty.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge
[24:37] and my fortress, my God in him will I
[24:40] trust.
[24:48] Surely it shall deliver thee from the
[24:50] snare of the fall and from the knowome
[24:54] pestilence.
[25:05] And under his wings shall thy trust. His
[25:09] truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
[25:20] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[25:22] by night, nor for the arrow that fly fly
[25:26] by day.
[25:34] Nor for the pestilent that walketh in
[25:36] the darkness, nor for the destruction
[25:39] that wasted at noon day.
[25:47] A thousand shall fall fall at thy side,
[25:50] and 10,000 at thy right hands, but it
[25:53] shall not come near thee.
[26:01] Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold and
[26:04] see the reward of the wicked.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Because thou has made the Lord which is
[26:14] my refuge, even the most high thy
[26:17] habitation.
[26:25] There shall no evil befall thee, neither
[26:28] shall any plague come n thy dwelling.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; For he shall give his angel charge over
[26:39] thee to keep thee in all thy ways.

[26:49] thash thy foot against a stone.
[26:59] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and other
[27:02] the young lion and the dragon shall thou
[27:05] trample under the feet.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Because he has set his love upon me,
[27:14] therefore will I deliver him. I will set
[27:17] him on high because he has known my
[27:20] name.
[27:28] He shall call upon me and I will answer
[27:30] him. I will be with him in trouble. I

[34:01] blood.
[34:04] Your husband is not your enemy.
[34:07] Your brother is not your enemy.
[34:11] We wrestle against not against flesh and
[34:14] blood.
[34:16] Knowing your enemy.
[34:18] Identify your enemy is the first thing
[34:21] to do in a battle.
[34:24] Remember we are in the battle.
[34:27] Who is then your enemy?
[34:30] If you miss to identify your enemy,
[34:33] you will you will waste your strength
[34:37] even fight your ally.
[34:41] So you have to identify your enemy.
[34:44] You have to know who is the enemy. The
[34:47] Bible say we are not wrestling against
[34:49] not against flesh and blood
[34:52] but against principalities
[34:55] against powers,
[34:57] against the rulers of the darkness of
[34:59] this world,
[35:02] against spiritual wickedness
[35:06] in high places.
[35:08] We are sown therefore in the battles.
[35:11] We are soldiers.
[35:13] The prophet say we are not in the
[35:15] picnics.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; We are in a battleground.
[35:19] We are not in a vacation.
[35:22] We are in a battleground. The prophecy
[35:24] in the message
[35:26] Satan Eden
[35:30] paragraph 13. I wanted to speak to you
[35:33] something
[35:35] to bring something to enlighten to you
[35:37] the promise of God.
[35:42] See something not something that
[35:43] somebody else was in some other day.
[35:48] Them things are all all right.
[35:52] Them things are all right.
[35:55] We are referred to those things.
[35:59] But I thought I will try to bring
[36:01] something to your mind
[36:05] with these scriptures
[36:07] I got written here
[36:09] that I would enlighten you
[36:14] to know to make you a better soldier
[36:19] to make you a better soldier in the
[36:21] field
[36:24] that you are fighting now.
[36:28] make you a better soldier
[36:31] in the battle that you are fighting now
[36:34] to to learn the tactics of the enemy
[36:39] so that you can block everything
[36:43] before it gets to you.
[36:46] That's the main thing is to learn to
[36:49] keep the punches off of you
[36:54] as much as you can.
[36:57] The prophet used to be a boxer.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; So he's telling us the defense
[37:03] techniques
[37:05] to win the battle.
[37:08] To win a battle fight, you have to keep
[37:11] the punches off of you.
[37:16] As much as you can,
[37:19] the more punches you get,
[37:21] the weaker you get, the weaker you
[37:24] become.
[37:25] So the best way to win the battle
[37:30] is to keep the bunches off of you
[37:34] to dodge them as much as you can.
[37:38] So the best defense
[37:41] is to attack. The best defense is to
[37:45] attack. Don't wait to be attacked.
[37:49] Don't wait to be attacked.
[37:51] Don't let the enemy attack you because
[37:54] the more punches you get, the weaker you
[37:57] become. In 67
[38:01] and Israel war,
[38:04] they did not wait for Arab country to
[38:06] attack them,
[38:09] but they attacked first because they
[38:11] were greater in numbers. So, Israel knew
[38:16] the best defense
[38:18] was to attack. Don't wait to be
[38:21] attacked.
[38:22] Attack first. That's why tonight we are
[38:26] going to attack first. We are soldiers.
[38:30] We are warriors.
[38:33] People runs.
[38:35] People run at the first attack.
[38:39] You know civilians run at the first
[38:40] attack.
[38:42] But the problem in the message today,
[38:46] people are so weak. People are now
[38:48] soldiers.
[38:50] The problem in the church today, we are
[38:52] not soldiers. That God doesn't want any
[38:55] cowards.
[38:56] God is looking for soldiers.
[38:59] People that cannot run at the first
[39:01] attack,
[39:02] at the first punches.
[39:05] You know in South Africa, there was a
[39:07] great man called Zulu.
[39:10] Shakazulu. Shakazulu. Some of you know
[39:12] him. Shakazulu was a leader of the
[39:15] tribe.
[39:17] He did not want soldiers.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; He did not want soldiers.
[39:23] He did not want soldiers.
[39:29] He did not want soldiers that had wound
[39:32] in the back
[39:35] because that meant
[39:38] you that meant
[39:40] you were running away.
[39:42] That meant you were running away. That's
[39:45] why you got hurt in the back. So he was
[39:48] looking for soldiers that had wound in
[39:51] the front.
[39:53] People soldiers that could stay face to
[39:56] face with the devil that could stand
[39:58] face to face with the enemy that could
[40:01] fight. Not people that hand wounded the
[40:04] back.
[40:05] People that turn the back and run away.
[40:09] People that been in the message but they
[40:11] turn the back and run away. If we the
[40:15] prophet said the Bible says the Bible
[40:17] says Jesus said
[40:20] anyone who put his hand in the plane
[40:26] his back
[40:28] is not fit to be in the kingdom.
[40:32] If you turn your back
[40:34] if you been in the kingdom if you been
[40:37] in the message you turn your back.
[40:42] If you've been in the message and you
[40:45] turn your back, you're not fit to be in
[40:48] the kingdom.
[40:49] God is looking for soldiers
[40:52] that stand toe to toe with the devil.
[40:55] When the devil say boo, you say boo.
[40:59] When they say the devil say boo, you to
[41:02] say boo. Now you turn your back and run.
[41:07] God is looking for soldiers
[41:09] that wound in the front.
[41:13] Amen. Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; We are in the battles.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; We need to know where the battle
[41:19] started.
[41:21] As a matter of fact,
[41:24] the battles did not start on the earth.
[41:27] The battle start up there in heaven.
[41:31] In fact, the battle is not between you
[41:33] and Satan.
[41:36] The battle is not between you and Satan.
[41:39] The battle is between God and Satan.
[41:43] So it just happens.
[41:46] Many of us identify with God.
[41:50] So the enemy of God become our enemy.
[41:54] But the battle is between you and Satan.
[41:57] The battle is the Lord's battle.
[42:01] It's the Lord's battle. Amen. Amen. The
[42:04] prophet says in the message, "The
[42:06] greatest battle ever fought
[42:10] 62.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; This great
[42:13] the first battle that ever fought
[42:16] &gt;&gt; begin in heaven
[42:18] when Michael and his angels
[42:21] fought against Lucifer
[42:24] and his angels. It first started.
[42:28] The first battle was in heaven.
[42:31] So sin did not originate on the earth.
[42:35] It originated in heaven.
[42:38] and it fell on human being.
[42:41] The battle started in in heaven
[42:44] and fell on the human being. Then the
[42:47] battle
[42:49] from angels
[42:51] from angels
[42:53] become human battles.
[42:58] The battle that was angels battle
[43:01] became human battles.
[43:04] Satan come to destroy God's creation.
[43:08] What God has created to be here is
[43:10] suffer.
[43:12] He had Satan come to destroy this. That
[43:16] what his purpose? He was to destroy it.
[43:20] The battle begin here on the earth.
[43:23] Amen. Now we can see why angel's battle,
[43:27] what was angel's battle became human
[43:30] battles.
[43:32] I believe God was victorious there.
[43:35] If God was victorious there,
[43:38] he will still be victorious here because
[43:41] he never lost a battle. If he was
[43:44] victorious there, the Bible says Michael
[43:50] and his angel was victorious over there.
[43:53] The angels, the stars
[43:57] that identified themselves with Michael,
[44:00] they were victorious there.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same angels here on the
[44:05] earth that identify themselves with the
[44:08] great Michael will also be victorious
[44:12] here on the earth.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Therefore, there are two powers. There
[44:17] are two powers on the earth. There are
[44:19] two powers on the earth. Two powers that
[44:22] confronting confronting each other that
[44:25] are controlling the earth.
[44:28] It's either you are control but God's
[44:31] power
[44:33] or the devil power. The prophet says in
[44:35] the message
[44:37] Jarius raising Jerus
[44:42] paragraph 13.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Now let's get that in our mind
[44:47] and remember that is ever present.
[44:51] There's no other creature that could be
[44:54] omnipresent except God himself.
[44:57] No other creature.
[44:59] The devil is a great force.
[45:03] There are some people especially
[45:06] Christian we think the devil is not a
[45:09] force.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet says the devil is a great
[45:13] force.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; The devil is a great power
[45:20] and the devil is a great great in his
[45:23] power.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; But he's under the power of God.
[45:30] The devil can only be in one place
[45:34] at a time. His limbs can be everywhere.
[45:40] His imps
[45:44] can be everywhere scattered out. His
[45:47] demons, his coworkers,
[45:50] but God himself is alone in his this
[45:54] field of omnipresence.
[45:57] In this field of omnipresence,
[46:00] God is alone.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the prophet says
[46:04] omnipresence of God
[46:06] &gt;&gt; means omnisient. God is omnipresent
[46:10] because he knows everything. He knows
[46:12] the end before the beginning. The devil
[46:15] does not know the end. God knows the end
[46:19] before the beginning. That's what makes
[46:21] him unimpress.
[46:23] Hallelujah. Not an angel. Not the angel
[46:27] but God himself. Hallelujah. That gives
[46:30] us the courage. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[46:33] Demon exist.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; They are real.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; You can if you cannot believe God. If
[46:40] you don't want to believe the devil. If
[46:42] you believe God that means there must be
[46:45] a demon somewhere.
[46:48] Demons are real. Witchcraft exist.
[46:52] Is and the prophet is a great force.
[46:55] Magicians,
[46:57] the magic exist, they cause accidents.
[47:02] They cause troubles.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; They bring trouble.
[47:06] They attack with diseases.
[47:08] They create fasting among the people.
[47:11] They bring confusion. They bring wars
[47:14] among the people. The prophet says the
[47:17] devil will come and create confusion and
[47:20] will stand back and watch you fighting.
[47:23] They bring confusion.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; They bring trouble. Demons are real.
[47:29] They attack families. They attack
[47:31] churches. They attack ministers with
[47:35] women,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; with popularity, with witchcraft. One
[47:40] day the prophet stood there. I think it
[47:42] was in Germany. He was preaching and
[47:45] there was sources in the in the church.
[47:48] They started doing enchantments.
[47:51] And the prophet says, They wanted to
[47:54] make me bark like a dog.
[47:59] They were not scared of the de the
[48:01] prophets. They wanted to make him bark
[48:04] like a dog.
[48:06] So demons are real. They're controlling
[48:09] people attack people. Hallelujah. You
[48:12] better make sure you have God. You have
[48:16] Sabath on your side because he's the one
[48:19] who can fight for you.
[48:23] They attack
[48:25] &gt;&gt; they attack ministers ministers.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; If they cannot get you with women, if
[48:29] they cannot get you with witchcraft,
[48:32] they will get you. They will get your
[48:33] children. They will attack your
[48:35] children. They will attack your wife.
[48:38] They will attack your ministry. They
[48:40] want to destroy you. They want to finish
[48:42] you. So therefore, we are not in the
[48:44] picnic.
[48:46] Satan is real.
[48:48] The prophet says to overcome,
[48:51] you know, the enemy
[48:53] tactics.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; You cannot overcome if you undermine, if
[48:58] you underestimate
[49:00] your enemy.
[49:04] And the prophet says the devil can come
[49:07] and take your life prematurely.
[49:10] They can try to take your life
[49:12] prematurely.
[49:14] But the prophet also says when the devil
[49:17] can come, can the devil try to come and
[49:20] take your life prematurely? The angel of
[49:23] the Lord
[49:26] stand between you and death. He stand
[49:29] between you and sickness when the enemy
[49:33] can come when he's trying to come to
[49:36] take away your life prematurely.
[49:39] That means there are people that die
[49:42] prematurely before the time. But when
[49:46] you have seis,
[49:48] he stand between you and the danger. He
[49:51] stand between you and that sickness. He
[49:55] between stand between you and cancer.
[49:58] That's what the prophet says. You will
[50:00] not die before your time.
[50:02] You will not die before the time that
[50:05] God has allowed it to you. You will
[50:07] leave to fulfill the purpose of God.
[50:12] They attack when you sleep.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; They attack when you driving.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; They will attack your children.
[50:21] They will attack your job. The prophet
[50:23] says the job is to attack. To attack to
[50:25] attack.
[50:28] They bring all kind of problem. They
[50:31] attack your finance. They attack you.
[50:33] They will attack your job.
[50:35] They will weaken your prayer life.
[50:38] Every time you try to pray, you cannot
[50:41] pray for one minute. You cannot pray for
[50:43] two minutes. They want to weaken your
[50:46] prayer life. That's the power of the
[50:48] devil.
[50:50] So therefore, don't get distracted.
[50:53] They cause accidents. The prophet was
[50:56] talking about a a a man, an old man.
[51:00] Uh he was hit by a car,
[51:04] by a woman. And then uh everybody that
[51:07] was around,
[51:09] they saw a man that was projected
[51:13] and fell down. And the woman got out of
[51:16] the car.
[51:18] She wanted to see the old man, but she
[51:22] could not see. And the witness,
[51:25] everybody around could testify. They saw
[51:29] a old man with a coat, but they could
[51:32] not see him no more. They called the
[51:34] police. They started to search the area,
[51:37] but they could not see no one.
[51:41] They cause accidents.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Demons cause accidents. You don't know
[51:47] what's going on on the street. You don't
[51:49] know what's going on out there. They
[51:51] bring accidents.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; They cause problem.
[51:55] Demons exist. So we are therefore in a
[51:58] battle. That's why before you get in the
[52:00] car, before you drive your car,
[52:04] because you don't know what is going on
[52:05] out there, you don't know what spirits
[52:08] are out there. Demons are real. I just
[52:11] want you to wake you up to know that
[52:15] demons are real.
[52:18] So therefore, if demons are real, our
[52:21] Jehovah Sabath is also real.
[52:24] Amen. He fights our battles. The battle
[52:27] that we cannot see,
[52:29] the invisible battles that we cannot
[52:31] see. The Bible says when the enemy shall
[52:34] come like a flood,
[52:37] the spirit of the Lord shall raise the
[52:40] standard. Hallelujah. When the enemy
[52:42] shall come, when the enemy will attack
[52:45] you, the spirit of the Lord, the Lord of
[52:48] hosts shall raise the standard. He will
[52:52] not touch you.
[52:54] Amen. Amen.
[52:57] The omnipresent God, he knows the danger
[53:00] before he comes to you. There's a wall
[53:02] of fire around you.
[53:05] The Bible says the witchcraft, the
[53:08] enentment will not touch Jacob.
[53:13] The witchcraft, the enchantment will not
[53:16] touch Jacob. Hallelujah. Because Jacob
[53:20] is the bless of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Satan has a power.
[53:25] But my God is most powerful
[53:28] &gt;&gt; in the message,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; the contest.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 11,
[53:35] &gt;&gt; the prophet says, "We know that he has
[53:38] the most power.
[53:41] We know who has the most power."
[53:44] God does.
[53:46] God. And when he gave his people the
[53:50] best,
[53:52] the best thing that he could could to
[53:54] combat with
[53:57] was with with his word. Now because the
[54:00] word is God and who is stronger than
[54:03] God.
[54:04] Who is God? The word is God. And the
[54:08] word becomes our strength.
[54:11] God in the church become his strength.
[54:15] God in the church is our strength to
[54:19] pull Satan in his his own fire
[54:23] that he has made. The devil has made a
[54:27] fire
[54:28] to bring you in the fire but in you
[54:33] is your strength to pull the devil in
[54:37] his own fire. The fire he has made.
[54:41] Hallelujah. They have made a fire. They
[54:44] have plot against you. They have plain
[54:48] against you. But God is in you become
[54:52] your strength. Hallelujah. To pull you
[54:56] to pull the devil in their own fire.
[54:59] Esther
[55:02] pull amen in his own fire. Hallelujah.
[55:07] Hallelujah. the power of God in you will
[55:10] pull the devil in his own fire.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; That's why every weapon,
[55:19] every plane, every plot that is formed
[55:23] against you shall not prosper.
[55:26] Every plane the gallow that put there to
[55:30] hang you
[55:32] will not prosper. Hallelujah. They will
[55:34] be hanged there.
[55:38] will be it will backfire on them.
[55:41] Hallelujah. It will backfire on them.
[55:45] Hallelujah. There was a brother.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; There was a brother. I heard a story
[55:49] somewhere.
[55:51] There was a brother. He bought a new
[55:53] house.
[55:54] And in that house, he later found out
[55:57] that they were saying he was hunted.
[56:04] Auntie,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; they said it was hunted. And every time
[56:08] they were sleep, they had a room there
[56:11] upstairs.
[56:13] And the man, the brother would hear
[56:15] somebody walking
[56:17] and they could not sleep. They were
[56:19] scared,
[56:21] but they could they just heard every
[56:22] night somebody walking.
[56:25] The prophet says the devil loved the
[56:28] darkness.
[56:30] He love to attack in the dark because
[56:32] you don't see him coming
[56:35] when you sleep. Sometime you don't see
[56:37] him coming. So you will come and start
[56:40] walking in the water.
[56:42] But that brother he said enough is
[56:44] enough.
[56:46] That day he took the message books.
[56:50] He laid on the floor
[56:53] and he started playing the tape in that
[56:56] room.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; And he says that day
[57:00] They never heard the noise and the kids
[57:03] slept in peace.
[57:05] That's why in your room, that's why in
[57:08] your house, play the tape. Keep the good
[57:11] atmosphere.
[57:13] The devil will not attack you. They will
[57:15] not come near you.
[57:18] And when they come, they will find
[57:19] Jehovah.
[57:21] Hallelujah.
[57:23] Sleep in peace.
[57:25] Jehovah Sabel
[57:27] stands for you.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Now I know the old saying of that people
[57:36] of 12.
[57:39] People don't believe in in demons in
[57:42] this day.
[57:44] are the things to do to my opinion is to
[57:48] know your enemy
[57:50] and know your enemy and train for the
[57:53] count
[57:55] that you are going to have to meet him
[57:58] because you are going to meet him.
[58:02] What is strength?
[58:04] The strength for the countries this and
[58:07] this in this war we have battles.
[58:10] There are battles that collectives.
[58:13] There are battles that is collective.
[58:16] There are battles for the family. The
[58:19] devil can attack the family. This can be
[58:21] a collective battles.
[58:24] But there are battles also very
[58:25] individual.
[58:27] There are battles in the church. The
[58:29] devil can come and fight the church and
[58:31] attack the church. But there are also
[58:33] battle that are individual. Those are
[58:36] the battle difficult battle because they
[58:39] are silent battle.
[58:43] The silent battle they are the very
[58:45] difficult battles. You know when the
[58:47] battles are public,
[58:50] everybody can comfort you. Everybody can
[58:53] come and comfort you. But when the
[58:55] battles are silent,
[58:58] those are battles. It's not like you
[58:59] don't want to tell the battles, but you
[59:01] just can't find words.
[59:04] Explain the battles. So you going you
[59:06] can't just find words
[59:09] understand it except yourself
[59:13] you just don't have words. It's not just
[59:15] you keeping secrets.
[59:19] You can't find words
[59:24] difficult.
[59:26] Silent battle are very difficult.
[59:30] You know that I will talk about the
[59:33] battle of sister Eddie Ed.
[59:37] We all know sister writes a great
[59:40] testimony that
[59:43] we miss to understand to know the battle
[59:46] that she was going through.
[59:49] We know sister Ed in a good way
[59:53] said the right thing.
[59:55] This is nothing but the truth.
[59:58] What sister was going through
[1:00:02] everybody knew it. Let's read what the
[1:00:04] prophet is saying.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Ministry
[1:00:13] 167
[1:00:16] sister Eddie Moier
[1:00:21] that was the her name.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; She just lost her husband.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; That's the first part.
[1:00:30] I married the couple some years ago.
[1:00:34] They got two fine children
[1:00:37] and brother Watt was killed in his own
[1:00:40] was killed. His own boy found him under
[1:00:44] the tractor.
[1:00:46] So this sister
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; was married and her husband was killed
[1:00:51] under the tractor
[1:00:54] mashed crashed to death
[1:01:00] and the little boy at the break.
[1:01:04] And something happened to him. Brother
[1:01:07] Hun and I went down one night and stay
[1:01:09] in the day into the night. And another
[1:01:12] message I believe the prophet says first
[1:01:15] of all she lost her husband
[1:01:18] a great battle. And what kind of death?
[1:01:22] The husband was trashed and smashed.
[1:01:29] And then the only believe the prophet
[1:01:30] says, "And you talk about renegot.
[1:01:35] They were just giving a headache all the
[1:01:37] time.
[1:01:39] Poor little widow mother."
[1:01:42] And so a husband, I marry she to her
[1:01:46] husband.
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:49] Her husband has gotten killed on the
[1:01:51] mar.
[1:01:53] So her husband was killed and she had
[1:01:56] two kids and the two kid was renegot
[1:02:04] renegot
[1:02:07] real thugs.
[1:02:10] But look the trouble that she was going
[1:02:12] through. The battle that she was going
[1:02:14] through. She had all the reason to be
[1:02:17] bitter.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; She had all the reason to be bitter.
[1:02:23] But yet in that condition,
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; one day when they were building the
[1:02:27] sanctuary
[1:02:29] being poor, she did not have the money.
[1:02:33] She lost her husband in a very difficult
[1:02:36] condition.
[1:02:37] Her children was out there in the world.
[1:02:40] on that condition. She did not have
[1:02:43] money. When they were building the
[1:02:45] church, she brought the offering to
[1:02:47] brother Bren.
[1:02:50] She was not bitter. And the prophet when
[1:02:52] the prophet look at the money, when the
[1:02:54] prophet look at the money, he said, I
[1:02:56] cannot take it. But the Lord told him,
[1:02:59] take that money, you are hindering your
[1:03:01] blessing.
[1:03:04] You see the battle that she was going
[1:03:05] through.
[1:03:07] But she was not bitter.
[1:03:09] But in that the prophet says in that
[1:03:11] battle you remain faithful
[1:03:15] in your private battle
[1:03:19] faithful
[1:03:20] the battle that you cannot
[1:03:23] remain faith
[1:03:26] don't be bitter
[1:03:28] don't be bitter remain faithful
[1:03:31] hallelujah your victories welcome
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; she Stay there quiet.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[1:03:43] "Nothing is going to bother you.
[1:03:46] Nothing is going to bother you.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Don't be scared to take God at his word.
[1:03:53] Just relax
[1:03:55] and hear his voice. Just relax. When
[1:03:58] you're going through a battle,
[1:04:01] silence battle
[1:04:03] that you cannot explain it. That's why
[1:04:06] brothers and sisters when you see
[1:04:09] somebody just don't be quick to judge.
[1:04:12] Somebody can be there sad
[1:04:16] the countenance you don't understand
[1:04:19] quick to judge. You don't the person is
[1:04:22] going through. You don't know the battle
[1:04:25] is going through because the silence
[1:04:28] battles
[1:04:30] are difficult.
[1:04:33] But in that battles, the prophet said
[1:04:35] just relax and have faith and believe.
[1:04:40] He's watching over you.
[1:04:44] He will disintegrate anything that tries
[1:04:47] to bother you.
[1:04:51] Anything that might attack you,
[1:04:54] he will disintegrate it.
[1:04:59] But he can't harm you. They might attack
[1:05:01] you here. They might attack you, but
[1:05:04] they can't harm you for all things
[1:05:08] you permit it.
[1:05:10] It couldn't be nothing else.
[1:05:13] For it's working together for your good
[1:05:17] to them that love God, no arm can come
[1:05:20] to you.
[1:05:22] God is going letting you go through the
[1:05:24] battles that you have through. Today we
[1:05:28] are talking about sister Eye
[1:05:31] and because of her battles because of
[1:05:34] her silence battles. Hallelujah. The
[1:05:37] first time the third bull came to the
[1:05:41] human being
[1:05:43] was to that woman.
[1:05:46] The third
[1:05:48] greatest of all the ministry.
[1:05:51] The greatest of all the ministry. The
[1:05:53] first time he came to a human being was
[1:05:57] to a woman that was going through a
[1:06:00] silent battle.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Friend, do you realize what it was? I
[1:06:07] never in my life ever felt such
[1:06:10] anointing.
[1:06:13] The first time he was ever performed on
[1:06:17] a human being
[1:06:20] the or
[1:06:24] He bypassed the aris aristocrat.
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:30] He bypassed everything else. He went to
[1:06:33] that poor woman widow woman living up on
[1:06:37] the hill.
[1:06:39] No know the word you will ask.
[1:06:43] A two boy was gloriously saved at that
[1:06:47] very moment.
[1:06:50] Hallelujah. in your battle. Just relax.
[1:06:54] Just relax. Trust God.
[1:06:58] Deadpool will come to you. Hallelujah.
[1:07:01] Just trust God. God will trust you.
[1:07:06] If you trust God, God will trust you
[1:07:09] with victories.
[1:07:12] And
[1:07:13] Anna was also going through silent
[1:07:15] battle.
[1:07:17] But nobody could understand.
[1:07:19] If you read the Bible, the Bible says
[1:07:22] Anna went to the temple before that her
[1:07:25] husband came the husband asked her am I
[1:07:29] not worth 10 10 children for you?
[1:07:34] Men sometime we don't understand
[1:07:37] we try to place ourel we compare we
[1:07:39] think like we can replace the kids
[1:07:42] these are different kind of love
[1:07:45] husband could not understand
[1:07:48] she went to church she started praying
[1:07:52] she started praying and the word the
[1:07:54] bible says the word were not coming out
[1:07:57] you know when you go through the battle
[1:07:59] silent battle you reach to a point
[1:08:03] where words can come.
[1:08:05] You just grown.
[1:08:08] Tears coming down.
[1:08:10] You just grown
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; in that moment. Problem overwhelms you.
[1:08:19] The problem overwhelms you.
[1:08:26] When problem overwhelms you,
[1:08:29] there's no words to explain it.
[1:08:33] The lips just move,
[1:08:35] but the words don't come out. The words
[1:08:38] don't come out. If it happens that words
[1:08:41] comes out,
[1:08:42] they don't mean anything.
[1:08:45] They're meaningless
[1:08:46] because you are in pain.
[1:08:49] You are in pain in yourself.
[1:08:51] That's a battles. The Bible says provoke
[1:08:55] her day and night.
[1:08:57] The enemy were attacking her day and
[1:08:59] night. Anna decided to go to the temple
[1:09:03] she was praying the word were not coming
[1:09:05] out to the point the pastor came even
[1:09:08] the understand
[1:09:14] that's what the prophet says you know
[1:09:16] it's it's not also good to talk too much
[1:09:20] when you're going through battle it's
[1:09:21] not good to talk
[1:09:24] when the prophet was explaining about
[1:09:25] the seven sephet he was saying the
[1:09:27] reason of the seven seal, the seven
[1:09:30] seal. He said the reason why God kept it
[1:09:34] secret
[1:09:36] because God did not want the devil to
[1:09:39] mess up his plan. He messed up his plan.
[1:09:42] The prophet says when I'm about to do
[1:09:44] something, if I said I will do this, I
[1:09:47] will do this. The devil will go ahead
[1:09:50] and wreck my plan. He said, "But when I
[1:09:54] keep in my heart, but when you pray in
[1:09:56] your heart and words is not coming out,
[1:09:59] you just murmur, you just grow."
[1:10:03] Hallelujah. The prophet says, "God seal
[1:10:05] you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:09] God seal your prayer with the Holy
[1:10:11] Ghost. The devil cannot understand. The
[1:10:14] devil cannot understand because the
[1:10:16] devil does not know everything.
[1:10:19] It's seal inside of you.
[1:10:23] That's why I don't talk too much. Yeah.
[1:10:25] Amen. Amen. By the Lord of hosts.
[1:10:28] Anna says in the book of 1 Samuel,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter one,
[1:10:40] the Bible says, let's go to verse 10.
[1:10:44] He said she was in the bitterness of her
[1:10:45] soul and pray unto God the Lord and wept
[1:10:49] sore and she vowed a vow
[1:10:56] and said, "Oh Lord of hosts, if thou
[1:10:59] will indeed live on the affliction of
[1:11:03] thy hands,
[1:11:05] remember me and not forget thy hand
[1:11:09] hand made.
[1:11:11] If you will give unto thy handmade amen,
[1:11:15] then I will give unto thee unto the Lord
[1:11:18] all the days of his life. And there
[1:11:20] shall not be a razor come upon his name.
[1:11:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She was moaning.
[1:11:27] She was groaning. Hallelujah. Words were
[1:11:30] not coming out. Remember me. I'm your
[1:11:33] servant. Remember me. I'm your servant.
[1:11:36] But the Lord Jehovah Sabath
[1:11:40] stand on your defense.
[1:11:42] The Bible says he's our defense in your
[1:11:46] affliction. He's your defense.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah. He's my advocate.
[1:11:51] He's my advocate. He stand for me. When
[1:11:54] the devil attack me, the prophet said,
[1:11:57] "The Holy Ghost, what is the Holy
[1:11:59] Ghost?" He's the advocate.
[1:12:02] What is the advocator?
[1:12:05] What does he do? He make advocate.
[1:12:08] He has mercy.
[1:12:11] He stands in your place.
[1:12:15] He does things that you cannot do.
[1:12:18] It's appropriation for your sin.
[1:12:21] It's your righteousness.
[1:12:23] It's your healing. It's your life. It's
[1:12:26] your resurrection. It's all God has for
[1:12:29] you. He's your advocate.
[1:12:32] I could we could go Don't put the
[1:12:34] details.
[1:12:37] The prophet says the Holy Ghost is there
[1:12:38] to make advocate.
[1:12:40] He's our
[1:12:43] attorney. He stands there and plead for
[1:12:46] us. We don't plead for ourselves
[1:12:50] because the Holy Ghost in us plead for
[1:12:52] us. The Holy Ghost giving address
[1:12:56] sometimes
[1:12:57] with words you can and you cannot
[1:13:00] understand.
[1:13:01] command intercession for us. That's what
[1:13:05] the Holy Ghost is. When I walk into
[1:13:08] anything, when I walk like a little kid,
[1:13:12] you walk like a little fellow, we are
[1:13:15] walking in the dark world, full of
[1:13:17] enemies,
[1:13:18] full of sin, full of traps,
[1:13:23] full of everything. You said, "Oh, I'm
[1:13:26] afraid. I'm afraid to take the Christian
[1:13:29] life. I'm afraid to do this. I'm afraid
[1:13:32] to I will do this.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid.
[1:13:36] We have an advocate.
[1:13:38] Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, he can stand by us. He's in us. He
[1:13:44] makes intercessor for us. He is the Holy
[1:13:47] Spirit constantly constantly making
[1:13:50] advocate for us
[1:13:52] all the time. Oh, we thank God for it.
[1:13:56] He stand for us. That's why we are
[1:13:59] calling Jehovah
[1:14:01] the Lord of host in the battle.
[1:14:07] One day Elasha one day Elasha was
[1:14:10] surrendered by the enemies
[1:14:13] was surrendered by the enemies. His
[1:14:15] servant saw
[1:14:18] his servant saw the enemy. He came to
[1:14:20] him. He said, "My master, the enemies
[1:14:24] are all over the place. The enem is
[1:14:26] attacking my job. The enemy is attacking
[1:14:28] my family. The enemy are all over the
[1:14:31] place. Oh, Elisha, look at him. He said,
[1:14:34] "Oh Lord," Elisha prayed. He said, "Oh
[1:14:38] Lord, open the eyes of this boy. Open
[1:14:41] the eyes of this boy. Them that are with
[1:14:44] us
[1:14:46] are greater. Them that with us are
[1:14:50] greater are more number.
[1:14:53] The majority."
[1:14:55] Hallelujah. And the prophet says when
[1:14:58] the servant opened the eyes,
[1:15:01] he saw the host.
[1:15:03] He saw the chariots,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; the the mountain full of angels.
[1:15:08] Hallelujah. The prophet said the angel
[1:15:10] did not just get there.
[1:15:13] The angel did not just get there.
[1:15:16] The angel they were there.
[1:15:19] They never left. The problem is the
[1:15:22] servant could not see it. But the angel
[1:15:25] were there. The angel are camping around
[1:15:29] them that fear God. The Lord of hosts
[1:15:36] is standing for us. They will not hurt
[1:15:38] us. They will not ar us.
[1:15:44] There are situation that greater than
[1:15:46] ourselves. Jehovah,
[1:15:49] our general, fivestar general.
[1:15:52] He never lost the battle
[1:15:55] as a fivestar general. He never lost the
[1:15:58] battle.
[1:16:00] Michael,
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; a defender of his people, the defender
[1:16:05] of the saints, he never lost a battle at
[1:16:09] one time. He never lost a battle. He
[1:16:12] conquered death
[1:16:14] and hell. He conquered everything. What
[1:16:18] are you facing tonight? What is the
[1:16:20] great general cannot do? What is the
[1:16:23] greatest cannot do?
[1:16:26] Never lost a battle. Hallelujah. Is
[1:16:28] looking for soldiers.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Not coward. Coward.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Not coward. Looking for soldiers that
[1:16:37] can stand toe-to-toe with the devil.
[1:16:39] Knowing that I have the great, the
[1:16:42] master of the wind,
[1:16:44] the great general by my side, the chief
[1:16:48] captain.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, pray to Jehovah Sab.
[1:16:52] Pray to jo.
[1:16:56] You just pray. You just pray. Prayer is
[1:17:00] the greatest weapon. Prayer is the
[1:17:03] greatest weapon. What a soldier can
[1:17:05] have. You have to make sure after
[1:17:08] knowing the power of your enemy.
[1:17:10] Just make sure you have the weapon.
[1:17:14] Just knowing the power of the enemy.
[1:17:17] After knowing the power of fasting, make
[1:17:20] sure you have the weapon. Prayer is the
[1:17:24] greatest weapon because when you pray,
[1:17:27] you call upon Jehovah.
[1:17:29] You know, Lord, I cannot fight this
[1:17:31] battle. I cannot fight this battle. But
[1:17:34] you are greater. You are greater. This
[1:17:37] problem is not a match for you. This
[1:17:40] situation is not a match for you. This
[1:17:44] attack is not a match for you. I might
[1:17:46] not preach to you, but I'm preaching to
[1:17:48] myself. I might not preach to you. You
[1:17:51] might not get what I'm saying, but I'm
[1:17:53] preaching to myself. This battle, you
[1:17:55] might be greater than my suffer.
[1:17:59] Come fight my battles. Hallelujah. The
[1:18:02] prophet says, you know, the best armor
[1:18:06] that America
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; has in the in this present crisis
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; is God-fearing,
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; praying people.
[1:18:18] The greatest weapon that this church can
[1:18:21] have is praying people is the warriors.
[1:18:26] The war prayer warriors.
[1:18:28] That's the best.
[1:18:31] It's worth them more than all the bombs
[1:18:35] and the things that we could produce.
[1:18:40] God will always fight for his church.
[1:18:43] God will always fight for his people.
[1:18:46] This whole nation with one accord, this
[1:18:50] entire church with one accord
[1:18:53] would throw themsel
[1:18:56] in sack.
[1:18:58] an act of repentance and come back an
[1:19:02] old fashioned pathway
[1:19:05] that our father did
[1:19:08] there could be a bit there couldn't be a
[1:19:12] bit of come to us
[1:19:16] if we can only come and throw ourself in
[1:19:21] s
[1:19:22] there wouldn't be a bit of a home that
[1:19:26] come to us. I believe it's more than all
[1:19:29] the ammunition plates and things that
[1:19:32] they could that we could make and all
[1:19:34] the bomb that we could make. There's
[1:19:37] nothing as great as prayer. Prayer holds
[1:19:41] all the future in his hand. God hold the
[1:19:44] future in his hand. Don't try to defend
[1:19:47] yourself. Don't try to defend yourself.
[1:19:51] Don't try to defend yourself. The
[1:19:53] prophet says when you try to defend
[1:19:55] yourself,
[1:19:56] Don't step back and let you fight.
[1:20:00] Don't try to defend yourself. The
[1:20:03] welfare that we are facing is not canel
[1:20:06] by spiritual.
[1:20:11] The only weapon God has given us.
[1:20:14] It's on our knees. Every time you face a
[1:20:17] battle, every time you face critics,
[1:20:20] every time you face attack,
[1:20:23] go on your knees. That's the greatest
[1:20:25] fear. Don't try to fight back.
[1:20:29] Don't try to fight back. That will be
[1:20:31] the greatest mistakes
[1:20:33] you're going to commit. When you try to
[1:20:36] fight,
[1:20:38] let try to read what the prophet saying
[1:20:40] about
[1:20:42] in the message who is God
[1:20:44] 52. Someone said to me long not long
[1:20:47] ago,
[1:20:49] give me a threat in a certain city.
[1:20:55] Somebody came to brother Bernham.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He said, if you don't quit preaching
[1:20:58] divine healing,
[1:21:01] we will throw a bomb on your platform.
[1:21:05] platform. Somebody came to the Ben. If
[1:21:08] you don't quit preaching
[1:21:10] through a bombat,
[1:21:14] we will kill you
[1:21:17] a threat.
[1:21:19] I said
[1:21:21] the smoke won't dry
[1:21:25] till I will be in the glory. Before the
[1:21:28] smoke dry, even if you kill me, the
[1:21:31] smoke won't dry till I be in the glory.
[1:21:34] That's all right.
[1:21:36] Why we do we do do we feel
[1:21:40] if God be for us who can be against us?
[1:21:44] You know it's written in the Bible. It's
[1:21:46] better than a milestone was hang on your
[1:21:49] neck and throw in the depth of the sea
[1:21:52] than to offend
[1:21:55] these that believe in me in me.
[1:22:00] Listen to what the prophet says.
[1:22:02] If you fight,
[1:22:05] God can fight.
[1:22:08] If you fight, God can fight. If you try
[1:22:13] to pay back, if you try to talk back,
[1:22:17] God cannot fight. Stand still.
[1:22:22] Stand still. Oh, they threatened me. He
[1:22:25] insulted me. Stand still.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; This is not your battle. And be careful.
[1:22:33] You the one criticizing
[1:22:36] critique the servant of God. Be careful.
[1:22:39] You the one attacking the child of God.
[1:22:47] The prophet says, "Stand still.
[1:22:51] Let God fight.
[1:22:53] He will bring it to pass."
[1:22:56] Amen. He will put every critics,
[1:23:00] everything to shame.
[1:23:04] Give everything to shame. Do you believe
[1:23:06] in prayer? Let's settle down to faith.
[1:23:11] Let's settle down to faith. Try to
[1:23:14] fight.
[1:23:15] God won't fight. That's why I said be
[1:23:18] careful. You the one also fighting. You
[1:23:20] the one attacking. Because when a man
[1:23:24] goes to a knee,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; go to the knee and they begin to pray.
[1:23:28] They know, Lord, look at this situation.
[1:23:32] Look at this break. Look at this.
[1:23:34] There's nothing I've done. Look at the
[1:23:37] attack. Look at the critics. They go on
[1:23:40] the knee and they begin to pray. Be
[1:23:43] careful. I'll prefer somebody to talk to
[1:23:46] me.
[1:23:49] But to go on the knee, let somebody go
[1:23:51] on the knee and pray with a heart. Pray
[1:23:55] with a heart. That's dangerous.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; They're dangerous.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You don't know what will happen to you.
[1:24:03] Be careful. When you attack a son of God
[1:24:06] because he might not fight you back. He
[1:24:08] might not have the strength that you
[1:24:09] have. He might not have the strength
[1:24:11] that you have. You might rely on your
[1:24:14] strength.
[1:24:16] Big mouth. taking because you know how
[1:24:19] to talk. You know how to talk. He might
[1:24:22] not know how to talk
[1:24:25] on his knees. He will begin to pray.
[1:24:28] That's dangerous.
[1:24:32] We fight for him.
[1:24:41] That's what I said. Trust in him.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Don't fight back.
[1:24:47] Trust in him.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't fight back.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Just trust him with all you can.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the story, another story
[1:24:57] before I wrap up. We're going to go in
[1:24:59] prayer.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; There was a Muhammad Ali.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Muhammad Ali, the battle in the jungle.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; It actually happened. It actually
[1:25:08] happened in Congo.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; The Muhammad Ali,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; he were fighting the greatest the
[1:25:14] greatest champion at that time.
[1:25:17] That man was called George Foreman.
[1:25:21] And that man was a great he was very
[1:25:23] strong.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; All the odds
[1:25:27] all the odds
[1:25:31] was against Muhammad Ali
[1:25:35] because that man will not go past six
[1:25:38] round.
[1:25:42] But that day in the battle in the jungle
[1:25:46] Muhammad highly studied George Foreman.
[1:25:50] He studied said this man cannot pass six
[1:25:54] round
[1:25:56] if lasted him up to six round
[1:26:02] and in that battle
[1:26:05] started strong.
[1:26:08] He started beating all the old things
[1:26:11] that Muhammad Ali could do. He was
[1:26:15] laying on the rope.
[1:26:17] He was laying on the rope.
[1:26:22] He was laying on the rope.
[1:26:24] First round, he was getting punches
[1:26:26] after punches. Punches after punches,
[1:26:30] punches after punches all the way to
[1:26:32] fifth round.
[1:26:35] tried everything that he could
[1:26:38] tried everything that he could at the
[1:26:40] six rounds he said this one I would
[1:26:45] knock him down the reason why he wasn't
[1:26:47] passing with all these opponents up to
[1:26:50] sixth round
[1:26:53] because he were knocking all his offense
[1:26:55] he was knocking them down
[1:26:58] so he said in this round I will give
[1:27:02] everything my last weapon
[1:27:05] And it's why he punched
[1:27:09] Ali was hit.
[1:27:12] But Muhammad knew that was his last
[1:27:15] punch.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; That was his last punch. And when he
[1:27:20] gave Muhammad Ali the last
[1:27:24] said, "Is that all you got? Is that all
[1:27:28] you got?"
[1:27:29] And at that moment
[1:27:32] lost the battle because he was worn out
[1:27:35] he was tired. At the seventh round at
[1:27:40] the seventh round Muhammad Ali started
[1:27:42] punching
[1:27:44] and he knocked George Foreman down.
[1:27:48] The church of God was beaten
[1:27:52] all six ages
[1:27:54] beaten up. Punches after punches,
[1:27:57] punches after punches, punches after
[1:27:59] punches until the sixth one. The devil
[1:28:03] tried the last one. That was all he got.
[1:28:07] They stand Muhammad Ali of this time,
[1:28:10] the box of this time. He asked the
[1:28:13] devil, "Is that all you got?" Do we have
[1:28:16] the children of God tonight that can
[1:28:19] tell the devil, "Is that all you got?
[1:28:22] Enough is enough. You have tried all the
[1:28:24] punches. You have tried everything that
[1:28:27] you got. Is that what you want? This is
[1:28:30] my time. This is my time. I will knock
[1:28:33] you down. Hallelujah. I'm a warrior. I
[1:28:37] will knock you down. There was a battle
[1:28:40] in the jungle. And one day, there was a
[1:28:43] man Shamar.
[1:28:45] The enemy will come take his stuff.
[1:28:48] Every time he will he will he will sow
[1:28:50] the land, the enemy will come.
[1:28:55] the fruit of his harvest. One day he
[1:28:59] woke up in your head. He said, "I'm a
[1:29:01] child of God. I'm circumcised.
[1:29:04] I'm a child of God. Why I have to
[1:29:06] suffer? Why I have to go through this?
[1:29:09] Why so many battle?" Why every time I
[1:29:12] try something, it does not work. I try
[1:29:15] something, it does not work, the devil
[1:29:17] comes in attack. The devil comes in
[1:29:20] attack. The prophet says, he said,
[1:29:23] "Enough is enough. I'm very tired of
[1:29:25] this situation. I'm very tired of this
[1:29:27] situation. I'm looking for people
[1:29:29] tonight that are tired of this
[1:29:31] situation.
[1:29:32] If you are you are settled with your
[1:29:34] situation, that's fine with you.
[1:29:38] If you are settled with your situation,
[1:29:43] that's fine with you. But I'm looking
[1:29:45] for warriors, hallelujah, that can stand
[1:29:48] and say
[1:29:50] enough is enough. I know the odds
[1:29:53] against me. I know everything is against
[1:29:56] me. Hallelujah. The prophet says there
[1:29:59] were 600 train
[1:30:02] 600 trainmen soldiers.
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:06] That man took everything he got.
[1:30:09] He took everything he got and he slew
[1:30:12] 600 people and he saved his family.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He took also the jawbone.
[1:30:20] He took the jaw bone. The jawbone the
[1:30:23] prophet was old.
[1:30:25] Look at it.
[1:30:27] He could not resist
[1:30:30] the helmet of the enemy. But Samson did
[1:30:34] not think. He took the jawbone and he
[1:30:37] started sooing the enemy. And the
[1:30:40] prophet says, "If God, I don't have time
[1:30:42] to read it. If God can take the old
[1:30:44] jawbone,
[1:30:48] what can you do with a jawbone that is
[1:30:51] alive?
[1:30:54] Do you understand that? A jawbone that
[1:30:57] is alive, you have, you have a jawbone.
[1:31:01] That means God can use your mouth.
[1:31:06] If you can use dead old deadone
[1:31:11] with your live jawbone
[1:31:16] read it quickly
[1:31:19] paradox paradox
[1:31:22] why brother
[1:31:24] that's all the rotten jaw bone of that
[1:31:26] me
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:31] you will eat one of them big brass
[1:31:33] helmet with
[1:31:38] Why you would have splatted in thousand
[1:31:41] pieces
[1:31:48] but he was a paradox.
[1:31:50] God was in that old job.
[1:31:55] If he can get a one on a dead one,
[1:32:01] surely he can on ours that is alive.
[1:32:07] He can use ours.
[1:32:10] So tonight I want you to take don't
[1:32:12] think don't think get whatever you have.
[1:32:16] Use your
[1:32:18] pray until you answer. Pray until you
[1:32:22] answer.
[1:32:23] says God is looking for some people that
[1:32:27] cannot take no as an answer
[1:32:32] that cannot take no as an answer. The
[1:32:34] problem is you pray and you stop until
[1:32:38] the next meeting.
[1:32:41] God is looking for people that can stand
[1:32:44] there
[1:32:46] until the answer. I will not leave here.
[1:32:50] Jacob, I will not leave here. You will
[1:32:52] find my bone here. I will not leave here
[1:32:56] until you give me what I made before.
[1:33:00] Use your jawbone. Use your jawbone.
[1:33:03] Claim whatever you have. You are a
[1:33:05] soldier. Go claim whatever you got.
[1:33:09] Abraham went to claim
[1:33:12] lot. Claim everything that you got. Oh,
[1:33:16] don't be lazy, my brother. Don't be
[1:33:18] lazy, my sister. Claim everything that
[1:33:21] you got. Claim with everything that you
[1:33:23] got, whatever the devil has taken from
[1:33:26] you. Fight. Claim whatever belongs to
[1:33:29] you. Finish with this quote
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; in the message. Possessing all things
[1:33:36] 57.
[1:33:40] Abraham could possess the that land
[1:33:44] and what was in it.
[1:33:46] God give it to him. Lot was a part of
[1:33:50] that land.
[1:33:52] God gave Abraham that land
[1:33:56] everything that was in that land.
[1:33:59] God gave you your family and everybody
[1:34:02] that's in the family. God gave you your
[1:34:05] church and everybody that's in that
[1:34:08] church. God gave you your possession.
[1:34:11] God gave you this message. God gave you
[1:34:14] the message. Every promise is a message
[1:34:18] belongs to you. So Abraham had the right
[1:34:21] to it.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; You have the right to it. He could go
[1:34:27] and lay hold on it.
[1:34:30] Paragraph 57
[1:34:32] possessing all things.
[1:34:38] He said now God you made me a promise.
[1:34:44] What is the promise God has given to
[1:34:46] you?
[1:34:47] If God has given you a promise today,
[1:34:50] what is that promise? You made me a
[1:34:52] promise. That word was in this land.
[1:34:57] All it was, it's all mine.
[1:35:00] You made me a promise.
[1:35:03] Now my kinsman has been taken.
[1:35:07] My child has been taken. You gave me a
[1:35:10] promise. Lord, I believe this message
[1:35:13] not to be in shame. You gave me a
[1:35:16] promise. Pina is mocking me. You
[1:35:19] promised me Samuel. You gave me a
[1:35:22] promise. I refuse to die with this.
[1:35:26] I refuse to die with this.
[1:35:30] I will not take no as an answer. You
[1:35:33] gave me this promise. I will not lose my
[1:35:36] beloved.
[1:35:38] Stay there and fight.
[1:35:41] 58. In other words, if we apply today,
[1:35:46] I'll say the church could say, "Lord
[1:35:50] God, he is my brother laying there. He
[1:35:53] is my brother Ling." Do you have Do we
[1:35:56] have people that he needs tonight? We
[1:35:59] have tonight. But the church of God
[1:36:02] could say, "He is my brother laying
[1:36:04] here,
[1:36:06] stricken with cancer,
[1:36:08] he's stricken with tuberculosis,
[1:36:10] tuberculosis. He's got so and so. He's
[1:36:14] got this problem. This problem.
[1:36:16] I laid off all the promise.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I I lay hold of the promise.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; It's my possession.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; You told me. You told me so.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; There you are. Then you can come after
[1:36:31] the enemy.
[1:36:33] You can come after the enemy, the devil,
[1:36:37] and slaughter it.
[1:36:39] Do you have warrior tonight that can go
[1:36:42] after the enemy
[1:36:44] and slaughter the enemy and slaughter
[1:36:47] the enemy? Don't give him a chance to
[1:36:49] run.
[1:36:51] Don't give him a chance to run.
[1:36:53] Slaughter the enemy.
[1:36:56] It's just the same as Abraham
[1:36:57] slaughtered the king.
[1:37:02] Yet Abraham had the right to the promise
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and the promise was easy. Yet he has the
[1:37:10] he has but yet he had to fight to make
[1:37:12] it. Yes, the promise is yours.
[1:37:17] Fight to possess it. The believer today
[1:37:21] yet we are here to all things.
[1:37:25] Yet we are here to every spiritual
[1:37:28] blessing,
[1:37:30] every physical blessing, every blessing
[1:37:33] the Bible promises.
[1:37:36] Yet you have to fight every inch of it.
[1:37:41] That's the way God has set it up. It
[1:37:44] always been that way. You have to fight
[1:37:47] to possess it.
[1:37:49] What you got the way God is set it up.
[1:37:54] You have to fight with what you you know
[1:37:56] it's your own.
[1:37:59] You have to fight to possess it.
[1:38:02] You say brother need healing.
[1:38:05] The promise is yours. But if you ever
[1:38:08] get it,
[1:38:10] you can't get it easy.
[1:38:13] If you can get your healing
[1:38:16] happen easy,
[1:38:18] you're going to have to fight.
[1:38:21] You're going to take it away from Satan.
[1:38:26] Satan capture your house.
[1:38:29] You have the right to to go to Satan.
[1:38:35] Give it back.
[1:38:38] Give it back. What Satan has taken from
[1:38:41] you tonight,
[1:38:43] you have the right to go because you're
[1:38:46] not going alone. Jehovah Saboth is with
[1:38:49] you. Just go and tell the devil, use
[1:38:54] your jaw bone. Use your jawbone. Take it
[1:38:58] back. Satan, give it back.
[1:39:06] Hand it over.
[1:39:08] I come in the name of Jesus Christ. The
[1:39:11] possess of heavens and earth.
[1:39:14] I'm his ear. Give it back. You took my
[1:39:18] child. You got her mixed up with the
[1:39:21] wrong boy.
[1:39:23] [Music]
[1:39:24] You took my boy.
[1:39:27] You took my girl
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; and you took her with the wrong girl.
[1:39:31] I claim them.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. I claim my children. I
[1:39:36] claim my brother. I claim my sister.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan. You have took them from
[1:39:42] God's house. Cross them out,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; but I'm coming after them. I claim them.
[1:39:50] I'm here of all things. Amen. It's given
[1:39:53] to me. I can I can claim everything God
[1:39:57] has promised.
[1:39:59] There you are. It's mine. How do you get
[1:40:02] it? Something you done? No sir. It's
[1:40:06] unmmerited
[1:40:08] that God gave us.
[1:40:11] It's ours.
[1:40:13] It belongs to us. God Satan cannot hold
[1:40:16] it. Satan cannot take it. Satan lay
[1:40:20] down. Satan lay down.
[1:40:24] Satan lay down.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Lay my promise down.
[1:40:28] Let my child go. Lay my child go. Lay
[1:40:33] down. Amen. Amen. I like that. Satan lay
[1:40:37] down.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Took it from me.
[1:40:41] Give it back.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Because I'm serving notice to you.
[1:40:45] Slaughter shame. You should slaughter
[1:40:48] that poverty. You should slaughter that
[1:40:50] property. You should slaughter that.
[1:40:55] Healing is yours.
[1:40:57] Healing is mine. Money is mine. Job
[1:41:01] says, "Gold and silver belong to me. The
[1:41:05] Holy Ghost is mine. The Holy Life is
[1:41:08] mine. My children are mine. My husband
[1:41:12] is mine. My wife is mine. I'm not a
[1:41:16] coward. I'm a soldier. I have to
[1:41:19] slaughter until I take back what belongs
[1:41:22] to me. This whole land I know it's full
[1:41:25] of itites. I know it's full of Amorites.
[1:41:29] I'm also full of giants.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; But it belongs to me. Hallelujah. This
[1:41:34] promise God of prayer.
[1:41:37] This is my possession. Why can I I
[1:41:39] cannot have this? Why I cannot have
[1:41:42] this? I've been praying for so long.
[1:41:45] I've been praying for this promise for
[1:41:46] so long. Why can't I have this? It's
[1:41:50] mine. Satan has to lay it down.
[1:41:53] Hallelujah. I believe this message and I
[1:41:56] cannot fail. I cannot fail. Hallelujah.
[1:42:01] God did not bring me to this message to
[1:42:04] fail. Never. I will never fail. Oh, I
[1:42:08] abandoned as a sister. You abandoned
[1:42:11] Pence.
[1:42:13] Abandon Pence. You abandon all the
[1:42:16] worldly pleasure of this world is to
[1:42:18] fail.
[1:42:20] No Jehovah
[1:42:22] will now fail you. Hallelujah. I will
[1:42:25] never leave this place. You can break my
[1:42:28] bone if you don't give me my answer. You
[1:42:32] find my bone here. I'm tired of losing.
[1:42:36] Tired of losing. Where's the the army of
[1:42:39] God?
[1:42:40] The army of God that can stand. Oh,
[1:42:44] hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Get Satan.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Get out of my family. Get out of my
