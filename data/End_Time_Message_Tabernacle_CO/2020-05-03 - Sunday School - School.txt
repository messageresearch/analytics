Bible and pray thank you hi everybody it's Sharon I'm happy to see you here and to get this opportunity to speak to you I know that it's been a long time by been together and we haven't really been able to you know come to Sunday school together and share the Word of God but this doesn't mean that we can't pray on their own and you know spend time we've got alone so I hope you're staying safe I hope you're doing well I hope you're behaving and you know not giving your parents a hard time so may God bless you enjoy the council very weather enjoy revocation or absorb that we're just here anywhere so that we haven't forgot about you that we love you and we're just going to see how we're going to move forward with this school for those who are in my price subjects but we had talked about where possible Caesarea of joke and we're part of jokes testimony and how he was a presser meant and the kind of testimony that he had among the people and how old the Lord harbored ever saw his testimony and decided that he was going to go and arrest him and oh they're forbidden to go to that chair and was lost and how his friend came and tried to comfort him but there were miserable comforters obviously I said the live decided to let the child pass and he rewarded him with mother did not say he had and we had left us with the book of Judges we hadn't started talking about the dresses yet but maybe when we get back we'll start talking about that the best basically that we kept with those that were in my Sunday school choir sounds good Thank You Shalom and for those who are in my class you know since the beginning of the year we've been talking a lot about prayer and you know different stories and just to kind of talk about this you know we're going to this time of twenty nande everybody is at home we can't go to school we can't go out you know to church or to other places that were used to going out to it's a time where everybody wants to stay in the house we have to stay stay but just kind of to remember the stories that we talked about also relating to prayer talks about Daniel and we talked about Daniel how even though he was all by himself and he didn't have been in church to go gather to pray and he didn't have any family to pray with but still on his own even as a young boy he found time always to lock himself up in the room and to pray to God so that just shows to us that also in this time of pointing you know we can't go out to church or to Sunday school to worship God but even on our own we can always go we'll find time going our looms read our Bibles pray even we don't have to have our parents voices all the time so we can always do that and for Jonah also he talked about the story of Jonah and how even in the belly of the whale when things looked bad when he wasn't at church but he still had time where he could go on his knees and pray to God so even as us also where by our on our own excuse me maybe we can't go to church but we can still have timing no matter what situation to always go get down on our knees and pray to God pray for our parents pray for our church pray for our siblings pray for each other because the Bible tells us you know pray for one another so especially during this time maybe you might be okay I don't have school I'm kind of bored you know God always wants to hear your prayer and he loves when little children speak to God so take your time pray to God he's gonna hear you and he's gonna answer you because that's the God we serve all right thank you very much that's all I have to say all right guys as you can hear pretty much like you know as the teachers of just like you know presented it to you diesem we are going through really hard times you know nevertheless we all know as sister Shalom who said like you know job going through a hard time but it ain't under at all you know God delivered him and that's basically what we go through right now you know pretty much the entire world is really sitting on a ship now we're like you know nobody can go out nobody can do really much you know everybody's like you know let down in their houses but yeah in the meantime this is the time to be really obedient to the parents to pray a lot you know to be more or if you son and daughter of God to be really a wonderful Christian this is the time you know but nevertheless you know we appreciate that you know you were able to join you know this time and we are grateful to you know never dull like you know the world is in a very tough situation but at least like you know we have daddy we have mommy we have our siblings around us and it's you know this is really like you know the moment that we can be really appreciative to the Lord and say like you know laws thank you so much for you know for everything that we you have given us and you have protected our parents during this time of trials and and struggle people just don't know what you do you know but God is keeping you alive or maybe you've heard on the news how dying people are suffering people are you know going through hard times and stuff but you know God is giving you you know the breath of life and you know this is one good reason to praise the Lord isn't that guys yeah you know yeah that's that's really like you know a good point like you not to come and praise the Lord and be appreciative unto the Lord all right and wonderful god bless you so much thank you brother Martin I hope you guys are encouraged by the message you received from your Sunday School teachers now we're going to listen to this song from sister hope thank you Lord for your blessings on me the world looks up taught me as I struggle [Music] but so [Music] I'm rejoicing how I wish they could see [Music] for your Oh Zuzu's up above me diver good there's food on my table and the shoes on food you dare me and the fine thank you for your blessings our I know I'm not wealthy these clothes there I don't have much money but lord I and that's all that matters though the world may not see there thank you for your [Music] cuz they're Zeus up above and our good place Susie there's food on my table and shoes on Lord you gave me [Music] and a fight fair [Music] thank you for your blessings on me thank you Lord for your blessings on me [Applause] we all know that during this time we all have to stay at home the reason I have to stay at home is basically because they're trying to keep ourselves safe we're trying to pilot people say so amazing you might throw out a few mousy people with masks on we have that we called our social distancing basically you know not to get too close to anybody so that we don't throw jabs all get in contact with Jerry we're just washing your hands lease for 20 20 minutes and all that is good basically you're supposed to be doing that to keep myself safe but as Christians we also have to remember that we have our earth also and spiritual eyes that we have to try to protect and keep safe and keep maintaining right so it is more important a lot of times as well if we can give a better example and moving your phones or someone around us if they're happy and they're laughing they're even just a stranger with laughing or something like that you know even though rather lucky but all of a sudden you find yourself you're laughing and we're smiling well because they rubbed off on you right it's time to adjust so officials it's easy to catch so that's why a lot of times you ask them for SMS cooties rape are you all service and bad influences from Bad feds right because we're 10 so here goes to protect your physical your virtual office so that method would be nothing will be with you in birth rate but maybe right members a little bit ever really applied to me because we don't go I wouldn't do anything there even at home you know there's nothing to do these days now we have some other boosters our phones tablets or whatever and we might get distracted and remove that respect about our own spiritual life every but better with this triple and restores virtualize because we to take care of it so in all this we have to be careful that we're watching what we're listening to right to make sure that we have our particular member but I marvel oh yes so all that in comes in handy right because we never would try to do anything to just hinder our growth in the Lord and you know everybody will use anything any medals any little small from difficult earn you can't feel the junk it was very small to have to use your special microscopes special glasses just to see something with the bevel but that was very sneaky so here attitude to try to destroy you and took you from spiritual growing and let's virtual system I should say in that way so where is the key read your Bible for every day to keep your spiritual walk with them they're fresh growing and health and healthy we're trying to keep other people safe right if you have to watch how am i acting on people what am I saying you know this members helping Romania pegs listening or bowing just doing what you're supposed to do whatever the Word of God told you to do and obviously passed we were through that and all these things you just have to remember that God has survived in his hand he knows what he's doing he knew in his head he's protecting your best way at Sunday school here teachers here we're here baby we're help you in your spiritual multiplied so but you don't stop there as the song says you know you read your Bibles probably better if you don't reassuring you were buying the best reputable ones to be happening to you so for the next week I whispering this time we'll be here to do the best of keep care of yourself thank you so much we hope that you enjoyed your little Sunday School lesson as dishum said just remember always always to stay safe make sure to always keep your spiritual walk with God no matter what and God got us covered right God will take care of us God always promised you and then we leave us with this APIs so let's just continue praising God as the Bible says I will praise the Lord as long as either that's in Psalm 146 - so let's all that always they are mind that you will praise the Lord whether you know things are looking good so thank you we hope that you're doing okay and you have a great week we love you miss you guys or always praying for you guys if you need anything that's you know it's a plus see you soon bye bye
