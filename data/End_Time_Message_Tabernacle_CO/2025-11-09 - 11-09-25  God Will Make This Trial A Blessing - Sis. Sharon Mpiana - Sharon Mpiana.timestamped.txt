[0:13] [music]
[0:23] I've just [singing] come into a valley,
[0:26] [music]
[0:28] one like I've Never been before.
[0:30] [singing]
[0:33] I keep [music] searching for a way
[0:36] [singing] out.
[0:38] Seems like padlocks [music]
[0:40] are on the door. [singing]
[0:42] Oh, there must be another [music]
[0:45] [singing] sunrise,
[0:48] another sunset that I [music] see.
[0:52] God will make [singing]
[0:54] this trial a blessing.
[0:57] That's the [singing and music] love he
[0:59] has for me.
[1:03] God [singing]
[1:04] will make this trial a blessing.
[1:09] Though it [singing] sends me to my
[1:12] knees,
[1:14] though my [singing] tears flow like a
[1:17] river,
[1:18] [music] yet in him there is [singing]
[1:20] sweet relief.
[1:23] There's no [music] need to get
[1:26] discouraged.
[1:27] [singing] There's no need to talk
[1:30] defeat.
[1:32] God [music] will make this trial
[1:34] [singing] a blessing.
[1:37] And the whole wide world will [singing]
[1:40] see.
[1:44] I was not the first one [singing]
[1:48] to come into this place.
[1:53] You [singing] see, every son of God,
[1:58] this [singing] test [music] he must
[2:00] face, it is here that [music] God will
[2:05] mold you and make you what [singing] he
[2:08] wants you to be.
[2:11] God will make this trial a blessing.
[2:14] [music]
[2:16] Just be patient [singing]
[2:17] and you'll see.
[2:21] God will make this trial a blessing.
[2:26] [singing and music]
[2:27] Though he sends me to my knees,
[2:31] though my tears [music] flow [singing]
[2:33] like a river,
[2:36] yet in him there is sweet
[2:38] [singing and music] relief.
[2:40] There's no need to get discouraged.
[2:45] There's no [singing] need to talk
[2:47] defeat. [music]
[2:49] God will make this trial a [singing]
[2:52] blessing
[2:54] and the whole wide world will see.
[3:01] Now [singing] standing on the mountain,
[3:05] looking [music and singing] back, I can
[3:08] see when I was in that lowest valley,
[3:13] [music]
[3:14] his [singing] strong hand was leading
[3:16] me. It [music]
[3:19] was [singing] good to see the sunshine
[3:23] and to [singing] taste sweet victory.
[3:27] God has made my trial a blessing.
[3:32] [music] Oh, the [singing] grace he gives
[3:35] to me.
[3:37] God has made my trial a blessing.
[3:43] Though he [singing] sent me to my knees,
[3:47] though my tears [singing and music] flow
[3:49] like a river,
[3:52] yet in him there [music] we relieve.
[3:56] There's no [singing] need to get
[3:59] discouraged.
[4:00] There's no [singing] need to talk
[4:03] defeat.
[4:05] God has made my trial a blessing
[4:10] and the whole [music and singing] wide
[4:11] world will see.
[4:15] God
[4:16] has made your [singing and music] trial
[4:19] a blessing
[4:21] and the whole [singing] wide world will
[4:25] see. [music]
[4:28] [applause]
[4:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it one more time
[4:32] together. God will make this trial a
[4:37] blessing. [music and singing]
[4:39] Lord, he sends me to my knees.
[4:44] Though my tears [singing and music] flow
[4:45] like a river,
[4:48] yet in him the sweet relief,
[4:52] [singing] there's no need [music] to get
[4:55] discouraged.
[4:57] There's no need [singing and music] to
[4:59] talk defeat.
[5:01] God will make this trial a blessing
[5:05] [music]
[5:06] and the whole wide world will see. You
[5:10] believe that? Amen.
