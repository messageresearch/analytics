[6:07] announcements before
[6:09] we continue the series with uh brad
[6:11] branham
[6:17] and i forgot to ask you to pray for my
[6:20] son joe
[6:22] demanded the priest i'm official she's
[6:25] not feeling good
[6:27] you know you say somebody so
[6:30] he's home
[6:32] yeah and
[6:36] also
[6:38] since the beginning of the year you will
[6:40] see the debut delaney
[6:44] i've worked so much
[6:48] it was the time i was doing this on
[6:50] consecration
[6:55] and i was also busy with uh
[6:59] my work
[7:02] and right after that i went to
[7:05] the bumbashi it's just a bridge
[7:08] where i was preaching almost one month
[7:11] there is a pressure
[7:14] right after i took uh
[7:17] i came back but it was the time to
[7:19] prepare for the special meetings
[7:25] and then i went for the youth meeting in
[7:27] uh
[7:28] france
[8:01] even herself with all the visits we had
[8:05] it was a lot of stress
[8:15] amen
[8:16] i think it's also good thing as we grow
[8:20] old
[8:23] to take really vacation you depend on
[8:26] the vermouth of accounts not really time
[8:28] off just the time off from work is okay
[8:35] but sometimes we take off we are busy
[8:38] with other things maybe
[8:41] i don't know
[8:47] but i think a real vacation where you
[8:49] relax yourself it's very very important
[8:58] i will really encourage people from time
[9:00] to time for your own benefit to take
[9:03] vacation time for yourselves
[9:14] amen amen
[9:16] and also from time to time do a
[9:20] physical checkup with your doctor the
[9:23] thousand thousand fed this examiner
[9:25] physical doctor
[9:27] when i came back from congo i the first
[9:30] thing is to schedule an appointment with
[9:32] the doctor to check you to do the basic
[9:34] things
[9:42] because you don't realize even the
[9:44] preaching work how much pressure that is
[9:52] you see a preacher standing on the
[9:53] platform
[9:54] predicated
[9:56] you don't know what he has been doing
[9:58] during the week and even the night
[10:00] before he come here um
[10:16] so before we bring our brother
[10:20] brandon lunda to the platform

[10:42] bit here those who have read and those

[20:59] the hardest question for sisterhood
[21:13] compassionate
[21:21] thank you god bless you uh the
[21:23] translation say the translation said
[21:26] root means female friend compassion
[21:43] why do they call
[21:45] root
[21:46] the moabitess because it is more british
[21:53] why
[22:01] if you heard that they call her the
[22:02] morbidities right
[22:04] why they call her morbidities
[22:09] we scale a bit too because she lives
[22:12] well because uh
[22:14] originally she was not from uh the
[22:16] jewish she was not from israel she was
[22:19] from uh
[22:20] from moab is uh thank you like a foreign
[22:30] yeah because the family of elimelech and
[22:34] naomi who are the jew they left jew
[22:37] is a palestine because they did not have
[22:42] food bread and they went to the land of
[22:45] moab and this is what they found
[22:58] so the family was a family a jews family
[23:03] right amen allah for me for me
[23:06] and they had the children in the land of
[23:09] moab he's only the founder of the moab
[23:12] and the two boys
[23:15] chilean and uh
[23:17] maryland
[23:18] and my lord who did they marry did they
[23:20] marry women from their home country or
[23:24] they marry the woman from
[23:26] moab
[23:31] a bit frank
[23:33] frank
[23:42] so now we are talking about moab more
[23:44] and more who can tell me where moab came
[23:48] from sister
[24:01] play
[24:08] [Music]
[24:20] oh no i sure you should know everybody
[24:23] no no no no no no no that's not my my
[24:25] listen
[24:30] with this only
[24:42] thank you
[24:56] is
[25:05] [Music]
[25:24] thank you pastor
[25:26] um i think that
[25:31] um
[25:41] when lotto left um
[25:49] they left he left him i love him
[25:54] oh
[26:09] so
[26:10] if you can understand the reason i'm
[26:13] asking this because the book of roots is
[26:15] a big book of redemption
[26:17] [Music]
[26:23] you cannot understand the full story of
[26:25] redemption without understanding what
[26:28] god did in the life of roots
[26:35] and you know every time they talk about
[26:36] women in the bible it's talking about
[26:39] church
[26:45] we talked about opera
[26:47] what does open represent
[26:50] which kind
[27:00] sister christina if you can remember
[27:02] yourself
[27:07] are you here crazy
[27:10] okay okay
[27:11] what does your sister patience what's
[27:14] your passions
[27:23] yeah she was a
[27:25] backslide but is it
[27:28] um
[27:30] the bride that's question
[27:34] no no don't ask a question if you are
[27:36] not asked
[27:39] representing the bride
[27:41] representative
[28:04] so she represents which kind of church
[28:06] will represent
[28:13] a
[28:15] gentiles that's very important
[28:19] and hoot both represent gentile churches
[28:27] no no opera and the hood they represent
[28:30] the gentile church
[28:34] one is a lukewarm church which is
[28:37] backslide which is oppa and a tiered
[28:41] represent
[28:42] and the other one root which represents
[28:45] the
[28:46] gentle church of the bride
[28:53] so in other words when you look at the
[28:55] book of root the book of good is the
[28:57] book of the bride
[29:06] so this is a great mystery hello
[29:10] mistake
[29:12] this would
[29:13] say read
[29:15] she came from
[29:19] a shameful family a venue for me on
[29:22] tours
[29:23] because when you know the story of lot
[29:27] because
[29:28] of the lord lord was separated with
[29:30] abraham lord
[29:32] abraham and when they have to leave
[29:35] sodom and gomorrah can they recognize
[29:39] they told gulot and his wife not to look
[29:42] back only a lot esa from the paris
[29:44] garden
[29:45] and they were running
[29:48] to a certain extent
[29:50] lord's wife formed a lot
[30:01] so therefore lord did not longer have a
[30:04] wife a lord lord never play the farm
[30:08] is that correct
[30:11] without a wife a lot of sons in the
[30:12] family lot was going to the land of zoa
[30:16] hello
[30:18] with his two daughters
[30:35] and they wanted to
[30:36] know everybody
[30:38] connected to the moon but the lord said
[30:40] hello today i have two daughters
[30:44] who never knew men
[30:46] but don't touch the angels i learned to
[30:49] i can offer you these two daughters
[30:52] but the inhabitants of sodom they
[30:54] refused elizabeth
[30:57] when the angel told the lord to go out
[30:59] with his two daughter plus his wife
[31:13] so lot went with his two daughters
[31:30] where we are going
[31:33] there is no brother
[31:35] there are no men
[31:37] to help us have children who knows that
[31:40] what is um for the only man we have here
[31:43] the son um
[31:51] he's not going to accept to sleep with
[31:53] us he never accepted the new pond
[31:56] therefore don't let us give him wine a
[31:59] lot of faith only what you thought and
[32:01] they gave their dad wine
[32:04] dad drunk papaya
[32:06] and at night
[32:08] the oldest daughter
[32:11] went to sleep with her dad
[32:15] and the next day
[32:17] she told her younger sister
[32:19] you too go sleep with daddy today
[32:23] and they gave again daddy wine called
[32:27] and the daddy slept a papaya satan with
[32:30] the youngest avec laplacian so therefore
[32:33] donkey the two daughters of lord they
[32:35] defeated the lord they became a pregnant
[32:38] from their father
[32:40] and santa
[32:42] are you listening to the story
[32:45] so the eldest hello
[32:48] deliver the first child
[32:52] and they named the child moab hello
[33:09] owned
[33:10] and the second daughter has another
[33:12] child
[33:16] they call him ben annie omni or
[33:18] something like that
[33:20] which is the origin of the ammonite
[33:51] bride
[33:52] we came from a very shameful background
[33:57] we have no merit
[34:00] but the work of redemption
[34:03] has provided a way for roots
[34:07] from the ridiculous
[34:10] to the sublime to the sibling to be the
[34:13] wife
[34:14] of the boys
[34:16] and from that relationship
[34:31] [Music]
[34:42] is coming from the
[34:44] descendant of root the more batista
[34:59] i will give you the scripture if you
[35:00] want to take genesis chapter 19.
[35:06] from verse 30 to verse 38.
[35:10] you will read the story
[35:13] of how the children listen foreign
[35:17] uh went and gave wine to their father
[35:20] somebody donated
[35:22] this is to tell you wine is not a good
[35:24] thing
[35:27] don't you
[35:28] drink because you will do things that
[35:31] you may never thought
[35:36] show me genesis 19 verse 30.
[35:40] hunter
[35:45] if the usher can give the mic to
[35:48] our brother
[35:50] lord went out of zoar and dwelt in the
[35:53] mountain and he and his two daughters
[35:57] with him
[36:04] next verse
[36:07] and the first one said unto the younger
[36:09] our father is old and there is not a man
[36:13] in the earth to come into us
[36:15] after the manner of all the earth
[36:24] latte
[36:26] come let us
[36:28] make our father drink wine and we will
[36:31] lay with him that we may preserve
[36:34] seed of our father
[36:38] not repairing
[36:47] you can read the rest of the verse i'm
[36:49] skipping
[36:51] that's where both the daughters of lord
[36:54] with the child by their father philip
[36:56] defeat the lord to consider the lord
[36:59] paige
[37:00] you see that's the bible
[37:02] and the first born to bear his son and
[37:04] called his name moab
[37:10] the same is the father of the moabites
[37:14] unto this day
[37:19] when they called hoot the moabites
[37:32] but regardless of what the name was
[37:53] [Music]
[38:03] he said when hoot made her decision
[38:08] she did not expect to receive any reward
[38:14] what about you and i connected
[38:17] with a decision
[38:19] in and out
[38:20] not a stable decision a vacuum decision
[38:23] balance my prime decision stable when
[38:26] you even know that there is a great

[45:47] one to nine and naomi had a kinsmen of
[45:51] her husband a mighty man of wealth of
[45:53] the family of

[46:02] me now go to the field and glean here is
[46:05] of corn after him in whose sight i shall
[46:07] find grace and she said unto her go my
[46:11] daughter and she went and came and
[46:14] gleaned in the field after the reapers
[46:16] and her hap was too light on on a part
[46:19] of the field belonging onto boaz who was
[46:22] at the
[46:23] kindred of mahali malek and behold boaz
[46:26] came from bethlehem and said unto the
[46:29] reapers the lord be with you and they
[46:32] answered him the lord blessed thee then
[46:35] i said boaz unto the servant that was
[46:38] set over the reapers whose damsel is
[46:40] this and the servant that was set over
[46:44] the reapers answered and said it is the
[46:46] moabitess damsel that came back with
[46:49] naomi out of the country of moab and she
[46:52] said i pray you let me glean and
[46:54] gathered after the reapers among the
[46:57] sheaves so she came and have continued
[47:00] even from the morning until now that she
[47:02] carried a little in the in the house
[47:06] then
[47:06] said boaz unto ruth he rest doubt not my
[47:10] daughter good not to glean in another
[47:12] field neither go from hands but abide
[47:16] here faster by my maidens
[47:19] nine
[47:20] let thine irons bees be on the field
[47:23] that they do reap and go down after them
[47:27] i have if i not charge start the young
[47:30] men that they shall not
[47:32] touch thee and when thou art our thirst
[47:36] go unto the vessels and drink of that
[47:38] which the young men have drawn
[47:42] amen amen

[47:57] christ salvation where i
[48:00] greet your brother eddie lucas

[48:36] i think as if the pastor the question
[48:38] that he asked
[48:42] a old man is still a grown man amen amen
[49:01] and then i wondered what should we say
[49:03] again this morning
[49:11] even myself when he was asking questions
[49:13] i was wondering myself or what would
[49:15] have been scared
[49:17] but i think that
[49:21] but i think that he since he's a teacher
[49:26] i think that you know the foundation was
[49:28] laid down come over scientifically how
[49:31] do you fulfill with those questions
[49:42] as the pastor recommended us to read the
[49:45] book of ruth
[49:47] it's for our god
[49:50] it's for the good understanding basque
[49:53] on paper for two days because at times
[49:57] we cannot say all things too long
[49:59] possible
[50:00] from every angle
[50:02] i did since the pastor said it can vomit
[50:06] when you read yourself
[50:10] and when the preacher will go you are
[50:13] enlightened amen
[50:17] i think that all these questions that we
[50:18] asked are to come back
[50:21] i think that this time is clear amen
[50:23] amen
[50:35] i believe that everybody have the
[50:36] understanding of what the name of ruth
[50:39] means eliminations and so on
[50:43] now to save us time

[2:18:48] instead of saying may god bless him no
[2:18:51] twatico
[2:18:52] no you start envying him
[2:18:55] probably we have seen it even in the
[2:18:57] ministry
[2:19:02] because we go in the convention
[2:19:04] somewhere
[2:19:05] there it is that number god says he uses
[2:19:09] a conversation according to the way of
[2:19:11] convention ill precious season he
[2:19:13] preaches on the subject
[2:19:16] on the theme of the convention
[2:19:18] that
[2:19:47] open up the competition we are not
[2:19:48] competing
[2:19:52] you know kane
[2:19:54] kane the problem
[2:19:56] against a problem
[2:19:59] it was not uh it was
[2:20:27] how is that
[2:21:02] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:21:07] between the sanctification baptism of
[2:21:09] the holy ghost
[2:21:11] as we saw that there are two hearts
[2:21:14] that's anchor this is a heart
[2:21:17] success this is another heart
[2:21:20] dancer is in this heart here
[2:21:23] in
[2:21:24] la colon there's
[2:21:38] the first step of justification
[2:21:42] when you are baptized in the name of
[2:21:44] jesus christ
[2:21:46] the lord justifies you
[2:21:48] of oppression god doesn't see you
[2:21:50] he forgives you of allah
[2:21:54] but nevertheless there's still that
[2:21:55] serpent in your heart
[2:21:58] that's the reason why members
[2:22:01] even if the brother asks for forgiveness
[2:22:03] anyhow
[2:22:04] for you to forgive you
[2:22:10] i've seen the sisters in the same church
[2:22:13] he prayed like center center they take
[2:22:15] the the communion
[2:22:17] but they don't talk to each other
[2:22:19] and lenny d and one
[2:22:32] look at how well she's dressed
[2:22:40] you may think that she has the holy
[2:22:41] ghost
[2:22:42] you say you might eat she's even

[2:22:47] sherry but the serpent in there in the
[2:22:49] in the mid flesh
[2:22:50] purchases
[2:22:51] what do you want for this serpent to be
[2:22:53] killed my swivel you follow
[2:22:57] you past justification
[2:22:59] sanctification now certification
[2:23:01] celebrated
[2:23:05] [Applause]
[2:23:13] [Applause]
[2:23:15] it's the work that you have to do for
[2:23:18] sanctification
[2:23:22] the word sanctifies
[2:23:24] sanctification when the word sanctifies
[2:23:26] you
[2:23:27] it removes all the dirties
[2:23:30] it is not all acceptable you follow in
[2:23:33] the yeah it requires that god
[2:23:36] because here let's say
[2:23:38] the serpent is still here
[2:23:41] you are still struggling to develop you
[2:23:44] don't want me

[2:23:55] when the soul the violent area comes in
[2:23:58] the heart so
[2:24:05] [Music]
[2:24:13] money and when the serpent is completely
[2:24:15] destroyed
[2:24:17] now that the sweet dolphins i'm saying
[2:24:19] let's be honest the holy ghost comes in
[2:24:23] somebody's life
[2:24:24] consciously he has no conscience of sin
[2:24:27] hallelujah hallelujah

[2:24:38] criticize him
[2:24:54] the tempest
[2:25:22] those
[2:25:37] papaska is your president it's not
[2:25:38] because i preached emotions we said that

[2:25:45] we have need of the dove

[2:26:13] and then you see that everything goes
[2:26:15] well
[2:26:16] but the whole serpent is there
[2:26:18] me
[2:26:45] they didn't say that to us for
[2:26:46] forgiveness
[2:26:59] because the serpent is still inside

[2:27:39] about every century and got to the
[2:27:41] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:27:42] on the facility he forgives us so easily
[2:27:47] nothing wrong is in him
[2:27:50] he does not hold the strike a
[2:27:52] anger against anybody
[2:27:56] he like to see others to be blessed
[2:27:59] he prays if they prefer that will never
