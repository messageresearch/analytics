opportunity to see again their family members opportunity they reward their family they are accidents all over the places and things yeah but we thank god for his protection in remembrance of protection we did really it was a quick travel voyage and uh things did not work the way we planned so we end up doing a lot of travels between our friends and the belgium finish and california and that really made us very very tired of fatigue and i have also made a commitment that last sunday i had to preach it somewhere in paris but i did it but it was not easy with the travel we have to do it but by god grace it was done and uh many brothers and sisters ever signed their great things to you a book would affect yourself and um we thank god for traveling mercies our and i thank also brother branham for taking the services foreign [Applause] but it's not an easy job facile it takes a lot of sacrifices even for my ministers to prepare supplements he came from work i believe uh working saturday until a sunday morning travail sometimes personally i feel very very bad to ask the local ministers to bring the word the former oceania maldives knowing what they go through some they don't sleep all night certainly so tonight i felt also myself very very tired and i could not bring the word professor i really wanted to rest my mind so tonight we are going to listen to the message a sermon that we have already listened here essentially on the rapture level and uh god has placed that in my heart j a places knowing the time we are going through connie sanlletta mannequins and passes uh brother sisters further sir we are going through a very very challenging time no trending you have to look around the world regardless to see what is taking place around the world the regard you will see things are moving in a way that uh you cannot understand us shows as you stay at the same spot you don't see what is taking place around the world you will say well it's just the normal routine normal but the way things used to be it's no longer the way it's going to be the world was a shaken without the pandemic le monde tesla pandemi and i'm telling you many things are taking place but all that is taking place it's just a response that the bride has to pay attention to reports there are many things when i was uh in the first in belgium pastor muy i was in the hospital and i was supposed to meet him in and i have to go back to where they are in normandy to visit him to the visible visit but to get into the hospital in the river they require the test existed test in france now advancement now even to go eat at the restaurant memphis restaurant they call it the pass is a personal pass you have to have a proof that you have been vaccinated and there were many groups of people trying to uh stand against the government position he have a and i'm pretty much sure it's going to expand to the entire world asia is even if you are a citizen memphis vosseter american they require the pcr test in demand to your letter and in some countries i heard like canada antonio complete canada they are not requiring a test but they are looking for a full vaccination in norman publishing the test my research is on complete my vaccine but in all of this medium to cc there is a message behind the message there they squeeze the depression the oppression is coming it can tend to veneer that's why i feel like we have to be completely prepared what happens and the things that are taking place we have to have the spiritual discernment spiritual it's no longer a matter of signs since nepean problem descending but it's a matter of preparation satan problem the preparation how do you prepare yourself so tonight says we are going to listen to a message that was preached to us here by brother ben schamel if the projection is ready we can listen to that sermon uh i think it's going to be a blessing for each one of you tonight examples try to understand the content popular confrontation and that's the bottom line the rapture level may god richly bless you forever i'm happy to see sister beatrice boson and uh nicole bosunga sylvie bosunga and the remaining of the busungas [Applause] with the mask you have to look closely to make sure that i know the people our berkley mask is on party oh show me so we can rely amen we just praise the lord we thank you brother for the opportunity to speak with you this morning appreciate the songs and musicians thank you and if you have your scriptures i'd like to just kind of dive into the word right away and i'm still young i get nervous so if i'm going too fast just raise your hand and say slow down slow down amen if you would uh turn with me in your scriptures to romans chapter 8. about a rapture time for the bride amen something that we can really look forward to yeah i was listening to a message this morning and brother branham was talking about how many people don't like talking about the end times it's a happy and it reads like this there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit is life in christ jesus for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from sin free from the law of sin and death and what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit i thank you like jesus for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for it to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal in mind is imminent to because the carnal in mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that that spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his mess who would have made on his faith and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raiseth up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you is silly more i beat them lord we come before you this morning but your not just to prove to other people that we're good message believers but lord we've gathered ourselves together today lord that purpose is to grow closer to you the minister's job is to help the christians to grow closer to you and those that aren't christians to make them so ashamed of themselves that's why we're here this morning lord we've read your word we just asked that you would open it to us this morning lord that we wouldn't be blind as the denominations but that we might be able to see you through our scriptures that we wouldn't be reading it as a newspaper we might be able to read these scriptures as they pertain to us today we ask all these things in jesus christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated again we just want to say thank you to brother fosten for the opportunity to come we understand that he's going to a funeral out in new york or somewhere out there but as the scriptures say we don't weep as others that weep because we know that there will be a resurrection for the believers amen amen so here we are a couple days into 2021 many of us are very thankful that 2020 is in the past year in the year of forgetfulness hey man it was a hard year for me many people when it becomes midnight on january 1. we hear that saying new year new me or as we hear this saying turn a new leaf write we don't want to be the but now we have our our new name of jesus christ amen praise the lord he just ran away so we're not looking for just a new leaf we're looking for a new life amen praise the lord so how will that change come on the scripture says that change will come by his spirit amen and we know that there is a rapture coming for his church and we know that brother branham talks about that change the rapture amen and if that rapture comes then how do we know that we will not miss that right amen amen so brother branham talks uh lots and lots about the seventh church and uh he says in the message rapture in uh december fourth sixty-five so he says now we're living in the seventh church and when the bible said that the seventh church age the city please when the messenger of that 7th church age begins to sound his message that the mysteries of all these things that's been twisted down through the age would be revealed in that time here we see it the son of man coming among his people and doing just exactly confirming his message as he said he would do it and we find it in this last stage amen so we know that that satan can see where where we are satan satan knows that his time is drawing sure so he's doing everything he can to distract us he's doing everything he can to try to draw you away from gatherings last year was such a great example the government shutting down churches saying you can't gather together in the name of in the presence of the lord it's just a distraction from satan we see many churches across the land even message churches they had to shut down coming down through the seven churches because my scripture says it doesn't say uh uh don't come to church or just listening to tapes at home so we should be excited for those prayer meetings [Music] praise the lord do we believe that who got quiet there for a second amen praise the lord he just started away so god so satan can see what god is doing and he will try to distract us allah said satan people see that's satan trying to separate creating division amen brother branham says in the uh flashing red light of his coming we walk across the street and start talking to a neighbor but then you see the flashing red lights and that arm begins to come down what do you know it's a sign [Music] is amen this is 63 june 20 23rd uh says but all of a sudden we see something happen [Music] and when the arm goes down and the light begins to flash you better throw that bag of peanuts down i love the vegetables you stop you're talking you grab your suitcase and you get ready or you're gonna be left behind cause he's just stopping locally for a few moments amen if we flip over to our scriptures he goes to luke chapter 17. and he starts with uh verse 26 sacramento verse 7 says and this is jesus speaking and he says as it as it was in the days of noah eddie so shall it be also in the days of the son of man and sincerely and the flood came and destroyed them all but that same day that lot was went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and it destroyed them all here we go verse 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed the seventh age lucita amen amen so it took us a profit to show us we're in the seventh age hello city uh university we know before he sends amen the prophet then takes us down to matthew 24. and uh he talks about how the disciples asked jesus three questions and it's incredible to me that when you are listening to the message when he's going through the scriptures he says the disciples asked him three questions and jesus answered their three questions in order but when you go back and you read the scriptures you read verse three where they ask the questions and then he jumps all the way to verse 32. jesus is answering all these questions you see the denominations are blinded to those things so i figured [Music] he knew that you would see the flashing lights and you would drop those peanuts of the world they showed them all and you would run to the stage my lord is coming and i am here ready prepare to go and as he jesus sat at the mount of olives the disciples came into him privately saying number one tell us when these things shall be the new conception three questions even at we've already seen israel gathered in her homeland we see that the sleeping giant of russia getting ready the king of the north getting preparing herself brother branham talks about god has a bride and she's getting herself ready satan also has a bride he's getting herself ready so when you see that other bride is getting herself so shall also the coming of the son of man be and sister and then the prophet takes us all the way back to genesis chapter 6 if you want to go through these uh message by message a couple of messages that i would recommend is the rapture the flashing red light of his comments the marriage uh uh of the lamb uh the and the secret going away of the church if you listen to all of those just kind of one after the others so incredible because brother branham just points out where we are today the signs of where we are this was 50 years ago and so look at where we are and then the president gets assassinated the catholic president we've got a so-called goddess as vice president in don't fear communism okay so now we see rome the catholic church making a deal with the jews and then they're going to renege see satan thinks he is because my scripture [Music] so there must be obstacles so that's the bride can become overcomers that's true what does james say uh praise the lord so brother branham takes us back to genesis chapter 6 and he says and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them and the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and uh let's go to verse 4. and there were giants in the earth in those days when the sons of god came into the daughters of men did you feel they knew that they bore children the same became mighty men but yet god made sure [Music] why would god say these three or four things because he knew that you saw who would be looking for the sign of his coming so he had to bring a prophet to bring us back to the scriptures then you can know that your redemption is nice i'm sorry so brother branham goes through these things he says when man began to multiply [Music] it's scientific we're multiplying like never mankind is duplicating at a rate you mentioned just as it was in the days of november it's so simple and the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair brother the girls in high schools these days they they can't compare uh to the girls in just school the the women just keep getting prettier and prettier and the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of god sorry the goddess of man is defeated and brother branham says that's not taking them as a wife that's just living with them without the marriage just look at america now just look at the world now that it's so accepted now it's starting to be come to the place is where people don't even think it's important to get married i've heard people tell me what's the point of getting married you can live together we've been so impressed you can raise the family why get married just as it was in the days of noah amen just exactly exactly more amen so multiplying upon the earth women getting prettier and prettier and the sexual uncleanness [Music] he says now something else i had wrote down he said as it was in the days of sodom city remember that men had misused women in such a way until the natural act of life was no more desire he says oh it's awful to say this from from the platform but if there ever was truth it ought to go from here on the increase everywhere to until the desire of it is falling fastly i'll say within another 10 or 15 years it's the way it's increasingly done you'll probably go to jail if you go down to downtown denver and start preaching against it is we must oh no oh no no no no no no there's young people today dealing with homosexual spirits inside the churches and if you don't preach against it it will overcome brother branham says weak pulpits that's the problem juvenile delinquency is we're getting the people nervous in the congregation [Music] we need to forget what people think closer to him amen so we see as it was in the days of noah and we can see ourselves in that day and so it was in the days of noah there was also an enoch enoch was the seventh from adam and now to the city amen you can read that in genesis 5 and 6. that the six generations before generation had all died tomorrow there was only one left yeah the dentist the seventh from adams a perfect type of the church agency that the six ages before they all died [Music] is he says now it's the seventh age that takes the rapture all the other six died but enoch was translated [Music] he was not found [Music] oh this is which we are bearing record of that age amen so can we all agree we're in the seventh church and sometimes amen it took a profit to say that this this translation this rapture for the bride the rapture will only be for the british but you must realize that it's it's the bride that gets herself ready [Music] if we think of a marriage and and the bride is is waiting in anticipation for that wedding well i'll show up oh as soon as it starts no that's what everybody else is doing as soon as i see the the the ceremony starts then i'll get myself ready then it'll be too late that's what our prophet kept pointing out you must see the signs you must see that flashing red light before the train is there because if you wait till the the sight that the literal train is there then by the time you run across the street to the entrance it's gone he's going to come in the in the twinkling of an eye she doesn't wait for the preacher to get ready and i don't buy him for somebody else she's got the dress picked out [Music] she can't wait to get dressed in that dress the metal said in anticipation and when that wedding day comes she will make sure that she is ready amen that's what we're doing today revelations 19. and uh verse 6. and i heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters a community console and as the voice of many thunderings they coming for default and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come in and his wife have made herself ready and to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen fella is the righteousness of the saints and he sayeth unto me blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb now i want to i'm going to get here in a second are they which are called into the marriage supper okay and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god so who brought this message to them let's find out and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not immediate affair for i am thy fellow servant brethren for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy so we see it wasn't god in his flesh that was telling john so here's our messenger in revelation telling us blessed are they which are called under the marriage suffering blessed is the bride amen amen but we can uh can look back in in uh matthew 25. and he gives a parable of the 10 virgins you must have oil breathe there's the story of that young man from chicago he comes here to colorado up in the mountains what was he doing he was looking for a bride were there not girls in chicago oh yeah there were where you have it but that wasn't what he was looking for they had been denominated already so he came to this age look i love him you don't see it goes way up in the mountains and what does he find a bunch of the other girls just like they were in chicago chicago [Music] [Music] shared the same name somebody that had the characteristics that he was looking for amen amen but she was doing all the dirty work visited so he comes and and he says i will be back in a year all those floors that she's washing all of those [Music] the two becoming one ah amen do we believe that yeah i'll try to move on here pretty quickly all right so we know we're in the seventh age you know there's a rapture coming yeah all right let's talk about taking the rapture first thessalonians chapter 4. verse 13 it says but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others that have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him arose from the dead it created a resurrection in fact let's let's let's flip there real quick and we'll read it matthew 27 my juvenile and it says jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earthquake and the earth did quake and the rocks and many bodies of the saints which slap arose and they came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many people so they've already resurrected brother branham said that they went with him with with jesus in that rapture okay so here we are in first thessalonians and uh verse 14. for if we believe that jesus died and rose again so them which sleep in jesus will god bring with him so he's already seen it once and he knows it's going to happen again for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the lord jesus christ shall not prevent okay says that word prevent means it yeah for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout listen with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then hello we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord [Music] that phrase to be caught up it means to cease or to carry off by force it's to claim as one's self eagerly to claim for oneself so that means god is going to come and snatch and if you wouldn't have specifically called lazarus it's incredible that the prophet can can pull these things old testament new testament so we remember what happened about lazarus we could preach a sermon upon sermon about lazarus it's that [Music] the chapter before [Music] and here's those pharisees condemning it for another time but but jesus says in john 5 28. he says marvel not at this you see for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his isn't that interesting it doesn't say the graves shall hear his shout out scriptures are perfect every time and shall come forth and they that have done good and to the resurrection of life and they that have done evil until the resurrection of damnation sometimes we need to kind of slow down divine he says and we are living in that day praise be to god the revelation of the mystery of himself he says the rapture is what we're talking about it's only for the bride remember the bible said and the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years what amen hallelujah so we know there's going to be a rapture in this age i don't want you all to so if there's going to be a rapture how do we know we're going to be in that rapture it's not a guessing game god doesn't just uh i'll take this one just randomly uh god takes his own he's coming for a bride one that he loves one that will be flesh of his flesh here we go uh paragraph 93 of the rapture brother branham says so then how do we get into this body first corinthians 12. by one spirit we're all baptized into this body doesn't sell especially but they perform and said one holy spirit baptism doesn't sell by them that if you want to put that down first corinthians 12 13 civil rights amen which he was the word seed brings the seed to life do you get it if that life is laying in the seed then the baptism of the holy spirit it is bound to bring that seed light fox so we can imagine those seven church ages coming up first it's two blades uh poking out of the ground i see you see this monster solo and then it starts to grow we have the stock alonso [Music] and then the shock the covering amen and then we then then we can see the seedlings let's go back and read first corinthians 12 13. and then we'll uh we'll have one more uh one more quote and then we'll try to wrap up first corinthians 12 and 13. for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bombed or free and have been made to drink into one spirit now if you're just reading this bible with no profit and we've been made to drink into one spirit what is he talking about he's talking about that gene of god inside his bride needs the holy spirit water in hebrew it's baptizo and there's two words that are very similar baptizo is not to the clearest example that shows the meaning of baptism is actually from a greek poet and physician um his name was uh nikander and physicians he lived about 200 years before christ and he actually wrote a recipe for pickles and he uses both of these words in that recipe just so we can understand what the word baptized is so nikender says in order to make a pickle the vegetable should first be dipped as in bapto vegetable into boiling water and then it must be baptized as in baptism in the vinegar solution both of these verbs concern immersing the vegetables in a solution the vegetable is is the act of baptizing the vegetables that produces a permanent change so when it's used in the new testament the word often refers to a a union so for example mark 16-16 christ is saying it's more it's it's it's more than just an intellectual ascent a christian in fact there's all kinds of pickles there's sweet pickles there's dill pickles right we're making a pickle you have to start with a cucumber you have to boil that cucumber so you dip that cucumber in the boiling water then you take the cucumber out i love resorting is it a pickle especially it's a soggy cucumber right so you pull it out it's the same that's what people are looking for with these new year's resolutions their nature hasn't been changed they're still a cucumber they're looking to [Music] [Music] so we've still got a cucumber it's boiled down it's a soggy cucumber brother brandon said you can have the holy spirit every day of your life and still go to hell [Music] but when you take that pickle who finished the coffee but it is now a pickle and then when you pull that out it's not like before when you pull it out it goes back to a cucumber no because once it's a pickle it's always a picture hallelujah our nature has been changed so once you're born a son of god there's no returning background his desires are changed so it's not he that believes and is baptized dipped in water but is he that is baptized completely changed we realize we're not covered by jesus's blood but we have jesus's blood flowing within us but it's just that it's there on the inside so when jesus goes up in the rapture we are a part of him because his life is in us so we can't help but take the response [Music] if but when the body moves the entirety of the body [Music] if our arm is cut off and brother branham says and and another arm is put on a mechanical arm that arm is not a part of us the citrus tree and and how it produces oranges but you can graft in other fruits and what does the bible say buy their fruits you shall know now if that branch is said let's say the lemon branch puts off a sub branch it is so it doesn't matter if you're first baptist oh second baptist design baptista southern baptist uh batista but if that tree ever puts forth a new branch if that tree ever puts forth a new branch it will produce the original fruits and in the last days there shall be a church rise up and it will write another book of acts just like it was in the beginning amen hallelujah that original life praise the lord so we've been completely changed we're not covered by his name this is some complete motion but his blood now flows through us we are a part of him amen we can't miss that rapture not anointed rapture 148. and when it comes to an oh glory i got the anointing [Music] and he says and it's the genuine anointing hello but that didn't have nothing to do with this issue inside alan unless that's god's seed his gene from the beginning predestinated [Music] amen amen so it must be god's life living in us inside but it is now christ living in us everything that little cousin that was waiting for that that man from chicago to come back all those sisters were always making fun of her oh he's just like all these other guys he's just making fun it didn't matter how long he was she was getting herself ready she was getting herself dressed as sabi he should be here any moment because this is the day that the lord's coming so should his church [Music] [Music] amanda we believe that this morning let's all stand up [Applause] i just thank god for his message because just reading through the scriptures there's no way that we would understand what he's telling us amen amen i think this was a blessing to us tonight it's not about the signs producing we have been taught about science those are interesting yesterday but now it's not about knowledge of the science nationally [Music] in the light of all the signs that you know the what is your response she goes to reports what how are you ready they can manipulate how are you making yourself ready god is not going to ask jenny demanded her how much you know conveying to say but he's looking at how much you are how already you are evilly regardless that pray natural things the show's not your head are the reflection of the spiritual so in reflection they show spiritual that cousin sikuzela that cousin said cuzinda was making herself ready but the rest of the people were making fun melee restaurants we have to accept it they won't accept it we have to accept people to make fun of us particularly they know but as long as you know what you are doing thank you for connecting this is what is more important is important and the time we are living also there are a lot of distractions distraction satan knows that his time is up satan he doesn't want to go to hell by himself he never laid an affair a remember that's why we see the advance in technology guarantee technology you don't need to go buy a ticket to go watch a movie into the barbecue in dallas but everything is ready in your hands in my two shows in dante man but the question is are you ready to pray so that was a message in the preparation says italian message we are going to talk about [Music] the seal of god palestine the mark of the beast la marque de la bed and to make sure that we are sealed with the real seal not what we see or the church is on fire by second of all because people are holding on the floor asking this brother we are experiencing pentecost or friends and trend of the experimental pantech if it's real baptism of the holy ghost he said 10 but then the the sentence period antique must be real god cannot seal you you join a paper fusela and they lose you tomorrow even better the
