[3:49] amen we just praise the lord you know
[3:52] you thank you brother fosten for the
[3:54] opportunity
[3:54] to speak with you this morning
[3:57] appreciate
[3:58] the songs and the musicians thank you
[4:01] character musicians
[4:02] and uh if you have your scriptures i'd
[4:04] like to just kind of dive into the
[4:06] the word right away
[4:11] and i'm still young i get nervous
[4:15] so if i'm going too fast just raise your
[4:18] hand and say
[4:18] slow down slow down
[4:24] amen if you would turn with me in your
[4:26] scriptures to romans
[4:27] chapter 8.
[4:31] we'll take a very familiar scripture to
[4:33] the message believers
[4:37] and we'll be talking about rapture
[4:50] i was listening to a message this
[4:52] morning
[4:54] and brother brandon was talking about
[4:55] how many people don't like talking about
[4:57] the end times
[5:01] to them it's something scary
[5:05] it's something that's unknown there's
[5:08] mysteries about it oh yeah
[5:10] for the bride it's a happy time
[5:15] we believe that this morning
[5:18] romans chapter 8. we're gonna read
[5:21] verses one through
[5:22] eleven and it reads like this
[5:27] there is therefore now no condemnation
[5:30] to them which are
[5:31] in christ jesus who walk not after the
[5:34] flesh
[5:34] but after the spirit
[5:48] for the love the spirit is life in
[5:50] christ jesus
[5:52] for the law of the spirit of life in
[5:54] christ jesus
[5:56] hath made me free from sin free from the
[5:59] law of sin
[6:00] and death
[6:07] and what the law could not do in that it
[6:11] was weak
[6:12] through the flesh god sending his own
[6:14] son
[6:15] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[6:17] sin
[6:18] condemned sin in the flesh
[6:32] i continued that the righteousness of
[6:36] the law
[6:36] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[6:40] after the flesh but after the spirit
[6:42] i thank you like jesus exists here
[6:45] completely unknown
[6:50] for they that are after the flesh do
[6:51] mind the things of the flesh
[6:53] but they that are after the spirit the
[6:55] things of the spirit
[6:57] song
[7:04] for to be carnally minded is death but
[7:07] to be spiritually minded is life and
[7:14] peace
[7:16] because the cardinal in mind is enmity
[7:18] to because the carnal in mind is enmity
[7:21] against god
[7:22] for it is not subject to the law of god
[7:24] neither indeed can be
[7:42] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[7:44] spirit
[7:46] if so be that that spirit of god dwell
[7:48] in you
[7:49] now if any man have not the spirit of
[7:51] christ he is none of his
[7:56] messiah
[8:10] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[8:13] because of sin
[8:14] but the spirit is life because of
[8:16] righteousness
[8:23] but if the spirit of him that raiseth up
[8:26] jesus from the dead
[8:27] dwell in you he that raised up christ
[8:31] from the dead
[8:32] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[8:35] his spirit that dwelleth
[8:36] in you is
[8:52] your gracious heavenly father lord we
[8:55] come before you this morning and once
[8:57] again
[8:59] lord just thanking you for your goodness
[9:01] and your mercy
[9:03] lord you look down and you see that
[9:05] we're all humans
[9:30] but lord we've gathered ourselves
[9:32] together today with a purpose
[9:42] the minister's job is to help the
[9:44] christians to go
[9:45] grow closer to you
[9:50] and those that aren't christians to make
[9:52] them so ashamed of themselves
[9:59] lord that's why we're here this morning
[10:02] lord
[10:26] we might be able to read these
[10:27] scriptures as they pertain to us today
[10:32] we ask all these things in jesus
[10:33] christ's name in the morning
[10:36] amen amen amen you may be seated
[10:40] again we just want to say thank you to
[10:41] brother fosten for the opportunity to
[10:44] come
[10:47] we understand that he's uh going to a
[10:50] funeral out in new york or somewhere out
[10:51] there
[10:55] but as the scriptures say we don't weep
[10:57] as others that weep
[11:08] amen so here we are a couple days into
[11:11] 2021 oh newborns
[11:15] many of us are very thankful that 2020
[11:18] is in the past
[11:21] year in the year of forgetfulness
[11:26] amen it was a hard year for many i lost
[11:29] many people when it becomes midnight on
[11:32] january 1.
[11:35] we hear that saying new year new me
[11:40] or as we
[12:19] but now we have our our new name of
[12:21] jesus christ
[12:28] [Music]
[12:37] the scripture says that change will come
[12:39] by his spirit
[12:44] amen and we know that there is a rapture
[12:46] coming for his church
[12:50] and we know that brother branham talks
[12:51] about that change
[12:54] that rapture will come in the seventh
[12:58] age
[13:01] i want to talk about three main points
[13:03] this morning
[13:18] so
[13:33] amen amen so brother branham talks uh
[13:36] lots and lots about the seventh church
[13:42] and uh he says in the message rapture he
[13:45] don't miss out
[13:46] on level in december 4 65.
[13:52] so he says now we're living in the
[13:54] seventh church
[13:58] and when the bible said that the seventh
[14:01] church
[14:02] age the city of the legalized when the
[14:03] messenger of that seventh church age
[14:06] begins to sound his message economy is
[14:08] such a system that actually
[14:11] that the mysteries of all these things
[14:13] that's been twisted up
[14:26] the son of man coming among his people
[14:31] and doing just exactly
[14:35] confirming his message as he said he
[14:38] would do
[14:39] it and we find it in this last stage
[14:45] amen so we know that that satan can see
[14:47] where where we are
[14:50] satan satan knows that his time is
[14:52] drawing sure
[14:54] so he's doing everything he can distract
[14:57] us
[14:59] he's doing everything he can to try to
[15:01] draw you away from galaxies
[15:05] last year was such a great example
[15:09] the government shutting down churches
[15:13] saying you can't gather together in the
[15:14] name of the lord
[15:16] yeah and they can do it under the facade
[15:18] of a virus
[15:21] safety of it all you can't come to
[15:24] church
[15:34] we see many churches across the land
[15:38] even message
[15:51] because there was seed that was thrown
[15:53] out
[15:54] some fell on rocks
[15:59] fell on good grief we believe that we
[16:02] have good grief
[16:04] prepared for us even from the beginning
[16:20] don't come to church sanji pani vine
[16:22] pali gliso or just listening to
[16:24] tapes at home or by yourself
[16:29] but it says draw yourselves forsake not
[16:31] the assembling together
[16:33] more so as you see
[16:55] who got quiet there for a second
[16:58] amen praise the lord did you start away
[17:02] so god so satan can see what god is
[17:04] doing and he will try to distract us
[17:09] oh we see all the political unrest
[17:11] that's going on right now
[17:13] satan trying to divide believers
[17:16] financially
[17:43] amen brother branham says in the uh
[17:45] flashing red light of his coming
[17:47] up he talks about how we're getting
[17:50] ready to get on a train
[17:58] we don't know
[18:11] buy a bag of peanuts
[18:39] he said when you see that flashing red
[18:41] light when you see that arm coming
[18:44] down then you know that the train is in
[18:47] the block
[18:49] you know that he is close and he'll be
[18:52] showing up
[18:54] not
[19:22] is
[19:37] but blessed are the messages
[19:40] amen you can find that in the scriptures
[19:43] foreign
[19:45] brother branham says this is 63 june 20
[19:49] 23rd uh
[20:03] and when the arm goes down and the light
[20:06] begins to flash
[20:09] okay
[20:12] he said what is it the train it's in the
[20:16] blocks
[20:18] though you can't
[20:28] [Music]
[20:32] train you better throw that bag of
[20:36] peanuts down
[20:37] i love the vegetables
[20:41] you grab your suitcase and you get ready
[20:45] or you're gonna be left
[21:14] and he starts with uh verse 26
[21:20] and this is jesus speaking it comes and
[21:22] he says as it
[21:23] as it was in the days of noah eddie
[21:27] so shall it be also in the days of the
[21:29] son of man
[21:33] they did eat they drank
[21:36] they married wives they were given in
[21:39] marriage
[21:40] until the day that noah entered into the
[21:42] ark
[22:18] even thus shall it be in the day when
[22:21] the son of man
[22:22] is revealed
[22:30] amen amen
[22:34] so it took us a profit to show us we're
[22:37] in the seventh age
[22:38] hello
[22:48] where god will show his prophets the
[22:50] things to come
[23:02] [Music]
[23:04] so without this message we wouldn't be
[23:05] able to look at what's happening around
[23:07] the world
[23:10] without this message we wouldn't be able
[23:12] to see that flashing red light
[23:16] amen the prophet then takes us down to
[23:18] matthew 24. our holy prophet news amen
[23:22] and he talks about how the disciples
[23:24] asked jesus three questions
[23:28] and it's incredible to me that when you
[23:32] are listening to the message
[23:34] when he's going through the scriptures
[23:37] he says the disciples asked him three
[23:39] questions
[23:41] and jesus answered their three questions
[23:43] in order
[23:45] but when you go back and you read the
[23:47] scriptures
[23:54] and then he jumps all the way to verse
[23:56] 32.
[23:58] jesus is answering all these questions
[24:02] you see the denominations are blinded to
[24:04] those things
[24:07] it shows but god sent a prophet to show
[24:09] us those things
[24:12] amen god's so merciful to us
[24:29] that's pretty exciting
[25:12] my lord is
[25:26] matthew 24 verse 3
[25:30] and as he jesus sat at the mount of
[25:32] olives
[25:35] the disciples came into him privately
[25:37] saying
[25:40] number one premier tell us when these
[25:43] things
[25:43] shall be dino constitutes number two
[25:47] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[25:52] and number three and of the end
[25:55] of the world three questions
[26:00] and then brother branham flips us all
[26:02] the way down
[26:04] to uh verse 32 oversight
[26:08] where jesus says now learn a parable of
[26:11] the fig trees
[26:14] and he says that israel is that fig
[26:18] amen when his branch is yet tender
[26:22] a
[26:33] [Music]
[26:46] this generation shall not pass
[26:50] tell those things be fulfilled
[26:54] we've already seen israel gathered in
[26:56] her homeland
[26:59] we see that the sleeping giant of russia
[27:00] getting ready
[27:04] the king of the no getting
[27:07] preparing herself brother branham talks
[27:10] about god has a bride
[27:13] and she's getting herself ready satan
[27:16] also has a bride satoshi
[27:18] is getting herself ready so when you see
[27:20] that other bride is getting herself
[27:23] you better watch it
[27:28] and he says verse 37
[27:32] but as in the days of noah
[27:35] no way so shall also the coming of the
[27:38] son of man be
[27:39] and sister and then the prophet takes us
[27:43] all the way back to
[27:44] genesis chapter six
[28:11] if you listen to all of those just kind
[28:13] of one after the other
[28:43] and then the president gets uh
[28:45] assassinated the catholic president
[28:48] he never finishes his turn it's almost
[28:50] as if god passed time
[28:53] and now here we are again today we've
[28:55] got a catholic presence we've got a
[28:58] so-called goddess
[28:59] as vice president
[29:03] and we have have the catholic church
[29:07] building up a business organization
[29:24] that the catholic church would be behind
[29:26] it all
[29:28] don't don't fear communism
[29:33] control the the money of the world
[29:37] the jews think they do they stay on the
[29:40] paper
[29:41] it is only rome has the goal
[29:44] i love that's true okay so now we see
[29:47] rome the catholic church
[29:50] making a deal with the jewish
[30:06] and what
[30:16] don't get distracted by all these things
[30:33] little does he know he's playing right
[30:35] into the hand
[30:36] [Music]
[30:38] because my scripture says that in the
[30:41] last days
[30:42] there shall be overcomers well if
[30:45] everything went smooth
[30:47] if everything went smoothly what would
[30:51] there be to overcome
[30:52] alone so there must be obstacles covered
[30:58] so that's the bride can become
[31:00] overcomers
[31:02] [Applause]
[31:23] so brother branham takes us back to
[31:24] genesis chapter 6
[31:28] and he says and it came to pass
[31:44] saw the daughters of men that they were
[31:46] fair violence
[31:49] and they took them wives of all which
[31:51] they chose
[31:56] and uh let's go to verse four oh hello
[31:59] and there were giants in the earth in
[32:01] those days
[32:04] and also after that when the sons of god
[32:07] came in and to the daughters of men
[32:09] did you feel they knew that they bore
[32:12] children
[32:13] unto them the same became
[32:16] mighty men since you feel like which
[32:19] were of all
[32:20] the jadiso men of renown
[32:24] now i want you to notice something
[32:26] remarkable
[32:39] was six chapters
[32:56] why would god say these three or four
[32:58] things
[33:02] because he knew that you saw who would
[33:05] be looking for the sign of his coming
[33:08] so he had
[33:19] when we start seeing the things
[33:21] happening here
[33:45] mankind is duplicating at a rate
[33:50] just as it was in the days of november
[33:51] just comes with you don't you know way
[33:53] it's so simple but yet it took a prophet
[33:56] to take us back to the world
[33:59] number one and the sons of god saw the
[34:03] daughters of men that they were fairly
[34:19] he said they can't hold a candle to the
[34:21] the the girls in high schools
[34:23] these days they they can't compare
[34:26] uh
[34:29] to the girls in in just school oh they
[34:31] feed them
[34:33] the women just keep getting prettier and
[34:35] prettier
[34:38] just as it was in the days of knowledge
[34:43] and it says in verse 4 and the sons of
[34:46] god came in
[34:48] unto the daughters of men
[34:52] when the sons of god
[34:56] came in unto the daughters of god
[35:00] are the daughters
[35:29] now it's starting to be come to the
[35:31] place
[35:33] where people don't even think it's
[35:34] important to get married
[35:40] i've heard people tell me what's the
[35:43] point of getting married
[35:45] you can live together with viva you can
[35:48] raise a family
[35:50] why get married
[35:54] just as it was in the days of noah
[36:05] amen so multiplying upon the earth
[36:10] women getting prettier and prettier
[36:13] and the sexual uncleanness
[36:17] [Music]
[36:18] brother branham says in uh paragraph 128
[36:21] of flashing red light
[36:23] of course
[36:26] he says now something else i had wrote
[36:28] down
[36:30] remember lot's two daughters
[36:33] yes we remember that down in the city of
[36:36] sodom
[36:38] jesus said here in luke 17
[36:42] he said as it was in the days of sodom
[36:46] remember that men had misused women in
[36:50] such a way
[36:52] jesus until the natural
[36:55] act of life was no more desired
[37:00] he says oh it's awful to say this from
[37:02] from the platform
[37:06] but if
[37:13] and it's so bad today
[37:16] tell there's tens of thousands times
[37:18] thousands of them
[37:33] because the natural use of human life
[37:38] to reproduce themselves upon the earth
[37:42] has been so mistreated
[37:46] and so gone on in the way it has
[38:16] you'll probably go to jail if you go
[38:17] down to downtown denver and start
[38:19] preaching against it
[38:29] doesn't the scripture say that what we
[38:30] call good will be they'll call bad
[38:34] bones it's not hate speech
[38:38] preaching against this love speech
[38:42] because love is correct
[39:07] there's young people today dealing with
[39:09] homosexual spirits
[39:11] inside message
[39:26] it's not juvenile
[39:40] we're getting the people nervous in the
[39:41] congregation
[39:47] and start preaching what god thinks
[39:50] it's his word anyways we're not here to
[39:53] preach what we think
[40:05] amen praise the lord
[40:11] amen so we see as it was in the days of
[40:14] noah
[40:14] in voyage
[40:18] and we can see ourselves in that day
[40:22] and so
[41:03] amen there's an enoch yeah and anoka
[41:05] enoch was the seventh from adam
[41:07] and now amen you can read that in
[41:11] genesis
[41:12] 5 and 6.
[41:15] that the six generations before
[41:21] [Music]
[41:32] ages before they
[41:35] all died in the denomination their
[41:38] message was preached
[41:40] and they denominated
[41:45] but this seventh age mess
[42:15] brother branham says in the rapture he
[42:18] says now it's the seventh age that takes
[42:19] the rapture
[42:23] all the other six died
[42:26] but enoch was translated
[42:41] all the rest of them don't hate them all
[42:44] he said but the
[42:45] end time bride will be
[42:48] called out the rapturing
[42:52] love more without death
[43:11] amen so can we all agree we're in the
[43:12] seventh church
[43:16] we're at the end times so there will be
[43:19] a rapture
[43:21] it's been promised amen
[43:24] so i
[43:36] amen i believe i'm looking at people
[43:46] [Music]
[43:52] amen it took a profit to say that
[43:56] this this translation this rapture
[44:02] for the bride the rapture will only be
[44:06] for the british
[44:16] and we'll get into this a little bit
[44:18] deeper
[44:20] from there but you must realize that
[44:24] it's it's the bride
[44:26] that gets herself ready
[44:31] if we think of a marriage
[44:34] and and the bride is is is waiting in
[44:37] anticipation for that wedding
[44:42] and the wedding day finally comes
[44:45] what does she do okay lay on the couch
[44:47] and yes
[44:59] as soon as i see the the the ceremony
[45:01] starts oh
[45:16] there because if you wait till the the
[45:19] side the
[45:20] the literal train is there then by the
[45:23] time you run across the street
[45:27] to the to the entrance it's gone along
[45:35] [Music]
[45:43] but the bride gets herself ready
[45:47] she doesn't wait for the preacher to get
[45:48] her ready
[45:51] for somebody else she's waiting
[45:56] she's got the dress picked out monsters
[46:26] verses and i heard as it were a great
[46:30] voice
[46:30] of a great multitude israel coming for
[46:33] din
[46:34] full numbers
[46:37] and the voice of many waters a community
[46:40] console
[46:41] and as the voice of many thunderings
[46:46] saying hallelujah hallelujah for the

[46:57] and give honor to him for the marriage
[47:01] of the lamb is come
[47:03] in and his wife have made herself ready
[47:07] it's a farm
[47:08] and to her it was granted
[47:12] that she should be arrayed in fine
[47:14] linens
[47:18] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[47:22] of the saints the son of jesus is their
[47:24] son and he sayeth unto me
[47:27] right blessed are they which are called
[47:31] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[47:36] still on
[48:04] that have already
[48:10] and he says unto me these are the true
[48:11] sayings of god
[48:15] so who brought this message to them
[48:18] let's find out
[48:28] and he said unto me see thou do it not.
[48:32] for i am thy fellow servants
[48:38] that have the testimony of jesus
[48:41] worship god for the testimony of
[48:45] jesus is the spirit
[49:15] amen amen
[49:18] but we can uh can look back in in
[49:21] matthew 25.
[49:25] and he gives a parable of the 10 virgins
[49:29] you must have oil
[49:36] there's the story of that young man from
[49:37] chicago
[49:40] he comes here to colorado up in the
[49:42] mountains
[49:44] what was he doing he was looking for a
[49:46] bride
[49:49] were there not girls in chicago oh yeah
[49:52] there were well
[49:54] but that wasn't what he was looking at
[50:10] a bunch of the other girls just like
[50:11] they were in chicago
[50:13] chicago but he found one
[50:19] she was doing all the slave labor
[50:23] she had the same last name brother
[50:24] branham said as those other five girls
[50:28] they were they were daughters of the
[50:29] manager
[50:31] [Music]
[50:33] they felt like they had part ownership
[50:35] of this big ranch yes
[50:37] [Music]
[50:47] [Music]
[51:05] there was someone that was living the
[51:07] life that christ wanted
[51:10] somebody that had the characteristics
[51:13] that he was looking for
[51:17] amen amen but she was doing all the
[51:19] dirty work mad visit to citra
[51:21] so he comes and and he says i will be
[51:24] back in a year
[51:27] did she quit washing the dishes
[51:31] did she quit doing the laundry
[51:34] to her it didn't
[51:47] a year from now enough
[52:01] where it says we will be heirs
[52:28] and i'll try to move on here pretty
[52:30] quickly
[52:33] all right so we know we're in the
[52:34] seventh page you know there's a rapture
[52:37] coming up
[52:39] all right let's talk about taking the
[52:40] rapture
[52:43] first thessalonians chapter 4.
[52:49] verse 13
[52:52] it says but i would not have you
[52:53] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[52:56] are asleep
[52:57] that ye sorrow not even as others that
[52:59] have no hopes
[53:06] for if we believe that jesus died and
[53:08] rose again
[53:09] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[53:13] will god bring with him
[53:22] now with this scripture keep in mind
[53:24] matthew 27.
[53:36] in fact let's let's let's flip there
[53:38] real quick and we'll read it oh don't
[53:40] know
[53:40] much
[53:44] [Music]
[53:52] and it says jesus when he had cried
[53:54] again with a loud voice yielded up the
[53:56] ghosts
[54:00] and behold the veil of the temple was
[54:02] rent and twain from the top to the
[54:04] bottom and the earthquake
[54:06] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[54:08] rent rant
[54:10] [Music]
[54:17] and this this gets very deep we won't
[54:19] we'll we'll just hit the highlight
[54:24] [Music]
[54:51] and the graves were opened
[54:54] and many bodies of the saints which
[54:57] slept
[54:57] arose
[55:01] and they came out of the graves after
[55:03] his resurrection
[55:19] that they went with him
[55:22] with with jesus in that rapture
[55:25] okay so here we are in uh first
[55:27] thessalonians
[55:30] and uh verse 14.
[55:33] for if we believe that jesus died and
[55:35] rose again
[55:38] even so them which sleep in jesus
[55:41] will god bring with him
[55:58] for this we say unto you by the word of
[56:00] the lord
[56:04] that we which are alive and remain
[56:07] until the coming of the lord jesus
[56:09] christ shall not prevent
[56:13] the brain says that word prevent means
[56:16] [Music]
[56:29] the resurrection of the dead and then
[56:32] the rapture yeah
[56:34] for the lord himself shall descend from
[56:36] heaven with a shout
[56:37] out with the voice of the archangel
[56:45] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[56:50] then hello we which are alive and remain
[56:54] shall be caught up together with them in
[56:57] the clouds
[57:00] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[57:04] we
[57:04] ever be with the lord
[57:09] oh that's me right there that's you
[57:12] right there
[57:13] in the scriptures thousands of years ago
[57:22] because he thought so much of you
[57:27] so that that that phrase to be caught up
[57:33] it means to cease
[57:37] or to carry off by force oh it's
[57:39] transported by fox
[57:41] it's to claim as one's self eagerly
[57:46] to claim for oneself eagerly
[57:52] so
[57:57] [Music]
[58:25] that's the same voice he said
[58:29] as that cried to lazarus lazarus
[58:36] and if he wouldn't have specifically
[58:38] called lazarus he's come forward
[58:41] then the resurrection would have
[58:42] happened back there
[58:45] it's that same voice
[58:48] it's incredible that the prophet can can
[58:51] pull these things
[58:52] old testament new testaments
[59:00] so we remember what happened about
[59:02] lazarus
[59:04] we could preach a sermon upon sermon
[59:06] about lazarus
[59:12] and how it was that same mary memory
[59:16] just after lazarus raises from the dead
[59:20] it's that same mary that washes jesus
[59:25] and here's all those pharisees
[59:29] if you actually knew what kind of woman
[59:43] and they're sitting there condemning
[59:48] [Music]
[59:55] [Music]
[59:58] christ raised her brother from the dead
[1:00:02] and here's those pharisees condemning
[1:00:04] him
[1:00:06] that's for another time
[1:00:09] but but jesus says in john 5 28
[1:00:13] maybe
[1:00:17] he says marvel not at this
[1:00:22] you see for the hour is coming
[1:00:27] in the which all that are in the graves
[1:00:30] shall
[1:00:30] hear his voice
[1:00:37] isn't that interesting it doesn't say
[1:00:38] the graves shall hear his
[1:00:40] shout our nest
[1:01:01] all right so we've got the the shout the
[1:01:03] voice and then the trumpet
[1:01:07] the trumpet is the feast of trumpets or
[1:01:09] the lamb supper brothers
[1:01:13] and brother branham says in that in same
[1:01:15] uh rapture message
[1:01:19] and he says and when the bride is being
[1:01:21] called out
[1:01:24] how are you going to put it out come on
[1:01:28] it's the revelation of the manifestation
[1:01:31] of the word
[1:01:32] made truth manifestations
[1:01:43] those are a lot of big words in there
[1:01:46] okay it's the revelation
[1:01:48] of the manifestation of this word
[1:01:53] made true modern events made clear by
[1:01:57] problems
[1:02:04] then the next paragraph or the next uh
[1:02:06] sentence
[1:02:08] he says and we are living in that day
[1:02:12] praise be to god the revelation
[1:02:17] of the mystery of himself
[1:02:20] he says indeed the rapture is what we're
[1:02:23] talking about
[1:02:25] it's only for the bride remember
[1:02:29] the bible said and the rest of the dead
[1:02:32] lived
[1:02:32] not for a thousand years
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] this great rapture if there's not a
[1:02:41] rapture friends where are we at
[1:02:45] what are we going to do because i don't
[1:02:47] fail what age are we living in
[1:02:51] what promise do we have there's
[1:02:54] going to be a rapture
[1:02:57] the bible says there will be only for
[1:03:00] the elective
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:13] amen hallelujah so we know there's going
[1:03:16] to be a rapture in this age
[1:03:19] it's so clear it's been prophesied
[1:03:23] not only the last 50 years
[1:03:27] but for thousands of years
[1:03:31] so if there's going to be a rapture how
[1:03:32] do we know we're going to be in that
[1:03:33] rapture
[1:03:38] it's not a guessing game
[1:03:42] god doesn't just i'll take this one
[1:03:45] just randomly god
[1:03:48] takes his own he's coming for a bride
[1:03:52] one that he loves one that will be flesh
[1:03:55] of his flesh
[1:04:10] corinthians 12 and quran tenduzo by
[1:04:13] one spirit were all baptized into this
[1:04:16] body
[1:04:17] doesn't sell espionage but disappear for
[1:04:20] women said quote
[1:04:21] one holy spirit baptism doesn't sell by
[1:04:23] them
[1:04:24] that if you want to put that down first
[1:04:26] corinthians 12 13.
[1:04:30] and by one spirit we're all baptized i
[1:04:33] want to say
[1:04:34] and the spirit of the life of christ
[1:04:40] amen which he was the word seed brings
[1:04:43] the seed to life
[1:04:50] do you get it if that life is laying in
[1:04:54] the seed
[1:04:57] then the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:04:59] upon it
[1:05:02] it is bound to bring that seed light see
[1:05:06] lava forks
[1:05:09] so we can imagine those seven church
[1:05:11] ages coming up
[1:05:14] first it's two blades uh poking out of
[1:05:16] the ground
[1:05:19] and then it starts to grow we have the
[1:05:22] stock
[1:05:23] alonso toothless castle
[1:05:28] tassel or the uh where the seed the
[1:05:32] where what that produces the seeds oh it
[1:05:34] is
[1:05:43] amen and then we then then we can see
[1:05:45] the seedlings
[1:05:48] let's go back and read first corinthians
[1:05:49] 12 13.
[1:05:52] and then we'll uh we'll have one more uh
[1:05:55] one more quote and then we'll we'll try
[1:05:56] to wrap it up
[1:06:00] first corinthians 12 and 13.
[1:06:04] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[1:06:07] into one body
[1:06:12] whether we be jews or gentiles
[1:06:16] whether we be
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:29] now if you're just reading this bible
[1:06:30] with no profit
[1:06:33] and we've been made to drink into one
[1:06:35] spirit and we want to say
[1:06:38] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:06:41] about that seed gene of god
[1:06:44] inside
[1:06:53] now here's here's something that i found
[1:06:54] very interesting
[1:06:57] look up that word baptized
[1:07:07] and there's two words that are very
[1:07:08] similar
[1:07:22] the clearest example that shows the
[1:07:23] meaning of baptism
[1:07:26] for example is actually uh from a greek
[1:07:30] poet and physician um his name was uh
[1:07:34] nikander says
[1:07:41] he lived about 200 years before christ
[1:07:45] and he actually wrote a recipe for
[1:07:48] pickles
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:51] and he uses both of these words in that
[1:07:53] recipe this would be
[1:08:03] says in order to make a pickle in the
[1:08:06] kendrick
[1:08:07] on the fells vegetable
[1:08:10] should first be dipped as in bapto
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:17] into boiling water
[1:08:22] and then it must be baptized as in
[1:08:24] baptism
[1:08:28] in the vinegar solution
[1:08:32] both of these verbs concern immersing
[1:08:34] the vegetables in a solution
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:09:04] so when it's used in the new testament
[1:09:05] the word often refers to
[1:09:07] a a union
[1:09:15] or an identification with christ
[1:09:18] amen do we believe that so for example
[1:09:21] mark 16 16.
[1:09:23] for example he that believes and is
[1:09:26] baptized
[1:09:27] shall be saved christ is saying it's
[1:09:30] more
[1:09:31] it's it's it's more than just an
[1:09:33] intellectual ascent
[1:09:35] chris intellectual
[1:09:38] but it's a union with him
[1:09:42] okay so we have a cucumber alonso
[1:09:45] who here likes pickles there's all kinds
[1:09:48] of pickles there's sweet pickles there's
[1:09:49] dill pickles
[1:09:50] right we're making a pickles you have to
[1:09:53] start with a cucumber
[1:09:56] you have to boil that cucumber
[1:10:00] so you dip that cucumber
[1:10:04] in the boiling water
[1:10:07] then you take the cucumber out i love
[1:10:10] recipe
[1:10:11] is it a pickle especially this is not
[1:10:14] it's
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:43] changed they're still a cucumber
[1:10:46] they're looking to be dipped in water
[1:10:50] thinking that they'll be changed but the
[1:10:53] problem is their nature has not been
[1:10:55] changed
[1:11:11] amen are you with me so we've still got
[1:11:14] a cucumber it's boiled down
[1:11:17] it's a soggy cucumber
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:21] brother brandon said you can have the
[1:11:23] holy spirit every day of your life and
[1:11:25] still go to health
[1:11:30] statements
[1:11:34] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:11:36] about an anointing
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:48] but it's not a change
[1:12:03] the nature of that cucumber begins to
[1:12:06] change
[1:12:20] it goes back to a cucumber
[1:12:33] so once you're born a son of god
[1:13:00] you can't become a cucumber
[1:13:15] his nature has changed
[1:13:28] so baptized means completely
[1:13:34] so it's not he that believes and is
[1:13:36] baptized dipped in water
[1:13:40] but it's here that is baptized
[1:13:42] completely changed
[1:13:44] but is a complete
[1:13:52] but we have jesus's blood flowing within
[1:13:55] us
[1:13:58] is
[1:14:11] so we can't help but take the
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:33] but when the body moves the entirety of
[1:14:38] the body
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:14:56] that arm is not a part of us
[1:15:00] it's attached to us
[1:15:03] so it can get the benefits of us
[1:15:08] but it's still not
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:20] and and how it produces oranges
[1:15:24] but you can graft in other fruits
[1:15:28] you see these denominations are grafting
[1:15:30] in to this fruit
[1:15:31] everywhere
[1:15:34] i lost v but it is not producing the
[1:15:38] same fruit
[1:15:41] and what does the bible say by their
[1:15:42] fruits
[1:15:45] now if that branch let's say the lemon
[1:15:48] branch
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:59] so it doesn't matter if you're first
[1:16:01] baptist oh science facility
[1:16:03] second baptist design baptista
[1:16:17] but if that tree ever puts forth a new
[1:16:19] branch
[1:16:22] if that tree ever puts forth a new
[1:16:24] branch
[1:16:26] it will produce the original fruits
[1:16:31] and in the last days there shall be a
[1:16:33] church rise up
[1:16:37] and it will write another book of acts
[1:16:40] just like it was in the beginning
[1:16:44] amen hallelujah that
[1:16:50] praise the lord so we've been completely
[1:16:53] changed we're not covered by his name
[1:16:54] this is some complete motion
[1:16:57] but his blood now flows through us
[1:17:10] but you must be filled with the holy
[1:17:13] spirit
[1:17:36] and when it comes to an oh glory i got
[1:17:38] the anointing
[1:17:41] oh glory oh god just rewind and he says
[1:17:44] and it's the genuine anointing
[1:17:48] remember
[1:17:52] and he prophesied so did balaam have it
[1:17:56] hello
[1:18:07] unless that's god's seed
[1:18:22] amen amen so it must be
[1:18:25] god's life living in us
[1:18:28] inside us now you can say to that
[1:18:32] mountain be moved
[1:18:35] now you can have that thing why because
[1:18:38] it's not us that's difficult
[1:18:40] but it is now christ living in us
[1:18:45] nothing in our fleshly ability
[1:18:50] but it is christ in us everything
[1:19:21] so we're looking for that wedding
[1:19:25] that little cousin that was waiting for
[1:19:27] that that man from chicago to come back
[1:19:33] all those sisters were always making fun
[1:19:34] of her
[1:19:36] oh he's just like all these other guys
[1:19:38] he's just making fun of him
[1:19:41] you're not pretty enough
[1:19:44] what did she do make us cafe she kept
[1:19:46] getting herself ready
[1:19:54] she was getting herself ready she was
[1:19:58] getting herself dressed
[1:19:59] as sabi he should be here any moment
[1:20:12] we should be getting ourselves ready
[1:20:13] looking for that wrap up
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:29] who's coming out
[1:20:44] we must get into christ
[1:20:48] amanda we believe that this morning
[1:20:52] let's all stand up
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:01] i just thank god for his message
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:05] because just reading through the
[1:21:06] scriptures there's no way that we would
[1:21:08] understand
[1:21:09] what he's telling us
[1:21:12] but his brother branham gave the
[1:21:14] illustration
[1:21:16] when he would write letters to his wife
[1:21:20] and when she would write letters back to
[1:21:22] him
[1:21:24] he said i can see these words
[1:21:40] between the lines
[1:21:54] young people that didn't live with
[1:21:55] brother brown
[1:21:57] we don't have to read this message as it
[1:21:59] was yesterday
[1:22:01] in the 40s 50s 60s so we can apply it to
[1:22:05] 2021
[1:22:08] because we
[1:22:24] how blessed we are amen
[1:22:27] amen let's let's bow our heads
[1:22:31] dear gracious heavenly father because
[1:22:33] you've passed our days lord we just come
[1:22:35] before you once again
[1:22:47] lord when we look at ourselves we just
[1:22:49] see faults and failures
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:23:02] lord and the prophet told us what
[1:23:03] justified men
[1:23:17] justified means that we've never done it
