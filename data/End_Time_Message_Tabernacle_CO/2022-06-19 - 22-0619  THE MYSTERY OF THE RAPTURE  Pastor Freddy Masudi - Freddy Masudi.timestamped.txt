[0:10] lord this morning
[0:12] amazing
[0:14] it is certainly a great honor and
[0:16] privilege to serve the lord this

[0:21] amen
[0:23] so i want to welcome our visitor sister
[0:27] santa

[0:43] amen
[0:44] i
[0:45] also want to
[0:48] let you know that this coming wednesday
[0:50] there will be no service as we said
[0:56] europe
[0:58] and right after the service today we are
[1:01] going to pack
[1:02] all the chairs uh just a pressure
[1:05] service
[1:06] to the
[1:07] chassis
[1:08] according to the leadership of guidance
[1:10] of brother caleb
[1:14] so that starting tomorrow
[1:16] the painter could start painting the
[1:19] sanctuary
[1:21] uh
[1:25] so we will resume this service god
[1:27] willing on friday
[1:34] i think uh with uh pastor robert
[1:37] from france
[1:53] i would like that uh everyone to give
[1:55] already their
[1:57] proposals and the budget to brother
[2:00] richard for
[2:02] the compilation of everything
[2:06] contributions suggestions no no no i'm
[2:09] talking about their proposals
[2:12] their proposition the different
[2:14] commissions the chat commission
[2:17] to give what they come up with budget
[2:21] and
[2:22] what they want to do
[2:28] this way we will give the coordination
[2:31] enough time to finish everything and
[2:42] and also since
[2:43] we are talking about
[2:45] registration for the banquet i think it
[2:48] at this time it has been closed
[2:59] i think uh
[3:01] emanuel is doing the final count this
[3:04] way we will know how many people will be
[3:06] there for the food
[3:08] emmanuel
[3:14] this way will help with uh budgeting of
[3:17] the rest of this stuff
[3:22] the rest of the seeking affair amen
[3:25] and also you know doing all these the
[3:28] things painting food lodging all the
[3:31] things it costs money
[3:38] if
[3:40] you can bring your contribution it's
[3:42] going to be very very helpful because
[3:46] the cost is very very high
[3:50] contributions
[3:54] and uh that's it
[3:56] so today is a special day
[4:00] happy father's day bonfire de pere
[4:04] [Applause]
[4:05] [Music]
[4:10] we want to thank god for all the fathers
[4:16] and want to remind the children that
[4:20] you have to love your father
[4:26] because the bible says if you can open
[4:29] with me for a minute
[4:34] proverbs chapter 1
[4:38] verse 8.
[4:41] i want the children to pay close
[4:43] attention to the scripture
[4:48] because this is where your prosperity
[4:51] dwell
[4:55] the bible said proverb 1 8.
[5:00] my son hear the instruction of thy
[5:04] father
[5:08] and forsake not the law of thy mother
[5:15] next verse
[5:17] for there shall be an ornament of grace
[5:20] unto thy head and chains about thy neck
[5:29] and i'm not talking only about the
[5:31] little children generally personally
[5:34] but all of us we are children of god
[5:38] founded you and if you have a living
[5:40] biological father
[5:44] an uncle an uncle etc
[5:48] this scripture also applies to us
[5:53] son listen to the instruction of thy
[5:56] father
[5:59] the bible never said son give your
[6:02] instruction to your father
[6:07] but you have to listen to the
[6:10] instructions of thy father
[6:15] the devil who is turning the thing
[6:17] upside down
[6:31] and also the same way to the
[6:32] congregation
[6:35] don't let your ears become so high
[6:38] neglect
[6:41] and where you cannot listen to anything
[6:44] a person when you start believing i'm on
[6:46] the top comfort pancakes you see what
[6:48] they should do that's a sign that sooner
[6:51] you are going to fall down
[6:54] god resists the proud resistance
[6:57] give grace to the house
[7:01] amen amen and give you another scripture
[7:05] ephesians chapter six ephesians
[7:08] four verse one about you the premier
[7:10] university oh good to see you brother
[7:12] just mokito

[7:22] verse one said verses
[7:26] this is a father's day si si
[7:30] and we want to remind the people
[7:34] the value of a father la value of the
[7:37] emperor
[7:38] and the father also hello perusia must
[7:41] know their own
[7:42] responsibility what survivor sees a
[7:44] proper responsibility why god made me a
[7:46] father
[7:47] my hundred years my god gave me children
[7:49] look what you might donate is
[7:50] unfortunate there is a purpose
[7:52] amen amen and the main purpose for the
[7:55] father
[7:57] for empire is to lead your children to
[8:00] salvation second season
[8:04] you can close them
[8:07] close to them
[8:10] close
[8:25] if they don't have christ sin not by
[8:27] christians you have not done much
[8:29] faith
[8:30] so that make us
[8:32] give us a big responsibility

[10:51] abstain

[10:58] but you are going to have a good
[10:59] remembrance of at least something good
[11:02] he has done for you
[11:06] and this is how god wants us to have a
[11:09] heart like that
[11:13] do something good to somebody when that

[29:45] ask andrew um
[29:47] because one day we will remember
[29:50] uh my personal mo
[29:52] personally
[29:59] [Music]
[30:05] i find that you're a very good church
[30:08] nancy grant
[30:10] in this great country
[30:12] open for
[30:14] certain
[30:16] zeglez refrades where many churches get
[30:21] of course
[30:23] there are civilizations because of the
[30:25] greatness of civilization
[30:32] because barbara was forsaken long time
[30:34] ago
[30:41] we have heard people say that he has
[30:43] never been our absolute
[30:46] party
[30:48] i believe that we shouldn't say such a
[30:50] thing
[30:52] those are really blasphemous
[30:56] it is really lack of respect
[31:02] important
[31:19] i don't see anybody that will take us to
[31:21] heaven if it's not brother brother
[31:25] and it's his message that takes us to
[31:27] heaven
[31:28] amen amen
[31:39] everything that he can tell us
[31:41] everything that he can say we have to
[31:43] believe it
[31:58] therefore i'd like to ask to keep that
[32:00] respect
[32:02] very toward him and there's a parody
[32:05] toward his word or siam versa family
[32:08] also toward his family
[32:12] therefore it's very important
[32:20] felicity
[32:21] and i wanted to congratulate you for
[32:23] that right yes
[32:25] hello
[32:36] the pastor already said everything
[32:38] it's
[32:39] good
[32:56] the children must have all that respect
[32:58] toward the fathers and mothers
[33:03] already said it oh no
[33:06] honor the father mother
[33:23] paul says that that's the first
[33:24] commandment with a promise
[33:27] [Music]
[33:30] somebody honors the father and mother
[33:32] hello
[33:35] therefore the lord will grant them to
[33:37] live longer
[33:38] amen amen and those of us he depends on
[33:42] the spiritual and we also have fathers
[33:44] in spirit in the spiritual
[33:46] pastor
[33:48] than the spiritual our pastor is our
[33:50] father spiritually
[33:54] therefore we have to respect him
[33:58] we have to pray for him
[34:06] that the person happened to hit
[34:08] something really hard this is
[34:12] uh
[34:13] it's uh actually to keep you on the line
[34:16] i thank you
[34:18] so you do not stray
[34:20] pascal
[34:22] because he's been a father every person
[34:27] a true father is not somebody that
[34:30] babysits the children they say
[34:42] [Music]
[34:51] [Music]
[34:55] you truly have to know that the past is
[34:57] that's truly your father
[34:59] uh
[35:13] you have to know that that's our father
[35:16] lele v to lift him up
[35:20] and to honor him
[35:25] that's very important
[35:27] to avoid pastor uh
[35:39] as a pastor i know many mistakes that
[35:42] the ship may do
[35:50] foreign but you don't want to say it to
[35:52] your pastor
[35:57] therefore understand that you're making
[35:58] a great mistake
[36:13] i've been a pastor a long time ago let
[36:14] me speak like that because i know how to
[36:16] deal with this but say to your pastor
[36:19] even things that you may feel ashamed
[36:21] about
[36:38] it's good

[1:26:53] we meet him in the air purify
[1:26:56] to receive his bride
[1:26:59] that's the rupture right
[1:27:01] that's the rupture

[1:29:12] to see him face to face
[1:29:16] amen

[1:29:50] but when he comes there
[1:29:51] pandora
[1:29:52] is to receive his bride
[1:29:56] is to take you me andre to take me
[1:30:00] to cesar to take all them children
[1:30:03] and do everything
[1:30:06] else
[1:30:07] that them children receive the holy
[1:30:09] ghost
[1:30:13] said that you don't have to receive the
[1:30:14] holy ghost come later just like their
[1:30:17] fathers
[1:30:18] you do have a fair inexperience they
[1:30:20] have to have an experience
[1:30:24] it's not you see that there only there's
[1:30:25] a creature we're reading the scriptures
[1:30:27] yes sure yes of course but that's gonna
[1:30:29] count on pressure probably when we
[1:30:31] preach
[1:30:32] completely
[1:30:45] that will give them the baptism of the
[1:30:46] holy ghost
[1:30:48] because the bible said then they are
[1:30:50] pressured then while peter was preaching
[1:30:52] listen
[1:30:54] that the holy ghost came in
[1:30:56] do you understand that
[1:31:01] by the foreign ghost you have to be
[1:31:02] prepared to receive it
[1:31:07] you have to repent
[1:31:09] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:31:10] jesus christ amen amen
[1:31:14] to be sanctified
[1:31:43] believe the lord jesus christ as your
[1:31:45] savior
[1:31:46] you say amen today a prayer and then
[1:31:49] amen amen who is that
[1:31:52] you are justified circumcision it's as
[1:31:54] if you have never done anything
[1:31:56] but
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:45] for the holy ghost to come and dwell
[1:32:47] with him it comes with that periphery
[1:32:49] and when you're purified hello the
[1:32:51] sentence with you then the holy ghost
[1:32:53] comes in elantra and it gets into you
[1:32:57] then you're saved amen amen
[1:33:00] then you are redeemed
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:04] amen
[1:33:20] heal the sick they shall sell them to
[1:33:23] cast out demons
[1:33:25] do i have three people who can say amen
[1:33:29] if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:33:31] you cannot do anything with god
[1:33:45] you must have the baptism of the holy
[1:33:47] ghost
[1:33:48] who understood that they say i'm
[1:33:50] available let me read it to you
[1:33:52] for pop and second don't think that uh
[1:33:56] pastor freddie
[1:33:58] he was just saying no no no
[1:34:01] let me see
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:18] uh december 17 1959 paragraph
[1:34:22] paragraphy
[1:34:26] we're going to say that
[1:34:59] for the rest of the dead leave not for
[1:35:01] the space of a thousand years
[1:35:03] severe that's right
[1:35:06] in the rapture
[1:35:10] it's only those who are filled with the
[1:35:11] holy ghost
[1:35:28] all my friends are from this town wait
[1:35:30] yes
[1:35:32] from denver here
[1:35:34] and for this whole country cj proves
[1:35:37] selma avec my voicemail if i could only
[1:35:41] with my human voice
[1:35:50] bless into your heart the importance of
[1:35:52] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:01] it would be the most wonderful
[1:36:03] revelation that you ever had in your
[1:36:05] life
[1:36:22] hand
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:26] it's very very important
[1:36:30] if you die in the church
[1:36:32] you don't seek the holy ghost
[1:36:35] no you're just wasting your time
[1:36:39] on the center because god will only
[1:36:41] rupture those who are spirit or who the
[1:36:42] holy ghost is fulfilled please john
[1:36:44] thunder was a man can i hear you amen
[1:36:48] can i hear your amen amen amen
[1:36:52] you know the show is a victim therefore
[1:36:54] another thing with the rapture amen amen
[1:36:58] because where we at no some less than
[1:37:00] foundation we accept sons of god
[1:37:04] you have already told

[1:38:23] therefore he preaches
[1:38:25] on the mystery of the rapture
[1:38:28] basketball
[1:38:37] that's what all he could give to the
[1:38:39] people because then people have to end
[1:38:40] up going into the rapture two lesser
[1:38:57] for us you say chairman from the like
[1:38:59] the seventh-day adventists
[1:39:02] it's from the first age jesus

[1:42:35] but what ends up the plan of redemption
[1:42:39] is the opening of the seals
[1:42:43] coming of the lord himself
[1:42:46] himself
