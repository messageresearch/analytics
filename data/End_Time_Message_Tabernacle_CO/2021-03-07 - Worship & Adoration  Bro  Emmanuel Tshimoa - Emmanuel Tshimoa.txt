not depart from you [Music] every step of the way [Music] you feel he required the book and the spirit [Music] the physical moses was gone foreign [Applause] is the thing that leads us all the way into the land this cannot fail further because the key look for the guard to the whole book father pascal not toasted about not saying masala not wondering not wondering who am i uh ruben knew he was the first bonfire rebecca vegeta judah knew he was the last sign in the heavens and lord father god in him all the promises have to be fulfilled because the kingdom has to come look for the god through judah vasquez in this great david fall lord between his rejection and lord father god and him coming to the kingdom [Music] they understood he's uncomfortable they had to stand love for the god with david they had to stay with the world because the anointing was in david because the fight has to take place in the land oh the combat device persists you should have to fight in the land we have to fight in the land we will remain in the land the fourth state we shall never retract father they want it but we shall look for the god stand strong stay calm we shall be courageous because no father got this mystery was [Music] [Music] lord this is the mystery of hidden fathers between joshua and judge's father almighty savior you give this to your children not to the world because we have received six measures of bali foreign precious lord that's what paul said i run toward the marks of the high calling in christ jesus [Music] precious redeemer this great pardon say consignor that you have given unto us lord to unlock the father god the whole book father the deliverer lord almighty or this does not hold anymore any mysteries [Music] [Music] even by promise it was not purchased by a human blood human ability but it was given by god himself but the gift of the lord and they don't need you the land the terror where lord father got all the blessings lord father god flows father we recognize that this is our land foreign what [Music] our joy [Music] [Music] [Music] while the rest of our god of the priests remain lord father god is god's father we will not settle down look for the god lord father god to be just church members to have church look for the god of positions but we want [Music] [Music] looking and bring it all the way into the landfill examination precious redeemer this is the word lord not lord father human emotions my lord he said be courageous because very soon john lopez will take place father basketball because we've seen the coming of the son of man we've seen the father god the spiritual dead lord coming to resurrection we've seen the father god the ministry of got going all over the world and pretty soon no father god the new feast the lord god coming to pass lord almighty savior these are things mystery truth secret passages that you have given to the bride a spiritual language the language between the bride and the bridegroom where rebecca becomes the father god at the joy of isaac father after the death of the god of sarah oh precious lord surely thy word is what you've given to their people first on purpose oh precious redeemer surely surely around here the throne comes down oh precious god disease cannot be standing fire [Music] the son of man come and speak again father and lord for the god that we shall speak and prophesy and we shall look for the god and speak the word because that's what you have desired from the very beginning that this book of the lord shall not depart from thy mouth and you want us to speak the word lord almighty how shall we speak if we are not signed i shall they hear if there is no preacher shall he preach if he is not signed moses could not speak jeremiah couldn't speak ezekiel couldn't when he says god bless you it's that you shall be with us as you was with william branham and said you heard my voice but it wasn't me but it was that angel [Music] and when the cycle returns

was going through the neighborhood thank you lord almighty that cancer was gone further that depression was gone foreign give them more father more than lord father god what the preacher could be able to give father confidence it's not a man testimony but it's your testimony because you've called us bride father not a church not a pastor not a minister not a brother not a sister we believe you father god is searching [Applause] [Music] praying for one another remembering one another with true love and respect lord and [Music] [Music] unto them that you've given the father god the new body they just changed love for the god for why from one place to the next until father god we've been made again lord father guiding that 40 day period father we pray your way unto your father random to
