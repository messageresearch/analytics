school we're here another week another lesson another story to learn we hope you guys are doing okay and this lesson that we're gonna bring to you to be a blessing for you we're just gonna start off with a word of Prayer if we can all bow our heads dear Heavenly Father we thank you for another opportunity that you've given to us to be another day another week we pray that God may spend as much of it in your presence father serving you and didn't it for you may bless this lesson knowledge about to start it it opened up our quiet spiritual ears and our hearts my understanding so that we may receive something from you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen alrighty so before we jump into our lessons to pray I just want to take a few seconds for you guys to sit back and kind of try to remember what we talked about last week know it's been just a week but um just try to remember and talked about so we did talked about we talked about time and how to manage our time and he talked about how the Chi and how to number I dates all the life that we live in and the number of data we have on earth you have to spend it by serving God and giving my best to God if you can remember that so our Leslie today is gonna go not really about also time but we're just gonna tell a little story if you want to follow along with me it's in the Book of Luke Luke chapter 16 and we're gonna start from verse from verse 19 so Luke chapter 16 verse 19 so make sure you have your Bible it's always a good thing to have your Bible with you for every Christians have your own Bible I know if you're old enough to read or you can't read yet and we can have a Bible alone someone can helping you learn how to read but it's always good for Christians have their home Bible so anyway we're gonna start with Luke chapter Luke chapter 16 verse 19 and it's talking about a rich man and here they call him the yeah the rich there was a certain young rich man and the Bible said that this man was always well dressed and he was cold and fine linen purple so he's the way the color purple the color purple and the days of the Bible meant you know you are someone of great wealth or royalty or something like that so this man was a rich man and he lived in a wonderful place you know the great life he had whatever he wanted all the riches and all the great things of this world and right outside of his gate there was a beggar who was sitting there and this beggar name was Lazarus Lazarus and Lazarus was a beggar who sat right just that he came and Lazarus has soared all over his body stories are like little like little what can I say little aches all over his body that used to hurt him and he was taught to scratch himself and they were doing and what he was just he was just in really painful conditions and the Bible said that dogs used to come I and when they were lives were sitting at the gate they would come and start licking his soil Oh imagine you know being steak or a baker and sitting there and dog coming it's looking and licking your sword so the Eliezer is the Baker he didn't have you know good clothes or money and food to eat so he would just say at that key and movie wonder when he saw the rich man passed by he'd be like please can you please give me something to eat even a little bit of even a little bit of bread or a little bit of crumbs the Bible's have used to wait even for the crumbs coming from there from the rich man's table and he would be happy for just to get even those crumbs so as time went by the rich man died and raz Blasio's also died so what happened to the Baker the Bible says in verse 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom man also died and was buried and was buried so we see that the beggar Lazarus he died and who if he went to heaven right he wants to go Rex and Abraham's problem in heaven but the rich man she did not go to heaven let's see the Bible says in verse 23 and in how she lifted up his eyes being in torments and see if Abraham afar enlarges and his bosom so we see the Bible says here that the rich man went to hell and hell is a horrible place he was tormented and tormented means like he's disturbed he was an agony he's in pain he was not in P so he looked up to heaven and he sees a far-off he sees Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom and the rich man because he did so much to him and so much pain the place where he was so horrible he said Abraham Lazarus to you at least this pick the tip of your finger just the very tip of your thing will dip it in water just barely tap it in water and put it on my tongue because I'm so thirsty and I'm so tormented and I just want and it's so hot here and I just want just a little drop of water just to know moisturize my tongue a little bit and Abraham said well remember when you are on earth when you're on earth and you were living you had all these great things yeah but that you drink the best drink you ate the best food you were the banks closed you live a luxury you live the luxurious life and Lazarus who's here in heaven to live to pay a painful life in his tormented all the time but now it's the opposite right now you're the one who's tormented and we're in peace and he said yes I understand but I just want a little bit of water just not even a cup of wild not even a slipper whatever just your finger just to put this to moisturize my lips and Abraham said well where you are and where I am there's a big gap there's a big distance a big space between us and I can get to where you are and you can't come to where we are and he was in so much pain and tormented in agony and he said Abraham can you at least give her a chance I have five brothers why so on earth and neither of them know the Word of God neither of them have the word to know have the Word of God it's a way for me to go back on earth or defend someone to go talk to them and to you know cuz I don't I don't want them to come to how I don't want them to come to this horrible place and Abraham told and he's like well your brothers on earth they have Moses and the prophets so they have the Word of God if you want to believe they should open up the Bible and they should open up the scriptures and read it for themselves and let's see they have Moses and the prophets and verse 30 says and he said nay father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto them if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though rose from the dead so he tells him that the only way in to read mugs in the pub if they don't believe in order from the pub and the pocket then they won't even believe the dead man they won't believe a dead man who came back to come back on Isaac tell them so what are you just showing that simulation the storytelling that's in relationship to what we talked about maybe last week it's just saying that you know we can live our life you know on earth you can have all the the riches and all the benefits you can live our best life you can have all the best you know the best clothes we can have the best of friends you can have the best car we can wear the best shoes but the end of the day is that really what's important to us no the Bible says that it is what will the proper me if I gain the whole world but lose my soul the soul is the most important thing to us and we have to feed our souls our heart our spiritual thoughts more than we feed our flesh in this physical life so by spending our time in prayer by spending our time reading the Bible on our own we're feeding our soul and we're treasuring what God has given to us is it the most important thing it's not going to benefit us much if we say ok on earth I'm just gonna be happy I'm gonna party all the time I'm gonna go to ball games I'm gonna make the best then at the end of the day God is gonna say well I don't know you know you can't enter into heaven because you universe spent time for me you never gave me here never came to church maybe or when even when he did come to church you didn't give me your best you know so we have to make sure that we're spending our time my time on this right that God has given to us like we said last week we don't know how long you think that we have on earth but make sure that every second we have every moment that we have we are thinking about what God wants us to do God all constantly in our heart we can be asking God God is by the way I'm living proven to you is what I'm doing cleaning - you are my thoughts pleasing to you are my actions please enjoy my word the word that come out of my mouth are they pretty to you because we want constantly to walk and to please God right even if it means that on earth you can be torment that we can be made for us maybe we can be mocked maybe we won't be beggars like Lazarus but maybe our friends won't like us because we activate our friends won't want to hang out with us because we can't do certain things yeah we can separate in be like I wish to be I had good friends who can like me it was faith and I wish that I wish I didn't have to make be made fun of because of the way I dress or I wish I didn't have to be made fun of because of going to church but that's gonna be worth it one day one day we have a promise that God has created heaven he has created a mansion for us and one day we're gonna forget all the problems of this world and we're just gonna be in heaven rejoicing with the saints excuse me the Joyce thing was thanks being in God's presence having the peace and the joy that we can never have on this world so that's just to tell you that today let's just try your best to push towards that having the calling to live our best deliver I bet to try her back to live for God and to reach that reward we also have another story a short story in the book of David's in the book of Matthew yes it's also talking about another rich man another rich man who came in Saudi and came to Jesus one day either what can I do it was just let me tried to find it here all together so we're reading the book of mark sorry I'm sorry it's in the book of Mark chapter 17 so in the book of Mark chapter 10 verse 17 it says hmm and when he was gone forth in the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and so there was a man another rich young ruler he came to G listen if there Jesus what can I do to have eternal life what can I do to the however lasting life and Jesus told him well take all your goods and all your belongings and all the things that you possess and sell it to the poor and the actually before I gets that part he said he said Jesus said well he said well Jesus I been since I was a little boy I know the Ten Commandments a 10th commandment says thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery thou shall not covet and he said I've done this I know all these things and I've lived this and Jesus said well you have to take all your good in all your position to sell it to the poor and he said well he probably deep down inside he was like I don't know if I can do that that's too much Jesus is asking you for too much but that was his way to have eternal life by giving up all his possessions all he's good but he refused to do that and you look that it was hard for a rich man to enter into heaven it's easier for a camel it's like right they great camel games with little needles I a little needle you know those little meals I can cook you it's easier for a big camel to get into that than for a rich man to get into heaven so what is the mean by Richmond today let's apply it to ourselves by original when Jesus called us to give us to give up all our belongings to follow him maybe to give up all the stuff that we like doing that or not maybe godly to give up maybe all the games that we spent hours and hours playing or the movie that we can spend hours and hours watch and you have to give that up to God give that up and take our and and follow Jesus it's hard to follow you know to say ok I'm gonna when I spend all my time doing this listen to and then I'll give a little time to you know God wants to give up everything everything completely and to follow him so just a little reminder so from last week we talked a lot of time how are we spending that time let's spend the time try to do our best to spend our time in God's presence all right thank you very much and we're gonna go to Shalom if you had anything bad for us Thank You Sharon yeah just just a comment of what she said that it is so important like the Bible says to set your affections on the things above rather than the things on earth because all the things on earth even the riches that this young man had when he died and he went to how he couldn't take it with him you know you could have all your favorite items toys whatever gadgets and you you treasure it so much but at the end of the day when you go to heaven you won't take it with you when you die you won't take it with you we came into the earth with nothing and when we leave the earth we will go with nothing and if we set our hearts and our desires and whatever we want to do towards the things of God those things will never never never perish let's say for example you brought someone closer to the Lord that one will never perish why because you can see that person that happened one day right compared to maybe you achieve some big goal here down on earth even though those are not wrong and we're supposed to do them when you get to the other side they won't mean nothing to you right because even in the Bible when Abraham if you go back to where Abraham was telling that rich young ruler who was crying out to him like please father Abraham give me even a little bit of water and he says remember in your lifetime when you were down there you enjoyed all the good times you were you were enjoying your money and all the riches that you had a Lazarus you were suffering he wasn't going through a good time it wasn't a happy thing but now he's at rest now he's at peace now look at you right where did all his riches and all the time that he had and all the youthfulness where did it go it was all spent on basically nothing and how Jesus told him hey so all you have give it to the poor and come follow me cuz that was his problem right because he had too many riches and he couldn't follow Jesus and he turned away he couldn't follow you he couldn't follow Jesus so that's what Jesus is asking for us today is to leave all those things behind not physically you know like you know depriving yourself from certain things no but setting your heart and your desires towards the things of God which will never never perish in your your own soul because that's what your gonna take to heaven this body it's gonna go into the ground or if we go in the rapture we'll have a different body right so we want to take care of what we have on the inside sometimes we focus too much on the outside what we eat we dress how we sleep or what we do how much fun that we have right but we never really pay so much attention to the soul on the inside you know it's just like a little blood if you water it or a little a little child if you give them food and drink and let them sleep but they will grow right the same thing with your soul on the inside so focus what's on the inside more than on the outside you know there's the you know the full armor of God that you have to have like in order to fight the devil basically remember the stature of the perfect man and all the fruits of the spirits that we always talk about love joy peace patience you know making sure that you have all those together in your heart engage making sure that you are filled with the holy spirit and that you're not just walking around and then when the rapture would happen or when the time for you to go you are not ready right because we want to make sure that our we are ready on the inside it's just like the story of the foolish version and and the wise version right the wise virgins they had their lamps and their oil was ready for to meet the bridegroom but what happened to the foolish virgins the foolish virgins they went to sleep right and then when they heard that the bridegroom was coming they started to wake up and be like oh can we have a little bit of your oil for our lamps because we were not ready sorry we were sleeping like heat please can we borrow but it was too late for them right the rice version says go o for your own oil we got our own oil we were already we were waiting you guys went and went to sleep you know if I oh I'll do it later right we don't want to be like that we want to be ready whenever the time will come back on to use us or whenever he wants to take us home so that's basically it and I hope you guys enjoyed and got something out of this Sunday School lesson that will help you one day in the future and our goal is you know to see each other in heaven one day where we can rejoice and be happy where there won't be any more troubles or sorrows or heartaches I hope to see y'all there so I guess we are done for this lesson today and I guess we're just going to bow our heads and pray okay they're heavily father God we thank you again for this little moment that we got to just speak about your words and the little children Oh father god I just pray that these little things that they heard of I may just plant a little seed in their heart and there they will grow into full maturity Oh father gun I probably a prayer blessing over their lives about me you watch over them and protect them Oh God we commit all things into your hands for the rest of the week maybe with all of us bless each and every one of us Jesus name we pray amen all righty you guys cool take care take care we love you guys see you next Sunday
