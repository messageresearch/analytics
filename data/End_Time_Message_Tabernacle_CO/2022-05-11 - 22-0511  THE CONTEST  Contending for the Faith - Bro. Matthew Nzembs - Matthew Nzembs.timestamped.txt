[15:36] and i like to use this moment to speak
[15:39] about the greatest contest of the
[15:40] tournament
[15:43] is what is taking place between the
[15:46] church and said set the ground the first
[15:48] distance in this great fight of satan
[15:52] de la
[15:56] and we want to speak of the great
[15:57] strength of god in his church
[16:07] now the philistines guarded the armies
[16:09] of tobaro
[16:12] and they guarded her together at sokkov
[16:15] which belonged to judah he'll compare
[16:18] anthrax
[16:20] and pitch between sokkov
[16:29] and seoul and the men of israel gathered
[16:32] together
[17:17] [Music]
[17:28] [Music]
[17:44] coach was uh 5 000.
[17:50] and uh the stuff of his prayer was uh
[17:54] sincerely the fair and his parents had
[17:57] awaited us 600
[18:47] [Music]
[19:28] [Music]
[19:52] they say
[19:53] that's what the devil tells us
[19:56] describe the message that we are slaves
[19:58] or servants of the message
[20:01] why obey to the message
[20:04] why to
[20:39] and many times the devil doesn't
[20:40] understand that we have a guard
[20:44] he was an overcomer since the mouth of
[20:46] god
[20:56] [Music]
[20:58] you say that
[21:01] i'll fight
[21:02] i challenge them
[21:04] i defy the armies of israel this day
[21:06] versus western
[21:08] illidan
[21:10] you said
[21:13] give me a man in
[21:16] that women may fight together
[21:21] yes when soul and all israel heard that
[21:24] those words of philistine
[21:26] they were dismayed
[21:29] i'm greatly afraid
[21:33] if you notice carefully
[21:36] they didn't say that david was among
[21:38] them
[21:39] in fact
[21:41] some pepper one style once uh soul was
[21:44] with his face
[21:48] they heard that the
[21:49] words of this man goliath
[21:53] the bible said we're afraid la perce
[22:24] now david was the son of ephrathite of
[22:28] bethlehem judah no me izayi
[22:31] whose name was
[22:32] this and he heard sounds
[22:37] and the men went among men
[22:39] and for an old man
[22:45] and the three elder sons of just went
[22:47] and followed solo to the battle
[23:06] and david was the youngest and lost
[23:10] and the three elders who followed so
[23:12] david
[23:14] but david went and returned from saying
[23:20] his father's ship at bethlehem
[23:26] and the philistines drew near mourinho
[23:28] [Music]
[23:31] and presented himself for 40 days
[23:33] imaginable and uh
[23:48] there was nobody that could challenge
[23:50] this man
[23:53] even listen to the awakening
[23:58] now listen to what they had has weapons
[24:03] therefore there was nobody there to
[24:04] challenge
[24:06] you for 40 days
[24:09] morning and night
[24:14] it was really ashamed for the armies of
[24:16] israel
[24:22] [Music]
[24:31] and they take these 10 laws and run to
[24:33] they came to their brethren
[24:39] and carried this 10 cheese onto the
[24:42] captain of the thousand
[24:59] of israel were in the valley of sheila
[25:00] fighting with the philistines
[25:04] therefore
[25:05] the fight that has lasted longer
[25:08] they didn't have any victory
[25:12] at least that's why goliath became a
[25:15] little bit arrogant
[25:18] he started defying the army of israel
[25:20] david silva de bombardier david uh rose
[25:24] up early in the morning elizabeth
[25:27] and left the ship with a keeper
[25:35] just had commanded him
[25:43] and he came to the trench as a host was
[25:46] going to be able to mike
[25:47] and shouted for the battle israel
[25:54] for israel and the philistines
[26:01] army against army and david left his
[26:03] carriage in the hand of the keyboard
[26:06] and they ran into the army
[26:26] and as he talked with them behold they
[26:28] came up the champion the philistine of
[26:30] gath goliath by name out of the armies
[26:33] of the philistines and spake according
[26:35] to the same words and david heard them
[26:41] say
[26:42] jesus
[26:47] and all the men of israel one day when
[26:50] they saw the man fled from him and was
[26:52] so afraid
[26:59] and then the men of israel said have you
[27:02] seen this man
[27:04] je veg
[27:14] and all the men of israel when they saw
[27:16] the men fled from before from him and
[27:18] we're so afraid
[27:21] now listen carefully
[27:24] although i'm the man of israel
[27:29] they were unable to withstand goliath
[28:00] the person can
[28:23] you have to keep trying it
[28:25] you have to try
[28:26] you have to try again
[29:01] [Music]
[29:10] up secretly
[29:13] and you shall be that
[29:16] the king will enrich him
[29:20] with great riches
[29:25] and israel and will give him his
[29:27] daughter and make his father's house
[29:29] free in israel
[29:32] i believe that when david heard that
[29:36] he was happy
[29:41] and david speak to the men that stood by
[29:43] him
[29:46] i believe that he heard that david
[29:49] david speak to them
[29:51] that stood by him
[30:20] that killed this philistines
[30:25] and taken away the reproach from israel
[30:33] and who is this philistine in december
[30:36] it's a second question
[30:44] what shall be done to the men who shall
[30:45] kill them
[30:47] and who is this man
[30:52] he first wanted to be sure about his
[30:54] adversary
[30:57] and he said that this uncircumcised fool
[31:00] answered
[31:02] that it should defy the armies of the
[31:04] living exhaustive
[31:06] sweets these were really insults
[31:15] and the people answered him after this
[31:17] moment
[31:23] to the men that killed him
[31:30] i heard
[31:58] and
[32:10] he didn't just come to see the battle
[33:20] and when the words were heard
[33:48] by looking at small boys
[33:58] [Applause]
[34:04] because of this philistine
[34:08] that thy servant will go and fight with
[34:10] this philistine
[34:15] saudi arabia and saul said to david tina
[34:32] is a youth we got to come ali malee and
[34:35] look at how the devil is very cunning
[34:40] he start by discouraging you people
[34:42] affair you can do it
[34:44] you are just a child
[35:43] [Music]
[36:10] if david wanted to uh
[36:14] probably wouldn't if he had to work with
[36:16] group of people probably you would have
[36:17] nominated me but
[36:19] this is summer demands this world that's
[36:21] my request tonight
[36:23] encourage yourself
[36:27] despite its people for segments
[36:34] despite these people for saying that
[36:37] encourage yourself with faith
[36:41] the faith gives courage
[36:44] amen
[36:46] in the grand person
[36:52] he has overturned
[37:21] if david could compare him he was that
[37:23] man inaudible he wouldn't do nothing
[37:29] physically
[37:30] but you started to show him what he did
[37:32] as a young man
[37:34] overseas
[37:46] [Music]
[38:16] he was mocking david
[38:19] elizabeth
[38:21] he knew that david wouldn't do nothing
[38:26] probably tonight the world might think
[38:28] that you can do nothing
[38:44] hey
[39:12] and he said to
[39:25] and david put them off him secondly
[39:29] that's what the
[39:30] believer has to do
[39:34] allah saul was with those things
[39:39] before goliath david was nothing
[39:41] merigadela picked the shows but look at
[39:43] the worst things
[39:47] he came and
[39:48] gave to david those things
[39:52] the bible says that david tried to walk
[39:59] [Music]
[40:08] and
[40:21] is
[40:51] of simon before any spirit of this world
[40:54] amen amen
[41:00] verse 41
[41:04] and the philistine came on and drove
[41:09] and the men at that bear they shall wait
[41:15] and when the philistines
[41:18] and so david
[41:28] young and already and they were fair
[41:29] countenance
[41:32] and many times that's what the devil
[41:33] does to us
[41:35] come with that divine situation when you
[41:37] face a good situation
[41:40] you don't know what to do
[41:43] yeah he started uh despising you
[41:51] and the bible says that when goliath
[41:53] looked at david
[41:54] and we cannot he only saw a young man
[41:57] blonde if
[41:59] already
[42:27] [Music]
[43:05] many times that's the good thing to say
[43:06] to the devil
[43:08] situation you're presenting me
[43:50] and all israel shall know that the lord
[43:52] has a god
[43:54] wow
[43:58] this is a great declare statement
[44:03] the whole either assembly will know that
[44:05] the bride has god
[44:29] shall know that the lord saileth not
[44:31] with sword and spear
[44:33] god
[44:46] unto the lord himself
[45:44] the bible says that he fell all upon his
[45:46] face to the earth
[45:48] in other words
[45:52] he was ashamed
[45:56] the challenge he faced at the armies of
[45:58] israel this
[46:11] so david prevailed over the philistine
[46:13] with a sling
[46:16] and smote to the philistines
[46:18] [Music]
[46:22] but there was no sword in the hand
[46:26] the david
[46:40] with and when they feel like he's alive
[46:44] champions were dead they fled
[46:48] me let it be so for your enemies amen
[46:57] and the men of israel and jude arose and
[46:59] shouted
[47:01] out of joy
[47:04] one day you're going to crash out of joy
[47:07] i'll offend the lab
[47:08] at the
[47:22] the
[47:27] [Music]
[47:49] and the children of israel returned from
[47:51] chasing after the philippines
[47:53] and they spoiled the tents la force
[47:57] the strength that they didn't have i
[47:59] caused their number because of a man
[48:01] illusion repeated
[48:02] they got back the carriage
[48:32] and david took the head of the
[48:33] philippines jerusalem and brought it to
[48:35] jerusalem
[48:42] the sign of victory
[48:46] just swept
[49:11] david go forth against the philistines
[49:13] illegita abner
[49:40] the stripling is
[49:45] angel one day
[49:47] legend jiro people will say
[49:50] the kivuset who are you from
[49:56] essentially
[50:02] because the lord god will fight for you
[50:07] versus it verse 57
[50:50] the world will know your identity
[51:00] [Music]
[51:08] where people have to kill one another
[51:11] how would were they doing it elizabeth
[51:14] they had a record hello
[51:18] people have to stand on both sides
[51:34] to win
[51:38] that's the same way as the devil tried
[51:39] to do illinois
[51:43] he did the devil didn't know who he was
[51:45] challenging since he tell us jesus if he
[51:48] knew who the lord jesus christ was
[51:53] saying he would have even asked for
[51:54] forgiveness before starting
[51:58] but i'm saying in the contesting
[52:00] contending for the faith this is
[52:27] commenting in jude where we just read
[52:29] bieleme beloved
[52:54] [Music]
[52:58] faith that was once delivered onto the
[53:00] saints
[53:02] exactly
[53:05] that was uh actually 33 years after
[53:09] the monday
[53:12] transmission
[53:14] and now it was requested unto them to
[53:15] content for the faith that was once
[53:17] delivered to the sanctions
[53:24] there was a awakening
[53:26] since then
[53:41] for the faith that was once delivered to
[53:42] the saints
[53:44] not for once
[53:47] for the faith
[53:54] and so some of us would think that it's
[53:56] our church that happens
[53:59] i believe that we i hope that we haven't
[54:01] executive but now let's
[54:03] search the scriptures
[54:10] to see if our church is fighting for the
[54:13] faith
[54:14] not at least
[54:17] our church is fighting for the faith
[55:17] and examine our faith by the faith that
[55:18] was once delivered today
[55:21] then if we find out that the like is
[55:22] like
[55:24] i'll find out
[55:29] then we believe that we have the faith
[55:31] that was once delivered
[56:13] let's look the great men of the bible
[56:16] they are the elders
[56:19] the great man of the bible david david
[56:23] samson simpson
[56:25] jonas jonas
[56:28] all
[56:41] determine what you will end up
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:42] [Applause]
[58:19] it was because of the faith
[58:24] the judas
[58:26] for the faith
[58:28] david
[58:29] because david had the faith you look at
[58:31] that day
[58:32] you look at god he was looking listen
[58:35] for this i don't know problem the
[58:36] children of israel are shamed
[58:39] without any help sons exploits without
[58:42] any hope some folks without friends
[58:45] ain't necessarily fair and he did they
[58:47] didn't know what their faith is
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:02] and he will
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:55] the character
[1:00:26] they will also speak
[1:00:40] your name will be written somewhere
[1:00:44] your name would be written upon the
