[4:19] hello there this is Shalom
[4:22] hi there with another Sunday School
[4:25] lesson sorry about last Sunday we had a
[4:27] few issues and we weren't able to come
[4:30] together and film for the lesson but we
[4:33] got you this Sunday alright so we're
[4:35] just gonna start off with the word
[4:36] prayer and then we're gonna jump into
[4:38] our lesson all right at their Heavenly
[4:42] Father God we thank you again for
[4:44] another day you know the opportunity
[4:45] that you gave to us of God to live for
[4:48] your garden to display our lives for you
[4:50] O Father God we commit this morning into
[4:52] your hands if other cutters will be
[4:53] teaching their children today or maybe
[4:55] they get something out of the Sunday
[4:57] School lesson that they'd be able to
[4:59] apply to their heart so father God we
[5:01] thank you for everything committing all
[5:02] things into your hands and Jesus name we
[5:04] pray amen
[5:06] okay so I think you guys had a good two
[5:11] weeks break or a week break from us and
[5:14] I gave you guys some homework to do
[5:19] wasn't long but I just gave you second
[5:22] Kings chapter 20 and I also gave you in
[5:25] class 6 chapter 3 verses 1 - I believe
[5:29] it was 8 8 and I told you guys like
[5:33] after reading it I wanted you guys to
[5:35] figure out what exactly were these
[5:37] scriptures talking about but today my
[5:39] lesson what I'm gonna get out of these
[5:41] scriptures is about time okay so in
[5:45] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 it was talking
[5:49] about a time right so everything there's
[5:51] a season there is a time there was a
[5:54] purpose for everything there's a time to
[5:56] be born there's a time to die there's a
[5:59] time to be happy there's a time to be
[6:00] sad there's a time to weep there's a
[6:03] time to dance there's a time to you know
[6:07] there's a time for everything you know
[6:09] and it's not just like for example
[6:10] during this time everybody's trying to
[6:13] stay at home and be safe you know it's
[6:14] not attempt to always be going out you
[6:17] know being in contact with a lot of
[6:19] people right but before that that was
[6:21] the time to do it
[6:23] for example when you school time right
[6:25] you want to go outside and play right
[6:27] but it's not exactly the time to be
[6:29] outside and playing right because you
[6:30] need to be in school you need to be
[6:32] studying and that's the same thing that
[6:34] God gave God gave to us God gave to us
[6:36] that time for everybody everybody in
[6:39] this world we all have 24 hours in a day
[6:42] nobody has 25 and then another one it
[6:44] has like 23 know everybody has 24 hours
[6:48] in the day so everybody has an equal
[6:50] opportunity and equal chance to live
[6:53] their whole day the whole life for God
[6:55] right so now the story that I made you
[7:00] guys read was in 2nd Kings chapter 20
[7:03] and it's a story about a king his name
[7:05] is Hezekiah and if you start from the
[7:08] beginning Hezekiah was actually I'm
[7:10] thinking he was not a bad King he was a
[7:12] good king but Hezekiah got sick and and
[7:17] getting sick the prophet Isaiah came to
[7:20] Hezekiah and started to warn him and
[7:22] told him hey look you're gonna die
[7:25] make sure that you got your life in
[7:27] order you got your life straight your
[7:29] family in order make all the wrong
[7:31] things that you did go make it right
[7:33] you have to go ask for forgiveness go
[7:35] ask for forgiveness right and Hezekiah
[7:37] heard this and he was so shocked and he
[7:40] said how can this be how can this happen
[7:43] I can't die now and for is that for a
[7:45] lot of time a lot of times for us right
[7:47] we leave our whole lives we think we're
[7:49] going to live forever and ever and ever
[7:51] and we live any way we want to right you
[7:54] know a lot of people think oh well we'll
[7:56] take care of tomorrow you know I don't
[7:58] really think I need to serve God no you
[8:00] know I'm young I can do whatever I want
[8:02] I don't have to really be consecrating
[8:05] in my life oh you know surrender my life
[8:07] to God you know I'll do it when I'm a
[8:08] little bit older but no one is
[8:09] guaranteed that they will have tomorrow
[8:12] right so this in this in this case as a
[8:15] guy was actually pretty lucky to have
[8:17] the prophet Isaiah come to him and tell
[8:20] him hey you're gonna die soon so make
[8:22] sure you have your life straight make
[8:24] sure you let you have your life in order
[8:25] well
[8:27] Isaiah left the palace after telling
[8:29] Hezekiah Hezekiah was really really sick
[8:31] so Isaiah left the palace and Hezekiah
[8:34] after hearing this
[8:36] says that he targets basedgod and he
[8:38] started to pray and he said let's my
[8:41] numbers okay he said I beseech thee O
[8:44] Lord remember now I have walked before
[8:46] the in truth and with a perfect heart
[8:49] and have done that which is good in thy
[8:51] sight and has a Kyle web source so
[8:53] basically Hezekiah was saying God why am
[8:56] i dying now I've done I've lived my best
[8:59] life before you I've done what is right
[9:01] I walk before you I have obeyed your
[9:03] commandment I've done everything I'm
[9:04] supposed to do and that's how we're
[9:07] supposed to live right as Christians
[9:09] every day whether whether the good times
[9:11] were during the bad times whether we
[9:13] know we have you know 10 years ahead of
[9:15] us or whether we know that we can die
[9:17] tomorrow something that can happen to us
[9:19] tomorrow right we always want to be
[9:21] living right and doing what's right do
[9:23] it
[9:23] but what please God it came to pass well
[9:26] has it kind just started to pray and you
[9:29] can see that Hezekiah was very honest in
[9:31] his heart you know he said God he can
[9:34] just more years in my life I promise I'm
[9:38] gonna leave it even better right because
[9:40] he knows that if he if he dies now he
[9:43] won't be able to do the things maybe
[9:44] that he planned to do the things he
[9:46] wanted to do right so he started to pray
[9:49] to God
[9:49] earnestly with the heart and you know
[9:51] what God heard his prayer got hurt in
[9:53] prayer and then Isaiah as he was on his
[9:56] way up but I told I hear go back go back
[9:59] and tell Hezekiah that no I'm gonna let
[10:03] him live after three days he's gonna
[10:05] feel better he's gonna feel better and
[10:07] what am I gonna do i'm gonna add 15
[10:10] years to his life he said i'm gonna
[10:12] deliver him from all his enemies I will
[10:15] protect Israel I'm gonna defend them and
[10:17] he learned to give him all these
[10:19] promises as you read
[10:20] I believe in verse 6 he said okay go
[10:24] back go back and tell Hezekiah so as a
[10:26] guy he's laying there and he's prayed to
[10:28] god earnestly and fervently you see how
[10:30] important prayer is because maybe God
[10:33] maybe God had some certain plan for you
[10:35] maybe something was gonna happen but
[10:37] your prayers can change situations
[10:39] that's why we always say the phrase no
[10:41] prayer changes things because how does
[10:44] it kind of not prayer maybe he would
[10:45] have died just instantly but he prayed
[10:47] to God earnestly
[10:49] and as a and as Isaiah came back and
[10:52] told him all right this is what the Lord
[10:54] told you he's gonna give you an extra 15
[10:56] years to live now Hezekiah was lucky
[10:59] because God was ready to take him home
[11:01] but no because of hearing the prayer God
[11:03] gave him an extra 15 years okay he said
[11:07] I'm gonna protect who I'm gonna defend
[11:08] you I'm gonna deliver you from the king
[11:10] of Assyria and I'm gonna defend you cuz
[11:13] I'm gonna defend the city for my own
[11:16] sake right and then he said okay and
[11:18] then Isaiah told has a kind of a take a
[11:20] lump of figs just some herb some leads
[11:23] because Isaac I had a boil in verse
[11:25] seven he says and he says take a lump of
[11:28] figs and they took it and laid it on the
[11:30] boil and he recovered so basically
[11:32] whatever whatever a ball he had that was
[11:35] causing him to be sick Isaiah said just
[11:37] take some fig just take some believe
[11:39] some little herbs and put it on the bowl
[11:41] and after three days he's gonna get deep
[11:43] in it he's gonna recover and then
[11:46] Hezekiah said in verse eight what sign
[11:49] is the Lord gonna give to me that he's
[11:51] gonna show me that I'm healed and then
[11:54] he and then Isaiah said in verse nine
[11:58] this sign shall have this sign shall bow
[12:02] have of the Lord and the Lord will do a
[12:04] thing that he had spoken and shall the
[12:06] shadow go forward 10 degrees or go back
[12:09] 10 degrees so back in the days you know
[12:11] how now we have quacks or we have little
[12:14] watches on earth on a race that we can
[12:16] see no right now it's maybe 10 it's like
[12:18] 9:30 9:45 so but back then they didn't
[12:21] have that type of technology to know the
[12:23] time so what they used to do they used
[12:26] to watch the shadow of the Sun they
[12:29] would like put like a sundial like a
[12:30] like a piece of paper in there have just
[12:32] maybe like a little stick right in the
[12:34] middle and when the Sun would be on that
[12:36] little stick it would give a shadow so
[12:38] that they would know kind of at what
[12:40] time they were maybe they were in the
[12:41] morning afternoon or evening so they
[12:43] would know
[12:44] and Hezekiah said well for me to know
[12:47] that the lord is going to heal me and
[12:50] I'm gonna get better and I'm gonna have
[12:52] this 15 years of more life to myself I
[12:55] want that shadow to go backwards so
[12:59] basically he's saying I want the clock
[13:00] to go backwards now can you imagine
[13:03] they're not using technology they're not
[13:06] using you know the little digital
[13:08] watches that we had that uses the
[13:10] battery that can go backwards no in
[13:12] order for the bat little sundial to go
[13:16] backwards the Sun would have to go so
[13:19] that was a big miracle in itself can you
[13:21] imagine just in the middle of the day in
[13:23] the middle of the day all of a sudden
[13:25] the Sun just starts going backwards like
[13:26] this sundial the time on their little
[13:28] like men hand me like little if I should
[13:32] say clocks that they have start to go
[13:34] backwards that was a sign that God was
[13:35] really in his life and that God said
[13:37] that he was going to hear him so then
[13:40] when they saw that the that the sundial
[13:43] went backwards then they believed then
[13:45] they knew Oh
[13:46] God is really gonna heal us right so no
[13:48] after the third day Hezekiah gets better
[13:51] right and he's all fine he's got an
[13:53] extra 15 years right and if you were in
[13:56] Hezekiah shoes and you know that God
[13:58] added more time to your life what would
[14:02] you do right you think man I would serve
[14:04] the Lord I would do all the things I
[14:06] wouldn't witness I was tell people about
[14:08] God I'll tell people about Jesus I would
[14:11] live my best life right so that's what
[14:14] we're gonna think that Hezekiah
[14:15] well let's move on okay and in verse 12
[14:19] they said at that time there was a king
[14:22] of Babylon that sent letters and
[14:24] presents to Hezekiah for he had heard
[14:26] that Hezekiah was sick so the king of
[14:28] Babylon I remember the king of Babylon
[14:30] those people they were enemies to the
[14:32] people of Israel
[14:33] well that king when he heard that
[14:36] Hezekiah had was sick and he was gonna
[14:39] die they sent him letters and presents
[14:42] you know just you know to be all man
[14:45] we're sorry that you're sick right so he
[14:49] saw all the presents and stuff and you
[14:50] said hey guess what guys come come come
[14:52] come come come come
[14:53] well you think that one has a kind when
[14:55] he tells all these people from the from
[14:57] Babylon to come over maybe he's gonna
[14:59] witness to them maybe he's gonna tell
[15:01] them oh this is what God is that when I
[15:04] was sick and then he gave me an extra 15
[15:06] years of life and God is so good well
[15:10] let's move on alright verse 13 and
[15:13] Hezekiah hearkened unto them and showed
[15:15] them
[15:16] the house of his precious things the
[15:19] silver the gold the spices the precious
[15:22] ointment or the house of armor all that
[15:25] was found in his treasure there was
[15:27] nothing in his house nor and all his
[15:29] Dominion that Hezekiah showed them not
[15:31] oh so that's what Hezekiah decided to do
[15:34] instead of witnessing to them and
[15:36] telling them about the true God that
[15:38] healed him that did all these miraculous
[15:40] things for him about the Sun and the
[15:42] shadows going backwards about healing
[15:44] him giving him extra extra 15 years of
[15:47] life no he becomes proud right he says
[15:50] come look at all my treasures so he
[15:52] shows them all his gold sober off his
[15:56] spices everything that he has basically
[15:58] he exposes his own country to the
[16:01] enemies basically you're not really
[16:03] supposed to do that right you have an
[16:05] enemy you wouldn't really show them
[16:06] everything all your plans all your
[16:09] riches all your gold but if you look at
[16:11] Hezekiah as I kind of had become a
[16:13] little powerful he wanted to show them
[16:15] all his riches how good he was how great
[16:18] he would went in forgetting that who was
[16:20] the one that gave him all those riches
[16:22] who was the one that gave him all those
[16:24] spices and all those joint 'men sand all
[16:26] those armors and his big armies and his
[16:28] soldiers who was the one that gave it to
[16:30] him right it was the Lord and the Bible
[16:34] says that there was nothing that
[16:35] Hezekiah did not show to the to the
[16:38] people of Babylon well after doing that
[16:42] Isaiah came back to King Hezekiah and
[16:44] said hey who are these men and where did
[16:47] they come from what what are they doing
[16:49] here and Hezekiah you know what he said
[16:51] oh these are just people from a far far
[16:54] faraway land there from there from
[16:56] Babylon you know I was just showing them
[16:58] around you know giving them a little
[16:59] tour of my Palace and all the things
[17:01] that I had right and I say it was very
[17:04] very very disappointing and you know
[17:07] what he said you have shown them all of
[17:09] this all of this you have shown to them
[17:11] you can't even you know praise God or
[17:15] testify to God about the good things I
[17:17] had done and as I said in verse 16 and
[17:20] Isaiah said to Hezekiah hear the word of
[17:23] the Lord behold the days come that all
[17:26] that is in mine house and that which thy
[17:28] father has laid up in store unto the
[17:30] they shall be carried into Babylon
[17:32] nothing shall be let say the Lord verse
[17:35] 18 and of thy sons thou shalt issue from
[17:38] thee which thou shalt beget which which
[17:41] thou shalt beget shall they take away
[17:43] and they shall be Enix before the palace
[17:46] of the king of Babylon
[17:47] so basically Isaiah's telling them you
[17:50] see all these treasures all these things
[17:52] that you're showing to the to your
[17:54] enemies one day they're gonna come
[17:57] they're gonna take it away they're gonna
[17:59] take your sons gonna kick your daughters
[18:02] they're gonna take your people they're
[18:04] gonna take them and they're gonna make
[18:05] them their slaves live for God and
[18:08] showed him and live the way way that he
[18:11] promised God a beginning when he prayed
[18:13] I told God I'm gonna live for you I'm
[18:16] gonna do what's right all these things
[18:18] would not happen you see how his
[18:20] testimony just went down after God I
[18:22] gave him the desire now for us we don't
[18:26] know exactly what time God is going to
[18:29] take us away from this earth or whenever
[18:30] what time the rapture is gonna happen
[18:33] right we don't want to wait until the
[18:35] very last minute until we see oh how
[18:39] erections gonna happen oh maybe you guys
[18:41] taking you like oh I'm gonna die I need
[18:43] to make my life right no now is the time
[18:46] to live right right now was the time to
[18:48] do what is right whatever God tells you
[18:50] to do you want to do it you don't want
[18:52] to wait until you come into a situation
[18:54] until you feel like there's no hope and
[18:56] the only place you can run to is God you
[18:59] should have God all the way you know how
[19:01] we said put God first
[19:02] every time every day in your life not
[19:05] waiting a two-year go not wait until
[19:07] you're an older person then you're gonna
[19:09] say oh I'm gonna live for God then
[19:11] because you're never promised tomorrow
[19:12] you don't know when your is gonna be the
[19:16] time for you to go or when the rapture
[19:18] is gonna happen that's why at this time
[19:19] it's always good to pray and always good
[19:22] to surrender your life and to put your
[19:24] hope in Christ so like I we were talking
[19:27] in it please yes if there's a time to
[19:29] everything that's tempting
[19:30] a time to plant and a time to harvest
[19:33] right now as you guys are little you
[19:35] guys are young now is the best time
[19:37] because now you guys have the time on
[19:39] your hands when you guys get older
[19:41] you're gonna have work you might have a
[19:44] family you're gonna be busy but now is
[19:46] the time to live your life for God while
[19:48] you have the energy to serve God and to
[19:51] give your very very best don't give him
[19:54] your worst don't give him your you know
[19:56] the like right in the middle you know
[19:58] but give your very very best because I
[20:01] say most important because when God's
[20:02] gonna see it when he's gonna when your
[20:04] time is up he's gonna look at your life
[20:06] and you want to have that testimony said
[20:08] God I gave everything team I did my best
[20:11] for you right so basically that's the
[20:14] story of pace okay and I think Sharon
[20:16] had also something else today
[20:19] Thank You Shalom I hope you enjoyed that
[20:22] lesson I'm just gonna add a few points
[20:24] on to what Shalom said so we Shalom was
[20:28] telling us about time and we see the
[20:30] look of a quick eye cream yes he's
[20:31] talking to us about time there's a time
[20:34] for everything and even at our young age
[20:37] you still have time you know we can have
[20:38] the time to eat to play time to do
[20:41] homework but always remember that we
[20:44] have to have time for God and how much
[20:46] time also are we giving to God are we
[20:48] giving to God two minutes and then we
[20:51] give 5 hours to other things or how are
[20:54] we balance in that time we should give
[20:57] to God just as much time as everything
[21:00] else as something that's important to us
[21:03] because we can't spend our day let's say
[21:05] I spend five hours on my iPad playing
[21:08] games and then I'm like oh wait I need
[21:10] to give time for God so I'm going to
[21:12] open my Bible walk lake and I say let me
[21:14] read something so God knows God so loved
[21:17] the world done father god bless this day
[21:19] in it okay I gave time to God do you
[21:22] think that's really giving time to got
[21:24] enough time to God and giving God giving
[21:29] God that and importance in our life do
[21:31] you think God would look and be like oh
[21:32] yes this is my child he or she would
[21:35] spending time with me
[21:36] no because you're not blue prioritizing
[21:39] what you know given God his time
[21:41] so God loves to hear and you know when
[21:44] we pray for him when we spend time with
[21:46] him and that's why we should always give
[21:49] in that time to prayer and enough time
[21:51] to God enough time reading the Bible
[21:52] enough time you know studying the word
[21:56] memorizing even Bible verses because
[21:58] this is the Word of God which is our
[21:59] sword and also looking in the book of in
[22:04] the book of second Kings of the story of
[22:06] Hezekiah we don't know how much time we
[22:09] have on earth and the Bible tells us you
[22:10] know serve God in you so while we're
[22:13] still young this is the best time that
[22:14] we should say I want to give God my best
[22:16] and just like Hezekiah you know how Zac
[22:19] I was looking to know he had 15 years up
[22:21] or he feels about today but we don't
[22:25] know what can happen at Shalom said we
[22:26] don't know if the records gonna happen
[22:28] tomorrow but I was creating to just know
[22:30] that we have to always walk purely
[22:32] before God and we always have to you
[22:34] know if we make mistakes we always have
[22:36] to get ready to be ready to repent and
[22:38] ask for forgiveness for that and to make
[22:40] sure we're always ready because we don't
[22:42] know what can happen brother Branham
[22:45] says is he talks about prayer and he
[22:47] says prayer is the most powerful weapon
[22:49] that God has given to human beings so
[22:52] player is stronger than any he says any
[22:55] atomic bomb so we see like maybe and
[22:57] maybe in pictures and videos about war
[22:59] videos where we see like the bomb blows
[23:01] up in and ruin the whole area
[23:04] she said that prayer is stronger than
[23:06] any bomb she said that prayer can even
[23:08] change the mind of God and that's what
[23:11] happens here see God was about to so so
[23:14] that Hezekiah died but just because he
[23:16] prayed that's why God changed his mind
[23:19] he added 50 millions - hi Brooke hi his
[23:21] life so we know that prayer is just not
[23:23] a thing that was a god I just pray and
[23:25] whisper key words and hey let's prayer
[23:27] prayer is actually the most powerful
[23:30] thing that we ever have so that's what
[23:32] we want you to always be praying because
[23:34] there's many things ahead of us we don't
[23:36] know it can happen small but just
[23:37] because of our prayer God can spare us
[23:39] maybe we're gonna go out tomorrow a car
[23:42] accident was gonna happen but just
[23:44] because you prayed God hears our prayers
[23:46] and in teaching it can change his mind
[23:49] we also know that when you pray God sees
[23:52] our intentions right so we have to pray
[23:54] with the right intentions what are we
[23:56] praying for example excuse me what are
[23:59] we praying for well we are we are we
[24:01] always praying for us I don't think God
[24:03] bless me give me the best ipad with me
[24:07] the best iPhone give me
[24:10] bestest I can show off to my friends and
[24:12] when we pray for stuff like that you
[24:14] know that God
[24:15] these are intentions even if we don't
[24:17] say it openly but he sees our hearts and
[24:19] he sees what we're thinking so we're
[24:21] praying like that do you think God is
[24:22] really gonna be like oh yeah when he
[24:24] answered because we never know you know
[24:28] so God answers prayers where the random
[24:31] says God answers pray and if he doesn't
[24:32] give us what we asked for he's going to
[24:34] tell us why and he's gonna tell us you
[24:36] know the thing that you're asking for
[24:37] it's not the right time I mean she's
[24:39] gonna tell us the other thing that you
[24:41] you're asking for it it's not gonna help
[24:43] you out in life so God always gives us
[24:45] the answer when we pray even if it's a
[24:47] note it's still an answer from God and
[24:49] just learn how to accept it how do we
[24:52] pray do you just pray like I'm just
[24:54] gonna lay on my bed and you know I'm
[24:56] gonna lean back and just pray and to say
[24:58] I can't wait no you know when we pray we
[25:01] can also get on their knees and maybe
[25:03] show God that we're really surrendering
[25:05] to him and we live in talking to him and
[25:07] we're really humbling ourselves before
[25:08] him and we're really sincere
[25:11] so that's how we pray brother Branham
[25:14] when he was a little boy he didn't know
[25:16] how to pray so I know many of you know
[25:18] the story where he just wrote down the
[25:19] ABC then he pinned it on a tree and he
[25:21] said well God make up make up a prayer
[25:25] from all these words that I'm the
[25:26] alphabet I'm putting this paper even if
[25:29] we don't know how to pray the Bible
[25:31] teaches us how to pray I know that many
[25:33] of you already know the Lord's Prayer
[25:34] but sometimes go back over and just read
[25:36] over and kind of like me what does it
[25:38] mean because we started praying on our
[25:40] Father which I which art in heaven
[25:41] hallowed be thy name hallelujah music
[25:43] raised in the middle Lord and you know I
[25:47] will be done and all over that just go
[25:49] read over it and you'll see that's the
[25:51] structure that God teaches about him
[25:53] teaching us how to pray so we need alone
[25:55] how to pray when we know what we're
[25:57] praying for you to always stay in prayer
[25:59] and yeah that's all kind of I have to
[26:02] add the election said I hope you guys
[26:05] are still paying attention I know it was
[26:07] kind of long today but yeah
[26:10] hoping you guys enjoyed that lesson you
[26:12] receive something out of it yes we're
[26:15] just going to go ahead and close with a
[26:16] word of Prayer our pressure
[26:20] Heavenly Father we do thank you for
[26:22] another opportunity this morning to just
[26:25] come around and hear from to hear from
[26:27] you too but we read your word and to
[26:30] hear more from you Lord we pray that
[26:32] this little lesson that we heard in the
[26:34] Bible that we were to really become a
[26:36] reality in our lives so it may not only
[26:39] be just a Bible story that we're reading
[26:42] or button that we may also tie it to our
[26:45] lines and to learn how to number ID and
[26:47] to live our days when I use for your God
[26:50] power stored in our little capacity when
[26:52] I cannot be a big and natural old enough
[26:55] to do anything big for you but your
[26:57] purpose to serve you in the little ways
