because by ourselves we cannot do anything [Music] we came this morning based on the code that you have given us [Music] you say come to me you heavy laden [Music] [Music] you will completely destroy us [Music] [Music] good ideas are good merciless not going to help us anyway this morning is your word make it you push this guy that you descend this morning to your faith with your [Music] is [Music] take everything humility foreign is read your i didn't want to school as even my big brother once they told me you read much that is even if we cannot read the entire chapter but even a few verses every day he can help us that's the reason why we shall start with proverbs 22 verse 17 verse 20 21. 16 to 21. both languages french and english oh loud spanish do they say verse 16 so obadiah went to meet help and told him and he went to meet elijah and they come to bus he helps elijah the half said hunter him i thought he troubled israel any answer i have not troubled israel but thou in thy father's house in the trial for second the commandment of the lord and that has followed baha'u'llah now therefore sent and gathered to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets 450 and the prophet of the grove's 400 which eat at jezebel's table so helps it unto all the children of israel and gather the prophet together onto mankilmore and elijah came on to other people and said jesus along our team between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if he bow then follow him and the people answered him not a word there was chapitra sis second king verse six chapter six versi verse 24 and it came to pass after this that ben and that king of syria got her or resourced and went up and besieged somalia and there was a grave for me in somalia and behold the besieged until as his head was so for force called pieces of silver the fourth part of the cab of doves down for five pieces of silver and as the king of israel was passing by upon the war they cried the woman unto him saying help my lord o king and he said if the lord do not help thee when shall i help thee i love the bound flow oh heart of the one place and the king said hunt to her ahead of thee and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may hit him today and we will help my son tomorrow so we balled my son and did hit him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may hit him and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that would rent his clothes and it passed by upon the wall and the people looked and below he had sackcloth within upon his flesh god almighty merciful thank you for thy word who is it you for the scriptures in the name of jesus christ amen amen the name of jesus christ i hope you are doing well i also thank the pastor if somebody says something in the form or even a meme in the firm or even a woman who's a little job on the kid you'll still learn something even a child when he has something to say you will still learn something to bring back people a second to what our fathers they have done but through edges the worst was not finished and there was a grave [Music] is selma and jesus is our in jesus christ of latter day and himself there is not a man on the earth not even your pastor remember not even your father sell it do you have all that is when god sent both a message and tells the people and they don't receive it then you withdraw a servant and send if yes is oh by the year 1975 with the crisis that is happening right now is almost the same and you don't receive a service thank you that's a seller for me what comes next is famine la cruz crisis the malady uh plague this is the problem or after trouble and spiritually speaking physically your way of living can reject the prophets that's true 18. versus it personally when erica saw a lot of israel i say verse 20 elite demandment in our cup so here absent to listen for these guys so help sent down to all the children the prophet you're all the prophet together verse 22. i hear an eye horny remain of the prophet of the lord but there are 400 prophets of bell foreign uh and taking me taking god out of history raising him out of history and see those two big scenes lilly's elephant is dwight one is the end of history and one is the end of time brother we are at the end time yet the grandson [Applause] of that time natural light i love the la liga and to the dawn of the glory i can see we are living the glorious life that we ever give that has even been given to a man developed to live fastest elephants it is the end time and the contraction history is telling us what we have read find out today there is not so many tales of the history that is written because i don't think it will happen those great events oh go into the blending of everything example example i would deal with national crisis natural crisis and national security dancing he's running into a shadow of water indeed i travel around the world and we've tried everything that is seemingly humanly possible i don't believe that there is anything else we are just at the end of it panda enter for a while we try to have it it didn't work democracy then would be laid [Music] a grand degrees a great crisis like this than this agreement says even christ is in the church but i want to say no in the crazy delava it seems the armed life is running out of the swallow water don't lie down the families life is becoming weak foreign we don't see that anymore in the grand cruise or a great crisis in the grand greece a great crisis oh never please zela we don't see that anymore and at the end of the day [Music] became everything [Music] my dad doesn't use a cellphone until now venting paper in the 20th century my dad doesn't use a cell phone and my dad until now she hasn't believed the message my mother's child all of them are in the message one wasn't the message [Music] is a wonderful child accepts your name he was a wonderful child he is a wonderful child what why they say the secret is to read to read read he is very intelligent electricity he's very intelligent then last time he told me my son you need to read a lot that's the reason why it doesn't use the phone attention be careful telephone pencil even when they do the cell phone can't take us away from that work individually i don't want talking i use them economy limits but i know my limits information my ways of watching the news is different from others when i watch the news the trans minutes are from 30 minutes if it is allowed five juvenile delinquency certainly was a hard thing to find them boys all went to the field's work to remember that and the work is and the bible is laid back that's right in hell they have to earn for an hour to find one many home in what sorry in america it is around alegrias they go to church sunday morning for the religious panda and pay the feminists for about 20 minutes this deposit takes about 30 minutes [Applause] is cell phones that doesn't have a time manager mom no more what's up facebook what's up facebook and so far for the network but i can create love [Music] okay our field tree for the cedar is falling because the mighty are spoiled our oyu ox of bashan for the forest of the vintage is calm down the bible says what's that oh zakaris foreign it's very big that you cannot see that around it and when you fall down all those little trees they have to call that also me the bible says they sell out because of that what's that all the children will fall also i'm gonna join the other preacher that preached before me somebody has a problem he come and tells your brother you know i'm going through this and that case therefore what do you need to do situations tell that to another person you just need prayer says friends we have their not so loyal as before it used to be i remember when somebody was doing that in the neighborhood that everybody come around unless you sit down and try to help a crisis is taken over in the church somebody has troubles many appeal assistance but there is no assistance help each one is on and so keep this remember is caring for is on the good is to live for one another increased by remember than legally such crisis even the church i never for me oh he's not from a family in a party not a tribute oh he's not from a tribe constituted considerate the church lies in two commands that's why everything's nice life church is running out legion people are taking the church today always like an idol come on oh i don't know what is not only what god requires ken was very sincere the sacrifice but he didn't have the revelation is so sincere even even our work they'll do the same thing even they are very sincere versus don't have the same revelation we do have a sister to have somebody that's the reason why you need to understand your position and say it can be sincere by not having the revelation if appearing in a while in the city and listen to me between the lines i am very balanced in so many things and while we are standing here obviously watching these things at least for says [Music] or where are you going or what is happening right now the entire thing is running out basketball because men and women have become lovers of this present of this world is over this presence the great things about today would be to go home to read the bible it's the better of the things to do change things is one time my mother called me lady she said matthew g-i-d gotta helped susan huh susan now elected oh she she's pregnant the child will die i

living in the terrible time if we are not we should if you don't watch that's why it will be very terrible forever medium well what i'm saying now keep day they got a william brown knows me that's jamaica i'm not coming to the property to attack the children of god a commentary on it here they for some people there is a way to talk about something we can comment when you go above uh keep quiet is good we listen we listen and after that like we have said last sunday to overcome the diversity oh no didn't say oh no at them and say a daughter person because there are people that say the showcase of him yeah i'm going to come to the beginning i'm going to answer him back jennifer visa i didn't see that in the life of brother branham jennifer that's the reason why we need circumcision i'm gonna reach that point [Music] the good shepherd associate yourself with god in newspapers [Applause] i'm looking toward the one that made me a promise [Applause] no matter what your neighbor is going to be amen amen so because we have dropped those things no along lesson respects that the massacre follows that's exactly what he preached today out there the word the congregation preached to us won't compromise with any congregation yes sir and play the catherine by the jewish a godsend preacher clearly sentence that has the origin compromise with any congregation people don't want to hear the truth souvenirs remember it can bring you to death i'm going to read that to you what am i doing says well brother fishermen if anyone said yeah if anyway whoever planned the position you need to take position for god fit the limit do it now they plan the position if it is time to take possession from god dinner do it now you punch you go to church [Music] is like a goat so i don't know hey you know what is the works of the goats is to bring somebody to the slaughter it says your neighbor but you are following it after goats and so we are going so we are going over there and then brother espinoza who was with us down in mexico a few months ago we brought a move brother brown and all of us done and all of us down there where we had a marvelous time in the lord and brother espinoza was my interpreter such a lovely brother and was so nice to me and he wanted to know if i'd come over and owe them a mom's meeting a month's meeting well i just can't do that if my meetings is set up on a big scale well then it will be different i might be able to stay a month but work on a small scale not too much finance included in it no radio program no nothing else i feel free to go just where the lord will let me and drop in here and stay a few nights over there a few nights down near a few nights in a church wherever it might be it doesn't matter and i don't need nothing but just will close aware and say oh by the way some lady gave me a suit of clothes while i was here and i sure appreciate that my dear friends ever it was the lady back in the back god bless you it's no no that does that's the errors that's a lot of flesh for the good shepherd verse six chapter paragraph six le bomb belgian good shepherd fifty seven fifty seven i love six second fifty-seven okay we learn a lot of things by sheep if we just notice listen we learn a lot of things by sheep if we just notice them and watch their action and a ship is a sacrificial sacrificial animal little innocent fellow is totally helpless when he's lost i think that's why jesus lacking us onto sheep because the just can't seem to find their way around they have to depend on somebody leading them and they cannot lead one another they just won't do it and that goes to show me one thing if we are lacking to ship in god's heritage then we cannot lead one another we are helpless we got to depend on the great shepherd of the sheep yes the lord jesus and i noticed at this laundry house once someone was speaking to me about how this lord of the sheep and when they want the sheep to come out of the coral and grab the shoots where they kill the sheep a god leads them up there they'll follow the gods and this goat will lead them up to the place where the killing takes place and then it will jump over the side and let the ship go right onto their death that's just the nature of the goats and if a fellow doesn't know his ship real well listen carefully to about what i'm saying it's a goats a man in a baby oh it's brain and do they slaughter that's correct [Music] as a model as a role model not a model our role model is just because he's the lord jesus christ man or that person like this he'll bring him to the slotted house as the bible was talking about souvenir always remembers the ghosts bring the ship to the slaughter house okay and i'm gonna talk to you about it and i'm gonna talk to you about something it doesn't matter to me if my shoes along with my pants affect my vest oh if my pants go along with myself i need my experiences there is something to match your experience with much experience with amen i've accepted the poll with witch of paul ammon amen don't know that's what we need today it is time to match our experience with people of the bible so i'm not an example that's our example yes the true time of nature don't look to gather if you are a salt as you say come here act like a scent mouth shake on my answer uh i walk like a saint a beautiful common ancestor dressed like a saint pablo come tell that's true we have reached the zero nearly umvia legless will come to church oh not the problem we have problems instead of committing those problems to the hands of god no no no legion is allah people are out there i'm gonna find shortcuts a ship doesn't do this will not have a victim watch i'm just going there to do my religion and it will be over
