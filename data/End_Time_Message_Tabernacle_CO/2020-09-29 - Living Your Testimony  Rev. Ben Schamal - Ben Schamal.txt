[Music] familiar scripture and while you're turning i just wanted to say thank you to brother fosten in the church for another opportunity to be here they wrote me a very nice note downstairs oh my and uh i don't think i'm i'm worthy of such kind words so we just want to say we appreciate it amen so revelations starting chapter 12 apocalypse let's start with verse 7 and it reads like this and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony like to title it living your own testimonies and we see that there are very many temptations out in the world and the devil is very clever and how he distracts us from our own testimony he's creating distractions and temptations not only young people but old people to distract ourselves from our own testimony amen amen so i want to focus on living your own testimony hey man brother branham said this world is going completely insane uh and i think we can see that so clear today you don't know whether what you read online is true or if it's false oh it's a full or someone that you might be talking to oh you don't know if your opinion may be true or if it may be false but we have one whom we can trust we have a word that is always true and we praise the lord for that we praise the lord for a prophet that would come down show us the spirit that is behind it that is secretly dividing the people we have a very prominent catholic spirit today that is moving up among the earth that if you don't do this writer don't do that they're trying to divide different races they're trying every angle they can divide and we can see it out in the world but i think we need to look at ourselves in the church that's happening out there the devil isn't going to leave us alone but the devil [Music] so the devil is trying to distract us by using all these different things we see the politics the sickness the discontentment it's all to get our eyes he can't get your eyes on on politics then he will try something else maybe he'll try to get your eyes on another brother maybe he has such a great test i wish i had a testimony amen the scriptures say in second timothy 3 it says and know this also that in the last days perilous times shall come amen can we identify with that scripture perilous means difficult or hard times so in the last days difficult times shall come there we are without natural affection that's homosexuality that's homosexuality and have we ever seen a time in the history of the world where this has become so prominent where sinners are so unashamed to come out of the closet and show forth all of this sin and faith something that the lord hates homosexuality is a spirit and if you uh maybe we think oh this this isn't in the message amen amen without natural affection true space false accusers incontinence that word means lack of self-control we see that in the world today people just can't seem to control themselves fierce despisers yeah those that are good traitors lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god i mean developed you having a form of godliness well this is where we're going to drive it down now having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof i have a form of godliness [Music] uh just politics and how how the world is going to come and and and it's gotten to where the president of the united states is going to ban this app he said it's an app i guess where you can have short videos and you can lip sync like singing or all these famous people or or different i guess they had a wipe challenge where you wiped this way and you're your and then you wipe this way and you turn into something completely different what is it they're trying to be someone else they're trying to be something that god has not made them is they say that they're trying to be some famous singer because they said that to our ancestors some great somebody okay can come instead of living in the channel that god had directed amen we don't use that word very often what does the word pharisee mean he said in greek it means an actor someone who acts many times people are trying to act like the other fellow bless your followers it says listen you quit trying to act like that next fellow and just act out your own convictions and you'll get along you see so many little children going to a picture show the cinema and they come back and want to act like the actress what does brother branham say he says shame on you the american people through television they have seen so much of the put on his own v-book [Music] till they become put on themselves that's too bad and we get it in church please amen and he goes on to talk about how some people come up and they'd like to do specials until their face turns blue uh they they hold he they hold their note when they're singing until their face turns blue why because they're trying to be something instead of just worshiping god and then when they come off the platform they're not thinking about praising the lord they're not thinking about his goodness but they're thinking of who they may have impressed me the city is all important because they could hold such a note what a wrong attitude attitude what a thought process okay that we are trying to steal the glory of god in the message my angel shall go before thee brother branham says jeremiah the prophet god said before you was even formed in your mother's womb i knew you and sanctified you see gifts and callings are without repentance god gives them you can't help cause you have you can't help because you have blue eyes taking thought can add one cubit to his stature amen he says therefore the thing has got down into the world today with a bunch of isms and it is it's absolutely absolutely and he's going to nail it on the head right here he says it's nothing but a work of satan try to take away from the real thing of god amen i hope we can see that this morning so we see that us trying to put on uh they said that you must live your own amen amen god has put you here for a reason it's a very specific reason you guys don't specific and the only one that can fulfill that right so we know that there is a very high importance of having a personal testimony as young people a lot of times we base our our uh spirituality on our parents spirituality brother branham said we must have a time in our life and we can point the devil amen amen look at an example in the scripture here we look at the story of david uh david was one of many brothers he was possibly the smallest of all of his brothers [Music] maybe he stood shorter he didn't have the big muscles he maybe felt insignificant significant why because they had gone off to war girl they had the uniforms they stood so tall oh is it this year they were fighting for the country david was patriotic too oh david you wanted to do the same you've lost your fellow members what was he doing [Music] it was a difficulty that arose in his everyday life something arose in his life okay david was building his own testimony amen amen his own personal testimony amen and and i want you to realize that if david had his eyes on someone else he was trying to be something that god has noticed [Music] if he was trying to be the joker in in solomon's court oh see they say that's when david would not have that testimony david because he was trying to blaze his own trail instead of walking the trail of life that god had chosen and god doesn't call amanda judgment without first warning [Music] and this is a paragraph starting 35. and that reason that he has put us here foreign he says you should go to him and find out what he wants [Music] how many times do we want to just do something so big i want to show that yeah that may not be what god has for your life like brother branham maybe your purpose in life is to vacuum the carpets not everyone is supposed to be a a preacher behind the pope there's a very very wise man that said oh yeah i know preach always use words when necessary each one of us should have a personal testimony and living life you will preach that testimony a man a man 37 brother branham says firecraft wants it for one md you say well the trouble of it is would it be each one of us wants to do the next man's job we all want to pack the ball up he's talking about football there's one ball and eleven men on each side if everyone wanted to carry the ball but someone has to get the ball off the ground and hand it to the quarterback and then the quarterback hands it to a running back and if the offensive line is la lino they just want to have the ball they just then they're going to tackle the running back hello alvanta clayton so he goes and tackles the running back foreign 39 brother braham says and that's the way it is with people we've all the body of christ has got to be in their position every man that's come on the face of the earth has to answer to god for our responsibility and too many of us a stewardship we have to answer for uh that's right if it's to be a farmer you've got to answer to god he says but if we all just find our calling in god and abide there god knows just when to use us and how to use it and we don't want to be jumping around here and there but where god puts you be original be just what god wants you to say so we see david if david was trying to run around i don't know i don't want to be a sheep i want to be uh uh um uh some great uh uh warrior in the army well maybe i want to be somebody that's that's just really funny and that everybody likes uh and he's off doing uh different social gatherings instead of counting the he would have been out of the will of god david was faced with a goliath's life he was ready for the task because he was unknowingly preparing himself oh pascal in city pancakes this is such a hard trial no one in the world has faced corona how are you going to open it what was david's response to david well it was it i i feel that i'm just so strong oh my trust is in my sling oh my confidence i'm such a good shot oh i i feel like i can take the devil on oh [Music] that he could recognize was not his own doing but it was god leading him to a certain point and he could say god you delivered the bear i i didn't tell my hand looks can you imagine if if he would have uh if david would have come up to goliath relying on moses's testimony and instead of going down to the brook and grabbing five smooths he goes to the woods and he grabs us a stick oh hmm allah he walks up to goliath and he taps that stick uh no he points the button and he says leave my people and no less what do you think the devil would have done yes i think he would have done the same thing that the devil did in acts 19. cause paul was going around casting out all these devils and someone else wanted to live paul's testimony took up to them to call over which had evil spirits in the name of the lord jesus christ saying we adjure you by the jesus jesus whom paul preaches oh no we enjoy you i love you by jesus who paul preached he was trying to live the testimony that paul had said and verse 15 says and the spirit answered and said obviously jesus i know paul i know but who are you this man didn't have his own personal testimony he's trying to live the testimony of paul knows that jesus is right he knows that paul is and he's trying to cast out the devil maybe they say on someone else's testimony that won't work the goliath in your life must be overcome by the david in your heart oh about by the david in your apartment it can't be overcome by anyone else and we think oh this man was just so silly if we were to say the same scripture [Music] in today's world maybe someone would come and say devil we adjure you in the name of jesus christ see it doesn't sound so far off now allow someone somebody but you're relying on the testimony that brother branham had [Music] to cast out all of these things because i'm a message believer but you have to go away no no no we must have a personal test because they're not afraid of of paul when he's off far away cast him out in the name of paul or whatever it doesn't matter they know who he is but amen we must have our own personal testimony so i hope that we can see where we're at today all of these distractions are to get our eyes off of our own personal testimony would we be so worried about what brother so-and-so is doing disagree with this we can't look at others we have to look at ourselves when he's got the edge on you he likes to boast and carry on like that oh he gives a big boast oh i love you so every one of them hello all of them big degrees uh two seconds goliath comes up and he starts making this big boast why because the the israelites were feeling small pascal israel they didn't have just a big revival inaudible but they had been uh fighting and fighting music and they felt weak and they felt small this is a song to pity and see that is when the devil likes to make it did you ever notice 40 is the number of temptations what year are we living in 2020 don't read too far into that but i think we can all agree that we're in the year of temptation brother it happened to fall on the wrong ear that morning praise the lord this is one of my favorite verses since you we think our basketball players are tall no the basketball song there's six eight are you some questions imagine nine feet three inches are you imagining big huge man contomo and he wasn't skinny along your dipper he was a big man and he could crush you and he is making a big boast but it it it fell on the wrong ears that morning because a little four foot eight four foot nine little man the height he knew where he stood because david had a confidence in his testimony it didn't matter if it was a nine foot three six [Music] but god made you we've still got david's too lord amen amen so we must learn to profess our testimony when david was questioned about his faith what did he do he didn't say well i just know that i can take him off the lord's really done some things for me in the past so i know that he'll do it again which is good but he was professing his testimony and i i've got a scripture that we'll get to here in a little bit i love but the testimony of jesus christ jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy the prophecy brother branham says in perfect faith he says now many of you will be waiting over till morning and he talks about how people drove so far to see him and paragraph nine he says epoch of nephrogenesis and i get spells too you know hello see i get moody i get to a spot where it gets me oh jaggery i get [Music] all night [Music] he says i put that right back in his the devil's face and say what about that that helps me to overcome some maida vancouver what about that amen i think we can adopt that one what about that amen amen when the devil comes and tries to make his boss oh connie we could say well what about this dude amen he tries to hit you with corona not only do people love me but god loves me not only does he love me but he died for me not only did he die for me to redeem me but he made me his bride hallelujah maybe he's trying to take you with cancer the cancer is gone what about that maybe he's he's trying to tell you that you can't have children i love somebody because all life comes from god but he looked back where god had intervened what about that devil yes i am as a sinner yes i've done many backgrounds that god is a savior he has redeemed me what about that what is the devil going to do then david went back to his testimony saul says how are you going to overcome david hello you're so small you won't take my armor this number is so big everyone else is afraid of your temptation it seems like you can't overcome us assembling solitaire it was just me out living my normal life and a trial came my way uh and god brought me through it i chased that lion down he threw you can't stop halfway through when you get a partial victory people still pay a mission i have overcome this one time david could have stopped right there picked up his sheet and went home guess what would have happened the next day the lion would have come right back stole the same sheep and david would be doing it but we must have complete deliverance holy to the lord so when he hits that line with the stones he drops the sheep david ran to him grab the lion amen if we look at the the noun of testimony what the actual word means we are giving our testimony to another brother when we're giving our testimony back to the devil what does it it's i think testimony is a very big weapon the whole scriptures when you look back was filled with moses told the children of israel over and over and over again so tell your children and your children's children it was on funding tell them what the lord has done for you always be speaking those good things did you hear him say i've ever wanted you should tear down the preacher and you should tear down the deacon if you don't like amen amen praise the lord so it's important that we have a testimony and it's important that we profess that testimony amen brother branham said that no child of god is going to go around walking around saying oh i lost my healing [Music] i had the holy ghost but i i think i lost i'll measure this way a child of god's not going to do that no no proverbs 18 and 21. says death and life are the in the power of [Music] a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit it is free how many times do we catch ourselves saying negative things [Music] negative and for what do those negative things really help us out negative but no it it creates a breach in the spirit that creates bitterness it creates separation it creates division amen brother branham says in accepting god's gift only he said now healing's not something that you'll just say oh well yeah i believe it uh he said no that's all right but that if that's the best you can do he said just [Music] say it out loud why would i say because if i say i am healed he had the razor he was going to start shaving and his eyes pop open why because the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy amen amen so say it out loud hallelujah hallelujah just keep saying i'm healed i'm healed say it until actually you believe it if you can't even believe it yourself you can't believe yourself that you are healed then say it and say it and say hello amen don't be ashamed of the gospel no but say i am healed yesterday until you believe just a second and listen to what brother branson and he says and when you believe if you come for that then it's going to take place don't have a negative test negative every time when you confess well i still feel bad today you go straight back in the same rut i believe [Music] [Music] is so that's what we're doing this is a second we're identifying scenarios and his tricks and we're saying we will overcome it because i don't use my tests i've had this weapon in my pocket i've had a testimonial since the moment i was born i was already one in a million i came to life you gave me life i've had a testimonial then why wouldn't there could be entire sermons preached on on words two words because god had given him a testimony very familiar scripture here and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see that i'll do it for i am my fellow servant and of thy brother have the testimony of jesus worship god he said for the testimony of jesus christ but the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophet prophecy so if we are not professing a testimony of jesus then how are those things ever going to come to pass and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony maybe you have a great testimony then you must find out what you're testing tell other people what the lord has done for you it used to be that people all the time when they were at church coins they would ask what has the lord done for you secretary um well i remember a tick tock video uh but i can't remember what the lord's done for me um satan's done a pretty good job is that distracting us what's important amen do we see that hebrews 11 5. and enoch was translated that he should not see death i think and was found not oh you need to point because god has translated what a testimony if you don't have another testimony that you can tell other people is that i am a christian and i please the lord with what i do what an incredible testimony [Music] it wasn't i was a drunk says for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith that scripture is saying we overcome educators by faith when you become a child of god you can overcome the world verse five oh who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god if your testimony is that i believe that jesus christ is the son of god christians all you know foreign you can overcome that testimonial will overcome any goliath do we see how powerful our testimony praise the lord first john 4 4. ye are of god little children so if you're building your testimony and all i know is that jesus christ is the son of god and the son of god lives in me then i can overcome anything amen but overcome if you wake up grouchy in the morning in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good be of good cheer me because i have overcome the lord god has already overcome the world he that overcometh shall inherit all things uh [Music] it didn't say he that overcometh shall inherit everything but healing to choose my son or he that overcometh shall inherit all things but a good job will allow me to be on in church i love you but that shows the greatness of god the resurrection of jesus 56. jesus christ i'll read this one more close it's only see brother branham said if you notice it's when you're discouraged when the devil can really pour it on you if you come to church and say well i don't know souvenir visit is the branch and super i don't know if it'll ever get better or not i've been prayed for twice [Music] i've already been prayed for twice just go home you're going to hinder those around you come to the throne [Music] we underestimate the power of god it boggles my mind sometimes just looking at grace you can always see how god can bestow grace on other people and she's welcome on youtube on ourselves and go how could god love me how could god give you me no more we don't understand what i've done well you might as well just go home but when you can cast that aside listen listen i'm preaching it myself right here oh julius crush there's people that don't even know i smile there's somebody came up to my sisters one time and says he's always just so serious see i don't just preach it you guys i preach it myself i think that happens all the time doesn't it brother foster when you're preaching you're preaching because because of an experience that's happening in your life but we ought to be happy god doesn't want us to feel beaten yeah he doesn't want us to feel like we can't overcome it but he wants us to feel that we can overthrow and if we can overcome listen [Music] don't never be upset in this way just walk in his love amen knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing that can harm you there's no powers things present things future nothing can separate us and we'll never come in by so that's his business to take care do you think little kids running around are worried if their parents are going to take care of them because they know their parents love them they expect for their parents to take care of it they expect their parents tell them get dressed [Music] right it's time for breakfast it's time for lunch god will take care of his children when he calls you we're going to give you enough nutrition so it's his business to take care of swan no man can pluck them from my father's hands personally because he's the greatest of them all possibly who's got any more power than god yeah no one right son so what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you quiet i think we can be happy over that one we could read that one line we're going to just lose do we see how satan can so influence our own lives amen that took the solar system [Music] [Applause] i think we can all be happy and praise the lord this morning [Music] that we have a loving father and that he's given us a testimony he's given us a big weapon contact a concealed weapon oh and contaminate that we can use against the devil any time you could be working working working and doesn't have to be anything bigger those but we must build our own testimonials and have faith that god loves you he's watching over you let's bow our heads dear gracious heavenly father lord we just thank you for another opportunity that we could come and read your
