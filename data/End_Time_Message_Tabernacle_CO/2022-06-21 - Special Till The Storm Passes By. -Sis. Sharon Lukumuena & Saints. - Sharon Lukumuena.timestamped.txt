[0:01] [Music]
[0:11] out on the waters a storm raging high
[0:20] the waters are round
[0:25] travelled at night and fear filled their
[0:32] hearts and they thought they would die
[0:38] but they fail to
[0:43] like the master
[0:48] he spoke the word
[0:52] and the winds all stood still even the
[0:59] water
[1:01] they obeyed his will and he come there
[1:08] stone just like he will mind if I just
[1:16] streaming
[1:18] bird that he lives deep inside
[1:24] should I worry why should I fear when
[1:33] the very same Jesus he stays always he
[1:42] lives in my heart and he hears when I
[1:50] I called on his name till the storm
[1:55] passes by

[2:44] we read in the Bible how he walked
[2:50] through them brought light to their
[2:55] darkness when the way grew slowly
[3:02] how great it would be to have his tax
[3:07] lien
[3:09] in mine and to walk with
[3:13] stuff
[3:15] Oh
[3:19] when trials come
[3:23] and F is
[3:28] I just search for the master he said
[3:33] he'll be there on time and when I'm in
[3:39] trouble
[3:40] and my body isn't a
[3:45] all I have to do
[3:49] is car
[3:52] on his name
[3:58] and why should
[4:01] see
[4:02] when the very same Jesus he stays always
[4:09] me he lives
[4:13] my
[4:13] [Music]
[4:16] when I cried I called on his name
[4:23] till a star passes by
[4:28] so why should I
[4:33] and why should I fear when the very same
[4:40] Jesus he stays always near he lives in
[4:47] my heart any tears when I cry I call on
[4:56] his name till the storm passes fine

[5:06] and why should I see when the very same
[5:13] Jesus he stays always me he lives
[5:21] [Music]
[5:23] and here's when I cry I call on his name
[5:31] till the storm passes by
[5:37] I call on his name
[5:44] till the storm passes by
[5:50] [Music]
[5:55] [Applause]
