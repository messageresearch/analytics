specialization so he has to be with us to see how the sound system is working we may have equipment but we need to know how to take the maximum benefit of those equipment so that's his job I think we will uh be blessed after with his advices amen and there is also brother muttula matabisu graduated [Applause] so he was the only boy among those who were singing special is usually in this church men don't sing please men are quiet they say he cast the stone somewhere yeah among the girls there was only one boy that was so congratulations to the graduates it's the grace of God made the same Grace lead you for your future amen amen so we have also Thanksgiving Shalom from Brother no way I'm thinking I thank the Lord Jesus for my healing [Applause] remember last week he was in a hospital but God gave him Grace he is out uh that's why he thank god sister pascaline libuanga that is children they want to thank the church for your support physical financial and during the passing away of her mother yeah uh few announcements the first one is uh there is a pastor from lubumbashi Pastor Gabi kyungu yeah who passed away here they said I remember when I was in lubumbashe I did not have a chance to meet with him country but he's in mid 50s um God decided to take him home enjoy this daily Amazon living a congregation he had a wife with children is how far in a position so if you go there and remember him and his family is so after church since we are gonna have a fellowship downstairs for Border Motorola's graduation is and I would like to have a short meeting in the meantime with the ashes because uh I will be traveling it will be for a little bit longer will go to home to visit and Israel and Israel and then after Israel I will take a vacation so I would like the ushers to step up and take care of the remaining of the thing with the help of our ministers who will be here um you will be also very very challenging because the brother never here will be gone but Emmanuel will be gone we will have only brother Neville piano friends everywhere it will be the only interpreter unless God provide a miracle maybe brother Vincent oh it's okay if they say like that it's the way they say yeah we have always to double up certain places so that uh everything works the way it should be okay and also on the musician ah there will be also some Gap but I believe God but I think brother Jose ilunga will be already back by the end of the months he went to Congo to celebrate the birth of his uh first daughter celebrate yeah so you we will need a little bit of coordination so that everything works the way it's supposed to be okay yes and for those going to home and Israel in Israel I think everybody got his uh tag foreign but the key things is when you go there you may need to take some cash with you baby brother George always said about 500 for your little things to maybe to buy with a short specials yeah and uh also the power outlet in Europe is different from here so what you will use in home will be different from what you will use in Israel it will be better to look already maybe uh Amazon or whatever it is image also I think uh brother this time did this last time brother Emmanuel was out featherstonculla to take the offering and the money that will be given to go make the deposit to the bank the plan is amen amen and also this week was he said cement we will have the visit of a pastor Albert visit he has been here since uh the beginning of the month but uh to make him to come he has a lot of schedule he came for the graduation of his daughter eleven collection disaster we keep postponing so finally he will be here that willing on Tuesday [Music] so I have asked him if he can allow uh to have services on Wednesday this Wednesday and we are going to add another day Friday and he will finish on Sunday in Buffalo the match it is a very very good preacher and we want to take benefit of it today Advantage he's the one who taught me to beat somebody in and out it is when I told him passage this to beat me to beat me in and out yeah so uh make sure that uh you support him blessings amen amen and uh I have a lot of announcements last last Wednesday it was a masterpiece from Bad uh so this morning it's a matter we are going to have a banaya dedication and before we do the dedication of this baby I want to give a little testimony that's the reason why I want to preach this morning on the seven compound names of Jehovah they are proposed they said no compose over I think in uh September last year I heard I think I told the church dream stay with me all night and I came to church it was the time I was preaching on the Plan of Redemption today Redemption but very often things happen we don't want to talk about it in detail before our conditions but it was so real to the extent I was wondering should I preach on the seven compound names or should I continue on this area on the series replanted Redemption the Seven Seals oh they said so so uh I believe whatever God does even in so simple always give him thanks testify and praise him these things started a while you know sometimes I observed people the first of the age of cellulation they had Julian Emmanuel they have a baby the baby grow up the baby are grandi and uh until one day I asked them ready Monday where is the next one um they say wow it's not coming it's only born in a vampire and I let them go and uh I started to prayer and you know there are prayers and prayers and it was the same time I was watching sister Gracia and the sister foreign pastor we have trouble to get the second one those have only two brothers it's a gun and found every time we conceive other conception at this time we are coming to you to pray for it but when you give a request like that um it's like you are putting the pastor on yeah I don't know how to qualify the positions it was really a huge burden Lord why this is now you have allowed them to come to me my name is so that this can go forward it was every day among many problems I have uh brother when it's not just for wasting of times we may be victim of a lot of distractions and stay away from destruction they are people with huge needs and problems you may not know yeah when somebody just give you a pastor pray for me for this I am in a big debt yes and you don't know how I cry to God because of the situations and then the thing went on and the day since the journey gave birth it was a relief and then I turn again to Julia and Emmanuel without talking to them at that time I was wondering if they could have a problem since the first child of the premium song but now maintenance if see it doesn't come she said not that they wanted but they want to have child and not confirm but nothing is coming and it became a burden it's a definition and remember in September it was the time my wife Emmanuel Julia they traveled to congoose and I was born with my mother-in-law and Sharon was always saying dad come eat my place very often I don't want to go to their places but one day she impressed me so much impression and like because they know that I like breakfast after pressure one of the Saturday Sunday I accepted and I went he accepted I remember it was September 2022. on the 17th City lady said went to the house we ate you know so she said and I asked them also what's going on we don't know there is no problem yeah okay problem and we finish I do remember about uh one o'clock one P.M they could not notice what happened in my heart I was almost crying I left the home coming straight to church I said Lord what is this I have so many problems in the church but you cannot realize bear with me a little bit um there is the little boy God sankai yeah his problem also is on my heart so problem extreme okay one day sure after church I pray the grace I see a little boy coming here pastor Pastor God is calling you God tape I went to the car this is a reason about you you know every other kids they play outside but God is locked in the car God great and foreign thinks that as I say bear with me something I don't want to even say it yeah but sometimes you pray you may see a black sheep on certain conditions and you try to understand what this kind of answer a lot they may not compound the question or the responses you have to speak because you are God of God always speaks if we are not connected this is where we don't get the answers that will talk to you and if God talked to you you don't pay attention to the attention it's your problem Brother Richard Bridge here I don't remember what word he was using uh you have to separate the man and the office something like that sometimes you get used to the person at the moment he can tell you something but he didn't show us you take it lightly it can be God giving you the answers that's why coming to church you have to be in a certain atmosphere atmosphere certain atmosphere to get into the dimension of God to hear what God is going back to the story I left Sharon's home to the church that was the night I came I came early around 2PM here uh until maybe five o'clock in the morning I was reading praying crying I say Lord why I have cases in the church here where people cannot give birth when they want to uh the problem is and you know the cases the problem was available and then around five o'clock in the morning mental I was on the secondary matter I was so tired and I said let me rest a little bit I think I slept for 45 minutes or an hour as a social and I believe it was God telling me medicine I am Jehovah Jara if I'm Jehovah I'm alsoever Shalom I see you are so worried but man I want to tell you the problem you are concerned about the problem and I have the seven compound names said to know composite is over we stay with me it was like a dream when I wake up it was like shaking comments take away and there are some other more details they tied the place and when I came to the platform that Sunday uh the platform City martial I started talking I did not want to tell it to the church but it was so pressing questions until I said something do you remember that for those who don't remember who selected since they hope if you can give that portion of the video yesterday I came a little bit early then usually yeah [Music] I was really with a big desire of praying for foreign foreign you know and I want to tell you about your sister I feel this if you have a problem your sausages [Music] a lot of detail but to me was that the key from Washington is seven redempt Redemptive names I was already when I wake up it was about six or something like foreign [Music] [Music] he will answer amen amen amen so I'm gonna stick with uh my plan so I'm gonna so this is really uh I was searching for that video to see exactly what I said video and when I was speaking to the church I did not know what is going to happen but man I want to tell you this you know sometimes when you are praying the followers God has already given a solution two or three days after I spoke to the church Julia called me from Congo uh Daddy I'm expecting for me it was it um I said if you are the same Jehovah Jara if you can solve one problem you will solve everyone it's up to each one of us to catch the vision vision and then she came back and then uh we have been observing the growth until when the baby was born the rest she will maybe uh arrested sing and praise the Lord as they ever requested to do so and I said to myself the day I'm gonna consecrate that baby that's the day I'm gonna preach on the seven Redemptive names everybody's Faith must be up foreign [Music] is gonna be God must answer there should be no problems for which God has no answer okay that's your God but the god of William Branham William Branham always speaks and uh that's why this morning for inspiration whisper in my heel she shot the Holy Ghost has to talk to you directly the sentence amen amen so let us turn to the scripture as uh the parents who I want to bring the little benign Deputy down far to knowledge Matthew chapter 9 you may be seated for the dedication of the baby my 2 19 verse 13 Matthew then they uh then wear their boat unto him little children that he should put his hand on them and pray I thank you and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not foreign [Music] [Music] what are you doing here what are you doing here shall we pray dear heavenly father yeah we want to thank you for the life that you have given to the tomorrow's family foreign [Music] to be one of your servants protecting potentially protect also the parents give them means to educate him and to provide to his needs one As We Lay hand upon him our hands are nothing no Menace but they are just a representation of your holy hands as you touch him let him be blessed for all his days long on this Earth in this world of challenge let him be an exception the swine exception we give him to you in Jesus Christ we dedicate him to you amen amen paper [Applause] and you have your specials special yourself may God bless you I just want to thank God and for all he's done for us with a song they can project you on my rock [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] again [Music] I call out to you again [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] freezing you alone [Music] [Music] you with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] God bless you [Music] thank you [Applause] man if I know we are gonna open our Bible the Book of Genesis Genesis chapter 22. from the first to verse and it came to pass after the things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac wound thou loveest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which I will tell you I will tell the of the Phantom face is and Abraham goes up early in the morning and settle his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clear if the wound for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God has told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off hey and Hebron said unto his young men abide ye here with the eyes and I and the Lord will go Yonder and worship and come again to you uh listen to this verse 5. Abraham telling his uh servant Abrams you stay here just me and the light just we are going up Beyond it to worship and come again to you but God told Abraham to go over the sun into sacrifice how did Abraham said we are going and we are coming back again verse 6 verses and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together foreign and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering office [Music] your son asking you such a question is promise and Abraham said my son office God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God has told him off and Abraham built a altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and led him on the altar upon the wood he is [Music] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here I am and he said lay not thy hand upon the land neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearst God seeing thou as not withheld thy son thy only son for me tonight [Music] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the ticket by his arms and Abraham went and took the RAM and opened him up for a burnt offering in the state of his son says and Abram called the name of that place Jehovah as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen amen if he was Jehovah Jireh back then he is still the same Jehovah he can bring things into existence immediately shows an existence he takes your faith let us also turn to Psalm 46 Allah see some currencies just the second verse Psalm 46 verse 2 some currencies were said I don't know if it's a different as you say try first one yeah so it's a verse one in English and verse two for those reading French God is our refuge and strength not a force a very present help in trouble may the Lord bless the reading of the world as I said I want to speak on the seven compound names of Jehovah commission no composite is over and for inspiration the full inspiration whisper in my ear and she shot them is all right the Holy Ghost has to talk to you directly brother we don't come to church just uh to see others but I believe we want to come to church so that God Can Explain we are coming with our needs and we have a living God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he will always answer that doesn't mean he will always give yourself [Music] foreign [Music] and our paper we have to clean up ourselves take care of the channel brother taking care of the channel to understand you cannotize I have to work with God I have to be Constitution and I have to remove from my heart my thoughts say anything that is important work is our country even a negative result negative I don't want it I'd have to stand against it we call it the channel maintenance amen amen because we may think because we have received the message everything should be fine and we have all kind of dust in our house all kind of nonsense in our hearts when we are living at the top of the pyramid fraternal we have to fight Fitness regardless of what somebody has done unto you have to love that because it would be a selfish thing if a man's heart isn't out to save his brother there is something wrong with his heart we have to love one another regardless if you love somebody because she has done good to you since you have not done much if you read Matthew Chapter 5 the Bible says if you do that good you greet only those who greet you yeah you do good only to those who do that foreign [Music] and now we have a people so the same message we have them as enemies regardless of the differences differences in whatsoever it is no only perfect enough only perfect we'll enter and this message we have gone from the faithful very true I am too proud of the Lord and we have to manifest that that is we don't want to uh take advantage of our brothers sisters but we want to listen their burden elsewhere those who are weak yeah you don't want everybody to be at your level if God has to save you this is important condition if he's the brother hates me him if he's a spider is against him can subscribe shall continue if his brother try everything he can to tear him down because yet that man's heart pulls for his brothers he can't help it there is something in there donkey that just calls out oh my God oh my friend you are hungry but I want you to be safe with everything that's in you possible do the best brother if that will be our motive and objectives we will bear for one another there will be no differences because he goes to the stability insurance we will be Beyond above the church there will be no people for no reason teaching churches to cheat what are you looking for in your apartment [Music] changes first in order for you to love you want another okay you don't need a church you try everything that's in you do you say that you still possibility to get your brother to believe with all of his heart they say they can take a minute [Music] there will be wrong things if the love of God is in you will bear with that person oh no I don't like this everywhere you will find three kind of Believers even if you go to the Branham town and this is where Branham preached the three kind of Believers that's the kind of meeting we want to have every time amen amen that's the purpose of our God but the devil Diablo is the one causing all the things even between husband and wife he puts hatred those people who said one time I love you now the love is not existence going back to paragraph 18 this is where I want to start my message when he created this the Bible paragraph 18 paragraph is it now again from here we want to make our quotation this is written out on the envelope here that I carried very often the preacher they get the inspiration lost his own inspiration any paper they find in the podcast they write it down right verses put it on the envelope foreign [Music] is made up in these seven Redemptive names of his amen and you know number seven is the accomplishment the relationship for the accomplishment we have to step in church ages [Music] seven mystery and these seven seven seven is also in the seventh Redemptive name of Jehovah and it is this how you have to worship this is how you have to call him upon the sins there's seven compound names to be spread in the audience each one of you taking one that coincide with your conditions [Applause] not just for knowledge is complete in the seventh compound names completely segment composite to satisfy all our needs to serve all our problems if you are sick if you are worried if you are discouraged if you have a problem solve a problem whatsoever he is coming to us this morning in the seven compound name continue God his attitude to all the people from Eden uh so 92. then back to Eden the pillar and then is wrapped in this seven Redemptive names and continue that says that says the first one being Jehovah which means the Lord will provide a sacrifice nowhere whatever needs one if you need something let me tell you even if you need a house he has a house he can provide the house the credit score can be lost [Music] their money cannot be there no income if you need a house he can have a company build the house because God is directing they need it to you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] hello hello the Lord will provide a sacrifice the second one is Jehovah the Lord the Healer which he said in the storm 103 verse three uh [Music] uh sometimes [Music] of the disease and let me tell you by the way no doctor okay Doctor take to sick people he give the same treatment why one died another one survives Hallelujah [Music] nothing can do and can harm he's also Jehovah Shalom that's the fourth one is our peace very often people come to church they come with their problems they are sitting on the pills holding their problems my sickness my problem my problem my my my more more appropriate yourself those demons amen amen if once they ever played for you just hold on to it and believe and work amen symptom no symptoms you said you believe continue to believe continue this is how it works as long as you believe foreign if it's you Lord let me work also get up the get off the boat and walk okay as long as he has his eye towards Jesus [Music] you can work on your problems as long as you keep your eyes focused but keep in mind the devil also know the strategies as soon as Peter take his eyes off Jesus to look at the water or she took appearance he lost his face [Music] sometimes before we don't need to preaching you about to Faith anymore it has been beautifully preached excited and it's up to you to hold and to what was already preached and hold it day by day amen amen remember [Music] the Lord is the president of the Lord s h a m m a h s s I'm the one I'm going to speak from Psalm 64. oh 46. Jehovah so in those seven names the first one the premiere is Jehovah and the last one is Jehovah now maintenance [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] later strong every present help in the time of need to representative person amen and if you have a need this morning regardless whether your faith can produce it think about let me go to Abraham Abraham Abraham God started walking with Abraham since Genesis 12 and if God has done all these things and the Genesis 18 19. God is human flesh Abraham saw all these things and the Bible says in Genesis 22. that was the final test of everything you may think foreign [Music] [Music] and [Music] and it came to pass after the things objectives [Music] was for God to reveal to Abraham Abraham because in Genesis 17 he said he came to Abraham in many ways human flesh and God even reveal himself [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you still don't see that [Music] a single life Samuel gospel sicknesses disease that the doctor said they cannot tell them just to show that there is a Jehovah who can handle all kind of disease amen amen even people memories God can handle that and guiding his way of doing things it's so complicated what scripture came in my mind John I believe John chapter 9 question there was a boy yeah and the people start questioning why he is and as Jesus passed by they call me the passage he saw a man which was blind from his birthday is and his disciples asked him saying master who did this thing this man or his parents that he was born blind [Music] Jesus answered neither as this man sinned no he is the parent but that the words of God should be made manifest in him yes [Music] very often when we see a case calling the Jehovah name of redemptions we started looking for the victims we start looking for the one to blame if you take that road you are on the wrong path yes the disciples the discipline they ask Jesus is this man [Music] is for the works of God God manifests [Music] for the attributes attribute of the seven Redemptive names because if he was not born blind they will not know that there is somebody who can open eyes yeah their condition that condition is to show us somebody who can solve it you can have kids because he wants glory and honor be given to him you did the
