bless you all this morning [Music] it's certainly a privilege to be in the house of the lord and i want to welcome you for those who just arrived this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ and uh there will be more special song to come we have a different program this morning so i want first of all to thank you all for attending these special guardians [Applause] we have given our little effort to know therefore and uh when things did not work out the way we intended [Music] and objective of these meetings it was uh around the family planning and leadership the planning familial account especially with meetings for the singles and the married couple especially [Music] because we believe this is the two major group that this uh the devil is targeting especially in these last days amen and i want also to thank all the ministers that did bring the word to us [Music] [Applause] the schedule went the way god wanted initially i have a different kind of schedule uh [Music] but i think god's schedule works always the best so i thank pastor matthew matamba from north [Applause] he spoke to the married couple and last night he was one of also the person who gave input to the married couple [Music] [Applause] and also brother david silo [Music] and also to thank the local congregation [Music] every commission that was uh led by uh brother richard lubaki i think you have done an outstanding job [Applause] i could not do this you see i had much more on my plate that uh coordinating all of these it was impossible you shall [Music] [Music] technology to have all the streamings going on at the same time with two different services at the same time [Applause] [Music] and the food delicious [Applause] after the service you are going to taste the last menu transportation lodging to offer places for those who did not have a place also was excellent [Applause] musicians i think the songs was well done [Applause] [Music] [Applause] interpreters from english to find french to english was wonderful [Music] and above everything special thank you for those who have taken those meetings in the heart for prayer [Music] [Applause] and i believe each one of you have received something special that will guide you for the future and when i saw some of the work the way it was done because people cleaning sometimes at midnight i have to tell them whether it's enough go home you need already the little effort i can do is to pray for you the focus you preach first the prayer proves but your reward must come from the one who called me whatever and this is an opportunity for all of us to keep serving the lord as best as much as we can opportunity amen amen due to all the sacrifices to the sacrifice i'm gonna ask you to rest this coming wednesday there will be no service but for some reason he could not come here to have the appointment for interview at u.s embassy they just send people to 2023 now even in the very last minute we were still hoping that he will have interview on the 27th so we are looking for the future god willing to maybe god has him on the storage for another opportunity let's talk about opportunity as soon as you can have the visa god willing he will be here so that was the reason why i have to change the schedule and try to fill up myself with even though i did not want to do it because i have about six meetings in uh probably three or four days uh starting this uh wednesday or thursday in france for myself they are also organizing uh young people meeting over there so i will have our morning evening morning evening morning evening services but we want to do the best we can do to serve the lord amen so i think another point here tomorrow god willing damage uh for those who will be visiting uh the places brother burnham was in the mountain here of colorado colorado we have a programme program and i will ask brother dale who know the path if you can please talk to the people about the program for tomorrow on okay sorry um some of the places will be uh going um [Music] if you could let brother emanuel know if if you're for sure going and and so what we're planning on doing is there's there's a nice little restaurant that brother brandon used to go to so we like to meet there and have breakfast yes and so that um it's very small so it can't accommodate a huge amount of people so it's helpful if we if we know how many people want to make it up in time for breakfast and so what we like to do to allow for congo time [Music] is let us know which ones are on american time will show up [Music] in other words we'll we'll start meeting for breakfast around with some uh groups around 8 30. and some around nine uh and then at the the latest 9 30 if you would like to come for breakfast and then we're going to go um after breakfast so if you're if you're not there by 10 you're going to miss the departure and it's it's roughly i think two and a half hour drive from here in in the metro area up there so that gives you an idea um so corral peaks um it was uh burned last year in the in the trail on the back side so the trail on the back side is not very accessible anymore but but god has blessed us with a a brother who's a message believer that's a good friend of ours and they own a property on on the other side of the mountain where we can get access so we'll have we'll drive up to that area and they have a little camp spot for those of you that don't want to take the hike maybe you bring a lawn chair or something and you can just hang out there it'll be very beautiful and then for the rest of us we'll take a hike that's about one mile [Music] and we'll take you into what we call the herford gate you remember the story where brother branham talks about the blood tag and he would sit on his horse there at the gate and watch the cattle come from the private land to the public land [Music] and we can take you to that spot and and you'll have a nice view of the the corral peaks in the valley and we'll take you to another place where you can get photos of the cabin that brother branham stayed in when he was there [Music] but most importantly we'll have a wonderful time of fellowship and uh i think you'll see the um the beauty of what attracted brother branham to this area and we enjoy seeing the wilderness where god's prophet went to receive from god to bring back to us so just a couple of um warnings it'll probably be very warm um almost it'll probably be have a matte hot but should we get a rainstorm it can get very cold quickly so make sure you bring a light jacket something with long sleeves so if you were to get a little bit of rain on you it you can be warm perfect and it's at very high altitude well you know what altitude so the the hike is not very strenuous but because of the altitude you will we'll go slow and take our time it's not bad at all we've had uh elderly people make the the hike with no problem [Music] but you will i recommend at least two bottles of water per person so bring your young men with their backpacks in all the waters and that's it anything any questions any questions okay god bless you we'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow [Applause] [Music] so this morning we are going to have two [Music] sermons [Music] can you say amen [Applause] so we are going to start with uh brother david cylo uh he has spoken to the married couple i think it was yesterday and the day before he spoke to the young people and he has done all the banquets with the young people and the couple and uh he finished the banquet last night with the couple and i believe this morning uh you are gonna enjoy the service so after this first sermon after the premier sermon then we will have some more special songs and then we will bring the second speaker in the afternoon i spoke to the young couple young to the young people and then we add the banquet so let us stand as we welcome brother david silo to the platform he is from tennessee and um grace i said or not um [Music] [Music] is [Music] was [Music] oh [Music] my face [Music] is [Music] oh praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god breathe praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] [Music] the thing that changed our lives it's your amazing grace and lord i remember the day that grace became amazing to me lord and how that you so moved you've given us we would be languishing for food and we believe that we are living in the closing moments of this gentile dispensation the lord living in this day we are truly going to need your grace of the resurrection and the rapture and we believe lord that is imminent lord that it could be in any day for every scriptural promise that you've given us we've seen that become manifested reading of the word in the name of jesus christ and let all the church say amen god bless you this morning amen amen so good to be in the house of god with you today it has truly been a great honor for us to be here to be a part of these meetings trust that you've received something from the lord i thank our pastor our precious brother falston for the invitation i want to say thank you to our interpreters if you would be so kind to turn with us to the book of john chapter 11 today i want to start with verse 17. and i want to read this portion of scripture he found that he had lane in the grave four days already and many of the jews came to martha and mary as soon as she had heard that jesus was coming oh martha i hope you can do the same just as soon as you heard jesus was coming she went out and met him but mary sat still in the house isn't those [Music] spoke so many years ago [Applause] now what she's going to get spiritual now and think that she knows one day soon i know there's going to come a resurrection jesus [Applause] whosoever live it and believe in the nation never die and he asks martha this question is the question that brother and preached believe us now this is without this she went her way and called mary her sister secretly oh hallelujah i'm going to you may be seated this morning god bless you thank you brother foster we'll just get rid of that code if that's okay we read from the book of john today the book of john is a special book because we know that it's brought by four gospels and every one of the writers of the gospels they could only write about the anointing that they was given [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] the four is represented he did not look back into the genealogy of jesus in the beginning [Applause] and you realize when it comes to saint john chapter 11 and john is the one who writes about the resurrection and just let me say this john is the only writer that wrote about the resurrection of lazarus wrote about it mark never wrote about it we've never wrote about it but it took an eagle messiah [Applause] and it would have such a great amount of significance in according to junctions in time god was going to reveal himself and make himself known under a certain son's name god loved to reveal himself under the name of son of man so much when it comes to the gentiles god will reveal himself to the gentile church is the name of son of god at the end of the millennium he's going to reveal himself that's the son of david but between the revealing of the son of god [Applause] jesus tells us in the scriptures as it was in the days of the world so shall it be in the days of the son of man timing of the son of man is [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] so it was you know that the first time the son of man ministry showed up changing messages to the bodies of abraham and sarah the second time melchizedek showed them for commissions the perfection of the melchizedek perfection [Applause] [Applause] himself in the flesh that's condescended in this hour in the form of a mighty angel that is revealed to the bride of christ and we believe that almighty god is the ministry of the son of man so let me study physically among the same signs and wonders that was revealed to abraham when did he do it just before the destruction of saudi arabia he's going to destroy this life [Applause] [Applause] what was the last thing that melchizedek did with abraham he took communion [Applause] was the last thing that jesus did with his disciples [Applause] he took communion what was the last sermon that william branham it was [Applause] stimulation [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the love [Applause] [Music] you're a wonderful group to minister to john chapter 11 lazarus is dead and the scripture tells us that jesus loved lazarus and it also says he loved mary and martha as well and he said jesus love martha and her sister so martha and mary and lazarus [Applause] [Applause] and sometimes we think pastors are superhuman people oh and many of the jews martha and mary had left their old dead toad churches they left their synagogues i left their temples let me say like this is and when jesus doesn't come immediately [Applause] [Applause] oh that's all you're saying oh is [Applause] jesus [Applause] is because the lord is sickness [Applause] jesus ain't [Applause] then because [Applause] brother you talking about faith in the word you know what she's telling him questions he's been here today [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah had you been here is it your day's death [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] spoken word of god [Applause] [Applause] i have cancer [Applause] whatever you asked [Applause] [Applause] i'd be late fighting in the heart of america [Applause] nothing can happen now [Applause] i've heard these things oh if only my favorite preacher was here if only my pastor was here [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah i'm talking about the son of man the lord himself with an open book in his hand to reveal the promises under the seals [Applause] face [Applause] now he said listen to this idiot pour the cogs they begin to come together begin to meet god [Applause] [Applause] and the positive together in the positive ensemble you're going to get lot pretty soon you ever had your car battery go dead you [Applause] [Applause] all you need is a living battery [Applause] that battery could be dead but you get another car that's running right [Applause] and you take those jumper cables of faith [Applause] what [Applause] don't let your daddy see you do that he'll get mad oh [Applause] let it start flowing [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] jesus christ is the same today [Applause] he said you're going to get light pretty soon and that's the way faith works you gotta allow your faith to connect with the world in order to bring full restoration [Music] she [Applause] [Applause] it's not [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] who should come he spoke the word to her do you know the importance of your response to the [Applause] amen [Applause] are you saying it or not [Applause] amen [Applause] are you with me now lazarus is dead he's dead but martha and mary marie was still alive and remaining [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] we got the rapture [Applause] [Music] she's i've had this on my heart for about two years and i want you to notice in verse 28 and when she had so said she went [Applause] did is hallelujah [Applause] whosoever it than men [Applause] [Applause] it was his way [Applause] this woman said femme and a woman in the scripture is a good present to church [Applause] so she finds her in the bible says she called mary ella secretly oh hallelujah oh hallelujah can i say this she don't meet her in the outer courts don't meet her in the intercourse she's in the little room i said she's in the house you believe this she called mary ella marie i want you to hear that again her voice he's speaking she's not silent [Applause] there's been churches churches yeah there's [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] is is is the second is the voice of the resurrection [Music] [Applause] that [Applause] he said he's getting the bride together i want you to notice this name he's getting the bride together jesus had called jesus he's being pulled back to the world the same voice that martha recognizes the resurrection is the mystery of the end times [Applause] voice of the resurrection [Applause] we got the sleeping saints and the graves thank you so much lazarus and here is the ministry of the son of man it was the lamb then we got martha and mary which had come out of the denominations of the synagogues they had already left their churches following the message of the son of man and now here comes the hour amen of what's evil the living [Applause] [Applause] [Music] the living [Applause] he interrupts [Music] [Applause] yes [Applause] [Music] but the resurrection cannot come to every name that is on that book beneath that clorox of blood i said mary's got to meet jesus look how connected you are you're not with him [Applause] [Applause] but when that word moves over yourself [Applause] [Music] and she looks at mary ellen [Applause] i'm preaching uh [Applause] that colorado until mary has the same revelation [Applause] [Applause] what do you want me to [Applause] fellowship i know exactly where she is she's going to the grave to weep their understanding is wrong she's not going to the graveyard she wasn't going to a funeral [Applause] as a substitute versus you got no grandchildren they're all first born resurrection [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] jesus christ [Music] how they went down [Applause] [Applause] is you believe [Applause] [Applause] uh [Applause] [Music] and when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews were weeping in the spirit is that not incredible right there that the bible would say that jesus groaned jesus but my question is [Applause] is [Applause] and it speaks [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] and lazarus in that other dimension did you hear something you get those shows no did you hear something did your belly growl and an echoes within him [Applause] [Applause] just [Applause] [Music] boom [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] jesus didn't have to fight [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that heart well if you go over to saint john chapter 12 verse 1. the bible says then jesus six days before the passover is jesus where lazarus was lazarus there they made him only see duncan praise god martha served i don't know think about it right here in the scripture mystery of the resurrection all lane in saint john chapter 11. the power of the resurrection when you pray it's not just

want to do those things you can go outside a little bit [Music] we are going to stand up uh ever one song together as uh we welcome brother ben sharma to the platform yeah and they try also to stay to listen to the word and avoid in and out i mean we can resist you can see the same person three four times i don't know what they are looking for let us worship and uh brother you can get a brother ben amen we're gonna sing a song that brother ben likes i guess uh today if we don't like worship around here amen as is coming [Music] hmm kfg devil don't like no praising god around here the day we don't like us praising god around here well i don't care why [Music] around here [Music] around here around here that's one of my favorite songs can we go one more round on that song where the devil does god around around here [Applause] [Music] praise the lord for the word that's already come forth this morning i don't know what i'm doing up here it's hard to follow preaching like that yeah but you know what i just feel like uh my son comes here when the the fighters are boxing i believe that uh god and satan were in a boxing ring this morning hey man we believe that [Applause] [Music] says so we'll give the the devil a black eye with a bulldozer he may be expecting some little thing but we're going to give him a black eye with the word of god and on the way to church the lord was dealing with me on some different things and so i really don't know which direction to go direction but it's not him that willeth or him that run it because we realize that we're coming together as family planning and leadership and there's no greater leadership than the holy spirit is free amen if you would turn in your bibles to proverbs chapter 29 and 18. yes read this yesterday afternoon to the young people uh and the scriptures read where there is no vision the people perish let's bow our heads dear gracious heavenly father lord we're just coming before you again lord we're just so thankful for your words lord we're just so thankful that that we can rely on your words lord we're coming before you this afternoon lord we're just asking that we wouldn't be a blind people lord that we might be a people with vision lord we know that the the blind that follows the blind they fall into the ditch but we've had an eagle anointing in our age we just ask that you would lead and guide us this week help us to be subject to the holy spirit we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated in luke chapter 6 and verse 39 with jesus speaking the scripture reads like this and you speak a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind [Music] shall they shall they not both fall into the ditch so we realized that it would be something kind of silly if the blind was to lead the blind because neither one of them has vision in their life that we might be able to see where our position really is and he didn't work even though it didn't seem to him that he was maybe the son of the king of this world but our heritage is of a world to come and we're not just children of a king but we are children of the king of kings and we cannot be blind to the things that the devil's doing to us so on thursday night i was able to preach uh to the adults we if you don't have a vision for your if you're just working a job you're just gonna get stuck in the rut of life and you'll start to realize that the joy of the lord starts to depart the joy you used to have is no longer there why because the vision is no longer there so us as young men must create a vision for our life and this starts before we are even married years ago we used to play ice hockey and it was kind of us boys that would do that where we had a family vision [Applause] so if we're ever going to get vision in our lives and we must start this morning even if you are a single man maybe your father doesn't have a vision for your family then you must university or maybe we're working a job no real direction and so when the devil throws things at us we're just going with the uh the things coming out of denominations so we must prepare before fully surrendered to the spirit of of god we must become as young men and young women leaders in our family don't come to genomics in a family the oldest child will have a great effect on the younger children because they have been put in a position of leadership basketball yes and your father has vision and you're a young man like me then your vision should fit with the father's vision the church's vision should never alter god's vision for the church but it should always dovetail it should not be a different vision but so many of us we see this even in the churches there are preachers that don't know how to submit themselves believes he's called to be the pastor and then they can't get along and he breaks off as long as that pastor is under the the leadership of the holy spirit [Music] we have all those five gifts within the church not all of us are pastors so when i am living in my father's house it's not my rules you're with me so far but sometimes we need we we think that we have to be the biggest voice of war sometimes we're trying to get god to always trust us in the big things you're trying to to get your father to trust you with the finances the scriptures say in matthew chapter 25. says his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servants for thou hast been faithful over a few things then he which he had received the one talent is he saw the blessings that this other brother had he loved so he came into the lord i know that i know that thou art a hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou has not uh struggled and i was afraid and went and hid my talent in the earth thou hast that is thine don and pay attention to what the lord's reaction to this once his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and now slothful servant so god has given each and every one of us talents and you will get one of two reactions but you decide what you do with the talents that god gave you god has made each and every one of us different but many times we think maybe because we're athletic maybe because we're better at kicking a round ball than the next guy maybe maybe we're better at soccer oh and because i can pop it over my head then i'm better than the next guy and more attractive to the ladies [Music] but that's not the talent that god gave you to attract them but we must be doing something else with our our talents but maybe you have the the talent to be a servant maybe god has called you to have an office in the church maybe god has called you to be a minister to his people to lend them a helping hand when they need it but we're too busy concentrating on ourselves that we miss why god gave us those talents and we're hiding our talents in the world instead many times we we maybe we have the gifts of singing and instead of having the true heart of worship in our and brother branham said i can't i don't care if you can't sing yourself out of a wet paper bag and that's what brings the holy ghost down there are those of us that have the gift of worship and when we sing the lord comes down this song because the lord loves to hear the praises of his prayers and the first thing god said was let there be light and there was light and god said and there was a god and there was there are power [Music] but yet instead we're we're trying to bury our talents in the world so here we are you know thinking we're just such an eligible bachelor in person do any of you ladies care if a man can dunk or not [Music] do you care if we could kick a soccer ball past another brother into a net escape or market but ladies would you care if your man had vision for your family because a man without vision shall perish and that's why these women think they're the only ones getting ready for marriage so many of the brothers in the church when the playoff game goes into overtime or are you on the edge of your seat saying hey wait there's more oh yeah it's getting more exciting we know the time is getting shorter we've got one last goal [Applause] i know this is elementary school should have received so many times we see where god keeps blessing one brother and we see the blessings just keep pouring out and keep pouring out and keep pouring it it's because he's not gathering up all the talents for himself [Applause] of what christ had just like christ has a vision for history and if you so who wants to point at themselves and say i will perish so we must be faithful to the gifts that god has given us you can't just bury your talents but whatever talents god has given you [Music] uh so many of these christian singers today and i saw one of her music videos once she was preparing videos i can't even listen to the song anymore because it was perverted it was tainted she had [Music] he wants to use you to reach the lost [Applause] there's already been 30 minutes i'll try to wrap it up here shortly and the character in for in a wife is character but we don't have character ourselves and that is what they are looking for because we [Applause] what you find attractive in a woman will show what is in your heart if you are only looking on the outside that is going to be the thing that attracts you [Music] if we're only looking for what's attractive we're looking for something a little more than just good looks now we're about amen but the holy ghost will change our character melissa the holy spirit so you can't just expect to receive the holy spirit today and be a man of perfect character tomorrow but your character is something that you're constantly working on paul said i die daily in politicians but that is why brother branham said read your bible and pray every day brother branham said and hear him we're given and i believe we've had a supernatural weekend and and has done incredible things in our lives he's poured out his holy spirit but when we walk out those doors says in uh god identifying himself and god was in christ reconciling himself the world to himself and his characteristics identified him is a characteristic what he was saying in so much that he said if i do not the works of my father then don't even believe it if i don't have the character of my father character don't believe me don't believe my claims declaration if i haven't got the character my father is me character don't believe it at all so this will be my last point and i'll draw it to an end but i want you to realize that character is not the same as reputation a reputation is something uh by how other people know you reputation but character is something that is behind closed doors we might work [Applause] [Applause] who can raise your hand and say i will manifest [Applause] and that character will match so if you abide in me allah and i abide in you then what hey hello then ask hello put the spoken word into action hello the spoken word can pull out a bribe so let's put the word into action [Applause] so whatever our need is whatever is within your heart if there's a deep calling there must be a deep to response so if your heart is looking for more of god let's see i believe that we can even put it into our daily lives there's a deep in your heart looking for a bride and there must be a deep response [Applause] he's not only limited what i can preach he's not only limited to what brother fosten or our other brothers can preach but he has more revelation that he's willing to pour into it all may the lord [Applause] give us a song to praise the lord a little bit word of god [Music] we of oh [Music] changing your way foreign [Music] [Music] holy world foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Applause]

amen amen [Applause] you may be seated for a minute a minute thank you brother ben for the character i think that's very very important when abraham gave that commission to look for the bride for his uh son isaac he looked for the greatest the oldest servant in his household he was obedience to the messenger they asked her to give water demanded they don't need the law he went extra mile uh you drink water like a camel imagine how many times she has to go back and forth with water in order to quench the thirst of just one camera he's looking for a tough character but rebecca number one she had the love for the message and the messenger she had respect and based on what she was doing reba can never complain never murmur inside of her that's the character if you are looking for somebody ah today i think after service many sisters they will ask you to go get water for the service amen so we are gonna uh have a few specials because it's taking few minutes to get the tent and the food
