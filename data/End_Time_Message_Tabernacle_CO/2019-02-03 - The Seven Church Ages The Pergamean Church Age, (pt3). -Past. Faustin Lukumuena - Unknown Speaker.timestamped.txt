[33:54] in Pergamos right do you think said he
[33:58] which as the sharp sword with two edges

[34:39] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[34:41] reading of the scripture so last
[34:45] Wednesday I started with the age of
[34:47] Pergamos become established the Paragon
[34:52] and I'm gonna continue with it in the
[34:56] same angle just for around just to talk
[35:04] a little bit about Pergamos and his
[35:09] messenger in the message the Pergamum
[35:13] church age the first coat you have
[35:18] brother branham is giving us the
[35:20] background of this church now the
[35:28] background of this church is the third
[35:33] church age Coreper Gama celatum
[35:35] abilities application and a date that
[35:37] this church existed was from 312 ad to
[35:42] 606
[35:49] the edge was as I said last Wednesday
[35:55] Jesus manifested himself in the
[35:58] attribute of a two-edged sword and the
[36:04] two-edged sword is the Word of God and
[36:08] the reason why he appear in that it's
[36:12] because the age of Pergamos is the age
[36:17] where doctrine starts the pinnacle
[36:21] mosaic because even the Nicolaitans
[36:23] which was a did in the very first church
[36:27] age in the Third Age of Pergamus it
[36:32] become a doctrine not only was the
[36:35] doctrine of Nicolette and in the age but
[36:40] it was also the doctrine of balaam so
[36:45] that's why brother bottom said the edge
[36:46] was false doctrine Nicolaitans false
[36:53] doctrine and false doctrine was the
[36:57] center lying in this age it was the
[37:02] foundation of papacy
[37:07] this is where Pope and the Catholic
[37:11] Church was born basically papal existe
[37:13] to nicotine it and in this age it was
[37:16] also the age of marriage between church
[37:19] and state and we will talk about the
[37:24] marriage in this age the reward was
[37:31] hidden manna the man Kashi and a white
[37:34] story Luca you blonde and a star the
[37:39] angel of this church by all that the
[37:42] Holy Spirit would lately do I have a big
[37:47] st. Martin so st. Martin was the angel
[37:54] of the age
[37:57] and brother branham said it was the
[38:00] revelation given me on it because
[38:06] reading of the other Saints during that
[38:09] time I picked up st. Martin because that
[38:15] he was a godly man to my opinion he was
[38:22] ten times more apostle than st. Patrick
[38:26] was Elizabeth will stamp a quickly T I
[38:30] think by the party will not like this
[38:34] talking about a brother Martin trial on
[38:36] the frame after being ten times more
[38:38] than him now no st. Patrick was itself
[38:47] much and and nephew Saint Martin's
[38:50] sister was the mother of st. Patrick so
[38:56] you better just start calling bottom so
[39:01] that was just the summary of the age and
[39:06] I think by God's grace we will get into
[39:08] more detail to talk about those false
[39:11] doctrines the creation of the Catholic
[39:17] Church how they state politic married to
[39:21] the church for Moloch
[39:24] that's why brother Branham is telling us
[39:28] believers should not be involved in
[39:30] politics that was the age of marriage so
[39:36] that's the foundation of the background
[39:39] of the age now Matt know what is the
[39:43] meaning of Pergamos in the message a
[39:47] Pergamum church age bar graph 157 bottom
[39:53] said now the word Pergamos means married
[39:59] the very word Pergamos means married
[40:04] Chris charity that is the Nicolaitans
[40:08] side the formal side 157 conceived
[40:27] married to the state with a peg and
[40:32] ceremonies like the ceremony pagan pagan
[40:35] ceremonies so the age of Gummer's it was
[40:40] the manifestation of the pagan
[40:42] ceremonies where they took all the woman
[40:46] pagan behavior team up on the old man
[40:50] and put it in the church that's the age
[40:56] and it was the birth of the Catholic
[40:59] Church in that day and keep in mind when
[41:05] we talk about Catholics don't you just
[41:08] see the priests live I personally prefer
[41:10] Catholic means a spirit to literally
[41:13] live there is a spirit the Catholics
[41:17] spirit is moving as Branham said people
[41:23] die lisanna by the spirit never dies the
[41:28] spirit that was born in 325 is
[41:33] continuing continue and that's why
[41:36] brother Branham said upon indeed I did
[41:39] not give you that just in the message
[41:43] Exodus when I'm said we are not gonna
[41:48] give our girls to be married by Catholic
[41:52] boys the nymphaeum area when we talk
[41:56] about Catholic boys Catholic
[41:59] it's not those in the choir in the
[42:02] country paragraph 2 15 to 17 Exodus we
[42:08] have to get married only between they
[42:10] belong
[42:11] believers acquire and when we talk about
[42:15] believers
[42:16] it's the believers not the Catholic boys
[42:20] I'd love for Metallica we have Catholic
[42:23] boys in the church Catholic
[42:25] I'll agree we have Catholics sisters in
[42:28] the church tunic are eglise therefore
[42:31] Allah the parent it's your
[42:34] responsibility to know who you are
[42:38] giving your daughter to bikini but
[42:40] receive who your son is gonna marry
[42:43] sometimes it can run into conflict
[42:46] conflict because people get so
[42:49] narrow-minded population on the policy
[42:52] right but you can have somebody you can
[42:54] see this one is a catalyst to leak
[42:59] regardless of the number of years they
[43:01] have done in the church you know Madonna
[43:03] is not fair like this they are still
[43:05] cuddly let me tell you one of the
[43:09] specialty of the catalytically in the
[43:13] Catholic Church and agree that they
[43:14] don't pay tight Peppadew emo a special
[43:18] ability is not true
[43:19] the priest will never talk about tighten
[43:22] apologize I'm a lady
[43:23] he will talk about the mass if a palatal
[43:26] a mess
[43:28] so the Catholic boys don't pay tight
[43:32] just paper with him
[43:34] no they don't pay tight they don't know
[43:37] it so if somebody doesn't pay his tight
[43:42] he's a Catholic boy I think a tunic you
[43:47] see them in the church we are gonna do
[43:51] this we are gonna do this he is a
[43:53] Catholic boy and with that in mind I
[43:56] will not give anybody to a Catholic boy
[43:59] another person and of sohcahtoa League
[44:03] they are Catholic boys Catholic if they
[44:06] don't pay their tightly papilledema
[44:08] because is the same spirit of the saloon
[44:11] ministry because for the catalytically
[44:14] patrolling in 325 when they brought up
[44:18] the spirit portal is free they said if
[44:23] we tell the people to pay die
[44:25] - yonder PLO him they will not pay any
[44:28] pay
[44:30] therefore hello the only way to do a
[44:33] seminar in order for us to become a rich
[44:35] church because if you want to preach the
[44:40] Bible tell the people about Molokai tree
[44:43] to pay type our lives on the manage they
[44:45] will not pay Buster you will pay the
[44:47] bill yourself a relief a to whom em so
[44:52] the best way is to ask them to bring
[44:59] money when somebody died
[45:05] we are gonna say a mass we collect the
[45:10] money don't collect the line that's all
[45:12] and the Catholic they understood
[45:15] silicon-silicon if you ask them to pay
[45:17] tithe he will of the Monday defeated him
[45:19] you will not collect any money in a
[45:21] pillar so therefore sell hosiery
[45:26] sell these things that's why the
[45:28] Catholic boys do when you ask them money
[45:33] to go by for a retreat they will do when
[45:38] you ask their money for any church
[45:39] basketball activity they will do when
[45:43] you are there money to eat pizza they
[45:46] will do when you ask them tight from
[45:48] there they don't ask about my services
[45:55] and Branum said and today go like to
[46:02] partner 15 you understand in the time of
[46:04] Moses what happened notice they devil in
[46:08] a form of ramesses the first thing he
[46:13] done so Sheila was get rid of the
[46:16] children with natural death and as soon
[46:21] as the Son of God was born he had moved
[46:26] from Egypt cause God destroy Egypt
[46:31] casted it's never never come back since
[46:37] cylinders am/fm you'd appreciate Allah
[46:39] then he was in a war center movies seat
[46:44] up to up and the first thing wrong to
[46:51] destroy it all to get be sure they devil
[46:57] in the Roman system system and try to
[47:01] destroy what the Son of God to begin
[47:06] with the same devil and today he has
[47:10] done the same thing on today sign of
[47:13] spirit now religious professing
[47:18] Christianity and taking our girls and
[47:22] married them to Catholic boys and make
[47:27] them bring their children Catholic to
[47:33] break the power of the other side there
[47:36] is your demon
[47:39] there is your devil seated on seven Hill
[47:42] wearing Triple Crowns Catholicism is a
[47:49] spirit they kill in the day of Moses
[47:53] they kill in the day when Jesus was born
[47:57] and today they are killing the children
[48:00] in which way with marriage we will see
[48:05] in the age of tight area political
[48:10] marriage people setting up marriages for
[48:13] political reasons I'm gonna marry this
[48:17] one because I'm gonna marry the one
[48:20] because I'm gonna marry that one because
[48:22] before you marry somebody checking this
[48:25] instead of checking the personal a
[48:28] person you go check the green card all
[48:32] these things are political reasons
[48:35] that's why you have to know what you are
[48:38] doing
[48:39] not everybody is a politician they are
[48:42] to believers as well but you watch the
[48:45] motive and objective
[48:47] and you better pray about it somebody
[48:50] you never pay tight it's a Catholic boy

[53:43] the message the program is Pergamum
[53:47] Church 8 paragraph 199 now just a little
[53:54] further now the Christian Church married
[53:59] to babylon babylon
[54:01] Pergamos means wedding video male I
[54:05] think it has been a long time I did not
[54:08] get into the step of marriage in the
[54:15] exposition of the seven church age per
[54:19] graph 192 - 3 what a bottom said but the
[54:24] church and state would come together was
[54:27] truly for known of the Lord they're very
[54:34] member gammas means thoroughly married
[54:41] indeed state and church were married
[54:46] politics and religion were united when
[54:52] you see the poor people getting in
[54:54] politics from the church on Strayer
[54:57] politics the number 1 is the Pope
[55:00] asleep up from the stage of Pergamos
[55:05] that's where the pub started to get
[55:09] involved in politics and does this
[55:12] spirit that creation of the Catholic
[55:15] Church
[55:16] that was their spirit and that spirit
[55:18] never dies
[55:19] we see people today not being converted
[55:24] in history t but they change address
[55:28] cataleya to dude a message for massage
[55:31] oh I don't go to send Marie and more
[55:36] anymore which is a Prius Emily I go to
[55:47] you just change the address but to start
[55:50] with you never converted same thing you
[55:53] used to do in the car - that's what you
[55:57] are doing here Catholic no tight no now
[56:07] they're all spring of that the union
[56:12] have been consistently the most horrible
[56:17] hybrids the word as everything nation
[56:23] opinion from the unity unity love church
[56:29] and politics the children coming from
[56:37] the Catholic is the most horrible hybrid
[56:41] the world has ever seen it a big
[56:47] Catholic do nothing to do with cattle
[56:51] only if you don't you are a very strong
[56:56] type of hybrid with I breed faith with
[57:02] ibrid politician manner of the
[57:05] manipulative you appear before the
[57:08] believers like a very good Christian
[57:11] people pay your respects but under there
[57:14] you are not even converted you are
[57:20] nowhere in the world you are just am a
[57:24] Catholic so that's the
[57:29] being offered the word Pergamos as I
[57:34] said I'm not gonna talk about it longer
[57:38] we will get into in the days to come now
[57:42] in the message a Pergamum church age
[57:46] para 58 I want to talk a little bit for
[57:50] our st. Martin why brother Branham
[57:56] picked brother
[57:57] st. Martin as the messenger para 58 of
[58:03] the Pergamum church age now his life was
[58:08] from 8315 now here's the reason I picked
[58:16] him in preference to add a sense of the
[58:19] day because the way that he under the
[58:28] inspiration of God I do believe that now
[58:33] the Catholic Church did not come on I
[58:37] see him in means in the Catholic Church
[58:42] you live the way you want if you die
[58:46] they will ever meeting to declare you
[58:50] st. the canonization one of the reason
[58:56] he picked up much and as the messenger
[59:00] commitment because even the Catholic
[59:03] Church did not recognize the Martin
[59:05] Seligman March and fill with the spirit
[59:09] walk with God with a powerful testimony
[59:14] could not even notice him even after his
[59:19] death a map regardless of his many
[59:22] miracles they did not they did not
[59:28] recognize him that's another reason I
[59:32] picked him that's what I'm saying and
[59:38] one next Sunday when I ask you one why
[59:40] they choose brother but I'm picked by
[59:42] the margin
[59:43] I'm a thief Emma I will ask you before
[59:47] they shoot him candle yes and all this
[59:59] that we are seeing that's God the
[1:00:04] spiritual ministry that the early church
[1:00:07] turned down the Nicolette and charge
[1:00:13] turned it down because of the things
[1:00:17] they were spiritual and as I've drawn
[1:00:21] here the church was being squeezed out a
[1:00:24] lot come on Tracey negative amok when
[1:00:26] say I'm gonna skip this going to
[1:00:31] paragraph 61 now the life of st. Martin
[1:00:36] is one of the greatest miracle filled
[1:00:39] life of anybody in the church from all
[1:00:48] the way from simple out he was one of
[1:00:53] the most spiritual men one of his first
[1:00:59] miracle brother friends he was a soldier
[1:01:03] to begin with I believe so as a soldier
[1:01:07] he was always working with the sword and
[1:01:12] one day during wintertime very cold
[1:01:16] environment he found a beggar asking for
[1:01:21] something brother that's why we need to
[1:01:24] take this when we study the life of some
[1:01:30] saints we have to compare our testimony
[1:01:34] with how many people we pass by in the
[1:01:40] wintertime even somebody in the church
[1:01:44] we were certain needs you don't even
[1:01:47] talk to that person just to know how you
[1:01:50] are doing how things are going for you I
[1:01:53] just lost my job but how are you paying
[1:01:56] the bills
[1:01:58] but listen what they do somebody's going
[1:02:05] to ask him
[1:02:07] have you seen the past I'm gonna go to
[1:02:12] the motor vehicle to try to change my
[1:02:16] last name I will be Church first time
[1:02:22] Church everything because when there is
[1:02:26] a need go to the church we have not to
[1:02:30] think what we have to receive a from the
[1:02:32] church Navin Papa the second democracy
[1:02:34] will agree by letter saying what we can
[1:02:36] do for brother Martin as a soldier
[1:02:43] passing by he saw somebody needs he did
[1:02:48] not say I'm gonna go check my closet
[1:02:51] Valley Road amo in my closet if I have
[1:02:55] extra je vais vous complainingly son
[1:03:00] spiritual not to go in my closet Valley
[1:03:05] number what I got I know it's very cold
[1:03:11] that's what God called giving the second
[1:03:14] you happened to me you don't give the
[1:03:17] excess we need an apology but if you get
[1:03:20] the best you got
[1:03:23] that's where the blessing reside that's
[1:03:27] why we don't see people post very much
[1:03:31] always from one picture to one page know
[1:03:34] the Bible said you will be the head not
[1:03:39] the tail that's the truth but today we
[1:03:45] cling to their leader we can move on to
[1:03:49] invite somebody to give something to
[1:03:50] somebody you God never dealt with you I
[1:03:55] make return but I believe a Christian
[1:03:57] God always deal with his own he will
[1:04:01] give you special attention
[1:04:03] with the spiritual eyes
[1:04:07] perceive that this brother may have a
[1:04:10] need to set our armies this sister has a
[1:04:13] need and sometimes you don't need to be
[1:04:15] identical apart we don't even I know he
[1:04:21] sits here that's why I see I just put
[1:04:25] brother Andrew Matthew you put in
[1:04:31] offering basket brothers gonna see I
[1:04:36] just find that can be the result of a
[1:04:40] deep night of this is how the early
[1:04:45] Christian not just criticism but
[1:04:51] compassion for one brother Martin did
[1:04:55] not go to the closet he said just what I
[1:04:58] got just beggar was there come on
[1:05:07] oh my life has to change just cover a
[1:05:11] little bit and brother Martin white when
[1:05:16] he was home wearing the angel of the
[1:05:22] Lord came cover with the same piece of
[1:05:26] code I want to read it
[1:05:43] park of 61 going to highlight but when
[1:05:51] San Martin come by Mako realizing his
[1:05:55] duty as a Christian believed he had one
[1:06:01] coat a clot over his shoulders he cut it
[1:06:06] in two with his sword and gave half of
[1:06:10] it to the beggar he took the other and
[1:06:15] then that night began his career for
[1:06:22] Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision
[1:06:26] wrapped in that same hope that he cut
[1:06:30] off into which fulfill the scripture in
[1:06:38] so much as you have you have did it this
[1:06:47] scripture is still in the Bible
[1:06:51] try to do some I'm telling you now each
[1:06:55] one of you second try to do some works
[1:06:58] like this in secret and see what God is
[1:07:03] gonna bless you boy come on you have a
[1:07:05] believe and part of 63 Granum from there
[1:07:09] he said so take that for a lesson what
[1:07:18] ever you do to somebody you are doing it
[1:07:23] unto Christ

[1:07:40] you do to address you have done to
[1:07:43] Christ no he did not hear you let us say
[1:07:48] together
[1:07:53] so no matter what he thinks about you
[1:07:58] it's what you think about him see that
[1:08:04] brings their blessings allah kiya
[1:08:05] couplet living that was the first
[1:08:07] miracle and beginning of his ministry
[1:08:11] minister amen amen
[1:08:17] second miracle miracle miracle 67 there
[1:08:28] was one time they have to destroy the
[1:08:37] there was a tree and Saint Martin came
[1:08:41] and he told them if I am a servant of
[1:08:45] God I'm going to stand in the direction
[1:08:48] where the trees if it fall on me and I
[1:08:54] died then I'm not a man of God but if
[1:08:58] I'm a man of God somehow God is going to
[1:09:01] twist the direction of the tree to fall
[1:09:05] on somebody what I did they agreed and
[1:09:12] they chopped down the tree and the tree
[1:09:15] started falling toward God mighty hand
[1:09:21] came and change the direction and it
[1:09:25] will fall on a bunch of people a lot of
[1:09:28] people what a ministry but he was
[1:09:34] destroying a pagan Gulf one day I'm
[1:09:39] tearing down a pagan altar and there was
[1:09:43] a sacred tree standing by the pagan
[1:09:46] altar and he was cutting he was cutting
[1:09:51] the tree down and many standing by was
[1:09:56] inserting it he said if I be a man of
[1:10:01] God
[1:10:02] tell me the way back to the tree living
[1:10:05] and let the tree fall on me on Sunday to
[1:10:10] me a cola bottoms you tied me up this
[1:10:13] way
[1:10:14] if we got closer support I cannot run I
[1:10:18] will except to die if I kept it moving
[1:10:23] if I'm not a man of God they tree will
[1:10:27] kill me if I'm a man of God my God
[1:10:31] cannot twist that tree somewhere quietly
[1:10:37] challenge so they started chopping on
[1:10:41] the trees and when the tree started to
[1:10:44] fall it is switched around and kill a
[1:10:49] bunch of the spectre-2 on the Instagram
[1:10:53] oh no got a twisted it back all the time
[1:11:02] there was miracles in his meetings amen
[1:11:08] Parker 68 like it was with me Liza
[1:11:13] there was a daddy baby they want to it
[1:11:16] marching enough Martin just lay down and
[1:11:20] the baby came to life the brother
[1:11:22] branham say that happened three times I
[1:11:29] start to speak off was a dead baby but
[1:11:34] he lay his body across and it raised
[1:11:38] back to life again
[1:11:40] after you had played for some time for
[1:11:44] this baby
[1:11:47] another outstanding to me was the
[1:11:51] Emperor I think this one I said it on
[1:11:54] Wednesday and he was going to keep that
[1:12:06] umbrella was going to kill some God
[1:12:09] field only ghost people
[1:12:13] and of course he was the right hand of
[1:12:18] the Bishop of the First Church of Hope
[1:12:21] time and he actually was the Pope before
[1:12:24] he was called a pop his name was from da
[1:12:30] ma as you are when I will ask you one
[1:12:36] day he is a martyr Canadian mafia you
[1:12:40] will forget that he was and he was
[1:12:46] putting all the Christian to death that
[1:12:48] he could get a hold off to put to death
[1:12:54] and this Emperor wife a pagan and when
[1:13:01] this sent centered Martin came to
[1:13:04] intercede his wife put him next to it
[1:13:08] that he would try to intercede for this
[1:13:11] creature not a Christian not to be
[1:13:13] killed
[1:13:17] let me go to paragraph 71 so anyway the
[1:13:25] Emperor went and killed a Christian so
[1:13:30] therefore Martin look for interview to
[1:13:35] go see the Emperor they block access
[1:13:41] Ilana blue keeps on taxi they stop a big
[1:13:46] gate so but Saint Martin wanted the
[1:13:52] interview with him and the God stopped
[1:13:55] him educate well sir Martin fell on his
[1:13:59] face later and pay until God show him to
[1:14:04] go in when he raised up of there he
[1:14:12] walked to them locked doors and they
[1:14:15] opened themselves
[1:14:19] today gate loved me soon mountain and a
[1:14:25] desire to go talk to dick who as
[1:14:29] persecutor Christian God say pray do
[1:14:33] deep our prayer is the powerful keep a
[1:14:38] guard say go in 3d on he started walking
[1:14:41] la cama sama and they gate opened by the
[1:14:44] emperor sitting in the chair Pinocchio
[1:14:47] so Martin coming a demon Avenue and as
[1:14:52] so as soon as so Martin she just turned
[1:14:56] his head and now this man woke up right
[1:15:01] bottom our Martin send button and right
[1:15:14] up every guard and everything else right

[1:26:47] choice no your choice but to God the
[1:26:50] choice their Holy Ghost has made him

[1:26:56] him in that manner and no matter what
[1:27:00] the pastor's done if you respect him in
[1:27:04] your heart as God's servant God will
[1:27:09] respect you for doing but I rather you
[1:27:14] see people some up a stage
[1:27:16] does not mean anything but the real
[1:27:20] respect is when you are upset
[1:27:23] the past has done something African the
[1:27:26] way you act
