heart amen amen uh I got a cold I was attacked by the devil this week since Sunday when we finished I went to see uh our mother Charlotte who lost her mother just and then after that coming back home I took that other Road pointing to this direction I was going back home R I took that road to go back home you know there was only one road one way coming uh the opposite way [Music] I was driving all of a sudden I saw somebody coming to my direction from far I could see from far I saw his car coming to my direction a new call big truck SUV from far there was only one way I was wondering from far is he understanding that he's only taking the wrong way from far could tell I said it might happen so let me just continue because I know I'm in the right way but as long as I was getting closer and I could notice the guy was just coming directly to my direction his way was empty Lane was empty I said wow what's going on okay I kept on going and then he was still coming in and we got so closed and then I was like would I do I try let him know that you're taking the wrong way take another Lane no but when we got so close I try I I said to myself if I stop there will be a problem then I I took another Lane when I took his Lane I tried to escape him and then he followed me as well and I was like what is he a drunk man but by the grace of God we were lucky that we there was no car coming in the other direction I try my best I know it was God because I know for sure he was God I just kept him so closed when I went I kept on looking at the car I looked at the guy was well dressed with a good glass pair of glass and I was like what's going on with this car and I went I got home safe I thank God because he protected me I was saying maybe I'm right if I continue but what will happen if he comes and hit me every time we have to be uh grateful to God even the breath of life that we have it's a miracle I really suffered from cold you know I work with Brother Richard I was uh forced to go to work because if I don't go to work that's where the scripture where Paul says whosoever doesn't work shouldn't hit I saw the way brother Richard was looking at me he was suffering in his heart because I was suffer yeah it continued like that all the week Along on Friday I was close to tell to the pastor I don't know how I'm going to preach with a running nose my my eye was just like a drunk man I'm not going to tell him that one day I was sick and God healed me here when I remember and I didn't tell him anything yesterday called me texted me was asking if I was doing well is like I was wondering why is he asking me as if I told him I was sick may God bless you Pastor where you are it's very good by the grace of God yesterday I felt good thank you for your prayers because I know you pray for me amen amen I know many of you were also attacked seeing as brother Manuel with his family the others and many of you brother Matthew may God be blessed for the healing and I pray that no matter how the devil can do with sickness may God heal you and give you Victory amen amen uh don't as I have a little cold just bear with me a little bit I'll see how the Lord will lead me I just finish my thought about letting off the pressure letting off the pressure as we said last time the pressure it's something really really bad and the pressure gets everyone chisan or not everybody gets the pressure it gets to everybody now see people that are not Christian the way they do to uh relax themselves to to let off the pressure there's some that will go and take alcohol they will get drunk I I'll let off the pressure like that but after the the effect of the alcohol is gone the problem is still there some will go find pleasure in games and all kinds of things but that's not the solution but for the Christians the Christian has a solution and we we know that that solution amen and that's new birth that will take you to the City of Refuge but when I'm was speaking here in this message I believe in the same message letting off the pressure he preached in that context You Preach five times the same title [Music] he was talking about a weapon that was bought a brother bought a a weapon to brother Billy Paul and the weapon brother Billy Paul was left-handed and that uh weapon that was purchased to for Billy Paul I'm in the message letting off the pressure preached in 1962 at Los Angeles June uh 6 June I mean June 22 in Los Angeles you said the paragraph 41 I believe for our sister Carol everything is everything's good right okay uh it he said this my mother who know he just slipped to Heaven a few weeks ago was a half Indian and I just I just love the outdoors that's where I gave my shootings I never could I've got friends that would have bought me with buy a gun yeah don't say and that's right I have it but I couldn't think of letting my friend buy me a with buy gun that uh that brand would buy because it's a good quality that brand is a good quality and it cost a lot of money to some but bham says how a friend can buy me weapon like this that lot of money because while I have friends in Africa they are missionaries they preach the gospel without shoes I couldn't do it no I couldn't do that and so a brother said I have that gun bought out for you Billy and to be all right the brother said I'll take that gun that they bought for Billy Paul that was not the brand that wanted the buy gun brother say he will take that the brother said he will take that gun and take it to the company so it can be done again so that it can make it so it looks like it's a weby gun are you with me are you all right now and the brother [Music] brother said the brother who had an idea was a Baptist filled with the Holy Ghost and he took it there and when I took it back now when Venom went to the shooting field to try to try it then what happened and I I introduced a bullet [Music] there I tried to shoot to test it out and when he shoot to test it he found out it blow it up almost lost his life follow me that way brother bam got inspiration to preach about the pressure exploded of bullet just almost hit him could not understand why was going on he was thinking that he was dead while he was still alive and the the the the blood was coming out and spreading everywhere and I stood up easily and then I thought I was dead and it was uh just it's a tremendous thing I I got a little a message out of that that rle wasn't started started a if it would have been started at the beginning whereby it would have been all right because the still would have held the pressure of it because the that gun was another brand the brother said I'll take that [Music] weapon and we can remodel it and by the the company called W say another message the way they did it again it's as if put a lot of holes in the the beginning of the the beginning of the the gun while the brand of that gun whereby it's done in such a way that it can hold after the the weapon was well done he was thinking everything would go well when he tried with the the gun with the bullets exploded and injured brother bham he said the reason why the the the the gun exploded because he wasn't the original of w Mr W was so nice he searched the he couldn't tell tell what happened but I thought it was head space that did it if that ra would have started at the beginning and come it will never blow up now listen friends let me say this when you go out professing Christianity just don't just take a Rec conversion idea of it are you follow what is coming out of that experience of the raffle that raffle was as a perfect one they just wanted to polish so that it can look like but it wasn't the original one that is why it exploded are you with me when a Christian claim to be a Christian while is not inside of him by what will happen it will blow up because the original is not original Christian don't try to impersonate someone else now listen don't just make out and join the church or sing the songs you got to be born again and start from the beginning amen amen amen amen amen beloved to be a member of the church that will not save you amen that wouldn't save you the fact that you sing to be in a group we going to church that's good but if they inside of you there never been personal experience something changed you have been changed I have been changed if that's not the case you end up blowing because the pressure will come in various ways you see says he [Music] said I I repeat this don't just make out and join church or sing the songs you got to be born again and start from the beginning then if you start from the beginning then it all the pressure as long as you got it so you won't blow up amen amen it means that that it couldn't hold the pressure of a bullet as a Christian when we come to Jesus when we believe the word we have to believe the word with all our hearts something has called us that thing convinced us that this message is the truth and once we have been convinced that has to take us to the new ver because Jesus said in John chapter 3 John John chapter [Music] 3 okay these are the thing that we already know we can take verse five Jesus answered this is the interview of Jesus with Nicodemus I [Music] said except a man be born of spirit of water he cannot enter in the kingdom of God he said that which is born of flesh is flesh that which is born of spirit is Spirit Marvel not I said unto thee he must be born again amen amen that which is flesh is flesh but if someone is born again he will not work according to the law of [Music] [Applause] Flesh he's a change man he works according to the even though the pressure comes that thing inside of him will be like to cool down his life amen amen if there's not that thing in him [Music] that's why I love my my young brothers and sisters the fact that you agreed to come to church that means there's something inside of you but that doesn't stop there that did something to bring us here maybe mom mama was pushing you go to church oh after if Daddy brings you to church Mama brings you to church maybe because they have new birth good they love to see the children happy I don't see a father that will go to heaven and I enjoy seeing his son in house I don't I don't think so everything they could do it's to pray for you and try to push you let's go to church do this now listen The Experience that's for their own themselves you and I we have to have our own experience with God Amen I'm not going to heaven because my dad is saved you know even bil bil started smoking you know one day saw that in the vision saw Billy [Music] Paul smoking and saw in a vision how Billy Paul was going somewhere to be lost and when Billy Paul told bil Paul you did that again said what am I going to do and brother bham everything that he did he prayed you know one day it's like as usual a good mother a good parent a good man of God is trying to help you and then you don't want you always PID it one day what happened but a b went somewhere fishing I believe with his friends and he was beaten by the the serpent when that serpent B him he was taken to emergency it was taken to the doctor that was close friends to brother Bim it was a well experienced doctor now listen my when he got there the doctor knows for a person that was beaten by a serpent you can you cannot give him you cannot give him that that pen or the person will die on the spot but that day God allowed even the one that was exp to make that mistake just to correct Billy Paul he gave that he gave that [Music] medication bil Paul was about to die at the hospital where he was something told him go to the hospital you die your son is die the hospital that's way while he was dying beloved if you are if you a daughter of God God will not lose you but if you stubborn to listen to the word God will pressure you cor you to to that will make you you'll be cornered and you will give in and B will say oh if my dad was here he always told me how would that be as was in a and the doctor said I killed this child what am I going to do dad is my friend and coming he said said can I see my son the doctor say no no no you cannot see him like that I'm sorry to tell you I almost killed your son just imagine you a father your son beaten by a serpent and your close friend who a doctor is very sin to you to tell I almost kill your son I gave him the wrong medication that is why the new birth is the only thing that can keep us from pressure Des regardless it was calm was so calm okay he said that's fine I know you're a good doctor I know you didn't mean to kill it I can only see that child brother bam went there so Billy Paul he said Billy Paul you see what I was telling you and he prayed Billy Paul he said Lord if you can help this child to get away from this Lord I know I know he might serve you and by this little prayer the wrong medication that he got you you would have you would have been dead on the SP it was just God keeping his son God wanted to bring Billy to meet God face to face amen are you with me religion of your father and your mother will not save you you have to be sure yourself even now the the atomic bomb I have to be sure that there's something inside that will take me where brother bham is am amen it's not because my my dad was a preacher my mother she's a servant of God it needs I need myself you know if there's one thing that God loves it's to see The Thirst of the child of God SE after when you have that thirst God will manifest always amen is not right I always said I don't want to impersonate I don't want to be actor a pH people know that he's a good brother he always comes to church every time he's there if you ask him to do something he'll do it that's from the eye of people but what we speaking of here what does God say about your life is inside of your life because when the pressure will come that will destroy everything in Matthew chapter 18 Matthew chapter 18 was speaking of on the basis of New Birth uh say he says this Matthew 19 Jesus was saying this verse 18 he says uh uh uh rather ver verse 13 and 14 my thought in verse 14 children was Bor to Jesus now notice what Jesus said 194 but Jesus said suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven amen amen for of such is the kingdom of God of Heaven All The Children notice the children how they behave you can have you can be in trouble with a kid you beat him for example you slap him right now he will weep and shout and after just few minutes ask ask him you told you you call him he will be as happy as nothing happen you won't even know that you bit him and Jesus telling us that the Kingdom of Heaven is as such to be like that it takes the new birth because as human beings especially us adults you do something to me now and after a while you call me to do something for you it takes God in my heart that's the reason why Jesus the king of belongs to them that like these children Beloved the basis of Christianity is the new birth we can do everything we can preach Mysteries and you notice the new birth will balance our church the new birth will give love to a family the man has to know my wife she's born again and my the husband the wife knows also my husband is born again yes we can make but there's evidence that shows there the new birth if there's that new birth we are in the City of Refuge because the new birth will allow me to respect my brother I'll respect my sister even if it's a little I'll respect him amen amen God happen us may God help us told us when there's a lot of shaking or problem it's by the lack of New Birth but if there was a new birth everyone would have understood and simplify things the new birth will lead you to for get that you right to save somebody amen amen amen amen are you tired this is just introduction my thought is more on that City how will you be in that City if you're not born again you know it will be like a song we are in the City of Refuge no wonder that people that in the City of Refuge but they criticize one another they don't trust each other here we in the City of Refuge you ran to seek refe he ran to seek safy that would have brought us closer but instead of that we criticize one another there's something wrong there we have to go back to the beginning or it will be as that gun will explod but just a little pressure that will come they got to help us in that message the pressure the message preach and on the 1862 May 18 parag 43 he says this he says this notice there are you there may 1862 notice there the zone of safety of God the place of Refuge of God when we are there in that place of [Music] Refuge we have right to the power healing power if God will forgive his enemy and take him into the Refuge how much more will he take off take care of him after he has got him there [Music] see there's a healing power so when a Christian gets sick there's no need of being all steam up body just remember by stes we are healed that's the promise he promised it so he can't just take it back it's a place of Refuge for our sickness for our worries cast all your cares cast all your cares upon Him for he cares for you am amen that's a [Music] refuge trust in his word his promises every promise that he had made belongs to you as long as you're you in in his kingdom as long as you come to him for Refuge then you have a right to every promise that he made amen amen amen amen I believe that we understood that City of Refuge as we learned last time it's in the Old Testament with that law of ey for ey and to for to you do something wrong they will hunt you to kill you even if you didn't do it willfully you you forced to die but by the grace of God the god who's rich in Mercy he always found he always finds a way to escape innocent he always made a way always a way so that his own children so that they may not suffer that is why he built that City of Refuge so that when you are being hunted you have to get inside the city you are safe there's nothing that can condemn you that we saw telling us those Cities of Refuge for us represent the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ is our City of Refuge everything that we need amen amen continues present every Christian here present present or anywhere else has a right to anything that Christ died for has a right to anything that Christ died for now listen friends and when you are in Christ you possess the whole thing it's all yours that's exactly right amen amen said just consider look at theam woman that woman she had a pressure buttering one day she didn't have children by his Hospitality she welcome a man of God when she welcome a man of God buil a good place for that man of God she told him every time you come to preach this is your house your place and the man of God got inside the house and then he said what can I do for this woman and the man of God woman didn't have children and the man of God prayed for the woman and the woman had a child and one day the Christian their life it's one day you laugh and another day You Weep in all that the Bible says in all them things all things works together them that love God them that are born not after the flesh after the will of God and the tsunam woman and she was enjoying because she received a child all of a sudden she got a cold fever the child got a fever and all of a sudden the child died well how how this child just died and when the woman noticed that she said wow this child died I know how I got this child sometimes it's very important to know by which channel that blessing came to you and the child took the woman took the child and he took the child to the bed of el he said that can work call me the prophet and she took the camels and she said I'm going and she was going to find El Elijah who was at the mountain and notice elah as a prophet where the mountain where he was he noticed the woman coming he said wow how so the way I'm sewing that woman the pressure coming something's going on says as a prophet he started saying what's going on but God didn't tell him anything and when the woman got to and the prophet ask a question is everything all right with you and the shunamite woman said all is well say I love that kind that the attitude that brings Miracle when you do the very opposite of what the devil is presenting to you God will be obliged to come on the scene with a dead child they asking you is everything all right and and the woman said all is well may God give us people with such F somebody's going through the fire but he could say all is well somebody is shaken by sickness but he can say all is well you will see how God will change the situation and the prophet when he saw something was wrong just go a little faster the prophet got to the house of that woman when he got there the prophet started walking up and down said he wanted the prophet wanted the prophet wanted God to reveal him something but as he was walking around God did not reveal him anything sometime God doesn't reveal everything to his Serv and he did this he was walking and he noticed there was nothing and then and then he said I have nothing to do and he lied over over the child his no his nose on the nose of the Dead the eye on the eye he lied on top of him and you know the story until I believe a prophet I believe even everything that he's wearing is Anointed to the the point you know in the time of Paul the handkerchief that he was using people would just take those handkerchief and they will send to people and they were healed and I believe a man of God that is Anointed that has the anointing of God everything he touches has to be anointed because Elijah was anointed [Applause] when his body was in contact with a dead child the miracle happened the child rose again say see what happened theam woman let off the pressure what happened she knew how to do it she knew if I go to the representative of God God can use the man of God the same God that used the man of God still using men of God today he doesn't change but says when the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother bam says he says it's the same yesterday today and forever except this body except this body Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever not the body amen amen except this physical body what does it mean that God doesn't change he can use any other body he can use you you pray for somebody and the thing happen it's still the same God that is yet the same because the miracle happening today who believes there's still Miracles happening today is the same body doing it Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever except this body if you believe he was the god of Moses the god of Paul the god of is the same God he's the same God that you worship he can do the same thing he did yesterday amen says how can we trust a god God even if I'm sick oh I love this says notice mar mar her attitude in front of the pressure she got that's what changed the thing the attitude of the give the results and the attitude of M prod the results your attitude can produce results can you believe that now listen brother bham oh I love this say the same message paragraph 48 I believe people different paragraph but our Prophet is telling us do you love the prophet do you really love the prophet here before reading it you see brother says in the message the god who's rich in Mercy he said God brought out Israel from Egypt to bring them in Canan says he brought them out by the wings of God now the wings of God it's not the wings that people draw today God with wings those are not the wings that people draw today that's not it if you want to you can come and see me I'll give you the cot says those wings were the prophets the wings of the god is of the prophet he says as long as [Applause] Israel trusted Moses they were following what Moses was seeing those were the wings of God for is that's how God took them to the promised land today we had another Moses and he explained to us the Bible when we follow what he says when we believe what he says I'm more than persuaded I'm on the wings of God and when I'm on the wings of God I'm in the city in the zone of Amen says 48 we remember trusting his word you said can I trust when I'm sick sure look at listen my brother maybe you sick maybe you have a problem listen brother can I trust him when I'm sick sure yes yes look at Mary or when a brother was dead and she sent for Jesus and instead of coming he went away and she s again look for Jesus when his brother Lazarus was sick M said go ask Jesus to come instead of Jesus to come Jesus went away sometime Jesus does things but it's never late he knows what he's doing amen now brother bam says her brother was dying and she she sent look for Jesus and he went away instead and she said again and he went further there are people praying it's as if more you the more you pray it's as if the the heaven is closed news to tell you you don't need to discourage as M Keep On Believing because Jesus knows the best time everything he does it's always perfect amen amen and M instead of getting mad I heard a sister there in Africa she said fasted I've prayed I did this God doesn't want to answer me I just forsake this message I told her you're a human being you don't need to to drop it you have to be like you know Jesus preaches the perseverance to have perseverance when we pray now look at Mark that didn't B matter the only hope for M it was Jesus Christ but she called Jesus instead of Jesus come Jesus went away Lazarus dead they call Jesus Jesus please come your friend Lazar dead instead of Jesus to come Jesus went further somebody's praying you pray today you want to receive it today maybe sometime God is teaching you what called patience because in the Statue of perfect man when you have faith you had virt knowledge Temperance patience a faith that does not have patience it's not a fa amen she didn't she was not ashamed she still believed that that was the Lord even though Jesus didn't come I still believe I still believe in him and Lazarus after dying they cried they took Lazarus they buried him when he was buried Jesus went further it was as if when Mar was calling the more was call Jus was kept on going away the more you pray is like as if the situation is getting worse and the devil will take over to tell you you see your God just for that's not for you especially today they might tell you you see how many years you've been praying you see you're not healed this are the devil m it was not discouraged for the same trust she was in Jes before calling him it was the same trust even when Jesus didn't answer the prayer what happened after Lazarus was buried three days after it was that when Jesus showed up our God is complicated Jesus with all the trust people put in you you just waited when everything is done yes that's how Jesus does when when he got there if somebody can catch this you prayed a lot nobody came to to visit you you you you spend night of prayer people prayed for you but it's as if nothing Chang don't change who by his worries by his worries of can change the length of his life who can do it trust God God he never late says the more your trial the greater will be your amen amen while everything was done see the pastor Jesus coming up they come to tell Mara Jesus is coming you called him he's coming the attitude of matter always happy always trust TR oh my Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't be dead but I know even now you can say something she didn't say I called you to come to come pray for me you didn't come you're not a servant of God says let me read it he said recognize that's your only place of Refuge when you are SE in the meeting and you are being pressured I didn't receive the prayer card I've seen people doing it they were so tensed they missed everything I see them standing in the prayer line in the meeting they come up and say you fighting you fighting all your kids I need this I need this don't do that come with boldness re come in the presence of God knowing that God made a promise that settled it Mar came up and said Lord if you would have been here listen she didn't say why didn't you come but she said if you would have been here my brother will not die but even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you I'm saying she let off the pressure because of that attitude though her eyes was stri with tears even though her feeble body was war but she she was at the feet but she could say this if you would have been here my brother would have not de but now even now whatever you ask God going to give it to you I like that yes [Music] sir and she got what she came for why she come up into presence not all Ste of oh my maybe sometime when we come to church yes it's true we might have problem we might have pressure but when we come let's show to God a good attitude you know you're coming to God you don't come to meet the pastor you don't come to meet the or whoo you come into the presence of God change your attitude because your attitude God is able to change just based on your attitude when we come into the presence of God we don't come as we are so frustrated we when problem comes to us we still this flesh I'm not saying you cannot cry even Jesus chry will even wh because we're still in this body but inside when the new birth is there it gives you a certain approach how you can approach to the many people think if an evangelist comes from somewhere he comes and he preach to preach he pray for the sick says and people are healed and people says that eventually has more power than our P say that's wrong he says it's expectation that people have toward the that what brings forth the results if you have the same expectation any other GI God will bring the same results am amen and Mary Mar has the same approach she was not Disturbed despite all she came with reverence you see oh oh she said we forsaken our denomination we came out to walk with you we thought you you you were our deliverer many people think we left those denominations we left there we came where they say the message but look at started my situation still God allows certain things to test you am amen and you know if you know that you got something with a lot of pain that's how you will know the value to give to that thing you got with pain it's by fighting and you got the things and you will know the value to give to it but things that is really given you won't pay more attention to it and God is that that's how God is M says Lord that's what he was for if you would have been here my brother would have would not been de died okay and she said again I know Lord that rise up in the last days and Jesus said I am the resurrection and life whoo Believes In Me will live is dead listen he wanted to see how much pressure he could put back on and this morning God want to put some pressure on you to see how you're going to react your attitude will bring forth God to accomplish what you need he wanted she wanted wanted to put some pressure on her but she wouldn't receive it when Jesus was telling her I'm the resurrection and life whosoever Believes In Me shall Jesus wanted to put some pressure M wouldn't receive it because she said I know he will rise up in the last day while Jesus was speaking of the present things she was seeing it in the future Jesus was putting some pressure can understand all things are possible for them that believe but Mary couldn't see it hallelujah amen and he said where's Lazarus and people say that's over there but look was speak he said remove the stone just remove of the stone this is the type of Inc as long as you have doubt in your life and the doctor always help with those kind of doubt you will not receive anything but Jesus went there he said up the roll out their unbelief when they remove the unbelief and the Bible says when Jesus looked at his friend Lazarus Jesus had compassion God who's rich in Mercy hallelujah hallelujah you know Israel they did a lot of mistakes while Israel was going to the promised land Israel was murmuring all the time they will murmur against the leader and one day they murmur so much against Moses in such a way God said I'm done with this I will punish them and God opened the the the the snakes and those snakes serpent just all the murmur and they were dead in Israel when Moses saw that he said Lord what's going on God always punish he never forget but but the people of Israel despite all that they said oh Moses we sinned against you and against God please pray so that God can deliver us God is rich in Mercy said I'm happy to have such a God because if it was just rich in money if he was just rich in material good yes he is but he was not rich in Mercy who could St here but gra despite all the mistakes of Israel once Israel recognized that they did wrong listen what God Said when Moses went there he said oh Father forgive what should I do and God told Moses take take the the brace make yourself a and put it on the pole and go there just put it there in front of the people whosoever will be beaten by the serpent his problem he just beaten by the serpent look up to the poor when you look up to the poor you'll be completely healed hallelujah hallelujah and Moses he took the serpent the serpent types this the and the bra which is already judged The Serpent and he took that braen serpent putting on the pole and he put it in front of the people and he told isra oh you Israel if you are beaten by the serpent just look up to that pole where is that present Ser look up there says serpent the Lord Jesus Christ who was dead for on the cross for your sin and my sins am amen goes further he says it doesn't require sincerity that didn't require sincerity to be healed that that didn't require to do some complic says it was so simple once you are beaten by the your problem either you're sincere or not just look up there once you look up there you are healed hallelujah hallelujah this morning you are sincere or not just look at the cross look to the one that took your sins away look to the one who said father forgive them they don't know what they do when you look up there every problem we find solution says in the seed of discrepancy 88 says oh my friend when God told Moses in the in the wilderness which was a type of him to lift up the brush serpent the BR represent sin judge the serpent represent the brush serpent represents sin already judged and the BR is divine judgment like like the where the sacrifice was laid also Elijah look up and say the sky was like like a br Divine judgment upon their unbelieving nation that back from God represent judgment and divine judgment and the serpent represents sin already judged says and Jesus was that serpent made sin for us and took the Judgment of God upon him he was wounded for our transgression Bru for our iniquity the CHS of our peace upon him and with his we are healed amen amen it was God who rich in Mercy that didn't want to finish all the people regardless of the mistakes he projected the mercy toward [Music] Israel the same God of Mercy his Mercy endure forever always there for you in that City of Refuge there is a mercy for whosoever will amen amen oh I love it says there is a place of Refuge in the time of death do you believe that do you believe

efforts and sacrifices they have done everything Lord and they love the word they want to be in line open that place of Refuge tonight oh God may you bring it to pass and if it's even tonight in this place of Prayer in their rooms wake them up from their dreams Lord pour your spirit onto them for them to find that rock oh God for their souls to be granted Lord we love you and we believe in you and you've said this in your word ask what you want and it shall be given to you if you dwell in me and my word dwelleth in you ask what you will oh God I try to keep each precept of your word even if organizations have rejected me and all the others but I believe it still I've taken position for it now answer my prayer I pray for each one of them I cry for each every one of them oh God may all of

forward [Music] Jesus [Music] Jesus sing to the father [Applause] father [Music] father oh holy spirit speak be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] gracious heavenly [Music] father so long as your name is in our mouths we know that hell is trembling because brother brandham says even the weak weest Christian of all when they bow their head and call on the name of Jesus Christ and starts to pray hell starts to tremble truly we believe that hell is trembling by the power of the word that has been preached Lord what Grace to hear such things as one day you said many sought to hear what you are hearing but it hasn't been given to them but for you it's been given it's the food that you've kept in store and when the food is kept in [Music] store it's for us to take the key to open the place where the food is kept and to take forth and eat of that food is nothing else but the word of the and everything that we need is found in this [Music] message to even have the medicine that could help us release that press found in the Bible and in the message time where the pressure is everywhere even our sisters our little brothers Lord they come and they even at school that there's even us at work there's so much pressure Lord the doctors that could do something they go through pressures sometimes even in church there's even pressures but the world doesn't know have that remedy that could solve that problem turn our sight towards and they go and take drugs and drink an alcohol thinking that they could release that brother brandom says the act of drinking the act of smoking that is not going to release pressure but that on the other hand is add to the pressure oh God one day they asked to a small go why are you taking drugs and he said that it helps me release depression but if that helps you release the pressure why are you finding yourself in places it'll never release the pressure but the only thing that could help us release word Lord that's why we want to receive your word in our hearts so that when pressure comes once again that we can seek refuge in you Lord I remember one day Moses had so much pressure to one to the point where he said I have I don't have the breast so I can give so that they don't seek me Lord there was so much pressure one day our Prophet was going through so much pressure to a point where he even li when he left he said why did you do that but the prophet said I was there but your servant was going through pressures one day even M herself was going through so much pressure to a point where she even asked brother you not Joseph and brother Bram said I can't do it but she closed the door at the difference Lord you took position for your service you told him to go pray to go repent because you didn't like that but for Ma you told your servant go and talk to her she has saddened the Holy Spirit and the prophet went towards and the prophet said to Ma I want to talk to you Ma you know how much I love you you have done it sad in the Holy Spirit God you you didn't like it so much that even her attitude wasn't correct towards your servant and Lord you Afflicted her so bad and father the one thing you sent your Prophet to that and when the prophet went towards that breach he interceded for me and you acted father wouldn't you act in this place Lord look among if there is a wife her attitude towards you because of pressure if it wasn't right father as they taught us you're rich in Mercy can you be merciful to Lord to give her the solution to her problems to give us the solution to our illnesses father Grant it father for your love Among Us father those who are going through difficult pressures give them Solutions because you are the as we have been taught the sin has already been judged father we know that the powerful Angel has already come with the pillar of fire and interceded for us that that we don't by your blood now have it Lord oh Father can't you come once more with that same applied on all of us as we've
