[13:25] young bullock of the two of two and two

[16:10] as we look away unto you
[16:13] in the name of jesus christ we pray

[16:21] once again i'll greet
[16:22] each one of you in the name of the lord
[16:24] jesus christ
[16:28] happy to see each one of you
[16:33] all the strangers in the in our
[16:41] we believe that we are brothers of like
[16:43] precious faith
[16:50] as we look into the world
[16:53] i would like to continue with lord with
[16:56] building the lord's tabernacle today
[17:02] as we started it uh
[17:04] since uh
[17:05] the passover
[17:10] i'm still enjoying everything that the
[17:12] lord is opening
[17:18] even though we might not be able to
[17:19] preach everything here
[17:21] no means
[17:23] because uh in verse 22 pascal
[17:27] vander
[17:28] and when you reap the harvest of your
[17:30] land
[17:33] that shall not make clean riddance of
[17:35] the corners of thy field when they're
[17:37] reapers
[17:41] not everything will be preached
[17:46] because the lord himself says ask a
[17:48] senior remember
[17:49] thou shalt not make clean readings
[17:57] not everything will be preached
[18:00] because we have to leave other things to
[18:02] force somebody else to preach them
[18:07] neither shall thou gather and any
[18:09] gleaning of thy harvest
[18:36] you shall find that somewhere else so
[18:38] you will not be able to do it
[18:46] we shall be unable to gather everything
[18:52] because one grain will go into the land
[18:54] basket
[19:02] amen amen
[19:03] we shall continue with uh building the
[19:06] lord's tabernacle no continuous
[19:11] just to be able to help everybody to
[19:14] follow along
[19:18] we'll have to review a little bit of the
[19:20] seven
[19:21] seven feasts along
[19:25] and then we shall be able to fall
[19:27] between the 607 trumpet
[19:33] but god's grace and from there will
[19:35] probably will close
[19:51] all depends on us is that that the
[19:53] apostle module amen amen
[19:56] it's sunday silly demons the day of the
[19:59] lord
[20:01] no rush honesty
[20:03] and we shall not tarry either
[20:06] day
[20:08] but it just depends on the
[20:10] leading of the spirit that's remarked
[20:11] upon the country
[20:14] we understand that uh the
[20:17] feast of the lord no company
[20:22] were given unto the children of israel
[20:25] israel is god's program commonly
[20:28] programmed this year and the children of
[20:30] israel and citizens
[20:32] when they came out of
[20:34] egypt
[20:36] egypt
[20:37] the lord has brought them about uh out
[20:40] of egypt into the wilderness
[20:45] we saw that there was have to be a
[20:47] qualifying lamb
[20:53] during the passover
[20:55] and uh during that time
[20:58] the lord himself had to choose to give
[21:01] the characteristics of the land
[21:03] listening
[21:07] that has to qualify for that specific
[21:09] purpose
[21:12] specifically and that lamb has to die
[21:35] and the lord gives us more information
[21:38] on those
[21:39] don't preach the information
[21:41] that when the lamb died they caught a
[21:43] new mirror
[21:44] there has to be a burial de vitiavor de
[21:47] lantern and the grain
[21:51] was to represent the feast of the
[21:53] unleavened bread they represented the
[21:56] fate of the on level and under the
[21:58] feasting of the unleavened bread you
[22:00] conducted faith depends on the verb the
[22:02] lord has to
[22:04] the people have to bake the bread
[22:06] without leaving legend
[22:10] do a song
[22:11] and
[22:12] the people had to consume it for seven
[22:14] days
[22:17] and the servants of god came along
[22:22] to speak of uh god's burial all day is
[22:25] us
[22:26] his death after the after his
[22:28] crucifixion
[22:32] crucifixion after burmese prison
[22:38] the pastor came on easter morning or the
[22:40] rising of the sun services
[22:45] to show his resurrection
[22:48] and in the same book of uh
[22:51] exodus
[22:53] the lord has said that you shall have
[22:55] two lambs
[22:58] one has to be killed
[23:01] and the other one has to be released
[23:05] showing his death and his resurrection
[23:09] and when his resurrection came about
[23:11] because resurrection
[23:13] the lord gave again more information
[23:17] that the sheave has to be waved before
[23:20] the people
[23:28] and the lord did not finish his program
[23:33] then we came about by god's grace
[23:37] did you with uh the feast of the weeks
[23:41] this amen what house shall thou build me
[23:44] back
[23:46] when the lord was coming along the
[23:48] senior
[23:49] he had all these plans in his mind ave
[23:53] to say
[23:55] and as he was delivering the program he
[23:57] called me delivery
[23:59] he had to use moses for that specific
[24:02] purpose
[24:04] specifically to help the people
[24:06] understand where they were going
[24:10] that he didn't call the people out of
[24:12] egypt just for them to hang around in a
[24:15] papillary purple disorder
[24:23] in order to fulfill this purpose
[24:27] and at the end of the feast of the week
[24:30] that i fed the cement or the feast of
[24:32] the pentecost who are affected
[24:35] then the lord has to
[24:38] bring out other information
[24:42] information because the people had to
[24:44] choose what kind of house are were they
[24:46] going to build him
[24:51] then the lord says and see they send
[24:53] your id at the end of these i'll offend
[24:56] this cc you shall count 50 days
[25:01] because this is the longest feast quest
[25:04] this is the longest period
[25:08] and the servants of god that came about
[25:10] again from brother
[25:12] ben
[25:27] during this feast basketball dossier
[25:31] has to know how to behave
[25:35] has to live under a certain atmosphere
[25:39] atmosphere under that such atmosphere
[25:42] suicides the atmosphere the lord has
[25:44] given him his spirit listen you are
[25:47] doing his son is free with spirit of
[25:49] wisdom they split their success and to
[25:51] be able to do all kind of work
[25:56] we see that this is applies also to the
[25:58] church
[25:59] application
[26:01] to a family
[26:03] to the preacher or predicate to every
[26:05] ministry in the household
[26:07] minister minister
[26:09] and when the lord was giving the people
[26:12] these abilities
[26:16] the people had to respond also
[26:21] and how were they going to do it
[26:37] being projected
[26:39] the people had the love to also teach
[26:42] others
[26:45] they were not uh just keeping everything
[26:47] to themselves
[26:50] because you have received without any
[26:52] prices
[26:55] and you also have to give without any
[26:57] price
[27:00] nevertheless
[27:02] you have to do it willingly
[27:05] it was not something to be pushed upon
[27:10] they don't have to constrain you to do
[27:12] it
[27:14] but the lord said
[27:16] i have laid down my life
[27:48] people who just forsook the world
[27:52] they said that it's not the time to do
[27:54] to build the house of the lord
[27:58] it's just time for us to go make our own
[28:00] good
[28:15] and if you carry on with just your own
[28:18] projects
[28:21] and you're only placing money in the bag
[28:24] with holes
[28:28] people
[28:55] how everybody have to come to that same
[28:57] umbrella
[29:02] how the father has to love the mother
[29:06] how the children have to be to obey to
[29:09] the parents
[29:18] in order to understand the sister of
[29:21] pentacles
[29:24] because this is the longest period
[29:28] the lord has done his part
[29:31] and the church has to do it
[29:34] and he carried on he'll continue and
[29:37] give us gave us also more information
[29:41] when he preached can you appreciate the
[29:43] contest
[29:45] and under the contest jesus
[29:48] people had to understand that the
[29:50] challenges have to come
[29:52] legendary but putting on all the arbors
[29:56] mentioned in ephesians 6.
[30:02] people were able to work accordingly
[30:06] yes
[30:09] because when they you can look in the
[30:12] book of nehemiah
[30:14] did not deliver the name because there
[30:16] was a withstand against the people of
[30:18] god
[30:19] resistance
[30:35] the enemies of the jews
[30:37] they were plotting against the words
[30:42] then every one of us stood in his post
[30:44] allah
[30:47] in order to be able to build the house
[30:53] every one of us has to understand this
[30:55] position
[30:57] a mother is a mother a married man a
[31:00] father as a father prepare
[31:05] each person has to progress in the
[31:07] ministry
[31:10] and this progression or this growth into
[31:12] the ministry
[31:15] give people the understanding
[31:28] at what level the walls were already
[31:46] but the work has to be done according to
[31:49] god's program
[31:51] the program during the time that god has
[31:54] given you
[31:56] because when the people when the people
[31:59] understood it
[32:02] they said that we started to work
[32:05] here some of us held the spear
[32:09] one of the tools of the baron anderson
[32:26] it's god's program sit down the program
[32:28] did you god wants to see it being done
[32:31] during that time
[32:34] and therefore
[32:37] when it takes all these elements
[32:41] he shows us
[32:42] that these are not just our things that
[32:44] we come and we preach out of the blues
[32:50] but these are things that the lord wants
[32:53] us to be aware of he says
[32:57] in order to be able to be effective in
[33:00] the work that we do
[33:04] because uh if a man does not plan ahead
[33:08] of what he is supposed to do
[33:13] the men will surely fail
[33:18] if there's no vision see apart
[33:20] people perish
[33:37] because when we are planning
[33:40] we plan according to what we have known
[33:46] that's why our faith
[33:49] is built upon the apostles and the
[33:52] prophets
[33:55] because the appropriate apostle and the
[33:57] prophet have done a certain way
[34:03] and the apostle and the prophets
[34:07] have built upon what they have learned
[34:09] in the old testament
[34:14] and when the prophet come around
[34:16] the prophet
[34:17] he shows us
[34:18] that
[34:22] we have to take it from genesis to a
[34:24] revelation
[34:26] apocalypse then the picture becomes
[34:28] clear hello
[34:30] that's why all the sermons are just
[34:32] mentioned to us
[34:36] in order for us to make us clear in what
[34:39] we're doing
[34:42] we can't go just uh one preach one thing
[34:45] the other one preach another
[35:14] the person does not just build because
[35:16] he feels that i have to make a cut here
[35:23] the sisters do not just dress because
[35:25] they feel that they can dress this way
[35:41] they can have makeups today and tomorrow
[35:55] we came from word to flesh
[36:00] but we didn't come from the word to our
[36:02] theophany menace
[36:05] as it was with jesus christ jesus but
[36:08] then this jesus alex is jesus he was the
[36:11] unleavened bread
[36:14] he said who shall accuse me of sinning
[36:18] because his life was a pattern
[36:22] islam was an example
[36:53] they also have this understanding of
[36:56] comprehension that we shall also go
[36:58] through the same process as the lord
[37:00] jesus christ
[37:04] and when the lord jesus christ went
[37:06] through a lot of struggles
[37:10] having no place to raise his head
[37:14] having a weakness to eat avedi
[37:18] and all these elements to sizzle
[37:25] [Music]
[37:35] la parola as it is given unto us
[37:40] then exodus 36
[37:43] verse 1
[37:45] then wrote belsalil and holy hab
[37:48] i
[37:51] and every wise
[37:53] every and everyone is hearted man a two
[37:57] thumb scishow in whom the lord put
[37:59] wisdom and understanding to know how to
[38:02] work all manner of work for the service
[38:05] of the sanctuary
[38:14] according to all that the lord had
[38:16] commended fear two seconds
[38:19] and moses called belle
[38:21] and oliab
[38:25] and every wise-hearted man in whose the
[38:27] lord had put wisdom
[38:30] intelligence
[38:33] even everyone whose heart steered him up
[38:36] to come on to the work to do it
[38:44] amen amen the people also had to have
[38:47] the desire to do the work the pepe de
[38:50] vocia vallee des pour a complete level
[38:52] the people just didn't
[38:54] no they have to call me first no
[38:57] yes there are people who will be
[39:11] not to be big can you do it papua come
[39:15] on the future affair but to do the work
[39:20] and they received of moses all the
[39:23] offerings
[39:26] which the children of israel had brought
[39:29] for the work of the service of the
[39:30] sanctuary
[39:33] verse 3.
[39:39] to make it with all poor affair and they
[39:42] brought yet unto him free offerings
[39:45] every morning
[39:48] volunteer as the work was has to be
[39:51] progressing
[39:53] as the work has to be done completely
[40:08] you see the sweet shack matter during
[40:11] which time but not get done the longest
[40:13] period of time
[40:16] how long will your ministry last
[40:18] combined
[40:20] the lord himself knows no remember
[40:27] until every single piece of the
[40:30] tabernacle is in place
[40:33] yes
[40:34] one plus but the lord gives you wisdom
[41:04] and where do you get receive all that
[41:06] from eco questions
[41:08] you see moses
[41:10] and where did moses get it from here
[41:13] god himself you said yeah remember
[41:15] because moses had to go into the clouds
[41:31] out of the edges this disaster comes the
[41:34] seals
[41:35] out of the seals they saw the trumpets
[41:38] and the trumpets out of the trumpets
[41:40] just to trumpet the plagues then they
[41:42] play
[41:43] all this
[41:45] god giving us information don't listen
[41:48] for me to know where we're standing
[41:51] because when you understand where the
[41:53] church is standing at position like in
[41:55] the church ages
[42:01] then you know what to preach to the
[42:02] church
[42:06] because some of us are still children
[42:11] desiring sincere milk of the world
[42:27] looks at your children regardless of how
[42:30] the child is growing
[42:32] from croissants how look at how this one
[42:35] is still struggling with the word
[42:36] regards
[42:39] some have to be told exactly what to do
[43:11] and the children have known how to obey
[43:13] the mothers are saying eliza
[43:17] the children follows the mother saying
[43:22] and all these elements do says anymore
[43:25] the lord is giving us some more
[43:28] information listen don't preach the
[43:30] information in order to do the work
[43:33] because when the lord is giving us these
[43:36] basket calls
[43:37] you see it's to protect us
[43:41] in order to be able to fulfill really
[43:44] what he sees to be done
[43:46] that completely secure this is my
[43:49] beloved son
[43:51] he him
[44:19] i have to do my father's will completely
[44:23] this was no longer under governance
[44:28] but then it says
[44:30] when i was a child
[44:32] i spoke as a child
[44:34] as
[44:36] [Music]
[45:01] but then by our behavior
[45:17] if somebody has to follow up on how
[45:19] you're growing in your spiritual life
[45:21] again
[45:22] they said
[45:23] we're still under governors you know
[45:25] someone called us
[45:27] but then
[45:28] we're still under governors no more
[45:45] lao de whatever because then afterwards
[45:47] you born with the spirit
[45:51] and you have to come to the adoptions
[45:55] because as this child the the adoption
[45:58] sets in
[46:13] have voila you have to have the wisdom
[46:17] you have to have the understanding
[46:20] and all these things
[46:22] are given to us
[46:24] in order for us to be able to see where
[46:26] we're standing
[46:28] [Music]
[46:48] because in acts 10 verse 9
[46:52] and we see that this follows the
[46:55] ministry of elijah the prophet and the
[46:57] son of man
[46:58] [Music]
[47:01] because jesus
[47:04] elijah ellis
[47:06] has to present the land
[47:09] which in the old testament was a shadow
[47:11] sentence
[47:13] and jesus he
[47:15] took the disciples
[47:18] by taking the disciples
[47:20] he trained the disciples
[47:40] many times that's where the churches
[47:42] fall into please please your office
[47:45] but in the book of uh
[47:47] exodus we just read only
[48:05] they only call bells
[48:08] and it's only belts on here
[48:12] no no
[48:14] only the commission was given only to
[48:16] such a person
[48:31] it's not because you have not seen how
[48:33] the person was called
[48:36] a person
[48:37] then uh you said like you know he is
[48:39] really called to the ministry
[48:43] god puts the potential in a man
[48:46] he does not ask any favor from nobody in
[48:49] the demand of the person it's not the
[48:51] laying of hands that makes him demand
[48:53] the receivers
[48:58] no no but the ministry is born with the
[49:01] men
[49:04] but the ministry has to grow eleminis
[49:08] each ministry has to sit under a certain
[49:10] umbrella
[49:15] in order to grow accordingly
[49:20] and when jesus came about he consciously
[49:23] even knew he dealt with the disciples
[49:25] the disciples which then afterward
[49:55] because they had to wait for a certain
[49:57] period of time
[50:01] but they didn't just like you know came
[50:03] out of the world and straight into the
[50:05] upper room
[50:09] that's why i'm saying
[50:10] we
[50:26] and he ended up as official of souls
[50:34] has to go through a lot of sharpening
[50:39] he has to be uh it has to be cut
[50:42] cut away certain things out of his life
[50:46] that's why when you get into
[50:48] sanctification
[50:52] you have to understand and enjoy the
[50:54] process
[50:58] you don't have to have weeks
[51:05] you don't have to have a high heels
[51:10] yes it's hard we said you do but it is a
[51:14] process messy and prostitution
[51:16] because there's a work ahead basketball
[51:18] completely because if you don't
[51:20] understand there's a work ahead
[51:24] that's why you're still holding on to
[51:25] this thing
[51:28] they tell you like you know you have to
[51:29] show up at a certain time
[51:34] and that is only preparing you for
[51:37] greater responsibilities
[51:45] it shall be in greater ones let's say
[51:48] i'll sit on the ground
[52:04] everything that was preached to you
[52:07] appreciate you have to believe them all
[52:09] you do
[52:10] though we might not always understand
[52:16] but we only believe me
[52:17] [Applause]
[52:19] that's why the prophet says
[52:21] only believe only believe once or more
[52:24] all things are possible
[52:27] but for what what is it being made for
[52:30] possible
[52:44] first experience and then you're going
[52:46] to mess up the work i see
[52:50] because the angel basket launcher who
[52:52] flew from the presence of god
[52:56] to touch the uh the lips of isaiah
[53:01] had to be in a certain position
[53:04] certain position in humility
[53:08] being unseen and unheard of
[53:12] and not be speaking your own things
[53:16] but to do exactly what the lord tells
[53:19] you to do okay exactly
[53:21] because you'll find isaiah in a certain
[53:24] position
[53:26] because isaiah all that he had known all
[53:29] these years is just the king
[53:34] the king was a role model to him
[53:37] the king was somebody you look up to
[53:55] because if you don't have an angel to
[53:57] look up to business
[54:00] then you don't know how to go along
[54:03] because isaiah looked himself
[54:06] he said that my communists turned into
[54:08] corruption
[54:23] say
[54:25] but then
[54:27] when you come before the lord
[54:29] they want to say yeah all that you say
[54:31] that's not mother name
[54:34] i know oh we should say i i have no
[54:37] knowledge gel reconnaissance according
[54:39] to what we have done
[54:40] second fair but what does the word say
[54:44] what do you know of the word
[54:48] what does the word show you how to
[54:49] behave
[55:04] or the feast of pentacles
[55:07] the lord listen yeah he brings out the
[55:10] disciples he'll amend the disciples and
[55:12] the disciples come around the disciples
[55:14] they look at the situation
[55:17] he said that for these people to do the
[55:19] work
[55:21] they have first to be filled with the
[55:23] spirit
[55:26] that's why the prophet says
[55:32] don't get married
[55:34] don't start a work in a certain ministry
[55:38] until you are first born again
[55:43] it is very important
[55:46] because your culture will fool you
[55:52] your knowledge will fool you
[55:56] by the time you come to do the work
[56:00] you come with a lot
[56:14] that looks and everything else here is
[56:17] some like two with
[56:19] less than a boat sof
[56:21] number two
[56:23] it will look like everything else
[56:26] assembly are two
[56:28] with their
[56:35] you look like everything else you
[56:37] resemble
[56:38] than the christians sophie
[56:41] but you'll be so close to porsche
[56:45] it looks like it
[56:46] is
[56:47] but it's not mesene palace
[56:50] because the deceiver today vasquez said
[56:52] the kyogre should be it will look so
[56:54] close
[56:56] to porsche
[57:24] yes you have to grow we need to do a
[57:26] grander but understand
[57:29] the things that you are struggling with
[57:33] is just delaying the work
[57:37] you only investing in what you think is
[57:39] best for you
[57:43] that shows that you're stubborn
[57:46] that's why when i'm in the prayer life
[57:50] he sees a minister come
[57:52] on
[57:54] [Music]
[58:00] he said you obedient a disobedience who
[58:02] do the word of god they treat this
[58:03] obesity
[58:04] did you god told you to do one thing was
[58:06] that
[58:34] precious spices
[58:37] oh our precious sister
[58:39] sir yet a sinner
[58:46] obedience to the word lobe son sarah
[58:53] it's better than sacrifice say
[58:55] sacrifice yes i go to church with your
[58:57] valley yes i do this jewish officers but
[59:00] god is requiring total obedience
[59:31] shall be made without leavening that
[59:33] dwight confess only and afterwards
[59:36] it becomes a wave sheath
[59:41] amen it was our example
[59:44] he
[59:58] i have to forsake many things
[1:00:02] william branham william put that
[1:00:04] television
[1:00:06] television he could have protected
[1:00:07] himself he proves deportation remember
[1:00:09] but the children may listen for but the
[1:00:12] church
[1:00:13] by the rest of them
[1:00:16] they were looking at to him
[1:00:18] what kind of wave shift shall you do
[1:00:22] what kind of tabernacle are you going to
[1:00:24] build
[1:00:26] is
[1:00:41] and the lord
[1:00:42] is bringing out the disciples yeah men
[1:00:45] the disciples the disciples have now
[1:00:46] after receiving the spirit
[1:00:50] verse nine you'll say nothing on the
[1:00:52] moral domain approach
[1:01:02] as
[1:01:03] they went on the journey coming mache
[1:01:06] and drew knight onto the city this
[1:01:08] approaches
[1:01:13] the house stopped to pray about the
[1:01:15] sixth hour
[1:01:18] and he came very hungry
[1:01:21] and i would have have eaten but while
[1:01:24] they they met already
[1:01:29] he fell into a trance he leaves
[1:01:33] ecstasy and saw heaven opened
[1:01:38] and a certain vessel descending on to
[1:01:40] him he invites the son don't come in
[1:01:42] control as it had been a great
[1:01:46] neater at the
[1:01:48] at the four corners they coming to
[1:02:11] and creeping things it shows a ki rom
[1:02:14] and unfolds of the air it is
[1:02:17] yellow and there came a voice to him
[1:02:24] yeah kill
[1:02:25] two and eat a monk but peter said
[1:02:30] not so lord no poison yeah for i have
[1:02:32] never eaten anything that is common or
[1:02:36] unclean
[1:02:40] and the voice speaks unto him again
[1:02:43] the second time
[1:02:45] what god have
[1:02:56] and the vessel was received up inhaling
[1:02:59] to again into heaven eleven
[1:03:02] the lord is bringing peter into the
[1:03:05] ministry
[1:03:08] that's why it is important to receive
[1:03:09] the spirit
[1:03:11] important
[1:03:12] please we see that peter no
[1:03:14] peter
[1:03:43] peter received from god
[1:03:46] god was showing him what kind of
[1:03:48] ministry he has to deal with
[1:03:52] what kind of people he has to deal with
[1:03:56] but where did the people come from do
[1:03:58] escalations the bible says
[1:04:01] heaven open up
[1:04:03] the people came from heaven
[1:04:06] and they came down
[1:04:08] and what is god's doing
[1:04:10] you're
[1:04:52] it has to smell like the sheep what
[1:04:54] santiago baby he has to laugh like the
[1:04:57] sheep do us
[1:04:59] no no no no no i cannot hang out with
[1:05:01] them
[1:05:03] no no no no no no no no me i am holy
[1:05:06] sweet son no no your holiness is not
[1:05:10] what god is saying
[1:05:12] but his holiness message oh your
[1:05:15] holiness
[1:05:16] depends on him who has called you
[1:05:20] and what
[1:05:31] this is the what the god has given you
[1:05:34] say
[1:05:50] amen amen let's go to verse one of the
[1:05:52] same chapter
[1:05:56] because it requires to give us more
[1:05:59] information
[1:06:01] about information by having more
[1:06:03] information
[1:06:04] for myself it helps us to understand
[1:06:06] even better san jose
[1:06:09] there was a certain man in caesarea
[1:06:11] called the cornelius essentially of of
[1:06:14] uh the benedict
[1:06:16] of the band called the italian band
[1:06:24] the
[1:06:24] the bible is giving us
[1:06:27] who where the man was
[1:06:42] just as we deal with people here
[1:06:44] community
[1:06:51] which gave much homes to the people for
[1:06:53] example
[1:06:55] and pray to god always april
[1:06:58] the man was doing his earthly journey
[1:07:00] lump isaiah compresses some where's the
[1:07:02] best of his knowledge
[1:07:04] everything that he did
[1:07:06] but the bible says
[1:07:08] in the channel of communication
[1:07:11] he saw in a vision even evidently
[1:07:16] about the ninth hour of the day of the
[1:07:18] la nevia mel de jour which is 3 p.m our
[1:07:21] time
[1:07:23] an angel of god coming into coming into
[1:07:26] in to him
[1:07:29] and saying unto him
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:32] and when he looked on him
[1:07:36] he was afraid
[1:07:37] and he said
[1:07:39] what is it lord yes senior
[1:08:08] giving himself to the world
[1:08:13] he said this man is persevering
[1:08:17] this man is moving forward
[1:08:20] and now it is time now to take him a
[1:08:21] little bit higher
[1:08:36] is not enough
[1:08:38] listen
[1:08:39] praying in the church is not enough
[1:08:42] to be good to people is not enough it
[1:08:44] can be a regular pepsi oh no it is just
[1:08:47] enough just like you know to love people
[1:08:49] say i said the email and then
[1:09:03] this man has enough money said thomas
[1:09:06] said that this man is a manager at work
[1:09:08] they told me
[1:09:10] this man had went to school
[1:09:13] this man is a devout man
[1:09:16] but he says
[1:09:18] and now sentimental job
[1:09:20] now
[1:09:22] and a call for one simon if every new
[1:09:24] seymour whose surname is peter yes you
[1:09:27] know me pierre and they just said
[1:09:28] sometimes we give ourselves nicknames
[1:09:32] you know it's not bad it's in a person
[1:09:35] it's the bible
[1:09:36] enlarge with one simon ethanol
[1:09:42] whose house is by the sea side yes
[1:09:46] he shall tell thee what you dow outers
[1:09:49] to do
[1:09:52] verse 6
[1:10:00] uh
[1:10:22] [Applause]
[1:10:29] but at this moment
[1:10:32] the men had to grow a little higher lump
[1:10:37] and the angel comes through the channel
[1:10:39] of communication
[1:10:42] that's why we preach on the makeup of
[1:10:43] the bride here
[1:10:48] or the conception concept
[1:10:51] in that conception of the bride
[1:10:54] we understand that each person god has
[1:10:57] given them a channel for communications
[1:11:03] in numbers
[1:11:06] moses
[1:11:07] miriam
[1:11:08] and aaron
[1:11:10] god told
[1:11:23] i'll come through a dream
[1:12:06] the next fellow a lot of what's that it
[1:12:09] might not have those channels of
[1:12:10] communication
[1:12:13] and he might start doubting it
[1:12:16] all these things
[1:12:18] oh no they cannot be
[1:12:25] the importance to stay in a certain
[1:12:27] atmosphere
[1:12:30] because at that time at the uh the ninth
[1:12:32] hour
[1:12:34] or
[1:12:41] that shows that it's not the first time
[1:12:43] that the lord speaks to a man
[1:12:46] for him to say
[1:12:52] because if it's the first time what's
[1:12:54] this is that
[1:12:55] like william branham i'm going with him
[1:12:56] i've heard the voice so many times
[1:12:59] but then when the angel came
[1:13:02] physically
[1:13:16] don't know she take care then fear left
[1:13:18] me
[1:13:19] because he was able to recognize
[1:13:22] him
[1:13:24] who was able to i have received the
[1:13:26] visitation of the angels
[1:13:29] in a certain leadership
[1:13:42] and when the angel was uh which expect
[1:13:44] to anto
[1:14:11] as the lord dealt with uh
[1:14:39] you're going to pray for the sikhs all
[1:14:40] over the world
[1:14:44] but lord
[1:14:45] i'm not able to do it
[1:14:48] i have no education
[1:14:50] i don't qualify to do the work
[1:14:53] it's not about your qualifications
[1:15:50] struggling with
[1:16:04] but then when you have to move a little
[1:16:05] bit higher
[1:16:08] but then you start struggling alone
[1:16:11] what this vision which he had
[1:16:14] he had seen should mean behold
[1:16:18] now while peter doubted in himself
[1:16:22] remember what this vision which he had
[1:16:24] seen
[1:16:29] behold
[1:16:30] the men which was sent from cornelius
[1:16:36] inquiry for simon's house
[1:16:40] and stood before the gate they sat in
[1:16:42] here
[1:16:44] when the men received the commission god
[1:16:56] is only holding the unbeliever himself
[1:17:00] but then the lord is only proceeding
[1:17:02] with his ministry with his problems
[1:17:05] well peter you're still struggling
[1:17:10] do i have the knowledge to do it yes
[1:17:13] am i ready to do it
[1:17:16] the men were standing at the door no i'm
[1:17:18] sitting in this
[1:17:19] many times that's what it is use your
[1:17:21] first secret i don't know this is a
[1:17:23] person i don't have damage
[1:17:25] but i have first to have the knowledge
[1:17:27] of this
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:54] that's why that's how you understand
[1:17:56] people's ministries
[1:17:59] [Applause]
[1:18:10] people already
[1:19:06] the lord is not waiting for your
[1:19:07] approval
[1:19:11] no no he says that you know the work
[1:19:13] must be done
[1:19:15] at this particular time

[1:25:59] them together
[1:26:04] as the preacher
[1:26:06] in the position
[1:26:21] the knowledge you with the angel
[1:26:23] the holy spirit in you
[1:26:25] leading you on how to do the work
[1:26:29] otherwise
[1:26:30] the child is struggling to grow long
[1:26:32] force it back but you are the very
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:27:44] when you deal
[1:27:52] and how to lead them to get them out of
[1:27:55] the situation
[1:27:57] but don't push them into the dish no
[1:27:59] more
[1:28:02] the bread is already falling
[1:28:05] their sister is already following they
[1:28:07] share your job is not to keep them in
[1:28:09] the dish
[1:28:12] but your job is to take them out
[1:28:15] and how do you take them out fully
[1:28:18] how do you bring them out for the
[1:28:20] effects of you ah i thought you were a
[1:28:22] christian
[1:28:23] secretary of state
[1:28:25] you've been lying to us you know
[1:28:40] the child is growing wisconsin
[1:28:43] now he passed from my uh from tutors
[1:28:45] onto governors
[1:28:49] and that the child has to grow
[1:28:52] and the child is being in communication
[1:28:56] amen amen then verse 421
[1:29:00] then appear went down to the man which
[1:29:02] was sent unto him from cornelius
[1:29:05] appeared they thought they said
[1:29:07] and said
[1:29:09] behold
[1:29:10] i am he whom he is sick
[1:29:14] what is it the cause where uh wherefore
[1:29:17] you are come killed
[1:29:20] and they said
[1:29:21] cornelius the centurion
[1:30:05] but these soldiers messes up they could
[1:30:08] testify he proved
[1:30:10] even his absence members on absence he
[1:30:13] said that man this thomas is adjustment
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:32] an understanding
[1:31:28] when they can even see that he did this
[1:31:30] uh
[1:31:31] with uh he did it um
[1:31:34] it it did us with with all his mind
[1:31:40] he lived
[1:31:43] but they still call him holi
[1:31:47] because when william branham william
[1:31:50] was standing on the pulpit and standing
[1:31:52] in the bridge
[1:31:57] when he was repenting to the people
[1:32:00] somebody in the room
[1:32:03] started doubting him
[1:32:05] just right there just the angel struck
[1:32:07] him
[1:32:09] to show
[1:32:10] despite
[1:32:42] you have to understand if yourself have
[1:32:44] already come through the feast of
[1:32:45] pentacles
[1:32:51] and of good reports
[1:32:59] and was won from god by an holy angel
[1:33:02] sent a sender to a 4d in in into his
[1:33:06] house
[1:33:18] many times that's what happened in our
[1:33:19] lives
[1:33:33] it's not because like you know yes they
[1:33:35] have to look at your holy senate
[1:33:38] considering
[1:33:39] then you start doing whatever you want
[1:33:41] to do
[1:33:42] no he was a devout man
[1:33:46] the people he had the understanding
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:58] come to church via gliese try a little
[1:34:01] bit and say uncle
[1:34:15] of the desire
[1:34:17] that you need to grow get to do a guns
[1:34:20] here but you do it expressly in your own
[1:34:23] thoughts merciful effect express
[1:34:26] just because the people have to take you
[1:34:28] holy basket
[1:34:29] legend consider
[1:34:44] 23 verse 17.
[1:34:51] and on the more of peter went away with
[1:34:53] them
[1:34:56] a certain brethren from joppa
[1:34:57] accompanied him
[1:35:05] and cornelius waited for them and and
[1:35:08] called together his kinsmen and and new
[1:35:11] friends cornelius
[1:35:38] because peter can look back at what
[1:35:41] happened
[1:35:43] and that gave him humility
[1:35:46] ah i doubted the vision
[1:35:50] oh these things is really true
[1:35:53] oh did the angel really spoke to me
[1:35:56] but then when you see somebody on the
[1:35:58] phone
[1:36:00] i never done this
[1:36:04] we will not debate with you
[1:36:06] we just look at the world
[1:36:08] we
[1:36:22] jesus christ
[1:36:24] that makes us us holy in our son despite
[1:36:28] of everything that we are we are about
[1:36:30] the sacrifice we are just men
[1:36:32] but when we look to christ
[1:36:34] he steps over he wants to see any
[1:36:50] but it also requires
[1:36:52] humility
[1:36:54] to speak of your weaknesses
[1:36:57] because many times you only speak about
[1:36:59] what is good
[1:37:01] you see me over here you see me
[1:37:04] me my testimony
[1:37:18] i'm going to kill him
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:46] that we never said to nobody
[1:37:48] india person we never confess
[1:37:51] but when you stand in front of the world
[1:37:55] but then in front of people
[1:37:57] i am holy i am holy spirit let's
[1:38:00] have the humility of paul of peter i
[1:38:03] only meditate the pier
[1:38:05] that's right that will help us to do the
[1:38:07] work
[1:38:09] yes lord i am born in sin we sent you
[1:38:12] all appreciated
[1:38:13] iniquity
[1:38:28] you may have never seen chippenham
[1:38:31] but your birth
[1:38:34] condemns you
[1:38:36] that humility said to me we will help
[1:38:39] you to do the work
[1:38:41] the preacher humble predication
[1:38:57] aside
[1:38:58] from the knowledge
[1:38:59] in egypt
[1:39:01] in order for god to use it
[1:39:04] the army came out in ezra
[1:39:08] and i have understanding
[1:39:10] now it's no more time of everything that
[1:39:12] we receive from egypt
[1:39:17] but we receive a new program
[1:39:20] program this year now in this program
[1:39:23] there's a way to behave
[1:39:38] so that when you can look at god's
[1:39:39] people that's a comfortable god you do
[1:39:41] not mistreat them
[1:39:43] because human nature
[1:39:46] is always to condemn you
[1:39:51] because human nature
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:32] even if the world calls you holy
[1:40:47] because the people can understand
[1:40:50] because the people can look at the
[1:40:52] situation
[1:40:56] it's not my notes
[1:40:58] but it's the leading of the spirit
[1:41:01] have no thought on what you shall say
[1:41:05] but at that time
[1:41:08] it shall be given to you
[1:41:10] the vision was not given to peter from
[1:41:12] the beginning of his ministry
[1:41:16] after
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:43] as he was struggling
[1:41:48] the people are there
[1:41:50] now people are here
[1:41:53] what are you going to do
[1:41:55] you're still struggling to continue i
[1:41:56] can't do it
[1:42:11] and you have to make yourself available
[1:42:17] it's willingly
[1:42:20] a wise woman enormous everything from
[1:42:24] sagittarius build up her own house gun
[1:42:26] street
[1:42:54] because
[1:42:58] you sanctifying yourself something to a
[1:43:01] man you'd come into church
[1:43:04] for the sake pull up yeah you can grow
[1:43:07] chipotle you're struggling
[1:43:22] my
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:44:02] [Applause]
[1:44:06] he went in
[1:44:08] and found many that would come together
[1:44:10] it was his year personal assembly when
[1:44:13] the people heard calmly purple your
[1:44:16] ministry is coming into town
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:46] somebody's
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:15] god is not looking for people and offer
[1:45:18] certain extravagant knowledge left and
[1:45:20] right
[1:45:22] regardless
[1:45:24] because he has even uh uh he hidden it
[1:45:28] to the wise and
[1:45:42] because that music is so great music
[1:45:44] yes we it is your ministry
[1:45:47] that is attracting people
[1:45:51] it is your way of dressing
[1:45:53] up
[1:45:54] that attracts somebody to come to church
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:46:08] [Applause]
[1:47:06] he said that it's not
[1:47:25] and he said unto them
[1:47:27] you know that it is an awful thing for a
[1:47:30] man that is due to keep company
[1:47:34] shows
[1:47:46] but god have showed me that i should not
[1:47:49] call
[1:47:50] any man come on or
[1:47:53] unclean
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:48:00] he understood the position it was
[1:48:15] it's not just ministers on the public
[1:48:29] that you cannot be with the
[1:48:31] get you in the paper
[1:48:32] that you cannot do with this
[1:48:35] you cannot hold the hang of this yeah
[1:48:39] but god says
[1:48:41] go to them
[1:48:45] these people say pepper 11 11 bread the
[1:48:48] person liver 11 bread the perfect
[1:48:51] deliver
[1:48:52] just as they are come me sir go to them
[1:48:56] but the lord showed me melissa mama
[1:48:58] montre
[1:49:11] you shall not you shall call that a holy
[1:49:14] convocation
[1:49:17] convocation
[1:49:19] this is from the old testament
[1:49:23] all the way the new testament jesus
[1:49:25] christ
[1:49:26] god
[1:49:47] you want people to behave in a certain
[1:49:49] manner
[1:49:52] no it's not your program that you're
[1:49:53] unfolding
[1:50:22] has influenced you who's influenced but
[1:50:25] you don't know it may vulnerable
[1:50:29] here sure told you that the people have
[1:50:31] to dress this year people have to be
[1:50:33] there
[1:50:35] people have to to do this
[1:50:38] but the bible says
[1:50:40] god told me germany
[1:50:43] not to call them unclean they need a man
[1:50:46] peter didn't come with us a resolution
[1:50:48] of himself
[1:50:54] because if i just said that you know
[1:50:55] just call people holy holy holy it would
[1:50:57] have been a different story
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:05] but we looked at it from the old
[1:51:06] testament
[1:51:09] new testament
[1:51:11] the message
[1:51:13] and now it is your responsibility about
[1:51:15] responsibility to know how to behave
[1:51:18] commercial
[1:51:29] despite all my father is doing it
[1:51:41] [Applause]
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:52:00] requires
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:25] god didn't say honor thy father when
[1:52:27] your father is preaching the word no
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:54] you might have all the knowledge in the
[1:52:55] world
[1:53:04] and when you look at your father look at
[1:53:06] him as holy hey
[1:53:09] you understand that principle
[1:53:13] you'll be at ease with everybody else
[1:53:17] because you look at your father at home
[1:53:21] you'll look at your brother as holy god
[1:53:37] it shall be holy unto the priesthood
[1:54:24] but then if you're able to respect your
[1:54:26] father that means you de respective
[1:54:27] opera are you able to honor your mother
[1:54:32] how much more the children of god
[1:54:39] because this for these people baskets a
[1:54:41] purple jesus died for them jesus
[1:54:45] it's not the action that sanctifies them
[1:55:15] lord i pray for them spiritual people so
[1:55:18] that they can be and leave them in the
[1:55:20] world first persecution in less than a
[1:55:22] month but they are not of the world
[1:55:25] therefore
[1:55:27] 29 they are never therefore came my unto
[1:55:30] you
[1:55:45] difficulty as soon as i was sent for i
[1:55:49] asked therefore for what intent you have
[1:55:51] sent for me
[1:55:57] and connolly said economy
[1:56:12] a man stood before me in bright clothing
[1:56:17] and and said
[1:56:19] and said cornelius
[1:56:21] that prayer is heard
[1:56:23] and thy arms are head in remembrance in
[1:56:40] the house of a simon eternal by the sea
[1:56:43] side
[1:56:48] when when he cometh
[1:56:50] he shall speak unto thee
[1:56:53] immediately therefore i sent to thee
[1:57:04] therefore are we all present before god
[1:57:26] to hear all things that are commended
[1:57:30] thee of god
[1:57:33] donated you
[1:57:35] in that simplicity god said simplicity
[1:57:38] god is doing the words
[1:57:42] for many times we will be we are
[1:57:43] expecting some great things and left and
[1:57:46] right
[1:57:49] the grand
[1:58:17] he said a little bit here
[1:58:59] it might not make sense as a big
[1:59:01] preaching
[1:59:03] songs
[1:59:05] but through that
[1:59:07] traversal the lord is making the work
[1:59:10] available
[1:59:12] then peter open his mouth
[1:59:30] god has no respect of person
[1:59:32] accepting the person he wants you the
[1:59:34] preacher to be there
[1:59:37] he wants you also to be there
[1:59:40] i was struggling left and right
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:25] and work of righteousness
[2:00:27] is accepted with him
[2:00:31] the word which god has sent unto the
[2:00:34] children of israel preaching peace by
[2:00:36] jesus christ he is lord
[2:00:52] that's why
[2:00:53] with jesus
[2:00:56] a man without sin i know i'm someplace
[2:00:59] but with us
[2:01:00] no we've seen
[2:01:02] the bishop god is looking at us holy
[2:01:05] general regarding the son
[2:01:12] which was published throughout all judea
[2:01:15] and begin from galilee after the baptism
[2:01:18] which john preached secretary
[2:01:34] which
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:02:00] unless if you are making yourself
[2:02:03] available to the world
[2:02:06] because god has called you by name
[2:02:11] god who wants you to make yourself
[2:02:12] available
[2:02:14] it requires humility
[2:02:41] without even being baptized
[2:02:56] [Applause]
[2:02:58] it's not our programs
[2:03:01] it's the lord's doing the love for jesus
[2:03:04] is god himself do him say do you
[2:03:07] remember confusion no brother nothing
[2:03:09] you have to come first
[2:03:11] we have to throw you in the water
[2:03:25] and the day of the circumcision which
[2:03:28] believe were astonished
[2:03:38] how can you receive the holy ghost
[2:03:40] without
[2:03:55] they have to they listen to all the
[2:03:57] sermons
[2:04:00] and they're looking at things
[2:04:02] they see the lord's doing
[2:04:04] yeah they were blown in their minds
[2:04:20] as a first fruits
[2:05:04] and what you're

[2:05:20] and she received the spirit deja vu
[2:05:23] yes we miss you the sermon didn't even
[2:05:26] finish
[2:05:28] but the channel of communication

[2:06:45] [Applause]
[2:07:09] expecting the holy ghost god is giving
[2:07:10] to

[2:07:51] why are we doing the things that we do
[2:07:54] on the shows
[2:07:55] why do we preach what we preach
[2:07:57] why all these ministers come and speak
[2:07:59] about all these things
[2:08:03] they were astonished
[2:08:06] as many as uh came with peter osie
[2:08:09] number uh
[2:08:11] verse 45 as many as
[2:08:14] came with peter because that all on on
[2:08:17] the gentiles also
[2:08:19] was pulled out of the gift
[2:08:39] because they could see exactly what had
[2:08:42] taken place in pentecost
[2:08:46] we waited so long
