thank you again for um tonight and we thank the Lord for the services myself I've been blessed I'm happy that God revealed to me these things and I pray that I practice it myself amen it's a good thing to preach okay but to practice it is another thing and sometimes it's good to preach to others yes but uh it's also myself to go and we support it meditate they meditate so that it becomes life second Chronicle chapter 29 The Chronic shape of an effort uh we're just going to take chapter verse 10 and 11. second Chronicle chapter 29 the colleague verse 11 actually 10 and 11. now it is mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel that his first Wrath may turn away from us be not be not now negligent for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that you should Minister unto him and burn incense we read second Peter chapter one verse 12 to 16 the verse says wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth is yeah I think it meet as long as I am in the Tabernacle to stir up to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my disease to have these things always in remembrance so we have not follow cunningly device Fable when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we are witness of his majestyles amen amen you may be seated take the comfort of your seat Well I remain standing yeah [Laughter] um it's almost seven uh say press cage is never uh we're speaking of decision and decision is uh something very important for us Believers we will know choir as we spoke about Samson and we spoke about Joseph Joseph and there is just so many examples in the Bible if you are a Bible reader yes and I hope that all that we have found in the word of God you can go and dig deeper deeper to understand because the Bible is not just a history of the Jews God wrote for us so it's not something that you read you remember it years and years and years but I just want to add a little bit of something in there what hinder a Christian to make a good decisions it's good to make decisions what hinders a Christian passionately you make decisions everything that we spoke about making the right decision but there is certain things in our lives there is quite a few but I'm just picking up one yeah and that thing or that element or item whatever you want to call it settlements it's called negligence negligence is one of the things when it comes into a Christian Life or in any human being it will cause you to make wrong decisions always full-time wrong decision more first decision once you become negligent and many times as Christians will become negligent without knowing that that Spirit already got you wrapped up hey but we see in chronicle here the king Hezekiah is telling his people and foreign [Music] [Music] don't forget the reason that God called you foreign this is the reason you are calling yourself the Bride of Jesus Christ it's given to you for a purpose I'm a husband I'm a teenager yesterday you are not just there for the sake of being there Avengers to feel the Earth no no no no no no no there is a purpose yeah and Peter God did not make you an insect Journey God did not make you a fly and for love he made known a fly whatever that is [Applause] [Music] [Music] they will chase them in somebody do you believe that is [Music] you serve him attitude of considering something not important that's not important you might not say it but your action will prove it's not important negligence develops carelessness it's a Developers carelessness someone just become careless I don't care what comes what goes that's not an attitude of a Christian a Christian is careful down and he cares about everything amen amen negligence comes from discouragement [Music] when someone is become negligence it's because they were discouraged about something and discouragement brings them to the state of negligence amen amen what causes discouragement I can follow this stuff way back from prayer but I don't have the time to go all the way discouragement is caused because by unfulfilled events in your life the pal effect shows I was trying this is said yeah as soon as you say that that's discouragement I don't feel like trying anymore I try everything nothing happened whatever comes comes this that discouraged once you get there negligence and whatever happens you don't care because I tried never worked and many times that's where many of us believe are in is founded to be one of the worst thing that can happen to a Christian when someone backslide it's when someone does not uh uh or start to fail in school discouragement something happened once you are discouraged you become negligent value for liver you can't read anymore but it does not mean anything then I don't like that why you don't like the teacher because you are discouraged amen amen negligence will develop laziness and laziness is someone who's not firm confident someone who's not settled and when you become a lazy you become irresponsible for definitely responsible towards the situation you start blaming others because of them you are a liar you made your own decisions stop blaming people stop being a child grow up God you say take on the responsibility man I carry the responsibilities amen that's a person that is not negligence negligence brings you to delinquency some foreign yes we that's Hollywood so I say Hollywood you would die take you to a hospital the prophet says the prophet as you are driving yeah you neglect to trim the corner you will you neglect to Milk The Cow everyone uh SEC you neglect your teeth fall down you will have them pulled out one of these days I hope you clean up your teeth every morning how many clean the teeth don't be shy the prophet talk about it yes foreign who are formal and backslidden one of these days foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] are worthy of asking in Liberty object the demand is worthy of Our Praise so don't become negligent well I pray it did not work that's discouragement don't be discouraged continue giving praise and as you give praise things will happen the shorts Miracle will take place and the best Miracles is the Salvation of your soul everything else will be added on top yeah we got many sad Christians they come to church with a long face you know in love fast well nothing works I don't like the musician Empire music I don't like the pasture I don't like that brother everything is negative Davido [Music] [Music] strengthen himself in the Lord remember listening there is time you need to stand up don't let your situation bring you down don't be negligence in the midst of your trials thank you Lord your protection thank you for your guidance as you are giving prayers [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] that's not a Christian how are you doing dude I'm not negligence once you become negligence you will affect everybody amen let's move on the Bible says in Acts uh let me jump this we we found here in the book of um uh Exodus something very important Exodus chapter 32. just to give you a background of what happened from Exodus 24 are part of the Exotic to Exodus 31. God Called Moses and he called the uh the the elders he called Aaron and abiu and 70 elders he says come up on the mountain and I will talk to you yesterday and Moses called all the elders and they went up the mountains and as they were going to take three people and the 70 elders but as they were going Allah Moses added Joshua um this is a very important I'm not going to go into that he I took Joshua with him that that means it was a little bit of trust there is God did not call Joshua God was clear but Moses also made a decision Joshua Joshua come with me because there were certain things that's potential only you should know okay and they went up they got to a certain place on the mountains Moses tells the elders and the three-year-old Aaron and Abby you another um I will go further and he grabbed Joshua both of them went up and if you read the story and that's when God started to talk to Moses about the Tabernacles because Moses was there for 40 years foreign so that Moses delayed they became impatient when you become impatient it's negligence when you become impatient that means god is about to do the job impatience came when God finished talking to Moses at 31st chapter and he was releasing Moses down there the people start another story they decided to do something different the Bible says because Moses delayed it's taking too long it's taking too long because it's taking too long the Bible says delayed to come down out of the mountain [Music] [Music] [Applause] as we spoke about choosing a past foreign they start to talk to Tacos young brothers who told you to marry them they did not know it was not Moses Choice it was God's choices foreign [Applause] [Music] did you eat foreign foreign [Music] he's not inspired more than me in a purpose no no I know God I'm older than him now he stand before the people also develop a different opinion of Moses don't you say that Moses took long yeah this young brother I don't know Emotions Don't you see don't you have some kind of an idea the Ruby ideas the prophet is dead and gone the prophet anybody to tell us otherwise still alive the prophet is still [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] and said unto him around the there is too many [Applause] which are in your ears or the ears of your wife is so also ready for family and your sons bring me your money because right now I'll replace Moses instead of thinking about Moses false Doctrine writing a message because he's gone the left foreign [Music] [Applause] and he said ages these be thy gods they said this so that means it was not one motion cast uh so he says this is this so there were many of them peace be thy Gods oh Israel oh Israel which brought thee are up out of the land of Egypt talk about Insanity come to that kind of a place that's the highest level of negligence that's the highest level of discussions the same God that he saw this way Iron went on the mountains he saw the clouds the experimental is great flesh 40 days he came to a place I think that he himself made the insurance can remember fabricate and call Israel this is your god may God have mercy on us today Among Us your adoption can become your gods and the Bible says and when Aaron saw it he lost everything he built an altar before it is and he says tomorrow is a feast unto the Lord and he was aware that he was backsliding yeah it was not foolish and he says and they are rose up early on tomorrow and also burnt offerings [Music] [Applause] [Music] running there [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] go down 32 number there is a problem yeah problem get thee down for your people which that brought us out of the land of Egypt have corrupt themselves they have turned aside quickly out of which I commended them he says they have made a molten curve he said some fair and vote defunter God was not calling names he says foreign [Music] [Applause] hey now therefore let me alone that my that I may Works hot against them that I can make consume them and I will make thee a great nation God is giving Moses a proposition you see what happened I'm going to kill them give you new people Moses did not like the idea no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you can't do that you can do that Moses became an intercessor he stood in the Gap I know they are wrong I know that was also a decision she was not negligence make him to believe that he was an intercessor just be sought to the Lord what's hard against thy people that collects when God was mad he says your people Moses also look at God he says no the people did not know where they belongs God wanted to destroy Moses people Jesus said don't destroy your people yes the Bible says they sat down to eat drink amen and to pray they were playing discussion going on on the mountains for them oh praise the Lord Moses was no negligence he says this is my job and Moses says he has brought them forth out of the land of Egypt but in their face yes the people say if you destroy them and remember Abraham Isaac and raped and I like something Moses said here verse 12. turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people a human being foreign [Music] unto the people Pharaoh people repented Moses please thank you very much for reminding me to repented if God can repent see Jefferson how about you how about you God repented I take my wrath maybe he said to himself
