[0:22] I stood on the banks on the wide raging
[0:28] River try
[0:31] I'd get
[0:34] across and I made my way through some
[0:39] valleys and deserts
[0:43] believing that I'd never get
[0:48] lost I've been at the foot of what feel
[0:53] like M
[0:54] Everest knowing i' have Str for the
[0:59] cloud
[1:02] but through every trial it's chest and
[1:07] Temptation one thing is sure every
[1:14] time over and
[1:17] over again and again God is
[1:24] faithful over and
[1:27] over again and again and through it
[1:32] all he's made me
[1:36] aable to stand and
[1:39] survive to come through aive when it
