[28:39] prayers because you have told
[28:41] us to pray for one
[28:44] another in order to pray for somebody
[28:49] else we need your
[28:52] leadership to pray for the right person

[29:02] need as we
[29:04] finish this series on
[29:09] revivals we have dedicated this prayer
[29:14] service to ask you one
[29:18] thing that the
[29:20] Revival that you have set on our
[29:25] hearts in our souls
[29:28] could never
[29:31] die and continue with each one of
[29:37] us until the
[29:40] Rapture bless this
[29:43] Gathering that we dedicate to
[29:47] you remembering all the requests that we
[29:51] have among
[29:55] us we get from request from Brother
[30:02] Junior for his daughter
[30:06] Monica and for the lady he transported
[30:11] in his
[30:15] [Music]
[30:17] car who is going to
[30:23] surgery for her
[30:25] kidney and also the blood in
[30:30] her
[30:35] heart we pray also
[30:39] Father for the Kupa and the malos
[30:46] family and for all of us who were
[30:49] acquainted with
[30:54] them during this time of
[30:58] big pain and
[31:02] trial that you bring
[31:07] Comfort your
[31:10] support and to remember those little
[31:15] children who will be growing without a
[31:20] mother to give
[31:23] peace and
[31:25] wisdom for the unity in the family
[31:34] they are not the only one who are
[31:36] mourning
[31:40] somewhere there may be many others
[31:45] also among the
[31:54] bright almighty God
[32:00] we need
[32:01] you and guide us and lead
[32:05] us during this prayer
[32:10] meeting we ask all of these
[32:13] things your
[32:15] leadership in Jesus Christ
[32:18] name amen
[32:22] amen may God bless
[32:25] you as uh we are Still
[32:30] Standing we are going to read just one
[32:33] scripture in first John chapter
[32:37] [Music]
[32:45] 5 verse
[32:48] 4 uh because I want to carry this
[32:51] thought
[32:55] tonight how to keep the Revival on all
[32:59] the
[33:03] time how to keep the Revival on all the
[33:09] times we read brother
[33:12] Bram he
[33:14] said according to the history of
[33:19] Revival it just
[33:21] take three
[33:24] years and it
[33:26] vanished but but our prayer
[33:29] tonight is to ask the almighty God to
[33:32] help
[33:34] us maybe the time ahead of
[33:40] us is not even three
[33:43] years we don't know but until the
[33:47] Rapture if that could be more than three
[33:51] years keep the
[33:54] Revival if it's going to be shorter than
[33:56] that
[33:58] keep the
[33:59] Revival because that the purpose God has
[34:02] sent the
[34:04] Revival and the only way to keep that
[34:08] Revival is by
[34:11] faith therefore the Bible
[34:13] said for whatsoever is born of God
[34:18] overcometh the world and this is the
[34:22] victory that overcometh the world even
[34:25] our faith
[34:32] amen amen may the Lord bless the reading
[34:35] of the scripture you may be
[34:40] seated
[34:49] yeah in order to maintain the
[34:55] victory it takes faith
[34:59] not the faith of another
[35:01] person but your own
[35:04] faith and brother said faith is a
[35:09] revelation if you have the
[35:12] Revelation that this end time
[35:16] Revival is not for
[35:19] everyone it's particularly for the
[35:23] bride and if you have the
[35:26] Revelation that you are that
[35:29] bride then this is the prayer
[35:35] request Lord not only me my wife my
[35:41] children my husband my church
[35:45] everyone let us keep this revival
[35:51] up we don't
[35:53] know what tomorrow is reserving
[36:00] are you really
[36:02] ready you may go to
[36:05] bed for the last
[36:07] time sleeping in your
[36:10] house without even
[36:13] knowing without even being
[36:16] sick without even being diagnosed with
[36:21] sickness once that
[36:24] happen where are you going to be
[36:27] all the
[36:29] sermons all the
[36:32] messages will be in front of
[36:35] you your own life will stand before
[36:41] you and you will be
[36:44] going and looking at your
[36:47] body where are you
[36:50] going is it from Darkness to Darkness to
[36:55] Darkness to Darkness
[37:00] or from light to light and
[37:03] light at that point there is no way
[37:10] back oh I've
[37:13] left1
[37:15] million
[37:17] somewhere where nobody
[37:20] knows Lord if you can help me going
[37:23] going back to tell them where it is
[37:30] so that that money can serve
[37:34] somebody nobody can do
[37:37] that it's
[37:39] done the only time you can do
[37:44] everything it's
[37:46] today when you have such prayer
[37:50] meeting
[37:52] pray I
[37:54] remember testimony from uh
[37:58] Rebecca uh
[38:02] Bram Rebecca Smitha
[38:07] Smith she stayed in
[38:12] tuon when brother bam had that accident
[38:15] in
[38:18] Maro because she was dating brother
[38:20] George
[38:30] dating yeah they stayed
[38:33] there and the rest of the family was
[38:36] traveling back to
[38:40] Jeffersonville and the accident
[38:44] happened brother Bram was in a different
[38:47] car than Billy
[38:50] Paul and when Billy Paul saw the
[38:55] crash Sarah was in the
[38:59] Joseph was in the
[39:01] car was in the
[39:04] car was in the car the only person in
[39:08] the family left out was
[39:13] Rebecca and Brother Joseph was only 10
[39:17] years and Billy Paul was a mature
[39:22] person at that time they not have cell
[39:25] phones
[39:27] he went and find some place to make the
[39:32] call and he called
[39:34] Rebecca said dear
[39:37] sister Daddy and the rest of the family
[39:41] are in a critical
[39:47] condition pray like you never prayed
[39:54] before she used to publish a lot of Mega
[39:57] magazine called only
[40:01] believe that was Sister Rebecca and
[40:03] brother they have to write a lot of
[40:09] stories that's what she
[40:12] said but when I read that only believe
[40:18] magazine that little
[40:21] sentence caught my
[40:24] attention saying you can also so
[40:28] pray like you never prayed
[40:31] before and let that be
[40:35] tonight as we have this prayer
[40:39] meeting brother Bram said in the message
[40:43] diseases and
[40:49] afflictions paragraph
[40:52] 26 someone
[40:55] said does the healings
[41:04] last they last as long as Faith
[41:12] lasts and we can apply it tonight to the
[41:17] revival can the Revival that started in
[41:24] you can it last
[41:29] yes as long as Faith
[41:34] lasts but when Faith
[41:38] fails then your Revival will also
[41:44] fail so all depends on our
[41:50] faith if God has sent those seven
[41:52] tunders to revive
[41:56] us and we are
[41:59] awake so the only
[42:01] way is to keep it
[42:04] up how to keep it
[42:08] up
[42:09] faith faith in
[42:12] what in the word of
[42:14] God to read the word of
[42:18] God and
[42:20] pray said two things will make you
[42:25] prosper spiritually
[42:28] read the
[42:29] word and pray as a Christian if you
[42:34] don't feel like reading the word of God
[42:37] or listening to the
[42:41] word or to pray you are in
[42:46] trouble that Revival is certainly going
[42:49] to
[42:54] die I don't want to take much time to
[42:59] speak but I want really to give some
[43:02] time maybe more than 30 minutes for us
[43:05] to
[43:08] pray so the thing that will keep the
[43:12] Revival is your
[43:15] faith and brother calls
[43:18] Faith the good man of the
[43:22] house the good man of the
[43:25] house if you have a good man standing in
[43:28] the door at the door of your
[43:32] house you are
[43:35] guaranteed no evil will get
[43:38] in in the message show us the father and
[43:42] its
[43:46] suffices parag
[43:50] 56 said remember I have warned every one
[43:56] of you
[43:58] within 72
[44:01] hours what will take
[44:04] place the Bible said when the unclean
[44:08] spirit is gone out of a
[44:13] man he walks in dry
[44:17] places then returns
[44:21] again is that
[44:23] right with seven other Devils work
[44:27] than he
[44:30] was be
[44:33] careful let the good man of the house be
[44:36] standing there with faith woring him
[44:44] away telling him he can't
[44:49] come amen amen if you are prayed
[44:54] up or you believe God is set you free
[44:57] from
[45:00] something have always the
[45:03] faith when that person will that disease
[45:06] or that bad Spirit want to get
[45:12] back to cool you off
[45:16] again oh no the Revival is already
[45:20] passed keep the good man of the house at
[45:23] the
[45:25] door he will will stand there he will
[45:29] refuse to see
[45:31] it he refuse to have
[45:34] it or anything
[45:37] else stay right with
[45:40] it amen amen in the message the second
[45:46] Miracle paragraph
[45:51] 71 brother said now what we are trying
[45:56] to get that is more strength in the good
[46:00] man of your
[46:05] house which is Faith is that right now
[46:11] if you can look at here now see that by
[46:18] Revelation because everything Faith is a
[46:24] revelation that's what we find in the
[46:26] Bible in the the book of Hebrews
[46:31] 11 by faith Enoch in other words it
[46:37] means by
[46:39] Revelation by
[46:42] faith Abraham Abraham by faith Joseph
[46:46] Joseph by Faith by Faith by faith means
[46:51] simply by Revelation and if you look at
[46:55] Hebrews 11
[46:58] they have mentioned so many
[47:02] names I want
[47:05] tonight you to add your
[47:10] name to say by
[47:16] [Music]
[47:19] faith kept
[47:23] Revival don't let that uh heavy Spirit
[47:27] come back upon
[47:31] you
[47:34] heavy when you feel like I can do this
[47:40] too but heaviness
[47:44] come to the extent are you following me
[47:49] that heaviness
[47:51] spirit will come and when you are about
[47:55] to do what you are called to
[47:59] do the heaviness
[48:02] spirit will tell you you will do it
[48:06] tomorrow you get tomorrow you will do it
[48:09] again
[48:10] tomorrow that a spirit of post
[48:15] things but today is
[48:20] today
[48:21] Revival today and
[48:25] forever we need to keep pressing
[48:31] on we need to regardless you know when
[48:35] you are you have a
[48:37] target an
[48:38] objective you want to achieve
[48:41] it let me tell you brother it's not
[48:45] always
[48:46] easy every time you set up a
[48:50] goal the enemy
[48:53] watches the enemy will come as
[49:01] ambition and if you look at the
[49:05] obstacles you will never reach the
[49:09] goal you will all the time be stopped by
[49:13] the
[49:16] obstacles that's the reason why God send
[49:20] a
[49:20] Revival to give us some
[49:24] power because Revival itself
[49:28] it's the action of God in
[49:31] power to continue to press
[49:35] on remember uh
[49:38] Moses with the children of
[49:41] Israel they were corn
[49:45] somewhere in front there was the Red
[49:48] Sea Mountain and
[49:51] mountain and no way to go
[49:54] back because the army of pharaoh was
[49:59] coming now what to
[50:01] do there was a dead
[50:04] end it's like you are driving into a
[50:08] city you don't know you come somewhere
[50:13] you did not see the
[50:14] sign where they put it a dead
[50:19] end you getting in front of you house
[50:23] house house house maybe in
[50:31] you have to go
[50:33] back but with the children of Israel
[50:37] there was no way to go
[50:39] back this is the lesson God is giving to
[50:44] us don't go
[50:46] back don't give up brother sister the
[50:51] distance we have walked
[50:56] is not worthy to go
[51:00] back if we cannot go
[51:03] back we cannot turn to the left or to
[51:06] the
[51:07] right the only thing is keep pressing
[51:12] on remember the vision for the
[51:16] translation where brother was on the
[51:18] sixth
[51:20] Dimension what else to do he heard the
[51:23] voice keep pressing keep pressing
[51:27] keep pring and that's what the Revival
[51:30] has to
[51:31] do and our prayer
[51:34] tonight God set a pressing on spirit in
[51:42] me and among us there is no way back
[51:47] there was a little
[51:49] quote I did not feel like preaching
[51:53] [Music]
[51:55] really in the message speak to the Rock
[51:58] and it shall give forth his
[52:03] water somewhere in the paragraph
[52:08] 28 said that's the way people does
[52:13] today when fear strikes them when they
[52:16] are right in the path of
[52:22] Duty brother the
[52:24] Revival put you in your way of
[52:30] Duty to cast out every
[52:34] demon to refuse any kind of
[52:39] sickness to walk on the serpent and
[52:43] scorpions to possess every
[52:47] territory and without fear and said
[52:52] listen brother let me say this if you
[52:57] are walking in the
[52:59] light having fellowship with
[53:02] god with his people and the Holy Spirit
[53:06] is upon
[53:08] you and you meet an obstacle right in
[53:11] the path of
[53:14] Duty just go
[53:19] back amen amen said you are in the line
[53:24] of duty
[53:27] amen don't
[53:30] stop just keep pressing
[53:34] on but I'm going to continue to press on
[53:37] until
[53:38] where I don't know the only thing I know
[53:43] you just continue to
[53:44] press if you hit the
[53:49] Walling that means Satan come with
[53:54] obstacles don't pay attention
[53:56] keep pressing just keep
[53:59] pressing listen to just keep pressing
[54:03] on God Will Make A Way through
[54:09] it it's not
[54:11] you it's not you the only thing God is
[54:15] asking
[54:16] you with your prayer keep pressing
[54:21] on the doctor said keep pressing on B
[54:27] said keep
[54:28] pressing the enemy come keep
[54:32] pressing until where until God will be
[54:39] forced to make a way listen
[54:44] to that's one of the greatest
[54:47] experiences of my
[54:51] life is to see
[54:54] God if you to
[54:57] PR brother you are going to see
[55:02] God because humanly speaking you have
[55:07] reached the
[55:08] wall and the only person who can make a
[55:12] way is God in which way I don't know but
[55:18] one way or another he will make a way
[55:22] and when he make a way hallelujah it's
[55:25] always in amazing
[55:27] way amazing way will allow you to see
[55:33] God with your eyes hallelujah hallelujah
[55:37] the oldest man in the
[55:40] Bible you know his story he went through
[55:43] a lot of
[55:45] Tri through a lot of
[55:47] Tri he lost his
[55:50] wife
[55:53] children he lost his
[55:57] to the end he was almost
[56:00] dying and his wife said just that
[56:04] God and died he said no there is no way
[56:09] with that God there is no
[56:12] limitation continue
[56:14] to these three
[56:16] friends came to comfort him the
[56:20] condition they see him
[56:24] under the people who came to
[56:27] Comfort they stay speechless for seven
[56:32] days I call it the mystery of the seven
[56:37] Ser seven
[56:39] days they could not say a word but if
[56:43] you look brother you came to comfort
[56:45] your
[56:46] brother look at the condition sometimes
[56:50] if you go through a lot of
[56:52] experience the people coming to
[56:55] comt you will be comforting
[56:58] them and the only way you can reach that
[57:03] position is when you keep up the
[57:06] Revival you will be a
[57:08] testimony you will see God and then the
[57:11] Bible
[57:13] says at the end I think chapter
[57:17] 42 The Book of Job 42
[57:21] chapter God restor
[57:24] everything Resto
[57:26] everything you know the statement of
[57:29] job I have
[57:32] heard I see that means who
[57:38] trials dead
[57:40] end that's the only way you can see
[57:45] God and let during this
[57:48] prayer if in there is someone here who
[57:52] have reached a dead
[57:54] end let the door be
[57:57] open so that you can see
[58:00] God when I can't go over
[58:06] it let me show you if I cannot get over
[58:13] it get under
[58:16] it if you cannot get under
[58:20] it around
[58:22] it or
[58:25] anyway God opens up a
[58:28] way and I go through
[58:32] it
[58:34] somehow
[58:35] another his grace is
[58:39] sufficient to carry us
[58:43] through amen amen oh brother I don't
[58:47] feel like talking
[58:49] really I just want to invite you to do
[58:53] that
[58:54] experience say to tonight Lord you have
[58:58] prepared us through the Revival
[59:02] series to break
[59:06] through in which way I don't know maybe
[59:12] brother you are struggling
[59:14] tonight maybe sister you can be
[59:19] struggling with your
[59:21] finances you cannot be
[59:24] stable you get the money
[59:26] you work a lot you make money at the end
[59:31] you don't see tonight God can open a
[59:35] way so that you can have
[59:38] some if you have
[59:41] sickness that the doctor said you know
[59:43] this kind of
[59:44] sickness you have only to live under
[59:50] medication but let me tell you he is
[59:53] still the Jehovah
[59:56] he can change a
[59:58] situation brotherless of the condition
[1:00:02] regardless of the
[1:00:03] circumstance regardless of whatever it
[1:00:06] is he remains
[1:00:09] God give me some I think P
[1:00:13] 42 the Bible
[1:00:19] say Psalm 42 I believe
[1:00:46] no I mean 46
[1:00:48] rather
[1:00:50] 46 from the beginning
[1:00:56] God is our
[1:00:59] refuge and
[1:01:02] strength a very present
[1:01:06] help in trouble and brother call
[1:01:10] him based on
[1:01:13] this is Jehovah
[1:01:16] sh in this time of big trouble
[1:01:21] you and you have come through the series
[1:01:24] of Revival
[1:01:28] let him be
[1:01:30] seen by your
[1:01:32] eyes as
[1:01:34] Jehovah as
[1:01:37] Jehovah Jehovah sh sh Jehovah shalomov
[1:01:40] Shalom all those
[1:01:43] attributes he is for you let us stand on
[1:01:46] our
[1:01:49] feet yeah I don't want to continue with
[1:01:52] the rest of the court maybe later on
[1:01:57] I will just
[1:01:59] ask maybe very very soft music maybe one
[1:02:03] person
[1:02:06] playing uh very very
[1:02:11] soft and to prepare our
[1:02:15] souls to enter into his
[1:02:20] presence
[1:02:22] prayer is the strongest weapon
[1:02:28] and we have it in our hands
[1:02:31] tonight don't be
[1:02:34] distracted young people or
[1:02:37] others I I don't think during prayer ask

[1:02:49] out and if it happen some emergency that
