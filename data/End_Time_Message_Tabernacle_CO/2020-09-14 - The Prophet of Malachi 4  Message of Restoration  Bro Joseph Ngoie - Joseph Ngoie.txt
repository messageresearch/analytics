in to ask johnny the prophet in the question are you with me john john chapter 1 they asked john listen to the question and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who are who are those saved you know the bible is very precise on demand yeah they're asking john who are you why we shouldn't put that question you and i if they ask the same question i'll say i'm sure i live in denver with everything that you are doing show us where are they in the bible everything that you've got to do that you have done where are you in the bible and listen my friends john dc and john says the seventh in the twenties and he confessed and deny not by but confess i'm not the christ hey you read the mandate and they ask him quad donk what then he ali other elijah eddie he said jealousy point i'm not a child prophet is a mystery name detail he said i am jesus what they say i am the voice of the one crying in the wilderness amen amen i will i'm reading uh do we read the name of john the baptist in isaiah 43. jensen passively are you with me situated john has shown himself in the world divorce of the ones crying in the world preparing is do

the lord is upon me man where because yes i know about new zealand to announce and the the good news to heal the sick amen amen and in a certain point john the one who presents jesus confusion he was confused that mighty owns the good news is uh pronounced to everybody say too that's all gone for this session when we got selfish no he said go tell him there is a scripture that is being fulfilled what the scripture is talking about now when john heard when john had heard in prison the work of christ he sent two of his disciples 8 and not and and said unto him i'll doubt he although he that should come or do we look for another jesus jesus answered and jesus answered and said unto them go and show and show john again those things which ye do hear and see levoir the gospel preached to them are you the one or we have to wait for another one about the same one jesus didn't say it's me it's not me what you have and the gospel is preached this is the way of god to identify himself second psychiatry it is the way he writes no nonsense our names as mysteries amen amen y'all now today said grand promise daily god has given unto us this big promise of elijah now these many people say i i agree a little bit later but jesus gave us a precision here that might be the same matthew's chapter 17. revision we know all these things we are just you know revising i said descent matthew 17 versus this set this turn they said this matthew 17 the verse 10 the disciples said question and the disciple asked him this question asking to jesus let's keep this till and saying why them say the script described that a lie must first come equity listen jesus commander upon jesus the word jesus and jesus answered unto them [Music] then the disciple understood that he speak unto them of john the baptist electrically it's true that elijah has to come amen amen and if you read the difference john was supposed to prepare the way for the lord of management before the judgment's day john

marriage is a testimony yeah in petite manifestation there is a small uh manipulation young people will come here with that and then they disappear just go pray again i'm just going to say that i'm telling you the truth there's a richness in fact look for a woman he didn't marry the woman the girls that were dancing no look at my dress and stuff they were looking for a corrupter he saw one

serious did you pray it might be just a joke but this is my request for today may god bless you sometimes you can see amen you have to take it to the right he didn't go down to verse five and six of malachi [Music] [Music] maybe it was the need of somebody you have to believe the prophet we have so many sermons if we can spend more time listening to those but knowing that this is a question of life or death message never neglect anything from what the prophet said jeremiah shows the secular prophet they think that is different from us the gentiles and the jews the kingdom deferred they choose they know the value of a word coming off the map when a prophet said call it prophet d you know they even come to the point to say jesus who are you here is you see killed you see we need moses but they forgot my zombie he was the god of moses amen but how many things we have heard from the message to the extent today they tell you we don't pay attention they show you brother said [Music] those abc's say are they saying of the message to message amen with things like altar call havoc hotel coming on time to the altar then a hotel where are those things all sorts of shows [Music] god remains god he arrested you amen and that will bring this success in our families he spoke about the relationship between husband and wife but in the spiritual way also it's applicable spirituality relationship between christ and the church relationship between the pastor and the church sometimes the church can write five pages against the pastor [Music] [Music] davos uh my prayer is god to
