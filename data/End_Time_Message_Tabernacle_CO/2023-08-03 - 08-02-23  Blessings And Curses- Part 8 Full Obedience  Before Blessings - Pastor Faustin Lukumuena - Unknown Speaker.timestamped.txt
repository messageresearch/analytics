[31:55] foreign
[31:56] [Music]
[32:05] [Music]
[32:58] is
[33:01] [Music]
[33:16] today she's calling
[33:20] ladder and falling
[33:23] return of these words
[33:27] [Music]
[33:43] this is
[33:45] [Music]
[34:09] father
[34:12] we know that the day of redemption is
[34:15] getting closer
[34:25] employment to change
[34:28] I think
[34:29] political world the most politics
[34:34] care was in religion
[34:37] chaos in religion
[34:40] and all these things that are taking
[34:42] place
[34:46] it's telling us father they're going
[34:48] home is ready we
[34:54] are
[34:57] the University
[34:57] foreign
[35:27] and we want to order
[35:30] bless us once again tonight
[35:34] our understanding
[35:40] that what all those blessings
[35:43] addiction becomes subject of our prayers
[35:47] go
[35:51] go all those places
[35:59] and The Interpreter as well
[36:02] come and speak to us
[36:06] in Jesus Christ
[36:13] maybe student
[36:15] foreign
[37:01] it's very complicated it's a very
[37:04] complicated
[37:07] it's a very long reading such in a 10
[37:11] long literature
[37:13] 28 68 verses uh Society versa
[37:21] now you want me to read it in the church
[37:26] it's not possible
[37:29] so if you want really to be part of this
[37:34] civilian foreign because
[37:45] uh the way I look at this
[37:49] when I read it
[37:52] I stop in my head and I claim it
[37:57] and the more you do it
[37:59] the more this becomes
[38:02] here in reality you start learning
[38:05] everything
[38:06] for certain type of blessings
[38:11] but if you don't read
[38:14] you are not going to be blessed be
[38:17] because even as a member
[38:22] The Book of Revelation delivered
[38:25] apocalypse they said that those who are
[38:29] going to read this this
[38:32] is
[38:35] so how you will receive the blessing if
[38:38] you don't read it
[38:42] there is no way
[38:44] you will just
[38:59] anyway we left last Sunday okay
[39:05] talking about
[39:07] um
[39:09] generously
[39:14] and that's the thing we need to get rid
[39:17] of before we see the blessing falling
[39:19] upon us
[39:26] this I'm gonna insist on this even
[39:29] bothering system because I want each one
[39:33] of us to receive blessings
[39:37] you cannot receive a blessings with a
[39:40] bad heart
[39:43] no no Envy is not from God
[39:47] jealousy is not from God
[39:50] because I think I did not read it last
[39:54] Sunday question and answer on Hebrews
[39:57] part one
[39:58] question is
[40:06] asking foreign
[40:09] [Music]
[40:14] satisfree
[40:19] dailym
[40:23] [Music]
[40:25] OT was the son of Adam
[40:28] which was a Son of God where did that
[40:32] evil come from do
[40:52] he was a murderer he was jealous
[40:58] and now that the nature of his dad
[41:04] they're very smart in the beginning
[41:13] and he was
[41:15] in the beginning he was jealous of
[41:17] Michael okay
[41:25] and the King was the nature of his
[41:28] father
[41:30] which he was jealous
[41:38] [Music]
[41:50] [Music]
[41:59] those blessings become
[42:02] foreign
[42:25] [Music]
[42:35] also we spoke in the message Christ is
[42:40] the mystery of God to revealed the
[42:42] message
[42:44] I'm just reading a part of 86.
[42:52] you think he's a little bit wrong or
[42:54] it's the sister to pass
[42:58] don't let uh say Lord
[43:02] say Lord
[43:05] don't let me never have the root of
[43:08] bitterness
[43:16] start to think that just is a reality
[43:22] if
[43:23] your brother has something or your
[43:26] sister you see what Affairs
[43:29] and you are not fully happy
[43:33] and you feel like something is bothering
[43:36] you something you get the shows no
[43:39] that's that's that thing sashek is a
[43:41] sexual love
[43:42] foreign
[43:52] [Music]
[44:01] [Music]
[44:20] [Music]
[44:36] he was saying
[44:40] he was saying a little a little thing
[44:43] that doesn't have a name
[44:45] that is
[44:49] something okay shows the fatigue you can
[44:52] smell something get the shows ah it
[44:55] doesn't have a name
[44:57] if you have it you cannot
[45:00] Progressive you cannot win
[45:03] but when I come to the word of God I say
[45:07] that to think
[45:08] as a name I know
[45:11] friend
[45:17] just Rejoice for your brother and your
[45:20] sister
[45:23] if you cannot fully rejoice
[45:27] examine that thing
[45:30] and get rid of
[45:33] the blessings will be coming your way
[45:40] so this thing is a little bit uh recap
[45:44] of what we went through uh
[45:48] now we are going to
[45:50] move a little bit to the book of
[45:52] Deuteronomy
[45:55] I told you to read Deuteronomy chapter
[45:59] 28.
[46:03] uh four verses 1 to
[46:07] 68.50 on Twitter so let us stand as we
[46:11] read it
[46:15] economy 28.
[46:22] I'm just going to read the first two
[46:26] verses
[46:29] is the goodness
[46:31] of playing the music
[46:34] [Applause]
[46:39] the more you practice
[46:41] the more you become experts
[46:46] you know even Julia and Sheriff
[46:51] I saw them they did not know anything is
[46:57] uh when we started Gathering
[47:02] no music instrument you have a bad
[47:05] instrumental music we have to play
[47:08] there was a brother
[47:11] who came with the bank
[47:15] and that was it yeah
[47:17] and then you know you have to have
[47:20] always a vision
[47:24] I took them to a piano
[47:27] schools
[47:31] Sharon they started learning
[47:34] practices practical learning engine
[47:37] practice
[47:48] something never went to school for
[47:50] anything
[47:53] from the sister he learned the piano
[47:58] she moved to the drum
[48:01] he is the best
[48:03] of one of them
[48:10] and the Joe I don't even know when he
[48:12] started playing the keyboard George
[48:14] entertainment
[48:16] piano I believe hope also the policy up
[48:20] the only people they send the person who
[48:23] did not learn anything
[48:25] it's me and my wife
[48:29] but this need to say Japan
[48:31] when you are a young girl
[48:34] you have more attitude to learn because
[48:39] because you don't have a lot of things
[48:41] in your mind
[48:44] and that's why I said try to get the
[48:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost when you are
[48:49] still younger you see here they are
[48:51] worried about ten percentage
[48:53] when you become older
[48:56] we've married a problem
[49:02] the time become very very limited
[49:08] become religious
[49:10] so let us go to Deuteronomy 28 1.
[49:15] I'm gonna read the first two verses
[49:20] the first two verses
[49:24] and then I will take also verse 15.
[49:29] pay attention to this uh
[49:33] but you will notice before
[49:37] the Bible is that mentioning the bless
[49:40] the kind of blessings
[49:46] he gave a poor requisite recommendation
[49:53] this is the conditions to get the
[49:56] Blessed vaccines
[49:58] the Bible says and it shall come to pass
[50:03] if Thou shalt how can diligently unto
[50:07] the voice of the Lord thy God
[50:09] to observe and to do all his
[50:13] Commandments which I commend thee this
[50:16] day that the Lord thy God will set thee
[50:21] on high above all nations of the earth
[50:26] yes
[50:38] I like the French words
[50:45] and all these blessings shall come on
[50:50] thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt how
[50:54] can unto the voice of the Lord thy guide
[51:05] so this thing to say is
[51:10] over myself ascended but before you get
[51:14] to the blessings
[51:18] obey to the voice
[51:22] of thy Lord
[51:27] Now we move to Deuteronomy 28 to 15.
[51:33] but it shall come to pass if the will
[51:37] not how can unto the voice of the Lord
[51:41] thy God to observe to do all his come
[51:45] treatments and his statutes which I
[51:49] commend thee this day that all these
[51:53] curses shall come upon thee and overtake
[51:56] thee messages
[52:12] foreign
[52:32] [Music]
[52:44] this is the choice
[52:48] blessings
[52:49] and curses are a choice
[52:53] something short
[52:55] all these things are mentioned in the
[52:58] book
[53:01] Siri
[53:21] [Music]
[53:29] [Music]
[53:43] [Music]
[53:57] [Music]
[54:06] [Music]
[54:10] and the choice is given in the word of
[54:13] God
[54:14] don't you just say thank you I was
[54:18] thinking about this
[54:20] write the big word Hawkins
[54:24] is there anymore
[54:28] [Music]
[54:32] e a
[54:35] h
[54:37] okay
[54:39] e
[54:40] n
[54:42] and turn it to the people
[54:47] we see the book is saying if
[54:50] Thou Art because
[54:55] yes in fact they said
[55:01] but in English
[55:03] they say if the how can you see
[55:07] you'll be
[55:09] there is no kind of marker anymore give
[55:13] me the
[55:14] head
[55:18] the blackened
[55:23] yeah if you're Hawken I see to your baby
[55:26] if I cut it like this
[55:28] is
[55:34] here is
[55:36] a executive yeah
[55:39] in other words
[55:43] if you hear
[55:47] your blessing is coming from
[55:51] listening
[55:54] amen yes yes yes
[55:57] what you hear is what is going to
[56:01] determine
[56:02] blessings or curses
[56:14] [Music]
[56:28] this is in reality then you can obey all
[56:33] disobeyed
[56:38] Mexican
[56:43] I put there uh how can ease to listen
[56:50] there are many definitions
[56:53] and uh tonight this is why I'm gonna
[56:56] take as a subject
[56:59] full obedience before blessing
[57:09] I wanted to talk about the promised
[57:11] blessings
[57:12] I wanted to talk
[57:19] means but I look closely in the Bible
[57:27] before even talking about the blessing
[57:30] they are outlined in the Deuteronomy
[57:33] the the most related
[57:36] there was this condition he Advanced the
[57:40] condition if you hearkened so they say
[57:44] and then I start breaking down the word
[57:46] I look in the I did not put all the
[57:49] description but they said how can is to
[57:52] give here to uh
[57:55] on the years
[58:12] [Music]
[58:24] [Music]
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:28] make sense
[58:30] amen that's what they say to hear to how
[58:33] can is to be
[58:36] obedients
[58:44] on the knock at the door comes to listen
[58:47] who is it uh who it is
[58:52] [Music]
[59:02] Egypt
[59:08] so I think this word is very very
[59:11] important what is important let's go
[59:15] back to Deuteronomy chapter 28 verse
[59:20] so I'm just gonna stay a little bit on
[59:24] this word
[59:25] about obedience
[59:29] because
[59:32] the real blessings
[59:35] oh what is gonna determine the curse
[59:40] is the best on obedience
[59:47] now
[59:50] and it shall come to pass
[59:53] if thou shall how can diligently
[59:57] amen since
[1:00:01] nobody follow me please if Thou shalt
[1:00:04] Hawken diligently
[1:00:07] um
[1:00:12] if Thou shalt hearken diligently Seafood
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:23] do they add to the voice of the Lord
[1:00:28] so the voice of the Lord
[1:00:31] is speaking to everyone's heart
[1:00:38] we have the written words
[1:00:41] man this will keep it this word
[1:00:45] is written into our hearts
[1:00:48] and every time you have to act foreign
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:43] that's right are you with me
[1:01:46] I told you this is a change on the scary
[1:01:49] blessings and curses
[1:01:54] we have to break it in the business
[1:01:59] in order to follow then the remaining
[1:02:03] will be easy
[1:02:08] the Earth investigations it will stay in
[1:02:11] one year if
[1:02:14] you do this and centrifice you give to
[1:02:16] faces this is the blessing this is
[1:02:21] wonderful but the conditions
[1:02:31] to make your choice
[1:02:33] are you gonna Hawken foreign
[1:02:41] [Music]
[1:03:02] that the Lord God the Lord thy God
[1:03:06] will stay today on high
[1:03:10] amen Above All Nations
[1:03:21] is above all the nations
[1:03:33] Israel
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:49] God is fighting foreign
[1:03:58] you know in the sum of the attack
[1:04:00] against Israel the September Israel they
[1:04:04] said the missiles
[1:04:05] they sent missions
[1:04:08] and they cannot hit the target
[1:04:12] because God is somehow is gonna deviate
[1:04:15] those peace
[1:04:26] all your equipment
[1:04:29] and that's what the Bible says
[1:04:45] spiritual Israel yes

[1:05:04] [Music]
