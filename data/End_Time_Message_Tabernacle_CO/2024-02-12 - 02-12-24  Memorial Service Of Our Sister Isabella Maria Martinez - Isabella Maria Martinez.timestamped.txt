[20:07] also in Revelations some of things
[20:09] really are precious to me then I saw new
[20:12] Heaven and in New Earth Revelation
[20:17] 2114 and I saw a new Heaven and new
[20:19] earth for the first Heaven and the first
[20:21] Earth had passed away and there was no
[20:24] longer any I saw the ho City the New
[20:29] Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from
[20:33] goded as in beautifully dressed for her
[20:37] husband and I heard a loud voice from
[20:39] the saying look God's swelling place is
[20:44] now among the people and He will dwell
[20:47] with them they will be his people and
[20:49] God himself will be with
[20:51] them and and be their God he will WIP

[22:10] ever thank
[22:12] [Music]
[22:17] you
[22:19] [Music]
[22:26] think good morning
[22:29] everybody um I just wanted my name is I
[22:34] [Music]
[22:35] wrote um I just wanted to share a quick
[22:39] story of what I met Isabelle um my
[22:43] family M her as
[22:45] ja now just trying to picture where we
[22:49] lived and when we met ja there was two
[22:53] buildings um that faced each other and
[22:56] they were on a short steep
[22:59] slope our building was at the top of the
[23:02] slope and Cha lived Cy corner from the
[23:05] bottom of the SP during the summer we
[23:09] used to love in B in the grass and hold
[23:12] down the hill or use a water and create
[23:15] it and turn it into a
[23:17] was um but in the summer of
[23:20] 1996 I was seven and my little sister
[23:24] had just turned
[23:25] five um she she had been gifted a Little
[23:30] Mermaid tricycle bike with
[23:34] SH it was the first time she had I so
[23:36] really excited um my mother would always
[23:40] tell us not to play the rain
[23:44] um but it was the beginning of Summer
[23:47] and with B Forest play outside um and
[23:52] she said okay she gave okay but only on
[23:55] the
[23:56] porch um but once we were out on the
[23:59] porch and we realized that she was
[24:03] distracted um we slow started to venture
[24:06] off of the porch until
[24:10] eventually I got the brilliant
[24:13] idea and said hey let's roll this bik
[24:15] down the
[24:16] hill I don't know what we were thinking
[24:20] because the moment my little sister went
[24:22] on the hill she hit the curb of the
[24:25] sidewalk that was right in Fr of's house
[24:30] um and she flipped over a tricycle LED
[24:34] on her face first hitting her head on
[24:36] the sidewalk by the time that I ran to
[24:39] see my sister she was unconscious
[24:43] undisposed
[24:47] school I was in
[24:53] shock I remember scaming for help when
[24:56] suddenly I
[24:59] someone had Pi sister up in her arms and
[25:03] sister to her
[25:04] house that someone
[25:08] was I don't remember what happened
[25:11] after I had into the house with my
[25:15] sister in her arms mostly from a sh I
[25:18] thought I might have killed my
[25:20] sister
[25:23] um but I do remember crying outside the
[25:27] house of a porch and out and she come
[25:31] with me and I remember that she asked me
[25:33] if I wanted to
[25:45] pray I didn't
[25:47] know I do know that it
[25:51] not response to
[25:56] my I honestly
[26:00] believe that my sister could have died
[26:03] or
[26:05] after from that day on sh
[26:08] became she was at every birthday party
[26:11] every family event my grandmother
[26:13] became my aunts and uncle Grands and

[34:11] [Music]
[34:15] we
[34:25] all
[34:31] thank you for this
[34:33] song this time I want to speak a little
[34:36] bit on the word of God before we go to
[34:41] the
[34:42] ceter in a moment like this the only
[34:47] comfort we have is the word of
[34:54] God I want to take the scripture in the
[34:57] Book of
[34:58] Job the 14th
[35:02] chapter I'm going to read the first two
[35:07] verses and then I'm going to skip to
[35:10] verse 7 to verse
[35:12] 10 job is one of the oldest book of the
[35:18] Bible Job 14 verses 1 and
[35:23] 2 man it is born of a woman is of few
[35:29] days and full of
[35:32] trouble he cometh forth like a flower
[35:36] and is cut down he FL also as a shadow
[35:42] and contined not skipping to verse 7 for
[35:48] there is hope of a tree if it be cut
[35:53] down that it will Sprout again
[35:57] and that the tend the branch thereof
[36:01] will not
[36:02] cease though the root there of Works old
[36:06] in the earth and the star thereof die in
[36:10] the ground yet through the sight of
[36:13] water it will B and bring forth B like a
[36:19] plant but man dieth and wasteth away
[36:24] yeah man give up The Ghost and where is
[36:30] he that's the
[36:34] question
[36:36] friends
[36:39] family brothers and
[36:42] sisters this is one of the crucial
[36:45] moment in
[36:47] life that each one of us got the
[36:52] opportunity to think about tomorrow
[36:59] death is one of the
[37:06] unwelcome
[37:08] friends or
[37:10] enemy that can come to our
[37:14] home
[37:16] regardless how well
[37:18] prepared we might
[37:21] be
[37:22] death always is
[37:25] unwelcome so this will give us the
[37:28] opportunity to examine
[37:31] ourself just in
[37:34] case death can come and knock at our
[37:39] doors when death
[37:42] comes there is no
[37:46] notice death sometimes is not even
[37:52] polite he she is
[37:54] good regardless how many body gods or
[38:00] Army surrounding you when death comes
[38:05] nobody can stop
[38:07] her let her think about
[38:10] that so this
[38:13] morning uh we are gaed here to
[38:18] pay our last
[38:20] respect to our
[38:23] sister
[38:25] Isabella m
[38:29] this is the last thing that we can do
[38:32] for her on this
[38:36] Earth even though what we are doing
[38:40] right
[38:41] now she cannot hear
[38:44] us but we want to use this as an example
[38:49] as a moment to think that one day unless
[38:54] you be taken into the rapt
[38:58] we will be also laying down in a casket
[39:02] and there will be people
[39:06] gathering for us as we are gathered this
[39:10] morning for sister
[39:14] Isabel those who knew her and through
[39:18] the testimony given
[39:21] here her life and her
[39:25] testimony speak speaks louder in my
[39:33] eyes my personal
[39:37] acquaintance with sister
[39:40] Isabella is back from around
[39:44] 2011 when she start attending our
[39:49] church she was
[39:51] coming always in a
[39:55] wheelchair
[39:58] with a
[39:59] bus dropping her at the church
[40:04] door and uh she had really hard time to
[40:08] sit and to stand but R of the pain
[40:14] sister Isabella was always attending
[40:19] service
[40:21] and from the time she stopped coming to
[40:25] church because of her health condition
[40:29] she was always following the
[40:33] service
[40:35] home
[40:38] streaming uh sending me
[40:42] messages even when I write on the board
[40:46] of the church she
[40:48] always was there to say I don't like
[40:52] that color because I cannot
[40:54] read and uh she would go and in her
[40:58] condition buy some markers and sheep to
[41:03] the church you can tell how dedicated
[41:08] and faithful she
[41:10] was you heard the testimonies here that
[41:15] she was never complaining about her
[41:20] condition and I remember few months
[41:24] ago uh
[41:26] I went to visit her and I recorded a
[41:30] video uh where she sent a message to the
[41:35] congregation uh I projected it in the
[41:37] church but she was saying I'm still
[41:42] here whenever you get in time out of
[41:46] your busy schedule please remember come
[41:50] and visit me she was always in such a
[41:54] wonderful good mood
[41:57] but my experience with her as a
[42:01] pastor when I saw her
[42:04] life
[42:06] moving toward the
[42:08] end I had some conversation with
[42:13] her trying to find out where she was
[42:16] standing as
[42:18] believer where she will be
[42:21] going every time I had such such a
[42:25] conversation she was always telling me I
[42:29] want to serve the Lord I want to serve
[42:32] the Lord I am ready I am ready and she
[42:38] could not even
[42:40] accept whatever the doctor said
[42:44] according to science she always said I
[42:47] have faith one of these days I'm going
[42:50] to stand I'm going to walk I'm going to
[42:53] attend the
[42:54] church so
[42:56] until the last
[42:58] minute she always have that kind of
[43:02] Faith so if I can identify her I will
[43:07] say she died as a
[43:12] soldier she never give up one
[43:18] minute to the extent even the
[43:21] doctors they were very very M we want to
[43:26] do this no I don't want pain
[43:30] medicine I want if I have to go I have
[43:33] to go in the natural
[43:35] way my life is in the hand of the Lord
[43:39] what kind of
[43:41] Faith very often people in such
[43:46] condition maybe not a lot of people
[43:50] around to encourage you but the word of
[43:54] God within yourself
[43:57] was the
[43:59] encouragement always ready to sing to
[44:03] praise
[44:05] Etc uh a week before she passed
[44:09] away when I went to visit her she was
[44:13] unable to speak but she could
[44:18] hear she could move her eyes and uh you
[44:22] can tell that she's listening to
[44:24] whatever you ask saying word of
[44:28] encouragement and the prayer you can
[44:30] really see that she was struggling to
[44:33] speak but she could not and you know
[44:36] when you reach that point where you
[44:38] cannot speak I always believe there is
[44:42] something going on because before you
[44:45] pass away you will see where you are
[44:48] going and God always show the people the
[44:53] direction for the remaining portion of
[44:55] your life
[44:58] but what you see very often God will
[45:02] shut your mouth so that we cannot
[45:06] communicate we don't want to wait until
[45:09] we get to that spot so that we can
[45:12] confess our
[45:14] hung and confess the Lord Jesus to be
[45:19] your savior and
[45:23] God when we still have the opportunity
[45:26] let us think about
[45:30] that according to the scripture I read
[45:34] in the Book of
[45:36] Job job said man that is born of a woman
[45:41] is of few
[45:43] days and full of
[45:47] trouble brothers sisters friend family
[45:51] we are
[45:54] pilgrims
[45:56] we come on this Earth for few days as
[46:00] the Bible
[46:01] declares and during the few days there
[46:05] are a lot of
[46:06] troubles and I can tell you sister
[46:09] Isabella had enough
[46:13] TR she was laying on the bed
[46:17] inactive for some nine
[46:21] years everything on the
[46:24] bed where somebody else would even Curse
[46:28] God and say why don't you take my life
[46:32] why do you allow me to suffer like this
[46:35] yes but she was courageous amen looking
[46:39] always for her
[46:42] healing what kind of
[46:44] testimony we are pil as the Bible
[46:49] said for a few days but those few days
[46:53] is full of trouble brother a lot of
[46:56] nobody here is Exempted from
[47:00] troubles there are time we cry time we
[47:05] laugh time we Rejoice time abs and down
[47:10] abs and down to show us that this is not
[47:14] a peaceful place yes sir amen but this
[47:18] morning sister
[47:20] Isabella is at a place of Christ
[47:24] amen
[47:27] younger than she looks like now amen in
[47:31] a special body that's right that can
[47:34] never get sick amen where you will never
[47:37] die yes where you will never
[47:40] complain oh brother sister if they would
[47:44] ask her sister please come back look at
[47:48] the number of people Gathering here for
[47:51] you she will say certainly do your best
[47:56] come and join me over here I don't want
[47:59] to come back I know how
[48:02] painful that life
[48:05] is
[48:06] medicine after
[48:08] medicine pain after pain but there is a
[48:14] hope that one day after we cross the
[48:17] Jordan there is no more pain amen no
[48:20] more sorrow yes it's
[48:23] just living in the presence of God thank
[48:27] you Lord for eternity amen eternity
[48:31] means it will never end amen because
[48:34] eternity never
[48:37] started and if you are
[48:41] Eternal a portion of God is within you
[48:45] amen it can be dant but you need to be
[48:50] quickened by the word of God yes and I'm
[48:54] taking this opportunity to Quicken that
[48:57] portion of God that is in You by
[49:00] reminding you that there is a
[49:03] God this world did not exist by itself
[49:08] yes you did not come on this world by
[49:11] chance there is an invisible power
[49:14] somewhere yes and that power is dealing
[49:18] with each
[49:19] individual
[49:21] before your last
[49:24] day don't you turn down that small voice
[49:29] of God I'm just making some few noise
[49:33] but I know through those noise there is
[49:36] something deeper that God is speaking to
[49:39] each one of you don't you turn it down
[49:43] but consider that one day it might be
[49:47] too late and at a time you might be
[49:50] laying down on the hospital bed where
[49:54] you cannot speak
[49:56] probably you will remember see me
[50:00] standing in front of
[50:01] you by the side of sister Isabella
[50:05] casket but it could be too late my
[50:08] brother it could be too late my
[50:11] sister God is a loving God Amen he will
[50:17] never never let anyone go into judgment
[50:21] before warning yes remember in the days
[50:25] of Noah as the Bible always declare
[50:28] remember the
[50:30] of
[50:32] before the ark was close there was a
[50:37] message yes God always want the people
[50:41] and the way of warning the people is by
[50:45] a
[50:46] message it's not a good message that
[50:50] come with a lot of messages there is
[50:54] always one
[50:56] messenger per age and in this age there
[51:01] is a
[51:02] message yes sir and a messenger yes I'm
[51:07] so happy to testify before you that I
[51:12] met that message some 40 years ago while
[51:18] still living in the combo but I'm
[51:21] originally form after I originally form
[51:25] heaven but I landed
[51:28] in yes sir that's a good one yeah so
[51:32] this is where I come across this
[51:35] message and they told me according to
[51:38] the Bible open your scripture in
[51:42] Malachi 4 the Bible declares he will
[51:47] send you Elijah the prophet before that
[51:51] day amen I said what I read the Bible
[51:55] there is Elijah Elijah was raptured but
[51:59] after Elijah was raptured his Spirit
[52:02] fell upon
[52:05] Elisha and for the first coming of the
[52:09] Lord
[52:11] Jesus there was another Spirit of Elijah
[52:15] on a
[52:16] messenger and the Bible
[52:20] said you will see the spirit of Elijah
[52:24] and people start wondering where is
[52:27] Elijah when they search the Bible they
[52:31] found that Elijah lived a long time
[52:34] ago but it was not the man Elijah but it
[52:39] was the spirit of Elijah that was upon a
[52:42] man called John the
[52:46] Baptist after John the
[52:49] Baptist who was the four hun of the
[52:52] first coming for the Second Coming the
[52:56] same Bible in the Book of Malachi
[52:59] promise there will be Elijah yes
[53:02] sir before a dreadful
[53:06] day and with John the Baptist it was not
[53:09] a dreadful day but now as you see
[53:14] science everywhere declaring that this
[53:18] world has reach the end we look at
[53:22] climate change we look at Wars among
[53:27] Nation everybody is like perplex what
[53:30] shall what will happen brother I'm
[53:33] telling you something is fixing to take
[53:37] place prepare yourself
[53:41] amen there is a secret and sudden going
[53:47] away of the
[53:48] church so as I'm speaking about to watch
[53:53] my time
[53:55] as I'm speaking about Jo Jo the verse
[53:59] two said he cometh for like a flower and
[54:04] is cut down job is refering speaking
[54:09] about the nature even if you cannot
[54:14] understand the language of Elijah but
[54:17] the nature itself is teaching you and I
[54:22] giving the example of the
[54:25] flower a flower even the tree in the
[54:31] natural way we are now in the winter all
[54:36] the leaves of the trees are dried
[54:41] up the
[54:43] branches they don't have fruits and so
[54:49] forth
[54:50] but as soon as this season is over yes
[54:55] we go to Spring we will see the Life
[54:58] coming back again amen now the question
[55:01] is where was the life of the
[55:05] tree the life of the tree was hidden in
[55:08] the woods
[55:10] yes so that means three nature with the
[55:16] four season is teaching us about death
[55:22] burial and Resurrection yes it's not a
[55:26] new tree that will be planted but it's
[55:29] the same tree but the life is just going
[55:33] down and hidden in the wood waiting for
[55:37] the season yes so as human being with
[55:43] the life that is in you and I there is a
[55:47] season yes because job in his trouble
[55:51] job went through a lot of pain job lost
[55:54] his his wife job no I'm sorry job lost
[55:58] his children his belonging to the extent
[56:01] his wife was telling just curse God and
[56:06] die to
[56:10] face until the last
[56:13] minute and during that time J start
[56:17] meditating what is this if this body is
[56:22] going to be
[56:23] dead so
[56:25] what will happen to me and job received
[56:29] an
[56:30] inspiration from nature he said
[56:34] well if the trees which are not created
[56:38] unto the image of God they can season
[56:43] Changing
[56:45] Life birth death burrial and then
[56:49] Resurrection what about me a human being
[56:54] created unto the image of
[56:57] God God will just let me go like that if
[57:01] he can bring back the life of the tree
[57:04] what about
[57:05] me and suddenly the inspiration strike
[57:10] through and that's in the Book of Job
[57:14] still uh Chapter
[57:16] 19
[57:18] Verse
[57:21] 25 J said for I know
[57:25] that my redeemer liveth amen and that he
