[18:33] we have come hungry we have situation we

[18:39] foreign
[18:41] [Music]
[19:12] [Music]
[19:23] [Music]
[19:51] [Music]
[20:03] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:06] amen amen
[20:10] we are going to open our Bible
[20:15] scripture Our scripture that we read
[20:19] uh
[20:20] Luke chapter 19.
[20:31] he knows 10 years as a Christian we are
[20:34] going to read in the name of the Lord
[20:36] Jesus Christ
[20:43] I
[20:50] foreign
[21:21] foreign
[21:53] foreign
[22:13] and Jesus entered and passed through
[22:16] Jericho
[22:18] and behold there was a man named zakaris
[22:21] which was the chief among the Publican
[22:24] and it was a it was rich
[22:28] Jesus and he was and cool enough for the
[22:32] Press
[22:32] because it was leader of statue
[22:36] and you ran before and climbed up onto
[22:39] the sycamore tree to see him for he was
[22:41] to pass that way
[22:44] and when Jesus came to to the place he
[22:48] looked up and saw him and said unto him
[22:50] zacarius make Houston come down for the
[22:54] day I must abide at that house
[22:57] and he made Houston came down and
[23:00] received him joyfully
[23:02] and when they saw it they all murmured
[23:05] and say that it was going to be guests
[23:09] with a man that is sinner
[23:12] as the cures too then said unto the Lord
[23:14] behold Lord the half of my goods I give
[23:18] to the poor and if I have taken anything
[23:20] from any man by false accusation I
[23:24] restore him full fold
[23:27] and Jesus said unto him this day his
[23:30] salvation come to his this house forever
[23:33] so much as he also is the son of Abraham
[23:38] for this son of man is come to seek and
[23:41] to save that which was lost
[23:44] amen amen
[23:47] you may be splitted
[23:50] and may God bless his word richly
[23:58] uh according for the place
[24:04] once more we want to thank the Lord for
[24:06] giving us another day
[24:11] because as I always said
[24:18] our Prophet told us every time every day
[24:22] when we wake up it's a miracle
[24:24] there's a purpose for that amen amen
[24:28] um
[24:39] and we shouldn't get used to it like
[24:42] when we wake up it's just as usual when
[24:45] God wakes us up we have a purpose for us
[24:51] uh the number in second just keep me in
[24:55] front of it
[24:56] foreign
[26:06] will ask us to bring the word again
[26:09] today
[26:11] we are so grateful for that amen amen
[26:19] as I always think it's a very hard work
[26:24] s
[26:32] the day before yesterday I was thinking
[26:34] God if it's possible you can take away a
[26:38] Ministry a call from somebody
[26:42] I was going to be the first person to
[26:44] ask for that
[26:47] but I don't know if I can do such a
[26:51] thing
[26:57] is
[26:58] [Music]
[27:02] it's very difficult to be a minister and
[27:05] much more
[27:08] the second has a problem
[27:12] with everybody with the education with
[27:15] the background
[27:17] as a comprehension maybe everybody has
[27:20] their own understanding a
[27:27] it takes God to do such a work amen amen
[27:36] in terms of time as the Pastor Peter
[27:39] preached last time
[27:44] we have always to pray for our pastors
[27:48] it's very important
[28:22] I'll go straight to the point
[28:32] was a little stature man
[28:44] he was taking care of the business he
[28:47] had business that he was taking care of
[28:50] uh
[28:53] but his wife has a chance to go listen
[28:57] to Jesus Christ
[29:00] is
[29:05] [Music]
[29:06] she saw how Jesus was Healing The Sick
[29:09] he was truly the prophet uh the prophet
[29:12] for what this the scripture spoke about
[29:17] Rebecca we said that his wife her name
[29:20] was Rebecca
[29:22] even though the Bible doesn't say it
[29:25] clearly
[29:29] the glass of the scripture the Bible
[29:32] gave us the name of his wife a Rebecca
[29:44] was praying a lot to see her husband
[29:47] believing the same message she believes
[29:52] she was interested and busy to think
[29:56] about the salvation of her husband amen
[29:59] amen
[30:05] the Notre family
[30:08] to think about the salvation of our
[30:11] fathers mothers and our beloved ones
[30:17] Rebecca when she was going to the
[30:19] meeting
[30:20] the meetings of Jesus
[30:23] when she was coming back home
[30:28] she used to explain to to tell her
[30:31] husband everything that was happening
[30:40] it happened that zacharius was a
[30:42] skeptical man he was always doubting
[30:44] about once again
[30:46] despite everything that the husband and
[30:49] the wife was telling him
[30:55] he did not pay attention to anything
[30:57] just to at least go and listen
[31:30] show your own conclusion
[31:33] hey
[31:34] in one day
[31:40] whose wife was talking to him all the
[31:43] time
[31:47] but he was not interested
[31:51] and Rebecca said
[31:54] now I have to pray for my husband
[31:58] and she prayed all night long foreign
[32:53] change the mind of her husband
[32:58] he was listening from foreign
[33:16] [Music]
[34:01] shaking the heart of the husband
[35:02] and you look for atmosphere
[35:45] God always hear them
[36:00] from four
[36:02] three
[36:03] well-dressed
[36:07] when he left home
[36:10] that's where we uh
[36:13] you went down
[36:18] it took the straight way
[36:21] amen amen foreign
[36:50] Street
[37:46] what does it mean
[37:48] s Affairs straight in your business
[37:53] you want to find him
[37:56] be honest
[37:58] be sincere amen amen
[38:03] be straight with God
[38:06] and with men
[38:10] be straight with your neighbor Allah
[38:14] then you are sure that you're going to
[38:16] find him amen amen
[38:21] if you want to find Jesus
[38:24] be straight with
[38:28] others
[38:34] let not be anything that will hinder
[38:37] youth
[38:52] Christians think they always have to be
[38:54] good with brothers and sisters in the
[38:55] church
[38:57] now when you go in the neighborhood life
[39:00] was in South Africa
[39:04] this brother is not a good brother
[39:08] if you want to find Jesus
[39:12] it's in a straight way
[39:15] you have to be honest
[39:22] then you're going to find amen amen
[39:25] foreign
[39:49] right thing
[39:51] just always be thinking right
[39:56] always be thinking right
[39:59] and I have a little slogan as he says
[40:02] Jesus
[40:03] do right that's your jury to God says
[40:07] Jesus
[40:09] think right that's your duty to yourself
[40:16] and you are bound to come and write amen
[40:20] amen
[40:22] to find Jesus
[40:24] it's on this straight Street
[40:27] and the the rights
[40:31] [Music]
[40:32] means we have to be right in everything
[40:36] right in our relationship
[40:39] right between the brothers and sisters
[40:42] right among the brothers
[40:51] [Music]
[41:17] he really blessed
[41:53] [Music]
[42:17] everybody will Reverend him alone
[42:39] because the one who confined the man not
[42:43] reform
[42:46] our faith is based on God Alone
[42:50] amen
[42:52] now what gives us the favor
[42:55] it's the case because of that position
[42:59] he became very ugly
[43:04] when his wife was giving him advice and
[43:07] presenting him uh
[43:15] you became like Jose's Aussies
[43:19] God blessed him
[43:22] God gave him a good position but one day
[43:26] when you acted wrong
[43:30] and the priest told him you shouldn't do
[43:33] that eh
[43:37] [Music]
[43:42] [Music]
[44:26] but we don't understand it
[44:28] says
[44:49] [Music]
[45:32] [Music]
[45:55] and when he got there some of those
[45:58] great people were standing there is
[46:05] a place to get up to see him
[46:10] they were hanging on the walls and
[46:12] everywhere
[46:19] you know there's something about it that
[46:21] when Jesus comes around
[46:24] it's always attracts
[46:27] somehow Elizabeth
[46:38] didn't know what I was doing was
[46:40] happening
[46:44] when he was seeking where should I stand
[46:46] was to see Jesus
[46:50] [Music]
[46:59] a
[47:04] he said I will stand by this tree
[47:08] as it's coming from this side
[47:13] coming on my way you'll see me
[47:22] one idea you just wanted to see Jesus
[47:30] I won't be able to climb up
[47:34] because he wasn't short
[47:38] because what should I do foreign
[47:43] well
[47:53] I won't be able to stand up maybe you'll
[47:56] be working working on the street with
[47:58] body bodyguards
[48:00] and you see the attitude that he has a
[48:04] point where he says
[48:06] but I do not believe that is a prophet
[48:09] is
[48:16] you know time hasn't changed
[48:20] those spirits still exists
[48:24] maybe there's some people coming there
[48:26] expectative is not under expectations
[48:30] he just comes to church because it's
[48:32] just
[48:34] we don't come to church because we feel
[48:36] like we can't be because we want God
[48:42] amen amen
[49:33] instead of taking the turn Okay uh
[49:38] foreign
[49:56] [Music]
[50:57] [Music]
[51:05] upon that tree
[51:09] [Music]
[51:34] [Music]
[51:41] was working
[51:43] uh
[51:51] [Music]
[51:57] it took the garbage pill it is
[52:19] [Music]
[52:22] and the garbage fell on him
[52:26] somebody was well dressed foreign
[53:06] foreign
[53:33] thank you foreign
[53:53] [Music]
[54:44] foreign
[55:28] when you are decided to meet Christ
[55:43] your blessing
[56:09] [Music]
[56:20] I will be able to see him foreign
[57:49] this is something different
[57:52] oh
[58:32] [Music]
[58:50] let me read it
[58:56] hi
[59:17] foreign
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:45] sometimes discouragement happened in our
[1:00:48] Christian Life
[1:00:50] and the devil can use not people
[1:00:54] not even uh
[1:00:57] beloved brothers and sisters
[1:01:00] even my mother my sister
[1:01:04] for example for myself when I believe
[1:01:06] this message
[1:01:16] to discourage me
[1:01:30] and they wouldn't give me any food
[1:01:34] left
[1:01:36] these fees they wouldn't pay my students
[1:01:40] leave the message
[1:01:45] that was the devil it wasn't them
[1:01:48] critique and the critics
[1:01:51] and everything that can come away
[1:02:02] decided to see Jesus
[1:02:05] even if he has to be treated in all
[1:02:07] kinds of names
[1:02:09] they wouldn't be discouraged
[1:02:16] he'll do anything to see him if you are
[1:02:19] determined
[1:02:21] you wait your turn
[1:02:26] you'll do everything that you can
[1:02:30] just to see him
[1:02:47] from the people
[1:02:53] please
[1:02:56] I think the church should be more salted
[1:02:59] more than today
[1:03:23] and become an organization
[1:03:26] they exist that's right
[1:03:30] but you gotta have favor in
[1:03:34] itself it's the salt cellar the strength
[1:03:39] of Christ
[1:03:42] Living in you
[1:03:44] don't la force we will make him thirst
[1:03:48] to be like you amen amen
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:20] that's the way we fail
[1:04:32] to forget Who We Are
[1:04:35] perfect
[1:04:37] sometime in front of situations
[1:04:48] somebody who wanted to believe the
[1:04:51] message
[1:04:52] maybe he was taking you as an example
[1:05:01] he told me
[1:05:04] the message
[1:05:16] I was living in the neighborhood with
[1:05:19] the family that believed the message
[1:05:21] I'm telling you people from the message
[1:05:26] you know the Bible
[1:05:30] these people were telling us we're in a
[1:05:33] denomination
[1:05:35] we are first
[1:05:38] God doesn't recognize us
[1:05:41] they're the only one who received the
[1:05:43] truth
[1:05:47] personally I started believing them but
[1:05:54] what I was still deciding to go to the
[1:05:56] church
[1:06:08] that's where I said in this world
[1:06:11] there's no increase
[1:06:14] in the message in the influence he says
[1:06:20] let's pay attention to our actions
[1:06:25] because we always influence somebody
[1:06:28] else without knowing it
[1:06:31] is
[1:06:34] maybe somebody is taking you in his
[1:06:36] example without telling you
[1:06:38] can't remember maybe in your family
[1:06:41] maybe in the church
[1:06:44] you influence somebody else but now
[1:06:51] I'm acting differently that foreign
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:35] when a man sees Christ Living in you
[1:07:39] say la
