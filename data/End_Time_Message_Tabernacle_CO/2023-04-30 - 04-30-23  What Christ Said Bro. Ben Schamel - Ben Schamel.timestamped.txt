[58:39] you know the Lord does a lot of little
[58:42] things for us
[58:46] I had two thoughts for this morning
[58:50] felt led to go in a certain way
[58:55] [Music]
[58:58] it has to do with the blood of Jesus
[58:59] Christ
[59:02] so we just trust that the Lord is having
[59:04] his will in his way and
[59:10] it's trust that we can follow the steps
[59:12] of the Lord
[59:15] amen amen we just want to greet some of
[59:19] the Brethren that are in brother Freddie

[59:43] please I'm brother Ben Shamel
[59:48] and uh it's following our lot to preach
[59:51] to you this morning
[59:53] so I'm not a very good preacher
[59:57] but the Lord's just put a fire in our
[1:00:00] soul
[1:00:01] and when God puts a fire in your soul
[1:00:04] you go help let it Bubble Up come to you
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:11] you want to uh
[1:00:12] preach to you what the Lord has put on
[1:00:14] our heart this morning
[1:00:17] while we have you standing let's all
[1:00:19] just bow our heads
[1:00:22] your gracious Heavenly Father
[1:00:25] Lord we come before you yet again this
[1:00:28] morning
[1:00:30] Lord please just stand here as an
[1:00:32] unworthy people
[1:00:35] but your blood has made us worthy
[1:00:39] look we're just so thankful
[1:00:42] that we have another opportunity to
[1:00:44] gather ourselves
[1:00:46] Lord we're just so thankful that we can
[1:00:48] gather ourselves together
[1:00:51] and that we can come with an expectation
[1:00:55] that you are going to meet us here
[1:00:58] we're not serving a dead God
[1:01:01] but we're serving a living God
[1:01:04] we're not serving a god of the past
[1:01:08] we're not serving a god of history
[1:01:11] but we're serving God of today
[1:01:14] Lord Lord we're just so thankful
[1:01:17] we're thankful for your mercies
[1:01:21] order forgiveness
[1:01:23] Lord that is new Every Morning
[1:01:26] Lord there's many needs amongst your
[1:01:28] people
[1:01:30] Lord I don't know the needs but you do
[1:01:34] or we just invite you down into this
[1:01:36] service this morning
[1:01:39] whatever Avenue you would have us to go
[1:01:41] down
[1:01:44] lord we just ask that you would have
[1:01:46] complete control
[1:01:48] Lord we just asked that you would walk
[1:01:51] the aisles of the church this morning
[1:01:54] we know we didn't gather ourselves
[1:01:56] together to hear from any man
[1:01:59] but we've gathered ourselves together to
[1:02:02] hear from the Throne of God
[1:02:04] we're coming with an expectation
[1:02:08] we ask this all in the name of Jesus
[1:02:11] Christ
[1:02:14] amen and if you have your scriptures
[1:02:16] we'll go ahead and just jump right into
[1:02:18] the the scriptures and then we'll have
[1:02:19] you seated
[1:02:24] who's all happy to be in the house of
[1:02:26] the Lord
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:28] who came with a bad attitude
[1:02:31] no we all came with a good attitude
[1:02:36] amen amen if you would turn over in your
[1:02:38] scriptures Luke 23.
[1:02:41] we'll take a familiar scripture here
[1:02:43] verse 33 through 46.
[1:02:48] as I say many times we're not here to
[1:02:50] preach anything new
[1:02:54] we believe the seventh angel has already
[1:02:56] come
[1:02:58] we believe that that message has already
[1:03:01] sounded
[1:03:03] so I don't have the burden of preaching
[1:03:06] you the message
[1:03:09] I just repeat what he is
[1:03:13] amen amen Luke 23 33.
[1:03:19] and it says that when they were come to
[1:03:20] the place which is called Calvary There
[1:03:23] They Crucified him and the male factors
[1:03:26] one on the right and the other on the
[1:03:28] left
[1:03:29] is
[1:03:38] then said Jesus father forgive them for
[1:03:41] they know not what they do and they
[1:03:43] parted his raiments and cast lots
[1:03:52] and the people stood beholding and the
[1:03:55] rulers also with them to
[1:03:58] and derailed him saying he saved others
[1:04:01] let him save himself if he be Christ The
[1:04:04] Chosen of God
[1:04:16] and the soldiers also mocked him coming
[1:04:19] to him and offering him vinegar
[1:04:27] and saying if thou be king of the Jews
[1:04:30] save thyself
[1:04:34] and a subscription also was written over
[1:04:37] him in letters of Greek and Latin and
[1:04:40] Hebrew this is the king of the Jews
[1:04:49] and one of the male factors which were
[1:04:51] uh hanged railed on him saying if thou
[1:04:54] be Christ save thyself and us
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:05:04] but the other answering rebuked him said
[1:05:07] does not thou fear God seeing that thou
[1:05:10] art in the same condemnation
[1:05:18] and we indeed justly for we receive our
[1:05:22] due reward for our Deeds but this man
[1:05:24] hath done nothing amiss
[1:05:36] and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me
[1:05:39] when thou comest into thy kingdom
[1:05:45] and Jesus said unto him verily I say
[1:05:48] unto you today Thou shalt be with me in
[1:05:51] paradise
[1:05:56] and it was about the sixth hour and
[1:05:59] there was a Darkness over all the Earth
[1:06:01] until the ninth hour
[1:06:07] and the sun was darkened and the veil of
[1:06:09] the temple was rent in the midst it is
[1:06:14] and when Jesus had cried with a loud
[1:06:17] voice he said father into thy hands I
[1:06:19] commit my spirit and having said this he
[1:06:22] gave up the ghosts
[1:06:30] amen you may be seated
[1:06:33] so if we could take a thought for this
[1:06:35] morning
[1:06:38] I was struggling with a title
[1:06:42] but if we could just title this for this
[1:06:44] morning's service
[1:06:48] what he said
[1:06:51] what Christ said
[1:06:54] it's a very important thing what Christ
[1:06:57] says
[1:06:59] you know there's many voices in the
[1:07:01] world today
[1:07:04] many worldly voices that are trying to
[1:07:06] pull you this way or pull you down
[1:07:10] but it really doesn't matter what the
[1:07:12] world says
[1:07:14] what matters is what God says
[1:07:18] the world may look at you they say that
[1:07:22] you're a sinner
[1:07:25] that you're not even educated that
[1:07:29] you'll never amount to anything
[1:07:31] but it doesn't matter what the world
[1:07:33] says about it
[1:07:35] but it just matters What God Says
[1:07:40] so in verse 33
[1:07:42] the scriptures said There They Crucified
[1:07:46] him
[1:07:49] and brother Brandon breaks that down in
[1:07:51] a message
[1:07:53] and he says those four words
[1:07:56] he says there
[1:07:58] the most holy city
[1:08:04] the most holy people
[1:08:08] crucified
[1:08:10] the most horrible death
[1:08:15] the most holy person
[1:08:19] There They Crucified him Allah
[1:08:23] they asked Christ where did you get all
[1:08:25] those bruises and those cuts
[1:08:29] he said I got them in the house of my
[1:08:32] friends
[1:08:34] so when we're preaching this morning
[1:08:37] let's not point at other people
[1:08:40] so let's point it ourselves
[1:08:43] let's see what this message means to us
[1:08:47] and I want to pose to you a question
[1:08:51] so many times we have sayings in the
[1:08:53] message
[1:08:55] or even as just Christians where we say
[1:08:59] phrases
[1:09:01] and we say them but we don't really
[1:09:04] understand
[1:09:08] so many times we say that we are saved
[1:09:11] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:14] and I want you to think to yourself now
[1:09:18] what does the blood of Jesus Christ mean
[1:09:22] to me
[1:09:34] what does the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:49] Amen brother Patrick what does the blood
[1:09:52] of Jesus Christ
[1:09:54] just one word
[1:10:03] justification
[1:10:05] brother what does it mean to you okay
[1:10:14] salvation
[1:10:15] so many words
[1:10:18] that are all summed up in the blood of
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] let's see what brother random has to say
[1:10:26] about it
[1:10:27] in the message Angel of the Lord 51.
[1:10:32] Brother Branham says
[1:10:35] he says yes the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:37] won't only Clean Hands
[1:10:42] many of us have dirty hands please
[1:10:47] the scripture says even our
[1:10:50] righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:10:57] and think to yourself what does the
[1:10:59] blood of Jesus Christ mean to me
[1:11:02] he says the blood of Jesus Christ won't
[1:11:05] only Clean Hands
[1:11:17] I don't care where you came from
[1:11:24] Jesus Christ
[1:11:28] he has taken the old person that you
[1:11:31] want to learn
[1:11:34] and he has totally changed your entire
[1:11:37] life
[1:11:39] you don't see things the same way
[1:11:44] you don't do the same things
[1:11:47] why because it's not something that
[1:11:49] we've done
[1:11:51] but it is the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:11:54] changes yourself
[1:12:06] you can bury those little things
[1:12:09] because they are dead
[1:12:13] Satan sure likes to keep track of all
[1:12:14] those things that you've done wrong
[1:12:18] he tries doing CPR on that old man
[1:12:27] he tries to get that shocker machine
[1:12:32] clear clear clear
[1:12:36] let's keep Reviving this old man
[1:12:40] but the blood of Jesus Christ has made
[1:12:43] you know
[1:12:45] let's imagine you had a million dollar
[1:12:48] debt image
[1:12:51] and someone comes to your old house that
[1:12:54] you used to live in
[1:12:57] you've sold it you're living in a new
[1:13:00] place
[1:13:01] and the Creditor comes to that old house
[1:13:07] Alberto
[1:13:09] hello hello person answers
[1:13:13] well yeah I'm with the bank
[1:13:18] you owe me a million dollars
[1:13:22] the person in the house
[1:13:28] he goes nope I have your address right
[1:13:31] here
[1:13:32] isn't there such and such an address
[1:13:36] said yeah you owe me a million dollars
[1:13:42] the person that owed you that million
[1:13:44] dollars
[1:13:45] he doesn't live here anymore
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:51] that old debt is not associated with me
[1:13:56] that's associated with somebody else
[1:14:00] and sometimes that's what we have to
[1:14:02] tell the devil
[1:14:06] is no longer associated with me
[1:14:09] the house body may look the same
[1:14:13] but the person
[1:14:16] that's a totally different person
[1:14:19] that old person has passed away
[1:14:26] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] gets deep
[1:14:31] let's go back to the quote
[1:14:34] it makes the vilest sinner a new person
[1:14:38] Hallelujah that
[1:14:44] ought to make a Methodist
[1:14:46] and we aren't even methodists
[1:14:50] what should it do to a message
[1:14:55] purifying
[1:14:57] cleansed by the Holy Spirit
[1:15:00] give them their inheritance
[1:15:05] an inheritance
[1:15:09] that they last a lot that they lost Long
[1:15:12] Ago by the fall
[1:15:15] down
[1:15:18] let me tell you something churches
[1:15:21] this inheritance is rightfully yours
[1:15:27] it was yours before the foundation of
[1:15:30] the world
[1:15:32] and it was lost and given to the wrong
[1:15:34] hands
[1:15:49] that's right
[1:15:50] amen if you have a house and you take
[1:15:54] out the million dollar mortgage
[1:15:58] the title goes to the bank
[1:16:02] they are not the rightful owners
[1:16:09] refuse to redeem it
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:14] says the house is rightfully yours
[1:16:19] how long is the prices
[1:16:23] so when Jesus Christ shed his blood
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:27] the price had been rightfully paid
[1:16:32] and the asset of your salvation
[1:16:36] the asset of your healing
[1:16:42] rightfully yours
[1:16:48] it put them in a relationship with God
[1:16:52] to become sons and daughters
[1:16:56] that's enough to stir the heart of
[1:16:58] anybody
[1:17:01] and look at what what brother Branham
[1:17:03] ties right in here
[1:17:05] paragraph 28 he says just as sure
[1:17:09] not maybe so
[1:17:12] not this is kind of wishy-washy potatoes
[1:17:16] this is I have faith not hope
[1:17:21] just as sure as Jesus rose from the
[1:17:25] grave
[1:17:33] so we have received new life
[1:17:37] we have received eternal life
[1:17:40] so it doesn't matter if we go by way of
[1:17:42] the Grave
[1:17:44] six feet of dirt can't hold me down
[1:17:48] but some of us and I believe that I'm
[1:17:52] looking at a group it's going to realize
[1:17:55] who they are
[1:17:56] that they are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:01] they are going to have rapturing faith
[1:18:04] that is going to change their mortal
[1:18:07] bodies
[1:18:10] the Seven Seals have been revealed
[1:18:13] the seventh age messenger has come
[1:18:17] the Lord is coming
[1:18:20] mission accomplished
[1:18:26] there's gonna be somebody that's gonna
[1:18:29] fulfill the Rapture scriptures
[1:18:33] why not me why can't we just say that'll
[1:18:36] be me
[1:18:40] we're not looking to be Noah
[1:18:42] we're looking to be Enoch yeah
[1:18:49] but the Bible says that blood can speak
[1:18:53] if we look at Genesis 4 and verse 9.
[1:18:57] the scripture says and the Lord said
[1:19:00] unto Cain
[1:19:01] where is Abel thy brother
[1:19:05] and he said I have no idea
[1:19:08] am I the one that's supposed to keep
[1:19:10] tabs on him
[1:19:15] and he said what has thou done
[1:19:18] the voice of thy brother's blood crieth
[1:19:22] unto me from the ground
[1:19:26] think about it
[1:19:29] Abel's blood was crying out against
[1:19:36] it was crying out condemnation against
[1:19:38] Kings
[1:19:40] because Cain had shed innocent blood
[1:19:46] Abel had a revelation that it was blood
[1:19:49] that was going to cleanse him from him
[1:19:53] and in the Old Testament they took a
[1:19:56] innocent lamb hello
[1:19:58] and they would shed the blood of the
[1:20:01] innocent lamb
[1:20:03] and it would cover the sins of the of
[1:20:06] the the believer
[1:20:10] and they would do it year after year
[1:20:14] because their sins could only be covered
[1:20:19] but when the the lamb comes
[1:20:25] and when the blood of the Lamb is shame
[1:20:31] it doesn't just cover sins
[1:20:35] but it completely annihilately
[1:20:40] no no reason to cover
[1:20:44] because the sins not
[1:20:50] New York
[1:20:52] amen
[1:20:55] and then that scripture is fulfilled
[1:20:57] over in in Hebrews 12 24.
[1:21:03] and Paul says
[1:21:06] he says and to Jesus
[1:21:09] the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:21:12] and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:21:15] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:21:19] Abel
[1:21:20] amen hallelujah so Jesus is blood I
[1:21:25] don't understand doesn't speak of
[1:21:28] condemnation
[1:21:30] Jesus says
[1:21:36] science may say that blood can't talk
[1:21:41] blood can't speak
[1:21:43] but I tell you what there's an element
[1:21:45] found in blood
[1:21:49] it's called your DNA
[1:21:52] and that DNA says
[1:21:55] foreign
[1:22:12] yeah that's right and Satan may try to
[1:22:15] condemn you and all of a sudden person
[1:22:17] and he might say all of this blood is on
[1:22:20] your hands
[1:22:22] you're an adulterer
[1:22:24] you're a liar you're a cheater you're
[1:22:29] good for nothing
[1:22:31] he uses all those things to bound you
[1:22:33] down
[1:22:37] he'll try to bound you down with suicide
[1:22:41] in all of these things
[1:22:45] because that blood is speaking
[1:22:49] condemnation
[1:22:50] but the blood of Jesus
[1:22:53] it speaks greater things
[1:22:56] and he had a message come to identify
[1:22:59] that DNA hello
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:08] you're not one of them
[1:23:09] you're one of mines
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:20] speaks of who you really are
[1:23:25] praise the Lord that's what he's saying
[1:23:27] yeah brother Branham says in the message
[1:23:29] token 63.
[1:23:32] starting with paragraph 352.
[1:23:36] he says and went and when you and the
[1:23:39] word become one
[1:23:44] we could spend lots of time on breaking
[1:23:46] this down
[1:23:49] but we're just hitting the highlights
[1:23:52] but for those of you taking notes
[1:23:57] listen to the tokenya
[1:24:02] the one I I uh listened to was in 63 I
[1:24:05] think he preaches it three times
[1:24:09] he also preaches one called the sin of
[1:24:12] unbelief
[1:24:17] and you can clean a lot from those
[1:24:22] but when you and the word become one
[1:24:28] every promise
[1:24:33] I think you all need to read that with
[1:24:35] me
[1:24:37] when you and the word become one
[1:24:44] every promise
[1:24:49] not some promises
[1:24:53] every promise
[1:24:55] is yours
[1:24:58] it obeys you
[1:25:03] amen
[1:25:05] amen I my heart's wanting to like jump
[1:25:09] out of me right now
[1:25:12] do we realize what this message is
[1:25:15] God had sent a scripture
[1:25:18] but we didn't understand what it was
[1:25:21] telling us
[1:25:22] we didn't know how to decode the DNA
[1:25:26] all we saw was Crimson blood
[1:25:30] but when it starts speaking to you
[1:25:33] but the blood of Jesus Christ start
[1:25:36] speaking to you
[1:25:41] then becomes and it says every promise
[1:25:49] then you want to watch what you want to
[1:25:51] do
[1:25:55] you want to watch what you want to do
[1:26:00] you wouldn't put your hand in a fire
[1:26:04] and just say see me do it
[1:26:10] but if there's something in that fight
[1:26:15] I gotta reach for it and it'll obey me
[1:26:20] listen we're talking about sons and
[1:26:22] daughters
[1:26:26] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:28] the creator of Heaven the creator of
[1:26:32] that fire so if you have a need and you
[1:26:35] need to reach into that I don't know
[1:26:38] if you're reach into the fire and not be
[1:26:41] burned
[1:26:43] no that's impossible
[1:26:46] well I've got a brother John hello
[1:26:48] Jefferson they tried to burn him
[1:26:51] it didn't work because there was
[1:26:55] something for him to do
[1:26:57] they tried putting him in a Boiling Pot
[1:27:01] they're gonna have chicken noodles and
[1:27:04] John
[1:27:08] but it didn't work
[1:27:11] because there was something for John to
[1:27:13] do
[1:27:16] when God has something for you to do
[1:27:20] well how do I know that God's got
[1:27:22] something for me
[1:27:24] you woke up this morning didn't you
[1:27:27] you woke up this morning
[1:27:29] you have breath in your lungs
[1:27:33] your heart's pumping right
[1:27:35] and there's something for you to do
[1:27:39] we don't just come to church and sit on
[1:27:41] these these seats
[1:27:44] but we are coming for a reason
[1:27:48] amen God has something for you in your
[1:27:51] life
[1:27:53] you gotta search it out and the
[1:27:56] scripture says that the path of a
[1:27:59] righteous man
[1:28:00] is ordered of the law
[1:28:02] all you have to do is be surrendered to
[1:28:05] God
[1:28:05] take it step by step up
[1:28:10] and fulfill What the Lord Has yeah
[1:28:13] and when God gives you a commission
[1:28:16] it doesn't matter if there's a Boiling
[1:28:18] Pot in the way
[1:28:20] it doesn't matter if there's a Red Sea
[1:28:22] in there
[1:28:25] a whale in your way
[1:28:28] you could be in the belly of a whale
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:40] because you are a son and daughter of
[1:28:43] God
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:47] not limited to Five Senses
[1:28:52] but you are son and daughter of God
[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:28:56] we just let the devil tell us what to do
[1:29:02] we're living so far underneath our
[1:29:04] privilege
[1:29:06] we should have a great faith
[1:29:09] we had this message
[1:29:11] what do we have to be afraid
[1:29:22] it'll obey me
[1:29:31] see that's right
[1:29:33] you want to watch what you are doing
[1:29:36] I'll tell you one thing sometimes you
[1:29:39] think nobody's watching but foreign
[1:30:11] he's got all these things that that
[1:30:14] you've done wrong
[1:30:20] sometimes he's like oh my fingers are
[1:30:22] getting tired
[1:30:24] today is
[1:30:29] and you think nobody's watching itself
[1:30:36] paragraph 353.
[1:30:39] that's the reason Holy Spirit
[1:30:41] sparingly give out
[1:30:46] you know what I mean
[1:30:50] sometimes God doesn't give us the power
[1:30:55] because we don't know how to use it
[1:31:02] that's the reason the Holy Spirit
[1:31:03] sparingly gives out in things
[1:31:11] you don't want to
[1:31:14] he's searching for a way to say this
[1:31:18] a real servant of God don't show off
[1:31:22] everything right
[1:31:29] brother random had a gift of healing my
[1:31:32] vehicle
[1:31:33] thousands and thousands of people
[1:31:35] yes sir I've met many many people that
[1:31:39] have been in brother branham's meetings
[1:31:45] healings
[1:31:48] thing after thing after thing
[1:31:50] but brother Brandon would get sick
[1:31:55] he didn't do anything about it because
[1:31:58] the gift wasn't for him
[1:32:01] the gift was for the price
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:15] he didn't put on the gold bracelets
[1:32:19] those gifts weren't for him
[1:32:23] but those gifts were to attract the
[1:32:25] bride
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:31] you won't show off with it
[1:32:33] but then another time comes and there's
[1:32:37] a little girl that's about ready to die
[1:32:39] and brother Branham looks up to the
[1:32:42] ceiling fan
[1:32:44] there's two chains hanging down
[1:32:47] they came to a life and death situation
[1:32:52] if you believe that I can move
[1:32:56] will you have faith that God can heal
[1:32:59] you
[1:33:02] and then that chain starts whirling
[1:33:04] around like this and moving
[1:33:07] and it scared the little girl
[1:33:10] she said was God moving that or was
[1:33:12] Satan moving now hello
[1:33:19] it was my faith
[1:33:24] he had to show her that Faith was real
[1:33:29] the power of a son and daughter of God
[1:33:34] you can recognize who you really are
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] that gets deep let's move on
[1:33:45] 355 plus no single thing Paul tells us
[1:33:48] that blood speaks
[1:33:50] anyone knows that blood is actually
[1:33:52] itself can't speak
[1:33:55] it's a chemistry is that right
[1:33:58] how many knows
[1:34:01] but how many knows that blood speaks
[1:34:05] if you want to put that down Genesis 4
[1:34:09] 10 we read it
[1:34:12] God said what about your brother
[1:34:14] he said his blood cries out from the
[1:34:17] earth against you
[1:34:20] his blood is speaking Hallelujah
[1:34:23] God said what about him
[1:34:26] he said am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:34:29] and his blood crying out
[1:34:33] the blood is a token
[1:34:36] it's a token that he had been killed
[1:34:41] his blood was crying out against him
[1:34:45] now if you get that in Genesis 4 10.
[1:34:48] then in Hebrews 12 and 24 start reading
[1:34:53] the blood of Jesus speaketh greater or
[1:34:56] better things than not available
[1:35:00] he was a righteous man
[1:35:03] he died innocent
[1:35:06] because he was in the way
[1:35:08] he was in the way standing for a real
[1:35:11] Revelation
[1:35:14] he spoke it cried out the Justice blood
[1:35:19] of Abel cried out again
[1:35:23] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:32] that house has been redeemed
[1:35:35] this is yours the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:39] is a token
[1:35:41] I was listening to it this morning
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:09] it's more powerful than you can imagine
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:20] skip down to 361. it's crying out you
[1:36:24] see
[1:36:25] the blood of Jesus Christ cries out
[1:36:28] but there is forgiveness in it if you'll
[1:36:32] just accept it
[1:36:34] he says I wish I could spend a little
[1:36:36] while on that
[1:36:40] blood speaketh a better thing
[1:36:44] believe for safety security then apply
[1:36:48] it
[1:36:49] here's what you want to believe foreign
[1:37:10] claim it
[1:37:13] oh but I thought I had to shout the
[1:37:15] whole house down
[1:37:22] oh I thought I had to burn 15 candles
[1:37:30] there's a preacher in the message
[1:37:35] he used to be Catholic
[1:37:38] and the Lord starts dealing with him
[1:37:42] well he didn't know what it was
[1:37:44] he goes to the Catholic church and burns
[1:37:46] every single candle they had in the
[1:37:48] church
[1:37:52] the next service the priest
[1:37:56] he's like who burnt like a hundred
[1:37:58] thousand dollars worth of candles
[1:38:03] but he didn't feel a change
[1:38:06] because it's not what we do on the
[1:38:09] outside
[1:38:10] but the blood of Jesus Christ changes
[1:38:13] what's on the end
[1:38:16] and then it'll manifest
[1:38:20] if you take a seat and you plant it in
[1:38:23] the ground
[1:38:26] and you water it
[1:38:28] the next day you come back out and you
[1:38:30] dig it up
[1:38:33] nothing's happened
[1:38:35] and you cover it back up and you come
[1:38:39] back next week
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:38:43] nothing happens
[1:38:46] but if you let that seed sit there
[1:38:50] and you let it ripen in the presence of
[1:38:53] the Son of God
[1:38:56] then it will begin to grow
[1:38:59] see many young people go to youth camp
[1:39:04] I know what it's like to be at the
[1:39:06] Louisiana campus
[1:39:09] I know what it's like to be in the
[1:39:11] prayer line
[1:39:14] I was in the prayer line when that
[1:39:16] little girl came through with her hair
[1:39:18] all gone
[1:39:22] that little Pruitt girl went through
[1:39:24] there I thought she had cancer or
[1:39:25] something she didn't have any hair
[1:39:28] but she had uh hair clips in her hand
[1:39:35] because she had faith that her hair was
[1:39:37] coming back
[1:39:39] because the scripture says
[1:40:03] you see now tell me God ain't real Hello
[1:40:07] that's what doctor said was an incurable
[1:40:10] disease
[1:40:12] but the blood purchased it for her
[1:40:16] way back 2 000 years ago
[1:40:20] all she had to do was accept him
[1:40:31] you would say God at her at his words
[1:40:39] see this message is simple
[1:40:42] this is not a complicated gospel
[1:40:44] complicated
[1:41:00] but you know what we can do
[1:41:04] we can trust in What God Says
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:20] Jesus's blood
[1:41:24] re-wrote history
[1:41:31] you can't rewrite history
[1:41:34] well the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:38] because all those old things aren't mine
[1:41:41] dude says
[1:41:44] who writes history
[1:41:46] is it the losing side of the battle
[1:41:51] no it's the victors that read that write
[1:41:54] the history right
[1:42:02] amen
[1:42:03] World War II this is
[1:42:07] yes there were battles
[1:42:09] there were times when it looked like we
[1:42:11] weren't gonna win yeah
[1:42:15] and guess what
[1:42:18] we're gonna stay in power forever
[1:42:21] the Nazis
[1:42:27] the Nazis wrote the history books right
[1:42:33] but they did it
[1:42:35] because the victors write the history
[1:42:39] so when Jesus Christ is up there on the
[1:42:42] cross
[1:42:42] and he becomes the victor
[1:42:46] of your history
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:52] there's a story brother Brandon tells us
[1:42:59] he talks about Daniel Greenfield
[1:43:01] Greenfield
[1:43:04] brother Daniel Greenfield he was a great
[1:43:06] evangelist great preacher Daniel
[1:43:08] Greenfield
[1:43:10] he dies and goes to heaven
[1:43:15] and he gets up there
[1:43:18] there's somebody who greets him at the
[1:43:20] Pearly Gates
[1:43:24] and they say what is your name sir
[1:43:27] says I'm Reverend Daniel Greenfield
[1:43:30] Greenfield from America
[1:43:33] they say okay well let me see your name
[1:43:35] is
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:51] surely my name is
[1:43:54] I've done all this work for God
[1:43:58] is there anything that I can do get the
[1:44:01] shoes could you prefer and he said well
[1:44:03] you can appeal it in the uh in the court
[1:44:07] of God
[1:44:10] says I don't have a choice I must do it
[1:44:13] so he goes into the to the presence of
[1:44:16] God just whirling past Everything
[1:44:20] feels like he shot past the moon and the
[1:44:23] stars and was moving very fast
[1:44:27] and then all of a sudden he slows down
[1:44:32] and there's light coming from all over
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:38] and Jesus is there
[1:44:40] and God's sitting on the throne
[1:44:43] and God says who approaches my Throne
[1:44:47] says
[1:44:50] I'm from America many years
[1:44:56] and God says
[1:44:59] I require Perfection
[1:45:02] Daniel Greenfield were you uh perfect
[1:45:05] Danielle Greenfield
[1:45:07] and he said I thought I was a pretty
[1:45:09] good
[1:45:10] A preacher
[1:45:12] a Christian but he said in the presence
[1:45:15] of that
[1:45:17] he had condemnation
[1:45:20] he said no Lord I I was not perfect
[1:45:24] as well Daniel Greenfield
[1:45:27] have you ever lied
[1:45:30] and he thought I thought I was a pretty
[1:45:33] honest man
[1:45:35] but in the presence I
[1:45:41] Shady business deals
[1:45:46] who's just exactly right
[1:45:50] and he goes through this whole list of
[1:45:52] things
[1:45:55] Daniel Greenfield thought he was okay
[1:45:57] Danielle greenford Greenfield
[1:45:59] possibility
[1:46:00] he thought that's because I'm a preacher
[1:46:02] I'm okay
[1:46:04] sometimes we think because we're message
[1:46:06] Believers we're okay
[1:46:09] because we're coming to church so we're
[1:46:11] okay
[1:46:12] just because Mama and Daddy are message
[1:46:14] Believers we're okay
[1:46:20] he said well you did yeah if that's the
[1:46:23] case
[1:46:26] can you imagine a Sinking Feeling
[1:46:33] I've been in court one time
[1:46:37] and you know you wouldn't think that it
[1:46:39] would take such an emotional hold
[1:46:44] but when the judge calls you out by name
[1:46:49] it gets your attention Things become
[1:46:52] serious
[1:46:56] he says you have no room in heaven
[1:47:00] for just about that time
[1:47:04] the sweetest words you ever did
[1:47:08] sweeter words than your mother could say
[1:47:13] hold on
[1:47:18] Daniel Greenfield may have been a a
[1:47:20] sinner Daniel Greenfield temperature
[1:47:24] Jesus says while on Earth
[1:47:28] he stood there representing me
[1:48:29] that is when the jury can use that
[1:48:32] document
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:36] if he does
[1:48:40] and Satan would love to submit your
[1:48:43] documents
[1:48:49] and he says hold on I know Jesus is on
[1:48:53] his side
[1:48:55] but he would that no one would perisha
[1:49:00] I have a document
[1:49:03] and it should become a legal documents
[1:49:08] you should go into the files of Heaven
[1:49:11] says
[1:49:20] the judge says well let's see your
[1:49:21] documents
[1:49:24] and he submits the document
[1:49:27] and they scan it in nowadays to where
[1:49:30] they have it on a screen it means
[1:49:37] and it comes up
[1:49:40] and God says
[1:49:43] is this the document you wish to admit
[1:49:47] he says yes
[1:49:50] Jesus looks at it
[1:49:56] thank you
[1:50:10] [Applause]
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:37] therefore it cannot be used as evidence
[1:50:41] and that cannot sway the jury
[1:50:59] if the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't
[1:51:01] powerful enough
[1:51:04] that it couldn't loose the seals
[1:51:09] then every soul in the book would be
[1:51:12] lost
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:17] doesn't matter Paul
[1:51:20] brother
[1:51:22] all our names are in that book
[1:51:26] well as long as that book is sealed
[1:51:31] we're all lost
[1:51:34] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:37] had the purchasing power
[1:51:40] in Revelations chapter five
[1:51:44] starting with verse
[1:51:46] John saw this and he said and I saw the
[1:51:50] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:51:54] book written within on the back side
[1:51:58] sealed with seven seas and a strong
[1:52:01] angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:52:05] who is worthy who is Worthy
[1:52:30] come on
[1:52:32] and John says I wept much
[1:52:35] because no man was found worthy
[1:52:39] to open the book and to read the book
[1:52:43] neither to look there on
[1:52:47] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:52:54] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:52:58] the root of David
[1:53:01] that prevailed to open them up
[1:53:04] amen without the blood of Jesus
[1:53:08] he would not have the purchasing powers
[1:53:17] to where we can make manifests
[1:53:25] because of the blood
[1:53:29] if you can read the whole chapter
[1:53:31] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:53:34] had the purchasing power to lose the
[1:53:37] seals so
[1:53:41] I'll have to to leave that there because
[1:53:43] that's getting into my Wednesday message
[1:53:49] but he Satan is always trying to take
[1:53:52] the Book of Revelations
[1:53:55] and
[1:54:00] make it not the Book of Revelations
[1:54:05] and he wants to rename it the book of
[1:54:08] mysteries
[1:54:14] but it's not the book of mysteries
[1:54:16] it's called The Book of Revelation
[1:54:20] because God knew
[1:54:23] that in this age
[1:54:26] all the mysteries of God
[1:54:30] will be finished
[1:54:31] [Applause]
[1:54:33] we're not serving a dead dog
[1:54:36] we're not serving a God full of
[1:54:38] mysteries
[1:54:39] we're not serving a God that we don't
[1:54:42] know if he's one or if he's three or if
[1:54:43] he's two
[1:54:46] but we are serving the God
[1:54:49] he knows what he is
[1:54:52] thank you
[1:54:53] he's in a prophet he laid dead on the
[1:54:56] prophet to tell you who he is
[1:54:58] to reveal the 17th to reveal all the
[1:55:02] Mysteries to give you the Book of
[1:55:04] Revelation and make it Revelation
[1:55:08] you didn't want to give you the book of
[1:55:10] mysteries
[1:55:12] go to the library and check out the
[1:55:14] fictional books for that
[1:55:18] mystery books
[1:55:20] but that's not what we want in church
[1:55:23] what we want in church
[1:55:26] because then you can feel the
[1:55:28] stimulation
[1:55:29] [Applause]
[1:55:32] not stimulation by Mysteries
[1:55:38] but that's what the denominations are
[1:55:39] trying to get out
[1:55:42] they're trying to get you stimulated by
[1:55:44] Mysteries
[1:55:46] and a stimulation by mystery
[1:55:50] it's scary
[1:55:53] watch a mystery movie
[1:55:57] oh trying to solve this murder case
[1:56:01] oh it's all scary
[1:56:05] but the stimulation of Revelation
[1:56:08] is joy peace
[1:56:13] are you with me
[1:56:16] where is the Lord the purchasing power
[1:56:20] Jesus Christ has won
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:24] he has the purchasing power
[1:56:28] we are free
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:34] we had Supernatural ears this morning
[1:56:38] I believe you could hear down in hell
[1:56:40] yes
[1:56:43] the devils are going guys we gotta learn
[1:56:46] something about these guys
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:51] we have studied this church it was a
[1:56:53] thousand years
[1:56:57] I mean we we introduced the Catholic
[1:56:59] church so early
[1:57:02] in all the denominations we thought we
[1:57:04] could get them just a little bit off
[1:57:08] because that's all he's looking for is
[1:57:10] just a little bit off
[1:57:12] but these people are just different
[1:57:14] messages
[1:57:16] what is different about these people
[1:57:20] they're not duped by the the Trinity
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:25] why can't we get on by the trinity
[1:57:28] foreign
[1:57:59] and we can trap them
[1:58:01] put them in Chains I'm shiny and when
[1:58:05] you're in Chains you can't do anything
[1:58:07] you're just LED around by whoever is
[1:58:10] leaving
[1:58:12] so when you're feeling depressed
[1:58:18] here's the thing about the devil of
[1:58:20] depression
[1:58:23] he doesn't even try to hide himself
[1:58:28] and he likes company
[1:58:30] so you see all these young people
[1:58:32] especially
[1:58:33] you go around so depressed
[1:58:38] everybody to know that they're depressed
[1:58:42] but they try to hide it
[1:58:45] so they find another friend
[1:58:47] that's also struggling with depression
[1:58:51] oh my life is just so horrible oh my
[1:58:54] feet and this and that and my parents
[1:58:56] don't get them
[1:58:58] out they love the other siblings more is
[1:59:01] that my boy
[1:59:03] this is school and that was
[1:59:07] and he'll put a weight on you
[1:59:11] that feels like physical changes
[1:59:18] and when you're down and depressed
[1:59:22] how are you gonna have faith for
[1:59:24] deliverance
[1:59:29] you see it's a a trick
[1:59:33] um
[1:59:34] yeah
[1:59:36] but as that song goes
[1:59:39] I love it so much
[1:59:41] the song says don't be bound by Broken
[1:59:45] chains
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:51] because those chains are broken
[1:59:53] Jesus Christ already
[1:59:57] you're sitting there all depressed
[1:59:59] thinking you're bad
[2:00:03] you can't be bound by Broken Dreams
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:09] Shake It Off like Paul did
[2:00:12] your logs on the fire
[2:00:15] comes out and latches on his hands
[2:00:20] and he didn't say oh my God I'm going to
[2:00:22] die
[2:00:25] he knew he was the son of God
[2:00:29] [Applause]
[2:00:36] he was born no arms no legs maybe some
[2:00:38] of you have seen him
[2:00:41] he just Waddles around
[2:00:44] he's a great preacher he has a little
[2:00:49] like skin that he calls a foot
[2:00:53] remember in Jamba
[2:00:55] but he had a great Revelation in this
[2:00:58] he said I might not have any arms
[2:01:03] I may not have any language
[2:01:06] but do you know why God gave me a foot
[2:01:09] because at the bottom of my foot
[2:01:13] belongs
[2:01:17] Satan belongs at the bottom of our feet
[2:01:23] our heel is going to bruise
[2:01:29] God Gave You feet to stop on the devil
[2:01:33] God Gave You hands to raise to the Lord
[2:01:37] and praise him
[2:01:38] [Applause]
[2:01:45] but our names are on the book
[2:01:48] so now we can be honored like Mordecai
[2:02:00] event over an hour already so I'll try
[2:02:02] to wrap this up here pretty quickly
[2:02:07] still not as long as brother foston
[2:02:13] but in the book of Mordecai
[2:02:17] we can read about Mordecai
[2:02:20] he had done works
[2:02:24] that seems to be overlooked
[2:02:29] but pretty soon that that King has a
[2:02:31] restless night he can't sleep
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:37] election
[2:02:39] go get my book of remembrance
[2:02:43] I want to read on the book of
[2:02:45] remembrance
[2:02:47] so they go and they get the book of uh
[2:02:51] and they bring it to the king and he
[2:02:52] says read me a job
[2:02:55] and he starts reading about a great
[2:02:57] story
[2:03:00] how there was a plot against the king oh
[2:03:02] yeah and they were going to kill him
[2:03:05] but there was a servant named
[2:03:09] he found out that the the devils
[2:03:13] and he saved the king
[2:03:17] the King goes that was a good story
[2:03:21] what has been done to this morning
[2:03:24] he should be honored
[2:03:26] [Music]
[2:03:28] as that was happening
[2:03:30] in the seventh Church age
[2:03:33] the devil was conspiring his own plan
[2:03:37] about the same person
[2:03:41] and he said Let It Be written
[2:03:44] I want to hang them seven stories high
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:51] I want the world to know
[2:03:55] that Mordecai cannot be greater than me
[2:04:00] he doesn't bow when I come around
[2:04:04] I try to tempt him with all of these
[2:04:06] things
[2:04:11] you know what
[2:04:13] you know what I'm gonna go right now to
[2:04:16] the king
[2:04:17] and I'm in an accused accuse Mordecai to
[2:04:21] the king
[2:04:22] it's still really really early in the
[2:04:24] morning
[2:04:27] so he comes walking through the the
[2:04:29] court
[2:04:32] while the the king is thinking about
[2:04:34] that problem
[2:04:37] and he says who's in the courtroom
[2:04:44] that's my right hand man
[2:04:49] bring him in bring him in
[2:04:50] so Heyman comes in and he says
[2:04:54] I want to honor somebody
[2:05:00] Dio
[2:05:04] self-centered oh yeah
[2:05:08] who could the king want to honor yes
[2:05:20] he says well what should we what should
[2:05:23] we do to somebody that the king wants to
[2:05:24] honor
[2:05:26] he didn't even tell him what the Act was
[2:05:28] that he wants to honor them for you
[2:05:30] number remember
[2:05:31] [Music]
[2:05:34] well we should make a grand parade
[2:05:39] we should have the entire city
[2:05:43] we'll Rob him with the King's Road
[2:05:49] let's crown him with the king's crowns
[2:05:53] let's let him ride on the king's horse
[2:06:00] here's a Special Touch
[2:06:03] let's have a messenger go out in front
[2:06:05] of him
[2:06:10] saying thus shall it be done to the one
[2:06:13] that the king wants
[2:06:18] he's just digging his own game
[2:06:25] sometimes we do that too though foreign
[2:06:35] he says that's a that's a perfect idea
[2:06:38] I knew I could count on you
[2:06:41] you know what I want you to do that
[2:06:45] oversee it
[2:06:48] and I want you personally
[2:06:51] to walk that horse around
[2:06:56] because there's a young man his name is
[2:07:03] can you imagine Heyman
[2:07:07] his voice box went from here down here
[2:07:18] because the king want a daughter
[2:07:21] because in the book of remembrance of
[2:07:24] course
[2:07:25] name was written
[2:07:27] it didn't matter what Haman had in his
[2:07:30] mind
[2:07:41] was what God had in his mind
[2:07:50] so we'll wrap this up and try to bring
[2:07:51] it to a close if the musicians want to
[2:07:53] come go ahead
[2:07:55] it's one preachers
[2:07:58] if the musicians want to come to give
[2:08:00] the people hope
[2:08:06] we look at the thief on the cross
[2:08:11] and he was hanging there with Jesus
[2:08:15] and there's somebody across the aisle
[2:08:17] that says
[2:08:22] what about the bridge
[2:08:25] what about this what about that
[2:08:30] the message believer said do you not
[2:08:32] fear God
[2:08:35] listen he didn't even have time to get
[2:08:37] baptized
[2:08:39] he hadn't been a message believer for 40
[2:08:41] years
[2:08:44] he didn't know all the things about the
[2:08:46] church that he was supposed to know
[2:08:50] all the right things to say
[2:08:53] but all that he didn't know how to say
[2:08:55] was Lord remember me
[2:09:03] but Jesus Christ was taking on his sins
[2:09:07] he was able to recognize the power of
[2:09:11] the blood
[2:09:15] and what did Jesus say he said today
[2:09:18] you will be with me
[2:09:22] I can imagine as the thief gets to the
[2:09:24] Pearly Gates
[2:09:29] they say uh what's your name
[2:09:31] I want to see if I can find you in our
[2:09:33] our registry
[2:09:39] is
[2:09:45] mine may not be on that book
[2:09:50] I may be a thief
[2:09:52] but all I know is he said that I could
[2:09:57] be here
[2:10:01] it doesn't matter that I'm a thief
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:11] there was a woman washing Jesus's feet
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:15] she wasn't invited to the party
[2:10:19] Jesus was invited but not welcome
[2:10:22] and she's down there washing his feet
[2:10:27] and all the Pharisees say she's not she
[2:10:30] she can't be here
[2:10:32] and maybe she looked up and said I may
[2:10:36] not be welcome
[2:10:42] amen doesn't matter what you're going
[2:10:43] through
[2:10:45] but God said that you could be here
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:50] the Bride of Jesus Christ part of the
[2:10:52] raptured group
[2:10:56] you might not be the best message
[2:10:58] believer
[2:11:01] maybe you just became a Christian
[2:11:04] it doesn't matter because all that God
[2:11:07] said is you could be here
[2:11:10] so what does the blood mean to you
[2:11:13] don't take it for granted
[2:11:16] do not take the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:11:20] because it's by the blood you are
[2:11:22] cleansed
[2:11:24] all you have to do is claim it
[2:11:30] so back to the question
[2:11:32] what does the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:11:38] all the Revelation that's in this book
[2:11:42] was purchased by the blood
[2:11:45] your every promise
[2:11:49] was purchased by the blood
[2:11:54] how we ought to be thankful
[2:11:56] how we ought to be a happy people
[2:12:00] because everything that you have needed
[2:12:04] has already been purchased
[2:12:09] and all you have to do is reach out and
[2:12:12] clean
[2:12:17] I can only preach as hard as I I know
[2:12:19] how to preach
[2:12:20] I can only say the words that I know how
[2:12:23] to sing
[2:12:24] but it's Gotta Be You that catches the
[2:12:27] revelations
[2:12:38] and that Rapture is coming soon
[2:12:42] so what about you
[2:12:45] if you haven't already come to Christ
[2:12:47] now's your time the Rapture is coming
[2:12:50] soon we don't have much longer
[2:12:53] around in the world and see that
[2:12:56] but in
[2:12:58] it
[2:13:00] s powerheads
[2:13:02] if anybody has a need
[2:13:05] a sickness
[2:13:08] [Music]
[2:13:09] you struggle even with
[2:13:14] just Reach Out And Touch the blood of
[2:13:16] Jesus Christ
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:25] but that blood is more powerful today
[2:13:30] than it ever
[2:13:33] made it
[2:13:35] if Jesus's literal blood was here this
[2:13:38] morning
[2:13:39] if I had a jar of Jesus's literal blood
[2:13:45] and I was to anoint you with that word
[2:13:50] no more for you now
[2:13:53] then what you can do with it by reaching
[2:13:58] out and touching the Lord
[2:14:02] I'll invite you to pray with me
[2:14:05] pray however you want
[2:14:08] standing up sitting down
[2:14:11] [Music]
[2:14:13] in your mind and he's saying it out loud
[2:14:16] it doesn't matter
[2:14:19] but Reach Out And Touch the Lord
[2:14:24] it doesn't matter what's going on in
[2:14:26] your family
[2:14:28] it doesn't matter the financial
[2:14:30] struggles
[2:14:34] it doesn't matter what's going on in the
[2:14:36] church right now
[2:14:38] what matters is you reach out and touch
[2:14:40] the Lord
[2:14:44] his blood will cover you so so
[2:14:47] you are Sons and Daughters of God
[2:14:53] pray with me
[2:14:56] dear gracious Heavenly Father
[2:14:59] Lord we just come before you yet again
[2:15:02] Lord we're just so thankful for the
[2:15:05] blood of Jesus
[2:15:07] it has purchased our Salvation
[2:15:10] it's broken the Seven Seals Wide Open
[2:15:14] Lord it's delivered to us Revelation
[2:15:18] Lord not that we can just say that we
[2:15:21] know something or we're educated
[2:15:25] but Lord they are broken to give us
[2:15:27] rapturing
[2:15:30] Lord that we might manifest that our
[2:15:33] names are on the books
[2:15:36] help us to manifest
[2:15:39] that our names are on the book
[2:15:43] whatever the needs are amongst your
[2:15:44] people this morning

[2:15:49] I can only do what I can do Lord
[2:15:53] this has all been broken up in pieces
[2:15:58] but Lord I just ask that you would deal
[2:16:00] with the people
[2:16:02] that you would have your perfect will a
[2:16:05] perfect way in every situation
[2:16:08] whatever their need is
[2:16:11] I just asked that you would just take
[2:16:13] them in your hands
[2:16:20] we just thank you for your presence
[2:16:23] we could be at many places
[2:16:26] but Lord we're just thankful to be in
[2:16:28] the presence
