[36:01] &gt;&gt; And thanking you for coming tonight.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; You may sit please for a minute.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; May God richly bless you.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; I know tonight
[36:23] [Music]
[36:27] It was again a sacrifice for you to come
[36:29] in the house of the God of God.
[36:32] But
[36:37] &gt;&gt; I believe we will have a reward.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry.
[36:46] We can feel tired.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; But
[36:52] I believe one of these days
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Paul said
[36:58] &gt;&gt; the suffering of present time
[37:03] be compared to the glory to come.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And this message is a great message.
[37:14] Take you courage
[37:17] &gt;&gt; and one of the days you will be rewarded
[37:24] &gt;&gt; being tired, hardship, problems.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Then one day we'll be rewarded.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:49] I was thinking of uh preaching and pray
[37:52] for them that are still feeling sick
[37:59] and I felt like the Lord didn't want me
[38:01] to do it.
[38:08] Maybe he would give it to somebody else
[38:10] one day.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, the pastor's here for
[38:17] all these things
[38:23] because the prophet says the pastor.
[38:30] He has all the power to pray for the
[38:32] sick.
[38:39] It's not only reserved for the
[38:41] evangelist.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Then our pastor,
[38:48] &gt;&gt; he can pray for the sick.
[38:53] But again tonight
[39:03] I feel treated as a prince.
[39:15] [Music]
[39:17] And I was saying when you're being
[39:19] treated as a prince, what can you do?
[39:22] [Music]
[39:25] Therefore, let us stand and greet each
[39:29] other.
[39:34] Greet the person next to you.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Greet as many as you can.
[39:46] The pastor warned me here as everywhere
[39:49] everywhere else
[39:52] &gt;&gt; during the week we don't have much Hi.
[40:13] I will take a topic, a golden uh topic.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; May God richly bless you. Amen.
[40:28] [Music]
[40:32] &gt;&gt; I really wanted to pray for you, but I
[40:34] will nevertheless do it at the end of
[40:36] the meeting.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; If somebody's sick,
[40:46] if somebody's going through hardship,
[40:50] &gt;&gt; we will pray for him.
[40:55] I think if the pastor has a bottle of
[40:58] oil in his office, anointing oil,
[41:03] &gt;&gt; we will now.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Anyone that would like to be anointed
[41:30] I will pray for he that's going through
[41:32] hardship at the end.
[41:36] You have the right for it.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; You are coming here so we can do
[41:45] everything that we could do for you.
[41:48] And we have to do it.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; It's your right.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; As when we preach, we preach as we
[42:01] preach like this every day. We preach
[42:05] responsibility.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; It's a responsibility.
[42:17] The time is gone. When we're young,
[42:18] we're preaching that as we were seeking
[42:20] for glory.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; But
[42:27] when you get older in the business,
[42:31] you understand.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; It's a responsibility.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; It's your right.
[42:42] when heaven will come.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; So you can enter into the heaven
[42:51] &gt;&gt; with the message of William Brennham.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; We have to make sure
[43:02] if there be God, you may see him.
[43:07] If there's ever heaven, you will go.
[43:13] and all your sin be taken away. Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And you'll be completely changed.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; And be different from the people of the
[43:28] world
[43:30] that will please us.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:39] I say inashi that I always love
[43:44] to see men and women
[43:48] &gt;&gt; leaving the earth
[43:51] &gt;&gt; and going up to glory
[43:54] &gt;&gt; from this church
[43:58] and that's what we want.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; It's a crowning of the job that we
[44:04] doing.
[44:06] Have joy.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Be blessed.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Let sickness leaves you.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Let death gets away from you
[44:21] &gt;&gt; and you be happy, truly happy.
[44:26] May God grant you the desire of your
[44:28] heart
[44:32] and everything that you need of
[44:36] may really give it to you
[44:40] and when we could be back next next year
[44:43] or for in the next time.
[44:47] Let us see
[44:49] that he truly bless you
[44:53] and he truly blesses you
[44:57] &gt;&gt; and that will give us joy
[45:01] to hear that God has taken away your
[45:04] sickness.
[45:08] hearing that God has blessed you
[45:12] to learn that God has given you children
[45:16] when you didn't have them
[45:19] &gt;&gt; and even though you have them
[45:22] &gt;&gt; and may God give you more
[45:26] will give us joy.
[45:31] We want to be in heaven us with our
[45:33] children
[45:35] &gt;&gt; as Jesus will say
[45:41] &gt;&gt; myself and the children that you have
[45:42] given me.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:48] All right.
[45:54] Now we wanted to take this scripture.
[46:18] doesn't
[46:27] discipline.
[46:28] I was I wanted to make sure to ask so
[46:31] that I can be disciplined.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; May God bless you richly.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; If I say one word and that blesses you,
[46:45] I think that will be enough.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; But let's take the scripture
[46:52] &gt;&gt; in this day.
[46:55] I was thinking of the scripture
[46:59] firstian
[47:01] chapter 4.
[47:10] Amen. Thessalonians
[47:14] Thessalonians chapter 4
[47:18] [Music]
[47:20] &gt;&gt; from verse 13.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:28] [Music]
[47:34] [Applause]
[47:37] But I will not have you to be ignorant,
[47:39] brethren, concerning them which are
[47:41] asleep.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; That you s not even as others which have
[47:53] no hope. Amen.
[48:00] But
[48:00] &gt;&gt; we if we believe that Jesus died and
[48:03] rose again,
[48:06] [Music]
[48:11] &gt;&gt; even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[48:14] with God bring with him.
[48:18] [Music]
[48:22] But this we say unto you by the word of
[48:24] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; That we which are alive
[48:32] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[48:38] shall not prevent them which are asleep.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:44] For the Lord himself
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout
[48:54] &gt;&gt; with the voice of the archangel
[48:58] with the trumpet of God.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Will come from heaven will descend from
[49:05] heaven.
[49:08] And the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain
[49:18] &gt;&gt; shall be caught up up together
[49:22] &gt;&gt; with them in the clouds
[49:26] to meet the Lord
[49:28] &gt;&gt; in the air.
[49:31] And so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[49:38] Wherefore comfort one another
[49:41] &gt;&gt; with these words.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; You may be seated, please.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; I will say a word of prayer.
[49:55] Let's pray.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Lord our God,
[50:02] &gt;&gt; I can see your children.
[50:06] that have left far away
[50:11] &gt;&gt; with distances that are here,
[50:16] &gt;&gt; but they have come in your house
[50:20] &gt;&gt; to hear your word.
[50:22] [Music]
[50:26] The Bible says, "Men shall not live by
[50:28] bread alone,
[50:31] &gt;&gt; but
[50:35] But every word that proceedth out of the
[50:37] month of God,
[50:40] &gt;&gt; and the month of God in this hour is the
[50:43] prophet of the end time.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[50:49] bless this church here.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Each man by his name,
[50:57] &gt;&gt; each woman by his by her name.
[51:02] Every child bear his name.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Distribute the benediction.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Share pour the blessings.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Announce your people.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Bless our dear pastor.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Bless his ministry.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Bless this church.
[51:21] Bless.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; We want our Lord.
[51:28] this church grow in number.
[51:32] May this church be filled within and
[51:34] without.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; And let nobody fall sick.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; All of them be in good health.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Fill them with your spirit
[51:51] and bless the reading of the word.
[51:55] May you take us aside
[51:59] and you yourself speak in this place
[52:03] &gt;&gt; that will give us life
[52:05] that will do us good
[52:08] &gt;&gt; that will heal the sickness
[52:12] &gt;&gt; and that will bless this church
[52:15] &gt;&gt; for the glory of your name
[52:18] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:27] I wanted us to add another scripture.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; I believe it's not just a little one,
[52:36] but it's a big one.
[52:46] It's in the first Corinthian chapter 15.
[53:04] I believe you found that place.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; I believe you find it.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[53:22] I would want us to read from verse 50
[53:24] 51.
[53:26] [Music]
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Behold, I show you a mystery.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep,
[53:42] &gt;&gt; but we shall all be changed.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:47] In the moment,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; in the twinkling of an eye,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; at the last trumpet,
[53:57] &gt;&gt; for the trumpet shall sound,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; and the dead shall be raised
[54:02] uncorruptible,
[54:05] &gt;&gt; and we shall be changed,
[54:08] and we shall be changed.
[54:15] For this corruptable body must put on in
[54:18] corruptionality
[54:23] &gt;&gt; and this mortal must put on immortality.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Hallelujah.
[54:31] So when this corrupt shall have put on
[54:33] incorruptionality
[54:37] &gt;&gt; and this mortal shall have put on
[54:39] immortality
[54:44] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[54:47] is written death
[54:52] is swallowed up in victory.
[54:57] Where is that steam?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, great. Where is that victory? May
[55:02] God bless the reading of his word.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Tonight,
[55:11] &gt;&gt; we are going to speak a little bit.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; If you don't finish it up,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; I think one day we will be able to do
[55:24] it.
[55:26] Hello.
[55:28] [Music]
[55:31] &gt;&gt; I wanted just a little bit tonight
[55:39] speak of the mystery of the rapture.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Because
[55:50] for all of us that have come in the
[55:52] message of bread of bread,
[55:55] [Music]
[55:58] We have come to go to the rapture.
[56:02] We came to go to heaven.
[56:06] [Music]
[56:07] &gt;&gt; We do not come here
[56:10] [Music]
[56:12] to be Christian for Sunday morning.
[56:15] Sunday morning Christians.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sunday morning Christian.
[56:19] [Music]
[56:22] our Bible
[56:25] or the Jehovah witnesses,
[56:32] but we have come here as the elected.
[56:38] [Music]
[56:39] Our name was written in the lamb's book
[56:42] of life
[56:44] before the foundation of the world.
[56:49] And God brought us in this world
[56:53] &gt;&gt; that is not really our world.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; That is the world that the way it is.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen to this?
[57:06] [Music]
[57:12] [Music]
[57:13] &gt;&gt; We see how bad the world has become.
[57:19] said,
[57:27] "The world is finding himself in a gross
[57:29] darkness."
[57:34] In which it never been before.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you will say amen to
[57:40] this.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; There are wars everywhere.
[57:49] lay everywhere as was prophesied by
[57:51] brother Brennham
[57:54] &gt;&gt; because
[57:58] our messenger the prophet William Brham
[58:01] [Music]
[58:05] &gt;&gt; he's not an evangelist
[58:08] &gt;&gt; but he's a prophet
[58:12] a prophet He's
[58:14] [Music]
[58:17] someone that went before God and spoke
[58:19] to with God.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And God gives him the message for that
[58:27] time
[58:31] and for people that are living in that
[58:33] time.
[58:37] So they can know what God thinks
[58:41] &gt;&gt; because of them.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the prophet s.
[58:49] And when he comes,
[58:54] God shows him everything that is
[58:56] happening in that time.
[59:01] God is showing him what is seen in that
[59:04] hour.
[59:09] what the prophet calls sin. That's what
[59:11] God calls sin.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And then you warn the people.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; This is how we hear.
[59:23] You have people that can say amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to this?
[59:32] And then people they know what God
[59:34] thinks
[59:37] and William Brham
[59:40] &gt;&gt; he's not as Luther.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He's not like Wesley.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He's not likeosphet.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He is a prophet.
[1:00:00] That's why we know everything God has
[1:00:02] prepared for this hour.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; The message demonology
[1:00:15] so we can go quickly.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; He's praying.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; It was preached uh June 6, 1953.
[1:00:28] Dear God,
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I realize the great uh darkness of
[1:00:40] civilization is setting taking place
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:46] and is now over.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; The middle of the day is gone.
[1:00:57] The evening shadows are falling.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Great light is breaking forth
[1:01:09] from the kingdom of God
[1:01:12] to take its place
[1:01:16] of this gross darkness
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; coming on the earth.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] Now he's saying I realize that there's a
[1:01:31] sunset.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Now time is over.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; We are at about the evening time
[1:01:43] and now
[1:01:48] the great light of God is breaking
[1:01:51] forth.
[1:01:54] from the kingdom of God
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; to take its place of this gross darkness
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:03] coming on the earth.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:02:09] Now this is the time in which we are
[1:02:11] living in
[1:02:13] a very darkness time.
[1:02:19] In a few time
[1:02:23] plagues will be falling
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; and they are already some are falling
[1:02:30] now. Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; As we have seen with co
[1:02:38] that killed a lot of people
[1:02:42] but people don't understand it.
[1:02:47] All them plagues is showing us God is
[1:02:50] upset
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; and he's about to destroy this earth.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Let me read another quotation
[1:03:04] before I start talking to you
[1:03:08] about my topic
[1:03:11] and then I will end.
[1:03:18] My brothers and sisters,
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; you truly have to understand
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; that requires to be careful.
[1:03:31] That is why we have come in this
[1:03:32] message.
[1:03:34] This is the message of the prophets
[1:03:38] as the elected.
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:45] We shouldn't die as just anybody.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; No, no,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; we have been warned.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; The words that brother Benam is giving
[1:03:56] us.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; It's for us to escape
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; to go to to the glory
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:10] vista.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; He preached in Sar Vista.
[1:04:14] uh
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; uh January 1264
[1:04:23] say
[1:04:24] [Music]
[1:04:32] the world in a very chaotic age of
[1:04:35] darkness
[1:04:41] that never been before.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless,
[1:04:51] there's a blessed light
[1:05:00] that never shine.
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:06] The difference
[1:05:09] just is just
[1:05:17] like it was in the beginning
[1:05:23] when there was gross darkness
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:28] upon the earth.
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:35] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:05:37] face of the water.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And God said,
[1:05:42] "Let there be light
[1:05:47] separated the light from the darkness."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And I believe
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:58] now we are now living in that hour
[1:06:00] again.
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:05] that when
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; when God is separating light from
[1:06:09] darkness
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; and
[1:06:19] is pressing it to the other side of the
[1:06:21] world
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; on to the other side of the world
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; and that lightest
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; that's the light may be made manifest
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; and then the church.
[1:06:40] Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:52] The reason I will say shalom to them is
[1:06:55] because that is God's peace.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I say shalom.
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to bring to you this
[1:07:11] morning
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; for the new year.
[1:07:19] Not looking back,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; but we are looking forward
[1:07:36] to the breaking of the new day.
[1:07:40] until there's something
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; great
[1:07:49] laying ahead of us
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; where the years has been
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:02] there. There has been a joy
[1:08:07] that we looked forward to.
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:15] And we see the pressing the coming of
[1:08:17] the great light.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; we can see
[1:08:29] that's we can see it's breaking over.
[1:08:38] It's breaking over the
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:48] breaking between moral and mortality.
[1:08:52] Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And we see the world find himself in a
[1:09:01] very chaotic age.
[1:09:05] in a very chaotic age.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And for us the elect,
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; our name has been written before in the
[1:09:22] blame's book of light
[1:09:25] before the foundation of the world.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And God had chosen us.
[1:09:34] He did not choose some other people.
[1:09:37] Do you say amen?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Even before the world was created,
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:49] God was standing as we are
[1:09:54] and we were coming.
[1:09:58] And when we were coming
[1:10:03] He knew people that will love him.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; That was before we do any evil and good.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Before the world ever begin
[1:10:18] and but when we were coming,
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; he takes this one he put on the side
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; and the other way passing.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; He take the other one,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; he put him on the side.
[1:10:31] and the rest were passing.
[1:10:33] He take the other one, he put him on the
[1:10:36] side
[1:10:37] and the rest they will keep passing.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it was
[1:10:44] and move over
[1:10:47] in this age in which we're living in.
[1:10:50] And God looked
[1:10:52] and he called them and start writing
[1:10:54] their names. This one he writes his name
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; and the names the name the name the
[1:11:05] names
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; and he writes
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; and he knows they will go in the war and
[1:11:13] slay the man and shed the blood.
[1:11:15] Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] We have been chosen.
[1:11:23] The rest the work is the walking.
[1:11:29] But when God finished to write the
[1:11:30] names,
[1:11:33] he takes the book and he placed it here
[1:11:36] upon his room and he kept it
[1:11:41] in. He is sure that you will never be
[1:11:43] lost.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; No matter what will happen.
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:49] No matter the teaching that will be
[1:11:51] given
[1:11:53] because you are an elect.
[1:11:57] It says the elect
[1:11:59] they will never be deceived
[1:12:03] because the elect have the words.
[1:12:07] You cannot come.
[1:12:10] You interpret the word on your own way.
[1:12:13] The elect will never believe it.
[1:12:19] The egos are very stubborn against lies.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You are the eagles.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You are very stubborn against lies.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Because the word that we are preaching
[1:12:34] is in your hearts.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; God placed it in your hearts.
[1:12:40] Hallelujah.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; The words there
[1:12:46] He allows you to verify.
[1:12:50] Nobody can deceive you.
[1:12:54] Even the devil himself,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; he cannot entice you
[1:13:00] because you are an elect.
[1:13:03] Your name are written in the book.
[1:13:06] It's kept by God.
[1:13:09] No matter where you go,
[1:13:12] let it be you are in the United States.
[1:13:15] You are in China
[1:13:17] where the way you be, find yourself,
[1:13:20] it's kept.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Nobody can deceive you.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take you away.
[1:13:32] When they give you something wrong, God
[1:13:35] comes, he takes it away. He cast it away
[1:13:39] in the dust.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; He leaves you and lets you leave.
[1:13:45] because you are an elect.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:13:52] God.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; He started calling his children.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; When he was done with Israel,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; you say amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And then he started calling his
[1:14:10] children.
[1:14:12] Jesus died at the cross.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; His blood was shed.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; His blood was for to redeem them that
[1:14:28] had the name written in the book. Amen.
[1:14:32] Amen.
[1:14:34] And then now
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; the church started
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; God started his own church
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; in the time of
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; in the time of Aris in the time of
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; mountainesley
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; in the time of William.
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:58] God had to call his church
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; through seven times
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; the elect.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Seven time.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; The the the the seven time is calling
[1:15:19] them the watchers.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; He's calling those seven time the
[1:15:25] watchers.
[1:15:28] And there have been seven watches. Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; God had a church in the time of Paul
[1:15:41] that was engaged. Just engaged.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; She was just engaged.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And somebody went to find a a wife.
[1:15:55] He knows about the same time there will
[1:15:57] be a wedding.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; He gives her the wedding ring.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; The engagement ring.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; He gave her the engagement ring.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen to that?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And then he started with his wife.
[1:16:21] He comes and gives her the word
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; because she's the word
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; because the the the groom is the word.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; The groom and the brides are one.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? Wait.
[1:16:46] as a groom
[1:16:49] is the word. The bride has to be the
[1:16:50] word.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:16:57] he started moving forward with her.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[1:17:04] Every age
[1:17:06] would call people.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:11] his bride.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He gives a special message to his only
[1:17:20] bride.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That is why the ego are very stubborn
[1:17:27] against lies.
[1:17:32] No matter what the Pentecostals can do,
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; we will never believe.
[1:17:40] Though they wake, they they raise the
[1:17:42] dead,
[1:17:44] we will never believe.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; We have our own message.
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; I know you can say amen to that.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:17:59] when we get at the end time,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; this is the time of a wedding.
[1:18:08] We are at the seventh hour.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; We are at the seventh watch.
[1:18:20] And there it's a right time for the
[1:18:22] groom to come and take his bride.
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And it's right that those people that
[1:18:32] called from Paul all the way to William
[1:18:34] Brennham.
[1:18:37] And you are here.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You are there.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You are the people that have been called
[1:18:45] at the seventh watch.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And when we come,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Because since he started calling people
[1:18:58] since the time of Paul all the way to
[1:19:00] the end,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; it was to rapture them.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:06] Do you understand?
[1:19:11] He
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; is to bring them to the wedding supper.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; To bring them to the wedding supper of
[1:19:18] the lamb
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; because this is the evening time
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; and then it's a wedding supper.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Who understood it so far? Were you?
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; It's It's not dining
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; the time of the the the moon the noon
[1:19:40] was gone
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; it's not a breakfast
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; no
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; no no
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; breakfast time was the time of Paul
[1:19:52] God has reserved a time
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; for the wedding supper
[1:20:04] and when all the virgin that God called
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; I showed you Paul it's from the year 53
[1:20:13] to 170
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; and the from 170 to 312
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; and Mark
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; from 32 to 600
[1:20:33] something
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; in time of Columbus.
[1:20:40] We were one of 520 to 1750
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and the time of Wesley
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; and 1750
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; and the time of Wesley came about.
[1:21:00] Are you with me?
[1:21:03] And that went all the way to 1906
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and then afterward
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; in the time of William Brham.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; And this is the evening time.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; This message is the message of the
[1:21:16] bride.
[1:21:18] This the message that we have
[1:21:21] is the bride's message.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; It has been given to the the wed bride.
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:32] It's uh addressed to the elect's bride,
[1:21:36] elect lady. Are you saying amen to this?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Because I want you to understand.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want to start teaching about the
[1:21:46] rapture if you don't understand what it
[1:21:48] means.
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:52] Now, it's about the wed bride.
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's about the elect lady.
[1:22:01] That's you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's all of you this morning. It's all
[1:22:06] of us here.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; This is the time of the brided bride.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And the word that is bringing forth
[1:22:16] is the opening of the seals.
[1:22:22] The mystery that have been hid before
[1:22:23] the foundation of the world.
[1:22:28] the the the mystery that got hit in the
[1:22:30] back part of his mind.
[1:22:33] Now he's taking it
[1:22:35] and reveal it to us.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That's why God had revealed everything
[1:22:40] to us.
[1:22:43] He had revealed us the marriage.
[1:22:46] If you have mistaken about marriage,
[1:22:49] that's your own problem.
[1:22:52] But God has given
[1:22:54] the whole revelation about marriage. for
[1:22:57] God.
[1:22:59] A man has to have only one wife,
[1:23:03] not many.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; God did not give Adam a lot of wives.
[1:23:13] He gives him only one wife. It's Eve.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Who knows is the truth.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Right.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:27] And we really want to keep the purity of
[1:23:29] the word
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; for God.
[1:23:35] A a a young lady has to go to marriage
[1:23:39] virgin.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's what we believe.
[1:23:47] I I know you know the the the par
[1:23:49] parable of the the 10th virgin.
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:55] Now I'm speaking about the waiting time.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Because God
[1:24:04] after calling the seven churches,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; all them churches,
[1:24:11] a time has to come
[1:24:15] where the groom that was in heaven
[1:24:18] has to come on earth.
[1:24:23] He has to take his bride
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; meaning all them churches from Paul to
[1:24:33] all the way to William Brham
[1:24:37] that's his bride
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; and he has to take her back who
[1:24:43] understood it who understood it
[1:24:47] and when he take her back
[1:24:50] is to took her to heaven.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we call rapture.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; We have come to go to the rapture.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; All them that was asleep.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; From Paul
[1:25:06] to Irene
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; to Martin.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; All of them
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; to all the way to William.
[1:25:16] All them churches
[1:25:20] are
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; his bride.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I I want you to understand it. I don't
[1:25:30] want it to move like that.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:25:35] that's his own bride.
[1:25:39] And when we get to the evening time,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; about the evening time,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; he said there was a time
[1:25:49] that was neither day or night,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; but about the evening time,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; the light shall come
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; and the light is this message.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; It's this message that we have.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Are you happy?
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:09] That's the evening light.
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; That's the evening light.
[1:26:15] We don't walk in the darkos.
[1:26:21] They just make their own songs
[1:26:25] in their own mind.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Our prophets,
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; God gave him songs.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; That's what we see.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But
[1:26:41] this church that we are
[1:26:44] that's here that's everywhere
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; that has been called by this message
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; it's the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:56] and when we are there
[1:27:01] is the end of the dispensation.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:07] This is the the end of the time of
[1:27:09] redemption.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; There's no prophet after us.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; There will not any be any people be
[1:27:17] after us.
[1:27:19] We are the last ones.
[1:27:23] And Jesus comes.
[1:27:25] Do you understand it?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; To take us
[1:27:32] and to take us to heaven.
[1:27:36] to the wedding supper of the lamb.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Natural types is spiritual.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; It's like as a man,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; he choose his wife
[1:27:49] and the wife.
[1:27:51] When the time comes,
[1:27:54] he takes the wife to the pastor and the
[1:27:57] pastor,
[1:27:58] he he consecrates them and he bless the
[1:28:01] wedding.
[1:28:03] But right after the wedding, when they
[1:28:06] leave,
[1:28:10] they go to the reception, the wedding
[1:28:12] supper.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; God does the same thing as men. Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; God is
[1:28:27] he found out that the seven churches are
[1:28:29] not complete.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] and they constitute his beloved bride
[1:28:41] because people the tender of Paul they
[1:28:43] slept
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; because from 53 to 170 that's been a
[1:28:50] while
[1:28:52] people from they slept already.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] them of mountain they slept
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; because now it's 600 after Jesus
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; them of Columbus they slept
[1:29:16] that's 1600 after Jesus
[1:29:19] that many years they died
[1:29:22] them of Luther died
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; do you understand so
[1:29:28] Then of Wesley they died
[1:29:30] they slept
[1:29:33] theos they died they slept
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; the only living people
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; is the people of William Brenham
[1:29:43] it's you here
[1:29:46] and now the time has come
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; and Jesus has to come
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; taking his own bride
[1:29:58] and then he takes care.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; I was thinking of bringing three books
[1:30:10] and then
[1:30:12] Jesus has to come.
[1:30:15] The time is no over.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; There will not be anything behind.
[1:30:26] We are the last.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You could be the last one that was
[1:30:32] called.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus comes from heaven.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul is saying.
[1:30:46] He's explaining the mystery of the
[1:30:47] rapture.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus comes,
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; we don't have much time.
[1:30:55] But I'll just say what I can say.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Jesus comes three
[1:31:02] times on the earth.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; In all the plane of redemption,
[1:31:09] Jesus will come three times on the
[1:31:10] earth.
[1:31:12] The very first time
[1:31:14] he was to redeem his bride.
[1:31:17] That's what he did at the cross.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that?
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] And now the second time.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; When he comes,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; when he came first,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; he was to redeem his bride.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; He went to Calvary.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He died on Calvary.
[1:31:40] Can you say amen?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He died on Calvary. Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:31:49] he had to come back for the second time.
[1:31:53] And that was to finish the plan of
[1:31:55] redemption. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And to take his ride that he called
[1:32:04] since Ephesus.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:32:09] And then at that time,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; it's now.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; That's the time.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It's when it comes on the cloud.
[1:32:22] I see the cloud back there. Wait,
[1:32:28] that's when he comes to take his bride.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Who understood it so far?
[1:32:34] That's the time we are living in is
[1:32:37] coming
[1:32:40] to reveal the fullness of the plan of
[1:32:42] redemption
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; because he took the book
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; out of the hands that he that was
[1:32:50] sitting on the throne
[1:32:53] now is coming to take his bride.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But that bride,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; that's who we are.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; It's us here. Hallelujah.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; And to take us to take us to heaven
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; because we are on the earth.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; It takes care of to taking three things.
[1:33:21] It takes the shout
[1:33:24] when it comes down.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It takes the shout.
[1:33:30] These are the things the material to

[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; People from Denver,

[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; them that are over there.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; It's the shouts calling them.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; But Paul said the Lord himself. Yes sir.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; No his friend

[1:37:32] us
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; who understood it.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Even if I don't finish it,
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; our pastor will finish it up.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; But the thing that you had to know
[1:37:48] the Lord
[1:37:53] when he realized that all the seven
[1:37:55] churches are ready
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and now they all formed the bride of
[1:38:01] Jesus
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; the last church
[1:38:06] then he should he had to come amen

[1:38:23] but he knew
[1:38:25] that it took three things
[1:38:28] to rapture his bride.
[1:38:32] He required the shout.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; That's the message to gather the
[1:38:38] together the bride.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; The message of winner.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And then afterward
[1:38:48] He had to take the voice of the angel
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; and that voice
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; he comes along with it.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And then afterward
[1:38:58] he also brings the sound of the trumpet
[1:39:01] that's Paul said.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; That's what
[1:39:07] these three things
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; allow allows him to rapture us.
[1:39:13] The shouts

[1:39:42] There are two people, two category of
[1:39:46] people that going in.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Some are already dead.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; You've seen people of four, they already
[1:39:55] dead.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; The people,
[1:39:58] the
[1:39:59] mountain,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Wesley,
[1:40:03] all of them,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; they were already dead. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] It's only us alive.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Even us,
[1:40:17] there are people, some of us are already
[1:40:18] dead.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of the rapture
[1:40:24] concern two kinds of people,
[1:40:28] the first category. Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; One group they dead.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You understood it.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; You understood it.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; They were already dead.
[1:41:02] Even some of us
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; they were already dead.
[1:41:08] But there are some that are still alive.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; We are still alive.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Can you applaud?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:25] We are still alive.
[1:41:28] Then we are concerned
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; because we need to go to the rapture as
[1:41:33] well
[1:41:35] to to the rapture.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Two category of people that go to the
[1:41:40] rapture.
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:42] Them that were dead.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; They go into the rapture by
[1:41:53] resurrection.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; They go in. They enter in the rapture by
[1:42:00] resurrection.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.

[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; we go we enter into rapture by
[1:42:13] translation.
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:16] That meaning our body will change.
[1:42:19] We don't die.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; We are alive.
[1:42:24] The time of the rapture comes and then
[1:42:26] God
[1:42:28] it changes our body
[1:42:32] without passing through the grave
[1:42:37] and we are walking
[1:42:39] we are walking like this. As we walking
[1:42:44] and then we change
[1:42:46] and we go to the rapture.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Who can say amen? Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And when we change,
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; we are going to meet them that were
[1:42:58] already dead,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; that were resurrected.

[1:43:33] But the dead,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; they received the voice of the angel.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And the voice
[1:43:45] that raised them as he resurrected
[1:43:48] Lazarus.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; And the sound of the trumpet.

[1:50:27] You see

[1:50:35] your name was written before the
[1:50:37] foundation of the world before uh in the

[1:51:00] called out of. As Moses called the
[1:51:03] nation out of the nation, the Holy
[1:51:05] Spirit is calling a bride out of the
[1:51:07] church.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; A church out of the church members
[1:51:12] from every denomination making up a
[1:51:15] bride.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Bride tree.

[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; A bride coming out call. And that's the
[1:51:24] one that the bride tree is the bride
[1:51:27] rather. He is the one that is going to
[1:51:30] be in the rapture.

[1:51:40] the beginning.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; The father spiritual.

[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:52:05] I always tell the elect.
[1:52:08] We don't go to the rapture
[1:52:12] because we deserve it.
[1:52:15] Because we don't steal,
[1:52:17] we don't lie,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; we don't do things.
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; We go to the rapture because God elected
[1:52:28] us.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And God told the Holy Ghost,
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is the tutor, the
[1:52:40] master of the church,
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; as I showed you. Yes.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He's the tutor.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; He is the one keeping the child.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; God tells told the the Holy Ghost
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; because God has his book.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; As we are preaching,

[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; They are in the book.
[1:53:15] I give a little teaching, right?
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I always tell people
[1:53:24] what I give it's a teaching
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; but
[1:53:29] there's a boss himself.
[1:53:33] There is a boss himself.
[1:53:35] When he comes,
[1:53:38] he just choose you.
[1:53:41] He put you in the rapture.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; He takes you and then he send you to the
[1:53:46] rapture. He takes the other one and send
[1:53:48] you to the rapture.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; He take the other one to the rapture.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; He's the boss himself.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; That's the boss himself.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Does he make you happy?
[1:54:09] Do you know that the boss knows you?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, he knows you.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; He knows you.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; That is why he calls you here.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; The one that didn't call, they're not
[1:54:24] here.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:54:27] let's go quickly.
[1:54:30] I see now you understand it.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Let me read a little bit.
[1:54:36] Do you did you understand a little bit
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; where this great ministry ministry of
[1:54:43] the rapture is going?
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; We have come here to go to the rapture.
[1:54:53] Somebody asked me a question
[1:54:56] uh on on the TV
[1:54:59] when I was speaking of the second coming
[1:55:01] of the Lord.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; It was in China.
[1:55:04] He said, "Pastor Masi,
[1:55:08] you are speaking of the coming of the
[1:55:10] Lord.
[1:55:17] Do you know that only people that knows
[1:55:20] the coming of the Lord will go to the
[1:55:21] rapture?"
[1:55:25] I was with another pastor there at the
[1:55:27] platform.
[1:55:28] I told him,
[1:55:31] "Pastor, I know the answer.
[1:55:34] I know the answer.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; I told him
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; to understand simply the mystery of the
[1:55:44] coming of the Lord.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; It's the grace God has given to us.
[1:55:52] But when it comes to go to the rapture,
[1:55:56] it's God himself that is choosing them
[1:55:59] that will go to the rapture.
[1:56:02] I don't know if there are people that
[1:56:04] understand you.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; You know, Peter understood better.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "You are the son of God."
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You have been revealed
[1:56:17] by God."
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; But Thomas didn't understand anything.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Thomas have no clue.
[1:56:29] Even John at that time didn't understand
[1:56:31] anything.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; But when you look around the throne,
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; there are 24 elders,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Matthew is there.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:56:46] Paul is there.
[1:56:48] Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; yeah, it's there. Even to
[1:56:56] that did not believe
[1:56:59] I don't believe he's resurrected.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I have to touch I have to touch him.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; But when you look
[1:57:10] there are 24 elders around the throne.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Meaning it's just the grace of God.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; It's just the grace of God.
[1:57:24] It's not because you understand very
[1:57:26] well the mysteries
[1:57:29] that does not depends how well you
[1:57:31] understand the mysteries.
[1:57:34] I always tell people
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; we you are here in the great city
[1:57:41] never
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; it's true
[1:57:46] but there are people in the villages
[1:57:52] they don't even have a page of the
[1:57:54] message
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; but they believe brother Benham is a
[1:57:58] prophet
[1:58:01] and they believe the liter that has been
[1:58:03] taught to them.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; They believe the litter.
[1:58:11] They believe the litter
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; and they are there in the jungle.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; They never seen a car.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; But
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:26] the pastor write hands write everything
[1:58:29] on his book.
[1:58:32] notebook.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, in the notebook.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; That's from what he's teaching from.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know all them mysteries.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; But when the rapture will come,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; God will rapture them.
[1:58:50] God doesn't say,
[1:58:52] "Oh, they don't have a laptop.
[1:58:56] They're not going to." No,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; just one page.
[1:59:03] And that was enough for them to go to
[1:59:05] the rapture.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; But how about you?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; You're going to go to the rapture.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[1:59:21] There there's a woman
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; but I'm speaking of
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; in the message
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; I think it's influence
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; that women
[1:59:43] [Music]
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; it's it's called Monro
[1:59:49] Marilyn Monro.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Marilyn Monroe.
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; She was a celebrity in Hollywood.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; She was in Holyhood.
[2:00:03] What about one day?
[2:00:06] She was a true prostitute.
[2:00:12] the she they had a lot of books of her
[2:00:15] that has been published
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; now.
[2:00:24] Bam went to the mountain to rest
[2:00:28] with his family.
[2:00:38] And the newspapers publish that uh she
[2:00:40] was killed when she was in
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; she she committed suicide when she was
[2:00:46] in a room.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; But now
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; saw that in a vision
[2:00:56] and told his family
[2:00:58] this woman did not commit commit
[2:01:01] suicide.
[2:01:04] She had a heart attack
[2:01:09] and no better
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; in the message the flashing red lights
[2:01:14] of his coming
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; he started talking about this woman
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:21] he said this woman
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; she's the the most beautiful woman since
[2:01:30] Eve all the way to the end.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:01:36] But she did not commit suicide.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:01:41] [Music]
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; But she had a hard time.
[2:01:47] And when she she reach out her hand to
[2:01:49] take the the pills and she died.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:01:55] And says
[2:01:58] in the message the flashing red lights
[2:02:00] of his coming.
[2:02:04] I believe Marilyn Monro
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; she was looking for something
[2:02:13] say I believe she's saved
[2:02:17] a prostitute
[2:02:20] she did all kinds of things
[2:02:24] but says
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I believe she's saved
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; because she was looking for something.
[2:02:34] She was looking for something.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; It's this message.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; But she never came across the message.
[2:02:44] But since she was looking for it,
[2:02:47] I believe she's saved.
[2:02:50] Now listen.
[2:02:53] If the fact that she was just looking
[2:02:55] for the message,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; a prostitute,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; but she's saved.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; How about you?
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; You that have found the message
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; that have come here
[2:03:10] and the pastor supposed to baptize you
[2:03:13] in the name of Jesus.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; How about you?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; She did all that. Oh, he did all that.

[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in the grace?
[2:03:44] Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to read

[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; how do you know that you're an elect?

[2:05:37] We are going to
[2:05:42] say
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; paragraph 130.
[2:05:47] In the midst of the rapture,
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:05:53] three things has to happen before Jesus
[2:05:55] appears.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; A shout,
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; a voice,
[2:06:03] a trumpet.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Let's take the shout.
[2:06:10] Jesus does the three things
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; as he's descending
[2:06:18] a shout.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; What is the shout?
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; It's the message
[2:06:26] going forth first
[2:06:29] and
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; the living bread
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; of life bringing forth the bride.
[2:06:39] Did you understand very well
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; and this message?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; It's the shout

[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; It's the message that called us
[2:06:59] paragraph
[2:07:03] needs to be enough.
[2:07:05] He has to send this.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; The first thing that comes
[2:07:12] when he starts descending
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; from the heaven,
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; there's a shout.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; It's a message
[2:07:23] to get the people together.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; A message
[2:07:28] comes forth first.
[2:07:32] Now lming lamp trimming time.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; It's a lamp trimming time. Rest
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; and trim your lamp.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can say amen.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; It's a midnight cry
[2:07:55] to call the virgin
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; and we are those virgin.

[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; You put your oil
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; in your lamp.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; You go from justification
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; to sanctification.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; From sanctification
[2:08:19] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; from the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; to the sealing
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; and the sealing translation
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; to the translation.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:31] And your body changes.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; And we go to this wedding supper.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; But your new body,
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; it's in you right now.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:47] [Music]
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; You have to trim your lamp
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; to go to that great rapture.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:08:58] I believe
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; that's the way it is.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; And the justification
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; to the sanctification
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; sanctification
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; and to sanctification
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; from the bottom of the Holy Ghost to the
[2:09:17] ceiling
[2:09:20] there at the summit of the pyramid.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; That's where we are.
[2:09:26] We are in the third pool my friends.
[2:09:29] Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; We are working for the change of our
[2:09:35] body
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; and the the shout.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's the message
[2:09:42] and the voice of the occasion
[2:09:44] is the voice of the resurrection
[2:09:48] calling the the dead to the
[2:09:50] resurrection. Paul said that the Lord
[2:09:53] himself shall descend
[2:09:56] with shout with the voice with the sound
[2:10:00] of the trumpet.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; The very first thing that happens
[2:10:06] the dead in Christ shall resurrect
[2:10:10] first
[2:10:12] and then
[2:10:14] we that are alive.
[2:10:17] And said when it was asked
[2:10:21] There's the bread we gathered in the
[2:10:24] west.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; they don't have to gather there at the
[2:10:31] west.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; They will be gathered.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:37] And when Jesus descends
[2:10:40] when revelation 10 happens, he'll say
[2:10:44] the very first thing
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; will raise first
[2:10:51] and then us which are alive.
[2:10:56] You can read in the question answer
[2:10:58] number one paragraph 53. He says
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; the very very first thing that happens
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; We that which are alive
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; we will continue
[2:11:17] simply
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; as nothing happened.
[2:11:22] And then after
[2:11:24] we will start
[2:11:27] running in the the speed of the mind
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; and we will meet them that were already
[2:11:34] resurrected.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:40] He says why we don't see them.
[2:11:44] But you could see them.
[2:11:48] He said I see brother Stewood.
[2:11:51] Hey brother.
[2:11:54] He's waving his hand. He's over there at
[2:11:57] the door.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; He say because when we look
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; we see about the the 70th of second. It
[2:12:15] really go fast when we look
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; with our own eyes.
[2:12:22] But they are in a faster dimension.
[2:12:24] Okay.
[2:12:27] A faster dimension.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; But
[2:12:35] the day we will be in the same body as
[2:12:38] them,
[2:12:40] we will be able to see them.
[2:12:43] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:46] And then brother says
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; we will be changed
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; and he says in Abraham and his seed
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; we will uh change according to the the
[2:13:01] principle of Eston
[2:13:04] said
[2:13:10] if two cars or two objects are traveling
[2:13:13] in the speed of Right?
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; They can cross paths without hearing
[2:13:21] each other.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Okay? Why?
[2:13:25] Because in that speed,
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; do you say amen?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Because in that speed,
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; everything breaks apart.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; You know why we change the body?
[2:13:42] When you reach that speed,
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; our body,
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; it's formed
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; with calcium,
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; potassium,
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; potassium,
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; petroleum,
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; and the petroleum
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; and the cosmic light
[2:14:01] and the body goes back to the dust
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; because of the speed.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; And then we go into another body.

[2:16:35] or atonement.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; But what is the atonement?
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; It's Christ
[2:16:50] personified in his word
[2:16:53] and made flesh among us.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; This is what we're going to be.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that will resurrect
[2:17:03] us.

[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; He will take you to heaven.
[2:17:33] He will take you to the wedding supper.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; He's the one checking up your name.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; As long as your name is in there,
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; you'll be there. Amen.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:18:12] of Daniel
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will be raptured
[2:18:20] since people don't know what is what's
[2:18:21] the Holy Ghost
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; they will never know
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; they will go on continue to preach
[2:18:30] calling souls to Christ
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; to go to church
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; to sing.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; But
[2:18:39] the Holy Ghost will be raptured.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; That is why while he's still here.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; You have to seek after him.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; You have to have it.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; He is the one giving you the new body.

[2:19:06] Abraham changed his body. Sarah changes
[2:19:09] her body. He said this eye this senses.
[2:19:16] God is in confusion.
[2:19:18] But

[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; is in here in this building,
[2:19:44] right next to you,

[2:19:53] that sing.

[2:20:12] when he got inside of you. It gives you
[2:20:15] the faith of the rapture.
[2:20:17] It gives you new body.

[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; tonight,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; a new body got into many people
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost.
