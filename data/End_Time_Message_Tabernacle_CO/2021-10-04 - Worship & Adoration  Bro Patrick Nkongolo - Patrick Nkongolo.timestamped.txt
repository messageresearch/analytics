[9:29] on the monday in jesus christ's name
[9:32] amen amen amen
[9:34] you may be seated as i greet you all in
[9:37] the name of the lord jesus
[9:41] is you
[9:43] amen
[9:49] first i want to correct something i said
[9:52] during the
[9:54] the preaching here
[10:00] i've been talking about uh the word back
[10:02] biting
[10:07] backbiting yeah i was taking it
[10:09] literally
[10:13] that to go buy it in the back
[10:20] yeah but uh i look also in the
[10:22] dictionary
[10:25] and i heard brother martin
[10:27] uh interpreting last
[10:29] wednesday jean jupiter
[10:45] so
[10:46] backbiting in in english means to talk
[10:50] behind somebody
[10:52] uh backbiting on anglais on francis a
[10:54] video parliament
[10:57] you go talk you bite somebody on his
[11:00] back
[11:01] usually
[11:04] that's not a good habit anyway
[11:09] or if you don't
[11:12] if you somebody does something to you
[11:15] and you want to hurt them back it's not
[11:17] a good habit to still
[11:20] seek
[11:25] the person
[11:26] bon appetit and i think we come to
[11:28] church
[11:30] please to get rid of those habits
[11:35] and uh believe by god grace during this
[11:38] series
[11:40] did you john
[11:41] god is going to show unto each one of us
[11:44] where we had still a bad habit do you
[11:48] montreal whiskey nose amount to the
[11:50] movies
[11:52] brother bonham said i think i saw
[11:55] one of the quotes
[12:02] uh what we need to understand
[12:05] our christian journey seeking devon
[12:08] compounded
[12:22] if we don't pay attention to certain bad
[12:25] habits
[12:27] on patterns uncertainty
[12:29] those habits will also continue to grow
[12:32] caesar between continuing grandiosi and
[12:35] brother that's very very critical
[12:38] critique you can have a certain spirit
[12:41] uncertainty god is speaking to you in
[12:44] various ways juve paula do many are
[12:47] different and if you always overlook at
[12:50] those habits a c who may please this is
[12:53] abitude
[12:54] that's a demon send them on it's a life
[12:58] satan v unless you stop it
[13:02] by repentance
[13:04] by confession but unconfessional by
[13:07] exposing that demon an exposency demo it
[13:10] will never leave you
[13:12] in the backyard it will continue to grow
[13:14] the
[13:18] continuation so as we come to church
[13:22] brother bonham said in uh
[13:24] the message the church order
[13:31] sister hope i think that will be a big
[13:33] confusion from where i'm reading maybe
[13:35] it's uh page four
[13:41] uh
[13:45] brother bonham said we believe in
[13:47] justification by faith
[13:52] roman 5 1.
[13:57] we believe that after a person being
[14:00] justified by faith
[14:02] in person
[14:04] he has peace with the lord jesus christ
[14:10] but it's a possible message
[14:14] that this same person recipient person
[14:17] could have habits avoid this attitude
[14:20] such as drinking gum while smoking for
[14:24] me doing things that he should not do
[14:27] fairly skinny develop affair filthy
[14:30] habits of the flesh the movies salsa
[14:34] between the share
[14:36] when i start looking at all the things
[14:38] currency comments are regarded to
[14:39] tissues i remember the quote we read
[14:42] last wednesday
[14:51] that you are here for the healing of
[14:54] your boy jose paul aguirre is underwater
[14:57] and for the healing also of your
[14:59] daughter
[15:00] devoted you see and you are looking for
[15:03] the baptism of the holy ghost if women
[15:05] we should actually but them descent is
[15:06] free if
[15:08] see
[15:08] you can get rid of those hobbies
[15:13] god is going to give you the baptism of
[15:15] the holy ghost
[15:17] and he is also going to heal your son
[15:20] and your daughter he will get it i will
[15:22] see what official fear so brother we see
[15:25] that certain habits
[15:28] are the cause of the healing
[15:32] sun la cause the reason and also the
[15:35] cause that you cannot come to the
[15:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[15:42] so as we come to church i look a new
[15:45] venus please we become justified
[15:48] justification means you believe in the
[15:51] lord jesus christ
[15:54] but the fact that you said you believe
[15:58] that's not all seneca
[16:00] you still carry certain habits
[16:04] a boy born in a muslim family and on
[16:08] foreign will carry some habits of the
[16:11] muslims evaporate
[16:13] between the family museum etc
[16:16] and the brother problem continues
[16:19] then we believe that the blood of jesus
[16:21] christ sanctifies this person
[16:25] this is a purificated person
[16:28] for the service of the lord holy service
[16:30] designer
[16:32] we believe in sanctification according
[16:35] to hebrews 13 12 and 13.
[16:42] where jesus also
[16:44] wishes you see that he might sanctify
[16:48] people with his own blood it was
[16:50] something
[16:54] suffered without the gate
[17:01] skipping a little bit and we also
[17:04] believe in kuala lumpur that after the
[17:07] person has been sanctified april a
[17:10] person
[17:11] here and the clean habits has gone from
[17:14] the person
[17:15] disability
[17:17] and a person
[17:19] he is a believer on the lord jesus
[17:22] christ
[17:24] jesus and his habits are gone this is
[17:28] some party we believe that
[17:31] that he is a candidate for the baptism
[17:33] of the holy ghost present candidate by
[17:36] term descent speech brother you cannot
[17:38] become candidate to the baptism of the
[17:40] holy ghost
[17:42] candidate but i'm descent to speech with
[17:44] certain habit have acceptance between
[17:47] them those habits have to leave is abit
[17:50] you do have patience but how they can
[17:52] live my commands
[17:54] if they are not identified see and in
[17:57] some parts
[17:59] they must be identified you do have
[18:02] identified and you must be aware of
[18:05] those habits would they be able to
[18:07] conceal this is attitude and when you
[18:09] become aware a composite concern then
[18:12] you have to work on the vehicle
[18:16] because the baptism of the holy ghost is
[18:18] very important ask your bottom descent
[18:20] is important
[18:22] that's even the key for the rapture
[18:26] long live amen
[18:28] so that's uh how we need to approach our
[18:31] own life since
[18:35] we believe in by faith
[18:39] and then we need to be cleansed
[18:43] sanctified sanctified with the blood of
[18:47] christ avec the son of the christian to
[18:49] the word we are listening to dave
[18:53] and once we become so sanctified
[18:58] then god will be able to fill us
[19:02] because the holy god cannot come in a
[19:04] dirty heart basket and send you new
[19:06] people down
[19:09] amen amen
[19:11] so i also want to thank you for
[19:14] those who didn't pray for me even i did
[19:16] not ask for uh james
[19:22] you could tell last
[19:24] wednesday
[19:29] because it was a prayer i could not
[19:31] really do a lot of effort
[19:34] i know the creation
[19:36] but
[19:41] my nose was stuffy
[19:44] monet
[19:47] and i was wondering what is what am i
[19:50] going to do on sunday
[19:53] really demonstrate because when you have
[19:55] a certain thought you don't want to cut

[35:23] rapture don't sit on the preparation
[35:26] to know all the signs of the time
[35:30] it's wonderful
[35:32] uh we know this is going to happen next
[35:34] in savannah
[35:36] this is taking place in jerusalem this
[35:38] is a passage this is taking place with
[35:41] russia this is a passage catholic church
[35:43] is doing this all the this catholic
[35:45] facility to know all these things is
[35:46] wonderful
[35:49] but where are we with our preparations
[35:54] and the key of our preparations
[36:03] as the natural bride is preparing for
[36:06] the weddings
[36:10] and that's the reason why brother bonham
[36:12] said we read it last sunday
[36:16] in the message a total deliverance
[36:18] message
[36:20] he said you did
[36:22] we don't want to be a halfway church
[36:25] noble empire calling a glitch a
[36:26] missionary we don't want to be a halfway
[36:28] christian part of the cultural mission
[36:30] if we don't want to be christians
[36:33] that's fine say marvel then let's go do
[36:36] everything the world is doing hello
[36:38] month montfaire
[36:40] but if we want to be christian medicine
[36:43] then they will let us stop everything
[36:45] that christians don't do aloha return
[36:47] developers
[36:49] and do only what christians are supposed
[36:51] to do
[36:52] more
[37:19] we need a total delivery
[37:22] deliverance total
[37:24] from our sins they know
[37:26] from our evil thinking they no more
[37:29] responses
[37:30] a christian
[37:32] to be a christian
[37:34] you have to
[37:39] that's how sometimes you see somebody
[37:41] walking on the street
[37:45] you see why he's talking to himself
[37:48] we are in the fight the song doesn't
[37:50] come back sit and get out of my mind hey
[37:52] satan saw them upon saying you are
[37:54] walking through sit and visit your mind
[37:56] sir thank you visit whatever you know
[37:58] even brother branham came to that spot
[38:19] you will find yourself you consume all
[38:21] these bad things
[38:22] over consumers response responses and
[38:25] you keep going every country and
[38:27] sometimes for a day a perfect program a
[38:30] week
[39:54] jesus went too fast
[39:56] forty days and forty dollars
[39:59] we're not eating again when he came late
[40:02] eventually the devil the devil a good
[40:04] person in banter
[40:05] jesus christ
[40:07] you know what jesus i know you are
[40:22] scriptures
[40:26] i cannot do anything for the glory of
[40:28] jesus
[40:30] nothing for his glory
[40:32] but very often
[40:34] the devil will give you a scripture
[40:50] amen
[40:50] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[40:54] so that's what branham said
[40:56] what evil thinking a demon says from
[40:59] evil doing no more visactions form our
[41:01] negligence
[41:03] acceptance
[41:08] [Music]

[41:48] will happen kirkus shows us if we want
[41:51] to see the
[41:52] hand of god cinevolo vallamente the
[41:55] supernatural

[44:44] that's to obey god
[44:47] and if each person doing his past
[44:50] follow the fire brother the fire is
[44:52] going to fall okay you're really fake

[52:02] i
[52:08] but i'm continuing but that isn't what
[52:11] they were looking for tonight
[52:14] we are not looking for the mechanism
[52:25] and what we need now is to see that a
[52:27] second what is
[52:30] this what uh we have been taught all
[52:33] these years
[52:36] is it the truth or it is not celebrity
[52:40] brother that's your showdown
[52:43] you want to ask yourself the question
[52:46] all these messages we have heard those
[52:49] years do some messages on the season
[52:51] about what god has done i proposed a
[52:53] secretary is that true or not ask us
[52:57] you must get the answer yourself would
[52:59] they be a valid possibility you must be
[53:01] convinced yourself
[53:03] and in which way they can mania all the
[53:05] word to god and stand for andrew and
[53:07] john pastor should take a jeffrey paul
[53:09] on twitter i want to call jesus on my
[53:11] sins
[53:22] over and over and over and over this
[53:25] year
[53:26] two different seminaries and churches
[53:30] is a glisten city street until we are
[53:32] looking to see who this person
[53:41] amen is my title this morning allah
[53:43] almost is my time the holy ghost is the
[53:46] dynamic of the church
[53:48] the scientists
[53:49] dynamics
[53:51] the holy ghost is the dynamic
[54:08] the church is there they preach the
[54:10] existence that the church is not called
[54:12] to stand still merry christmas
[54:15] the church has been called to go into
[54:17] the rapture
[54:18] apparently
[54:19] but all the mechanics of the church
[54:21] cannot bring the church up matthew
[54:28] [Music]
[54:34] to get a glorified body full reservoir
[54:38] and cognition
[54:41] that requires a certain power stellar
[54:43] exhaustion certain croissants a certain
[54:46] dynamic in certain dynamics
[54:55] what shall i do with jesus called christ
[54:59] jesus
[55:00] christ
[55:03] the church has to go the
[55:05] and the believer must be transformed
[55:07] electron do i have to get concentrated
[55:10] to be changed with the vertical
[55:11] transform listen to brother
[55:13] he said he did a powerful statement oh
[55:16] in declaration
[55:18] he said
[55:19] the dynamics of this church
[55:22] let dinner make the set of glasses will
[55:24] be a refilling of the holy spirit
[55:27] and wrong places
[55:30] that we have worked in a small measure
[55:40] but the fullness of them make the
[55:43] dynamic mela
[55:45] le compre la la dynamic complex
[56:07] the full power of the holy ghost love
[56:10] with sons complete the sentence will
[56:12] raise her up violent
[56:14] just exactly like that just exactly
[56:17] mindset even the dead in memory more
[56:20] that's dead in like uh in christ set you
[56:23] some christian for hundreds of
[56:26] years ago
[56:28] will rise in the beauty of his holy
[56:30] spirit
[56:33] and take a flight to the skies
[56:37] here the dynamics latin america this is
[56:40] the holy spirit era
[56:42] brother we have seen this several times
[56:45] a pleasure for duo by brother branham
[56:48] the snape of cabana let me go on this
[56:50] side say molly de cote we have the
[56:53] church it's among the glaciers as the
[56:55] church started
[57:10] and after
[57:24] so
[57:35] what's next patience la paso
[58:02] love
[58:03] one two three four five six seven
[58:06] seven steps i love set it up so coming
[58:09] from
[58:10] porn
[58:19] so this is
[58:21] a small measure of the holy ghost saying
[58:24] patrick measure the scientists play but
[58:26] now this is the mechanic cecila mechanic
[58:29] you cannot go pump vapor the head stone
[58:32] must come la pia de ferto
[58:48] the holy ghost here hmm santa's family
[58:51] so the holy ghost
[58:53] is the uniting power cellar prisons
[58:55] initiative that will make this body
[58:58] perfect
[59:00] because the way the body
[59:03] many angles come down one two under
[59:07] three
[59:09] but the headstone mela pierre defense is
[59:11] perfect
[59:14] not perfect number of gods
[59:16] number
[59:18] in order for this body to become to
[59:20] perfection
[59:22] this headstone must be united
[59:26] when it matches perfectly
[59:30] what the
[59:43] the dynamic of this church latin america
[59:47] the mechanic is good the mechanic i know
[59:50] here the faith here the phrasing is by
[59:52] the holy spirit separate sentence in a
[59:55] smaller nation
[59:56] then virtue
[59:58] die holy ghost
[1:00:09] the dynamic of this church the dynamic
[1:00:11] there is my brother without the dynamics
[1:00:16] dynamics
[1:00:17] there is no rapture in your father
[1:00:19] without the holy ghost
[1:00:21] you came out to be changed
[1:00:23] without the holy spirit
[1:00:25] you cannot do anything
[1:00:31] [Music]
[1:00:41] of this church the certain glaze
[1:00:45] the dynamics
[1:00:48] will be a revealing of the holy spirit
[1:00:52] that we have worked in a small
[1:01:11] [Applause]
[1:01:21] remember he said the sound as he
[1:01:23] descended communism and the science
[1:01:26] elections taken the picture photography
[1:01:29] for which you purposefully
[1:01:30] to unite with the rest of the holy
[1:01:32] spirit
[1:01:39] to take the bride into glory
[1:01:41] they pose down a little more that's the
[1:01:43] dynamic of the choices
[1:01:46] amen amen
[1:01:48] why the headstone is coming down to
[1:01:50] unite with the body conduct
[1:01:52] the sample when you feel directly called
[1:01:54] but when that head my concert call and
[1:01:57] the body unite together is a call in
[1:02:00] your ensemble what will happen just give
[1:02:02] our revenge then they're full of power
[1:02:05] plenty the representative of the holy
[1:02:08] ghost the santa's friend will raise her
[1:02:11] vale level up just exactly like that
[1:02:14] exactly more and see even the dead a
[1:02:17] memory more than
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:01] as a town citizen the church has grown
[1:03:03] up the greaser country to this level as
[1:03:07] an evil end here ac without bodily love
[1:03:10] someone like moved down there whether
[1:03:12] you cannot cause
[1:03:14] without
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:42] we don't need a teaching
[1:03:45] permission
[1:03:46] we have for that yes no
[1:03:48] but
[1:03:49] we need the god of elijah of course
[1:03:53] the god who ends up by failure
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:10] god's word right regardless
[1:04:14] of jesus
[1:04:16] amen amen that's the dynamics
[1:04:20] you are
[1:04:21] you need to die
[1:04:23] your mechanic is what one mechanism
[1:04:27] without a dynamic
[1:04:29] you cannot go in there
[1:04:32] with all your religions
[1:04:34] look at where you are
[1:04:36] you are with a good religion
[1:04:38] long sleeve for much longer but your
[1:04:40] thoughts
[1:04:41] responsible but your thoughts may have
[1:04:43] upon say how do you what do you think
[1:04:45] the quote-unquote always evil jolly malo
[1:04:49] evil thought the more responsible you
[1:04:51] are quiet was it conclusive you don't

[1:05:30] group of people yes that's true

[1:10:36] solar america we try to brag our
[1:10:38] mechanics
[1:10:40] [Music]
[1:11:08] we need to see the god of fire
