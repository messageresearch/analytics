[1:00:13] 18 uh I would like also to read and
[1:00:16] there's a translation that I like but
[1:00:18] let's start with the King James
[1:00:22] version King James who against hope
[1:00:25] believed in hope that they might become
[1:00:28] the father of many nations according to
[1:00:31] that which was spoken so shall
[1:00:46] that uh the version that I was talking
[1:00:49] about uh it's the passion translation uh
[1:00:52] it
[1:00:53] says it says against whole OD when
[1:00:58] looked hopeless Abraham believed the
[1:01:01] promise and expected God to fulfill it
[1:01:05] he he took God at his word as a result
[1:01:09] he became the fathers of the father of
[1:01:11] many nations God's declaration over him
[1:01:14] came to pass
[1:01:17] amen uh you may be
[1:01:24] seated are you happy to be back in the
[1:01:26] house of
[1:01:28] God um I just I like to remind you few
[1:01:32] announcement that we uh that was done
[1:01:34] last
[1:01:36] Sunday there will be a church service on
[1:01:39] Friday
[1:01:44] 25th on
[1:01:46] Friday evening uh at the evening usually
[1:01:50] 6:50 p.m. something like
[1:01:53] that so the the pastor is asking us to
[1:01:56] make a necessary adjustment to attend
[1:01:58] the
[1:02:02] service and also uh brother Matthew got
[1:02:05] married on
[1:02:09] Friday we would like to send our best
[1:02:11] wishes and
[1:02:14] blessings uh we stream the the blessings
[1:02:17] the wedding it was wonderful and a
[1:02:21] beautiful
[1:02:22] ceremony and uh we thank God for the the
[1:02:25] brothers that went to support him
[1:02:29] there and I believe we were well
[1:02:33] represented and we pray that God will
[1:02:36] bring them
[1:02:40] safe amen amen uh just to clean some
[1:02:44] hair and turn around check someone's
[1:02:46] hand I feel like there's a lot of
[1:02:49] tension in the air right
[1:02:51] now amen God bless you brother bless you
[1:02:54] brother God bless you my sister
[1:02:57] feel free in the presence of God
[1:02:59] Amen the Bible says where the spirit of
[1:03:02] God
[1:03:04] is there is
[1:03:06] liberty so feel
[1:03:08] free this morning I'm going to be
[1:03:10] preaching with
[1:03:12] you amen amen because the prophet says
[1:03:15] the people that the one
[1:03:18] pulling amen amen so that's why I say
[1:03:21] feel
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:23] free there's one story I remember in s
[1:03:26] Africa there was one brother used to be
[1:03:29] very active in the
[1:03:31] church he would say Amen to the
[1:03:34] word he was responding to the word but
[1:03:37] that day he came along with his wife and
[1:03:41] the wife told him don't embarrass me
[1:03:46] today don't embarrass me today I want
[1:03:49] you to keep
[1:03:50] quiet don't be yelling don't be shouting
[1:03:55] since the brother was not
[1:03:58] working it was not working and the the
[1:04:01] wife was
[1:04:04] working the brother came to
[1:04:06] church he was listening to the word the
[1:04:09] pastor noticed that the brother that day
[1:04:11] was
[1:04:13] quiet the pastor was what's going
[1:04:17] on okay as the preach preaching was
[1:04:20] going
[1:04:21] on the Golden Nugget was kept on coming
[1:04:28] and the brother couldn't hold
[1:04:31] himself the wife told him
[1:04:34] first if you embarrass me today I'm
[1:04:37] going to take your
[1:04:39] shoes and then the brother since he
[1:04:42] couldn't hold
[1:04:43] himself he stood up he said shoes or no
[1:04:47] shoes that's the
[1:04:50] truth morning shoes or no shoes you
[1:04:54] respond to the word
[1:04:56] money or no
[1:04:58] money you will respond to the
[1:05:01] word praise God Amen Hallelujah am
[1:05:04] that's why we're so happy to be back in
[1:05:06] the house of the
[1:05:07] Lord because when you say Amen it's not
[1:05:10] to flatter the minister
[1:05:13] ego no no you're just reinforcing our
[1:05:16] camp because we only have
[1:05:19] two we we have the army of the Living
[1:05:22] God and we have the army of the devil
[1:05:26] so when you
[1:05:27] responding you're just enforcing your
[1:05:30] Camp just enforcing your side you
[1:05:33] telling the preacher let's finish the
[1:05:37] deviling it let's finish him
[1:05:41] today so if you're staying quiet I don't
[1:05:44] know what side you
[1:05:47] on amen amen just bring it
[1:05:51] on we thank the pastor for such an order
[1:05:56] for for giving us this opportunity to
[1:05:58] stand before
[1:05:59] you and um I'm kind of like the
[1:06:08] sa you know uh you know the sub they
[1:06:10] only put the sub at the end of the game
[1:06:15] right who is Brother
[1:06:18] Joshua is's my
[1:06:20] athlete so you put you put the sub at
[1:06:22] the end at the end of the game because
[1:06:25] the game is about to
[1:06:28] end the first you pull like the
[1:06:32] starters they make sure to win the
[1:06:37] game because you're putting your best
[1:06:40] players amen amen so they started the St
[1:06:43] just come at the
[1:06:48] end the the sub comes at the
[1:06:52] end and then uh to just to you know just

[1:06:58] status they've been playing well they've
[1:07:00] been playing for a long
[1:07:02] time and then they want to rest
[1:07:05] them and the Holy Ghost through the
[1:07:09] pastor allow us to be at the
[1:07:12] end so we're just hopping we're just
[1:07:14] like a spray
[1:07:17] Tire you know as a sub if you messed up
[1:07:22] since the game at the end we're not
[1:07:24] going to lose the game anyway
[1:07:27] we're not going to lose anyway you know
[1:07:29] why even if it happens I lost the I lose
[1:07:32] I lose the
[1:07:33] ball and then the
[1:07:35] enemy they about to
[1:07:38] score have the referee on our
[1:07:42] camp we have the referee on our
[1:07:46] camp just when the enemy wants to
[1:07:49] score the ref will stop the
[1:07:52] game so anyway we know how the story
[1:07:56] hand will not lose this battle we will
[1:08:00] not lose this game regardless of what

[1:08:20] drummer the way I watch my
[1:08:22] drummer I like to see the end of it
[1:08:26] to see how it's going to
[1:08:28] end then I can start from the beginning
[1:08:31] if I know it's ending it's now ending
[1:08:33] well I'm not going to watch it I don't

[1:08:57] anyway no matter comes your way your
[1:09:00] sickness actually is
[1:09:03] temporary you going to be healed that's
[1:09:06] the end of the
[1:09:07] story it will not be
[1:09:10] Eternal it will never be
[1:09:12] Eternal praise God amen amen amen let's
[1:09:17] go to our uh preaching today if I keep
[1:09:21] talking I might not
[1:09:23] preach amen amen so today I was going to
[1:09:28] talk about just I will try also to be
[1:09:30] sure today
[1:09:32] again was so happy last Wednesday
[1:09:35] because I was extremely
[1:09:38] short I will try to keep short
[1:09:41] today so today I I entitled my topic my
[1:09:46] sermon Against All
[1:09:49] Odds Against All
[1:09:53] Odds what is the odds
[1:09:56] the odds it's the
[1:09:59] probability or How likely it
[1:10:03] is a particular thing will or will not
[1:10:09] happen the chance of the or the
[1:10:12] possibility of something or the
[1:10:17] impossibility or or when you says the
[1:10:20] ODS are in someone's
[1:10:23] favor you mean uh the they are likely to
[1:10:27] succeed they are likely to succeed in
[1:10:30] what they
[1:10:33] doing in
[1:10:36] sport it mean when you say that the old
[1:10:38] are in favor of that
[1:10:41] team they usually base the ODS on
[1:10:46] fact based on the
[1:10:49] strength the way they
[1:10:51] play the strength and the weakness
[1:10:56] techniques the
[1:10:58] coach they probably have the best player
[1:11:00] in the
[1:11:01] team therefore they have more chance to
[1:11:05] win are in the
[1:11:10] favor on
[1:11:13] fact like when the United State went to
[1:11:15] the Olympic
[1:11:18] game the basketball team had the best
[1:11:21] players
[1:11:27] they have Sten Curry all the best
[1:11:30] players in the team so the St statistic
[1:11:34] were
[1:11:35] showing they will win the gold the
[1:11:38] golden
[1:11:39] medal so it's based on
[1:11:42] fact scientific
[1:11:44] fact or when also you say the ODS are
[1:11:46] against
[1:11:48] you simply means they unlikely to
[1:11:53] succeed they don't have many chance
[1:11:56] it's based on fact it's based on medical
[1:12:01] reports it's based on
[1:12:03] history it's based on
[1:12:05] science
[1:12:07] experience amen amen so they are less
[1:12:10] likely to
[1:12:12] succeed legally so if they say the odds
[1:12:16] against you
[1:12:18] legally so you're you're less likely to
[1:12:21] to win that
[1:12:23] case I'm trying to be place the
[1:12:26] foundation to explain what is the
[1:12:29] art if they say you going to the Arts
[1:12:32] against you
[1:12:34] legally you will be IND
[1:12:37] inducted you'll be
[1:12:39] condemned based on
[1:12:41] evidence based on evidence you
[1:12:44] stole or you cheated you lied you did
[1:12:48] this and you are destined to to
[1:12:52] jail all the against you
[1:12:55] I don't know if you remember this hisory
[1:12:57] the story Brother Richard uh told us
[1:12:59] last
[1:13:01] Sunday about brother with his Pastor so
[1:13:05] all the evidence
[1:13:06] shown that he was guilty there was a
[1:13:10] video to prove
[1:13:12] it they had a strong K against
[1:13:16] him and tonight I want to tell
[1:13:18] you God loves when the odds are against
[1:13:23] you when all the odds are against
[1:13:26] you when all the medical reports are
[1:13:29] against
[1:13:32] you when all the
[1:13:34] doctors says it's
[1:13:37] done is an expert when it comes to
[1:13:39] Impossible
[1:13:42] cases with the expert when it comes to
[1:13:45] Impossible
[1:13:47] cases it's the god of impossible
[1:13:50] situation he likes when the odds are
[1:13:52] against you
[1:13:55] Abraham the prophet says let's read
[1:13:58] it in the book The Message
[1:14:01] identification of Christ in all the
[1:14:04] identification of Christ in all
[1:14:06] ages paragra
[1:14:09] 91 the prophet
[1:14:11] Abraham he was persuaded that God was
[1:14:14] able to keep anything that he
[1:14:18] promised called anything contrary to the
[1:14:23] word wasn't
[1:14:26] he just went on on just the
[1:14:29] same against
[1:14:32] scientific the scientific
[1:14:34] proofs against
[1:14:36] reasons against
[1:14:39] hope against all the
[1:14:42] OD against everything there
[1:14:46] was against all the
[1:14:50] ODS God words came
[1:14:53] first Abraham said
[1:14:56] let everything else be
[1:14:58] wrong he was going to have the
[1:15:02] baby and he had it see because he
[1:15:05] believed
[1:15:06] it so imagine an old
[1:15:10] man 100 years old with a 80 years old
[1:15:15] wife waiting expecting to have a
[1:15:18] baby it's
[1:15:20] insane it's even to think about shocking
[1:15:25] you having imagine old man 100 years old
[1:15:30] he can barely
[1:15:32] walk expecting to have a
[1:15:34] baby all the odds were piling against
[1:15:38] him first of all the prophet says they
[1:15:41] couldn't even have pleasure
[1:15:44] together even if they had
[1:15:46] pleasure abam lost all his
[1:15:51] manhood Sarah was too whole
[1:15:55] handle giving
[1:15:58] birth I've been in a delivery
[1:16:02] room H it's it's
[1:16:04] unbearable you know uh excuse me but I
[1:16:07] think we should congratulate our we
[1:16:09] should respect and congratulate our
[1:16:12] mothers because that's a painful things
[1:16:14] to
[1:16:16] see I don't want to talk about my wife
[1:16:18] because she made a whole
[1:16:20] scene because I'm going to be in trouble
[1:16:22] if I talk about
[1:16:23] her but it's veryable to see that but
[1:16:27] imagine old old old
[1:16:31] woman going through
[1:16:34] that that was going to be
[1:16:37] impossible she didn't even have milk to
[1:16:39] breastfeed the
[1:16:41] baby back in the day they didn't have
[1:16:43] formula all the odds was against
[1:16:47] Abraham the Bible says Abraham
[1:16:49] considered not his body as being
[1:16:52] dead his own body was
[1:16:56] dead but Abraham still
[1:16:59] believed just think of it but he said as
[1:17:02] long as God promised
[1:17:04] it he will do it it doesn't matter how
[1:17:08] long it
[1:17:09] takes a matter of
[1:17:12] fact the longer it takes the great is
[1:17:16] the
[1:17:17] Miracles the longer it takes the greater
[1:17:20] will be the miracle then they went to
[1:17:23] start buying clothes for the baby
[1:17:27] diapers the doctor could have said this
[1:17:30] old men SN like they said
[1:17:34] today he lost his mind snapped his age
[1:17:38] is going to buy diapers what is he
[1:17:41] waiting
[1:17:42] for but as long as God said it I don't I
[1:17:46] don't have to
[1:17:47] reason I don't have to question it I
[1:17:51] don't have to go to school to question
[1:17:53] it I just believe the way it
[1:17:56] is crazy as it can sound I just believe
[1:18:00] it that
[1:18:02] way all
[1:18:04] the Abraham received the
[1:18:07] son God loves to beat
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:11] the god lovees to beat the
[1:18:15] ODS I want to tell somebody tonight no
[1:18:18] matter what the science said like I said
[1:18:21] on Wednesday no matter what the city
[1:18:24] said
[1:18:25] no matter what the scanner says no
[1:18:28] matter all the specialist of the world
[1:18:31] says as long as God said
[1:18:34] it
[1:18:36] it that can beat all the
[1:18:39] ODS amen the evidence can be against
[1:18:44] you every eye witness is against
[1:18:47] you it is impossible to win that
[1:18:51] case you don't even have a chance
[1:18:55] everything seems
[1:18:57] impossible even in your own conscience
[1:19:00] your own conscience condemns you you
[1:19:03] know you are
[1:19:04] guilty you have no argument to
[1:19:08] attack done you have to just to plead
[1:19:12] guilty go to hell go to the
[1:19:15] jail that's the case God loves to take
[1:19:19] he's the best lawyer he likes to take
[1:19:22] that kind of
[1:19:23] case amen he's the only
[1:19:26] lawyer who has 100% winning
[1:19:31] case he never lost a
[1:19:33] case you never lost a case if it stand

[1:29:30] trouble because very
[1:29:33] present in a time of trouble amen amen
[1:29:38] oh let's go to our
[1:29:39] story let's our story and then we're
[1:29:41] going to
[1:29:42] close and as we read the Bible talked
[1:29:45] about
[1:29:48] Shamar the Bible says in the days of
[1:29:51] Shamar the son of an
[1:29:55] in the days of
[1:29:56] jail judges 5:
[1:30:00] 6 the highways were
[1:30:04] abandoned Travelers took the winding
[1:30:09] path villages in Israel would not
[1:30:15] fight they held
[1:30:18] back that was a terrible time for
[1:30:21] Israel the first thing with the Enemy
[1:30:23] when he come in in the
[1:30:25] country he destroy the the
[1:30:29] highways he destroy the ways because
[1:30:32] he's making
[1:30:33] sure after destroying
[1:30:36] you after the land cannot follow him you
[1:30:40] cannot be after him so he's destroying
[1:30:43] the land the ways he's destroying all
[1:30:46] the ways all the roads just to make sure
[1:30:50] you're not coming after
[1:30:52] him and then Israel
[1:30:54] they were taking the winding
[1:30:58] path yeah the winding path is a long
[1:31:02] way and on the way you can meet TGs you
[1:31:05] can meet
[1:31:08] criminals because they couldn't take the
[1:31:10] highways the highs
[1:31:13] destroy because of their sin because the
[1:31:15] Bible says in
[1:31:17] judges because there was no King no
[1:31:20] Prophet everybody was doing what pleases
[1:31:23] him
[1:31:25] what it was good in their
[1:31:27] eyes they had to take a winding path we
[1:31:31] know in the message we know as a
[1:31:33] Christian we know ways to do it we know
[1:31:36] how to get married like I said under no
[1:31:39] circumstance we know how to behave we
[1:31:43] know the prophet told us how to behave
[1:31:46] is we don't drink in Israel we don't
[1:31:49] drink we don't drink in Israel we don't
[1:31:52] smoke we don't
[1:31:55] Sho that's the
[1:31:57] way but what Israel was doing they were
[1:32:01] taking the winning
[1:32:02] path they couldn't take the way God
[1:32:05] provided in Israel we have a prophet we
[1:32:09] all obey the
[1:32:11] prophets the of
[1:32:14] God taking the the
[1:32:18] winding the the Bible says The Villages
[1:32:21] could not fight
[1:32:24] taking the winding
[1:32:25] path what have we done with the message
[1:32:29] today as as as young
[1:32:33] people or we uh we don't have any
[1:32:36] boundaries we remove our boundaries we
[1:32:38] don't have any boundaries everything is
[1:32:40] questionable
[1:32:43] now
[1:32:47] we respecting the
[1:32:50] adults
[1:32:52] respect even respect the adults not even
[1:32:56] talk about men of
[1:32:58] God today just see as young people
[1:33:00] talking about his
[1:33:02] Pastor can be ashamed of
[1:33:05] your his father
[1:33:07] mother or you should be ashamed of
[1:33:11] yourself respect at
[1:33:13] all what have we done with the
[1:33:15] message I remember back in the
[1:33:18] days when we were still kid they used to
[1:33:20] say I used to hear people saying the
[1:33:24] message they love the pastor the way
[1:33:27] they love the
[1:33:28] pastor am done today today loving the
[1:33:32] past if you talk about loving the past
[1:33:34] in the church
[1:33:35] everybody everybody's looking it's like
[1:33:39] to say they love the
[1:33:40] pastor what have we done with the
[1:33:44] message we lost our boundaries coming to

[1:57:53] believe in yourself if you don't believe
[1:57:57] in
[1:57:57] yourself there's no
[1:58:00] Rapture because the prophet says the day
[1:58:04] the bride will recognize who she is the
[1:58:08] rapture will take place so as long as
[1:58:11] you don't know who you are no
[1:58:14] Rapture amen once you believe that
[1:58:17] regardless of the numbers of
[1:58:19] philistine don't care what comes up
[1:58:23] you know today there might be people
[1:58:26] that can look at
[1:58:27] you and
[1:58:29] think that you are not a child of
[1:58:32] God they think you're not a child of God
[1:58:36] that's your own
[1:58:37] judgment that's not God
[1:58:40] judgment that's not God
[1:58:42] judgment who can
[1:58:44] believe who can believe a serious
[1:58:49] Jew serious Israelite
[1:58:52] look at the thief at the
[1:58:56] cross and call him a
[1:58:59] saint
[1:59:00] imagine that man will be in a
[1:59:04] paradise hallelu he never went to
[1:59:07] church he never went to
[1:59:10] church all his life he was robbing
[1:59:14] people not just robbing he was killing
[1:59:18] people he probably killed one of his
[1:59:21] family member
[1:59:23] who could believe a
[1:59:25] serious who could believe a serious
[1:59:27] person could believe that of
[1:59:31] God it doesn't matter what people
[1:59:35] think that's their own
[1:59:37] judgment I don't care what they think
[1:59:40] let me give you another example who
[1:59:42] could
[1:59:43] believe RAB The Prostitute prostit The
[1:59:48] Prostitute prostit the prostitute
[1:59:51] prostit daughter of
[1:59:53] God who could believe
[1:59:57] that nobody could believe that a person
[2:00:00] with a white
[2:00:03] mind could never believe
[2:00:06] that a prostitute on the
[2:00:09] street making her money out of
[2:00:13] prostitution could never believed
[2:00:15] that but he was a Son of God that's why
[2:00:19] I said believe in yourself
[2:00:22] it doesn't matter what people
[2:00:25] think who could
[2:00:27] believe Hallelujah it doesn't matter

[2:00:36] you you said how do I know I'm a Son of
[2:00:39] God how do I know I'm a Son of God the
[2:00:43] Bible says the Bible says the light came

[2:00:57] light he has given them the
[2:01:00] power to become sons of
[2:01:04] God once you receive this life the
