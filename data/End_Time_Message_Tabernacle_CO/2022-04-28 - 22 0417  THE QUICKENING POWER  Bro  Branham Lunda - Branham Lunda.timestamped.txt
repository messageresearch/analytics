[16:34] shocking start and every time
[16:37] that the doors are open
[16:40] and you available
[16:42] don't give the devil the chance
[16:46] let's come to listen to the word amen
[16:48] amen

[16:57] oh death
[16:58] death ways today i said that's uh
[17:31] a true christian faith
[17:34] it's not the new year's feast
[17:41] yeah well you see people on january 1st
[17:44] no those are pagan
[17:57] is
[18:28] something i'd like to come back on
[18:30] something brother martin is spoken about
[18:33] may god bless
[18:35] [Applause]
[18:54] uh
[19:08] he was really wonderful amen amen
[19:12] [Music]
[19:16] but don't get used to the ministry or to
[19:18] somebody
[19:21] but take profit of what god has
[19:36] when you spoke about the preparation and
[19:38] the qualifying lamb
[19:41] jesus christ the lamb that was jesus
[19:43] christ
[19:46] i like to speak slowly but together
[19:48] i'll interpret
[19:53] to help the interpreter so that people
[19:55] who only understand english can also
[19:57] learn quickly
[20:00] you showed us that the land had to
[20:01] qualify
[20:04] and make us notice
[20:08] that we are also learning
[20:12] and god wants us to be learned
[20:16] and god wants us also to qualify
[20:29] he could get married but he didn't do it
[20:45] he didn't even have a house
[21:15] i believe that everything that is
[21:16] beautiful comes from the devil eh jesus
[21:19] and jesus christ says sanctified
[21:22] sanctifying himself
[21:25] for our interests
[21:27] for your interest
[21:29] that's what qualified him
[21:32] [Applause]
[21:34] god wants us also to qualify
[21:39] what this calvary meant to us
[21:51] therefore we want to have faith in what
[21:53] we're doing
[21:56] therefore christ going to calvary
[22:03] there will be three things that we have
[22:05] to look on there on calvary
[22:08] what calvary meant to us a
[22:15] and what we have to do after
[22:17] understanding what calvary meant to us
[22:22] and i won't take too much time otherwise
[22:24] it's
[22:25] be from the subject but i want us to
[22:27] notice
[22:30] what calvary is signified for us
[22:35] that has freed us from sin amen amen
[22:40] regardless of decision
[22:43] regardless of what you've done yes
[22:47] but freeze you la foreign the way is
[22:50] open
[22:52] they played
[23:07] if you're still condemning yourself
[23:09] always and all
[23:10] right there's two things there and first
[23:15] probably you condemning yourself
[23:19] because you have not repented
[23:33] and he will bring you to condemnation
[23:36] but if you uh straighten it up
[23:41] and you see the devil still bringing
[23:42] that to your mind
[23:44] but maybe if the brother is on the other
[23:46] side
[23:48] oh what do
[24:02] he
[24:16] you are
[24:20] [Music]
[24:33] and you to help me preach only it's only
[24:35] to say amen if it's the word amen amen
[24:41] and that's what calvary has done for us
[24:44] say to your brother i have no sin
[24:46] brother
[24:48] i have no sin
[24:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[24:57] second jeffy what
[25:01] i know that i'm conscious that i've done
[25:03] wrongs
[25:05] but i'll repent amen amen
[25:10] and repentance
[25:40] that it is the son of god
[25:44] but if you see somebody
[25:46] say completely
[25:48] repenting in the very complicated ways
[25:53] you were committed adultery
[26:30] therefore respect somebody that
[26:31] represents yourself it's not a weakness
[26:34] say some people are previously that's
[26:36] even the proof that he's the son he or
[26:37] she is the son of god
[26:40] but that thing has disappeared among the
[26:42] christians
[26:43] may god help us
[26:47] therefore we have to know that that day
[26:48] on calvary
[26:50] that
[27:04] because he
[28:01] [Applause]
[28:14] don't think that if you suffer
[28:17] france
[28:18] that you think that your my suffering is
[28:20] uh greater than the other one
[28:23] if you're really a christian do your
[28:25] secret you do have one conflict god
[28:27] knows that you have to have a call
[28:28] hallelujah amen
[28:32] and if the sufferings that you have
[28:35] if the condition that you have
[28:37] [Applause]
[28:38] the test that god is putting there um
[28:55] i think that i'm just going to leave the
[28:57] church
[28:59] oh i'm i'm leaving the message i'm going
[29:01] back to the catholics
[29:04] that shows that you're not a christian
[29:06] christ christ
[29:09] taking your place and
[29:13] [Applause]
[29:24] even the disciple that he loved him much
[29:26] john
[29:27] oh he was always leaning on his uh
[29:30] at that moment
[29:32] he was not there
[29:34] peter was saying
[29:35] no perspective
[29:38] if
[29:39] [Applause]
[29:52] forsake you what about even your friend
[29:54] has to forsake you
[29:57] and you have to say
[29:59] this is my calvary
[30:02] okay
[30:03] may somebody say amen
[30:06] fred brother
[30:33] probably we don't know how long we shall
[30:35] live
[30:39] if we never understood easter in the
[30:41] good way
[30:43] let it be this year let's get down the
[30:45] mountain
[30:48] to understand
[31:00] god is not going to take away the
[31:02] deceptive disappointment
[31:14] [Applause]
[31:30] and
[31:43] he has the
[31:44] solution let's unfold the bread mass the
[31:47] evil children were walking but it's a
[31:50] process while they were coming getting
[31:51] closer
[31:53] and fire was even getting bigger
[31:57] left breath
[31:59] and the either the trial becomes even
[32:01] greater deeply you pray deeply you pray
[32:04] you fast
[32:05] you pray
[32:08] but the situation only gets worse
[32:10] the devil comes
[32:12] you see god doesn't love you
[32:14] you see the other one has left you
[32:18] now that one was promising you might he
[32:20] didn't give him
[32:21] god allows those kinds
[32:23] may somebody say amen
[32:25] but don't forget
[32:27] que abra that abraham have ffa vincent
[32:30] you spent 25 years
[32:34] and probably your your trial has only
[32:36] taken two years
[32:37] probably just three years but first
[32:40] or probably it's just a month
[32:43] you had faith now but you're for sure
[32:46] and you started changing prayers
[32:49] but god is testing you
[32:51] when shadrach was working please
[32:54] demo he was walking
[33:08] and sometimes god likes to do those
[33:10] things
[33:11] you really get to the end
[33:14] he wanted to see it continue
[33:18] if you will keep on believing just the
[33:20] same as it from the beginning hallelujah
[33:39] [Music]
[33:59] [Applause]
[34:12] [Applause]
[34:24] [Applause]
[34:43] we need to each one of us have their own
[34:45] cavalry hello
[35:00] [Applause]
[35:57] jesus never lives for himself
[36:01] his life was spent for others
[36:06] that's perfectly eternal life
[36:11] when you say that you're good you go to
[36:12] church
[36:15] and you do go do things
[36:17] that's fine
[36:23] but when you leave your life to yourself
[36:29] you haven't eternal life
[36:33] you follow
[36:35] me if you go to church
[36:38] you do good deeds they're bonnie shows
[36:40] good things
[36:41] it's good
[36:45] but when if when you live your life to
[36:48] yourself
[36:50] you don't have eternal life
[36:58] that's the reason why he went to calvary
[37:00] it's a situation
[37:02] and this has to change our lives amen
[37:04] amen seed yes and if
[37:20] and you receive
[37:27] and you don't live for yourself no more
[37:30] you live for others
[37:32] sorry
[37:34] someone
[38:01] see people that have to come to church
[38:04] all those things
[38:06] when you go to calvary
[38:08] you start considering your brother
[38:11] and you give him more value
[38:14] you don't criticize him
[38:16] you just try to encourage him amen
[38:23] you don't live for yourself
[38:26] you live for others
[38:28] listen carefully my friends vive poor
[38:46] and the trouble of it is the church has
[38:48] forgotten
[38:49] escalation are people sleeping
[38:52] the thing is that the church has
[38:55] forgotten
[38:56] what have we forgotten
[39:13] remember mistakes
[39:21] the devil has traded us
[39:25] in this easter comedy
[39:40] is to revive something that is already
[39:42] in you yes
[39:45] and that has to bring me so much love
[39:47] amen amen

[3:07:25] creating opportunity as they are filling
[3:07:27] up the baptism
