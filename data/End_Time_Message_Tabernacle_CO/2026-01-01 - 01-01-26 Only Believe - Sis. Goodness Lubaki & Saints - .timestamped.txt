[0:18] Sometimes [singing and music]
[0:19] we pray,
[0:21] "Father, let [music] this cup pass from
[0:26] me.
[0:30] But [singing] now we cry out
[0:33] just once more [music] Lord
[0:36] on bended [singing] knees.
[0:42] Lord [singing] we see just [music] one
[0:44] touch of the hem of your [singing]
[0:47] garment.
[0:49] It brought [music] change
[0:52] and full deliverance.
[0:55] So I'm [singing] casting off the air,
[0:58] but [music] there's power in prayer.
[1:00] [singing]
[1:01] Only believe.
[1:07] Only believe. [singing]
[1:10] [music] You'll let nothing stand in
[1:14] [singing] your way.
[1:20] All issues of blood, [singing and music]
[1:22] all troubles and confusion
[1:26] will have [singing and music] to go back
[1:28] through
[1:30] hell's gates.
[1:35] You [singing and music] put your feet on
[1:38] the necks of these kings
[1:41] [music] and look [singing] to the
[1:43] bleeding lamb that was slain.
[1:47] and only believe. [singing]
[1:50] [music] Just trust and confess it and
[1:54] you'll [singing] receive.
[1:56] [music]
[2:00] Our prophets long,
[2:03] saints, [singing and music]
[2:04] we long
[2:06] to see that seventh above.
[2:11] Lord, now we [singing and music] long
[2:16] for you to come [singing] fill us now.
[2:23] [music]
[2:25] Sweet Holy Spirit,
[2:29] sweet [singing]
[2:31] heavenly [music] dove,
[2:35] root over
[2:38] us. Lord, [music and singing]
[2:40] find your resting place
[2:43] in our hearts. [music]
[2:48] And we only believe [singing]
[2:52] you let nothing stand in
[2:56] [music and singing] our way.
[3:01] All [music and singing] issues, the
[3:02] blood, all troubles and confusion
[3:07] will have to go back [singing and music]
[3:09] through
[3:11] hell gates.
[3:16] We put your [music and singing] feet on
[3:19] and answer these gates.
[3:21] [singing and music] We look to the
[3:23] bleeding lamb that was slain and only
[3:28] [singing] believe.
[3:31] Just trust [music] and confess it and
[3:34] will receive. [music]
[3:38] The Lord
[3:41] is my rock, [singing] my light and
[3:43] salvation.
[3:45] In him I [music] believe
[3:49] and
[3:51] by [singing] his blood I rebuke all
[3:56] lying vanities
[4:03] for host shouldn't camp against me
[4:09] to release fear
[4:11] and insecurities
[4:14] Yet I stand confident, Lord, that you
[4:18] will [music and singing] keep
[4:20] and deliver me.
[4:25] Oh Lord, may I only believe
[4:29] you let nothing [singing] stand in
[4:33] our way.
[4:38] All issues of blood, all troubles and
[4:42] [music] confusion.
[4:44] Who have to go back through
[4:48] hell?
[4:52] Who will put your feet
[4:54] [singing and music]
[4:55] on and answer these things?
[4:58] We look to the [singing and music]
[5:00] bleeding limb that was laid and we only
[5:05] believe.
[5:07] Just trust and confess it [music]
[5:10] and you'll [singing] receive.
[5:15] The dove is saying shalom,
[5:18] shalom, [singing] shalom,
[5:22] [music]
[5:23] peace [singing] be unto you. Troubles
[5:27] all are over.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Shalom. Shalom.

[5:35] On [music] the wings of that seven
[5:37] [singing] dove. I hear her hear him
[5:40] saying [music] shalom. Shalom. [singing]
[5:43] Shalom.
[5:47] Peace be unto [singing and music]
[5:50] you.
[5:52] New year.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Shalom. Shalom. [singing]
[5:55] Shalom.
[5:58] On [music] the wings of the [singing]
[6:01] seventh,
[6:02] I hear him [music] saying,
[6:04] &gt;&gt; "Shalom,
[6:06] shalom, shalom.
[6:10] [music]
[6:11] Peace be unto [singing]
[6:13] you." Troubles all are over.

[6:22] On the wings [singing]
[6:23] of that seven.
[6:26] On the wings.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; On [music and singing] the wings of that
[6:30] seven.
[6:32] On the wings. On [singing and music] the
[6:34] wings.
