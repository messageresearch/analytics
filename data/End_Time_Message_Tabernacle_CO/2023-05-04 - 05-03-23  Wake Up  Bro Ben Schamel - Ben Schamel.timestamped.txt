[33:41] we got our Sunday in already
[33:45] and now we've got Wednesday
[33:48] [Music]
[33:50] yeah
[33:52] these scriptures will go ahead and jump
[33:53] right into the word this evening
[33:58] we'll try not to be long tonight I know
[34:01] everybody is tired from the week
[34:07] and we're just happy to be with you
[34:09] again
[34:11] on a Wednesday
[34:15] you would turn over we'll read a
[34:16] familiar scripture Matthew 25.
[34:22] we'll read verses one through ten
[34:25] we'll see
[34:27] and then we'll flip over to first
[34:29] Thessalonians 4 13.
[34:34] and we'll read 13 through 16. okay says
[34:41] the Bible reads like this in Matthew
[34:45] says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[34:47] likened to ten likened and attend
[34:49] virgins which took their lamps and went
[34:52] forth to meet the bridegroom
[34:54] this is
[35:00] five of them are wise and five were
[35:02] foolish is
[35:07] they that were foolish took their lamps
[35:10] and took no oil with them
[35:15] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[35:18] with their lamps
[35:24] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[35:26] slumbered and slept
[35:32] and at midnight there was a cry made
[35:35] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[35:37] to meet him
[35:42] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[35:45] their lamps
[35:46] lump
[35:51] and the foolish she said into the wise
[35:53] give us of your oil for our lamps have
[35:55] gone out
[36:00] but the wise answered saying not so less
[36:03] rather last
[36:05] there be not enough for us and you but
[36:08] go you rather to them that sell and buy
[36:11] for yourselves
[36:24] and while they went to buy the
[36:25] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[36:27] went with him into the marriage and the
[36:30] door was shut up
[36:38] and then we'll flip over to first
[36:39] Thessalonians chapter four
[36:44] and verse 13 verses
[36:49] and Paul says to the Thessalonians
[36:52] he says but I would not have you to be
[36:55] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[36:57] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[36:59] others which have no hope
[37:10] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[37:13] rose again even so them also which sleep
[37:15] in Jesus will God bring forth with him
[37:26] for this we say unto you by the word of
[37:29] the Lord that we which are alive and
[37:31] remain into the coming of the Lord shall
[37:33] not prevent them which are asleep
[37:46] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[37:49] heaven with a shout with a voice of the
[37:52] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[37:54] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[37:56] Calise
[38:05] and let's just bow our heads
[38:08] dear gracious Heavenly Father
[38:10] Celeste Lord we just come before you yet
[38:13] once more Lord
[38:15] we're thankful for another opportunity
[38:17] to read your scriptures
[38:21] learning to have the revelation of this
[38:24] message
[38:25] Lord a prophet that came and made these
[38:28] things clear to us
[38:31] we're just so thankful for that
[38:33] we just ask that you would be with us
[38:35] this evening
[38:37] Lord please help me to get myself out of
[38:40] the way
[38:43] Lord that I might be able to get into
[38:45] the channel of the Holy Spirit
[38:49] wherever you want me to go Lord just
[38:51] lead me there
[38:54] you know the needs amongst the people
[38:56] this evening
[38:58] Lord I don't know what their need is
[39:03] Lord we've come to church not out of
[39:05] church foreign
[39:26] so if I could take from these scriptures
[39:28] a simple thought I don't understand
[39:33] and I can title it just wake up
[39:38] amen amen we know that we're tired
[39:41] sometimes
[39:43] I know for me when it's midnight I just
[39:46] want to sleep
[39:49] I sure like my sleep
[39:51] you work hard throughout the day
[39:54] and night comes you want to sleep
[39:58] but the point of tonight is don't be a
[40:01] heavy sleeper
[40:06] but if we could take what the scripture
[40:09] says in Thessalonians
[40:13] it says that the Lord shall descend
[40:17] with three things and we've recently I
[40:20] know you've recently gone through a lot
[40:22] of this with your pastor
[40:24] um
[40:25] because these things are talked about in
[40:28] the seals in great depths
[40:31] but the scripture says the Lord himself
[40:34] shall descend with a shout
[40:37] with the voice of the Archangel
[40:40] and with the Trump of God
[40:42] and we know that the uh shout is a
[40:46] message and we believe that that message
[40:48] has come
[40:50] there's many voices that we can listen
[40:52] to out in the world
[40:54] we talked about some of that on Sundays
[40:57] but there will become a shout first
[41:03] so what message are we listening to
[41:07] How do you know that the message is
[41:09] right
[41:16] but the Lord shall descend from heaven
[41:18] with a shout
[41:21] and then with the voice of the
[41:23] archangels and then with the Trump of
[41:26] God I got to thinking about this story
[41:29] of the the ten virgins
[41:33] and I began to wonder why is it
[41:35] important that they trim the lamps
[41:40] because we know today we just walk into
[41:43] a room
[41:46] we just flip the switch
[41:48] [Music]
[41:50] and there is light or there's Panic
[41:54] if you flip the switch and there's no
[41:57] light
[42:00] oh no what's going on
[42:03] but back in the day there was uh oil
[42:06] lamps
[42:09] and there's a wick that would go down
[42:11] into the vessel
[42:14] and it withdraw
[42:29] that's right without oil it's hard to
[42:32] get that lamp lit so um
[42:37] without the Holy Ghost in Church
[42:39] Charlotte
[42:41] sometimes it can be difficult to feel
[42:43] the fire of God
[42:46] if you're coming to church out of
[42:48] tradition
[42:49] then it seems like labor
[42:53] coming to church out of tradition
[42:56] then it can be hard to stay in awaken
[42:59] Church
[43:02] you have to put forth a lot of effort
[43:05] the services they seem really long
[43:10] but if you can ever get hold of that
[43:12] Holy Spirit
[43:14] it'll change your life
[43:17] that light won't be Smoky anymore
[43:21] but it'll become clearer
[43:27] you won't be walking in darkness
[43:32] but you'll be able to see where you're
[43:34] walking
[43:36] you will have revelation
[43:38] then it won't be confusing to read your
[43:41] Bible
[43:43] but through the Holy Ghost and this
[43:45] message
[43:48] you are entitled to understand what the
[43:51] scriptures are saying
[43:57] amen praise the Lord this message has
[44:00] brought a light to us
[44:03] it's a restoration of the holy spirit's
[44:07] life
[44:09] we know that the Holy Spirit light was
[44:12] with Moses
[44:14] the pillar of fire was with Moses
[44:17] and where the pillar of fire is great
[44:20] things happen
[44:23] yes sir with that Pillar of Fire leading
[44:26] the Israelites there was no sea that
[44:28] could stand in their way
[44:34] that light was with Joshua
[44:38] it would lead and guide them
[44:41] it didn't matter how big the Jericho
[44:43] walls were yeah
[44:46] but there is great power where that
[44:49] light is
[44:51] it doesn't matter your situation
[44:56] but if there's no Holy Ghost there to
[44:58] draw from I know
[45:01] then you're counting on your works
[45:08] you must have the Holy Ghost to draw
[45:10] from
[45:13] but it's very important that they
[45:15] trimmed their lamps
[45:19] because after a a lamp had burned
[45:24] there would be a dark uh soot on the
[45:29] wicked
[45:33] and it makes it very difficult to
[45:36] re-light the witch
[45:40] all of that
[45:46] it just gets in the way
[45:50] and if you could get that lamp lit
[45:55] it would be very smoky
[46:01] and it would either do one of two things
[46:04] it would either be so Smoky that the
[46:07] light would be very dim
[46:12] or it would burn so hot that it would be
[46:14] out of control
[46:19] so we see in a story that a messenger
[46:22] comes
[46:24] and he says get ready
[46:27] trim your lamps because when you trim
[46:31] your lamp
[46:32] then that light can shine to its
[46:35] brightest potential
[46:37] [Music]
[46:39] it can be a very clear light
[46:44] so you could see all that was in the
[46:46] room
[46:50] and that soot is just like our worldly
[46:52] things that we so often cling on
[46:54] the shoes I was listening to a message
[46:57] brother Brandon preached spiritual
[46:58] Amnesia
[47:01] and he was just preaching on how so many
[47:04] Christians get spiritual Amnesia yeah
[47:06] Amnesia
[47:09] we know who we are
[47:12] we know we are the brightest dishes we
[47:16] know Malachi foreign
[47:50] but I can find inspiration preaching to
[47:53] myself
[47:55] because I have found myself
[47:59] sitting in a message Pew I see it's
[48:02] growing up in the message
[48:06] knowing all the right things to say
[48:10] knowing all the phrases
[48:17] [Music]
[48:18] from the outside you would think I'm a
[48:20] good message believer
[48:24] but if we're not careful
[48:26] we get spiritual Amnesia
[48:30] and we forget the power that comes along
[48:32] with the message
[48:35] we forget the Holy Ghost Fire he comes
[48:38] alive
[48:40] we focus so much on the mechanics
[48:44] that we forget about the Dynamics
[48:48] you can have a Ferrari
[49:47] is to lead and guide you through the
[49:50] Darkest Days that's ever existed
[49:54] and get you from 0.1
[50:01] from this world to samonda to the
[50:04] Rapture and that's what we're looking
[50:06] for tonight
[50:09] so we see these these virgins are asleep
[50:13] brother random says that they were all
[50:16] virgins
[50:17] they were all Christians
[50:21] they were all message Believers
[50:26] and as they tarried they were waiting
[50:29] for the Rapture
[50:32] and they took their lamps which is their
[50:35] Works brother Brandon said
[50:38] [Music]
[50:39] and five of them took no oil
[50:44] and brother Branham tells us that the
[50:46] oil is the Holy Ghost
[50:51] just that story alone
[50:53] if brother Branham could just reveal
[50:56] that one story to us
[51:00] how great the message would be
[51:03] let alone all the Mysteries that are
[51:06] contained in the scriptures
[51:10] all of them have been revealed
[51:14] but sometimes we find it's hard to to
[51:16] study
[51:19] it's hard to read our Bibles and prayers
[51:23] I'm asking you Church what is missing
[51:27] we know we're getting close to the
[51:29] Raptors so what is missing where's the
[51:32] urgency
[51:33] if we have the Holy Spirit fire burning
[51:36] inside of us
[51:38] then we're going to want everyone else
[51:40] to have the same oil
[51:43] never be ashamed of this message
[51:47] there's people in the denominations
[51:49] reading these scriptures
[52:12] but we can see that it is a book of
[52:15] Revelation and not a book of mysteries
[52:20] if the Methodist could see that
[52:23] boy they'd be shouting
[52:31] required
[53:20] amen
[53:23] that light
[53:25] amen has been missing for hundreds of
[53:28] years
[53:33] hundreds and hundreds of years
[53:37] and this age don't say tired
[53:42] what a blessed people we are if we could
[53:45] just grasp that I'm living in the Holy
[53:49] Ghost age
[53:52] we look at Jesus Christ brother Branham
[53:56] was when
[53:58] God and man came together
[54:05] Jesus Christ was the merging
[54:09] of humanity and divinity
[54:18] you know where I'm going
[54:20] um
[54:21] human and then up in the upper room
[54:26] the same thing happened
[54:29] because at the crucifixion that veil was
[54:32] renting too but
[54:33] crucifixion
[54:35] said that there was a badger skin Veil
[54:43] that the presence
[54:47] and he says in this day there's another
[54:50] fleshly Veil
[54:53] that's the presence of God is hiding
[54:56] behind
[54:57] and it's not brother Branham only
[55:01] but it is God's people
[55:04] God is hiding behind a fleshly veil
[55:07] and he said a project to tell you
[55:11] that it's you wow
[55:18] well that just makes me happy
[55:19] you can't hear preaching like that in
[55:22] the denominations
[55:23] they don't have
[55:26] this message
[55:30] makes me want to go out and preach on
[55:32] the side of the street
[55:34] if people could only see this
[55:39] that God and man
[55:41] are becoming one
[55:43] this is the hour
[55:45] [Applause]
[55:48] stay on track
[55:55] Matthew 25 my children sing
[55:58] verse six you'll see she's and it says
[56:01] at midnight
[56:05] and we already know brother Brandon had
[56:07] preached Two Minutes to Midnight
[56:10] it was that 60 years ago now
[56:13] foreign
[56:24] many of us have seen this little diagram
[56:26] of the seven Church ages right
[56:30] brother
[56:32] this church age
[56:34] it's gonna be the shortest Church age
[56:38] if you do the math
[56:41] which I know brother probably has done
[56:44] foreign
[57:05] guess what year that is 2023
[57:12] could it be this year
[57:15] I'm not going to pretend like I know
[57:17] everything
[57:17] I'm not gonna pretend like I have some
[57:20] great Revelation
[57:21] but I can tell you one thing
[57:24] get up wake up church
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:31] and it could be this year it could be
[57:34] tomorrow it could be tonight I don't
[57:38] know but I know he's coming
[57:42] that's how close we could be
[57:45] there's no more Mysteries left to reveal
[57:50] all the scriptures have been fulfilled
[57:53] complete
[57:57] we're ready for a rapture
[58:01] and at midnight there was a cry made
[58:06] that's the shout
[58:08] a messenger came with a shot
[58:13] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[58:16] to meet him
[58:18] and we flip over to first Thessalonians
[58:23] says the Lord shall descend with from
[58:26] heaven with a shout
[58:28] the next thing is with the voice
[58:32] and brother Branham said that is the
[58:35] same voice
[58:36] that raised Lazarus from the dead that's
[58:40] going to be the Resurrection
[58:42] the literal voice of Jesus Christ
[58:45] we'll call the Dead from the grave
[58:49] it's a Lazarus
[58:51] hallelujah we're that close this is
[58:57] so there's some
[58:59] quotes that I want to read here
[59:02] let me find it I think it was voice of
[59:05] the sign 64.
[59:08] paragraph 80 92 I think it was
[59:18] let's start with 120.
[59:20] no more bounce backwards
[59:26] says every time
[59:28] before it happening
[59:31] now we bypass two or three pages here
[59:34] he's skipping notes
[59:36] you see
[59:38] a few minutes of different profits
[59:41] just to show you that you understand
[59:45] before anything happens
[59:49] God comes with a prophet
[59:52] to vindicate his word hallelujah
[59:58] and that coming of a prophet is a sign
[1:00:06] so every time before something happens
[1:00:11] there is always going to be a sign you
[1:00:16] now let's jump back to paragraph 89.
[1:00:25] I had some notes with these
[1:00:28] TC
[1:00:38] let's start with 82.
[1:00:42] but in the Old Testament
[1:00:44] they were more than that they were seers
[1:00:48] they were a man who told what was coming
[1:00:50] to pass
[1:00:52] and it happened
[1:00:54] that gave him the rights to be The
[1:00:57] Interpreter of the word of God
[1:01:00] because God took the word of that day
[1:01:05] and interpreted it himself through that
[1:01:09] man
[1:01:13] yeah
[1:01:15] and interpreted it himself through that
[1:01:19] man
[1:01:21] all right so we're not following any man
[1:01:26] we are following Jesus Christ
[1:01:29] and he sent us a messenger before he
[1:01:32] came
[1:01:33] to give us an opportunity to get
[1:01:36] ourselves ready
[1:01:38] the church world is lost they don't know
[1:01:40] when he's coming
[1:01:43] but a messenger has come to say get
[1:01:47] ready
[1:01:51] that's what he came on Earth
[1:01:55] he's always a sign
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:01:59] when a prophet comes to the Earth
[1:02:03] just watch as we go through it and see
[1:02:05] if it isn't so much
[1:02:10] always sends his prophet
[1:02:14] and you see a prophet rise on this on
[1:02:17] the scene
[1:02:19] let me reread
[1:02:21] he says when you see a prophet rise on
[1:02:24] the scene
[1:02:27] look out
[1:02:30] yes sir
[1:03:05] so we are following a true word message
[1:03:10] because that message has sounded
[1:03:14] that shout has gone foreign
[1:03:31] is it found in the scripture
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:36] he would prophesy and it would come to
[1:03:38] pass
[1:03:41] he would have healing after healing
[1:03:43] after healing yeah
[1:03:53] is not to vindicate the man himself
[1:03:56] remember but the message that is going
[1:03:59] along with him
[1:04:01] just to keep some balance
[1:04:04] I was listening to a message I think
[1:04:07] it's in the token
[1:04:09] where brother Branham said that his
[1:04:12] ministry
[1:04:13] was greater
[1:04:16] than Jesus Christ's own Ministry
[1:04:25] he said Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:04:28] has seen more miracles
[1:04:36] imagine the magnitude of this message
[1:04:43] is coming down to vindicate this message
[1:04:48] more than he said to Jesus Christ in
[1:04:51] Nazareth please
[1:04:54] that's all the kids would say
[1:04:59] successful
[1:05:03] I read that that
[1:05:05] paragraph
[1:05:07] it blew my mind
[1:05:11] and then you can't say that God doesn't
[1:05:13] love his right
[1:05:15] he's Vindicated and Vindicated and over
[1:05:18] Vindicated
[1:05:22] say catch your attention
[1:05:25] he didn't descend with a whisper
[1:05:27] yeah
[1:05:29] but he descended with a shout
[1:05:32] because he wants to get our attention
[1:05:45] praise the Lord are we good so far
[1:05:49] I have a timer on myself don't worry
[1:05:55] but the purpose of this messenger
[1:05:58] was to go wake up the sleeping Brides
[1:06:03] she was resting dormant
[1:06:10] so the bride was always there
[1:06:13] but she wasn't awakened yet
[1:06:22] we were always here
[1:06:24] but we didn't always see the message
[1:06:29] I don't care if you were born and raised
[1:06:31] in a message
[1:06:38] I didn't understand the message growing
[1:06:40] up in the message
[1:06:43] but when it's revealed to you
[1:06:47] when this world awakens you on the
[1:06:50] inside
[1:06:52] then it does something to you
[1:06:55] praise the Lord
[1:06:57] back to the paragraph
[1:07:01] where were we 82
[1:07:02] news
[1:07:14] look out
[1:07:18] now paragraph
[1:07:20] 95. paragraphsenko
[1:07:28] let's back up to 94.
[1:07:30] says the pillar of fire
[1:07:33] as soon as the sign came up there
[1:07:38] it was the was the sign that the voice
[1:07:41] was ready to speak
[1:07:45] amen amen
[1:07:48] so the sign and the shout are the same
[1:07:51] electricity so the sign that God sent us
[1:07:55] it was a messenger with a message
[1:08:04] and it's saying that the voice is ready
[1:08:07] to speak hello
[1:08:12] how many beliefs that say Amen
[1:08:15] then the voice is ready to speak
[1:08:19] the voice is ready to speak because we
[1:08:22] see the sign language
[1:08:24] the pillar of fire was there to say that
[1:08:27] the voice was ready to speak
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:34] to restore something
[1:08:36] means to bring back to its original
[1:08:39] states
[1:08:41] that's right
[1:08:43] so there's some people that will never
[1:08:45] see this message
[1:08:49] but there are some of us
[1:08:51] where our names were written back in the
[1:08:54] book
[1:08:56] way before the foundation of the world
[1:09:00] and because our names are there
[1:09:03] then we can be restored back to what we
[1:09:07] originally worked
[1:09:09] a Salvation message right here
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:15] this is a twenty dollar bill
[1:09:20] it's got a value
[1:09:23] of twenty dollars
[1:09:26] now I got everybody's attention right
[1:09:34] it doesn't matter if this is
[1:09:41] but what if I just
[1:09:45] some of your s
[1:09:48] can't imagine I'm doing this
[1:10:00] brother Patrick do you want this
[1:10:02] one it hasn't lost its value right
[1:10:06] this is what it really is
[1:10:13] at least he gets something out of church
[1:10:14] right
[1:10:17] and he'll never forget this message
[1:10:20] because he got paid to be in church
[1:10:27] why he received something from the
[1:10:29] message
[1:10:31] if we could only receive something from
[1:10:33] this message
[1:10:34] I guarantee you it's worth every bit
[1:10:37] more than that twenty dollars
[1:10:43] and what you can receive from this
[1:10:45] message is worth more than whatever
[1:10:54] if you can only wake yourself up
[1:10:59] get yourself ready because we're going
[1:11:02] in a rap we don't have to be bound down
[1:11:08] we can see that we still have values
[1:11:14] that's who we really are we still have
[1:11:18] values
[1:11:20] I'm telling you the store doesn't care
[1:11:22] where that dollar bill has been
[1:11:27] they'll still accept it as the twenty
[1:11:29] dollars
[1:11:32] did I crumple it up
[1:11:34] did I marry it
[1:11:37] did I stomp on it
[1:11:41] sometimes we let the devil do that to us
[1:11:45] we get ourselves all in a tight wad
[1:11:49] we don't know what's going on we let him
[1:11:52] just trample all over us
[1:11:54] and we let Satan tell us
[1:11:57] that we're no longer a 20 billion
[1:12:04] when in reality
[1:12:13] we have not lost an ounce of purchasing
[1:12:16] power
[1:12:22] when we were in God's mind when he said
[1:12:26] let there be lights
[1:12:30] I'll tell you what kind of God we serve
[1:12:33] he didn't say let there be light
[1:12:36] and there wasn't light yeah
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:56] and now is the time
[1:12:59] when God and man are becoming one
[1:13:04] [Applause]
[1:13:11] I don't care what you're going through
[1:13:16] but it's time to wake up church
[1:13:18] it's time to realize we're about ready
[1:13:21] to go to a marriage supper
[1:13:25] during the day
[1:13:28] that wasn't on their mind anymore
[1:13:30] maybe they had a long Voyage
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:34] maybe they had to walk Barefoot all the
[1:13:37] way down
[1:13:38] maybe they were exhausted
[1:13:41] maybe they felt very fatigued
[1:13:44] but I tell you what when they heard that
[1:13:46] voice
[1:13:50] it's time to trim your legs I guarantee
[1:13:54] they were excited
[1:13:56] there was a fire not only burning in her
[1:13:59] lamp
[1:14:02] because they knew they were going to
[1:14:04] land
[1:14:05] they were a participants
[1:14:08] they're not just going as a viewer
[1:14:12] an honor guest the
[1:14:16] VIP
[1:14:18] praise the Lord
[1:14:22] brother Brandon says in the message the
[1:14:23] rapture
[1:14:28] he says the first thing comes
[1:14:30] this is paragraph 141.
[1:14:33] and this is the rapture in December 4th
[1:14:36] this song
[1:14:40] now remember those those those quotes I
[1:14:43] just read to you
[1:14:46] they were preached about a year and a
[1:14:48] half so after the seals were broken
[1:14:53] and brother Branham is telling us that
[1:14:55] we're looking for a sign
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:59] a prophet and prophet
[1:15:01] because the voice is about ready to
[1:15:04] speak
[1:15:09] he says when he starts descending from
[1:15:11] Heaven
[1:15:12] there's a shout he said what is it it's
[1:15:17] a message to gather the people together
[1:15:22] when you look at the ministry of brother
[1:15:23] Branham
[1:15:25] he could have been a very rich and
[1:15:27] wealthy man
[1:15:30] he was offered a million dollars cash
[1:15:35] back in those days I think that would
[1:15:37] translate to maybe 5 million 10 million
[1:15:38] now
[1:15:42] it's doubled in the last two years
[1:15:44] whatever it was
[1:15:52] how many preachers would fall for that
[1:15:56] how many message preachers would fall
[1:15:58] for them
[1:16:00] it was coming from a Christian man
[1:16:06] foreign
[1:16:07] it wasn't some worldly man offering it
[1:16:10] to him
[1:16:12] but we can't we don't have time to get
[1:16:15] our eyes on to these worldly things
[1:16:19] okay what is it it's a message to gather
[1:16:23] the people together
[1:16:24] a message comes forth first
[1:16:28] now lamp trimming time
[1:16:31] rise and trim your land
[1:16:34] what watch was that yes sir the seventh
[1:16:37] yeah
[1:16:39] the types in here
[1:16:51] some of them found out they didn't have
[1:16:53] any oil in their life
[1:16:57] don't let that be you yes
[1:17:00] now is the time to prepare
[1:17:03] now is the time to get yourself ready
[1:17:07] if you're not dressing right
[1:17:10] now is the time to correct it
[1:17:12] if you're not talking right
[1:17:15] now is the time
[1:17:17] if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:17:19] now is the time to correct it
[1:17:24] amen
[1:17:26] so many times we just make up the Holy
[1:17:28] Spirit as like a lottery please
[1:17:30] like some people get it some people
[1:17:32] don't accept the sweet daughter no you
[1:17:35] come up to the Altar and some people get
[1:17:36] touched and some people don't juvenile
[1:17:40] I can tell you this is some people will
[1:17:43] come up to the altar some people will
[1:17:46] receive emotions
[1:17:48] and some people won't
[1:17:51] that has nothing to do
[1:17:53] with being touched by God or not
[1:17:59] so many times we think that we have to
[1:18:01] be touched by emotions
[1:18:05] or some great lightning bolt has to come
[1:18:08] down
[1:18:09] to feel like we've been touched by God
[1:18:14] but have you ever heard of the still
[1:18:16] small voice
[1:18:20] sometimes it's that still small voice
[1:18:26] when God comes to you and God says
[1:18:29] you're forgiven
[1:18:32] I love you
[1:18:34] all those old things are pastors
[1:18:43] it doesn't have to come through a loud
[1:18:45] shouting and jumping up yeah
[1:18:52] although there is stimulation of
[1:18:54] Revelation I believe in that too
[1:18:58] here's what I believe you praise God the
[1:19:01] way you want to praise God
[1:19:05] don't worry about what
[1:19:06] brother Patrick thinks
[1:19:10] if you want to just raise up and say
[1:19:12] praise God hallelujah
[1:19:14] [Applause]
[1:19:18] if you're reserved and you just say
[1:19:20] praise God hallelujah
[1:19:24] that's just fine too
[1:19:28] there's no big eyes little use right or
[1:19:30] wrong
[1:19:34] it's how you relate to Christ
[1:19:38] it is your personal walk with Christ
[1:19:44] I want to get to something here before
[1:19:46] we do
[1:19:51] okay and they did yeah some of them
[1:19:54] found out they didn't even have any oil
[1:19:55] in their lamps
[1:19:58] I like what brother random says here
[1:20:01] he says but it's lamp trimming time
[1:20:05] he says it's Malachi four times
[1:20:11] it's Luke 17.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah we know that it was already
[1:20:17] Malachi three times
[1:20:20] and look what it produced
[1:20:23] now it's Malachi
[1:20:26] and look at what it's producing
[1:20:29] it's producing you and becoming one
[1:20:37] what's up
[1:20:39] thank you
[1:20:41] remember amen it's Malachi four times
[1:20:49] it's Luke 17 30 times
[1:20:52] just like John 4 ran the first coming of
[1:20:55] Christ
[1:20:59] so brother branham's Ministries
[1:21:03] we don't have to make it all mysterious
[1:21:05] to say the seventh angel anymore we know
[1:21:07] his name is
[1:21:13] this message that we follow
[1:21:16] the Vindicated word
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:21] amen this message wasn't four times
[1:21:25] this message is for now
[1:21:27] [Applause]
[1:21:29] let's imagine we're in a great Symphony
[1:21:34] a grand Orchestra as brother Brandon
[1:21:36] would say
[1:21:39] and the director is telling them how to
[1:21:41] go along the song
[1:21:45] and they're following the music notes
[1:21:50] page after page
[1:21:53] perfectly in Harmony
[1:21:55] and then you get to the seventh page
[1:21:58] and the trumpet wants to go back to the
[1:22:01] first
[1:22:05] it wouldn't be in harmony
[1:22:07] something would be wrong
[1:22:10] when it comes time for the seventh page
[1:22:13] you must stay with the seventh page
[1:22:20] Batman
[1:22:22] the shout must be by a prophet
[1:22:30] young people don't ever be ashamed of
[1:22:32] this message
[1:22:35] or what it produces
[1:22:38] I don't care if you go to a public
[1:22:40] schools
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:42] I was homeschooled so I didn't have to
[1:22:44] deal with a lot of that um
[1:22:50] but when you go to school and people say
[1:22:54] boy you're old-fashioned
[1:22:59] they don't even know what that means
[1:23:04] but I can guarantee you one thing
[1:23:07] if you look at them and see what their
[1:23:09] life produces
[1:23:11] and then look at their life and see if
[1:23:14] that's what you want
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:27] all these guys can get all these girls
[1:23:32] can you imagine trying to date in the
[1:23:35] world today
[1:23:41] with all this transgender and gay and
[1:23:44] all this stuff going on
[1:23:47] just being real yeah
[1:23:52] you date somebody for months
[1:23:56] and then you find out they're not even
[1:23:58] the same gender as what you thought
[1:24:05] think about it
[1:24:08] and then we wonder why our parents are
[1:24:10] so protective of it
[1:24:17] am I right or am I right
[1:24:21] this message is here to prepare us for
[1:24:24] something greater
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:27] God is protecting you from heartbreaking
[1:24:32] when you go into school looking pure and
[1:24:35] holy
[1:24:37] you are a billboard for Jesus Christ
[1:24:43] who would you rather
[1:24:45] represented just do it
[1:24:49] Nike Nike Pumbaa
[1:24:53] Puma Puma
[1:24:56] you name it
[1:24:58] who would you rather
[1:25:00] representation our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:25:03] Christ
[1:25:05] or some fashionable name brand
[1:25:09] whose quality is no better
[1:25:13] it just has a logo
[1:25:15] and it costs a lot more
[1:25:21] oh my that's right
[1:25:23] that's right it doesn't matter what
[1:25:25] shoes you wear remember
[1:25:27] but it matters who's under your feet
[1:25:33] listen the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:36] Satan is supposed to be under her feet
[1:25:42] down by the foundations
[1:25:44] and then all the girls are wanting to
[1:25:46] put on makeup
[1:25:48] what are they what do they call that
[1:25:50] Foundation right
[1:25:52] you're putting the devil's foundation on
[1:25:55] your face
[1:26:05] guess where his kingdom goes
[1:26:09] on top of the foundation
[1:26:16] that was free
[1:26:19] but we're living in Malachi for five
[1:26:21] times
[1:26:23] and what was his cry
[1:26:26] straighten up get back in line
[1:26:29] and then he goes right into correcting
[1:26:31] the women where they're at
[1:26:34] and then he turns on us brothers and
[1:26:36] says it's because you won't take the
[1:26:38] position in your home
[1:26:44] and then he puts on an apron
[1:26:46] it starts washing the dishes
[1:26:53] like I said I'm just
[1:26:55] preaching it myself all right
[1:26:58] my family moved out on me my family
[1:27:03] instead of me turning 18 and moving out
[1:27:06] on my family
[1:27:10] said man this guy's getting so old and
[1:27:12] he's never moving out
[1:27:16] I'm moving out
[1:27:19] taking the whole family with me
[1:27:25] so I get to wash all my own dishes
[1:27:31] but sometimes being a real man
[1:27:35] isn't just being the dominating man
[1:27:39] why if you do this wife you take care of
[1:27:43] the children well if you take care of
[1:27:45] the dishes
[1:27:46] the wife you clean the house
[1:27:49] and then you go hand her the checkbook
[1:27:51] and make her balance it is
[1:27:55] and you kick back in the Lazy Boy
[1:27:58] foreign
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:21] it's saying sorry to those that you've
[1:28:24] heard
[1:28:25] it's saying sorry to those that you've
[1:28:28] heard
[1:28:33] if if a man wants to be a real man
[1:28:37] let him say apologize to those he's hurt
[1:28:40] oh okay
[1:28:44] then we'll see how many real men there
[1:28:46] are yeah
[1:28:49] if you make a mistake
[1:28:51] you must be humble and corrected
[1:29:01] okay my time's about up finial
[1:29:09] okay let's switch over to Revelations 10
[1:29:12] and we'll close with this
[1:29:14] I don't know
[1:29:18] Revelation 10.
[1:29:21] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:29:24] from heaven
[1:29:26] clothed with a cloud
[1:29:28] and a rainbow
[1:29:30] and brother Branham tells us that is
[1:29:33] Christ
[1:29:36] and he had on in his hand a little book
[1:29:39] open
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:44] you see to many people
[1:29:47] many Christians
[1:29:49] the book is closed to them
[1:29:52] it has not been revealed to them
[1:29:57] but brother Branham came and preached
[1:29:59] just the Mighty God unveiled
[1:30:04] just like there was an unveiling at
[1:30:07] Christ's time
[1:30:09] there is an unveiling in this last hour
[1:30:13] and that's the message that we believe
[1:30:16] that's why we gather ourselves together
[1:30:20] we're not just showing up to show face
[1:30:24] because people think we're not a message
[1:30:27] believer if we don't show up
[1:30:28] no but we're showing up
[1:30:31] because we have a message
[1:30:34] we have a revelated word message
[1:30:38] and we're coming to become closer to God
[1:30:42] and get more of that Revelation that
[1:30:46] he's trying to give us
[1:30:48] because it's an open book it's not a
[1:30:51] closed book but our names are written on
[1:30:54] that book
[1:30:55] and just like John did
[1:30:58] I can imagine when he saw his name
[1:31:02] he shouted where Heaven could hear
[1:31:05] it's where everybody on Earth
[1:31:11] his shout It's All Out the Devil could
[1:31:13] hear people
[1:31:15] because he was just happy that his name
[1:31:18] was on the board
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:20] what did Jesus say he told his disciples
[1:31:24] don't be happy that you can do all these
[1:31:26] Miracles
[1:31:28] Miracles are such a grand thing to us
[1:31:31] a lot of preacher comes through and have
[1:31:34] a prayer line and he heals get the
[1:31:35] people get healed under his ministries
[1:31:41] oh he's just such a great man of God
[1:31:44] come this year Jesus said don't get
[1:31:46] caught up in those things
[1:31:47] but be happy that your names are on the
[1:31:50] books
[1:31:53] I'm just happy my name is on the bus
[1:31:56] well how do you know your name's
[1:31:59] can you read your name on the bus I know
[1:32:02] my name is
[1:32:03] because I am manifesting the evidence
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:10] brother Patrick you manifest
[1:32:13] it that your name is
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:18] a wheat plant is going to produce wheat
[1:32:22] how do you know it's weak because it
[1:32:26] produces wheat how do you know a sheep
[1:32:29] is cheap
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:32] it doesn't go into a factory and
[1:32:34] fabricate all the yarn
[1:32:39] but it just goes about life
[1:32:43] handling the struggles of life
[1:32:47] and it produces something that is
[1:32:50] absolutely totally different
[1:32:53] then what the goats produce
[1:32:56] the goats eat the same thing
[1:33:03] but they don't produce wall
[1:33:05] they produce hair
[1:33:08] but a sheep Bears wolf amen
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:17] that's right how do you know you have
[1:33:20] the Holy Spirit
[1:33:21] because you will manifested
[1:33:26] Hallelujah
[1:33:29] it's an open books
[1:33:33] oh I got distracted Revelations 10.
[1:33:38] can you set this right uh right foot
[1:33:41] upon the sea and left here
[1:33:45] let's skip it skip down
[1:33:50] verse 7 verses Revelations 10 and 7.
[1:33:55] this is it but in the days of the voice
[1:33:58] of the seventh angels
[1:34:06] many people look and read at these
[1:34:08] scriptures and wonder
[1:34:10] they don't know if this is in times
[1:34:13] paste
[1:34:14] they don't know if it's in time future
[1:34:18] we had a prophet to say this is now
[1:34:25] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:34:28] Angels
[1:34:31] maybe I'll read it like this
[1:34:33] in the days of brother William Brown
[1:34:38] is his name in there
[1:34:41] then how do you know it's him because he
[1:34:45] manifests
[1:34:46] his name was in the book
[1:34:50] let me read it again
[1:34:53] in the year 2023 the
[1:34:57] um
[1:35:01] listening to brother Brown's message
[1:35:10] when he shall begin to sound
[1:35:12] the mysteries of God should be finished
[1:35:17] as he had declared to his servants
[1:35:25] and the voice so we've already seen
[1:35:28] Christ
[1:35:29] now we've seen brother Branham
[1:35:33] and John is a type of the Bride
[1:35:37] he says and the voice which I heard from
[1:35:40] Heaven spoke unto me again
[1:35:44] and said go and take the little book
[1:35:49] which is open in the hand of the Angels
[1:35:55] I'll behave
[1:35:58] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:36:01] Earth
[1:36:03] so are we taking the book out of brother
[1:36:05] branham's hand
[1:36:08] no no we're taking the book no Christ
[1:36:14] we're not falling in love with Eliezer
[1:36:17] we're falling in love with Isaac
[1:36:21] all right not some Pastor over in Africa
[1:36:26] I don't care if he's got 80 000. person
[1:36:47] what God is doing right now
[1:36:54] he said go and take the little book that
[1:36:56] is
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:59] verse nine that's enough
[1:37:02] and I went unto the angel
[1:37:04] and I said unto him give me of the
[1:37:07] living song
[1:37:11] give it to me
[1:37:13] every time there's a church service give
[1:37:16] it to me
[1:37:18] like brother Brandon said every time
[1:37:20] those doors open up
[1:37:22] give it to me whatever promise God has
[1:37:25] in this scripture
[1:37:27] give it to me if it promises healing
[1:37:31] give it to me if it promises Deliverance
[1:37:37] whatever I have need of us I go to the
[1:37:41] little book
[1:37:42] and I don't just set it on the shelf for
[1:37:44] later
[1:37:46] let's go to the book you take the book
[1:37:50] and you eat it up
[1:37:55] it'll create stimulation of Revelation
[1:38:00] and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:38:04] um
[1:38:08] foreign
[1:38:23] that's people turning against Jesus
[1:38:29] we're not in a popularity contest
[1:38:33] do you think brother foston would preach
[1:38:35] some of the things he preaches if he was
[1:38:36] just worried about being popular
[1:38:43] I'll tell you one thing you guys are
[1:38:44] blessed people
[1:38:47] to have a pastor that will toe that line
[1:38:52] and we'll tow it as straight as he
[1:38:55] preaches
[1:38:58] cause you just can't go to the Baptist
[1:39:00] Church and hear that kind of preaching
[1:39:02] English
[1:39:05] it's not a popularity contest
[1:39:08] but it is the word of God
[1:39:14] praise the Lord if the musicians want to
[1:39:16] go ahead and come on
[1:39:18] but we could just look around and see
[1:39:21] where we're at
[1:39:26] brother Brandon gave the example of
[1:39:30] Psalms 22 I believe it was
[1:39:34] where the Pharisees were singing down at
[1:39:36] the temple
[1:39:38] and they're singing a song saying and
[1:39:40] they pierced my side
[1:39:46] while the scripture was coming to pass
[1:39:52] that's what's happening down there in
[1:39:53] the temple
[1:39:54] at the same exact time upon the hills
[1:39:59] Jesus Christ is dying on the cross
[1:40:03] those people totally missed you
[1:40:10] and it's time to wake up
[1:40:12] don't miss what God is doing today
[1:40:15] it's time to wake up
[1:40:19] emotionally
[1:40:32] because even the world is fulfilling
[1:40:34] their scriptures
[1:40:41] so I believe if they're fulfilling their
[1:40:43] scriptures
[1:40:45] how much more
[1:40:48] the Bride of Jesus is
[1:40:51] going to fulfill prescription
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:59] so it's time to wake up disability trim
[1:41:02] our lamps get all those worldly things
[1:41:04] shaking off
[1:41:06] young people just came back from
[1:41:08] Louisiana campus
[1:41:10] it's easy to shake things off you know
[1:41:13] Monday Tuesday Wednesday after
[1:41:15] campaign
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:23] the emotion wears off
[1:41:26] there's got to be something
[1:41:30] there has to be oil that you can drop
[1:41:35] if you got saved at Louisiana
[1:41:40] that's not the end of the road
[1:41:43] that's just the beginning
[1:41:49] and these signs shall follow them
[1:41:56] that means you're going to have tribes
[1:41:59] you're gonna have tribulations
[1:42:03] because Satan doesn't like that you got
[1:42:05] saved at the Museum
[1:42:08] he can train all those guns on somebody
[1:42:14] that'll be us
[1:42:16] but those two spirits will be so close
[1:42:20] that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:42:23] it was possible
[1:42:26] we must make sure
[1:42:32] just stand
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:39] his name
