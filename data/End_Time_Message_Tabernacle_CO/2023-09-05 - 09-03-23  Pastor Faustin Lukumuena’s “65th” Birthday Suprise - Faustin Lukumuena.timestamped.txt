[20:24] I want to appreciate you for the
[20:26] wonderful father that you've been for us
[20:33] um throughout our childhood
[20:37] we have a lot of good memories that we
[20:40] could share
[20:43] but if we want to share it all we'll run
[20:46] out of time
[20:51] but I just want to thank you Dad because
[20:54] you've always been there for us
[20:58] and today as we're growing up as well
[21:03] I remember as a child you were busy you
[21:06] were working full time
[21:11] you were a student and a pastor
[21:16] but regardless of all that
[21:18] you always had time to care for us
[21:24] just a little story that you probably
[21:26] might or might not remember
[21:30] but I remember when we were little
[21:35] um Dad used to drive a white Jeep
[21:40] and every day
[21:43] every did come home from
[21:46] Amazon waiting for him
[21:50] and he will take us all in his car
[21:54] you drive us around the neighborhood
[21:58] sometimes take us to go get ice cream
[22:03] and then I come back and then come back
[22:06] home
[22:08] this as an adult we realized that you
[22:11] know he was tired as a dad as coming
[22:13] from work
[22:16] but he always took his time even by the
[22:19] little things just to spend time
[22:21] kids
[22:25] even when we're going through hardships
[22:29] you always make sure to give us what we
[22:32] wanted
[22:35] he sacrificed himself
[22:38] his own strength
[22:40] so that we can have a happy life
[22:44] he gave us the best education
[22:48] took us on the best vacations
[22:53] even the little events like Christmas
[22:58] you always try to make it special for us
[23:04] will always remember what you've done
[23:06] for us
[23:09] and even today as adults
[23:12] even going through hardships right now
[23:17] you're always there for us to come
[23:21] for us to to talk to you and you're
[23:24] always ready to listen to me
[23:27] thank you for carrying us back then for
[23:29] caring for us back then
[23:32] continue to care for us
[23:35] and thank you for all that you taught us
[23:37] as a father
[23:40] if there's two things that I can say for
[23:43] sure that I've learned from my dad is
[23:48] always loving and serving God
[23:52] I've seen my dad serve God
[23:55] and the good times
[23:57] and in times where he was tried
[24:04] he's always served God
[24:09] whether there be a death in the family
[24:13] whether himself he was sick
[24:17] he's always always served God
[24:21] I remember seeing him almost dying
[24:27] but he's still knelt down and he prayed
[24:30] for us as a family
[24:35] we're so thankful for
[24:36] eign
[24:48] to come give it to him as well
