it's uh man my favorite service actually the the resurrection service it's always been a time for me I just have it's always been a blessing Sunday mornings and it's kind of like a special time of the week I know that it uh brother brandom and the scripture didn't allot it to a different type of day but just somehow it's a little bit the honoring of a resurrection it's a powerful time seem like all the families can get together and come to the house of the Lord and it's always a blessing uh want to just say this morning it's an honor to be able to speak to you again we just like to maybe bow our hearts for a word of prayer before we go into the word Heavenly Father we're certainly honored to be standing here and Lord we're we're not worthy of your grace of your mercy but you have been so kind to us Lord and the mercy that you have shown us in our lives and Lord to reveal to our hearts this great Word of Life father we're more thankful for that than anything that I know we thank you for the family and for the church Lord and for the ministry that you've placed here and the elders and Lord all the officers father that would make this possible to be here this morning this Gathering of people Lord You're we can see the great hand of your system of your Holy Ghost how it's been operated in all the gifts Lord that's been placed in this body and Lord we ask you this morning that may you give Grace to us one more time that your presence would come Lord that you would confirm your word true Lord we'd be the first person to admit oh God that we're helpless without you we confess it openly before all people Lord that without you we are nothing and we have no hope in this life but Lord if You' just come by this morning Lord and touch your children we would give you the glory and the honor we ask you father that you would do what no man could do may you heal the bodies of your people this morning and Lord may you touch their life may you send a delivering Spirit here in the building this morning and Lord I just pray for your glory and your grace Among Us now we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen and God richly bless you this morning if you have your Bibles we would just like to turn into the Book of Daniel uh if it's okay with you I'm going to continue just a little bit from here today Daniel the 2 chapter and uh we don't have brother Nathan to read this morning so we're going to shorten this to the to the end of this uh where we've already read the the the scripture if you were he um but I just going to read just a little portion here in Daniel the 2 chapter verses 40 down to verse 45 we're going to just we're going to skip down to the fourth Kingdom Daniel chapter 2 verse 40 45 and the fourth Kingdom should be strong as iron for as much as the iron breth in pieces and seduth all things and as iron that breth all these shall it break into pieces and Bruise whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes and part of The Potter's clay and part iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it a strength of iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with myy clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom should be part strong and partly broken now whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with myy Clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men isn't it odd that that scripture right there now that's speaking of the marriage between the Protestants and the Romans and that didn't take place until Kennedy in the 1960s when they began to mingle marry but the said they did it to break the power of it uh but they shall not cleave one to another even as I iron is not mixed with clay and in the days and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall not be destroyed my that feels good don't it and in the days of these kingdoms shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall not be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all the kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver the gold and the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure we ask the Lord to bless his words you could be seated uh I want to just continue uh out of this Daniel the second chapter here we're going to be uh continuing in this image of Daniel uh what he saw in the fourth Kingdom of course uh we took a little time on last Sunday to to present to you the idea amen that this fourth Kingdom of course was Rome and that how Rome was going to be divided into two parts both east and west and we saw that in history we saw Rome ruling from the time of Christ and of course they followed the great Kingdom of of Alexander the Great in Greece and then we seen Rome rise up and become a world power but then we seen Rome itself breaking into the East and West when Europe was developed it then began to move down into the 10 toes which now of course Rome has not disappeared but it exists in every nation on the earth it's a system brother B said see then we see Rome has two churches it has the Protestant church and it has the Catholic church so it has two churches it's a it's both denominational Protestant and it's the Roman Church is the Catholic Church of course and so we see then that the system of romanism or denomination has worked itself into every one of them now that's in the religious Powers now when you read this you you you we we seen last week of course that the image of Daniel was resulted in what was called in Daniel the 2 chapter but if it was only Daniel 2 that's one thing but now we also know that Daniel repeatedly sing this order of Kingdoms throughout the Book of Daniel also in the Book of Daniel the 7th chapter we'll read now uh from the 7th to the 13th verse I'm going to wait for him to pull it up and after I saw a night vision and behold a fourth Beast now the fourth Kingdom now we're seeing it as a fourth beast in Daniel 7 this is Daniel's own vision and behold the fourth vision of the fourth Beast Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had a great iron teeth and devoured and break in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 horns and I considered the horns and behold there Came Upon them another little horn which whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were the eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things and I beheld it till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did set whose garment was white as snow and is the hair the head like the pure wool his throne was like a fiery flame and his wheels of a burning fire and a fiery stream issued came forth from before him thousands ministered unto him 10 thousands time 10 thousand stood before him the judge was said and the books were open so you're seeing that the Ancient of Days was the great judge which will end up at the white Throne of judgment here in the 10th verse now we go on to the next verse 11th and I beheld them because the voice of the great words which the horn spake I be H till even the Beast was slain the body destroyed and giving to the Burning Flame and concerning the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a Time amen and I saw in the night visions and one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven that seem familiar didn't y'all and I sing the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him amen now if if you're reading now in Daniel chapter 2 we're watching the fourth Kingdom and we're seeing that a stone is going to strike the toes of that Kingdom so we're seeing the kingdom is Rome and it's called a stone hued out of the mountain striking it when you're reading Daniel 7 it's called a fourth Kingdom or a fourth beast and now you're seeing the Ancient of Days putting it in its place so the stone of Daniel 2 and the one called the ancient of d days of Daniel 7 is the same one it's not two different people it's two symbols that are showing the same thing if the fourth kingdom is Rome and the thing that destroys it then it's the same thing whether it's the stone or whether it's the Ancient of Days now John saw those beasts now again we want to look in Revelations 13 and see that John saw exactly the same thing go to Revelations 13: 1 and 2 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast R up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy amen and the Beast which I saw was like it unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him power and his seat and great Authority now when you're when you're reading that you're reading about the Beast that Daniel saw in Daniel 7 and now you're seeing it not as four separate beasts now we're seeing all of the Beast as one they're combined in one power in other words Rome has the power of all former kingdoms and now it's been developed in the one now it looked like Rome lost its power when you go to Revelation chap 13 and you'll see I think it's about the third verse and the Bible says that this this and we went through it last week so I'm not re rehearse it but this this looked like that it was killed but its deadly wound was healed which was the transferring from the pap Rome or from Pagan Rome to Papa roome but look at how that in the 13th uh there it is I saw one of the heads that was wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast now brother M teaches us specifically that's when it changes from a pagan Rome World system to a papa Rome World system so that's how it exists in Greater Powers through Papa Rome now in the 13th chapter and the 11th verse then we're going to see this is America coming up out of the scripture so isn't it amazing that God would show America in scripture amen it only was developed over 200 years ago but God sing this message coming out of this place oh I mean thousands of years ago amen and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth so we're seeing that coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and spake as a dragon read that next verse and spake as a dragon and exercise all the power of the first Beast before him and causes the Earth and them which that dwell in to worship the Beast with deadly wound was healed so you see he exercised the power of the same be if you watch this one coming out of the land in a little while he will make an image unto the Beast so the image unto the Beast of course the Beast is Rome it's Roman Catholicism but then there is an image unto the Beast which is the World Council of churches how many realize that's coming in the 1960s is where the World Council of churches was being developed and at the same time the World Council of churches was being developed isn't it amazing God had a prophet on the scene and he was striking against it the whole time he was saying it's completely of the devil don't you ever get in denomination don't you ever let them organize you don't you ever let them do it because he's he's actually showing that what it is it is a denominational system and that's how exactly Rome would rule the world now brother Ram is the one that's striking at this thing because it's his ministry to do so amen we see that he does this of course we see the the land and the sea in Revelations 13 and then we'll rehearse this from Revelation 10: 1- 2 in chapter 10 verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his face now we're back in Daniel 7 again amen and clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his Feast his face were as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire you that sound familiar anybody think about the pillar of Fire coming in this generation amen now watch and he had in his hand a little book open there's the word and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth now here he is dominating the power of Revelations 13 in Daniel two the stone was dominating the power of that great image in Daniel 7 the Ancient of Days was putting that that fourth Kingdom in his place in Revelations 13 it's a system coming out of water and out of sea and out of the land and out of the sea in Revelations 10 so we see Revelations 10 is the stone of Daniel 2 and it's the Ancient of Days of Daniel 7 amen now somebody says to me well brother Wayne I I thought you know this was all back in the future and all these things has happen let me let me just say this to you in Amos I third chapter the Bible said that God would do nothing until first he reveals it unto his servants the prophets so if there's going to be a fall of the entire World wouldn't God send a prophet first if there's going to be a fall of every World system if everything that you know is going to be annihilated wouldn't God send the prophet and warn that generation and condemn the devil and pull the scheme off of him of course he would do it he cannot do nothing and first until he does it in the second seal brother Adam says this I don't know when I don't know what's going to happen I don't know when it's going to happen but it's going to because he's revealing it right now he doesn't do anything until he makes it known unto a prophet first and he promised these things would come to pass in the last days now listen in the second seal paragraph 332 it will be revealed and those broken seals will reveal it and here they are now this is in the name of the Lord believe it friends come out of Babylon so the prophet is showing you that when the seals are opening it's revealing the of Babylon which is the call to the church to come out of Babylon to come out of Babylon Now isn't it beautiful because it didn't say just come out of the Roman Church it doesn't say just come out of the Protestant church but Babylon is a symbol of confusion of religion in the end time so come out of confusion now wherever that is if it's Independence if it's denominational if it's coming from Roman Church anything outside of vindication is confusion and he's saying come out of it amen come out of the homemade religion come out of the homemade Revelations come out of the ideas of man come out of the whole thing and stand upon the rock of vindication in this hour listen there's nothing going to stand outside of this message in this generation my Bible said that God shook the Earth he said this time he will shake the heavens and everything that can be shaken will be shaken but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken amen we've not received a throne and we've not received a city but we have received a Vindicated word from almighty God which is the stone of Revelation which is the truth of almighty God and it'll tear down every Kingdom look what it done in your personal lives look how it tore down the devil in your personal lives the one that sets up the entire Earth is amen Christ the Vindicated word which amen you're being invited to come into now the iron and Clay of course were the big toes of of course of Daniel's Visionary or Daniel's dream interpretation in Daniel 2 uh the the great image of of Gentiles had 10 toes now there's two big toes on those tin toes y'all remember from last Sunday what they were amen they were kof and Eisenhower kof being Russian represented the Eastern world and Eisenhower representing the Western world so there was one on each foot right and there was a big toe of iron and Clay there they were the big toes brother ram calls them the big toes now amen in the time of those big toes they wasn't toes they were men and those men were representing a power that was coming out of the scripture amen and at the same time that these Kings is upon the Earth the rock would strike that image so that rock then is represented by a prophet of God in this age which is bringing the power of our kingdom upon this Earth isn't it powerful to know that the word you're receiving right now will be a word that will grow into the mountain of New Jerusalem there will not be a change of administration from now unto the mountain of the New Jerusalem we're not going to have to change Messengers we're not going to have to switch horses amen there's not another corner to turn there were only four corners of Redemption Church there was only a word to restored to the bride of Christ and we have received a restored word I I think of it like this we can run with the message of Malachi 4 we don't have to check brother brandom we don't have to sit down and wonder if what he taught was right or can we can we trust it to preach it we can preach exactly what brother random said because he is the authority in the age that we're living and the Vindicated word of God is our absolute Authority against every demonic power remember he bound that Serpent and the Lord told him from this to everything below it from the greatest to the least this message will bang the devil and all of his powers and all of his World Systems upon your life now that Prophet is bringing in another kingdom this Prophet builds amen the prophet builds the church in the 70th week of Daniel he builds it from the platform of faith of Paul and he takes it all the way to the seventh age he said but now we're expecting the headstone is that right we're expecting The Headstone now there are many that believe that the headstone only represents the Corporal body of Jesus Christ I am not in that school I believe the headstone is the Revelation that is brought to the church in this hour amen because William brandom's commission how many knows this Commission on the on the on the river was to introduce Jesus Christ for the second coming amen how many knows that the message was to introduce now either he introduced him or he didn't fulfill his commission either he brought him on the earth or he didn't fulfill his commission but he said the seventh seal brings him back to the Earth amen now we didn't see a Jesus separate from the Willam brandom and that's the confusing part but as Elijah introduced the first Jesus he did it the first season by pointing out a man who was born of a virgin and said Behold the Lamb of God brother randam said but this Elijah will do the same very thing by po out a word born bride because Christ has become in a bride form in the age that we living in he did not introduced Jesus outside our body he introduced him as the word which comes into the church oh Church of the Living God you're the answer to this generation you're the Church of the Living God that will not fall by Creeds and system and denomination there is a Vindicated bride upon the face of the Earth it's Rapture season it's Rapture time how do you know it is brother Wayne because the life is now in the body identified by the original headship the life that's in you is the same identical life that was in Jesus Christ my Lord It's Not Another Jesus it's the same Jesus in a bright form it's not another God it's God who's in the church God above us God with us but it's God God in us now I can stand here with these scriptures all day long and prove to you you are the answer to this generation this started with a prophet if it only stays with a prophet then the scriptures are not true it strikes as a rock and grows into a mountain then William brandom as John said I will decrease and he will increase William brandham said the same thing to this generation I'm leaving the scene now amen but I have in uced you to him come on now he said I will decrease and he will increase this message has increased a hundredfold since brother Ram left the scene it's not only him preaching it now across the world our ministers have caught the revelation of this hour and the son of man has increased in The Bride of Jesus Christ Living out the manifestations of this age my there's one place this Roman system won't take over it's the the Church of the Living God there is a pride upon the Earth that will not be defiled she will not be tore down she will not allow that adulterous spirit in her life she has one husband amen and that husband is the Vindicated word of the age she's living in that's where your worship belongs it belongs in the word it belongs in the message the worship is not belonging to some system or some idea of man it belongs to God a think of this what happened what happened to the coming of that stone brother Ram identifies this now in the 70th week of Daniel he specifically identifies that The Headstone that's to come on the church is the rejected headstone which is also the stone of Daniel chapter 2 brother Ram says The Headstone is the Holy Ghost now I'm only responsible for preaching what he said if you got different doctrine that I can't make it make sense to you but I come to a place that I don't know anything the message is right so that's right and from from where I stand I haven't been to a school yet to teach me that he was wrong and if I get around somebody and they want to teach me he's wrong then I just don't listen to them I've got that right see I I have a different uh I have a different approach you believe brother braham's a prophet and you preach him to be the truth you're General to me our pastor I can easily get under him he's a general General in the army of God easily easily get under him because he's directing it by the message of the hour but if someone is not directing by the message well I'm going to stay with a word now we're going to we're going to look in this and see I don't want you to think that I'm I'm in heresy here this Capstone or this headstone is also predicted from the scripture I went across this real quick the other day I want you to read just a moment but this is where in the message of Grace brother bradam ties his ministry to the ministry of zerubabel of Zechariah 4 and you've heard me quote it many times you heard Brother Ray preach on it where where where this is not a stranger to this church but zerubabel was the one who rebuilt the Tabernacle of Jerusalem after after the fall of Babylon when Babylon fell Israel had an exodus into Jerusalem and rebuilt the Tabernacle but he put the headstone on it because the Bible said when you see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel you can Rejoice because he lays the foundation and The Headstone because it's his job right he's going to rebuild the foundation but put on The Headstone so when he's finished you'll have a headstone you'll have an original worship now it's important you hold on to this cuz we're going to get into worship Worship in the future services but look at this because he says zerubabel was a great Prince among the people now brother bam ties himself here he said zerubba lays the foundation he has also brought forth The Headstone and I want you to notice he never said bring forth the corner he said he'll bring forth The Headstone in message of Grace brother bam said now if we'll think for a minute the seven Church age messenger was the one to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit seventh Church age messenger rebuilding it under the power of Theology and the schools and the system he would rebuild it under the power of the spirit message of Grace brother bam said according to the prophecy there is to come a headstone in in breach brother Ram is the one who stands there in the breach message and said now maybe I'm just feeling this way I'm going to slow down real slow here so you can you you'll put the two of these together he said now who is worthy to open this book or to loose these SEALS or the angel asked and he said who's worthy he said maybe I'm just feeling this way but let him now let him here is the book of redemption here is the Plan of Redemption and he's the only way you'll ever be redeemed for the titled Eve of redemption let him come forward let him come forward look what he's doing brother Ram is bringing forth something when he's opening these seals he's bringing forth something in zerubabel in zachariah's Prophecy he would bring forth The Headstone in the Bree think about it there is a gap between the church and what there had to be somebody to stand in the Gap to bring the church and the head together proving his word 1964 brother said it would take the ministry of the son of man Jesus in human flesh to do this and he would join the church with the head and he called that the marriage of the Lamb isn't it beautiful the marriage of the Lamb he's tying it to The Headstone being joined together in the breach brother brandham is teaching this now I don't have time to go deep in this but you do know that brother brandham in the dedication of this the service before this come out late and God in Simplicity he said you know why I'm late he said just performed something in the back room he performed a wedding in the back room before he preached the seals he said which I think is symbolic to what I'm about to do now y'all y'all know in the Jewish weddings that there was a change from the from the uh from the relationship of betrothal to marriage y'all know what the change was when she received the promise of the contract and it was and she took it for her own that was the the ceiling of the marriage and here's a prophet re revealing the word standing in the Gap and bringing the headstone to the body look you are the hearer of the word he is the word and when you receive the word it brings the two together now I'm quoting brother brandom you know I'm quoting him amen it brings the two together now from that moment then brother Brandon Begin to say I'm going to declare the ministry he is here amen he is here I'm interested only in Jesus Christ he is here see he's got to come in human flesh and I want to comfort you he is here amen how many ever heard him say it headship is here see it's not coming it's here he's giving you this he's here now in Zechariah Chapter 4 read this sixth to sth verse and you'll pick up something he answered spake unto me saying the word of the Lord under rubel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of host he said Where Art Thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel thou shall become a plain and he bring forth a headstones crying Grace Grace unto it now in the verse previous in sixth verse look at what he says here not by might not by power but by my spirit now go to 2 Corinthians the third chapter and read the 17th verse When Paul talks about that God would bring a New Covenant into the church now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty I'll do it by my spirit now who whose Spirit the Lord is that Spirit now that one scripture is enough to go home and Shout about all day the Lord is that Spirit now go to first Thessalonians chapter 4 and watch the 16th verse see the Lord is that spirit for the Lord that which is that Spirit himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and with the trumpet of of God which the dead in Christ shall rise first now that there's not a question in our mind who that shout is this morning the Lord which is that Spirit would descend from heaven with a message of the Lord himself the spirit not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord now look that shout has been established as the message of brother brandham and it's not questionable this morning it's not something that we're going to take and sit down and have a have a Minister's meeting over it to figure out if that's correct we don't need to question it we don't need to discuss it I don't need to personally find it it is exactly the truth and Vindicated by God's word in this generation now that's a fact that the shout is the message receive it or don't that's a fact but what the devil's trying to do is keep people's questioning that point Amen to miss the next point that there's a voice of that Resurrection there's a voice of that message somewhere alive today that voice is not dead that voice is alive we've seen the stone but it grows into a mountain M we' seen the message but it's grown into a bride this is not the first day of this message we've been 50 years with a message maturing in a seed of life in this end time there are people sitting here that are the message of the hour from the top of their head to the bottom of their feet this is that generation which your kingdom of God has taken over a human body the kingdom has begin to progress it started as a light but look where it is this morning brother B said it come into you as a light and then begin to take over your body amen now people say well brother Wayne are you saying he's here I'm reading you what brother Ram said he's here headship is here the shout is made it is brought his presence among the people look at it's The Headstone it's the Messiah amen it's not some man it's the Messiah the holy spirit is the Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing and the here working in the flesh getting the bride ready for rapturing Grace there is a spirit working in the church this morning getting the people ready for the Rapture there's a spirit working in the Roman system it's the devil working in the system getting the people to an Armageddon but there's a spirit working in the church which is getting the people ready for the Rapture amen it's identified in Zachariah it's identified in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 now the scripture tells us of course this is the ministry that will unfold this is the stone amen the stone amen that which the builders disallow in Romans 9 this is where brother bradam reads amen a stone will hold I lay Zion a stone a rock of offense i r a Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of offense now we're going to watch the scripture in second Peter the Bible tells us that they will scoff amen we is his coming where's the promise of his coming they're going to scoff at the doctrine that Christ is descending in this message they will stumble at this because it's too simple they will stumble at that idea that Christ is coming into the Earth amen through the message of the hour they'll stumble at it they will scoff at it amen but until you that believeth you shall not be ashamed my brother man I was reading this morning ashamed message and brother manam tells clearly he said he said wait we don't have to be ashamed of this he said Moses wasn't ashamed to declare to Pharaoh that it was The Exodus time amen amen them men was not ashamed Noah was not ashamed to preach 120 years that was going to rain amen and the pride ought to not be ashamed that there's a stone that's come out of Heaven that has smashed down every Kingdom and it's possessing the Church of the Living God we are not separate from that Revelation this morning but it's begin to pull the church into itself the church is fleeing in Romans 9 this is when brother random himself comes to seeing that the the that the vision of seven angels coming to him that's what it means how many knows brother BR seen a vision of seven angels coming previous to that Vision it's called the second Climax and reproach for a cause for his word you can read it in reproach cause for a word it's it's a vision and he sees it and ask what does it mean Romans 9 tells what it means now it's amazing because brother brandham Saidi looking for an interpretation to come on the vision he said but no interpretation came because it was written in the scripture how many knows what scripture It Was Written in Revelations 10 veres 1-7 so Revelations 10 1-7 that Ancient of Days coming with a book in his hand putting his foot on left and see is also Romans the 9th chapter which is the the builders rejected amen this this message ties from the front of this Bible to the back of this Bible amen the the the the the scriptures that identify this message are Beyond infallible it's beyond the question of whether amen whether it's scriptural or whether it's not scriptural it is setting there the Ancient of Days whose garment did set now watch because Romans 9 amen it is the it is the headship can we go back to Daniel 7: 9 watch this and the Ancient of Days whose garment is white as snow his hair is the head of pure wool his his his throne as flames of fire now skip to the 13th verse and I saw in the night visions and one like the son of man with the Clouds Of Heaven came to the Ancient of Days which brought him near before him now can we have that picture of the cloud do you do you actually have it or is there any way to bring it up we showed it last week you all know the picture of the cloud brother bam amen actually in the message thinking man's filter he said I read over in Daniel the ancient of days and I've seen the Ancient of Days and the Ancient of Days is the same yesterday today and forever now now brother brandom identifies that the Ancient of Days that he saw out there on the mount Sunset is the same very thing that that John saw in Revelations 1 and also saw in Revelations 10 Amen brother Ram said there he was standing there still with r with supreme authority isn't that beautiful thinking man's filter when the angels of the Lord appeared out there those Seven Seals when the angels of the Lord appeared out there with them Seven Seals that's Romans N9 that's Revelations 10 that's Daniel 2 that's Daniel 7 that's 1 Thessalonians 4 that's Revelations chapter 2 are you with me amen now we're not talking about one scripture and just running wild with one scripture we're talking about the entire Bible seeming its way to an event that took place out there and had a prophet not been there we wouldn't know it had brother random not brought it scientist took the picture and couldn't figure out what it was but a prophet took the picture and brought it back to a humble bunch of people turned it to the right and said it's our Lord up there amen now if we believe brother the random that's our Lord up there and we now have supreme authority concerning the word in the age we're living in now there was Standing There Yet brother bam said see when the angels of the Lord appeared out there and went up into the air which we have the picture around the country there he was standing there still wigged with that supreme authority now watch he is the head of the church he is the head of the body now if you ever heard me preach on the cloud Ms you've heard me say this there is a reason that it was only the picture of the face because his body was on the earth it was not a picture of the whole body of Jesus it was the face of Jesus it was the headship coming to the body he already had a body what house will you build me amen what place will my headship rest in this age if I would send a message will I find faith on the earth will I find a place for this word to will I find a church somewhere who is like a Rebecca and ready to see the the elaser word that'll take them back unto their Isaac my Isaac came to Rebecca on the words of elaser and then she went to her Isaac Isaac never came to that well Isaac never came to her house he came on the words of elaser and the spirit of that Camel carried her in the presence of him and the Church of the Living God has received a message in this age and Christ has come to us in our churches and in our pews and in our situations but it came in the word of God but the spirit of this message is going to catch up a bride and carry her into the presence of almighty God he's not going to leave us here this word has come to take a bride out of Babylon let go of Babylon is falling apart anyhow it is the head of the body now you see why in Christ the mystery he'll say that we have Satan's answer being identified by the original headship we are not looking for an answer I'm not digging for the answer I have the answer amen I have the answer I'm not being bold I'm telling you the bride cannot do nothing till she has thus sayith the Lord and you have thus sayith the Lord God sends it by a prophet if you don't have it he'll have to send another Prophet but we have it now the problem is what are we going to do with it are we going to are we going to bargain with the devil to figure out if it's right or are we going to take something we know that's right and tear down every devil power that comes up against the Church of the Living God look you got a token mother you got the power of the headship behind you when you go against that devil and take back that child you're not here by yourself all of Heaven is behind this word take your token and go after that devil you said brother Wayne why are you bringing this to the Token because it's an exodus Daniel 2 is an exodus when the stone strikes the church goes up this message has come to Rapture the bride my it's an exodus and in The Exodus God sent a prophet a pillar of fire and a Passover brother that was blood upon the door and the firstborn live what happened in the Bible Exodus in The Exodus time God struck Egypt he struck Egypt with judgment what happens in Daniel to the stone strikes Babylon but when he strikes it the church will not be destroyed in the Judgment but God has prepared a way that she'll be carried out of judgment God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked but that judgment Stone will discern who is righteous and who is wicked come on now the coming of the sun doesn't it doesn't change your crop from corn to wheat or from wheat and cuar it just reveals what you got and when this message come it didn't change you from church to bride or from from foolish virgin to bride if you're the bride you was the bride to begin with it just took the message to prove who you were you wasn't satisfied in that Babylonian system but the coming of this rock gave you the power to come out come on Church brother Ram seen the power Rome had and it had its bars and it had you locked in but a voice said to him amen deliver my people and he said House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ and the bars begin to drop and let me tell you something this morning this message still has the power to destroy religious spirits and ungodly spirits and demons of every kind this message is looking for somebody who will believe it enough to preach it and not be ashamed of it but let the power of God come upon it in the message ashamed I heard brother Ram say it this morning he said we need a burn another burst of faith we don't need to apologize to this devil we need to tell him who we are and the commission Upon Our Lives amen and tell that devil to get out of here we're not going to apologize we're not going to make room this is the stone amen of redemption the stone of judgment that kills that enemy Romans chapter 9 turns in this Daniel 7 and9 Revelations 1:12 what's what's the scripture let's hold it in the scripture Revelations 1:12 amen watch watch the scriptures uh uh 112 through 18 I won't read the whole thing but I turned to see the voice that spake with me and I turned and saw the seven golden candlesticks and in the midst the seven candles scks one like the son of man now that is exactly what Daniel seen in Daniel 7:9 back that up about two verses brother Jeremy go back go back and see that John heard the sound a voice of a trumpet look at what he said I was in the spirit and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet but said which was a clear and distinct voice now he was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet look what he's doing he's in a dispensational change he's in the Lord's day amen this is not back there in John's day this is in the Lord's day and look what he says now the next verse is he sees one like the son of man standing among them now brother bam goes on you know in 1960 and teaches that this is the church he teaches that there the bride coming to maturity under the word now that picture watching Daniel Amen in in in uh Revelation chapter 1 you can see it now he was in the midst of seven candlesticks one like the the son of man go to the next verse and then it starts describing his head his hair is like wo as white as snow his eyes now we're back in Daniel again now Daniel and John are both seeing end time events they're seeing it in the symbol you have seen it in the natural what they saw in Vision you have saw in reality what they saw you have seen are you hearing me I wished I lived in John's day I don't I wish I lived in Daniel's day I don't I'm glad I live in this day this is the greatest day that has ever been there's never been a day like this day there's never been a light like this day the reality of the word of God I'm not just reading it but I can show you a picture of it I can take you to a tape where brother random sat and communed with angels up on top of that mountain and come back with the word of God in this age to show us where're we were in Scripture it was an end time event that they were seeing amen now it it's amazing if you go back to Daniel chapter 12 can we can we can we take time in scripture Daniel chapter 12 now watch to show you that Daniel 2 is an end time event watch Daniel 12 and we read 2 to 10 and many of these sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to Everlasting condemn I'm assuming there's two resurrections there and they be wise shall shine as the brightness of the fir what's that word they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firment and they that turn to many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever next verse fourth and but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end and many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and I Daniel and beheld there stood two one of them on the one side of the river and one on the other side of the river amen now uh now in the sixth verse and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and I heard the man clothed in Len which was on the Waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto Heaven that seems common doesn't it some another scripture like Revelations 10 and he swore by him that liveth forever shall be times and times and a half a time and when he shall have accomplished the scatter the power of the Holy people all these things shall be finished and I heard understand not oh Lord what shall be the end of these things ninth verse he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed and sealed up until the time of the end and many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand now watch what Daniel is seeing he's seeing end time events now brother Braham takes that vision of one on one side of the river and one on the other but then there's a man standing on the water Waters a multitude of people clothed in white brother br says emphatically that's the holy ghost coming on the people which is the sign of the end time so Daniel 12 is an end time event it's at the same time that the book is being opened amen when Michael stands up for his people look what he's doing he's he's opening the book it's sealed up until the end time now if you if you carry with me back to Revelations the 10th chapter there's that Mighty angel coming down out of heaven and look what he's doing in the second verse amen here he's coming and I saw another Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud and he had in his hand a little book the book that Daniel said must be closed until the end now he's got the book in his hand and it's being opened now watch when John sees this John sees this Revelation and then in the bottom of this verse in six in chapter six he said but John don't write this vision seal it up until what until the seventh angel begins to sound now we're seeing the seventh Church age messenger the man William brandham is on the earth at the time of this coming oh glory amen then in breach page 74 when this messenger when this heavenly Angel comes on the earth the seventh angel will be on Earth at the time of this coming now why does a messenger why does a prophet have to be on the earth because it's the word coming to the church and the word can't come unless there's a prophet there to catch it and when the prophet catches it look what he does he brings it to the church now now in case you in case you think I'm off on the limb somewhere look at Revelation 10: 7 the seventh angel begins to sound the mystery of God would be finished go to Daniel 2 and watch eight times in Daniel 2 the word mystery appears but it's not to Daniel 7 or Daniel uh Revelations 10 and 7 that the mystery would be revealed Daniel 2 and Daniel 12 emphatically says the mystery would remain a secret until the seventh angel sounds it would be the revealing of that mystery amen uh uh the seventh angel are we all set the seventh angel is the one that opens that book and brings the Revelation let's carry on then to Revelation chap 22 let's go to the end of the matter Revelation chap 22 and let's look in the let's read I got the 10th verse can you back it up to the ninth verse and watch what happens now you'll see you'll see this happen in Daniel 2 as well the moment that Daniel reveals to Nebuchadnezzar the image go back and read Nebuchadnezzar bows to Daniel when this same Revelation comes to John through the seventh angel which what he say see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and thy brother and the prophet and then them which keep the says of of the book worship God in the eth verse John tries to worship the guy revealing this to him now watch but in the in the ninth verse don't do it but in the 10th verse look what he said he said and he saith unto me seal not the saint of the prophecy of this book the time is at hand so in the 10th chapter seal it in the 22nd chapter 10th verse unseal it who's the angel who's he talking to the seventh angel is the one John trying to worship and he's saying to you don't worship me I'm one of the prophets I'm here to reveal the secrets you need to worship God and look what he's doing he's unsealing the prophecy Heen can I can I put it in our language it's time for the Thunders to thunder it's time for the seals to be opened up the coming of that stone is the end of Gentile kingdoms the seven seal ends all things then the mess message of the hour is the end of the devil in your life he's finished when this message opened up to you he's finished the predestination of your life become real you now know I am a wise virgin from Matthew 25 I am Rebecca from The Book of Genesis 24 I am the Church of the Living God I'm Ephesians 5 I am a bride without spot or wrinkle I'm the voice of first Thessalonians 4 the symbols have have been revealed unto a reality it's no longer in the book church it's in the church it's in the bride I don't know how to say this to you but God ain't coming back after a book he's not coming back after a tape he's coming back after a word bride when the message has come into the church that's what he's coming for and anything that's holding you he has come to break the power of the devil that you can go it's your season it's your hour the Thunders have thundered the seals have sounded the message has been revealed Christ has struck the image of Nebuchadnezzar and gave you Liberty we're not a part of it friends look at the deception people all the time trying to put the church in in Tribulation or in some kind of persecution you're not in it you have escaped it when did I escape it when you stepped into this word you might not know it but when they got on Noah's boat they got in the new world and let me tell you something when you stepped into this word you stepped into another dimension you never heard about theophanies you never had about five ordained virgins you never heard about the stone coming into the the church that it was laid in you before the foundation of the world come on brother man said the stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world that's the reason Christ could come into the church you're not just choosing him he's choosing you and he's ordained you and anointed you for the season you're living I tell you what we are this morning we are not just another church you're a prophetic bride coming from the visions of the word of God now in revelation 22 let's go back now that's that's a seventh angel doing that I don't think we have any confusion here and if you if you want to get with me later I can show you in Revelation chapter 1 it called him the signifying Angel and if You' like to compare that with brother Ram's sermons look where this Angel that's revealing to John look where he starts the deity of Jesus Christ then he goes to the church ages and then he goes to the seals and then he goes to the Ty together of the entire book look where William bram's Ministry started the deity of Jesus Christ went to the church ages then went to the seals and then he tied the whole thing together matching the same Ministry John's seeing here now let's go back to revelation 22 I want to pick something up here and watch in this 11th verse at the sealing of this book he said seal not the Saints and he that is unjust he said let him be unjust just Ste and that which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and that he is Holy let him be holy still now watch this the Wicked Will Remain Wicked and the righteous will remain you preach this message to someone who does not have a seed of righteousness and they will reject it every time because there's nothing you can do because Jesus said you believe me not because my word have no place now watch this I'm not I'm not trying to screw things down tight here I'm trying to show you a beautiful thing the seed is the seed when the sun comes it's judgment but the message don't come to condemn you it comes to reveal who you were to begin with revelation 22 watch what he says and he that is righteous let him be righteous he that is righteous let him be righteous watch that verse watch that righteous right there and when you watching that go over to the scripture in Daniel CH 12 and wor the watch the 9th and 10th verse and he that is righteous from revelation 22 go to Daniel 12 and watch the nth and 10th verse amen it's a it's a beautiful is this okay to read the Bible yall okay with this Daniel 12:9 he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are sealed until the time of the end now watch revelation 22 when the book's unsealed now we're at the time of the end watch the 10th verse at the time of that unsealing many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly now it's revelation 22 almost word for word the wicked shall do wickedly but watch but none of the wicked shall understand but the wise but the righteous the righteous shall understand how do you know who that righteous is they shall understand they will be a wise virgin in the last days she will understand this word now I'm not I'm not going to take this to the intellectual CU brother bam tears it apart so don't ever take it well amen he knows all the scriptures and all that cuz you can know all the scriptures not understand but what we understand is like that little woman did at the well when the Vindication came to her she wasn't a Bible student but she believed that was the Messiah talking to her and she understood what doctors of divinity couldn't understand that was God dealing with her life and the church has understood this is the message of the hour this is God coming to our lives in Daniel chapter 12 if you watch the scripture here now of course he says they shall understand now now now you have prophecy at the time of the aling of the seals the spirit of wisdom will come into the church I love this the spirit of wisdom has promised to come into you to cause you to understand you're not some of us don't even have good educations some of you are not schooled at all but there's an understanding in you and that understanding is real and it's not the understanding of might or power it's by the spirit of God has made you understand the spirit within a man is the spirit of understanding now go to Ephesians chapter 1 and watch the promise of this scripture laid right over Daniel 12 the righteous now the wise and watch this and the god of our Lord Jesus Christ may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him and the next verse that the eyes of your understanding being the light that you may know what is the hope of his call him what is the riches of his glory of the inheritance in his Saints now in that powerful that the eyes of your understanding for the righteous shall understand the wise shall understand and you're getting the spirit of Revelation that will open the eyes of your understanding how many knows the message doors and doors brother B said the eyes of your understanding lays in your heart he said that when Christ come in he would Open Your Eyes by your heart that's the blindness of this age is it's a heart that's caused the blindness now if you go into Revelations chapter 3 from here here watch Revelation chap 3 and the Bible is going to depict to you amen that there is a people who don't know it because I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not is't that amazing that the lean doesn't know in an hour of knowledge they don't know in an age of understanding in the age to understand they don't even know that they're miserable blind and naked he said preacher why don't they know because they won't receive indication they won't receive the word of God of vindication so it's left them blind but if they would have their hearts turned by the message of the hour it would open up their eyes and they would see something come on Church y'all know I'm telling you the truth if you were setting in this building this morning brother Bram said in Bram Tabernacle he said Elijah in his day had a servant with him when they seen the Syrian Army coming he said that that that boy didn't see nothing but when Elijah be to pray to give the spirit of understanding in to him his eyes come open and he saw angels and fire all around about the cabin that he was in think about this this morning if your eyes would come open brother Ram said you'd be a member of this church the rest of your life if your eyes would come open this morning to what you're in the presence of right now oh church let me tell you what you must see you can see a lot of things but what you must see is the identified presence of God in this age and you must not see him in Luther's day you must not see him in bram's day or brother bram's day you must see him in the present hour you're living is he is not a god of History he is the I am that I am the same yesterday today and forever this message has brought the same God that was with Moses and Joshua right to the age that you're living in what is it it's an after burning truth that comes into the church now watch in Revelations 3 the curse of that church was they didn't know in an hour of knowing they don't know but isn't that horrible I mean that's a that's the worst condition to be in don't know now if you if you if you like the scripture John 5 and verse 24 the Bible said he that heareth my word he that heareth my word brother Bram said believeth on him he said the correct word right there is understandeth he that understandeth he said anybody can hear it but he that understandeth watch the righteous shall understand the spirit of wisdom shall bring understanding you see what he's doing he's bringing understanding of the word into the church there is your power it lies an understanding your power to live Above This altar is to understand you were son to begin with the power to live Above This is adoption the power from being one day you're lost and one day you're saved and one day you're lost and one day you're St one day brother bram's right the next day you're not sure he's right amen one day I belong to this church and now I don't know if I belong to this church you see what you're doing but if you come to this position of understanding you'll see truth and the truth of this hour will bring you into manifestations of your life what is it amen it's bringing understanding now watch Ephesians turns into John 5 and 24 he that understandeth now watch John chapter 14 let's go again to the 16 verse John 14 and: 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give unto you the comforter and that you may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth it that something that John 14 is now tied into Revelations 3 in Daniel 12 knoweth him because you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you let's continue that scripture I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you next verse and yet a little while the world see me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and this is a famous one in the church and at that day the day when the Revelation is made known the layad Deans know it not but at that day ye shall know oh Church you're not children of Darkness this morning this is not sneaking this is not sneaking on the church but it's the children of light what is it it's actually the time when the church should know you should more than anything you should know where you belong you should know your position in Christ you should know this is the message of the hour you should know I am a part of that Daniel 12 righteousness maybe maybe maybe in your personality maybe in your situations you fail but that faith is always existed there is something in you that in the low moments of your life you've knew it's right when you couldn't point to your own ability you could point and say I know this message is right when things are falling AP heart in your life and and this person goes that way and that person goes but something in you said that's still the truth I can't help it because something in me has given me an understanding that God has visited me listen I pray this morning that the reality of this scripture breaks over our lives that God has given unto us this age an understanding in this word for the season that we're living and by this exposure of the devil brings the church exactly where they're supposed to be in the word you see what it is Satan is here in Matthew 24 the Bible said that that that this spirit will be so close that would deceive the elected if it were possible it would deceive if it were possible I love brother Brandon when he says that he ties together then he said elected means election he said then if you have elected he said you cannot be deceived isn't that beautiful then the spirit of delusion will come in the loudness in ag but you will not be deceived false prophets shall come but you will not be deceived false teachers will come but you will not be deceived what is it God has given to the church an understanding to lead them out my when I think about the grace of God that has come to lead out the church you see every time God does something Satan does something at the same time every time every time God does something Satan does something at the same time and when God opened up these seals Satan come out against it with a Lies when brother brandham said it means this and it means this and it means this Satan come out against it with lies he does it every time now watch watch watch the if you watch the scripture all of those kingdoms come in one is that right all those kingdoms come in one but it's just the power of God that destroys those four when you go to the Book of Revelations the 6th chapter the horse riders all gather together but there's only one Eagle that reveals the whole thing the eagle reveals it to bring light to the church now to think this morning that there is a spirit in this age of delusion that has beg to lead this world to an Armageddon friends this is no joke people are going to go to an Armageddon I know that sometimes when I was young I I heard uh ministers Minister and it made it sound like the bride was going to Armageddon but let me tell you brother Bram announced the greatest battle ever fought it's going on now Armageddon that you're going to see you're seeing right now we're not going to be here for arm the greatest battle that was ever fought already been water it's fighting right now brother way when that pressure comes it's here sure the squeeze is already on pressure is already there I don't think I'd have to preach on that this morning I think anybody in here can testify truth quickly sure it's already it's already in the midst of the church now every time in Revelation 16 watch the scripture I want won't be much longer I hadn't been very long to start with but I won't be much longer in Revelation 16 watch the scripture because the Bible said in the 13th verse I saw three unclean frogs like out of the mouth of a dragon out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for there the spirits of the devil working miracles go forth under the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of the almighty Revelation 1613 and 14 so what brother Ram says is whenever the seals are revealed that's when the frogs come out so he says what it is is they're Looking Backward to those trinitarian doctrines so brother Bram went in and taught the truth of godhead and they look back to see what somebody taught in a future age or a former age so when they looked back they looked back in their teachings and then they refused what the message was bringing and it was a spirit of the lying devil to lead the people people to an Armageddon because had they believed the message it was the spirit of truth leading them to a Rapture listen friend this morning I believe that there is a spirit released in the church today that is leading the church unto the Rapture and being that is leading it's the head this message is the head won't you stand to your feet with us toight today this word is the head to the body what an hour to live huh never been a time friend never been a day like this one can you imagine living in a season that Daniel was seeing that John was seeing that Paul was seeing and every one of them longed to see this day and then there's so much pressure on us there's so much pressure on us that we look back and say I wish I had lived in another day friend you're living in the greatest day amen but you got to break out of it you got to break out of that anxiety and depression and those little isms and situations and you see what God is doing he's leading right I just love the scriptures the way it's written because the Bible said that John was in the spirit on the Lord's day that's this day all this darkness and I can point you to a scripture that said it was possible for a man to get in the spirit of Revelation isn't that beautiful John never recorded all the problems of that season he recorded the revelation of Jesus Christ cuz I want to tell you this morning where you're going to find power is in Revelation Revelation is a prevailing power over your life come on when you when you know you're standing there this morning you've born of a woman and every man child every person sitting here is a few days and full of trouble you're full of mistakes you got a cuckle bir nature there's a seed on the inside and Paul said the things that I want to do I don't the things I don't I do so I find something that is true evil is always present with me now I don't want to shock you but brother Bram said that's the one on the outside see taste smell feel and hear so there's an evil one wherever you go whatever you do but there is another man in there and he was ordained before the world ever began and when this message comes over you it opens the eyes of that one that's in you that is greater hallu there's a son and daughter in there on the inside of you and this message has come to Quicken that and to feed that and establish that and put you in a position where you can stand right here this morning and with all these troubles going on you know exactly where you are and where you're going what a prevailing time what a prevailing time amen isn't he a merciful god today right in the word of God Amen I I Hope This Book of Daniel study is okay with you guys um I I preach more sometimes than I'm probably going to do in this but I I just I've personally been studying this and I it it so so blessed my heart that I wanted to share it with you your prevailing power it's in Revelation can we just bow our hearts this morning I wonder brother Braham said it like this that we should pray for Revelation more than we do anything else it was written in the scriptures seeking first the kingdom of God now father it is certain without a doubt that this great Stone this word will return in a it'll end up in a Corporal body upon the Earth for a millennial Reign but Lord it don't even stop there you said it would turn into the New Jerusalem and after the great battle of Gog and Magog there'll be a bride live throughout eternity upon this redeemed Earth and a red [Music] body father what we have begun there is no ending where we're at today is only the beginning of a new life now father I ask you today that may you come into this building and Quicken the understanding the heart of your people Lord father if there's one here this morning that maybe there's something that just seems Lord beyond the grip of understanding I pray Lord that we would just ask you this morning that may you come in and Open the Eyes Lord let us see you in your word let us see you as you have hid Through the Ages you've you've hid from Scholars Lord You've hid from great wise men but you would reveal yourself in the last days and we would see you sitting there in your word Lord with all its power and all of its Glory now I ask you this morning Lord touch this meeting touch these people father as we commit it into thy hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you there has never been aive that shines so bright as this day GL to Glory [Music] thank you Lord there has [Music] been a oh won't you thank the Lord for putting me in this kind of day to me there has never been a day like this day I see has never been alive that shine so so bright as this day this [Music] Glory Day
