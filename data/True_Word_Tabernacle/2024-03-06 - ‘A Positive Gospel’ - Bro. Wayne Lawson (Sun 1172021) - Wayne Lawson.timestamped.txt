[2:04] looking in the book of Corinthians uh we
[2:07] want to uh look in 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:11] 14 amen we're just going to maybe to um
[2:15] take something from here this morning
[2:17] one scripture 1 Corinthians 14 and verse
[2:20] 8 um if I've been listening to this tape
[2:24] a little bit lately just been on my
[2:26] heart and and I'm praying the Lord would
[2:28] give us a little something from that
[2:30] would be a blessing to you 1 Corinthians
[2:33] 14 and verse
[2:36] 8 for if the
[2:38] trumpet would give an uncertain
[2:43] sound who should prepare himself to the
[2:48] battle amen we ask the Lord to bless his
[2:50] word as you could be seated um this is
[2:53] very common uh scripture reading among
[2:56] the church and the people and uh brother
[2:59] brandom made it a very popular scripture
[3:01] among the message people having preached
[3:03] it several times um he he said a lot of
[3:06] things through this scripture and um I
[3:10] just want to maybe share a couple things
[3:12] that has just really stuck out to my
[3:13] heart and U and we just want to uh say
[3:17] we want to welcome everyone this morning
[3:18] God bless you and and to the visitors
[3:20] that are here God bless you uh we we
[3:23] want to say that we certainly thank God
[3:25] for his mercy and how that he is able to
[3:28] bring us amen and I would just sitting
[3:31] there listening to the song service this
[3:32] morning and I had this trumpet sound on
[3:34] my mind and I thought you know it's
[3:36] amazing amen what God can do with music
[3:38] and how he can bring sounds and feelings
[3:41] and and deliver things through it and
[3:44] and I sitting there thinking about it
[3:45] and I and I did want to take time this
[3:46] morning we don't do this often but uh we
[3:49] do want to take time to say God bless
[3:51] you all and we thank you for your uh
[3:52] your worship and the atmosphere here in
[3:54] the church a lot of times we just come
[3:56] the platform and just take off preaching
[3:58] and y'all have to forgive forgive me for
[4:00] that because what it is actually is I
[4:01] get a little nervous if I sit and talk
[4:03] to you and so I got to get in here where
[4:06] the anointing is and then it takes me
[4:08] out of the way and then I'm okay um but
[4:10] so I I usually just go straight to it so
[4:12] never take it as a slide or that I'm
[4:14] that I don't want to speak to the people
[4:16] it's more just about nerves than it is
[4:18] uh if the gift kicks in then we then we
[4:21] take off you know and uh so um we we
[4:23] want to say that and I I was just
[4:25] thinking this morning though about the
[4:26] church and about the the resilience of
[4:29] the people uh to to worship despite uh
[4:33] the issues in the land and the trials
[4:36] and troubles and to come on a Sunday
[4:38] morning and see the church full and the
[4:39] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and and
[4:42] those things don't just happen and so we
[4:44] want to say that we appreciate the men
[4:46] of God and you know and brother Ray for
[4:49] leading and and making a way for the
[4:51] atmosphere to be here it it's a real
[4:53] blessing to our heart to serve with him
[4:55] and and to be with him and under him as
[4:57] a pastor and we appreciate him greatly
[4:59] and uh I'm just thinking about the song
[5:01] Services even this morning and and I
[5:04] don't think we say it much but we
[5:05] appreciate you brother Ben for all you
[5:07] do amen for the
[5:16] songs there's a lot of work goes in this
[5:18] and and we we know he does a lot of
[5:20] other things too but but we really
[5:23] appreciate him for the worship here in
[5:25] the the church and the musicians and so
[5:27] it's it's a real blessing there's a lot
[5:29] going on here and we we sure appreciate
[5:31] lot in the back you know with the
[5:32] deacons and the trustees and there's a
[5:34] lot of work so we do want to just stop
[5:36] once in a while and say that that is
[5:39] that thank you these things are not
[5:41] going unseen they may go unsaid but
[5:44] they're not unseen and we just want to
[5:45] say God bless you and um and I I I
[5:48] thinking of this this morning I was just
[5:50] thinking of the sermon and and what from
[5:52] from the things that I'm gathering from
[5:54] this and I just I just want to speak to
[5:56] you a little bit today and I want to
[5:58] talk to you about a p positive gospel uh
[6:01] I want to talk to you about a positive
[6:03] gospel and in saying that uh I don't
[6:06] want you to relate it to the charismatic
[6:09] world and the way that they view things
[6:11] but but I want to talk to you about a
[6:15] positive gospel that's the very thing
[6:17] that that I would have on my heart and
[6:19] to say something like to say positive I
[6:21] want to say it this way something that
[6:24] ex that is expressed clearly it's
[6:27] something that is fully assured
[6:30] it's something confident it's actually
[6:33] independent of changing
[6:35] circumstances uh it's it's uncontestable
[6:38] or incontestable it's positive it's uh
[6:42] not fictitious it's real uh it's active
[6:45] and effective the word positive actually
[6:48] means effective in social economic
[6:50] function rather than just merely
[6:52] maintaining peace and order but it's
[6:54] something that's positive or something
[6:55] that's active uh it's something that
[6:58] directs moving toward a source of
[7:01] stimulation positive is the higher
[7:04] electric potential consisting the part
[7:06] from which the current flows to external
[7:08] circuits the positive see a positive
[7:11] role model A positive influence a
[7:14] positive point of view it's uh if you
[7:17] pick up some of the synonyms it means a
[7:19] sure a certain a positive meaning having
[7:23] no doubt or
[7:25] uncertainty when you think of sure it
[7:27] stresses the subject of intuition
[7:30] feeling or Assurance see you felt sure
[7:31] I'd forgotten something but certain May
[7:34] apply to a basis of a conclusion or a
[7:38] conviction on definite grounds of in uh
[7:41] disputable evidence say something you're
[7:44] certain about or something you're
[7:46] positive about see certain is to be
[7:49] fully confident it means to be positive
[7:52] as something's going to be certain way
[7:54] having a real or beneficial effect or
[7:57] result they took a positive action got a
[8:00] positive experience it's unquestionable
[8:02] it has positive proof it shows an
[8:05] acceptance or an approval it's
[8:08] positive and I believe that the message
[8:10] that we are preaching today I believe
[8:12] that it is a positive gospel I don't
[8:16] believe that we have anything that's
[8:18] uncertain in the word of God that we are
[8:20] following after we're not here this
[8:22] morning in this I hope so or I think so
[8:27] or maybe so or it could be so or I think
[8:30] it's like we're talking about a positive
[8:33] gospel something that you can take your
[8:37] soul and you can rest your Eternal
[8:40] salvation based upon the things that are
[8:43] being said the things that we and branam
[8:45] said are not a shifting sand they're not
[8:48] ifs and ANS and bunts and maybe but it
[8:51] is a positive absolute truth that comes
[8:55] from almighty God can I say it this way
[8:57] it's not just a truth it is the truth
[9:01] it's not just a way it's the way it's
[9:05] not just an idea it's the truth it's the
[9:08] way it's the life it is Christ it's
[9:11] positive you know we're looking at a
[9:13] world right now if you listen to Prophet
[9:15] speaking a trumpet sound 63 there if a
[9:18] trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother
[9:19] Bram actually is in the uh the the um
[9:21] he's actually in the Fallout of the
[9:23] elections during this time which of
[9:25] course it very well parallels with our
[9:27] exact timing he said the fall out of an
[9:30] election and he goes into the elections
[9:31] and talks about how that these elections
[9:34] are happening and he's talking about
[9:36] people who invest themselves in these
[9:38] elections and he said how disappointed
[9:40] they have become in the way the
[9:42] elections turned out and the way things
[9:44] are happening and it's odd because the
[9:46] way he's bringing this he said see there
[9:49] is no certainty in politics and then he
[9:52] moves from politics and he says now
[9:54] there's no certainty in home life and
[9:57] then he moves to religion and he said
[9:59] and there's no certainty in religion and
[10:02] then he moves to the church and he says
[10:04] there's no certainty in the church he
[10:06] says but the time brother Bram gets down
[10:08] he actually he actually begins to say is
[10:10] there
[10:11] anything because if you listen the first
[10:13] 20 minutes of the tape you would wonder
[10:15] does he believe there's certainty in
[10:17] anything amen but you know he does
[10:20] believe in some certainties and uh the
[10:22] trumpet gives an uncertain sound in in
[10:24] the paragraph 60 he'll say this he says
[10:26] now I I'm trying to tell you the things
[10:29] of the earth is shaking and you can put
[10:32] no confidence in them they're uncertain
[10:35] and anything that's uncertain I'd just
[10:38] rather leave away from it he said and
[10:42] anything that's uncertain just leave
[10:44] away from it I don't like that negative
[10:46] thing I don't like to get mixed up in
[10:49] the negative side I like it
[10:53] positive be on the positive side I like
[10:57] it positive you know I thought it was
[10:59] powerful because here's a prophet with a
[11:01] platform could pretty much say anything
[11:03] he wanted amen because God was backing
[11:05] him up and he says what I'd like to do
[11:08] is keep it positive I'd like to stay on
[11:10] the positive side do you know that
[11:12] brother BR said in 56 he said that
[11:14] Christianity has no negative nothing in
[11:17] it it's everything absolutely positive a
[11:20] man that becomes a child of God has a
[11:23] positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has
[11:26] a positive hold on him with the
[11:28] assurance by the almighty God by an oath
[11:30] of himself that he will raise him up in
[11:32] the last day and take him to Glory
[11:35] there's no if ands or nothing amen it's
[11:38] something that is positive you know many
[11:41] times Christianity is actually
[11:43] misrepresented Christianity can be
[11:45] represented many times Christianity is
[11:47] represented as religion it's represented
[11:49] as orders it's represented as Traditions
[11:52] but the prophet of God said Christianity
[11:54] is is misrepresented to people he said
[11:57] Christianity has been represented to the
[11:59] people as a declaration of creed he said
[12:02] but Christianity is a living
[12:05] being it's not a declaration of Doctrine
[12:08] it's not a declaration of my thoughts
[12:10] and my ideas but Christianity is a
[12:13] living
[12:14] being Christianity is a living being can
[12:18] you listen to what he's saying he says
[12:20] it's a living being it's Jesus Christ
[12:24] the resurrected God that's alive Among
[12:27] Us right now
[12:29] my goodness amen he'll say it again in
[12:32] 1954 Christianity is a living being in
[12:35] mankind that's the proof of his
[12:38] resurrected God's son who was God With
[12:41] Us amen and hear ye him he'll say that's
[12:44] the way real Christianity is it's a
[12:46] living experience I like that don't you
[12:49] it's a living being it's a living
[12:51] experience and he'll explain what he
[12:53] means Pentecost is not a denomination
[12:56] but Pentecost is an experience
[12:59] that anybody can have if they wish to
[13:01] have it it's something that you
[13:03] experience it's the Holy Spirit
[13:06] Christianity is a living being
[13:08] Christianity is a living experience
[13:10] Christianity is Pentecost not a
[13:12] denomination but it's a Vindicated proof
[13:15] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ you
[13:17] know you have no other way to prove the
[13:20] resurrection of Jesus outside of the
[13:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen a
[13:25] Pentecostal experience is a Vindication
[13:30] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ my
[13:33] to think about it today it's an absolute
[13:35] amen then there's got to be an absolute
[13:37] there's got to be a positive amen now in
[13:40] the absolute brother Ram says it like
[13:42] this I think now that we need something
[13:44] positive I think that we need something
[13:46] we can hold on to it's true it's a
[13:49] crucial hour amen we must have something
[13:51] that we are positive that's right
[13:53] something that we can hold on to now how
[13:57] is the case going
[13:59] he said according to Webster an absolute
[14:02] is an unlimited in power it's an
[14:04] ultimate it's an ultimate it's an amen
[14:06] it's the absolute that's the end that's
[14:09] everything now every great achievement
[14:11] that's ever been in the world has been
[14:13] tied to some sort of absolute you cannot
[14:16] do anything unless you have something
[14:19] that you can hold on to Now isn't it
[14:21] beautiful because he's preaching in
[14:24] uncertain sound and he starts letting us
[14:26] know that it's something that is certain
[14:28] and he preaches the entire message of
[14:30] the absolute to guarantee to you that
[14:33] he's saying I'm preaching this because I
[14:35] believe you need something positive you
[14:37] need something that is certain something
[14:40] that will not be changing on you
[14:42] something that doesn't transition with
[14:44] the times you know that's the thing I
[14:46] hate about politics it changes I mean
[14:48] like one day it's this and the next day
[14:50] it's something else it changes with the
[14:51] times it changes with a crowd it changes
[14:54] with a mindset amen but there is
[14:56] something that's not going to change on
[14:59] you there is something that you can put
[15:01] your reputation you can build your life
[15:03] you can build your family and that what
[15:06] we're looking at this morning the
[15:08] prophet of God said is there anything
[15:10] searching is there a place that I can
[15:13] call final is there a place that I can
[15:15] say there's not going to be any changes
[15:17] to this is there a place that I can
[15:19] bring you this morning that says things
[15:21] are not going to change the way they are
[15:23] is the way they always are going to be
[15:25] and he said yes there is a place there
[15:28] is a place we can go it's the certainty
[15:31] it's the word of God and God has given a
[15:34] word in this age amen I don't care what
[15:36] comes I don't care what goes churches
[15:39] come churches fall men come men go but
[15:43] the word of God remaineth forever and
[15:46] ever amen Ministries does not remain
[15:49] forever amen men does not remain forever
[15:52] churches does not remain forever
[15:55] kingdoms does not remain forever but the
[15:57] word of God God it remaineth forever
[16:01] there shall be no end to this amen if
[16:04] you build on this I tell you what a
[16:06] prophet said I'd rather be standing on
[16:08] the word of God Amen than standing in
[16:12] heaven my what a place to stand what an
[16:15] hour to stand something that is positive
[16:18] a place that you can stand that is
[16:20] certain in Matthew 24 the heavens and
[16:23] earth shall pass away but my word it
[16:26] shall not fail God has a certain
[16:30] Foundation my to know there is a place
[16:32] to build Amen in in Low Country in in
[16:35] bottom country people wor about building
[16:37] their houses no place to build they
[16:40] build them they do everything they can
[16:41] do to sh them up the best they can amen
[16:43] but there is a place and Jesus said he
[16:46] can build on the Rock Amen the rock of
[16:49] Revelation the rock of Truth in numbers
[16:51] 23 and 19 amen it's a beautiful reading
[16:54] the 19th and the 20th verse the Bible
[16:57] said God is not a man that he should lie
[16:59] and neither the son of man that he
[17:01] should repent and he that he shall not
[17:04] do it or hath he spoken and he shall not
[17:07] make it good for behold I received a
[17:10] commandment to bless and he hath blessed
[17:12] and I cannot reverse it in Psalms 19
[17:15] and7 the law of the Lord is perfect
[17:18] David's singing these songs I love
[17:19] David's songs for the law of the Lord is
[17:22] perfect to the converting of the soul
[17:25] the testimony of the Lord is sure making
[17:28] wise the simple in Psalms 89 and 34 for
[17:31] my Covenant I will not break nor alter
[17:34] the thing which has gone out of my lip
[17:36] you mean there's somebody that can say
[17:38] something to you that won't alter what
[17:40] they say there is some there is a being
[17:43] somewhere there is an instrument
[17:45] somewhere that can say something and it
[17:48] not be altered after it comes out of
[17:50] their lips whatever they say you can
[17:52] take it to the bank you can you can take
[17:54] it and build your life you can run all
[17:56] over the world and say this is true
[17:58] because it won't be altered God won't
[18:00] pull it back and change it on you my to
[18:03] think I I want you to hear me there's
[18:05] something that you can get a hold of
[18:07] that they won't change it on you after
[18:09] you get started with it this message is
[18:11] the most amen the most sure thing that
[18:14] has ever come into your life God ain't
[18:16] going to pull it back God ain't going to
[18:18] change his mind about it God ain't going
[18:20] to quit backing it amen this message
[18:22] will take you all the way to Glory it's
[18:25] good amen it's good all the way to Glory
[18:28] it'll get you in the door when you get
[18:30] there it'll get you past the Judgment
[18:32] bars there is something that will not be
[18:35] altered my when I when I get to reading
[18:37] these Scriptures it just kind of it just
[18:39] grows up with Amen in Isaiah amen he
[18:42] begin to say Amen of course proverbs 30
[18:46] amen we got to get Solomon in here the
[18:48] wisest men in the world every word of
[18:50] God is
[18:52] pure and he is a shield unto them that
[18:55] put their trust in him in Isaiah 40
[18:58] eight the grass withereth and the flower
[19:00] fadeth but the word of our God shall
[19:04] stand forever in Isaiah 55 this is a
[19:07] powerful one to me so shall my word that
[19:10] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[19:12] return unto me void but it shall
[19:16] accomplish the thing which I please and
[19:20] prosper in the thing were unto I sent it
[19:23] amen that's the word of God you let me
[19:25] let me just say this to you when it
[19:27] comes out of God's mouth when the word
[19:28] comes out of his mouth he cannot alter
[19:30] that word amen to make it fit a certain
[19:33] situation now I've been around enough
[19:35] so-called prophets and they prophesy a
[19:37] little something amen and then they they
[19:39] say it vague enough that they can make
[19:42] the the they can make their prophecies
[19:44] turn to the events you know they they'll
[19:47] just trim things up and they'll turn it
[19:49] around amen they'll they'll alter it
[19:51] enough to make it sound like they really
[19:52] knew what they was doing all the time
[19:55] amen but you recognize God don't have to
[19:57] do that amen When God Says something the
[20:00] thing were unto he sent it that word
[20:02] doesn't change or alter until it become
[20:05] accomplished I don't care how long the
[20:07] word is there it will perform what it is
[20:09] said I I think of the greatest the
[20:11] greatest thing that ever was when
[20:13] brother Bram stood there and said in the
[20:15] beginning he created the heavens and the
[20:16] Earth he said it could have been a
[20:18] million years when God said it let it be
[20:21] light it could have been a million years
[20:23] before light ever came but when God said
[20:26] it it had to come was a settled matter I
[20:29] think of Isaiah the very one who said
[20:31] this in Isaiah the 7th chapter preaching
[20:33] on a Sunday morning would have been a
[20:35] Saturday evening probably at that time
[20:37] but the prophet of God said he was out
[20:38] there preaching amen he and he was he
[20:40] was get got under the inspiration and he
[20:42] never took thought of what he was saying
[20:44] he' just become a channel and and he
[20:47] heard himself utter Behold a virgin
[20:50] shall conceive he said had he ever
[20:52] thought about it he would have never
[20:53] said it but he had already become a
[20:55] channel a prophet is a channel and the
[20:58] word come directly through him and begin
[21:00] to prophesy a it's powerful because he
[21:02] said a virgin shall conceive do you know
[21:04] that it was over 700 years it was over
[21:08] 700 years that that word circled the
[21:12] Earth amen that word Isaiah prophesied
[21:15] and for it is close to 700 years I don't
[21:17] know the exact date but it was almost
[21:19] 700 years it circled the Earth amen
[21:22] until a 16-year-old girl was standing
[21:25] next to a well one morning and that word
[21:28] amen that had went out of Isaiah was
[21:31] actually not the word of a prophet it
[21:32] was a word of God and it was a sure word
[21:35] an unchanging un altering word it was a
[21:37] word of Salvation a word of power a word
[21:40] of Truth it was a positive word a virgin
[21:43] shall conceiv I don't hope so don't
[21:46] think so maybe so maybe God will find
[21:48] somebody maybe somebody will raise up
[21:50] and believe the word it was a it was a
[21:53] positive word that that that God was
[21:55] going to come into the womb of a virgin
[21:58] even if it took 700 years before it
[22:01] happened that word circle the Earth
[22:03] until it dropped into the womb of that
[22:05] little woman amen glory to God think
[22:07] about this in Genesis the 1 third
[22:10] chapter it was God that said the woman's
[22:12] seed shall bruise the head of the
[22:15] serpent I don't think so hope so maybe
[22:17] so but the woman seed shall bruise the
[22:20] head of the serpent and there he was the
[22:23] woman's seed amen it was the virgin's
[22:25] child it was Jesus Christ which was the
[22:28] sure word of God manifested in the Life
[22:32] M to think about it this morning amen
[22:35] that there I'm going to get ahead of
[22:36] myself but I just got to say it amen
[22:38] there's been a word prophesied there's
[22:41] been a message prophesied over the
[22:43] Church of the Living God there coming a
[22:45] bride without spot a Rinko or any such
[22:48] thing I I've heard I heard Paul prophesy
[22:52] amen that there will be a people that's
[22:54] going to change their body they're going
[22:56] to take on incorrupt
[22:58] they're going to put off mortality and I
[23:01] believe amen that that same gospel has
[23:04] never changed but it's been waiting
[23:06] looking for a
[23:09] bride and that's the seed that we're
[23:12] prophesying over you this morning amen
[23:15] that's why we can't get off of the Seven
[23:17] Seals that's why we can't get off of
[23:19] Amen of the god sending a prophet and
[23:22] the message of the hour because it is
[23:24] the seed in the season that we are
[23:26] living in this is a sure word that's
[23:30] going to change the body of
[23:36] somebody
[23:40] wo I'm talking about a positive gospel
[23:43] I'm not talking about something amen
[23:45] that that come out of some Almanac I'm
[23:47] not talking about something amen that
[23:49] come out of some school or out of the
[23:51] mind of some man but this is the Eternal
[23:53] logos of God who thought of you before
[23:56] the world ever began
[23:59] I was just reading yesterday and the
[24:00] prophet said it like this he said the
[24:02] life that was in God that thought of you
[24:06] before the world begin is in your body
[24:09] right now and there's nothing can
[24:11] separate you from it hey I tell you this
[24:13] morning it's not a Creed in me it's not
[24:16] a Dogma in me it's not a teaching in me
[24:19] it is a seed word being manifested in
[24:23] the age and the Bible said the whole
[24:25] earth was groaning waiting for the time
[24:28] of manifestation because if God said it
[24:31] amen it's got to happen we know if God
[24:33] said it just set your clock set your
[24:36] calendar amen just get ready it's got to
[24:38] come it's a positive
[24:43] word well glory to God if they don't got
[24:46] a right to praise you who does Amen if
[24:49] this bride ain't got a right to Rejoice
[24:51] who
[24:53] does
[24:54] [Applause]
[24:56] wo I believe it's time for
[25:01] it it's
[25:03] positive and there are some people who
[25:06] are positive about
[25:09] it see the word that goes out he can't
[25:12] bring that
[25:14] back he's already said
[25:18] it it's already been spoken don't you
[25:21] promise a trip to Disney World unless
[25:23] you're going to do it
[25:25] right amen
[25:30] Zach used to get me over the burel he
[25:31] loved them little flashlights he said
[25:33] Daddy can I have a flashlight say sure
[25:35] tomorrow morning he get up and say when
[25:37] we going to Walmart when we going to
[25:38] Walmart I didn't know what he was want
[25:39] to go to Walmart for I said what we
[25:40] going to Walmart for he said you
[25:41] promised to get me a flashlight yeah if
[25:44] he ever got my
[25:46] promise he knew he could hold me with my
[25:49] own
[25:52] words
[25:54] oh y'all know what I'm talking about I'm
[25:57] talking about when a King gave a man his
[25:58] last
[26:00] wish he was going to crucify him they
[26:02] were going to kill the man they gave him
[26:04] his last wish and he said what do you
[26:05] want he said I want to drink of cold
[26:06] water he said the king said well you can
[26:08] have a drink cold water he said I'm
[26:10] afraid they'll kill me before I get it
[26:11] drink he said no no he said they won't
[26:12] do that he said I promise you they won't
[26:15] take your life till after you drink your
[26:16] water so he had him bring him a glass of
[26:19] cold water the man looked at the king
[26:20] looked at the water and poured it out on
[26:21] the
[26:24] ground they had to turn him
[26:26] loose cuz he had a king's word on
[26:30] it are you hearing me Church of the
[26:32] Living God he said that he said you'll
[26:35] not die but you will
[26:37] live you'll not die you'll live you'll
[26:40] be changed in the moment in the twinkl
[26:43] of an i you said well amen I know this
[26:45] one and they died and I know this one
[26:46] and they died amen that's where we see
[26:48] difference because I believe that a
[26:50] Christian can never die I believe that a
[26:53] Christian can change dimensions a
[26:55] Christian you can bury them amen but
[26:57] brother let me let me tell you something
[26:58] there is a word that goes into the grave
[27:01] of a Christian and you'll never hold
[27:04] them Christians
[27:08] there death's got to get out of the way
[27:10] we got God's word on
[27:14] it in Titus the first chapter the second
[27:17] verse in Hope of eternal life which God
[27:19] that cannot
[27:21] lie promis before the world began in 1
[27:24] Peter 1:25 I I'd like to done a circle
[27:27] on this this one in my study but the
[27:29] word of the Lord endureth
[27:31] forever and this is the word which by
[27:34] the gospel is preached unto
[27:37] you this is the thing whereby the gospel
[27:39] is preached unto you the word that
[27:42] endureth
[27:45] forever think of this and this this in
[27:47] Revelations three sums it up and unto
[27:49] the angel of the Church of to see a
[27:51] right these things saith the
[27:54] amen the faithful and true Witness
[27:58] the beginning of the creation of God BL
[28:01] to see a church age book brother B goes
[28:02] very much through this point but he says
[28:05] that he is the god of the amen he goes
[28:08] book to the back to the book of Isaiah
[28:10] and said he's the god of Truth and
[28:11] brother B said that's not a good a good
[28:13] hold on that scripture he said the
[28:15] better way of saying it he's the god of
[28:17] the amen he's the soate to the word of
[28:20] God he's the one that said it he's the
[28:22] one that'll amen it are you amen I I
[28:26] I'll tell you this I know there's a lot
[28:27] of good Ministries and a lot of good
[28:28] preachers but I only know one of them
[28:30] that can stand up in the platform amen
[28:33] and give you the thoughts and patterns
[28:35] out of the scripture and when he got
[28:36] done he would say now if I'm telling you
[28:39] the
[28:40] truth then the one that wrote it will
[28:43] come here right
[28:46] now and God it was one thing brother
[28:48] Chris I said amen and you said amen amen
[28:52] but the beauty of it is is in William
[28:54] brandom's meetings God said amen God
[28:57] would come right down in there and say
[28:59] amen he would back up those word are you
[29:02] hearing me and I believe today I believe
[29:04] if a man's going to preach this same
[29:06] message that the same God of the amen is
[29:08] alive today the same as he ever was I
[29:11] don't believe that we just had to have a
[29:13] bunch of dry intellectual sermons I
[29:16] don't believe we have to just be a Creed
[29:18] and dogma and a teaching and a Doctrine
[29:20] I believe that the god that wrote this
[29:22] Bible and come into the house of God and
[29:25] back up this Bible with an inspiration
[29:28] and a power I don't have to explain to
[29:30] those young people why you can't
[29:32] experience God I don't have to explain
[29:34] to y'all that God changed since I was
[29:37] saved but I believe that the same God
[29:39] that saved me will give you a Salvation
[29:42] will give you the Holy Ghost the same
[29:44] God Amen that brought light into my soul
[29:47] is still as much light right now as he's
[29:49] ever been oh if we could just get out of
[29:52] the way if we could just get out of
[29:54] God's way what could God actually do
[29:59] he's still Amen in
[30:02] sermons and brother brandom actually
[30:04] said before a man come to the pull pit
[30:06] he ought to meet the pillar of fire on
[30:08] the back side of the
[30:13] desert cuz he is
[30:16] faithful he is the god of the
[30:18] amen he is the truth you know it's a
[30:22] beautiful thing brother bam says these
[30:24] words I think they're powerful he is
[30:26] true to himself
[30:28] he won't
[30:30] lie concerning this scripture brother R
[30:32] said this the faithful and true witness
[30:36] he is true to himself he won't
[30:39] lie he is true to his word he will back
[30:43] it
[30:45] up and he is true to us he will lose
[30:49] none of
[30:52] us my he's a true God he's true to
[30:56] himself he's true to his word and he's
[30:57] true to you amen it's a positive it's a
[31:01] certain amen do you know the prophet
[31:04] uses Philippians to say this be
[31:06] confident of this very thing that he
[31:09] which begun a good work will perform it
[31:10] under the day of Jesus Christ be
[31:12] confident let me just let me just
[31:14] interchange the word I'm preaching this
[31:16] morning be
[31:17] positive be sure be confident that the
[31:20] god that began it he's able to finish it
[31:24] God is not a beginner and not a finisher
[31:26] but our God is a finisher when I think
[31:29] about this this just this just strikes
[31:32] me when you hear a prophet say things uh
[31:34] that that are so clear in how he says
[31:37] them in certain sound he says or in
[31:39] uncertain sound he says it this way it's
[31:41] not an uncertain
[31:43] sound God cannot give an uncertain
[31:49] sound
[31:51] amen God cannot give an uncertain sound
[31:56] amen
[31:58] now some people are uncertain now does
[32:01] that now you have to ask yourself is
[32:03] that God or is that your
[32:06] training is it God or is it
[32:08] training amen we find out that God
[32:11] cannot utter an uncertain sound brother
[32:14] BR said Creeds have an uncertain sound
[32:16] yeah denominations can preach an
[32:18] uncertain sound but God cannot utter an
[32:22] uncertain sound this is the word of God
[32:24] and it's no uncertainty about it it's
[32:28] certain 1 Corinthians 14 if the trumpet
[32:30] would give an uncertain sound who could
[32:32] prepare for the battle in other words
[32:34] Paul is took this to the military in
[32:37] Ephesians Paul said you got to dress up
[32:38] as a warrior put on the whole armor do
[32:41] you see Paul is relating your life as a
[32:44] Christian as to a soldier in an army
[32:47] he's letting you know this you not come
[32:49] to a picnic now he's letting you know
[32:51] this is not a picnic this isn't a this
[32:53] isn't playground that this is an actual
[32:56] battle now you can have peace times in
[32:59] the middle of battles it's like when
[33:01] you're in base camp or when you're in
[33:02] training camp amen and you almost forget
[33:05] there's a battle going on because God's
[33:06] given you a time of training and then
[33:08] you get back in the battle amen but
[33:10] don't waste your moments of training
[33:13] thinking amen that everything's going to
[33:15] remain that way because there's coming a
[33:17] battle very quickly and he's just
[33:19] preparing you for what's coming ahead to
[33:21] that you're going to have to face now
[33:23] Paul is speaking of this and he's saying
[33:26] brother B says it's the scriptures like
[33:28] training a soldier to a
[33:31] sound that's what God is doing he's
[33:33] training you to a sound and it's the
[33:36] sound of a trumpet now of course we know
[33:39] that he's talking about a gospel trumpet
[33:42] amen he's talking about a gospel trumpet
[33:44] you know that's the sound that that John
[33:46] heard Amen in in Revelation chapter one
[33:49] when he was caught up he said I Heard a
[33:51] Voice as it was the sound of a trumpet
[33:54] it was clear and distinct other words a
[33:58] voice a sound of a trumpet something
[34:00] that was clear and distinct and brother
[34:02] R says what is it it's a trumpet it's a
[34:04] gospel trumpet and what is the gospel
[34:07] trumpet for it's for a person it's for
[34:10] Gatherings it's for war and in this case
[34:13] amen the trumpets that we have heard
[34:15] amen are a gospel Trumpet Of course
[34:18] there's a trumpet that sounds to Israel
[34:20] which is for a political disturbance but
[34:23] the trumpet that sounds in the church is
[34:25] for a spiritual
[34:27] disturbance isn't that beautiful God
[34:29] sounds a trumpet for a spiritual for a
[34:33] spiritual disturbance and we actually
[34:35] sometimes think well all hell is against
[34:37] us but we've kind of sometimes if we're
[34:39] not careful we forget really which
[34:41] direction this is going because actually
[34:45] the message of the hour has declared war
[34:47] against Satan the prophet of God said
[34:50] there has been a battle of Truth down
[34:52] Through the Ages he said where every
[34:54] messenger represented a trumpet like
[34:56] Paul all all the way to the to the
[34:58] messenger of Malachi 4 they each one
[35:01] have a trumpet and they sound as a
[35:03] partial amen throughout them ages amen
[35:06] but brother R says see but because in
[35:08] the Battle of Truth things are lost in
[35:10] that battle he said but when it comes to
[35:12] that seventh trumpet he said he's going
[35:14] to blow that trumpet and declare war on
[35:17] every lie the devil has told amen can
[35:21] you imagine the message has declared war
[35:24] on every false Doctrine in every
[35:27] scripture amen do you recognize why the
[35:29] dark is getting so dark do you know do
[35:32] you really know why because light is
[35:34] pressing on it amen it wouldn't be that
[35:36] dark If the message hadn't come but the
[35:39] message is the light that has pressed
[35:41] Darkness into the corner amen it is it
[35:43] is caused it to press itself together
[35:46] and it's caused a unity in the darkness
[35:48] amen but there is also a unity in the
[35:50] light amen and this gospel trumpet
[35:53] begins to sound and amen I'm I'm just
[35:55] going to preach to you a minute but I'll
[35:56] say this amen there're soldiers being
[35:58] trained now amen for this greatest
[36:01] battle that's ever been fought amen
[36:03] that's the battle we're in isn't it
[36:05] beautiful when you take them seven
[36:06] Messengers and you see a trumpet per age
[36:09] amen and how they sounded but do you
[36:10] know when it comes to that seventh one
[36:12] do you know that he doesn't just sound
[36:14] one trumpet but all trumpets sound under
[36:16] that one message that all the Thunders
[36:18] will sound under that one voice it's one
[36:20] voice but it's seven Thunders it's one
[36:22] trumpet but it's seven trumpets it's
[36:24] seven Messengers he's collect ing the
[36:27] truth amen from the time of Paul all the
[36:30] way to the day we're living that's why
[36:32] amen I don't know how many of you know
[36:34] but amen they're actually claiming
[36:36] brother brandham has taken Lin and he's
[36:38] trying to plagiarize Lin but you know
[36:40] that's such a lie from the devil amen as
[36:43] if as if Lin had all of his things from
[36:46] inspiration and it was this great
[36:48] prophet brother man trying to copy him
[36:50] amen Lin received his things from men
[36:53] before him from from they took things
[36:55] from Paul and irus he took things from
[36:57] Martin and and you can see exact phrases
[37:00] that Lin took from other theologians in
[37:02] his time and he laid those things out
[37:05] but he couldn't come to conclusions he
[37:07] couldn't make conclusions on certain
[37:09] things because he wasn't positive he
[37:12] wasn't certain of what it was going to
[37:14] be amen but when a messenger come he had
[37:17] a trumpet of God and he would have a
[37:19] certain sound and it would settle it for
[37:22] the bride of Christ you see amen William
[37:24] brandom took everything lck and said and
[37:27] and put it in a little jar and said it
[37:29] in a couple sermons but he went on to
[37:32] say things that Lin had never understood
[37:35] at the world had never understood but he
[37:37] didn't just say them he said it with a
[37:40] trumpet of a certainty that declared war
[37:43] on every ungodly
[37:46] thing oh come on Church of the Living
[37:48] God there's times you got to declare war
[37:50] there's times that the enemy has
[37:52] possessions of yours and he's put them
[37:55] behind walled cities amen and as long as
[37:57] you're a peace with it as long as you
[37:59] don't get bothered by it the devil will
[38:01] hold them as long as you can let them be
[38:03] held amen but you know that a trumpet
[38:05] also sounds for Jubilee it also sounds
[38:08] for Jubilee so the seven trumpets were
[38:10] war and they were also Jubilee but do
[38:12] you know in the Jubilee a person behind
[38:14] a wall City couldn't come out in Jubilee
[38:17] they couldn't come out amen but do you
[38:19] know there was a little girl named RAB
[38:21] that was in the city of Jericho amen and
[38:23] she belonged to God and she belonged to
[38:26] God before the world began she
[38:28] represented this bride that was caught
[38:31] behind the walls of denomination and
[38:33] hoard them amen that that her parentage
[38:36] had put her in but when God met the the
[38:39] very King of Kings amen when Joshua met
[38:43] the captain of the host the orderer amen
[38:45] the great one that could order
[38:47] everything that could sound a trumpet of
[38:50] of complete Victory he told Joshua you
[38:53] take the Army amen and you put them in
[38:55] order and you March around the walls of
[38:57] Jericho do you know they marched seven
[38:59] days in silence do you know they marched
[39:02] seven days in silence every day amen
[39:05] they marched every day and the only
[39:07] thing they do is they blow a trumpet
[39:09] amen they would March and they would
[39:10] blow a but there was silence they wasn't
[39:12] able to do anything amen but in that
[39:15] seventh day it was to March seven times
[39:18] and they marched and when they marched
[39:19] seven trumpets begin to blow and when
[39:22] the trumpets sounded seven consecutive
[39:25] sounds there was a voice that come into
[39:27] the bride and she be to shout and when
[39:30] she begin to shout the walls begin to
[39:33] come down listen these trumpets have
[39:36] unified a voice in The Bride of Jesus
[39:39] Christ and the Bible says with one voice
[39:42] they begin to Rejoice they begin to
[39:44] shout and the walls begin to come down
[39:47] do you see what it is if Raab if you're
[39:49] caught behind the wall God don't have to
[39:52] get you out from behind the wall God can
[39:54] tear the wall down he's a god amen
[39:57] that'll keep his word there was a
[39:59] promise that had been given amen those
[40:01] Messengers had give a promise and it was
[40:04] a certain promise when this City's
[40:06] destroyed you and your family will be
[40:08] saved and when God knocked down those
[40:10] walls those trumpets led the children of
[40:13] Israel and they brought in a gentile
[40:16] woman let me tell you this amen there's
[40:18] a spiritual trumpet to the Church of the
[40:20] Living God but we call them seals and
[40:23] under the seventh seal God revealed the
[40:26] mysteries of the entire Bible that gave
[40:29] the bride a certainty on serpent seed a
[40:33] certainty on water baptism a certainty
[40:36] on the godhead we are not a confused
[40:39] people that's why I am not ashamed of
[40:42] the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is a clear
[40:46] sounding positive
[40:51] gospel you might think I'm crazy but I'm
[40:54] not ashamed amen I am confident that the
[40:58] message of William brandom is the sound
[41:01] of the trumpet of God that is prepared
[41:03] the bride to give her a
[41:07] voice and you know what I think it's
[41:09] time I think it's time to declare war on
[41:11] every wall upon every disease upon every
[41:15] denomination we ought to declare war
[41:17] this morning and say Satan amen you've
[41:20] held it for your last day you've held it
[41:22] for your last
[41:25] time
[41:26] I'm talking about something
[41:32] positive tell you why people aren't
[41:34] positive because they ain't
[41:35] sure they ain't confident they're
[41:38] ashamed because they don't
[41:39] know but there should be no excuse of a
[41:42] bride not knowing this
[41:45] morning now a
[41:48] soldier trained to a
[41:52] sound a positive sound a clear and
[41:56] distinct
[42:00] sound now the trumpet the word of God
[42:04] the Living God is the trumpet don't mix
[42:07] nothing with it he says now
[42:10] listen the thing is is that when you
[42:12] start training people to a sound that is
[42:16] actually what's been going on with with
[42:19] with with your lives for the last years
[42:22] now from the message you you Pastor come
[42:25] up here and take a few things and he'll
[42:26] say now we're going to read this and
[42:29] what he's doing is he's putting
[42:31] something in you that is a
[42:34] training that whenever you hear the
[42:36] gospel you'll know what it means when
[42:39] somebody reads the scripture you'll know
[42:41] what it means you you're you you got to
[42:42] you're you're being
[42:44] trained you're not miss being trained to
[42:46] a teaching you're trained to a sound and
[42:50] it's a distinct clear this is the word
[42:53] of God now you're being trained now
[42:55] watch
[42:56] and and in training sometimes you wonder
[42:59] if things are
[43:00] necessary brother Bram pulls this out
[43:02] and in trumpet uncertain sound he talks
[43:04] about the soldiers being trained in the
[43:06] military and he said they have them out
[43:08] there stat side he said they have a 90
[43:11] lb sack on their back a metal helmet on
[43:13] their head and a gun in their hand
[43:15] combat boots on and they're running down
[43:16] the road 10 mile or whatever he said and
[43:19] they're all looking at each other going
[43:20] why is this
[43:24] necessary anybody shooting at us they
[43:26] know why is this necessary see and and
[43:29] and the prophet of God said that's the
[43:31] devil's
[43:33] job is to reason the word like the word
[43:36] says you need the baptism of the Holy
[43:37] Ghost the Devil comes to say is that
[43:41] really necessary is it really the
[43:44] prophet of God said see if the
[43:46] government is going to issue not one
[43:49] thing unless they know you're going to
[43:51] have to use it you must train for that
[43:54] they find the best thing they can to
[43:56] protect you because they're interested
[43:58] in the nation you see that they're
[44:01] interested in the nation so they're
[44:02] trying to get you to survive because
[44:04] they're interested in the Kingdom now
[44:06] the prophet says this and Satan then
[44:08] comes around with a reason power and
[44:10] Satan know the loophole that was a place
[44:12] to get the people to break down the
[44:14] easiest was at reasoning so they don't
[44:16] they don't say that it's not there they
[44:18] just say Let Me Reason with you is it
[44:20] actually
[44:22] necessary if God said it it's necessary
[44:27] whether we have to he said whether we
[44:29] have to cry and boohoo and do all these
[44:31] things listen is it necessary to come to
[44:34] an altar and cry and boohoo and pray and
[44:37] shout and rejoice and sing is it
[44:39] necessary brother R says it like this he
[44:42] says whether we have to cry or boohoo or
[44:43] do all this he said if God said the
[44:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost is necessary I
[44:49] don't care how heavy it is or how much
[44:52] the world you have to give up you're
[44:55] going to have to use it one of these
[44:56] days to stay
[44:58] alive it's the only way of your
[45:03] survival it's amazing to me people today
[45:06] are actually asking those questions is
[45:09] it necessary is it necessary to have
[45:12] these meetings where people are getting
[45:13] in and the power of God and and and and
[45:16] I know there's a lot of names been
[45:17] placed on it Pentecostalism and and and
[45:20] and a bunch of bunch of Pentecostals and
[45:22] it's like it's a bad name these days I
[45:23] don't understand but anyhow that it that
[45:26] it stole this black name to it like it's
[45:27] a shame amen but but what they're
[45:30] actually saying is the way they're
[45:32] acting is not necessary but a prophet is
[45:34] saying if God sent it it don't matter
[45:36] how heavy it is you need to pack it
[45:39] because you're going to need it for
[45:40] survival now watch this and brother Bram
[45:42] he shows the contrast between the modern
[45:45] church and the church at Pentecost that
[45:47] come out of the upper room he said when
[45:49] these Brethren came out of Pentecost up
[45:51] there they were convinced now this is in
[45:53] a message convinced and concern see the
[45:55] pattern
[45:56] they were convinced he says and they
[45:58] were convinced that he was all they
[46:01] needed and they were convinced that's
[46:04] all the people needed he said and I'm
[46:06] convinced of the same thing so some
[46:09] people are wondering if it's necessary
[46:11] but brother brandom said the disciples
[46:13] said it's not only necessary it's the
[46:15] only thing necessary you can throw off
[46:18] everything you got but don't throw off
[46:20] that Holy Ghost it's the only thing
[46:23] necessary that brother B said they
[46:24] thought it I think it I believe it's the
[46:26] way it ought to be hey he and let me
[46:28] just say it like this let me add my
[46:30] voice to the prophets I know a lot of
[46:32] people say well it's in the message we
[46:33] don't have to preach it amen but I'll
[46:35] say it like this oh god brother R am I
[46:38] am I okay amen I I just say it like this
[46:40] I have to just be honest I think we got
[46:42] some cowards raising up in this message
[46:44] they want to stand behind the tape
[46:46] recorder and push it and run off
[46:47] somewhere amen they want to push it and
[46:49] talk about something they want to push
[46:51] play and run off and let the prophet say
[46:53] it and they don't want to stand with it
[46:55] amen but if if a prophet said it I'm
[46:57] ready to stand with you you can shoot me
[46:58] full of holes you can take off my head
[47:01] you can tire and feather me but let my
[47:04] voice stand with his voice let it Circle
[47:07] up in heaven today I believe this
[47:10] message is the truth I believe that the
[47:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a necessary
[47:15] thing before you can ever be
[47:18] saved I don't believe you can learn
[47:20] Doctrine and be saved I don't believe
[47:22] you can agree with me and be saved I
[47:24] believe you've got to receive the
[47:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a
[47:27] positive proof of the death burial and
[47:30] resurrection of Jesus Christ my I
[47:32] believe you got to remain on the word of
[47:34] God I believe you got to stay there on
[47:36] it amen it ain't changing it's not
[47:38] variable it's not going away if God said
[47:40] he gives the Holy Ghost and you don't
[47:42] got it yet stay on the word of God it
[47:44] don't matter amen stay right there if it
[47:47] takes you 5 years 10 years if it takes
[47:49] you 5 minutes or 10 minutes the Holy
[47:51] Ghost already came 2,000 years ago amen
[47:55] the only thing you're looking for is
[47:57] stand on the word until you receive the
[47:59] experience that God gave it and the
[48:02] reason you don't hear many men preach it
[48:04] is because they' never been there and
[48:06] they don't they're not confident that
[48:08] God will show up amen but I was there
[48:11] the night that God came to that Altar
[48:14] and gave me a Divine
[48:17] experience so I can assure you every
[48:20] young person in this building if you
[48:22] wrestle with the angel of God there is a
[48:24] God that can touch back as a God Amen
[48:27] that can give you the Holy
[48:30] Ghost I know they they try to talk me
[48:32] out of telling my my testimony in Europe
[48:35] they said don't tell that testimony
[48:36] we'll have kids trying to get an
[48:37] experience I said praise God let's tell
[48:39] it everywhere then let's tell it
[48:41] everywhere at the pillar of fire can
[48:43] show up visible in a church and fill you
[48:46] with the Holy Ghost I don't know if
[48:47] that's how he'll do it but he will I
[48:49] don't know how he will do it but the
[48:51] Bible said if you repent and are
[48:54] baptized in the name ofes Jesus Christ
[48:56] for the remission of your sins you shall
[48:59] receive a gift of the Holy Ghost that
[49:02] ain't something to laugh at that ain't
[49:04] something to ridicule and talk about and
[49:06] to bad mouth that is the necessary
[49:09] experience before a man can go in the
[49:13] Rapture and I declare war on every devil
[49:17] and every reasoning spirit that says
[49:20] it's not necessary in the hour We're
[49:22] living I say Amen that unless we're
[49:24] going to preach what Paul preached amen
[49:27] but Paul said it if I or an angel come
[49:30] and say any other thing let him be
[49:37] cursed well I don't know if the Holy
[49:39] Ghost is for today that's not
[49:42] God I don't know if you can get them
[49:44] kind of experiences now I I tell you
[49:45] back in the
[49:47] day that ain't that that's not
[49:50] God no sir not my
[49:53] God you want to we need a positive
[49:55] example I I love positive
[49:57] influences and Jesus is the greatest
[50:00] example I know and he even said I do
[50:03] these things as an example for you
[50:06] brother BR said what did he do he said
[50:08] when the devil come to him in his power
[50:10] the devil was in his height and Jesus
[50:13] was in his weakness he come and tempted
[50:15] him on the on the scripture and Jesus
[50:18] right backed right up to the
[50:20] word and he said it is written look what
[50:24] he done he come back to a certain he
[50:25] didn't stand out there and argue with
[50:27] that devil he come right back on the
[50:29] word and said it is written and he stood
[50:31] right there on it is written and while
[50:34] he was standing on it is written look
[50:36] the prophet of God said see that's the
[50:37] thing that's certain is the promise you
[50:40] got to keep going back to the promise
[50:42] you don't go back to well I think this
[50:43] or I feel like it could be this way or I
[50:45] don't know why this ain't happening you
[50:47] got to go back to the promise that's the
[50:49] example that God showed us listen if God
[50:52] already said it brother B said it like
[50:53] this how can these things happen happen
[50:56] see how can we get a watch what he's
[50:57] going to say how can this happen how can
[50:59] we get a bunch of people together with a
[51:00] Rapture and Grace to go up he said I
[51:02] don't know but he's going to do
[51:03] it now that's a prophet I don't know but
[51:07] he going to do it now if we're not
[51:09] careful we'll try to sound smart and
[51:11] explain that how he's going to do it
[51:12] brother BR said oh I don't know how you
[51:13] do it but he'll do
[51:15] it it's just
[51:17] simple it's just certain he was certain
[51:19] he was going to do it listen this
[51:21] anointing of Elijah this Elijah spirit
[51:25] amen was actually an example now I want
[51:26] you to notice in the time of judgment
[51:29] that God told Elijah he said you go down
[51:31] to the brook sherith for I have
[51:33] commanded the Ravens to feed thee there
[51:36] and brother R picks this up and he says
[51:37] Elijah I might send some
[51:40] Ravens he said see he said no I will do
[51:43] it he said so it's all already done he
[51:47] said see it's not a it's not I'm going
[51:50] to try or H uh he said it's already done
[51:52] he said now that's our God he's already
[51:55] done it he's already done it he will he
[51:58] might probably he will he's already done
[52:00] it see I have commanded the Ravens to
[52:04] feed you there now look at this he he
[52:06] immediately takes that to the scripture
[52:10] and said and God has commanded his
[52:13] spirit and his Blessing to the church so
[52:16] he's actually commanded it towards you
[52:18] not just like Elijah I I command the
[52:20] Ravens to feij you he said he has
[52:22] commanded his spirit and his Blessing to
[52:24] the church that's why it says that he
[52:26] has commanded brother B said this is
[52:28] unto your children and your children he
[52:29] said see the trumpet has done sounded I
[52:32] believe it you see he's saying when the
[52:34] word said it it was a trumpet sounding
[52:36] and God can't pull that back so he's got
[52:39] to bless somebody he's got to commend
[52:41] somebody he's got to bring life to
[52:43] somebody in Acts chapter 2 amen it it is
[52:46] Peter who says that you shall receive
[52:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost and this is a
[52:50] promise now in Mark 16 watch the trumpet
[52:53] after he appeared on the leaven after he
[52:55] appeared unto the leaven as they sat and
[52:57] ate meat and he abraded them with their
[53:00] unbelief and the hardness of heart
[53:01] because they believed not which he had
[53:02] seen after him after he had risen in
[53:04] other words he was getting on to him
[53:05] because they wouldn't believe in the
[53:06] testimony of the ones that had saw him
[53:08] amen and he was telling them this but
[53:11] now look he appeared to them in a
[53:13] positive
[53:14] body now now the body he appeared to
[53:16] them had died had been buried and had
[53:19] been resurrected it had already went to
[53:21] the father and come back again and this
[53:23] was what was talking to him
[53:26] them men were hearing from a positive
[53:28] source and he was telling them amen he
[53:31] said unto them go in the world and
[53:32] preach the gospel to Every Creature he
[53:34] that believeth is baptized but he that
[53:36] believeth shall be damned he that
[53:37] believeth not shall be damned and these
[53:40] signs shall follow them that believe for
[53:42] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[53:46] what that wording they shall they shall
[53:49] cast out devils not a hope so maybe so
[53:51] they shall speak with new tongues right
[53:54] now today somebody speaks in tongues
[53:56] somehow that that that's some kind of
[53:57] major crime I I I I I I don't figure
[54:01] this out the Bible said they shall speak
[54:02] with tongues but now if you speak with
[54:04] tongues somebody your label is a
[54:05] Pentecostal and oh he's just after the
[54:07] gifts what maybe he's after the
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:11] giver and The Giver gets so
[54:15] real now I I y'all got to forgive me I
[54:17] read the message there I read it a lot
[54:20] and I read what William brandom said
[54:22] that in the upper room when the
[54:23] quickening power come rise and son just
[54:25] in case you wonderers 1965 he said it
[54:28] didn't only Quicken their
[54:29] soul he said it also quickened their
[54:33] bodies and that's why they shouted and
[54:35] danced and run in the street and become
[54:37] drunk he said it quickened their
[54:39] language and they had a Heavenly
[54:41] language it wasn't something to ridicule
[54:43] and talk about and fuss about it was a
[54:45] Heavenly language are you hearing me
[54:48] Jesus himself spoke for tongues on the
[54:54] cross well glory amen I thought somebody
[54:57] like that amen do you see what it is
[54:59] they shall speak with tongues they shall
[55:01] cast out Devils does he do it I've seen
[55:04] him do it does he heal the sick he said
[55:07] they shall recover I've seen him do it
[55:10] I've seen God with my own eyes heal the
[55:13] sick raise the dead I've seen people
[55:15] speak with tongues and prophesy I've
[55:17] seen the power of God come upon them
[55:19] listen I want you to know I'm
[55:23] certain I'm positive that he'll do it
[55:27] again now this this sound of this
[55:30] trumpet goes out and brother BR says the
[55:32] thing is a lot of people hear it he said
[55:35] but my sheep
[55:36] know my voice look at that word know my
[55:41] sheep are not uncertain about this my
[55:45] sheep the Sheep of God are not uncertain
[55:47] concerning this matter they know my
[55:49] voice they know amen they know my word
[55:52] brother B actually says it a voice a
[55:54] trumpet a word word a certain sound he
[55:56] said my sheep actually know it he said
[55:58] look at them disciples when they come
[56:00] down they sing that word manifesting in
[56:02] Jesus he said they know that was sheep
[56:04] food he they know that was the trumpet
[56:07] so sheep food and trumpet are now the
[56:09] same thing they know that was sheep food
[56:11] they know it was certain he said my
[56:12] sheep no amen they seen the word of God
[56:15] being manifested when they seen the word
[56:18] living in someone they didn't question
[56:20] what was happening in them they were
[56:22] certain that was the promise of God
[56:24] coming into that individual isn't it
[56:26] beautiful he tries a trumpet and he said
[56:28] my sheep know my voice the sound of the
[56:31] trumpet because it's the Bible see now
[56:34] in the end of the paragraph he'll say it
[56:35] like this real sheep listen for that
[56:37] they listen for that
[56:40] positive the the Sheep of God listen for
[56:43] that positive see now years ago when I
[56:46] first come on the field uh the Lord
[56:48] actually I don't know I don't want to
[56:50] say it wrong but I I God actually
[56:52] commissioned me years back it it and and
[56:54] I was preach the gospel but when I was
[56:57] first went into the Evangelical world
[56:59] and preaching uh I I I didn't feel like
[57:02] just a regular evangelist the way
[57:03] brother Bram said things about how they
[57:04] should preach and what so I I didn't I
[57:07] didn't understand because my Ministry
[57:08] was a little bit different than the
[57:09] other brothers I was hearing and I was
[57:11] thinking I was I was thinking well maybe
[57:12] I'm just out of place or I was all you
[57:14] know and so you know how you do in the
[57:17] young Ministry you stagger a little bit
[57:18] you go this way and you and so I was
[57:20] kind of curious and questioning and one
[57:22] day I was listening to uh the Bible
[57:24] there and and The Book of John and after
[57:26] the resurrection when Jesus comes to
[57:28] Peter and he says to him do you love me
[57:31] remember he's about three failures he
[57:32] says do you love me and Peter said yes
[57:34] Lord he said Do You Love Me He said Yes
[57:36] Lord he said do you love me and third
[57:37] time he said thou knowest and and when
[57:39] he said it three times I thought Lord
[57:41] I'm a whole lot about my brother
[57:43] Peter I feel like I failed you a couple
[57:45] two or three times myself amen but the
[57:48] the next thing he said was if you love
[57:50] me feed my
[57:52] sheep if you love me Fe feed my sheep
[57:56] and and and and it was like a it was
[57:58] like something come on me amen that then
[58:00] I understood I didn't care what you call
[58:02] me or what put what kind of tag you put
[58:04] on me I knew that I was actually asked
[58:07] of the Lord to take the message and feed
[58:10] the sheep of God and so all over this
[58:12] place in different countries and
[58:14] everything I was preaching this message
[58:16] and I and I found out why I found out
[58:18] the thing that I was supposed to be
[58:20] feeding the prophet of God said this he
[58:22] said the food that they're looking for
[58:24] is life life a real sheep is looking for
[58:27] life and that's the only thing that has
[58:30] life Jesus said my words they are life I
[58:33] am the way I am the truth and I am the
[58:37] life do you see what the Sheep food is
[58:39] it's not just intellectual educated he
[58:42] never said if you love me educate my
[58:44] people he said if you love me feed my
[58:46] sheep and what is sheep food it's the
[58:49] word of God manifested watch when Peter
[58:52] come out of the upper room it was him he
[58:54] had told to and when Peter come out of
[58:56] the upper room he looked in the Book of
[58:58] Joel and he said this is that that Joel
[59:02] prophesied there was no question there
[59:04] was no maybe so but what you're seeing
[59:07] is the thing that Joel prophesied and he
[59:10] fed them that experience by the
[59:12] scripture I'll tell you this it's a
[59:14] powerful thing that I believe that we
[59:16] ought to feed on the gospel I believe
[59:18] that's what happened in the Book of
[59:19] Romans amen when he spoke of Paul Paul
[59:22] spoke of Abraham and he said that
[59:24] Abraham never even staggered at the
[59:26] promise he never even staggered but he
[59:28] was fully
[59:30] persuaded positive confident he was
[59:33] fully persuaded amen I I hope I didn't
[59:36] throw you off with that comment about
[59:37] feeding my sheep but but you get my
[59:39] point amen we're we're here to preach
[59:41] life we're here to preach the life of
[59:44] this message amen listen he persuaded
[59:47] him and and brother B said see Abraham
[59:49] was persuaded and wasn't ashamed to
[59:51] testify at a 100y old he was going to
[59:54] have a baby because he was positive the
[59:56] trumpet had sounded he was sure that
[59:58] that was going to happen listen now I
[1:00:00] think the thing today is that we need to
[1:00:02] be persuaded beyond the place of Doubt
[1:00:05] beyond our fears beyond our
[1:00:08] understandings we need a persuasion from
[1:00:10] the holy ghost that that thing is so
[1:00:12] true that we put our lives upon it
[1:00:14] brother BR said I'm persuaded are you
[1:00:17] persuaded amen that's the thing are you
[1:00:20] fully persuaded this morning that there
[1:00:22] is nothing else of Salvation or life
[1:00:24] amen outside of Jesus Christ manifested
[1:00:28] I'll tell you this are you persuaded
[1:00:29] brother Bram said are you persuaded that
[1:00:31] this is the Holy Ghost are you persuaded
[1:00:33] this is the way are you persuaded he's a
[1:00:36] Healer are you persuaded he's coming
[1:00:38] again are you persuaded he's the same
[1:00:40] yesterday today and forever if it's him
[1:00:42] it'll be
[1:00:43] positive listen if it's him dealing with
[1:00:46] you this will be positive Jesus said
[1:00:49] I'll tell you how the Holy Spirit works
[1:00:51] I I found it was powerful uh Thursday
[1:00:53] night brother brother U Ronnie was
[1:00:56] ministering he hit this particular quote
[1:00:58] and I tell you what I thought I'd do a
[1:01:00] backflip because that's I mean I
[1:01:01] literally had it in notes and was
[1:01:02] studying it and looking all over it and
[1:01:04] amen but trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:01:06] sound brother Bram said Jesus when he
[1:01:08] was on the Earth was standing at the
[1:01:10] grave of Lazarus and he said listen he
[1:01:12] was a discourse with the people of
[1:01:14] talking about how he yet being not 50
[1:01:16] years old said that he had seen
[1:01:20] Abraham and he said you notice how
[1:01:22] positive he was before Abraham
[1:01:25] was I am not I was or I will be but I am
[1:01:29] I'm positive then he said at the grave
[1:01:32] of Laz before he went down there he told
[1:01:34] Martha I am the resurrection and the
[1:01:36] life I ought to be not I ought to be or
[1:01:39] I will be but I am you see what he was
[1:01:42] saying not somebody like but I am the
[1:01:45] resurrection listen he was so solid of
[1:01:47] that that later look what he said
[1:01:49] there's there was nothing wavering about
[1:01:51] it there was nothing uncertain it was a
[1:01:53] positive I am the resurrection and life
[1:01:57] now whosoever look what look at how much
[1:01:59] he knew this whosoever that liveth and
[1:02:02] believeth in me shall never die that not
[1:02:05] might not that that might not they
[1:02:07] perhaps want that nothing uncertain
[1:02:10] about it they won't
[1:02:12] die he that heareth my words and
[1:02:15] believeth on him that sent me has passed
[1:02:16] from Death unto life they should not
[1:02:18] come to the Judgment he says watch now
[1:02:20] they won't come to the judgment he took
[1:02:24] my judgment and I ain't got no business
[1:02:27] there he passed from Death unto life in
[1:02:31] trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother
[1:02:32] BR said watch he said you destroy this
[1:02:35] temple in three days I will raise it up
[1:02:38] again there was nothing uncertain he
[1:02:40] know he was a person in the scripture
[1:02:43] that David spoke of he actually knew
[1:02:46] that David was talking about him when he
[1:02:48] said you can put my soul but my flesh
[1:02:51] shall Rest In Hope for I will not suffer
[1:02:53] my Holy One to seek corruption neither
[1:02:55] his soul in Hell amen and David actually
[1:02:58] had prophesied of him and brother Ram
[1:03:00] says it like this he knew he was
[1:03:03] included in a scriptural
[1:03:06] promise therefore he was positive amen
[1:03:11] now now it's amazing because you think
[1:03:13] well that was Jesus but then brother
[1:03:15] Bram stops and includes Us by saying
[1:03:19] can't we be that
[1:03:22] positive can't you and I be a as
[1:03:24] positive as Jesus was when he said put
[1:03:27] me in the grave and three days I'll rise
[1:03:29] it up again look if Jesus was that
[1:03:31] positive because he knew he was included
[1:03:34] in the promise brother Bram said can't
[1:03:36] we be that positive can't we take him
[1:03:39] for our example amen we take him for
[1:03:41] others as long as God's word said it we
[1:03:43] can be a positive about the word as he
[1:03:46] was about it amen I am the resurrection
[1:03:49] and the life and I will raise again that
[1:03:51] was his portion but our portion is if
[1:03:53] I'm the person over there in John 5:24
[1:03:56] faily verely you know what that word
[1:03:58] means absolutely absolutely positively
[1:04:01] positively that's powerful ain't it John
[1:04:03] 5:24 positive positive I say unto you he
[1:04:08] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:04:10] him that sent me hath passed hath
[1:04:13] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:04:16] condemnation but is pass from Death unto
[1:04:18] life amen you can take John 5 and say
[1:04:21] positive positive amen I have already
[1:04:24] pass from Death unto life because I have
[1:04:26] took I have took the word of God Amen
[1:04:29] there's things that you can actually
[1:04:31] know now I want I want to just in
[1:04:32] closing say this to you there is things
[1:04:35] that you can actually be positive about
[1:04:36] you can know this beforehand and I
[1:04:39] thought about this last night and I
[1:04:40] thought dear Lord amen to be that
[1:04:42] positive of what's going to happen in
[1:04:44] the future with my life with with
[1:04:45] everything that I am but do you know
[1:04:47] that the scripture is written that job
[1:04:50] in the 19th Chapter even without reading
[1:04:53] scripture caught a revelation and said
[1:04:56] that my words were written that they
[1:04:57] would be printed in a book he said that
[1:05:00] they would be Graven with an iron pin
[1:05:02] and lead and rock forever that's how
[1:05:04] certain he was about what he was saying
[1:05:06] take a pen and write this in the stone
[1:05:09] I'm certain about what I'm saying he
[1:05:11] says listen I know my redeemer liveth
[1:05:15] what was that man so certain about he
[1:05:18] was certain that the Redeemer was alive
[1:05:20] job says I know well what do you really
[1:05:22] know job I know he is alive I know my
[1:05:25] redeemer is living listen I tell you
[1:05:28] something this morning amen he knew he
[1:05:30] was alive and he knew though the skin
[1:05:32] worms would eat his body he knew in his
[1:05:34] flesh he was going to see God he knew
[1:05:36] that you couldn't keep him in the grave
[1:05:38] he knew that there was nothing that
[1:05:40] would keep him from rising up and he
[1:05:42] would say I know my redeemer liveth
[1:05:45] brother Bram said it like this I like
[1:05:47] those positive words he spoke amen some
[1:05:50] people don't think that it's a it's a
[1:05:51] good thing to speak positive I know I'm
[1:05:54] coming up I know God's going to raise me
[1:05:56] up brother B said I like that positive I
[1:05:59] think Christianity is positive I don't
[1:06:01] think there's any negative inage amen if
[1:06:03] somebody's going in the Rapture and
[1:06:05] they're going to go from this church I
[1:06:07] believe it's
[1:06:08] me I think you ought to be positive I
[1:06:11] don't mind if you go to but I believe
[1:06:13] I'm going I believe I'm going to be a
[1:06:15] part and people say well the rapture's
[1:06:17] already over no it's not I'm still here
[1:06:19] how could the Rapture go if I'm here
[1:06:22] amen because I'm positive ser and amen I
[1:06:25] might not know all my math or all my
[1:06:27] arithmetic I may not understand all the
[1:06:29] science and all the ballistics of my gun
[1:06:32] but I'll tell you one thing I know I
[1:06:34] know that Jesus rose up on the third day
[1:06:37] and I know he's alive this morning I
[1:06:39] know the power of that Resurrection has
[1:06:42] come back in the Church of the Living
[1:06:43] God to manifest his power and I'm
[1:06:46] certain I am certain that God has G us a
[1:06:49] promise now I want you to know this
[1:06:51] morning I believe you can be I can be I
[1:06:53] believe you can be just as certain as
[1:06:56] Jesus was
[1:06:57] certain you preacher how in the world
[1:07:00] can you be that certain because he said
[1:07:03] when I see the
[1:07:05] blood when I see the
[1:07:08] blood I'll pass over you now it takes
[1:07:11] you all the way back into the token in
[1:07:13] The Exodus 12th chapter it takes you
[1:07:16] back there under a Moses
[1:07:19] Ministry when Moses took the blood of
[1:07:22] the lamb and said now
[1:07:24] the judgments are coming but if you put
[1:07:27] this Blood over your
[1:07:29] doors when the death angel
[1:07:32] comes you and your house will be
[1:07:38] saved now that Daddy was positive
[1:07:42] sure that that man speaking was God's
[1:07:45] deliverer he was God's mouth
[1:07:49] peace Brother BR tells a story how even
[1:07:51] a little boy would come come and pull on
[1:07:54] his daddy's shirt or his leg and he'd
[1:07:57] say Daddy the death Angel's coming
[1:07:58] tonight are you
[1:08:04] positive are you
[1:08:06] positive that what you're putting there
[1:08:08] is the sound of the trumpet are you
[1:08:11] positive what's out there isn't just
[1:08:13] something you guys come up with come on
[1:08:16] are you positive daddy brother B said
[1:08:19] that little boy ask his daddy are you
[1:08:22] positive come on
[1:08:25] certain my life is hanging in the
[1:08:27] balance dad are you certain what you're
[1:08:30] doing has got me under the token and
[1:08:33] brother Braham said see by Moses
[1:08:36] offering the blood of a lamb on the door
[1:08:38] he said he put it visible where that the
[1:08:41] angel could see it when he was passing
[1:08:44] by the angel didn't even have to go in
[1:08:45] the house he just saw the blood now
[1:08:48] brother Bram says but watch now because
[1:08:50] it was the death of a
[1:08:52] lamb you you could not be any more
[1:08:55] positive that a lamb
[1:08:58] died than having the blood of that lamb
[1:09:00] on your
[1:09:02] door the most positive thing that you
[1:09:06] could do to prove the death of the Lamb
[1:09:08] was to display the blood of his
[1:09:11] life it was the greatest proof you could
[1:09:13] have is you could point at the blood
[1:09:16] that little boy could point and he his
[1:09:17] daddy could say right there son is our
[1:09:20] evening sacrifice and that's the
[1:09:21] requirement that God has given us a
[1:09:24] prophet do you know the prophet of God
[1:09:25] said see but today that the blood that
[1:09:29] was on that door was only representing
[1:09:31] the blood of God's only begotten son
[1:09:34] amen and today we're not taking the
[1:09:36] chemical of that blood and putting in
[1:09:38] our homes we're not putting it up on our
[1:09:40] churches he said but we're taking the
[1:09:43] life that was released in that blood the
[1:09:47] life that when it struck the Earth it it
[1:09:50] it destroyed the backbone of sin and
[1:09:53] death and Every curse and every disease
[1:09:57] do you see what it was when Jesus when
[1:09:58] Jesus let that blood one drop of that
[1:10:01] blood touch the Earth do you know what
[1:10:03] Jesus could say as he lifted up his
[1:10:06] hands he could actually say it's
[1:10:08] actually finished he could say it it's
[1:10:10] finished and I tell you what what a
[1:10:12] powerful thing to say Amen to stay it
[1:10:15] distinctly and clear and without
[1:10:17] argument and without reason and without
[1:10:20] discussion amen it's a positive
[1:10:22] statement it is finished amen because
[1:10:25] the blood was what had settled the
[1:10:27] matter amen and the prophet of God said
[1:10:29] and we could take that blood this
[1:10:31] morning amen and what can we do we take
[1:10:34] the life of the blood which is the
[1:10:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost don't you ever
[1:10:40] let somebody talk you out of it don't
[1:10:42] ever let nobody talk you out of the Holy
[1:10:44] Ghost it is the life of the blood and
[1:10:47] when it comes upon you it is a positive
[1:10:50] token that you have been saved that you
[1:10:53] have been secured that you have been
[1:10:55] assured let the death angel pass amen
[1:10:58] but I've got the token applied let the
[1:11:01] death angel come but I'm positive this
[1:11:03] morning I've got a blood over my house
