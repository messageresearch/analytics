choir immediately following this uh so if you're in the camp choir stick around for this remember the 21 and up session starts at noon again just go right to the fr in the lunch line and uh we need you to get in get your food quickly so we can stay on schedule uh cuz about right after that um at 1:30 is when the organized activities are uh I believe those are out in the courtyard like usual I think so uh and so um you're going to want to take part in that and we have a we have a guaranteed no lame activities policy here at Camp they will be fun they won't be lame or your money we'll keep your money but they'll be they'll be fun um uh and then volleyball tournament will probably the uh we'll we'll go on after this uh working around the choir best we can we'll get the rest of the volleyball bracket done and uh then after the organized activities we'll go over there and have the camper staff game and if you've never been to a staff camper game at our camp before don't miss it it's going to be a high Energy Event you're going to enjoy it uh we just like to have a good time here um and uh enjoy ourselves I think Christians should be the happiest uh freest most fun-loving people relaxed people amen not pressured people you know uh we've got the joy of the Lord so we just have a good time and keep a good spirit amen so uh that what's going to be going on today if it's your first time here what we do on Saturday morning uh we take our morning assembly and we'll just stretch it out for about an for about an hour total uh and we're going to have a time of worship now uh what I we'll have a couple specials we'll sing some songs but uh I want you to have the right idea about what we're doing this is not a concert this is not performance this is worship and so we've come together to get a one mind one Accord and make the praise and worship of Jesus Christ the center of what we're doing here so so you know uh it'll be up to you Amen to enter into it that's what it'll make that's what'll bring the presence of the Lord that's what it'll make we've always had a powerful time of worship on Saturday morning of camp but that's that's your participation amen uh uh and and this is praise you know we say we're a place without pressure and this is praise without pressure praise without pressure I'd like to uh take a moment on that that you know young people sometimes will come to a camp meeting or be in a service where the spirit of the Lord's really moving and people are jumping and shouting and everything and uh some people a little more quiet maybe or a little more reserved or maybe you just got a lot going on in your life and and you're just not maybe not feeling it in that moment and how how many's ever experienced that where that then that brings a pressure on you right you get under pressure well you know what she's she's dancing and he's shouting and that one's raising what's wrong with me and it becomes a pressure and it starts to build up and you just you get all worked up in your mind uh the presence of the Lord is not a place of pressure it's a place to let off the pressure let off the pressure it's not you know it's not uh trying to do what somebody else is doing it's just entering into fellowship with God on your in your own individual heart and you just begin to enter into that you and and before long you might be dancing too amen but you see that's that's not what we're about trying to trying to to pump people up and trying to put pressure until something happens or make you do something that's Pentecostalism Pentecostalism is when you start beating the people if you don't jump if you don't shout if you don't dance if you don't act like everybody else you're not spiritual you know that's not worship amen but worship comes from the heart amen and so th that's so don't get it twisted now we want we want freedom we want Liberty and Liberty is not me telling you what to do but Liberty is you in your heart you begin to amen you begin to listen to the word you begin to feel the presence of the Lord and you begin to say Lord I love you Lord I'm not feeling it today Lord I've been going through a lot but I love you and you're worthy of my praise amen you see worship begins and ends with the worthiness of Jesus Christ amen because whether you feel like worshiping him he's worthy of it if you don't feel like worshiping him he's still worthy of it amen sometimes uh sometimes we get the attitude like unless an Angel takes you by the hand or the presence of the Lord the spirit of the Lord comes over you so strong it just takes over your body you know that we can't dance and sing and worship and raise our hands and no no no amen that that's all right too but he's worthy of all of our praise if you've got breath in your lungs he's worthy amen of an amen and a Hallelujah and a thank you Jesus and praise the Lord isn't he worthy amen he's the only one worthy of Praise amen uh we're not here to lift up any celebrity we're not here to lift up any influencer we're not here to lift up any uh uh any Ministry any church any personality amen but we're lifting up Jesus Christ amen because he said if I be lifted up I there will be a draw and I will draw all men unto me amen he's worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of Our Praise he's the king of all Kings he's the Lord of all Lords amen he's a good god he's a Healer he's a savior he's a deliverer he's our peace he's our Victory amen he's our joy he's our dance amen he's our song He's the breath Amen in our lungs and and so we just worship him because he's worthy of it amen uh when you don't feel like it then it's sacrifice sacrifice is when you don't feel like it and you worship Him Anyway you praise him anyway cuz Jesus you're worthy you're worthy amen worthy of all blessing and honor and glory and Power King of Kings Lord of lords amen Everlasting ruler almighty God our friend our Lord our Master do you feel like worshiping him
