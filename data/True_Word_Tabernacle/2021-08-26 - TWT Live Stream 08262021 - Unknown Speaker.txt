and blessed poem tate lord what a revelation that is to be able to call you lord lord i'm reminded god of there was a woman in the scripture who approached you son of david but she had no claims on you as that but when she called you lord she touched the master because you were her lord lord you're our lord tonight and god we come approaching you as our lord lord you're more than our savior

jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you this evening if you take your bibles we'll turn to the book of acts i know it's a midweek service and you guys have been coming out of a camp meeting and amen just having a good time and you mean i've been hearing the reports we have some of the uh some of our young people up here and some of the folks from the church back home and they were really blessed and amen i tell you just to hear the reports and know that god's still moving and amen god is still god he's still real and amen i just love the lord tonight amen appreciate brother ray amen so much giving this opportunity to uh to speak to you this evening acts chapter 3 and we'll read from the first verse you just have to forgive me i preached for brother uh jonathan a few months back and i was preaching out of acts chapter two that was a few months ago i'm just now getting acts 3 i guess so amen we'll start at the first verse now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother's womb was carried and they lay daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that enter into the temple who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple ask and alms and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave heat under them expecting to receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god and all the people saw him walking and praising god may the lord just had his blessings tonight and you can have your seats back home i've been going through a series on the book of acts and on wednesday night and so um i i'm just gonna if it's all right with you all i'm just gonna make myself at home here tonight amen i i believe that we're a book of acts church amen i believe the prophet said that if that original vine ever put forth another branch he said they'd write a book of acts behind it amen he also said he said that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts you believe that amen even satan knows this he knows that the original church at pentecost with the power of god brother brown said mark 16 in action is the church that jesus claims as his own all others are faults amen all other churches are false amen so the church that jesus christ claims as his own is the church that has the power of pentecost in it as a power amen of the word in that church amen mark 16 in acts and signs and wonders following the church and i believe that amen this bride is a is a bride that's got the power of the holy spirit in her amen i believe that she's a living bride that i believe that it's more than just intellect it's more than just a an intellectual understanding or a conception of the word but but i believe that is the power of god being made manifest brother brown said amen i'll just kind of delay a little foundation for the thought tonight and by the way i'm going to speak to you tonight on such as i have such as i have there's very important because amen you can't give something to somebody else if you ain't got it amen you notice amen when peter and john went to the gate called beautiful amen they could only offer the man there what they had amen such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ and i believe that's why we need some men of god in the pulpit that's got the baptism of the holy ghost amen i believe that we need some preachers that's got a revelation of this message amen because how can you preach something that you've never experienced or how can you give it to somebody else if you ain't got it amen i thank god for some men like ray erickson and amen some andrew glovers and wayne lawsons and even jonathan martin's brothers even all you other brothers here tonight amen amen the reason why you can preach amen this message and the power that you preach it is because you've experienced the god of this message hallelujah and the reason you can preach and experience with christ is because you've had an experience with christ hallelujah amen such as i have give i thee now notice this brother brown and i'm i'm just going to lay a foundation i'm not going to hold you alone but i i might preach a little bit if that's all right but the prophet said in the message of acts of the holy spirit he says he said right off they went speaking of uh the apostles there after the day of pentecost said right off they went just as hard as they could go preaching the gospel peter and john two ignorant unlearned men passed through the gate called beautiful amen the devil said well now if they're just out there preaching it won't hurt anything but when they pass through the gate called beautiful and they're laid a man and the holy ghost said peter that man can be healed he's got faith amen i like how brother brown said that he said the holy ghost spoke to peter and said now peter that man can be healed in other words there's something in that man that can receive what you offer him amen amen there's something in him and and and so brother brown said there's something he said he's got faith amen he says when he perceived that he had faith to be healed he said stand up on your feet and he picked him up held him up till his ankle bones received strength and away he went leaping and jumping and praising god and you know what that caused more trouble than all the preaching they ever did brother you just let something on the phenomenal side start and watch how every rogue held in hell will go hollering at it craving blood is that true i tell you peter preached a sermon on the day of pentecost 3 000 souls were saved and the devil never even moved out of his bed that's right they said oh well just let him alone see but when he passed through the gate beautiful even the next day and healed a man that big crippled from his mother's wound all hell turned loose on that's right amen they throw them in jail kept them there overnight yes sir put them in prison amen because the phenomenal see the devil said i can't let this thing get started now amen i can't let divine healing now if we do it'll really knock my props out from under me that's right because i might fool around with them a little bit on theology every now and then amen but i sure can't fool the real thing that comes out of people when they see that it's done hallelujah so the devil said i got to stop this before it ever gets started amen but i love what the prophet said he said but he never stopped it then and he can't stop it now hallelujah that's right god's gospel will move on it'll move on and on and on amen when there's no more heaven and there's no more earth the word shall never pass away hallelujah amen that word is just as immortal as god himself it can't pass away and i believe every word of it all things that jesus was he is now and always will be that's right he's the same yesterday today and forever and the same holy ghost amen this is your prophet the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost it's the same holy ghost today i'll admit it's been trampled on it's been made fun of it's been misrepresented amen everything else like that amen but that's only the devil counterfeiting amen but there is a real genuine baptism of the holy spirit that will bring the result the same results they had on the day of pentecost how many of you can say amen hallelujah amen i believe this tonight if we preach what paul preached we'll get the same results paul got hallelujah even and if we preach what william branham preached we'll get the same results that we i'm random god hallelujah the devil couldn't stop it then he can't stop it now amen but when the phenomenon starts moving amen when amen when lies begin to be touched and changed amen when it moves beyond just good sermons preached and just an intellect amen or puts them close together and it starts amen actually touching hearts and changing lives and the sick is being healed and people's getting the holy ghost and you're having means like you just come out of brother that'll turn hell upside down it'll stir the devil up hallelujah i'll tell you this and i i'm sure y'all already know amen you got the devil mad and he's doing everything he can amen to destroy the effects of that meeting already come on he'll do everything he can to put it put something on it or this happen and that happened or somebody win got a little fanatic or whatever it is he'll fight it every way he can amen but i tell you what amen i'm glad even after we have a good meeting i'm glad that we can stir the devil up so much listen church i'd hate to think that we could have a camp meeting and he'll not recognize it i'd hate to thank amen that we could have church and the devil ain't bothered by it i'm glad we got the devil mad tonight hallelujah and i tell you this the only thing it does is exposes him come on church amen you have a good meeting amen everything will go wrong a few days after the meet everything goes wrong amen you think man we just come out of a good meeting the next thing you know amen there's a disagreement over here and a problem over there and even for a long time i couldn't understand that and i always thought it was so negative even but then i began to realize as a result of that meeting and all them devils was in my church anyhow but they was hiding there and i didn't know where they were [Applause] but when the spirit of god got to moving them devils started raising up their heads and they thought they were going to stop it but all they did is lifted up their head long enough amen that we knew where they were that we could take the sword of the word and cut their head off [Applause] hallelujah well praise god maybe amen maybe the atmosphere is still moving on over amen i feel good in here tonight hallelujah amen paul said in first corinthians 2 1 he said i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god amen for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god first thessalonians 1 and 5 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance amen as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake brother brown said in the god of this evil age 1965 he said god never ordained us to go have schools he never told us to build hospitals they're good he never told us to build libraries no sir amen he said preach the gospel and the gospel is manifesting it's demonstrating the power of the holy spirit amen the faith that was once delivered to the saints he said these things that i do show you do also even more than this shall you do for i go to the father go you into all the world amen the last great commission to every minister go ye into all the world and preach the gospel what is the gospel you say it's the word not only amen paul said the gospel came not through the word only but through the power and manifestation of the word by the holy ghost to teach the word like reading the newspapers cc brother brown starts talking about he said when he went over to india amen them men amen told him when he was coming he said they said brother branham amen we we don't need somebody to come teach us theology amen they said because the bible's an eastern book and we're in eastern people and we probably know more theology amen than most of you americans he said amen they said we don't need somebody come over here and teach us theology what we're looking for is somebody that can make that bible live amen what we're looking for is somebody even not to teach us more theology amen but amen but show us and prove to us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i believe they got the right man he didn't go over there and take a bunch of theology amen he went over there and showed them the resurrected jesus christ hallelujah amen i'm not ashamed to follow this message nor the messenger amen you say well he made a lot of mistakes and he misquoted the scripture here and he he said 700 when it should have been 7 000 and all this kind of stuff even but he he told us himself he said i might not know the book very well but i know the author of the book hallelujah and i tell you this tonight amen to know him is life it's got to go beyond memorizing scriptures putting some quotes together things like that they're wonderful amen and i believe that if you love god you'll love his word don't misunderstand what i'm saying tonight amen god is his word and hearing the word are one you can't love jesus and not love his word amen but to know him is not to know a doctrine amen you've got to know him amen in the power of his resurrection the prophet said these are familiar things but amen i know i'm preaching in a church tonight that y'all believe in quoting a prophet so i feel at home amen amen the prophet god hates a powerless religion i believe we ought to hate what god hates and love what he loves if god hates iniquity and spirit we ought to hate it too and if he hates a religion they ain't got no power in it i believe we ought to hate it too ain't no wonder this world is so sick of religion you can't even blame them friends i'm sick of religion you know why they're sick of religion it's because they saw someone as fake and they they met so many people amen that claim to know christ and quote the bible and live like devils come on church amen but the prophet of god said god hates a powerless religion it's got to have power in it it takes a power to save a man hallelujah amen it's it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles even that jesus christ promised amen when they zeroed in on the word of god back there and believed it it hit the target you zero and on the same word of god it will hit the target again it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah brother brown said god wants to perform his word and even in this same quote brother brown says god wants to show himself alive amen he said he wants to work through his church hallelujah amen you know a lot of times we we you know uh come to church and and it's as if we you know are trying to uh you know uh uh make god move or you know uh it's like you know we're we're coming to the idea that we need to beg god to do something when the prophet is saying actually he's wanting to do it he's just looking for somebody that's willing to get out of his way and let him do it he wants to work in his church brother brown says saint john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also greater this right go the fight he said the church tries to deny that he said but it's still the truth you believe it watch this in the token 1963. brother brown says he said when peter and john passed through the gate called beautiful there laid a man who'd been crippled lame from his mother's womb now i want you to notice that this this man was laying from his mother went in other words he was born that way amen this was not a a problem that he got along the way but he was born that way it was a birth defect if you want to caught that way amen he was born that way from his mother's womb amen and and they said silver and gold as have i none but such as i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk see and they talk to them and know that they were ignorant unlearned men but they had taken notice of them that they had been with jesus amen see the token was there displaying such as i have seen a poor fallen brother laying there crippled disfigured and everything and the same life that was in christ was in them and they said such as i have give i thee amen and and then brother brown quotes the scripture in my name amen you shall cast out devils not i will you will if you say to this mount not if i say if you say to this mountain oh brother the hour that the token must be displayed is at hand how many of you believe that this is a token hour where the literal life of jesus christ must be on display amen we're not in the days of the keeping of the lamb we're in the hour amen when the life amen amen has got to be applied and on this way it's a token hour even you're under a token message even where a prophet said amen the time for coming together and talking about the message is over with amen we're not here tonight to debate quotes and try to figure out whether the message is inspired or uninspired or what part we can believe or not believe amen we're here tonight to apply the token hallelujah get in amen the prophet said get under this message now watch this as we just move forward in this night such as i have give out thee now brother brown said this is so powerful in 1963 he preaches a message he that is in you and brother bowman is praying a prayer now and in this prayer he said oh lord god i ask thee to be merciful to us and may every man and woman that setting present that has any kind of sickness or affliction as moses stirred himself in the breach for the people tonight i lay my heart out before you he said and with all the faith that i have that's in you that you have given me i give to them as peter said at the gate called beautiful such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and the man that was lame and weak but while they held him his ankle bones received strength and he entered into the house of god leaping and praising him blessing god see thou art the same yesterday today and forever and his apart and and the apostle says such as i have give i thee it was faith and i say such as i have give i to this audience in the name of jesus christ of nazareth renounce your sickness because greater is he that is in you than the devil that's trying to take your life you are the children of god you are the redeemed then he says i command that satan leave this people and may the god who roll back the storm the other day the god who made the winds and the ways to cease may he see to it that every disease is taken from these people and the power of christ is made manifest in their life at this hour and may every center repent may every person that's not close to you get right at this hour and may it be so in the name of jesus christ now this and this is the part i want you to get he said i as your pastor your brother with the faith that i have i have asked god to place it on you and i believe that i will see what i ask and now if you'll believe with me with what faith that i have i give to you for this hour and now in the name of jesus christ the son of god renounce your affliction renounce your sickness and say it to it you've got to go because you're you have your faith plus my faith with the power of jesus christ who is omnipresent and he's here to vindicate and prove that he is here and he will make you well at this time some of you sitting here tonight saying well man that's wonderful but that was for that audience amen you can take it that way if you want to amen but when i heard that prophet say that i said lord amen the faith that he had he's given it to me and i'm receiving it now oh come on church amen are you sitting here tonight how in the world can i get the faith amen that that prophet had the bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god hallelujah and as you receive this message you're receiving the faith of this message and i want to ask you a question what kind of faith did william branham have i believe he had the faith of jesus christ and you know why i can say that because the man had enough faith to speak things into existence and speak storms out of existence oh come on church and we're sitting here tonight you know if i could just have that kind of faith it's available [Music] you can leave here tonight with that faith in your heart if you just got enough strength to raise your hand and say lord i receive it the prophet of god said the faith that i have i give to them in the name of jesus christ and how many say amen i receive that faith tonight well if you receive it tonight speak to your storm renounce your affliction speak to the disease speak to your sickness speak to that by setting sin that's holding you back whatever is in your way tonight rise up in faith and speak to the mountain hallelujah amen because of the faith that you got and the faith that's in this message amen and jesus christ here to prove his word is true there is nothing that can stand before you tonight if thou can believe you know what's amazing to me his brother brown as soon as he gets done with that there's a lady laying there on the cot and brother bam has just quoted acts 3 and he has just applied that and said the faith that i have i now give to them and there's a lady laying on a cot and he said sister if you amen he said you can walk if you'll just try and then he says somebody help her there he said there she goes he says shrimp's coming into her ankles and that woman got up off of that cot and started walking hallelujah to prove to us that the god of the bible is still the same hallelujah and what god did he still does [Applause] hallelujah let's just go back to the scripture a few minutes and and look am i right amen let's look at this in acts three and six and peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have given thee i thee in the name of jesus christ of nature's rise up and walk and notice this and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up because a man didn't have the strength to stand up on his own amen but peter even spoke to him and then he took him by the by the hand and lifted him up and the bible says that he received strength amen amen in his ankle bones amen but but it took peter actually reaching down and lifting him up and i was just reading that just to be honest with you i didn't even preach this at my own church i was just reading it today and it just come to me even though i was singing about brother branham was telling that testimony about being in africa and any any they led this this boy up onto the platform with a chain you remember you remember the story and even under the testimony and they led this this this young man up onto the platform with a chain and he was walking like an you know on his hands and and feet like an animal and he was that way from from birth he was born that way it always been that way and when brother brown said he was born that way amen and he was completely you know just couldn't even comprehend out of his mind and amen they let him up there amen when they let him up there i've always thought this was amazing brother brown said what the boy had in his heart he was thinking of his brother who was crippled do you know that boy couldn't speak brother brown said when he even when he spoke to the interpreter the boy couldn't even understand what he was saying because he had no mental capacity to do it amen the boy couldn't even speak he couldn't even even but yet brother brown said amen in his heart amen listen church you a person can be completely and totally insane and out of their mind and yet have the holy ghost because what's going on up here don't always represent what's going on down here hallelujah that's something good for you to amen to beat the devil down with because i'll tell you where the where satan's going to always battle you at is right here and sometimes he'll defeat you in your mind because you let a thought pass through that you shouldn't have but i want to say something to the devil tonight you might have got in my mind a few times but you didn't get in my heart hallelujah because god reserved that place for himself brother brown said that boy was thinking about his brother who was a the vision broke and brother branham seen a a boy and he he said either riding a yellow goat or a dog or he said he felt he he there was a a a an accident and he got an injury and he was walking with crutches and he said then he saw the boy healed walking and when he saw the boy healed he said thus saith the lord amen the parents jumped up and said that's that's my boy that's even that's that boy's brother amen brother brown said amen the the place was so filled by a city block he said oh son here come running a boy and crutches in his hand screaming it's me it's me amen i am that boy he wasn't walking on crutches he was carrying them so then the vision breaks and brother brown sees the young man that's got a chain around his neck he's he sees that young man standing there made whole and so he said then i knew it was over he turned and he spoke to the boy through an interpreter he said he began to try to do a dance or something like there you know because he didn't understand he said but i love this in one place in particular i know for sure brother brown said so i reached down and i got a hold that chain and i lifted him up and he said as he come to his feet he stood upright for the first time in his life he said the tears began to roll down out of his eyes he said and the boy was made completely whole and when i begin to think about that brother amen i tell you amen every that's my testimony amen and it might be your testimony tonight because i was born in a condition that i couldn't walk right i couldn't talk right i couldn't even hear the word amen i had no ability or strength to get up on my own come on church but i had reached out and when i was chained down with shackles of sin a hand reached down when i had no ability to get up on my own a hand reached down and lifted me up hallelujah amen amen look at these places in the scripture that boy amen that man in acts 3 was born that way but a hand reached down even that boy over in africa was born that way but a hand reached down and you were born that way and had no hope of saving yourself but henry still [Applause] and lifted you up and some of you experienced that this past weekend and for the first time in your life you stood upright you say oh brother josh i've been walking right even though even you ain't understand what i'm saying amen for the first time in your life spiritually speaking you stood upright amen you begin to think amen amen the right thoughts you begin to realize what you were really born to be amen you're going to realize who you are hallelujah and that chain of sin that held you and the devil was dragging you the hand of god amen broke the power of sin off your life hallelujah i wasn't here but i heard about it and i heard there was some leaping and jumping and praising god hallelujah amen and somebody come along and say oh that's just another emotional worker that's just fanaticism amen take them back to the word and say no this is another acts 3 hallelujah amen and if you don't know why i'm leaping and jumping and praising god amen you don't know nothing about my past but i was born a and i never even took a step but god reached down his hand and lifted me up i got a right to praise him [Applause] i got a right to worship god [Applause] hallelujah listen to me young people don't let the devil steal that from you don't let him rob that victory from you and tell you oh it was just a motion it was just this amen this is that that was spoken by the prophet hallelujah i tell you you've got a right to worship god like no other people in no other age because the hour of king lamb worship is here and the seals has been tore off the book and you're living in revelations 5. and john is your type come on church go read revelations five when you get home and the four and twenty elders fell down and worship him and the four beasts said glory and honor and said hallelujah to the lamb but when john got started all the other ones just had to quieten down and step back amen because john said everything that was in heaven and everything that was on earth and everything under the earth heard i john giving glory and honor to the lamb of god [Applause] hallelujah and you're john [Applause] and i say can nobody worship god like this end time bride the bible said and he leaping come on church even they don't like it when we get to jumping and all this stuff you know but the bible said and he leaping entered in with him in the temple walking leaping and praising god and the people saw him praising god and he didn't care be it and the neighbors saw him he kept right on praising god and people knew who he was and all about his background amen and how he had begged and laid in the streets amen they all saw him amen and it didn't stop him anyone ashamed of it [Music] listen verse 10 and they knew it was him that set at arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement that what had happened unto him and as a lame man which was healed hell peter and john all the people ran together unto them and the porch it's called solomon's greatly wondering and when peter saw it he answered unto the people you men of israel why marvel you at this why look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we made this man to walk the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom you delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate amen when he was determined to let him go amen listen what peter did amen when this great miracle was done and they were all looking at peter and john i'll show you i'll show you the the the character of a holy ghost field man he never said look what we did and oh and god's moving in our church people and you know i tell you what amen you all need to come on over and join our group and amen and begin to take all the credit and all they say no peter peter said no he said why are you looking at me as if i have done this amen i didn't do this jesus christ the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob it is by his power that this man walks oh church amen that's what's so beautiful about men that can work together in a youth camp like y'all just had and there ain't no big eyes and little yous and somebody over here trying to take all the credit and this guy over here trying to oh come on church it's just men of god moved by the holy ghost and at the end of the day all the glory goes to jesus christ [Applause] and there ain't no preachers standing there saying look what i've done with my youth group and look at the results we had with our kids even but there's men on their face with their hands lifted up to god saying thank you jesus you got a pastor i heard him stand right here tonight and give thanks to people that worked and thanks to people that even put their joint efforts together and he gave honor where honor was due even but at the end of it all he said and it was all because of him hallelujah it was all because of him if he wouldn't have come you would have never had a meeting but jesus passed by [Applause] and peter preached to them jesus christ i i know i'm out of time tonight but if you can bear with me just a few minutes amen when they begin to spread this this testimony began to spread and amen it caused a great stir that religious bunch they began to come and say they they they actually you know threw them in into prison for the night began to question them the next day they said by what on whose name did you do this by what authority whose name even did you by what power about why by what name have you done this then peter filled with the holy ghost i'm talking about the same man that just a couple months before this was standing over there one day and said and somebody said ain't you one of them ain't you one of them followers of jesus and amen this man looked down and said no i ain't got another amen i ain't got nothing he was a denier he denied christ three times amen but a couple months later after he had went into the upper room and the bible said he was filled with the holy ghost when they began to question him down amen and say about whose authority by what power and whose name did you do these things amen peter looked right at him and he said you rulers are the people and elders of israel amen he wasn't ashamed of christ he wasn't ashamed to be identified with christ and brother if you ever get the holy ghost you won't be ashamed either hallelujah you won't be ashamed to be identified with this message come on church you won't be ashamed to be identified with a pillar of fire you won't be ashamed to be identified even with holiness people amen oh come on friends amen you'll not be ashamed to be identified with that acts 238 screaming hollered tongue talking miserable creatures that the world calls us [Applause] is for the holy ghost he said being known unto all of you and all the people of israel but that by the name of jesus christ whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here whole before you this is a stone that was setting out of your of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved how many can say amen to that tonight amen there ain't no name i'll come on i just want to say something to you tonight amen when jesus tread the wine press of the wrath of god he did it all by himself and there wasn't no pope standing with him come on friends when he paid for your salvation amen there was no prophet beside him there was no preacher standing there amen it's christ and christ alone brother when they saw the boldness of peter and john they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men amen couldn't even sign their own name brother brown said but they knew they'd been with jesus brother brown said how it's kind of people we need he said that's the kind of church that we need even that people would have to take note that we've been with jesus and beholding the bible in verse 14 says about this is acts 4 14 and beholding a man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it when they commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do these men for indeed a notable miracle have been done and it's been manifest to all them to dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it amen you know why they couldn't deny it because a man had been healed was too close by i'm on where where was uh where was all these critics writing all these books and building all these websites when brother branham was here why didn't they stand up in the meetings and say oh no that ain't how that happened in finland or amen why didn't they stand up when he was standing there giving the testimony of congressman upshaw and how the lord had healed him he'd been lame for 66 years in a wheelchair amen couldn't walk a for 66 years amen and brother brown standing up there giving the testimony and nobody stood up and said no i didn't how it happened amen a matter of fact the man that was healed amen in some cases was in the meeting one time he walked across the platform one time he says on tape amen that congressman upshaw interrupts brother branham come on church amen they could not deny that what the man was saying was the truth because the man that was healed was standing too close by you know why the devil could can't come in archer in this church and convince y'all amen that the message ain't real and that brother ben was a false prophet i want to tell you why the person that was healed is too close by it's too many witnesses [Applause] i said there's too many witnesses definitely gonna come in here tonight and tell us this message don't work definitely gonna come here tonight and tell us that god don't heal the sick no more that god don't feel with the holy ghost that god they'll still save and change hearts and lies even there's too many people standing close by that has done happen too hallelujah you know why the devil can't tell me that this message is fake he come too late because i'm like the boy in john 9. when they come to question and say amen who's this man and how'd he do this and why did he do this and how this happened he said look y'all ought to know all that amen amen you mean to tell me god sent a man like this amen you've studied the scrolls back and forth you don't know who he is amen but i don't know about all your questions i'm going to let the pressure off tonight listen to me young people and old people whoever can hear my voice or not even let the pressure off in this area you're not responsible to answer all their questions you're not responsible to prove that 16 million fell off a bridge you're not responsible even to prove where brother brennan was when the cloud picture was taken amen you are responsible to believe the message of the hour that god has delivered unto you and i might not can answer all their questions but there's one thing i know for sure i once was blind but now i see you hallelujah and i know what this message has done for me it changed my life hallelujah it's changed my children the man that's healed too close it really limits what the devil can do they said we can't deny this has happened so you know what they've done they got them on their sales and they said i'm gonna close but they got among themselves and they said they said all right we can't we can't we can't stop him we can't deny thing they said so what they've done is they threatened them and they said don't go and go ahead and y'all go we're going to let you go but y'all behave yourselves y'all want to have few street means go ahead but just don't preach in the name of jesus come on friends amen don't you know that same old spirit's still around go ahead and preach just don't quote the prophet go ahead go ahead and have church but amen just you know keep it keep it uh formal and and keep everything under control now and even y'all go ahead and oh come on now and if it ain't from that side it's coming from the other side and they say amen you know really you don't need to preach no more just play tapes and i'm being careful in these areas i'm not trying to attack nobody amen but i'm just telling you this i feel like paul tonight amen paul said he said well unto me if i don't preach paul said i'm not doing this because i wanted to do it come on church i'm not doing this brother brown even said amen against my own better judgment if he had what he wanted he wanted to go out in the wilderness and be a trapper he wasn't preaching amen because he wanted to it was by necessity is that what paul said he said i preach a necessity and woe is unto me if i preach not let me encourage every preacher in this building this ain't the time to stop [Music] this ain't the time to lay our bibles down this is not the time to quit quoting a prophet this is not the time to back up on our revelation this is not the time amen to compromise on the word this ain't the time to lower the standards this ain't a time to give in to the pressure this is the time to draw your sword and march forward and preach like you've never preached before hallelujah it's your commission preach the gospel me let me let me just let you in on something tonight to preach the gospel is not a style see people like me you know we get up and scream and holler and spit and people call that preaching and and it is amen but but preaching is more than a style because there's people that that do all that but it's just a bunch of pentecostal showmanship you hear what i'm saying it's not it's just amen uh charisma amen and they you know they got away and they've got a gift and all that kind of stuff amen preaching the gospel is when there's a power of demonstration that comes behind what you're saying amen a man could just stand behind the pulpit and and just speak words amen amen and be preaching the gospel it is not a style it's what's behind it hallelujah amen if there's something behind it amen that's what matters let me close mercy you guys forgive me but they told me and said don't preach no more in the name of jesus don't you you go and have church and you know have some gatherings and have some meetings whatever you do don't preach no more in the name of jesus and under that pressure you know they could have come under the idea which brother brown said many will fall into this trap in the end time that they'll begin to say it'd be better to serve god under that than not serve them at all so they cave into the pressure even they you know you understand what i'm saying even though they'll move into the world council of churches caving to the pressure of the of the hour even thinking that it'd be better to to serve god under that than not serve him at all but peter and john in them they were of a different breed and when the pressure come down and they said don't preach no more in the name of jesus peter and john said well the only thing is this they said shall we obey man or shall we obey god amen shall we obey man or shall we obey god amen and they made their decision right there amen we're going to obey god whatever pressure comes whatever pressure goes we're going to preach jesus christ in the power of his resurrection amen the bible said they let them go they went back and among their own people and they began to have a meeting and they began to tell them all the things that were done and said amen as they were saying that amen the bible says they all begin to pray with one accord amen they begin to quote the scripture amen of david when the heathen raged and all the amen they began to quote the scripture and even and as they began to pray even just to get to the end point now amen my bible says amen that the the holy spirit even the they were all filled with the holy ghost and the bible said even the house shook where they were the house began to shake amen and brother benham takes that and shows he said listen he said this was only a few days after they got the holy ghost even a few days later the same people that got the holy ghost and acts 2 had an axe for conference amen and it was under a great hour of persecution and pressure coming from every side even but under that pressure they begin to pray amen they begin to turn their face toward god and they begin to quote the word and the bible says and they were all filled with the holy ghost brother brown said in other words they were refilled with the holy ghost hallelujah amen and he said that's the problem we got we got a bunch of people trying to live off of yesterday's experience come on church he said you can't do it amen and some of you he may say man we had a good time in no meetings but tonight's another night you say but it wasn't just a few days ago amen but we could have an axe conference right here tonight and those of you that got the holy ghost can be refilled with the holy ghost and those of you that were refilled with the holy ghost can get another refilling of the baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] hallelujah can i just quote it the way the prophet said baptism after baptism hallelujah how many say that's what i want he said baptism after baptism he said not just one revelation just shall live by faith he said but revelation on top of revelation on top of revelation hallelujah some of y'all got a revelation amen but you can get another revelation even not a different one come on church amen but amen you can get a further part of that revelation and build from revelation to revelation and baptism to baptism and victory to victory it's available it's here you can have it hallelujah determine in your heart tonight amen how many would like to just do that make it they may make a stand and say hey no matter what comes or what goes i'll stand for jesus let the world go by amen brother amen we ain't going to back in back up give in we ain't going to bend we ain't going to bow amen the pressure might get greater come on church amen but god's grace is going to be sufficient amen amen and your faith will be increased do you believe it tonight amen amen and just like they were brother brown said what was it he called it an axe for conference he said oh god we need another axe for conference tonight amen he said not so much that god would shake the house he said but lord shake us shake us lord shake every part of our being brother branham even says in that quote he says shake our emotions amen shake our hearts shake us o god amen and i say how many of you would have that cry even tonight after a great meeting that you had let the holy spirit come and shake us one more time hallelujah how many of you desire a refilling of the holy ghost tonight the prophet of god said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost let's buy our hearts together heavenly father oh lord lord is simple preaching tonight and i know it was but lord could you just take it lord we just try to be obedient lord what you led us to maybe just be a little encouragement behind this meeting lord god i pray that you just take these few words tonight and take it and strengthen the heart of every believer lord i know how it is you come out of these things and great times with god and the enemies right there just in a few days he's right there but lord maybe they could just take a little courage tonight and push that devil back lord god maybe it could be lord that there could be a refreshing just come one more time from the presence of god lord bless your people bless brother ray lord in this church and all the efforts god the ministers are here laboring with him lord i look out in this congregation lord i see great men of god standing here and lord from the least to the greatest lord called and chosen elected lord i pray that you'd bless every one of them encourage them lord let them not be weary and well doing lord strengthen their hands lord encourage their hearts tonight to press the mark to press the battle let us preach like we never preached before let us amen the word like we've never amen before oh god give us a greater zeal and determination to serve you like we never served you before lord i pray that we run this race with patience set before us tonight granted lord god we pray in jesus name just as we turn the service over tonight let me just close with this and you know i i know and all the things going on in the world we're living in and it seems like everywhere you look it's just trouble on every side and you know and just darkness all around but let me just encourage you tonight it's always real dark right before deliverance darkest hour israel had in egypt it was right before they left in an exodus i was just studying the other day and trying to you know just praying because you know a lot of times we we pray and as men of god and these these brothers will testify this you know you're not just looking for something to preach you're looking for the inspiration of the holy spirit something that would encourage your people and give strength and you know i was just looking at my congregation and we've been going through some stuff and you know all this things with the virus and different things going on and you can just look and the people just look tired they just looked tired they're real believers and they love god but they just you just feel it you know i got reading over there and judges i got to read about gideon [Music] how god gave him a great victory and all the i was just reading through it and i kept on reading over there and brother ray the bible says that when the enemy began to flee gideon is 300 men begin to pursue there's one verse of scripture there in particular that just stood out to me because it said getting those 300 men crossing the jordan and said faint yet pursuing they was tired but they were still chasing i got so encouraged by that and i thought man that's if i ain't a picture of where i'm standing at i went to my church i said listen church we might be faint but we're still pursuing [Music] we might be tired and listen there's a difference in being faint and faint of heart because them men were retired but did none of them talk about turning back none of them was ready to quit what none of them protested saying now it's time for somebody to come take my place i've done my part i've done i've done fault as far as i can fight now it's time for somebody to come and give me some relief here no they were determined to press forward they marched slow but they marched they might not have been quite as fast as they once was but they were still going and you know what the holy spirit began to speak to me you know why they were wore out brother andrew they wasn't wore out because they was losing a battle they were actually wore out because they were winning the battle [Music] they were not tired because they had been pushed into a corner they were actually wore out because they had chased their enemy across mountains valleys rivers hallelujah listen church don't be weary and well doing tonight amen and if you're tired it ain't because the devils beat you up it's cause you got a lot of blood on your sword and you have weathered many a storm and there's a lot of people that have turned and walked away but you're still here you're still here tonight faith that you're pursuing and we ain't gonna quit until our children are saved and they all got the holy ghost and every sick person is healed [Music] and our bodies are changed and we're going home in the rapture hallelujah is there anybody with me tonight we're not giving up we're not turning around we're not going back we're pressing forward tonight [Applause] hallelujah god bless you church i love you with the love of
