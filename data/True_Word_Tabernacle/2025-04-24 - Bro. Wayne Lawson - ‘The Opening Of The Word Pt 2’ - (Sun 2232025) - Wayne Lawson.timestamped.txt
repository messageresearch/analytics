[0:00] Now today, while we're uh still standing
[0:03] here, maybe we could just bow our hearts
[0:05] for a word of prayer just before we read
[0:06] the word of God. Amen. Let's just ask
[0:09] the Lord for his mercy.
[0:11] Father, oh how our hearts are energized,
[0:15] Lord, thou son of
[0:18] man. Lord, how you have spoken this
[0:22] age in John 5 and 24. Lord, you spoke it
[0:26] and you said, "He that hearth my voice,"
[0:28] God, we've heard
[0:30] it. And not only did we hear it, we
[0:32] heard our name in it, Lord. And Lord, it
[0:35] raised us. And we're alive
[0:38] today because you live, we live also. We
[0:43] thank you for life, the greatest gift in
[0:45] the Bible. And we thank you for the
[0:48] mercy, Lord, these wonderful saints that
[0:50] you have joined around this tabernacle
[0:52] this morning, Lord, to
[0:54] believe, Lord, children, you have
[0:56] gathered under your tent, Lord. And we
[1:00] ask you today that your great mercy
[1:02] would be upon them. And as we speak
[1:04] these words, Lord, may they bless them.
[1:07] I pray the spirit of revelation would
[1:09] enter this room. Father, not a cold
[1:12] traditional sermon or lecture or
[1:14] teaching, but may the teaching of your
[1:16] mechanics have a dynamics in it. Lord,
[1:19] may it energize and spark within us that
[1:21] great revelation, Lord. Now, Father,
[1:23] we're asking you today that not only
[1:26] would you come and unveil your word, but
[1:28] Lord, while you do it, would you heal
[1:29] the sick that's among us? Lord, would
[1:32] you would you beckon them that are lost
[1:34] this morning, Lord? Father, for those
[1:36] that are needing comfort, may you take
[1:38] your word this morning and touch them,
[1:40] Father. Now, we ask it in the name of
[1:43] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen.
[1:47] God bless you this morning. If you have
[1:49] your Bibles, we'd like to go into the
[1:51] word of the Lord in the book of Daniel,
[1:53] the 12th
[1:54] chapter. And I would like to read uh
[1:57] Daniel
[1:59] 12:4. Uh we'll be reading Revelations
[2:02] 10:4 and
[2:03] Revelations 10. and
[2:06] seven. Revelations 12 and verse
[2:16] 4. But thou, oh
[2:19] Daniel, shut up the
[2:21] words and seal the
[2:24] book even till the time of the
[2:28] end, and many shall run to and fro, and
[2:32] knowledge shall be increased. Let's read
[2:34] Revelations 10 verse4. Do you know that
[2:38] brother Ram teaches us that John and
[2:40] Daniel saw the same
[2:43] thing? Revelations 10 and4. And when the
[2:46] seven thunders had uttered their voices,
[2:48] I was about to write. So Daniel had saw
[2:51] the seven
[2:52] thunders. And I was about to write and I
[2:55] heard the voice from heaven saying unto
[2:58] me, "Seal up the things which the seven
[3:01] thunders uttered and write them not."
[3:03] Isn't that amazing? Seal
[3:05] up. But in the days of the voice of the
[3:08] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[3:11] sound, the mystery of God should be
[3:14] finished as declared to his servants,
[3:18] the prophets. May God bless his word.
[3:20] You could be seated this morning. I'd
[3:22] like to speak to you this morning on the
[3:24] opening of the word. And I'm going to
[3:25] call it a part two. I don't know if
[3:27] there'll be a part three, but uh but I I
[3:30] just want to maybe just take this
[3:31] morning uh for this uh in part two of
[3:34] the opening of the word. Of course, I
[3:36] have read to you a beautiful scriptures
[3:39] uh that is concerning uh the book that
[3:41] was sealed but prophesied to be unsealed
[3:44] in the ministry of the seventh angel.
[3:47] Now, I I want to read a definitive
[3:49] statement. And sometimes when you read a
[3:51] definitive statement, it's like saying
[3:53] that you put up this great big algebraic
[3:56] uh uh math problem and then you put the
[3:58] answer on the end of it. So if you know
[4:00] where you're going before you start,
[4:02] then you know, amen that that we already
[4:05] got the problem solved. But then how
[4:07] does that come about? And here in
[4:09] visible unit of the bride in 65, brother
[4:11] man say this. He said now Paul separated
[4:14] and put the word together. Well then
[4:15] look if it taken that and he had to go
[4:18] to the desert away from his loved ones.
[4:20] Now remember and what time is it sir?
[4:22] That's what we played for you last
[4:23] Thursday. What time is it sir? He said
[4:26] you remember that he says amen. It was
[4:29] exactly right. Then we've got the
[4:32] revelation in the last days for the
[4:35] message of the Lord together the bride
[4:37] together. Now no other age has it been
[4:40] promised. It was promised in this age
[4:43] according to Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, St.
[4:47] John 14:12, Joel chapter 2 and verse 38.
[4:52] So we have the revelation. Now that's a
[4:54] very that's a very definitive thing.
[4:56] It's a very it's a solid statement. It's
[4:59] like saying the alpha has become the
[5:02] omega. See, he's he's telling you you
[5:04] may be wondering is the bride coming? Is
[5:06] she per? But when he says the alpha has
[5:09] become the omega, that should settle it.
[5:12] And then you start looking at the omega
[5:14] going, "Oh, wow. This is what the alpha
[5:16] looked like because you're thinking,
[5:18] imagining what the alpha looked like and
[5:20] then you're trying to make that fit over
[5:21] the omega." And people are not measuring
[5:24] up yet. But when a prophet says the
[5:25] alpha has become the omega, then now you
[5:29] know what the omega look like because
[5:31] you're looking at her. So now you can
[5:33] see what the alpha look like. Amen. So,
[5:36] amen. If you're still thinking the
[5:38] bride's coming, listen. Amen. You are
[5:41] the fulfillment of the vision. Amen. And
[5:43] I know you have you have fantasized of
[5:46] what those biblical characters were. But
[5:48] they were just like you. Amen. They were
[5:50] believers just like you. Ups and downs
[5:52] and ins and outs. And I know you you
[5:54] know you fantasize all these things.
[5:56] Amen. But I'll say this. If you want to
[5:58] know what the first church looked like,
[5:59] it was looked just like this church.
[6:03] The alpha has become the omega. Amen. So
[6:07] you're talking about definitive things.
[6:08] And I'll say this, we have the
[6:10] revelation. So So if we have the
[6:12] revelation that will gather the bride,
[6:14] then that revelation has already given
[6:17] in 1965. So So many times people are
[6:20] saying, "Well, we need something to
[6:22] come. We got to have this great event.
[6:24] This great thing's got to come ahead of
[6:26] us." And while they're doing that,
[6:28] they're looking for something to come
[6:30] when the thing they're looking for is
[6:32] already here. Amen. I I I'll say this in
[6:34] Luke chapter 15, I believe it is. Isn't
[6:36] that the three parables, the the the
[6:39] lost sheep and the lost coin and also
[6:41] the prodical son. Isn't that Luke 15?
[6:43] Every one of them ends with a rejoicing.
[6:46] Isn't it odd? He finds the sheep and
[6:48] there's rejoicing. And then they find
[6:50] the coin and there's rejoicing and the
[6:51] prodal comes home and there's rejoicing.
[6:53] But before they start rejoicing, there's
[6:55] something happens in all three parables.
[6:57] They quit looking.
[6:59] And as long as you're looking for the
[7:02] fulfillment, you can never rejoice
[7:04] because you have not yet realized what
[7:06] you're in possession of. But the moment
[7:08] you quit looking for it and start
[7:10] looking at it, then the revelation of it
[7:13] can bring joy and stimulation and you
[7:15] and you'll be saying, "Look at what we
[7:17] are in possession of." And that is where
[7:19] the bride's revival comes from. Amen. It
[7:22] comes from the re reality of what God
[7:25] has done in your generation. Now,
[7:26] Brother Brandham says, "See, these
[7:28] things couldn't be given until the
[7:30] appointed time. They were kept up in an
[7:32] earthn vessel." You know, he's getting
[7:33] that from Jeremiah. They were kept up in
[7:36] an earthn vessel until the time of the
[7:38] seventh angel. Now, what that meant is
[7:40] when the seventh angel comes, amen, what
[7:43] your possession is will be in that
[7:45] seventh angel. Let me just say this in
[7:47] Jeremiah. If you read the scripture,
[7:49] remember they're going to be carried
[7:50] into Babylon for 70 years. And before
[7:52] Jeremiah leaves, he sells his possession
[7:55] to a near kin, knowing that in 70 years
[7:58] when he turns and comes back to that
[8:00] land, that that near kin would have a
[8:03] right to redeem his possession. So he
[8:05] sells it to somebody that can redeem it.
[8:07] And brother Bram says, "And our
[8:09] inheritance," he said, "was in Christ
[8:12] and has been held until this earthn
[8:15] vessel comes. And then when the earth
[8:17] and vessel comes, the inheritance of the
[8:19] bride would be revealed. Now that's
[8:21] exactly what William Brandon was
[8:23] holding. He was holding the secret to
[8:26] the inheritance of the church of the
[8:28] living God. And at that time, see, it's
[8:30] going to be brought into you by
[8:32] revelations. And it will be brought from
[8:34] the hand of God by vindication. Amen.
[8:39] Now, how do you receive this message? By
[8:41] revelation. From the hand of
[8:44] vindication.
[8:47] Come and take the book, John. How do I
[8:48] take it? By revelation through
[8:51] vindication. In other words, you got to
[8:53] know it's the truth. Amen. Now, see,
[8:55] this is the thing that we find. We must
[8:57] determine and we know what it means and
[9:00] what it does. In Daniel chapter 2, when
[9:02] you read Daniel chapter 2, it talks
[9:04] about how that Nebuchadnezzar had a had
[9:06] a dream. And remember when he has this
[9:08] dream, he's a he's a great king and he
[9:10] has a dream of those of those uh images
[9:13] coming up. Amen. And he asked everybody
[9:15] to interpret the dream for him. And all
[9:18] of them has the same response. Tell me
[9:19] the dream and then I'll tell you the
[9:21] interpretation. And the king was smarter
[9:23] than that. He said, "Look, if I tell you
[9:25] the dream and then you tell me the
[9:27] interpretation, how do I know that
[9:29] you're just not making up something
[9:30] about my dream?" He said, "But if you
[9:33] really want to know what a dream means,"
[9:34] he said, "A seer will see the dream
[9:37] first and then tell you your dream and
[9:40] the answer to it." because he can't give
[9:42] away something other if he gave away
[9:45] there might be an interpretation to it.
[9:48] Now, now let me just say this. When you
[9:50] read the seventh seal in Revelation
[9:51] chapter 8, did you notice in Revelation
[9:54] six that when every seal is broken, the
[9:57] first four riders, there is a there's a
[9:59] horse coming out and it has a symbol
[10:01] behind it. And all the way through the
[10:03] six six uh uh sixth seal, there is
[10:05] symbols given when the seal's broken.
[10:08] But when Revelation the seventh seal is
[10:10] broken in Revelations 8 and verse one,
[10:12] Amen. It actually says there was silence
[10:14] in the space of half an hour. So there's
[10:16] no symbol given away at all because
[10:19] there will be no impersonations or false
[10:22] interpretations to it because it will
[10:24] take a prophet to see it, tell you what
[10:27] it is, and then tell you what it means.
[10:29] Amen. Until there's somebody can tell
[10:31] you what it is, how can you tell them
[10:33] what it means? Amen. But here's a
[10:35] prophet coming along that says, "But it
[10:37] will not be made known until it's time."
[10:40] Now, that's that's an absolute fact. You
[10:42] can just write that down. Nobody
[10:44] understood what the seventh seal was
[10:46] until it was time for it to be broken.
[10:49] Now, what is the time of that breaking
[10:52] is the time that God appointed under the
[10:55] seventh messenger. Now, when you read
[10:57] about this, brother Bam says it like
[10:58] this. The book of Revelations, he said,
[11:00] was actually written for the servants of
[11:03] God at the last time. When time is at
[11:05] hand. When the book will be revealed.
[11:08] That's right. When the book will be
[11:10] revealed. You say, "Brother, brother
[11:12] Wayne, when is the time?" He said, "The
[11:14] time is when the revelation of Jesus
[11:16] Christ has been revealed to the body."
[11:18] And Christ has been revealed, not dead,
[11:20] but alive, living among his church,
[11:22] doing the same things he did. The same
[11:24] ministry, the same gospel, the same
[11:26] sign, the resurrected Christ, when he's
[11:28] revealed by his angel into the church,
[11:33] then the time is at hand. And there's
[11:37] never been a time since that day until
[11:40] this has the mystery of Christ been
[11:42] revealed until the last few years. The
[11:45] time is at hand.
[11:48] Now, here's a prophet telling you what
[11:50] time it is. Brother Bram says, "And sir,
[11:52] is this the end of the is this the end
[11:55] time, sir?" Brother Bram says, "It's
[11:56] like a man waking up in the middle of
[11:58] the night, grumbling around for a light
[12:00] to turn it on to see what time it is."
[12:02] Amen. And you find out, anybody ever do
[12:04] that? Amen. Not now. Not in the day of
[12:06] the phone. I know, but before the phones
[12:08] come along, but Amen. You You turn the
[12:10] light on to see what time it was. And
[12:12] Brother Brandham is telling you that's
[12:13] what he's doing as a prophet. He's
[12:16] turning on a light. So you can see the
[12:18] timing that you're living in in biblical
[12:20] principles. Now God gave this by his
[12:23] angel unto John. And we covered that
[12:26] Thursday night. I won't get into that.
[12:28] But the signifying angel is the angel
[12:30] that reveals the book of Revelations to
[12:32] John. Now who is John in the book of
[12:34] Revelations? He is the bride. Right?
[12:38] John represents the b bride in the book
[12:40] of revelations. And that that message
[12:43] was to be given to John. But when it was
[12:46] given to John, it was given to him in a
[12:48] symbol form to write down. But when it
[12:51] comes to the bride who is not the
[12:53] symbol, she will get it in reality. Now
[12:56] what we find in is that the bride
[12:59] herself will be able to say the same
[13:02] thing that God has said through the
[13:04] prophet. Now if you're read Bible reader
[13:06] in Revelation 22, the Bible actually
[13:08] speaks of the bride and it said the
[13:10] spirit, the prophet and the bride is
[13:12] going to say the same thing, right? And
[13:14] what they have said will already have
[13:16] been written in the Bible, but it was
[13:19] not known until the age we're living in
[13:22] because it was in a mystery form. Now, I
[13:26] hope I'm not moving too fast. I got a
[13:28] lot in here. So, amen. So, you see that
[13:30] this is the time for the unveiling or
[13:33] the revealing. Now, the mystery, of
[13:35] course, cannot be known until the
[13:37] seventh angel sounds. So, the seventh
[13:40] seal is an end time seal. when it starts
[13:44] it will be a total
[13:46] secret according to the Bible and
[13:48] remember in Revelations 10:es 1-7 and at
[13:52] the end of the seventh angel's message
[13:54] the mysteries of God would be known
[13:57] we're at the end time the opening of the
[14:00] seven seal what's he doing he's laying
[14:02] down to you this is where we are in
[14:06] scripture amen just as Joshua placed the
[14:09] people in their promised land this
[14:12] messenger is placing you specifically in
[14:15] scripture to show where you are in the
[14:18] Bible. And he's showing you, amen, the
[14:20] very place in Revelations 10. Now, in
[14:22] Christ, the mystery of God, which I
[14:24] would entitle it the seventh seal
[14:26] revealed. Amen. You could just title it
[14:29] seven seal revealed. It's Christ is the
[14:31] mystery of God revealed, right? Amen.
[14:35] And and it's the seven seals spoke
[14:37] plainly. And brother Brandham says it
[14:39] like this because he's speaking of the
[14:40] of the seven seal. He says God's great
[14:42] mystery of how it's a secret and how he
[14:44] kept it a secret. Nobody know nothing
[14:46] about it. Even angels didn't understand
[14:49] it. See that's the reason under our
[14:51] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[14:53] was open there was silence. And when
[14:55] Jesus was on earth they wanted to know
[14:58] when he would come. And he said it's not
[15:00] even to the son himself. Don't know when
[15:02] it's going to happen. And God has all
[15:04] this to himself. It's a secret. And
[15:06] that's the reason there was silence in
[15:08] heaven for the space of half an hour.
[15:11] See, seven thunders would utter their
[15:12] voices. But John was even forbidden to
[15:15] ride it. See, it was the coming of the
[15:18] Lord. Yeah. Now, he's going to now tie
[15:20] together the opening of seven seals,
[15:24] seven thunders. Revelations 10 is the
[15:26] coming of the Lord. That's the one thing
[15:29] he hasn't revealed yet of how he will
[15:32] come and when he will come. And it's a
[15:35] good thing he does it. And for years I
[15:37] had people read me that, but they never
[15:39] read on. I just love to read on. I love
[15:42] to just read the next sentences behind
[15:45] when a prophet says something like that
[15:47] because the very next words he says,
[15:49] "But he has showed it or revealed it in
[15:52] every type that's in the Bible." So when
[15:55] you come under this messenger, you see
[15:58] now your entire Bible is a revelation of
[16:02] the coming of Christ because he's
[16:04] coming. How did he do it? He had
[16:05] preeminence in Abraham. He had
[16:07] preeminence in Rebecca. He had
[16:09] preeminence in Tamar. It was his life
[16:11] having preeminence. And that's written
[16:13] in every type that's in the Bible is how
[16:16] he would come. Amen. See, but the entire
[16:19] Bible then is a revelation of God's
[16:21] mystery in Christ. The Bible is an
[16:23] expression of one goal. God had one
[16:26] purpose he wanted to achieve. And all
[16:28] the acts of the believers in the Bible
[16:30] has been in a type and expressing a
[16:33] great goal that now in this last day he
[16:37] has revealed it and shows it. And by
[16:39] God's help, you'll see it right here
[16:41] this morning. Amen. I I know he was
[16:43] talking to them, but I'm talking to you.
[16:45] By God's help, you'll see it right there
[16:47] this morning. It has been expressed. And
[16:50] and then brother Bradom lays out the
[16:52] beautiful thing that God wanted to do.
[16:55] He wanted to express himself in his son.
[16:57] Right? But then the thing that he
[17:00] expressed in Jesus, he wanted to express
[17:03] it in a many member body. And then when
[17:06] that body had fully expressed what he
[17:09] had in Jesus, he wants to change that
[17:11] body and take them back to the garden of
[17:14] Eden. That was the great purpose of God.
[17:16] Now that purpose could not be fulfilled
[17:19] until the seventh angel came to under to
[17:22] to release what was in him into the
[17:25] bride of Jesus Christ. Now in feast of
[17:28] trumpets I just love how brother Bram
[17:30] says things. He said look now I want to
[17:32] say one more thing closely. Now don't
[17:34] miss this. How striking from the seventh
[17:38] angels messenger of the seven seal. How
[17:41] did he knows brother Brandon was a
[17:42] messenger of the seventh seal? Yeah, he
[17:45] was the messenger of the seventh seal.
[17:48] Now watch. And he's striking from the
[17:50] seventh angel's message, the messenger
[17:51] of the seventh seal. The message in
[17:54] Revelations 10 was the seventh seal.
[17:58] So you said, "Brother Wayne, we're we're
[18:00] See, cuz this I I face this a lot in
[18:02] theological discussions with people and
[18:04] they say, "Well, how do you prove that
[18:06] in the Bible?" Well, if you use the
[18:08] scriptures Brother Bam gave us, it's
[18:10] easy, right? But most people don't want
[18:13] to use the scripture he gave us because
[18:15] they have an idea. Well, that's for the
[18:16] millennium or that's for a different
[18:18] time or that. But here's a prophet just
[18:20] as Jesus took the Bible in Luke 4 and
[18:23] said, "This day, this scripture is
[18:25] fulfilled." And they said, "My, no way
[18:27] it could be that." You know why? Because
[18:29] they had a lot of traditions and they
[18:31] had a lot of ideas of what that's going
[18:33] to be. But now here's a prophet saying
[18:35] to them this day, this scripture and and
[18:38] I tell you, it's amazing cuz then you
[18:39] know what they done to Jesus? They threw
[18:41] him out head first, brother Mike. Amen.
[18:43] Because they wasn't mad at his feet,
[18:44] they was mad at the head. Amen. And they
[18:46] done the same thing in this Leodysian
[18:48] age. They threw their head out of the
[18:51] church because he's revealing things
[18:53] they don't want to hear because they got
[18:55] all these traditions. Amen. But the
[18:58] message of the hour is a tradition
[19:00] shattering revelation. It is the act
[19:03] that is laid to the root of the tree.
[19:05] It'll shatter the traditions. And if you
[19:07] can accept the the ideas that Brother
[19:10] Brandham brought us, it will not fit
[19:12] your Pentecostal tradition, but it most
[19:14] certainly will fit the Bible.
[19:17] And that's what I'm worried about is
[19:19] matching this Bible. And I've told y'all
[19:21] a bunch of times, and I'll say it again.
[19:23] I am not trying to align myself with any
[19:25] teachers in this message. I am not
[19:28] listening to teachers thinking, I got to
[19:30] line up with this guy or I got to line
[19:32] up with this guy or I got to line up
[19:33] with this guy. I study these messages
[19:36] and that's what I got to line up with is
[19:38] what did William Brandham say about it?
[19:41] Because he is the messenger of that
[19:43] seven seal. Then that's exactly what we
[19:46] need. Amen. We need to come under his
[19:49] revelation of what it was. He was the
[19:51] messenger of the seven seal. And you
[19:53] said, "Brother Wayne, what is the
[19:55] seventh seal?" Well, Revelations 10 is
[19:57] the seventh seal. You can just read it
[19:59] right out. Now the the reason we make it
[20:02] so uh plain to you is because brother
[20:04] Random said remember he said when them
[20:07] angels were coming to me them seven
[20:08] angels were coming he said I said Lord
[20:11] where's the interpretation of this
[20:13] vision and he said it was already
[20:15] written in the scriptures. Yeah. So
[20:17] Revelations 10 was those angels coming
[20:22] to the prophet. Yeah. Now watch what he
[20:24] says here. Amen. Brother Bam says it in
[20:26] paragraph 245 of the seven seal. I'm
[20:29] going to tell you my revelation of it.
[20:32] Amen. He'll say it like this. Go down
[20:33] just a little bit more. He'll say, "Now,
[20:35] as certain as I stand in the platform
[20:37] tonight," that's pretty certain, isn't
[20:39] it? I had the revelation revealed to me,
[20:42] and it's in a three-fold manner. So, did
[20:45] Brother Brandham have the revelation of
[20:46] the seventh seal? Absolutely, he did.
[20:49] Amen. And it was revealed in a
[20:51] three-fold manner. Now, when you say a
[20:54] three-fold manner, you you're studying
[20:56] the message. Go to Christ the mystery
[20:58] and see if there's not a three-fold
[21:00] purpose.
[21:02] What's the first one? Revealing. What's
[21:04] the second one? A preeminence. What's
[21:07] the third one? A change of the body.
[21:09] Okay. Now, the seven seal has a
[21:12] three-fold. Right. Now, when you know
[21:15] it's the coming of the Lord, that
[21:17] answers a bunch because you can also
[21:20] read the events of the coming of the
[21:22] Lord. Amen. If you go down to 1
[21:24] Thessalonians chapter 4 and you read 1
[21:27] Thessalonians 4, watch what he said. For
[21:29] we say unto you by the word of the Lord.
[21:31] Now Paul is telling you this is not
[21:33] written somewhere out in the Old
[21:34] Testament, but this is a gathering of
[21:36] what was written and what God has showed
[21:38] me. And I'm telling you by the word of
[21:41] the Lord, by vision. I'm saying that the
[21:43] they which were alive until the coming
[21:45] of the Lord shall not prevent them which
[21:48] sleep. For the Lord himself shall
[21:50] descend from heaven. Now you're Bible
[21:52] readers. How many knows the Bible said
[21:54] the Lord is that spirit?
[21:57] And where the spirit of the Lord is,
[21:58] there is liberty. So the Lord himself is
[22:02] a what?
[22:03] Spirit. Amen. The Lord himself, the
[22:06] spirit would, he said, descend from
[22:08] heaven with a shout. And how many knows
[22:11] that's the message? Now, Brother Brandon
[22:14] wasn't the Lord himself. Now, I know
[22:15] there's some deity teachers out there
[22:17] wouldn't like that, but let's just say
[22:18] it by biblically. He wasn't the Lord
[22:20] himself. He was a son of man revealing
[22:23] the son of man. Amen. Do you see what he
[22:25] says then? That there would be a shout,
[22:27] a voice, and a three things. That seven
[22:29] seal will be what? Three things. The
[22:32] rapture is three things. Now, what's the
[22:34] three things? A revealing. The shout is
[22:37] the revealing of the son of man. The
[22:40] voice is that revelation in you. Yeah.
[22:45] You say, "Where are we in scripture,
[22:47] brother Wayne?" And you're right there.
[22:48] You're the voice of 1 Thessalonians
[22:50] chapter 4. When I can't position you as
[22:54] a Leodysian, I have to place you as a
[22:57] voice of resurrection. You said,
[22:59] "Preacher, what are you talking about?"
[23:01] Amen. Y'all know the age of ignorance is
[23:03] over, right? He stood up, took the book,
[23:05] and the age of interceding for ignorance
[23:08] is over. Come on. We have moved from an
[23:11] age of ignorance to an age of blindness.
[23:14] Today, people are not ignorant. They're
[23:16] blind because it's been revealed. Amen.
[23:18] We can stand right here and show it in
[23:21] the Bible. So, we are no longer ignorant
[23:23] of the things of God, but there are
[23:25] people blinded to the things of God, but
[23:28] those fit in a leodyian Pentecostal age,
[23:31] but that bride has been elevated by a
[23:34] prophet in the first Thessalonians 4.
[23:37] And she is now the voice of the
[23:39] archangel. She is the voice of God.
[23:41] Amen. Oh, God. Hallelujah. She is the
[23:44] voice of God. You know that's how that
[23:46] angel's with you. Don't you don't you
[23:48] know the angel that brought this message
[23:50] stays with this message. He accompanies
[23:52] this message always. That's why that
[23:54] angel is here in this building this
[23:56] morning. This message is still the word
[23:59] of God. It's not just a man's idea. It's
[24:02] the word of God. Amen. And there is an
[24:05] angel that accompanies this message.
[24:07] It's the coming of the Lord. Now watch
[24:10] in Matthew 24. He'll say the same thing.
[24:12] As lightning cometh out of the east and
[24:14] shineth unto the west, so shall the
[24:15] coming of the son of man be. For
[24:17] wheresoever the carcass is, there will
[24:19] the eagles be gathered. Isn't it
[24:21] amazing? If you if you place 1
[24:23] Thessalonians 4 and Matthew 24 together,
[24:25] both of them have a coming. Both of them
[24:26] have a gathering.
[24:28] The eagles will be gathered. And in 1
[24:31] Thessalonians 4, it says a shout. But
[24:33] brother Bam said that's the gathering of
[24:34] the bride under his message. So what
[24:37] you're looking at is let's go back to 1
[24:39] Thessalonians 4 and verse 15. for them
[24:42] that remain until the coming of the
[24:44] Lord. The seventh seal is the coming of
[24:46] the Lord. And watch what he says. And
[24:49] then in Matthew 24, the coming of the
[24:52] son of man. Now that word, I hope I
[24:54] don't scare you to death, but that word
[24:56] is actually paracia.
[24:59] Now, I know there's some scarecrows
[25:01] around that word, but you know what
[25:03] brother Bram said about scarecrows,
[25:04] don't you? He said that's where the best
[25:06] fruit is. It's behind the scarecrow. Now
[25:10] you now somebody said, "Well, brother
[25:11] Wayne, what are you talking about? Let's
[25:13] read Feast of Trumpets." And Brother Ram
[25:15] says, "Look now unless you're constantly
[25:17] in the word." He says, "Now the foolish
[25:19] and unwise won't know this, but they but
[25:22] they shall know their God." He said,
[25:24] "Now people, he shall appear in the last
[25:27] days to bring the people back to the
[25:29] word. So the bride will know her
[25:30] husband,
[25:32] the revealed word." Who's your husband?
[25:36] The revealed word. That's why this has
[25:38] to happen. See, it wasn't reformers in
[25:42] Luther, Wesley, and the Pentecostals.
[25:44] Scripture says it wasn't, but it will
[25:45] come. That is the promise for this age.
[25:48] We are living in the age coming will be
[25:51] in. Now, he's not talking about the
[25:53] coming of the literal body. He's talking
[25:56] about the coming of the revealed word,
[25:58] which is your mate. I don't think
[26:01] anybody in here, Amen, would argue to
[26:03] the fact that the bride's going to meet
[26:04] a corporal body of Jesus Christ. Is
[26:06] there anybody that don't believe that?
[26:08] That's exactly when you preach like
[26:09] this. Somebody said, "Well, I don't even
[26:11] believe in a literal body." You know
[26:12] what that's called? Amen. That's that's
[26:14] called an art of of debate.
[26:18] And they they build themselves an
[26:20] invisible person that preaches part and
[26:23] this and that. And then they make
[26:24] anybody that says something like that,
[26:26] well, that's who you are. So, it's a
[26:28] it's it's a way to buffalo you or
[26:30] intimidate you away from the realities
[26:33] of what a rough taught. But I ain't
[26:35] scared.
[26:37] I ain't scared. God did not give me the
[26:39] spirit of fear, but the spirit of
[26:41] revelation and wisdom that we might be
[26:44] able to see him and know him in his
[26:46] presence in this age. Amen. Now, that
[26:49] word coming there is paracia. Amen. Now,
[26:52] there's a lot of people pronounce it
[26:53] differently, but but it's spelled the
[26:55] fenic spelling is paracia.
[27:01] And I ain't even Greek. And I that
[27:03] that's a southern language. Y'all know
[27:08] that. A southern boy, a Greek
[27:12] theologian. Thank God for
[27:15] Google. I just done a small word study
[27:18] on the word paracia. All right. Not in
[27:21] relation with with the message, just in
[27:24] relation with how it's used in
[27:26] scripture. And I just read you two. If
[27:29] you were reading it, it say them which
[27:30] were alive and remained unto the paracea
[27:32] of the Lord. And then in Matthew 24, it
[27:35] would read, "Amen. In the days of the
[27:37] paraca of the son of man." Yeah. So the
[27:40] word paraca, Amen. Now listen to this.
[27:43] While there is no direct Hebrew
[27:46] equivalent, the concept means a divine
[27:49] visit. A visitation,
[27:51] a presence that can be related to a term
[27:55] meaning arrival or the face or the
[27:58] presence. Yeah. In its usage, it means
[28:02] it conveys the idea of an arrival that
[28:06] brings significant change and
[28:08] fulfillment.
[28:11] Come on, church. Has had did did we see
[28:14] significant change and fulfillment?
[28:17] That's exactly what this message brought
[28:20] was change and fulfillment. Amen. Do you
[28:23] see I'm not done. This is amazing. This
[28:25] is the help words of studies. This is
[28:28] just somebody put together a definition
[28:29] of Greek to help guys like me. Amen. And
[28:32] it says it means to be present or to
[28:34] arrive into a situation. It means
[28:38] properly coming, especially the arrival
[28:42] of the owner who alone can deal with a
[28:45] situation. Yeah. Yeah, there's only one
[28:49] person could deal with this situation
[28:51] that we're in. There was one kinsman and
[28:54] his name was Jesus Christ. Parisa is not
[28:58] about William Brandham. It's about the
[29:00] unseen one on the stage with him that he
[29:03] was introducing because paracia also
[29:06] means a long side of. It's invisible,
[29:10] but he's alongside of. And brother Bam
[29:13] kept telling you, there's somebody here
[29:15] that you can't see. But there's a man
[29:18] here that can turn on the lights. I'm
[29:20] not the one creating squirrels. I'm not
[29:22] the one doing this, but he is here. And
[29:25] I say this this morning, he's still
[29:27] here. He's Jesus Christ the same
[29:30] yesterday, today, and forever. And he's
[29:33] alongside the church right now. He said,
[29:36] "I will never leave you, but I will be
[29:38] with you, alongside you, but if so,
[29:41] inside you until the last days." Amen.
[29:44] It means the arrival of the owner who
[29:47] alone can deal with the situation. Oh, I
[29:50] was so glad he came. There was
[29:53] situations that needed dealt with and he
[29:55] came. Now, now the next one says it like
[29:57] this. Amen. Parisa. It's a technical
[30:00] term with a references to the visit of a
[30:04] king or some other official. It means a
[30:08] royal visitation.
[30:11] Hallelujah. Amen. The one that came that
[30:13] could only deal with our situation
[30:15] happened to be the king of kings. The
[30:18] king has been among us. Why did brother
[30:20] Brandham say that was the king's sword
[30:22] that came into his hands? Unless the
[30:25] king was the one that gave it to him.
[30:27] Come on, church. We're talking about
[30:29] adoption this morning. We're talking
[30:31] about Esther going into the royal place
[30:34] and receiving the royal uh what would
[30:37] you call it? A royal scepter in her
[30:40] hand. Amen. What was it? It happened on
[30:42] the third day, didn't it? Amen. She was
[30:44] fasting and mourning and and and ashes
[30:47] all over her. But when she got ready to
[30:50] go into there, amen. She took off her
[30:52] robes of mourning and she took off her
[30:54] ashes and she restored them with a joy
[30:57] and put on a beautiful garment and
[31:00] walked into the presence of the king. I
[31:02] say this morning that the days of
[31:04] mourning is over. John, don't you weep.
[31:07] There's the lion. The tribe of Judah
[31:09] hath revealed this word to you.
[31:12] There's no reason for this bride to
[31:14] glory. I'm moaning and complaining.
[31:16] Lord, do something. Lord, help us do
[31:18] something. He has done something. He has
[31:21] descended into this age to break every
[31:23] curse, to break every spell, to destroy
[31:26] every devil that works against you.
[31:30] Oh yes, sir. Perise is the same word
[31:33] used in second Thessalonians when the
[31:35] Bible said, "He shall destroy him. The
[31:37] works of the devil he shall destroy by
[31:40] the brightness of his paracia, by the
[31:43] brightness of his coming." Amen. Come
[31:45] on, church. Amen. Y'all y'all y'all know
[31:47] all about this a tent vision brother
[31:49] banam had. You know all about it. And
[31:52] you know Moses had one too, didn't he?
[31:54] Yeah.
[31:56] Amen. Two great prophets. Nobody like
[31:58] Moses. They ain't nobody like this
[32:00] prophet either. God speaks lift to ear
[32:02] with him.
[32:05] Amen. Do you know Moses went on a
[32:06] mountain and a cloud descended and he
[32:08] got a tent vision? Isn't it something
[32:10] that this prophet Amen went on a
[32:12] mountain and a cloud descended and he
[32:13] come out with a tent vision? Amen.
[32:18] I tell you what, there's three phases to
[32:20] the tent Moses had, isn't there? And
[32:22] there's a light forever phase. That
[32:24] light on the outside was sun and moon.
[32:26] No, no, no consistency. Amen. Go in the
[32:28] next veil and it was seven candlesticks
[32:31] and they would get low and go out, but
[32:33] you go into that next room in that
[32:36] little room and there was the word in
[32:38] the pillar of fire and it was a
[32:40] consistent thing. It wasn't up and down
[32:42] and in and out. It stayed the same.
[32:44] Listen, when William Brandon came here,
[32:46] he didn't say he was bringing
[32:48] Pentecostal light or Baptist light or
[32:50] church of Christ light. He said, "I'm
[32:52] bringing Messiah light." There is a
[32:54] light. Shalom, church.
[32:58] There's a light that's been turned on in
[33:00] this little room.
[33:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[33:07] Ever wondered why a prophet teaches
[33:09] about a about a tent? It's a gathering
[33:11] place, isn't it? Amen. Isn't a tent a
[33:13] place to gather? And where was he going
[33:15] to gather you if he took you out of
[33:17] every denomination? He brought people
[33:19] out of this one and this one and this
[33:20] one, this one, where they going to go?
[33:22] God showed him, I'll give you a tent.
[33:23] I'll give you a place to put them. I'll
[33:25] give you and it's a spiritual tent.
[33:27] Amen. But it's the place where the bride
[33:29] will gather, but in that tent is private
[33:32] room.
[33:34] Come on. That's your soul. Every one of
[33:37] you is an individual in this third pool.
[33:39] You might be under the umbrella of the
[33:41] third pool, but you got a soul and only
[33:44] you and God can meditate in that place.
[33:46] That's why brother Bam said the angel
[33:48] said you can't teach supernatural things
[33:50] to Pentecostal babies. They don't
[33:52] understand it. They don't know that this
[33:54] third pull has the power to change
[33:56] people and you can't explain it.
[33:58] Hallelujah.
[34:00] I hope I'm not just preaching too much.
[34:02] I hope I don't scatter my thought on
[34:03] you. Amen. But brother saw him, didn't
[34:06] he? He saw him go in and come out
[34:07] changed. Yeah. Yeah. And somebody said,
[34:10] "What happened?" She said, "I don't
[34:11] know.
[34:13] I don't know what happened." And some of
[34:15] you have not yet been able to explain
[34:17] what happened to your life. You can't
[34:19] explain it. Something happened and you
[34:20] don't know what happened. I tell you
[34:22] what happened. You got in that angel in
[34:24] that little room and that light came
[34:26] over it and there was change happened
[34:28] because in that room, brother Roman,
[34:30] that's where that Aaron's robotic and
[34:33] that's where the bride is really going
[34:34] to bud is under the teaching of this
[34:36] third pool. It's the revival that'll
[34:39] break open in the church and it'll make
[34:41] a dry stick into a stick that's full of
[34:44] life and building forth the yielding
[34:46] fruits of God.
[34:50] Hallelujah. I don't want to get too far
[34:51] sidetracked on that, but
[34:56] it literally means
[34:59] paracia literally means one beside you.
[35:03] Yeah. It means a personal presence. Yes,
[35:06] sir.
[35:08] Now, in Luke 17, I want you to watch the
[35:10] 30th verse. Now, brother Ray has taught
[35:12] on these two words. I know some of you
[35:13] probably familiar with it. Luke 17
[35:15] and30. Now, Matthew 24, y'all know is
[35:17] speaking of brother Bram's ministry.
[35:19] Yeah. The coming of the son of man.
[35:21] Yeah. In Luke 17:30, it uses a different
[35:24] word and says, "The son of man is
[35:26] revealed." And that word revealed is
[35:29] apocalyptto. It means to uncover or to
[35:32] disclose. It's the Hebrew equivalent
[35:35] meaning to reveal. Its usage of course,
[35:38] amen, is given, let me just give you the
[35:40] short answer. It means to reveal that
[35:42] which is hidden or
[35:44] obstructed, especially in an inner
[35:46] makeup. See, to make plain that which is
[35:50] invisible.
[35:52] So you have the coming of the son of
[35:53] man, but without the revealing of the
[35:55] son of man, how do you know he's here?
[35:58] So what a prophet was doing was
[35:59] revealing the unseen one to the church.
[36:02] And he was making you believe what you
[36:04] couldn't see by your faith.
[36:06] He taught us faith is a six sense. And
[36:08] he said it'll make you declare things.
[36:10] You can't taste it, smell it, feel it,
[36:11] or hear it, but you'll believe it. How'd
[36:14] he do that? He'd say something like
[36:15] this. There's a lot hanging over your
[36:17] head. And when you were four years old,
[36:18] you got bit by a dog and you were
[36:20] wearing a checkered dress and your mom
[36:22] took you to the doctor and this and this
[36:23] happened and you're still surfing with
[36:24] nervousness and this. Do you believe
[36:25] he's here? Amen. Hallelujah. He said, "I
[36:29] didn't know that about you. And if I
[36:30] could tell you what your past was,
[36:31] couldn't I tell you about your future?"
[36:33] And he'd turn around and say, "I see
[36:34] you." Well,
[36:36] you know what brother Ram said? He said,
[36:37] "A lot of people didn't stay long enough
[36:39] for the future." He said, "They just got
[36:40] the they got the discernment, but they
[36:42] didn't stay long enough for the next
[36:43] vision to break.
[36:45] So, they stayed in the second part and
[36:47] they got under the inspiration of what
[36:48] was wrong with them, but they never
[36:50] stayed around for the answer." And I'll
[36:52] tell you this, the second pull discerned
[36:54] a lot of things, but the third pull is
[36:56] the heart of God telling you the future
[36:58] of this bride. Amen. That's why stay
[37:01] around to the end of the message. It is
[37:02] the future home. Don't quit reading.
[37:06] Amen. In 1962, keep reading on. Amen. It
[37:09] turns into a rapture and a future home
[37:12] for the church of the living God. This
[37:14] message means more than prayer lines. I
[37:16] love prayer lines. Y'all know me. It
[37:18] means more than that. It means more than
[37:20] shouting. It is the changing of our body
[37:23] and will take us to another dimension.
[37:26] And I'll say this, if you can change a
[37:28] body without shouting, God bless you. I
[37:30] don't think I can.
[37:34] I don't think I
[37:36] can. Brother Ray will be talking in
[37:38] tongues all the way
[37:40] there. I guarantee you. Look him up in
[37:43] the meet and air and he'll be talking in
[37:44] tongues.
[37:46] Come on.
[37:50] You think I'm kidding? I don't I don't
[37:51] really think so. And I'll be dancing.
[37:57] Amen. Now, that seven seal has three
[37:59] parts and and you can just here's the
[38:01] revelation. It has three parts. It's a
[38:03] shout, a voice, and a trump. A shout,
[38:07] voice, and trump. Now, there's a there's
[38:10] when the seven seal opens, there's a
[38:12] space of half an hour, right? Lots of
[38:14] ideas on that half hour.
[38:18] I don't have anything to offer you
[38:19] because I don't have any authority on
[38:20] it. But I will tell you this, the great
[38:23] revelation of it is it's a span of time.
[38:28] And if you ever catch that, the coming
[38:30] of the Lord is a span of time.
[38:34] Didn't it happen that way in his first
[38:36] coming?
[38:38] Was about 33 years of it. Yeah. Amen. It
[38:41] wasn't in the blink of an eye such as is
[38:43] what we have traditionally thought, but
[38:46] it's a span of So, the seven seal is a
[38:48] span of time. And thank God it was
[38:52] because there's a lot of us would have
[38:53] never got it had it been quicker.
[38:58] I wouldn't have caught it cuz I'm still
[39:00] catching things.
[39:03] The seven seal is a span of time. The
[39:06] the seven seal is composed of many
[39:08] events. Right? It's a Roman candle going
[39:11] off. So, there's events surrounding the
[39:14] seven seal. So, don't get don't get
[39:16] thrown away that it's just one thing.
[39:18] There's a lot of events accumulating
[39:20] around that seven seal. Amen. Now,
[39:23] definitive statements, we can make them.
[39:24] The seven seal is the king's sword,
[39:28] right? It's the word opened. Because
[39:30] when brother caught the sword, it wasn't
[39:32] a sword sheaved. It was a sword open.
[39:36] So, it's a revealed word. The seventh
[39:38] seal, it is the third pull. Now, that's
[39:41] a hard one because we know the third
[39:43] pull has specifically to do with William
[39:46] Brandham's ministry. Yes, sir. And the
[39:48] third pull is the seven seal. The third
[39:51] pull is the tent vision. Yeah. You
[39:54] wondered all these years, what's the
[39:56] tent vision? And there's people has put
[39:57] tradition all over that to hide it from
[40:01] the reality that the tent vision is the
[40:04] seven seal coming into the bride.
[40:09] A place see a place to gather you. Where
[40:11] was he going to take you if he took you
[40:13] out of all those churches? Not everybody
[40:15] was going to move to Jeffersonville
[40:17] because brother Brandham himself wasn't
[40:18] staying there. That's right. But he had
[40:21] to have something corporate that he
[40:23] could put over the church, a gathering
[40:25] under his ministry, but there would have
[40:28] to be a little room in every individual
[40:30] gathering in that tent.
[40:34] I I it it's there. The seventh seal, it
[40:37] is the coming of the Lord. The seventh
[40:40] seal, it's the headstone capping the
[40:43] pyramid. Yeah. The seventh seal, and
[40:46] this one I really, really, really,
[40:47] really like, is the fulfillment of
[40:50] Revelations 10.
[40:52] See, it's a three-fold message. Now, in
[40:53] the rapture, I'll read it for you. Amen.
[40:56] Three things happen. A shout, a voice, a
[40:58] trumpet, and Jesus does all three in his
[41:00] descending. Now, a shout is the message
[41:03] going forth the living bread of life,
[41:06] bringing forth a bride. Now, God has a
[41:08] way of doing things. He never changes.
[41:10] his unchanging way. In Amos 3:7, he says
[41:14] he would do nothing without revealing it
[41:17] to a prophet. Now, can I say it plain?
[41:19] Let's say it real plain. Let's read the
[41:21] Bible plain. For the Lord himself shall
[41:23] descend from heaven with the message of
[41:26] William Brandham.
[41:30] Now, if you still haven't got them
[41:32] thunders sounding, you can't read it
[41:35] like that because it's still a symbol
[41:36] called shout.
[41:38] But when the thunder sounded, it
[41:40] revealed the reality of the symbol which
[41:43] now lets us know what the first horse
[41:45] rider that white horse is an antichrist.
[41:48] We can say it that that fourth horse, oh
[41:50] that's the pale horse, that's the
[41:51] confusion that's coming from a
[41:52] conglomeration of demons, political
[41:54] power, religious power. We we can spout
[41:56] it right off. But what about that shout?
[42:01] Say that without the symbol. It's the
[42:02] message of Brother Bam. But that next
[42:05] one right there,
[42:08] but the voice,
[42:10] oh my goodness, that includes you.
[42:15] You know, you know it's harder to preach
[42:17] it with you in it. Right. Oh, let
[42:19] brother Ram do it.
[42:22] Now, y'all heard the story about the
[42:24] pastor that pushed the pushed the
[42:26] wheelbarrow over the log. Everybody said
[42:29] he walked across the log, said, "Do
[42:30] y'all believe I can do it?" Everybody
[42:31] said, "Yeah, you can do it."
[42:33] So he went and got a wheelbarrow, said,
[42:34] "Y'all believe I can push this
[42:35] wheelbarrow across this log." And they
[42:36] said, "You can do it."
[42:39] Two
[42:39] times God, Brother Bam tells this and uh
[42:43] humble thyself.
[42:45] But the third time, watch what he does.
[42:47] He says, "But then the pastor says, "Can
[42:51] I put you in the
[42:52] wheelbarrow and push it across the log?"
[42:56] See, the third pull is the one with you
[42:57] in it.
[43:00] The third pull is the thing brother
[43:02] Brandham is announcing. I'm leaving.
[43:06] He's telling you, I'm leaving.
[43:09] But the third pull is here. What's he
[43:12] done? He's introduced you to something
[43:14] that he can now leave and know you're
[43:16] still going to get in the resurrection.
[43:19] He knows you're still going to make it
[43:21] because what he has brought is not going
[43:23] to leave the church until she's changed.
[43:26] It's in Luke 24. You can read it. Jesus
[43:29] stayed with them an entire six-hour
[43:30] journey. And he didn't leave them till
[43:32] they got it. And he's not going to leave
[43:35] you till you got it. And if you start
[43:38] acting like you're not going to get it,
[43:39] he's going to call your name.
[43:42] I love how Brother Ram does it. Don't
[43:44] you? He says, and and he's preaching all
[43:46] of a sudden he calls somebody's name,
[43:47] said she was about to miss it.
[43:51] He don't want you to miss this. So he
[43:53] called your name. See, a shout is the
[43:56] message. Now, if said plain, it then
[43:58] shows you that the order of events in
[44:01] 1962 into the spring of 1963 was the
[44:05] coming of those angels to brother
[44:07] Brandham. When something struck his
[44:09] hand, it was a sword. Now, that sword
[44:11] was the word coming to a prophet.
[44:15] I'm going to let that sink in a minute.
[44:18] The word, let's just say it together.
[44:20] The word word coming to a prophet.
[44:24] That's the sword in the hand of brother
[44:27] Brandham.
[44:28] That is the third pull.
[44:32] The word coming to a prophet. Now I'll
[44:34] just read it. Brother Brandham says when
[44:36] I saw that tent, this is seven seal.
[44:38] When I saw that tent, he says that that
[44:40] pillar fire, remember it went over that
[44:42] and he said it went over that box and it
[44:44] whirled away from me like that and went
[44:46] over that tent and he said I'll meet you
[44:49] there. Right? And he said this will be
[44:53] the third pull
[44:56] I meeting you there will be.
[45:00] Look at that will be the next sentence.
[45:04] He says and in Sabino Canyon he said
[45:08] this is
[45:10] six years ago it will be in Sabino he
[45:14] said this is
[45:17] what was it? The sword coming into his
[45:19] hand was changing it from will be to is.
[45:23] It was changing it for Sunday till it
[45:25] is. It was moving the bride into a
[45:28] dispensational change that was moving
[45:31] her out of a Pentecostal age. Now, I'm
[45:33] not talking about the Acts 2 Pentecost.
[45:35] I'm talking about the 1906 Pentecost.
[45:38] Amen. I'm talking about moving you out
[45:40] of the shuck into the original seed word
[45:44] that was given upon it. I've always said
[45:46] this cuz anybody that's against the move
[45:48] of God, they always love them areas, you
[45:49] know. It's out of that Pentecostal
[45:51] stuff, you know. Well, not all of
[45:52] Pentecost was bad, folks.
[45:56] It almost looked exactly like the seed.
[46:00] Matter of fact, it was the same life. So
[46:04] everything good in Pentecost is in this
[46:06] bride. We didn't leave the gifts in the
[46:09] shuck. We didn't leave the power of God
[46:12] in the shock. Come on, church. The shuck
[46:15] had no inheritance in the life. It just
[46:18] passed through them. But this bride
[46:20] didn't just get a gift. They got the
[46:22] whole giver and we own the whole thing.
[46:26] Hallelujah. That's like saying that you
[46:28] could get a pack of grapes from a woman
[46:30] can get a pack of grapes off of her
[46:32] husband's grape while they're while
[46:33] they're dating, but when she gets
[46:35] married now, she can't get no grapes.
[46:37] [Music]
[46:39] Come on. We're not just getting grapes
[46:40] and we're not just carrying grapes out
[46:42] of the promised land saying, "Hey, we
[46:44] own the thing."
[46:47] [Music]
[46:48] The full inheritance is upon the church.
[46:51] It's the sword in the hand. It was a
[46:54] royal visit
[46:57] to change the situation. You know how
[46:59] they, you know, how they kn a knight in
[47:01] in the old days of kings, you know how
[47:03] they did it? They took their sword and
[47:05] they kned them. Yeah. And that's exactly
[47:08] what God done with William Brandom. He
[47:10] adopted him.
[47:13] Come on, church. There was a Jordan
[47:14] River and there's an Ohio River. And the
[47:18] pillar fire came down on both of them.
[47:20] But there's a Mount Transfiguration, but
[47:22] there's a Mount Sunset.
[47:24] And the Sunset Mountain, the same thing
[47:27] going on in Mount Transfiguration's
[47:29] going on on Mount Sunset. It's a
[47:31] glorification of Jesus Christ, but in
[47:34] the bride body.
[47:37] adoption, not in the son, but in the
[47:39] body. Hallelujah. He walked off of that
[47:42] mountain as an adopted son to bring many
[47:45] of you unto adoption. To speak with
[47:48] authority, to put in your hand the great
[47:50] revealed word that you wouldn't behind
[47:52] in no gift or you would be behind in
[47:54] nothing. The third pull is the opening
[47:57] of them seven
[47:58] seals. Now, I'm driving these definitive
[48:02] statements so you can catch it. The
[48:03] third pull is the opening of them seven
[48:05] seals. Somebody said, "Brother Wayne,
[48:06] what's the third pull?" The opening of
[48:08] the seven seals. That's right. There's
[48:11] events surrounding it. Brother Brandham
[48:14] tells us about the creation by spoken
[48:16] word. He tells us of souls that are in
[48:18] prison. Remember? And he tells us it's
[48:21] the opening of the word. Now, the first
[48:23] two pulls come to him in cave in
[48:27] 1947. Remember it was the sign in the
[48:29] hand.
[48:31] Amen. And it was the reading of the
[48:33] heart. But the third came to him in
[48:36] vision in 1955 and told him his tent
[48:39] vision would be like a fishing
[48:40] expedition. Yeah. And that he would be
[48:44] casting for a big fish,
[48:47] a trophy trout.
[48:49] I like to say a trophy wife.
[48:53] One who had all the colors.
[48:56] She'd wear that favorable road of
[48:59] Joseph and she would be identified as
[49:01] the favored one. It's no accident
[49:03] William Brandom caught the world record
[49:05] rainbow
[49:07] on a little
[49:10] hook. The third pull of course came to
[49:13] him by vision and it was called the tent
[49:15] vision. Five different manifestations
[49:17] were told to us out of look away to
[49:19] Jesus in 1963. And he tells us about the
[49:22] squirrels being created. He tells us
[49:23] about how he write. He tells us about
[49:25] the tumor that was spoken away. He tells
[49:27] us about the fish. And then he tells us
[49:29] about the storm that was spoken away.
[49:31] So, five different manifestations. Now,
[49:33] now I I'm telling you that for a reason
[49:35] because some people are looking for this
[49:37] that they can go out and speak the word
[49:39] every day of their life, you know, and
[49:40] they be gone and uh I call fire on you
[49:44] and I give you a car and I give you this
[49:45] and I give you that and I do this and
[49:51] Well, it's good for a service for some
[49:52] hype, but Come on. It's not very true
[49:56] [Music]
[49:58] when I say that is that five times in
[50:02] the prophet who brought it.
[50:07] So you got to realize that it's a very
[50:09] sacred thing.
[50:12] It's a it's an interaction. Now that
[50:14] third pull is the opening of the word.
[50:17] Now don't don't let me don't let me u
[50:19] make you think I'm ridiculing somebody
[50:21] speaking a word because I believe in
[50:23] that. Don't don't don't make me think
[50:24] that. But I've seen people misuse it to
[50:26] where they make it like a
[50:29] It's like, come on, man. Name it, claim
[50:31] it. You know, charismatics. Uh, the
[50:34] third pull is the opening of the word.
[50:36] And there's no higher order. Reveal
[50:38] that. Now, now, Brother Bam, I'm home,
[50:41] ain't I? Can I Can I just Can I just
[50:43] preach to you? Now, when Brother Bam
[50:46] gets caught up in this cloud, do how
[50:49] many knows he was literally caught up
[50:51] into the angels? Right? And when he's
[50:54] talking to you about it, he takes you
[50:56] back to the tent vision. He said,
[50:58] "Remember I was lifted up."
[51:02] And then there in Sabino, he said, "That
[51:05] sword coming would be the third pole."
[51:07] He said, "And when the angels came on
[51:09] Mount Sunset, remember what he said? I
[51:11] was lifted up into them." Yeah.
[51:15] He was lifted up to them. Now, I I don't
[51:17] want to um You got that picture of that
[51:20] cloud sunset? I don't want you to to um
[51:23] uh I don't want to I don't want to
[51:25] confuse you, but I want to show you
[51:26] something I think I think is very
[51:27] powerful. But if you watch the stature
[51:29] of the perfect man and you see the seven
[51:32] steps, right? Sure. Remember just
[51:35] between the capstone Yeah. and the seven
[51:37] step, there was a a line called the Holy
[51:40] Ghost. Remember, Brother Bam drew it in
[51:41] there and it was what connected the two
[51:43] together. Do you know that represents
[51:45] the Jordan River?
[51:47] Yeah. So, if you laid down the pyramid
[51:50] of the statue of perfect man and you
[51:52] were walking as a map, when you got just
[51:55] before the capstone, you're going to
[51:57] have to take a leap over the Jordan.
[52:00] And then you would be in the promises.
[52:03] You wouldn't be in the journey getting
[52:04] there. You would be in it. And that
[52:08] right there is the capping
[52:11] of that pyramid which is Christ.
[52:14] So, Brother Brandham was lifted up,
[52:16] y'all. I forgive me. I I got a lot to a
[52:20] lot of quotes to back it, but I ain't
[52:21] got time to preach them. But, Brother
[52:22] Brandham is lifted up into this
[52:24] consolation. Do you Do you see what he's
[52:25] doing? He's going into the mind of God.
[52:30] He's because what you're supposed to be
[52:32] has been hid with that book from the
[52:35] time of Adam and nobody knows how to
[52:38] tell you what to be. Yeah, but here's a
[52:41] prophet going up into the headship of
[52:44] Christ. Now, in 1963 and 1964, he only
[52:48] talks about the
[52:50] angels. That's all he's talking about.
[52:52] It's the angels. The angels, the angels.
[52:54] But in 1965, he turns a picture to the
[52:57] right in the rising of the sun. He said
[52:59] the unfolding of the revelation, it's
[53:01] our Lord up there.
[53:04] And there he is. He said, there he is,
[53:06] his beard, his eyes. So there was there
[53:08] was seven
[53:10] angels but they were framing the face of
[53:13] somebody. Now that picture is how many
[53:15] knows that it's the picture of Daniel
[53:16] the 7th chapter the ancient of days.
[53:19] It's also the picture of what you read
[53:21] in Revelation chapter 1 and his hair was
[53:24] white like wool.
[53:26] It's also a picture of Revelations the
[53:29] 10th chapter when you read a mighty
[53:32] angel comes down out of heaven. Yeah.
[53:35] Now, that mighty angel that comes down,
[53:36] now let's talk about that a minute. The
[53:38] mighty angel that comes down out of
[53:40] heaven. Now, when brother Bram talks
[53:41] about that, he says he comes down out of
[53:43] heaven, he's a mighty angel, which makes
[53:45] you think that he's just an angel. But
[53:48] when you start listening to the prophet,
[53:50] he says, but look, he is a covenant
[53:53] angel.
[53:54] And look, when he comes in Revelations
[53:57] 10, he's coming with a book open in his
[54:00] hand. Now, that book that he has open in
[54:03] his hand is the same book that was in
[54:06] Revelations the 5th chapter that when
[54:08] John saw it, he said it was sealed with
[54:11] seven seals. But now in Revelations 10,
[54:14] he sees one who has that book in his
[54:17] hand and there's no seals on it,
[54:20] right? And he's coming to give that book
[54:22] to somebody. It's the seventh angel is
[54:25] on the earth at the time of this coming.
[54:28] And and brother Bam takes Revelation 10.
[54:29] He says, "Who is it?" He said, "Only
[54:31] Christ." It could be. Who else could
[54:33] hold that book?
[54:35] The covenant angel, Christ. He was the
[54:37] only one. He's the only one that could
[54:39] take the book. He's the only one to hold
[54:41] the book. He was the only one that could
[54:43] give the book.
[54:45] Brother Bam said, "There he stands
[54:46] tonight with a book in his hand. It's up
[54:47] to him who he's going to reveal it to."
[54:49] Now, now, now watch this because I I
[54:52] found a little something and since I've
[54:54] been home, I'm just going to share it.
[54:55] And you don't like it, it's okay with
[54:56] me. Amen. But but you but brother Bham
[55:00] says and you'll remember this there's
[55:02] two seven seals, right? There's the one
[55:03] he preached on that Sunday night and
[55:05] then Monday morning he recorded a
[55:07] version and took out part of the Sunday
[55:10] night and in put in Monday morning's
[55:12] version in his place. So I'm going to
[55:14] read to you two different places. And on
[55:17] the Sunday night portion he talks about
[55:19] he talks about how when those angels
[55:21] came to him that he was actually caught
[55:23] up into them. And he said remember them.
[55:26] He says, "Now you see, we're standing
[55:28] like this, and I was standing there
[55:30] watching, and the first bunch of them
[55:32] little birds, see their feathers beat
[55:34] down. Do you remember? They flew
[55:35] eastward. The second bunch brighter and
[55:37] brighter, and they they pointed their
[55:39] wings and they flew eastward." That was
[55:41] the first pull. Then the second pull, he
[55:43] said, "But then it was angels." Right?
[55:46] See, birds represented in first two. But
[55:49] the third was angels
[55:52] coming to the prophet. Yeah. And when he
[55:56] picks it up, he says it like this. I was
[55:57] standing right there explosion and I was
[55:59] looking and toward the west and they
[56:01] come and pick me up there and I went out
[56:03] of my knowing and the one of them coming
[56:06] was the one that looked strange to me
[56:08] and he on my left when I entered the
[56:10] consolation by the counting of left to
[56:12] right it would have been the seventh one
[56:14] coming across. He looked strange to him.
[56:16] It was notable and he was coming across.
[56:18] But let me read you the another portion
[56:19] of this from the other part of the
[56:20] seventh seal describing the same thing.
[56:23] That angel was to my left would be
[56:25] really the last the seventh angel
[56:27] counting from left to right he was on
[56:28] the left looking towards the west coming
[56:31] towards the west he would be on the left
[56:32] side so that would have been the last
[56:34] angel's
[56:35] message notable see you remember how I
[56:39] said it kind of his head back there his
[56:42] great sharp wings and how he flew right
[56:46] to me
[56:48] that is the seventh seal Yeah.
[56:54] Well, if you've been reading it as long
[56:55] as I've been reading it and missed it as
[56:57] many times as I missed it, let me read
[57:00] it to you
[57:02] again. And that angel flew right to
[57:06] me. That is the seventh
[57:10] seal. What was it doing? It was bringing
[57:14] the revelation of the word. I've asked
[57:16] the question a hundred times. Who was
[57:18] that angel?
[57:20] only Christ. It could be. It was God in
[57:24] angelic form delivering the message of
[57:28] the the message that we read.
[57:31] Preacher, what are you doing? I'm trying
[57:33] to get to you. What you're reading in
[57:35] this message isn't brother Brandham's
[57:36] opinion.
[57:38] It isn't just good theology. It's the
[57:41] word of the Lord. It's God coming to the
[57:45] church for the resurrection and rapture
[57:48] of this bride. Somebody said, "Well,
[57:50] amen. I don't want Brother Bam's
[57:51] opinions." The other day, I got to look
[57:52] at that and I thought, "You know what?
[57:54] Amen. Some of these opinions." Amen. But
[57:56] opinions are formed, aren't they? Aren't
[57:58] opinions formed? And they're usually
[58:00] formed by your influences and who's
[58:02] around you. And I thought, "Well,
[58:03] Brother Bram stays with that angel all
[58:04] the time. I think I'll take his
[58:06] opinion." So, I got to reading about
[58:08] opinions. You know what I found out? I
[58:10] found out that when the Supreme Court
[58:12] judge, when the Supreme Court makes a
[58:14] ruling, they call it an opinion. Yeah.
[58:18] So it matters who opinion it is. If it's
[58:21] the opinion of the Supreme Court, it's
[58:23] an absolute. And if it's the opinion of
[58:25] a prophet, it's more than just an
[58:27] opinion. It's something that God has
[58:29] given this generation. That we would not
[58:32] be confused. That we would come into the
[58:34] presence of the voice of the
[58:36] resurrection. I say something this
[58:38] morning. Amen. Sure, they could look at
[58:40] them church ages and say, "Oh, can these
[58:43] bones live?" But I say this son of man,
[58:45] he prophesied over this generation. And
[58:48] I'll say, can if I can, if I can just
[58:50] just say it to you very carefully, let
[58:52] me say it like this. This is not
[58:54] something you're going to fast your way
[58:56] into.
[58:57] [Applause]
[58:58] Amen. You couldn't fast that seven seal
[59:00] open. You couldn't pray that seven seal
[59:03] open. The part you're to play had to be
[59:06] gifted to you by the word coming to a
[59:09] prophet. That's why it's grace. Grace
[59:11] under the headstone. The greatest thing
[59:13] that ever happened in your life was when
[59:16] God came to you with this message and
[59:18] you just simply said, "I believe it. I
[59:20] trust in it. I believe it." What is it?
[59:23] It's It's tradition shattering. It's
[59:26] going to knock away all of those things
[59:29] off of your life that you might be able
[59:30] to be free. That you might be able to be
[59:33] gathered into his realm. What did he
[59:35] send this message to do? To call you the
[59:39] bride.
[59:40] He sent this message to gather you. The
[59:43] first thing comes is a gathering of this
[59:45] message. That's right. It's a gathering
[59:47] in just like a man gathers fish into the
[59:50] boat. A prophet gathered you into the
[59:53] bride. It was the third bull that did
[59:55] that for you. It was God coming to a
[59:58] prophet that did that to you. My when I
[1:00:01] think about this, well, brother Wayne,
[1:00:02] someday something's going to happen and
[1:00:04] it's going to gather us. The inspiration
[1:00:05] is here this morning together this
[1:00:08] church into the bride of Christ to the
[1:00:10] elected of God. God is calling. He's
[1:00:13] calling you out of every unbelief. He's
[1:00:15] calling you out of every veil and every
[1:00:17] tradition and every idea of man. Oh,
[1:00:20] come on, church. For years. For years.
[1:00:23] Amen. I I I don't have the ability to do
[1:00:25] this because I'm holding a I'm holding a
[1:00:27] I'm holding a uh mic as well. Come here
[1:00:29] a minute, buddy. Come here, brother
[1:00:31] Jacob. For years, this book, amen, was
[1:00:36] being held and it was like this. And it
[1:00:39] was under a veil. For years, it was
[1:00:42] under a veil. But in
[1:00:44] 1963, God took the veil off of it. But
[1:00:49] people that didn't want to believe it, a
[1:00:51] veil come upon them. And you're looking
[1:00:54] at it and he can't see it. But it's the
[1:00:57] obscurity of a veil. I say we take the
[1:00:59] obscurity away from this message. Amen.
[1:01:02] And begin to preach it without fear or
[1:01:04] failure. I don't care what the Baptist
[1:01:06] believe. I don't care what the
[1:01:08] Pentecostals believe. What does the
[1:01:11] Bible say about the hour we're living
[1:01:13] in? I'll tell you what it says. We've
[1:01:15] had a royal visit. We've had a visit
[1:01:17] from the King. He's come among us this
[1:01:20] morning to make to make an Esther out of
[1:01:23] you in authority and in power and in
[1:01:26] reality. It's more, sister Mariah. It's
[1:01:29] more than just our Christian experience
[1:01:31] of I prayed and I did this and I studied
[1:01:34] that and I this. This is the coming of
[1:01:36] the Lord. It's the rapture of the
[1:01:39] church.
[1:01:41] Hallelujah. It's the changing of our
[1:01:44] bodies.
[1:01:46] [Applause]
[1:01:47] It's more than that.
[1:01:50] Amen. That don't mean we're cutting away
[1:01:51] with a with a with a church. And that's
[1:01:54] not what that means. It means don't you
[1:01:56] put your heart in that.
[1:02:00] Jesus said, "Well, I tell you what, if I
[1:02:01] could just be a better person, if I I"
[1:02:05] And you just work yourself up and you
[1:02:06] get so frantic and you just and and and
[1:02:12] come on, church. What was it? What was
[1:02:14] that little room about? It was about
[1:02:16] resting. It was resting. And that's
[1:02:19] exactly what Ruth was commanded to do
[1:02:22] was you rest because he won't rest
[1:02:25] because he is the one that's marrying
[1:02:28] you.
[1:02:30] This is not you marrying him. He's
[1:02:32] marrying you. Come on church. You ran
[1:02:35] and he ran you down and you tried to
[1:02:38] hide and he uncovered you and brought
[1:02:40] you to him and you can't shake loose of
[1:02:43] him.
[1:02:46] Can Can I Can I just Can I be old
[1:02:48] hillbilly and say it to you the way I
[1:02:50] see it? God went fishing with this
[1:02:52] message.
[1:02:56] And he caught you, Brother Daryl.
[1:02:59] Now, that's the beauty, ain't it? Y'all
[1:03:01] tell me this. What fish ever caught a
[1:03:02] fisherman? Right.
[1:03:08] What dead man ever raised itself?
[1:03:12] What fish ever caught a fisherman? There
[1:03:14] ain't none. But that fisherman knows how
[1:03:17] to catch that fish. And our Lord is the
[1:03:19] great fisherman. And the Bible says he's
[1:03:22] never lost one of them. And if he ever
[1:03:24] puts a hook in you, he knows how to hold
[1:03:26] you.
[1:03:29] He knows how to hold you by the power of
[1:03:31] God. He knows how to hold you in your
[1:03:33] trials, in your temptations.
[1:03:35] [Applause]
[1:03:37] I fish a little myself and I have lost a
[1:03:39] big fish or two, but the older I got,
[1:03:42] the more I learned. And we hooked into
[1:03:44] them salmon up there. I don't know where
[1:03:46] brother Mark is. Brother Mark and
[1:03:47] Brother Troy and Brother Brian. Y'all
[1:03:49] fish with them things of they're in the
[1:03:50] river and got current and and you can
[1:03:52] you can use all you can use a little
[1:03:54] bitty hook and 17lb leader that ties
[1:03:56] into it. Well, if you get to if you get
[1:03:58] to cranking hard on that fish, you'll
[1:04:00] lose it. And I think me and Zach hooked
[1:04:02] five and caught one the first time we
[1:04:05] went. And I said, "Zack, we got we got
[1:04:08] to do it different. Something ain't
[1:04:09] something ain't working." About the
[1:04:10] second time we went, we hook six and
[1:04:12] caught five. But we learned loosen that
[1:04:16] drag a little. Let that thing run and
[1:04:19] when it and when it wears out, it'll
[1:04:20] come in easier.
[1:04:22] You You got a You got a hold of it. Why
[1:04:24] get in a hurry? Why get in a hurry? You
[1:04:28] got a hold of it. And you know that's
[1:04:30] exactly what God's done to you. He
[1:04:31] hooked you with this message and he just
[1:04:34] loosened the drag and you think, "Well,
[1:04:36] I got my own free will. I'll go do this
[1:04:38] and I'll go do that." He just lets the
[1:04:39] drag off a little bit and a little bit
[1:04:41] later you'll get tired and he'll just
[1:04:43] start cranking you back. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:04:46] He never lost you. You've never been off
[1:04:49] of the hook. You've never been off of
[1:04:51] the hook. He hooked you. And I say this
[1:04:54] morning, it's not what I did. It's what
[1:04:56] he hooked into me. And he won't let me
[1:04:59] go. And someday he's going to take us in
[1:05:02] the rapture. He's going to gather us in
[1:05:05] his home. Stand to your feet with me
[1:05:07] this morning. This is the collected body
[1:05:10] of the bride of Jesus Christ. Do you
[1:05:13] love him this morning?
[1:05:17] No, he ain't losing you.
[1:05:21] He ain't losing you. No, he hooked into
[1:05:25] you.
[1:05:28] Glory. We just use them old single
[1:05:31] hooks, you
[1:05:32] know. He got the three-pronged
[1:05:35] ones. He didn't just hook you with one
[1:05:37] point. He got three in you.
[1:05:43] Hallelujah. Do you
[1:05:44] see? You've been claimed.
[1:05:48] Amen.
[1:05:49] You've been captured.
[1:05:52] You've been collected. Yes. Right.
[1:05:56] That's why the Bible says that the
[1:05:58] rapture is a snatching.
[1:06:03] It's the actual Greek word.
[1:06:06] It means to be snatched, right? To be
[1:06:09] kidnapped,
[1:06:12] how do you kidnap your own kid?
[1:06:16] Ah, then it's not
[1:06:23] illegal. Do you
[1:06:25] see the more you look at
[1:06:30] you, there's where your revival went,
[1:06:34] where your joy went. Right.
[1:06:37] And the more you think, well, if I could
[1:06:39] do this, then I would and if I could and
[1:06:41] well,
[1:06:43] just like this, that's true.
[1:06:47] The moment you turn and look what he
[1:06:49] done,
[1:06:52] what he done,
[1:06:55] how many's here the morning I was
[1:06:56] preaching on those pardons?
[1:06:58] You remember that?
[1:07:00] And I mentioned Joe Biden. The whole
[1:07:01] church froze up.
[1:07:05] They thought, "What can he say good
[1:07:07] about this guy?"
[1:07:09] And I said, "But it was preemptive
[1:07:11] pardon, right?" Remember that?
[1:07:15] Well, our buddy, Mr. Trump, just done
[1:07:17] something this week. You know what he
[1:07:18] did?
[1:07:20] He took a lady that had been a life
[1:07:22] sentence in
[1:07:24] prison and he he he gave her a shortened
[1:07:27] sentence, but later he gave her a full
[1:07:30] pardon. And just yesterday he announced
[1:07:34] she's now our pardons zar.
[1:07:38] So a woman that used to be a prisoner
[1:07:41] is now in charge of handing out pardons.
[1:07:44] G. I thought oh Jesus.
[1:07:50] I needed one.
[1:07:53] And now I'm looking for people to give
[1:07:55] them to.
[1:07:59] Won't you receive it this morning? Yes,
[1:08:01] there's no limit on the amount of that
[1:08:03] we can give out today,
[1:08:07] friends. What an amazing God. What
[1:08:10] amazing God, brother Ben.

[1:08:31] valley. Hide me from the
