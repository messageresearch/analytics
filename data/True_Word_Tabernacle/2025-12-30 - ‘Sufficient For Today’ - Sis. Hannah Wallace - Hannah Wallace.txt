TRANSCRIPT
========================================
There [singing] may be storms [music] that will move [singing] out the way [music] and trials [singing] will [music] come to only test [music] my faith. What I've learned about your favor, [music] your mercy and your grace, [music] as they go on forever, [singing] they're sufficient for today. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When I'm worried about [singing] tomorrow, I won't be overwhelmed. [music] And the burdens that I've carried, [music] I will choose to &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; lay them down. Cuz what I've learned about [singing] your favor, [music] your mercy, and [music] your grace is they go [singing] on forever. They're sufficient for [singing and music] today. Hallelujah. [singing] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] They're sufficient for today. In the joy [singing] and in [music] the sorrow, I find you [singing] just [music] the same. And behind my darkest [singing] morning, there's a peace [music] I can't explain. pain. Oh, I'm so grateful for your favor, your mercy, and your grace. [singing] Oh, cuz [music] they go on forever and they're sufficient for today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They're sufficient for today. One day I'll finely [singing] see you.
