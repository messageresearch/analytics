TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] thank you Lord You're so welcome Among Us this morning we believe you Lord we trust you every family every Affliction Lord all things [Music] are amen amen what a love what a lovely atmosphere to step out into this morning amen amen introduced to the presence of the Living God Amen who is here this morning that brother bandam said the same as he was that morning that Mary met him at the tomb that the two walked with him on the road to EMAs and he said there's a an inner charge of the new birth on the inside of you that can feel the presence as he moves through the church which is a witness of his resurrection power amen I'm so glad to know this morning that it's not just a story to us amen but we have had that Pentecostal blessing that is the Vindication of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and that we're identified with people who actually feel the resurrection as it sweeps over the building amen amen we certainly love you this morning and amen it's a tremendous time I so good to see everyone this morning some of the guests that are among us God bless you and we just pray the Lord bless your your time with us here today and then amen and we just have some special a special time in this time of the year I know and brother Braham says you know Christmas falls in December said but it's not even close to the birthday of the Lord he said but just as sure as the lightning would strike in the darkness of night it proves there can be light in the middle of Darkness amen he said so it's a sacred time for us no matter if it was July or June or whenever it happens he said just remember if there had been no Christmas there'd be no Resurrection amen so we don't go into the world and all the things they do and follow after that but we're thankful for a savior this morning amen we're thankful amen that there was a Christmas amen so there could be a resurrection amen this morning we have a few things on our heart and just before we read the word maybe we just go to the Lord in a word of prayer there be something special that you have need with such an atmosphere like this I believe you can ask and receive Heavenly Father we thank you this morning Lord the atmosphere of the holy spirit that is just so real yes the power and Lord the very Vindication of your Resurrection still moving Lord in a blessing among your people now Lord Jesus as we come to you this morning we're asking you that you would step on the platform Lord and may you take your word and may you bless your children Lord and father I I thank you for the grace to be able to stand here today now we commit this service into thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles let's go to the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I want to read this 19 uh verse down to the uh 22nd verse and I do um uh not really probably got a Christmas message this morning you forgive me um there's just some things on her heart and amen and uh we'll we'll wrap it in there but uh there's just some things there's just some things uh that is dealing with me that I I just pray it' be a blessing to you amen uh Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 19 amen and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe ACC according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places now far above principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in the world but also in that which is to come and Heath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of of him that filth all in all amen we ask the Lord to bless his words you could be seated this morning amen I I want to take some of these uh thoughts from this context and I think it's very powerful uh to see here that the scriptures uh are are the way that they're written it's amazing how Paul says here if you go back to the 17th verse he prays that the god of the father would open give us the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him and then the next verse he asked that the eyes of our understanding being opened that we can see the power in US amen that he wasn't wanting us just to see amen uh the Revelation knowledge of God but that that he wanted us to see that how it works in our calling in our hopes and our inheritance in Christ now this morning I want to I want to speak to you a little bit and you you'll see a little more where I'm at but I want to take for a title a context this morning out of here and I want to talk to you thy people are willing in the day of power the people are willing in the day of power amen and so that's where I'm headed so if you can maybe hear this in the in the in the text uh I think it's a powerful thing to realize amen that if you can see Christ put on the throne if you can see his Ascension and by seeing his Ascension you can see all things that are dark has been placed under him every name that can be named has been placed under him and if you can ever see that as that that's what's positioned him there then you can turn around and look at yourself and then you can claim your right as a member of that glorified body and then we can also stand with all of our spiritual adversities below us because that you see him in that place then you can see yourself in that place because you're in that body amen one thing uh I I I I do know that we're never able to Lift Jesus too high because for as high as you lift the Lord Jesus you have also placed the church in the same place being that we are of his body and I love how that the prophet teaches us amen so we understand that we are of his body now uh I believe that what we have been given uh here in the Church of course is immeasurable and I believe that it's vast and I believe it's endless and and I could say incalculable and immense and it's Untold and it's massive and it's great and it's colossal and it's unlimited it's unconstrained it's bottomless Amen in other words when God begins to give to the church in his power it is an unlimited vastas uh without boundaries kind of power that he's given when you think of power brother mam always uses the Omni uh you could you could say the Omni uh uh uh of God you know he talks about omnipresence and he talks about omnipotence well when he talks about om omnipotence what omnipotence speaks of it speaks of all power amen uh brother Nathan actually quoted that from Thursday which that was a powerful sermon Thursday God bless you brother Nathan how many enjoyed that word amen amen if you U if you hadn't heard it uh as your pastor I'm asking you go listen to it amen and you visitors could hear it too get it it's a powerful sermon I sent it down to brother Josh spett He said brother Wayne that might be one of the top 10 I've heard in a long time I said it was powerful the only thing wrong with it it more people need to hear it amen amen but in in in omnipotence meaning amen that it is all power and and and I'll say this brother bam tells us that that's the power of God is all power see omnipotent power and then in the message uncertain sound brother Bram will take this and he will show that when these two begin to meet and and he'll take it he'll say see uh he talks about uh Martha when she's coming to the tomb and he says see these two omnipotence when they begin to meet he says one omnipotent she had she had a perfect omnipotent faith in Christ he said and Christ was omnipotent so she had a perfect in infinite faith in Christ and that he was the Lord and knowed whatever he asked God God would give see now see what her Revelation was he was God and whatever he wanted God would give because he was an authority he said see you just speak the word and all you have to do whatsoever you ask God God will give it she saw that amen then that's omnipotent power he says all right he was all powerful that's when two powers or two omnipotent Powers begin to meet together what you what in Ephesians chapter one you have to see these two together you have to see he's omnipotent but the church is omnipotent as well when they're placed within him it's an omnipotent faith in an omnipotent God now when we say this uh if you remember when we started these series we pulled up a uh three mysteries that brother Adam speaks about he speaks about the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will and the Mystery of a setting together you'all remember those three mysteries the mystery of his coming of course Elohim mdic that's the mystery of it and then the mystery of his will speaks of the adoption or the thoughts of God coming into the church but the third part of that mystery is us sitting together with God Amen in other words that these things will seat us in the presence of God Amen the word of life so they're setting us together now in Ephesians chapter 2 you'll see Paul will say this he says and he has raised us up together see two omnipotence he has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you have to see that you're sitting together see that's what the church our hearts what we really need to see is that we're sitting together and I I think it's powerful to see that Jesus here as he's being lifted up Paul is saying that we might be able to see what is the the exceeding greatness of his power that works when God raised Jesus from the dead when you see that power that exceeding power that raised him from the dead body all the way to the throne of God then you can see the power that is working in you to bring you from a sinner all the way to the throne of God the same power that raised him from a dead cold body he put him in the Throne of God with everything under his feet that same power is the power that is in the believer that raises you from the world and makes you over all things in this life you said brother way I want that power that power is the power of the Resurrection it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the power that will raise you up you see what Paul says in Ephesians chapter 3 and 19 and 20 he said now to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we think or ask according to the power that worketh in us I love how Paul says that amen now here he's telling you in Ephesians 1 that we've got to see that power now he's says that that power which worketh in us can do exceedingly abundant whatever you think or ask this power that worketh in US is already there Colossians chapter 1 I love how Paul said I made a minister according to the dispensation of God given to me to fulfill the word of God he said even the mystery which had been heal from the ages and from Generations is now made manifest in the Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present you perfect in Christ Jesus wherefore I also labor striving according to his working which worketh mightily in me amen amen see what he's doing he's working according to that which is working within him which is the power that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power working in you it's the power amen that is making you do what you do amen it's not you that's doing the work it's Christ in you I love how brother Ram said it was personal identification right he said personally identified in you doing the things you couldn't do amen hating the things you used to love and loving the things you used to hate what power is that that's the same power that raised Jesus from the the dead is now working in the church amen see this working this working speaks of an energy in the church now I love how it because if you here in Colossians chapter 1 it speaks of the New Testament of course it's a Greek word and it's energist which means the state of being at work the energy or the efficiency it's a superhuman energy working in the church when Paul wrote this in the Greek he didn't say that energy is working in me such as like you had a little caffeine or you was in a good mood that's not the energy he's talking about working he said there's another energy it's a superhuman work working inside of me in other words there's a spirit that's went to work in my life that is a a superhuman thing that I I don't understand but it's the same power that raised Jesus from the dead and it's now working in me see according to Ephesians chapter 1 verse 19 he says he he he says I love how he says it he says it's his working of his strength and of his might that God works his strength and of his might this actually is only used in when you're speaking of God the working of strength in other words it's one thing to have strength it means an indwelling power so when you look at God and you can say well enemy is all power but you see when it comes to the church amen it's not just a power that is in God but it's a power that's exhibited by God in other words amen it's one thing for him to just have power but to not see that power work how would you know the power that resists in him but Paul is saying that we see the exceeding greatness of his power that is working in our life when you see Jesus raised from the dead that's the same power exhibited when God gets a hold of a Believer to raise him from the dead and I love it because you see it only speaks of relative and manifested power listen there is no power unless it's manifested power we don't know the power of God unless it's manifested power and we have seen the manifestation of the power of God in the resurrection of Jesus Christ my when I think about it the working of this strength it is to be connected with the exceeding greatness of his power the magnitude of God's power towards Believers is known in the operation of his strength I love how Paul says it he said I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I don't want to just know him in word I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know him like that amen amen and the scripture says that's what raised him up and set him at his own right hand I I think of this today uh if you if you turn with me Ephesians chapter 1 it says set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places but turn with me to Psalms 110 and and we'll read the first four verses here this is David a psalmist when he's singing of the Messiah now I I I think that that of course this goes way through the scripture but let's just take a moment and watch the Scripture A Psalm of David the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand now here it is in Ephesians now you can see these guys listening to Paul this great Old Testament Theologian is now applying to Jesus the testimony of of Psalms 110 that he would be set at the right hand now if you just hear this as a gentile well he set at the right hand of the father that don't mean a lot just as a gentile but as a Jew they knew that was a direct Messianic prophecy that MDC was to set as a as a priest in God's throne and watch what he says in Psalm of David the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol for the Lord shall send the rod of the strength of Zion and rule in the midst of thine enemies and the people shall be willing in the day of thy power there's my title there amen the people shall be willing in the day of thy power and in the beauty of Holiness from the womb of the morning thou Hast to do of thy youth for the Lord has sworn isn't that powerful for the Lord has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of mcedc now we're talking about in that day David singing this under inspiration he saw that his own son would be his Lord he saw the son of David would be his own Lord amen I tell you what a how did David keep it in amen but as he began to sing this amen thou the song he began to sing now it was when Jesus first mentions this in Matthew 22 when Jesus himself picks up this same prophecy and begins to apply it unto Christ look what he says he said what think you of Christ whose son is he let you say unto him the son of David he saith unto them how then David in the spirit calls him Lord saying the Lord said to my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foottoo if David then call him Lord amen how is he his son but the if if you're reading this what What's Happening Here is David Jesus says that David under inspiration called him his son his Lord David got under inspiration and saw that Jesus wouldn't just be the son of David that he would be the Lord Of Glory and he knew that he was a priest like they had priest but this would be a different kind of priest this would be a god priest this would be a king priest this what God was becoming a priest amen what he was doing is David had knew this but Jesus is starting to identify this with himself now David was a powerful he was a prophet and a pssst but in the uh in Psalms chapter 16 now we're reading Prophecies of Jesus sitting at the right hand Amen in Psalms 16 verse 8 watch this for I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand and I shall not be moved therefore is my heart glad and my glory rejoices and my flesh shall Rest In Hope for thou will not suffer th will not leave my soul in Hell neither without thou suffer the Holy One to see corruption th th will show me the path of life and in the presence of Joy at thy right hand are Pleasures forever more now isn't that something David hundreds of years before Paul writes Ephesians chapter 1 said this mecdc this son this virgin born son will sit at the right hand of God and he will be the ambassador of the human race he will be the king that takes the kingdom for the human race and puts all enemies amen of Adam race under his feet and David saw this and he knew he would have to be a human but he knew he would be a different kind of human he knew he would be a God man and he knew he would have to die but he would never see corruption because he was the only one of God and the same power that would let him go in the grave would also raise him up and set him at the right hand of God where he would rule Supreme over everything because he is the king of kings and he is the Lord of lords I'm talking about Jesus Christ the son of God who sits at the right hand of God today listen folks amen I think we ought to blow a trumpet and tell all of Hell there is one of us on the throne of God one of my kind a humankind a man is on the throne of God my puts this church in power if you can see your own what if you can see your own husband sitting on the throne amen you would know that you share that Throne because he's your husband he's not just our King he's not just our Lord he's our savior but he's also the husband of the church and we are connected to the throne of God I love how he says it here in Mark 16 y'all forgive me I might not be able to SP to teach much I this is all over me amen Mark 16 in the 19th verse so then after the Lord has spoken unto them he was received up into heaven these are not Disney stories folks this is reality amen they watch him being received into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God yes sir therefore they went and preached everywhere look they they saw the heavens receive him and they knew he was to set at the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming what their words with signs and wonders I tell you what if you ever see him on the throne and you're representing him you'll know there's something backing this word up we're not just a bunch of preachers out here saying things who are empty words there's somebody on the throne that's backing these things up amen now in the book of Acts Peter uses the same scripture if you go to Acts chapter 7 in the 23rd verse it's a little lengthy but we'll see how much of it here in the 23rd verse this is the Peter's sermon he's saying being delivered by the determined counsel the forn knowledge of God he have taken and by Wicked hands crucified and slain whom God hath raised up and having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it for David speak concerning him I foresaw the Lord before my face for he is my right hand and I shall not be moved see now now Peter is taking the exact prophecy of Psalm 16 therefore did my heart Rejoice my tongue glad moreover My Flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption thou H has made known to me the ways of life thou shall make full of joy with thy countenance men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that is both dead and buried and his supper is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had swor with an oath that of the fruit of loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to set on his throne he seeing this before spoke of the Resurrection that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus God hath raised wherefore we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he shed forth this which you now see and hear amen now they were watching this demonstration of the Holy Spirit and he's saying he put this here that you're now seeing and hearing he shed this forth which you now seeing here for this David is not ascended un the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said it my unto my Lord set thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foottoo therefore let all the house of Israel assuredly know that the God hath made the same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ isn't that amazing amen can you can you imagine sitting there and they're seeing all this disturbance and they're saying what meth these things and Peter actually just says what happened is y'all killed the Lord Of Glory and God had raised him up and set him at the right hand as he promised that they would do and now because he's at the right hand of God he's sending forth this spirit that you're now witnessing amen and and couldn't we preach the same sermon this morning he said what is all this noise and what is all the commotion what is all this going on well let me tell you they crucified the Lord Jesus and on the third day God raised him up and he ascended under the heavens and set at the right hand of God and this that you do see it here is because my Jesus is both Lord and Christ and he says this morning in power and in reality listen Jesus Is Not Dead Jesus is not an imagination Jesus is a Son of God that sits on the throne of God and he's ruling this morning for the children of God that we do not have to come here to a powerless religion hallelujah hallelujah wo Glory he set him at his own right hand amen I don't want to cover you up with scripture but if you got your Bibles or you want to just come along Hebrews 12 and verse 2 Paul says again he endured the cross despising the same shame and is sat down at the Throne of God in First Peter Peter says he has gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God and angels and authorities and Powers are made subject unto him in Hebrews 1 and3 he was the brightness of his glory the expressed image of his person upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high in Hebrews 8 Paul says he said now of things which he has spoken of in this son we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty on high in Hebrews chapter 10 Paul brings it down he says but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottoo look at that he ties it right back to Psalms 110 amen for by one offering he perfected forever them that are Sanctified wherefore the Holy Ghost is also a witness to us for after that he had had said before now it's not till you get to Hebrews 7 that it gets so absolutely plain that you cannot that you cannot defer nor deny unless you deny the whole Bible that Jesus Christ became that MDC became Jesus Christ now brother Ram said that Jesus wasn't mcedc he said but mcedc became Jesus Christ is that right now if you read Hebrews 7 you'll see that he was a man when he met Abraham right but not a virgin born son brother said a created being he just took dust and blew it and stepped into it and talked with him he said there he was the word mcedc talking to Abraham visiting with him right amen now that that meaned that visited with him he said but but he said watch but he was a man without beginning of days or ending of life and brother BR said whoever that is he's still alive tonight amen without beginning of days or ending of Life he's still alive tonight amen and he still the word and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the the word became flesh and we beheld his glory as the only begotten Son of God isn't that amazing amen that that word became flesh the word who was MDC became flesh in the man Jesus Christ and Paul caught the Revelation and begin to lay out to the church that this AR onic priesthood out here that's making all these sacrifices they're only sacrificing every year because their sacrifices don't have power to remove your sins we only keep this tradition up because there's nothing that can remove the sins but he said but but oh God we have another priest amen and and the Bible said nothing of a priest coming out of Judah amen but there was a son to come out of Judah there was a ruler to come out of Judah amen mdct himself Wass to descend into the humanity by a virgin birth to become a priest for her you and I Hallelujah my goodness amen I I say I say Hebrews chapter 7 watch Paul he said therefore Perfection whereby the levitical priesthood and under the people received the law what further need was there for any other priest to rise after the order of mcedc and not called after the order of Aaron isn't that something if everything was okay then why did we have another priest amen but for the priesthood changed and that made a necessity also for a change of the law for he whom a things were spoken pertaineth another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood and yet it is far more evident that after the similitude of mecdc there ariseth another priest so Paul is taking Jesus and mecdc and putting them together as the one who sits at the right hand of God Amen and he's showing you he was made not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life this priest that we have did not come from the law of carnal commandment it didn't come from the law of Moses it come out of the Endless life and that today look folks amen whether you know it or not you are a kingdom of priest you are a priesthood of God and you're not under the law of carnal commandment but under the power of an endless life our priest never dies and the power of our priesthood is just as real are to priest Forever After the order of mcedc and there is verily disano of the Commandment before the weakness and unproffesional and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of mecdc he said the priest you have that you're trusting to take away your sins every year they're made without an oath right amen they're is coming under the carnal Commandments they was without an oath but this Jesus was made by an oath for God himself said I swear and will not repent that there shall come a priest after the order of mecdc God himself would become your priest and he wouldn't have to offer many sacrifices but he would offer himself the blood of his own body he would offer one time and sit down at the right hand of God and perfect forever them that are Sanctified I tell you what this morning there is no greater priesthood there is nothing greater than what God has done for the church amen I won't finish reading that but you can read Hebrews 7 in Romans chapter 8 Paul said it he said who is it then that condemneth it is Christ that died now we've just spent some time to prove Christ was mdct it is Christ that died rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God making intercession for us who can condemn a man when the elct is his priest amen who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect for it is God that justifies thank you Lord Jesus my goodness when you when you see the reality that look at Paul when he says in Colossians if you be risen in Christ seek the things which are above where Christ sth at the right hand of God the Bible says here in Peter amen that he's went under Heavens now now if you're if you're following this line in scripture and you get to Revelations the third chapter you get in the 21st verse you'll see that Jesus actually says to you to him that overcometh will I grant to set with me in my throne even as I overcame and sit down with my father in his throne as he did it by an oath by the power of God so can the church do it by oath and the power of God as he overcame so can you overcome now I know today I know that there's a lot of I know there's a lot of self-help books and I know probably some of them help some people I'm sure amen but but I will say this there ain't no self-help getting you to that Throne that's right matter of fact it'll take death to self to get to where I'm talking about now the Hindus they were blown away of the Gospel there in India and I'll tell you why because they believe you need 10 new births to get to the highest Ascension of their religion they think you have to live 10 good lives one after the other mess up about three way in you go back one and you go amen it's it's perpetual life and according to the way you lived in this life you go backwards and forwards but you can't get there any shorter than 10 births amen but it's amazing when you come to the gospel that Paul is teaching us that one New Birth can put a man on the throne of God sharing in power and authority and listen there's nothing higher than man with God in him that's why God quit creating in the Garden of Eden he went so high and he quit creating why because he reached the Apex of creation he created a man in the image of God God there is nothing higher come on are you hearing me there is nothing higher and he was raised to sit on the throne of God with all things under his feet because Jesus is the highest level of Life angels and demons and principalities and powers and all things were put under his feet and you were born Sons and Daughters of God there is nothing higher when you recognize who you are there is no Throne No Dominion there's no devil there's no disease there is no power there is nothing higher than a Son of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the highest form of life I know people look at us and all holy rollers and all and that bunch of fanaticism and they put you down because they think but brother if you ever see the reality of it you have been set in the highest of heights and everything else is beneath it woo Glory now now TR trinitarians I'm sorry I'm loaded I've been studying it it's on my heart I can't help it but but Trin TR trinitarians they they try to use scripture to prove as more than one God right so they'll take scriptures like this he sits at the right hand and then they'll take Revelations 5 brother B deals with the church M book and the lamb came and took the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne and brother B says see indeed in these isolated verses you could believe there's more than one he said you could prove your point isolated verses he said but read Revelation chter 4 and go in the second and third verse in the nth and 11th verse and watch Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive honor and glory and power for thou has created all things and the pleasure thou art created now carefully note verse two it says one not two one one sat on the throne in verse three he says he not they were to look on as jasper stone and verse n it says the Beast gave honor to him not them in verse 10 it says and that the elders fell down and worshiped him not them in verse 11 it says and that they cried Thou Art Worthy oh Lord not Lords see in verse 11 it says one on the throne was a Creator which is Jesus which is Jehovah Spirit god of the old Testament amen my I'm reading the church book joh Genesis chapter 1 now he says see that's the thing if you read it let's go to Revelations three to him that overcometh what I grant to set in my throne even as I have overcome and sat down with my father in his throne and then he goes of course to Hebrews 12 and verse 2 he said despising the shame of the Cross he has set down in other words the reward was to set at the right hand but notice According To Jesus himself who wrote the revelation he has sat down with the father and Paul which the spirit of Christ the spirit of Prophecy it was on Paul says he sat down at the right hand of God Amen see Jesus said as I have overcame and I am sit down in my father's Throne do you see what he say I'm sitting on my father's throne but Paul in in the spirit of Prophecy said he sits at the right hand of God see now what's he doing he's setting at the right hand but when John looked he only saw one he says see what he's saying to you is Revelations 5 follows Revelations 3 he set you up to see there was one God and then he showed the actions amen of two people but it's offices of God right and that what is it brother R said the mystery of one God he came Jesus came out of God became manifested In the Flesh and died and rose again and the and then returned to the bosom of the father my goodness the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him John 1 and18 what was it see he had declared him what was going on he come out of God he went back into God Jesus said I have come from God and I go back to God do you see when Paul sees this he sees the right hand but but brother brandom really gives us the reality he said the right hand only signifies power and authority that's what happened in Matthew 17 when the spirit of God came down and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him he gave him all power and all authority and Jesus himself said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me then brother Bram says if there's another God up there he said he's powerless yeah amen do you see what it is now he extended that power to the church what good would it do for him to set in power unless he was giving power from the throne he Seth in the right hand now you can see that he did not just take it for himself and I think this is powerful points now he didn't just take it for himself but the Bible itself declares in the revelations that he had in his right hand Seven Stars amen so Jesus didn't just take power and Authority and then hold it into the heavens but he gave it back on the earth and he sent Seven Stars upon the Earth and these Seven Stars were seven Messengers amen and those Messengers begin to receive the spirit and authority of God and he backed them up he says he put all power into them what was he doing he was showing his delivering power on the earth because he is in heaven now now I I just want to maybe maybe could we could we just travel and Wyatt could be Shepherds we'll we'll help the Christmas folks here for a moment why why it had to be Shepherds Heen uh you know um I'm kidding uh and why it had to be Shepherds you know Moses comes up there and God tells Moses from the burning bush to go down and deliver the people but Moses said Lord I'm not going to go down there without you showing me your glory yeah see I'm I'm not going to go down there cuz I can't even talk I'm not going to they're not going to believe me I I I I can't do anything when I get there and God told him he'd give him two signs watch and he shows him his glory brother Bram illustrates this why I had to be Shepherds I won't slow down and read a bunch but I'll I'll say what brother Bram said he said but watch how Moses became God Amen right Moses Moes became God before the burning bush he said now God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom brother BR said now we have no reason to believe Moses was left-handed he said so we believe he put his right hand into his bosom he said which was a type of God the Father taking his right hand over his heart where all of his secrets were hid amen he said that right right hand was Jesus and he said watch when he pulls it out it's in the last stages of leprosy it's already in the last stages now brother man said why was it so far Advanced he said because that's exactly where the world was standing he said the when Jesus came on the earth sin had already taken its toll and they were in the last stages of death he said and here comes out of the bosom of God his right hand to show where the sin symptoms are in the world he said but then God reveals the secret to the answer he restores it back into his hand his bosom and when he pulls it out the second time he said there's no leprosy on it showing that God taking Jesus from his bosom and returning him to his bosom would be the thing that would totally destroy the leprosy of sin Let me say something to you this morning sin has already been defeated leprosy has already been defeated look look how quick it happened brother B said that day you eat shall surely die sin came that quick he said but look at how quick it left when he pulled his hand out it was all over he said and when Jesus was on the cross he said it is finished and it's all over amen but what did he do he returned his bosom he turned his right hand to his bosom now brother R said There It Is He said Jesus came to the Earth killed and paid the debts of sin but when was finished he returned to the bosom of the father now this powerful to me I don't have time to read them I wish I did but he said he returned to the bosom of the father and he said from there amen watch he extended his hand to the Believers look what Moses did when he saw the supernatural he didn't stay up on the mountain by himself he didn't stay up there at the pillar fire rejoicing in his experience with the right hand of God but he was sent down to deliver the children of God to bring the omnipotent power which he had saw to deliver the Church of the Living God it's written in the scripture for I will deliver thee with a mighty hand it wasn't the hand of Moses that delivered the children of God it was God's hand that delivered them and it's the hand of God this morning that delivers the church put thy hand in thy bosom and restore when he pulled his hand back out that secret that had been in God's bosom all these years was covered by his right hand that was Jesus he was wounded for our transgressions that right hand was drawn the second time and it had no sin brother Bram said oh it was finished God's right hand from his bosom then on Easter he returned it and and raised it up again and extended it down to you and I in the form of his word my goodness the hand returned in the form of his word brother Bram said no wonder it was that the mountains jumped for Joy he said no wonder it was the sin the sun hit his face and screamed for Joy no wonder nature broke loose and the wind Shook and the trees Shook and they joyed and they jumped they seen the prophet Shepherd on the mountain oh God redeem every name on The Book of Life and their own nature was redeemed they screamed they jumped and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains rink and the Rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you it's finished brother man he takes he takes all of that he says like in any meeting he says when you see the shepherd reveals to you it's finished I've seen jumping spells and joy spells y'all remember this quote sir it's amazing where where he's putting it I've seen jumping spells and joy spells and the mountains rung out the sun went down and everything took place he said oh but there was nobody hurt I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people and they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order Hallelujah it's right in order this morning don't you let no devil tell you you're out of order come on church it's in order we've seen our names revealed we've seen the great prophet Shepherd on the mountain we see it's finished the word of the Lord has come to the church I tell you there's never been a Christmas like this Christmas there's never been an age like this age the great prophet Shepherd but man said why did he have to come to Shepherds he said cuz nobody else would humble themselves to it because the the very lamb was being born in a manure pile so the church has to be ready to stink like the animals to be looked at to be cast down to be talked about to be a fanatic but brother wherever Jesus is that's where I want to be if it's in a barn stall or in a come on you you can say anything you want to about this church but I'll say one thing we got room for Jesus I say open up the doors and Let Jesus come in my that great prophet Shepherd had brought them the message man I just love that that great prophet Shepherd brought that message to them no matter Heen what was it hey man it was the Lord sending his strength into of the church watch that Psalms 110 watch that second verse for the Lord shall send thy rod of thy strength out of Zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies amen the rod of strength out of Zion all right types yeah who's Zion the yes sir brother BR said when you read Zion in here now you're reading about the bride amen right and the Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of where is his strength coming from amen the rod of thy strength what what you say what what what what what is it it's allegories watch this next verse watch the sixth verse yet I have set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion Psalms chapter 2 sorry and the sixth verse yet I have set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion and I will declare the decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my son yeah this day have I begotten thee and ask of me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth as thy possession watch what he says I have set my king Upon A Holy Hill of Zion amen where that King sitting today yeah amen come on on a Holy Hill of Zion yes sir where's he where's where's the strength coming out of Amen where is he enthroned this morning come on I know his Corporal bodies in heaven we've already proved that but that token that literal life that was in Jesus the one that raised him from the dead is the same very life that has raised the church from the dead and has put itself on the throne and heart of every believer and he shall come from there you said brother Wayne I don't know about this well I I'll give you a scripture in Hebrews chapter 4 Paul says these things are an allegory yeah he said see he speaks of of of two mountains Mount SII which is in Arabia he said in answer to Jerusalem which now is is in bondage of her children but Jerusalem which is free is from above which is the mother of us all he was using allegories of cities as people amen you know you're also the New Jerusalem right sure now where have we come to when you when you when you come into to we we call it the message but when you come into the gospel is the message and the gospel is is no separation there right somebody said well did Paul have everything but but Paul put put it there brother Brown brought it to Revelation sir okay but but where have you come to when you come into this Paul says it in Hebrews 12 you didn't come to the mount that cannot be touched remember the Mountain of Fire where they couldn't touch it and anything touch it had to die Paul said in the 18th verse you didn't come to that mountain but he turns around and he says but you are come to the Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an enable company of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven now watch what he continues and God the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel now you say preacher what do you saying now watch watch watch what Psalms is teaching and out of Zion shall come the rod of thy strength and thou shalt set upon thine holy heel watch what he's what's what he's teaching us this Rod of strength is speaking of the Gospel yeah it's speaking of the strength of the Holy Ghost coming out now many times it was spoke of watch brother Bram over in Isaiah 28 he picks up the sixth verse and brother said the spirit of judgment to him that Seth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle brother said there it is to him that will stand in the gate for the battle his strength is the Holy Ghost he said and how does his strength come with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak you unto my people and this is the rest wherein I cause the weary to rest amen the strength of the church is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen I believe it I believe the Holy Ghost already to be in the Pulpit I believe that because I believe a lot of what's wrong with this loudy in the age that we're living in is weak pulpits come on how do you preach an experience when you never had one how can you teach people how to receive the Holy Ghost when you never had it how can you get strength to overcome when you've never overcame how can you preach it when you don't know it the weakness of the pull pit has brought a weak generation amen but if there is strength in the house of the Lord if there is strength coming out of Zion there will be a congregation with strength in them strength to resist the devil strength to fight because they know where their strength is coming from amen amen I could preach a long time on strength sorry but all right now the gospel is the arm of the Lord right in P son Isaiah 53 said for the arm of the Lord yes who hath believ our report who has believed the arm of the report now when this report comes it does not come powerless the gospel doesn't come powerless folks right amen it says I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God under salvation to everyone that believes I know we got stacks of books these days of steps to become a Christian listen amen the gospel is the way the power of God is the way the Holy Ghost is the way it's the way back it's the way back to our Authority it's the power of God listen to the Jew first and also to the Greek first Thessalonians Paul amen that great scholarly man yeah Paul was a scholar but he said Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but in also in power and in the Holy Ghost with much Assurance Paul didn't believe just in a in a in a little teaching sermon and let people walk away with their lives ruined and and they couldn't get healing and couldn't get deliverance and they couldn't come on we've taught over a lot of things in our ages people you can teach over little things you can just teach it and it'll go right over the congregation but you turn that Holy Ghost loose preaching in a church one time and then it'll turn over every Rock people might get mad they might get upset but the Holy Ghost ghost is still a discerner of the thought and the intents of the heart and it'll go right to where you're living the god of David is still the God of this bride and if he could take a rock and throw it and God could make it hit the right place and I believe a gospel preacher in this age amen amen he might not sound like much but all he's got to do is throw the Revelation and let God direct it to the heart of the enemy come on church I don't believe in a weak backbone church I don't believe a weakness of the church and just intellectual and Theology and a drive now I don't believe it anybody believe what they want to but I believe God has raised up a Powerhouse I believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost was sent to put Power in the church I don't want to fight that fight so let it go the gospel came not through Us in word only but through manifestation and demonstration of the spirit brother man said God help us to believe the same thing here God help us to believe the same thing amen that's exactly what it was the Commandment of God was to go into the world and preach the gospel not to teach not to set up schools I'm not I'm not pushing what I want you see something the strength out of Zion is not schooling right amen I don't care if you can read your name in Box Car letters I don't care if you ever had an education in your life I don't care if you have a million dollar or you don't have a penny I don't care if you have schooling or none come on Church we're not talking about that we're talking about what Jesus done when he sent the Holy Ghost back in the church to give us strength amen amen the word the word must be fulfilled if you're going to preach the gospel the word proceedeth out of the mouth brother man said it had to be a thought before it was a word well you don't know what the word means till you see the manifestation of it and then you have the thought fulfilled word because you have manifested word see what it is it's the strength the strongness in Galatians chapter 3 Paul says he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith amen even as Abraham believed God it was counted unto him for righteousness know ye therefore that we which are our faith are the same of the children of Abraham this began at Jerusalem the very City that that was prophesied it began to be preached remittance of sin and began to preach out of there and there was a law came out of Zion now this law was a different law because it had a different priest it wasn't the same thing that Moses had been given it was a different kind of law amen I I I'll tell you it's powerful Isaiah 2:3 said for out of Zion shall come forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem where did the gospel start right there in Jerusalem and what kind of law went forth it is a law of Faith amen there is a law of faith that resides in the church watch brother randam tell us this he said the power that'll raise us up is in us right now we are now in the power of the Resurrection now if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God could create a world and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it right now if you got to Shadow the power of God you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that is in you make you speak a world yeah it's already in you that's what power is in the church but it's controlled by law and that law is the law of faith which could be said is the law of Life Paul said look there's there's something works in my members it's the law of death right but I found another law thank God there's another law for one law was under condemnation but the other is UN the law of life in Deuteronomy brother man said it actually means two laws but one was a law of Mount SII and the other was a law of Mount Calvary one was a law that brought death and the other is a blw that brought life one is a law with conditions and the other is life without conditions it is the life of Jesus Christ it is a law that has gone out of the Holy Hill of God Amen to Amen to think about I almost can't keep my English language right now far there's something coming out of this church there something coming out of God's people it's a law that is exhibiting itself in the working of his mighty power power that is coming out of the Church of the Living God it is the law of the spirit God sets his laws into work sir now now you got to believe in the laws of God even atheist believes in them whether they want to attribute it to God or not they plant fields and they harvest their wheat and they operate in them laws whether they give that credit to God or not they got the law anyhow the denominational world has built their charismatic uh uh uh propagandas of prosperity and they use the law of God to get there they took the 10th the tithing the 10th uh uh and I don't want to say this wrong but honestly the the message we're a little bit scared of money so we don't talk about money because we're scared there you know it's something we don't talk about but sometimes honestly it's robbing the People by not talking about it because if you're not taught the law of giving you'll never know the law of prospering it's more blessed to give than to receive sir amen I I I know I don't want to go down this but it was mdct who took tith from Abraham and there was no law he didn't give it by the law he gave it by blessing and he knew who he was giving it to was God In the Flesh listen church I'll just break it down for you meel cadick didn't have a truck he didn't have a clothes he didn't have a car he didn't have family he didn't have a house amen it wasn't MDC needing money it was Abraham needing a blessing and God gave him a way to receive a blessing and he is a blessed man and the Seed of Abraham is a blessed seed come on church amen I don't want to get deep in it but I want to tell you that's a law yes sir and even the charismatics found that law amen good and if you want to see a blessing in your life find that law and start operating on that law absolutely you'll see them difference in your life L well I think this going to happen this listen I tell you what you do you go find prosperous men and ask them how they got there and I'll tell you every one of them going tell you the same thing I was nearly broke or I was nearly done and God just poured the blessings out on me come on Heen bankrupt when you come here years ago when he first come to Lima now he I ain't going to tell you how much money he's got cuz he don't want you to know but I say this he ain't bankrupt no more because he found how the law works there is a law of God church and if you plant your reap amen amen if you plant your reap and we've took that to the negative too many times we thought well we do this and we're going to reap bad and we do this and we're going to reap bad but if that's true about the bad then why isn't it true about the good if you plant the good you ought to look for the good to come back to you I'll use scripture for you cast your bread on the water and it'll come back to you yes sir now I'll tell you what brother Braham said about that he said and if you like butter on your bread he said butter it before you put it on the [Music] water Hallelujah butter the bread and what butter bread come back to you I'm talking about laws that won't fail it's the law of God it's the word of God and it's issuing right out of Zion Oh my right out of the Church of the Living God there's laws of death and life and thank God there's another law I've took too long to get to my point Amen in Psalms 110 watch this in the third P first and thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power now watch MDC prophesied to be sitting at the right hand I will not repent there forever now watch but now he's saying thy people the people of this great Prince the people of this great Messiah yeah will be willing in the day of his power now I think that's a that's a sermon within itself but I'll just say this to you God has a people now now brother Christopher when you read Elijah he got under a complex and you know what his complex was there there's nobody left but me right and today people under Elijah's Ministry sometimes gets the same complex nobody but us but let me tell you go ahead brother when he showed the Vindicated word up there on the mountain there was a scream when they saw the fire fell y'all remember it they saw the fire fell and there was a scream come out of the people and they said our God is God brother Bram said there was that 7,000 that had never bowed their knee but isn't it amazing Elijah brother Ram said God broke open and showed him there was 7,000 names recorded that had never bowed their knees and it was in Elijah's Ministry in the last days when the Bible said there would be everybody worshiping the Beast except for those who had their names in the Lamb's Book of Life and it was under an Elijah's Ministry the book was broke open and showed there's more than just you brother random there's more than just just one man going to make this Rapture but there's 7,000 that's never bowed their knee there are True Believers folks they're in Africa and India they're all over Ohio they're all over the Midwest and down in Arizona and across through Mexico there's a bride across this planet amen and God has a people this morning God has a people hallelujah I want to sing I'm one of them not I'm all of them right one of them some say I'm all of them if you don't come to my church you can't go I don't have that song Here we don't even know the words to that song we know the song Come here unto the Lord without money without price whoever can come let him come and drink of the Waters of Life freely there's something to have in the house of God there a reality of this message God has a people there's a people here this morning hall now this people that I'm talking about is talked about in The Book of Psalms we're talking about thousands of years ago your name was put there and said you would be willing in the day of his power yes sir people now isn't it amazing that Jesus specifically brings this up in John 17 and he said I have manifested my name unto them which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word now brother Bram said them was love gifts from the father to Jesus and the Bible said no man can come unto me except my father draw him and I will in no wise cast him out if you can come he won't cast you out because only God's people people will be willing in the day of his power amen now it's it's amazing to me brother B said all that will come see the predestinated who did this God before the foundation of the world and if we come in an illegitimate birth through e corruption making us all her children and subject to death then the Sovereign God has to make a way to redeem this children and all the father hath given me will come to me and no man come to me unless my father draws him now watch this all the father hath given me in Titus he says watch in Titus chap 2:3 looking for that blessed hope in the appearing of our great savior God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people well we got that nail don't we oh yeah peculiar don't just mean odds y'all know that right right peculiar means in this example it means only found in a certain place all right panda bear is peculiar to China kangaroo is peculiar to Australia yeah you can transplant them but they're still peculiar yeah amen and you see that God's people are peculiar in that they belong to him and he gave himself see a r some for them amen and this is this is the point thy people now here Paul is going in the book of Acts and he's going down in Corinth and watch what he does in Acts chapter 18 and Paul's going in the Lord speaks to him and he says this he says for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city and you continue there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them I I have much people in this city and they are not yet converted these people have not been baptized they have not yet received the gospel but God says to Paul you stay in this city because I have many people here can you imagine amen here brother brandom is taking off to Chicago there's thousands gathering together and he reveals I'm going up there for one person because God had somebody up there that was his person before he ever sent the prophet there the Good Samaritan our lord Jesus went around the long way to go down to the well of Samaria because there was a need down there he had a person down there he has people down there and listen the Bible said that the Lord himself should descended from heaven in the last days because there is a people a people yes Lord Jesus of people that would be willing and I don't have time to finish it that would be willing in the day yeah amen of his power let me say something to you right now this this message is the greatest example of the power of God that has ever hit the face of the Earthen brother bam told us simply he has done more in my Ministry yes sir than he did in his own Ministry three and a half years when he was on the earth many times one meeting with brother brandom held more miracles than the whole book of Acts put together yes sir it was an omnipotent example of the power of God that was sent into this day and you know what brother brandom had to say about it I'm the greatest that ever lived come look at me follow me do for me come on brother he said well see I was only a voice I was just standing there yeah it wasn't what I the seventh angel did it's what I was willing to surrender my life too here is God exhibiting power because he's in power and here's a prophet on the earth saying Lord I'm willing to do it Hallelujah listen to me the power of God is here the power of faith is in this building he's looking for a willing heart he's looking for somebody and will say father not my will but thy will be done God if you want to use my hands to heal I'm here Lord if you want to use my mouth to speak I'm here Lord if you want to use my feet to walk I'm here Lord It's the power of God that has come into the church Hallelujah now look what brother Ram said he said see there in in and and look at beyond the Unseen brother BR comes in there and he says watch he said this is not William brandom speaking Yeah it's the Lord he surrendered his body to me yeah I'm the Lord William brandom was willing yeah he was willing to let his personal feelings go he was willing to let his insecurities go he was willing to let his complications go he was letting letting it go so God could use him I think about this often when he says is it pulsating to you I he surrendered his life to me and he says it is here amen amen that he is doing this now brother bam tells us something here he tells us clearly that this is the Lord Jesus working in his spiritual body because the person of the Lord Jesus is setting at the right hand and he will come again in power and great Glory and I'm not going to teach on that he's going to come in power and great Glory now God promises this that he has the same attitude he has the same power everything but the physical body right that is setting at the right hand but his spirit is in here to make manifest to take our lives to make it exactly what he was that's what he promised he is the same in every principle except for the Corporal body now thy P thy people yeah are willing in the day of power now he's there he's in heaven let me me let me just say what brother Bram says here he said the same one that Joshua met at those walls the Unseen one the invisible one the omnipotent one he says he's here just as real as when he was standing there against the walls of Jericho a figurative type of course melc met Abraham do you see mcedc comes back and Abraham says I've talked face to face with God he talked to mecdc he was the Unseen host and he's here just as real as he was there he's everywhere that his people are gathered together because it is his spiritual body praise the Lord now look if my spirit was my shadow if my spirit was my shadow y'all let's just say if you stand the light and you cast a shadow many Shadows up here but if you cast a light and and you cast a shadow brother B said the shadow that's cast is a type of the spirit of Jesus Christ amen so you have his person then you have his shadow which is his Spirit yeah he says the spirit now the body supernaturally now the body of the Lord Jesus is the shadow as it was of the natural physical body of the Lord if healings if power if Visions if these things Christ had in him has gone out of his shadow then Christ is paralyzed his natural body sits paralyzed because that if his physical body moves his shadow will move with it and if we are in Christ by the Holy Ghost baptism all the way the body of Christ moves it will move the same way on the earth for this is a shadow of his body now taking it out of these things of the world predestinated by God called of God elected chosen of God saved by God baptized in the body by the Holy Spirit and made members of his body we are alive we are ready yeah and we are willing yes amen we are alive we are ready we are willing stand to your feet with me today raise the Lord because he's there his spirit is here it's here in power isn't it amazing that he said there will come a day that in the evening time there shall be light yes sir and what brother Bram teaches is he says that power is here he said but the clouds of man's theology has blocked the church he said but if we could fan back them clouds of unbelief this morning Lord Jesus we would see him in the same resurrection power is that something now what was it that raised Jesus what was it that raised him out of that grave it was resurrection power and what was it that gave them disciples the Holy Ghost in Pentecost resurrection power and what was it that they preached in Corinth and Ephesians what was it they preached that raised the dead and healed the sick and converted the souls resurrection power but long after them disciples there become a long day a gloomy day a dismal day brother ram calls it and men's theologies begin to remove the resurrection power from the church right yeah but it's prophesied that in the end time yes what they used in the book of Acts would be resurrected again so it wouldn't just be the resurrection power it's a resurrected power amen now if you'd like to study the message go type that in resurrection power and then type in resurrected power and he's telling you the power that is in the church today is the same power that was in the Believers back there in the early church it's just God has resurrected that power and in the days of that power there will be a people who are willing yes amen amen they're willing they're willing to open their heart do you see it behold I stand to the door knock do you see Ephesians is talking about revelation yes sir behold I stand at the door and knock If any man would open What's the mystery brother Wayne the latch is on the inside and thy people will be willing they'll open amen amen it brings so much to real it brings so much real to me personally I'm reading the scriptures in Philippians says let this mind be in you y let it you mean you could be willing and you could open a door that the same power that was in them Apostles the same thing God was he still is yes sir amen and he's chose this day and he's chose this people and all I can say is I'm alive I'm ready and I'm [Music] willing I'm willing Amen brother Ben [Music] yesus behold Jehovah Seated on the throne AB father the well that overflow The God Who was and is and
