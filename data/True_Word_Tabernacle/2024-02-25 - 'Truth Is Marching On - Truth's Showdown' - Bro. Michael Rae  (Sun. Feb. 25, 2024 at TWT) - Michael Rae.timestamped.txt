[53:03] amen
[53:07] amen amen
[53:10] it's I I really enjoyed uh the taale of
[53:13] two Banquets I I just thought that was
[53:16] amazing amen it was a it was a
[53:18] tremendous uh thought and we certainly
[53:20] uh appreciate the gift that the Lord has
[53:22] placed in our brother Michael's life and
[53:25] uh of course you all know his
[53:26] grandfather brother Ed bcll and he has
[53:30] he's put blazes all over the world for
[53:32] the message of the hour amen and brother
[53:35] brother bisc and brother Tom Ray there
[53:37] at Cloverdale Bible Way well this is
[53:38] Brother Tom Ray's son and the Lord has
[53:41] just laid in him his own gift and
[53:44] blessed the congregation there and we
[53:46] met him a couple years ago when we were
[53:48] there doing the Cloverdale Bible Way
[53:49] camp and um and I I tell you what what
[53:53] struck my heart so strongly is we were
[53:55] in the prayer line afterward and him and
[53:59] I were praying for some youth together
[54:01] and I seen the
[54:03] heart that was that was poured out for
[54:06] the young people it wasn't just about
[54:08] Ministry or how well could someone could
[54:10] preach but I've seen a real burden to
[54:13] help young people find a place of
[54:15] Deliverance in their life and I and I
[54:18] spoke to brother Nathan I said' I
[54:19] believe that this would be a tremendous
[54:21] blessing uh for the people here and for
[54:24] the young people and we're uh certainly
[54:26] certainly honored to have him amen for
[54:29] us this morning I know um that brother
[54:31] Nathan brother Ronnie worked hard on
[54:33] that banquet but I know Sister Tara and
[54:35] I seen uh I've
[54:37] seen I I've seen a bunch of uh different
[54:41] uh ones there and uh the food and things
[54:43] that were prepared uh we'll maybe get to
[54:46] thanks later but we certainly appreciate
[54:48] all the labor that was done for that
[54:50] Amen in in the youth banquet uh it's
[54:53] certainly a blessing you know some
[54:55] something I found out uh in listening to
[54:57] the prophet if you ever want to hear it
[54:58] it's in the message is there anything
[55:00] too hard for the Lord is anytime God
[55:03] gets ready to be a
[55:06] blessing Satan always
[55:08] tries to block the blessing right
[55:12] whatever whatever God's about to do for
[55:14] you amen Satan will always try somehow
[55:18] to block the blessing and to get your
[55:21] get your spiritual attitude away from
[55:24] this from the word of God or from what
[55:26] God's about to do and he picks Abraham
[55:30] when the Elohim was coming to the tent
[55:32] door and brother Bram said it was a hot
[55:34] evening he said all the cattle that is
[55:37] out there he said the ponds were about
[55:39] dry there was no grass he said everybody
[55:41] was fussing he said Sarah didn't have
[55:44] the latest fashion and she was upset he
[55:46] had her up there on that mountain and
[55:48] and he said there was a lot of things
[55:50] going on there that would have had him
[55:52] out of place and out of condition he
[55:55] said but when Elohim walked to the tent
[55:57] door he greeted him and he spoke to him
[56:00] as Lord and brother B said the reason he
[56:01] could do it is because he was in a
[56:03] spiritual atmosphere that's right to
[56:05] recognize a moment of a visitation from
[56:08] God right and he said see Sarah was in a
[56:11] place like a lot of times when people
[56:13] come to church he said she was out of
[56:15] sorts that's right and see he said and
[56:18] when you're out of sords he said God can
[56:21] move there and you'll completely miss it
[56:24] so you want to be a spiritual attitude
[56:26] when the Holy Spirit begins to move this
[56:28] morning you want something in your heart
[56:30] to recognize that's the Holy Spirit and
[56:34] he's speaking to my situation and
[56:36] whatever Satan has tried to throw at you
[56:38] through the weekend through getting here
[56:41] whatever's happening this morning in
[56:43] your life you have to say to the devil
[56:45] Satan God promised me a visitation this
[56:48] morning and I'm here to receive it and
[56:50] I'm recognizing when the man of God
[56:52] begins to speak there's going to come a
[56:54] word my way and I'm going to go home
[56:56] today have visited with Elohim I'm going
[56:58] to have fellowship with him today he's
[57:01] going to move through this
[57:07] congregation amen and I believe it I
[57:10] believe this morning that the Lord is
[57:12] going to do a tremendous thing among us
[57:13] he made a promise that he would be here
[57:16] and whenever he comes wonderful things
[57:17] are going to happen God's going to bless
[57:19] you today he's going to move but when he
[57:22] comes by your way brother Judah now
[57:23] don't you let it pass you when he comes
[57:25] and speaks to you you say yes Lord
[57:27] that's for me and you just reach out and
[57:29] pull on that word and watch the Holy
[57:31] Spirit just start ministering to needs
[57:33] amen we love him this morning amen and

[1:00:45] Healer man we don't need to go another

[1:00:51] home sick we're believing for them
[1:00:52] brother Wayne Amen but in

[1:00:59] yesterday and just what a wow what a
[1:01:02] banquet that was I went home taking some
[1:01:04] notes my but Nathan said this is just
[1:01:07] simple I said wow that's not simple
[1:01:08] that's just elegant it's so
[1:01:11] beautiful but Wayne was saying there's
[1:01:13] every every congregation is those that
[1:01:15] have just a burden and a love for our
[1:01:16] young people they're the life they're
[1:01:18] the lifeblood of a congregation amen
[1:01:21] that the next gen they're not just the
[1:01:22] Next Generation you are the generation
[1:01:25] amen and so we just that's what our
[1:01:26] burdened desires you catch what God is
[1:01:29] doing and he becomes personal to you and
[1:01:31] God's truth marches on Amen I I noted a
[1:01:36] couple songs that were sung one he's
[1:01:37] never lost a battle heard that song this
[1:01:40] morning and then he's the God who fights
[1:01:42] for me heard that song this morning and
[1:01:45] then I I I gave the brothers a title but
[1:01:47] I kind of had a secondary title and I
[1:01:49] was going to call it truth's
[1:01:52] Showdown and when there's a showdown
[1:01:53] that means there's there's a bit of a
[1:01:54] battle involved you and so maybe God has
[1:01:58] a bit of a theme this morning man we got
[1:02:00] a bit of a
[1:02:01] showdown between our Lord and our and
[1:02:04] his enemy so maybe we'll just speak
[1:02:06] about that this morning so you can take
[1:02:08] your Bibles we'll turn to the word thank
[1:02:10] you so much buddy God bless
[1:02:14] you turn to John this
[1:02:19] morning John
[1:02:21] 17 sure is just I
[1:02:25] for me it's a
[1:02:27] real I can say fearful and a very
[1:02:29] reverent way to stand behind a Pulpit
[1:02:32] another Pastor in a congregation
[1:02:35] I it's a very privileged thing for me to
[1:02:38] do thank you I might need that you never
[1:02:42] know oh you want me to switch now all
[1:02:44] right I'm switching
[1:02:46] now that was
[1:02:51] early
[1:02:53] amen John
[1:02:56] 17 says I pray not that thou should us
[1:02:59] take them out of the world Jesus
[1:03:01] speaking but that thou should us keep
[1:03:03] them from Evil they are not of the world
[1:03:06] even as I am not of the world sanctify
[1:03:09] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[1:03:14] as thou Hast sent me into the world even
[1:03:16] so I have I even so have I also sent
[1:03:19] them into the world Amen Jesus is
[1:03:22] speaking and praying here and I want to
[1:03:24] focus on that verse sanctify them
[1:03:26] through thy truth Thy word is truth
[1:03:30] that's right and why don't we just
[1:03:32] pray this morning Heavenly
[1:03:36] Father Lord we come before your word
[1:03:39] Lord Desiring that you would speak so
[1:03:42] individually this morning each one here
[1:03:44] Lord they've come Lord with a need Lord
[1:03:47] everybody here has something on their
[1:03:51] heart or we have burdens that we bear we
[1:03:54] have situations that we are dealing with
[1:03:56] Lord maybe loved ones that are astray
[1:03:59] Lord everybody here has a need and I'm
[1:04:01] so thankful Lord that your word Lord
[1:04:04] It's Eternal it's all powerful it's
[1:04:07] truth and it can meet every need in the
[1:04:10] presence of this room here this morning
[1:04:12] Lord and each one even that's listening
[1:04:14] in maybe from afar Lord your word can
[1:04:17] speak directly to the heart it's a
[1:04:18] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:04:21] the heart so Lord we commit this morning
[1:04:23] Lord May Lord you take the people and
[1:04:25] myself into your hand and Lord that your
[1:04:28] purpose would be Lord manifested and
[1:04:30] fulfilled this morning we pray take us
[1:04:33] Lord we desire you to be here open the
[1:04:35] word Lord without you this whole meeting
[1:04:37] is in vain yes Lord Lord so we want you
[1:04:39] to meet your people this morning in
[1:04:41] Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may
[1:04:44] have your seats this
[1:04:48] morning read a couple other scriptures
[1:04:50] just you don't have to turn to them but
[1:04:51] I'll just reference them here as we
[1:04:53] start
[1:04:54] Psalms 105 says for the Lord is good his
[1:04:57] Mercy is Everlasting and his truth
[1:05:00] endureth to all generations amen his
[1:05:02] truth endureth Psalms 117:2 for for his
[1:05:06] merciful kindness is great toward us and
[1:05:09] the truth of the Lord endureth forever
[1:05:12] amen Psalms 145:18 the Lord is nigh unto
[1:05:15] them that call upon him to all that call
[1:05:18] upon him in truth amen Psalms 119:30 I
[1:05:22] have chosen the way of truth amen that
[1:05:25] thy judgments have I laid before me amen
[1:05:28] truth is is uh is vital it's a vital
[1:05:31] aspect to to know the truth and Jesus
[1:05:33] said Thy word is truth and we just going
[1:05:35] to leave a little have a little bit of a
[1:05:37] a service this morning focused around
[1:05:39] that and we'll just speak about the the
[1:05:40] show down here but uh anybody weary this
[1:05:43] morning no no nobody's weary wow okay I
[1:05:47] like it we're
[1:05:50] ready you know I was looking up you know
[1:05:52] what um when you're in a battle and
[1:05:55] we're in a battle anybody here not in a
[1:05:58] battle amen I know I reversed that one
[1:06:01] quickly on you everybody's in a battle
[1:06:04] we're all in a battle you know if you're
[1:06:05] on the front lines of of a real you know
[1:06:07] physical battle I could say they say a
[1:06:09] soldier exerts upwards to 5,000 calories
[1:06:13] a
[1:06:14] day okay average for a man or so would
[1:06:17] be about 2,000 is calories you know plus
[1:06:19] minus there depending on your gender Etc
[1:06:21] so 5,000 is an incredible amount of
[1:06:23] calories that you're exerting to be on
[1:06:25] the front lines amen so then you wonder
[1:06:27] maybe why I'm just spiritually taxed or
[1:06:29] I'm a little weary today CU you've been
[1:06:31] in a spiritual battle and you're you're
[1:06:33] fighting amen if you ain't fighting well
[1:06:35] we should be fighting we should be
[1:06:37] should be exerting for the kingdom and
[1:06:38] so then you wonder well why am I a
[1:06:40] little bit worn down while you're
[1:06:41] exerting and so then I would also ask
[1:06:43] then what are you consuming because we
[1:06:45] got to fill back the energy as we fight
[1:06:48] we need to we need to pull back on the
[1:06:50] word amen to pull that energy back in so
[1:06:53] we need some spiritual calories to be
[1:06:54] able to fight the enemy cuz the battle I
[1:06:56] could say is
[1:06:58] on the battle is on you know there's
[1:07:01] some there's been some pretty intense
[1:07:03] battles over the centuries you know the
[1:07:05] the the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258
[1:07:08] going back several hundred years they
[1:07:09] said there was upwards to two million
[1:07:12] casualties in the Battle there in
[1:07:14] another battle in in brolof in 1916 1.6
[1:07:18] million casualties it was one of the
[1:07:20] costliest battles known to in in terms
[1:07:23] of human life in modern history uh
[1:07:25] there's another battle in the battle I'm
[1:07:27] don't even going to pronounce this quite
[1:07:29] correctly nier ner it's World War II
[1:07:32] battle and it involved almost 4 million
[1:07:34] troops for both sides stretching across
[1:07:37] 1,400 kilomet in Miles let's just say
[1:07:39] that about 900 miles on the Eastern
[1:07:41] front and the casualties were fatal
[1:07:43] upwards they say to 1.5 million
[1:07:45] casualties in the Battle these are these
[1:07:48] are some some some Wars that have been
[1:07:50] waged and the cost even just hard to
[1:07:52] even comprehend the cost of these
[1:07:54] battles but I would tell you this
[1:07:56] morning that there's nothing there's no
[1:07:58] battle in all of mankind and all through
[1:08:00] the history of humanity that even
[1:08:02] compares to the battle for truth that
[1:08:06] battle has waged onwards and onwards
[1:08:08] through time and there's no way in any
[1:08:11] battle throughout history that can
[1:08:12] compare to this one amen it's a war that
[1:08:15] is waging quite heavily and so it's
[1:08:17] normal it's normal to be fatigued it's
[1:08:20] normal to be when you're fighting and so
[1:08:22] this War's rage better brandham has said
[1:08:24] now army war he said it's always been
[1:08:26] War we've never joined the church or

[1:08:44] basket and sandwich out there on the
[1:08:45] front lines in World War II it didn't
[1:08:47] happen you brought your gun out Amen
[1:08:48] brother Brown said it's War not a picnic
[1:08:50] he said we must realize we're coming to
[1:08:52] a Battleground I never come for people
[1:08:54] to Pat me on the back and brother
[1:08:56] brandom you're just so wonderful no sir
[1:08:58] I come here with a shield on I don't
[1:09:00] need a shield for for that he says I
[1:09:02] come with a helmet and an armor I come
[1:09:04] to fight fight for every inch of
[1:09:07] ground amen he says I don't care how
[1:09:09] much fight for the material things
[1:09:11] you're going he goes it won't mean one
[1:09:13] thing cuz it'll Shake but he said but
[1:09:15] there's one fight that you can get into
[1:09:17] you and gain grounds and that can never
[1:09:19] be taken
[1:09:21] away amen you gain some ground on the
[1:09:23] enemy this morning it can never be taken
[1:09:25] away you take possession of your land
[1:09:27] amen we got a a group of calebs I would
[1:09:29] say this morning amen he said that it'll
[1:09:31] never be taken away he says that's the
[1:09:33] sound of the trumpet of God's word and
[1:09:36] put in Brackets truth and as he goes as
[1:09:39] we move on through the evening so if we
[1:09:42] would go in the message we we're all
[1:09:43] message Believers here message brother
[1:09:46] brandham talks about a a trumpet sound
[1:09:48] he said a trumpet Means War that's right
[1:09:51] said a trumpet Means War he says you
[1:09:53] know Through the Ages he said about the
[1:09:55] church coming in there was trumpet
[1:09:57] sounded and a seal tore loose he said a
[1:09:59] trumpet Means War if it don't give a
[1:10:02] scriptural sound he says what about it
[1:10:04] he says now each Church age has had its
[1:10:06] messenger we know that he said Paul was
[1:10:08] a messenger and when the first trumpet
[1:10:10] sounded he said the first seal tore
[1:10:13] loose Paul was the first Messenger as we
[1:10:15] found what did he do he said he declared
[1:10:19] war I love that Paul you just say well
[1:10:23] you read go through acts you go through
[1:10:24] the different uh different accounts in
[1:10:26] scripture and the letters to the
[1:10:28] different churches but if you put it in
[1:10:29] a different perspective this morning
[1:10:31] Paul wasn't just riding on pen or going
[1:10:33] there and and standing on uh on Mars
[1:10:35] Hill and such he was actually declaring
[1:10:39] war think about it in that Dimension
[1:10:41] there was Satan and all of his all of
[1:10:43] his cohorts of demons and there was Paul
[1:10:45] preaching the gospel Jesus Christ has
[1:10:47] come the Messiah is here manifested in
[1:10:49] flesh he was declaring
[1:10:52] war
[1:10:54] that's right declaration of war actually
[1:10:56] is a formal act by which a state goes to
[1:10:58] war against another it's a declaration
[1:11:01] it's a performative speech act you know
[1:11:03] someone to say well I'm going to go to
[1:11:05] war we're going to war no it's something
[1:11:07] there there's actually it's a very
[1:11:08] formal thing when someone goes to war so
[1:11:11] God had to anoint a messenger
[1:11:13] specifically that you're under the
[1:11:15] authority of Heaven to go out and
[1:11:17] declare to the enemy the battle's
[1:11:20] on that's what Paul was doing Paul was
[1:11:23] going with Corinth and he went with
[1:11:24] Silas and timotheus that went to
[1:11:26] Macedonia and Paul was pressed in the
[1:11:28] spirit and testified to the Jews that
[1:11:30] Jesus was the Christ amen declaring war
[1:11:34] there he was with o k King agria he says
[1:11:37] King Agrippa I was not disobedient to
[1:11:39] the heavenly vision but showed the first
[1:11:41] but showed first unto them in Damascus
[1:11:43] and Jerusalem the thought and throughout
[1:11:45] all the coast and then to the Gentiles
[1:11:47] that they should repent and turn to God
[1:11:49] and do the works meet for
[1:11:51] repentance War that's what he was doing
[1:11:55] amen he was declaring that that Jesus
[1:11:56] was the Messiah remember hey this was
[1:12:00] pretty new this was pretty new you know
[1:12:03] this was not exactly well we know that
[1:12:05] no no no this was something absolutely
[1:12:07] completely contrary to what they had
[1:12:09] thought they believe this was really a
[1:12:11] Jew the Messiah it was unfathomable but
[1:12:14] here God was completely changing and Sh
[1:12:16] and and turning now them towards the the
[1:12:18] gospel message and brother Brown said he
[1:12:20] blasted those synagogues from place to
[1:12:22] place with scripture and was put out of
[1:12:24] all of them till finally he shook the
[1:12:25] dust off his feet and he turned to the
[1:12:28] Gentiles amen right amen he said what
[1:12:31] was it it was the sounding of a trumpet
[1:12:34] he said an angel messenger standing
[1:12:36] there with the
[1:12:38] word amen with the word and the
[1:12:40] scripture says Thy word is truth amen so
[1:12:44] he's standing there preaching the gospel
[1:12:46] and blasting out the
[1:12:49] truth
[1:12:51] amen he says don't miss that that now
[1:12:53] the word in Paul with the unadulterated
[1:12:56] interpretation of God's word and blasted
[1:12:59] everyone of those synagogues and it cost
[1:13:02] him he said his life then he said he
[1:13:04] could go down to irius and if we go
[1:13:05] through time and Through the Ages each
[1:13:07] messenger that was going forth was
[1:13:09] blasting out the truth amen they were
[1:13:11] declaring war in each age a trumpet
[1:13:13] would sound and War would go out and
[1:13:15] there would irenius go through and
[1:13:16] brother Brown says then St Martin in the
[1:13:18] next Church age that doctrine of the
[1:13:19] nicadan would start to creep into the
[1:13:21] churches and he'd send another messenger
[1:13:23] say declare war let him know the
[1:13:25] battle's still on Truth still rages and
[1:13:28] so then St Martin would go out there and
[1:13:30] blast through his age and then there
[1:13:31] with Luther he said the fifth Messenger
[1:13:33] as he blasted the Catholic church with
[1:13:35] the word of God and he said the just
[1:13:37] shall live by faith he said this is not
[1:13:39] the literal Body of Christ and he threw
[1:13:40] the communion on the floor and walked
[1:13:42] out of there he said and blasted that
[1:13:44] Catholic Church he was trumpeting a
[1:13:45] sound saying this isn't the truth this
[1:13:47] is the truth pointing to the word amen
[1:13:50] he was blasting that out there a trumpet
[1:13:52] sounding John West raising up in the
[1:13:54] Anglican Church day he said there's no
[1:13:56] more reason we have for revivals they
[1:13:58] were saying and he said it went to see
[1:13:59] but John Wesley stood up with a message
[1:14:01] of the second work of Grace and blasted
[1:14:03] that Anglican church with the gospel of
[1:14:05] trumpet prepare for
[1:14:08] war
[1:14:11] amen then he said through the leodan age
[1:14:14] they again denominated Methodist Baptist
[1:14:16] Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostal he
[1:14:19] says we're looking for a prophet to come
[1:14:21] to blast this age and turn them back
[1:14:23] from their iniquity I to me when I read
[1:14:26] the message I it just I I kind of
[1:14:28] chuckle inside at just something kind of
[1:14:31] tightens up within me because here a
[1:14:32] prophet is speaking and pointing back to
[1:14:34] St Martin back to irenius back to Martin
[1:14:37] Luther back to Wesley and he says
[1:14:38] there's going to be some Prophet raised
[1:14:40] up in this day to blast the truth and
[1:14:42] I'm like there you are you are blasting
[1:14:44] the truth you are shouting it out you
[1:14:46] have declared war oh my could you just
[1:14:49] be in that service I would have wanted
[1:14:50] to stand up and say you're there war is
[1:14:53] on on truth is being
[1:14:56] preached oh my how many just sat in
[1:14:59] there and listened to the prophet say
[1:15:00] well we're looking for a prophet to come
[1:15:02] that won't
[1:15:04] compromise
[1:15:05] amen and they're looking at
[1:15:08] him oh my goodness he says now the Le of
[1:15:11] see and the Messenger will finish the L
[1:15:13] of the Le to and seventh angel will
[1:15:15] finish all the Mysteries that's been
[1:15:16] lost in the battles before for the truth
[1:15:20] oh my think about it and here all these
[1:15:22] truths he talks about Satan had stripped
[1:15:25] and taken and stripped all through prior
[1:15:26] battles he says that had been lost he
[1:15:29] said that's been lost in the battles
[1:15:31] before for the truth so in these past
[1:15:34] ages truth had been Stripped
[1:15:37] Away okay Satan had W there had been
[1:15:39] battles and Truth had been has been
[1:15:41] stripped back and here now God was
[1:15:43] sending a final Messenger to bring truth
[1:15:46] back to his
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:52] church
[1:15:53] Luther raised up he said but he didn't
[1:15:55] have the truth he only had justification
[1:15:58] right he said' Along Came another
[1:15:59] messenger would Wesley sanctification he
[1:16:03] said now watch there's a lot of truth
[1:16:05] lost out there he said why others
[1:16:09] compromised on Truth my but this seventh
[1:16:13] angel don't compromise on
[1:16:18] nothing oh I'm so thankful that we had a
[1:16:21] messenger that didn't compromise nothing
[1:16:23] on one ioda you don't think he had
[1:16:25] pressure to to to just deviate just a
[1:16:28] little bit here's just some money here's
[1:16:29] a lot of money if you could just do this
[1:16:31] maybe just don't mention this right here
[1:16:33] don't mention about serpent seed right
[1:16:34] here don't mention about water baptism
[1:16:36] right here don't mention baptism in the
[1:16:38] name of Jesus Christ just don't say that
[1:16:39] you can have this but there was a
[1:16:41] messenger that said I will never
[1:16:43] compromise on this gospel God has
[1:16:45] anointed me Satan it's time for war all
[1:16:49] the truth that's been lost in this day
[1:16:51] every mystery that's going to be
[1:16:52] revealed is here now and I am that one
[1:16:55] that's preaching for this gospel oh my
[1:16:58] I'm so thankful for a messenger that
[1:17:00] could stand that way but he brought a
[1:17:03] message to you and I that's the same
[1:17:05] life force that was driving through him
[1:17:07] is driving through you and I so that
[1:17:10] there's a people that will not
[1:17:12] compromise in this gospel
[1:17:15] age
[1:17:18] amen no
[1:17:21] sir he gathers up all the loose hands
[1:17:23] gathers them all up at the sounding of
[1:17:26] this of all the mystery of God should be
[1:17:28] finished God sent him and all the hidden
[1:17:31] mysteries was finished when it was
[1:17:33] revealed to him compromise is to accept
[1:17:37] standards that are lower than is
[1:17:40] desirable
[1:17:43] amen I'd say a people that's
[1:17:46] Anointed with this Eagle anointing yeah
[1:17:49] will never cave or Buckle to the the
[1:17:53] pressure we'll never compromise I know I
[1:17:56] know that this age is so pressured on
[1:17:58] you young people and you've got
[1:18:00] pressures on every angle and every side
[1:18:02] to to to try and just compromise a
[1:18:04] little bit on your you know young ladies
[1:18:06] on your virtues and and on how you
[1:18:07] conduct yourselves young men and just
[1:18:09] get to the fashion and maybe our
[1:18:11] haircuts a little this way and our dress
[1:18:12] a little bit that way and it's just that
[1:18:14] pressure that just keeps pressing
[1:18:16] against you a lot of times the pressure
[1:18:17] it's not just an instant Force boom it's
[1:18:20] just this squeeze that's just trying to
[1:18:23] conform you as you go and walk through
[1:18:25] your schools and there's a different
[1:18:27] influences this way and it just is
[1:18:28] putting that pressure to squeeze you to
[1:18:31] till you
[1:18:32] pop essentially but what this message
[1:18:35] does young people is it puts something
[1:18:37] inside you it's called the life of the
[1:18:39] Holy Spirit that's came in this age with
[1:18:42] the full manifestation of Truth so that
[1:18:45] it drops inside you a counter pressure
[1:18:48] because you can't go through this world
[1:18:50] without something inside you so that as
[1:18:51] the pressure starts to push on you
[1:18:54] inside you it starts to push back amen
[1:18:57] it starts to push back and you start to
[1:18:59] read the word you start to Tak in the
[1:19:01] scriptures you get in the message and
[1:19:03] that's depositing in you a strength and
[1:19:05] a pressure and as it squeezes you it
[1:19:07] just pushes out and it just maintains
[1:19:10] that equilibrium as you walk through the
[1:19:11] hallways with your head at back and your
[1:19:13] shoulders straight say I'm a daughter of
[1:19:15] God and that pressure has no power on
[1:19:19] you in this
[1:19:21] day oh
[1:19:30] amen L BR say these hidden if these are
[1:19:33] hidden mysteries the man will have to be
[1:19:34] a prophet right specifically he didn't
[1:19:38] and didn't we just get through that he's
[1:19:40] speaking this is all from is this the
[1:19:41] sign of the end sir and he said in the
[1:19:43] Battle For Truth them ends have been
[1:19:45] lost but God said they'd be restored
[1:19:48] again in this last day amen and here we
[1:19:51] are in an age where full the full
[1:19:53] unveiling of Truth All truth is made
[1:19:57] known in this day and I would say how
[1:20:01] incredible if we're in the if we're in
[1:20:03] on a spiritual aspect where all truth is

[1:22:11] world completely I would say shows lack
[1:22:14] of completely of all truth okay we'll
[1:22:17] just def find that there Paul pilate in
[1:22:20] John 18 very familiar area of script
[1:22:23] scripture I apologize I don't even know
[1:22:26] what time I started maybe like some time
[1:22:28] ago we'll just try and get all through
[1:22:30] here brother brother Wayne see your
[1:22:32] pastor said we have one service today I
[1:22:34] said yeah we're one service back home
[1:22:36] too and it's just church we just have
[1:22:37] church and we sing and we worship and we
[1:22:39] praise and we hear the word of God and
[1:22:41] that's what the day is
[1:22:43] for and then we go home to lunch's
[1:22:45] dinner
[1:22:48] maybe I'm just kidding I know everybody
[1:22:50] especially the moms with little babies
[1:22:51] like whoa where's this preacher
[1:22:55] going amen but I'll just blame you cuz
[1:22:58] if you pull I'm preaching it's your
[1:22:59] fault not
[1:23:01] mine your
[1:23:03] fault amen well we're in this together
[1:23:07] amen John 18:37 pilate therefore said
[1:23:09] unto him art thou the king then Jesus
[1:23:12] answered thou sayest that I am a king he
[1:23:14] said to this end I was born and for this
[1:23:17] cause came I into the world that I
[1:23:19] should bear witness unto the truth
[1:23:23] amen so here Jesus is saying I have been
[1:23:25] sent into the world to Bear witness of
[1:23:27] the truth everyone that is of Truth
[1:23:30] heareth my voice think about this now
[1:23:34] here pilate as we even said to young
[1:23:35] people last night Rich Young Ruler had
[1:23:37] an opportunity to stand before Christ
[1:23:39] here now pilate had his moment to stand
[1:23:41] before the Living God in flesh and now
[1:23:43] he's saying I've been I've been sent
[1:23:45] here to to to Bear witness to truth and
[1:23:48] everyone that's of Truth hears my voice
[1:23:52] and pil says what is
[1:23:56] truth to me to me that whole that whole
[1:23:59] event as pilot is I know wrestling in
[1:24:02] his mind I can't see no fault in this
[1:24:04] man what what am I supposed to do with
[1:24:06] this and here truth is standing in front
[1:24:08] of him as we will get to in in a little
[1:24:10] bit but here he's standing and he's
[1:24:12] saying I've been come to Bear witness of
[1:24:13] Truth and those that that are of Truth
[1:24:15] are going to hear my voice and clearly
[1:24:18] pilate was not of truth because his
[1:24:20] response to that was what is truth right
[1:24:24] amen and the very next part of
[1:24:27] scripture says he went out
[1:24:30] again and I thought here Jesus is
[1:24:33] standing all beaten and bruised and such
[1:24:35] there standing before Pilate and he
[1:24:37] responds to his question and pilot looks
[1:24:39] at him and says what is truth and walks
[1:24:45] outow you are staring at your heart
[1:24:49] obviously yearing for something you you
[1:24:51] you were you were Desiring something he
[1:24:52] was tormented but he did he was not of
[1:24:55] Truth to hear
[1:25:04] truth and I would say 2,000 years since
[1:25:07] that moment of time the world breathes
[1:25:10] pilot cynicism and also says the same
[1:25:13] thing what is truth
[1:25:15] amen how many people these days they
[1:25:17] don't have a clue what truth is and
[1:25:19] they're they're they're wanting it in
[1:25:21] some way but pilot well what is truth
[1:25:23] and just walk
[1:25:25] away there's an
[1:25:28] old song I won't even say who wrote it
[1:25:30] or who even sang it some here might even
[1:25:32] well maybe would recognize it if you're
[1:25:34] in your earlier days but there was a
[1:25:36] song that was said the young man
[1:25:38] speaking in the city squares trying to
[1:25:40] tell somebody that he cares yeah the
[1:25:42] ones that they're calling wild are going
[1:25:44] to be leaders in a little while this old
[1:25:46] world's walk into a newborn day and I
[1:25:48] Sly Say it'll be their way you better
[1:25:51] help The Voice of Youth find what is
[1:25:56] truth think about this is this is a
[1:25:58] worldly song back in several decades and
[1:26:02] they're screaming out there you better
[1:26:03] help the youth find what is
[1:26:06] truth because they're your leaders of
[1:26:08] the Next Generation they're the ones
[1:26:10] that are going to be calling the shots
[1:26:12] and if they don't know truth where's
[1:26:13] this world
[1:26:15] going I'd say the cry hasn't diminished
[1:26:17] the den and the sound of war against
[1:26:19] truth has increased and Satan is trying
[1:26:22] to obstruct and to hide and to attempt
[1:26:24] the defeat of Truth and his Triumph amen
[1:26:28] that's where we're at right now and so
[1:26:29] truth as I would say in my title truth
[1:26:32] is going to march on truth is going to
[1:26:35] march
[1:26:36] on so here a
[1:26:42] truth in John 14 and if I go and prepare
[1:26:46] a place for you I'll come again and
[1:26:47] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:26:50] there ye may be also Thomas said unto
[1:26:52] him
[1:26:54] Lord we know not whether thou goest how
[1:26:57] can we know the
[1:26:59] way and Jesus said unto him I am the
[1:27:05] way the
[1:27:07] truth and the
[1:27:09] life I would present this morning if
[1:27:12] you're unsure or if you are wondering
[1:27:14] and I would I would say everybody here
[1:27:16] isn't isn't but if you're ever if you're
[1:27:18] wondering where is truth I'm going to
[1:27:20] tell you this morning in very clear
[1:27:21] aspect in very clear English Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ is the way the truth and the life
[1:27:29] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:27:31] amen Jesus is trth and the Word was made
[1:27:35] flesh and dwelt Among Us so if I could
[1:27:37] say as we go through scripture sanctify
[1:27:39] them through Thy word Thy word is truth
[1:27:41] that means the word of God is truth and
[1:27:43] if Jesus Christ is the embodied word
[1:27:46] made flesh that means this word and all
[1:27:48] that it says is truth amen this is this
[1:27:52] is the absolute being born again not a
[1:27:55] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by
[1:27:57] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:28:00] forever and cannot be broken amen Jesus
[1:28:02] answered and said is not it written in
[1:28:04] your law that ye are Gods if ye called
[1:28:07] them Gods unto whom the word of God came
[1:28:09] and the scripture cannot be broken it's
[1:28:12] pure and unchangeable so the word of God
[1:28:15] which was Jesus Christ who was in flesh
[1:28:17] the word made flesh in that day is now
[1:28:19] embodied in this Bible right here and he
[1:28:21] said I am the tray the truth and the
[1:28:23] life that means this gospel right here
[1:28:26] of Incorruptible seed is the truth
[1:28:28] that's going to hold you keep you
[1:28:31] preserve you fortify you when you have a
[1:28:33] question or don't know what to say go
[1:28:35] back to the truth this is your
[1:28:40] absolute I don't need no some
[1:28:42] philosophical definition of truth I
[1:28:44] didn't need to go to some Theologian to
[1:28:46] tell me what truth is or what's right or
[1:28:47] what's wrong I just need to go to the
[1:28:49] very word of God where Jesus Christ
[1:28:51] himself said I am the way I am the truth
[1:28:54] and I have been made I'm the word made
[1:28:55] flesh so this word and me are one so if
[1:28:58] you're looking for an answer it's right
[1:29:02] there someone says truth is wow that's
[1:29:05] the real facts about something or it's
[1:29:06] in accordance with reality or reality is
[1:29:08] the true situation that exists I don't
[1:29:10] really care what they think it is my
[1:29:12] word tells me that this is true and
[1:29:14] that's where my anchor
[1:29:18] holds I tell you everything in this
[1:29:20] world is meant to deceive and set you on
[1:29:24] a destabilized path put you in a state I
[1:29:27] would say of mistrust well is that quite
[1:29:30] the right way or is it really the way
[1:29:32] maybe it's not quite the way that you
[1:29:34] know to to be seen and and it's trying
[1:29:36] to steer you and lead you or places will
[1:29:38] get to in a in a mislead you out of
[1:29:41] truth's way that's Satan's way but if I
[1:29:43] go first and we'll just go this way
[1:29:45] before we go back that way the scripture
[1:29:47] says in Ephesians 6 that
[1:29:50] armor where
[1:29:52] take unto you the whole armor of God
[1:29:55] that's right amen Paul I don't believe
[1:29:58] Paul is uh was just kind of willy-nilly
[1:30:00] in writing well I'll maybe just put this
[1:30:03] word here or maybe I'll just write it
[1:30:05] this way no he was inspired and anointed
[1:30:09] by the Holy Spirit to write specific
[1:30:12] words amen specific word that's why I
[1:30:14] don't go all these the the the message
[1:30:16] translation and this translation all
[1:30:18] these different things I'm going to go
[1:30:20] with a Bible that Prophet preached out
[1:30:22] him and CU I want the full impact of the
[1:30:25] word not some watered down religion of
[1:30:27] some well this in some new age
[1:30:29] vernacular forget it I don't want new
[1:30:31] age vernacular I want a prophet's
[1:30:33] vernacular and if he went to this
[1:30:35] version I'm going to send with
[1:30:40] it so my King James Bible says wherefore
[1:30:43] take you unto you the whole armor of God
[1:30:46] don't pick and choose and say well I'm
[1:30:48] going to leave my shield behind no the
[1:30:49] whole armor of God that you may be able
[1:30:52] to withstand in the evil day and having
[1:30:54] done all to stand stand amen and if you
[1:30:58] didn't get that he went to verse 24 and
[1:31:00] said stand therefore so it's a double
[1:31:02] stand amen having your loins number one
[1:31:06] Girt about with truth this is actually
[1:31:10] before everything before all your armor
[1:31:13] before every aspect that that he's
[1:31:15] telling you to G yourself up with and
[1:31:17] and to put on and put your helmet on you
[1:31:18] say well my shield my sword is very
[1:31:20] important all that in in in in battle
[1:31:22] but the first aspect that he puts in
[1:31:24] there is to G yourself with
[1:31:29] truth this is before any other
[1:31:32] protection of Weaponry of Defense of
[1:31:34] offense it's first and I again I don't
[1:31:37] feel Paul was so he was not careless
[1:31:39] there's a reason why truth was first
[1:31:42] it's because truth and it's not a
[1:31:43] fashion statement it's because it's a
[1:31:46] major support okay when you're tacking
[1:31:49] on Armor and probably nobody here has
[1:31:51] tacked on medieval armor except a few
[1:31:53] people last night I saw a
[1:31:56] couple I saw a couple did anybody was
[1:31:58] your belt
[1:32:01] first you know that's a process to get
[1:32:04] girded up for war you know there there's
[1:32:06] there's a process there but the belt of
[1:32:08] truth that you would GT about your loins
[1:32:10] it's because it's a major support
[1:32:12] everything buckles to it you know if you
[1:32:15] didn't actually have that belt that g
[1:32:17] about you and you just had your
[1:32:18] breastplate and and all your sword well
[1:32:20] I don't even know where your sword would
[1:32:21] go and all these different things it
[1:32:22] just be clanging and clacking all around
[1:32:24] and you'd be in the battlefield like the
[1:32:25] Tin Man just clankity clankity clankity
[1:32:27] not even knowing how to function like
[1:32:29] well I can't even get my sword I not
[1:32:30] even there because I left it at home
[1:32:32] because I had nothing to G it
[1:32:33] to so truth was number one it was the
[1:32:37] core area it's it's what everything
[1:32:39] buckles to and it's it's if if you don't
[1:32:41] have a core belief if you don't have the
[1:32:43] the core structure if you don't have
[1:32:45] truth well then you are going to
[1:32:47] compromise you are going to just yield
[1:32:48] to this and yield to that oh what
[1:32:50] culture says here well social culture
[1:32:52] says this now so I need to say this I
[1:32:54] can't say that word over here I got to
[1:32:55] say this now because they tell me this
[1:32:58] no they don't tell me nothing that tells
[1:33:00] me what to do that tells me what to say
[1:33:02] that tells me what to act that tells me
[1:33:04] what to believe I don't need no social
[1:33:08] culture my core area my core belief my
[1:33:11] core support is the very word of God
[1:33:15] right you say well that's pretty pretty
[1:33:17] Elementary well I'll tell you there's a
[1:33:19] whole lot of several billion people that
[1:33:21] it's not Elementary too because they are
[1:33:23] they're they are the ones clacking
[1:33:24] around in fact they don't have no armor
[1:33:26] let alone the belt of Truth and so in
[1:33:28] this core area it's your lumbar support
[1:33:30] anybody ever had lumbar
[1:33:33] problems it's
[1:33:35] brutal it's because it's your it's your
[1:33:37] core support when you when your lumbar
[1:33:40] area goes it's just like everything is
[1:33:42] now
[1:33:43] affected and when truth is not present
[1:33:46] that's right in the lumbar regions of
[1:33:48] your spiritual walk every
[1:33:52] is affected how you talk is affected how
[1:33:55] you respond is affected how you act is
[1:33:57] affected how you speak what you do how
[1:34:00] everything is affected young people and
[1:34:02] old people alike and so that Lumber area
[1:34:05] is critical and so you do core
[1:34:08] exercises amen right you get your
[1:34:10] muscles all working you know in the
[1:34:11] pelvis the lower back the hip the ab
[1:34:13] abdomen they all got to work in order
[1:34:15] and harmony for you to be able to
[1:34:17] function you know it leads to better
[1:34:20] balance who doesn't want that leads to
[1:34:23] stability I know I'm talking natural
[1:34:25] sense but just take the spiritual
[1:34:27] connotations and parallels here with
[1:34:29] truth and a strong core that's GT about
[1:34:32] your loins you're going to walk stable
[1:34:35] neither to the left or to the right
[1:34:37] nothing's going to sway you someone's at
[1:34:39] school's going to ask you hey why don't
[1:34:40] you do a little this hey come on with us
[1:34:42] with us and do this or maybe some text
[1:34:43] comes through and you're like who is
[1:34:44] that I'm not responding to that hey join
[1:34:46] us on this at this party no no no you're
[1:34:48] walking stable your support is strong
[1:34:52] you're anchored in the word of God Amen
[1:34:55] that's right you know a good core it
[1:34:58] supports better balance better posture
[1:35:01] you stand up straight shoulders back it
[1:35:03] protects even your organs that's right
[1:35:06] it can reduce and prevent pain it
[1:35:09] actually helps us grow old well strong
[1:35:13] lumbar we all need
[1:35:18] that without core truth amen you think
[1:35:21] as you get older without truth the
[1:35:24] longer you go the more
[1:35:27] decrepit right hunched and weak you
[1:35:31] become that's right spiritually speaking
[1:35:35] nobody wants to be barely able to take a
[1:35:39] step spiritually amen look ahead right
[1:35:44] our core and these loin now as scripture
[1:35:47] says G your loins it's a part of your
[1:35:50] being truth protects this area and we're
[1:35:53] naturally if you if you the loins area
[1:35:54] it's your protective area of your body
[1:35:57] and it's not if you just want to think
[1:35:58] about the I know the reproductive aspect
[1:36:01] but we create things in many ways we
[1:36:03] create things by our words right we
[1:36:06] create you know humans we can build and
[1:36:08] we do different things and people are
[1:36:09] art artists and all that kind of thing
[1:36:11] we create but we also create atmosphere
[1:36:14] amen scripture says let no corrupt
[1:36:16] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:36:18] but that which is good to the use and
[1:36:20] edifying that it may minister Grace unto
[1:36:22] the hearers and so by our words by even
[1:36:24] our presence it creates an atmosphere
[1:36:27] and if our if our if our a COR our loins
[1:36:30] are not GED our spiritual loins with
[1:36:32] truth What atmosphere are we creating
[1:36:34] what words are we speaking and creating
[1:36:36] an atmosphere that's not conducive to
[1:36:38] the Holy Spirit or our relationships we
[1:36:41] create relationships with one another
[1:36:43] and without truth what kind of
[1:36:44] relationship are you creating young man
[1:36:46] or young woman that's looking to enter
[1:36:47] into a relationship or interested in
[1:36:49] each other if truth is not your I'd say
[1:36:52] don't even step into a relationship it's
[1:36:54] got to be your foundation it's got to be
[1:36:55] your support as you walk into a
[1:36:57] relationship you're creating
[1:36:59] something right that's right nothing but
[1:37:03] truth everything we do scripture is
[1:37:06] showing it must be supported with
[1:37:11] truth you got to take this word yes sir
[1:37:15] you need to yourself
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:20] right
[1:37:22] and Satan hates
[1:37:24] it oh he hates it he's fought against it
[1:37:29] he's got his best weapon we know it goes
[1:37:31] back to the very beginning we know his
[1:37:33] his reasoning and doubt be reason being
[1:37:36] is because truth is what defeats him
[1:37:43] right truth is what defeats him and so
[1:37:47] he's so angered and anx against the word
[1:37:50] of God God because it's your anchor he's
[1:37:53] the Healer of all your disease and if
[1:37:55] you can just anchor your faith on a
[1:37:57] scripture in there Lord you bore stripes
[1:37:59] for me you bore it for my iniquity and
[1:38:02] my infirmity You're My Healer you're my
[1:38:04] provider that Abra as Abraham received a
[1:38:06] ram out you created it there if you
[1:38:08] could anchor on that you are a fortress
[1:38:12] against the enemy and so he fights
[1:38:16] you if the scripture all things are
[1:38:20] possible
[1:38:21] to them that believe amen why why why do
[1:38:24] you think he's so heavy on just causing
[1:38:27] just that inkling of Doubt because if
[1:38:29] you could take hold of that scripture
[1:38:31] then indeed all things what's your
[1:38:33] problem this morning what's your need
[1:38:35] this morning you say well it's almost an
[1:38:37] impossible need brother Mike well that's
[1:38:39] okay because my Bible says all things
[1:38:41] can you define all for me it's like
[1:38:44] complete it's entirety it's everything
[1:38:46] it's all encompassing there's nothing
[1:38:48] left out it's not it's not 99.999 it's
[1:38:50] all things that means your problem your
[1:38:53] situation your difficulty your sickness
[1:38:56] I don't really care what it is but all
[1:38:58] things are answered by the very word of
[1:39:00] God which is the truth which is why
[1:39:02] Satan fights
[1:39:04] you yes Lord
[1:39:09] amen I love this quote but BR
[1:39:13] says Jesus said my sheep know my voice a
[1:39:16] voice of course is his word when he is
[1:39:18] speaking my sheep know my voice and my
[1:39:21] voice has been proven to them to be true
[1:39:25] it's been Vindicated that it is my voice
[1:39:30] and I thought about that my sheep know
[1:39:32] my voice and there Jesus was walking
[1:39:34] through the G the the land of Galilee
[1:39:36] and all through the different cities of
[1:39:38] capernum and such and these different
[1:39:39] areas and he would be walking through
[1:39:41] and he'd be saying certain things and
[1:39:43] he'd be start to speak the scripture and
[1:39:44] he'd say I am the way the truth and the
[1:39:47] life and he' start to speak the words to
[1:39:49] them but he didn't just say
[1:39:52] words then they would come up to and the
[1:39:55] lame would
[1:39:57] come and the Halt and the
[1:40:00] blind he said I would that you be
[1:40:04] healed the lady that had seven demons
[1:40:07] the lady that came to wash his feet he
[1:40:10] says stand up and be whole thy sins be
[1:40:12] forgiven the blind saw the deaf heard
[1:40:14] the mute spoke the lame walked the demon
[1:40:17] possessed were delivered his voice of
[1:40:19] what he said was then Vindicated in
[1:40:23] action proving that he is indeed the way
[1:40:27] the truth the
[1:40:29] life I want you to hold on to
[1:40:33] that no
[1:40:35] more but BR says no more than an eagle
[1:40:38] last night as he spoke him on that could
[1:40:39] understand the clucking H his voice rang
[1:40:43] out I'm a Healer and he healed his voice
[1:40:46] rang out that he's a deliverer amen
[1:40:48] isn't that what the scripture says that
[1:40:49] he quoted Isaiah he he says I've come
[1:40:52] amen this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:40:53] there it was to heal the brokenhearted
[1:40:55] to free the bound to bring those that
[1:40:57] are captive to Liberty and he spoke it
[1:40:59] and said this day the scripture is
[1:41:01] fulfilled fulfilled and then he walked
[1:41:02] out what did he do he freed the captive
[1:41:04] he made at Liberty those that were bound
[1:41:06] he delivered those that were in need he
[1:41:08] Vindicated what he said he was that is
[1:41:11] so important Saints brother bit would
[1:41:13] say What's the difference between the
[1:41:14] denominations and what you believe he
[1:41:16] said it's the
[1:41:17] Vindication that's such a vital aspect
[1:41:20] it's a Vindicated
[1:41:23] word a lot of people can say a lot of
[1:41:25] things but does God come behind it and
[1:41:27] activate and vindicate what he
[1:41:30] said and then what he said is my sheep
[1:41:33] hear my voice because something inside
[1:41:35] that Little Hen couldn't hear anything
[1:41:37] they saw they looked they heard they
[1:41:39] noticed but nothing inside them but he
[1:41:41] said only my people only my sheep
[1:41:44] actually have truth inside of them so
[1:41:46] they'll hear truth when it's spoken so
[1:41:49] that's why only someone like Peter or
[1:41:51] John or Andrew would walk along the way
[1:41:53] and he would call them and say Nathaniel
[1:41:55] in whom it is no gu I saw you there you
[1:41:57] were under the tree how did you see me
[1:41:59] and something started to rise up within
[1:42:01] him and said Thou Art the Christ you're
[1:42:04] the Messiah why because he wasn't a
[1:42:06] little can or little little chicken it
[1:42:08] was an eagle that was that he was born
[1:42:10] of a different seed of a different race
[1:42:12] amen and so something rang in his soul
[1:42:15] realm when he heard the scream something
[1:42:17] pilate never
[1:42:19] heard right
[1:42:26] discernment Charles Spurgeon said
[1:42:28] discernment is not knowing the
[1:42:29] difference between right and wrong it's
[1:42:31] knowing the difference between right and
[1:42:34] almost right amen that's
[1:42:37] good
[1:42:38] right we're not really worried about
[1:42:40] right and wrong it's the almost right
[1:42:42] Ary the problem because that's how the
[1:42:45] devil is just wanting to to to figure it
[1:42:47] out as the other old quote goes close
[1:42:49] only works in Horseshoes and Hand
[1:42:50] Grenades it's good to be close there but
[1:42:52] everywhere else it's not so good you got
[1:42:54] to be dead on Amen and so here we go at
[1:42:57] the very beginning the very beginning
[1:42:59] strategy of the enemy as the as as the
[1:43:02] battle now for truth would have started
[1:43:05] Genesis 3:1 says now the serpent was
[1:43:07] more subtle than any beast of the field
[1:43:10] of which the Lord God had made and he
[1:43:12] said unto the woman yay hath God said ye
[1:43:17] shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:43:19] garden
[1:43:21] I want you to realize this is the first
[1:43:23] question ever recorded in
[1:43:24] scripture and it's presented now the
[1:43:27] very first dilemma in scripture never
[1:43:30] had there been a
[1:43:33] question in
[1:43:35] scripture hath God said so I would say
[1:43:39] the
[1:43:40] moment that Devil comes to present a
[1:43:46] question go right back and say I know
[1:43:49] exactly where you're at there
[1:43:51] I'm just going to point you back to the
[1:43:53] beginning because you haven't obviously
[1:43:54] changed your tactic and here in chapter
[1:43:57] 3 you did that so
[1:44:00] immediately you should have every bit of
[1:44:03] armor it's already buckled strong and
[1:44:05] it's right up and ready for the
[1:44:07] offense all right because here ha God
[1:44:11] said and he's now he's just created how
[1:44:14] it's been recorded he said he he
[1:44:17] goes it's phrased in a way to create
[1:44:20] something
[1:44:21] it's phrased in a way to create doubt is
[1:44:23] what it is it's how he's done it and now
[1:44:25] for the first time this this deadly
[1:44:28] damic force has come into the world
[1:44:30] covertly smuggled into human life now
[1:44:32] it's this assumption that what God has
[1:44:34] said is subject now to human
[1:44:39] judgment have he
[1:44:41] said so now he's taken what God Said and
[1:44:44] he's like now now but I have I have my
[1:44:47] own idea about
[1:44:49] this think about this and he's now
[1:44:52] trying to introduce the thought to Eve
[1:44:54] in her mind that there's actually
[1:44:56] something wrong with forbidding the
[1:44:58] fruit it's kind of like did God really
[1:45:01] tell you that is that really what he was
[1:45:04] meaning is that really what this message
[1:45:07] means
[1:45:09] amen
[1:45:10] amen Satan very subtle now asking Eve
[1:45:15] you make a judgment call Eve I'm putting
[1:45:17] you this to you now you make a call is
[1:45:19] this really what God was saying did God
[1:45:22] really tell you not to eat from any tree
[1:45:24] in the garden did he really say that why
[1:45:27] would God even put this restriction on
[1:45:28] you why would God do that why would he
[1:45:30] be so
[1:45:31] narrow amen why would he even limit you
[1:45:34] this way why would does God really want
[1:45:37] you to be free isn't God you know for
[1:45:39] free will isn't he pro-choice isn't he
[1:45:41] for Freedom doesn't God want you to do
[1:45:43] whatever you want to do come on It come
[1:45:47] on whatever looks good whatever feels
[1:45:48] good whatever brings you to pleasure
[1:45:49] whatever brings you Joy whatever brings
[1:45:51] you satisfaction whatever brings you
[1:45:52] Freedom why is God limiting you this
[1:45:55] way isn't that effectively what he was
[1:45:57] saying to her right right and notice in
[1:46:01] that question Satan asked he said from
[1:46:04] every tree of the garden as if the
[1:46:07] prohibition was of the whole
[1:46:10] place it was one tree that's right but
[1:46:13] the way Satan's formed it it's like no
[1:46:15] everything here you why is he so limit
[1:46:18] he's so
[1:46:19] narrow-minded
[1:46:22] and the suggestion that really god
[1:46:23] tampers with your freedom God restricts
[1:46:25] you Eve God is very narrow he takes away
[1:46:28] your
[1:46:30] right I'm just taking out of that
[1:46:33] scripture there hath God said you know
[1:46:36] you got to read between the
[1:46:40] lines God's un is even unkind taking
[1:46:44] away the pleasures could you really be
[1:46:47] able to trust him
[1:46:49] now this is a perfect world Eve why
[1:46:51] would you ever do that this is really
[1:46:53] unnecessary and Satan plants the
[1:46:55] thoughts now in her mind right that God
[1:46:58] is this way he's restraining and he's
[1:47:00] limiting he's unkind and really not
[1:47:02] fully good and now he's devoted but he
[1:47:05] now the serpent he's devoted to her
[1:47:12] Freedom here he's presenting an option
[1:47:14] now I'm really I care for you H so much
[1:47:17] more I'm gonna present you a better
[1:47:19] option Eve I care more than God
[1:47:25] cares her choice for happiness really
[1:47:28] cares more than God does and maybe even
[1:47:30] saying with a little bit of incredulity
[1:47:32] I can't believe that God even told you
[1:47:34] you couldn't even eat of that tree why
[1:47:36] would he ever do that and plants now
[1:47:39] this seed in her mind that God is flawed
[1:47:41] in his character and his goodness is
[1:47:47] suspicious
[1:47:49] wow and now when Eve swallowed this she
[1:47:54] swallowed her right and ability now and
[1:47:57] she's now said now I actually can
[1:47:59] question God's word she swallowed this
[1:48:02] now and so once she swallowed that yeah
[1:48:07] now then Satan steps in with the next
[1:48:09] part which is step two and follows up
[1:48:11] now with the
[1:48:13] lie he's not going to present the LIE
[1:48:15] very first he's going to step in first
[1:48:17] and just say really is this where God's
[1:48:19] at
[1:48:20] is this really the right way and once
[1:48:23] you question and doubt that and question
[1:48:26] the truth then he presents the lie that
[1:48:29] you're going to be ready to swallow
[1:48:31] that's his tactic not saying you have
[1:48:33] I'm just saying this is his tactic amen
[1:48:36] and so now here Eve he says now for you
[1:48:39] shall not surely die I mean we're not
[1:48:42] we're not even talking right and almost
[1:48:43] right here we're talking right in total
[1:48:46] contrary to what God has just spoken ye
[1:48:48] shall not surely die but because he
[1:48:49] prepped her
[1:48:50] he prepped her he got her in a place to
[1:48:52] reason and question the very word of God
[1:48:56] and that's exactly where he wants you
[1:48:57] young people and everybody here he wants
[1:48:59] you just to step in and just I don't
[1:49:01] care what scripture I don't care what
[1:49:03] one word out of the thousands in here if
[1:49:05] he can get you to a place just to doubt
[1:49:07] one word of God then he presents the lie
[1:49:11] and says well you're not going to die I
[1:49:12] know he said that but it's
[1:49:17] wrong I I know he said in Malachi 4 that
[1:49:19] he's going to send a prophet like Elijah
[1:49:22] at the end time before the great and
[1:49:23] judgeful day of the Lord but it's
[1:49:24] wrong I know he said Revelation 10:7
[1:49:27] says that there's going to be an angel
[1:49:29] is going to come to seven Angel is going
[1:49:30] to come and reveal all the mysteries of
[1:49:31] God but it's wrong that's not the one
[1:49:34] but you know it vindicate no no it's
[1:49:36] it's wrong and you've already stepped
[1:49:38] into believe and to listen to him I say
[1:49:41] don't even let him get to square one
[1:49:43] don't even let him get you to the place
[1:49:45] where you're like well I don't no don't
[1:49:46] get to the while I don't just say you're
[1:49:48] wrong you're an offense to me devil I'm
[1:49:51] going to stand on God's word I'm going
[1:49:52] to believe it with all my heart
[1:49:55] regardless of what you
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:59] say don't give him a toenail
[1:50:03] hold
[1:50:05] right so he says you not surely die and
[1:50:08] if we can say Satan effectively says
[1:50:10] well Eve God's a liar and I tell you the
[1:50:12] truth now don't believe a word of it
[1:50:14] believe me God doesn't tell the truth
[1:50:17] there's no judgment there's no
[1:50:18] consequences if you eat it you can't
[1:50:20] trust God no more to tell you the truth
[1:50:22] you can't even believe his word anymore
[1:50:23] it's needlessly narrow needlessly
[1:50:25] confining and restraining I am now the
[1:50:31] absolute think about
[1:50:33] that you say well that was just Eve no
[1:50:36] I'd say that's everybody in this day and
[1:50:38] age the same Slicker the same devil the
[1:50:41] same one that just entered into that
[1:50:42] Garden so subtly just weaving his little
[1:50:44] way along in his life and his way to
[1:50:46] start to question it's in the same you
[1:50:47] say well it's not really here you bet it
[1:50:49] is it's in the the very ranks of this
[1:50:51] message that is causing cuz he's trying
[1:50:52] to get you to be
[1:50:54] deceived because it'll be so close that
[1:50:57] it'll deceive even the very El if it
[1:50:59] were possible you don't tell me that the
[1:51:01] Slicker is not coming in and trying to
[1:51:03] present just the most smallest subtle
[1:51:06] bit of Doubt oh saints of God we got to
[1:51:09] be so watchful so careful that we just
[1:51:13] be be don't even let anybody come in and
[1:51:15] try to tamper with the word of God I'm
[1:51:16] not saying with your idea I'm saying
[1:51:18] with the word of God
[1:51:21] you take it back to hear and you take it
[1:51:23] back to a Vindicated message I don't
[1:51:25] care what somebody else said I want to
[1:51:27] see their Vindication I want to see the
[1:51:29] angel of God back up behind them before
[1:51:31] they tell me what they
[1:51:35] think I tell you everybody post post the
[1:51:38] messenger has a lot of things to say you
[1:51:40] can't tell me that there wasn't even
[1:51:42] more during The Messengers day you don't
[1:51:44] think they were trying to trap him
[1:51:46] trying to get him to go into a corner
[1:51:47] trying to find some area in his life
[1:51:49] that they could put a finger hold on and
[1:51:51] say aha look at that and you think now
[1:51:55] is hard right then and they couldn't
[1:51:57] find it they couldn't find one thing
[1:51:59] false in all the Vindication in all the
[1:52:01] discernment not one time I don't care to
[1:52:03] sense about this day and age what
[1:52:06] someone
[1:52:07] says
[1:52:09] hallelujah hallu
[1:52:13] sir L Brown says Eve was easily
[1:52:16] persuaded by Satan from the word of God
[1:52:18] and she leaned on her own
[1:52:20] understanding he said she had something
[1:52:22] something else had told her by the enemy
[1:52:24] Satan and she believed it and it plunged
[1:52:27] the whole human race to death he said
[1:52:30] now it ended finally death to the whole
[1:52:32] race he said the word of God Satan
[1:52:35] speaking now but brandom speaking on his
[1:52:37] behalf he's saying that the word of God
[1:52:38] is Not altogether true that some of it
[1:52:41] is inspired and some of it is not heard
[1:52:45] that
[1:52:47] before well let's just nail that's
[1:52:49] coffin closed how can you have faith in
[1:52:51] a Bible If part of it is inspired and
[1:52:54] part of it is not if one if one
[1:52:57] quotation is wrong the whole thing then
[1:52:59] might be wrong it's got to be all right
[1:53:01] exactly right and if I can say what
[1:53:03] you've probably heard a 100 thousand
[1:53:05] times God will never vindicate an
[1:53:09] [Applause]
[1:53:11] error so then if he vindicates truth my
[1:53:14] word is truth it's all truth and nothing
[1:53:18] but the truth so help me
[1:53:21] God to quote your
[1:53:25] judges and this tactic really is held
[1:53:27] through all
[1:53:30] time Satan has used it over over and
[1:53:35] over again to where really truth has
[1:53:39] become relative there's no absolute to
[1:53:41] truth because now he's he throws that
[1:53:43] one on everybody so then everybody
[1:53:44] questions it and everybody's got their
[1:53:45] own human brain and so you've def
[1:53:47] deciphered it some way and so now you've
[1:53:49] got your own truth and so everybody has
[1:53:51] their own truth you know it's relative
[1:53:53] your truth's relative to someone else's
[1:53:55] truth and you so you say well you say
[1:53:56] what's that mean exactly well being
[1:53:58] relative to something means if I if I
[1:54:00] made $10 an hour and someone's going to
[1:54:03] drop me $50,000 I say whoa that's a
[1:54:06] that's a chunk of cash and it'd be
[1:54:08] amazing and it'd be incredible but if I
[1:54:10] made $50 million and someone was going
[1:54:13] to drop me $50,000 I'd be like no
[1:54:15] thanks but I got a lot more it's
[1:54:18] relative right it's relative to my
[1:54:20] position and everybody's truth becomes
[1:54:22] relative to someone else's position on
[1:54:24] how they think about something right
[1:54:26] that's this is how it is nowadays well
[1:54:28] you believe what's true for you and I'll
[1:54:29] believe what's true for me and know
[1:54:31] we're all just get together you know you
[1:54:32] can tolerate this and I'll tolerate that
[1:54:34] and it's all good you know truth it's
[1:54:35] subjective to my culture it's it's you
[1:54:37] know this is what we do and and this is
[1:54:39] my truth and you have your culture and
[1:54:41] that's your
[1:54:43] truth maybe truth is in the eye of the
[1:54:45] beholder maybe Different Strokes for
[1:54:47] different folks you know you have your
[1:54:49] beliefs and I I have mine maybe trust
[1:54:51] your feelings you know CU that's my
[1:54:52] truth I'm going to I'm going to trust
[1:54:54] that or my education you know my
[1:54:55] experience that's my truth I have an
[1:54:57] high IQ I have a high EQ you know and
[1:54:59] that's where I'm going to leave
[1:55:05] things everybody's got their own truth
[1:55:08] it is what it is it's where we're living
[1:55:09] Saints and so you got to be able to go
[1:55:11] to back to something young people you
[1:55:13] living in the most wicked time 10 times
[1:55:15] worse than where I was and 100 times
[1:55:16] worse than where your your parents were
[1:55:18] Etc and you have to be able to go back
[1:55:20] to an absolute and say my goodness
[1:55:22] culture is telling me to do this my
[1:55:24] friends are telling me to do that and
[1:55:25] social media is telling me to do this
[1:55:26] celebrities are telling me to do that
[1:55:28] pressure here pressure there you've got
[1:55:29] to be able to go back to a truth the
[1:55:31] truth the absolute
[1:55:34] truth you
[1:55:36] must feelings betray you my goodness
[1:55:38] you're up today or down tomorrow you
[1:55:41] know I had it in my notes
[1:55:45] somewhere you
[1:55:47] know if I went on my feelings on truth
[1:55:50] if I could put it in a bit of an analogy
[1:55:53] let's uh let's hook you up to your
[1:55:55] feelings on a long bungee cord and your
[1:55:57] feelings are the anchor and
[1:56:04] jump let me tell how how well you're
[1:56:07] going to last in that situation cuz
[1:56:08] today it's good and tomorrow it's bad
[1:56:10] and my feelings are this way and then my
[1:56:11] feelings are that way so today I'm going
[1:56:13] to Anchor my my bungee jump on my
[1:56:15] feelings today but somehow you're like
[1:56:16] where was I when I was thinking that and
[1:56:18] you jumped off on something and dying on
[1:56:20] it because you jumped on your feelings
[1:56:21] cuz today now it's changed you're like
[1:56:23] well that just meant nothing yeah but
[1:56:24] you made a decision over there on those
[1:56:26] feelings because that was your truth and
[1:56:28] you just jumped off the edge and you
[1:56:30] crashed and
[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:36] burned yes L Brandon says but you're
[1:56:38] afraid you go how you feel because
[1:56:40] you've regarded that you live by your
[1:56:42] feelings your whole life has been
[1:56:43] wrapped in that but you must get away
[1:56:44] from that and act on God's word not what
[1:56:47] you feel not what you see but what God
[1:56:49] God said amen but what God Said is my
[1:56:52] absolute truth that's when no matter
[1:56:54] what situation I go through when it
[1:56:56] looks like my whole life is Caven and my
[1:56:58] family looks like it's breaking apart
[1:56:59] and I got sickness in my home and I got
[1:57:01] a disease causing issue with my children
[1:57:03] and I can anchor my tie poost to the
[1:57:05] very Rock of Ages left for me and say
[1:57:07] you bore stripes for this situation you
[1:57:09] hang on across for my situation and I'm
[1:57:11] going to Anchor my little Lifeline to
[1:57:13] that and guess where I'm going right off
[1:57:15] the edge because I know that will hold
[1:57:18] me
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:22] you say well that's into the unknown
[1:57:23] that's okay because I know the chord
[1:57:25] that's what it's anchored to I know what
[1:57:27] it's anchored to and I know he'll never
[1:57:30] let me go his strong arm can reach far
[1:57:33] far down into the depths of sin Saint
[1:57:35] and he can reach down his hand for you
[1:57:37] in the muck and the mire because that's
[1:57:39] the anchor
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:43] post that's what job did job got to that
[1:57:47] spot that's right finally he began but
[1:57:49] brand says then finally he begin to feel
[1:57:51] the strain tightening up oh my can you
[1:57:56] imagine the feeling of that all he'd
[1:57:57] gone through I tell you he was Free
[1:57:59] Falling for a long
[1:58:02] time anybody here bungee
[1:58:06] jumped all
[1:58:08] right I'm all alone in this am
[1:58:12] I I have bungee
[1:58:14] jumped so I'm going to speak from
[1:58:17] experience and you leap off the edge
[1:58:20] boy is that a feeling and I can tell you
[1:58:22] that pales in comparison of when you
[1:58:24] have some situation you're like Lord I
[1:58:26] have no idea of where this is taking me
[1:58:29] and you jump off that the edge and
[1:58:30] suddenly everything of course you go
[1:58:32] weightless your stomach goes a little
[1:58:33] crazy and you're just now in the void
[1:58:35] and you're looking at the ground coming
[1:58:36] closer and maybe just maybe in your mind
[1:58:38] for some of you it flashes oh boy I
[1:58:40] think this thing's going to I hope it's
[1:58:42] going to
[1:58:45] hold yeah you're just and then then you
[1:58:47] have other problems because the ground's
[1:58:49] coming coming closer things are flying
[1:58:50] so fast and then you feel the strain
[1:58:54] tighten up and that moment when you
[1:58:57] realize that yes it's holding is a
[1:59:00] really good feeling when job well felt
[1:59:03] the strain tighten up I know in whom I
[1:59:06] have believed and am persuaded I know my
[1:59:10] redeemer liveth and I will see him on
[1:59:12] that day though my flesh would go to the
[1:59:14] worms in the dust I'm going to see him
[1:59:16] the strain tightened up it didn't matter
[1:59:18] what happened Oh my he was
[1:59:29] anchored well I'm just going to do me
[1:59:31] you do you you do me do me what works
[1:59:34] for me is best you know if you take the
[1:59:37] path of least resistance
[1:59:39] humanity is always going to go the easy
[1:59:43] way always that's just how man is built
[1:59:47] and so if you're going to go your way it
[1:59:48] always always be the path of least
[1:59:50] resistance and I can tell you this is a
[1:59:53] rugged way it's a very resistive way
[1:59:56] you've got a battle in this way and so
[1:59:59] if you're going your way you're going to
[2:00:01] go the least resistant way I tell you
[2:00:03] it's the wrong way that's right well all
[2:00:06] religions brother Michael have truth all
[2:00:08] paths lead to Heaven no oh okay know
[2:00:12] Christian is so
[2:00:14] limiting
[2:00:16] uh-huh but Bram says I believe we're
[2:00:18] living in the last day this last
[2:00:22] message if everything was truth it
[2:00:25] actually would defeat the whole meaning
[2:00:27] of truth that's right cuz if all was
[2:00:30] true well then that doesn't even the
[2:00:32] word doesn't mean truth because there
[2:00:34] has to be a false for there to be truth
[2:00:37] so if you say all paths lead to to
[2:00:39] heaven and everything is true well then
[2:00:41] what's the needful of the word true why
[2:00:44] would there even be a word that way
[2:00:45] because all of it's true no something
[2:00:49] has to be wrong for there to be true so
[2:00:51] that means not you got to find what's
[2:00:54] the absolute truth like I said discern
[2:00:56] between right and almost right brother
[2:00:59] brandham
[2:01:00] says that's why I'm here tonight trying
[2:01:02] my best to call every side of the world
[2:01:04] and all that I can do to let the people
[2:01:06] see that he is the true and living God
[2:01:10] he's the only door the only religion out
[2:01:13] of thousands of religion Christian
[2:01:15] religion is the only one that can prove
[2:01:18] their founder is still
[2:01:21] alive Hallelujah that's where young
[2:01:24] people you can stand on the ground and
[2:01:25] say m you can tell me all you want but I
[2:01:28] know that I serve a living God and we're
[2:01:30] going to get there because you might
[2:01:31] need this when you stand toe to- Toe
[2:01:33] with the devil in the coming days and
[2:01:34] you say well how can I tell them that my
[2:01:37] God is alive today amen all right I'm
[2:01:39] going to give you some ammunition amen
[2:01:41] I'm going to put some bullets in your
[2:01:42] big shot gun we're going to put a big
[2:01:44] old slug in there okay big 12 gauge
[2:01:46] Slugger you
[2:01:48] ready
[2:01:50] he says nothing to be ashamed of in
[2:01:51] Christianity if it isn't the truth then
[2:01:53] I'm through with it if it isn't the
[2:01:55] truth I want the it's the biggest err in
[2:01:56] the world world ever had but if it's the
[2:01:58] truth I'm willing to die for it amen you
[2:02:03] got to be willing to die for this truth
[2:02:05] die for this gospel and so then brother
[2:02:07] brandom as we continue through it comes
[2:02:09] down then you have some what you would
[2:02:10] call Showdown moments when it you come
[2:02:13] to the moment where all right I'm
[2:02:15] willing to die here this is the mountain
[2:02:17] I'm willing to die on
[2:02:19] some things you go through life you're
[2:02:20] like yep it's not the mountain I'm
[2:02:21] willing to die on it's going to walk
[2:02:23] away from that one it's just not worth
[2:02:24] the argument it's not worth but there
[2:02:25] are mountains that are willing to die on
[2:02:28] and I will tell you defending and
[2:02:30] offending for the gospel truth is a
[2:02:33] mountain willing to die
[2:02:35] on
[2:02:38] right and so we come to these moments if
[2:02:41] we go back in
[2:02:43] scripture mankind came to a place where
[2:02:45] they had raised up their
[2:02:47] ideas God had to make a a special move
[2:02:50] and so remember the beginning the cility
[2:02:53] and how Eve brought in that question and
[2:02:56] so truth and certain things have been
[2:02:57] lost faith had been lost and now God in
[2:03:00] scripture had a big battle on you know
[2:03:02] there's in in a war you have lots of
[2:03:04] battles and some battles are bigger than
[2:03:05] others and here now we're going to go
[2:03:07] into a little area where God had to come
[2:03:08] in and now fight a battle and God was
[2:03:11] revealing to himself in Israel as we
[2:03:12] heard this morning song He's The God Who
[2:03:15] fights for me Lord of every Victory
[2:03:17] Hallelujah man as he brought them out of
[2:03:20] Egypt showed himself Mighty with through
[2:03:22] deliverance and all through the
[2:03:23] different plagues and then there was a
[2:03:25] mingling they got out of that and they
[2:03:27] went through a period of time and they
[2:03:28] started to mingle started to to to to
[2:03:32] interconnect with different religions
[2:03:34] you could say the the almost right
[2:03:36] religions as they were and then not the
[2:03:38] not so right and then the very wrong
[2:03:40] they started to accept other gods as
[2:03:42] okay and
[2:03:44] true right think about this say wow how
[2:03:47] do we get to this point well if you look
[2:03:48] in the script scripture Israel went from
[2:03:49] a God that delivered them with a strong
[2:03:51] hand brought them out of Egypt decimated
[2:03:53] the the whole uh the whole uh Egypt's
[2:03:57] territory and their whole economy and
[2:03:58] Etc it brought them out of it it killed
[2:04:00] the firstborn of everything and here
[2:04:02] that this is our God and then not too
[2:04:04] long down the road it's like well you
[2:04:06] know Bale's good and asaroth is good and
[2:04:09] we're just D
[2:04:11] true incredible huh time drifted so did
[2:04:15] they resolve for truth and judges came
[2:04:18] and it say in judges it was in the days
[2:04:19] and there was no King and every man did
[2:04:21] that which was right in his own eyes his
[2:04:24] own truth and I'd say maybe that's about
[2:04:26] the time people are in here right now
[2:04:28] and they deem that it's okay to deviate
[2:04:29] from other worship we can worship
[2:04:31] another God and it was even very clear
[2:04:33] the Commandments even with the
[2:04:34] Commandments of Moses written and given
[2:04:36] directly from God it was you know they
[2:04:39] found it that there was there should
[2:04:40] have been some leeway for them to do
[2:04:41] their own
[2:04:42] thing God said in Exodus I am the Lord
[2:04:45] thy God which brought thee out of the
[2:04:47] land of Egypt out of the house of
[2:04:49] bondage Thou shalt have no other gods
[2:04:52] before me they knew God was speaking
[2:04:55] they'd seen God vindicate himself
[2:04:56] amongst them and here God is directly
[2:04:58] telling them no other gods so you say
[2:05:01] how is this possible because the devil's
[2:05:03] a Slicker and so he says Thou shalt not
[2:05:05] make any Graven image any likeness of
[2:05:07] anything Thou shalt not bow thyself down
[2:05:09] nor serve them for that I am the Lord
[2:05:11] thy God and I am a jealous God visiting
[2:05:13] the iniquity of the fathers upon the
[2:05:14] children under the third and fourth
[2:05:16] generation but Israel unfortunately
[2:05:18] Contin went back and forth and felt this
[2:05:21] and then a judge would rise up and then
[2:05:22] they'd go back and another Jud judge
[2:05:24] would rise up and it came to a climax at
[2:05:26] the lowest of depths of Israel they heid
[2:05:29] taken and Ahab the son of omry did evil
[2:05:32] in the sight of the Lord above all that
[2:05:34] were before him and it came to pass as
[2:05:36] if it had been a light
[2:05:39] thing came to a place Israel came to a
[2:05:42] place where it was a light thing just
[2:05:45] casual who cares God doesn't care about
[2:05:47] this it's it's really not a big deal if
[2:05:49] I if I do this here I mean really what's
[2:05:51] the big deal everybody's doing it I mean
[2:05:52] come on why can't I watch a whole bunch
[2:05:54] of movies here and there and every why
[2:05:55] can't I do this it's not really a big
[2:05:58] deal it became a light thing to deviate
[2:06:02] for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam
[2:06:04] it was a light thing to do such and he
[2:06:06] reared up an altar for Baal in the house
[2:06:08] of Baal which had been built in Samaria
[2:06:10] and he did more to provoke the Lord God
[2:06:12] of Israel and to anger them than all the
[2:06:15] kings of Israel that were before him
[2:06:18] what a place they had come to and out of
[2:06:22] the
[2:06:23] blue but brand even says don't even know
[2:06:25] where he came from out of the blue
[2:06:27] Elijah the tishbite walks on to the
[2:06:30] scene amen that's right the age had got
[2:06:33] so dark it had got so wicked it had got
[2:06:36] so evil it took a prophet that God sent
[2:06:38] down and said I need you to step out in
[2:06:40] this age because I need you to come to a
[2:06:43] showdown to show that this word of mine
[2:06:46] is true so I'm going to send a prophet
[2:06:49] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[2:06:51] Dreadful story before The Showdown of
[2:06:52] Mount Caramel to show the world what's
[2:06:58] truth you know Baal was the god of
[2:07:02] fertility he was the one that bestowed
[2:07:04] fruit and bounty to the land he was also
[2:07:07] actually called the Lord of rain and
[2:07:10] Dew God's got to sense a humor yes does
[2:07:14] because their God the fertile God they
[2:07:17] say of rain and duw the one that could
[2:07:20] bring all sustenance you know the highly
[2:07:22] adaptable God he could be Zeus he could
[2:07:24] be Jupiter he morphed Through Time
[2:07:26] baales rooted in sensuality and
[2:07:28] ritualistic prostitution at times even
[2:07:31] human sacrifice usually the firstborn to
[2:07:33] one of the making a sacrifice and the
[2:07:35] now the Canaanites worship bail and he
[2:07:37] usually depicted holding a lightning
[2:07:38] bolt and he defeated enemies and he
[2:07:41] produced crops and God sends a prophet
[2:07:43] and says there'll be no rain for the
[2:07:45] next until I call for
[2:07:47] it
[2:07:49] amen I challenge your God that you say
[2:07:53] is true to a
[2:07:55] duel you say he's the Lord of Reign and
[2:07:58] du I'm going to send my messenger out
[2:08:01] there and I'm going to announce to you a
[2:08:02] declaration of war they'll be no rain
[2:08:05] until I call for
[2:08:09] it that's what was happening right
[2:08:12] there I don't even know how these how
[2:08:15] the the prophets of baale and all that
[2:08:17] kind of thing well we're getting get
[2:08:18] there and so Elijah came to all the
[2:08:20] people and he said how halt you because
[2:08:22] now we go through the story but he now
[2:08:24] brings him to Mount Caramel and he goes
[2:08:26] now how halt you up between two
[2:08:30] opinions if the Lord be God follow him
[2:08:32] but if ba follow him and the people
[2:08:34] answered not a
[2:08:39] word
[2:08:43] silence and it came down to this is
[2:08:47] true or this is
[2:08:49] true there's no in between false true or
[2:08:54] false true and you can't halt now
[2:08:57] between two opinions because halting is
[2:09:00] a state of uncertainty I just don't know
[2:09:03] I'm just uncertain about it there's just
[2:09:05] this little bit of Doubt just a hint of
[2:09:07] doubt you're now halting a little bit
[2:09:09] you're kind of in Eve's place you're
[2:09:10] like well it's that halting moment and
[2:09:13] between an opinion it's not capable of
[2:09:15] being proven either way so you've just
[2:09:17] kind of like well I don't know if I can
[2:09:18] prove it this way or prove it that way
[2:09:20] you're halting between two opinions and
[2:09:22] Elijah was coming down and saying you're
[2:09:24] why halt you between two opinions coming
[2:09:26] this day to not be an opinion what's
[2:09:28] true and what's false there's not going
[2:09:30] to be no room for opinion there's not
[2:09:32] going to be room for halting you're
[2:09:33] coming to a moment where you're going to
[2:09:34] have to say choose ye this day in whom
[2:09:37] you'll serve that's
[2:09:41] right God has come to that moment in
[2:09:43] this day and age it's a choosy this day
[2:09:46] moment I'm sorry but there is no room
[2:09:47] for
[2:09:49] opinion they'd seen God move back and
[2:09:52] forth and and many times before that and
[2:09:55] I'd say Israel now had even rendered
[2:09:56] their beliefs to just opinion and so now
[2:09:58] Elijah came up to the people and he said
[2:10:01] I only remain a prophet of the Lord and
[2:10:03] but the baale prophets are 450 men and
[2:10:05] here they come and he goes go get two
[2:10:06] Bullocks and one bulock for themselves
[2:10:08] and cut them into pieces and he goes
[2:10:09] through all the different things and
[2:10:11] here's what we're going to do and so he
[2:10:12] laid out the whole plan and then the
[2:10:14] people said it's well spoken so now they
[2:10:17] agreed we're okay with this duel we're
[2:10:20] okay with the terms so now it's on their
[2:10:23] hands right now it's you God laid it
[2:10:28] out he said all right took the Bullock
[2:10:30] dressed it put it on the Altar and it
[2:10:32] came to pass here at
[2:10:36] noon the prophets of Baal had taken
[2:10:39] their all their different things and
[2:10:40] there they called on the name of Baal
[2:10:42] this is the the Lord of rain and duw
[2:10:44] that should come down and and bring fire
[2:10:46] into the Altar and consume the sacrifice
[2:10:49] because of course he's God and he can do
[2:10:51] these things and bail hear us and there
[2:10:53] was no voice nothing that even answered
[2:10:55] and they leaped on the altar think about
[2:10:56] this scene here they have the altar at
[2:10:58] 450 prophets are are dancing all around
[2:11:01] this thing and jumping up on down on the
[2:11:03] Altar and they're calling and yelling
[2:11:04] and screaming then they're cutting
[2:11:05] themselves and this is this is a
[2:11:07] scene a foolish scene and Israel is
[2:11:10] sitting down there being
[2:11:12] like
[2:11:16] wow what's happened
[2:11:20] wow and even Elijah steps in and says
[2:11:24] hey the scripture says he mocked them
[2:11:27] right hey cry
[2:11:29] aloud he's he's your god let's go let
[2:11:32] you know say something a little louder
[2:11:33] maybe you're too quiet and it went from
[2:11:35] probably 100 DB to 150 DB through the
[2:11:38] through the audience or maybe maybe he's
[2:11:40] talking to somebody or maybe he's
[2:11:42] pursuing something or maybe he's on a
[2:11:44] journey and he's ignoring
[2:11:46] you you mean your God doesn't care for
[2:11:48] for you isn't he caring about where
[2:11:49] you're at like this is a showdown moment
[2:11:51] maybe he's out on vacation somewhere
[2:11:53] maybe per Adventure he's
[2:11:56] sleeping oh my goodness talk about an
[2:11:59] insult to
[2:12:02] injury right they cried aloud and they
[2:12:04] cut themselves after their manner with
[2:12:06] knives and lancets till Blood gushed Out
[2:12:08] upon them and they worshiped loud and
[2:12:10] boisterous with emotion and shouting oh
[2:12:13] my goodness our God is
[2:12:16] here no he's not right amen because it's
[2:12:19] the God who answers by fire
[2:12:30] amen he said all right it's my
[2:12:33] turn stop your yelling stop your
[2:12:35] shouting stop your screaming just sit
[2:12:38] down amen and a little
[2:12:42] Prophet walks on the
[2:12:44] scene and the first thing he does he
[2:12:47] begins begins to repair the altar yes
[2:12:49] sir that's right Stone amen by Stone
[2:12:53] that's right the first thing you need to
[2:12:55] do is repair the altar that's right
[2:12:57] maybe something's out of place he starts
[2:13:00] to rebuild that's right put things back
[2:13:02] in order that's right number one amen
[2:13:05] because he wanted God to come on the
[2:13:06] scene and he had to take care of
[2:13:08] business first you want God to come and
[2:13:11] scene in your life you want God to move
[2:13:12] in your life you need to take care of
[2:13:13] business first you to repair the altar
[2:13:15] of your heart you say Lord I need to get
[2:13:17] this out of here I want this out of here

[2:13:20] listening to this here I want a full
[2:13:21] surrender I need to wipe it all out just
[2:13:23] place your finger in every air of my
[2:13:25] heart I'm going to open up every doorway
[2:13:26] I want to rebuild the altar cuz I want
[2:13:32] fire so there he repairs The Altar and
[2:13:34] cleans it all up and he takes the 12
[2:13:36] Stones according to the tribes of Israel
[2:13:38] builds the altar with stones puts the
[2:13:39] wood in order he gets them together
[2:13:42] kills the bulock and he lays it now on
[2:13:44] top of the altar but Abraham says now to
[2:13:46] be sure there there's no faking
[2:13:51] this go get me 12 barrels of water yeah
[2:13:54] and he soaked the wood water soaked he
[2:13:57] said oh Hallelujah he wanted to show
[2:14:00] that God was God because why he had thus
[2:14:03] saith the Lord right he was pouring on
[2:14:06] The Impossible on top of the impossible
[2:14:09] and he said I want to make sure that
[2:14:11] you're going to see in front of the
[2:14:13] world that my God is
[2:14:16] God this was not something that was in
[2:14:18] the back corner something that was hid
[2:14:20] behind the curtain say well yeah he did
[2:14:22] it back there but I know but I didn't
[2:14:24] see it no this was in front of them and
[2:14:25] to just put it down into it then bring

[2:14:39] the
[2:14:41] Lord
[2:14:43] hallelujah there the water ran all down
[2:14:46] and it came to pass at the time of the
[2:14:47] offer offing the evening sacrifice he
[2:14:48] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[2:14:51] Israel let it be known this day that

[2:14:55] servant and I have done all these things
[2:14:57] of Thy word hear me oh Lord that this
[2:15:00] people may know that thou art the Lord
[2:15:03] God and thou Hast turned their heart
[2:15:06] back again amen ever heard that
[2:15:09] scripture before yes sir
[2:15:11] amen Elijah and the spirit of Elijah are
[2:15:15] going to be saying the same thing
[2:15:16] they're going to be acting the same way
[2:15:18] they're going to be doing the same thing
[2:15:19] because the types cannot lie God cannot
[2:15:22] change and so he says so that thou has
[2:15:24] turned their heart back
[2:15:29] again and the fire of the Lord fell and
[2:15:33] consumed the birt sacrifice and the wood
[2:15:36] and the stones and the dust and licked
[2:15:38] up the water that was even in the
[2:15:41] trench the allc consuming fire of God
[2:15:44] came and Vindicated himself to prove to
[2:15:47] Israel
[2:15:48] I am
[2:15:50] God you say well brother Michael the
[2:15:54] people fell on their faces and I was
[2:15:55] just thinking as a little humble man
[2:15:58] came before a Pulpit at a
[2:16:01] challenge at a debate right and he stood
[2:16:04] before a little
[2:16:06] pulpit and if I could put it let's just
[2:16:08] go back to those days and the god that
[2:16:11] answers by fire amen right and before
[2:16:15] you the god of fire
[2:16:18] dropped in on the scene and hovered
[2:16:21] above that little Prophet there and
[2:16:23] man's image took a shot and there it
[2:16:26] sits in your Library of Congress
[2:16:28] protected by your government so no devil
[2:16:30] can even get in there and trying to tear
[2:16:32] it apart and cause it it's locked by
[2:16:33] your government it's the truth God
[2:16:36] answered by Pillar of Fire in this day
[2:16:39] as he did in Elijah's day to prove to
[2:16:41] you and to me this gospel is a
[2:16:44] Vindicated
[2:16:46] truth show me another God show me
[2:16:50] another bail that can do that there is
[2:16:52] no other God that picture that's not
[2:16:55] just a picture that's this day Showdown
[2:16:58] that's Mount Carmel right there young
[2:17:00] people don't you just look casually and
[2:17:03] say oh that's just a picture of the
[2:17:04] pillar of fire that's your God coming
[2:17:06] again showing himself alive today this
[2:17:09] word my word is
[2:17:11] [Applause]
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:17:14] true so then when Elijah came out and
[2:17:16] said something that didn't quite maybe
[2:17:18] understand they're like I don't know but
[2:17:20] God Vindicated him I don't quite
[2:17:22] understand that but God Vindicated him
[2:17:24] Lord show it to me reveal it to me but I
[2:17:26] believe it Lord you Vindicated
[2:17:31] him
[2:17:33] right and then he went on the attack and
[2:17:38] said go and kill every priest of Baal
[2:17:42] that's
[2:17:43] good exactly and you don't think that
[2:17:46] Elijah
[2:17:48] and those that are anointed with the
[2:17:50] eagle anointing of this day are
[2:17:52] commanded go and kill every demon of
[2:17:57] this age that combats the very God of
[2:18:00] this day that's your commission it's a
[2:18:03] battle for truth don't just stand there
[2:18:05] he said go kill all of
[2:18:09] them I don't care if it's a demon of
[2:18:11] Oppression I don't care if it's a demon
[2:18:12] of depression I don't care if it's a
[2:18:13] demon of pornography I don't care if
[2:18:15] it's a demon of movies I don't care if
[2:18:16] it's a demon of music I don't care if
[2:18:17] it's demon whatever it is kill
[2:18:20] it you've been given the word of this
[2:18:23] hour to kill it he didn't just arm you
[2:18:25] with nothing he didn't say go get it and
[2:18:26] you got nothing on you you got the sword
[2:18:28] of the word turn it about with truth you
[2:18:31] have the confidence to know my word is
[2:18:36] trueu and thus the battle was won and
[2:18:40] he's here to set you
[2:18:44] free right because because he said and
[2:18:48] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[2:18:52] shall set you
[2:18:57] free there's no need to have anybody in
[2:19:00] a
[2:19:02] congregation allowing the Devil to put a
[2:19:04] little foothold in your life or to pull
[2:19:06] the wool over anybody's eyes and even to
[2:19:09] think that well I am free but you know
[2:19:11] really actually deep down there's
[2:19:12] something he sent you a word so that you
[2:19:15] would be totally free no complex no fear
[2:19:20] no sickness truth strips Satan from
[2:19:23] death and Hell truth sent a word to this
[2:19:25] day to give you a promise to this that
[2:19:27] this body will be changed truth sent a
[2:19:30] word that created an
[2:19:32] expectation amen of what's to

[2:19:51] showdown so he said well Michael that

[2:20:13] what the congregation did do you believe
[2:20:15] you have spiritual discernment to know
[2:20:16] what that did it's the
[2:20:19] truth he says we don't have to come up
[2:20:22] here he says I'm not a Healer I'm a man
[2:20:25] I'm your brother Christ is your healer
[2:20:28] amen is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:20:31] today and forever amen so brother
[2:20:33] brandham is not your healer amen he says
[2:20:35] I'm a man am Christ is your healer amen
[2:20:39] if you can just recognize him to be here
[2:20:42] if you can just recognize him young
[2:20:44] people to be here right
[2:20:49] he says he's standing right here if he
[2:20:51] was standing right here with this suit
[2:20:52] on he couldn't heal you he's already
[2:20:55] done it he could only prove that he was
[2:20:58] Christ he says now what did he do when
[2:21:00] he was there he proved him that he was
[2:21:02] Messiah he showed Peter John Peter and
[2:21:04] Nathaniel all them by telling them who
[2:21:06] they were where they come from and what
[2:21:08] his signed to the Jews that was his
[2:21:10] closing of their age he said now there's
[2:21:13] another class of people that was
[2:21:14] Samaritans and he goes through that with
[2:21:16] a woman at the well he says now it did
[2:21:18] not go to the Gentiles did he for the
[2:21:20] Gentiles wasn't looking for him but I
[2:21:23] wrote there on the side of my notes but
[2:21:25] now is our
[2:21:28] time that wasn't our time then but now
[2:21:32] is the time of the Gentiles he says do

[2:21:36] it I'd say this morning do you believe
[2:21:39] he's here would you discern it amen he
[2:21:42] says I want to turn my back to the
[2:21:44] audience and I'll
[2:21:46] pray
[2:21:48] the Holy Ghost will prove what I've said
[2:21:51] tonight the closing of this message that
[2:21:53] the same signs that Jesus said was give
[2:21:55] to Sodom will be given to this
[2:21:56] generation then you discern what spirit
[2:21:59] is here you decide who God is God is God

[2:22:05] now is this true or is this false don't
[2:22:08] halt between two opinions I'm going to
[2:22:09] turn my back as he did as his back was
[2:22:12] to a tent there in Abraham's day and
[2:22:14] Sarah was in a tent I'm going to turn my
[2:22:15] back and I'm going to prove to you that
[2:22:18] this is
[2:22:21] truth there now with his back turned he
[2:22:24] said lady sitting over there the white
[2:22:25] thing on he says you have got a prayer
[2:22:27] card you sick are we strangers she
[2:22:29] didn't have a prayer card he says no God
[2:22:30] knows us both he says there's a light
[2:22:32] over the woman if you can see it
[2:22:34] circling right above her she was praying
[2:22:37] is that right no you have not got a
[2:22:39] chance see to come up here he goes you
[2:22:42] have not got a chance to come up but you
[2:22:43] are praying because I see just below
[2:22:46] that is is a dark shadow right here is
[2:22:50] now he's the angel of the pillar of fire
[2:22:52] now right hovering above this little
[2:22:54] lady and a prophet is standing with his
[2:22:57] back to her and he's saying there's a
[2:22:59] light above you and underneath that is a
[2:23:02] demon a dark shadow he said it's death
[2:23:04] that woman is shadowed with death she
[2:23:06] has cancer you believe God can heal you
[2:23:09] and I was just thinking how there is a
[2:23:10] demon Of Darkness but above that was the
[2:23:13] light and light can Darkness cannot
[2:23:15] overcome light there's she was under the
[2:23:17] influence and the presence of almighty
[2:23:19] God and there he was just waiting to
[2:23:21] confirm I am that same God that was
[2:23:24] there with Elijah I'm the same fire that
[2:23:27] consumed the sacrifice and death I don't
[2:23:29] care do you fear cancer it don't matter
[2:23:32] what the demon but my light is above it
[2:23:34] and I am going to conquer the darkness
[2:23:36] that is below me I'm going to put my
[2:23:38] foot on the enemy amen because that same
[2:23:41] light is here this morning that's living
[2:23:43] in you and living in me so place your
[2:23:45] foot on the enemy and say that's my
[2:23:54] God what's your need this
[2:23:57] morning if he was there in this day if
[2:23:59] God was here in this day is he here in
[2:24:01] this room this morning I'd say yes he is
[2:24:03] he said it's cancer of the breast I see
[2:24:05] a doctor looking at it and he tells you
[2:24:06] that it's going to try and operate he
[2:24:08] goes through all the details he said
[2:24:09] stand on your feet I wrote in my notes
[2:24:12] acknowledge that that was the god of
[2:24:14] Elijah acknowledge that's Jesus Christ
[2:24:17] from the scripture stand on your feet
[2:24:19] and prove to the world that what I said
[2:24:22] is
[2:24:27] true Time After Time After Time
[2:24:30] acknowledge stand on your feet
[2:24:31] acknowledge stand on your
[2:24:34] feet why did he do that so that you and
[2:24:37] I could have such trust in this gospel
[2:24:40] because I've placed my soul in it I've
[2:24:43] placed my whole life saying oh God I
[2:24:45] want to spend eternity with you I need
[2:24:47] to Anchor my soul somewhere I need to
[2:24:49] tie it on he said that's okay brother
[2:24:51] Michael I'm going to send you a message
[2:24:52] that you can anchor to and the world is
[2:24:55] going to have to acknowledge that it's
[2:24:58] [Applause]
[2:25:03] true can you discern that it's the same
[2:25:05] Jesus that touched the woman that
[2:25:07] touched His Garment I see a lady in a
[2:25:09] vision she's praying she's a young
[2:25:14] woman says there she is with a something
[2:25:17] about a
[2:25:19] baby she has to have a baby no he said
[2:25:23] it's a
[2:25:24] miscarriage it's what it's been he said
[2:25:27] it's a dead baby and she's from Kentucky
[2:25:30] and her name is Martin where are you Mrs
[2:25:33] Martin yes yellow dress that's true is
[2:25:36] it lady stand on your feet and say it so
[2:25:40] he said why did he have them standing
[2:25:41] their feet because what I just said so
[2:25:43] that everybody in this age could
[2:25:46] recognize that it was
[2:25:49] true and I just thought Lord you saw
[2:25:52] there as your presence was moving
[2:25:54] through the audience and your anointing
[2:25:56] was there and your you you were standing
[2:25:58] there with a prophet vindicating the
[2:25:59] word that you were coming behind to say
[2:26:02] this is where I'm identifying myself and
[2:26:04] God cared about a little lady who had an
[2:26:07] aching
[2:26:09] heart and any any sister here that's
[2:26:12] miscarried child and a daddy that's
[2:26:15] Stood Beside your wife that way the
[2:26:17] heart is broken and it's aching and
[2:26:20] there's so much turmoil in that moment
[2:26:23] but God the all caring one says I care
[2:26:27] you sister in the yellow dress you've
[2:26:29] just had a miscarriage God sees you he
[2:26:33] says look here there sits a little lady
[2:26:34] with a checkered looking dress she's got
[2:26:36] her head bowed
[2:26:39] now he says you're praying for a mother
[2:26:42] you got a prayer card you don't need one
[2:26:45] amen
[2:26:48] if I could have my Liberty and say you
[2:26:49] standing in brother bram's meetings you
[2:26:51] don't need
[2:26:57] to people put so much faith in a prayer
[2:26:59] card I need to get to the altar I need
[2:27:01] to get there before him says you don't
[2:27:03] need a prayer card he's here he can
[2:27:05] speak to you in your Pew say well I I
[2:27:08] wish I was there but Brandon's meetings
[2:27:09] I wish I was there right there when the
[2:27:11] anointing was there I say you don't need
[2:27:12] to because you said he's the same
[2:27:14] yesterday today and forever so if he is
[2:27:16] then he's here and he's doing the same
[2:27:18] things and can do the same things that
[2:27:20] he did there so then it's all actually
[2:27:22] on you and your faith and whether you
[2:27:24] can receive what he's saying to you this
[2:27:28] morning he says are you thinking you're
[2:27:30] praying for your mother are you thinking
[2:27:31] of bringing her to church tomorrow
[2:27:37] night he says you don't have to do it
[2:27:40] lay your hands on her and call on the
[2:27:42] name of Jesus and show it well if you'll
[2:27:46] believe it
[2:27:47] say well I got a wife at home that she
[2:27:49] needs to be healed I got a daughter at
[2:27:52] home or I got a son at home you go home
[2:27:55] you lay hands on her and scripture says
[2:27:58] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[2:28:02] recover he said I challenge your faith
[2:28:06] who else has not got a prayer card and
[2:28:08] wants to believe as a musicians come who
[2:28:11] else is not sitting in brother Brown's
[2:28:13] meeting and wants to believe who has a

[2:28:46] Direction he says I feel her pulling Mrs
[2:28:48] Wy or Miss Wy he says where's you at go

[2:29:01] telling the
[2:29:05] truth why don't we stand this
[2:29:07] morning he said take those hands that
[2:29:10] you're waving towards God and he said
[2:29:13] lay it on somebody next to you and
