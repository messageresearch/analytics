[0:12] Well, I know we're all excited to be
[0:14] gathered together tonight uh to hear
[0:16] Brother Ray's life story. And uh Ray
[0:20] Ericson is certainly somebody who needs
[0:22] no introduction to us.
[0:24] um we've we've uh known him and and
[0:29] grown under his ministry uh for for
[0:32] years and I think he's been pastoring
[0:35] over 40 years and um and so we just
[0:39] appreciate a life lived for the Lord and
[0:42] the fruit of it and I'm part of that
[0:44] fruit for sure. Um, I've always said
[0:48] that really everything good in my life
[0:52] traces back to
[0:54] uh grandpa and just the the decisions
[0:58] made to serve the Lord. I I always think
[1:01] about Abraham in the Bible, how that
[1:04] Abraham one day heard from the Lord when
[1:06] the Lord called his name there in the
[1:08] land
[1:09] of and and I think if he had not
[1:12] answered that call, you know, uh where
[1:16] would Isaac have been? Where would a
[1:18] Jacob have been? There wouldn't have
[1:19] been a Joseph. There would have never
[1:20] been an Israel. And so, um, that's
[1:24] that's how I feel that if if there
[1:26] hadn't been a Ray Ericson, uh, to answer
[1:29] the call of God and sell out for this
[1:32] message, there wouldn't be a Nathan
[1:34] Ericson, there wouldn't be a True Word
[1:35] Tabernacle, and we wouldn't be gathered
[1:37] here tonight. And, um, so we just
[1:40] appreciate him so much, love him so
[1:42] much. Um, how many love brother A?
[1:45] And uh uh grandpa's got a lot of famous
[1:48] sayings uh that are famous among us. And
[1:52] um one that he's always saying is when
[1:54] he'll be ministering sometimes he'll get
[1:56] off on a little story or something from
[1:58] his past or from his childhood. And uh
[2:02] and he always says, "Yeah, I know you
[2:04] wanted to hear
[2:07] that." And uh and the thing about it is
[2:09] we do we do want to hear it. We want to
[2:12] hear everything about it. And so, uh,
[2:14] we're so glad that that, uh, he'd set
[2:16] this side of time, this time aside with
[2:18] us and, um, share his life story and his
[2:21] testimony. And, um, I want to speak for
[2:24] the whole youth group, Grandpa, that
[2:25] nobody's in a hurry. And so, just take
[2:28] your time and relax and and we just want
[2:30] to hear everything that comes to mind.
[2:32] And we're just here to celebrate you and
[2:34] and uh, and and uh, appreciate you. And
[2:39] so we'll just turn it over uh to brother
[2:42] Ray here. Uh but we got a couple quotes
[2:45] that um he wanted me to play here. So
[2:48] hopefully everybody can hear
[2:50] it. This is from the message things that
[2:52] are to be. Your birth here was
[2:55] pre-planned. I guess you believe that.
[2:58] Every one of you knows that our birth
[3:00] was pre-planned. Did you know that your
[3:03] being here never originated just at a
[3:06] myth or a thought? Everything was all
[3:09] pre-planned by God before the foundation
[3:12] of the world.
[3:14] The infinite God know to be to be
[3:18] infinite. He had to know every flea that
[3:20] ever would be in the earth and how many
[3:22] times it would bat its eye. That's
[3:24] infinite. See you our little our little
[3:28] minds cannot fathom what infinite means.
[3:31] The infinite God. He know all things.
[3:34] Therefore, there's nothing out of
[3:36] caterer. Amen. A little ways down in the
[3:39] same message.
[3:43] You now you grew from your birth when
[3:47] you was born and presented into this
[3:50] world. God knew that you were going to
[3:53] be here in this earth and you grew from
[3:56] birth to maturity. things that seem so
[3:59] strange to you uh in your young
[4:02] womanhood, young boyhood as children now
[4:06] seems very real. You couldn't understand
[4:10] it when he was a child, but now as you
[4:12] become adult, you begin to understand
[4:15] and find out that everything was just
[4:17] set just right and you it really means
[4:19] something to you now. So is it in your
[4:22] spiritual birth? You do things that you
[4:25] don't understand. When you're a little
[4:27] baby come to the altar, you give your
[4:29] life to Christ. You do such strange
[4:31] things. You wonder why you did it. But
[4:33] after a while, when you mature as
[4:35] matured Christians, then you understand
[4:37] it. See, there's something picks up. You
[4:39] see why you had to do it. Your spiritual
[4:41] birth, your natural birth types, you're
[4:43] spiritual. how how it fitted to you in
[4:46] this life as you grew everything fitted
[4:48] right in because you were made for that.
[4:50] Wasn't it a strange thing the night that
[4:52] you staggered into the mission, the tent
[4:54] meeting or the little church somewhere
[4:56] on the corner and something a preacher
[4:58] preached on a certain subject and you
[4:59] just fell right at the altar. See, see
[5:03] God knew that before the foundation of
[5:05] the world. See you, it seems strange to
[5:07] you why you did it then, but now you
[5:09] understand. You knew what happened. It's
[5:13] so fitting to you and this life and will
[5:16] be also in the life that is to come.
[5:19] This world and this life seems to
[5:22] advance as you mature. Everything seems
[5:24] to go right with you.
[5:27] Amen.
[5:28] Go ahead. Amen. I wanted to uh play
[5:31] those
[5:32] quotes to understand that our lives are
[5:36] pre-planned. Every one of you here
[5:38] tonight, God's pre-planned your journey
[5:41] in life. And so I wanted us to hear them
[5:45] two quotes because in my testimony it'll
[5:51] give different situations where the Lord
[5:54] was brooding over me even though and you
[5:57] can say the same even though I didn't
[5:59] recognize until a certain season or
[6:01] certain timing. So I just wanted us to
[6:04] be aware of that in your own life. I
[6:08] only have a short scripture here I was
[6:10] thinking about and uh the reason I'm
[6:12] reading I'll probably relate it to it
[6:14] later in part of my testimony. Romans
[6:17] 8:31. If God be before us, who can be
[6:20] against us? And I'll just use that later
[6:23] on. Can we just pray together? Lord
[6:27] Jesus, I thank you, Father, for this
[6:31] opportunity to gather with these lovely
[6:34] young people in in this house of faith.
[6:37] Lord, and Father, we pray that we can
[6:41] say
[6:41] something that will
[6:44] edify your presence, Lord, and lift you
[6:47] up, Father, for what you've done, not
[6:50] only for me, but for these young people.
[6:53] Father, we love you with all our hearts.
[6:56] We pray you'll inspire this Lord and and
[6:59] Lord let it be a reality to someone
[7:02] tonight Lord that it'll speak to their
[7:05] hearts in the name of Jesus. Amen.
[7:09] I want to ask or thank Nathan for asking
[7:12] me to give this and of course a couple
[7:14] of you young people that approached me
[7:16] as well. Uh so I appreciate that and so
[7:20] we just love you as uh you're just such
[7:22] an example of this message already
[7:25] yourselves to see the quality of
[7:29] character that you have. So I'll try
[7:33] and keep this in order and if I don't
[7:35] maybe if I think of something I'll have
[7:37] to go way back but I'll try. Uh I was
[7:40] born uh December 9th 1938.
[7:45] My parents' name was Robert Lydia
[7:47] Ericson. I was actually born not in a
[7:50] hospital. I was born on in a house on
[7:53] the farm. And uh my parent
[7:58] 1938. So I was born during the Second
[8:01] World War. I don't know how many of you
[8:04] got history here in your mind, but the
[8:06] second world war was from 1939 to
[8:11] 1945.
[8:12] also at an and I know history says it
[8:17] was the worst catastrophe in human
[8:22] humanism or human life. And of course
[8:25] they forgot to go all the way back to
[8:27] the dark ages when we lost 68 million
[8:30] amen of our brothers and sisters. But at
[8:34] the very same time,
[8:37] 1929, 1941 was the Great Depression. And
[8:42] it was a terrible, the stock market
[8:44] broke, banks went
[8:48] bankrupt, people if they didn't act
[8:51] quickly to get their money out of the
[8:52] bank, they lost all that they had. Well,
[8:56] my dad and my mom was trying to farm at
[9:00] that time. So, it was very difficult.
[9:04] We, you know, I as a
[9:08] child, I don't ever rem I remember one
[9:11] time going to a restaurant. And I'm not
[9:13] saying it was in other times, but it
[9:15] wasn't like today, you know, you had
[9:16] fast food places and things. But one
[9:20] thing about it that say for instance,
[9:23] like my mother,
[9:26] uh we uh as farmers, we had, you know,
[9:30] my dad raised chickens. He raised
[9:32] different animals. And so the chicken
[9:35] feed that he bought, uh maybe some of
[9:37] you have heard me say this before, but
[9:39] it was in a printed sack. In other
[9:42] words, had different colors. It had
[9:43] flowers on so on. That's what my mother
[9:46] used to sew her dresses. She did not go
[9:48] out and buy a dress. They couldn't
[9:50] afford it. They couldn't afford the
[9:51] money. Another thing is every year. And
[9:55] when my brother see and I I I'm probably
[9:58] going to miss a lot, but I had a brother
[9:59] also seven years older than myself. But
[10:02] when it came to school time in the fall,
[10:05] my dad in that little community, uh even
[10:09] though I raised on the farm, the little
[10:11] town four miles away was only about a
[10:13] thousand people. It was very small. It
[10:15] was a village more or less. So when it
[10:18] came time to for school each year, my
[10:22] dad would take I don't know how many
[10:24] dozen eggs, I don't know how many
[10:26] chickens, and we'd drive 75 miles to St.
[10:30] Minneapolis and St. Paul, which St. Paul
[10:32] was the capital. And uh he would sell
[10:35] those things in the city to get enough
[10:38] money so he could take us to and I still
[10:41] remember the Jewish store. It was called
[10:43] Copan Brothers. and uh there's where he
[10:47] would buy our clothes for school, our
[10:49] shoes, whatever was needed for that
[10:52] year. So, it wasn't like they had an
[10:55] abundance of money there. I don't I
[10:57] don't ever remember my dad having a
[10:59] credit card. I don't even know if there
[11:00] was credit cards back there or not. If
[11:03] he was going to buy something, he tried
[11:04] to save the money. So, it was a very uh
[11:08] difficult time.
[11:10] I spent my first
[11:14] uh grade 1 through eight in a little two
[11:17] room country school and uh quite of the
[11:21] few of the people walked to it but you
[11:24] know I moaned and groaned a
[11:26] lot. So, uh, my dad would graciously
[11:30] take me and I walked, we walked, I pick,
[11:33] I'd go down to and the neighbor was
[11:35] about half a mile away and then he'd
[11:37] join me and then when somebody else
[11:39] would join. So, we walked about a mile
[11:41] and a half to school and a mile and a
[11:43] half back. So and then
[11:48] uh they made a uh declaration at that
[11:52] time that when it come to grade nine you
[11:56] had to go transfer into the city school
[11:59] system. So I I I transferred into that
[12:03] system and uh I
[12:07] uh I I I was about in that age group uh
[12:12] right at that time when the polio
[12:15] epidemic broke out. I can't remember how
[12:17] old I was. My parents it it was a
[12:20] terrible outbreak and it it was a scary
[12:22] time just like we went through co you
[12:25] know it was a scary time because so many
[12:27] people ended up in iron lungs. They
[12:30] never they never came out of it. That's
[12:32] how they lived. They just let them live
[12:34] in iron law. How many has ever heard
[12:35] about iron lung? Amen. And study. So
[12:38] that's the way it was. And at that very
[12:40] time, I don't know what I was maybe a
[12:42] freshman, high school, sophomore. Uh and
[12:46] incidentally, there was always a state
[12:48] fair in Minneapolis. And my dad and mom
[12:50] would take us there once in a while, but
[12:52] because of the epidemic, they said
[12:54] there's no way nor are we going. At that
[12:56] very time, I got sick and the fear came
[13:00] upon me because I thought maybe I was
[13:03] going to get polio, but the Lord watched
[13:05] over me. It was just a flu and it went
[13:09] away. I I played a couple sports. I
[13:13] played basketball and base. Is this all
[13:15] right if I share a lot of Yeah, we want
[13:16] to know. You know, raise your hand if
[13:19] you get tired of
[13:21] it. But anyway, uh I played a little
[13:24] basketball and baseball. I never was
[13:26] good at it, but uh you know uh uh my dad
[13:29] was graciously to take me in for
[13:32] practice and allow me to do it. But you
[13:34] know, we also worked on the farm. My
[13:36] brother and I, we that's we learned a
[13:39] lot of work ethic. We you know that's
[13:42] what I appreciate about growing up in
[13:44] the farm. There was a lot of work ethic
[13:47] ethics that was given to us and it
[13:50] helped us to to understand a little bit
[13:54] about it. I remember
[13:57] instance, I was small at that time, but
[14:00] you know, they they used to have instead
[14:02] of farmers having combines, they had
[14:05] what they call thrash machines or corn
[14:08] pickers and things like that. And uh I
[14:11] don't know, we had a front door the the
[14:13] latch wouldn't work right. And so, uh,
[14:16] my my dad and my brother and whoever
[14:19] maybe the neighbors were out there
[14:20] thrashing, uh, oats and, uh, my mom took
[14:25] lunch out and I don't know if she forgot
[14:27] something. So, I'm I'm I'm real small.
[14:30] So, she sends me back to the house to to
[14:33] get something. And when I came to go out
[14:37] of the door, the door latch wouldn't
[14:39] work. And I panicked. I actually
[14:42] panicked. So there was a big, not a huge
[14:45] window as that, but about half of that.
[14:47] And so I took something and broke the
[14:49] glass out and crawled through the
[14:52] window and I survived. As you see, I'm
[14:56] here. I didn't cut my throat or, you
[14:59] know, my veins or anything like that.
[15:01] Boy, I don't know. And I don't even
[15:03] remember getting a
[15:06] spanking, you know, and so that's why I
[15:09] turned out spoiled.
[15:12] That's so what happened. And so,
[15:15] uh, let me see if I I put this writing
[15:18] so close together, but anyway, uh, you
[15:22] know, I had, uh, right in my youth, I
[15:24] had, uh, and you, I gave one of these
[15:26] testimonies at the church not too long
[15:28] ago, but just to show how the Lord was
[15:30] keeping us, and that's why I played
[15:32] those quotes and so on, is that uh, one
[15:36] time, and I, this is a repeat of what I
[15:38] did at the church, if that's okay, but
[15:41] I,
[15:42] uh, my brother was 7 years older as I
[15:45] said and my cousins most of them were
[15:47] older than myself. I had one cousin. She
[15:50] was a girl uh
[15:53] uh close closer to me, but uh uh they
[15:58] lived across the road at another farm.
[16:00] And so they, you know, our us cousins
[16:02] would get together every once in a
[16:05] while. And so they came down to my dad's
[16:07] h to our place. And uh it became evening
[16:11] and it was in the summertime. And uh my
[16:14] dad had strung a bobwire fence around to
[16:16] keep the cattle in. And uh the boys and
[16:20] and my brother and the boys, they
[16:21] decided they saw fireflies. So why don't
[16:24] we start chasing fireflies. So I'm about
[16:27] the height of the fence right here.
[16:30] Right at the height of fence. So they
[16:32] run and run for they saw some go like
[16:34] that. So I just barrel ahead of them and
[16:37] right here I hit my neck in the bob
[16:40] wire. Well, my aunt was there and my
[16:43] uncle, my aunt for sure, she was a
[16:46] nurse. And so they carried me into the
[16:49] house and she took one look and she she
[16:51] said, "My got to get to the hospital."
[16:54] And when they examined it, it was a
[16:56] quarter of an inch from my juggler vein.
[16:59] If it had been another quarter of inch,
[17:00] I'd have bled to death and I wouldn't be
[17:02] here today. There was another instance
[17:07] uh you know
[17:09] uh my dad I was thinking of this today.
[17:13] Uh the first car I remember was a 1931
[17:16] Chevrolet and it had a soft top. It
[17:20] wasn't even a hard top. So I remember
[17:22] riding in the back of that. I'm sure you
[17:25] know it was had some age on it by the
[17:27] time my dad got it too. But every time
[17:30] it rained, you had a duck because the
[17:32] rain was coming through. And uh then we
[17:35] graduated to a 37 Chevrolet, which we
[17:39] really thought we were probably probably
[17:41] he thought, you know, we we've come up
[17:43] in this world. And uh it was that
[17:47] vehicle that I remember. But my dad and
[17:50] my brother had picked corn and uh and uh
[17:55] my dad it was time for milking the cows.
[17:57] My dad's milking the cows. So my brother
[17:59] said to my dad is I said I I think I'm
[18:01] going to take the car and go out the and
[18:03] get the corn load. And so uh my brother
[18:06] was very good to me. I mean he he just
[18:09] you know he would play with me even
[18:10] though he was older. He treated me so
[18:12] wonderfully and and then later on when I
[18:14] got a temper we didn't get along so
[18:16] good.
[18:18] And uh so the thing of it is is that
[18:21] when he went out and and and of course a
[18:24] lot of people know today about running
[18:25] boards on vehicles, but back in those
[18:27] days I don't think they were too
[18:29] popular. But this vehicle had a running
[18:32] board. And so he was going to back up to
[18:34] the load of
[18:37] corn and uh I'm thinking I'm a big guy
[18:40] even though I'm a little guy. So I get
[18:42] out. I get out open the door like this
[18:44] and I don't face the corn load. I face
[18:47] like this and like you know I'm going to
[18:49] direct him and and all of a sudden I
[18:53] felt something hit. He got too close to
[18:56] to a pole and on the road or or the
[19:00] fence and broke my wrist right off. Just
[19:03] broke my wrist real bad. So that was
[19:06] another instance where the Lord
[19:08] protected me because if he if I would
[19:10] have hit a little different against that
[19:12] bull could have crushed me to death. So
[19:14] you understand now our lives are
[19:16] pre-planned.
[19:18] There's no mishap to a believer even
[19:20] though we go through many difficult
[19:23] times. My father and mother went to a
[19:26] Lutheran
[19:28] church and uh they had what they call
[19:31] catechism and I just have to kind of
[19:34] read the definition of it. It it's
[19:36] telling about attending the Lutheran
[19:39] church. They had what they call
[19:41] catechism. It was a summary of the
[19:44] principles of Christian religion in the
[19:48] form of questions and answers used for
[19:51] the instructions of Christians. Well,
[19:53] you know, my brother at his age, they
[19:56] made you go two years for that
[19:58] instruction. By the time I got old
[20:00] enough, it was only one year. But here's
[20:04] the situation about it. When it came to
[20:07] the end of the year, then you had to go
[20:09] to the in front of the pastor and in the
[20:11] front of the congregation and uh they
[20:15] asked you questions. Of course, they
[20:16] gave you the answer pretty much
[20:18] beforehand. But here's what I want to
[20:20] get to. for no known reason. I mean,
[20:22] it's just you're talk about formalism
[20:24] and and and dry as could be. But
[20:28] uh during that ceremony, I just broke
[20:32] down and started weeping. And there was
[20:34] no reason for it. I mean, there was no
[20:36] reason for it. But I'm just going to say
[20:38] I believe he was brooding over me. He
[20:41] was brooding over me at that time. In
[20:43] fact, on the way home, my parents were
[20:45] wondering what happened to you. I mean,
[20:47] what what was this? I couldn't explain
[20:48] it. All I know now I can look back. It
[20:51] was the presence of the Lord coming over
[20:54] me. And I I didn't know how to yield at
[20:57] that time. So, you know, I'm in high
[21:00] school and uh you know, and uh sorry to
[21:05] say, I didn't very do very good. And uh
[21:08] uh but uh it was at a uh football game
[21:14] in a in a neighboring town. And uh this
[21:18] is where I met my met my wife today,
[21:21] Ruth. And uh of course we were both
[21:24] young. I mean we she was young. She's
[21:26] three years younger than I was. So I'm
[21:28] in high school. She's down here, you
[21:30] know. And so so I mean we just met, you
[21:32] know, we never, you know, started going
[21:35] steady, what they call steady. I I just
[21:39] maybe look her up once in a while, you
[21:40] know.
[21:43] And uh but we really didn't uh we really
[21:46] didn't even uh well I'm going to get
[21:48] ahead of myself here. And in and in uh
[21:51] in high school, you know, at that time
[21:53] they had a two-year draft for the
[21:56] army. And
[21:58] uh uh I think I as I look back on it, I
[22:02] look I see it very peculiar. um a a a a
[22:07] little town, a farming community of
[22:08] 1,000 people. And the army decided to
[22:13] build well they used an old building at
[22:15] that time. They built a new building
[22:17] later on, but they they rented a
[22:20] building downtown Winthre. That was the
[22:22] name of the town. And they were going to
[22:24] have an army reserve unit in that little
[22:26] town. Well, you know, we started
[22:29] talking. My brother got drafted during
[22:31] the Korean War. And uh that's another
[22:35] thing is I've just just coming to my
[22:37] mind now. I'm probably going teeter
[22:40] totter around a little bit, but but my
[22:42] brother when he was drafted, I knew my
[22:44] life was so terrible and uh you know,
[22:47] and just uh you know, and I thought to
[22:49] myself, my this is serious. This is a
[22:52] Korean war going on. Uh you know, and
[22:55] the thing of it is is that I said, "Oh
[22:58] my, I got to get my life better than
[23:00] this. I got to get. But here's what I
[23:02] want to tell you. You can try all you
[23:04] want to, but it don't work. It isn't
[23:08] until he summons you and he beckons at
[23:11] your heart that something will happen.
[23:14] So no matter how our works try to do it.
[23:17] But
[23:18] anyway, I decided I'm sure my, you know,
[23:21] talking to my parents, talking to my
[23:23] brother, I didn't really want to be gone
[23:26] two years, waste two years of my life.
[23:29] So I decided to join the Army Reserve.
[23:33] Well, when 1957 came, that's my
[23:37] graduation year. So in May, in May, I
[23:43] already started in the senior year. So
[23:46] in May I graduate, in July I'm already
[23:49] going to the army. So, here I am, you
[23:53] know, I, you know, this is I'm I'm
[23:55] young, you know, and, uh, well, you
[23:58] know, I remember going to a Bible
[23:59] school, uh, Bible camp one time. I got
[24:02] so homesick, you know, they had to come
[24:03] and get me. So, but, you know, nobody's
[24:05] going to come and get you at the army
[24:07] camp. You know, you can cry all you want
[24:09] to. You know, they're your daddy and
[24:11] your mama and and whether you like it or
[24:14] not. So uh so you know here I'm on my
[24:17] way in July and uh so you what we were
[24:21] supposed to do is have six months of
[24:23] active duty. Then you had three and a
[24:25] half years of active reserve. They could
[24:27] call you anytime they wanted to. You had
[24:29] two weeks every summer and then I I
[24:31] forget how many years of inactive
[24:33] reserve you had which if there was a
[24:36] dire need they'd have to be quite
[24:38] critical they could pull you in. But by
[24:40] the grace of God that unit never got
[24:42] pulled in. Later on, they got that unit
[24:45] got pulled into Vietnam, but I was
[24:47] already out. So, that's just something
[24:50] how the Lord watched over each one of
[24:54] us, you know, you and I, uh, both. Now,
[25:00] uh, I just want to say something here.
[25:03] Uh, my
[25:06] mom, for some reason, I don't know, she
[25:08] always wanted me to be something besides
[25:10] a farmer. My brother love farming and uh
[25:14] she's just Rey, I want you to be
[25:16] something. I want you to have something.
[25:19] I believe if she could look over the
[25:20] portals of heaven today, she'd be quite
[25:24] happy to see what happened. So, you
[25:28] know, after I got out of the
[25:31] army, I decided, okay, uh I applied at
[25:35] Manetto State College and uh I had Army
[25:39] reserve about the time that they were
[25:41] calling you in for an interview. So, I I
[25:44] just got a hold of them. I said, "Hey,
[25:45] you know, I've got to go two weeks
[25:47] training. I can't make that interview."
[25:49] I have a feeling if I had made the
[25:51] interview, they' have told me to stay
[25:52] home.
[25:54] But I decided just in mainly behalf of
[25:58] my mother's mind and thoughts, I'm going
[26:01] to try it. So I only went a year and I I
[26:04] just, you know, I hate to say it, but I
[26:05] didn't make the grade. But, you know,
[26:08] uh, one one scripture I've always
[26:10] identified with like the disciples, they
[26:12] were ignorant and
[26:15] unlearned. So, you know, if you find
[26:18] your place in the scripture, you got it
[26:19] made.
[26:24] Yeah. So, in let me see here my notes.
[26:28] Uh
[26:31] 1958 then uh I got actually I didn't get
[26:35] a a leave after basic training. You're
[26:37] supposed after 8 weeks basic training
[26:39] supposed to get a leave. Some reason my
[26:41] orders got messed up. Here's another
[26:43] thing is too like
[26:45] uh it it's quite something basic
[26:48] training just about the whole barracks
[26:51] the whole company they all got orders to
[26:53] go I was one of the few that didn't get
[26:56] any orders they also wouldn't let me go
[26:58] home so I'm sitting at the barracks of
[27:00] just a few of us left and so uh they had
[27:03] what they call MOS that was your
[27:05] military occupational
[27:07] uh so I think one of them was I I would
[27:12] possibly be in the armor division or and
[27:15] the other one of all things was I think
[27:18] I remember even the number of the MOS I
[27:20] think it was
[27:23] 7-Eleven pretty good at 86 e 71 clerk
[27:28] typist of all things well I didn't even
[27:31] do that well in in high school on typing
[27:34] you know but sure
[27:35] enough I got shipped to Fort Sheridan
[27:39] Illinois and it was at Navy Pierce at
[27:42] that time, Fort Sheridan, Illinois. I
[27:44] don't know why the army units got sent
[27:47] there. I wasn't very long there and they
[27:50] they deactivated the place and so
[27:53] outside of Chicago was a fort called
[27:55] Fort Sheridan. Beautiful place. My if I
[27:59] would have been in the army two years
[28:00] and could have spent that there wouldn't
[28:02] have been too bad at all. But it was a
[28:04] lovely place. But then because I didn't
[28:07] get uh so July so by December I should
[28:10] have been out I had my six months
[28:13] uh but because I didn't get a leave they
[28:16] let me out a little early so I went home
[28:18] but then that very summer of 1958
[28:22] uh my mom I remember what I remember
[28:26] about mom I had just such beautiful
[28:28] parents but I always remember about my
[28:30] mom being always so sick just always one
[28:33] thing after another sick sick. Well,
[28:35] then she got a bad heart condition. And
[28:38] uh my brother, I didn't even find this
[28:40] out till many years later. He felt like
[28:42] the doctor gave her the wrong medication
[28:44] because I I was working nights at a
[28:48] Green Giant factory uh company and uh I
[28:53] went home to sleep during the day and
[28:55] all of a sudden I had a tap on my
[28:56] shoulder and my brother said, "Ray,
[28:59] mom's gone. She's gone." So that shook
[29:03] my life. that really shook my life
[29:06] because it was just something you know
[29:09] I'm just getting home from the army not
[29:11] for long and then this happens and uh so
[29:14] it it it it really shook me but even at
[29:16] that time I I believe there was and I
[29:19] believe it to this day uh in the funeral
[29:21] home I remember telling my dad even as a
[29:24] young man I said dad I believe we'll see
[29:26] her again so that's something that still
[29:29] would register today of course they
[29:32] didn't believe this message never came
[29:34] to them. So, you know, you might say,
[29:36] "Well, how do you know I'd like to just
[29:38] feel it in my heart that everything was
[29:40] well with my dad and mom, you know, they
[29:43] lived like Lutheran kind of my mom, my
[29:45] dad especially, you know, uh he didn't
[29:48] he didn't see no I mean, I don't think I
[29:50] ever heard a curse word from him, but he
[29:53] never saw anything too bad about
[29:55] drinking a beer or something like that,
[29:57] you know, but but the parents were so
[30:00] lovely. They just raised me in that
[30:02] church the best they could. Prayed, you
[30:04] know, taught us taught us to pray over
[30:07] our meals, pray at at nighttime. So, you
[30:11] know, the the guidance was there, you
[30:14] know, to help me.
[30:16] So in uh that was in 1958 and then uh
[30:21] went to college and then at about uh let
[30:24] me see I try to figure this out here and
[30:27] and then later on uh uh you know uh Ruth
[30:30] and I started dating uh and and she was
[30:33] uh uh I suppose she was about last part
[30:37] of the junior of high school or
[30:38] something and we dated to the senior
[30:40] year and uh so at the uh at the end by
[30:45] the time she graduated. Uh, you know, we
[30:48] had decided we were men for each other.
[30:51] And so I went to her her dad and I said,
[30:54] you know, uh, Mr. Johnson, uh, I'd like
[30:57] to marry your daughter and we'd like to
[30:59] get married right away. And he looked
[31:01] one he took one look at me. He said, you
[31:02] ain't get married right away. He said,
[31:05] you're going to have to wait until fall.
[31:06] So we waited till September
[31:09] 1961. Then we got married. And, uh, it's
[31:13] 63 years.
[31:15] 63 years together. That that's the grace
[31:19] of God. We
[31:21] uh and of course down to the years uh uh
[31:28] you know it it I just sorry I it took
[31:33] three years before we could have a
[31:34] child. Three years before we could have
[31:36] a child. And so uh I I had I had Ruth
[31:40] write these down because I can't
[31:42] remember. But each was born 1964, Brian
[31:45] 1965, Mary 1967, Matthew 1970, Benjamin
[31:51] in 78, and Martha in 82. So you know,
[31:55] three of them were born in Minnesota.
[31:56] Matthew was born in Arizona. Benjamin
[31:59] was born in Jerusalem in Israel,
[32:02] Jerusalem area. And Martha was born in
[32:04] Bluffroom, Ohio, where the church is.
[32:07] And now we got 19 grandchildren. And uh
[32:11] I had to have Ruth to figure this out,
[32:12] too. We got 11 great grams already. Wow.
[32:16] Keep them
[32:18] coming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, we we
[32:21] we've been blessed. Uh let me see
[32:26] here. I can just then then as time went
[32:31] on, and I'll have to try and figure out
[32:33] these years. Uh you know, we went to
[32:37] church off and on. Uh I wasn't a Bible
[32:41] reader really, you know, uh the Bible
[32:43] sat on the
[32:44] shelf and uh but we went, you know, she
[32:49] was raised in her neighboring town. She
[32:51] went to what they call a congregational
[32:53] church. Then of course when we got
[32:54] married, we went to my church was with a
[32:57] Lutheran church. The Lutheran minister
[32:59] was a wonderful man. Uh you know, I take
[33:02] a look back. I mean, he was a very
[33:04] regimental in the Lutheran system. And
[33:07] looking back at it, uh, and there again,
[33:10] I believe was a seed in me, uh,
[33:12] recognizing maybe something that I
[33:14] really didn't recognize, but I remember
[33:16] his nephew being a missionary. And, uh,
[33:18] he came and and Dr. uh, uh, Pastor Ang
[33:22] Wall was just like, you know, uh, 15 or
[33:25] 20 minute sermon. It was all cut and
[33:27] dried, no move of the spirit. Only thing
[33:30] I remember about my mom, she was the
[33:33] loudest singer in the church. And you
[33:35] know, and so I kind of squirmed a little
[33:38] bit, you know, and wow, mom. Yeah. I
[33:40] never told him about,
[33:42] but I mean, you don't have to carry the
[33:44] whole
[33:46] tune, but I remember his nephew coming
[33:50] off the field and my when he preached, I
[33:54] mean, he was weeping in the pulpit. He
[33:56] was I mean I look back at it now and I
[33:59] can I could call it there was a man that
[34:01] was anointed
[34:03] to preach what he had what he had in his
[34:06] heart and compared to to Mr. Ang Pastor
[34:10] Angwell. So and and and and so time went
[34:13] on and u you know I I'll I'll sure
[34:17] enough miss a lot of highlights here I'm
[34:19] afraid of. But uh the thing of it is is
[34:21] that my brother and his wife got married
[34:23] and uh uh and they started having a
[34:27] family. So what happened when we got
[34:30] married? Uh I don't want to miss this.
[34:34] Uh when we got married, uh after I left
[34:37] college and and so on and got married
[34:40] and uh my dad actually he owed money on
[34:44] the farm. It was 160 acres. He owed
[34:48] money on it yet, but he said, "Ray, I'm
[34:51] going to let you just take over the the
[34:52] payments. Just take not not what
[34:55] probably it's worth. I'll just have you
[34:57] think." Now, that was unreal. Now, I'
[34:59] I've got a brother also seven years
[35:01] older, but the thing of it is my brother
[35:03] was a tremendous farmer and he he
[35:06] already had been renting our uncle's
[35:09] farm and did a great job. Well, then a
[35:12] farm down the road became available.
[35:16] Well, at that time the land wasn't worth
[35:19] what it is today. I just saw I I just
[35:21] saw something on my phone in Iowa just
[35:24] lately. It sold for
[35:26] $17,000 and I think it one just the
[35:28] other day $23,000 an acre. Well, back in
[35:31] those days it was $100 an acre, $200 an
[35:35] acre and and my brother paid a high
[35:38] price that really wasn't. It was like
[35:40] $300 an acre. Well, he had rented that
[35:42] farm and made really great.
[35:45] So the minute he bought it, things just
[35:49] didn't go right, weather conditions and
[35:51] so on. So what happened, my dad then a
[35:54] farm, Kitty Corner from from where he
[35:57] left Ruth and I by the farm, there was
[36:00] another farm came available and there
[36:02] was 200 acres. So here we are. We're
[36:05] putting we're putting where we're
[36:07] farming in those days. It's pretty
[36:09] unreal with the little machinery we had
[36:12] and farming 560 acres with the same
[36:16] machinery and trying to do all of that.
[36:18] We didn't have all the herbicides and
[36:20] insecticides. They started coming after
[36:23] we were farming for a while. I'm trying
[36:25] to get to something if you just give me
[36:27] a chance here.
[36:29] So, in the meantime, my sister-in-law
[36:33] got a real bad heart condition after I
[36:35] think the first or second child,
[36:38] something like that. So, in the
[36:41] meantime, it's kind of a a kind of a odd
[36:46] setup, but uh my cousin in California
[36:52] uh married a lady that had been married
[36:55] before. And so
[36:58] uh when she when they got married, so
[37:01] then uh we after my mom had passed, my
[37:05] brother and I and my dad, we went to
[37:07] visit California and visit them. And so
[37:11] uh through that, not through the
[37:13] marriage of my cousin to that, but that
[37:15] lady already had a daughter and a son.
[37:18] Well, that daughter then eventually
[37:21] became my brother's wife.
[37:24] So the thing of it is there was no
[37:26] relationship there. Remember it was it
[37:28] was she had been married to another man.
[37:31] So in and my sister-in-law got a bad
[37:33] heart condition. Well, in the
[37:36] meantime, that family comes into the
[37:38] message in California. Then a couple
[37:42] brothers, I don't know if they'd heard
[37:44] the what was going on and and and with
[37:46] my brother's wife and so on, but they
[37:49] came they came and of course I don't
[37:52] know what was all said. So the thing of
[37:54] it is that they came to the farm and uh
[37:58] they prayed for my sister-in-law. She
[38:02] was instantly healed. She had been going
[38:04] to the doctors and spending money on
[38:06] medicine that they didn't have the money
[38:08] probably to do. But the Lord healed her
[38:10] instantly.
[38:12] And so their eyes became open that this
[38:16] Bible is a living word. It's not
[38:20] tradition. It's not because it's
[38:22] Lutheran or Methodist or Catholic. It's
[38:25] a living word of God. Amen. In life. And
[38:29] so that began to really be
[38:33] something. And speaking of that, I'm
[38:37] going to back up a little bit again as I
[38:38] remember these things if you just allow
[38:40] me. But my cousin marrying that lady and
[38:43] then that her daughter becoming a
[38:46] believer and marrying my daughter. Well,
[38:48] the same thing sort of happened with my
[38:50] father uh like my my father right around
[38:55] you know we were married Ruth and I were
[38:56] married 61. Right around in a little
[38:59] later on time, he my father met a a lady
[39:03] that worked for the county, I believe.
[39:07] She was a kind of high up on the county
[39:09] uh offices. And she was far different
[39:13] than my mother. She was a smoker. She
[39:15] was a drinker. I don't know what my dad,
[39:17] he must have got so lonely or what.
[39:20] Well, you know, I just really got a bad
[39:23] attitude. I mean, I wasn't converted at
[39:25] that time and really bad. And my dad, my
[39:28] brother tried to talk to my dad, tried
[39:30] to talk him out of it and uh things.
[39:33] Well, of all things, of all things, she
[39:37] has a daughter, too, in a in a previous
[39:40] marriage. Okay. Her name is
[39:44] Patty. So, uh I'm going to have you
[39:47] scrambled up a little bit, okay? But
[39:49] I'll try let the Lord the Holy Spirit
[39:51] speak. But anyway, uh on I'll I'll tell
[39:54] you the rest of that down the road here
[39:56] in my testimony. But anyway,
[39:59] uh so
[40:02] uh I began to see my brother and his
[40:05] wife leave the Cath Lutheran church and
[40:07] they start going to Bible study in some
[40:09] other city. And I'm thinking, what in
[40:11] the world? You know, I don't understand.
[40:13] My dad, he's a pretty stoned Lutheran.
[40:15] And uh so the thing of it is is that uh
[40:19] I thought uh I just told Ruth one day I
[40:22] I said I think they've gone
[40:24] wacko. I think they're going whack. And
[40:27] Ruth now here's a predestination I
[40:29] believe election in her. She looked at
[40:31] me. She said Ray you probably better
[40:32] watch what you're
[40:34] saying. So the thing of it is like I say
[40:37] we're farming together. How much time
[40:40] have I got? All night. All night.
[40:44] Well, we won't go until somebody falls
[40:46] over now like it did.
[40:50] So, the the the the thing of it is is
[40:52] that uh uh we were working uh I was
[40:57] working over at my brother's farm that
[40:59] particular day and uh we were out in the
[41:02] morning and then the rain started coming
[41:04] down so we had to go quit and so then
[41:07] you know it's time to go in the house,
[41:08] have a cup of coffee and a donut or
[41:10] something. So my at that time they never
[41:13] said a word to me and I don't know how
[41:14] many months this went
[41:16] on. So all of a sudden Patty says to to
[41:20] my brother Quinton, "Uh, aren't you ever
[41:23] going to talk to Ray?" That's kind of
[41:25] the words he just said. So of all
[41:28] things, he leaves the kitchen and he
[41:29] goes in the other room, gets his
[41:31] Bible. So he goes in and he starts
[41:35] reading scripture to me. And I don't
[41:38] know how long this went on, but down
[41:41] inside I'm thinking, I'm not ready to
[41:44] meet this God that he's talking about.
[41:47] I'm not ready to meet him. So, at the
[41:51] same time, it went on for I don't I
[41:53] don't know how long. Then he hands me a
[41:55] booklet and I'm thinking, "What in the
[41:58] world is this?" And it was a message of
[42:00] Brother Brandham, but I didn't know
[42:02] nothing, you know? I didn't. But he
[42:04] hands the booklet to me. I go home that
[42:07] night. I do my chores. I go in the house
[42:10] and I don't know what it is if I was
[42:13] afraid to read it in front of my wife or
[42:15] what. So, I took the Bible. I know this
[42:17] sounds pretty crazy, but you've heard me
[42:18] give it a testimony before some of you.
[42:20] I took my Bible, went into the
[42:23] bathroom and I opened the Bible up and
[42:26] it was some place in Matthew. I can't
[42:28] remember the scripture anymore. But as I
[42:30] was reading that scripture, a presence
[42:33] came all over me that I had never
[42:37] witnessed that powerful a script
[42:39] presence. And I broke down and I started
[42:42] weeping. The reason this is going to be
[42:44] fresh to me now tonight is because of
[42:48] somebody coming to my house
[42:50] yesterday and had the same experience
[42:52] like and I and that's why it's so fresh
[42:56] to me. I broke down and started weeping.
[42:59] I said, "Jesus, I know who you died for
[43:02] now. You died for
[43:05] me." And a weight lifted off of me.
[43:10] People of weight lifted
[43:16] totally. And from that day on, my life
[43:20] changed. I went to my brothers and
[43:23] sisters farm the next morning. They took
[43:26] a look one look at my continents and
[43:29] knew something had happened to
[43:32] me. My brothers and sisters, that was
[43:35] the
[43:36] start of my Christian walk. I'm
[43:40] sorry, but it's so real to me
[43:43] today. That was the start of a
[43:48] justification in my life.
[43:51] In the
[43:54] meantime, see if I can get the ears
[43:56] right
[43:59] here. In the meantime, I think it
[44:05] was August of
[44:08] 19 Yes. August of
[44:11] 1967, my brother and his family moved to
[44:14] Tucson to be under Brother Perry Green's
[44:17] ministry. How many has heard of Brother
[44:19] Perry Green? Mhm.
[44:22] ministry. So, they had moved. In the
[44:25] meantime, my brother still had a a fall
[44:28] crop to
[44:30] harvest. And uh so he had to come back
[44:35] and so he brought somebody back by the
[44:37] name of brother Milton David Linhardt.
[44:40] He was actually a former Lutheran pastor
[44:43] before he came to the
[44:45] message. He left his family
[44:49] back in Tucson and spend 30 whole days
[44:53] with Ruth and I sharing the scriptures,
[44:57] sharing the message, playing the message
[44:59] at night, following me around. I had to
[45:02] keep busy because I had I was raising
[45:04] lives uh hogs. I was farming crop. We
[45:08] had harvest to make on all the farms.
[45:11] But he'd follow me around. He'd start
[45:12] sharing things with me, little bits,
[45:14] little bits and pieces. It's like that.
[45:17] So all of a sudden it was almost time
[45:19] for him to go. So we go back. So he'd
[45:23] spend 30 whole days. So Ruth and I would
[45:26] sit at the supper table and we'd hear
[45:28] all of these things that have happened
[45:31] through brother Ben's ministry, through
[45:32] the scriptures, through what had
[45:34] happened to him and sharing all he's
[45:36] just pouring himself out to us. And uh
[45:39] then he got into water baptism with
[45:43] me. I believed
[45:45] privately but then Ruth heard about it
[45:48] so she called her sister-in-law and she
[45:49] said what is this about water baptism I
[45:51] want to hear about this so then he
[45:54] shared it with us and all and so so
[45:57] that's the very time that was in October
[46:00] 1967 that uh he said you know he he said
[46:05] about water baptism so both of us were
[46:07] baptized in the bathtub you remember
[46:10] that I shared it at church right amen
[46:13] both of us uh All I remember there was a
[46:15] there was a lake quite a ways away, but
[46:17] I wouldn't change it for nothing. You
[46:20] know, fill up the bathtub. Let's have
[46:22] it, you know. And uh my and you know uh
[46:27] what's so wonderful about this as saints
[46:30] is that Ruth and I came together on
[46:33] this. It don't always happen, right? It
[46:35] don't always happen. You know, marriages
[46:37] get broken up and families get broken
[46:39] up, but you know, it was it was just
[46:41] something.
[46:43] Okay. So
[46:45] now that happens and then in
[46:48] uh let me see. Yes, December of '
[46:54] 67, we decided we need to make a visit
[46:57] to my brother and his family in Tucson.
[47:00] So we uh I hired somebody to take care
[47:03] of my livestock. And
[47:06] uh well, I don't know if I paid him or
[47:08] not, but he he was a friend of mine. So,
[47:12] I might have maybe just used him. I
[47:15] don't I don't know. I don't know. Maybe
[47:18] that might have
[47:19] happened. So, anyway, we're driving all
[47:22] the way to Tucson and uh we stay with my
[47:26] brother and his family. Well, all they
[47:27] had is a mobile home and they already
[47:30] had I don't know how many children. Uh
[47:32] incidentally, that's a testimony that uh
[47:36] my sister-in-law having trouble that
[47:38] heart trouble after the first or second
[47:40] child. Well, she ended up having 15.
[47:44] Well, that's when I see face it is
[47:47] shocked. Shocked. So, the thing of it is
[47:50] is that uh we went there and we spent
[47:52] about probably about a month, but then
[47:56] you know uh we started getting restless.
[47:58] We need to go back home. So, uh somebody
[48:02] spoke to us and uh in the meantime, we
[48:05] were going to church there while we were
[48:07] there. And on the meantime, I'd be
[48:08] studying. I'd be reading, you know, the
[48:11] message or whatever, you know, trying to
[48:14] understand. And uh the thing of it is is
[48:16] that, you know, we could only stay we
[48:18] can only stay that long. That's enough.
[48:20] So somebody said to us, you know, I just
[48:23] feel did you really need to move here?
[48:26] Well, you know
[48:28] what? We had to know it. Not just
[48:31] somebody telling us we had to know it.
[48:34] And the Lord dropped it in our hearts.
[48:36] Dropped it in my heart. So you know uh I
[48:39] said okay dear we we need to head home.
[48:42] So the reason I read that scripture if
[48:44] God before us who can be against us for
[48:48] uh we uh I can't remember what the first
[48:51] town is out east out of Tucson. I think
[48:53] it's Will Cox or
[48:55] Benson. I'm saying to Ruth,
[48:58] "Wow, this is not going to be easy.
[49:01] She's got parents. I've got a
[49:04] dad." And here's what he did. He g he he
[49:07] he he gave such a bargain on that farm.
[49:09] Okay. So for us to pick up and say,
[49:12] "Hey, we're moving to Tucson. I don't
[49:15] have a job in Tucson. I don't know what
[49:17] I'm going to do."
[49:19] Okay. So we're talking together. And a
[49:23] lot of you know, you know, a lot of you
[49:25] know my wife. She's a very quiet person.
[49:29] She took the
[49:30] Bible and this is the very scripture she
[49:34] read to me. If God before us, who can be
[49:38] against us? That settled my heart. I
[49:42] went home. We lined up our machinery. We
[49:45] relined up all of our property. We
[49:47] didn't sell the land at first year. We
[49:50] rented to my cousins and we had an
[49:52] auction. And by
[49:55] uh I suppose
[49:57] February of
[50:00] 1968, February of 1968, we were on our
[50:04] way with a U-Haul behind a car, taking
[50:09] whatever belongs we could. Bought a 12x5
[50:12] mobile home, lived in a trailer court.
[50:16] Amen. And we already had the three
[50:19] children. So the thing of it is at that
[50:24] very
[50:25] time at that very time when we had just
[50:29] barely moved there
[50:32] uh we started going to church, we
[50:36] started have going to prayer meetings
[50:39] and this is one I want to get
[50:41] to. Uh for one thing is in one of those
[50:47] prayer meetings. It was about that time
[50:49] my dad and his wife and her daughter
[50:52] came to visit us in Tucson. I had bought
[50:57] another small mobile home and put it in
[51:00] the court. So the thing of it is when
[51:03] they came they could stay right in that
[51:05] mobile home.
[51:07] Well, my dad and his wife and Patty,
[51:11] they went to one of the service on South
[51:13] Stone, which was a original Jewish
[51:15] tabernacle where Brother Breen first
[51:18] started a church. And uh and of course
[51:22] my dad was not used to long services,
[51:25] you know, the Lutheran was in and out,
[51:27] you know. So here, Brother Green service
[51:30] is about two hours, you know. So my dad
[51:32] was hot when he come out. He he he he
[51:36] was hot and it wasn't because of the
[51:40] air, but he uh he was up a little bit
[51:43] uptight. But of all things, you
[51:46] know, this lady's daughter, Patty, come
[51:50] to a prayer meeting and the president of
[51:53] the Lord
[51:54] came and brought her into this message.
[51:59] You see, here's here's where I I want to
[52:02] emphasize a little on this. You remember
[52:04] how I told how my bad attitude I had? I
[52:07] remember them coming to the farm one
[52:09] time and I just decided I'm going to go
[52:11] to the hog barn. I ain't even talking to
[52:13] her. That's how bad attitude I had. But
[52:16] that's how wrong we can be
[52:19] because we can't figure out God here. My
[52:22] dad, I'm resisting that marriage, but at
[52:25] the same time, she has a daughter that's
[52:27] a seed.
[52:30] So you never figure out God.
[52:33] So anyway, sitting under brother Green's
[52:37] ministry then and then we had barely got
[52:39] there and not knowing much about the
[52:41] message. So on Wednesday, one Wednesday
[52:44] night, he said, you know, I feel
[52:47] led I feel led to preach a series on the
[52:52] acts of the prophet. I'm going to call
[52:53] it the acts of the prophet. So he shared
[52:56] all that he had seen and heard with
[52:58] brother Brandham and uh and uh and so
[53:03] that became a a real eyeopener to my
[53:07] wife and I to understand a little more
[53:10] about brother Bam's ministry, what it
[53:13] was all about. And thereby we weren't
[53:15] really Bible readers. So, you know, we
[53:17] had to be we had to be led and taught
[53:20] into the scriptures and what what it was
[53:22] all about. And uh
[53:25] so even though I had had an experience
[53:29] in Minnesota, you know, I had to go
[53:31] through that justification,
[53:34] sanctification. But I don't know, some
[53:37] people receive the Holy Ghost in the
[53:40] church. Uh some receive it
[53:43] someplace maybe wherever they are. But I
[53:48] got it in our own local home.
[53:51] A couple came to our
[53:53] house, started talking about the Lord.
[53:56] We prayed together and that very night I
[54:00] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I
[54:02] felt the power of God like I never had
[54:04] felt in my life just enter me just and
[54:09] and and and from that time on it was
[54:12] just a growing process. Growing process
[54:15] and it became a living reality to my own
[54:19] self.
[54:21] I know some of these other things now a
[54:23] lot of things maybe are strange to you
[54:26] and uh I was just saying to somebody
[54:29] recently
[54:31] uh when I when I took John 3 there the
[54:34] listing of the spirit you can't always
[54:36] explain
[54:37] things you know it's it's personal
[54:41] things that happen to you uh you can't
[54:43] always put it on paper for people so
[54:46] really it's personal so it doesn't
[54:47] really matter if anybody understands it
[54:49] or
[54:50] It's the main thing is that it's between
[54:52] you and God. So, we're in uh we moved in
[54:56] February of 68, 1973. I always had a uh
[55:00] I don't know what it was. I always I
[55:03] probably because of the visiting couple
[55:05] visiting ministers from of South Africa,
[55:07] but one of them was brother Willie
[55:10] Ret. Uh I shouldn't have probably
[55:13] brought up the name because there's a
[55:14] little story behind that. And one of
[55:16] them was brother Sydney Jackson. But uh
[55:20] uh I remember not not being in minister
[55:24] but in invited by a minister to pray
[55:26] with brother Willie Retif over some
[55:28] situation and he actually got a great
[55:31] victory and uh that happened in Tucson.
[55:34] So I don't I just had a a real liking I
[55:37] couldn't explain it. I I just I like
[55:39] something about I thought in the back of
[55:41] my mind in my my life I just uh
[55:44] something about South Africa. So in the
[55:46] meantime, my
[55:47] brother I don't think it ever come to
[55:50] fruition. In fact, I was sharing this
[55:51] with this gentleman that was in my house
[55:53] yesterday. But anyway, uh uh my brother
[55:58] had uh worked for a Jewish man and uh
[56:02] got quite acquainted with him. He was a
[56:05] a real wonderful employer to him and uh
[56:08] they got acquainted got talking a lot
[56:11] about Israel. My brother just felt like
[56:14] like the Lord had given him a plan.
[56:16] We'll never know if it ever went to
[56:18] fruition or not. I don't think it did,
[56:20] but anyway, I'm not sure. Anyway, my
[56:23] brother felt like he had a something
[56:26] from the Lord about drawing up a plan
[56:29] about a a small army tank and uh he
[56:33] presented it while he was over there,
[56:35] but like I say, I don't know what all
[56:37] happened there. So, they moved to
[56:40] Israel in
[56:43] 1973. I I don't remember what month it
[56:46] was. It wouldn't really make any
[56:47] difference. So at the same time we
[56:51] are we decided to go to South Africa. We
[56:54] don't even have a plan. We really don't
[56:56] have a plan but we decided to go there.
[56:58] We stay with somebody for a while then
[57:01] in Johannesburg. So
[57:04] uh here's what I'm going to get to.
[57:07] Sometimes you think you know what is
[57:09] great, what is big, what is huge. I'm
[57:13] not even a minister then. I'm not even a
[57:16] minister. So I'm going there. Uh we
[57:19] heard about the longs uh
[57:22] longs good name long. We heard about the
[57:25] longs in Rhodesia at that time and uh
[57:29] things like that and they moved down to
[57:30] Durban, South Africa after a few years.
[57:32] They were farmers got their land taken
[57:35] away in Rhodesia. So they moved down to
[57:37] South Africa. So
[57:39] uh anyway uh we go down there. So we we
[57:45] finally went to uh Durban where where
[57:47] the the great happening the racetrack
[57:50] happened and many things happened there
[57:52] uh that you've read about and heard
[57:54] about. So uh we were there a few months
[57:58] and uh I didn't work by grace of God we
[58:01] had enough finance and uh but we already
[58:04] had plans that we would go to Israel
[58:08] where my brother was. So, uh, we finally
[58:12] rented a little apartment. I don't even
[58:14] know how we could get it without having
[58:16] a job, but we got it by the grace of
[58:18] God. Bought our little Volkswagen
[58:21] car. Can you imagine? And we got four
[58:24] children already. And we're we're
[58:27] zipping up and down
[58:29] Durban. And we even uh, hate to say it,
[58:32] well, you know, we even had a couple
[58:34] more in there later on.
[58:38] couple couple brothers and sist one one
[58:40] brother and sister even their daughter I
[58:42] think so we were the uh I don't know
[58:45] what you call it what was that program
[58:47] they used to have with them people all
[58:48] writing in one one on top and inside and
[58:51] everything I don't know we all you're
[58:54] too young what you
[58:56] know so the thing of it is is that uh
[58:59] one day I don't know this sister came
[59:02] from England and I don't know if she had
[59:04] met uh one of the uh one of the sisters
[59:07] or but she came to our apartment. So a
[59:11] brother and I, we step out on the patio
[59:14] and we're talking and so I just I don't
[59:18] know if I wanted a drink of water or
[59:19] something. I was going to go and so uh I
[59:23] make the corner like this to go in the
[59:25] kitchen and I look and this sister it's
[59:29] now I may it might sound kind of crazy
[59:32] but it was almost like a
[59:33] snake. She was weaving like this up like
[59:36] this here. So I have never dealt with a
[59:40] demon before. But I said in the name of
[59:42] Jesus Christ come out of her. And she
[59:44] went like that down and she was
[59:47] delivered
[59:49] from that
[59:50] spirit. That's the first time I'd ever
[59:52] seen a spirit cast out.
[59:57] So I can't explain what we all were
[1:00:00] there for then. But even if it was one
[1:00:02] for one soul of deliverance.
[1:00:06] Yeah. So then after several months we
[1:00:10] decided it was time to go to
[1:00:12] Israel. So we went there in
[1:00:16] February. Let me see. The Yankee war was
[1:00:19] in
[1:00:20] 1973. We went that was October of 73. We
[1:00:26] came to Israel. That must have been
[1:00:29] February of 74. It was right at the end
[1:00:31] of the war, I think it was.
[1:00:35] And so,
[1:00:41] uh, in Israel, uh, there again, uh, you
[1:00:45] know, people ask you, "Well, what were
[1:00:46] you doing there? What were you doing
[1:00:48] there?" Uh, it might sound kind of
[1:00:50] crazy, but I don't have all the answers.
[1:00:56] I've had some great
[1:00:58] happenings. Uh we as a group, we turned
[1:01:01] out to be quite a few believers there
[1:01:04] that believe the
[1:01:06] message. We decided it wasn't our job to
[1:01:09] convert the Jews. We'll leave that to
[1:01:11] the two witnesses.
[1:01:14] But I had an experience like uh there's
[1:01:17] an older gentleman in nursing home
[1:01:19] there. He he came he was a Jew, but he
[1:01:21] had been in America. So he spoke
[1:01:23] English. Well, say just for instance now
[1:01:26] I met him on the sidewalk one day. What
[1:01:28] I would do if I would start talking to
[1:01:31] of course I never learned Hebrew. I just
[1:01:33] learned a few words but I couldn't put a
[1:01:34] sentence together. So whoever spoke
[1:01:36] English I get along with you know to to
[1:01:39] to try and speak to them. So I'm just
[1:01:43] talking away to this older gentleman at
[1:01:45] the sidewalk and the presence of the
[1:01:48] Lord just comes. I'm sharing everything
[1:01:50] that that I know about a gentile prophet
[1:01:53] coming to me as a gentile and I'm just
[1:01:55] sharing away. I'm just sharing away and
[1:01:57] he's standing and he's taking it in. And
[1:01:59] I'll tell you what, there was a presence
[1:02:00] that came over that that sidewalk where
[1:02:03] we were talking. And so as he moved down
[1:02:05] just a little ways down, he turned
[1:02:07] around and said, "I love you, Ray. I
[1:02:10] love you, Ray." There was a binding
[1:02:11] there. I talked to another Jew one time,
[1:02:14] a young man, and I just started sharing
[1:02:16] things with him. just starts sharing
[1:02:18] with him. He looks at me in my eye and
[1:02:20] he said, "Man," he said, "I wish you
[1:02:22] could talk to my rabbi." You see, we've
[1:02:25] got with that 144,000 going to know what
[1:02:28] we're going to have. You understand what
[1:02:29] I'm saying to them two witnesses. So,
[1:02:32] you know, we had a lot of different
[1:02:34] experiences there. I mean, a lot of
[1:02:36] different without trying to bring them
[1:02:38] to to what we thought they should get
[1:02:41] converted. You know, they they had
[1:02:43] enough of that. they had enough people
[1:02:45] over there trying to be, you know, Moses
[1:02:48] or Elijah or whatever else or or just
[1:02:51] trying to get him converted, you know,
[1:02:52] to Christianity and all of this here. So
[1:02:56] you know those things happened and uh in
[1:03:00] fact one time and I don't remember all
[1:03:02] the incidents but this was after we
[1:03:04] moved we we were first of all in
[1:03:06] Jerusalem then we went to a city along
[1:03:08] the Mediterranean called the Natania and
[1:03:10] there's where we work for a religious
[1:03:11] community called the cury sons and uh
[1:03:15] they were them black coats and black
[1:03:17] hats and you know just like you see the
[1:03:20] Amish and and the uh German Baptist and
[1:03:23] so on like that. So, uh, we worked for
[1:03:25] that community and, uh, you know, we
[1:03:27] tried to get by with, uh, a few words of
[1:03:30] Hebrew and a lot of quite a few people,
[1:03:33] one of them rabbi spoke English very
[1:03:34] well. He came from America and we, uh,
[1:03:37] we we did quite a bit with him, uh, in
[1:03:39] work and so on. And so,
[1:03:42] uh, it just comes about different things
[1:03:44] that happened there. Uh, I won't go into
[1:03:47] a lot. Let me see what I wrote down
[1:03:49] here.
[1:03:51] Uh, yeah. So uh then we moved back to uh
[1:03:56] we moved up to Jerusalem and uh my
[1:03:59] brother was a manager of a uh sugar and
[1:04:01] flour packing plant and a few of us
[1:04:03] brothers worked uh with him on that.
[1:04:07] Well, all of a sudden I just got real
[1:04:09] restless and Ruth got real restless too.
[1:04:12] It something something just wasn't just
[1:04:15] wasn't moving. Uh uh wasn't wasn't
[1:04:19] moving like it was. Uh, I was so
[1:04:22] peaceful in Natana, but in in Jerusalem,
[1:04:25] we weren't right in Jerusalem either. We
[1:04:27] was actually in the Arab section on the
[1:04:29] outskirts. So, that's probably part of
[1:04:31] it. It just wasn't the same feeling. And
[1:04:33] we weren't dealing with Jewish people,
[1:04:35] you know, we were dealing with the Jew
[1:04:37] the the man that we worked for was
[1:04:39] Jewish and but it was in a Arab
[1:04:42] section. So,
[1:04:45] uh, I got to back up a little bit. Am I
[1:04:47] too much? No. I back up a little bit.
[1:04:49] Time. uh I don't know what year it was
[1:04:51] but brother Green brought a uh tour uh
[1:04:54] he had gone there many times had some
[1:04:56] tremendous experiences there in that in
[1:04:59] in that nation uh the thing of it is
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:06] uh brother brother Tom and sister
[1:05:09] Marilyn Brown that are Bible believers
[1:05:11] some of you would know him some of you
[1:05:12] that moved here you wouldn't but uh they
[1:05:16] came on a tour sister Dao remember
[1:05:19] brother talking Brother Dao and Sister
[1:05:21] Dao. Sister Dao came. Uh the uh that
[1:05:25] would have been uh uh Brother Neville's
[1:05:28] daughter that's married to Craig Wood
[1:05:30] now. What's her name? Linda. Yeah,
[1:05:32] Linda. Wood. Her name is Wood Neville.
[1:05:35] She came uh I forget who came all
[1:05:39] together and then we got to know the
[1:05:40] Browns a little bit. So then they uh by
[1:05:44] the time we moved to Jerusalem, that was
[1:05:46] while we were in Natana. We were in
[1:05:47] Jerusalem. Brother Tom, sister Marilyn,
[1:05:50] brother Melon Fzen, and and his wife.
[1:05:55] Uh I think it was might have been sister
[1:05:58] Linda again. I'm not sure who it was.
[1:06:01] They came well. We had different
[1:06:03] apartments. So the Browns stayed with
[1:06:06] us. Uh brother Mel, sister maybe stayed
[1:06:09] with my brother. I can't remember. So we
[1:06:11] really got acquainted with the Fz and
[1:06:14] the Browns more now. So, we're getting
[1:06:18] this Ruth and I getting this feeling of
[1:06:21] uneasiness and
[1:06:23] uh uh all of a
[1:06:26] sudden it dropped into my heart by with
[1:06:29] that still small voice, you'll be going
[1:06:32] back to
[1:06:33] America. You'll be going back to
[1:06:35] America. So, I told Ruth, I said, I
[1:06:39] believe we'll be going back. Oh, no.
[1:06:41] Where are we going to
[1:06:43] go? Where are we going to go?
[1:06:47] So I got this scripture here. The Lord
[1:06:50] spoke to me. He spoke to me. I don't
[1:06:53] know. It just it was real. He he he was
[1:06:56] real. Well, I I don't know. Now, you
[1:07:00] know, we know because the opening of the
[1:07:02] word, this message, it be the Bible
[1:07:04] became a new book. I think brother
[1:07:06] Brandham told other George Smith, you go
[1:07:08] to Israel. You need to go to Israel,
[1:07:09] George. Sometime the Bible become a new
[1:07:11] book. And uh I had another time where
[1:07:14] the Lord really spoke to me directly. In
[1:07:16] fact, I never had it happen like that. I
[1:07:18] was laying in bed and there was a
[1:07:20] decision to be made in Israel whether to
[1:07:23] stay at that time or go home goes go.
[1:07:25] And my my sister-in-law saw that there
[1:07:28] again I was uneasy. I didn't know what
[1:07:30] to do. And that very
[1:07:32] night the scripture started coming to me
[1:07:34] in bed. So I got up and so I didn't want
[1:07:36] to wake my my family. So I got up in the
[1:07:39] bathroom turned on and the Lord spoke to
[1:07:41] direct to me. So that's how we stayed as
[1:07:43] long as we did. But in this time this
[1:07:46] scripture came to me. Depart ye Isaiah
[1:07:50] 52 verse 11 and 12. Depart ye depart ye.
[1:07:55] Go ye out from touch no unclean thing.
[1:07:59] Go ye out of the midst of her and be ye
[1:08:01] clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.
[1:08:04] How many believe we bear the vessels of
[1:08:06] the Lord? Amen. For you shall not go out
[1:08:09] with haste, nor go by flight, for the
[1:08:13] Lord will go before you. Oh God, and the
[1:08:17] God of Israel will be your re-reward.
[1:08:23] You know what? I saw that scripture come
[1:08:25] to pass because now what happened? One
[1:08:31] day the phone
[1:08:32] rings after this. It's Brother Tom
[1:08:35] Brown. Well, and I got ahead of myself.
[1:08:38] Whoa. It ain't going to have the same
[1:08:40] meaning. I'm
[1:08:41] sorry. Well, in
[1:08:45] 1977, we decided as a group we wanted to
[1:08:49] come back to the special meetings in
[1:08:50] Tucson, Arizona. Brother Green always
[1:08:52] had December
[1:08:53] meetings and at the same month that
[1:08:56] Brother Brandon passed away.
[1:08:59] I don't know where all the finance
[1:09:01] totally came from, but we were able to
[1:09:03] fly here. So I I ministered my first
[1:09:07] time and I can't really even say
[1:09:08] ministering, but we invited uh to one of
[1:09:13] the homes. They had a big living room
[1:09:15] some Mormon
[1:09:17] people. And uh one of the people said,
[1:09:19] "Ray, why don't you speak tonight?" My
[1:09:22] brother was actually the leader of the
[1:09:24] group at that time. So you know, I said,
[1:09:28] "Okay, I'll speak." Well, you know, I
[1:09:30] just spoke. I didn't, you know, I I I
[1:09:33] wasn't versed that great in the message,
[1:09:35] but I just spoke what was on my heart.
[1:09:38] And uh from that time on, uh I I kind of
[1:09:42] um well, even before this, I want to I
[1:09:45] don't know how many times I'm going to
[1:09:46] back up, but keep backing up.
[1:09:49] I'm feeling real good. I don't know
[1:09:50] about you. Good. But anyway,
[1:09:54] uh I kind of feel maybe I missed the
[1:09:56] Lord a few few years about the ministry,
[1:09:59] but there's no going back on that. I
[1:10:01] just maybe I felt maybe before we even
[1:10:04] left Tucson. I I can't verify that for
[1:10:07] sure. But
[1:10:10] anyway, then when we were coming back, I
[1:10:12] said, "Okay, I I I feel the start of the
[1:10:14] ministry." So, I get a hold of Brother
[1:10:17] Tom Brown and we already knew each
[1:10:18] other. Is it all right if I come by on
[1:10:21] the way to Tucson? Yeah, I'll come by.
[1:10:23] So, I already in Minnesota, there was a
[1:10:26] little work uh we didn't we didn't have
[1:10:28] that work when we got converted uh up
[1:10:30] there. You know, our experience with the
[1:10:31] Lord. We didn't know about it, but it
[1:10:33] was only about 35 miles from us. There
[1:10:35] was a little work started later on and
[1:10:38] that had something to do with brother
[1:10:39] Wartz from the sister Wartz area.
[1:10:41] remember and brother Brandham talking
[1:10:43] about brother Wartz out there on Sunset
[1:10:45] Mountain on where he was healed and that
[1:10:48] was that's that's they came from
[1:10:50] Minnesota. See that's where brother
[1:10:52] Bobby, you know where the boy lives
[1:10:55] today. So I I asked if I would come by
[1:10:57] there. Yeah. Okay. Brother Bartell was
[1:10:59] the pastor. I spoke there. Uh we knew a
[1:11:03] brother in Tukam Kerry, New Mexico. We
[1:11:05] stopped there. Yeah. Come on. So I
[1:11:07] there's my ministry started started
[1:11:09] ministry. See? So then we go to the
[1:11:11] means and we go back.
[1:11:13] So like I say, I'm going back now. I get
[1:11:17] this call from Brother Tom Brown. Hey,
[1:11:18] Brother Ray, I hear you're coming back
[1:11:20] to the States. Well, I know he The
[1:11:23] reason I think he heard is because we
[1:11:25] had talked to Brother Perry Green. And
[1:11:27] Brother Perry Green and Brother Tom
[1:11:28] Brown were very good friends. Very good
[1:11:31] friends. And so I think Brother Green
[1:11:33] had told Brother Tom. And Brother Tom
[1:11:35] said, "Hey, Brother Ree, how would you?"
[1:11:38] He didn't promise me. He say, "How would
[1:11:39] you like to come pastor church? How
[1:11:41] would you like to come minister?" He
[1:11:42] said, "How would you love to like to
[1:11:44] come to work for me?" I felt that
[1:11:47] scripture. Wait on the Lord. Don't
[1:11:51] depart. I'll make a way.
[1:11:56] And so we said, "Okay, that's the
[1:11:58] leadership of the Lord." That's what he
[1:12:00] spoke to me. He spoke to me through his
[1:12:03] word.
[1:12:05] Ruth, it's time to pack up.
[1:12:08] we're going. So, he provided I had still
[1:12:12] some money coming from the farm year by
[1:12:16] year that we had sold, but I didn't have
[1:12:18] the money then, but brother Tom said,
[1:12:19] "I'll pay your airline ticket." And when
[1:12:21] I got back here, we got the money, we
[1:12:23] paid them back, if I remember right. So,
[1:12:25] brother Tom at that
[1:12:28] time is uh he they had built a church,
[1:12:32] the church is there today. uh I think in
[1:12:35] 19 right at the maybe 76 maybe it was
[1:12:38] already built. Well, he wanted he wanted
[1:12:42] very much the brother Menof Freezen to
[1:12:44] be the pastor come from Canada and be
[1:12:46] the pastor. So the thing of it is is
[1:12:49] that uh he had been here once for a
[1:12:52] while but he had to go back and get some
[1:12:54] things together. So we we end up here in
[1:12:57] September of 78. So, uh, Brother Tom,
[1:13:02] uh, mainly they would play tapes in the
[1:13:04] meantime and once in a while he'd say,
[1:13:06] "Oh, brother Ray, uh, you know, you're
[1:13:08] welcome to minister this Sunday." And so
[1:13:11] that's kind of how how that got started
[1:13:15] here a little bit. And so, in the
[1:13:18] meantime, Brother Middle finally comes
[1:13:20] and his family, brings his family down,
[1:13:22] and he said, "Brother Reed, I want you
[1:13:24] to be my song leader and minister when I
[1:13:26] ask you to minister." So we became close
[1:13:29] together. So it was through his
[1:13:32] graciousness, through the brother Tom's
[1:13:34] graciousness and another Lucille, my
[1:13:37] daughter-in-law, S. Lucille Ericson, it
[1:13:41] was because of her father having them
[1:13:43] camp meetings that the first camp
[1:13:45] meeting probably we attended uh would
[1:13:47] have been uh August of 79. So he the
[1:13:52] first time he asked me just give my
[1:13:53] testimony my testimony. Then the
[1:13:56] ministry then he started asking me to
[1:13:57] minister. Brother Hillbrand came from
[1:13:59] Edmonton. They brought bus load down
[1:14:01] there. People were going there with
[1:14:03] camp. So it that's how I want to just
[1:14:07] you know I don't know all the young men
[1:14:08] that have the call are not here tonight.
[1:14:10] That's how the doors open in your
[1:14:13] ministry. You have a ministry doors will
[1:14:15] start opening. Something will happen if
[1:14:17] somebody will ask you start
[1:14:19] ministering. Sorry. And that's how that
[1:14:23] started here. Then uh
[1:14:28] uh then brother Minnow
[1:14:32] uh
[1:14:34] uh he he he he came to me one time and
[1:14:37] then and after No, he told brother Tom,
[1:14:41] I'll come and I'll try it for a year.
[1:14:43] Well, he was here about a year and a
[1:14:45] half and he came to me and said,
[1:14:46] "Brother Ray, I for some reason I just
[1:14:50] don't feel settled. I just don't feel
[1:14:52] settled."
[1:14:54] Uh so he uh he said you know
[1:14:59] um
[1:15:00] uh so he goes back but then he comes
[1:15:03] back again. He was back and well I know
[1:15:06] I'm not saying anything out of turn
[1:15:07] because I know he's given his testimony
[1:15:09] different times. So he he he just he
[1:15:12] didn't he couldn't find the will of God.
[1:15:14] So finally he said to
[1:15:15] me he said to me he said you know if
[1:15:18] you're coming this way I guess you got
[1:15:20] water here but sorry thank you. He came
[1:15:22] to me and said, "Brother Ray, I think
[1:15:24] you ought to stand for
[1:15:26] pastor." And uh I said, "Well, you know,
[1:15:31] I just put it before the Lord. I don't
[1:15:33] know exactly what uh so uh I
[1:15:38] was I was actually thinking about it and
[1:15:42] uh in fact, it was moving closer and
[1:15:44] closer. they were going. But in the
[1:15:46] meantime, they had somebody else come in
[1:15:47] and minister and uh and a lot of people
[1:15:51] took a liking to the ministry. I was
[1:15:53] just an infinite in the ministry. Uh to
[1:15:56] be honest with you, I I
[1:15:58] uh uh probably I mean I I I had a lot of
[1:16:03] people with me, but I I think some of
[1:16:05] the people thought I was a little
[1:16:06] immature to be the pastor and things
[1:16:09] like that, and I probably was. Uh and so
[1:16:13] uh the thing of it is is that uh uh at
[1:16:16] the last moment I was going to stand the
[1:16:18] last moment I I bowed out. I said no I'm
[1:16:21] not going. Well in the meantime a group
[1:16:23] from FTO started coming down some of you
[1:16:26] folks here from for none of you. Well
[1:16:28] brother Andy Brother Andy was in FTO but
[1:16:31] Andy uh there and uh so uh uh a group
[1:16:37] had come down. I baptized that whole
[1:16:38] group. And so when he found out this
[1:16:41] other brother was going to be the
[1:16:42] pastor, uh he got voted in. Of course,
[1:16:45] nobody was running against him. He got
[1:16:47] voted in. And the thing of it is is that
[1:16:50] uh I stayed for just a little while and
[1:16:52] then the people in Foster said, "Why
[1:16:54] don't you come? We want you to be our
[1:16:56] pastor." Well, I'm working full-time.
[1:16:58] Okay. I'm working full-time. And uh and
[1:17:02] uh besides trying to pastor up there, uh
[1:17:06] you know, we would have Thursday and
[1:17:08] Sunday just like we're having now.
[1:17:09] Thursday, I'd come home from work about
[1:17:11] I wouldn't get home till about 5. We had
[1:17:13] to leave. It was an hour and 50 minute
[1:17:15] drive. Uh you know, and uh
[1:17:20] so you know, it was it was it was barren
[1:17:23] on me and I was working uh physical
[1:17:26] labor, not just you know, in that time.
[1:17:29] And uh I'll just give this so so you can
[1:17:31] see how the Lord guides again. But uh so
[1:17:35] it went on for several years. And uh so
[1:17:38] it was just rush rush rush. The reason I
[1:17:41] started on Thursday night is because you
[1:17:43] know I've got children going to school.
[1:17:45] I've got to work. Uh I got to get up on
[1:17:47] uh you know if it was on Wednesday I'd
[1:17:49] have two more days of work. My children
[1:17:51] have two more days of school. So I
[1:17:52] decided hey we're going to have church
[1:17:53] on Thursday. That way we only got one
[1:17:55] more day to battle it. and uh and uh and
[1:17:59] so that's how that Thursday night, you
[1:18:01] know, a little unorth unorthodox.
[1:18:05] We're not Orthodox Gentiles.
[1:18:07] Untraditional. Yeah. So that's how that
[1:18:10] happened. But uh you know, then all then
[1:18:12] what happened is uh all of a sudden
[1:18:15] people from down here in Lima started
[1:18:18] coming up there. They wanted to sit on
[1:18:19] my ministry. Well, uh I want to I want
[1:18:22] to say something. I had a brother that I
[1:18:25] became quite close to. Uh, and I I won't
[1:18:28] name his name, but uh now because uh I'm
[1:18:32] not even sure where he's at with the uh
[1:18:34] ministry right now. Uh I know they
[1:18:37] became tape hearers, but uh and that's
[1:18:40] that's that's okay for him because he
[1:18:42] was a real buddy. But uh one of the
[1:18:45] things, you know, God can use anybody.
[1:18:48] Use anybody. But my uh my ministry
[1:18:52] uh he started coming up the false story
[1:18:55] with us, his family and him and he he
[1:18:57] would just he was very studious in the
[1:19:00] message. Very studious. He wasn't a
[1:19:02] minister. You don't have to be a
[1:19:04] minister to be studious. And uh he
[1:19:07] started sharing some things with me of
[1:19:08] the what what what I didn't even know
[1:19:10] the phrase opening of the word. Okay.
[1:19:12] What we know today he started sharing
[1:19:14] things about the opening of the word.
[1:19:17] And after sharing many things with me,
[1:19:20] it was like a light bulb went on. And
[1:19:23] from that time, my ministry started
[1:19:24] changing. It just started changing. And
[1:19:27] I said, "Wow, this is something." Uh,
[1:19:30] you know, how uh it's becoming open to
[1:19:33] me. This word is becoming open to me
[1:19:35] now. And so uh then like I say, all of a
[1:19:39] sudden people say, "Okay, we want to
[1:19:41] come to Fostori. We come." Well, we
[1:19:43] really weren't drawing people hardly at
[1:19:45] all from Fostoriia anymore. And uh let
[1:19:48] me see what year we went there. We went
[1:19:50] there in 19
[1:19:53] uh my wife helped me, Ruth helped me
[1:19:55] with some of these dates. 1982
[1:19:59] uh we started in Fostoriia. Yeah. And so
[1:20:03] uh in 1990 we started in Bluffton. So,
[1:20:06] because there was several people coming,
[1:20:09] uh, I thought, my be nice if we could
[1:20:12] find some place mid mid midway, you
[1:20:15] know. Well, I don't even know how I
[1:20:17] guess we drove through the city of
[1:20:18] Bluton, must have saw a forale sign on
[1:20:20] that old church. Uh, there was a Church
[1:20:23] of Christ down there downtown. And so,
[1:20:26] uh, we called I called the number and I
[1:20:29] became acquainted with one of the, uh,
[1:20:31] I'm going to have to have some more. Go
[1:20:33] ahead. Brother Ronnie knew it already.
[1:20:41] Thank you.
[1:20:43] Uh where was I at? You you and brother
[1:20:46] Don looking at the church. Oh yes. And
[1:20:48] then uh I got a hold of brother Don
[1:20:50] McNoli and uh and and a couple of the
[1:20:53] other brothers and I said, "Hey, you
[1:20:54] know, uh we need to go look at this
[1:20:57] building." And uh they were asking
[1:21:00] $75,000. Well, we weren't a very big
[1:21:02] group and I was always the type whether
[1:21:04] it's for me personally or the church
[1:21:07] never wanted to put people in in a real
[1:21:09] bad debt and uh so it was a little scary
[1:21:12] but we just felt uh so but I became very
[1:21:15] close to one of the board members. I
[1:21:17] don't know why he took a line to me. I
[1:21:19] took a line to him and uh he finally I
[1:21:22] said oh no sir uh uh that's a lot of
[1:21:26] money for us. Well, he said, "Ray, give
[1:21:28] an offer. Give an offer." So, I told one
[1:21:31] of the brothers, I said, "What what do
[1:21:33] you think we should offer?" Um, well, in
[1:21:35] the meantime, oh, I could go on and on,
[1:21:38] but we I'll have to cut it out. Oh my
[1:21:40] goodness. It's 8:30 over there. So,
[1:21:41] that's all right. Getting to the good
[1:21:43] part now. Yes. Uh uh, one of the
[1:21:47] brothers, I I I said, you know, uh, oh,
[1:21:51] a a brother that had gone to one of the
[1:21:52] other sister churches here. He was a
[1:21:54] realtor and he calls me up on Saturday
[1:21:57] night of all things and he said, "Hey,
[1:21:59] brother Ray, would it be all right if I
[1:22:01] come to Fosteria tomorrow?" I said,
[1:22:03] "Well, it's up to you." "Yeah, you're
[1:22:04] welcome." He's a He's a visitor. I was
[1:22:07] right at the time when you're dealing
[1:22:08] with this church. So, he said, "I'll
[1:22:10] help you. I'll help you there." And we
[1:22:12] go there and so they bring their whole
[1:22:15] board and they go downstairs and us
[1:22:17] brothers are upstairs. I said, "What do
[1:22:19] you think we should offer?" I don't know
[1:22:22] if it was me or but I blasted out said
[1:22:25] 35,000. One of the brothers looked at
[1:22:27] said, "Man, you're going to offend
[1:22:28] [Laughter]
[1:22:31] them." So I said, "Well, you know, uh,
[1:22:35] let's do it." So, you know, they they
[1:22:38] went downstairs to the room and give
[1:22:40] them that bid and they come and said,
[1:22:41] "No, we can't take
[1:22:43] 35,000." They find we went back and
[1:22:46] forth. Okay. So the finally they said
[1:22:48] they came right out and said listen we
[1:22:50] can't take any less than 55,000 because
[1:22:52] we've already appropriated for an
[1:22:54] orphanage. It has to go to an orphanage
[1:22:56] and it has to be that amount. Then we
[1:22:59] said okay we'll take it.
[1:23:02] Well you know it just took a few years
[1:23:04] and we able to pay for it you know. So
[1:23:07] the thing of it is that yeah like I say
[1:23:10] and I'm I'm going to end it now. I'm
[1:23:11] coming to the end of it. How many say
[1:23:15] amen? In 1990 we moved to Bluton. Then
[1:23:19] that's when we started there. And so
[1:23:21] what was that by the Wayne? Was that
[1:23:23] five six years ago we got the other
[1:23:25] building now? Okay. 20 in 20 March 20.
[1:23:30] March of 20 2020. So five years. Yeah.
[1:23:34] Five years we've been there in the new
[1:23:36] building. And you see how the Lord has
[1:23:37] multiplied and uh and uh thank the Lord
[1:23:41] he brought brother Wayne and he brought
[1:23:42] all these ministers all his help in the
[1:23:45] church and uh you see how the Lord has
[1:23:48] added onto the church like in the book
[1:23:50] of acts and uh you know and uh I just if
[1:23:56] I can just share this one thing and I'll
[1:23:59] close the reason it affected me about my
[1:24:02] experience is yesterday what happened in
[1:24:05] my
[1:24:06] home. I had called a company in
[1:24:10] Walpock about doing some gutter work on
[1:24:12] my church or my my house. I was having
[1:24:16] some
[1:24:17] trouble. And this young man comes out
[1:24:20] and he's doing some measuring and he
[1:24:22] comes in the house and we I said, you
[1:24:25] know, come on in the sun room. And so uh
[1:24:29] we started just talking natural
[1:24:32] things. And
[1:24:34] uh and uh I said, "How long have you
[1:24:38] worked for the company?" He said, 'Well,
[1:24:40] actually, I became I just I don't know
[1:24:43] when it was, but it must have been
[1:24:44] pretty recent. He said, 'I just became
[1:24:46] recently the owner of it. I said, ' Wow,
[1:24:49] you look really young. He's only 30ome
[1:24:52] years old. And he said, yeah. He said,
[1:24:56] uh, it's been a
[1:24:58] blessing. Well, that
[1:25:01] just immediately I said to him, are you
[1:25:04] a Christian? He said, yes, sir, I am. I
[1:25:07] said, I am, too. and a not only a
[1:25:09] Christian, but I'm a pastor. And I'll
[1:25:12] tell you what, the door
[1:25:14] opened and I he they don't even have a
[1:25:19] church that they're steady going to.
[1:25:21] He's bouncing around here and there. He
[1:25:23] said, "I came out of the Catholic church
[1:25:25] just like my neighbor." You remember my
[1:25:27] neighbor? He said, "I came out of the
[1:25:29] Catholic church."
[1:25:31] So I started just sharing with him about
[1:25:34] the church
[1:25:35] ages, you know, and I said, 'I don't
[1:25:38] know uh you know what you all believe
[1:25:41] and and and you know because I I I can't
[1:25:44] remember all what I
[1:25:46] spoke
[1:25:47] and all of a sudden the presence of God
[1:25:51] dropped in that room.
[1:25:53] It was so
[1:25:57] powerful. And I said, "I don't know how
[1:26:01] much uh how much you believe or how much
[1:26:03] you share." He said, "You might be
[1:26:04] surprised." I said, "Have you ever heard
[1:26:06] of William Brandon?" He said, "I've
[1:26:07] heard of him. I've just heard of him."
[1:26:10] But it just kept on rolling. It just
[1:26:13] kept on rolling. And and and uh and he
[1:26:18] witnessed. He said, "I said, "My, I felt
[1:26:20] the presence of the Lord there. uh uh
[1:26:22] his name is Zach Zachary and he said I
[1:26:25] did too Ray I felt his presence and he
[1:26:28] said you know what I had another
[1:26:29] appointment after this but that was
[1:26:31] cancelled he said it must have been the
[1:26:33] providence of God that we're sitting
[1:26:36] here
[1:26:37] speaking what we're speaking
[1:26:41] so incidentally brother Wayne I I
[1:26:42] haven't uh told you yet but I asked you
[1:26:45] know if it was all right to get the acts
[1:26:47] of the prophet and you said you believe
[1:26:49] every family should have well I hadn't
[1:26:51] told you, but I got a shipment already
[1:26:54] and and uh I wanted to talk to you about
[1:26:57] uh giving them out because there's only
[1:26:58] enough like one for a family. Well, you
[1:27:00] haven't got enough for every young
[1:27:02] person, but and I don't even know if we
[1:27:04] got one for a family. But the thing of
[1:27:06] it is I was hoping I had a church age
[1:27:09] book, but I didn't have I had my own,
[1:27:11] but it's all, you know, that's as old
[1:27:14] as and that's
[1:27:18] been. So, I'm looking in there and but
[1:27:21] uh I had the prophet
[1:27:23] there. So, I said, you know, uh Zach, he
[1:27:27] said to Zack, he didn't say Zachary. He
[1:27:29] said, "My name is Zach." I said, "Zack,
[1:27:31] you know, I've got this book I'd like to
[1:27:32] give to him. uh you can receive it or if
[1:27:35] you don't feel like receiving it's up to
[1:27:37] you. He said, "No, I'll take it." I came
[1:27:39] out of the uh and I showed him what it
[1:27:40] was and I showed him. But I said, "I'd
[1:27:43] really like you to get this church age
[1:27:46] book being you came out of the Catholic
[1:27:48] church is going to explain from the book
[1:27:50] of Acts and on there, you know." And so
[1:27:53] he said, "What was the name of that
[1:27:54] again?" And he wrote it down the paper.
[1:27:56] I believe we'll be in contact again
[1:27:58] something. So you pray for his name. I
[1:28:00] didn't get his last name. His name is
[1:28:02] Zachary.
[1:28:04] Okay, thank you for your time. I just I
[1:28:08] just trusting it'll be a blessing to
[1:28:10] you. But that's my life story.
[1:28:13] [Applause]
