[11:41] you could be seated we have some lengthy
[11:44] testimonies this morning we want to let
[11:45] you know about by the Larry Carmack says
[11:47] a few weeks ago I noticed a spot on my
[11:50] leg that I thought should be checked out
[11:51] I went to the dermatologist and she said
[11:54] it was nothing to worry about but found
[11:56] a couple other spots they look
[11:57] suspicious
[11:59] she did a biopsy they called a few days
[12:01] later and said they were both the
[12:02] beginning stages of cancer one on my arm
[12:05] of basal cell and one on my neck a
[12:08] melanoma
[12:09] Miracle number one they sent me to a
[12:12] plastic surgeon he said it was a very
[12:14] good catch to find these spots when
[12:16] setting the date for the procedure to
[12:18] remove the one on my neck I asked if
[12:20] there was any way I could have done
[12:22] could have it done before April 29th
[12:24] because I retire on that date and would
[12:27] have a small lapse in insurance coverage
[12:29] they could not get me in until the
[12:31] middle of may we called about Cobra
[12:33] insurance and another short-term policy
[12:35] both were very expensive and it would
[12:37] cost more than the procedure we called
[12:39] the plastic surgeon office back to see
[12:41] if we could back it up a few weeks until
[12:44] I would have insurance they said it is a
[12:46] melanoma and an aggressive cancer and
[12:48] want to do it as soon as possible
[12:51] so we thought we would just have to pay
[12:53] for it in the meantime we got a call
[12:55] from the dermatologist and wanted me to
[12:57] come in that day to take care of the
[13:00] spot on my arm about an hour and a half
[13:02] hours later the plastic surgeon called
[13:04] and said if you go today to have your
[13:06] arm done we can get you in next week to
[13:08] do the area on your neck one appointment
[13:10] is at 7 A.M before the office opens and
[13:13] the second one is on the 28th the day
[13:15] before I retire and I still have
[13:17] insurance
[13:18] Miracle number two Miracle number three
[13:21] I am training someone to do my job and
[13:24] they have had a lot of trouble hiring
[13:25] people I am on a five pound weight
[13:28] restriction and since I am training he
[13:30] is able to do the physical lifting and I
[13:32] don't have to take any time off
[13:34] also on the way home after the surgery
[13:36] on my arm I said to the Lord I haven't
[13:39] seen your dust for a long time
[13:41] send me your doves and immediately out
[13:43] of a flock of birds two doves appeared
[13:46] flying together the other direction it
[13:48] was a sign from the Lord that all will
[13:50] be all right I just want to praise the
[13:51] Holy One of Israel our great God and

[30:26] amen God bless you this morning sir good
[30:28] to be in the house of the Lord amen
[30:30] welcome all the visitors this morning
[30:32] say God bless you amen we have a very
[30:35] special dedication this morning
[30:38] brother Seth and sister Rebecca amen I
[30:41] don't know if they're in the building
[30:42] yet she's coming but we want to just
[30:46] take a few minutes this morning and
[30:47] listen
[30:51] we know the prophet taught us that we
[30:53] don't believe in baby baptisms we don't
[30:56] we don't believe that a child has made
[30:59] its decision to serve Christ but the
[31:02] Bible says
[31:04] that the blood of Jesus was shed
[31:07] for the world for the sins of the world
[31:10] and the prophet said that a baby if it
[31:13] would pass he said it would be going
[31:15] straight to heaven
[31:17] because of its innocence and and we
[31:19] thank the Lord for that so he said in
[31:20] the scripture instead of baptizing that
[31:23] Jesus had suffered the little children
[31:25] to be brought unto me and he said he
[31:27] took him in his arms and blessed them
[31:29] and dedicated them back to the Lord and
[31:33] we're so honored this morning to get to
[31:34] be a part of this one amen and I was
[31:38] just
[31:39] thinking this morning on the way to
[31:40] church Chris and I were talking that
[31:43] brother Sean Martin and I have been
[31:44] friends
[31:46] since well Bethany was born the same
[31:49] month that I met your dad and she's 20
[31:51] years old in January and so we've been
[31:54] knowing what Seth since he was four
[31:56] years old or so not much bigger than
[31:58] Titus in his hands and and we've known
[32:02] him all these years and no need to be a
[32:03] man of God
[32:05] and serve the Lord
[32:07] dedicate his life to this message he's
[32:09] one of the musicians here at the church
[32:10] and we're so thankful how many
[32:12] appreciate you've been seeth in this
[32:14] ministry
[32:15] amen we want to thank you for being a
[32:18] part of
[32:20] he puts his shoulder behind the wheel
[32:22] and anything whether being asked his
[32:24] needs he's been there he actually
[32:26] recently if you want to pray for him he
[32:28] just started a Ministry where he's going
[32:30] into the retirement centers in the
[32:32] nursing homes and he sets up of about an
[32:34] hour and plays to the people that can't
[32:37] go out he goes and plays and spends
[32:39] about an hour I went with him a couple
[32:41] of times the anointing just comes in the
[32:43] room he did something to see people with
[32:44] their hands lifted or worshiping they're
[32:46] bound to that Center so he just takes
[32:48] the anointing to them
[32:50] and then if you want to know how to pray
[32:52] for him pray God will just give you
[32:53] extra blessing there and I know that
[32:56] Rebecca stood greatly beside of him and
[32:58] and I was just thinking on the way about
[33:01] Rebecca and the first time that I seen
[33:03] her and her family I remember I come
[33:05] through here preaching on Thursday night
[33:07] I still remember the sermon I was
[33:09] preaching on zaru and her and her family
[33:11] showed up and you you hadn't been it's
[33:14] probably maybe it was six or four or
[33:17] something in that area and said just
[33:18] just a young baby so I've known these
[33:21] two forever and then helped perform the
[33:23] wedding and now we've got two babies we
[33:25] have Heaven Louise this morning who's
[33:28] named after Rebecca Shawn's first wife
[33:31] that passed which is Seth's mother and
[33:33] they've named her after her and then of
[33:36] course Rebecca's in heaven so Heaven
[33:38] Louise is a great representation of a
[33:40] real Godly mother amen so this is a real
[33:43] a real blessed child to carry this kind
[33:46] of name and we're so thankful to have
[33:48] him this morning sister Susie would you
[33:49] like come stand with us this morning and
[33:53] we appreciate this Mass family don't we
[33:55] God bless you
[34:00] rehearsal
[34:03] if there's a real Christian in the world
[34:08] I've seen their standings and very tough
[34:11] times
[34:12] and hold together and hold a family
[34:15] together
[34:16] very strong woman

[38:36] there and in Florida
[38:38] brother Wang came years ago years ago

[39:14] tribulations and distresses amen we have
[39:16] a different outlook on things and we

[39:22] worthy of the praise
[39:27] [Music]
[39:33] the reason we can bless the Lord

[46:36] before I do that
[46:40] no true word is
[46:44] um this is a year of transition and
[46:48] um and I just wanted to just
[46:51] take a moment
[46:54] and um
[46:56] I want to salute Brother Ray Harris
[47:00] [Applause]
[47:07] [Music]
[47:16] you you all may not know when you may
[47:19] not realize
[47:20] [Music]
[47:22] it means a lot as a as a younger
[47:25] minister
[47:27] when I can see
[47:29] a seasoned minister
[47:32] set examples that the rest of us should
[47:34] follow
[47:36] uh in my years a man and just being in
[47:39] the message I've Just Seen A lot where
[47:42] uh churches are left in complete
[47:45] disarray there is no plan at all in
[47:47] place and
[47:48] you know it's just it to me it's it's
[47:52] shameful
[47:53] that we end up like that
[47:55] but uh it takes a a real man of God to
[47:59] have foresight
[48:01] to look down in the future and and and
[48:04] and and try to put the church in a
[48:06] position where it can be successful
[48:09] and um there's a tremendous sacrifice
[48:12] that a man of God makes you know he it
[48:14] not only not only has these pastors but
[48:16] you know even in his latter years he
[48:18] still makes a sacrifice
[48:20] and uh you know and for me it just it
[48:22] just it speaks volumes
[48:26] it speaks volumes uh I I I've you know
[48:29] just seen churches where
[48:31] um they don't think about secession they
[48:33] don't talk about it they don't plan for
[48:35] it they don't do anything but when I see
[48:37] a church doing it right I have to come
[48:39] and say God bless you
[48:41] God bless you
[48:48] I'm gonna I'm gonna try to move on but I
[48:52] worked in an environment
[48:53] uh at a at a mega church
[48:56] and um at this mega church they had a
[48:59] transition that they they did they went
[49:02] from the the father who was the founding
[49:04] pastor and the son became the next
[49:06] pastor and uh and when they did it they
[49:09] studied other churches and one of the
[49:11] ones that he studied was uh Andy Stanley
[49:13] and and his son I mean Charles Stanley
[49:15] and his son Andy Stanley and they
[49:17] watched how transition happened it just
[49:19] was a flop you know and they watched
[49:22] other Ministries and how they did it and
[49:24] they realized what we shouldn't do
[49:26] and um you know and and they decided to
[49:29] do something different and it just
[49:30] worked it worked very well and uh and
[49:33] what I've seen here many of the mega
[49:35] churches use that model as their model
[49:37] but what I've seen happen here at True
[49:39] Word I believe it should be a model that
[49:42] should be taken throughout my message
[49:44] and people should follow what has
[49:46] happened here and when you have a man
[49:48] like Brother Ray in our midst we ought
[49:49] to be pulling from him to get everything
[49:51] we can uh because this this is this is
[49:55] done right this is done right and I say
[49:58] God bless you the true word amen we
[50:00] appreciate it from a distance you just
[50:02] don't know what it speaks to us amen God
[50:04] richly bless you
[50:13] thank you
[50:29] see here I am
[50:32] to worship
[50:35] here I am to bow down

[1:03:36] it's got to be the devil got to be today
[1:03:41] but uh we're happy to be here Amen in
[1:03:45] the area and just what a what a blessing
[1:03:47] it has been thus far and
[1:03:50] and um
[1:03:52] just you know trying to find the mind of
[1:03:54] the Lord for this morning a minister
[1:03:56] it's not that you lack sermons uh there
[1:04:00] are a number of sermons but you try to
[1:04:01] find Lord what do you want said for now
[1:04:06] all right and um and we trust that the
[1:04:08] Lord has given us something for this
[1:04:10] moment
[1:04:11] uh one of the things that I'm I'm very
[1:04:14] mindful of Amen when we when we're
[1:04:18] looking at scripture brother Branham is
[1:04:21] is trying to actually Elevate our
[1:04:24] thinking to get us to see who we are and
[1:04:27] it makes a statement and one of his
[1:04:30] sermons it says when the bride
[1:04:33] recognizes
[1:04:35] who she is
[1:04:37] then the Rapture will go
[1:04:40] and uh so oftentimes the Lord will give
[1:04:42] us sermons that will help try to put the
[1:04:45] bride in position to recognize who she
[1:04:47] is
[1:04:48] and uh and and I'll be honest with you
[1:04:51] uh when we start even thinking like that
[1:04:53] it challenges everything
[1:04:56] challenges our thought process telling
[1:04:59] everything we've heard like what is this
[1:05:01] but it's the Lord Jesus trying to get us
[1:05:03] to see something
[1:05:05] and I help you I pray that he'll he'll
[1:05:07] help us see ourselves amen this morning
[1:05:09] I want to make a very familiar scripture
[1:05:12] out of Luke chapter 2. verse 8 through
[1:05:15] 11.
[1:05:17] and um
[1:05:19] it's very familiar
[1:05:25] uh the Bible says in Luke chapter 2
[1:05:29] verse 8 it says and there were
[1:05:32] and the same country Shepherds abiding
[1:05:36] and the field keeping watch over their
[1:05:39] flock by night
[1:05:42] and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[1:05:44] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[1:05:46] round about them and they were sore
[1:05:49] afraid
[1:05:51] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:05:53] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:05:56] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:06:01] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[1:06:04] city of David a savior
[1:06:07] which is Christ the lord let's have a
[1:06:11] word of prayer amen over the scripture

[1:06:18] opportunity to stand behind this sacred
[1:06:21] deaths

[1:06:25] um Lord just uh how how important this
[1:06:28] place is and father we want to just
[1:06:31] bring something that you've given us to
[1:06:33] give to your people and that father
[1:06:35] would be something that helped Elevate
[1:06:37] us uh in our walk with you Lord I I
[1:06:41] thank you for uh brother Erickson who's
[1:06:44] the senior pastor of this great assembly
[1:06:47] Lord and brother Wayne Lawson Lord it

[1:06:52] thank you for both of them and their
[1:06:53] Ministries Lord and just what they've

[1:06:56] all the other brothers that have worked
[1:06:59] alongside them amen we're recently
[1:07:01] blessed by brother Nathan coming our way
[1:07:04] and Lord and we just we just appreciate
[1:07:06] all that has come from this place
[1:07:08] God as we come just for a little time of
[1:07:11] Fellowship today we pray that you would
[1:07:12] take control of this may this be
[1:07:14] something that will Fellowship around in
[1:07:16] Heaven someday oh God we'll remember
[1:07:18] that time we got together on Earth and
[1:07:20] how our hearts were uplifted by the word
[1:07:22] of God We Trust Lord that you just get
[1:07:24] all the glory and all the honor and all
[1:07:26] the Praises in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:07:30] amen you can be seated
[1:07:45] we just take for a topic
[1:07:50] um the attribute of salvation
[1:07:54] man the attribute of salvation
[1:08:02] as I mentioned earlier brother Branham
[1:08:04] makes a statement to us that when the
[1:08:07] bride recognizes who she is in the
[1:08:09] rapture
[1:08:10] will go
[1:08:12] and as we kind of comb through this
[1:08:15] discernment today
[1:08:16] there is typically what I'd like to do I
[1:08:19] give you a title and I'll give you a
[1:08:21] scripture but my thought is actually
[1:08:23] coming from a whole nother part of the
[1:08:25] Bible
[1:08:26] and uh but I know how people are as soon
[1:08:30] as you read a scripture amen and oh I
[1:08:33] know which direction he gonna go
[1:08:35] maybe you don't
[1:08:37] amen unless you heard the sermon already
[1:08:39] before but but uh but what I like amen
[1:08:43] is that they're they're a little nuggets
[1:08:45] in the scripture that we have the
[1:08:47] opportunity uh will become a man to
[1:08:50] service we have a opportunity just to
[1:08:52] kind of look at some of those nuggets
[1:08:53] things that will challenge us things
[1:08:55] that we might have read over or over
[1:08:57] read
[1:08:59] right and uh and but then God has a way
[1:09:01] of just kind of saying hey hey hey wait
[1:09:03] a minute and now you take a highlighter
[1:09:05] you put it on that section amen so uh
[1:09:08] just bear with me this morning as we as
[1:09:10] we've worked through this but I want to
[1:09:11] start with a quote out of why we are not
[1:09:14] a denomination Amen brother Brandon
[1:09:16] makes this statement which why which was
[1:09:19] first a savior or a sinner
[1:09:22] which was first a savior
[1:09:25] he says uh uh which was first A Healer
[1:09:29] or a sick person
[1:09:30] why was that permitted to why why was
[1:09:34] there permitted to be a sinner because
[1:09:36] the attributes of him is a savior if
[1:09:41] there'd never been a sinner he'd never
[1:09:43] been known as a savior Hallelujah he can
[1:09:48] make all things wind around to his glory
[1:09:51] can the power to say or can the pot say
[1:09:54] to the Potter you made me thus who's on
[1:09:58] the wheel who's got the claim whose
[1:10:01] hands is it in Paul said uh oh foolish
[1:10:04] man then he say uh he said he raised
[1:10:07] Pharaoh up for this purpose this very
[1:10:09] purpose certainly he knew it before
[1:10:11] there was a world he know who would be
[1:10:15] what
[1:10:16] and he let there be sin that he might be
[1:10:19] a savior he let there be sickness that
[1:10:22] he might be a Healer he let there be
[1:10:26] hate that he might be loved
[1:10:30] sure he did he's gone and that's his
[1:10:33] attributes and he has to have something
[1:10:36] to display his attributes
[1:10:40] I like that he says how would you ever
[1:10:42] know there was a night
[1:10:44] how would you ever know there's any if
[1:10:47] it was all it was all daylight uh how
[1:10:50] would you ever know there was a night
[1:10:52] there's a night Soul it could it could
[1:10:55] prove daylight sure sure it is amen you
[1:10:57] see what he did
[1:10:59] now and just a little thought from this
[1:11:03] quote is God allows certain things to
[1:11:05] happen or he knows these things are
[1:11:07] going to happen through predestination
[1:11:09] and for knowledge he knows things are
[1:11:11] going to happen but when it happens it's
[1:11:13] an opportunity for an attribute of God
[1:11:16] to be expressed to a believer
[1:11:20] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:22] amen but uh um as we go we're going to
[1:11:26] look to that amen God has attributes in
[1:11:29] him but he also placed certain
[1:11:31] attributes in US
[1:11:34] and he has to allow certain situations
[1:11:37] and he has allowed certain circumstances
[1:11:39] before those attributes are expressed in
[1:11:41] and through us it's not our attributes
[1:11:45] it's the attributes of God that are
[1:11:48] dwelling on the inside of us
[1:11:50] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:53] you see uh all that God wants
[1:11:58] the prophet has taught us he poured it
[1:12:00] into Christ
[1:12:02] and all that Christ is
[1:12:06] he is currently
[1:12:08] pouring that into his church
[1:12:12] so let me go a little further if a lion
[1:12:14] gives birth you expect another lion
[1:12:18] amen if a zebra gives birth then you
[1:12:22] should expect a baby zebra
[1:12:24] if an elephant gives birth then you
[1:12:27] should expect another elephant if a dog
[1:12:30] gives birth then you should expect a dog
[1:12:33] not a cat but another dog
[1:12:36] come on somebody amen if a human gives
[1:12:39] birth you expect another human but I'm
[1:12:42] here to ask the question this morning if
[1:12:45] God gives birth
[1:12:49] we should expect the Son of God we
[1:12:52] should expect the thought of God with
[1:12:54] the attributes that God had in him
[1:12:57] dwelling inside of him
[1:13:02] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:13:05] the prophet makes a statement here and I
[1:13:08] see it's going to be very easy
[1:13:13] amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:13:16] today and forever the prophet makes this
[1:13:18] thing says God gave Jesus his Spirit
[1:13:21] without message
[1:13:22] in him dwell the fullness of the godhead
[1:13:24] bodily he was God manifested In the
[1:13:28] Flesh the Bible said that God was in
[1:13:30] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:13:32] but when he gave out his Spirit to we
[1:13:37] adopted silence
[1:13:39] he gives us a bucket full out of that
[1:13:43] ocean
[1:13:44] he had all the fullness of the godhead
[1:13:47] we just have a portion of it as a gift
[1:13:51] of the Holy Spirit but if I took one
[1:13:54] bucket full of water out of the ocean or
[1:13:57] even a teaspoonful of it out of the
[1:13:59] oceans the same chemicals
[1:14:03] that's in the entire ocean would be in
[1:14:07] that Spoonful but just less in quantity
[1:14:11] not less in quality
[1:14:16] so the same holy spirit that was in
[1:14:19] Christ
[1:14:20] is
[1:14:22] in his church
[1:14:27] follow me amen just for a little bit we
[1:14:30] read Luke chapter 2 verse 11 for unto
[1:14:34] you is Born This Day in the city of
[1:14:37] David
[1:14:39] a savior now I want to
[1:14:43] uh pause just for a little bit amen
[1:14:46] a savior
[1:14:48] now uh for for our purposes it's not
[1:14:52] just a savior
[1:14:55] this is the savior
[1:14:59] and the scripture does capitalize it so
[1:15:01] we understand who they're talking about
[1:15:03] Hallelujah but we're talking about some
[1:15:05] of his attributes amen this morning but
[1:15:08] here the Bible says For unto you is Born
[1:15:11] This Day in the city of David a savior
[1:15:14] which is Christ the lord
[1:15:18] now I I said amen a savior well the
[1:15:21] scripture says they say I said the
[1:15:23] savior because we know who Christ is to
[1:15:25] us
[1:15:26] amen but I don't think the scripture was
[1:15:28] making a man a mistake when it said a
[1:15:31] savior
[1:15:33] there actually was a purpose for that
[1:15:36] and we're gonna just kind of keep
[1:15:38] reading through scripture this morning
[1:15:39] to see this
[1:15:46] let's just work let's take our time
[1:15:51] when I click on that word savior has a
[1:15:54] definition amen behind it and I have a
[1:15:58] little book called the key to the Bible
[1:15:59] that I looked at and it said a savior
[1:16:02] means a preserver
[1:16:04] a Defender
[1:16:06] uh a deliverer and they said God is
[1:16:09] preeminently the savior of his people as
[1:16:13] their creator preserver and deliverer so
[1:16:16] God preeminently
[1:16:18] preeminently is the savior amen
[1:16:21] hallelujah amen because he's the Creator
[1:16:24] preserve and deliver but but this
[1:16:27] attribute of save your preserver
[1:16:29] deliverer amen we're going to find that
[1:16:31] attribute has been expressed throughout
[1:16:33] time
[1:16:35] not just when Christ came to the Earth
[1:16:38] but this attribute had been expressed
[1:16:40] all through the Old Testament
[1:16:43] can I go a little further if it was
[1:16:46] expressed yesterday
[1:16:52] our savior is the same yesterday today
[1:16:56] and forever so if it was expressed
[1:17:00] yesterday then that same attribute would
[1:17:03] have to be expressed today
[1:17:06] oh we're looking for a god with skin on
[1:17:10] them
[1:17:16] that day on Calvary brother Brandon
[1:17:18] makes a statement
[1:17:20] When sin struck the Earth
[1:17:22] back in the beginning like a sheet of
[1:17:25] Blackness
[1:17:26] falling from the heaven it literally
[1:17:28] paralyzed the Earth
[1:17:30] it thrown every creature on the earth
[1:17:32] and all of God's creation and bondage
[1:17:34] man was under bondage of death sickness
[1:17:37] troubled Sorrows all nature fell with
[1:17:40] fell with it sin was an anesthetic that
[1:17:43] actually paralyzed the Earth
[1:17:45] and then we
[1:17:48] were set here hopeless
[1:17:50] because every creature on Earth was
[1:17:52] subject to it and everyone born on Earth
[1:17:54] was subject to it so it had to come from
[1:17:58] some place where there was no sin
[1:18:02] I like that statement it had to come
[1:18:04] from some place where there was no sin I
[1:18:08] want to let you know you have come from
[1:18:10] some place where there was no sin
[1:18:14] and this morning you're on your way back
[1:18:16] to that same place where there was no
[1:18:19] sin
[1:18:21] Hallelujah that's why even in scripture
[1:18:24] even if you fell in sin if you bring it
[1:18:27] underneath the blood there is nothing
[1:18:28] against you God does not hold it against
[1:18:31] you he drops it into a sea of
[1:18:33] forgetfulness
[1:18:35] and post a sign up say no fishing
[1:18:42] come on somebody amen we're going back
[1:18:45] to a place where there is no sin no
[1:18:48] sickness no disease no war no covet
[1:18:52] praise God we are on our way back to
[1:18:55] that place
[1:18:58] we come from God we're going back to God
[1:19:08] from a place
[1:19:10] from some place where there was no sin
[1:19:13] it could not come from the Earth
[1:19:15] one of us could not redeem the other
[1:19:19] amen it had to come from another
[1:19:22] therefore when man realized that he was
[1:19:24] separated from his God
[1:19:26] he become a Wanderer
[1:19:28] they wept they cried they toiled they
[1:19:30] wandered about through the mountains and
[1:19:32] and through the desert seeking a city
[1:19:34] who's building making was God for he
[1:19:36] knew that if he ever got back in the
[1:19:39] presence of God he could talk it over
[1:19:41] with him but there was no way back Jesus
[1:19:45] is the way
[1:19:48] he became he become lost
[1:19:51] amen he didn't know which way to turn so
[1:19:55] he just took out
[1:19:56] wandering trying to find somewhere that
[1:19:59] he could find a way back to that place
[1:20:01] something on the inside of him told him
[1:20:04] that he come from a place that was
[1:20:06] perfect
[1:20:10] foreign
[1:20:13] from this quote as we realize we needed
[1:20:16] a savior
[1:20:18] not just a savior but these things
[1:20:21] because man could not
[1:20:24] save himself
[1:20:26] Hallelujah man cannot redeem himself
[1:20:32] he needed a redeemer
[1:20:34] so it excites our heart when we read and
[1:20:38] look to that the Savior was born
[1:20:42] blessed be the name of the Lord but I
[1:20:45] want to amen just present to you this
[1:20:47] morning God began to tell the story of
[1:20:50] Luke 2.
[1:20:52] through characters of the scriptures
[1:20:55] amen God began to tell a story of
[1:20:58] Salvation and Redemption through various
[1:21:00] characters that we find in Scripture
[1:21:03] one of them amen that we can look at is
[1:21:06] a guy by the name of Joshua
[1:21:09] his his name
[1:21:11] actually meant
[1:21:14] Jehovah savior
[1:21:17] he was given a name amen that that tithe
[1:21:21] salvation even in his name
[1:21:25] certain things that happened in Joshua's
[1:21:28] life
[1:21:28] that caused this attribute of Salvation
[1:21:31] to be expressed
[1:21:34] stay with me just for a little bit
[1:21:37] Joshua amen was uh and and my I didn't
[1:21:42] think about this till right now but you
[1:21:44] know before Moses left the city
[1:21:46] he established that Joshua will lead the
[1:21:50] people
[1:21:50] can I put it this way they had a
[1:21:53] succession play
[1:21:57] but the people wanted to see the same
[1:21:59] God of Moses dwelling inside of Joshua
[1:22:04] and they told us if we see God in you we
[1:22:06] will follow just like we did Moses
[1:22:10] do God had to do certain things in
[1:22:12] Joshua's Ministry to elevate him
[1:22:15] so the people could see that it was
[1:22:17] nothing but God
[1:22:21] the time in Joshua's Ministry
[1:22:26] deal with some of the the people that
[1:22:28] are in the land and don't do this and
[1:22:30] don't do that and Joshua got a little
[1:22:32] excited and they got ahead of the plan
[1:22:34] of God
[1:22:35] and uh he let these gibbyanites come
[1:22:37] amongst them and they tricked them they
[1:22:39] they brought all this old stuff and old
[1:22:41] shoes and and and old Tupperware cases
[1:22:44] and and all kind of stuff like this
[1:22:46] they're bringing
[1:22:47] and they say oh we've been on a long
[1:22:49] journey and before you know it Joshua
[1:22:52] felt for the story Hallelujah and he
[1:22:55] made a deal with these people
[1:22:57] my God had come to find out after he
[1:22:59] made the deal they were his neighbors
[1:23:01] they had tricked
[1:23:06] well
[1:23:07] the same group of group of people got in
[1:23:09] trouble one day
[1:23:11] because somebody else heard about them
[1:23:13] and there was this these kings that came
[1:23:14] against them they wanted to fight them
[1:23:16] and as they come against them we pick it
[1:23:18] up in Joshua chapter 10 verse 6. they
[1:23:21] they begin to a man cry for Joshua to
[1:23:25] come and help them remember his name
[1:23:28] meant Jehovah savior
[1:23:32] right here in verse 6 and Joshua 10 it
[1:23:35] says and the man of gibeon
[1:23:37] sent unto Joshua
[1:23:40] to the camp to give God now let's just
[1:23:42] pause there just for a second
[1:23:44] these men were in trouble
[1:23:47] and these men knew that they could not
[1:23:49] get help up from One Source
[1:23:52] and that was that Source was the
[1:23:54] children of Israel there are people in
[1:23:57] your life right now
[1:23:59] they know exactly who to call when
[1:24:03] trouble strikes
[1:24:06] they don't even pray themselves
[1:24:10] but they asked you to pray because they
[1:24:13] know you can get in contact with God
[1:24:16] they know you have a special
[1:24:18] relationship with God
[1:24:21] they can see his attributes oozing out
[1:24:25] of you
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] they know exactly where to go when
[1:24:31] they're in trouble
[1:24:39] to the camp
[1:24:40] to gildall said slack not thy hand from
[1:24:44] thy servants
[1:24:46] come up to us quickly
[1:24:49] and do what
[1:24:52] his name meant
[1:24:56] Jehovah's savior
[1:24:59] and here right in the scripture he's
[1:25:01] been asked to express this attribute
[1:25:08] you know uh I mean
[1:25:12] let's just keep reading let's just keep
[1:25:15] I'm telling the story of these savior
[1:25:18] was told to many characters in the Old
[1:25:20] Testament and if it was told in their
[1:25:22] lives that story didn't end then the
[1:25:26] story is still going on
[1:25:27] it's going on in you you don't realize
[1:25:29] it but the story is going on in you
[1:25:34] it helps us look at our trials a little
[1:25:36] different
[1:25:37] it says uh coming to us quickly and save
[1:25:40] us and help us for all the things of all
[1:25:44] the kings of the amorites that dwell in
[1:25:46] the mountains that gather together
[1:25:47] against us
[1:25:48] so they called for Joshua to come and
[1:25:51] save them
[1:25:53] they needed a deliverer
[1:25:55] they need it they needed help they
[1:25:58] needed someone that could that could
[1:26:00] that could get the job done Hallelujah
[1:26:02] and Joshua representing Christ
[1:26:06] stepped in as Savior
[1:26:09] let's look at this the way of a true
[1:26:10] prophet of God brother Brandon makes a
[1:26:12] statement here
[1:26:17] then I gave the illustration of how that
[1:26:19] Israel on the march to the promised land
[1:26:23] they had never seen that land they know
[1:26:25] nothing about it they just had a promise
[1:26:27] of God there was a land that was full of
[1:26:29] milk and honey and God uh and good in a
[1:26:32] great place they never had it nobody had
[1:26:35] ever been there and know nothing about
[1:26:37] it but they had the promise of it and by
[1:26:39] faith Glory they sojourned through the
[1:26:43] desert and when they got right to the
[1:26:46] borderline amen they had a warrior there
[1:26:48] by the name of Joshua which means
[1:26:52] Jehovah's savior so he crossed over the
[1:26:54] over the Jordan into the promised land
[1:26:57] and brought back the evidence that the
[1:26:59] land was was there I like that and it
[1:27:02] was a good Land Two Men packed one bunch
[1:27:04] of grapes it was a good land so he
[1:27:06] brought back the evidence that the land
[1:27:08] that they were going to possess was dead
[1:27:12] it says now to the church
[1:27:15] we adjourning to the land of immortality
[1:27:18] a land where there's no death amen a
[1:27:22] land where the Dead's raised up and we
[1:27:25] had a great savior in our camp
[1:27:28] Jesus means Jehovah savior beloved and
[1:27:33] he crossed the Jordan of death over into
[1:27:36] the other land and came back and come
[1:27:38] back and brought the evidence that we
[1:27:40] live after death
[1:27:42] amen so where's death at
[1:27:46] Joshua perfect height of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:49] Cross Jordan and Jordan representative
[1:27:52] death
[1:27:53] he crossed Jordan and brought back a
[1:27:55] good report that the land was was
[1:27:56] flowing with milk and honey
[1:27:58] man also Jesus went across Jordan when
[1:28:02] he died in that tomb he went across
[1:28:04] Jordan and he rose again after the third
[1:28:06] day and he proved that the land was good
[1:28:09] on the other side of death
[1:28:11] Glory the land is good for the believer
[1:28:14] on the other side of death
[1:28:16] amen it's an eternal land where we never
[1:28:19] get sick and won't have to die again
[1:28:22] amen it truly is a land flowing with
[1:28:24] milk and honey
[1:28:27] God began to tell the story of
[1:28:30] redemption and salvation through these
[1:28:31] various characters
[1:28:33] of scripture
[1:28:35] I told you I was reading a scripture
[1:28:38] and when I read it I don't know how many
[1:28:41] times I read my Bible and read over that
[1:28:43] scripture but it just I overlooked it
[1:28:46] and then the Holy Spirit kind of pointed
[1:28:48] something to me here
[1:28:50] and I want to read it for you and
[1:28:51] hopefully you'll see what I see
[1:28:54] Nehemiah chapter 9.
[1:28:59] we'll start at verse 24.
[1:29:11] Nehemiah 9 and verse 24. says so the
[1:29:16] children went in and possessed the land
[1:29:20] and thou subdue us before them
[1:29:22] the inhabitants of the land the canines
[1:29:25] and gave us them into their hands with
[1:29:28] their kings and the people of the land
[1:29:30] that they might do with them as they
[1:29:33] would
[1:29:34] and they took strong cities
[1:29:38] and a fat land and possessed Houses full
[1:29:41] of good full of all Goods whales dig
[1:29:44] Vineyards and Olive yards and fruit
[1:29:47] trees in abundance
[1:29:48] so they did even and were filled and
[1:29:52] became fat
[1:29:54] and delighted themselves in thy great
[1:29:56] goodness
[1:29:58] nevertheless
[1:29:59] they were disobedient
[1:30:02] and rebelled against thee and cast thy
[1:30:05] law behind their backs and slew thy
[1:30:07] prophets which testified against them to
[1:30:10] turn them to thee and they wrought great
[1:30:13] provocation
[1:30:16] this is the verse that got me
[1:30:19] therefore thou deliverest
[1:30:22] into the hand of their enemies who
[1:30:24] fetched them and uh and in the time of
[1:30:29] their trouble when they Cried unto thee
[1:30:32] thou hearkenness
[1:30:34] I mean thou heard a stem from heaven and
[1:30:37] according to thy manifold Mercies
[1:30:41] thou
[1:30:43] gave us them
[1:30:50] thou gavest them saviors
[1:30:53] who saved them out of the hand of the
[1:30:57] Indians so if I could just put it this
[1:30:59] way the savior
[1:31:01] gave
[1:31:03] saviors
[1:31:07] is that what we read in scriptures
[1:31:09] thou gave us some savior so the Savior
[1:31:12] gave savings
[1:31:15] then the question becomes who are these
[1:31:20] who are these saviors because it's
[1:31:22] pluralized
[1:31:27] who are these saviors that the Savior
[1:31:30] came the attribute of Salvation that's
[1:31:33] flowing through somebody
[1:31:37] [Applause]
[1:31:40] when they found themselves in trouble
[1:31:44] this attribute would be expressed
[1:31:49] when we just you know look at this I
[1:31:52] went to the Greek Lexicon and amen and I
[1:31:55] just kind of looked at that word savior
[1:31:57] it says uh
[1:31:59] to say and to be delivered to be
[1:32:01] liberated Amen to uh to be saved in
[1:32:06] battle to be victorious
[1:32:08] right to be saved from moral troubles
[1:32:14] then your pastor comes to the pulpit or
[1:32:17] another Minister comes with the word of
[1:32:19] God maybe your mom or your dad is
[1:32:21] bringing some corrections glory to God
[1:32:24] they don't you don't realize it but an
[1:32:26] attribute has been expressed through
[1:32:27] them to save you from trouble
[1:32:34] and you think they're just picking on
[1:32:36] you no they're saving you from trouble
[1:32:38] they're saving you from heartache
[1:32:39] they're saving you from pain
[1:32:44] this attribute is being expressed
[1:32:46] through somebody
[1:32:49] we can look at various scriptures and
[1:32:50] let's just bear with me we're still
[1:32:52] working taking our time to get there
[1:32:54] all right amen but uh you know when I
[1:32:56] read that script and say wait a minute
[1:32:57] you gave them saviors
[1:33:01] because my thought is that the Savior
[1:33:04] that I meet
[1:33:08] let me just inject a personal testimony
[1:33:11] this is a little personal testimony
[1:33:13] before I even knew
[1:33:17] it's roughly four or five years old
[1:33:20] somewhere in that range I don't even
[1:33:21] remember the age that I was
[1:33:23] but
[1:33:24] um
[1:33:25] I was
[1:33:27] my mom had took me over to my aunt's
[1:33:29] house and my cousins were responsible
[1:33:32] for watching me they were older than I
[1:33:33] am a few years older than I am uh three
[1:33:36] of my girl cousins and they had to watch
[1:33:38] me this day and they decided they wanted
[1:33:40] to go to the pool
[1:33:42] and uh none of my cousins could swim
[1:33:46] I couldn't swim but I could play in the
[1:33:48] pool
[1:33:49] and as I went there to the pool uh I
[1:33:53] didn't get in and my cousins they stayed
[1:33:55] in the shallow end of the water
[1:33:57] and uh and what they did what they told
[1:33:59] me that says uh you know you're just
[1:34:01] gonna be careful you stay there on the
[1:34:02] shower and so I would take a rock and I
[1:34:04] would throw it down in the pool and I'd
[1:34:06] scoop it out and I threw another rock in
[1:34:08] tonight scoop it out and you know and
[1:34:10] eventually it got boring because this is
[1:34:12] a shallow end
[1:34:13] I want to go to the deep end I want to
[1:34:15] throw it in a little deeper
[1:34:17] and I would I would just Edge my way
[1:34:19] down to the and my cousin like be
[1:34:21] careful be careful I'm like well I am
[1:34:22] and I'll throw a rock in and scoop it
[1:34:24] out
[1:34:25] I throw it in and scoop it out and I
[1:34:26] finally got to the six feet where it's
[1:34:28] been really deep and I said I threw that
[1:34:30] rock in and I went to scooping out
[1:34:33] and the only thing I remember from that
[1:34:36] moment is waking up in the lap of a
[1:34:38] fireman
[1:34:42] and uh they told me what had happened
[1:34:44] because I had no clue what my my cousins
[1:34:47] they they saw me uh fall in they can't
[1:34:51] swim they see me there at the bottom of
[1:34:53] the pool and they said it just so
[1:34:55] happened that the Lifeguard
[1:34:57] oh my was skating by at the time and as
[1:35:02] she was skating by she realized what had
[1:35:05] happened and she wasn't even on duty but
[1:35:08] she threw off one skate but couldn't get
[1:35:10] the other skate off
[1:35:12] and she jumped in the water a man with
[1:35:15] one skate on and she got me out of the
[1:35:17] water my cousins were calling 9-1-1 and
[1:35:20] then they had the police coming in the
[1:35:22] fire department everybody was there when
[1:35:23] I looked at me the whole neighborhood
[1:35:25] was out there
[1:35:28] but that that young lady jumped in the
[1:35:31] pool and she got me out and and somehow
[1:35:33] they they got the water out of my lungs
[1:35:35] and and I'm here today I don't know how
[1:35:38] all I can say is the grace of God that
[1:35:39] that got me here
[1:35:43] but can I put it in these turns before I
[1:35:46] knew these pages
[1:35:48] God had to send me a savior
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:56] I don't even know her name
[1:35:59] I don't know I wouldn't know what she
[1:36:01] looked like but that day that lady was a
[1:36:05] savior to me she was a deliverer to me
[1:36:11] she don't even know whose life she saved
[1:36:21] Minister might have had experiences like
[1:36:23] this
[1:36:25] and we don't realize it was the
[1:36:26] attribute of God being expressed in this
[1:36:28] situation
[1:36:30] oh but you see you understand
[1:36:32] I thank the Lord for for her
[1:36:35] I appreciate what she did
[1:36:37] but I didn't know Jesus at the time
[1:36:40] and I like to say it like this
[1:36:42] why would I need Jesus
[1:36:45] why was she not good enough
[1:36:50] why was she not good enough you see I
[1:36:53] read it earlier man cannot redeem man
[1:36:57] cannot save man from sin so I needed
[1:37:01] Jesus because I was sinking
[1:37:05] deep in sin
[1:37:08] I was far from the peaceful Joy
[1:37:11] very deeply staying with him I was
[1:37:15] seeking to rise no more
[1:37:19] the master
[1:37:21] [Applause]
[1:37:24] but the master of the sea heard my
[1:37:28] despairing cry and from the waters
[1:37:32] blessed be the name of the Lord from the
[1:37:35] Waters of sin he Lifted Me
[1:37:41] now say to my
[1:37:50] mind
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:59] in the Lexicon when I clicked on that
[1:38:01] word he gave them saviors
[1:38:05] the Lexicon took me to a number of
[1:38:07] scriptures and I'll just share a couple
[1:38:08] of them with you but one of them was in
[1:38:09] Exodus 2. in verse 12.
[1:38:13] it says
[1:38:15] and the Shepherds came
[1:38:18] and drove them away
[1:38:20] but Moses stood up
[1:38:23] and helped them
[1:38:25] and water their flocks so when Moses was
[1:38:27] helping the daughters of Jethro
[1:38:29] they needed help
[1:38:31] they needed somebody they were in
[1:38:33] trouble amen the other shepherds are
[1:38:35] just taken advantage of them they needed
[1:38:37] someone to step up and do something when
[1:38:38] the Bible says that Moses helped them
[1:38:40] Moses actually became
[1:38:43] a savior
[1:38:50] God himself expressed this amen out to
[1:38:53] the children of Israel in Exodus 14 30.
[1:38:55] it was an expression you see a savior
[1:38:58] and let me just put it this way a savior
[1:39:00] is willing to risk their life
[1:39:02] a savior is willing to risk their own
[1:39:05] a savior is willing to amen give
[1:39:08] everything they got that young lady
[1:39:09] jumped in the water with a skate on she
[1:39:11] was willing to risk it off for me
[1:39:13] not knowing what she was doing
[1:39:16] oh my
[1:39:17] God maybe someday I'll meet her I don't
[1:39:19] know
[1:39:20] but it's I if I don't okay it's fine
[1:39:23] I'll shake her hand and say thank you
[1:39:25] but then I like to introduce her to
[1:39:29] me
[1:39:33] the savior
[1:39:36] I could show her our actions
[1:39:39] we're typifying Christ typing Christ but
[1:39:42] we need Jesus
[1:39:48] and
[1:39:52] the Israel he was a savior to Israel
[1:39:54] that day out of the hand of the
[1:39:57] Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians
[1:39:59] dead upon the seashore
[1:40:02] this is all when when they walk through
[1:40:04] the Red Sea and and God made a way for
[1:40:07] the children of Israel but he didn't
[1:40:08] make a way for pharaoh and his army
[1:40:10] he made a way for them to be defeated
[1:40:13] when he opened the waters and then
[1:40:15] closed him God saved Israel he became
[1:40:19] their savior
[1:40:21] their back was against the wall they
[1:40:23] needed help from somewhere
[1:40:27] let's go a little further
[1:40:31] this is another one I'll just read it
[1:40:33] really quick second Kings 13. verse one
[1:40:36] through five
[1:40:37] Second Kings 13.
[1:40:41] and the three and twentieth year of
[1:40:43] joash
[1:40:44] the southern Azariah king of Judah
[1:40:46] Jehoshaphat the son of jehu began to
[1:40:48] Reign Over Israel and Samaria and Reign
[1:40:51] 17 years and he did that which was even
[1:40:54] the sight of the Lord and followed the
[1:40:56] sins of jeroboam the son of Nevada which
[1:40:58] made Israel a sin he departed not there
[1:41:00] from and the anger of the Lord was
[1:41:02] kindled against Israel and he delivered
[1:41:04] them into the hand of haziel king of
[1:41:07] Syria and into the hand of benedett the
[1:41:09] son of haziel all their days and jehoiah
[1:41:13] has uh Basalt the Lord and the Lord
[1:41:15] hearkened unto him for he saw the
[1:41:18] oppression of Israel because the kingdom
[1:41:20] of Syria the king of Syria oppressed
[1:41:22] them look at this
[1:41:24] and the Lord
[1:41:26] gave Israel
[1:41:28] a savior
[1:41:31] so that they went out from under the
[1:41:33] hand of the syrians and the children of
[1:41:35] Israel dwelt in their tents Before Time
[1:41:38] God raised a deliverer up in Israel to
[1:41:41] deliver them God raised a savior
[1:41:46] it's right there in the scripture
[1:41:47] brother Branham makes this point to us
[1:41:50] in the faith of Abraham look at this
[1:41:51] look at what he says
[1:41:54] when you're saved
[1:41:56] God gives you a checkbook
[1:41:59] at the bottom of it it's got Jesus's
[1:42:02] name signed on every check any
[1:42:05] Redemptive blessing belongs to you
[1:42:11] are you afraid to fill it out
[1:42:16] and Abraham's children are you afraid he
[1:42:19] won't recognize the name of Jesus
[1:42:23] whatever you ask the father in my name
[1:42:26] that I will do that's the promise
[1:42:29] you're Abraham's children
[1:42:31] you're not afraid to fill it out the
[1:42:34] bank of heaven will recognize the name
[1:42:37] of Jesus on any Redemptive blessing that
[1:42:41] the body's sitting at the right hand of
[1:42:43] God making intercession for
[1:42:46] that's what he died for
[1:42:50] now Abraham
[1:42:53] sure he was heir
[1:42:55] then after a while lot got in trouble
[1:42:58] now we'll close in a minute lot got in
[1:43:00] trouble and you always get in trouble
[1:43:03] when you backslide
[1:43:06] wish we had time to dwell on that but he
[1:43:09] got in trouble what happened the enemy
[1:43:11] come and picked him off
[1:43:14] now Abraham
[1:43:17] played the part
[1:43:20] of the savior
[1:43:23] again
[1:43:28] brother Brahm of you
[1:43:30] Abraham played the part of Savior when
[1:43:34] life got himself in trouble when the
[1:43:36] when the armies came and and took over
[1:43:38] of the land that he was dwelling in and
[1:43:40] Abraham couldn't find anything but a few
[1:43:43] servants and some some tools in the bomb
[1:43:47] and he went down and got like rescued
[1:43:50] Abraham became Lots
[1:43:55] Abraham was a lot safer if he was
[1:43:59] looking for a Godless skin on him he
[1:44:00] needed to look no further than Abraham
[1:44:09] and if we're Abraham's seeking
[1:44:13] and we know we are Abraham's seat this
[1:44:15] if the attribute was expressed in
[1:44:17] Abraham that same attribute is now being
[1:44:20] expressed in and through
[1:44:21] us
[1:44:22] God needs somebody where God needs some
[1:44:25] hands that he can use and a mouth that
[1:44:27] he can use and some feet that he can use
[1:44:32] song say if you can use anything Lord
[1:44:34] you can use you can use me
[1:44:36] let's finish reading this quote Abraham
[1:44:38] played the part of the Savior again he
[1:44:40] garrisoned himself and went after the
[1:44:42] enemy that took away his poor vaccine
[1:44:45] corrupted brother that's what Jesus did
[1:44:47] sickness bound you sin bound you poor
[1:44:49] back to living corrupted and Jesus came
[1:44:52] in and went after you and he brought
[1:44:55] lot back Abraham did right
[1:45:00] I just wanna
[1:45:01] Coast just a little bit here
[1:45:04] a lot was overtaken and captured
[1:45:09] if
[1:45:11] in the city that he was dwelling if he
[1:45:14] or the inhabitants of that City would
[1:45:16] have been strong enough to defeat the
[1:45:18] opposing armies
[1:45:19] then they would have not they would have
[1:45:21] needed anyone greater than who they were
[1:45:24] to bring Deliverance
[1:45:26] but we got to recognize that we need
[1:45:28] someone greater than us
[1:45:32] in order to bring Deliverance there's
[1:45:33] got to be somebody living a little
[1:45:35] higher than us
[1:45:37] hey got a stronger hold on God than us
[1:45:41] this is why your family your friends
[1:45:43] call upon you when they get in trouble
[1:45:46] they know they can't get there
[1:45:47] themselves they need someone stronger
[1:45:50] Deliverance is is in this person here
[1:45:53] salvation is in this person if they
[1:45:55] would get in contact with God on my
[1:45:57] behalf
[1:45:59] I think my situation would change
[1:46:01] it's the attribute of Salvation being
[1:46:04] expressed in and through us
[1:46:08] we can look back in scripture there's so
[1:46:10] many and we just went through the Book
[1:46:11] of Judges we would see where the Bible
[1:46:13] said he gave them saviors all through
[1:46:15] the Book of Judges
[1:46:17] all through the Book of Judges we can
[1:46:19] look at amen
[1:46:22] e Hut
[1:46:24] oh what a I love this one right here
[1:46:26] shamgar
[1:46:29] that attribute was being expressed in
[1:46:31] shamgar he got to a point where he was
[1:46:34] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:46:35] every year I get my crop up to a certain
[1:46:39] spot and I'm looking God has blessed me
[1:46:41] with rain and God has done this and I'm
[1:46:43] ready to reap the Harvest and these
[1:46:46] Philistines that show up and take
[1:46:47] everything for every year I'm tired of
[1:46:50] hiding this and I'm tired of hiding that
[1:46:52] this is my land
[1:46:57] I don't have to apologize to no
[1:46:59] Philistine but dwelling in my land
[1:47:04] and he finally got himself to his body
[1:47:06] saying this is the year die or not I
[1:47:09] will not let another Philistine take my
[1:47:11] Lane
[1:47:12] he had no sword he had no tanning he had
[1:47:15] no gun but he had an ox goal
[1:47:18] he went out there with a lot to go and
[1:47:20] beaten down 600 Philistines and also
[1:47:24] kept his Harvest
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:30] God was a safe to his family
[1:47:34] the attitude was being expressed through
[1:47:36] him
[1:47:39] shamgar bar Barack Gideon Jeff the
[1:47:43] Sampson all of these in the Book of
[1:47:45] Judges we can see clearly
[1:47:48] when the Bible says he gave them saviors
[1:47:50] just take it back to judges
[1:47:53] all of them
[1:47:56] but I showed you how the prophet told us
[1:47:58] that it was also found in Abraham
[1:48:01] there are other characters that we can
[1:48:03] find let's look at
[1:48:07] David
[1:48:13] David got to a situation where he was
[1:48:15] running from Saul
[1:48:18] and while on the Run he was so afraid
[1:48:21] David finds himself actually fighting
[1:48:23] and he's registered in the army of the
[1:48:26] Philistines
[1:48:28] just think about this this man this
[1:48:29] that's supposed to be going against the
[1:48:31] Philistines is registered in the army of
[1:48:33] the Philistines
[1:48:36] and he's a soldier reporting for Duty
[1:48:38] they're getting ready to go to battle
[1:48:40] and he doesn't know who they're going to
[1:48:41] fight he just don't I need to report for
[1:48:42] Duty and when he gets there the uh the
[1:48:45] leaders of the Philistine said no we
[1:48:46] can't let this guy come with us say why
[1:48:48] well you know look he may we're going to
[1:48:50] go against the Israelites so if he gets
[1:48:53] there his heart may turn towards him
[1:48:54] like Israelites did he'll be coming
[1:48:56] against us
[1:48:57] send them back home
[1:48:59] David goes back home and as he's on his
[1:49:02] way back home uh he realizes once he
[1:49:04] gets there that his wife is gone
[1:49:07] children are gone animals are gone
[1:49:10] everything is gone and all of his arm is
[1:49:12] so disappointed and upset with David
[1:49:15] they said we're going to kill you right
[1:49:17] now
[1:49:17] what did you lead us to we're gonna kill
[1:49:19] you right now and the Bible tells us
[1:49:21] that David had to do something that most
[1:49:23] of us are afraid to do
[1:49:26] David had to encourage himself in the
[1:49:30] Lord
[1:49:30] I want to tell you something thanks and
[1:49:33] you're not going to have somebody to Pat
[1:49:34] you on the back every time
[1:49:36] but you got to learn how to encourage
[1:49:38] yourself in God
[1:49:43] at the David and courage himself
[1:49:47] somehow got that man together and said
[1:49:49] let's go and get our families and as
[1:49:51] they were on the way they found this one
[1:49:53] little soldier that had been left behind
[1:49:55] to die and they nourished that Soldier
[1:49:58] back to hell he was a savior to the
[1:50:01] soldiers
[1:50:03] but they nursed him back to health and
[1:50:05] when they nurse him back to health that
[1:50:06] man began to spill all the secrets and
[1:50:09] it says I know exactly where the Army is
[1:50:11] let's go down there and get your get
[1:50:13] your family he said I know exactly where
[1:50:14] they are and when David got there he
[1:50:16] routed the Army and saved everybody that
[1:50:19] was in his family
[1:50:23] the Bible says he recovered all David
[1:50:26] became a savior
[1:50:31] the attribute of Salvation was being
[1:50:33] expressed but notice God needed a
[1:50:35] situation to occur
[1:50:38] this would have never come out of David
[1:50:40] at the situation not been there but the
[1:50:44] situation must present itself
[1:50:47] for the attribute to be expressed
[1:50:56] tired of being
[1:50:59] safe I don't know if we get it
[1:51:01] I don't know if we get it
[1:51:04] uh
[1:51:06] when you have just naturally you're born
[1:51:09] in certain families and in those
[1:51:11] families there are certain genes that
[1:51:12] flow through those families
[1:51:14] certain traits that happen I mean
[1:51:16] sometimes young men and even ladies they
[1:51:18] lose hair at a certain age
[1:51:20] they don't know they don't know what
[1:51:21] happened it was this way yesterday and
[1:51:23] now all of a sudden it's like this what
[1:51:25] happened it's a gene that just kicked in
[1:51:28] it activated
[1:51:31] and let me tell you something when the G
[1:51:32] activates
[1:51:34] your diet can't stop it
[1:51:39] when the gene activates you going to the
[1:51:41] doctor and ask him to give you a special
[1:51:43] feel it will not stop it there is a
[1:51:46] genius in you that's automatic
[1:51:49] come on somebody and there are genes
[1:51:52] from God that are dwelling inside of you
[1:51:55] and they are automatic you cannot stop
[1:51:58] them from being manifested
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:05] just receive Who You Are
[1:52:08] twice
[1:52:15] we don't go around
[1:52:17] with uh t-shirt on
[1:52:20] and an s on our chest
[1:52:24] we don't operate like that
[1:52:27] but you just need to understand that
[1:52:28] there are things that happen in your
[1:52:30] life
[1:52:31] that God is using for his glory
[1:52:34] and it's an attribute that God is
[1:52:37] expressing through you
[1:52:40] let's go a little further
[1:52:46] Joseph
[1:52:50] was thrown into
[1:52:53] a prison
[1:52:55] well actually before he went to the
[1:52:57] prison he was thrown into a ditch
[1:52:59] raised up out of a ditch
[1:53:01] uh sold into slavery
[1:53:10] living in Potiphar's house promoted in a
[1:53:13] prodigal's house demoted to prison
[1:53:16] because potiphan's wife lies on him
[1:53:19] I mean trial after trial after trial
[1:53:22] after trial
[1:53:23] gets to prison
[1:53:25] two men have a dream and he's there
[1:53:28] encouraging them in prison tell me a
[1:53:30] dream
[1:53:30] and uh and maybe we can do something
[1:53:32] about this God gives him the
[1:53:34] interpretation of the dream the Butler
[1:53:35] and the baker he interpreted and when he
[1:53:37] tells amen the butler says now when you
[1:53:39] get out don't forget about me
[1:53:45] man forgets about him but God sends a
[1:53:49] dream
[1:53:49] to Pharaoh in God's timing this
[1:53:53] attribute is about to be expressed
[1:53:57] and in God's timing Here Comes Joseph I
[1:53:59] mean he's down in the prison and and God
[1:54:01] says a pharaoh dream and Pharaoh can't
[1:54:03] get anyone interpreted then the Bible
[1:54:05] says forgive me I remember there was a
[1:54:08] guy in prison when I was in there and he
[1:54:10] told me exactly what's going to happen
[1:54:11] to me and he told about the baker was
[1:54:13] going to happen to him and exactly what
[1:54:15] he said happened say go get that fella
[1:54:17] bring him out of there right now
[1:54:19] brought him up to Pharaoh's
[1:54:21] ferals interpret the dream the dream
[1:54:22] pharaoh and and as he's interpreted uh
[1:54:24] he gives him one last piece of advice on
[1:54:26] his way back to prison he's he says now
[1:54:28] if I were you
[1:54:29] I would find the wildest man in this
[1:54:31] Kingdom and make sure you put him in
[1:54:32] charge in order to while you got years
[1:54:34] of plenty make sure he has everything
[1:54:37] ready before the years of famine come
[1:54:39] and Pharaoh says okay thank you good
[1:54:41] advice and then he looks around and says
[1:54:42] is there anybody anybody wait wait don't
[1:54:44] go anywhere anybody anybody here why is
[1:54:48] it in this man
[1:54:51] anybody
[1:54:53] nobody okay
[1:54:56] he will not go back to prison
[1:54:59] he's actually going to second in charge
[1:55:02] from prison to power
[1:55:07] and here is Joseph in his position
[1:55:11] and he's thinking he's doing very well
[1:55:13] until one day visitors special visitors
[1:55:17] show up
[1:55:19] these visitors are his
[1:55:21] Blood Brothers
[1:55:23] he recognizes them I'm not see them for
[1:55:26] years and it begins to work with them
[1:55:27] and work with them and start asking
[1:55:29] questions about the daddy and other
[1:55:30] brothers and all this and he said he
[1:55:32] says okay he says my dad is still open I
[1:55:34] got to figure out a way to get him here
[1:55:35] to to Egypt
[1:55:38] through that
[1:55:40] that God drove amen his father and his
[1:55:44] brother and all their families right
[1:55:46] back into Joseph's care
[1:55:48] and let me tell you something amen I
[1:55:50] want to pick this up in the scripture
[1:55:51] Genesis uh 50 verse 17. amen uh Joseph
[1:55:56] is sitting there amen and Justin join us
[1:55:58] with all his brothers and one day his
[1:56:00] dad actually passes away
[1:56:03] and his brothers realized oh Joseph's
[1:56:05] gonna get us now
[1:56:07] he only was nice to us while Daddy was
[1:56:09] alive but oh my everything coming back
[1:56:10] on us now we got to come up with some
[1:56:12] plan to get Joseph to not do anything to
[1:56:15] us look at what Joseph says let me tell
[1:56:18] you something before we get there a
[1:56:19] savior
[1:56:21] has already endured certain things that
[1:56:25] forms their character
[1:56:32] it forms your cat
[1:56:35] you don't respond to things the way
[1:56:37] other people respond to it you don't
[1:56:40] look at things even the way other people
[1:56:42] look at it you've gone through certain
[1:56:43] things in your life and it has formed
[1:56:45] and made you like Christ
[1:56:51] look at what happened to Joseph look at
[1:56:53] this Joseph Genesis 15 verse 17 so shall
[1:56:57] ye sing unto Joseph his brothers have
[1:56:58] come up with this scheme so shall you
[1:57:00] saying that Joseph forgive I pray thee
[1:57:03] now the trespass of thy Brethren and
[1:57:05] their sin for they did unto the evil and
[1:57:09] now we pray thee forgive the trespasses
[1:57:11] of the trespass of the Servants of the
[1:57:13] god of thy father and Joseph's wept when
[1:57:16] they speak unto
[1:57:18] and his brothers and his Brethren also
[1:57:21] went and fell down before his face and
[1:57:23] they said behold we be thy servants and
[1:57:26] Joseph said unto them
[1:57:28] not
[1:57:30] for am I in the place of God
[1:57:34] but as for you
[1:57:36] he thought evil against me but God meant
[1:57:41] it unto good
[1:57:43] to bring to pass as it is this day
[1:57:49] to do what
[1:57:55] to say much people alive
[1:57:59] this attribute of Salvation is now being
[1:58:03] expressed after Joseph have gone through
[1:58:07] trial after trial after he's gone
[1:58:09] through test after test it has formed
[1:58:12] and made his character
[1:58:17] God did this
[1:58:20] this when I went into the the pit it
[1:58:22] wasn't you put me in there God did that
[1:58:26] when you sold me amen into slavery it
[1:58:29] wasn't you coming up with that that
[1:58:30] thought it was God that did that
[1:58:34] God did that because this day he knew
[1:58:37] there would be a famine in the landing
[1:58:38] that to have somebody
[1:58:42] saved
[1:58:48] to save much people alive
[1:58:51] verse 21 now therefore fear you not
[1:58:53] I would nurse you and your little ones
[1:58:56] and he confront he confronted them and
[1:58:58] speak kindly unto them
[1:58:59] I I I I got I got I got I got more Let
[1:59:03] me let me uh slip there's let me I gave
[1:59:07] you a couple couple men that we saw this
[1:59:09] this attribute going through but let me
[1:59:11] let me just let's let's just pick up
[1:59:12] pick up two two sisters in the scripture
[1:59:17] one of them
[1:59:19] she had a really really bad testimony
[1:59:27] but let's talk about the other one that
[1:59:28] had a good testimony first
[1:59:32] she was told by her uncle
[1:59:36] don't reveal Who You Are
[1:59:38] don't tell anybody who you are
[1:59:41] we know the king is looking for a new
[1:59:43] Queen vashti will not come before the
[1:59:45] king she she was doing her own thing
[1:59:46] amen but we we needed he put her down so
[1:59:49] I'm gonna get myself a new Queen at the
[1:59:51] advice of his servants and uh and they
[1:59:53] said okay and and when they went looking
[1:59:55] for all the virgins in the land Mahdi
[1:59:57] found Esther and Esther please the king
[2:00:01] blessed be the name of the Lord and here
[2:00:03] Esther now amen actually please the king
[2:00:05] she's being promoted to Queen but she
[2:00:07] has not revealed who she is
[2:00:10] oh I know who I am
[2:00:12] but she has not revealed who she is and
[2:00:15] then there comes a time that trouble
[2:00:17] strikes Haman decides that he is so
[2:00:20] upset with this one guy Mordecai he will
[2:00:24] not bow every time I come around this
[2:00:26] guy stands with his head up he will not
[2:00:28] bow everybody else is bound but I'm
[2:00:30] tired of this guy
[2:00:31] I'm going to take him out and everybody
[2:00:33] that's like him I'm taking him out now
[2:00:35] did not realize Mordecai was related
[2:00:38] to Esther
[2:00:40] and in the Kingdom
[2:00:43] there were only two people
[2:00:45] higher than Haman
[2:00:48] that was the king
[2:00:50] and Esther
[2:00:52] this is why Esther a man when she was
[2:00:55] told by by Mordecai now now this guy has
[2:00:59] put this eating cow he's gonna kill
[2:01:01] every Jew now I know you haven't
[2:01:02] revealed your identity but don't think
[2:01:05] you're safe in The King's path once they
[2:01:07] realize who you are they'll come after
[2:01:09] you too it says the why did how do you
[2:01:11] know that God did not bring you to the
[2:01:14] kingdom for such a time as this
[2:01:19] she says okay y'all faster you're gonna
[2:01:21] pray for me
[2:01:22] and uh three days I'm going to I'm going
[2:01:25] to see the king and look look don't
[2:01:27] notice the words
[2:01:28] if I perish
[2:01:31] let me perish
[2:01:33] why would she say that because a savior
[2:01:38] is willing
[2:01:40] to give their all our savior went to a
[2:01:43] cross and gave his arm
[2:01:46] so a savior when this attribute is being
[2:01:49] expressed a savior will give their all
[2:01:54] she says if I perish
[2:01:57] let me perish
[2:01:59] but I'm gonna go in and see the game
[2:02:01] and and I want to tell you something
[2:02:04] Esther thought in her mind
[2:02:08] that God's purpose for her
[2:02:11] was to be Queen
[2:02:15] but God actually had a higher purpose
[2:02:18] than Queen
[2:02:20] and he put s in the positions that she's
[2:02:22] the only one that could stand in the gap
[2:02:27] his his in God's mind he wanted Esther
[2:02:31] to be the savior
[2:02:33] and only she could save the people
[2:02:38] invited came into the house and
[2:02:42] Finally Revealed
[2:02:44] revealed my all the Gallows that Haman
[2:02:47] built for everybody else
[2:02:48] he got hung on himself
[2:02:51] but there was a savior in shushan the
[2:02:54] past
[2:02:56] her name happened to be estas
[2:03:01] this other lady in scripture she really
[2:03:03] had a bad reputation
[2:03:07] of all reputation
[2:03:14] but one day she heard
[2:03:17] that there were two spies coming out of
[2:03:19] Israel
[2:03:21] coming in the spot of land and now and
[2:03:23] she already knew because she knew the
[2:03:25] word on the street was
[2:03:27] when Israel comes we're finished there's
[2:03:30] nothing we can do to fight against them
[2:03:31] their God is too big for us so she said
[2:03:34] let me get these two spies have them
[2:03:36] into my house and let me have a
[2:03:37] conversation with them I'm not looking
[2:03:39] for customers
[2:03:43] I'm looking for salvation
[2:03:49] and she hid those spies and as she hit
[2:03:52] them you know they come in and she hit
[2:03:54] them and and then uh uh uh they said
[2:03:57] look look rehab this is what you got to
[2:03:58] do you know if uh if you want salvation
[2:04:01] because we're going to come we're going
[2:04:02] to take this and she'll say I know
[2:04:03] everybody here knows it y'all gonna take
[2:04:05] the city but I just want my house to be
[2:04:07] safe give me a token
[2:04:09] give me a token that you won't destroy
[2:04:11] my house and I love this she took that
[2:04:13] red that Scarlet threat throw it outside
[2:04:15] the window like they told her and they
[2:04:17] said they told us that anybody that you
[2:04:19] can get into the house
[2:04:23] will also receive salvation
[2:04:30] I love the way Rahab did this
[2:04:33] her request was not just for me because
[2:04:36] a savior's not just considering
[2:04:39] themselves
[2:04:40] but her request was
[2:04:42] despair my father
[2:04:44] and we'll just bear my mother we'll just
[2:04:47] spare my brothers and my sisters they
[2:04:50] say anybody you can get within the house
[2:04:55] will be saved
[2:04:56] now this this just blessed me because
[2:04:58] there's a little quote here about rehab
[2:05:00] that I want to share with you
[2:05:03] in God's rap gift
[2:05:08] Rahab the Harlot
[2:05:11] that we're all familiar with
[2:05:13] she being a young girl that was turned
[2:05:15] on the street by a heathen father and
[2:05:17] mother
[2:05:18] that put her on the street because she
[2:05:20] was beautiful
[2:05:22] and was to bring an income to them on
[2:05:24] prostitution
[2:05:26] yet down in this immoral girl that was
[2:05:28] turned on the street
[2:05:30] she had heard that there was a God who
[2:05:32] answered prayer and the first
[2:05:34] opportunity she got to accept that God
[2:05:37] or do something for him she did it
[2:05:40] and God's better life and saved a father
[2:05:42] and mother and a family she fell in love
[2:05:44] with a general in the army of Israel we
[2:05:46] find in the history of Merit this
[2:05:48] general and this courtship was wonderful
[2:05:51] and finally they settled down and lived
[2:05:53] at Bethlehem
[2:05:54] now here's the thing that got me when
[2:05:56] brother Branham says this
[2:05:58] if there was an if there was ever an
[2:06:01] opportunity
[2:06:02] for Rahab to exclude
[2:06:07] her family
[2:06:09] look look my father
[2:06:12] and my mother even agreed to this I did
[2:06:16] not register for this job I didn't sign
[2:06:19] up for this job but yet they they put me
[2:06:22] in this field so they could get money
[2:06:24] into their own house if there was any
[2:06:26] time somebody should have had a reason
[2:06:29] to be upset with their parents it was
[2:06:32] rehab
[2:06:36] because you know oftentimes we hold my
[2:06:38] mama did this and my daddy did that and
[2:06:41] you can be savior to Mom and Daddy
[2:06:43] [Applause]
[2:06:47] right I mean we we get all these uh
[2:06:49] these things on the inside of us and we
[2:06:51] just want to unleash and tell we want to
[2:06:53] tell every counselor what Mama did and
[2:06:56] what Daddy did
[2:06:58] we have such a bitterness and a
[2:06:59] resentment and an anger but not rehab
[2:07:02] and rehab and not even have the Holy
[2:07:05] Ghost
[2:07:06] [Applause]
[2:07:09] but yet she has something on the inside
[2:07:11] of her
[2:07:13] and she looked beyond what Mama did to
[2:07:16] her she Liberia what Daddy did to her
[2:07:19] when the spies came she said is there
[2:07:21] salvation
[2:07:23] can I get a token from me and for my
[2:07:26] father and for my mother can I get
[2:07:29] something but to protect us
[2:07:31] to deliver us to save us
[2:07:37] the same red Scarlet that you let us
[2:07:40] down bye
[2:07:41] that Scarlet thread that you used to let
[2:07:43] us down make sure it's hanging in your
[2:07:45] window whoever you can get into the
[2:07:47] house
[2:07:53] whoever you can get into now they can't
[2:07:56] be outside hanging out hanging out no no
[2:07:58] no they must stay in the house
[2:08:01] salvation can only come to that house
[2:08:04] and if you if Rahab if you can get them
[2:08:07] in the house
[2:08:10] they'll be saved
[2:08:15] maybe the little nephew say I don't want
[2:08:16] to go to Auntie rehab's house
[2:08:19] son
[2:08:22] if you want salvation
[2:08:29] so no arguing no no no no no no I don't
[2:08:32] care what you think about Auntie rehab
[2:08:37] your thoughts mean nothing right now
[2:08:41] salvation is only in one place and and
[2:08:43] now they did not know the strategy of
[2:08:46] Joshua
[2:08:47] the strategy of Joshua was marched
[2:08:48] around the walls
[2:08:50] well one time each day and then on the
[2:08:52] seventh day you're gonna March seven
[2:08:53] times
[2:08:54] and they might run away and said when
[2:08:55] you blow the trumpet you know and tell
[2:08:57] the people don't say a word can you
[2:08:59] imagine that for Six Days Seven Days not
[2:09:01] even talking
[2:09:03] say don't shout until I tell you to
[2:09:05] shout
[2:09:07] and on the seventh day seventh time they
[2:09:09] walked much around that wall and like oh
[2:09:10] we don't know but they see that Scarlet
[2:09:12] thread and they told Joshua exactly
[2:09:14] Joshua mean Jehovah Stadium
[2:09:16] they told Joshua this is what the
[2:09:18] promise that we get see that house right
[2:09:19] there so yeah we see it and God saw it
[2:09:22] too and when they blew the trumpet every
[2:09:25] piece of the wall fell except one piece
[2:09:29] and it's a piece where rahab's house
[2:09:33] is positioned
[2:09:37] race
[2:09:43] was a savior
[2:09:47] to her family
[2:09:53] the scripture says he gave them
[2:10:00] and I want to tell you something it's
[2:10:01] it's easy to leave this sin
[2:10:04] Old Testament
[2:10:05] but I am telling you right now that Gene
[2:10:08] is still activated
[2:10:11] [Applause]
[2:10:30] let me close with this quote
[2:10:35] that Gene is still activated it's in you
[2:10:37] it's in you it's in you it's in you
[2:10:39] sometimes you don't realize what you're
[2:10:41] going through
[2:10:42] don't realize how God has expressing
[2:10:44] himself through you
[2:10:46] but but that that that Gene is still
[2:10:48] here but we point them to the savior
[2:10:51] but don't realize don't don't limit
[2:10:53] yourself he is using you
[2:10:55] and and I read it right there to
[2:10:57] scripture he he gave them
[2:11:02] he gave him
[2:11:04] the Savior sent savior
[2:11:10] sometimes we're so afraid to wear our
[2:11:12] titles
[2:11:15] I'm the bride of Christ
[2:11:18] I'm a son of God
[2:11:20] I'm a daughter of God
[2:11:22] I'm the wife of God
[2:11:29] here this uh
[2:11:33] this quote is out of the deity of Jesus
[2:11:35] Christ and now how close here
[2:11:39] oh my my my my my
[2:11:42] I I'll tell you this
[2:11:45] if I was still in my Baptist Church
[2:11:48] I would have never been able to preach a
[2:11:49] sermon like this
[2:11:52] but because of what God has done with
[2:11:54] his prophet
[2:11:56] and he he has opened this word up to us
[2:11:59] that we begin to see ourselves in the
[2:12:01] scripture
[2:12:04] we begin to see ourselves in the
[2:12:05] scripture like I said at the beginning
[2:12:06] when it says a savior
[2:12:09] in our minds that is the savior we're
[2:12:12] going to fight for Jesus
[2:12:14] but I want to tell you something Jesus
[2:12:16] is also fighting
[2:12:18] for you
[2:12:20] and he wants you to recognize Who You
[2:12:22] Are
[2:12:23] he gave them saviors
[2:12:30] the deed of Jesus Christ that same
[2:12:35] that same Christ Hallelujah
[2:12:38] let them
[2:12:41] let the fundamentals let them people who
[2:12:43] deny the power of God see it's wrong but
[2:12:46] that same power
[2:12:48] that spoke the world into existence
[2:12:52] is in
[2:12:54] those people
[2:12:57] that's got the whole
[2:13:04] that's right men and women it's time
[2:13:08] that we found out who you you are
[2:13:13] the devil's trying to hide you back tell
[2:13:16] you that you're some little drop down
[2:13:19] something you're not
[2:13:22] your sons and daughters of God that
[2:13:24] deity is not in heaven
[2:13:28] well where is it then
[2:13:31] if it's not in heaven where is it
[2:13:35] if brother Branham is off the scene
[2:13:37] where is it
[2:13:39] if Jesus died and rose again some
[2:13:42] thousand years ago where is Piet
[2:13:46] it's not an empty tomb where is deity
[2:13:51] the prophet has given us the answer
[2:13:53] deity is inside of you
[2:14:01] I know who I am
[2:14:06] how do I made myself abuse who God made
[2:14:08] me to be
[2:14:11] I'm not ashamed of who I am
[2:14:17] it is not in heaven it's in you
[2:14:20] Hallelujah
[2:14:23] you see a prophet saying things like
[2:14:25] that in 1949.
[2:14:32] I know you think I'm crazy
[2:14:35] now you know what if if the brother if
[2:14:36] brother Brandon could be here right now
[2:14:38] preaching a sermon and said that we a
[2:14:40] group of people amen
[2:14:42] because it's been preached to you you
[2:14:44] know who you are now
[2:14:47] it says uh what do you think I'm crazy
[2:14:50] but let me tell you something brother
[2:14:51] when you realize
[2:14:53] that almighty God Lives in You
[2:14:56] Immortal Life
[2:14:58] my life I give Zoe the life of God is in
[2:15:01] the human being
[2:15:04] he stood back there he's a creator of
[2:15:07] all things he made life frogs and all
[2:15:09] these ducks and chicks and animals
[2:15:12] created everything and nothing was made
[2:15:14] but was made by him
[2:15:16] who Christ
[2:15:18] the deity he brought down plagues and
[2:15:21] everything in the days of Egypt who
[2:15:23] Christ
[2:15:25] he's top the mouth of lions he quits the
[2:15:28] violence of fire they escape the edge of
[2:15:30] Sword they raise the dead from grave who
[2:15:32] Christ oh my what would it be who is it
[2:15:36] Christ the deity
[2:15:39] brother
[2:15:41] sister
[2:15:44] that deity
[2:15:47] is it you
[2:15:50] here's the scripture a little while and
[2:15:52] the world seeth me no more
[2:15:54] yet ye shall see me
[2:15:57] for I'll be with you
[2:16:00] even in you
[2:16:04] to the End of the Age Christ in the
[2:16:06] manger
[2:16:10] no Christ in you Hallelujah
[2:16:20] Worship in Christ in the manger
[2:16:24] who we worship is it
[2:16:30] but Christ in you
[2:16:33] the Holy Ghost the hope of Life
[2:16:35] Hallelujah I The Creator God himself
[2:16:37] dwelling in the human being
[2:16:42] does not get up here
[2:16:45] what we shall be when you when you get
[2:16:47] your mistake we look at your failures
[2:16:49] you not as bad off as Rahab
[2:16:53] she was still used as a savior
[2:16:58] if God can use a rehab
[2:17:02] he can use you
[2:17:20] the prophecy does not yet appear what we
[2:17:22] shall be but we shall see him as he is
[2:17:25] for we will be made like him I'm telling
[2:17:28] you right now the word of God is forming
[2:17:29] and shaping and molding us into the very
[2:17:31] image
[2:17:33] of Christ
[2:17:38] you're not here to replace Jesus
[2:17:42] but you are here to be just like him
[2:17:48] I believe the scripture says
[2:17:51] Jesus thought it not robbery
[2:17:55] to be just like his father
[2:17:57] he thought of not like and you know look
[2:17:59] I'm gonna tell you in Jesus day he had
[2:18:01] to fight the the the the the leaders in
[2:18:03] of that date because they could not
[2:18:05] understand how this man on Earth could
[2:18:06] claim to be God
[2:18:09] well guess what we're going to fight the
[2:18:10] same fight today how these people you
[2:18:12] you you you you Christ and you look at
[2:18:16] you
[2:18:19] well that's the thing I'm not looking at
[2:18:21] me
[2:18:24] but I am looking at what he has done for
[2:18:27] me
[2:18:28] and because of that I can claim this
[2:18:33] oh blessed be the name of the Lord the
[2:18:36] attribute of salvation
[2:18:38] flowing in and through each one of you
[2:18:41] God bless you church God bless you
[2:18:58] let's have a word of prayer I want to
[2:19:00] ask my daughter to come and sing a song
[2:19:01] for you this morning
[2:19:03] amen
[2:19:05] um
[2:19:05] actually maybe both of them can sing a
[2:19:08] song I'll let Sarah go first and then
[2:19:10] maybe Rebecca could sing something after
[2:19:12] that
[2:19:14] let's pray father
[2:19:19] your word is
[2:19:23] sometimes so challenging
[2:19:26] it challenges our thinking it Channel
[2:19:28] challenges
[2:19:32] Lord just uh what we've been taught over
[2:19:35] the years
[2:19:37] but you sent us a prophet that would go
[2:19:41] to scripture and he would see things
[2:19:43] that the church world was completely
[2:19:45] missing
[2:19:48] and it would try to get us to see who we
[2:19:49] are who we were truly an Eliezer
[2:19:53] that got a Rebecca
[2:19:56] for Isis
[2:20:00] our desire is not Lord Jesus to
[2:20:05] misplace the word of God
[2:20:10] but our desire is truly to find out
[2:20:13] who we are in you
[2:20:17] because the prophet did tell us that
[2:20:18] once the brat recognized
[2:20:21] who she was then
[2:20:24] the Rapture would go
[2:20:27] so help us Lord to see ourselves
[2:20:32] we ask oh God that your blessings would
[2:20:35] just
[2:20:36] lay here at this church
[2:20:38] as I started
[2:20:40] today just thanking them for what we see
[2:20:44] from a distance in this year of
[2:20:46] transition
[2:20:47] God we we see a servant of God a man of
[2:20:51] God that have visited
[2:20:55] the man that could die to himself
[2:20:59] that his thoughts not his ideas and and
[2:21:02] and he had the the people's interests in
[2:21:07] heart
[2:21:08] what an example man for us to to follow
[2:21:11] we see Christ in this man
[2:21:14] it's not really Erickson but it's Christ
[2:21:16] in him
[2:21:18] father as a church continues their
[2:21:21] Journey we pray that you would just
[2:21:23] anoint brother Wayne and continue to
[2:21:26] bless the Lord give him everything he
[2:21:29] needs oh God
[2:21:31] step into the shoes
[2:21:34] that he's been asked to feel
[2:21:36] we pray Lord that the Believers would
[2:21:38] stay United as one in a body
[2:21:41] and at the end it would have no chance
[2:21:44] to come against this church
[2:21:49] you started True Word
[2:21:51] you will keep True Word
[2:21:55] and we thank you Lord for all that
[2:21:57] you've done
[2:22:00] we leave our blessing on this place
[2:22:04] it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:22:08] amen
