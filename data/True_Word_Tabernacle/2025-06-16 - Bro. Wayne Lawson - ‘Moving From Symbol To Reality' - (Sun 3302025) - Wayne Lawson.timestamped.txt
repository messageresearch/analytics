[0:01] One day when heaven
[0:04] was filled with his praisees,
[0:09] one day when sin was as black as could
[0:14] be,
[0:17] Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
[0:25] dwelt among men. My example is here.
[0:33] The word became flesh and the light
[0:38] shined among us. His glory revealed.
[0:46] Living he loved me.
[0:50] Dying he saved me.
[0:54] Mary carried
[0:57] my sin far away. Oh rising
[1:03] justify
[1:10] one day.

[1:13] Oh glorious day.
[1:17] Oh, glorious day.
[1:20] [Applause]
[1:24] [Music]
[1:25] [Applause]
[1:29] Oh, one day they led him up Calary's
[1:35] mountain.
[1:37] One day they nailed him.
[1:41] [Applause]
[1:41] [Music]
[1:45] suffering anguish,
[1:49] despised and rejected,
[1:53] bearing our sins. My redeemer is here.
[2:01] The hand that heal nations,
[2:04] stretch the tree,
[2:08] took the nails for me.
[2:12] Oh living love that stands for the way
[2:16] he comes
[2:19] very

[2:40] Oh, glorious day.
[2:44] Glorious day.
[2:49] [Applause]
[2:50] [Music]
[2:52] Hallelujah. Amen. This is our verse. Oh,
[2:56] one day the grave could conceal him no
[3:01] longer.
[3:04] One day the stone rolled away from the
[3:09] door.
[3:12] Then he arose over death he had conered.
[3:19] Now is ascended.
[3:23] My lord ever more. Oh death could not
[3:29] hold him. The grave could not keep it.
[3:35] Rising again.
[3:39] Living
[3:43] dying he
[3:48] carried
[3:50] my sins far away.
[3:55] Christ he justified
[3:59] freely forever.
[4:02] One day he's coming.
[4:06] Oh glory living he love me. Living he
[4:12] loved me.
[4:14] Dying he saved me.
[4:19] He carried
[4:22] my sins far away.
[4:26] Rising Jesus
[4:30] freely forever.
[4:34] One day he's coming.
[4:37] Oh glorious
[4:39] day.
[4:40] Oh glorious
[4:43] day.
[4:47] Glorious.
[4:49] Glorious day.
[4:55] Glorious.
[4:57] Glorious day.
[5:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. What a what a
[5:06] powerful powerful atmosphere this
[5:09] morning. Amen. In his presence. And it's
[5:12] certainly good to be in the house of
[5:13] God. Amen. And to Amen. And as we bow
[5:16] our hearts, Father, we come into this
[5:17] meeting today, Lord. And Father, we know
[5:20] that the highest order of worship is
[5:23] your word.
[5:24] And Lord, you commanded us that we must
[5:27] worship in spirit and in truth. And I
[5:31] ask you today that your mercy would just
[5:33] come upon your people, Lord, as you
[5:35] would bless them. I ask the spirit of
[5:38] wisdom and revelation, Lord, that it
[5:39] would move upon this church today. I ask
[5:42] you to lead us, Father, in your word
[5:44] that you may bring healing, Lord, and
[5:46] deliverance to those in have need of. We
[5:48] ask you for life, Lord, to be exhibited,
[5:51] Lord, in this sanctuary this morning.
[5:53] That Lord, not only would we preach
[5:56] truth, Lord, but may your great spirit
[5:58] vindicate that word, Lord, that may you
[6:01] bring the spirit of revelation behind
[6:03] it. We ask you now, Lord, as we enter in
[6:06] your word that you would lead us,
[6:07] Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[6:11] And amen. And God bless you. If you have
[6:14] your Bibles today, I'd like to turn to
[6:15] the book of Revelations, the sixth
[6:17] chapter. We have been speaking uh on the
[6:20] opening of the word. Amen. And uh from
[6:22] Revelation chapter 6, I would like to
[6:25] read two verses of scripture. Of course,
[6:28] we have maybe several scriptures to go
[6:30] through today, but uh these would be the
[6:32] place that I would like to start.
[6:33] Revelation 6 and verse one and verse
[6:36] two.
[6:38] And I saw when the lamb
[6:41] opened one of the seals, and I heard as
[6:45] it were the noise of a thunder. Now, one
[6:49] of the four beasts saying, "Come and
[6:52] see." Now, those four beasts are talked
[6:54] about in Revelations the 4th chapter and
[6:56] also in the book of Ezekiel. We know
[6:58] that's a lion, an ox, a man, and an
[7:02] eagle. So, this was the lion that said
[7:05] to him, "Come and see." And I saw, I
[7:08] like that. And I saw, and behold, a
[7:12] white horse,
[7:14] and he that had sat on him had a bow,
[7:17] and a crown was given unto him, and he
[7:20] went forth conquering
[7:23] and to conquer. Amen. May the Lord bless
[7:25] his word this morning. You could be
[7:26] seated. If I could, I want to continue
[7:30] on this the opening of the word, but I
[7:31] would like to speak to you about
[7:32] revelations that are contained under the
[7:36] seals. Revelations contained under the
[7:39] seals. Now, I'm positive as I stand here
[7:42] this morning to you, as positive as I
[7:45] stand here that we know the truth
[7:47] concerning that scripture. Amen. This is
[7:50] uh beyond guesswork. It's beyond uh
[7:53] projected ideas and and this person says
[7:56] this and this person says this. But I
[7:58] believe that we have arrived at a very
[8:00] beautiful time. Uh we appreciate that
[8:02] song very much. Amen. We've arrived at a
[8:05] very beautiful time and we know it's the
[8:07] time but uh of Satan's Eden, but it's
[8:10] also the time of the bride. Amen. And I
[8:13] I'll say that uh we find that this
[8:16] season that we're living in is a season
[8:18] when these things are to be made known
[8:21] and the truth concerning uh the symbols
[8:24] of the Bible is to be open. We find this
[8:27] here in in Revelation chapter 6. We find
[8:30] uh brother Brandon will say it like
[8:31] this. We find the lamb with the book
[8:34] now. And now in the sixth chapter we
[8:36] read. So uh we we we find that the lamb
[8:39] has the book now. Of course, we were
[8:41] just a previous chapter in Revelations,
[8:43] the fifth chapter, and you're seeing,
[8:45] Amen, that there was one there, amen,
[8:47] that had a book, and a book couldn't be
[8:49] looked upon, couldn't be touched. Amen.
[8:51] It was it was held in the hands, and it
[8:53] caused John to weep because nobody was
[8:55] worthy that they could open that book.
[8:58] And and there was an elder among them
[9:00] that said, "Wait a minute. There is one
[9:01] that's worthy. It's the lion, the tribe
[9:04] of Judah." Amen. And when John turned to
[9:06] look, he didn't see a lion, but rather
[9:08] he saw the lamb. Amen. And the lamb was
[9:11] able to take the book. And now starting
[9:12] in the sixth chapter, it begins with the
[9:15] lamb has the book in his hand. That's
[9:17] the way it begins. And then and then
[9:19] when John begins to see it, amen, he
[9:22] sees a symbol go forth. But that's all
[9:24] he writes about is the symbol of it. But
[9:26] the prophet will say this, "I'm as
[9:28] positive as I'm standing here tonight
[9:31] that it came army.
[9:34] I'm not prone, amen, to be a just to be
[9:37] a fanatic." he tells us, but he's
[9:39] positive that he has the revelation
[9:42] concerning what was behind this seal.
[9:46] Now, the seven seal book is a a book uh
[9:49] that is now being released from the
[9:52] lamb. I love how brother Bam keeps
[9:54] pointing back at this in the seal book,
[9:55] and he keeps saying the same point over
[9:57] and over. This sealed book has now been
[10:01] released. This sealed book has now been
[10:03] opened. This sealed book and these
[10:05] things have been sealed. But now I'm
[10:07] positive that I have the revelation on
[10:10] of what it was. Now we never know this
[10:13] before because it was sealed with seven
[10:15] seals. On the back of the book is sealed
[10:18] with seven seals. Now of course in the
[10:20] breach it has told us amen that there
[10:22] was to be a season of course when this
[10:24] title deed that was in the hands of the
[10:27] one upon the throne that it was to be
[10:29] taken. And we found that that was the
[10:31] book in Revelations 5. But we also seen
[10:34] in Revelations 10 that the book would be
[10:36] open. So, Revelations the 6th chapter
[10:39] begins uh with a a lamb speaking to
[10:41] John. Of course, when we're reading this
[10:44] now and we're saying that we're reading
[10:46] this openly, we're we're by um how could
[10:49] I say this? We're automatically saying
[10:52] that we're dealing with Revelations the
[10:53] 10th chapter because in Revelations 10,
[10:56] when the mighty angel comes out of
[10:58] heaven, he comes out of heaven with an
[11:00] open book. So, we realize you can't be
[11:02] speaking about what is in the book till
[11:05] the book is opened up. Now, I'm just
[11:07] simple this way, but you can't talk
[11:09] about, Amen, what is sealed until it's
[11:11] unsealed other than just probing at
[11:14] something. But when the Holy Spirit
[11:16] opens that up, then you're able then to
[11:18] talk about it with shortity and with a
[11:20] positive. And and the prophet will say
[11:22] it like this. We're found out now, of
[11:24] course, that it took that kinsman
[11:26] redeemer to take that book. So this
[11:28] morning we realize that a kinsman showed
[11:31] up on our behalf and we're living in the
[11:34] season of the redemption claims. Now you
[11:36] know, amen, uh from previous teachings,
[11:38] of course, amen, that there is a time
[11:41] that when when Christ came upon the
[11:44] cross and he gave his blood, he gave his
[11:46] life that he might be able to pay the
[11:48] payment of the bride, he might pay the
[11:50] payment of the world. Remember, he went
[11:52] up on the mountain with the devil and
[11:54] the devil tempted him and said, "I'll
[11:56] give it to you." And the Lord said, "No,
[11:58] I won't receive it from you." Because he
[12:01] knew he had to pay a payment for the
[12:03] sins of the world. So, he took it by the
[12:06] cross. That way, that Satan couldn't
[12:08] come back and say, "Well, they owe me
[12:10] this or they owe me this or there
[12:12] there's no leans or no debts upon it
[12:15] because he wouldn't let Satan give it to
[12:17] him." Rather, he paid the payment for it
[12:20] because he was our kinsman redeemer,
[12:22] which we just went through. I'm
[12:23] rehearsing in your mind now. We just
[12:25] went through the book of Ruth, remember?
[12:27] And we found that Boaz had to step
[12:29] forward and make a action, a testimony
[12:32] that Ruth and Naomi are my kin, folks.
[12:35] And when he begin to redeem Naomi, he
[12:38] immediately got Ruth in the bargain.
[12:41] Amen. And the same is it in the last
[12:43] days that God's intention is to redeem
[12:46] Israel. Is that right? Amen. God's
[12:48] intention is to redeem Israel. Amen. But
[12:51] in redeeming Israel, he first takes the
[12:54] gentile bride. And by taking the bride,
[12:57] then he opens the channel, amen, for the
[12:59] redemption, amen, of Israel. Now, now
[13:02] the lamb, the kinsman redeemer had two
[13:05] works. He had to buy the church, but
[13:07] then he comes to claim the church. So
[13:10] this is not a time that when he's going
[13:12] to die on cross no more. It's not a time
[13:14] he's going to make any more payments. He
[13:16] He already paid for the car. He's just
[13:19] coming to pick it up. Amen. He's already
[13:21] bought the the people. He's just coming
[13:23] to make his claim of what he's already
[13:26] paid for. So, he doesn't have to have uh
[13:29] any arguments with the devil. He just
[13:31] produces the papers that it's already
[13:33] been paid for. Amen. In other words,
[13:35] your names were recorded before the
[13:37] foundations of the world. And the
[13:39] payment was made upon the names in that
[13:42] book. So all he has to do in this age is
[13:44] produce the book with those names and
[13:47] those names that qualify you for the
[13:49] resurrection.
[13:51] I'm so glad this morning, amen, that God
[13:54] qualified us in the resurrection. If
[13:56] you're looking for types, you'll find it
[13:58] in the book of Jeremiah when he sells
[14:00] off his property unto his uncle's son
[14:03] knowing there would be a time of
[14:04] redemption coming. There is a purchase
[14:07] and then there's a claim. And we are at
[14:09] the claiming work. Amen. Yeah, we are at
[14:12] the claiming work. Amen. The claiming
[14:15] work of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Is
[14:18] the portion of the second coming that is
[14:21] hidden from the world. Yes, sir. Now,
[14:23] it's promised to be a secret, isn't it?
[14:25] Didn't the Bible say that it would be a
[14:27] secret? Amen. And and we find then this
[14:29] is actually hidden from the world. Most
[14:32] people will never know this taking
[14:33] place. They'll only see tribulation and
[14:35] they'll say, "I thought there was going
[14:37] to be a rapture." But they missed the
[14:40] rapture because they missed the
[14:41] revelation of the son of man. Now this
[14:45] known to us as the claiming work is also
[14:47] known to us as the opening of seven
[14:50] seals or the third pull of William
[14:53] Brandham's ministry. Now we we seen the
[14:55] first pull and the world saw the sign of
[14:57] the hand. What a powerful ministry. And
[15:00] they saw the Messiah sign of him reading
[15:02] the hearts of the people. And people
[15:04] said all over the world, that's exactly
[15:07] the ministry of Jesus Christ in the last
[15:09] days. Exactly it. But it wasn't just a
[15:12] first and a second pull. But Amen. But
[15:15] we found out under the 10th ministry,
[15:17] there would be a third pull to the
[15:19] ministry. It would not be the sign of
[15:21] the hand. It would not be the reading of
[15:23] the heart, but it would be the
[15:25] revelations of this word spoken to us by
[15:29] God's way of doing it. How how many
[15:31] knows God's way of giving revelation to
[15:33] the church. If if you're new and you
[15:35] don't know that, it's the book of Amos,
[15:37] the third chapter. And the Bible said,
[15:39] "Surely the Lord our God will do nothing
[15:41] until first he reveals it unto his
[15:43] servants, the prophets." This is not a
[15:46] newspaper. This is not a history book.
[15:48] This is a book of prophecies that were
[15:51] written by prophecies. Amen. By prophets
[15:54] themselves and can only be interpreted.
[15:56] Somebody said it's God's book, but it
[15:57] was written by the hand of a man. And
[15:59] it's a funny thing to me that we take a
[16:01] a book that was written by God through
[16:03] the hand of a man. Amen. And then we
[16:05] don't want to identify the man that was
[16:07] actually uh wrote. We said, "Well, it's
[16:09] the Bible." But it was the book of
[16:10] Moses. And then it was the writings of
[16:12] Paul. It was the writings of James and
[16:13] John. And men in those seasons had no
[16:16] problems understanding that God used men
[16:19] for those things. But yet some reason in
[16:22] our generation, we think God somehow
[16:24] changed. But let me let me me say this
[16:26] from the Bible. There is one thing that
[16:28] never changes and that is God. God never
[16:32] changes. Amen. His word never changes
[16:35] and the way God does things never
[16:37] changes. All the way back to the book of
[16:39] Deuteronomy. I can read it to you in
[16:41] Deuteronomy 18. The Bible tells us this
[16:43] clearly. It says that God spoke and fear
[16:45] come upon the congregation and they
[16:47] said,"Lord, don't never speak to us this
[16:49] way again." And Moses came unto them and
[16:52] said, "The Lord has heard your prayer
[16:54] and the Lord our God shall raise up a
[16:56] prophet likened unto me." And we seen
[16:58] that prophecy fulfilled in our Lord
[17:01] Jesus Christ, who was the God of the
[17:03] prophets. Is that right? But the Bible
[17:05] predicts to us that in the last days
[17:08] that that same Jesus would be made alive
[17:11] among the church of the living God. In
[17:13] Acts the 3rd chapter, it says that all
[17:15] things must be restored before Jesus
[17:18] could return to the earth. Does it not
[17:20] say it? Does it not say in Luke 17 that
[17:22] the son of man is to be revealed? Does
[17:25] it not say to us in Malachi 4 that the
[17:27] faith should be restored to us like it
[17:30] was in the early church? And it would
[17:32] take the ministry of Jesus Christ to do
[17:34] it. Well, I say to you today, we now
[17:37] have by divine vindication, the same
[17:40] ministry that was on the earth then is
[17:42] on the earth now. He is alive. May I
[17:45] say, I have been to the tomb. He's not
[17:48] there.
[17:50] I have been there. He's not there. I say
[17:53] this, he is alive. And just as real this
[17:56] morning as he was when they put him in
[17:58] the grave, my Jesus is not dead. He is
[18:01] living. He's not in a tomb. He's not,
[18:05] come on now. He's not in a crib in
[18:08] Bethlehem. Neither. Neither is he on a
[18:10] cross. Amen. In Jerusalem, but he's
[18:13] alive this morning. And that body is
[18:15] sitting in heaven. But the spirit that
[18:18] was in that body is right here in the
[18:21] church of the living God. Yet a little
[18:23] while. And the world see me no more, but
[18:25] she shall see me. For I will be with
[18:28] you. Amen. Even in you, even in you
[18:31] until the end of the age. Hallelujah.
[18:34] Hallelujah. He is alive. Amen. Amen.
[18:37] Denomination is a dead core. Amen.
[18:40] Trying to cage our Jesus Christ. But
[18:43] he's still alive.
[18:46] My He's still alive. Hallelujah.
[18:49] People don't want to hear about what he
[18:50] does today. They want to hear about what
[18:51] he done in history.
[18:54] Man is always thanking God for what he
[18:58] did in history and what he will do in
[19:00] the future. But they always miss what
[19:03] he's doing right now. I pray God don't
[19:06] let us miss your word in our age.
[19:12] You said, "Preacher, what are you
[19:14] saying?" I'm saying the third pull of
[19:16] William Brandham's ministry is the
[19:18] current fulfillment of scripture in our
[19:21] day.
[19:23] It's the claiming work of Jesus Christ
[19:27] upon your life and upon my life. We are
[19:31] not claimed. And by by God's grace,
[19:34] we're so glad for all of our Christian
[19:36] brothers. But the Baptist denomination
[19:38] don't claim this people.
[19:41] The Lutheran denomination can't claim
[19:44] these people because these people have
[19:47] been claimed
[19:49] by the truth of God's word. Amen. That
[19:52] has been put in this age. Do you see
[19:55] this is why the angel told brother
[19:58] Brandham in that tent vision, I'll meet
[20:01] you in there.
[20:04] Remember that? Yeah. I'll meet you in
[20:07] there. This will be the third pull.
[20:10] Where's he going to meet you? In that
[20:12] third pull. He said, I will meet you in
[20:14] there. In Sabino, he said, this is the
[20:17] third pull. Yeah. In California, he
[20:20] said, "This will be. I'll meet you in
[20:22] there." In Sabino Canyon, he said, "This
[20:24] is the third pool." So, we're moving
[20:26] from will be to this is. Now, that third
[20:30] pull is the place where God is going to
[20:33] meet. Do you know that the first pull
[20:35] was a healing, the second pull was a
[20:37] prophecy. The third pull is the opening
[20:40] of the word. And what is the third pull?
[20:43] The opening of the word. Isn't that
[20:46] beautiful? Amen. What is it? The third
[20:48] pull is the opening of them seven seals.
[20:52] That's to reveal the truth that's
[20:54] written in the Bible. So when you say
[20:56] third pull, you can just say opening of
[20:59] the word. You can say the revealing of
[21:01] the seals or you can say the claiming
[21:04] work of Jesus Christ. Do you see? It's
[21:07] the opening of the word. It's the tent
[21:10] vision. It's the third pull. It's the
[21:13] claiming work. It's the place he will
[21:16] meet with his bride.
[21:19] Now, I say the Bible tells us that he
[21:21] that has wisdom. And I'll say this, the
[21:23] third pull is here. Amen. It is the
[21:26] opening of the word manifested to us
[21:28] many ways. Amen. Did anybody think of
[21:31] that? Those seven angels being Amen.
[21:34] them being that they were bringing a
[21:37] prophet back to preach those seals. I
[21:39] love how Brother Bam said it when he
[21:40] went up into that consolation of angels.
[21:43] He said, "The one to me, the seventh,
[21:45] seemed more than any of them." He was
[21:47] standing there. Remember that first
[21:49] bunch of little birds? It was that first
[21:51] pull and them second flew eastward and
[21:54] that was the second bunch. Bigger and
[21:55] brighter like doves. That was eastward.
[21:58] See, first pull and second pull, but the
[22:00] next was angels.
[22:03] My I I love how he says it. He says,
[22:06] "Watch. I was standing there and I was
[22:08] looking this way towards the west and
[22:09] they come and pick me up and there I
[22:12] went plum out of my knowing and one of
[22:14] them coming the one that looked so
[22:16] strange to me but to the left where I
[22:19] entered the consolation counting from
[22:20] the left right it would be the seventh
[22:22] angel coming across remember them seven
[22:25] messages I love how he says it in the
[22:27] seventh seal see it's the last angel's
[22:29] message very notable I remember he had
[22:32] his head he's got his head back and his
[22:34] great sharp wings and he flew flew right
[22:37] to me.
[22:39] He flew right to me. That is this
[22:43] seventh seal. It is a notable thing. He
[22:47] flew right to me. The word coming to the
[22:50] prophet. Now, I'm repeating that from
[22:52] weeks back. You remember the word coming
[22:54] to a prophet. That is the seventh seal.
[22:57] It is a notable thing. Now, now that one
[23:00] that flew right to him, watch this. In
[23:03] Revelations the 6th chapter, you're
[23:05] reading here where he's saying that the
[23:09] lamb opened the book and now brother
[23:12] Random is setting in his own study. He's
[23:14] saying just as sure as I'm sitting here,
[23:16] I have the revelation now
[23:19] because he flew right to him to bring
[23:22] him the revelation. Brother Ben said,
[23:24] "My revelation of this is that Christ
[23:27] and the Holy Spirit is the selfsame
[23:30] person." Well, isn't that powerful?
[23:32] Amen. Now, how could he be talking to
[23:35] someone different than the one that's
[23:37] revealing it? Is you say, "Well, it was
[23:39] the lamb, but it was Christ."
[23:42] Because it's the same person. Now, it
[23:46] becomes real evident in this next moment
[23:48] here. He says, "Because, see, here he
[23:50] is. We know he was the lamb. He's
[23:52] standing there with a book in his hand.
[23:54] And there goes the white horse rider."
[23:57] He said, "So we know it couldn't be
[23:59] Christ."
[24:01] Because here he is with his book in his
[24:03] hand and there goes the white horse
[24:04] rider. He said, "See, it definitely is
[24:07] not Christ." Now, you're going to read a
[24:09] lot of books and you're going to maybe
[24:11] talk to a lot of people that's got a lot
[24:12] of things to say about this and they're
[24:14] going to say, "Well, it was this and it
[24:15] was this and this." But yet, amen, we
[24:18] recognize that even even brother
[24:20] Brandham taught this was Christ up till
[24:22] in the 1960s. But under the opening of
[24:25] the seals, there's a dispensational
[24:27] change where now, amen, a prophet, amen,
[24:30] has been handed the book by the lamb.
[24:32] Can I just explain that what that means?
[24:34] The the the the denominations, the
[24:36] schools, the teachers have had the book
[24:38] in their hand for all these years, and
[24:40] they've been telling the people what it
[24:42] means,
[24:44] but for some reason, they can't tie the
[24:46] loose ends of scripture.
[24:48] See, they can't make it. Now, somebody
[24:50] said, "What does that mean?" There's a
[24:51] lot of loose ends in scripture because
[24:53] of different denominations. But let me
[24:55] just say it to you like this. The Bible
[24:57] said that you should go to the world and
[24:59] be baptized in the name of the father,
[25:00] son, and holy ghost. Right? But then you
[25:03] go to Acts chapter 2 and it says you
[25:05] should be baptized in the name of the
[25:06] Lord Jesus Christ. Which is it? You see,
[25:10] it's a loose end that's laying out
[25:12] there. And without someone to bring the
[25:15] revelation together, how would we know
[25:17] what to do? Now, that's a real simple
[25:19] one, right? But you see, if you come to
[25:22] Revelation 6 and you have a white horse
[25:23] rider, there's many that says it's
[25:25] Christ and some says it's uh other
[25:28] things and some says it's this. But
[25:29] something has got to bring that to
[25:32] vindication because the church has been
[25:35] prophesied that they would have the
[25:37] original faith of the book of Acts. Now,
[25:40] how are you going to have to have
[25:42] perfect faith if you don't know what
[25:44] you're talking about? If if you say,
[25:46] "Well, some say it's this and some say
[25:48] it's that." Do you see how un under the
[25:50] shakiness of the ground that you're
[25:52] standing on. But when you can say, "I'm
[25:54] positive sure."
[25:57] What's it doing? It's bringing a
[25:58] settlement, a relaxing. Come on, church.
[26:01] We ought not be up late at night
[26:03] wondering about water baptism.
[26:06] We ought to be able to lay down knowing
[26:07] that the baptism we have is the same one
[26:10] God gave.
[26:12] Now, it's the same thing whether it come
[26:14] to the seals or the thunders or at
[26:16] predestination or the Godhead or any of
[26:18] these other matters. Amen. If we bring
[26:20] it back to one voice,
[26:24] it settles the church. Now, I I'll say
[26:26] this. There's a there's a great plan
[26:28] that God has. Amen. And when each one of
[26:31] these ages, if you're a Bible reader,
[26:32] the seven ages deal with seven stars,
[26:34] seven angels. And each one of them
[26:36] represented an angel to a church. Amen.
[26:38] And those were the churches of Asia,
[26:40] which we find making it into the world
[26:43] under the gentile dispensation between
[26:44] the two comingings of Christ. Now, we
[26:47] found out this is for sure. Amen. That
[26:49] each one of these angels brought great
[26:51] disturbances in their times. And here's
[26:53] the plan of it. The seal opens, a
[26:55] trumpet sounds, a war begins. Somebody
[26:58] said, "War, well, can you think about
[27:00] when Martin Luther stood up to the whole
[27:02] Catholic church?" Can you imagine? Amen.
[27:05] A man of their own rank studied
[27:08] underneath them. Amen. They raised him.
[27:10] They fed him. Amen. and he comes out
[27:13] from within them and rebukes their
[27:16] teachings in his 95 thesis and goes
[27:19] before the world saying that the just
[27:21] shall live by faith. Now that's a big
[27:24] thing. You know why he said that, don't
[27:26] you? Because they didn't believe in
[27:28] faith alone. The Roman church believed
[27:30] in the merits of your works. Amen. In
[27:32] other words, you get sanctified before
[27:34] you get justified. So, Amen. It's kind
[27:36] of like you you do a bunch of works and
[27:38] then somehow you work out enough that
[27:41] you can come to a faith where you can be
[27:42] justified. But Amen. But Martin Luther
[27:45] caught the revelation of what Paul was
[27:47] saying in Romans the fifth chapter when
[27:49] he said the just shall live by faith.
[27:52] Amen. It it's it's in the Bible. But the
[27:54] denominational thought of the Roman
[27:56] church had destroyed the revelation of
[28:00] what was in the Bible already. But
[28:02] Luther came out screaming, "The just
[28:04] shall live by faith." Amen. And they
[28:06] challenged him in every which direction,
[28:08] but he said, "Here, I'll stand."
[28:11] Amen. If I got to die, I'll die. But
[28:13] it's the truth anyhow. Now, the problem
[28:16] was not that he was fighting the Roman
[28:17] church, but where Martin Luther's real
[28:19] problem was was the fanatics that got in
[28:21] with him. And they made Martin Luther
[28:24] look like a nut. Amen. It was a
[28:26] fanaticism behind the true teaching.
[28:29] Now, I ain't got to say a whole lot
[28:31] about the Pentecostal church, do I?
[28:35] It ain't the baptism of the spirit ain't
[28:37] got the problem. It's the fanatics that
[28:39] took a hold of it. Got people out eating
[28:42] grass in the yards and hanging upside
[28:44] down on poles and
[28:49] it it's not the baptism of the spirit.
[28:53] It's when men took a hold of it. That's
[28:56] right. And took it into fanaticism and
[28:59] put a bad name on it. You don't think it
[29:01] wasn't the devil that did that?
[29:04] to make people fear it. You don't think
[29:07] that same devil don't move among the
[29:09] message of the hour to make William
[29:11] Brandham sing like some kind of a nut
[29:13] and way off somewhere? And
[29:16] sure, the same fanaticism moves, but
[29:19] it's the devil.
[29:22] Some of the greatest disgrace that's on
[29:24] the message of the hour comes from
[29:25] within people that call themselves
[29:27] believers. God gathering up in down
[29:31] there in Jeffersonville waiting on
[29:32] Easter for Brother Bam to raise up and
[29:34] the whole world watching. What? What
[29:36] nonsense? Make it seem like that William
[29:39] Brandon believed it. William Brandham
[29:40] never believed that junk. William
[29:42] Brandham never taught somebody to
[29:44] worship him or somebody to follow after
[29:46] him. Matter of fact, he said, "I never
[29:48] come to start a church. I never come to
[29:51] get a following. I come to point you to
[29:53] Jesus Christ." Amen. And I say that I
[29:56] want to do the same thing this morning.
[29:58] Amen. The name of Jesus is above all
[30:00] names. But what name are you talking
[30:03] about? Hallelujah. It's the fanaticism
[30:06] that follows it. Amen. And I'll say
[30:08] this. Amen. The prophet of God will
[30:10] teach us this. He'll teach us. Amen.
[30:12] That according to the scriptures, it's a
[30:14] great plan. And every one of them
[30:16] messengers that came, they took a
[30:18] contrary doctrine to their ages. Martin
[30:20] Luther did it in the reformation. John
[30:22] Wesley did it with sanctification. Isuza
[30:24] Street did it with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[30:27] And we find that it was a good plan
[30:29] until it come to that seventh one. But
[30:32] the seventh angel was going to be more
[30:34] than a reformer. He was going to be a
[30:36] prophet. Amen. Hey, glory to God. Amen.
[30:41] Well, we don't believe in prophets. A
[30:42] long prophets were under John. Finish
[30:44] reading the scripture. After that's the
[30:46] kingdom of God, and we press into it.
[30:48] That's why it says in Hebrews chapter 1,
[30:50] Amen. that God spoke unto us through
[30:52] various times through prophets. But in
[30:54] these last days, through his son. Amen.
[30:58] We're not just talking about a prophet.
[31:00] We're talking about the God of the
[31:01] prophets, getting into the church. And
[31:04] the Bible said the the spirit of Jesus
[31:07] Christ is a spirit of prophecy. What do
[31:09] you mean there's no more prophets? Why
[31:10] does it say in Ephesians 4, Amen, that
[31:12] God has teachers and pastors and
[31:15] apostles and That's right. No, you
[31:18] can't. No. Come on. You can't say that.
[31:22] Didn't Jesus say, "I send unto you
[31:24] prophets and you slay them."
[31:28] Well, we're talking about the Bible now,
[31:30] aren't we? And see, see, Amen. Now,
[31:33] somebody said, "Well, we don't believe."
[31:34] Well, you you and who? That's right.
[31:37] That's right. Sure ain't you and Paul.
[31:41] It ain't you and Moses. It ain't you and
[31:44] Jesus. It's you and some group of men
[31:46] somewhere.
[31:48] Yeah. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Now,
[31:54] do you see something had to tie it
[31:56] together? Now, there's a there's a very
[31:59] solid point that comes out from under
[32:01] this revelation of the seal and and I
[32:04] think it's one of the most exceptional
[32:06] revelations
[32:07] that we can be positive sure of and I
[32:10] think the most important one to the
[32:11] church in general.
[32:13] The church, the bride is two different
[32:16] things. Yes, sir. Yes. And the bride
[32:20] does not go through tribulation.
[32:23] Brother, there is not a more exceptional
[32:26] revelation in this entire Bible to me
[32:30] than the idea that this bride don't go
[32:33] through tribulation.
[32:35] Now, to be clear about this, there is a
[32:38] church that goes through tribulation.
[32:40] Amen. And that's the reason people try
[32:42] to put the whole gentile bride into
[32:45] tribulation cuz you can read scriptures
[32:48] that makes it seem as though you do. But
[32:50] if you take a moment and as Paul said,
[32:53] rightly divide the word, then you could
[32:55] see simply that it's an exaltation of
[32:58] the blood of Jesus Christ rather than a
[33:01] group of people because somebody's
[33:03] believing that Jesus completely and
[33:06] perfectly cleanses us from sin.
[33:09] I tell you, there's no greater there's
[33:11] no greater thing than you could realize
[33:14] is to see that the bride of Christ does
[33:16] not go into tribulation. I can't
[33:18] understand how someone would put her in
[33:20] tribulation. Amen. If the church has to
[33:22] be judged and they've judged themselves
[33:25] and have accepted the blood, can God
[33:27] judge a man that's perfectly
[33:30] and totally sinless?
[33:33] You say there's no such a person? He
[33:35] says every born again believer
[33:38] true believer is perfectly, absolutely
[33:41] sinless before God. He's not trusting in
[33:44] his works. It's in the blood of Jesus
[33:46] that his confession has dropped into.
[33:48] How can you make a man? The Bible said,
[33:50] "He that is born of God doeth not commit
[33:53] sin." That's first John chapter 3,
[33:55] right? Somebody said, "Well, I'll tell
[33:57] you, Brother Brandham, you're wrong on
[33:58] that." Because the Bible said, "A man
[33:59] that says he has no sin's a liar." But
[34:01] the same writer in the next verses said
[34:04] that he that is born of God doeth not
[34:07] yet commit sin because the seed remainth
[34:10] in him. So when we were born according
[34:12] to Paul in the book of Ephesians he said
[34:14] we are like having the nature of the
[34:16] children of wrath. He didn't say we have
[34:18] the seed of the nature of wrath because
[34:21] we have a gene seed of God in us that
[34:24] when the blood comes upon us we become
[34:26] perfectly sinless before almighty God.
[34:29] Well, I tell you, if you're looking for
[34:30] a place to shout, that's a place that
[34:32] you can shout. There's a seed in me that
[34:35] has accepted the blood of Jesus that I
[34:38] am perfectly and totally sinless before
[34:41] God.
[34:43] How can you make a man a sinner when the
[34:46] bleach of the blood is between him and
[34:47] God? It would scatter sin till there's
[34:50] nothing left of it. How can the pure
[34:51] blood of Christ ever let sin pass? It
[34:55] cannot. Amen. You cannot get sin through
[34:58] this blood. Now, now look, if it's the
[35:01] blood of what some teacher's talking
[35:03] about, well, okay, but the blood Paul's
[35:06] talking about is more powerful than that
[35:08] blood. There's a blood that is more
[35:11] powerful than what religion can produce.
[35:14] There is a blood more powerful than an
[35:16] ox or a goat or a calf or a Pharisee or
[35:19] a doctrine. There is the blood of the
[35:22] Lord Jesus Christ which comes from the
[35:24] virgin birth. It's the blood of God. And
[35:28] because he is God, it's the blood of
[35:31] God. And it can completely strip us from
[35:34] every sin. I'll tell you, there ain't no
[35:36] other way to get out of this outside the
[35:38] blood of Jesus Christ.
[35:41] Hallelujah.
[35:43] Here's a man. I I love how Brother Bam
[35:44] does it. He never points at a church.
[35:48] He's pointing at Christ.
[35:51] You can't join it. You can't become a
[35:54] member of it. You got to be born into
[35:56] it. And if you're going to be born, you
[35:58] got to be born by the water, by the
[36:00] blood, and by the spirit.
[36:03] I remember years ago speaking with a
[36:05] fellow. He said, "Don't only talk what
[36:06] the Bible talks and don't talk what the
[36:08] Bible ain't taught." And he said, "The
[36:09] water baptism will save you." I said,
[36:11] "Really?" I said, "Well, I didn't know
[36:13] that. I thought that's what we did to
[36:15] show a conscience." He said, "No." He
[36:17] said, "The Bible said that the water
[36:19] saved Noah, and so so will it you." And
[36:21] he read me the scripture. Being a young
[36:24] Christian, man, he had me all messed up.
[36:26] I didn't know what to say to that one.
[36:28] Well, the Bible says that if you ever
[36:29] want to read it, it's the book of Peter.
[36:30] Said, "Noah was saved by water, and so
[36:32] are you." And I was reading, I thought,
[36:34] "What the world?" But you know what? A
[36:36] few days later, I was reading the book
[36:38] of First John. And the Bible said, "A
[36:40] man comes by water, blood, and spirit.
[36:42] There are three witnesses that bear
[36:44] record." Remember, three on the earth
[36:46] bear record one with the other, but
[36:47] three in heaven are one. The three in
[36:51] heaven that are ones, the father, son,
[36:52] and holy ghost. The one on the earth
[36:54] that agree with one is water, blood, and
[36:55] spirit. And the Bible says, oh, I love
[36:58] it. He says, "And Jesus, not by water
[37:00] only."
[37:03] And Jesus, not by water only, but by the
[37:05] spirit. Amen. That's right. Now, there's
[37:09] three that agree in one. Water, blood,
[37:11] and spirit. But he that hath the son
[37:14] hath life. Amen.
[37:17] My my goodness.
[37:20] Do you see what we we see is an
[37:21] unsealing of these things
[37:24] concerning the election of the church,
[37:27] the bride of Christ that don't go
[37:30] through tribulation. Right? See, we we
[37:32] we we are not going through tribulation.
[37:35] Tribulation is something that is a
[37:37] purging or purifying. It's one of the
[37:39] three-fold purposes of the sixth seal,
[37:42] right? 144,000 are purged. Foolish
[37:45] virgin are purged. Amen. and and we
[37:48] find, amen, that the earth is purged. So
[37:51] there's three purgings, but in the sixth
[37:54] seal, one of the greatest revelations
[37:55] you'll find, brother Matt, the best
[37:56] revelation in the sixth seal is the
[37:58] bride's not in it.
[38:02] You you can really look it over. You
[38:03] find a lot of good things, but what you
[38:05] don't find is better than what you do
[38:06] find. Cuz the bride's not in it. Amen.
[38:10] The bride don't go through tribulation
[38:14] because she's purged in the blood of
[38:16] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Can we just
[38:19] say it real open to you? We don't
[38:21] believe in purgatory.
[38:23] That's right. Preach. Somebody said,
[38:24] "Well, you got to be dead to be a
[38:26] saint." Paul said to the saints which
[38:28] are in Ephesus. He wasn't talking to
[38:29] dead people. He's talking living people.
[38:32] Saints are people that have been
[38:34] baptized with the Holy Ghost. Oh, glory
[38:38] to God. See, the purging's over. Now you
[38:41] say, "Why would you tell a message group
[38:42] that?" Because we don't believe in
[38:44] purgatory.
[38:46] If God forgave you, brother Chris,
[38:48] you're forgave. Amen.
[38:51] This don't take six years and six
[38:53] months. And
[38:55] oh my goodness, in three years, if you
[38:57] live it perfect now, then we'll be able
[38:59] to justify you. That's not the gospel.
[39:01] No, it's not. The real gospel is you
[39:04] were cleansed by the blood 2,000 years
[39:08] ago. Hallelujah. And as a gospel
[39:11] preacher, I'm here to announce to you
[39:13] that the blood paid the price. And by
[39:17] faith, you say that's the truth. And
[39:19] your faith in the blood is what takes
[39:22] away sin.
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:24] We do not believe in purgatory. We
[39:27] believe in the gospel. Yes. The gospel
[39:30] that saves a man. Amen. That that puts a
[39:33] bride in a rapture. Now, can we take
[39:35] scripture just a little bit here? Second
[39:37] Thessalonians, let's read the second
[39:38] chapter, the first verse, and uh down to
[39:41] the 12th. We'll just take just a moment
[39:43] here.
[39:44] I think it's a powerful thing.
[39:47] Now, we beseech you, brethren, by the
[39:48] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by
[39:51] our gathering together unto him. Oh my
[39:54] goodness. I don't have time for all that
[39:56] one.
[39:58] by our gathering together unto him.
[39:59] Y'all know what that is, right?
[40:02] Until Shiloh. But let the gathering be
[40:05] unto him.
[40:07] That's why the shout tells us it's a
[40:09] gathering.
[40:11] The message calls you to him.
[40:15] Not to a denomination or a church,
[40:19] but to him. And watch this. He said,
[40:21] "Then let no man deceive you by any
[40:24] means,
[40:25] for that day shall not come except there
[40:28] come a falling away first and the man of
[40:31] sin be revealed the son of predition."
[40:34] Now there was some people of course I
[40:36] think they they were they were saying
[40:37] that things would already finished and
[40:40] that we were looking into the millennium
[40:41] even in Paul's day. But he's saying to
[40:43] them very quickly, "The day shall not
[40:45] come except a falling away first and the
[40:47] man of sin be revealed." Do you realize
[40:49] that the falling away is an apostasy?
[40:52] According to Jesus in Matthew 24 said
[40:55] there will be false Christ with an S.
[40:59] There'll be many Christ. They won't come
[41:01] and say, "I'm Jesus,
[41:03] but they're anointed,
[41:06] but their teaching is false."
[41:09] So, they become a false Christ. False
[41:11] anointed teachers
[41:14] bringing an apostasy upon the earth. And
[41:17] that apostasy gets so bad until the
[41:20] Bible tells us they literally will
[41:22] worship the devil believing the
[41:23] worshiping God.
[41:26] And that man of sin shall be revealed
[41:28] the son of predition who opposeth and
[41:30] exalteth himself above all that is
[41:33] called God. Let me just walk through it
[41:35] real quickly here. All that is called
[41:37] God. You might want to know this later.
[41:39] He exalts himself above what is called
[41:41] God. What is called God? The word. John
[41:43] 1, right? In the beginning was the word.
[41:45] The word was with God. The word was God.
[41:47] What's the word? It's God. So I if to
[41:50] help you, it's this is the vindicated
[41:53] word. That's right.
[41:56] Satan opposes and exalts himself above
[42:00] the vindicated word of your day.
[42:04] That's how he's worshiped.
[42:07] See, he got a better idea than God's
[42:08] pattern, God's prophet. He's got his own
[42:11] word. Do you see? He siteth in the
[42:14] temple of God, showing himself that he
[42:16] is God. Remember ye not when I was with
[42:19] you, I told you these things, and now ye
[42:22] know what withholdeth that he might be
[42:25] revealed in his time. How many knows
[42:28] what time that is? In his time. The man
[42:31] of sin will be revealed in his time.
[42:35] First seal, brother Bram says, that's
[42:36] the opening of the seal.
[42:39] That's when he will be revealed. There
[42:42] is two revealings of this of this man of
[42:44] sin. Now there's two revealings. The
[42:47] bride church will get a revealing under
[42:49] the opening of the word. The world will
[42:53] get a revealing when the man of sin
[42:56] takes power.
[42:58] Yeah. And when the man of sin takes
[43:00] power, the world will say, "I thought
[43:03] there was going to be a rapture."
[43:06] What are we doing in the middle of
[43:07] tribulation? And then they will see the
[43:09] man of sin is the head of all
[43:12] denomination. It's the pope.
[43:15] They won't see that right now. You can't
[43:17] tell them that right now. But to you
[43:20] that had the spirit of wisdom
[43:22] the man of sin is already revealed. You
[43:26] already know who it is. It's not a
[43:28] surprise to you at all. Because the
[43:31] mystery of iniquity doeth work only he
[43:34] who now let will let until he be taken
[43:36] out of the way. Now, what are we talking
[43:38] about? We're talking about the bride
[43:40] don't go into the tribulation.
[43:42] See, now watch the scripture. He will
[43:44] let. Now, I love this has always been a
[43:46] favorite part of mine. Only he who now
[43:49] letth, who's that? He, God, lets. In
[43:52] other words, the man of sin is already
[43:54] at work. The mystery of iniquity is
[43:56] working. And started to work the moment
[43:59] Paul began the gospel. The man of sin
[44:03] began back then. But he will only let
[44:07] God will let this continue until he be
[44:10] taken out of the way. There's two he
[44:12] here. This is a powerful thing. There's
[44:14] two he here. One he is God. The other he
[44:18] is the church. Yeah. Now it's odd that
[44:21] he would use he concerning the church,
[44:24] but she has now been recognized as him.
[44:27] Yeah. See, under the revelation, she is
[44:31] him. There has literally been a marriage
[44:33] in Revelations 19. And the bride has
[44:36] been joined with him so much that the
[44:39] prophet would say in Christ the mystery,
[44:41] they're not two units now. They're now
[44:44] the same unit. You can't see God
[44:46] separate from his church. Because God is
[44:50] manifesting himself so much in the bride
[44:53] that he would say it's his return into
[44:56] the earth. Hallelujah. The seven seal
[44:58] brings him to the earth. Amen. Amen.
[45:01] Well, glory to God. It's called the
[45:03] bride coming of Christ. That's right.
[45:06] She becomes him so much that Paul says
[45:09] until she be taken out of the way, let's
[45:11] just put it out there very clearly. She
[45:13] is what's holding up the tribulation.
[45:15] Period. Amen. As long as she's here, the
[45:18] tribulation can't take place. No
[45:20] different than the moon holds the tides
[45:23] of the ocean in her banks. So does this
[45:26] bride hold Satan and all of his wrath.
[45:29] We hold it back. Amen. You may not think
[45:32] you're powerful, but let me tell you
[45:33] something this morning. This is the most
[45:35] powerful force on the face of the earth
[45:38] because we are we are the bride, the
[45:40] queen of heaven. Church, come on. The
[45:42] prophet said we're kin to him. How we
[45:44] kin? He said by the spirit we have
[45:47] become the blood. You might not want to
[45:49] realize that, but the mercy seat is in
[45:51] the heart of these believers today. Look
[45:54] at when brother Bram saw it, brother
[45:55] Daryl, he saw a ring of blood around the
[45:58] earth. Is that right? Amen. Let me tell
[46:00] you, where's this bride at? She ain't
[46:02] just in Ohio. She ain't just in Arkansas
[46:05] or Tennessee or Louisiana or Oklahoma.
[46:07] Amen. She's in Africa and India and over
[46:10] in Japan. There is a ring of blood all
[46:13] the way around this earth. And as long
[46:16] as there's a bride on this earth, the
[46:19] tribulation can't set in. Oh, but church
[46:22] of the living God, one of these
[46:23] mornings, God is going to raise this
[46:25] bride off of the earth and the tidal
[46:28] waves of hell is going to smash into
[46:30] her. But it can't do it as long as
[46:32] you're here.
[46:35] I tell you, sometime or another you have
[46:37] to turn and tell that devil, you ain't
[46:39] as powerful as you think you are. Amen.
[46:42] Sister Terra, a mother has got a lot
[46:44] more power than the devil. A real
[46:46] Christian believer can turn the tides on
[46:49] the devil. He can tell it that's far
[46:51] enough. That's far enough. You know how
[46:53] long the devil's going to push you until
[46:55] you say that's far enough. And when you
[46:58] turn around and say, "Satan, that's as
[47:00] far as you're coming." He has to stop
[47:03] right where you draw the line. Let me
[47:05] tell you, it's a bloodline the church
[47:07] can draw and it can tell the devil, you
[47:10] can't cross.
[47:12] I'm in the Bible. At the Red Sea, there
[47:14] was a pillar of fire came down and
[47:16] separated them from the enemy. The enemy
[47:20] was in darkness and Israel was in light
[47:23] because God moved out in front of them
[47:25] and went behind them. And I'll tell you
[47:27] this, if you're talking about the bride,
[47:29] he's in front of you. He's behind you.
[47:31] He's east, west, south, north. He's all
[47:33] around this bride. Amen. I tell you,
[47:36] friends. Amen. The power of this
[47:39] believing church, the authority that she
[47:41] has. Amen. See, the the man of sin is
[47:45] already at work. Can can I just say real
[47:47] carefully what you're dealing with is
[47:50] you're dealing with the work that Satan
[47:52] started in the beginning. He finishes
[47:54] all the way to the tribulation.
[47:56] Right?
[47:57] If you look at it in the Bible, I give
[47:59] you just a real small portion of it and
[48:00] then we'll move on. But if you're
[48:02] looking at it in the Bible, the book of
[48:03] Chronicles tells us, you remember when
[48:05] Ahab got killed
[48:07] and he they they they was up there and
[48:09] there was 400 prophets telling Ahab, "Go
[48:11] into battle." But Elijah had prophesied
[48:14] he'd die. But those prophets had a
[48:17] better idea and said, "No, no, go on
[48:18] into the battle. You'll be all right."
[48:20] And he was a little he was a little
[48:22] unsure.
[48:24] And you know what that was, don't you?
[48:27] Is that was the inner man.
[48:29] Now, the outer man does okay with
[48:31] intellectual learning, but it don't
[48:33] answer the soul.
[48:35] So, he said, "Well, ain't that ain't
[48:36] there one man? Ain't there one more that
[48:38] hears from God?" Josh wasn't settled on
[48:42] that. Ain't there one more? And they
[48:44] said, "Well, there's another one, but he
[48:45] hates us. He's always prophesying
[48:47] against our our denominations. You know,
[48:49] he's always always hitting our
[48:50] religion." And he said, "Well, go get
[48:52] him then. He ain't on the payroll.
[48:55] He might tell us the truth.
[49:00] You you know you can't hardly hire
[49:02] somebody to tell you the truth now.
[49:05] No people climb a tree tell you a lie
[49:07] quicker than they stand on ground tell
[49:08] you the truth
[49:11] because it's unpopular.
[49:14] Sure.
[49:16] But Micah come out of there and remember
[49:17] what he said. He said, "Well, Ahab going
[49:19] into the battle." And Ahab said, "No,
[49:20] no, you ain't being straight with me."
[49:23] I'm gonna paraphrase what he did. He
[49:25] said, "You ain't being straight with
[49:26] me." He said, "Well, let me tell you
[49:27] what I really see then. I see a
[49:29] conference going on in the heavens, and
[49:31] I see that they're discussing the
[49:34] Elijah's prophecy against you, Ahab, and
[49:37] they're saying, "Who's going to fulfill
[49:39] it?" And I see a lying spirit come up
[49:42] out of hell. Yeah. And say, "Send me."
[49:45] And I see God telling that lying spirit,
[49:47] "Go get in them prophets." Yeah. And you
[49:50] will prevail.
[49:52] So, a lion spirit got into them to
[49:55] prevail. Now watch. Amen. When that
[49:58] lying spirit got in there, they were
[50:01] already prophesying before Micah ever
[50:03] walked up. See, the iniquity was already
[50:07] at work.
[50:09] The only thing that Micah did was
[50:12] revealed what really was happening.
[50:16] These denominations were lying years
[50:18] before William Brandham come.
[50:21] So when he comes late into the game,
[50:24] right before the tribulation, there's a
[50:26] bride saying, "Isn't there somebody with
[50:29] truth?"
[50:30] Amen. And but but the world is good with
[50:33] the hired preachers. They're good with
[50:34] the false prophets. That's that's all
[50:36] good. But the Bible said they would be
[50:38] good with it because somebody's going to
[50:40] fulfill the scriptures.
[50:43] And but watch what happens. But God
[50:45] sends truth.
[50:48] And this message has been sent truth.
[50:50] Even in the middle
[50:53] when the when the iniquity is already
[50:55] working, watch what happens. He says,
[50:57] "Even him who is coming after working of
[51:00] Satan with all power, signs, and lying
[51:02] wonders and with deceased
[51:04] them that perish because they received
[51:06] not the love of truth."
[51:09] Because they didn't love truth. They
[51:11] heard it, but it didn't move them. They
[51:13] heard it, but it didn't touch them.
[51:16] Amen. They heard the truth, but Ahab
[51:19] went right on into the battle anyhow. He
[51:21] went right on into the Armageddon,
[51:23] didn't he? That's right. For this cause,
[51:26] so God send the strong delusion that
[51:28] they should believe a lie. Brother Bam
[51:30] said, make it the lie, the same one that
[51:32] was told to Eve, that they might be
[51:34] damned upon who believe not the truth,
[51:36] but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
[51:38] Now, that's how you know it's not you.
[51:41] They had pleasure in unrighteousness,
[51:43] and they were damned by the lie that
[51:44] believed. You know what the Bible said?
[51:45] a strong delusion. That's that's an
[51:47] effective error. That's what that means.
[51:50] Effective error. In other words, the
[51:52] error a strong delusion is they take 90%
[51:56] truth or 95% truth and they twist the
[51:59] truth a little bit and it becomes an
[52:01] effective error. Brother man said the
[52:04] greatest lie ever told was 99% true.
[52:08] Amen. The devil can tell it 99% true.
[52:12] True. How do you know? Amen. is the
[52:15] difference. It is the word. See, the
[52:17] falling away, the apostasy is what opens
[52:20] up a place for the man of sin to become
[52:23] ex expounded. Amen. And become fully a a
[52:27] man of sin. Now, his time of revealing
[52:30] is under the first seal. That's why the
[52:32] Bible said he will be destroyed with the
[52:35] brightness of his coming. The word of
[52:37] the Lord will reveal Satan in his
[52:40] coming. In the brightness of the
[52:42] fulfilling of the word, it'll show truth
[52:44] to the church. In Isaiah 60 and:1, it's
[52:47] prophesied that you should arise and
[52:49] shine. For thy light has come, and the
[52:53] glory of the Lord has risen upon thee.
[52:55] Darkness is covering the earth, and
[52:57] gross darkness the people, but the Lord
[53:00] shall arise upon thee, and the glory
[53:02] shall be seen upon thee. It says in
[53:05] Revelations 18 that there was an angel
[53:08] that will come down and light the whole
[53:10] earth with glory. In Zechariah 14, it
[53:13] said in the evening time there shall be
[53:15] light. This light is the destruction of
[53:18] Satan's plans. Amen. It exposes the
[53:22] darkness of Satan. Amen. And brings the
[53:25] word of truth which oh my which
[53:28] effectively destroys error. Do you do
[53:32] you see what he does when he rides that
[53:33] white horse in Revelations 19? Amen. The
[53:36] opposing element is the vindicated word
[53:39] and a sword is coming out of his mouth.
[53:41] The sharpest thing in the world is
[53:43] truth. It'll cut the enemy right out.
[53:47] It'll cut the enemy out of your life,
[53:48] out of your heart. Now, watch what he's
[53:51] doing. The prophet takes 2 Thessalonians
[53:53] to prove to the church there's a
[53:55] difference between church and bride. And
[53:57] as long as the bride is here, the
[53:59] tribulation can't take place. Matthew
[54:01] 25:es 1 to4 tells us of five foolish and
[54:05] five wise virgins. Again, showing you a
[54:08] church and a bride. We can see it in
[54:10] John 5 and verse 24. The Bible says that
[54:14] he that believeth upon me shall not come
[54:17] into condemnation, but has already
[54:20] passed into eternal life. Not through
[54:23] the judgment, but through the word of
[54:26] God that has brought your souls clean.
[54:29] Amen. Are we together? Are we okay? Now,
[54:32] let's watch this in Revelation 6. Let's
[54:34] just turn right back to it. And when I
[54:36] saw the lamb opened one of these seals,
[54:38] I heard and it was the noise of a
[54:41] thunder. My goodness. Amen. Amen. What a
[54:45] discussion starts on that point.
[54:48] The noise of a thunder. Brother Ram
[54:50] said, "It's got a significance. It's got
[54:52] a meaning because nothing happens
[54:54] without it. It's a thunder. It's a
[54:57] roar." What was that thunder? Wow. What
[55:02] was that thunder? Now, I'm gonna give
[55:04] you the short answer and then we'll look
[55:05] at it. How many wants the short answer?
[55:09] The thunder is the voice of God.
[55:13] Simple. Now, now all this that we're
[55:15] fishing to look into simply spells out
[55:19] the thunder is the voice of God. That's
[55:21] the short answer. Now, watch what he's
[55:23] saying. Now, Brother Brandham
[55:24] immediately says, if you've wondered
[55:26] what it was, he said, let's go to John
[55:29] the 12th chapter and begin to read.
[55:32] Let's do it. John 12 and verse 23.
[55:36] There's nothing like the word of God, is
[55:37] there? On a Sunday morning. Amen.
[55:41] Hallelujah. John 12 and 23. And Jesus
[55:43] answered and said, "The hour is come
[55:47] that the Son of Man should be glorified.
[55:49] Verily I say unto you, except a corn of
[55:50] wheat fall into the ground and die, it
[55:52] abideth alone, but if it die, it
[55:54] bringeth forth much fruit." Now, this is
[55:56] an answer to the to the Gentiles wanting
[55:59] to see Jesus. This is how he answers
[56:00] them. And brother Bam said, 'Really,
[56:02] what it is, he's telling them, you're
[56:03] going to have to die from all your
[56:04] traditions to see me because I'm already
[56:06] here. Amen. See, it's got to die and
[56:09] bring forth much fruit, but he that
[56:10] loveth his life shall lose it, and he
[56:12] that hateth his life shall keep it unto
[56:14] eternal life. And if a man serve me, let
[56:16] him follow me, and where I am, there
[56:18] also shall my servant be. And if any man
[56:20] serve me, him will my father honor. For
[56:23] now is my soul troubled. And what shall
[56:26] I say? Father, save me from this hour.
[56:29] But for this cause I came unto this
[56:31] hour. Father glorify thy name. And then
[56:34] there came a voice. Somebody say voice.
[56:37] There came a voice from heaven saying, I
[56:41] have both glorified it. And we'll
[56:43] glorify it again. The people therefore
[56:46] that stood by heard it and said it
[56:49] thundered.
[56:51] When God spoke from heaven, it was a
[56:54] voice. When the people heard it, it was
[56:58] a thunder.
[56:59] When God gave the revelation of the
[57:01] seal, it was a voice, but John heard a
[57:04] thunder. Look at what he says here. He
[57:07] says it very clearly. Now, it's so
[57:09] beautifully written in scripture. The
[57:11] steeple stood by and heard it that it
[57:13] thundered and others said, an angel
[57:16] spake to him and Jesus answered and
[57:18] said, this voice, there it is. This
[57:22] voice.
[57:23] Now, you say it was a thunder. Jesus
[57:25] said, this voice. Jesus didn't call it a
[57:28] thunder. The people called it a thunder.
[57:30] He called it a voice. This voice came
[57:33] not because of me but for your sakes.
[57:35] Then in John 12, brother Bam said what
[57:38] it was. He said that was the end of his
[57:40] ministry and the son of man was going to
[57:42] be glorified. He said, "What about an
[57:45] hour that has come for the bride when
[57:48] she is to be glorified? She's to be
[57:49] taken off of the earth." If it thunders
[57:52] back there for the cross and the pain of
[57:55] the debts of the church, what kind of
[57:57] thunder will it be when God gets ready
[57:59] to take this bride up? My goodness, I'll
[58:02] tell you, the hour has come. The time
[58:04] shall be no more. Amen. Isn't it
[58:07] beautiful? If you thought about it for a
[58:08] moment this morning, the hour has come.
[58:11] The hour has come, but this is not the
[58:14] hour of the corporal body of our Lord.
[58:16] This is not the hour of Paul and Peter
[58:18] and James and John and of the early
[58:20] church. This is your hour. Amen. This is
[58:23] the hour of the bride of Christ. The
[58:26] word has become flesh. The alpha has
[58:30] become the omega. My goodness. To think
[58:33] this morning these these statements that
[58:35] that has took a lifetime to absorb to
[58:38] just be able to say them. Now they're
[58:40] simple statements to you. The thunder is
[58:42] a voice. Do you know how many years that
[58:44] had to be rendered out to that become
[58:46] that simple? Do you know? Amen. Where
[58:48] the alpha has become the omega. You're
[58:51] hearing it as a statement. But there has
[58:53] been lives that has been spent to
[58:56] understand the real meaning of that. The
[58:58] alpha has become the omega. In other
[59:00] words, we're not looking for the bride
[59:02] to come. She's on the earth now. The
[59:06] hour has come. The hour is not coming.
[59:10] It's not on its way. The hour is come. I
[59:14] tell you what, if you only knew your
[59:15] hour, if you knew your day of
[59:17] visitation, you could shake loose. Amen.
[59:20] You could shake loose from the lies of
[59:21] the devil and all these things he's
[59:23] trying to place on the church. And
[59:25] someday we'll have revival. Someday
[59:27] things will be better. Listen, these
[59:29] things are wonderful this morning. If we
[59:32] could only break out of our human realm
[59:34] and take from us the scales of
[59:37] traditions that the devil has placed
[59:38] upon us, we are living in the greatest
[59:41] season that any human being has ever
[59:44] lived.
[59:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:50] The alpha has become the omega. Amen. If
[59:54] you really were this important,
[59:57] if you really were this important,
[59:58] wouldn't your name be in the Bible?
[1:00:00] People
[1:00:02] tell me that if it was really that
[1:00:04] important, wouldn't the name be in the
[1:00:05] Bible? It is. Amen. That's right. It is.
[1:00:08] It's written. See, it was written in
[1:00:10] symbol.
[1:00:13] See, when God spoke it, it thundered.
[1:00:15] And there's a symbol that represents
[1:00:18] something laid in the Bible. But when
[1:00:20] you begin to preach it, Brother Bam
[1:00:21] said, "The mystery, this book holds our
[1:00:23] names." And the unfolding of this
[1:00:25] mystery begins to call us. That's why,
[1:00:28] amen, that he could look upon us and see
[1:00:30] the thundering of the voices of the
[1:00:32] lives that lived down through the Bible.
[1:00:34] And brother Bam said, "Every one of them
[1:00:36] represented something that had to do
[1:00:38] with this bride." Listen, every story is
[1:00:41] in effect this morning. Your name was
[1:00:44] written there when he talked about Ruth
[1:00:46] and Boaz. You're the Rof that was in the
[1:00:49] story. Your name is written when Esther
[1:00:51] come running in to the throne. You're
[1:00:54] the Esther of the age. You're the Tamar.
[1:00:56] You're the Mary. You're the bride of
[1:00:59] Christ that was down through the ages
[1:01:01] that was sitting there. I say this
[1:01:03] morning. Amen. Your name was written in
[1:01:05] here. Amen. And there is nothing once
[1:01:08] you get your eyes open that can stop
[1:01:11] you. Amen. Glory. Like the little
[1:01:13] colored girl that brother Brandon run
[1:01:15] into and she said, "I I'm looking for my
[1:01:18] grandpa, but if I could find the healer,
[1:01:20] I'd find my own grandpa. These eyes
[1:01:23] would be able to see." And I say this
[1:01:25] morning, amen, that once we found the
[1:01:27] word of God, amen, we can read the Bible
[1:01:30] for ourselves. We don't have to read it
[1:01:32] through some teacher or some apostle or
[1:01:34] some bishop. I say my eyes have come
[1:01:37] open. I can see the pride in this book.
[1:01:40] I can see it was written before the
[1:01:43] foundations of the world. Well,
[1:01:45] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:47] Said, brother Wayne, what what in the
[1:01:49] world are you getting at? I'm saying
[1:01:51] when that white horse rode, Amen. and
[1:01:53] that thunder struck back. Amen. The
[1:01:55] prophet of God said, "What about the
[1:01:57] hour for this bride? What about the hour
[1:02:00] when this when these thunders are
[1:02:01] supposed to produce faith for rapture?"
[1:02:06] That's what he said.
[1:02:08] It's supposed to produce faith for this
[1:02:10] hour. I'm going to skip about 10 pages
[1:02:11] here right quick for y'all
[1:02:14] time. What happens when it moves from
[1:02:18] reality or from symbol to reality?
[1:02:21] Right? Every mystery with God starts in
[1:02:24] his mind. How many knows that? It starts
[1:02:26] in the mind of God. But when he reveals
[1:02:29] the first f of it, it shows up as a
[1:02:31] symbol. In the mind of God, the white
[1:02:35] horse rider always was that. But when
[1:02:37] John caught it, he caught a symbol,
[1:02:39] wrote it in scripture, and it was
[1:02:41] waiting on a prophet to reveal it.
[1:02:43] When the prophet reveals it, if he's not
[1:02:46] able to catch the original mind of God
[1:02:49] concerning it, how do we know it's the
[1:02:51] truth?
[1:02:53] But what is it? It comes because when it
[1:02:56] opens, it opens in reality form.
[1:03:01] So it thunders
[1:03:03] out of a life.
[1:03:05] It it speaks
[1:03:07] out of the actual reality.
[1:03:11] See, the white horse is something. But
[1:03:13] when it's living, it is the reality of
[1:03:16] what originally was thought. So the
[1:03:18] white horse might represent something,
[1:03:20] but whatever it was when it happened is
[1:03:22] the true interpretation of it. That's
[1:03:24] right. See, because first it's a a
[1:03:27] thought and then it becomes a symbol and
[1:03:28] then it becomes reality. You are living
[1:03:31] in the moment when the symbol becomes
[1:03:34] reality. Now I'll just read you a few
[1:03:36] direct statements and we're going to
[1:03:37] move on. When it thundered, remember a
[1:03:40] loud clapping noise of a thunder is a
[1:03:43] voice of God.
[1:03:45] First seal, the voice is a thunder.
[1:03:50] First seal, paragraph 173. And a thunder
[1:03:53] went off. John knew it was the voice of
[1:03:56] God. Who's John? Bride knew it was the
[1:04:00] voice of God. First seal, paragraph 263.
[1:04:02] We found what the thunder means
[1:04:06] perfectly. We know that. Amen. The
[1:04:09] thunder was the voice of God when the
[1:04:12] seal opened.
[1:04:14] Now you said, "Preacher, why? Why? Why
[1:04:16] are you labor here?" Because brother
[1:04:18] Bram said that thunder was what brought
[1:04:21] translation faith.
[1:04:23] He said that thunder is what brings the
[1:04:27] new name of the Lord to the church.
[1:04:31] Yeah. Now, if you're too if you're too
[1:04:33] scared to talk about the thunders,
[1:04:36] you're never going to find faith and
[1:04:38] you're never going to know his name.
[1:04:41] People say, "Well, I'll tell you, I know
[1:04:42] Jesus and him crucified and they're
[1:04:44] talking about something from 2,000 years
[1:04:46] ago and they're standing today and I
[1:04:48] don't make fun of nobody, but I've heard
[1:04:50] people pray and brother A, you've heard
[1:04:52] it and and they're trying to because
[1:04:53] they know we believe the message." When
[1:04:55] they start praying, they go, "Jesus,
[1:04:56] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[1:04:57] Jesus, Jesus." like we don't believe in
[1:04:58] the name Jesus. It's almost
[1:05:00] embarrassing. It's like, well, I
[1:05:02] actually know him.
[1:05:04] Amen.
[1:05:06] It's kind of like somebody say, you
[1:05:07] know, they they they make sure, brother
[1:05:09] Ericen. Brother Ericson. Well, I call
[1:05:11] him Brother Ray. I call him Brother
[1:05:12] Ericen for respect, but but I know him.
[1:05:15] It's kind of a personal relationship.
[1:05:18] I'm not talking about somebody that that
[1:05:20] I don't know.
[1:05:23] Now, now I I'm going to I'm going to say
[1:05:25] this. Brother Brandham says it very
[1:05:27] clearly that when there's an overcoming,
[1:05:30] there's a change of names. And he goes
[1:05:31] through Abraham and Sarah and Saul and
[1:05:33] Paul and Peter and Simon. And he keeps
[1:05:36] laying it out. He said, "And when Jesus
[1:05:38] was on the earth, he was a redeemer." He
[1:05:41] was a redeemer. That's true. Yes. But
[1:05:44] when he conquered death, hell, and
[1:05:46] overcame them, he ascended on high and
[1:05:48] received a new name.
[1:05:50] That's the reason they holler the way
[1:05:53] they do and don't get nothing. Yeah, it
[1:05:56] will be revealed in the thunders. And
[1:05:59] you say, "Preacher, amen." You But go
[1:06:02] back to the Bible on the mountain with
[1:06:04] Elijah and he's up there with them and
[1:06:06] they're cutting themselves and they're
[1:06:08] calling on the name of the Lord, but
[1:06:10] they call him Baal.
[1:06:12] Their interpretation of God and they're
[1:06:15] cutting themselves and they're screaming
[1:06:16] and Elijah's going, "Is he on vacation?"
[1:06:20] And brother Bam says they're hollering
[1:06:22] but they're not getting nothing.
[1:06:24] He said the if you read your Bible,
[1:06:26] you'll see this is true. Matthew 25 said
[1:06:29] they don't get no oil. And they're out
[1:06:31] here hollering the name of Jesus, but
[1:06:34] they're not getting anything out of it
[1:06:37] because the word holds the name of Jesus
[1:06:41] Christ. Oh my goodness. Somebody said,
[1:06:43] "Well, how many different ways could you
[1:06:44] say Jesus?" Well, the Baptist say Jesus
[1:06:47] and mean one thing, and the Lutheran say
[1:06:48] Jesus and mean something else. And the
[1:06:50] Pentecostals said Jesus, and they mean
[1:06:52] something else. But when we speak Jesus,
[1:06:55] the name that we speak is the God of
[1:06:58] this Bible. He's not the second person
[1:07:00] of the Godhead. Come on, church. He's
[1:07:03] not some some sideline Aaron boy. He is
[1:07:06] the God of Abraham. He is the God of the
[1:07:10] Bible. He's a everpresent merciful God
[1:07:14] and has revealed himself into this age.
[1:07:16] He's not a God that was. He's a God that
[1:07:18] is. He's the same right now that he's
[1:07:21] ever been. And this message has come to
[1:07:23] reveal. Amen. To reveal his name. Now,
[1:07:26] I'm not trying to get you off in some
[1:07:28] crazy something. Let me just give you a
[1:07:30] simple thing and move on because I don't
[1:07:31] have time to teach these things. You you
[1:07:33] question, you come to me. But watch. The
[1:07:35] Bible says you can only worship God in
[1:07:38] the place he puts his name.
[1:07:41] There's a lot of gates, but you can only
[1:07:44] worship in the gate where he puts his
[1:07:46] name. Now, you can worship all you want
[1:07:48] to, but it's not accepted. And Jesus
[1:07:51] said, "In vain do you worship me,
[1:07:54] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[1:07:56] of men." Do you see what he's saying to
[1:07:57] you? My name is not in their
[1:08:00] commandments. My name is in my word and
[1:08:03] it will only be worshiped in the gate
[1:08:05] that I have prepared. Why did William
[1:08:08] Brandham hear the voice of that angel
[1:08:10] say, "I will meet you in there."
[1:08:13] What's the meeting place where he puts
[1:08:16] his name? Amen. Where's he going to meet
[1:08:18] this bride? in the same place he met
[1:08:20] that prophet where the word is being
[1:08:23] interpreted. Look what he says. Brother
[1:08:26] Larry, I'm sure you've went over these
[1:08:28] quotes wonderfully. And brother Bam
[1:08:29] said, "The manifestation of the name."
[1:08:31] He said, "Oh, that's the word
[1:08:33] interpreted is a manifestation of the
[1:08:36] name."
[1:08:39] Where you going to meet him? Where he's
[1:08:40] interpreting his word.
[1:08:42] Not was, not will be, is. Amen. That's
[1:08:47] where he will meet you. That's the name
[1:08:49] of the Lord. That's why David could come
[1:08:51] out on the on that great and mighty
[1:08:53] battle and he could say, "You come to me
[1:08:55] with armor and spear, but I'm coming to
[1:08:58] you in the name of the Lord." And under
[1:09:00] the anointing of a prophet, he knew the
[1:09:03] true name of the Lord. And he knew his
[1:09:05] God was greater than any Philistine and
[1:09:08] any Goliath. And when William Brandham
[1:09:10] took this message, he went onto the
[1:09:12] field as a David against the Goliaths of
[1:09:15] the age, saying, "God don't heal no
[1:09:16] more. God don't save no more. God don't
[1:09:18] give the Holy Ghost no more. God don't
[1:09:20] see visions no more. God don't do this.
[1:09:22] And he said, "I don't know what God
[1:09:23] you're talking about, but the God of
[1:09:25] Elijah is to be restored in the last
[1:09:28] day. He's still alive."
[1:09:31] His name remains to be hell shi elohim.
[1:09:36] He's every redemptive name of the Bible.
[1:09:38] He is not a second person. He is God. He
[1:09:42] is almighty God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah. His name is in the word.
[1:09:49] That's right. Oh my goodness.
[1:09:53] Now, there's a real reason to settle on
[1:09:56] this point because in the second verse,
[1:09:58] and I'm not going to be too much longer.
[1:09:59] In the second verse of Revelation 6, you
[1:10:02] will see that when this rider comes out,
[1:10:04] he's riding a white horse and he ain't
[1:10:07] got a name.
[1:10:09] And brother Bam said, "There we see
[1:10:11] again." See, he's riding a white horse,
[1:10:15] but it ain't Christ.
[1:10:17] Christ comes out of the heavens of
[1:10:18] heavens on a white horse. And here, this
[1:10:21] guy comes out on a white horse. But when
[1:10:23] Jesus comes on the white horse, he has a
[1:10:25] name written. How many knows what the
[1:10:26] name is?
[1:10:28] The word of God. He has a name written
[1:10:32] upon his vesture. The word of God. The
[1:10:35] vindicated word of God. And watch this.
[1:10:38] But that one don't have a name.
[1:10:42] White horse rider with no name.
[1:10:46] Impersonation Christianity.
[1:10:49] Brother Bram says, "Watch this now." Oh,
[1:10:51] Lord. And he receives a crown. Pull it
[1:10:54] back up. Second verse. Watch it. Just
[1:10:57] the just the simple statements of
[1:10:59] Revelation more than proving it
[1:11:01] throughout the Bible. Just simple
[1:11:02] statements. Now, it takes a long time to
[1:11:05] make it simple.
[1:11:08] It takes you three or four hours to make
[1:11:10] it complicated,
[1:11:12] but it takes 10 or 12 or 15 hours of
[1:11:14] study to make it simple.
[1:11:18] He knows what I'm saying.
[1:11:21] What was that angel met brother Bam?
[1:11:22] That constellation.
[1:11:24] You could spend weeks, months, years
[1:11:28] before you can finally say, "Well, it
[1:11:30] was Christ." Oh, Lord. See how simple
[1:11:32] that was? Yes.
[1:11:34] And I sat and beheld a white horse
[1:11:36] impersonator. no name. And he that sat
[1:11:38] upon him had a bow and he was crowned
[1:11:40] was given unto him
[1:11:43] and a crown was given unto him. Your
[1:11:45] brother said, "Here it is. It's an
[1:11:47] antichrist spirit with false teaching."
[1:11:51] And he began and Paul, this white horse
[1:11:55] of John is the is the wolves that Paul
[1:11:59] talks about.
[1:12:02] And they started in with false doctrines
[1:12:04] and teachings. And it was just slightly
[1:12:07] off. Yeah. Just an error. That's all it
[1:12:10] was. It was an error. And they went
[1:12:12] forth writing on an error. And brother
[1:12:14] Bram says, if you want to see it in the
[1:12:15] Bible now, you can see it in the book of
[1:12:17] of of Revelations. And it was called the
[1:12:20] deeds
[1:12:22] of the nickelans.
[1:12:24] Right.
[1:12:26] But brother Bram said, but he kept
[1:12:28] riding that same thing until they got to
[1:12:30] Na.
[1:12:32] And that's when they got him a pope. And
[1:12:34] he said, "Now they could crown it." He
[1:12:36] said, "They couldn't crown a spirit, but
[1:12:39] they could crown a pope." He said, "So
[1:12:41] they rode that false teaching until it
[1:12:43] hit Na. And when pagan Rome turned into
[1:12:47] papome, they crowned themselves a
[1:12:49] ruler." And the pope became the crowned
[1:12:53] one. The writer is the devil the whole
[1:12:56] time. But his ministry goes from false
[1:12:59] teaching until it gets into a pope and
[1:13:02] then it becomes crowned. Amen. Can you
[1:13:05] imagine this? The deeds of the nickelans
[1:13:08] become the doctrine of Balum
[1:13:12] and they can't crown it until it gets
[1:13:14] into a man. Now watch this because
[1:13:16] you're seeing this now come forth upon
[1:13:19] them. But the revelation that brother
[1:13:22] Brandham is striking so hard
[1:13:25] is this is not Christ.
[1:13:31] The whole world will worship the image
[1:13:34] of the beast. Yep. Yeah. It's true. The
[1:13:38] mystery of iniquity is already at work.
[1:13:42] That's right. But when a prophet comes
[1:13:44] along, he shines a light and says,
[1:13:47] "There he starts his ride right out of
[1:13:49] Pentecost." Just as soon as the church
[1:13:51] starts, here he comes in false doctrine.
[1:13:54] And the prophet points him out and says
[1:13:55] he's going to ride there and change
[1:13:57] horses here and change horses here. And
[1:14:00] he's going all the way to the
[1:14:01] tribulation. He has a he has say his
[1:14:03] brother said, "Watch it now." And now
[1:14:05] this is this is amazing to me because
[1:14:07] this has been locked up in the in the in
[1:14:09] the book now for 6,000 years. this is
[1:14:11] blocked up that God don't has never gave
[1:14:13] this to nobody. Yeah. Nobody's ever saw
[1:14:16] this until the 1960s when the seals was
[1:14:18] open and then the revelation becomes out
[1:14:21] and for the first time now somebody's
[1:14:23] going to see what God was saying and he
[1:14:25] says it's a white horse. It's an
[1:14:27] antichrist spirit and it'll be crowned
[1:14:29] in na it's got a bow
[1:14:33] but he ain't got any arrows.
[1:14:37] God's great revelation to the church is
[1:14:41] the devil is a liar. That's right.
[1:14:45] Oh, I tell you, brother, if that would
[1:14:47] strike you this morning, that old lying
[1:14:49] devil would lose his power in your life.
[1:14:52] He would lose power of depression and
[1:14:55] anxiety. Listen, I know there's a God
[1:14:58] here this morning. He's not a bluff. And
[1:15:00] I'm not a bluff, but the devil is a
[1:15:03] bluff.
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:05] Huh?
[1:15:06] I know I normally don't preach so long,
[1:15:08] but I got to take a few more minutes.
[1:15:09] JP, I know you'll see the meaning. You
[1:15:12] can't crown no spirit. So, they took a a
[1:15:14] pope and put him up there. But he's a
[1:15:16] bluff. He's an impostor. He don't speak
[1:15:18] for God.
[1:15:20] Do you see that denomination don't speak
[1:15:22] for God?
[1:15:24] My goodness. Amen. What was it that
[1:15:27] doctrine of the nickelans? Come on. And
[1:15:29] what did they do? I I love how Brother
[1:15:31] Bram says this. He said, "What did that
[1:15:33] nicicolein ask for?" Now, nickel is a
[1:15:36] Greek word. Y'all know what it stands
[1:15:38] for? Nicoly. Brother Bram said it means
[1:15:40] conquering the leoty. So, you have one
[1:15:44] holy man and you got a people that is
[1:15:47] subject to that man. So, you know, I
[1:15:49] mean, we could just take all of your Oh,
[1:15:51] God. I better shut up.
[1:15:58] Well, it's not the time on that one. I
[1:16:00] better just let that go.
[1:16:03] Is that wisdom?
[1:16:06] I'm getting older.
[1:16:10] Wait till I get drunker. I'll say it
[1:16:11] anyhow.
[1:16:15] You know that that nickelan.
[1:16:19] Now, there's people who are not
[1:16:20] nickelans but get a nickelan spirit.
[1:16:23] Y'all know that, right? Yeah. And one
[1:16:25] thing I can spot from a long ways off.
[1:16:29] Now, brother Bam says it like this. He
[1:16:31] said, 'What did they ask for? He asked
[1:16:33] them to get away from that bunch of
[1:16:35] people that shouts and claps their hands
[1:16:37] that looks disgraceful like they did on
[1:16:40] Pentecost. See, they act like drunk men,
[1:16:42] staggering in the spirit and things.
[1:16:43] They didn't want none of that stuff.
[1:16:47] They didn't want none of that stuff. Now
[1:16:49] watch the nickel was trying to conquer
[1:16:53] conquer the ley. Tell you how. Listen, I
[1:16:56] there there's there's there's there's
[1:16:58] something I hate is people try to
[1:17:00] dictate worship.
[1:17:03] They tell us to shout and then they tell
[1:17:05] us to not shout. Well, what's it in your
[1:17:06] business?
[1:17:08] If I feel like shouting, I shout. If I
[1:17:10] don't, I won't.
[1:17:14] Why is everybody so tied up whether we
[1:17:16] shout or don't shout? Come on. The
[1:17:18] Bible's full of people shouting and full
[1:17:20] of people quiet.
[1:17:22] Sometimes there's reverence and
[1:17:23] sometimes shouting. The point is the
[1:17:26] spirit must dictate.
[1:17:28] The Holy Spirit dictates, not man
[1:17:30] dictating it. God dictates.
[1:17:33] The prophet of God said, "But the lion
[1:17:35] was what rose up against it." The line,
[1:17:38] you say, "Well, the line, yes, that was
[1:17:40] the force that rose up against the white
[1:17:41] horse rider. It combed the devil with a
[1:17:44] lion spirit." What was the lion? It was
[1:17:47] the boldness of the preaching of the
[1:17:49] gospel. In other words, Paul would
[1:17:51] preach it anyhow. No matter how much the
[1:17:54] the ideas and the swaying of spirits, he
[1:17:57] had a boldness about him where he would
[1:17:59] preach the word of God. Amen. What was
[1:18:01] he doing? He was showing the people,
[1:18:03] Amen, that the nickelan spirit wouldn't
[1:18:06] get what it wanted. Brother Bam said it.
[1:18:08] He said the nickel and what they did, he
[1:18:10] said the the church, he said, was like a
[1:18:12] bunch of poor people, bunch of slaves.
[1:18:14] He said, and they all got in and got the
[1:18:16] Holy Ghost. He said, "So they couldn't
[1:18:18] afford nice buildings." Now you you'll
[1:18:20] you'll see what I'm talking about here.
[1:18:23] He said, "So they got little places of
[1:18:25] worship." And he said they wasn't they
[1:18:26] wasn't nice places. This what they could
[1:18:29] afford and they would go in a bunch of
[1:18:31] poor people and slaves and these
[1:18:33] Gentiles and they would pray and the
[1:18:34] spirit would come and it would move
[1:18:36] among them and they would roll and shout
[1:18:39] and get drunk in the spirit and rejoice
[1:18:41] and preach the gospel and heal the sick
[1:18:43] and raise the dead, speak in tongues.
[1:18:45] All these things were going on among
[1:18:47] them and brother B said but the masters
[1:18:49] of the slaves got to hearing it and
[1:18:51] wanted some of it. Yeah. He said so they
[1:18:54] got to coming down in those little
[1:18:55] churches. He said but they didn't they
[1:18:58] didn't really feel welcome and he said
[1:19:00] people start got ashamed of that kind of
[1:19:02] worship because the higher ups started
[1:19:04] coming in. Wow. He said, "The next thing
[1:19:06] you know, they started trying to get
[1:19:08] business companions to come to church
[1:19:10] with them. And they see see well we want
[1:19:12] the mayor to come, but if the mayor's
[1:19:14] going to come, brother Wayne, please
[1:19:15] don't y'all get don't get a shout
[1:19:17] meeting going. The mayor's going to be
[1:19:19] here.
[1:19:21] Please don't get people weeping and and
[1:19:23] shouting and screaming and dancing.
[1:19:25] They're going to think we're mad. The
[1:19:26] the mayor's coming. The sheriff, the
[1:19:28] governor, the president. Listen, I don't
[1:19:31] care if the president comes." Amen.
[1:19:33] We'll say, "God bless you, brother." and
[1:19:34] then we're going to have a meeting
[1:19:35] anyhow.
[1:19:38] Come on, church. Amen. If somebody's too
[1:19:41] good to worship Jesus Christ, they're
[1:19:43] just too good for their own good. Amen.
[1:19:46] What we really need is an oldfashioned
[1:19:48] Holy Ghost baptism that'll make people
[1:19:51] humble themselves before God. And
[1:19:54] remember, we ain't nothing but dirt. But
[1:19:57] he's the almighty God. And we'll worship
[1:19:59] him in his presence. I believe today, I
[1:20:02] believe it. I believe we won't give the
[1:20:04] devil what he wants. We won't give the
[1:20:05] nickel what he wants. We're going to
[1:20:07] worship God and the dictates of our
[1:20:09] heart because Satan is absolutely a
[1:20:11] bluff. Brother, Satan is a bluff. Let me
[1:20:15] I I don't have time to preach it, but I
[1:20:16] want to tell you this. Satan's a bluff.
[1:20:18] And Jesus spoiled him at Calvary. You
[1:20:20] believe that? Do you believe that Jesus
[1:20:22] actually took everything the devil had
[1:20:24] at Calvary? He so stripped the devil at
[1:20:27] Calvary that he didn't just leave it on
[1:20:29] the earth. He went to hell and he
[1:20:31] spoiled hell. He went to hell and took
[1:20:34] every bit of the weaponry he has. He
[1:20:37] took the keys of death, hell and the
[1:20:40] grave, rose up on the third day in a
[1:20:42] conquering church and gave the Holy
[1:20:44] Ghost. That's right. Said, "Preacher,
[1:20:46] why you say that?" I say he's so spooled
[1:20:48] hell to when the devil started riding
[1:20:50] his horse, Jesus already took his
[1:20:52] arrows. Jesus took the arrows away from
[1:20:55] that devil. And he don't have no arrows
[1:20:57] to shoot this morning. He made him
[1:21:00] powerless.
[1:21:02] Thank you, Jesus. He ain't nothing but a
[1:21:05] bluff. That's right. Let me tell you
[1:21:07] what a prophet of God said. He ain't
[1:21:08] nothing but a bluff. He's a dark shadow.
[1:21:10] That's all he was to a prophet. Wow.
[1:21:13] That's right.
[1:21:15] That's all he was to a prophet. Brother
[1:21:17] Carrie, you've heard it a hundred times
[1:21:18] on tape. Brother Mama starts speaking to
[1:21:20] a certain spirit and he said, "Oh." He
[1:21:22] said, "There it is." And he said, "You
[1:21:24] can y'all see that?" Like we could see
[1:21:25] it, you know. Can y'all see that? He
[1:21:26] said that dark spirit's calling to that
[1:21:28] spirit and that spirit's calling to that
[1:21:30] spirit and they were giving themselves
[1:21:31] away.
[1:21:34] Amen. But all he called it was a dark
[1:21:36] shadow.
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:38] And then in just one moment of light, it
[1:21:41] disappeared.
[1:21:43] Glory. He comes there and he's got two
[1:21:45] women sitting on the front row and he
[1:21:47] says to one sister to the other, he
[1:21:49] said, 'You sitting there, you got a hay
[1:21:50] fever. He said, 'In the name of Jesus,
[1:21:52] you're healed. He said, "Oh, by the way,
[1:21:54] the lady sitting next to you has got hay
[1:21:55] fever." He said, "Lay your hands upon
[1:21:58] her and begin to pray." And brother
[1:22:00] said, "Oh, there it is. I see something
[1:22:02] white and it's shoving something dark
[1:22:05] out of the lady. There it goes." Amen.
[1:22:08] What is it? Amen. Satan is a bluff. He's
[1:22:11] just a shadow. He has no power over this
[1:22:14] church. He has no power over what I
[1:22:17] preach or don't preach, what I shout or
[1:22:20] don't shout. Devil has no power. He's
[1:22:23] nothing but a bluff.
[1:22:27] You say, "You're awful because I know
[1:22:29] where I'm standing. I'm standing on thus
[1:22:32] saith the Lord. Satan is a bluff."
[1:22:36] Let me tell you where he really gets you
[1:22:38] is because he's the bluff. But Sister
[1:22:40] Lily, he tells us we're the bluff. Oh,
[1:22:42] you're just putting on, you know, that
[1:22:44] singing and shouting and that standing
[1:22:46] and clapping. You're just putting on a
[1:22:48] show. No, brother. There's nothing showy
[1:22:50] about what I'm doing. Amen. You The
[1:22:54] funny thing is the bluff calls me a
[1:22:56] bluff. The liar calls me a liar. Amen.
[1:22:59] The deceiver calls me a deceiver. When I
[1:23:02] say the Bible has pulled the shirt off
[1:23:04] of the devil and told every one of you,
[1:23:06] he ain't nothing but a devil. But if you
[1:23:09] want to talk about me, I was a son of
[1:23:12] God before the world began. You want to
[1:23:14] talk about me, my name is in the Lamb's
[1:23:17] Book of Life. You want to talk about me?
[1:23:19] I'm a son of God bought by the blood of
[1:23:22] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] He ain't nothing but a lie.
[1:23:30] I don't know where Zoe's at right now,
[1:23:32] but I'll tell you, he ain't nothing but
[1:23:33] a liar. That's all he is. He ain't
[1:23:35] nothing but a dark shadow of a bluff.
[1:23:38] And I call his bluff in the name of
[1:23:40] Jesus Christ. I rebuke the devil this
[1:23:43] morning that would try to come in and
[1:23:45] say he has power. He has power. He ain't
[1:23:48] got any power. My God has the power.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah.
[1:23:54] I know what he's up to. I know what he's
[1:23:56] He's a Goliath and he's so big and he
[1:23:59] tried to push you in a corner, Sister
[1:24:01] Laura, because But listen, you don't
[1:24:03] have to go in no corner. You got the
[1:24:04] name of the Lord. Amen. You ain't got to
[1:24:07] go in no corner. You got the name of the
[1:24:09] Lord. Amen. So, preacher, what are you
[1:24:11] talking about? I'm talking about
[1:24:12] something in the message where the
[1:24:14] prophet of God said that a man had a
[1:24:16] dream and a and a little spirit stepped
[1:24:17] in the room with him and he was a little
[1:24:19] scared so he backed up
[1:24:22] and the devil got bigger. He went from a
[1:24:25] white horse to a red, didn't he? And he
[1:24:26] backed up and he went from a red horse
[1:24:28] to a black one and went from a black one
[1:24:30] to a pale one. And that old boy just
[1:24:32] kept backing up until he come all the
[1:24:35] way to a corner. Oh Lord. And he
[1:24:37] couldn't go no he's at the end time. He
[1:24:40] can't go no further. What are you going
[1:24:42] to do? How you going to get out of this?
[1:24:43] How's it going to happen? I tell you
[1:24:45] what what the prophet said. He said the
[1:24:47] fell looked around and he didn't have
[1:24:48] any weapons, but there was a Bible
[1:24:51] laying there. And he picked up that
[1:24:53] Bible. Well, I tell you the only weapon
[1:24:55] I got this morning is the Bible. It's
[1:24:57] the revelation of the word of God. But
[1:24:59] he took that Bible and said, "Boo
[1:25:01] devil."
[1:25:03] And the devil got a little smaller. And
[1:25:05] he said, "Boo devil." And the devil got
[1:25:07] a little smaller. And I say this
[1:25:09] morning, it's time to remember how to
[1:25:11] tell the devil, "Boo! Boo devil! Boo
[1:25:14] devil!" We don't have to back up. We
[1:25:16] don't have to take second place. We
[1:25:18] don't have to ask the devil if we can
[1:25:20] shout or we can praise or we can
[1:25:23] rejoice. We are the children
[1:25:26] of the most high God that have stood
[1:25:28] under the opening of this word. And I am
[1:25:31] positive sure. Yes, sir. Go, brother.
[1:25:35] The devil is an impersonating bluff.
[1:25:37] Yes, he is. That's a liar without any
[1:25:40] arrows.
[1:25:42] But you're the children of God that's
[1:25:44] from the beginning and will not go into
[1:25:47] tribulation. Stand to your feet with me
[1:25:50] this morning. Glory. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:25:52] your name. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:25:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to your
[1:26:00] name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:03] Hallelujah. Peace above. Hallelujah.
[1:26:07] Glory to your name, God. He's a liar.
[1:26:09] Glory to your name, Father. He's liar.
[1:26:12] Hallelujah. He's told lies, brother.
[1:26:15] He's told, "Oh, Mary, Martha will never
[1:26:17] get out of that bed." He's a liar. Amen.
[1:26:20] Nothing but a liar. He's a liar. That's
[1:26:22] right.
[1:26:24] Bethany will never get better. Liar.
[1:26:29] Amen. Cuz we're not looking forward to
[1:26:30] get better. She's already better.
[1:26:34] That's right.
[1:26:38] Yes.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah. What was what was that? What
[1:26:42] was that opposing spirit? It was a lion.
[1:26:46] Nothing but blood. God, I pray the lion
[1:26:48] spirit returned to the church from
[1:26:50] knowing who they are.
[1:26:52] Knowing exactly who they are.
[1:26:56] And when seven thunders had uttered the
[1:26:58] voice, it was a line that roared.
[1:27:03] Truth has come.
[1:27:04] Hallelujah.
[1:27:07] Silence was upon the earth.
[1:27:11] Why was it so silent?
[1:27:16] Brother Brand said, "Cuz the king was
[1:27:17] speaking."
[1:27:19] That thunder was a voice, but not just
[1:27:21] any voice. It was the voice of the
[1:27:22] creator.
[1:27:23] The lion hath roared.
[1:27:26] And out in the jungle when the lion
[1:27:28] roars, the elephants and the monkeys and
[1:27:31] every creature just goes quiet. That's
[1:27:34] right.
[1:27:36] That's what happened. See, all of you
[1:27:38] had your name in the book.
[1:27:42] It's kind of like a It's kind of like a
[1:27:44] real rich uncle dying. You don't know.
[1:27:46] And they said there's going to be a a
[1:27:48] reading of the wheel.
[1:27:51] And everybody comes. I'm going to get
[1:27:53] the house. I'm going to get the car. I'm
[1:27:55] going to get
[1:27:57] people that don't even know him. I'm
[1:27:59] going to get this and I'm going to get
[1:28:00] this and
[1:28:02] Isn't it odd to hear so many churches
[1:28:04] say of their inheritance and what they
[1:28:06] are and who they are. Oh Lord, and
[1:28:09] everybody's talking, everybody's
[1:28:10] speaking
[1:28:13] when the authority comes out. And so now
[1:28:16] we're going to now have the reading of
[1:28:17] the will of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:20] written before the foundation of the
[1:28:21] world opened under seven seals. It's the
[1:28:25] third pull of my ministry. And here is
[1:28:27] the inheritance that's in the book. And
[1:28:30] he begins to speak the names.
[1:28:34] Hallelujah. You're talking about a quiet
[1:28:36] crowd.
[1:28:38] Oh, you're quiet until you hear your
[1:28:41] name. Amen. That's right.
[1:28:45] I got the car.
[1:28:47] I got the mansion.
[1:28:52] You Well, I think I got the mansion. But
[1:28:53] see, you ain't moving into nothing.
[1:28:56] Till you get the title
[1:28:59] with your name. That's right, Zach. They
[1:29:01] can accept the offer,
[1:29:05] but till the title's in your name, you
[1:29:07] ain't going to build nothing in there or
[1:29:09] replace the floors or nothing else.
[1:29:12] But when it's yours,
[1:29:14] your name's on it. You got faith to move
[1:29:17] in. You got faith to get in the car and
[1:29:20] drive off this morning. You don't have
[1:29:22] to look in the mirror and see if the
[1:29:23] troopers are going to pull you over.
[1:29:27] Brother Ray, somebody gave me a very
[1:29:30] nice Cadillac.
[1:29:32] But till the title was in my name, I
[1:29:35] wasn't driving that baby.
[1:29:40] Cuz they pull me over and go, "Boy, you
[1:29:41] ain't got money for this car. Where'd
[1:29:42] you get it?"
[1:29:46] But if I had my title and I got my name.
[1:29:50] That's right.
[1:29:51] I ain't worried about no troopers.
[1:29:55] They walk up to the car, well, ain't
[1:29:56] this nice
[1:29:59] cuz it's mine.
[1:30:03] And I tell you this morning, God gave it
[1:30:05] to you.
[1:30:06] It's not a bluff.
[1:30:09] It's the truth. Amen.
[1:30:12] It's the truth. But Ben, you got
[1:30:14] something.
