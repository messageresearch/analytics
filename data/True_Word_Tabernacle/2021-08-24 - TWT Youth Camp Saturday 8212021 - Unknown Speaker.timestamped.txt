[1:04:58] cancer for over a year and a half now
[1:05:01] and still dealing with the effects but
[1:05:04] father I believe that you are coming
[1:05:06] here to give us nothing less than full
[1:05:10] Victory and so father I I I ask God not
[1:05:13] only for my father sake Ron Spencer but
[1:05:17] for every person that's been touched by
[1:05:19] cancer any of the residual effects of
[1:05:22] anybody that has that has dealt with Co
[1:05:25] and dealing with different things Lord
[1:05:27] in their body we pray that you'd be
[1:05:29] mindful now Lord I'm aware that there's
[1:05:32] mothers here that that have little
[1:05:34] children and sometimes it's it's a
[1:05:36] little bit difficult to get something
[1:05:38] out of service with a little child and I
[1:05:42] just pray father that you'd be mindful
[1:05:44] of them tonight I pray that you'd
[1:05:46] minister to each and every one of us in
[1:05:48] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if
[1:05:53] you have your Bibles we'd like to look
[1:05:54] over and in the Book of Joel chapter
[1:05:58] 2 verse
[1:06:04] 25 Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 and then
[1:06:07] down to Acts chapter
[1:06:11] 2 and as you're finding your way there
[1:06:14] I'd like to I'd like to read you a quote
[1:06:17] this evening from the message hear ye
[1:06:20] him
[1:06:27] brandom said he saidthe numbers don't
[1:06:29] mean whether Christ is there or
[1:06:32] not it's the attitude of the people
[1:06:36] that's in the number what determines
[1:06:39] it you can take an egg that a hen is
[1:06:43] supposed to set on to Hatchet and you
[1:06:46] could put the egg in an incubator where
[1:06:48] it's just a warm light that incubator
[1:06:50] will hatch the egg just the same as the
[1:06:53] chick or the hen will itself because
[1:06:56] it's the
[1:06:58] atmosphere that does the
[1:07:00] hatching it's the same thing in a
[1:07:03] meeting of this type it could be
[1:07:05] possible tonight and also probable that
[1:07:08] it will be that there could be an hour
[1:07:11] of this next hour on that clock that
[1:07:14] there wouldn't be one Center or
[1:07:15] backslider left in here without being
[1:07:18] right with
[1:07:19] God it could be that every sick and
[1:07:22] Afflicted person could be made well and
[1:07:25] go go out of here glorifying
[1:07:28] God this could break into a repeat of
[1:07:32] Pentecost if the atmosphere gets
[1:07:36] right see the atmosphere to bring such
[1:07:39] results would be the Holy Spirit and if
[1:07:43] he can get every heart in one Accord
[1:07:46] then he could just move masses and heal
[1:07:48] the people save the people or whatever
[1:07:51] he has died to redeem them and every
[1:07:54] Redemptive blood blessings belongs to
[1:07:57] the individual I want you to believe
[1:08:00] that Christian Joel 2 and verse
[1:08:04] 25 and I will restore to you the years
[1:08:08] that the Locust have eaten the canker
[1:08:10] wor the caterpiller and the Palmer worm
[1:08:12] my great Army which I sent among you and
[1:08:15] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:08:18] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:08:21] that hath dwelt wondrously with you and
[1:08:24] my people shall never be ashamed and you
[1:08:27] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:08:28] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:08:31] and none else and my people shall never
[1:08:34] be ashamed are you his
[1:08:36] people and it shall come to pass
[1:08:38] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:08:40] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:08:43] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:08:46] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[1:08:47] see visions and also upon the servants
[1:08:51] and upon the handmaidens in those days
[1:08:53] will I pour out my spirit
[1:08:56] acts chap 2 and verse
[1:08:59] one do you love the Lord this
[1:09:06] evening he's a great big
[1:09:10] God Acts chapter 2 and verse one you say
[1:09:15] Amen when you have it this
[1:09:17] evening I don't want to leave anybody
[1:09:21] El and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:09:23] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:09:27] in one place and suddenly there came a
[1:09:29] sound from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty
[1:09:31] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:09:33] they were sitting and there appeared
[1:09:35] unto them clothing tongues like as a
[1:09:37] fire and it sh and it sat upon each of
[1:09:40] them and they were all filled with the
[1:09:43] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:09:46] tongues as the spirit gave utterance and
[1:09:49] there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[1:09:51] devout men out of every nation under
[1:09:55] heaven now when this was noised abroad
[1:09:57] the multitude came together and were
[1:10:00] confounded because that every man heard
[1:10:03] them speak in unknown in in his own
[1:10:05] language and they were all amazed and
[1:10:08] marveled saying saying one to another
[1:10:10] behold are not all these which speak
[1:10:13] galileans and how hear we every man in
[1:10:16] our own tongue wherein we were born
[1:10:19] parthians and Mees and elamites and the
[1:10:22] Dwellers in MotoMia and and Judea and
[1:10:25] capid doia and imp pontis and Asia FIA
[1:10:29] and filia and Egypt and in the parts of
[1:10:32] Libya about Serene and strangers of Rome
[1:10:35] Jews and prelit cits and Arabians we do
[1:10:38] hear them speak in our own tongues the
[1:10:40] wonderful works of God and they were all
[1:10:43] amazed and were in doubt saying one to
[1:10:45] another what meanthis maybe you're
[1:10:48] sitting here tonight and you're
[1:10:49] wondering what
[1:10:50] meanthis others mocking said these men
[1:10:54] are full of wine and here's Peter's
[1:10:57] first sermon and Peter standing up with
[1:11:00] the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto
[1:11:02] them ye men of Judea and all ye that
[1:11:04] dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto
[1:11:07] you and hearken to my words for these
[1:11:09] are not drunk as you suppose seeing it
[1:11:11] is but the third hour of the day but
[1:11:14] this is that which was spoken by the
[1:11:17] prophet Joel and it shall come to pass
[1:11:20] in the last day saith God that I will
[1:11:22] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[1:11:25] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:11:27] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:11:28] visions and your old men shall dream
[1:11:31] dreams and on my servants and on my
[1:11:33] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[1:11:36] days of my spirit and they shall
[1:11:39] prophesy may God bless his word you may
[1:11:42] be seated in the presence of the Lord
[1:11:44] I'd like to speak to you this evening by
[1:11:46] the help of the Lord on
[1:11:48] this this is
[1:11:51] that this is that and the think that
[1:11:55] today that we're living in one of the
[1:11:57] most grandest days that man has ever
[1:11:59] stood in when our Prophet would say that
[1:12:02] if I could have chosen any day to live
[1:12:04] in I would have chosen this day to be
[1:12:06] living in this hour when we are watching
[1:12:09] the the revealing of the son of man when
[1:12:11] we're watching the very winding up of
[1:12:13] all the prophecies that's that's been
[1:12:15] laying there for for a last for the last
[1:12:18] age and for the people of the last age
[1:12:20] and here we are we're watching a the
[1:12:22] blending of Dimensions where you're
[1:12:24] watching eternity blend in with Time and
[1:12:27] Time begin to blend in with eternity and
[1:12:29] here we are living out what the prophet
[1:12:32] had said and these very things are being
[1:12:35] fulfilled right in the midst of each and
[1:12:37] every one of us and and what an
[1:12:39] opportunity that you young people have
[1:12:41] been given in this hour to be living in
[1:12:43] the last of days and I don't believe
[1:12:45] that there's another generation coming
[1:12:47] but I believe that this is the last
[1:12:49] generation but what an opportunity that
[1:12:52] you and I have to rise to our feet to
[1:12:54] grab a of this message that has changed
[1:12:57] your life and got a hold of your
[1:12:59] family's life what an opportunity that
[1:13:01] we have been given to raise our hands in
[1:13:04] Victory to to stand out upon thus saith
[1:13:07] the Lord when when men are are heady and
[1:13:10] high minded and they're lovers of
[1:13:11] pleasure you are a young people that
[1:13:14] love the very things of God and and
[1:13:16] brother Brandon would say that we have
[1:13:17] been given such an opportunity that that
[1:13:20] that Elijah would long to see an
[1:13:22] opportunity like this and we have an
[1:13:24] opport opportunity that St Paul never
[1:13:26] dreamed of or Enoch or Elijah and all
[1:13:28] those things and to think about that you
[1:13:31] and I have an opportunity this evening
[1:13:33] to receive a holy ghost that David never
[1:13:36] he he never was able to to receive fully
[1:13:39] on the inside of his soul but yet it
[1:13:41] would come and anoint him and hear you
[1:13:43] an hour standing in an hour when the
[1:13:45] when the very pouring out of the Holy
[1:13:47] Ghost is coming not just a not just a a
[1:13:51] an isua an experience but here we are
[1:13:54] living where we are baptized with the
[1:13:57] very life of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:13:59] Holy Ghost which is God himself and
[1:14:02] we're living in the last of days when
[1:14:04] you go and read over in the Book of
[1:14:05] Revelations and you begin to look over
[1:14:08] there and you can see the seven Church
[1:14:09] ages and you can see that there is one
[1:14:11] that is walking in the midst of them in
[1:14:13] the midst of the golden candlesticks and
[1:14:15] that is a proof to you that Jesus is not
[1:14:18] somewhere off in another day but Jesus
[1:14:21] is walking right in the midst of a young
[1:14:23] people that are called by his name that
[1:14:26] are that are baptized in his name and to
[1:14:28] realize this evening that that if you
[1:14:30] could just let your imagination loose to
[1:14:33] begin to think about how that God felt
[1:14:35] when he was holding those seven stars in
[1:14:37] his hands and there he was and he was he
[1:14:39] would disperse uh he would disperse Paul
[1:14:42] to the to the Ephesian age and he would
[1:14:44] disperse the other one a and God would
[1:14:47] have characteristics in each of the
[1:14:49] seven Church age Messengers that would
[1:14:51] be identified of that day and I'm so
[1:14:54] glad to be identified with this last
[1:14:56] messenger of this day but you could you
[1:14:59] imagine as God begins to release he
[1:15:01] begins to release those stars to go out
[1:15:03] to that age and begin to watch as that
[1:15:06] message would go forth and there would
[1:15:08] be a people that would grab a hold of
[1:15:09] that anointing I believe that this is
[1:15:13] that that was spoken in the word of God
[1:15:16] and we realize that that that no no no
[1:15:20] no prophecy is of no interpretation but
[1:15:23] we realize that God has given it and we
[1:15:26] look back in the Bible and you can see
[1:15:28] that men would go out and they would
[1:15:30] prophesy and prophecy would come upon
[1:15:32] them and they would speak out things but
[1:15:35] it did not come by the very will of man
[1:15:37] but it was men that were moved by the
[1:15:40] Holy Ghost and they would speak things
[1:15:42] and you would watch men like Isaiah and
[1:15:44] he would speak something maybe he didn't
[1:15:46] understand everything that he was saying
[1:15:48] but it was a prophecy and that which God
[1:15:51] has used in that day has used again in
[1:15:53] this day and there that man of God when
[1:15:56] thus safe the Lord would come across his
[1:15:58] lips no matter what happened no matter
[1:16:00] the critics that would rise no matter
[1:16:02] how many would doubt that there would be
[1:16:04] a virgin that would conceive it had to
[1:16:06] be fulfilled because it was coming not
[1:16:09] out of the will of man but it was coming
[1:16:11] out of the very mind of God and to think
[1:16:14] today that you and I are living in an
[1:16:16] hour where the very Mind Of God has been
[1:16:19] poured out and dispersed in this hour we
[1:16:22] are living in an hour where we can say
[1:16:25] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:16:28] our ears what men would love to see what
[1:16:30] Wesley would love to see when they
[1:16:32] looked out in the man age when they look
[1:16:34] out there and they would grab and bring
[1:16:36] some of the greatest Ministries and some
[1:16:38] of the greatest sermons that you would
[1:16:40] ever hear but yet they could not come up
[1:16:42] to where you are living at because they
[1:16:44] were only living in the light of their
[1:16:47] day but this is another day this ain't
[1:16:50] the day of man this is the eag anointing
[1:16:53] and there is a people that are under
[1:16:55] that ego anointing and they're not just
[1:16:57] looking at what they see they're looking
[1:16:59] past what they see they have a prophetic
[1:17:02] vision and they're looking past what
[1:17:04] they see in Lota they're looking past
[1:17:07] covid they're looking past uh turmo
[1:17:09] they're looking past circumstances they
[1:17:11] are looking with the eyes of an eagle
[1:17:14] and they're looking out there and they
[1:17:16] realize that I am that one I will be
[1:17:18] that one that overcomes lotos
[1:17:21] here hallelujah you young people may not
[1:17:25] realize where you're sitting at but you
[1:17:27] are the final Runners to the final age
[1:17:30] you have a voice to be sounded out and
[1:17:32] if the enemy tries to shut you up you
[1:17:35] speak up if the enemy tries to tell you
[1:17:37] this message ain't right stand there be
[1:17:40] a man be a woman and daughter of God be
[1:17:43] ye quick like men be strong in the Lord
[1:17:46] be strong in the
[1:17:50] Lord this is your
[1:17:52] hour this is do that you remember when
[1:17:57] brother Brandon would begin to talk
[1:17:58] about that Chinese laundryman how he how
[1:18:00] he would first come over here and how
[1:18:02] that he would he didn't know how to
[1:18:04] write or know necessarily how to speak
[1:18:06] things exactly in the minds of contract
[1:18:09] of what we would think an American but
[1:18:10] he would come over here and there he
[1:18:12] would run that laundry M and you would
[1:18:15] go in there and you take and you would
[1:18:16] drop off you drop off your old clothes
[1:18:19] and when he would when you would go in
[1:18:21] there he didn't give you a slip and
[1:18:22] write something down on it but he would
[1:18:24] have a piece of paper that he would that
[1:18:26] he would rip down the middle and when
[1:18:28] you took your dirty clothes in there
[1:18:31] before you could ever get them back
[1:18:32] clean there had to be a contract that
[1:18:34] was sitting there there had to be there
[1:18:37] had to be something that would dovetail
[1:18:39] and match up to everything that was on
[1:18:42] his side of things and before you can
[1:18:44] ever get your dirty clothes back clean
[1:18:47] you got to have the other side of the
[1:18:49] contract but here we are living an hour
[1:18:52] and we realize that that Jesus Christ
[1:18:55] of the New Testament matched up with
[1:18:57] everything of Jehovah of the Old
[1:19:00] Testament and we're looking out there
[1:19:02] and we see one part of the contract and
[1:19:04] brother brandham said I believe this
[1:19:06] with all of my sincerity that the
[1:19:08] message of the hour matches everything
[1:19:11] that was said in this day so you're
[1:19:13] watching the two pieces of the contract
[1:19:16] have come together you and Christ are
[1:19:18] not Twain but you are one so let me say
[1:19:21] this to you as thus sayith the Lord you
[1:19:24] cannot be destroyed you're a part of the
[1:19:27] contract veiled by the Holy Ghost filled
[1:19:30] with an anointing filled with an Eagle
[1:19:32] Eye sitting out there saying I am who I
[1:19:35] am because the I am tells me who I am I
[1:19:38] can't be destroyed I can't be
[1:19:41] stoed I am what the prophet saw coming
[1:19:45] out of the vision I am the prophet's
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:51] prophecy see God has always had a
[1:19:54] promise that was hanging over top of his
[1:19:57] children in the days of Abraham it was a
[1:20:00] it was a time for the promised son in
[1:20:03] the days of Jacob it was time for a
[1:20:05] Joseph that would be that would be hated
[1:20:08] of the Brethren it would be time for
[1:20:10] Joseph to rise and there his Brethren
[1:20:12] would bow before him he would rise in
[1:20:14] position though it didn't look like it
[1:20:16] was coming but yet there was a prophecy
[1:20:18] that was laying there that his brothers
[1:20:20] would bow before him but you see even
[1:20:23] though that prophecy was was laying
[1:20:25] there Faith had to be awakened to see
[1:20:28] that this was the time of the prophet's
[1:20:30] prophecy and God does things in ways
[1:20:33] that you and I can't necessarily
[1:20:35] understand but we realize that the only
[1:20:38] thing that you have to do in deity of
[1:20:39] Jesus Christ he said the only thing that
[1:20:41] you have to do is when you see something
[1:20:44] in the Bible that sounds just a little
[1:20:46] bit Mystic and a little superstitious to
[1:20:49] you just give God a little bit of time
[1:20:51] God's in no hurry we're the ones that
[1:20:53] get in the hurt we just give God just
[1:20:56] give just give God just a little bit of
[1:20:59] time and you'll see the old prophetic
[1:21:01] Wheels cogs run up right in the picture
[1:21:04] it'll develop just like the bringing up
[1:21:06] of a picture you see many times we get
[1:21:09] caught up in the time of delay and we
[1:21:12] think well this is the way God needs to
[1:21:13] do things and this is the way that we're
[1:21:15] expecting it to do if you're not careful
[1:21:18] you'll put God In The Box and when God
[1:21:20] will actually be moving by your way
[1:21:22] you've got God so boxed up that you
[1:21:25] can't see him when he's passing by I
[1:21:27] would I would tonight that you would let
[1:21:29] God out of your box out of your ideas or
[1:21:32] what you think the message is what you
[1:21:34] think what's got to happen in this hour
[1:21:37] I would to God that you let God out of
[1:21:38] the box and let God be God if he's God
[1:21:42] let him be God if he's strong let him be
[1:21:45] strong if he is a Healer let him be a
[1:21:46] Healer if he's a way maker let him be a
[1:21:48] way maker the word of God it might be
[1:21:52] slow but it's sure and I want you to
[1:21:54] know it may look like that Judas is
[1:21:56] having the last life it's having the
[1:21:59] last life the last life but here we are
[1:22:01] in this hour Judas can laugh always he's
[1:22:03] want he's come and kiss the son of man
[1:22:06] but it's a time that the Disciples of
[1:22:09] God rise up out of
[1:22:11] that you ain't been called to this hour
[1:22:14] to go down and defeat you've been called
[1:22:16] into this hour to come out as The
[1:22:20] Undefeated Judas can mock all he wants
[1:22:23] to but we know where we're standing at
[1:22:25] you just wait Judas laugh all you want
[1:22:27] to make fun all you want to just give me
[1:22:29] three
[1:22:31] days give me three days it may look like
[1:22:34] I'm defeated it may look like I'm
[1:22:36] whipped I might go in a corner and I
[1:22:37] might pout about it but you give me
[1:22:39] three days on Sunday Jesus is coming out
[1:22:43] and this is the rising of the
[1:22:51] sun it's a new day it's an hour here we
[1:22:56] are living in the hour where the very
[1:22:59] headship of Christ is being identified
[1:23:02] with the
[1:23:04] body with the body which is called his
[1:23:07] children in this hour now you remember

[1:23:51] was showing us that God's three-fold
[1:23:53] purpose firstly it was God to express
[1:23:57] himself in Christ secondly it was to
[1:24:00] come and have the preeminence in his
[1:24:01] body thirdly it was to restore the
[1:24:04] kingdom back to its rightful position
[1:24:06] again and if you go and listen to that

[1:28:09] anointed to take my giant
[1:28:15] down what's going on here this is
[1:28:21] that I don't understand why those young
[1:28:23] people people are acting like the way
[1:28:25] they are they have seen themsel in the
[1:28:28] word and Paul said in the book of
[1:28:31] Hebrews he said let us lay aside every
[1:28:34] weight and sin that does so easily beset
[1:28:36] us and let us run let us run with
[1:28:40] patience or race that is set before us I
[1:28:42] want to tell you young people you're not
[1:28:44] running without a message you got the
[1:28:46] king scepter in your hand and anybody
[1:28:48] that gets in your way you can stand toe
[1:28:51] to- Toe with the devil said I got a
[1:28:52] king's message in my hand
[1:28:54] it's a time to
[1:29:02] run when Jesus you can be seated if you
[1:29:05] want to or if you can but when Jesus
[1:29:09] when Jesus is making his triumphal entry
[1:29:13] into the city of Jerusalem brother
[1:29:15] random goes over and anointed ones or
[1:29:18] excuse me what is the attraction on the
[1:29:20] mountain he goes in there and he picks
[1:29:22] up Matthew chapter 21
[1:29:24] and there you see there you see a man
[1:29:27] that is riding on a white donkey coming
[1:29:29] down off of a hill what is it brother
[1:29:31] brandom said he said there's an unusual
[1:29:33] people out there there's an unusual
[1:29:35] event that's going on he said what it is
[1:29:38] it's history being made and it's
[1:29:40] prophecy that's being fulfilled and he
[1:29:43] said what you're seeing is that prophecy
[1:29:46] that was laying back there in Zachariah
[1:29:48] and it's coming to pass right here in
[1:29:49] this hour and here brother random goes
[1:29:52] in there and there you watch Jesus in
[1:29:55] Matthew chapter 21 as he's coming down
[1:29:57] off of Jerusalem's Hill making his entry
[1:30:00] this is not an entry of defeat but this
[1:30:03] is an entry of Victory you might look at
[1:30:06] calvary's Hill and you might see Jesus
[1:30:08] dying but I want you to know he did not
[1:30:10] go down in De feat he went there for
[1:30:14] you and if God does anything he does it
[1:30:17] for his
[1:30:19] children he didn't come just to show
[1:30:22] that he could die and just to show that
[1:30:24] he could get off the cross he didn't
[1:30:25] just come to get out of a tomb but he
[1:30:28] come to pay a debt so that you didn't
[1:30:30] have to go to a devil's hell so that you
[1:30:32] didn't have to go down there but while
[1:30:34] he was down there he went down there and
[1:30:36] he preached to the souls that were in
[1:30:38] prison but when he went down there he
[1:30:40] dropped off a
[1:30:42] load he dropped off a load what was he
[1:30:45] dropping off he was dropping off your
[1:30:52] sin so you can say to the devil what
[1:30:57] sin what
[1:30:59] circumstance what
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:05] disease oh come on somebody I'm not
[1:31:08] carrying this load No More Jesus Jesus
[1:31:12] got a hold of my life 2,000 years ago I
[1:31:16] won the victory when I was with Jesus I
[1:31:19] won the victory
[1:31:28] and Jesus is making his way
[1:31:31] off off of the hill and there they are
[1:31:35] breaking palm branches and there they
[1:31:37] are laying out their robes out into the
[1:31:40] street and they start singing hosana to
[1:31:43] the highest blessed is he that cometh in
[1:31:47] the name of the Lord and they begin to
[1:31:50] say who is
[1:31:51] this I have just I have just been a part
[1:31:55] of a meeting I have just been a part of
[1:31:58] a supernatural event but blessed is he
[1:32:01] that comes in the name of the Lord you
[1:32:04] remember in 1959 when brother brandom he
[1:32:07] said he was holding a Revival there on
[1:32:09] the Holy Ghost and he preaches three
[1:32:11] sermons on what is the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:13] what was the Holy Ghost given for and
[1:32:16] then a few days later brother brandom
[1:32:18] holds question and answers on the Holy
[1:32:20] Ghost and there in that service before
[1:32:23] there was a tongue and interpretation
[1:32:26] that had came forth and while brother
[1:32:28] brandom was speaking these things he
[1:32:30] said it was a Vindication of what the
[1:32:32] message was that came forth he said I
[1:32:35] was saying blessed is he that cometh in
[1:32:38] the name of the Lord he said but then
[1:32:40] there came forth a Vindication but
[1:32:42] blessed is he that comes in this blessed
[1:32:45] is he who believes that this is the
[1:32:48] Lord's coming blessed is he listen to me
[1:32:51] blessed is he that believes that the the
[1:32:54] Lord has come in this do you realize
[1:32:57] you're the most powerful people on the
[1:32:59] face of the Earth you're the most
[1:33:01] blessed people there is upon the face of
[1:33:03] the Earth the Book of Revelation says
[1:33:06] blessed is he that readeth and heareth
[1:33:08] these words and understands this
[1:33:10] prophecy if you have recognized yourself
[1:33:14] in the
[1:33:15] book you are blessed blessed are your
[1:33:18] eyes for you see blessed are your ears
[1:33:20] for you hear you are blessed blessed
[1:33:23] when you come in bless when you go out
[1:33:25] he said I'll make you the head and not
[1:33:27] the tail blessed is he that believes who
[1:33:30] is this MDC it's none other than Jesus
[1:33:34] Christ the same
[1:33:37] yesterday
[1:33:38] today and
[1:33:42] forever what's that about what's that
[1:33:45] about going what's that about right
[1:33:47] there what's it about them young people
[1:33:49] right

[1:33:54] stopping their
[1:33:56] shout I'm not going to be guilty for
[1:33:58] standing in the way of them getting
[1:33:59] their
[1:34:00] Victory if you stop their shout you're
[1:34:03] stopping their Victory you may not
[1:34:05] understand why these young girls are
[1:34:07] dancing and shouting the way they are
[1:34:09] it's just a sign of
[1:34:12] Victory and if you stop their dance and
[1:34:16] if you stop their shout you are guilty
[1:34:19] for stopping the son of man coming in
[1:34:22] Victory I won't stop no matter the

[1:40:41] before they got it and if you ain't felt
[1:40:43] him yet why don't you go ahead and thank
[1:40:45] him for the Holy Ghost if you ain't felt

[1:41:03] flesh and receive you the Holy Ghost but
[1:41:06] when they got up there and they got in
[1:41:08] one Accord and in one mind they begin to
[1:41:11] praise God they begin to sing songs unto
[1:41:14] the Lord they begin to bless His holy
[1:41:16] name they had it in seed form but it not
[1:41:18] yet made manifest but when the day of
[1:41:21] Pentecost was fully come the promise
[1:41:24] that was hanging over them was no longer
[1:41:26] in seed form it was manifested and they
[1:41:30] broke out of that
[1:41:32] room they broke out of St

[1:42:17] here and I am one of them that's going
[1:42:20] to run this message I'm going to take it
[1:42:22] I'm going to take it to my dying days
[1:42:24] I'm going to believe this thing I'm
[1:42:26] going to run with this thing Mama come
[1:42:28] on over
[1:42:29] here what are you doing brother Andrew
[1:42:31] I'm trying to get you to look into the
[1:42:35] mirror it ain't somebody different it's
[1:42:38] Jesus that's standing there why' they
[1:42:41] get so confused with William brandom
[1:42:44] they saw so much of Jesus on the inside
[1:42:47] of that little frame of a man of a
[1:42:49] Kentucky hillbilly they seen Jesus in
[1:42:52] there and some worship him but this
[1:42:54] ain't some man
[1:42:56] worship this ain't some Prophet worship
[1:43:00] this is the worshiping of the Holy
[1:43:04] Ghost and if you'd get baptized you
[1:43:06] could have the same spirit that William
[1:43:08] brandham
[1:43:16] had well that was for Brother brandham
[1:43:19] The Works that I do say you do also
[1:43:21] where did it say William brandham right
[1:43:23] there he said if you believe me ask
[1:43:26] anything in my name and you will do this
[1:43:28] you can stand there all you want to but
[1:43:30] I happen to believe with all of my heart
[1:43:32] that just young people have a chance at
[1:43:35] the revelation of this word brother
[1:43:37] random said every young person every
[1:43:39] generation had a fren a fresh chance at
[1:43:42] the word I'm not going to stand in the
[1:43:44] way of them getting their chance at the
[1:43:46] Holy Ghost brother Andrew you better be
[1:43:48] careful you better be careful you know
[1:43:50] brother brandom told us that we better
[1:43:52] not live we better not jump no higher
[1:43:54] than we're living I've heard that all my
[1:43:56] life and I've heard people say you know
[1:43:58] what you better be careful you're going
[1:44:00] to jump higher than you living why don't
[1:44:01] you start living higher so you can start
[1:44:03] jumping
[1:44:04] [Applause]
[1:44:19] higher 42 in
[1:44:21] Caribou it was
[1:44:24] prophecy but up there on that mountain
[1:44:26] it became fulfilled Silver Tip grizzly
[1:44:29] bear it was a prophecy but there upon
[1:44:32] that mountain what is that bill well all
[1:44:36] I can say it's a silver tip grizzly bear
[1:44:39] what was it what that which was in
[1:44:41] Prophecy was now fulfilled there for two
[1:44:44] years there was a boy that was over
[1:44:46] there that he seen and there was a
[1:44:48] country that had rocks all over pine
[1:44:50] trees setting the course and everybody
[1:44:52] had it in the fly leaf of their Bible it
[1:44:54] was once held in Prophecy but when he
[1:44:57] got over there on that finished border
[1:44:59] and they seen that little boy laying
[1:45:01] there in that condition he saw him
[1:45:03] laying there in that condition and he
[1:45:05] looked at and said oh my I begin to
[1:45:07] think if that was my Billy or if that
[1:45:09] was my son how I would feel and I began
[1:45:11] to walk back and there was a hand laid
[1:45:13] on me he said go and look at it again I
[1:45:16] want to be that voice to speak to you if
[1:45:18] you have turned away from this I want to
[1:45:20] be the one to lay my hand on you come
[1:45:22] back and look at this
[1:45:24] again come on back over here and look at
[1:45:26] this one more time that dead man could
[1:45:29] be your boy matter of fact it could be
[1:45:34] you that which was held in Prophecy when
[1:45:37] it was over there when brother brandom
[1:45:39] realized that that was the boy that was
[1:45:42] in the vision he said Jack go get your
[1:45:44] Bible is this not the scene and he said
[1:45:47] look at that panoramic look at
[1:45:49] everything everything's in order brother
[1:45:51] brandom I happen to believe that's boy
[1:45:53] he said you could line up every single
[1:45:55] devil in hell he said you could call me
[1:45:58] a false prophet if that boy is not up
[1:46:01] off of the ground in five minutes call
[1:46:03] me a false prophet you can't call him a
[1:46:05] false prophet because that boy got up
[1:46:08] out of
[1:46:11] that you're not going to call me a false
[1:46:13] prophet and you're not going to call me
[1:46:15] a false preacher but right here in this
[1:46:17] meeting there's going to be somebody
[1:46:19] that gets up out of their dead condition
[1:46:32] you're standing here under the greatest
[1:46:34] ministry that's ever been released it's
[1:46:36] been circled around the world seven
[1:46:39] times miracles on top of Miracles I've
[1:46:42] met some of those Miracles I've sat and
[1:46:45] spoke with e bisco had had conversations
[1:46:48] with some of the great men that stood
[1:46:49] there in that Ministry watch that thing
[1:46:51] happen and transpire
[1:46:54] I wasn't there to watch the first pole
[1:46:57] in
[1:46:58] action I wasn't there to watch the
[1:47:00] second pole in
[1:47:02] action and I wasn't even there to watch
[1:47:05] sister ma when that tumor was laying on
[1:47:07] her I wasn't there physically I wasn't
[1:47:10] there to watch that tumor go off I
[1:47:11] wasn't there when had wres boys when
[1:47:14] when they were sitting there snickering
[1:47:15] and making fun of the Holy Ghost and he
[1:47:17] said give her what she asked for I say
[1:47:20] this to you parents the pillar of fire
[1:47:21] is in this building right now
[1:47:24] now give them what they ask
[1:47:28] for I wasn't there I wasn't there to see
[1:47:32] no squirrels manifested I wasn't there
[1:47:34] to watch that storm be spoken out of
[1:47:36] existence I wasn't there to watch those
[1:47:38] things but I am here in the hour of the
[1:47:41] third pole when the son of man which is
[1:47:44] the opening of the word is standing
[1:47:46] right before us and he is manifesting
[1:47:48] himself aresh again today today and
[1:47:51] today and tomorrow and the next day
[1:47:54] until we get raptured out of this and go
[1:47:56] into our home up in the
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:08] sky the Bible said it's it's coming
[1:48:11] there's one coming there's one coming
[1:48:14] there's one
[1:48:15] coming and Moses stood over there in the
[1:48:17] book of Deuteronomy 18-5 and he said he
[1:48:20] said the Lord Our God shall raise up a
[1:48:22] prophet like unto myself right out of
[1:48:24] the midst of you and when Philip found
[1:48:27] Nathaniel he went over there and said we
[1:48:29] have found him who all the prophets were
[1:48:31] talking about here there was prophecy
[1:48:34] hanging and now it was fulfilled that
[1:48:37] here was the very word himself that was
[1:48:39] laying there it was laying there through
[1:48:42] all of those prophets Ministries but now
[1:48:44] it was a time of fulfillment they said a
[1:48:47] star would rise out of Jacob they said
[1:48:49] he'd be born in Bethlehem he said he'd
[1:48:51] be despised and he be rejected of man he
[1:48:54] said the government would be upon his
[1:48:56] shoulders it was said that there'd be a
[1:48:58] forerunner that would forerun his
[1:49:00] ministry and when John the Baptist is
[1:49:03] standing over there in Matthew chapter 3
[1:49:05] I believe verse 11 and he said there
[1:49:08] stands one amongst you when they ask him
[1:49:10] are you he he said but there stands one
[1:49:13] amongst you that is mightier than myself
[1:49:16] I will baptize you with water but he
[1:49:18] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:49:21] the fire what was John doing he was
[1:49:24] pointing you to that which was once
[1:49:28] prophecy to that which is now
[1:49:30] fulfilled and they could say this day
[1:49:34] this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:49:39] ears it seemed very very concerning how
[1:49:43] in the world how in the world could a
[1:49:46] virgin
[1:49:50] conceive how in the world
[1:49:53] Isaiah's lost
[1:49:57] it we thought he was the prophet of the
[1:49:59] day but he's lost it seemed to get off
[1:50:02] there at the
[1:50:06] end seemed like he was he was just
[1:50:09] trying to get a people just joined to
[1:50:11] himself a little
[1:50:15] bit there's a lot of people and I'd say
[1:50:17] even Isaiah didn't understand everything
[1:50:19] that he was
[1:50:20] speaking it's Inc conceivable how in the
[1:50:23] world of Virgin can
[1:50:25] conceive but it ain't up for the
[1:50:30] [Applause]
[1:50:31] prophet it might be inconceivable how in
[1:50:34] the world these young people are going
[1:50:36] to fit in a
[1:50:38] dress you may not understand it but I
[1:50:41] ain't the one dressing them he
[1:50:44] is you don't know their past like I know
[1:50:47] it you don't know what they've been
[1:50:49] through like I know it I'm not the one
[1:50:51] dressing them
[1:50:55] parents and you can go ahead and let let
[1:50:57] loose just here you're not the one
[1:50:59] that's going to dress him either he
[1:51:02] is so why don't you just give them to
[1:51:05] God right
[1:51:07] now you're not the one that's got to
[1:51:09] make them fit in the prophecy if he saw
[1:51:11] him in the vision they're going to be in
[1:51:13] the vision they're going to walk and
[1:51:16] step they won't get out of line and if
[1:51:19] they do get out of line there's a
[1:51:21] prophet that said get back back in
[1:51:27] line it ain't my job to figure out which
[1:51:30] Mary it was it's the Angel's job there
[1:51:34] was a lot of Marys that was living out
[1:51:36] there in Jerusalem in and in Nazareth
[1:51:38] and all those cities there was a lot of
[1:51:40] Marys down there there's a lot of
[1:51:42] churches out there there's a lot of
[1:51:44] denominations out there but the germ of
[1:51:47] life could not come by the
[1:51:49] angel it had to come through the
[1:51:52] Ministry of the son of man it's not my
[1:51:55] job to figure out which Mary it
[1:51:58] is the Angel knows which one to go to
[1:52:02] the angel knows which one's going to do
[1:52:04] it the angel knows who's going to
[1:52:05] overcome the angel knows who's going to
[1:52:07] receive this the angel knows who's going
[1:52:10] to make it the Angels knows going who's
[1:52:12] who's going to be healed the angel
[1:52:16] knows it wasn't even up for William
[1:52:19] Brandon to figure out who who that bride
[1:52:21] was it wasn't up for him to figure out
[1:52:23] how in the world she could put it on but
[1:52:25] all I know is I can look out at that
[1:52:28] dress brother brandom said that the
[1:52:30] bride has the material to dress herself
[1:52:33] in all I know is that the dress
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:39] fits I'm in the prophet's
[1:52:46] Vision last day for who

[1:52:59] closing of times last days for

[2:03:06] DNA markers that are laying there and

[2:03:09] live with this because it's laying there

[2:03:13] pressure and sugar diabetes because it's
[2:03:15] laying there they say you're going to
[2:03:16] have cancer because there's a certain
[2:03:18] Gene that's laying there that you're
[2:03:20] going to have to get and all we know how
[2:03:22] to do is to go ahead and set the course
[2:03:24] for you but I want you to know that the
[2:03:26] abstract to the title deed it clears
[2:03:29] everything that was against you it is
[2:03:32] now struck
[2:03:34] off everything your mama may have been a
[2:03:37] prostitute but you struck off your daddy
[2:03:39] may have been a dope dealer but it
[2:03:41] struck
[2:03:44] off there a whole lot of Bootleggers in
[2:03:46] my family but ain't no Bootleggers left
[2:03:49] in my family no more in my family
[2:03:52] there's giant killers in my family
[2:03:54] there's
[2:03:55] people there's people that know how to
[2:03:57] pull the sword of the spirit in my
[2:04:00] family history there is a hero and his
[2:04:03] name is Jesus struck off omitted not
[2:04:07] against me no more you're Justified as
[2:04:10] if you never done it in the first
[2:04:12] [Applause]
[2:04:18] place that's right that's right every
[2:04:21] thing that was against
[2:04:24] you now let me let me let me give you
[2:04:27] this little piece this a little nugget
[2:04:29] and I I'm going to do my best cuz I I
[2:04:32] feel the Lord doing something but let me
[2:04:36] give this to you that when you hold an
[2:04:38] abstract title deed everything is
[2:04:41] cleared and I mean
[2:04:43] everything say that with me
[2:04:46] everything now you know what you're
[2:04:48] going to get ready to do you're going to
[2:04:50] come through a prayer line
[2:04:52] here just in a few minutes you're going
[2:04:54] to walk through his prayer line and I
[2:04:55] want you to hold this over you there's a
[2:04:58] promise holding hanging over top of you
[2:05:01] everything has been struck off of you
[2:05:04] everything say it with me
[2:05:07] everything now now when when you're
[2:05:10] holding that Abstract title deed not
[2:05:12] only is it just the land that is
[2:05:16] cleared you see if somebody has gone in
[2:05:18] there and placed a lean on it you can
[2:05:21] say that I have the title you can say
[2:05:23] that it's rightfully mine but if there's
[2:05:26] no abstract there there still could be a
[2:05:28] lean that was placed on it years and
[2:05:32] years ago now in these great big cities
[2:05:34] like New York and out in Seattle and
[2:05:36] Chicago and all these places there are
[2:05:39] people that actually buy the atmosphere
[2:05:42] above and they go in there because
[2:05:45] people know that there's going to be
[2:05:46] somebody that comes in there that's
[2:05:48] going to want to build a skyscraper
[2:05:50] someday so they're putting putting a
[2:05:51] lean on the atmosphere and they're
[2:05:54] saying they're saying that this has got
[2:05:56] to be paid before there can ever be a
[2:05:59] skyscraper placed in there so let me say
[2:06:02] this to you under the anointing of the
[2:06:05] lord your atmosphere is cleared and you
[2:06:08] can rejoice in the Lord everything below
[2:06:11] you is cleared everything above you is

[2:10:14] prison Minister for about I believe he

[2:10:57] that you are the prophet's prophecy now
[2:11:04] fulfilled now tonight I want you to be
[2:11:06] very
[2:11:07] aware that in this building is the
[2:11:11] anointing of the Holy
[2:11:13] Ghost and there across this platform and

[2:11:18] God that are anointed ordained to lay
[2:11:20] their hands on
[2:11:22] you and when you come through this

[2:11:26] their way when you come through this
[2:11:29] prayer line we will lay L hands on you
[2:11:32] and the Bible said to lay hands on the
[2:11:34] sick and they shall
[2:11:37] recover sick in mind sick in body sick

[2:13:55] glory
[2:13:56] back and what you're watching is the
