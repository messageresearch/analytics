Miracles too late amen I am a miracle myself amen and the power of God and amen I I love how the prophet says that devil got there too late you know he said of course the devil got to Eve before Adam right but in the end time Christ got to the bride before the devil got through him and he said you're already pregnated with a seed he said that way you couldn't commit adultery this bride Can't Fail

he's been a great friend through the through the years made me feel old telling me that he was here you know back there preaching I was preaching and he was 5 years old or six he's an old man I don't know about me I tell you what we have been so so blessed we have been so blessed with wonderful friends and great times through the years and be here with our brother Ry Ericson and and uh you know he

service to the people of God it just makes my heart glad to to be a part with you tonight a part of that and you know as as uh as we know God sent a blessing to and brother Wayne to you and and if I had a little small part in helping that along I'm glad I did amen it was um a real you know when you see the fruits sometimes of your labors and and things that God has done and how God has used them and and how God continues to use and you know we we got to finish this thing come on you we we've got to race we got to finish and we we I sometimes I feel though like John Paul Jones I just begun to fight I just now got in the fight come on but you know L we must press on and put all that we have into it and so I certainly love brother Wayne sister Carissa you know as we get older God sends helpers along the way just like my son Timothy that is here with us tonight he he come to help carry the load and looking after old Dad here you know um I I tell you what sometimes um we we need uh extra help along the way and God sends it and we appreciate that brother Ron it's so great to have you with us tonight and and uh if you've never seen a miracle there's a miracle right there amen God bless you amen him and sister Connie coming and being a part of this meeting it means a whole lot for them to be here and you know I saw uh brother Zimmerman as he come in the door and said you know um I remember some of the great meetings of the of the past and you know down in Faro and and and uh got videos of it and things like that you know that well you know those were special moments and time and and um you know we've been down the the road many many many miles now and uh but one day we're coming to The Last Mile we'll finish this we didn't start we didn't come in this to be quitters right we come in this to win amen and um you know I I think of great men that have been through and I couldn't name them all but you know my my heart just kind of turned over as I thought about brother John Leon maybe some of his families here tonight and um you know we we think about the many that have gone on before us that have paved the way for many of you I I um I think sometimes you know the things we struggled through in the infancy of the message and understanding and getting a grip of what was done and um you know of what God had s in this day and and then we see young men rise up and they're preaching things that it took me 20 years to get to you know that because the road got paved and we speed right down that road you know and but it was a lot of trailblazing and uh but we are so thankful for men of God who have stood down through the time and stood the test of time and and we want to press on to the mark for the price of the High Calling amen God bless you it's so good to be with you and I pray that the Lord's blessings will be upon you mightily in this weekend brother Ron will speak tomorrow night and I know it's going to be a dynamic service you know I'm I'm just a um from Louisiana we kind of got back backwards ways and I I REM REM sister Lucille you know was um there at a camp meeting many years ago and I think it was must have been ' 88 or ' 89 something like that and and um Lord the Lord used her in a way I I don't think she even knows about it but um I had never been overseas in my life and in know country boy I always say if you leave me alone I just stay on my front porch you know and um so I I got up as far as Michigan that was a long ways for a boy from Louisiana and uh I got up there and there was I preached in that meeting and a brother Neil Murray from down in New Zealand came to me and and said oh oh he grabbed me and tears coming down his face got to have your ministry in New Zealand man I don't know where New Zealand is I barely made it to Michigan but I don't have any clue where New Zealand is and I ain't going there well I said no sir I'm not coming to New Zealand so you know oh we had some more services and the Lord moved and he'd come around and oh we got to have you come to New Zealand I'm praying God we'll bring you to New Zealand and I said no I am not going to New Zealand we had a big prayer Altar and the altar was full and we was praying around with people and and brother Neil comes over and shakes me up we got to have you in New Zealand I said no sir I'm not coming to New Zealand I know that cuz I don't even know where it is I've never been out of the country I don't even you know have a passport I ain't going no so um so anyway I get over there and conviction hits me and I say but you promised the Lord that he'd open the door you'd walk into it I said oh yeah I did make that promise I said I tell you what Lord and about that time sister Lucille started playing the piano and singing All God's Children want to sit around the table no one wants to work in my field I said Okay God if he comes to me one more time and says invites me to New Zealand I'll come to New Zealand so he walks back right straight to me and said brother I said okay I'll come to New Zealand he grabbed me up into his arms like this and he danced with me with my feet dangling and about that far off the floor and he was going around and around and around and around and I said oh God just let him put me down easy well after that I've been around the world many times times and you know with brother Hilder brand over in Africa four or five times and in many places in Europe and and New Zealand several times and different places around the world and and now I'm praying you know that God has s somebody else amen so we're looking to the lord it's so good to be with you and nice to be able to talk with you for a moment and God bless you if you'll stand with me as we read the word we'll turn to Ezekiel 37 and verse1 I've got a reputation for being long- winded come on buddy and you will know when it's true that I am keep my reputation but the Lord help us to fill our mouth with good things and and then stop us when we set enough let us follow the nudge of the spirit tonight Ezekiel 37:1 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I will a in you upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and a Behold a shaking and the bones came together boned his bones and when I beheld low the SS and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man say the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great Army let's just talk to the Lord once more father thank you for these moments and time and the word that you have left for our learning I pray Lord that you'll bless us tonight in your presence and anoint us now as we speak in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated I'm going to speak to you tonight all you dry bones hear the word of the Lord you know there are many descriptive words in the Bible that describe the last age and its move of God and what we see in this passage of Ezekiel is the word of the Lord bringing a restoration and it looks hopeless in fact when the prophet is asked can these live he had to divert to God and say Lord thou knowest it looks so impossible but the word of the Lord restores and God is doing much more than just restoring Doctrine in this day although he's that certainly is a very integral and important part of what God is doing but God is also restoring homes he is restoring healing he's restoring the AR original outpouring of the Holy Ghost he's restoring a book of Acts amen he's restoring marriages amen well you say well my problem is my job well he's a god of restoration well my problem is my health well God is a restorer of Health it makes no difference how aged you are how sick you are how what the problem is amen God is restoring yes amen we remember with Abraham he waited until he was 90 years old actually 100 years old when he restored him as a very old man and healed Sarah when she was past 90 God has no limits on him as he said to Sarah of old is there anything too hard for the Lord God's Prophet would rush to the bedside of a 90-year-old Bill da and see God come on the scene and heal him so that he would live uh for for years after that see there is no limit on God right and no matter how far you have strayed or how far you have gone into sin or what wickedness you have committed this God is a restorer no matter how bad off your family is or how they have strayed away from God Amen they they may be a house full of infidels and unbelievers but this God is a God that can reach further down than what you can look up amen he can bring a restoration when there's only bones left because he's a God that said I will restore sayth the Lord hallelujah hallelujah we look at Israel and that land was dry in a desolate place that had long went back to briers and thistles and its inhabitants had been dispersed around the world but his his word is said I will restore and God looked upon this valley of dry bones and said these Tri bones hear the word of the Lord and they become a Great and Mighty Army and God's word is brought a restoration today where the nation of Israel is a mighty nation a a thriving Nation a mighty army with great expectations of many who are looking for the Messiah to come amen when you look at them on this and you see the natural fulfillment you know if they are being restored so is her spiritual counterpart the bride of Christ is reaching fulfillment amen and and we're even ahead of them we're Advanced Beyond them amen because we got to get away before they can receive their Messiah we've actually Advanced Way Beyond Where is is today in our restoration because we have seen the Messiah amen we have come back to the original tement and healing is in our midst and salvation is in our midst the Holy Ghost is in our midst and every part of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost is with us in this hour it is ours what a privilege we are in this day to have heard been heard the word of the Lord I'm looking upon people dry bones that hurt it amen dry bones that lived I'm looking on some that are still Dry Bones come on Amen but the word of the Lord is still going forth to bring to life those who have only been Justified or Sanctified or and gathered with us a new and the flesh has come upon them but but oh today there is a word of the Holy Ghost that is coming from Glory tonight that can make dry bones live and to breathe I say oh breathe oh Breath of God breathe upon this church breathe upon this people amen breathe upon these Tri bones this word will go out at the distant lines it'll reach out in the brothel in The Prostitute dens down to drunkards to those who are addicted no matter where they are this can find them amen he will find every predestinated seed he won't leave one of his behind hallelujah amen I I remember just recently I stood a couple of years ago stood at a a gravite and I was preaching a a funeral there a graveside service and a word struck a heart of a man that had not had a sober day since he was about 11 years old and I he came to church and God delivered him he hadn't had a drink since and that's been three or four years ago amen the word will know how to find you even if it's among the tombs even if it's at a gravide service God will get his elect because the word Goes Forth to get the dry bones and bring them in praise God Amen another of these descriptive words promise and restoration is the latter rain the latter rain brings a harvest to all the seeds since Genesis it is here that the seeds were sown by both sers will come to maturity the tear and the wheat will come to maturity in this age because of the outpouring of the latter rain he tells us in Hosea 6:1 what he will do in Israel as a natural nation and upon the bride as a spiritual Nation he says Hosea 6 and come and let us return unto the Lord for he had Thorn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he'll raise us up and we shall live in his sight so from hosea's time appr prophecy uh that Israel is well into the third day right Amen in other words it's been 2500 years or more since Hosea spoke these words thousand year being a day and the third day we have Compass 2,000 years now and and and they are here they have compassed more than 2,000 years they're they're right here where Hosea prophesied after two days will he revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on if we with Zeal go on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come to us as the rain as the latter and former rain upon the Earth hallelujah look how he will come he will come as the former and the latter reign Hallelujah brother bradam tells us and spoken words Original Seed now what's the matter she's now waiting for the latter rain now he's right on the cusp of the opening of The Mystery of the Seven Seals and and it would be there that the bride's Revival would start remember the bride's Revival don't start with evening light Tabernacle or true word Tabernacle or with brother Ron Spencer anden the bride's Revival started because God opened up the the Seven Seals reveal the mysteries of God to us in this day amen that's when she produces her fruits oh H said I hope you get her then the kind of seed you planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will we reap if the denominations want more members they're going to get it that's what they've gotten the Pentecostals want more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get right but the work is going to produce

Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence or use Force the violent the strong take it by force now there are things that you've got to do right you see there's a part you must play right God wants us to participate with him in this work yes amen he said to that those little women Mary and Martha roll away the stone right he could have spoke the word and could have broke that stone into a million slivers right but he didn't that's right amen he called for weak Little Women to step up and roll away the stone and when they did their part god did his you see you've got a part to do also you you must stand there and speak the word word amen the the translators speak about this that it's one of the most difficult passages of the scripture to translate because the words used in the Greek it's it was difficult so they actually translated it back to Hebrew and and then then back into English to get a meaning from this because it was so difficult to translate and here's a translation they came up with from the moment John stepped onto the scene until now the realm of Heaven's kingdom is bursting forth and passionate people have taken hold of his power hallelujah hallelujah and I say from the days of our Forerunner amen from the days of our John the Baptist from this Elijah he used force and even now we must use Force we must take back what the devil stole from us hallelujah it's the time of our inheritance but you got to step out and claim it on now Hallelujah the realm of Heaven's Kingdom bursted open under that Ministry and those that were passionate have taken hold of his

flesh and blood Affair it's a spiritual battle right I'll tell you what little do do you realize sometimes sometimes we forget we need to remember and recall the things that God has done in our age right blind eyes and deaf ears came open by force right and not just a few I stood the other day and I and drove by actually the the the the school for the de in Little Rock Arkansas and you can hear Brother Billy Paul's testimony of2 deaf and dumb mutes in the in the Little Rock Arkansas who were healed when brother brandom visited that place not just one 152 of them you know what was it God was

that was about with the lamb taking the book he didn't do it as God he did it as a man so let me tell you the book is back in the hands of a man again the book that Adam lost went in the hand of God is now back in the hands of a man again and he didn't keep it from for himself but here he said I saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven with an open book and a commandment given for you to go take it eat it and [Applause] prophesy I tell you what passionate people have taken hold of his power we are armed and dangerous come on Amen the sword of the king back in the hands of man again that day

that was brother Brandon's sword no that was the king's sword that's right right amen and even as Moses went and got the Ten Commandments right that was Israel getting the Ten Commandments that's right amen and as brother bradam received the king's sword that was the bride receiving the king's sword so the power of the word is back in your mouth Hallelujah for the way you handle the sword is by the mouth how did those bones live they live by the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of a man you take the word and prophesy I can prophesy and I can speak but you say it you know your mountains got to hear your voice yes sir if you say to this mountain Jesus didn't say if I say it he said if you say it that's the way B dead bones live brother Brandon spoke this in a sermon we used to call it warning in judgment but he said Lord Jesus we are a people who are trying our best with all that's in us to walk in the light of the Gospel of your great gospel that you died to make right and we're so thankful to see in this Evil dark days that we're living now that we see the signs appearing oh God there's a handwriting on the wall we thank thee Lord that we can see it and know that Deliverance is close at hand oh if we just see the deliverances that are happening then we should know that deliverances are near for your loved ones that ought to give you some Faith here tonight

that passes but what great his Supernatural signs is striking the Earth and we see it knowing that that great Army of God marches on oh not many in number but what a powerful group that's got eternal life they would would said they'd run through the troop and leap over a wall yes the troop of death will have no holders to it she'll run right through it and leap over the wall between the natural and Supernatural and go into the arms of God that great eternity that's me come on yes sir mama that's me yes I'm going to run through the troop of death and leap over the wall come on Amen the devil may have given you a death notice and say I'm taking you to death amen but I would if I were you I wouldn't take that that's right I've run through that troop of death and I'd leap over the wall right into the promises of God Amen it's coming in on waves of glory amen it's the outpouring of the Holy Ghost yes sir he you ever see rain coming I don't know how it rains here but I'll tell you in Louisiana we get Gully washers toad stranglers yeah they can come down a few a foot or two in a few in just a little bit I mean wave after wave sheet after sheet of rain I tell you that's the way Heaven's realm his kingdom is breaking forth in this age an angel broke through the clouds of unbelief and from Heaven's Dimension came an angel to sending out of a pillar of fire you know that's the truth the sick were healed the blind eyes were open they were able to Proclaim Bible days are here again and I just want to say don't put a period to that Bible days are still here today Hallelujah there's a Bible word of Bible Pride Bible works and Bible action and Bible holiness come on hallelujah amen listen seven angels have come breaking through the portals Between Heaven and Earth as a lamb tore off the seals and handed it down the Revelation down to the seventh angel on Earth and it made the Bible not another book but a new book that's right because it's no longer closed but open we're no longer preaching from a closed book we're preaching from an open book [Music] I'm here still proclaiming the Bible days are here again right we have returned to Paul's gospel with the same word the same power when that happened with brother Bram that caused waves of Glory that's right many got swept up by it and moved by the power of God and it didn't just affect brother brandom it affected other ministers as well right there many other that that that rode on that wave of Divine Healing right took that part of the message you know that is part of the message come on Amen you said well that was a first pull well I mean okay I get that but I figure we got all of it amen I believe in the first pull second pull third pull yeah amen I I believe in every phase of God I believe it's right here operates you know one reason I can believe all that I mean I sat in brother Brandon's meeting as a boy and watch this the second pull work worked right up to the time he died amen so the word of God laying hands on the sick still works today amen every promise of God come on brother Jim we we shouldn't lay on the hands and we just should speak the word well I wish should do it come on there's a lot of needes out there that's right go ahead I me I'm not standing in your way do it amen I'm just saying you know you got it work it and we got it and it does work I can give you example after example of where it's worked still works today amen this wave of God though is not just about a prophet although that's very much involved right a very important part of it right an angel of God came to the prophet and then an angel of God came to you as well that's right that's right amen that's right you've been visited by the seventh angel right right God's messenger in this last day so there's been wave after wave after wave as the Holy Spirit began to be poured out and it got poured out on you know other ministers caught that inspiration and and rode on that wave of Divine Healing they saw that part of the word that had been laying dormant and they said that days of Miracles are passed and it worked for them they saw it work it gave them Faith to believe it would work in their lives too they saw it in the Bible is true so there was wave after wave that be of the spirit of God began to be poured out and poured out upon men such as Jack Co and or Roberts and others who would ride on that wave of that outpouring and and and what I'm trying to tell you today is you got to be passionate too you must ride on the wave of that outpouring because you said in the last day I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and my daughters shall prophesy they they're going to speak my word amen so what I'm telling you is you got to be passionate too passionate men took a hold of it Jack Cole for example he was a simly god preacher he uh he attended some of brother Brandon's meetings and and he had doubt in his heart he didn't believe what he was seeing was real just absolutely didn't he supposed to be Pentecostal preacher and believeing in the the miraculous but you know he just he just thought it was just hyping hysteria you know was nothing to it so you know he he actually testifies where he went and and watched you know um went to Brother Brandon's meeting and he went there as a skeptic that's right brother brandham calls him one of my converts to Divine Healing I wish a bunch of preachers in this message would get converted come on and anyway you know brother brother brandham um he watched brother brandham as he prayed for the needs and there was a man that came up and he had no eyeballs and brother bam told him that this man with no eyeballs said you will see in three days said in three days there will it'll take three days for eyeballs to form in your eyes and on the third day you will be seeing Well Jack thought anybody can say that you know the blind man will leave and go home and no one will know if he's ever received his healing you know he'd just be one of the thousands in the crowd and so his brother Bram leaves the platform Jack sitting on the platform and near the the exit there brother Bram stops puts his hand on his on his knee for a minute just kind of pray quietly and he says um what are you so skeptical about you're a preacher too he said actually you're sick too but your sickness because you run down from so many Revival meetings but don't be skeptical about this God has a work for you to do also and of course he was thrilled to hear those words but he want to wait until those three days was up and find that blind man and before he was really convinced so you know on the third day he was back there for the meeting he looked at that man and and he found he's walking around and sure enough he had eyeballs formed in his in his head but he still couldn't see but later that evening as the evening time approached he could see as good as anybody and and you know that brother brother Jack would say of brother brandham that that William brandham was called for dispensational purposes and that so inspired him that he got under that anointing and began to believe God and he rode on that wave of Divine Healing right you know those men knew how to tap into Heaven's outpouring they knew that you you know that you could sit right under the flow of the spirit and right in the spout where the glory was coming out and miss it right because of unbelief and unconfessed sins right come on now come on you remember brother bam tells us that and how I can overcome he said I crossed an Old Log and it was laying there right in the Water of Life and he said it was Doty and I I stepped on and a big chunk fell off right and he said I looked at it and said look at there it's laying right there in the fountain and it rottens twice as quick he said keep life within you amen so Jack had to be stirred from his unbelief to start believing and once he started believing the power started work for him and Heathen Miracles began to take place now he didn't you know he died in 56 but he didn't go of course the opening of the word had not come and and we don't know what he would have done you know whatever maybe he was just predestined for that moment I don't know but nevertheless you know he rode on that word that he had received right and that's what's important with you we have received a great word in this day right on all of it amen yes sir amen so they knew they knew that there would be things that would keep you from riding on that wave into Victory come on now so well brother Tim I don't have any unconfessed sins I'm not a sinner well maybe you didn't go out and rob a bank maybe murder somebody but every one of us deal with a measure of unbelief I hear brother Brandon even praying many times Lord forgive me of my sins amen that's right in fact Brother Ray he he prayed that just before we came out Lord forgive us of our shortcomings and brother bandam was shown The Binding of the serpent there a hideous mamba likee snake that was after God's people and he was told to have power to bind it you must be more sincere now if I'd have been standing there i' said well who could be more sincere than William Brandon right but God looked at him and said in order to do this it's going to take a greater depth of sincerity you see the gospel must become less mechanical and more sincere or heartfelt amen you you've got to become passionate about what you have and when you come to the house of God get rid of your [Applause] unbelief amen you know these men knew you could not ride on this wave of unbelief and unconfessed sin and in your life life you had to get rid of it you know you can just let envy and Malice and strife come in your heart and that thing will rob you from the thing that God has for you amen it'll take the blessings of God right out of your life some people get some men get a such a spirit Sometimes women a spirit of possessiveness that possesses your your wife and kids and holds them under bondage or some spirit of jealousy or envy and that evil spirit will kill keep you from the glory of God as it comes into the church right may maybe those things aren't outward but inward hidden things yes sir there are things we wrestle with because of our flesh right and when you come into the presence of God you always want to examine yourself right remember brother bam told us in in the in the in the in the message he told us our problem is that we're too strong preach perfect strength by Perfect weakness when we realize we're weak when we need God well I'm the bride of Christ you need Jesus yes sir amen amen if anybody needs the comfort of the bridegroom we do if anybody needs to be pulled up and whispered to love secrets we do we need him yes sir yes sir that's right you know you you look at and you say have I lost my first love maybe that's the sin when you lose your first love you lose your passion I don't mean to apply that you're sick now because of some secret sin but it's like the woman with the Lost coin you turn over everything in your life you throw out anything that would hinder your faith find that little bit of insincerity good brother so you can bind that serpent good I mean here's brother Ron he fight a satanic attack God's using him like never before encouraging us on taking away our excuses but I look forward to the day of total Deliverance amen wining this battle and restoration amen it may be in this meeting that those bones live that that Faith Rises up and grasps the promise amen that the battle is over and the Victory is one we have a responsibility as a church to produce that kind of atmosphere with those kind of things happen that's right but they realize you know you can let envy and Malice and strife come to your heart and that thing will rob you from the thing that God has for you take the blessings of God right out of your life how many times times and and Jack would say this and I'm just going to tell a story of his for a moment we'll move on but I but how many times have he said have I heard this in a in a healing line people say I don't understand it if sister so and so didn't get healed and nobody get healed cuz she's a saint of God he says how do you know she is man looks on the outward appearance but God looks on the heart you don't know what sister so and so is God in a heart quit judging your El by yourself judge yourself by him the perfect one you've heard it hundreds of times their sister so and so and she's an invalid if she doesn't get healed then nobody get healed so I can't go by sister so and so there's only one thing I know to go by and that's this book and he promised to heal all my diseases and take away all my iniquities so you don't even know your own wife's heart because you look at her faults all her her shortcomings and you don't know your husband's heart you don't know the thoughts that run to his mind or what so right what right you have to get up and say if God doesn't heal him then nobody get healed then he tells about how he was in a meeting in Netherland Texas one time and he was on his way home from church and the Pastor said to him you know you prayed for a woman tonight and I just don't understand that said she's a worst drunker in this whole city of of Netherlands she come up walking on crutches and everybody knows she she's been a habitual drunkard and she sat down the altar gave her heart to God you prayed for her after that and she dropped those crutches and went all over the building praising God aren't you glad for the blood of Christ one moment that's right one [Applause] [Music] moment stop this for a minute I was just a boy and brother those meetings on the wings of a snow white dub and those meetings there it was a little sister that now is in our church sister jeie Camp she was in brother bram's meetings had been invited there by an uncle who had learned that God had sent a prophet in this age and and they had open prayer line and and they got a prayer card and she went in she was 16 years old or so was a um you know was a cheerleader in high school and and she had picked up the habit of smoking she's a Methodist girl she knew nothing about you know the Divine Healing or any of that and the power of God but she just went and got a prayer card and went through the line and about three people in front of her brother brandham stopped her this woman and said listen you're Desiring a great thing you're Desiring a baby said but you got a habit there that you're going to have to surrender and that's smoking cigarettes if you will if you'll say to God I'll not smoke them no more I'll give them over to you you'll have that baby well Genie's three people back and all she's thinking oh God I didn't know how bad cigarettes was I didn't know how wrong I would but my mama don't know I'm smoking cigarettes please whatever you do don't tell let that man tell my mama what I'm doing forgive me right now God please forgive me I I Repent right now and she goes right through the line brother bandam right and felt that presence of the angel of God and nothing was ever said about her cigarettes because not even a prophet can pull something out of your life that has been repented of Hallelujah there's a quick fix to your problem a quick fix for your problem repent be sincere that's right so anyway he said I jack was having this conversation with this Pastor said you prayed for that woman she dropped her CES and went all over the building praising God now why would God heal someone like that when this sister in my church got a Waterhead baby and she's a Deacon's wife and they pay their tith they come to church and there's not a more Godly couple in the world than them why is it God wouldn't heal that that baby said I I don't know her life he said but I do he said no you don't well said he's the only she's the only woman and he's the the only man I can put uttermost confidence in my church and look what they have to go through you know carrying that Waterhead baby and 8 years old and can't walk a big great big head little bitty body and the child cries all hours of the night now that mother has to be up with it now tell me why God don't heal that baby and said well I don't know her heart you don't either yes I do he said and so he said we said nothing about it more about it but the next morning when the spirit of God was moving the sister stood on her feet with tears rolling down her cheeks and said I've missed God I have murmured and complained because God God gave me a Waterhead baby on you know a lot of times people in M murmur and complain against God because of the grab bag of Life come on now you know maybe you've lost your wife or your husband or you've been through a divorce or somebody did something wrong to you or or the church failed you the pastor didn't come to see you when you thought he should have and you've developed a bitterness in your heart heart you have to deal with it whatever my whatever it is if you want the blessings of God you got to deal with sin sins kept you from the house of God from The Fellowship of Believers from the presence of the almighty God and the blessings that should flow over your life there I tell you what you want it where there's nothing between you and your savior I I know what bitterness would do I watched a woman who got bitterness in her heart consider never she's Barren never could have a child and she held it in her heart against God until it began to grow and drove her insane she took her life bitterness is an awful thing yes sir you've got to deal with sin right no matter what form it's in if it's something as small as as losing your first love and that passion to please God if you want to ride on the wave of God's glory if you want the benefits of his healing power if you want to see God move for your family you want to see God's blessings on your life you got to deal with sin no matter where it comes from it might be from the gossip of somebody else who has bitterness in their own heart against the church or the pastors why you're reluctant you know and you don't attend church regularly you know your attitude toward Christ that's an attitude and it's toward Christ you think it's against the church the church represents Christ you got an attitude against the church you got an attitude against God and it's keeping you from the house of God or when you come you will sit back pulled back and reserved and don't enter in are you with me amen and you know because you let something happen maybe as I said some gossip to you and the it's a reason that you have no idence in the ministry but it's sin you know no matter how powerful a man of God is he cannot help you unless you have confidence in him right that's right and Satan will do everything to destroy your confidence in the work of God in the ministry in the pastor right amen oh it may be just bitterness against a parent maybe a broken home maybe you were sexually abused but it's hindered you and bound you from moving on with God and receiving the holy ghost or or being the Christian that you know you ought to be then that bitterness has a root that will defile many I just want to tell you tonight if you're in that condition if you're if you're suffering from those things stop that stop it quit identifying yourself as a victim you are not a victim you are a Victor we all have things to overcome you have things in your life I've had things in my life but you cannot let that stop you from the go come on oh yeah be passionate about I'm winning this race I throw aside every weight and every sin that would so easily beset me I'm win in this race tell you right now if I you want to ride on this wave of Glory that is being poured out I would start right now saying God Purge me cleanse me let the blood flow over me wash away all my unbelief my doubting my criticism and make me pure before you because it's only the pure in heart that will see God you want to see God how many wants to see him then the only way you're going to see him is be pure in heart then he'll reveal himself to you you want God in your life let the blood flow over you I'm talking about the Holy Ghost amen but anyway this Pastor said uh Jack this is I know this is more I I I don't know of a more saintly couple than this woman or husband with the Waterhead baby there he's a deacon and they pay their tithe and Faithfully they stood by me in difficult times but the next morning in the prayer meeting she stood on her feet and said I've missed God I have murmured and complained because God gave me a Waterhead baby now first of all I want you to get a point God doesn't send sickness that's right sickness is of the devil it is not of God God did not cause your children astray God did not cause you to be born in a dysfunctional family amen sin caused that dysfunctional family you can't blame God for the circumstances of your life you mean you got to realize this is a world of sin and unbelief and darkness and doubting and fear and unfortunately you were not born in in God's Eden this ain't the Millennium that's right last time I checked this is no Millennium that's right amen you were born in Satan's Eden and you've got to overcome it that's right and God has confidence right in every predestinated seat that no matter what circumstance or situation you have been brought up under you are going to rise above it it ain't you so much he has confidence he has confidence in his [Applause] seed the woman at the well was a seed of God and brother Bon said about it she probably wasn't a bad girl she probably just sold out by her father for monetary reason and started that kind of life but the devil cannot cannnot hide a predestinated seed from his God hallelujah hallelujah he came to seek and to save that which was lost I cannot lose something unless it was in my possession first Hallelujah come on that's right he came to seek and save that which was lost that's right me just stop and relax a minute and tell you a story about a little boy that went made himself a sailboat he worked day and night on the thing it was really a piece of art he went out every day then when he got it complete and sailed his boat one day a wind came up and blew that sailboat out of his reach way out and he watched it go out of sight well every day he went looking for his sailboat where is my sailboat it's got to be here somewhere I I I I lost it out here and it's got to show up so he every day would get out where's my sailboat I got to find it and Van he looked for it one day he was in town walked by a pawn shop and in the window was his sailboat Hallelujah he looked there at that sailboat and oh he was shocked it had a huge price on it it was more than any of the money that he had but he wanted that sailboat so he said I know what I'll do I'm going to go back home I'm going to sell all my toys my bicycle everything I'm you know all my games I'm going to sell everything and I'm going to get the money for that sailboat so he finally you know has a sale goes back to the bond shop with the money and he pays the price and as he walks out of the pawn shop he is seen hugging that little sailboat to his arms to his heart like that and as he does he says little sailboat you're mine you were mine when I made you and and now you're mine when I bought you you are twice [Music] mine you were God before the foundational world before you did anything wrong but he left all of Glory when you stayed away from him and he paid the price of redemption and he came down and purchased you you are his twice God's got the first claim on your life for the devil ever got to you God had you you were his first but God's here today seek and save that which was lost he's here to uncover the mud the darkness of your life where you can ride on that wave of Glory this woman said I blame God in my heart maybe you've asked why why did this happen to me why why how come said I blam God in my heart nobody ever knew this the pastor didn't know it my husband didn't know it I've been bitter against God I found fault with the pastor now it comes out said I want to oh brother I going to ask you to forgive me in my heart I criticized you because you did not pray the prayer of faith to me make my baby well I'm pretty sure that Pastor had prayed many a prayer of faith but because of this hidden root of bitterness in her life she couldn't receive the blessing right she was asking for you know faith comes by the person who is being prayed for it's according to your faith it isn't the man that healed you or even his faith that heals you it's your faith in Touching God through that man's prayer you got to believe Jesus said thy faith has made thee whole right he never said my faith did this for you he said your faith and he said this woman said as you know at home I've criticize everybody in my in the church in my heart not outly but in my heart down on the inside of me until this morning I've been one of the most bitter people that there ever was this morning I prayed through and I said if God never heals my baby and never lets it gets well I'm going to walk with God and right that night she brought her her baby to the prayer line I anointed he Jack said I anointed and prayed for it when she went out the door she couldn't tell I couldn't tell a bit of difference in the baby but I said sister God will heal and answer your prayer if you're clear before God and she said brother I if I carry this baby To My Grave I'm going to walk with God I have cut the bitterness out and it's going to stay out and I'm not blaming anyone I'm seeking God's face and just seeing how close I can get to him you know that's who heaven will open to am amen a people that are passionate about God they come with the attitude of whatever I have to do God I just want this one result let me be closer to you I'm just seeking God's face and see how close I can get to him oh I wonder if we could do that tonight amen will you forget about your need and forget about your request and forget about that job you need and that healing you need or your husband's healing or that Financial blessing and and your loved one that is lost you know to be saved and get one thing in your mind Lord I'm seeking your face I'm going to see how close I can get to you I want to be friend of God I want to be one

have tapped into Heaven's power in the Heaven's anointing are you with me he said oh his great glorious presence shall strike the Earth he cometh in clouds oh I love that clouds there will be wave after wave of his glory will come across the earth and the resurrection of the Saints shall come when that blessed Holy Spirit that's lived in their hearts and they've died with their corpses laying there and the tear stains on their cheeks and things like that they placed out in the graveyard a great wave of that same spirit and a a wave after wave I just say tonight oh breathe Breath of God Amen all the ages are hinging on us amen come on we are the last Runners of the race there's not another age to come there's not another message to get you ready amen you either got ready by this

going to end with the resurrection with the Rapture Dry Bones will live again amen the Saints of all the ages will arise wave after wave has been poured out of his Spirit prophecy after prophecy revelation after Revelation amen beginning with isusa Street and then again in Kansas and then in Louisiana God poured out his spirit and and people thought it was Pentecost they actually did they thought it was Pentecost and they called it so right but it wasn't amen the day of Pentecost would not come fully come till the full word was restored that's right amen isusa Street was not the complete ah it was however greater than Luther's justification right it was greater than Wesley's sanctification and because it was accompanied withurst of emotions and speaking in tongues people thought it was real but it went back in organization and proved it wasn't real but there is another people in the land who are the final wave of the spirit it is more than justification and forgiveness of sin it's more than just a Sanctified life where one puts off the sins of the past amen it's more than just an outburst of emotion and a gift of the spirit but it's the hour where the very Life of Christ from Heaven opened up the Seven Seals yeah and brought back down to us the full promise the full inheritance where you can look at and say every promise in the book is mine Hallelujah this message is the final [Applause] wave you know what you got to do to become clean before God you have to purify your hearts you have prepare for the blessings of God so you can be a recipient of the Divine Grace you got to have a bigger capacity for the word than a little jug that fills up in about 20 30 minutes and you're through and ready to go home come on now you got to get a bigger capacity when the word Goes Forth and then you got to water it with praises amen come on now you you can't just preach word and then not water [Applause] it people don't want us to worship anymore you cannot preach the word and not water it amen it must be watered with praise with worship but you know instead you get restless and want to go home because you can't wait for the spirit of God to move in the church well you're going to have to get a bigger capacity amen got to get some something where you got a you got a a longing to see lost souls come in amen you want to see people pray through you want to see people delivered you're the final you're the final way before the dead in Christ Riser there's a resurrection promised in the end time you know but as spiritual Resurrection proceeds the physical right so you see this bride will not be AO to see it she will by no means be lukewarm she will be on fire for God she'll be an overcoming church with a fire of zeal in her bosom that rises up and says that enemy today I will cut your head off it's your last day Satan it's your last time to torment me I'm riding on the wave of God's glory of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and ain't no devil going to rob me of what God has provided for me I will have healing I will have Deliverance my prodical are coming home my children will be blessed in the lamp come on Church we're going to have every promise of God Amen got to stand up and say this enemy is not going to torment my family one more day amen the Jubilee trumpet has sounded and it says I'm free well if we're free throw down your ho throw down your crutch throw down your unbelief throw down that Spirit of darkness and call Heaven down because heaven is open am [Applause] it's time for another wave where the Life of Christ will be on display the full word has come it has been restored and Paul's gospel is here by the opening of The Seven Seals he's re he's returned us back to the very gospel Paul preached that's right Pentecost could not preach that that's isusa Street failed brother Brandon would tell them in their 50th Jubilee where I think Pentecost failed and that was because they didn't go far enough with God they wouldn't go into the inner Court they stopped with speaking in tongues and didn't press on Amen let me tell you you got that you got to go on that's right right even in your walk just to revealing of the Mysteries let me tell you but Christ has got to be real to you that's right you might say I no predestination serpent seed and brother I can out debate the best yeah we got message boys that sat on the bar stools in a bar and can out argue theologians but do you really know Jesus that's right is there it is do you know the power of his resurrection do you know the quickening life of God that will quick in your mortal body and bring you subject to the word amen it's not knowing his Doctrine is life it's knowing him is life Pentecost sought the gifts and not the giver right right we've received the gifts of the word and too many only have it in the form of letter leaving the spirit behind now I don't know but I'm a farm boy enough to know it takes two wings to fly that's right yeah right spirit and truth right we got the truth where's the spirit we got the spirit where's the [Applause] truth you know we we had we had chickens when I grew up I don't have them anymore but even as as was a farmer for many years and keep a chicken in we just clipped One Wing we' go in at night catch them Birds them old hens that was flying over the chicken pen and we clip a wing now we didn't clip both of them cuz if that we clip both of them they can still fly but we clipped one and once you clipped that one they just went around in a circle they couldn't get off the ground and that's the way that it is you can have all Spirit come on all around this way are all word and you never get off the ground amen you don't want the devil to clip off the spirit you don't want him to clip off the truth we will not sacrifice truth just to have a [Applause] motion but neither will we sacrifice the truth and not have the spirit we will have both of them it takes two wings to fly amen hallelujah amen what will the full word do it brings a people to full age to maturity that's right we are adopted Sons that's who we are this is the age of adoption Hebrews 5:13 said everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe unskillful means he's inexperienced in the word prior ages drank the milk of the word in the age of justification it was the word but it was just milk amen there was still milk in the days of Wesley sanctification it was unskillful in the word of righteousness and isusa Street drank milk the milk of emotion and gifts and excited the the human spirit and its emotion but it was still milk but verse 14 of Hebrews 5 said but strong meet remember the the strong take it by force the listen belongeth to them who are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil right amen full age there's a people who have come to full age that's why this is a bright age we are here in it this the age of the elect Lady it's the marriage age it's the time of Union amen the time of marriage it's a Rapture age it's the climax age it's the grain age it's the Harvest age it's the eagle [Applause] age it's the grain age an age that goes in the Garner 2,000 years ago it was there was a crop harvested they were fully ripe seed God said no I'm not taking you in the Garner and put you taking you up in the Garner you're not going in a Rapture what I'm going to do is plant it and there it grew up from Luther and Wesley and and Pentecost and now we're in the fourth stage are you with me amen and here we are in the fourth stage where it's back to grain again but you see they were predestinated to be planted right for there to be seven ages to come right but we have not been predestinated to be planted we have been predestinated to a Rapture Hallelujah this is the Harvest age we're full age ah well brother Tim First Corinthians 13:10 said when that which is perfect has come the word perfect here is full age when the word comes in his fullness right we believe that we are in the time when the word comes then that which is in part shall be done away with you know then just having part is over is over Wesley had a part Luther had a part zuza had a part come on but we don't just have a part we have all of it come on amen so when that which when the perfect word comes then having part is done away because when you have the fullness you have it [Applause] all amen now honestly this scripture is really talking about our Perfection after our body change because that's when Perfection comes amen of of course we have used that scripture to do away with any emotion that's right we are mature now we're not babies so we don't need to shout anymore and worship God come on now every gift of the spirit is done away with come on oh is that so do you realize that Faith healing workings of Miracles wisdom word of knowledge knowledge are all a part of those nine spiritual [Applause] gifts amen well we don't need those because we're now a full age come on now because we're mature now and let jumping up and down and trying to speak with tongues is over and I say Amen jumping up and down like a kid and trying to speak with tongues to get the Holy Ghost that's over right right no more need to come down the altar beat somebody on the head up and down and J jiggle their chin and whatever confuse their language that's all over right get up and jump and shout and whatever else and go back and and live the dirty life that's all over come on now we don't do that on come on Amen all of that is over we're passed it that might have been the the the identification of the past movement that but that's not our identification the full word has come but guess what in that full word is every Divine promise not just one part all of [Applause] it sure a gift is not the evidence of a Spirit-filled life it's it's not what we're seeking after we're not trying to speak with tongues that's all over with the full word has come to manifestation and with the full word is all here when you get in that per perfect body all that which was in part will be done away with do you know what speaking in tongues will not be a phenomena in heaven you won't be talking English or Dutch or French or German you won't be talking any of that you we'll all speak a Heavenly language everybody will speak in tongues there it won't be a phenomena that's right it'll be the language of Heaven by the way there's quotes for that amen and if you ever get let me tell you even though even though let me just say the full word is here so it has every every promise in it and if you ever get born of the word you'll be a tongue speaking acts 238 screaming yelling younging because that's the only kind the word can bring forth Hallelujah the full word has come at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as he was here on the Earth manifested the same way doing the same thing so we're in the day when the full word has been made manifest and revealed and that's the wave we are riding on well AR our emphasis is not on speaking in tongues anymore that's right but we still have speaking in tongues because it's in the word amen amen we have prayer lines cuz it's in the word that's right amen amen we cast out Devils because it's in the word amen well we don't need things like that now brother Tim that's but that's not what Paul said he said I would that you all speak with Tong but rather that you prophesied right he he concludes a discourse on on the gifts and the use and he says wherefore brother covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues well our emphasis brother Tim is no longer on Divine Healing that's right and the Great Divine healing movement is over that's right and and but as long as we got needs in our body come on now we still need Divine Healing and guess what it's a part of the word you can't have it all and not have Divine Healing I tell you if your daughter was grievously vexed of a devil wouldn't you need Divine Healing yes sir amen I'll tell you what you said we don't need Divine healer I don't know who you who we is but it ain't me cuz the older I get the more I realize I need it sure the emphasis on having the fullness of the word but with the word comes the fullness of the power the full word is born in the manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God full strength as it was here on the earth you see the son of man has not left he is here but he is in Bride form Amen in his bride today doing the same Works remember those that are alive will not prevent those who are asleep this the only AGS that won't prevent that's right they were things in the other AIDs that prevented them from taking complete and full Authority but we're in the day of the full AIDS will we take it by force amen the Ephesian AIDS lost their first love was losing out and I but I'm talking to people today who have their first love right and if you lost it you can get it come on Peter you can walk on water again I've got a promise to you it's restored in this hour you can have that first love again you can have a fresh and up to- dat experience with God Amen and you can't regain that which you lost cuz this is the hour of [Applause] restoration hallelujah amen we have been predestinated yes amen not to fall amen come on other ages have went down in the ground but we have been predestinated it is our destiny the Rapture is is our destiny the resurrection of our loved ones is our destiny we have been predestinated to adoption Amen to full manifestation and and I'll tell you what here comes a full word bride and and the prophet was told take out your pen and start writing said then this is your word the word is in the bride the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has thus sayeth the Lord then it's gerti of the Holy Spirit Waters it till it's grown so what does God want done with his word he wants you to speak it prophesy son of man what I do with these bones prophesy over what I do is speak the word over it amen he don't want it just in books and and paper he wants it written in your heart he want it to be an inward thing he wants it to flow like a [Applause] river he said they have th sayth the Lord or they keep still amen well brother Tim we're just waiting on God to speak and when he does until he does we can't do anything God has spoken come on we got 1100 tapes of God has spoken we got a whole Bible here of God has spoken you've received a message from God himself and Heaven has open and sent that message from Jesus himself to the Le of sin age amen you have thus sayth the Lord you do not have to keep still say what he said believe what he said bring it in work hallelujah it's God's message to you it opened my blind eyes

Offspring of the righteous will be blessed you have thus sayith the Lord but it's got to be spoken right you must know what God wants done with his word is not to be a collection on your shelf come on now the sword is not for display over your fireplace it's been to be held in the mouth that's where god holds the sword amen it's got to come he wants it in your heart but it's got to come out of your mouth well I got it in my heart but it just hadn't come out but I tell you what Jeremiah said his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay I tell you if that word is really in your heart come on Amen brother it'll burn down on the inside you'll begin to speak against your enemy speak the promise of God speak to the dry bone

sit in my bitterness and a cold backsliding condition amen anymore I'm not a lukew and Leo de I do not identify with that I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I've got the mind of Christ and I know what he wants to with the [Applause] word we not may not have a prophetic gift of brother brandham but every preacher's commission with the same commission that Jesus gave the Apostles of Mark 16 in fact it's for every believer these signs shall follow them that believe Jacko was acting on the scripture anoint to seek with oil pray for the sick he'd seen no difference in this child but didn't stop him from believing didn't get healed all at once but something started moving maybe in this service tonight something starts moving right right that's right if I can get you speaking to your Mountain come on if your Mountain start hearing your voice come on it's got to move come on somebody's got to believe John 15 somebody's got to believe these scriptures in the Bible come on Amen if you start speaking grains of sand will start moving may not look like much but one grain will fall and another and another and another and another and a little bit that Waterhead Baby's Gone and it's well and healed come on church amen that's the way our God does it'll come to pass this bride has dust sayith the Lord let it be dramatized in your life the Holy Spirit Waters it till it's grown when is word dramatized when you start believing it amen and when you start believing it you speak it and when you speak it it's germatize and that releases the Holy Ghost and then all of Heaven is behind the word to bring it to pass amen they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still that's right then shut up your murmuring come on come on shut up that complaining that's right get rid of all that angerness anger and bitterness against God and repent so you can ride on the way come on now they how thus sayith the Lord are they keep their mouth shut that's right like this little woman you got to keep it out of your heart too because as a man think it's in his heart remember Sarah she just laughed in her heart then they will do the works of God for it is him himself in them continue to fulfill his word as he did not complete in his day all things when he was here he did not complete when all things when he was here for it was not time yet but we are here now at the time this is right this is the hour for real sons to stand up brother Bram told saw us coming he said I seen him coming they're going to reach the top of the mountain and take every Power that Satan has away from him come on

the Holy Ghost I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ it is yours tonight amen ah brother Tim you know we're we're Beyond laying on our hands well I don't know how we are Beyond a Great Commission because according to Invisible Union only those to whom the seals are open can fulfill it and the Great Commission says we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so we can't be Beyond laying on the hands it's part of the commission but if you insist on that that we're beyond that well I'll just tell you I'll just tell you of instances where the word was spoken without hands L fact I've been speaking the word over you all night tonight I've been speaking faith in your heart I've been telling you over and over again that you are your case is not lost you don't need to give up
