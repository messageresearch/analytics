already revealing himself in these meetings he's mighty to save Mighty to deliver amen how many enjoyed that message last night what a blessing amen thank you brother Andrew I'm a few years older than brother Andrew but he's a minister that I look up to in many ways we're just uh in awe of the anointing God has placed in his life amen I I enjoy brother Andrew because he has a tremendous gift to preach tremendous gift of evangelism but the draw is not to the gift amen but brother Andrew's Ministry is pointing our young people to the message of the hour that's why I believe the Lord blesses Ministries like that and that's that's what we want amen is to give the young people the message amen uh I I believe that the full message amen I I don't believe in preaching our young people a watered down modern gospel whole bunch of psychology or a 10-step plan to overcoming but the message works I'm a witness the message Works amen and I'd like to hear your voice tonight young people amen what kind of ministry do you desire amen you want some kind of modern some kind of preacher to come up here and try to be relatable to you and amen talk just you know talk about how God said let it be lit and David yeed a rock and try to relate to you some way as a young person no sir I say give me the message give me the word I believe we have a generation of young people that can handle the message of the hour they're called to take it and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord hallelujah amen that's why I I I I Marvel at where youth ministry has come around the message of the hour you know just in my lifetime it's amazing the growth and the development that we've seen in the ministry Amen to hear a a man preaching to teenagers last night talking about the third pole and the seventh seal and the bride age why because they're fit to handle it they're elected Sons and Daughters of God Amen some kind of a some kind of a modern Armament that might be good for Saul but David says no no I got something that works you keep your old armor you keep your old traditions you keep your modern ideas I got something amen that whipped a a lion yesterday it whipped a bear yesterday it'll whip Goliath today it'll whip every devil of hell because the word of God will overcome the enemy any time any place anywhere under any conditions amen I'm sorry we don't believe in preaching before the preacher amen we're just uh we're just enjoying ourselves so much amen if you enjoy the message amen then uh you're in the right place cuz that's what we're here to do is lift up the message of the hour it's not a lifestyle it's not a Creed it's not a tradition but it's the manifestation of the Living God in this day it is deity uttering its voice from the Bride of Jesus Christ amen it's being revealed right before you amen it's a it's a secret thing amen but uh but in this day the wise have understanding our eyes have been opened to the Revelation and if you enjoy the message of the hour you're really going to enjoy brother Josh Bennett tonight amen this is a message preacher and I'm so excited to have him preaching at our youth camp he's one of my personal biggest heroes in Ministry the way that he handles himself in and out of the pulpit he's an inspiration to me and so we're just honored to have him we'll uh we'll have you sing something maybe brother V yeah and uh we'll just introduce him amen God bless you let's pull on the word of God tonight love [Music] Jes singing oh how I love [Music] Jesus Oh How I Love Jesus [Music] Oh to me oh to to [Music] me you are

Jesus oh How I Love [Music] Jesus because he first Lov me let's just bow our hearts together Lord Jesus truly we love you tonight and Lord we know that you love us and your Prophet said how would we know we know because you said so and Lord then you prove that love by walking up calvary's hill and you laid down your life and No Greater Love Is there than this that a man would lay down his life for a friend and and Lord we're so thankful tonight Lord to have that Revelation in our heart and know that you loved us and your love is elective love Lord you loved us before the foundation of the world before we ever made our first mistake you had already declared your love for us Lord therefore we have a confidence that even after all the mistakes that love will still remain Lord I pray that you just come in this service this evening we already feel your presence but Lord we invite you Lord not just to be an an onlooker Lord or as the prophet said a recording Angel but God we invite you to come tonight walk open down every aisle and every every heart I pray God that you would discern every need and Lord that you would Minister Lord I I pray God as we just yield oursel to you Lord and surrender Our Lives into your hand Lord I pray that you'll do the preaching tonight and Lord may we do the hearing and the receiving and Lord when it's all said and done Lord we'll be so careful to give you all the glory and the honor because you alone are worthy we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this evening amen if you'd like to take your Bibles tonight I invite you to turn with us in the book of Hebrews I'd like to read from Hebrews chapter 6 and as you're turning there this evening we just certainly want to say uh how honored we are to be here and to be a part of these these uh meetings and just uh I tell you I look around and back here and I see other ministers out in the congregation and I'm certainly um the least among you and uh so we're just uh very honored to be here and and and to just be a part of what God is doing and and uh I think it's a great privilege anytime that you're that we're able to speak to the bride of Christ and and uh it's a great privilege of mine to be able to speak to the young people and and so um um you know I don't have anything to impress anybody but if I had a prayer tonight I would just say I'd like to you know I I pray that God could in some some just help somebody amen really that's what we have a desire to do just for the word to just be a help amen I I tell you if there's ever a time we needed God I believe it's right now and if there's ever a time that we need to stand on his word I believe it's right now so amen let's just look here tonight Hebrews chapter 6 you forgive me for a lengthy reading but I'm just going to read the whole chapter and the Bible says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will do will we do if God permit brother Brown said Paul was wanting us to know that these things are absolutely essential very important to the church but but yet there's um you know we can't just lay the foundation over and over we got to go on to Perfection Amen in the verse four it says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is n unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for God is Not unrighteous to for forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope and to the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after that he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things that means unchangeable by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have is an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner for us entered even Jesus made a high priest Forever After the order of MDC amen may God just add His blessings to the reading the words you're seated tonight I want to by God's help tonight U I'd like to speak on it's impossible and you know as we see here in Hebrews 6 and4 the Bible says it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing that they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame you know and as I as we read that th those those verses there um I was studying this uh a while back and I and I ran ran across something I thought was pretty good because you know there was one commentary said that you know uh that that Satan uh he he knows the scripture and how many knows that's true even when he in the temptation of Jesus he he brother Brandon said he coded the the the scripture not quoted it but he coded it and and you know he's always trying to use and and and and we know that Satan will use bible verses to bring uh to to battle in your mind and and you this commentary said this has to be one of Satan's favorite passages in the whole Bible amen when when the devil gets ready to take take a text to preach a sermon I he he generally goes right out of Hebrews 6 because it's a place that he can battle a struggling believer see see because he's always trying to convince you that you know uh you went too far and there's no way back and there's no hope for you but I want to tell you tonight I got some good news a prophet said that if there's a desire in your heart if there's something in you amen there if there's any little bit of a thing that's laying with you in your heart that's calling out for God or or a desire to serve God then the prophet said you have not went too far he said because if you went too far you wouldn't have that desire amen amen listen friends and Satan is always trying to use that to battle in the mind of a of a struggling Christian and I know that you know he's always trying to brother BR would say uh that that Satan would try to convince people that that that that don't have the Holy Ghost that they're all right and then he said he's always trying to tell those that do that they ain't got it how many knows that's the truth that's the battle see that's where say and where Satan will battle you is because and and I know that I'm preaching Amen to real people here tonight so I know that you're going to get with me you can fellowship with with me on this thought like brother Bram said amen because we make mistakes see because we're human we're constantly making mistakes and I know there's some people believe that once you get born again you don't make no more mistakes but I I'm just going to tell you that's not what the prophet taught amen because even after you're born again and you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're still a human and you're still subject to make mistakes and and so Satan is right there and every time you make a mistakes now think about this cuz I know he's battling with our young people in this every time you you trip up or every time you make a mistake he's right there and a and he's always taking you back see amen taking you back you got to go back and start over again cuz you know I guess I didn't get it on he makes you question every experience you ever had with God and that's why we don't never get nowhere because we're always going back and starting over and we we go a little bit and then we we trip up and make a mistake and then we're going back amen and and laying the foundation again but friends amen listen I believe that we got to lay the foundation and if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I encourage you I even plead with you amen I would not amen put it off another minute amen be baptized in his name Hallelujah if you ain't got a testimony tonight that I've been saved Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost I would not leave this building tonight until I knew for sure amen that you had had that experience with God but brother if you've already had that experience there ain't no need to go back Hallelujah and every time you make a mistake you ain't got to go back and get re-baptized and come on and do the first works over and over that is a trick of the [Applause] enemy is that right see that's where Satan is battling and that's the tactics that he used now listen amen how many's thankful for the message of the hour I'm so glad God sent a prophet because listen friends if God wouldn't have sent a prophet amen then we would have been subject to any interpretation of the word amen Satan was e interpreter and he come along using the scripture is that right quoting the scripture to her amen but listen thank God that we got we had a message in this day and a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word and I say this without apology tonight we have perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication we got to wonder what God's meant and what this scripture meant and what that meant amen we got a message perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication now brother Brown said about this scripture he said now I know what you legalist has got in your mind but right now he said but you're wrong brother Braham just quoted this scripture he said I know what you legalist or think but you're wrong he said I stand on this the Bible confirms it that if God ever saved a man he is saved for All Time and Eternity you can't make it say anything else you say well what about Hebrews 10:26 the Bible says for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fireing the nation which shall Devour the adversaries he that despised moses' law died without Mercy under two uh or three Witnesses of how much sord punishment suppose you shall he be thought worthy who has trien underfoot the Son of God and counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified AO an Unholy thing and a done despite unto the spirit of Grace amen now listen you they asked brother BR or brother BR is saying well what do you say about that brother Bram how does that look he said now think the scripture don't say now that's not talking about a Christian that's talking about a man that heard the word and turned away from it see if we sin what is sin unbelief so if we disbelieve willfully after that the gospel has been preached us there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin what is sin unbelief amen St John the 4th chapter Jesus said he that believeth not is condemned already see sin is not smoking and drinking and committing adultery you do that because you're an unbeliever that's just attributes see you do that because you're an unbeliever just and just to quit smoking and quit drinking and so forth like that don't mean that you're a Christian that's just an attributes of your conversion amen ain't that beautiful brother man said sin is unbelief see all these other things just attributes you only you're only doing that cuz you don't believe and then he says you can quit doing that still not be a Christian amen but but but that is attributes of a conversion in other words amen you if you are converted you will quit drinking and stealing and smoking and oh come on church amen amen when you get a true conversion there's going to be something that goes along with that and there's attributes of that is that what the prophet's saying he said now listen now he said but he that disbelieves willfully after that not after he received Christ in his heart the Bible don't say that said if we s if we willfully disbelieve see amen after we received a knowledge of the truth he wasn't talking to the Christian at all some woman come to me not long ago said brother brandom I'm a Christian but I blasphemed the Holy Ghost I said it's impossible amen it's impossible I tell you what I aim to do tonight I'm planning on taking Satan's favorite scripture and cutting his head off come on church amen David amen walked up to Goliath one day and after he smoted him with that rock he walked down there and David didn't have no sword so he took Goliath's sword he took gath's own sword and cut his head off I tell you what what we're going to do here by the grace of God tonight is we're going to take Satan's favorite scripture and his favorite quotes and we just going to chop his head off Hallelujah you say well brother Josh I'm a Christian but I blasphemed the Holy Ghost impossible the prophet of God said is [Applause] impossible Hallelujah even brother venam himself had a had struggle with this scripture because you know he said at one time I thought amen a if somebody wants receive the Holy Ghost and then would backslide he'd be lost forever I just couldn't make this other to make sense with that and I thought well why is that in the Bible said it it says in the Bible he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me at eternal life and shall never come into judgment but has passed from Death unto life and all that the father has given me shall come to me and and none of them is lost and I'll raise them up at the last day and no man can pluck them out of my hand how does that divy up with this I just couldn't understand it amen how it's impossible for those that was once inlight I thought there's something wrong I just can't get it and then brother Brown said I begin to think about I went down to a little Pentecostal meeting and there's a man sitting there he said I never told this before the public but there's a man sitting on one side and uh uh spoke in tongues a man on the other interpreted and they would tell different things was going on I thought and one of them was speaking tongues and one in I thought my isn't this wonderful and I thought how glorious them must be Angels come down in the form of men but you know what brother Brown went and he said that because he had such a interest in the in the Supernatural in this move of God Amen he began to get around them men a little bit and because of the gift that God or or because of the discernment of the word that was in him amen he he he talked to the one man and he said he was an absolute genuine believer and then he talked to the other man and he said and that man was totally different he was arrogant in his spirit and and all these things and and and and he broke into a vision and he saw that the man was living with a woman that wasn't even his wife now brother Brown was really struggling how could it be that there could be a a real true Holy Ghost manifestation listen I'm telling you I I you young people this will help you tonight because you have watched and you have watched Men that you had confidence in and even preached this message for years and even there would be manifestations of the Holy Ghost in their Ministry only for them to uh in the end turn and walk away from it and then it causes you to question everything and amen and if you're not careful it'll cause you to even question the message but I'm here to tell you tonight the message wasn't the problem the message was never the problem brother Bon was having a hard time understanding amen but he was sitting there reading his Bible and he said a wind blew and it blew it to Hebrews 6 and he began read them verses that I just read amen and he said he begin to ponder on that and he just closed his Bible he said as he thought on it he was still wondering he opened it up randomly again and the wind blew right back to Hebrews 6 and he began to read it again and he broke into a vision and he saw a man going forth sewing seed in white and then there was another man that come behind him in Black sewing seeds in the same field and then the rain came amen and the sun begin to shine on the sea the seeds begin to grow amen they both amen begin to grow and mature he said but after a while see what was it it was wheat and there was tears in the same field and as they as they begin to grow amen under the rain because listen the Bible says the rain falls on the just and the unjust and as they begin to grow Amen brother Brown said but all there come a a a season of drought and the sun begin to shine and amen and both the wheed and the tears begin to dry up and they both begin to cry out to God for rain wait a minute let's stop right there for a minute and just make a point amen you mean to tell me that even a true wheat seed plant can get dry you mean even a true amen seed of God a real believer can have dry spells in their in their walk with the Lord you mean to tell me that even real true message churches can have seasons amen when it's kind of dry well according the prophet he said amen and and they begin to cry out to God and then he said the Skies begin to darken and the Rain Begin to Fall and he said when the Rain Begin to Fall that week amen begin to rejoice in that rain and say thank you Lord for the rain amen listen and he said in the tears he begin to also lift their hands and rejoice and say thank you Lord for the rain is that right amen the prophet of God said see amen then he began to catch an understanding amen of what was actually happening amen and he said that's why you can't look at a manifestation as an Evidence of the individual come on church he didn't say it wasn't an Evidence of a move of God can we just preach a balance of this thing because people's fighting on every side of it but I tell you what amen we got to get the way the prophet said it amen it's an Evidence listen if there's healings and there's Miracles and there SIDS and wonders that is a work of the Holy Ghost and that is an Evidence of a manifestation of the power of God Among Us the prophet said but it ain't an evidence that the individual is is true there's only one true evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost and that is that you receive the word for your age Hallelujah I told you we going to cut that down head off tonight because I'm telling you he's telling some of you oh if I could shout like sister so and so if I could dance like this sister if I can speak in Tong amen I can have the victory listen friends if you believe this message and if there's something in your heart that agrees with the word of God and you can say Amen to every word for your age that is all the evidence that you need Hallelujah I tell you what that'll do that'll hold you when the camp is over and when the chill bumps is gone and there ain't nobody shouting and there ain't nobody dancing if the word is settled in your heart in the good days and the bad days when you're up and when you're down when you feel God and when you don't [Applause] Hallelujah brother BR said this brings an understanding of Matthew 7:21 because I come to me he said many will come to me in that day saying Lord Lord have we not cast out devils in have we not done all these things and what will we say depart from me ye that were con I never knew you see if they shall follow away if they shall fall away I thought about that fall away I got to looking at if they shall fall away see and that word fall away it's it's got a much deeper meaning than just fall says to fall away is is to dep depart from depart from the true Faith amen and from worship of Jehovah to fall away to turn from and walk in error and see Satan would like to misinterpret that to you and just tell you every time you fall you fell [Applause] away but I want to tell you tonight amen you can fall I'm going to prove it to you by the prophets you can fall but brother if you're a holy ghost filled seat of God you might fall but it's impossible for you to fall away Hallelujah let me tell you tonight and I want the devil and all hell to know I have failed many times and I'll foul again but brother amen there is something settled in my heart I can't not I will not I will never fall away I'll never say this message is wrong I will never walk away from the say the Lord I will never deny what God has done in this day fall down you better believe it fall away it's impossible Hallelujah cuz the Bible says a righteous man fth seven times and riseth again hallelujah amen listen friends I got a scripture for you tonight A righteous man fth seven times but Rises again brother BR said listen we all fall down falling down ain't what sets us apart it's the getting back up everybody falls down but brother a real soldier gets back up just tell you what the prophet said he said amen just keep your mind just pure and on Christ he say well you see amen uh if you don't watch you'll get yourself over in a place if you if you keep up thinking on that and and he said now listen to what brother man said don't think that you can live so perfect that you won't make a mistake don't you think you'll ever get that way cuz you won't no you're not sinless not like that see you'll certainly get off track on one side or the or on that side but a man that's once knocked down if he's a real Soldier he'll rise up again oh what's the song say Let Me Lord let me rise and try again he said but a coward as soon as he sees or makes the first mistake little mistake amen he'll be like that little water bug I was talking about well call right back to the water again he'll he just can't stand it said I got a lot of respect for a man when he does make a mistake he's got enough courage to rise and try again we're all going to make mistakes the best makes mistakes just in case you think well brother BR change that later I this is from 1965 power of transformation now we're not perfect people we make our mistakes we do things that's wrong because you see but love covers all that amen why cuz we're we we're willing that when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another see that's real Warriors right there that's really men and women that's Gall a man that would go out there on the battlefield amen that's got nerve enough to walk out there but when he gets knocked down amen then get back up and try again I thought this was beautiful brother Brown talked about uh and I never absolutely caught it in this way but brother Brown was talking about the the the the uh The Crow and the dove on the ark and brother BR said he said he was showing the difference of the nature of the two birds and he said see they let that that that Crow out of the Ark and brother rown said it went out of that Ark and it went from dead body to dead body he said that Arc that that that Crow never did come back see cuz amen when it was released out of the Ark it just it just left and went from dead body to dead body he said but he took the Dove and released it out of the Ark and he said when that Dove was released he said because amen that Dove was of a different nature it couldn't stomach them things and and the Bible says there was no rest for the Dove's feet so what did the dove do it came back and brother said that was a type of the True Church of the Living God and every True Believer he said listen you may go out amen but you'll never be satisfied out there because your Nature's different hallelujah amen you might backslide and you got you might walk out he said but you're going to come back you're coming back if you're a DB Hallelujah because there's nothing out there that can satisfy God the desire and The Thirst and the longing in your heart this why he said in the token I know I'm reading so close but I I mean I want to nail it down and clinch it tonight the prophet of God said if you was ever healed if you live Al if you live long enough you'll get sick again but if you one time take the token you got it forever the Bible says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption not till the next Revival not from Youth Camp to Youth Camp not from revival to Revival brother B say you just got an emotional workup but when you're dead and your life is hid in God through Christ you're sealed by the Holy Ghost and if you're once baptized by the Holy Spirit you can backslide uhoh about half the church is going to shut down on me right here but the prophet say you can backslide you say even with the Holy Ghost that's what he said you can backslide that's true but you can't get away from the seal if you ever get sealed by the Holy Ghost brother it's not from revival to Revival Camp to Camp it's not based on your feeling it's not based on your SS come on church it's not based on what you see it ain't between you and the preacher it ain't between you and the church every preacher in this message could walk away but if you've been sealed by the token and you got the literal life of Jesus Christ brother that will hold for All Time and Eternity let's tell the devil tonight it's impossible to be sealed with the Holy Ghost and lose [Applause] it now brother Brown said you go out and sin and do things he said he said now you ain't going to get by with it can I just tell you what he said he said you going to get a good whipping he said you'll reap what you sow I think you're just going to go out there and sin and get by with it if you do and you got that kind of attitude it just shows you've never been born again you get it if you if you still got the desire in you to do wrong then you're still wrong for he has perfected forever those it's quoting the scripture there and he said in them beasts under the old on the Old Testament under the legal days offered a yearly continually amen could never take away the sin see but when you put your hands on his upon his head and confess your sin and are born again of the spirit of God we have no more desire of sin sin has passed from you that's for Time and Eternity you'll make your mistakes you'll fall this is staggering and but he said it you'll willfully do wrong you'll go out sometimes and do things and that that that don't mean that don't mean you're lost that means you're going to get corrected listen to me young people I want us to settle down in your heart because listen I'm tired of watching The Devil take y'all and every time you make a mistake and every time a a thought crosses your mind and every time amen you stumble a little bit amen the devil's beating you down with condemnation and amen and and trying to destroy amen the work of the Holy Ghost in your life amen listen friend you're going to make mistakes you're young people and you're going to make plenty more mistakes but if you got if you've been born [Applause] again you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost the prophet of God said you'll make your mistakes amen you'll even get corrected for their mistakes but that don't mean you're lost brother B in this quote he goes straight to his children he said my my children my my you know they make a lot of mistakes they do things against my rules and a lot of times even when they do them they know what's coming and they're going to get a weapon for it he said but they're still my children listen I'm asking you this you young people tonight amen how many mistakes have how many times have you dis appointed your mom and daddy but how many times is have they have they kicked you out of the family for it no they'll correct you but you're still their their their child you're still their son you're still amen their daughter amen listen that's the point brother Brown's making and listen what he said it's impossible for that man to ever be gone again that once been born of the eternal life God is not an Indian giver he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into judgment but is passed from Death unto life and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's God's promise now you say well brother Josh ain't there a line you can cross sure absolutely because you know I believe that brother B shows it plainly he said that Cain I I'll just read a quot to you he said he said it made Cain go away a willful sinner he willfully dis was disobedient and every person will be the same way willfully disobedient after he seen Abel's message so Vindicated of God that it was the truth and then refused to do it he crossed a line divid he crossed the div in line brother Brown said there's a line that you can cross you know you know that don't you and when you see it in the scripture and you won't do it he said listen oh you'll go on and be blessed so so was everyone of Israel they live right there in the wilderness and raised their children in their crops and was blessed and everything but every one of them eternally eternally separated from God see cuz you can cross the separating line do you believe that Cain did it you know what they call that they call it a in in in terms that there's a term they use a lot of times in a Aviation they call it a point of no return and and and it's it's it's something to describe something that has reached a place that it can't go back so in other words like you know uh the a point of no return would be a a place that could be reached maybe in a journey or in a flight and and and and they've reached a certain place and they know that you know they ain't even got enough fuel to go back where they come from so returning back is not an option see so it's reached a place that you can't return it's it's it it's past stopping at that point is that right amen and I just say this tonight amen I believe that brother Brown even said that this nation and please don't get mad at me about this but I'm just saying what the prophet said he said it's reach the place Amen brother man said I believe that this nation cannot repent it's it's impossible another what's he trying to say we've come to a place in our politics and amen that that that it's no going by it's it's reached a place there's no turn it around brother R said you could put an Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington on every street corner and you wouldn't turn it around see that's where we are as a nation and individuals can get in the same place cuz brother BR is clearly showing us that Cain come to that spot amen he crossed the line I heard brother BR say on tape amen just the other day he said there was a woman in the meeting last night he said I believe that she crossed the line between uh mercy and judgment in the meeting that night brother B amen by that discernment was watching that and he saw that she had crossed that line amen but listen for I want to tell you this tonight if there's a line in the negative if you can get to a place that there ain't no going back and there's no repenting and there's no turning around around that's where Cain got cuz the Bible said he walked out of the presence of God but brother if there's a play if there's a line in the negative I believe there's also a line in the positive I believe there's a place where you can get by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost there is a place that you can get as a real believer brother there ain't no going back there there ain't no turning around there ain't no come on Friends there's no changing of it tonight all the devil's Out of Hell couldn't take it away from you Hallelujah I believe there's some young people in here tonight you reached the point of no return Retreat is not an option come on friends why will we go back there ain't nothing to go back [Music] to amen some of you ought to look behind you tonight and realize I've come too far I fought too [Music] hard Hallelujah I've overcome too much to turn back now I remember one time I was swimming across a a Cove of of a lake and I I I got tired I was wore out man I got tired aen I was swiming ACR but I tell you what I look behind me and I realized hey there listen there's more water behind me than there is in front of me I know some of you's been there before and when you get in that place where going back ain't no option amen going turning around ain't no option amen you know what they call it in military turns burning the bridges burn the ships that's what the Vikings used to do when they when that when they would come ashore amen they would burn their ships why because they didn't want no option of [Applause] retreat they call it Crossing the Rubicon and they get that turn from when there was a a Caesar back in the in the Roman Empire and he was coming in with an army amen but he knew that if he crossed that River if he was defeated he would be executed him and all his men with him amen but they made it decision amen it this listen amen it's either it's either Victory or die because once we cross this River there ain't no going back amen and I tell you what I believe we cross the Rubicon tonight Retreat is not an option hallelujah amen I say this the only difference between us and Them is De fee ain't an option either because my God has never lost a battle Hallelujah so brother if we can't go back if we can't Retreat and we can't be defeated then the only thing for us to do tonight is go forward in Victory Hallelujah you say but brother Josh what am I going to do when the Devil comes tomorrow amen take your sword and like that devil I tell you what it's time for us to do do what the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from [Applause] [Music] you old Chinese they had to saying too they said break the kettles and sink the boats burn the bridges amen wow we ain't going back it ain't even an option oh thank you Jesus listen friends can I just say this night it was impossible for Cain to repent you know what because there was nothing in him do you realize that God gave him an opportunity just the same God came down and said if you just do like your brother you'd be accepted also amen but it was nothing in him amen he turned down his opportunity and walked out of the presence of God I got to think about that today amen as as Cain was walking out of the presence of God Amen but then I got to thinking about Adam also walking out of the garden amen after that he had fell amen but there was a big difference between Adam and Cain Cain was walking out of the presence of God with no hope of any way back he could never return he had no hope no promise he could not repent it was not even possible but when Adam amen and Eve started walking down the Garden of Eden there was a bloody sheep skin that was slapping on their legs and there was blood that was running down and the voice of God pierced through the silence and said I put imity between the woman's seed and the serpent seed what was it amen as they were walking out as Sons and Daughters of God they were walking out with a promise I'll make a way for you to come back again Hallelujah listen to me up here there's people that'll walk away from this message and there ain't no way for them to ever come back that may be a little bit bit too hard for some of you but it's true amen there's no way cuz they can't repent there's nothing in them to repent but brother if you backslide amen I believe amen if you're if there's something in your heart if there's a seed in your soul on your way out you're walking out with a promise that there is a way for you to come back I think there might be somebody in here tonight amen you might be that prodical you might be that wavered one you might be that backslid one and the devil's trying to tell you you went too far there's no hope for you it's impossible for you to be [Applause] lost oh listen Heen I I I took the slingshot now and I got that devil laying down so is there any do Davis out here tonight that'll want to walk up here and grab the devil's own sword I invite you come on is there any little Davis out there tonight come on up get your get the devil's favorite scripture let's tell the devil you want to talk about impossibilities devil let's talk about some possibilities it is impossible for my God to lie and he said I'm Healed he said I'm free he said I'm delivered he said I'm an overcomer and it is impossible for him to lie let me tell you something tonight it's impossible for me to be deceived impossible all you say but the spirit of the last day Matthew 24:2 it'll be so close that if it were possible it would deceive the very elected but it ain't possible the devil's trying to tell you it ain't possible for you to make it but God said it's impossible for you to miss it it's impossible tonight Hallelujah God cannot lie and he said I'm an overcomer Hallelujah he gave me a promise that I will sit with him in his throne even as he overcome and sit with the father on his throne take that sword tonight and cut that devil's head off [Music] Hallelujah s i Rejoice go ahead Stand Fast in the Liberty where God has made you free pishop re amen this is not a fable this is not a pump up or a workup this is the Eternal Word of God a Vindicated a message and the prophet is tell you may fall but you won't fall away Hallelujah this is a difference between Judas and Peter because Judas couldn't repent but El read your Bibles Peter made plenty of mistakes too matter of fact and I'm going to I know and I'm going to admit it tonight Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost and I see that and realize Peter would have never cursed and denied god with the Holy Ghost you understand we understand that amen but there was a major difference between Judas and Peter I tell you what it was seed [Music] listen to me Church you young people got the same struggles and problems of all them other kids out there you're going through the same battles but there's a big difference between you and them seed predestination Hallelujah the prophet of God said Israel had their backward Parts they had their parts that was not praiseworthy and that's what bam looked and saw and begin to amen begin to try to curse them is that right he said but what BM didn't see amen they might add their troubles and they might add their struggles and they might add their problems but they also had a pillar of fire that was leading them they also have a prophet of God god with a Vindicated word they also had a smitten Rock they also had a Brazen serpent that was lifted up upon a pole oh yeah we got our same struggles and our problems but I tell you we got something that the world ain't got Hallelujah you got a message you got a holy ghost you got the Holy Ghost [Applause] big difference between Judas and Peter you never find anywhere where where where where uh Jesus after Judas uh uh betrayed him and never find where Jesus went after him and look at old Peter one day even Jesus told him said get behind me Satan and then Peter comes along he's always messing up brother Ray he's I tell you he's one of my f Peter is my favorite character in The Bible because I feel like I just relate to him so much CU I'm always getting my foot in my mouth and I'm always trying to you know and when I'm trying to do good I just turns out bad and I mean Peter even when he was trying to defend the Lord he took his sword out cut the uh solders ear off and all the things that Happ and and and then only to go and deny the Lord and after Jesus had died amen I love this cuz Peter got so discouraged that he went back to fishing went on right on back out to the life that God that that Christ had caught him out of but while he was out there fishing Brother David there was some little women that went down to the Grave that morning and Jesus looked at them and said go tell my disciples and Peter Hallelujah he could not forgive him because Peter belong to him Hallelujah Jesus looked at him one day and said Peter Satan desires you that he sift you as a sand amen but I have prayed for you that thy faith fail thee not I tell you what I'm looking at a bunch of young people I'm looking at young boys and young girls in this building tonight sat would love to have you sat would love to have your talent sat would love to have your beauty sat would love to have the strength of your Youth and you might be S standing here tonight thinking well I if Jesus would have pray for me like he prayed for Peter then maybe I'd have a chance when you get back to your dorm tonight go read John 17 h huah cuz he said I don't pray for you alone but for them also Hallelujah the same one that prayed for Peter prayed for me and that's why my faith will not fail oh as a musicians come tonight amen let me just close in this amen because this scripture continues on it's impossible for them to f that them that fall away to be renewed again into repentance amen but I tell you that ain't the end of that that chapter he goes on and he says but I am persuaded of better things of you glory to God and the prophet of God said now he's talking to the real Christian because you are secure in Christ this world is headed to a tribulation but I persuaded a better things of you I ain't going in a tribulation I'm going in a rapure this world is under judgment but I persuade a better things of you tonight there's going to be a resurrection we're going to have a body change Hallelujah hear the word of the Lord tonight I'm persuaded of better things of you things that accompany salvation brother I feel good tonight I got
