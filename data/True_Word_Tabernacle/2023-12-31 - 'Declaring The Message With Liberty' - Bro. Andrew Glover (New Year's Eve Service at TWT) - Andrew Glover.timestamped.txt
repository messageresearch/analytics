[1:19:32] this house the building but he's in this
[1:19:35] house amen we're can't hear that song
[1:19:39] sung but to think about a prophet who
[1:19:41] said one time that little girl was down
[1:19:43] there in the cave and it was real dark
[1:19:44] and there was all kinds of creeping
[1:19:46] crawling things and he said she got a
[1:19:49] little scared and he said then all of a
[1:19:50] sudden she heard a voice said now don't
[1:19:52] fear little sis that there's a man here
[1:19:55] who can turn on the light and amen I
[1:19:57] believe that same man there is here
[1:19:58] tonight and amen I believe he can turn
[1:20:00] on the light and amen we know that when
[1:20:03] the light comes on the devil flees
[1:20:05] brother BR said like Roaches on the
[1:20:06] floor when the light comes on Amen
[1:20:08] they're trying to hide amen because
[1:20:10] there's a mighty Army raising up here

[1:20:14] of almighty God do you believe that
[1:20:16] tonight amen we're just honored to be a

[1:20:36] making room for the word amen amen we
[1:20:39] want tonight just to buy our hearts
[1:20:40] before we open the word and let's just
[1:20:43] in invite him to come I believe he's
[1:20:44] already here but let's just ask him now
[1:20:47] in the ministering of his word to just
[1:20:48] take the preeminence Among Us how many
[1:20:51] would say Lord you speak through through
[1:20:52] the minister and here through me amen I
[1:20:55] believe he's here tonight to do that
[1:20:56] Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here
[1:20:59] on this final service of the Year 2023
[1:21:02] Lord father if we would have stood at
[1:21:06] the end of last year and Lord you would
[1:21:08] have come down and told us everything
[1:21:10] that we would go through and every
[1:21:12] situation every problem every bad day
[1:21:15] every good day Lord you went through the
[1:21:17] whole the whole year with us Lord then
[1:21:20] we would not be walking by faith we'd be
[1:21:22] walking by side but Lord you didn't do
[1:21:24] that you just give us your promise that
[1:21:26] I'm with thee I'll never leave thee I'll
[1:21:28] never forsake thee and so Lord we know
[1:21:31] that whatever this year held it would
[1:21:33] have scared us to death we would have no
[1:21:35] doubt been fearful and tried to retreat

[1:23:48] have everyone here tonight and amen I I
[1:23:50] don't know a better way to end out the
[1:23:52] old year and bring in the new year then
[1:23:54] amen fellowshipping around the word with
[1:23:55] Believers amen and so we're not going to
[1:23:58] try not to be before you very long
[1:24:00] tonight just have a few things here on
[1:24:01] our heart to share with you and pray
[1:24:03] it'll be a blessing and a help to you
[1:24:05] but in the book of Acts the 20th
[1:24:07] chapter in the 25th verse um actually
[1:24:12] we'll begin reading at the 24th verse
[1:24:15] Paul here is is given his Farewell word
[1:24:18] so to speak and he says here in the 24th
[1:24:21] verse but none of these things move me
[1:24:24] neither count I my life dear unto myself
[1:24:26] so that I might finish my course with
[1:24:28] joy and the ministry which I have
[1:24:32] received of the Lord Jesus to testify
[1:24:36] the gospel of the grace of God and now
[1:24:38] behold I know that ye all among whom
[1:24:41] I've have gone preaching the kingdom of
[1:24:43] God shall see my face no more wherefore
[1:24:46] I take you to record this day that I am
[1:24:48] pure from the blood of all men for I
[1:24:51] have not shunned to declare unto you
[1:24:54] somebody say declare declare I have not
[1:24:56] shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:24:59] counsel of God now watch this change
[1:25:01] here in verse 28 he says now take heed
[1:25:04] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[1:25:06] flock over which the Holy Ghost hath
[1:25:07] made you overseers to feed the Church of
[1:25:10] God which he hath purchased with his own
[1:25:13] blood so I believe that Paul was saying
[1:25:15] the things that he has declared is now
[1:25:18] the food to feed the Church of the
[1:25:20] Living God he says for I know this that
[1:25:23] after my departing shall Grievious
[1:25:25] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[1:25:28] the flock now also of your own selves
[1:25:30] shall men arise speaking perverse things
[1:25:33] now here's why they're doing this to
[1:25:35] draw away disciples after them now
[1:25:39] therefore watch and remember that by the
[1:25:41] space of three years I ceased not to
[1:25:44] warn everyone day and night with tears
[1:25:47] and now Brethren I commend you to God
[1:25:51] and to the word of his is Grace I love
[1:25:53] this way Paul says it which is able to
[1:25:55] build you up how many believes that the
[1:25:57] word of Grace is able to build you up
[1:26:01] and to give you an inheritance among all
[1:26:04] them which are Sanctified amen we ask
[1:26:07] Lord this evening to add the blessing to
[1:26:09] the reading of his word as you can have
[1:26:11] your seats here this afternoon I want to
[1:26:13] by the help of the Lord here to talk to
[1:26:15] you and speak to you for just a few
[1:26:16] moments tonight I want to speak to you
[1:26:18] on declaring the message with Liberty
[1:26:21] amen declaring the message with Liberty
[1:26:24] I've just been recently studying here uh
[1:26:27] quite a extensive study on the places
[1:26:29] where brother Brandon will talk about
[1:26:31] the term Amen in the middle of the road
[1:26:34] and I I think it's a very powerful thing
[1:26:36] as Believers I believe it's essential
[1:26:39] amen for believers to find the balance
[1:26:41] in all things how many agree amen you
[1:26:43] got to have the balance in the natural
[1:26:45] amen as well as in the spiritual I
[1:26:48] believe that is essential I've often uh
[1:26:50] thought of how that brother bradam told
[1:26:51] Brother Perry green he said Perry always
[1:26:54] keep your balance in the scriptures
[1:26:56] because that word balance is a very it's
[1:26:58] a very powerful definition it means a
[1:27:01] condition in which different elements
[1:27:03] are equal amen or in the correct
[1:27:05] proportion stability of one's mind or
[1:27:08] feelings it means to keep or put
[1:27:10] something in a steady position so that
[1:27:13] it does not fall so there amen is a
[1:27:16] direct connection between balance
[1:27:18] stability and not falling now you know
[1:27:21] that Isa said that there would be a
[1:27:23] highway right and then he said there
[1:27:25] would be a way and it would be the way
[1:27:27] of Holiness and then in the Book of
[1:27:28] Matthew Jesus comes along and he said
[1:27:30] now there's actually two ways he said
[1:27:32] there's the Broadway and he said that
[1:27:34] way leadth unto destruction and many
[1:27:37] there be that go there in out he said
[1:27:39] but then there's a narrow way and he
[1:27:40] said that way is a way to life and he
[1:27:43] said few there will be that finds it so
[1:27:45] amen we're seeing here then that there's
[1:27:47] actually a balance coming to the church
[1:27:50] amen his brother Brandon would tell us
[1:27:51] when he come on on the field he said I
[1:27:53] met two classes of people he said the
[1:27:55] first class was the fundamental he said
[1:27:57] they had all the doctrine they knew how
[1:27:58] to they knew how to write the check but
[1:28:00] they didn't have no faith he said then
[1:28:02] was the Pentecostal he said they had all
[1:28:04] the power and no teaching he said see
[1:28:06] amen but what I was doing was standing
[1:28:08] in the middle amen pulling from both
[1:28:11] sides amen calling to the middle of the
[1:28:13] road now I kind of think it's something
[1:28:15] because if you go back and study amen
[1:28:17] the fundamentals actually had in their
[1:28:19] mind amen that they were the high class
[1:28:22] you know they were the ones that had all
[1:28:23] figured out educated intellectual and
[1:28:25] then look at the Pentecostals and they
[1:28:27] was just the people on the other side of
[1:28:29] the track you know speaking in tongues
[1:28:31] and shouting and rejoicing and praising
[1:28:33] God Amen but a Prophet come and he said
[1:28:35] now this bride she's not going to be
[1:28:37] high class and he said she's not going
[1:28:39] to be low class he said but I'm going to
[1:28:41] bring her to the middle of the road and
[1:28:43] she's going to be middle class Amen in
[1:28:45] other words she's going to live in a
[1:28:47] balance where she will not be up one day
[1:28:49] amen and down the next but listen she
[1:28:51] will come to a place amen of stability
[1:28:54] to where nothing will be able to move
[1:28:56] her amen from the things that I have
[1:28:58] revealed to her and I'll say it like
[1:29:00] this I do not believe that the message
[1:29:02] of the hour amen needs to be balanced
[1:29:04] amen I believe that it is already
[1:29:07] balanced amen amen I believe that when
[1:29:09] the prophet said I'm always in the
[1:29:10] middle of the road amen he said the
[1:29:12] angel of the Lord is in the middle of
[1:29:14] the road he said the pillar of fire is
[1:29:16] in the middle of the road he said he
[1:29:18] said the true message lays in the middle
[1:29:20] of the road so sometimes amen people get
[1:29:22] to wondering how are we going to fix
[1:29:24] this how are we going to balance it amen
[1:29:26] you're not going to do it in your own
[1:29:28] understanding amen but if you'll begin
[1:29:30] to declare the message amen the message
[1:29:33] is already balanced and the message amen
[1:29:36] will bring a thing to the stability now
[1:29:38] Amen brother says it very beautifully he
[1:29:40] said when you're born again he said you
[1:29:42] are positionally placed in the middle of
[1:29:44] the road amen when you were born again
[1:29:46] you were not born in one ditch amen or
[1:29:49] the other you were born again
[1:29:51] positionally placed in the middle of the
[1:29:53] road he said some people when they get
[1:29:55] born again they get set right in the
[1:29:57] middle of the road and their eyes are on
[1:29:59] Christ and finally they get over here so
[1:30:01] much knowledge and wisdom oh they know
[1:30:03] it all but you don't know nothing and if
[1:30:05] you don't do that then you run off on
[1:30:07] this side with a bunch of wildfire and
[1:30:08] fanaticism amen but right in the middle
[1:30:11] of the road amen there's a true sound
[1:30:14] unadulterated gospel and power of God
[1:30:17] that's right amen right down through
[1:30:19] there taking the Kings and the monarchs
[1:30:21] where any anybody can stand in search
[1:30:23] amen and they can see that it's the
[1:30:25] power amen of almighty God it's not a
[1:30:28] fanaticism and it's not a formality amen
[1:30:31] it's the power of God Amen I want to
[1:30:34] declare unto you tonight amen that the
[1:30:36] atmosphere that's in this building
[1:30:38] tonight amen it's not a fanaticism amen
[1:30:41] and neither is it a formality amen but
[1:30:43] it's the power of the almighty God it is
[1:30:46] the promise of the father that he said
[1:30:49] he would endure you amen with power from
[1:30:51] on high brother B said friends I've
[1:30:53] always tried to keep a balance of the
[1:30:55] road he said you get way off on
[1:30:57] formalism Amen just just formal
[1:30:59] ritualistic as they can be and people
[1:31:01] grab for that but then if you don't
[1:31:03] watch you'll get so pum over on the
[1:31:04] other side and be just as fanatic as you
[1:31:07] can be amen but there's a middle of the
[1:31:09] road where the true sound s gospel is
[1:31:13] preached amen and God moves in there
[1:31:16] amen amen God don't move in the formal
[1:31:18] ditch amen and God don't move in the
[1:31:20] fanatical ditch amen but God moves in
[1:31:23] the middle of the road amen and
[1:31:25] vindicates the move to be the truth amen
[1:31:28] I want to say this man does not have to
[1:31:30] vindicate this message amen God has
[1:31:32] already amen Vindicated this message as
[1:31:35] the balance Amen to the church in the
[1:31:38] age we're living brother said the main
[1:31:40] thing is right in the middle of the road
[1:31:42] with enough spirit in you to keep you
[1:31:43] warm and moving amen and knowing enough
[1:31:46] to keep yourself under obedience Amen to
[1:31:48] the spirit amen just to move as the
[1:31:51] spirit moves amen not till or not after
[1:31:54] amen but just as the spirit moves now
[1:31:57] amen I was listening to a tape the other
[1:31:58] day and I love how the prophet says
[1:32:00] things he said now don't forget this
[1:32:02] coming New Year's night he said oh I
[1:32:05] remember the first watch party that I've
[1:32:07] ever had here in this Tabernacle he said
[1:32:09] I don't guess there's anyone here
[1:32:10] remembers it amen but that was one night
[1:32:13] amen that the Lord took plenty of starch
[1:32:16] out of your pasture amen that was one
[1:32:18] night amen that the Lord took plenty of
[1:32:21] starch out of your pastor amen so we're
[1:32:23] looking forward for a great time being
[1:32:25] Brothers telling the church the first
[1:32:27] watch night party we ever had in this
[1:32:30] church amen the Holy Ghost took all the
[1:32:32] starch amen out of me and I wondered why
[1:32:35] amen he would use that word starch amen
[1:32:38] because the word starch means stiffness
[1:32:40] amen and when something gets stiff amen
[1:32:42] then it's no longer flexible it's no
[1:32:44] longer pliable amen but when it loses
[1:32:47] the start amen and the spirit of God
[1:32:49] begins to move then you're as flexible
[1:32:52] as the new growth in the trees you're as
[1:32:54] you're as liberated as the as the sons
[1:32:56] of God Amen because it's not a man
[1:32:59] moving you it's the spirit moving you
[1:33:02] amen I know sometimes people wonder amen
[1:33:04] as Christians they Wonder Lord what do I
[1:33:06] need to really be amen what God has
[1:33:09] called me to be do I need an education
[1:33:11] or do I need to get all these things
[1:33:13] memorized what do I need to be but can I
[1:33:15] tell you what I believe from the message
[1:33:17] amen that every single one of you all
[1:33:19] need Amen to be what God called you to
[1:33:22] be I believe it's found in 2 Corinthians
[1:33:24] 3 where Paul said now the Lord is that
[1:33:27] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:33:29] is amen there is Liberty amen that's the
[1:33:33] only thing we need is
[1:33:35] Liberty that word Liberty has a very
[1:33:38] powerful definition it means to do or to
[1:33:41] Omit things amen that have no
[1:33:43] relationship to Salvation amen Liberty
[1:33:46] is a license it's the Liberty to do as
[1:33:48] one pleases amen true Liberty amen is
[1:33:52] living as we ought to amen and not as we
[1:33:55] please amen now can I say it like this I
[1:33:57] thank God for sending the message of the
[1:34:00] hour because I believe that the message
[1:34:02] of the hour amen has omitted everything
[1:34:05] that has nothing to do with true
[1:34:07] salvation amen or relationship to Jesus
[1:34:10] Christ amen in other words I'll say it
[1:34:12] like this amen the message of the hour
[1:34:15] has omitted all the nonsense amen it's
[1:34:18] omitted all the Baptist ideas and
[1:34:20] Pentecostal tradition Amen in Catholic
[1:34:22] carryover the message of the hour has
[1:34:25] omitted all that and has brought a
[1:34:27] liberty into the church amen to cause
[1:34:30] the bride Amen to be exactly what she is
[1:34:33] brother B said not for one moment do I
[1:34:35] bring a message Amen to the people that
[1:34:38] they may follow me or join my church or
[1:34:41] start some fellowship I have never done
[1:34:43] that and I will not do that now I have
[1:34:45] no interest in those things amen but I
[1:34:48] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:34:50] and people and if if I can accomplish
[1:34:52] just one thing I will be satisfied and
[1:34:55] that one thing is to see established a
[1:34:57] true spiritual relationship between God
[1:35:00] and Men where in men become New
[1:35:03] Creations in Christ they are filled with
[1:35:05] his spirit and they live according to
[1:35:08] his word amen the purpose of the message
[1:35:11] was that God would fill you with the
[1:35:13] Holy Ghost but he would not just give
[1:35:15] you the baptism but he would bring you
[1:35:17] to the full restoration of the word and
[1:35:20] you would live according to the word now
[1:35:23] I believe that if we're going to have
[1:35:24] Liberty amen we have got to identify
[1:35:27] amen the source of Liberty amen I
[1:35:29] believe that our Liberty does not come
[1:35:31] from a man I don't believe our Liberty
[1:35:33] comes from a church or or a bishop or a
[1:35:35] denomination amen but I believe our
[1:35:38] Liberty comes from the message of the
[1:35:39] hour I believe that the message of the
[1:35:41] hour is amen our license amen I believe
[1:35:44] it's our license to pray I believe it's
[1:35:47] our license to cast out Devils I believe
[1:35:49] it's our license to speak in t Tong I
[1:35:52] believe it's our license to shout I
[1:35:54] believe it's our license to have prayer
[1:35:55] lines I believe it's our license to have
[1:35:58] altar calls I believe it's our license
[1:36:00] to have to have anything that go the
[1:36:02] spirit of God Amen wants in the church
[1:36:05] the message has given us a right to have
[1:36:07] it amen now in 1 John 1:1 I love what
[1:36:10] the Bible says it says that which was
[1:36:13] from the beginning which we have heard
[1:36:15] which we have seen with our eyes which
[1:36:16] we have looked upon and our hands have
[1:36:18] handled of the word of life amen for the
[1:36:20] life was manifested and we have seen it
[1:36:23] and bear witness and show unto you that
[1:36:26] eternal life which was with the father
[1:36:28] and was manifested unto us now verse
[1:36:30] three John says that which we have seen
[1:36:33] and heard amen declare we unto you that
[1:36:36] you may also have fellowship with us and
[1:36:39] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:36:41] and with his son Jesus Christ amen now
[1:36:44] John uses three very powerful words
[1:36:46] there he uses the word seen which that
[1:36:49] word seen means to see with the mou mind
[1:36:51] to see with the eyes amen this word
[1:36:53] gives prominence to the Discerning mind
[1:36:56] amen and then John uses the word heard
[1:36:59] and that word heard means not to be deaf
[1:37:01] it means to perceive amen by the ear
[1:37:03] what is announced in one's presence amen
[1:37:06] it means to learn or to give ear to a
[1:37:08] teaching or a teacher but then he comes
[1:37:10] down and uses a very powerful word he
[1:37:13] says declare amen I love this word
[1:37:15] decare because it means to Proclaim and
[1:37:18] to make known openly amen John is saying
[1:37:21] in this the things we write unto you
[1:37:23] that your joy may be full he said this
[1:37:26] then is the message which we have heard
[1:37:28] of him and declare unto you that God is
[1:37:32] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:37:35] amen I love that that word message means
[1:37:37] announcement that word message means
[1:37:39] promise so we can very well say Amen
[1:37:42] that the message is the announcement
[1:37:45] amen the message is the promise the
[1:37:47] message is the blessing amen that in God
[1:37:50] there is no Darkness in him is only
[1:37:52] light amen I love what brother says and
[1:37:54] he that is in you he said father we
[1:37:56] would ask tonight for Mercy amen for
[1:37:59] Liberty of the spirit that we might be
[1:38:01] able to bring to the people amen the
[1:38:03] gospel truth and the what we believe to
[1:38:06] be the message of the hour for your
[1:38:08] church now I'll say it like this I
[1:38:10] believe amen that we have seen the
[1:38:12] message how many can testify we have
[1:38:14] seen the message I believe we can say we
[1:38:16] have heard the message amen but I want
[1:38:18] to say we've seen it and we've heard it
[1:38:20] amen but if there's ever been a time
[1:38:22] Brother David Amen to declare it amen
[1:38:25] now is the time to declare amen the
[1:38:27] things that we have seen and the things
[1:38:29] that we've heard Isaiah said in Isaiah
[1:38:32] 48:6 he said thou has heard and see all
[1:38:35] this and will not you declare it I have
[1:38:37] showed thee new things from this time
[1:38:39] amen even hidden things and thou didst
[1:38:42] not know them in Deuteronomy 29:29 he
[1:38:46] said the secret things belong unto the
[1:38:49] Lord Our God but those things which are
[1:38:51] are revealed amen belong unto us and to
[1:38:53] our children forever amen that we may do
[1:38:56] all the words of this law amen so God
[1:38:59] here is saying in this message that he's
[1:39:01] sending to the church it's going to be
[1:39:03] more than just a it's going to be more
[1:39:05] than just scriptures it's going to be
[1:39:07] more than just quotes amen but what God
[1:39:09] is sending to the church amen is the
[1:39:12] hidden things becoming the revealed
[1:39:14] things that way you would actually
[1:39:16] become a partaker of those things that's
[1:39:19] being revealed amen I it because the
[1:39:21] prophet says in two very powerful quotes
[1:39:23] you know him by heart he said my
[1:39:25] Ministry is different right from a
[1:39:28] pastor or a teacher I'm not and if I say
[1:39:31] things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't
[1:39:33] mean to but this is my Ministry see is
[1:39:36] to declare him that he's here amen the
[1:39:39] prophet's Ministry was to declare him
[1:39:42] that he's here in anointed ones at the
[1:39:44] end time he said notice amen the very
[1:39:46] day when this messenger not when he
[1:39:48] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:39:50] his his message he's going to declare
[1:39:53] he's here but then he's going to begin
[1:39:54] to declare his message amen see the
[1:39:57] first pull was healing and the second
[1:39:59] pull was prophesied amen but the third
[1:40:02] pull was the opening of the word amen
[1:40:05] the Mysteries revealed and there's no
[1:40:07] more higher order to open or reveal the
[1:40:10] word than prophets but the only way the
[1:40:12] prophet can be Vindicated is by the word
[1:40:15] and remember that the third pull was the
[1:40:18] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[1:40:21] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[1:40:24] the word can I ask you all something
[1:40:26] amen why would God send a prophet to
[1:40:28] take the hidden things and to reveal
[1:40:31] them to the church and then say you
[1:40:33] cannot have them why would God send a
[1:40:35] prophet Amen to reveal the Thunders and
[1:40:37] reveal the seals and reveal the trumpets
[1:40:40] and reveal every symbol as he was
[1:40:42] anointed to do from The Book of
[1:40:44] Revelation and then turn and Shake but
[1:40:46] you all can't have it amen I don't
[1:40:48] believe that that's my God I believe if
[1:40:51] my God revealed it he did it for a
[1:40:53] purpose and that purpose was so somebody
[1:40:56] amen could declare the revelation of the
[1:40:59] word of God in the age they're living in
[1:41:01] listen the Baptists are declaring Noah
[1:41:04] the methodists are declaring Moses amen
[1:41:06] there's all kinds of Bible characters
[1:41:08] being declared but now's bride time amen
[1:41:11] for somebody to rise up under the
[1:41:14] liberty of the Holy Ghost and declare
[1:41:16] that God is God and His word is true and
[1:41:19] his power is real and his anointing is
[1:41:22] real and Liberty is here and deliverance
[1:41:25] is here come on I say what tonight ought
[1:41:27] to be it ought to be a night amen that
[1:41:29] Devils die I think tonight ought to be a
[1:41:31] night amen that Spirits die I think
[1:41:34] tonight ought to be a night that you say
[1:41:36] the things I've carried through 23 I
[1:41:39] refuse I refuse I refuse to carry him
[1:41:43] into 24 those things are going to die
[1:41:45] tonight because the message of the hour
[1:41:48] has given me a license to Kill them
[1:41:51] things and let God arise and his enemies
[1:41:54] be scattered and Liberty come in the
[1:41:57] church amen God has a provided way for
[1:42:00] everything right amen and God's provided
[1:42:02] way to declare his word was by prophets
[1:42:05] he said notice he wrote the Bible by his
[1:42:07] own chosen way see he chose the way his
[1:42:10] word came and that was by prophets which
[1:42:13] were predestinated and for ordained
[1:42:16] being a part of God's word declaring the
[1:42:19] revelation of his word
[1:42:21] to that age and that time I love what
[1:42:23] the prophet says here he says a Moder
[1:42:26] day Prophet is a preacher so a real true
[1:42:28] Prophet only points back to the word of
[1:42:30] the Lord amen the promise of the Lord he
[1:42:33] said not the Declaration the church has
[1:42:35] made but a declaration God has made amen
[1:42:39] see back to the word of the Lord so
[1:42:42] brother Brandon was not declaring what
[1:42:44] the church thought he was not declaring
[1:42:46] what the pope thought he was declaring
[1:42:49] what God had thought about you from
[1:42:52] before the foundation of the
[1:42:55] world now watch a Vindicated Prophet I'm
[1:42:58] going somewhere which is God's chosen
[1:43:00] way to declare his word in 1951 he said
[1:43:03] now I stand Here declaring the creator
[1:43:06] of heavens and earth is Jehovah God I
[1:43:09] claim to be a representative of his in
[1:43:12] these last days to bring Faith to his
[1:43:14] church and looking under Jesus he said
[1:43:16] in the name of Jesus Christ I take every
[1:43:19] spirit in here under under my control
[1:43:22] Amen to declare the word of God I take
[1:43:25] every spirit in here under my control to
[1:43:28] declare the word of God you say preacher
[1:43:31] why would you take such time Amen to say
[1:43:33] about declaring because church we have a
[1:43:36] responsibility amen we have a
[1:43:38] responsibility God didn't send us this
[1:43:40] message Amen to argue and debate and
[1:43:42] fuss and argue and pull apart and hack
[1:43:45] this out and put this in amen God sent
[1:43:47] us this message amen that it might help
[1:43:50] our young people people it might help
[1:43:51] our families it might help our churches
[1:43:54] and listen it's never going to help
[1:43:56] unless it's declared he say well brother
[1:43:58] Ander I'm not a preacher amen but are
[1:44:00] you a believer of it amen have you got
[1:44:03] the Holy Ghost has God saved your soul
[1:44:05] has God filled you with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:07] then you got a
[1:44:09] right you got a right to declare amen
[1:44:13] the message of the hour as the inside of
[1:44:15] this generation brother said everything
[1:44:17] is a responsibility he said and so it is
[1:44:20] easy when the responsibility faces us
[1:44:22] that we try to Sherk back from it amen
[1:44:24] and find out amen that all things are
[1:44:27] responsibility he said sometimes
[1:44:29] ministers many times they Will Sher a
[1:44:31] responsibility amen for standing for the
[1:44:33] true word of God when they're confronted
[1:44:36] with it they'll Sher that responsibility
[1:44:38] but when the truth of the word of God is
[1:44:40] brought face to face with we human
[1:44:42] beings we are prone to Sherk back until
[1:44:45] the last resource another place you said
[1:44:47] before the church can ever be taken to
[1:44:49] Glory it has has to go through this
[1:44:51] world of criticism amen it has to go
[1:44:54] through this world of criticism now we
[1:44:56] can all agree we we don't like criticism
[1:44:59] amen but can I tell you like the prophet
[1:45:01] said he said I don't like tubless tires
[1:45:03] but they're here to stay he said I don't
[1:45:05] like half-dressed women but they're here
[1:45:07] to stay and brother said like this he
[1:45:09] said we got to go through the criticism
[1:45:12] before we hang in the Hall of Fame amen
[1:45:14] and sometimes we try to pull back amen
[1:45:17] because we're afraid of some criticism
[1:45:19] what can I tell you if if you're waiting
[1:45:21] on there to be no critics if you're
[1:45:23] waiting on there to be no criticism
[1:45:25] before you do anything for God you're
[1:45:27] going to sit there and miss the greatest
[1:45:29] opportunity that has ever been given to
[1:45:32] do something listen there always will be
[1:45:34] critics but I'll tell you what the
[1:45:36] critics are going to do they're going to
[1:45:37] criticize I tell you what the scoffers
[1:45:40] are going to do they're going to scoff
[1:45:42] I'll tell you what the unbelievers are
[1:45:43] going to do they're going to unbelief
[1:45:45] I'll tell you what the make Believers
[1:45:46] are going to do they're going to make
[1:45:48] believe but I'll tell you what the
[1:45:49] Believers are going to do do they're
[1:45:51] going to believe I tell you what the
[1:45:53] worshippers are going to do they're
[1:45:54] going to worship I tell you what the
[1:45:56] praisers are going to do they're going
[1:45:58] to praise I tell you what the singers
[1:46:00] are going to do they're going to sing I
[1:46:02] tell you what the preachers are going to
[1:46:03] do they're going to preach I tell you
[1:46:05] what the shouters are going to do
[1:46:07] they're going to shout amen because they
[1:46:09] have been put on the earth to declare
[1:46:12] the revelation of the word for the age
[1:46:15] they're living
[1:46:17] in we have a responsibility to declare
[1:46:21] Paul says I have not shunned to declare
[1:46:24] unto you amen all the counsel of God I
[1:46:27] haven't lost my thought amen God was
[1:46:29] speaking through Paul and he was
[1:46:31] revealing some things and he said now
[1:46:33] Paul when you begin to declare it don't
[1:46:36] you just declare what you want
[1:46:38] to don't you just declare what will keep
[1:46:41] you out of criticism don't you just
[1:46:44] declare what everybody wants to hear but
[1:46:46] when you begin to declare the things I
[1:46:48] reveal you declare all the counsel of
[1:46:51] God you know what the counsel of God is
[1:46:53] the Bible says the counsel of God is the
[1:46:56] purpose of God so Paul was saying I have
[1:46:59] not shunned to declare the purpose of
[1:47:02] God Amen that word shunn means to draw
[1:47:04] back it means to let down it means to
[1:47:07] withdraw it is of a timid person to
[1:47:09] withdraw oneself it means to to cover of
[1:47:13] those who from timoy they hesitate to
[1:47:16] avow what they believe it means to be
[1:47:18] unwilling to utter from fear to shrink
[1:47:21] from declaring to conceal or to
[1:47:24] dissemble amen I want to say this there
[1:47:26] is nothing that can defeat the purpose
[1:47:29] of God there is nothing that can defeat
[1:47:32] the purpose of God in your life there is
[1:47:35] nothing can defeat the purpose of God in
[1:47:37] this church the prophet said woe unto me
[1:47:40] if I don't declare this counsel of God
[1:47:42] the people of his healing power and he
[1:47:45] is here amen Christ the son of God is
[1:47:49] here to heal the sick and the needy
[1:47:51] friends I believe he's here tonight I
[1:47:53] believe he's here to heal I believe he's
[1:47:55] here to save I believe he's here to
[1:47:58] deliver I believe he's here to answer
[1:48:00] questions I believe he's here to give a
[1:48:02] refilling of the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:48:04] he's here in the power of his
[1:48:06] resurrection to do exactly what his word
[1:48:09] said he would do now when the word
[1:48:11] Prophet comes on the scene and he begins
[1:48:13] to declare things about God he's going
[1:48:15] to declare God's attitude towards you
[1:48:18] brother said it very beautifully he said
[1:48:20] I told them that you love them and you
[1:48:22] got the same respect for them that you
[1:48:25] did for that woman that night many years
[1:48:27] ago what he's speaking of Amen is the
[1:48:30] worst sinner in the city he's speaking
[1:48:32] of a man who held a party and invited
[1:48:35] Jesus and when he got there amen he
[1:48:37] wouldn't entertain him but there was a
[1:48:39] woman there that was willing to be
[1:48:41] criticized there was a woman there that
[1:48:44] was willing to be made fun of brother
[1:48:45] Carrie there was a woman there that was
[1:48:47] willing to be kicked aside but she knew
[1:48:50] who he was and she was not ashamed by
[1:48:53] her actions to declare that this is the
[1:48:55] Messiah that this is the god that can
[1:48:58] save me from my sin he can forgive me of
[1:49:01] my iniquity oh church tonight I pray
[1:49:03] there's never one service that that God
[1:49:06] walks in the building and he's sitting
[1:49:07] in the corner with dirty feet I pray
[1:49:10] somebody would get up and they would go
[1:49:12] over and find him and by their actions
[1:49:14] they would declare he is the Messiah he
[1:49:17] is the savior he is the Healer he is is
[1:49:20] the restorer he is the anointed one he
[1:49:23] is the mighty conqueror he is the
[1:49:25] Messiah he is my
[1:49:28] god brother B said he cannot be a Healer
[1:49:31] once and not a Healer again he cannot be
[1:49:33] a god of Miracles one day and not a god
[1:49:35] of Miracles the next day he's the same
[1:49:38] yesterday today and forever he's still
[1:49:41] God and if you'll take the right mental
[1:49:43] attitude towards any promise when you
[1:49:46] read it in the Bible it's the truth no
[1:49:48] matter how many tries to put it in
[1:49:50] another age it's in the past or it's an
[1:49:52] age in the future he never did declare
[1:49:55] amen that he was the I was or he's the I
[1:49:58] I will be he always declared himself as
[1:50:02] the I am as the I am see then I love how
[1:50:06] that when Paul amen I pray this is okay
[1:50:09] when Paul writes to Timothy he says
[1:50:11] three very powerful and and and straight
[1:50:13] words to Timothy he says preach the word
[1:50:16] am me can we say that together preach
[1:50:18] the word he said preach the word you be
[1:50:21] instant in season out of season you
[1:50:23] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:50:26] longsuffering and Doctrine now that word
[1:50:28] preach means to Proclaim after the
[1:50:30] manner of a Herald it is always with the
[1:50:33] suggestion of formality gravity and
[1:50:36] Authority which must be listened to and
[1:50:38] obeyed Amen to preach means to publish
[1:50:41] it means to Proclaim openly amen
[1:50:44] something which has been done Amen
[1:50:46] brother said we ministers we have orders
[1:50:49] from you Lord and that is preach the
[1:50:51] word amen that's why we call us Full
[1:50:53] Gospel preachers is we preach the whole
[1:50:55] word the whole counsel of God listen I
[1:50:59] say thank God that there's a Ministry in
[1:51:01] the last days that's got the courage and
[1:51:03] the guts Amen to take the gloves off and
[1:51:06] not declare the part of the message they
[1:51:08] like or the part of the message they
[1:51:10] think is important but they will declare
[1:51:12] 47 to 65 they will declare Holiness they
[1:51:16] will declare Revelation they will
[1:51:18] declare correction will declare
[1:51:20] encouragement come on Church y'all know
[1:51:22] I'm telling the truth we're living in a
[1:51:24] day and time hey when we're men don't
[1:51:26] want to preach the message they just
[1:51:28] want to get up and tell a story oh God
[1:51:31] or just or just water it down amen but
[1:51:34] I'm going to say something you'll never
[1:51:36] help the church as long as you're
[1:51:37] playing with this
[1:51:39] message as long as you're adding to and
[1:51:42] taken away and hacking here and hacking
[1:51:45] there and well brother brandham didn't
[1:51:46] mean this and brother Bram didn't mean
[1:51:48] that and now I'm going to tell you oh
[1:51:50] god well I might as well preach I'm here
[1:51:52] I'm going to tell you what we need in
[1:51:53] the church and what we don't need in the
[1:51:55] church amen and God oh God help me he
[1:51:58] and guys literally get up and they
[1:52:00] devalue the message to promote the
[1:52:02] message you know what I say I say if you
[1:52:04] ain't going to say what a prophet said
[1:52:06] sit down and let somebody up that will
[1:52:09] if you ain't going to preach this
[1:52:10] message in the power and the authority
[1:52:13] and the gravity and the anointing that
[1:52:16] it was delivered to sit down and let
[1:52:18] somebody that will because we got people
[1:52:21] that need help we got people that need

[1:57:56] is in the spirit of the Lord is amen
[1:57:59] there is Liberty amen I've heard people

[1:58:03] people say well amen people go to that
[1:58:05] church because they do things the way
[1:58:06] they like to do they go to that church
[1:58:09] because they act the way they like to
[1:58:10] act have you ever thought that people go
[1:58:13] to a church because where the spirit of
[1:58:15] the Lord is there is
[1:58:18] Liberty ever thought amen that people's
[1:58:21] tired of religion amen they're tired of
[1:58:23] tradition they're tired of formality
[1:58:26] they're tired of man's ideas they're
[1:58:28] tired of opinions they're ready to get
[1:58:30] somewhere where they can have some Elbow
[1:58:32] Room they're ready to get somewhere
[1:58:35] where the Holy Ghost can break out and
[1:58:37] if they feel like weeping they can weep
[1:58:39] if they feel like running they can
[1:58:41] run come on CH where the spirit of the
[1:58:45] Lord
[1:58:46] is come on where the spirit of the the
[1:58:49] Lord is not where the spirit of the Lord
[1:58:52] was or where the spirit of the Lord will
[1:58:54] be where the spirit of the Lord is there
[1:58:58] is Liberty where the spirit of the Lord
[1:59:01] is there is Liberty well I believe that
[1:59:04] Liberty is here tonight because the
[1:59:06] spirit of the Lord is
[1:59:09] here oh glory to God Amen I believe it I
[1:59:13] believe that when that Revelation broke
[1:59:15] amen a prophet begin to see that there
[1:59:17] is a truth in the in the fundamentals
[1:59:19] there's a truth in the Pentecostals I
[1:59:21] believe when he begin to see that
[1:59:22] Revelation and he began to declare that
[1:59:24] Revelation he could not hold back you
[1:59:27] say he cannot hold back no because Amos
[1:59:29] 3 says that the line has roared and who
[1:59:32] can but prophesy amen listen just as
[1:59:35] Jesus could not hold back on the
[1:59:38] Revelation amen the Bride of Jesus
[1:59:40] Christ his disciples cannot hold back
[1:59:43] neither amen I love this in Matthew
[1:59:45] 13:11 Jesus said it is given unto you to
[1:59:48] know the Mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:59:50] heaven but to them it is not given said
[1:59:53] I've come here for the purpose of
[1:59:54] teaching amen the last vows and the last
[1:59:57] seven trumpets and the last seven
[1:59:59] thunders of the Book of Revelation amen
[2:00:01] tying them together in this hour that
[2:00:03] we're now living to follow the opening
[2:00:05] of The Seven Seals the seven Church ages
[2:00:08] but in this now I took this opportunity
[2:00:10] to express to the people my belief and
[2:00:12] faith in God and bringing you to the
[2:00:15] hour that we're living in and by this
[2:00:18] it's not appointed to any certain person
[2:00:20] any Creed or whatever it might be it's
[2:00:22] just as I see God's word see because
[2:00:26] Jesus said he could not hold nothing
[2:00:28] back from his disciples you are the
[2:00:31] Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:00:34] Jesus now can I say this to you Jesus
[2:00:37] did not give his disciples amen private
[2:00:41] interpretation the Bible says amen
[2:00:44] knowing this verse that no prophecy of
[2:00:46] this scripture is of any private
[2:00:48] interpret ation can I show you what this
[2:00:50] word prophecy means it is a discourse
[2:00:53] amen that is emanating from divine
[2:00:55] inspiration and declaring the purposes
[2:00:58] of God Amen so prophecy amen is coming
[2:01:01] from the Divine mind declaring the
[2:01:04] purpose of God brother said watch amen
[2:01:07] see when that Spirit begins to move now
[2:01:09] watch here this word interpretation very
[2:01:11] beautiful word you all know brother
[2:01:13] preaches God interprets his own word
[2:01:15] right he says how does God interpret his
[2:01:17] word by bringing his word to pass can I
[2:01:20] tell you what the word interpretation
[2:01:22] means in the in the Greek it means a
[2:01:24] loosening or un loosen so when something
[2:01:27] is interpreted it has the power to
[2:01:30] loosen it has the power to unloose it
[2:01:33] has the power to rebuke the restraints
[2:01:35] it has the power to give Liberty now
[2:01:38] watch this because private
[2:01:39] interpretation you know where it comes
[2:01:41] from it comes from Eve's interpreter
[2:01:44] which was The Serpent and you know what
[2:01:46] private interpretation does it binds the
[2:01:48] church it binds the praise it binds the
[2:01:51] response it binds the amen it binds the
[2:01:55] faith it binds the young people I tell
[2:01:57] you what it is it's a spirit of private
[2:01:59] interpretation y'all get mad at me if
[2:02:01] you want you but I'm going to say it it
[2:02:03] come from the pits of hell and it does
[2:02:05] not belong in a message
[2:02:08] Church it come from the pits of hell and
[2:02:11] it does not belong in a message Church
[2:02:13] there is no room in a message church for
[2:02:16] private interpretation but there is room
[2:02:18] for true interpretation because true
[2:02:21] interpretation it comes from the spirit
[2:02:23] of Truth and when it comes in the church
[2:02:26] it loosens the church now you all know
[2:02:28] that Mark 16 amen says these words it
[2:02:31] says they shall go in my name and they
[2:02:33] shall cast out Devils I'm turning the
[2:02:35] corner now they'll go out in my name and
[2:02:38] my name they shall cast out Devils
[2:02:40] brother said they cast out the devil is
[2:02:43] the preaching of the Gospel yeah the
[2:02:46] preaching of the Gospel is the casting
[2:02:49] out of the
[2:02:51] devil oh
[2:02:53] God that's why the devil fights the
[2:02:56] preaching don't get mad at me amen but
[2:02:59] you go to church go to church on your
[2:03:00] midweek service and come in and sit down
[2:03:03] and let them start singing amen you
[2:03:05] don't fight to stay awake during the
[2:03:07] singing you don't fight to stay awake
[2:03:09] during the singing amen but when the
[2:03:11] word goes to being preached am come on
[2:03:14] church when the singing's going on you
[2:03:16] don't sit there and say well I wonder
[2:03:17] what I didn't do at work and I got to do
[2:03:18] this tomorrow when I go back no but when
[2:03:20] the word Goes Forth the devil tries to
[2:03:22] get your mind on every kind of every
[2:03:24] kind of track he can get it on you know
[2:03:26] why because he knows that if fat word
[2:03:29] connects with fat seed in your soul he's
[2:03:32] lost his hold over your life because the
[2:03:35] preaching of the word is the casting out
[2:03:38] of the devil come on brother B said
[2:03:40] Music cast out evil spirits so that
[2:03:42] music is pushing against those evil
[2:03:44] spirits but when the preacher begins to
[2:03:46] preach and he begins to lay that word
[2:03:48] out out there that's not the time Amen
[2:03:51] to change your filter and try to filter
[2:03:53] it through this private interpretation
[2:03:55] filter it through that private
[2:03:56] interpretation that's the time to say
[2:03:58] Lord I'm sick and tired of living bound
[2:04:01] I'm tired of living under what man
[2:04:03] thinks and man says and man told I'm
[2:04:06] ready to come back to the landmark to
[2:04:08] the homeland of the church the message
[2:04:11] of the
[2:04:12] hour so when you begin to preach the
[2:04:15] word you know what happens the devil's
[2:04:17] cast out so you can believe the word
[2:04:20] amen you know what preaching is it's
[2:04:21] spiritual warfare preaching is spiritual
[2:04:24] warfare but can I say this thank God for
[2:04:27] some preachers that get in spiritual
[2:04:29] warfare but they don't
[2:04:32] quit brother Ray's been in it for many
[2:04:35] years and he hasn't quit he hasn't laid
[2:04:38] his sword down are you hearing me church
[2:04:40] because they believe there's a Cause
[2:04:42] worth fighting for they'll fight through
[2:04:44] tightness they'll fight through unbelief
[2:04:46] they'll preach through well I'm old
[2:04:49] preacher I'm old bust they'll fight
[2:04:51] through every devil trying to pray him
[2:04:53] and choke on their words but they'll
[2:04:55] stand there and they'll lay that word
[2:04:56] out they'll preach that word because
[2:04:59] they know that if that word connects
[2:05:01] with your soul it'll change your life
[2:05:05] forever I get a witness here tonight
[2:05:08] that can say thank God Amen that
[2:05:10] somebody preached the word thank God
[2:05:13] that somebody declared the message thank
[2:05:15] God that somebody stood there and said
[2:05:17] there's not a devil big enough there's
[2:05:19] not a spirit strong enough to stop God
[2:05:22] from delivering me in my
[2:05:25] situation Hallelujah you say brother
[2:05:28] anderw is it easy it's not easy but we

[2:10:37] of the
[2:10:38] people come on y'all know what I'm
[2:10:40] talking about when they took the stone
[2:10:42] away over Jesus tomb you know what that
[2:10:44] meant it was time for Resurrection when
[2:10:46] they took the stone away from Lazarus
[2:10:49] grave Brother Ray at meant it was time
[2:10:50] for resurrection and here's a oh God
[2:10:53] here's a prophet of the Resurrection
[2:10:56] sign and he's standing in the pull pit
[2:10:59] and brother brother Jeremy is saying
[2:11:00] these words may the same angel of God
[2:11:03] that was there on Easter morning may he
[2:11:05] come in this building tonight and may He
[2:11:07] roll away the stone of fear the stone of
[2:11:10] unbelief the stone of Discord off of the
[2:11:13] heart of every believer that they can
[2:11:15] see that Jesus Christ lives and Reigns
[2:11:18] and his power I'm just going to preach
[2:11:19] on this one stone for a little bit
[2:11:21] before I close if that's okay it's
[2:11:23] called the stone of
[2:11:25] fear it's called the stone of fear you
[2:11:28] know what Paul said he said I have not
[2:11:30] shined to declare unto you all the
[2:11:32] counsel of God that word shined means to
[2:11:34] be unwilling to utter from
[2:11:37] Fear right to shine something means
[2:11:41] you're unwilling to utter the truth
[2:11:44] because of fear brother B said this one
[2:11:46] of the greatest curses on the church
[2:11:48] today is fear everybody is scared to
[2:11:50] death everything is what's going to
[2:11:52] happen who what another place he said
[2:11:55] the greatest thing I find against the
[2:11:56] church tonight is fear everybody is
[2:11:58] scared to death about something what are
[2:12:01] you scared about if a man is born again
[2:12:04] he should be
[2:12:07] happy come on I'm not backing up I'm not
[2:12:09] afraid of that spirit of fear if a man
[2:12:12] is born again he should be happy he
[2:12:14] should be carefree just like the fellow
[2:12:16] singing up here and the testifying back
[2:12:19] there just free there ain't nothing can
[2:12:22] harm you nothing present nothing future
[2:12:25] and there's nothing can separate us from
[2:12:28] the love of God that's in
[2:12:31] Christ Oh Glory to God we ought to be
[2:12:34] happy and we ought to be carefree I said
[2:12:37] we ought to be happy and we ought to be
[2:12:40] carefree we ought to be happy and we
[2:12:43] ought to be carefree you say well
[2:12:45] brother Andrew I'm not happy and I'm not
[2:12:47] care free well declare war on everything
[2:12:51] that's causing you not to be happy and
[2:12:53] not to be carefree God did not save you
[2:12:56] to bind you God did not bring you into
[2:12:59] this message to put you on a Pew and put
[2:13:01] Shackles on your hands and Shackles on
[2:13:03] your feet and Shackles on your faith and
[2:13:06] Shackles on your family and Shackles on
[2:13:08] the anointing I think if anybody ought
[2:13:10] to be free it ought to be the Bride of
[2:13:13] Jesus
[2:13:15] Christ I think it's time to be happy
[2:13:19] come I think it's time to be carefree I
[2:13:21] know what I'm talking about right now
[2:13:22] amen Carefree is when you didn't
[2:13:25] care testing one two it's still working
[2:13:28] Carefree is when you didn't care you
[2:13:30] remember when you used to when you first
[2:13:32] got saved and you didn't care to raise
[2:13:34] your hands you didn't care to say Amen
[2:13:37] you didn't care to worship you didn't
[2:13:38] care to praise you didn't care to holler
[2:13:41] you didn't you didn't care about
[2:13:42] anything you were just Carefree you were
[2:13:45] just so happy to be in the house of God
[2:13:48] God one more time but then something
[2:13:50] happened and something happened and this
[2:13:52] happened and before long care begin to
[2:13:55] pile up on
[2:13:59] care y'all some of y'all here have been
[2:14:01] to New Zealand several years ago I think
[2:14:03] it was I can't if it's our first trip
[2:14:04] brother Isaac or the second trip but I
[2:14:06] was in New Zealand and I was with some
[2:14:08] brothers and we were walking down the
[2:14:10] street and brother Wayne there was a
[2:14:11] there was a couple people walking down
[2:14:13] through there just just just citizens
[2:14:15] and brother Ray they're walking through
[2:14:16] there and it would be it would not even
[2:14:18] be appropriate for me to describe in a
[2:14:20] church what them people look like it was
[2:14:22] unbelievable what they were wearing and
[2:14:24] the way they was acting and I looked at
[2:14:26] the brothers with me and I said is this
[2:14:28] normal I mean I know I'm from
[2:14:31] America but is this normal I mean look
[2:14:35] at this and one brother looked at me he
[2:14:37] said oh brother Andrew he said yeah he
[2:14:38] said that's normal he said but we call
[2:14:40] them that don't care no
[2:14:42] more and I said the what he said oh we
[2:14:46] call them that don't care no more he
[2:14:48] said they've gone so far that they don't
[2:14:50] care what Society thinks about them they
[2:14:52] don't care what their family thinks
[2:14:53] about them they don't care what anybody
[2:14:55] thinks about them they just don't care
[2:14:57] no more I said you mean they don't care
[2:14:59] what somebody thinks about them when
[2:15:01] they come out of the house looking like
[2:15:02] that he said no brother they were there
[2:15:04] that don't care no more I said so you
[2:15:06] mean to tell me that they've come to a
[2:15:08] place in their life that they've crossed
[2:15:10] a line between caring and not caring he
[2:15:13] said brother that's the best way I know
[2:15:14] how to say it I thought oh God if that's
[2:15:17] in the natural if the devil from
[2:15:21] Hell if all hell can be turned loose and
[2:15:25] demon powers come streaming up on the
[2:15:27] people change the way they look change
[2:15:29] the way they marry change the way they
[2:15:31] dress change the way they talk change
[2:15:34] the way they conduct themselves and
[2:15:35] brother Ray they cross a line that they
[2:15:37] don't care no more then what about the
[2:15:40] Bride of Jesus
[2:15:42] Christ I said what about the Bride of
[2:15:44] Jesus Christ if hell I said if hell can
[2:15:49] influence them not to care no more and
[2:15:53] what about the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:15:55] when the seventh seal come open it
[2:15:57] brought Christ back to Earth again and
[2:16:00] there's a bride on the earth tonight she
[2:16:02] don't care no more she don't care what
[2:16:04] you think about her she don't care what
[2:16:06] you think about her praise she don't
[2:16:08] care what you think about her worship
[2:16:10] because she has been
[2:16:14] liberated she's
[2:16:16] free
[2:16:18] I said she's free I said she's free I
[2:16:22] think it's time to get free

[2:16:48] care what they
[2:16:49] say I don't care what they think I am
[2:16:53] who I am by the grace of
[2:16:56] God I might as well go ahead and say it
[2:16:58] I am a Son of God that's been saved
[2:17:02] that's been redeemed that's been filled
[2:17:04] with the Holy Ghost I'm following the
[2:17:06] message of the hour the pillar of fire
[2:17:08] is my headship heaven is my home the
[2:17:11] Rapture is my goal the devil is my enemy
[2:17:14] and there's nothing you can say there's
[2:17:17] nothing you can do to put this bride
[2:17:19] back under bondage again to
[2:17:22] fear we don't care no more well we don't
[2:17:25] care no more but I might as well preach
[2:17:28] I'm here we don't care no more we have
[2:17:30] heard from our theophany we have heard
[2:17:32] from that other dimension we have heard
[2:17:35] from that other side and there's
[2:17:36] something in us that believes more over
[2:17:39] there than we believe here we believe
[2:17:42] it's more real over there than it is
[2:17:45] here brother Chuck we believe that
[2:17:47] Dimension is more real than this
[2:17:49] Dimension sister Debbie we believe that
[2:17:51] Dimension is more closer than this
[2:17:54] Dimension listen friends we don't care
[2:17:56] no more we don't care what they think
[2:17:58] about our preaching we don't care what
[2:18:00] they think about our Doctrine we believe
[2:18:02] the message and we're not
[2:18:06] ashamed we're not ashamed to declare it
[2:18:10] now I want say this to you said Oh my he
[2:18:14] said see fear not Jesus said over and
[2:18:15] over fear not now it rebukes the spirit
[2:18:18] of fear by the word and says you've not
[2:18:22] received the spirit of bondage again to
[2:18:25] fear but youve received the spirit of
[2:18:30] adoption brother BR said then he died
[2:18:32] and sent back the Holy Spirit and said
[2:18:33] the church take this and fight with it
[2:18:34] and follow
[2:18:36] me are you ready for this the greatest
[2:18:39] weapon was ever put in the hands of man
[2:18:42] is the
[2:18:43] Bible to be backed up with the Holy
[2:18:46] Ghost that Christ died at Calvary to
[2:18:49] free his church from
[2:18:53] superstitions and
[2:18:55] fear and doubt and trembling praise God
[2:19:00] can I say this fear is
[2:19:03] real but it's
[2:19:07] defeated fear is
[2:19:09] real but it's
[2:19:11] defeated fear is a spirit it's real but
[2:19:16] it's defeated
[2:19:20] I'm declaring what I seen and what I
[2:19:21] heard fear is real fear is a spirit but
[2:19:26] it's defeated y'all know what fear is
[2:19:29] fear is an
[2:19:30] Intimidator and a
[2:19:32] manipulator in other words what fear
[2:19:35] does is fear comes in and begins to
[2:19:38] intimidate you which then when it backs
[2:19:40] you down and gets intimidated then it
[2:19:43] begins to manipulate
[2:19:46] you if it comes in and scares you and
[2:19:50] intimidates you and get you to be
[2:19:52] unwilling to utter from Fear right what
[2:19:55] you should be declaring and so you start
[2:19:58] backing up and drawing back and it gets
[2:20:00] you intimidated and then it begins to
[2:20:03] manipulate you can I prove it to you
[2:20:05] amen look at Co yeah don't get mad at me
[2:20:09] I believe Co was real but I believe the
[2:20:11] spirit of fear was more real than the
[2:20:13] germ
[2:20:14] was I believe the fear that followed Co
[2:20:17] was more real than the actual germ y'all
[2:20:20] know what I'm talking about because we
[2:20:22] was all living Our Lives we was doing
[2:20:24] our daily activities living our lives
[2:20:26] and then all of a sudden somewhere we
[2:20:28] heard a report that there's a virus
[2:20:30] broke out in a foreign country and it's
[2:20:32] possibly coming to America and oh my we
[2:20:36] weren't afraid of it you know it's just
[2:20:38] another scare and then it actually
[2:20:40] showed
[2:20:41] up and it actually showed up and it be
[2:20:44] to intimidate people and they begin to
[2:20:46] change
[2:20:47] change oh come on now they begin to
[2:20:51] change now now I'm I'm I'm I'm preaching
[2:20:53] here with some Grace cuz we had to amen
[2:20:55] but y'all know I'm telling the truth we
[2:20:57] never went to Walmart with three masks
[2:20:58] on our
[2:21:01] face we never put JX and all of our cars
[2:21:04] well maybe me and David Tyler we never
[2:21:08] are you hearing me we never done these
[2:21:13] things are you hearing
[2:21:16] me
[2:21:19] but it begin to intimidate and then it
[2:21:21] begin to manipulate and then then it
[2:21:25] begin to change the way we done things
[2:21:28] because it was a spirit of fear now I
[2:21:30] might as well just goad and say it since
[2:21:31] I'm this close to it it manipulated our
[2:21:33] way of life it kept us away from church
[2:21:36] it put us six feet apart it put us in in
[2:21:39] Corry in quarantine it did all kinds of
[2:21:42] things it was a it was a manipulator and
[2:21:45] an Intimidator but I want to close the
[2:21:47] on this right here just as much as I
[2:21:49] believe there's a natural fear in the
[2:21:51] last days I believe there's a spiritual
[2:21:54] fear that's broke out around the church
[2:21:56] Living God and it's a fear of brother
[2:21:58] Andrew we better be careful we're going
[2:22:00] to get out of balance we better be
[2:22:02] careful we're going to get out of the
[2:22:03] middle of the road we better be careful
[2:22:06] because so and so taught this about the
[2:22:08] seventh seal so don't nobody teach
[2:22:10] nothing about the seventh seal and
[2:22:12] brother so and so taught this about his
[2:22:14] presence so don't nobody teach this
[2:22:16] about is PR but I'm feeling good now and
[2:22:20] so and so talk this about the godhead so
[2:22:22] don't nobody touch the godhead and
[2:22:24] before long that Spirit has intimidated
[2:22:28] and it's manipulated and it's changed
[2:22:30] our way of preaching it's changed our
[2:22:32] way of
[2:22:33] teaching it's a spirit of fear from the
[2:22:36] pits of Hell well I might as well go
[2:22:38] ahead and bump the other devil well
[2:22:40] brother be careful cuz if the Holy Ghost
[2:22:42] gets to move and and somebody gets to
[2:22:44] shout oh they may get out of line they
[2:22:46] may get out out of order that's a spirit
[2:22:48] of fear that's trying to change the way
[2:22:50] we have
[2:22:52] church I said that's a spirit of fear
[2:22:55] it's trying to change the way we worship
[2:22:57] trying to change the way we praise and
[2:22:59] so people get bound up in their Spirit
[2:23:02] Well I'm afraid if I raise my hands they
[2:23:04] may think I'm this or if I say Amen they
[2:23:07] may think I'm this or if I go to the
[2:23:09] altar they may think this but can I say
[2:23:11] this tonight fear is
[2:23:15] defeated we will not live in fear we
[2:23:18] will not let natural fear spiritual fear
[2:23:22] Church fear we'll not let fear
[2:23:26] intimidate and manipulate Our Lives

[2:28:08] Ray the devil done what he wanted to
[2:28:13] do Jesus left his disciples
[2:28:17] they got on the ship to go across the
[2:28:20] sea and when they went across the sea a
[2:28:23] storm Rose brother said the wind become
[2:28:26] contrary now I'm not making something
[2:28:28] out of this but I just think it's
[2:28:29] amazing brother said the wind become
[2:28:31] contrary in Ephesians 4 he said they're
[2:28:33] cre about with every wind of
[2:28:37] Doctrine and they're sailing across the
[2:28:40] sea and all of a sudden the storm is is
[2:28:43] brewing the wind is blowing the rain is
[2:28:45] falling the wind everything is contrary
[2:28:48] and then all of a sudden brother Nathan
[2:28:50] they look up and come walking on the
[2:28:52] water and they say it's a
[2:28:55] spirit yeah the spirit of fear was in
[2:29:00] the
[2:29:02] boat and got them so afraid they're
[2:29:06] going to the bottom brother Carrie
[2:29:08] they're on their way down they need help
[2:29:11] and the only thing that could help him
[2:29:14] is now walking on the water and they're
[2:29:17] looking at it and they're scared to
[2:29:18] death of
[2:29:19] it they're looking at their only help
[2:29:23] and they're saying it's a spirit they're
[2:29:25] afraid amen but can I say this then
[2:29:28] Jesus
[2:29:29] spoke then Jesus spoke and you know what
[2:29:32] he said he said be of good cheer it is I
[2:29:37] Be not
[2:29:38] [Applause]
[2:29:41] Afraid brother Wayne the way he rebuked
[2:29:44] the fear was he declared he
[2:29:48] here the way he rebuked the fear was he
[2:29:51] said my Ministry is different from the
[2:29:54] pastor it's different from the
[2:29:55] Evangelist my Ministry is to declare him
[2:29:58] he's here Jesus didn't walk on the water
[2:30:01] and say it was I or it will be I he said

[2:30:25] the message walking on water and the
[2:30:27] devil gets in the boat and says it's a
[2:30:29] rocket ship it's a false opinion he's a
[2:30:32] plagiarist he didn't tell the truth he
[2:30:35] missed it here he missed it there and

[2:42:55] not a man it's him Heavenly Father Lord
[2:42:58] all across this building tonight are
[2:43:00] believers
[2:43:01] Lord father no matter how long we've
[2:43:03] been serving you how many years we've
[2:43:06] been in the position that you placed Us
[2:43:08] in in the church or as a lay member Lord
[2:43:12] where everyone where everyone subject
[2:43:15] sometimes to battle demons and spirits
[2:43:18] of fear and doubt they try to creep in
[2:43:21] through situations they try to creep in
[2:43:23] through problems they try to creep in
[2:43:25] through little things the devil throws
[2:43:27] our way and fear tries to creep out of
[2:43:30] it Lord father just as we just a few
[2:43:33] short years ago now seems like forever
[2:43:35] ago but it just was just a few years ago
[2:43:39] Lord when that virus broke out in our
[2:43:41] land and Lord I know that that was real
[2:43:44] we're not we're not into conspiracies
[2:43:46] and those things here tonight Lord we
[2:43:47] believe it was real but Lord we believe
[2:43:50] the spirit of fear that followed it was
[2:43:52] real too and Lord we've seen that spirit
[2:43:54] of fear begin to move into churches and
[2:43:58] begin to intimidate manipulate and try
[2:44:00] to destroy flocks and separate Shepherds
[2:44:03] from their flocks but Lord here we are
[2:44:05] four years later nearly and we're still
[2:44:08] standing we're still believing because
[2:44:10] Lord fear is defeated now Lord that was
[2:44:14] in the natural but as we move on in time
[2:44:17] and journey on towards the Rapture we're
[2:44:20] dealing with more spiritual fear than we
[2:44:21] are natural fear Lord I remember as a
[2:44:24] young preacher just starting out on the
[2:44:26] field and Lord such a such a pressure
