[17:00] [Music]
[17:04] we we've not we've not quit preaching to

[17:12] was just hearing brother brown preach
[17:14] about a message the conference
[17:16] and he says that in the front of it you
[17:18] can look this quote up and he said
[17:19] there's a man setting there'd been a big
[17:21] conference in europe and he said i was
[17:23] sitting listening to the radio waiting
[17:25] for the results of the conference
[17:28] and i thought isn't that something we've
[17:29] had a camp meeting our young people and
[17:31] so tonight you get to hear the results
[17:34] of the conference of what the lord's
[17:36] done and and you know there's a uh
[17:39] we preached on milk honey and giants
[17:40] here for a while and on those milk honey
[17:43] and giants y'all remember we showed
[17:45] there's a giant in every land
[17:47] and whenever you have a camp meeting or
[17:50] you have young people you have some
[17:52] somebody's always there's some kind of a
[17:54] giant some issue
[17:56] that comes up among all of that but you
[17:58] got to remember that the milk and honey
[18:00] is worth
[18:01] every giant you find
[18:03] to have camp meetings youth meetings and
[18:05] tonight what you get to hear
[18:07] is the testimonies of caleb and joshua

[33:45] not going to take much time
[33:47] uh we want to hear what god

[33:52] so in psalms 42
[33:55] a couple of verses there
[33:58] also i want to
[34:00] as a church thank the mcnulty family
[34:03] for all the laborers and the people that
[34:05] helped them
[34:06] and uh it was wonderful going there
[34:08] sunday evening having fellowship
[34:11] having something to eat
[34:12] even the bus from louisiana stopped
[34:14] there
[34:15] amen and
[34:17] wow the parking lot was full but we
[34:20] enjoyed ourselves and
[34:23] incidentally
[34:24] brother aaron oglesby i know we're going
[34:27] to have testimonies tonight i don't
[34:29] i happened to tune in a little
[34:33] last night to uh their meeting
[34:36] and brother oglesby was giving his
[34:38] testimony
[34:39] felt like god
[34:41] touched him
[34:42] right in this prayer he's had a medical
[34:44] problem for two three years i think
[34:46] and uh in the prayer line
[34:49] he was helping with the prayer line but
[34:52] he was he looked over towards the front
[34:54] of it
[34:56] where brother wayne and brother aaron
[34:57] were our brother andrew and he was
[35:00] waiting for the next one to come and
[35:01] brother andrew
[35:03] made a direct
[35:05] look at him said i think he said it's
[35:07] over by the aaron it's over
[35:10] so he's accepting that
[35:12] amen i don't know what i don't even know
[35:14] the name of the disease that they told
[35:16] them he had but i say to god be the
[35:18] glory
[35:19] let's read as the heart
[35:22] panted after the water brooks
[35:24] so panic my soul after thee o god
[35:27] my soul thirsted for god for the living
[35:30] god
[35:31] when shall i come
[35:33] and appear
[35:34] before god i want to emphasize
[35:37] that's why we serve a living god amen in
[35:41] ii
[35:42] corinthians chapter 3 verse 6.
[35:46] if you want to go there
[35:50] just one verse there chapter verse 6 who
[35:53] also
[35:54] had made us able ministers of the new
[35:57] testament
[35:58] not the letter
[36:00] but of the spirit
[36:01] for the letter killeth
[36:03] but the spirit giveth life
[36:06] now the spirit
[36:07] takes the letter
[36:09] and manifests it
[36:11] exactly
[36:12] what happened this weekend
[36:14] god took
[36:16] the letter
[36:18] and made it alive by the spirit
[36:21] god bless you as you've seen it
[36:24] i just want to take a few moments here
[36:26] uh
[36:28] i have this quote and i know brother
[36:29] andrew referred to it and i thought i'd
[36:31] have isaac pull it up so you can see it
[36:35] it's from a blessing prophet
[36:38] if you can just pull that up we'll take
[36:39] a few minutes
[36:41] to see these young women come in weeping
[36:44] life before them
[36:46] they're at the crossroads
[36:49] they are a victim of circumstances
[36:52] what do you relays do you realize old
[36:54] men when we were boys
[36:55] our boys have got 10 times
[36:58] the temptation we had
[37:00] sister do you realize that your daughter
[37:03] has 10 times the temptation you had
[37:06] when you was a girl
[37:08] what will her daughter have
[37:11] look at the things the pictures the
[37:13] devil
[37:14] is painting
[37:15] now when do you think of all these years
[37:18] that have passed
[37:20] since this quote was spoken
[37:23] can you imagine what we're facing today
[37:27] you know
[37:29] and so
[37:30] i say
[37:33] that we need a living
[37:34] god to combat the enemy
[37:38] brother madam said we need that flying
[37:40] eagle anointing
[37:42] to break the bonds of the enemy
[37:44] and so we are looking to god
[37:47] to do this for us and he has done it
[37:50] amen i was thinking
[37:53] on brother branham i think it's
[37:57] i can't remember what message i think
[37:58] it's from that time and i know we're
[38:00] very familiar with it
[38:02] brother ben was saying my ministry is a
[38:04] different minister from a pastor or
[38:06] teacher
[38:08] but
[38:08] my ministry is to declare
[38:12] him
[38:13] that
[38:14] he's here
[38:16] now i got to thinking about that and
[38:18] you know
[38:20] that became more than words
[38:23] when the prophet was coming in other
[38:24] words it wasn't just talking about we're
[38:26] going to have a deeper teaching
[38:28] but we're going to see a supernatural
[38:30] god
[38:31] come on the scene and it's
[38:33] express himself
[38:35] that he is the same yesterday today and
[38:37] forever
[38:38] and i say that's what we
[38:40] visualized
[38:42] this weekend
[38:44] we saw the power of god come
[38:46] and deliver people
[38:48] filled people with the holy ghost
[38:51] took away fear and anxiety depression
[38:57] i know this uh
[38:59] this family doesn't come here but i was
[39:01] at the mcnulty's i'm not going to say
[39:03] who they are
[39:04] but i was talking to the father
[39:08] and he was telling me about his daughter
[39:10] now i i know he went by i don't know if
[39:13] she actually had a chance to talk to her
[39:15] but he saw the continents on her sunday
[39:18] after going through the prayer line
[39:20] she has battled depression
[39:22] for years
[39:24] even as a young lady now she's married
[39:26] has children
[39:28] but he said sunday her whole congress
[39:30] was different
[39:32] her whole conference was different i say
[39:34] to god be the glory
[39:36] and i was wondering
[39:38] i was wondering when uh you know i don't
[39:40] know if brother andrew did it too but
[39:42] even on sunday
[39:44] brother uh timothy was
[39:47] only two or three or four times just
[39:48] mentioned depression depression
[39:50] depression i was wondering whoa where i
[39:52] wonder where he's going you know so
[39:54] there must have been that but this
[39:56] happened on saturday night
[39:58] that she got her deliverance
[40:02] don't tell me we got a you know we just
[40:04] got a plain message
[40:07] christ is on the scene
[40:10] just one more quote before we i'm going
[40:12] to turn over to nathan
[40:14] but
[40:15] uh he can also pull this one up in
[40:17] crisis a mystery
[40:20] uh i don't need to read every paragraph
[40:22] necessarily i should have highlighted he
[40:24] said now think by the living presence
[40:27] of the living christ by the living word
[40:31] living christ's living presence living
[40:33] word by his own personal
[40:36] vindication proves his church
[40:42] slip down to 482. remember think of it
[40:44] that people born of a spirit
[40:46] in a day like this
[40:48] in this great denominational age that we
[40:50] live and the living god makes takes its
[40:52] living word and vindicates it personally
[40:56] this life that's in the word the german
[40:58] that's in the seed and the word is the
[40:59] seed that the sower went through the
[41:01] sower and if the life is christ in the
[41:03] word personally in you vindicating
[41:06] something you cannot do
[41:09] proving that it's not you but it's him
[41:13] you've got it
[41:15] a love slave
[41:16] to him
[41:17] to be the bride
[41:19] 4 484 his presence in the individual
[41:23] with a personal vindication of himself
[41:25] expressing himself the living word
[41:28] that's promised for the day
[41:30] expressing himself through a vindication
[41:32] of the great revelation of god look only
[41:34] in an individual never in a group
[41:37] never in a group
[41:39] his identification is with an individual
[41:45] amen 486 it's another group
[41:48] it's a personal
[41:50] vindication
[41:51] of a pregnant child of god filled with
[41:54] the holy ghost so surrender to god that
[41:57] he don't care about anything else
[41:59] and the holy spirit has given us life
[42:01] and pulsating through him
[42:03] that's a personal indication of the word
[42:06] excel
[42:08] amen one more quote
[42:10] from the presence of on of god
[42:12] unrecognized if we could only realize
[42:16] that he's appearing to us in these
[42:17] meetings for one purpose
[42:21] that's to release our desires that we
[42:23] have in him to us
[42:26] but we've got to recognize his presence
[42:30] and now how do you recognize his
[42:32] presence is when the promised word for
[42:35] this age is made manifest
[42:38] not the promised word of moses age or
[42:40] any other ages but it's a promised word
[42:43] for this
[42:44] age
[42:45] i'd say to god be the glory
[42:49] we got a promise word we got a
[42:51] vindicated word
[42:53] and it's not just a vindicated prophet
[42:55] it's a vindicated word to individuals
[42:59] and they're sitting here tonight
[43:01] with testimonies
[43:03] that god is real
[43:08] and so we
[43:09] we want to give time
[43:12] for the personal testimonies here and
[43:15] then nathan will bring
[43:17] some that i believe have been turned in

[45:11] that vision and give a you know give a
[45:14] give opportunity and actually we kind of
[45:16] have a problem
[45:17] which is that we have you know behind

[45:31] it's it's i believe bringing bringing a
[45:35] zeal into the church for our young
[45:36] people which just touches my heart
[45:38] because you know when you see god just
[45:40] raining down his blessings like that we
[45:41] want to be a part of it if i could pick
[45:43] a piece of trash up off the ground or
[45:45] hold the door for somebody or some way
[45:47] be a part i would want to share in what
[45:49] god is doing and that's just been the
[45:51] heart of the church and it's a
[45:52] tremendous tremendous thing
[45:55] you know
[45:56] and
[45:56] you know we even
[45:58] even on on wednesday there there was
[46:00] things we could have set up and i we
[46:01] just i said let's let's leave it for
[46:04] tomorrow because somebody will want to
[46:05] be a part
[46:06] and so we'll save a job for somebody and
[46:08] i really appreciate the mcnulty family
[46:10] for opening their home and and for
[46:12] including so many people in in uh you
[46:14] know it created so much more opportunity
[46:17] for our us to show our love as a church
[46:19] and hospitality and not just our church
[46:21] but
[46:21] but you know the other local churches
[46:23] was something that could really bring
[46:24] them together and that's part of the
[46:26] vision you know that's what we're about
[46:28] we're building bridges and lighting
[46:29] fires amen
[46:31] amen so we just appreciate you for your
[46:33] hospitality and just all the churches
[46:35] you know the ministries that have got
[46:37] behind it and given their support
[46:39] you know churches like brother tim
[46:41] pruitt where the church got together
[46:43] rented a bus paid for their young people
[46:45] to come sent sent over 50 children to be
[46:48] a part of our youth camp that's
[46:50] you know we don't take that for granted
[46:52] personally that's a great responsibility
[46:55] when you have established pastors that
[46:57] want to get behind something we want to
[46:59] be respectful of that
[47:00] amen we want to we want it to uh to be a
[47:03] reward for them so and and lastly before
[47:05] we go to personal testimonies i
[47:08] i want to i want to before the whole
[47:10] church i want to appreciate our youth
[47:12] group
[47:13] for the testimony that they're holding
[47:15] in front of the world i think we should
[47:17] thank the lord for these precious young
[47:19] people
[47:25] amen it's it's more than just you know
[47:27] young people believe in this message or
[47:28] living a lifestyle the comments that we
[47:30] get about our youth they're they're
[47:32] living a testimony of excellence and
[47:34] it's speaking to the world you know it'd
[47:36] be one thing if we were through a youth
[47:37] camp and got together and organized
[47:39] something for youth around the country
[47:40] to come and be a part of something but
[47:42] then to show up and find out that
[47:44] there's no testimony here at true word
[47:46] tabernacle then it would hurt their
[47:47] confidence in in what the lord's doing
[47:50] here but it's not the case god has given
[47:52] us uh
[47:53] wonderful just tremendous young people
[47:55] and you know in spite of the quote
[47:57] brother red which is so true that our
[47:59] young people are dealing with problems
[48:01] they're dealing with struggles
[48:03] that that some of us even from my
[48:05] generation can't quite relate to just
[48:07] the pressures that are on our young
[48:08] people
[48:09] and and it really has advanced it really
[48:12] has become worse in this world and yet
[48:14] the trend of god's people has gone up i
[48:17] want to testify to that what our young
[48:19] people have the character the hunger for
[48:21] the word the knowledge of the word the
[48:22] faith amen we didn't have it when i was
[48:25] that age
[48:27] i want to i want to say that for the
[48:28] glory of god it's the truth amen and so
[48:31] we just have precious young people that
[48:33] are credit to parents credit to the
[48:35] ministry here and they make us very very
[48:37] proud
[48:38] very very proud and i heard of at least
[48:40] three of ours that got the holy ghost
[48:42] this weekend
[48:43] amen
[48:50] amen
[48:52] at least three of us and so i'm gonna
[48:53] share one testimony that was put on the
[48:55] website and brother aaron could you get
[48:57] your poem ready if you would read that
[48:58] for the church tonight i'm coming back
[49:00] there to front row errands in the back
[49:02] tonight but
[49:03] we're going to have him give a testimony
[49:05] you know i shared this at the camp too
[49:08] in one of the services it was a powerful
[49:09] thing that god did
[49:11] i guess it was friday night brother
[49:13] timothy was ministering
[49:14] and he had he had finished his sermon
[49:16] and he had prayed for some people and
[49:18] virtue had really gone out so brother
[49:19] ronnie was leading him out of the church
[49:21] and he'd actually exited the church out
[49:22] the wing out into the study and there
[49:25] was a young lady sitting in the audience
[49:27] who had
[49:28] been struggling really hard and our our
[49:30] young sisters have a real struggle you
[49:33] know with their appearance when the
[49:34] standard of this world is not even a
[49:36] natural thing it's uh everything's
[49:38] artificial you know and it puts a great
[49:40] pressure on them and this poor young
[49:41] sister was struggling under those
[49:43] complexes of her appearance so bad she
[49:46] actually had not left her dorm that day
[49:47] she spent the whole day at youth camp
[49:49] just sitting in a dorm by herself
[49:51] because she just didn't want anybody to
[49:53] see her
[49:54] so that's that's how afflicted she was
[49:56] with this and she she's sitting there in
[49:58] service and uh she's wanting to go for
[50:01] prayer you know but just kind of working
[50:02] up the courage and then the the prayer
[50:04] kind of stopped there friday night and
[50:06] and brother timothy exited the church
[50:08] and she just felt heartbroken like lord
[50:09] i miss my opportunity then something
[50:12] rose up inside her she said lord you see
[50:14] my heart
[50:15] she said have brother timothy come back
[50:17] in here and say something to me and back
[50:19] there in the office brother timothy was
[50:21] on his way out brother ronnie was taking
[50:22] me said i got to go back brother ronnie
[50:24] said no you're done you're you've got to
[50:26] go you got to go to sleep
[50:28] and uh brother timothy said he would
[50:29] have fought brother ronnie if he'd have
[50:31] tried to stop him he said no there's
[50:32] more there's another chain to break he
[50:34] came storming it yeah how many were
[50:36] there that night he came came came out
[50:38] of that office with a purpose step to
[50:39] the platform he said you sisters i got
[50:41] one more chain to break you sisters are
[50:43] sitting there thinking you're ugly said
[50:44] you're beautifully and wonderfully made
[50:48] hallelujah and it wasn't just for that
[50:50] one sister but there were many sisters
[50:52] got a deliverance amen because of one
[50:55] prayer that's the god we serve amen he's
[50:57] a god that speaks he's not a silent god
[51:00] but but you know and that's the faith we
[51:02] ought to bring to a service amen when an
[51:04] anointed man of god is bringing the word
[51:06] amen you pull on that gift god will do
[51:09] something for you
[51:10] amen even in a testimony service like
[51:12] tonight god could do something for you
[51:14] there was a sister thought missed her
[51:15] opportunity at camp and she got the holy
[51:18] ghost on the bus ride on the way home
[51:21] amen don't put any limits on the lord
[51:24] glory be to god
[51:27] amen brother aaron share that poem and
[51:30] your testimony about what happened
[51:31] friday night
[51:34] i'm going to ask everybody to
[51:37] to tell camp testimonies tonight
[51:40] and to tell brief testimonies
[51:42] as well as you can i know some of you
[51:44] got lengthy ones you got them written
[51:45] down that's good you can read them off
[51:47] and stay organized but just want to say
[51:49] that up front
[51:52] uh my testimony briefly is i'm one of
[51:54] three who got the holy ghost for one
[52:04] a theme i heard or a phrase i kept
[52:06] hearing repeated over camp was
[52:10] satan could come at you with everything
[52:11] he has but it's not enough
[52:13] you
[52:14] no matter how long you've been bound etc
[52:16] etc it's not enough
[52:18] and
[52:20] today while i was at work i was reading
[52:21] the testimonies
[52:23] that were being posted
[52:26] i got inspiration to write a poem which
[52:28] i will now read
[52:35] you fight with the same old trap
[52:38] breaking free then falling again
[52:40] and you forget what hope is
[52:43] and lose your faith it'll end
[52:45] but even though all your chains
[52:48] feel like unbreakable cuffs
[52:51] i have been through and can say
[52:54] satan will never have enough
[52:57] no matter how long you've fought or how
[53:00] weary you've become
[53:02] no matter how far you've gone
[53:05] or if you just can't overcome
[53:08] and no matter how heavy
[53:10] it doesn't matter how tough
[53:12] all your bars and chains might be
[53:15] because they'll never be enough
[53:19] all of hell wants to stop this
[53:22] they can't let you remember
[53:24] if you find the faith you had
[53:27] every devil must surrender
[53:29] and even though it'll be hard
[53:32] even though the road is rough
[53:34] we can face those heavy chains and we
[53:37] can say
[53:38] it's not enough
[53:51] god bless you all i'll make mine short
[53:54] go ahead
[53:56] going into camp my attitude was this
[53:58] means war thursday night service was a
[54:01] wonderful start to camp the service
[54:03] really spoke to me and i believe it was
[54:05] a stepping stone to friday night
[54:07] friday night was my night the lord came
[54:09] and touched me in such a special way
[54:12] i went up to the altar and started
[54:13] pouring my heart out i was desperate
[54:16] with everything that's happened this
[54:17] past year i was starting to battle with
[54:19] fear and anxiety the devil was also
[54:22] bringing up my past and all the mistakes
[54:23] i made
[54:24] and everything i had done things i'm not
[54:26] proud of brother nathan and brother
[54:28] wayne came over at one point and started
[54:30] praying with me
[54:31] everything i wanted was praying and was
[54:33] thinking about brother nathan prayed it
[54:35] when they left such a sweet warm and
[54:37] intense presence came and it just
[54:39] wrapped all around me
[54:41] i was finally able to let go of my past
[54:44] fear anxiety my past mistakes past hurts
[54:47] and i was able to let go of grudges and
[54:49] truly forgive people
[54:51] i just felt it all knowed away from me
[54:54] then when brother timothy came out and
[54:56] said what he said about satan satan
[54:58] telling us that we're not beautiful
[55:01] and we're not worthy
[55:04] and and he said the chain is at your
[55:06] feet i felt the last chain and complex
[55:09] fall to the ground
[55:11] it literally felt like it fell from
[55:12] around my neck i felt like that boy and
[55:15] brother branham's sermon with the chain
[55:17] around his neck that was finally set
[55:19] free it just melted away
[55:21] that's something i've always struggled
[55:23] with a lot i didn't realize how strong
[55:25] of a chain it was
[55:26] i was up at the altar just worshiping
[55:28] and
[55:29] basking in the lord's sweet presence i
[55:31] didn't want to leave it
[55:32] and brother colby starts singing i won't
[55:35] go back
[55:36] when we get to the verses about my shame
[55:38] fear trains and past being gone it hit
[55:40] me and something just dropped in my
[55:42] heart and i realized that they really
[55:44] were
[55:45] they were broken and crumbled at my feet
[55:49] saturday night i went through the prayer
[55:51] line and as i was and as i was walking
[55:53] through i heard brother andrew say
[55:55] you've come so far
[55:57] i realized what i used to be and i'm not
[55:59] the same person anymore
[56:01] i have come so far by god's grace
[56:03] i got even more freedom and liberty with
[56:06] my praise and worship
[56:08] the devil has slowly been trying to
[56:10] quiet me down like i used to be last
[56:12] year at camp i was delivered of a
[56:14] formalism spirit well let's just say he
[56:16] won't quiet me down
[56:18] then sunday's service came and it was
[56:20] absolutely amazing
[56:22] when we started singing you don't know
[56:24] like i know i got such a joy freedom and
[56:27] liberty it's like it was just bubbling
[56:29] over on the inside and i had to do
[56:31] something so i got a tissue and started
[56:34] waving my white flag to victory
[56:36] when brother timothy started to sing he
[56:39] filled me with the holy ghost that's
[56:40] what he's done for me i was just
[56:42] worshiping away such a sweet presence
[56:44] came
[56:45] and it went from the top of my head to
[56:47] the bottom of my feet
[56:49] something just came and anchored never
[56:51] to be moved or doubted again in my heart
[56:53] i knew right then that i had it
[56:56] i got my joy peace love so much freedom
[56:59] and liberty back the devil cannot have
[57:02] my freedom sound mind praise and worship
[57:05] it's mine i left camp totally different
[57:08] changed forever i am not the same i know
[57:11] who i am
[57:12] i'm walking in my eternal purpose oh
[57:14] devil how a liar you are
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:30] okay
[57:31] i'll try and condense mine a little bit
[57:32] too
[57:34] um
[57:35] so i'll start with a little bit of a
[57:36] back story i got the holy ghost
[57:38] in february of this year
[57:40] but um this year has been rough on a lot
[57:42] of us and it was really easy to feel
[57:44] discouraged
[57:46] with everything happening so fast
[57:49] and within the last couple months the
[57:50] devil had really began to whisper lies
[57:53] telling me that i didn't have the holy
[57:54] ghost
[57:55] and um
[57:57] well i
[57:59] yeah he was he was wrong
[58:01] but i kept i kept telling myself that
[58:03] these were lies but he kept doing a good
[58:06] job of convincing me that um
[58:08] it was true
[58:10] but um
[58:13] i was painting a bible before camp a
[58:15] couple of my friends and i decided to
[58:17] paint bibles
[58:18] and i prayed a long time about what to
[58:21] write on the front because i wanted
[58:23] whatever it was to have an impact on my
[58:26] testimony from camp
[58:27] and um when i was praying and the verse
[58:30] from
[58:37] from john from
[58:39] john 19. um that says he said it is
[58:42] finished came to my mind
[58:44] and so that's why i decided to paint on
[58:46] the front and um friday night when
[58:48] brother timothy was preaching i prayed
[58:50] that he would say something along the
[58:53] lines of um it is finished and he walked
[58:56] over to the
[58:58] side of the platform that i was sitting
[58:59] on and he looked right at me and pointed
[59:01] right at me and he said what do you have
[59:03] to worry about he said it is finished
[59:06] and so that i
[59:08] that was pretty
[59:09] i got pretty happy um
[59:12] and um
[59:14] i also went to camp this year really
[59:16] desiring a very personal experience
[59:22] when i went through the prayer line i
[59:24] wanted one of the ministers to say
[59:26] something directly to me because i never
[59:27] had that happen before
[59:29] and
[59:31] so i turned the corner
[59:32] and i was headed straight for the uh
[59:35] ministers
[59:36] and
[59:37] um the devil was
[59:38] had
[59:39] uh
[59:40] said you know what if this isn't
[59:42] you know like what if this life isn't
[59:44] for you what if it's all been fake what
[59:46] if you know you're not gonna make it
[59:49] and so i prayed that um one of the
[59:51] ministers would let me know that this is
[59:54] this is it this is this is for me
[59:56] and um i got up there and i had my eyes
[59:58] closed and my hands raised and brother
[1:00:01] andrew grabbed my left wrist
[1:00:04] and leaned down next to my um
[1:00:07] ear and he said
[1:00:09] he basically
[1:00:10] was
[1:00:11] said what i was
[1:00:13] asking he said is it for you
[1:00:16] and i all i could do is shake my head
[1:00:17] because i was already crying and um he
[1:00:20] said yes it is and then brother wayne
[1:00:22] grabbed my right wrist
[1:00:24] and um
[1:00:25] he
[1:00:26] they were all praying for me but i
[1:00:27] remember what he said he said house of
[1:00:29] hell give way for this daughter of god
[1:00:31] for she has been made free and then i
[1:00:33] spent the rest of the night rejoicing
[1:00:35] and um
[1:00:36] and uh sunday morning rejoicing
[1:00:39] [Applause]
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:48] who's next
[1:00:50] who's next
[1:00:53] mama why don't you give yours
[1:00:58] i had been
[1:01:00] dealing with plantar fasciitis for a
[1:01:01] couple years where i don't know if
[1:01:03] someone doesn't know your feet hurt
[1:01:05] really bad the muscles are really tight
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:09] when it's really bad it's hard to walk
[1:01:11] and
[1:01:12] before camp it got really bad where my
[1:01:15] feet were feeling like pins and needles
[1:01:16] every time i walked
[1:01:18] and um
[1:01:21] sorry
[1:01:29] saturday night during the
[1:01:31] prayer line i felt pressed to go up um
[1:01:34] and pray for that need
[1:01:37] and i really really wanted that really
[1:01:39] bad because it was been a constant
[1:01:40] struggle for a long time that really
[1:01:42] helped me get me from doing a lot of
[1:01:44] things that
[1:01:46] uh
[1:01:47] i should be able to do in my daily life
[1:01:50] so um i was just really
[1:01:53] staying in the prayer line and really
[1:01:55] just thinking on all of the miracles
[1:01:57] that i knew in my life personally and
[1:02:00] brother branham's time just trying to
[1:02:03] really raise my faith because i really
[1:02:05] wanted to take this home
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:09] as uh it got to be my turn
[1:02:12] brother andrew grabbed my hand and said
[1:02:15] you really want this don't you and i
[1:02:17] said yes i think i said yes i was trying
[1:02:20] to
[1:02:21] and uh he said
[1:02:23] uh why do you doubt
[1:02:25] and when he said that i felt like a
[1:02:27] child
[1:02:28] i don't know why i was doubting you know
[1:02:30] i didn't even realize that i was trying
[1:02:32] to raise my faith the whole time but he
[1:02:34] said i saw you way back in the prayer
[1:02:36] line and it's yours
[1:02:38] something to that effect
[1:02:40] and so i just started praising and
[1:02:42] worshiping the lord and
[1:02:44] i was just at the altar thanking him for
[1:02:46] my healing and started moving my feet
[1:02:47] around and you know all that pain that
[1:02:49] had been constantly with me you know it
[1:02:51] wasn't there anymore it's completely
[1:02:53] gone
[1:02:54] amen
[1:03:02] i just wanted to add and know it's small
[1:03:04] and almost insignificant but i had also
[1:03:07] hit my foot on a picnic table walking
[1:03:09] around and the top of my foot was had a
[1:03:12] really big bruise on it so after the
[1:03:14] prayer line i was talking to andrew and
[1:03:15] i said man i really hit my foot on this
[1:03:17] picnic table and i went to show them
[1:03:19] that bruise and it was completely gone
[1:03:21] so i
[1:03:22] didn't ask for it
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:31] who's next i want to have some more
[1:03:34] i'll tell you we saw some
[1:03:36] you know this year uh standing right
[1:03:38] there at the front line with brother
[1:03:39] andrew and brother
[1:03:41] brother wayne and the other brothers and
[1:03:43] had a front row seat to some really
[1:03:45] supernatural events
[1:03:48] and i just think it's marvelous you know
[1:03:50] that uh
[1:03:51] just because god took his profit off the
[1:03:53] scene doesn't mean there's not gifts in
[1:03:54] the church
[1:03:55] doesn't mean he's not still a discerner
[1:03:57] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:03:59] still a deliverer still a healer
[1:04:01] still a comforter
[1:04:03] powerful things i think one one time
[1:04:06] brother andrew uh well a few times he
[1:04:08] made mention to different people of the
[1:04:10] some to the effect of he said he said i
[1:04:12] see the angel of the lord
[1:04:14] whirling around right over this spot
[1:04:17] see his light i've seen it and so my
[1:04:20] that's powerful you know i think uh you
[1:04:22] know in things that happen in the
[1:04:23] ministry brother timothy brother wayne
[1:04:26] these brothers you know
[1:04:28] that's the kind of god we serve that's
[1:04:29] what we believe in we believe in a bride
[1:04:31] ministry
[1:04:33] we believe he's riding this trail again
[1:04:35] amen now some people say well you know
[1:04:37] young people they lean too much on
[1:04:39] certain persons and certain gifts and
[1:04:41] things they lean to as if those
[1:04:43] ministers aren't aware of that
[1:04:45] and dealing with that but the gift is of
[1:04:46] god
[1:04:48] and we're expecting those things to be
[1:04:50] manifested in the church of the living
[1:04:52] god
[1:04:53] amen just tremendous what god's done
[1:04:55] anyone else that's one of your sisters
[1:04:57] brother levi yeah
[1:05:06] you know when you get ready to go up to
[1:05:08] a prayer line the devil is always doing
[1:05:10] everything that he can to
[1:05:12] try to try to get you to you know say
[1:05:16] it's not for your
[1:05:17] you know saturday night i knew what i
[1:05:19] needed
[1:05:20] and uh i said i thought well you know
[1:05:23] this is just for the young people and
[1:05:24] i'm not really young i
[1:05:26] i'm halfway old and i thought well
[1:05:29] so i just like that i looked up and i
[1:05:32] seen sister lucille go through the
[1:05:33] prayer line i thought well if she can go
[1:05:35] through i can go through
[1:05:39] i uh
[1:05:41] i was desiring a refilling of the holy
[1:05:43] ghost and i knew i had gotten in just a
[1:05:45] kind of a lukewarm
[1:05:47] lady osea spirit crept on me and
[1:05:50] i was i was thinking if they stopped me
[1:05:53] at the prayer line that's i i have a
[1:05:54] specific need that's what i'll ask for
[1:05:57] i got up to the prayer line and
[1:06:01] brother wayne prayed almost exactly i
[1:06:04] never spoke to any of the ministers
[1:06:05] brother wayne i i'm not i didn't hear
[1:06:08] brother andrew but brother wayne prayed
[1:06:09] almost exactly what i had in my heart
[1:06:13] so it's just proving to me god still
[1:06:15] knows your heart
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:27] i just want to say as the camp director
[1:06:30] it's not just for the young people
[1:06:35] i am young at heart don't don't forget
[1:06:38] that okay um
[1:06:40] this testimony is for
[1:06:42] um
[1:06:43] something that happened to molly she's
[1:06:45] not here but you know what i'm her mama
[1:06:47] i raised her i have prayed for her
[1:06:51] i've been watching god move and work
[1:06:54] and after she had sage
[1:06:57] she went into depression
[1:06:59] and anxiety
[1:07:01] and um
[1:07:02] we're not against medication by no means
[1:07:04] we feel like we're balanced we'll do
[1:07:06] natural medical whatever god leads but
[1:07:08] she had to go on some medication
[1:07:11] and um she had been on it now for four
[1:07:13] years
[1:07:14] and about four weeks ago she ran out
[1:07:18] and could not get into the doctor and
[1:07:20] they would not give her a refill
[1:07:22] for this medication and if i understand
[1:07:25] that type of medication you're not
[1:07:27] supposed to go off of a cold turkey
[1:07:29] because you can have some pretty serious
[1:07:31] side effects from it but they couldn't
[1:07:33] get her in they wouldn't even make an
[1:07:34] appointment to get her in to even
[1:07:36] you know get her a refill for four weeks
[1:07:39] and so
[1:07:41] camp came and
[1:07:44] let's see wednesday and thursday she was
[1:07:45] having some really good
[1:07:48] anxiety attacks and some different
[1:07:50] things that was pretty concerning you
[1:07:52] know for me as a mom and for her and so
[1:07:55] um we encouraged her to go to camp and
[1:07:57] she came friday night right babe friday
[1:08:00] night and um they were really hitting
[1:08:03] like you said brother ray the anxiety
[1:08:05] and depression
[1:08:07] and um luke wasn't there so i just
[1:08:10] took the babies and was did grandma duty
[1:08:13] in the nursery so molly could sit there
[1:08:15] and soak this in under uninterrupted
[1:08:18] and just praying for her you know lord
[1:08:20] you just move you move and um
[1:08:23] so friday night
[1:08:25] ends we go home and then saturday was
[1:08:28] that saturday night prayer line okay
[1:08:29] saturday night was friday night but
[1:08:31] saturday night all that was happening
[1:08:33] so then
[1:08:34] she comes back sunday morning
[1:08:37] and
[1:08:38] again i took the children to the nursery
[1:08:40] because he was hitting on it again
[1:08:42] and she came out and she
[1:08:44] said mom it's okay i'll take the kids
[1:08:46] back in now
[1:08:47] and so we went back in and it was
[1:08:49] towards the end of the service and
[1:08:50] brother tim was hitting again
[1:08:53] on anxiety and depression it was more
[1:08:56] towards the end of the service and so
[1:08:58] when he
[1:08:59] called out that spirit again
[1:09:02] you mamas know you hear your child you
[1:09:04] know your child's cry and i heard this
[1:09:05] scream out and i looked over
[1:09:07] and there was molly pitched forward and
[1:09:10] she had you know mila in her hand i was
[1:09:12] like oh i gotta go get that baby and she
[1:09:14] was pitched forward and shot her your
[1:09:16] hand up and just screaming out and
[1:09:18] screaming out and um
[1:09:22] just over and over you know crying out
[1:09:23] and i didn't get a chance to to talk
[1:09:26] with her that evening and so
[1:09:28] i was still concerned with her
[1:09:30] symptoms and so me as mom trying to
[1:09:32] doctor i'm looking for natural things to
[1:09:34] try to calm her you know situation down
[1:09:37] so she didn't go back on the medication
[1:09:39] she didn't make it to the doctor but she
[1:09:41] didn't go back on the medication she
[1:09:43] said i'm going to try to to get through
[1:09:44] this
[1:09:45] and so um
[1:09:47] i talked to her on monday morning and i
[1:09:50] said hey molly i said
[1:09:52] i said you know i had
[1:09:53] was looking up and found this natural
[1:09:55] means for
[1:09:57] the anxiety in case you you would need
[1:09:59] something she said mom
[1:10:01] she said that thing's gone she said
[1:10:04] when brother tim
[1:10:06] hit on depression through the last part
[1:10:08] of the service
[1:10:10] i stood up and raised my hand up and i
[1:10:12] literally felt that thing leave and lift
[1:10:14] off my body
[1:10:24] she said i don't need she said even when
[1:10:26] you said he was talking about that
[1:10:28] anxiety giving i don't need that stuff
[1:10:30] mama it's gone so that i'm delivered
[1:10:33] so praise the lord
[1:10:44] ella doesn't want to do this so i guess
[1:10:45] i will
[1:10:47] um
[1:10:48] on thursday night she went up for prayer
[1:10:50] she wanted the holy ghost
[1:10:52] and she came back to her seat and she
[1:10:54] was
[1:10:56] discouraged and sad
[1:10:59] and i asked her if she's okay she said
[1:11:00] yes and then she started she got down on
[1:11:03] her knees and started praying
[1:11:05] and i asked her what's wrong and she
[1:11:07] said mom i went for the holy ghost and i
[1:11:09] didn't get it
[1:11:11] she's like she said why does everybody
[1:11:13] else get it so easy what am i doing
[1:11:16] wrong
[1:11:18] and so she was she told me she wasn't
[1:11:20] going to be able to be happy the rest of
[1:11:22] camp if she didn't get the holy ghost
[1:11:25] and she just was a sad little puppy and
[1:11:27] followed me around
[1:11:29] for all day
[1:11:30] all day friday and all day saturday and
[1:11:34] it was just it was breaking my heart i
[1:11:36] about couldn't take it
[1:11:37] and
[1:11:39] saturday night they'd asked me to help
[1:11:40] with the prayer line
[1:11:42] and
[1:11:43] my thought was
[1:11:45] who's gonna
[1:11:46] encourage her to go in the prayer line
[1:11:48] when i'm not there
[1:11:50] but anyways i went to the front and
[1:11:53] was helping them and brother andrew
[1:11:55] right up close to the beginning when the
[1:11:57] prayer line was starting
[1:11:58] he looked at me and he said
[1:12:00] he's coming your way tonight
[1:12:03] i didn't know what that meant but i was
[1:12:04] happy i was i couldn't wait to see what
[1:12:06] it was and i know i had no idea i wasn't
[1:12:10] thinking about a letter that it would be
[1:12:12] her or anything like that
[1:12:14] and about 45 minutes later ella came up
[1:12:17] the line and i had just helped take
[1:12:18] somebody out and i came back to the
[1:12:20] beginning
[1:12:21] right when she walked up and he looked
[1:12:23] at me said okay here it is
[1:12:25] now go with her and watch it happen
[1:12:28] and so i i jumped through the whole line
[1:12:30] i'm also look like a crazy person
[1:12:34] i was over there trying to pray with her
[1:12:36] rejoicing because i knew she was gonna
[1:12:37] get it
[1:12:38] and at one point she started to get up
[1:12:40] she turned around to get up i said nope
[1:12:42] you're not ready yet you gotta stay
[1:12:44] there we're gonna stay here all night if
[1:12:45] that's what it takes because you don't
[1:12:47] have it yet
[1:12:48] i don't know how i knew but i did
[1:12:50] and
[1:12:51] we prayed for a while longer and
[1:12:55] i don't i don't know what made me say it
[1:12:57] i don't know
[1:12:58] i don't feel like it was really me it
[1:13:00] just came out i looked at her and said
[1:13:02] you got it and she took her she took her
[1:13:04] hands and grabbed my face and she said i
[1:13:06] got it mom i got it and she was just
[1:13:09] crying she's like i'm so happy
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:24] i'll tell you we didn't
[1:13:26] you know
[1:13:27] it's just too bad the whole church
[1:13:29] couldn't be right there to see but i'll
[1:13:31] tell you one thing we got uncle ben's
[1:13:32] reaction on video
[1:13:35] praise the lord amen i want to share
[1:13:38] another testimony similar to that it was
[1:13:40] one of the youth one of the young men
[1:13:41] from louisiana joseph adams i believe
[1:13:44] and the whole thing is on the
[1:13:46] their stream from wednesday night but i
[1:13:48] thought it was amazing he said you know
[1:13:49] i've been to different youth camps and
[1:13:50] he named him off you know where
[1:13:52] he said i would just go seek in the holy
[1:13:54] ghost and i'd just come home
[1:13:55] disappointed just come home disappointed
[1:13:57] you know i'd get an experience or
[1:13:58] something would happen i'd dance or
[1:14:00] shout or something he said but i just
[1:14:02] never came home with the with the real
[1:14:03] baptism of the holy ghost and he
[1:14:05] correctly identified the the root he
[1:14:07] said i never i couldn't
[1:14:09] completely surrender
[1:14:11] he said i was always there was things i
[1:14:12] was holding on to couldn't come to a
[1:14:14] full surrender so long story short he
[1:14:17] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:18] at our camp
[1:14:19] amen so we just just glad to be a part
[1:14:22] of that story
[1:14:25] so he was rejoicing you know and he did
[1:14:27] something i kind of like on sunday
[1:14:29] morning uh you know during the singing
[1:14:31] worship there he he must took a mark or
[1:14:34] a pen or something he said he wrote the
[1:14:35] devil's name on the bottom of his shoe
[1:14:37] and he knows senator sooner finished
[1:14:39] doing that and brother andrew was
[1:14:40] singing that song you don't know like i
[1:14:42] know joy when i think about we kind of
[1:14:44] like that song around here
[1:14:45] and he said i get brother andrew started
[1:14:47] to sing i get joy when i think about
[1:14:49] satan under my feet
[1:14:51] so the young man he said he took that as
[1:14:53] a confirmation started to well long
[1:14:55] story short by the end of the day there
[1:14:57] was nothing left on the bottom of the
[1:14:59] shoe not a trace of that devil amen
[1:15:01] hallelujah
[1:15:08] anyone else especially our young people
[1:15:10] i'd like to hear some more testimonies
[1:15:14] amen we'll get to let's try to get a
[1:15:16] young person here
[1:15:17] if we can
[1:15:19] how about about a how about a buy a
[1:15:20] raised hand one of our young people want
[1:15:22] to say i had a touch from the lord
[1:15:25] i had a deliverance
[1:15:26] had a healing
[1:15:28] amen had a comfort
[1:15:30] amen we give hannah did you want to
[1:15:32] share yours tonight i'll come over to
[1:15:34] you
[1:15:34] amen sister marge
[1:15:38] um
[1:15:39] okay well um
[1:15:43] i
[1:15:44] got in the prayer line because my
[1:15:45] heart's desire was that i wanted to see
[1:15:48] the
[1:15:49] have the devil be better at getting him
[1:15:51] keeping him under my feet
[1:15:54] because i tend to be emotional and
[1:15:56] anyway
[1:15:58] when i was going to go out for prayer
[1:16:00] the thought came to me
[1:16:02] that
[1:16:02] when just when he lays his hands on you
[1:16:06] but in my mind i was
[1:16:08] looking forward to like just going
[1:16:10] through the prayer line and really being
[1:16:11] prayed for by everyone because i was
[1:16:13] like how powerful you know
[1:16:15] and um
[1:16:18] but when i got in the line and i and i
[1:16:21] came up to the front
[1:16:23] i was
[1:16:25] i mean i
[1:16:26] i
[1:16:27] i guess brother um
[1:16:30] andrew ass
[1:16:32] i didn't know if he was going to ask me
[1:16:33] what
[1:16:34] but anyway my thought was just
[1:16:37] to i
[1:16:39] i'm well my heart also was even though i
[1:16:41] don't care about earthly things but
[1:16:44] about a year ago
[1:16:46] i
[1:16:47] or maybe it was longer i don't know i
[1:16:49] got rid of all my almost all my jewelry
[1:16:52] like my original wedding band
[1:16:54] sales
[1:16:55] matching band i mean it accidentally got
[1:16:58] trashed and i didn't know about it till
[1:17:00] months later and and i thought well well
[1:17:03] it's cannon fodder anyway so it's okay
[1:17:07] but it started like
[1:17:10] but it's been in my heart to say lord
[1:17:11] where's the miracles you know believers
[1:17:15] miracles follow believers and i'm a
[1:17:17] believer so
[1:17:20] i just thought
[1:17:22] that's a challenge
[1:17:24] so when i got up into the prayer line i
[1:17:26] mentioned i said i need a miracle and
[1:17:29] because i just committed to the lord i
[1:17:31] don't really
[1:17:32] care about
[1:17:33] that stuff but i thought
[1:17:35] is that fear keeping me from asking i
[1:17:38] thought god's i was cattle in a thousand
[1:17:41] hills i mean it's what is it for god
[1:17:44] because even well anyway
[1:17:46] as soon as
[1:17:49] i don't know who laid hands on me but
[1:17:51] i was not planning on
[1:17:53] getting excited or something but also i
[1:17:55] know as i went through that line before
[1:17:57] i knew it
[1:17:58] and
[1:18:00] all i know is god knows my needs my
[1:18:02] needs for my children are you know god's
[1:18:05] mindful of all that and i committed to
[1:18:06] him and i just
[1:18:08] i will worship the lord
[1:18:11] i don't care that what if he never does
[1:18:13] another thing for me i believe
[1:18:16] god and i know he's a miracle working
[1:18:19] god
[1:18:20] and
[1:18:22] i trust him and i'm i'm believing so
[1:18:25] god can do whatever he likes
[1:18:28] [Applause]
[1:18:34] i mean
[1:18:35] i like something sister marge said there
[1:18:37] about you know
[1:18:38] you have certain expectations about how
[1:18:40] god's going to move on it
[1:18:42] what's going to happen that sister we
[1:18:43] talked about earlier i loved the way she
[1:18:45] brought her testimony she said she was
[1:18:47] very organized person really a planner
[1:18:49] and she said she had it all in her mind
[1:18:52] how it would happen she'd go through the
[1:18:53] prayer line or brother
[1:18:55] brother andrew would have something
[1:18:56] specifically said to her she said well
[1:18:57] none of that happened
[1:18:59] and the last thing she expected was get
[1:19:01] the holy ghost on the bus on the way
[1:19:02] home from camp
[1:19:03] but one way or the other god will keep
[1:19:05] his word amen
[1:19:11] so i actually don't like talking in
[1:19:12] front of people and i had determined i
[1:19:14] wasn't volunteering my testimony unless
[1:19:16] i was specifically asked to
[1:19:18] so i guess god wants it shared um but
[1:19:22] since the explosion in june the devil is
[1:19:24] just heaped fear and anxiety on me
[1:19:26] but i thought i was doing a decent job
[1:19:28] managing it and handling it and i just
[1:19:30] thought that i was destined for that
[1:19:33] and maybe a couple weeks ago i had
[1:19:35] determined that okay i'll go through the
[1:19:37] prayer line saturday night if they have
[1:19:38] one
[1:19:39] and i know i'll get delivered then i
[1:19:40] don't know why i thought i had to wait
[1:19:42] but that's what i told myself
[1:19:44] so we go to camp
[1:19:46] and friday night
[1:19:48] brother timothy is just hammering fear
[1:19:50] and anxiety i mean hammering it i don't
[1:19:52] know that i've ever set through a
[1:19:53] service where that's like every other
[1:19:55] sentence
[1:19:57] and i'm just sitting there and i'm like
[1:19:58] yeah i know i'm gonna get it you know
[1:20:00] tomorrow
[1:20:01] and then he literally stops and he's
[1:20:03] like today is your day why are you
[1:20:05] waiting and i'm like
[1:20:06] and i raised my hands and it was like i
[1:20:08] literally felt it break
[1:20:10] free
[1:20:12] and so i was worshiping the rest of the
[1:20:14] service and then i really felt impressed
[1:20:16] to just go tell him that i really wanted
[1:20:18] him to know what had happened
[1:20:20] and there was time for prayer afterwards
[1:20:22] he was standing there and praying and
[1:20:24] i don't like getting up in front of
[1:20:25] people so i was fighting with myself to
[1:20:27] get up there and so finally i talked
[1:20:30] myself into getting in line and then
[1:20:31] they break brother andrew's with a group
[1:20:33] of people and brother timothy is with a
[1:20:34] group of people like well hopefully i
[1:20:36] get with him so i'm waiting my turn i
[1:20:39] actually tapped brother ronnie at one
[1:20:40] point and i was like i would really like
[1:20:41] to tell brother timothy a testimony if
[1:20:43] that's okay and about the time i
[1:20:44] finished saying that brother timothy
[1:20:46] finished praying with the person in
[1:20:48] front of me and it just it worked out
[1:20:49] like i shouldn't have feared you know
[1:20:51] that god wouldn't have allowed it
[1:20:53] so i was telling him the testimony
[1:20:55] um but another part of that is
[1:20:57] i've struggled with a lot of health
[1:20:59] symptoms for a really long time and i
[1:21:01] believe i received my healing years ago
[1:21:04] actually and i believe that a lot of my
[1:21:06] symptoms have just been me walking into
[1:21:08] victory but i tend to dwell on those
[1:21:10] symptoms a lot i talk about him and
[1:21:13] after he talked about today's your day
[1:21:14] he goes into
[1:21:16] you know god calls us to be worshippers
[1:21:18] but we are called to worship him not our
[1:21:20] symptoms so why are you always talking
[1:21:21] about your symptoms i'm just like okay
[1:21:23] lord i get it like i'll stop
[1:21:26] so i was telling brother timothy you
[1:21:27] know about the the chains breaking of
[1:21:29] fear and anxiety and then i
[1:21:31] mentioned you know that about um oh i
[1:21:34] felt like he was talking straight to me
[1:21:35] like to stop talking about my symptoms
[1:21:37] and to talk that god is my healer and i
[1:21:38] said so i just wanted to come up and
[1:21:39] tell you thank you and i wanted to thank
[1:21:41] god for my healing and he's like well i
[1:21:43] want you to right now praise him and
[1:21:45] thank him and so i just i raised my
[1:21:46] hands and was thanking him for my
[1:21:48] healing and for my victory and i went
[1:21:50] back to my seat and i spent all of
[1:21:51] saturday and sunday just rejoicing
[1:21:54] and you know the devil he he likes to
[1:21:56] fight yet it's not been an easy week and
[1:21:58] fear and anxiety been trying to creep
[1:21:59] back up but
[1:22:01] i just want saints and to know that he
[1:22:02] can't have my victory
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:15] amen anyone else got a testimony
[1:22:33] thanks
[1:22:35] um
[1:22:37] okay so last year
[1:22:40] um for a couple years anyways uh we've
[1:22:42] been trying to have a baby
[1:22:44] and um
[1:22:45] at camp
[1:22:47] last year me and seth really felt like
[1:22:49] it was our time to go for a prayer
[1:22:53] on saturday night
[1:22:55] so we both went up
[1:22:58] and um we went hand in hand
[1:23:02] as we were going in i was on ronnie's
[1:23:04] side and seth was on brother wayne's
[1:23:06] side
[1:23:07] and as we were going in
[1:23:10] i heard ronnie say
[1:23:17] he said
[1:23:18] that your baby is on the way speak their
[1:23:20] name
[1:23:21] and um
[1:23:23] later this year
[1:23:24] around june um

[1:23:29] baby
[1:23:42] amen anyone else
[1:23:55] uh
[1:24:05] all right real quick i just want to i

[1:24:14] my mother has been praying for
[1:24:16] um healing of her hip she says the bone

[1:24:43] and i
[1:24:44] believe that she is healed right now in
[1:24:47] the name of jesus

[1:25:43] praying
[1:25:44] lord if it's your will for me to go
[1:25:46] through make a way
[1:25:49] and
[1:25:50] i was sitting there the entire service
[1:25:54] there was no way
[1:25:55] so
[1:25:56] of course i'm telling myself well

[1:26:25] and
[1:26:27] he told me
[1:26:28] he said see
[1:26:29] this wasn't the end for you
[1:26:31] you don't even have to go into that
[1:26:33] prayer line
[1:26:34] i can give it to you right here
[1:26:38] it was an experience that i've never had
[1:26:40] before
[1:26:42] a hundred times greater than i've ever
[1:26:43] had just in my regular church services
[1:26:47] and
[1:26:49] ellie i wasn't planning on saying this
[1:26:51] but
[1:26:52] she's sitting right next to me and you
[1:26:54] know i'm recovering still and i'm not
[1:26:56] trying to bring myself back out to it so
[1:26:58] that i can
[1:26:59] thank her for praying with me
[1:27:02] and we sit back down and i'm hugging her
[1:27:05] and our heads are touching
[1:27:08] and
[1:27:09] it was not my words
[1:27:11] and
[1:27:12] i said i'm praying for you
[1:27:15] i've been in your
[1:27:16] place the lord has brought us literally
[1:27:19] from pennsylvania
[1:27:21] in just a couple months
[1:27:23] to here
[1:27:25] he has dropped the price of a house just
[1:27:27] by a dollar
[1:27:29] to let us know that we're supposed to be
[1:27:30] coming here
[1:27:32] and i said your time's coming
[1:27:35] and i said lord bring them home
[1:27:38] they make this congregation complete
[1:27:41] and
[1:27:43] i just it wasn't me saying that
[1:27:46] i knew it right then and there i'm not
[1:27:47] normally the type to pray out loud so
[1:27:50] i knew it then
[1:27:51] um
[1:27:53] but
[1:27:54] i just wanted to
[1:27:56] share that i didn't have to go into the
[1:27:58] prayer line he gave it to me right then
[1:27:59] in my seat
[1:28:09] i mean
[1:28:10] we appreciate
[1:28:12] some young people that have a real
[1:28:13] experience with god
[1:28:15] amen and people people take notice i
[1:28:17] think ben nailed it on sunday morning so
[1:28:20] i made a little statement about the
[1:28:22] musicians that we had
[1:28:23] he said you know it's a life behind the
[1:28:25] gift yeah that's what makes it work
[1:28:28] that's what makes it effective that's
[1:28:29] why you know our young sisters get up
[1:28:30] here and sing the church gets behind it
[1:28:33] people worship god why because they see
[1:28:35] a real life
[1:28:36] they see a real light so we're thankful
[1:28:38] for what the lord's done that's what
[1:28:39] we're that's what keeps us going that's
[1:28:41] what it's all about
[1:28:50] amen you know you you know you you know
[1:28:52] you're doing something for the lord
[1:28:53] because you'll hit resistance time to
[1:28:55] time you know there'll be criticisms
[1:28:57] there'll be things
[1:28:58] there'll be obstacles but you know not
[1:29:01] many
[1:29:02] there's more with us than there are
[1:29:03] against us
[1:29:05] yes sir and more and more by the day
[1:29:07] because people are hungry for a real
[1:29:09] experience with god
[1:29:10] amen but you know i made a little
[1:29:12] comment one situation and brother isaac
[1:29:14] i said yeah well
[1:29:16] we're making waves
[1:29:18] he said well if you're making waves it
[1:29:19] matters who's in the boat with you
[1:29:22] amen the waves don't matter what matters
[1:29:24] is who's in the boat
[1:29:26] but we've seen god deliver do some real
[1:29:29] works of deliverance real works of
[1:29:31] victory amen from the dark dark things
[1:29:34] that young people face today suicide
[1:29:37] lost its power
[1:29:38] amen a young man just shared on the
[1:29:40] website today young man you know he's
[1:29:41] had a lot of struggles in his life by
[1:29:43] the name of michael and put in his
[1:29:44] testimony said he said this year the
[1:29:47] lord delivered me from suicide he said i
[1:29:49] got the holy ghost and fire on the
[1:29:51] inside amen
[1:29:52] hallelujah
[1:30:00] amen last year you know there was a real
[1:30:02] powerful testimony about that a young
[1:30:04] lady i
[1:30:05] must been in the prayer line or
[1:30:06] something
[1:30:07] came and spoke to brother andrew she
[1:30:09] said said brother andrew if i don't get
[1:30:11] something from god right here i'm going
[1:30:13] to go home and kill myself
[1:30:16] amen and the lord did something for her
[1:30:18] there but you know what we checked in
[1:30:19] this year she's still standing
[1:30:22] it wasn't a temporary thing it was a
[1:30:24] lasting experience
[1:30:26] lasting victory a real overcoming we
[1:30:28] believe in that amen you know what the
[1:30:31] what the devil will do you know there is
[1:30:33] nothing satan can do to change what you
[1:30:36] experienced in these meetings
[1:30:38] nothing no power of hell can can change
[1:30:40] the fact that god heaven came down god
[1:30:43] came down and he did something
[1:30:44] personally for you
[1:30:46] but what he'll do is he'll try to change
[1:30:48] your confession about it
[1:30:50] that's where he'll come in that's why
[1:30:51] brother branham said he said and brother
[1:30:53] timothy referenced this and i thought it
[1:30:55] was i thought it was the perfect
[1:30:57] message on sunday morning for young
[1:30:59] people to take home from a camp meeting
[1:31:01] the key to keeping a victory brother
[1:31:03] braham said it's a strange thing with
[1:31:04] people they say well i'm weak my faith
[1:31:06] is not much
[1:31:07] i'm not a very good christian that's
[1:31:09] just what the devil wants you to say
[1:31:12] you're just talking his language right
[1:31:13] then see you must never say that don't
[1:31:16] ever let your testimony be negative let
[1:31:19] it be positive all the time
[1:31:22] amen say it after me i am saved
[1:31:26] i have god in my heart
[1:31:28] i believe him with all of my heart
[1:31:30] divine healing i believe with all my
[1:31:33] heart
[1:31:34] amen let your testimony always and your
[1:31:37] thoughts never permit a negative thought
[1:31:39] to come in your mind if you can help it
[1:31:42] but when it starts don't entertain it
[1:31:45] amen change your confession to match
[1:31:47] your experience

[1:35:12] that the pillar of fire is with us
[1:35:16] you know brother batman said in the
[1:35:18] third exodus that pillar of fire is here
[1:35:21] to lead us on to the millennium
[1:35:24] so we know that whether we feel it

[1:36:03] really brings a meaning whether it's a

[1:36:12] into this church
[1:36:14] that we can have tremendous meetings
[1:36:16] right here

[1:36:44] the kind of creation you can bring in
[1:36:46] your home
[1:36:49] when everything is all tore up and
[1:36:50] everything else and let the holy spirit
[1:36:52] come in
[1:36:53] like a dove
[1:36:55] and settle the whole situation
[1:36:58] and god good
