time my amen is he worthy of it tonight amen would you stand to your feet with us amen I I know he's worthy of it all this is the this is the hour uh of the time you remember when the Bible said that the kinsman redeemer Mr Boaz went to the gate and testified that Ruth was his Kinsmen through Naomi and when he got done with his testimony the Bible tells us that he he he would have received a worthiness from the elders would have spoke back and said you fulfilled the law and when you read the book of Revelations and you find that our lord Jesus stood up as our Kinsmen and when he proved that he was kin to you and I and he said these are my Kinfolk he was testifying the Bible said to 24 Elders that was 12 New Testament and 12 Old Testament and when he got done with his testimony these men who knew the law who knew the requirement of the Kinsmen they took off their crowns and they throwed them on the ground and said Worthy he's worthy he's worthy of our of our kinsmanship tonight I'd still believe he's worthy I still believe he's worthy the prophet of God said this is the time of King lamb worship it's when the book has been opened up and the redeemed and all the Earth began to worship our lord for what he's done for us you know friends we are setting in one of the greatest seats in the history of time brother mental there's been a lot of people whose names in the Lamb's Book of Life but this is the first generation that have known their names as in the Lamb's Book of Life in the ministry of this age has the benefit of preaching to people who they know is in the Lamb's Book of Life and will appear into Glory I tell you it's the most powerful time to preach the gospel it's the most powerful time to worship Christ it's a season like no other has ever been you know you you have literally been put here in this time in this age to stand perfectly sinless and to worship God as a person who has no sin at all before almighty God friends I tell you we we should give worship like we never have we should honor him in the power of his blood like it's never been you know uh being being a little bit of a hillbilly and simple growing up we uh we just you know uh we work for some engineers and things later in our lives and I worked as an inspector for a time over a city and the city engineer I worked just under one and then there's a engineer over the whole area in the mayor and and I was working in there and one day a bunch of them had a little problem on one of the road jobs and they didn't like something on the cross and so the mayor and the city engineer got together and they invited me to lunch and they kind of bypassed my personal boss that one just over me and I went to lunch with them all and I seen what they were doing brother Ray the minute I saw it I said look folks you all have to talk to my boss I'm out of here I'm not I don't want nothing to do with this all right this is going to get me in a lot of trouble so I went that evening and and was going to leave my office and and the engineer just over me he called me he said blank I see your minutes I won his office sister Barbies very angry at me and he starts saying you you went around me and you've talked to the mayor and you've did this and you did this and when I was listening to him I knew I didn't So I listened to him and when he got done I said sir I didn't do that my apologies I know it could look like that I did but I'm not guilty at all of doing that and he said well I don't want to investigate it and I'll see you tomorrow I said oh well then please do you know investigate it so tomorrow afternoon he called me in the office and he looked right at me and brother Mike he said to me he said Dwayne he said I've investigated this he said and you've been exonerated well in my short vocabulary the word ex ex-wife X job X everything that X meant it's over so I didn't know anything what he was saying so I just stopped him and I said sir forgive me but what does exonerated mean anyhow he said well it means you're not guilty I said well I knew that already I knew I wasn't guilty but you know I had just been accused of something but really I had never done it in the first place and the Bride of Jesus Christ has been exonerated in this age and we've had a prophet to say that God has put you to a place that not only were you forgiven you have been Justified and friends if we can't Worship in this time how we are to put our hearts together and praise God Amen tonight we have a man of God a brother brother Ron Spencer's come all the way from

his home from his church from his family to come here and to speak to us at such a time like this now I know God is going to use our brothers special tonight amen how many come for a need you got

God's been rich in Mercy to us he's been rich in Mercy again we certainly love him with all of our hearts and we may have to fight some things down here but it won't mean nothing foreign it all comes to make us better people I would like to thank you personally thank you for your prayers when you call my name across your lips in prayer you're talking to the greatest physician and the greatest King that ever lived I'm your friend and I'm your buddy here but I'm also his son and he cares and he answers and the moments you think that you can't take another day he comes on the scene just doesn't work for you it just doesn't work for you I'm so thrilled to have sister Connie with me she's she's a special girl and so we just love her with all of my heart and yeah she was for me and so we thank the Lord that we've enjoyed life's journey together and I want many more days with her we may be fighting for our life but we're every day is a miracle every day is a miracle I know there's doctors that are here thank you for what you do I really appreciate that and the nurses that work with them thank you for that I've got special doctors that are very good to me and I just saw them I saw them Wednesday and did all the scans Wednesday on the brain and and uh got a wonderful report that the cancer is not growing it's stable stay on the chemo twice a day and that's what we're doing and just believing God every day addicting medicines to kind of help me give me a better quality of life and so amen I enjoy my grandbabies too much right now too Amen to have it any other way we love you we love you with all of our hearts amen maybe you just look over at your neighbor and say brother Ron loves you brother on that's awkward well I may not be able to tell you personally but I want you to know that with all my heart I mean that with all my heart well I thought they were going to sing my sermon and preach it as well with brother Wayne and so I was just going to go out the back door and say have at it to speak to you to you a little while on he sent his seat into the Earth right if you will turn with me to Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 1. it's a very powerful scripture and sometimes we read scriptures and we just kind of go across it but we don't realize the power every word is a and every seed has the life within itself to reproduce itself and it's got power within that seed word that's why you as a group of people are so powerful you're operating as an amateur God on the Earth here you are in laodicea in Sodom condition the darkest age that there is and you're in the bride's Revival not looking to it you're enjoying it well one day one day we'll realize that that day's here and we're not looking for it anymore we're enjoying it and it's going to give you a body change because it has the power within itself to do it no longer a quote no longer just a good thought but Sarah changed and so did Abraham amen God bless you and that same Mighty angel came to tell you yeah you're getting ready to get a mighty change amen amen Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 1. think about what it would be like for the Lord Jesus to borrow a boat to preach to us tonight and the same day went Jesus out of the house and set by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying behold A sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air came and devoured them all and some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth for with they sprung up because they had no deepness of the Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no they withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them but others fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some a hundredfold some 64 some 34. who have ears to hear Let Him hear and the disciples came and said unto them why speaketh thou unto them in perilous and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him it shall be given and he hath more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away evens at the path therefore speaking to them in Parables because seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saying by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and see and you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time that they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and shouldn't and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I shall build them what a powerful word and I shall build them and blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for barely I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them yet shall we have church may God bless the reading of his word and you exceeded Hallelujah now Paul would be one that would not be there in his Earthly Ministry but he would be one that would meet him in a pillar of fire form many of us never sat personally to hear the prophet of God but when we heard that voice behind The Voice brother random story became more than a story a caribou became more than a caribou squirrels became more than just squirrels and we kind of set like that little lady Hattie that said that's absolutely the truth brother Brown and something on the inside of you responded and you knew that you had looked for something maybe all of your life and you'd heard a lot of voices but when you heard this voice it don't take 10 years or five years it's just a moment it just changes your life maybe a friend sitting beside of you they they don't catch anything but something on the inside of you it just it just moves you and Jesus is taking his time on the boat and as he's taken his time he knows who he's speaking to because he's so sore and he knows he sent them in the Earth for a certain time in a certain age because we realize that you're born never a sign and and sometimes would get so antsy about a child coming to the Earth that's you know will it come today will it come on my birthday will it come on our anniversary will it be convenient when it comes it comes exactly what God wants it to come because he's got to be born under a certain birth pattern and God was like a great contractor when he was laying out the Earth and he laid out the potassium and the potassium and all the chemicals of your body he knew where even your mother would eat your body out of the Earth now God was very attentive to your DNA because you're going to Temple eternal life inside of that now your your flesh he wanted it to have a certain characteristic certain color of hair and a certain eye color to be a certain build and he'd have some of you skinny and some of you fluffy God don't get nervous about none of that you know we don't pattern after Hollywood if God made us wonderfully made and and as a matter of fact even your spirit down to your fathers God watched over and protected that seed all the way down Wars and turmoils and coming to America in the bottom of a ship he watched over that he crossed bombs not to go off because a certain man was carrying your natural seed in a very simple little sermon brother Brown calls it one in a million and what you don't realize that 999 999 died needing no funeral but you were predestinated to life and if he could watch over your natural seed that much in his great pre-planet being the sower of his seed on the Earth knowing what messenger you would be under the influence of that messenger and what you would do with it I want you just think in another realm there was another enemy that was watching now he's always been in the Border he's always been about abortion there's a real reason for it he's trying to kill God's seed because that seed is eternal and he's trying to poison it he's trying to deter it he killed literally incredible Generations trying to get Moses and and We Know by the prophet God has a sense of humor he just allowed him to be put in a basket dispatched Angels even Gabriel to stand on the on the little basket and let him go down a crocodile infested water and as you go down that water he said when the crocodiles come up just put your foot on now you couldn't see that realm but God had tens of thousands of angels to watch over Moses the natural seed you're not alone you're never alone you'll never be alone when you feel that you're loneliest God's got dispatched angels to watch over you you're better protected than the president of the United States of America amen now remember you're as Eternal as Jesus is what our Prophet told us that seed is eternal as he is so he took a photo album and put it together of you at your best no not 18 years old or 21 years old but before the foundation of the world amen I find it so interesting that brother Branham would talk about Michelangelo Beethoven and Shakespeare because he had been in contact or in Fellowship with the greatest architect that there's ever been and you know when you can realize that God has architect your life don't let your situations around you overwhelm you you were built to live here [Applause] [Music] you've all recorded it but I'm gonna quote it the hour is here if I could have been back there before the days of the world was created and looked down and sing the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live I would say it right now right now this is the hour this is the greatest power that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the Lord quite powerful isn't it Paul being a powerful messenger and maybe we didn't hear his sermons so we had the great luxury of having some of his quotes written down so I want to read you a couple of these quotes is that okay and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called and that day is very specific yeah they called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of my many Brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified so the process in God's mind is already complete [Applause] you may not feel it yet but in God's mind it's already a finished work [Music] you're praying for your prodigals to come home but in God's mind it's already God you're ringing your hands and you're tore all the pieces about it but in God's mind he'll not lose one he'll not lose one now what should we then say to these things if it's signed sealed and delivered what shall we then say to these things if God before us let's just settle it right here if God before us all of Hell could be against us he that spared not his son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely give us all things it all belongs to us now Paul is going to call the devil right out in the street so we will call him a a gunslinger or a sword Slinger who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect who is going to come out and tell us about our past what demon is going to try to condemn us over and over again that's already Justified us and if he's Justified as it's as though we never did it in the first place it may be etched into your memory but not with God and Satan may have an Avenue to go through your memory Channel come on but that's not you it may look like the same house it may look like the same building but that there's a different King that is living down on the inside of that heart you're not that man no longer oh maybe you've got friends that were drug addicts with you or no parents or whatever they did with you and they may know the old man but that man don't live here no more [Applause] so therefore there is now no condemnation the deed is clear it's not held against us no more we don't need to go to jail for it we don't need to go to hell for it we don't need to beat ourselves for it we don't need Purgatory for it it's inclusion still delivered we have a rich jury we have a rip jury he's our lawyer and he's a passionate lawyer he's our judge and he's a passionate judge and he's also the jury I tell you what it feels like we don't have church in here we're going to have church up in here now Jesus knows the seat that he planted on the inside of you he doesn't just do that to see if he can he just doesn't deposit a seed in you well I'll pick this one up I'll pick that one I'll pick this one all right I'll pick that one he knows exactly what he's doing no he's not dependent on your flesh right he has that's not what he's interested in he'll change that after a while but he's going to put a king on the inside of your heart it may lay their dormant for a long time but all of a sudden that seat gets in the right atmosphere and gets quick into life I trust we believe that that safe gets quick and alive it's not a man planet that God planted that's what so confuses the devil so many times he's trying to destroy God's seed but he can't see where God deposited that because you and I would have never picked a naked man cursing on the boat but Jesus did [Applause] many of us would have never picked a woman at the well but Jesus did many of us would have never picked a woman that washes his feet but Jesus did many of us would have never picked our neighbor sitting in this church but Jesus did [Applause] thank you Lord now Jesus and his party birds are going to say these words and Jesus came and spake it to them say all power is given unto me heaven and in Earth now he's not just going to keep that power but he's going to ignite the seed inside of you to be able to use that Jesus would say these words if he abide in me and my words eternal life scene abide in you now you're going to do something with it you shall ask what you wear and it shall be done unto you there's a process that we go through many times we want things and forget to ask but there's a power release between you and father when you take its words and processes across your lips because remember prayer is more powerful than an atomic bomb your because you're a son and daughter that's what gives you Authority notice what brother random said who has more Authority an archangel in heaven they're servants whether man places it their servants he said a son and daughter of God has more Authority than an archangel listen we'd all be thrilled if Gabriel stepped into the room and we could visibly see him what a service that we'd walk away with but you set beside people that's more powerful [Applause] did you get it oh my brother on I went to a service and we saw an angel of the Lord you set beside [Music] you sat beside people that's more powerful hey we can feel the influence of the Angel here now we feel him here we enjoy it you sung about him and he came and the reason he comes is because seeds are sitting here he don't come just to come he comes to worship with you [Applause] your his vision it's not Michelangelo standing with inspiration after all those years working and saying Speak because the Visions Now set before it listen this message came more than just to put it on a tape and put it in book form and be a good message it was depositing Siege all over the Earth God's been on a mission and he's watching you stand on the clap of Eternity dimensions are blooming you don't have to work up a Revival he's here [Applause] brother run but I'm afraid of emotion let me just say this to you if you don't get emotional about this I'm afraid no seed has come to life and it's still laying dormant this is the greatest thing that we can have brother Brown said God's purpose about the master of this day we can just say the greatest messenger that ever lived on the Earth but yet stood in such a humble form until the world Misty I like how brother Branham says it he says those they're seraphants he says when Matthew was writing Matthew 28 and 19. he was guarding the book of Acts the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said he stands there and he said he blinds the eyes to where they can't get it but when it came to you he made sure you'd see it so brother Brandon preached to a lot of audience that were very combative with him get up walk out preacher set behind him making fun of him and doing all different kinds of things and and yet he was the one that was in contact with the messenger the author of the book and so he was just saying what he taught him to say because just as Jesus stood on the boat no and I've sold the seeds and some fall on stones and some fall into thorns and and some fall this but I've deposited seed in the ground I'm like a great contractor I've deposited seats in the ground I know where they're going to come up at now listen when God's ahead of a project I don't know if we have any project managers in here you don't quit in the middle of it it's pretty immature a lot of people want to quit in the middle of the middle middle of it God's not that kind sure he knew there was going to be issues that you would have but he fortified you with the greatest weapon that he could and gave you a channel to which you could talk to him and you could tell him oh god I've been a fool oh God I'm a rich or miserable ratchet oh god I've made so many mistakes today and oh God I'm I made a temper tanterman God didn't even he doing your time around that you were wrestling with your flesh and wrestling with laodicea and he knew you were fighting and struggling but all of that's just stuff [Applause] oh that's your stuff but God I'm getting older I'm past 90 past 100 you said I'd have a child it didn't make God nervous none whatsoever when I got the Rapture would be happening and the resurrection would take place it don't make God nervous I want you I want you to know he's not in a crisis meeting tonight [Applause] and the adversary that he built and he sent him into the Earth he specifically sent him into the Earth to torment you and try you and God made him he made it he describes it and then at the end of it the very next paragraph and the quote says no weapon that is formed against thee [Applause] so God's got your battle settled [Applause] I don't know who I'm talking to but I'm just going to talk to you so you see I've never preached this at home so maybe they'll enjoy it when I get back home maybe you can text or send some of our people at home it's good you're going to enjoy it so when God deposits a seat he's not worried about your 155 pound flesh you left me out with one okay 320. 90 pound lady he's not concerned about that flesh because the seeds got power within itself [Music] and when the Old King dies and the King takes over he'll take over your mouth he'll take over your thinking [Applause] he'll take over your eyes and you'll wrestling with this flesh but you know who's gonna win now brother Brandon uses this quote I I don't mean to abuse it but he says he knows that if the people yet the true revelation of the true church and what she is that's a specific purpose and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works [Applause] brother Ron they powerful group of people you're missing the total point he's not just talking about preachers don't you get your eyes on whoever's standing up here you always be attentive to the voice behind The Voice because that voice is a discerner of your heart [Applause] the middle you and I we can have secrets of the tree and a guy that can get up and preach that can't preach his way out of a paperback if God anoints that man there will be one sentence in that hour sermon and you go that was for me I've had people walk up and say I'm sorry everybody else had to come just for me to get that sermon because you realize that this this we are as ministers are very we hate gossip powers because discernment can't work with a gossip party and the work don't need a gossip for her [Applause] so all of a sudden the preacher's preaching and he's in your living room he's in your car coming to church [Applause] and all of a sudden you realize hey somebody was in the car duh [Applause] hey that's from Virginia it's okay we'll get through it yeah we'll get through it now when brother Brandon was staying this this particular sentence he said I'm so glad that a man can sow completely serve God tell the devil don't know what to do with him [Applause] now God just don't drop that sentence for a fairy tale he's got seed on the Earth that he could put their life story in that they're not wishy-washy they're not tossed about on a seed let the world coming upside down and they are still having victory but the man who uses this term he says Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you now I'm dropping that sentence there because I am a living reality of that quote [Applause] so it's not just a Hollywood quote here it's not just Walt Disney quote here God is going to have a people that can have that short hanging over them and instead of cancer be way out front and getting all the glory it'll be like Joshua and Caleb sure there's Giants over there but it's a good land it's a good land sure I've got four stage cancer I'm not crazy tumors on my temples and stuff going in my head and taking chemo every day some days are good days some days are really bad days tumors in my lungs in my lymph nodes but the miracle is I get to live every day when I wake up in the morning the devil ought to be terrified of what God's about to do today [Applause] I don't want to be a whiny Fox negative atmosphere huh an overcomer [Applause] because brother random had a conversation about me in a cave she wasn't just mythically talking right the angel was in a cave with him giving him his permission and he was telling me we couldn't do it you know I'll be with you they had the conversation that came to a point to where that he would even talk about how that everything would be subject it wasn't the angel that brought up cancer it was brother Brown and he said not even cancer so if you're suffering from cancer today brother Brown had a conversation in the cave with your condition you do not have to live to it dominated and scared of it and negative of it because in God's mind it's already defeated [Applause] Hey listen either these quotes are real or they're not real I happen to believe that so I want to read that quote again to you Satan cannot put your life and living proof he's trapped and if he could he would because I make them mad every week I'm not reading poetry here I'm not being real soft to the church I'm I'm motivating you encouraging you strengthen you telling you to put your boots on and pull your sword and fight we're not a bunch of cowards we're rugged everyday Christians we're warriors in this end time we will overcome I'm not giving you a political speech I'm telling you we are built in the mind of God we were the seeds that were distributed in the earth and now we're here to take a rapture [Applause] and so we stand here I believe I can stand here like probably no other man could stand four stage brain cancer and take this quote and make it live and you could say I haven't seen a miracle look open your brown eyes blue eyes red eyes gray eyes whatever you got and look [Applause] you're looking this way in a miracle I'm looking that way [Applause] what do you mean brother Ron Satan's done everything that he could to destroy you he's forever devil against you and dispatched them to torment your life and you're still standing some of you really would be into depression if you realize how many demons were fighting and how often they have to go back to hell and say I couldn't they still got up and went to church Sunday they rolled out of bed and they prayed and their prayers went right to the king of glory and he heard them and he dispatched angels to take care of them they're better protective than the president of the United States of America he's just forgetful but you're as children of God you call God's word and say this works for me [Applause] I know we hear this a lot of times final voice to the final age search it no other messenger said no other charismatic preacher said but the one that was standing there in the book was on opened and he stood there and said this is not my thoughts he met me in the room I would have made a horrible mistake but he can't you see the author of the book walked into the room this was not going to be a denominational bride [Applause] this was going to the seeds of eternal life that would capture this word and he would give Insurance like future home because that's what you're going to live in who is this male president because that same melchizedek's walking among you even now [Applause] he would give him a sermon like things that are to be talking about a prophetic message just go to the title yes sir there are to be we're not built kingdoms here we've got nice churches but we're going to leave this we sat in a service like this maybe you're sitting here and you're fighting a kidney infection bad back you're just fighting to keep your attention because you had to work so long you know you know he knows everything and you're going you know well that service you know I didn't get nothing out of it well what you don't realize that it's not over with when you walk out and your Earth your your ears hurt things that you couldn't comprehend maybe four or five days later two weeks later all of a sudden it hits you [Applause] and the light comes on final voice to the final age brother men oh God made you a promise in this generation this generation you know God ain't done with you I just want to tell you God's not done with you he's not it's not done at all as a matter of fact guys like you are the most dangerous guys they're the most dangerous guy he's probably got 40 50 years of preaching what's an interesting thing is I was a boy playing a set of drums on brother fulcher's pulpit in Christian's birth and this guy with a bunch of other men Come and sing it was it was like heaven drop dead and that God y'all have a boy he comes over and pays me special attention I know you don't remember but I do and here we set tonight we're gonna put all of this together recently brother Tim Pruitt sent me a a picture he was 18 years old and he went to he went to Jeffersonville and you know as a boy he thought Minister said on the platform so he took his place on the platform all the other guys wasn't preachers they took his picture there he is sitting there 18 years old and I looked at it and asked him when it was I started collating the dates well I was in the same meeting and we couldn't get a seat out front so my dad and myself sat in the baptistry now think about it Tim bro one of the greatest preachers ever lives don't know that the the seats are for other people he just and saying just a couple feet behind the the curtain is another one of these boys don't God have a sense in here foreign he knew where he planted you you thought now you thought you staggered into a mission house somewhere another you thought by incidents that you were being called and all of a sudden you find yourself at the altar and you're giving your heart to God it's only the beginning of your life so I was talking about brother minnow and I'm not done it's not Alzheimer's came up and so the devil says Ah he's old he won't bother me now think again you got 40 Years of ministry 50 years of ministry you swatted a lot of devils don't you know your prayer shakes the kingdom of hell and there's no order like an old Warrior I'm talking to you Ray you're not dying [Applause] who gathered us who gathered us Saskatoon where it's blue blaze is called these guys are going to get a special spot in heaven when the wind blows it really blows I'm a when it comes to cold air I'm I'm an assistant I like a stove I like heat the more blood thinners I'm on the more heat I need Connie's gonna live through it she's going to lift up but who gathered us Jude brother who gathered us I said Brother Ray I'm sorry we're friends yeah you want a quote for that brother Brown said if you let me calling me Bill [Applause] I caught that a second ago who gathered us who put us all together here no man could do that I don't care how great a personality a preacher is and when I gather to a personality of a Preacher you look long enough you're going to find mistakes in men [Applause] oh brother Ron I can't believe you got no States ask that girl never mind so who gathered us the infinite God who knows every time that a that a fly or a flea would bet its eyes that's set in things that are to be he preplans you that infinite God pre-planned you and it don't just do it to do it so if God condensated his way through the Old Testament then he condescended his way through the New Testament and he says that you're the final voice he's got something on his mind then the work that you're listening to I always get it I always get forgive me I'm just going to tell you my heart I've been a very emotional person we have an emotional we Shout when he Rejoice don't get cold on me now we Shout people stand to their feet and applaud while the word's going forward and they're inspired well brother we're mature I would say sometimes rotten because the word has the power to take motorcycle gang guys and make real Christians out of them to take women of the red light district and make real daughters of God out of them and when you look in the audience you can't tell who's who [Applause] so let me just say this to you when you I'm gonna pick on you when you've got a guy like Ben Erickson leading you in worship around the revealed word of the hour and it causes emotion in the church and an atmosphere to take place and the littlest children hit the floor [Applause] because Scott's going to raise those Limitless children up because even as a child they recognize the atmosphere I need a quote brother on you picked the right man Jesus is riding off of the mountain on a coat and for that description to be right it had to have never been Monroe it would have to be a miracle when they put a blanket on him and Jesus gets on it a phenomenal Miracle but you see what you can't see is he was the master [Applause] and not only are you designed God designed that cult to ride him off in Perfect Harmony and perfect peace and he rides down and everybody's under the inspiration of worship and that was something that had said caused him to get quiet they don't now why would I drop that right there your worship's important because nobody can worship God like his children charismatic worship people worship people worship a lot of different gods people in big ball games worship the devil don't get upset at Ohio State come on okay some of you across the border he don't get upset with Purdue he don't get upset when you're screaming and pulling your shirt off and screaming touchdown but the devil gets upset when you recognize Who You Are and you recognize your position that I am a son that's my husband that's my God broken they're not going back to him so therefore I'm not going to wait on streets of gold I'm not going to wait on streets of gold to display my love for him and I'm gonna do it with passion you're gonna get beside myself I have to fight this thing all week long but when I get into his atmosphere where I feel him [Applause] I want you to think what a big statement that is I came from God yeah and I'm going back to God I'm sorry I don't go crazy like I used to but this is just a different gear sometimes you just have to reinvent yourself sometimes I just have to catch my breath can you get can you give me that now I don't want you to think about that that's more than just final voice to the final age it's more than just I came from God but I'm going back to God but you see the photo album is now flesh and you've received a message that told you that and you caught it and Jesus would say blessed are their ears they hear blessed are their eyes they see now don't worry about the people that don't believe don't wrestle yourself much with that you know you can't make them believe you can't make goats cheap you couldn't make yourself anything but one day you just woke up come on wow that's a truth and you may set 10 years in this church what's really going on let's go you know I don't know believe this or not you know they get emotional here and they scream and they preach two hours and you know I got things to do well what is that at Burger King what are you gonna do then and he'll start worrying in your mind about your car the house these kind of things distracting you because he knows then all of a sudden you realize that hey he's talking about me it's talking about me sometimes teenagers as they're growing up and it's you know they're coming to church because Mom and Dad's bringing them to church yeah and then all of a sudden in a service boom boom now they're at church with purpose [Applause] now they're coughing their hands with paraplex I'm going there somewhere [Applause] now there ain't many with purpose [Applause] when you realize you're living your life with purpose when I was in China preaching and I spoke I spoke about we must get to Jesus and Jarius had to leave his house and had to leave his position had to leave his reputation because his daughter was dying and he couldn't help her he went to a source and it was the only source he could knew that was real and when he finally got to him and caught his attention Jesus said I'll come with you and then people came and said she's dying don't don't trouble and Jesus notice what he does standing in Two Worlds at the same time he said don't fear don't fear because Jesus knew she was getting ready to come to life and I'm going somewhere here he already knows where you're going it's not you just saying I came from God going back to God God knows that you're coming so I'm in China preaching to about 200 people in a building that's jam-packed and all of us could get arrested and I'm preaching and as I'm preaching brother Murphy warm collapses on the pulpit I had to wait till he finished because I don't speak Chinese my brother Murphy collapses because we realize that Jesus is orchestrated this meeting and if we could realize that it's not just in China or in Saskatoon or in Lima or in Virginia God orchestrates the service what ensued was a six hour prayer line there was a lady who walked across the stage she was about your your bill your height and the Lord spoke through me to her through brother Murphy Wong you're a woman of great influence and you're over many people told her the needs of her heart and brother minnow she spoke to brother Murphy and said oh the doctor of an entire Hospital I had no way of knowing I know you as a doctor and I have great admiration because you're an agent on the Earth right amen you may have struggle and want and to be a doctor and you studied a lot of long hours and it's because of you're going to be of great help to humanity the very next woman was a woman that heard some of the same words you're a woman of great influence you're a powerful woman she was over a hundred a hundred underground churches and she took this message to a hundred Underground it's more than just a statement I'll not lose one China can do what they want to do to shut it down Russia can do what they want to do to shut it down this Sodom and Gomorrah government that we've got can do what they want to do just shut it down it's too late the seeds already been deposited they will come up they will come up that may be 40 feet deep but they will come out they may be in the deepest time but they will come on [Applause] amen I just tell you one more story brother Brown talks in the greatest battle ever fought and he goes back you know he's not under the direction of his own mind because he said you're not feeding a mind of a man defeating on the body work of the son of a man so he's in the middle of the greatest battle it's ever fought and of all the people he picks he picks a man named Peter Cartwright and so Peter Cartwright you remember maybe for those that don't know Peter Cartman was the man that was led to go to a town to have a Revival he didn't ask nobody just found an empty building started cleaning it up went in and started cleaning the windows and a bully of the Town came and said you can't have emotional worship here you you you you you can't have a meeting here and so he lays out the boundary the devil's always in a problem when he lays out the boundary he said to have a meeting here you're going to have to whip me first well he was talking to the wrong preacher because God had a seed sinned into the Earth that would accept the challenge and so Peter Cartwright climbs down off of his ladder rolls up his sleeves should hear Brother Brown and describe it just like he's standing there I would say probably once and he sees the vision of how he did it he rolls up his sleeves and he whips the man now you may not know this but Peter can't wait was at another meeting and he was at another meeting and 30 men walked in and Disturbed the service I'd probably cause a church split if it happened today 30 men was going to shut it down well if I could say this in the right way probably 30 devils and our average service wants to walk in and shut the spirit of God down and there was a lot of preachers there but Peter Cartwright jumped right down and begin to whip one at a time and when he got done 30 men was whipped I'm preaching to you a god with purpose I'm talking about one of his sin I tell you where Peter Cartwright came from my area listen there's no Yankee heaven and there's no Southern habit it's all heaven but God knew where your dirt was going to come from [Applause] it's on Sunday morning after a Wednesday night whipping 30 men all the preachers said I can't get under any inspiration to preach he said well I can't and he walked to the pulpit and preached a sermon called the Gates of Hell shall not prevail [Applause] and the meeting lasted all day Sunday and on my Sunday night and all day Monday and all night Monday night and all day Tuesday on Tuesday night and on Wednesday they baptized over 300 people [Music] that's the kind of spiritual DNA that he put on the inside of you and the stupid death that wants to fight it he can't realize where we came from and where we're going he's just trying to disturb the trip too late I got two more quotes for you and I'm done I'm whipped God allowed this to be said himself in Revelation chapter 19. he said let us be glad and rejoice for the Lamb's wife has made herself ready that was said 2 000 years ago I want you to think our Prophet said your natural seed was on the Earth probably some of them were the meanest Rascals ever lived so don't go bragging you ought to know my family no no my friend my family came from I was born in royalty and I came to the president I may look like Teddy and I've got pictures of him on my wall and I like a lot of things he did I'm sorry I'm going to step out here just a minute the last time brother biscal and myself was here preaching brother Bissell said about right there and he he told me later he said brother Ron I'm sorry he said I could help and helped but think as I was sitting there watching you he said I thought well this is what Teddy Roosevelt would have been as a preacher [Applause] I don't want you to think about it what you think about it just for a minute God knew what you'd look like they knew your characteristics he knew everything about you you remember when we were standing in a stairwell many years ago I'm pointing at you just go ahead and raise your hand so you know who I'm talking about yeah you know black-headed got glasses on right there Richard get your wife to raise her hand she hadn't got it yet some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow okay we pray for you to have children you remember that she was standing in the in the stairwell and she said I didn't know how many I was gonna have and maybe you're sitting here and going I'm trying to have a child don't you worry [Music] God knows what it is deposited it's impossible if it's a seed there it's going to come up amen it's going to come up God's not nervous you can't have children you got one standing on the other side that knows all of this message that knows this message is real this experience that she's about 18 19 years old and she's in perfect health [Applause] and here's the whole deal she knows you're coming now maybe for people that don't know when brother Branham was there and he saw his daughter she talked to him about the things that he heard on Earth and he preached on Earth yeah you preached this listen she dies as an infant listen death ain't nothing to fear you guys just experienced it Brother David as your family your father your mother stepped from this Dimension and in a second in a second all of these quotes were real David if I can say this as a friend she knows you're coming I'm in my closing statements everything Ken talked about my last conversation with him he was one of the most positive people I ever knew and I talked to him about two weeks before his going I'll remember where I was at we were crossing the bridge and we had a conversation I called to encourage him and he accepted the challenge and encouraged me because in actuality he was better off than I was and he was fighting cancer and he was getting ready to take a a little trip and I was getting ready to fight what he was fighting so I needed the sermon that he gave me I knew you was going to be here so I put that there so sometimes you're sitting in church and don't know why a preacher's saying what he's saying but the god knows what you're going to face two weeks from now the last time I was here I addressed this audience in my opening comments about maybe not being here ever again I don't know why I was saying that but brother Tom I was saying that Charlie his way you went through some incredible tragedies but if we could look at that all of these quotes became a living reality in a moment and if I can say it right Satan gets no credit [Applause] so those he knew he justified them he called them he justified them and he's glorified them so if we could look at this book more than a history book but this is God's thoughts when he turns to his disciples and he said I go to prepare a place for you is that where I am there you may be awesome and if I can say this just the way that I need to there's a married supper brother Brown describes it hundreds of miles well 1500 miles I believe it's a statement there's not going to be an extra check now I'm saying it quietly but I feel like doing a cartwheel I've never done one but if you could see the inside of me I feel like shouting all over this building because God not only sees me standing here preaching this meeting but he sees what I'm going to sit thank you if you get this Satan's going to have a hard time Monday now I've kind of told you where you came from you mind if I tell you your future sure and I saw a new habit yeah it's not John's words it's his words kind of new Earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away so don't get so attached to this and there was no more Street Zach he'll provide fish you know somewhere Zachary is your hand right there you go it'll be all right Zach's kind of like Peter you know brother Branham says it so eloquently he said you always have a hook in his pocket now your wife might not enjoy it as much as you do but always have a hook in your pocket program and I John saw the holy city a New Jerusalem you're talking about standing in Two Worlds at the same time yeah yeah well the brand would say that prayer line she said I'm standing in Two Worlds a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride of dornford her husband amen and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the tabernacleism is of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God not just the service no Timex is there and God shall wipe away all tears [Music] now I want to read this to them and there shall be no more death neither sorrow or crying and there shall be there and there shall be any more pain for the former things and he that set upon the throne said behold so why should I fear cancer why should I have a pity party why should we be whiny boxes service is more than service God's talking about I want you to turn to your neighbor and say God's been talking about you the last 61 minutes I got the timer right here Give the Lord Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah aren't you glad he said on this long thing so when God builds a man we don't really know the man until we see his work you think we know him in fact we know his attributes but it's just like a man when he marries a wife we see the inside of him because he marries a wife that would reflect the character so Ben and that perfect body walk from the back of the church to the front of the church because he knows his position what you don't realize is is when he begins to sing it displays a gift from God yeah and God called him to be a worship Warrior now Ben it'll make every devil in hell mad but you're not here to please them to start off with because God built you like he built them to display his work and then you see the gift of God in operation oh my brother Ron I recognize your gift as brother Branham well God didn't leave it all just for brother Brian he gave you gifts and maybe yours is not Ben's because we don't want to be somebody else but when you hear a guy like Ben maybe my boy at home I've kind of been like brother Ray's situation brother Wayne's I got a young pastor at home too his name's Andrew some of you met him some of you probably like him yeah but when he takes the pulpit he's kind of like this guy over here and he just starts singing and he creates an atmosphere I wanna I wanna come to the end of this just a moment God's got purpose for guys like this because when they create an atmosphere you don't realize it but thousands of angels have come to worship with you [Music] and then you engage them to worship because Worthy is the Lamb and you're singing more than just inspired words amen but those words are going out of your lips Like a Prayer and you begin to worship and go into another Realm and then your worship takes on a different element because you may feel like dirt but you're creating an atmosphere for the master and you're stirring up that God that's on the inside of you and as you worship you worship because he built you to worship these are just buildings those are just pews but that which he designed you to be nobody worships like you maybe I can touch that a little bit more how do you know when you get that soul mate even science tells us that her giggle will calm you because you stepped out of Eternity in the time and I pray with all my prayers [Music] that she and I can step back into eternity again but if I get ahead I'll be standing waiting if I get ahead of you when you cross I'll be your best day manner [Music] oh what a God we have could we worship him a little bit brother [Music] [Music] we hungry How great is our God [Music] I will see my grace [Music] [Applause] let all the Earth Rejoice all your dreams he wraps himself [Music] of God he's the neighborhood [Music] of my [Music] name [Music] away it is our God have Grace our God [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] in my heart [Music] Our God for his name for [Music] [Applause] you [Music] how quick is our God [Music] oh how great is our God sing with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I think about the Lord how he saved me how he raised me how he filled me with the Holy Ghost how he healed me to judge must when I think about the Lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] it makes me wanna shout [Applause] all right [Music] [Applause] makes me thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor and all the praise when I think when I think [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] most when I think about and turn me around how is my feet [Music] Lord you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor and all the grace it makes me want to shine [Applause] [Music] thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy of all the glory and all the honors [Music] [Applause] I don't know who told you you would not make it I don't know who told you you could not take it I don't know before you it's time to quit but my God says wait it ain't over yet [Music] I don't know who told you not make it I don't know who told you not take take no no time that you with my God my God stands way it ain't over yet somebody here
