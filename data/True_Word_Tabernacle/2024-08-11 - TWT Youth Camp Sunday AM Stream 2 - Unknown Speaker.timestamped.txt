[5:45] everybody amen we've certainly been
[5:47] blessed in these
[5:49] meetings with the quality of the word of
[5:52] brother Josh and brother Andrew it's
[5:55] tremendous it's it's it's do it's due
[5:59] season
[6:01] food for the Youth and for all of
[6:05] us uh this meeting came about
[6:10] uh when uh we were sitting in the about
[6:13] four years ago we were sitting in the
[6:15] church
[6:16] office Nathan was sitting there and he
[6:18] said say
[6:20] grandpa there's an
[6:22] opening at St Mary's Camp he said uh do
[6:26] you think we could have a youth camp and
[6:29] I had to ponder for a while because I
[6:31] know it's more than just having a youth
[6:34] camp takes a lot of
[6:36] workers but you know brother Ronnie long
[6:39] and I I don't want to just say about
[6:41] brother Nathan and brother Ronnie but
[6:42] their
[6:43] wives they put their heart and let's
[6:46] give
[6:57] them but I saw
[7:00] the vision just come to pass in Nathan's
[7:04] heart and brother Ronnie's heart it just
[7:08] and and and all the saints just got
[7:10] right behind it because I knew as I was
[7:13] sitting there pondering about whether
[7:16] should we have it or what but I knew
[7:19] that it was going to take a lot of work
[7:20] and you know not only the local church
[7:24] but you saints that have come and put
[7:26] your heart and soul into it to help help
[7:30] make this a success God bless you all
[7:33] for that
[7:44] amen we're living in a very crucial time
[7:48] amen and everything that God has for you
[7:52] should open your
[7:53] heart because this is the
[7:57] moment that the Bible was speaking
[8:00] about that to be an end time bride and
[8:04] there's never been a day like this day
[8:07] and you know the brothers for those that
[8:08] don't understand it you know they're
[8:10] saying you know talking about the
[8:12] message the message the message maybe
[8:14] some youth even don't even know what it
[8:16] is it's actually Jesus
[8:19] Christ the same yesterday today and
[8:22] forever amen and that's why you see what
[8:25] you
[8:26] see glory to God
[8:30] that's why you're
[8:34] see and as an elder I

[11:40] opportunity to just uh thank uh brother
[11:44] Nathan and brother Wayne brother brother
[11:47] Erikson for uh the invitation to be here
[11:50] and just be a part of these meetings and
[11:53] I I believe that we can say we've truly
[11:54] been blessed and amen we uh appreciate
[11:59] um brother Andrew Glover amen how many
[12:02] how many just appreciates brother
[12:03] Andrew's Ministry
[12:06] and I
[12:08] uh so
[12:10] thankful then you know I believe that
[12:12] God just give a brother Andrew just a
[12:15] special connection with the with the
[12:18] young people and uh we just thank God
[12:21] for that and and so um we're just happy
[12:24] to be here this morning and um I I
[12:27] believe that um brother Joe yeski is are
[12:31] they here this morning um maybe
[12:35] somewhere and uh we um brother Joel and
[12:39] sister Robin amen they um I understand
[12:42] that they've um God us put a child in
[12:46] their life and and um we um you know
[12:51] sometimes the
[12:53] circumstances um of um that um that
[12:58] surrounds things you know
[12:59] sometimes uh those circumstances can be
[13:03] uh you know so difficult and and there
[13:06] many problems that that that you know
[13:08] but I think about the the
[13:11] circumstances you know that um uh that
[13:15] brought the woman to the well that day
[13:18] and it was because of the circumstances
[13:21] of her life and why she was there at
[13:23] that time was brother R says she
[13:26] couldn't come to the well with all the
[13:27] other uh women women you know but it was
[13:30] because of those circumstances it
[13:32] brought her to the well at that time and
[13:36] and you know sometimes you think well
[13:37] things just happen by chance but not
[13:39] with God friends nothing happens by
[13:42] chance and somebody say well you know
[13:44] that was a mistake or you know maybe you
[13:47] know uh somebody have a child and they
[13:49] said that was a mistake but see God
[13:51] don't make no mistakes amen I believe
[13:54] that this morning and so they had a
[13:56] desire that we would just have prayer
[13:58] with him and over this uh young man that
[14:02] God has placed in their in their life
[14:04] and I believe they're in the process of
[14:06] maybe uh adopting him and so I I tell
[14:10] you um I thought about that uh my my
[14:14] wife was sharing with me some of the
[14:15] testimony of how God brought this to
[14:18] past and uh as I thought about it I
[14:20] thought about all the children all the
[14:23] little children in the world that would
[14:26] maybe
[14:27] be um you
[14:30] know under these circumstances but
[14:35] God would take
[14:39] one and bring him in a home like
[14:42] this and um listen friends God God he
[14:46] knows what he's doing this
[14:48] morning amen so maybe we just uh join
[14:52] together maybe some of the brothers
[14:53] would like to come this morning and just
[14:55] join with us amen what's his name Josiah
[14:59] amen amen we're just going to pray you
[15:02] know sometimes um with the with the
[15:06] circumstances um that these children are
[15:09] born in it has lasting effects uh on on
[15:12] them but we're just going to pray that
[15:15] that every every effect of the
[15:19] circumstances that he was born in would
[15:21] just be be washed away by the blood of
[15:24] Jesus Christ and amen
[15:31] this just again Lord Jesus Lord we thank
[15:34] you Lord for this family Lord as we look
[15:36] at this couple God lord and how that you
[15:39] have now blessed them and we know Lord
[15:41] that no matter how you give our children
[15:44] to us Lord whatever Channel or however

[15:49] children are a gift from you and they're

[15:57] All the Troubles and Lord and this young
[16:00] man has his birth Lord and the
[16:03] circumstances that surrounded but God
[16:05] lord I pray Lord that the power of God
[16:08] would just come and may the cleansing of
[16:10] the blood of Jesus Christ just wash away
[16:13] every Lord every impact of that out of
[16:16] his life and Lord I pray God as he
[16:18] brought him into this family now and as
[16:20] they begin to raise him in the fear and
[16:22] amination of God Lord that you would
[16:25] follow him all the days of his life oh
[16:28] god build a heds round about him like he
[16:30] did job that even Satan couldn't get to
[16:32] him Lord Lord I pray that at the
