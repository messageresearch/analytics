[4:46] this morning and if you have your Bibles
[4:49] we just like to go into the book of
[4:50] Ephesians I've been on a bit of a series
[4:52] here and um I uh I I don't know for sure
[4:57] how how we will handle this in the
[4:58] future not just maybe every service on
[5:00] it but I'm intending to go through the
[5:02] book If God would continue to give us
[5:05] Mercy uh I want to read Ephesians
[5:07] chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 um now being
[5:11] that I'm not a systematic preacher I or
[5:14] a teacher I I have to kind of preach the
[5:16] revelation of it so you you have to
[5:18] forgive me for my approach to it but uh
[5:21] the subject matter is here and if I took
[5:23] time we could tie a lot of it together
[5:25] but it it I I don't want it to get lost
[5:27] in the the tying together in CH 1 verse
[5:30] 9 and verse 10 having made known unto us
[5:34] the mystery of his
[5:36] will according to the good pleasure
[5:40] which he hath purposed in
[5:42] himself that in the
[5:45] dispensation and you could switch this
[5:47] word with a couple different ones but
[5:49] Administration is also a good one of the
[5:52] fullness of times he might gather
[5:55] together in one all things in Christ
[5:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[6:00] on earth even in him we ask the Lord to
[6:04] bless his word this morning and this
[6:06] part um you could be seated yeah and uh
[6:10] we want to take this in this book of
[6:12] Ephesians uh in this part of the the
[6:14] series and I I want to title this uh uh
[6:17] for Content the mystery of his will the
[6:21] mystery of his will um having having
[6:24] looked at this I want to read something
[6:25] from the Amplified for you Amen in
[6:28] verses 9 and verses 10 making known to
[6:31] us the mystery secret of his will and I
[6:35] like this part of his plan of his
[6:37] purpose and that is in accordance with
[6:39] his good pleasure or his merciful
[6:42] intention which he had previously
[6:44] purposed and set forth in him having
[6:47] planned for the maturity of times and
[6:50] the climax of the ages to unify all
[6:53] things and head them up and consummate
[6:55] them in Christ both things in heaven and
[6:58] in the Earth Earth now when we speak
[7:01] here this morning about the mystery of
[7:03] his will now I'll just say just say real
[7:06] quickly and openly brother Bram says the
[7:08] mystery of his will to adopt us that
[7:11] this was his purpose or the intent of
[7:13] this great plan of God was to bring the
[7:16] church into maturity or the fullness of
[7:19] times or the climax of the ages whereas
[7:22] that it would all end up in the
[7:25] manifestation of the sons of God now
[7:27] whether you want to uh uh maybe uh to
[7:30] embrace this or or feel Unworthy of it
[7:33] however you feel about it but it was all
[7:34] about
[7:35] you uh I hate to say it this plain but
[7:38] it's always been about you uh and it's
[7:42] one goal and one purpose that God has
[7:44] had in his mind from the beginning and
[7:47] that God has redeemed a lot there's been
[7:49] a lot happened but the entire thing has
[7:51] been pointing to the manifestation of
[7:54] the sons of God who are in the end time
[7:57] now in in looking at this I want to look
[7:58] at this word word having made known unto
[8:00] us the mystery of his will now this word
[8:03] here uh I just want to read a little
[8:05] portion here about Mysterion it means
[8:07] literally something into which one must
[8:10] be initiated before it is fully known uh
[8:13] it means to initiate or to instruct and
[8:16] that anything which is concealed or
[8:18] hidden now we commonly use the word to
[8:20] denote that which is above our
[8:22] comprehension or unintelligible but it
[8:25] this is neither the meaning of the word
[8:27] in the New Testament it means
[8:29] that there is some Doctrine or fact
[8:31] which has been concealed or which has
[8:34] not been fully revealed or which has
[8:36] been set forth only by figures and
[8:39] symbols and when the doctrine is made
[8:41] known it may be as clear as plain as any
[8:45] other such was the doctrine that God
[8:48] meant to call see the Gentiles when God
[8:50] meant to call the Gentiles which was
[8:52] long concealed at least in part and was
[8:55] not fully made known until the Savior
[8:57] came which had been until that time see
[9:00] a mystery a concealed truth though when
[9:03] it is revealed there was nothing
[9:05] incomprehensible in it and we'll take it
[9:08] in Colossians 1:26 the mystery which ha
[9:10] been hid from the ages and from
[9:13] Generations but now is made manifest to
[9:16] his Saints so it was in regard to the
[9:18] doctrine of election it was a mystery
[9:21] until it was made known by the actual
[9:23] conversation of them that God had chosen
[9:25] so in regard to the Incarnation of the
[9:27] Redeemer the atonement the whole Plan of
[9:30] Salvation over all the great points
[9:32] there was a veil thrown and the people
[9:35] did not understand them until God
[9:37] revealed them and when they were
[9:39] revealed the mystery was removed and men
[9:42] were able to see it clearly the
[9:44] manifestations of the will of God so in
[9:48] all of these manners and all of these
[9:50] different things uh they've been called
[9:52] Mysteries and as if something would be
[9:55] completely incomprehensible but it's
[9:57] really not incomprehensible it was just
[9:59] not revealed but when it becomes
[10:01] revealed it's just as comprehensible as
[10:04] any other Doctrine in the scripture
[10:06] because it becomes manifest it is a uh
[10:09] if you would look and think of a son and
[10:11] you would think of the mystery son but
[10:13] then there becomes manifest son so then
[10:15] you start understanding what sunship is
[10:17] you could think of mystery attribute God
[10:20] has attributes it was a mystery
[10:21] attribute until it's manifested and it's
[10:24] no longer mystery now it's a revealed
[10:27] attribute see amen you were a mystery in
[10:30] God's mind but now you're not a mystery
[10:32] any longer you are the revelation of
[10:35] what God had in his mind to begin with
[10:38] and see not known by man but known by
[10:41] God has now been revealed and some
[10:44] people can accept the Revelation others
[10:46] cannot accept the Revelation but it
[10:48] still remains to be what God had on his
[10:50] mind amen and we can prove it by
[10:53] Vindication and that's the powerful part
[10:55] of of having the message of the hour is
[10:58] that we've been we've been packed into
[11:00] reality by the Vindicated word not just
[11:03] guessing about it but knowing the truth
[11:06] of it amen now in the message of
[11:08] adoption paragraph 18 adoption four
[11:10] brother B will say this now the mystery
[11:12] he said the scripture packed me back
[11:14] into the Old Testament then back over
[11:16] there in the New Testament and tied
[11:18] something together for me and I love
[11:20] when the brother Bram gets something
[11:21] tied together because it sure ties it
[11:23] together for us he says it tied together
[11:25] for me see now the mystery of his coming
[11:29] the mystery of his will and the Mystery
[11:32] of us setting together so brother B is
[11:34] tying the mystery of his will he's going
[11:36] to tie into that the mystery of his
[11:39] coming and the Mystery of us sitting
[11:41] together now all of these have been
[11:42] Mysteries but when the time comes it
[11:46] will not be a mystery to the people it's
[11:49] happening to it'll be just so
[11:51] comprehensible it'll be so real and
[11:54] they're included in it but someone still
[11:56] tries to make it mysterious or they try
[11:58] to make it something that's coming or
[12:00] they try to make it something down the
[12:02] road so the people who are actually
[12:04] involved usually don't get to enjoy it
[12:06] to the level it's meant to be enjoyed
[12:09] because they're trying to put it into
[12:10] another age whether it be a future age
[12:13] or whether it be a past age that that is
[12:16] so hard to catch the reality that this
[12:19] is exactly what the scriptures were
[12:22] speaking about and when the Thunders are
[12:25] revealed what does it do it removes the
[12:27] symbol from the scripture and now you
[12:29] have moved to the reality of scripture
[12:31] and may I say brother I believe the hour
[12:33] has come I I really believe in this
[12:36] generation the hour has come I don't
[12:39] believe amen this is somebody else's day
[12:41] I believe you're alive and you're here
[12:44] because this is your day and I think
[12:46] it's time to recognize our day and our
[12:49] message and to fully involve ourselves
[12:52] in the message of the hour you know amen
[12:54] I I don't want to get sidetracked but I
[12:56] think it's powerful when you think about
[12:57] fully involved there's a firemen's term
[13:00] uh when they talk about houses you know
[13:02] amen amen it must be you pulling amen
[13:04] when they talk about houses amen and uh
[13:08] they talked about when they get firemen
[13:09] calls sometimes you know they don't want
[13:11] to go but if they ever hear the term the
[13:13] fire is fully involved it means the
[13:15] house is on fire and it's fully involved
[13:18] so all the firemen want to go to that
[13:20] house fire cuz it's fully involved you
[13:22] know amen and I'll be I I don't know
[13:25] amen what other people are doing other
[13:27] places amen but I I believe we got a
[13:29] Church of the Living God that's fully
[13:32] involved amen amen and and it and when
[13:34] you set the church on fire amen amen it
[13:37] it it brings life and truth and it
[13:40] brings reality to the Church of the
[13:42] Living God Amen and I believe there a
[13:44] fire burning this morning in the house
[13:46] of God Amen to to recognize that the
[13:50] prophet would teach us amen that these
[13:52] things three things tied together very
[13:55] closely the mystery of his coming to the
[13:58] mystery of his will to the mystery of us
[14:00] sitting together amen so immediately
[14:03] we're we're realizing brother bam is
[14:04] trying to show us that we can't
[14:07] understand the mystery of his will till
[14:09] we see the mystery of his
[14:11] coming because it would take God to tell
[14:14] us himself what his real will is amen it
[14:18] would take the perfect will of God when
[14:20] you go to the scriptures in Romans
[14:22] chapter 12th chapter the Bible says amen
[14:24] that that this is the season that we
[14:26] should be transformed by the renew of
[14:29] the Mind Amen to prove what is the
[14:32] perfect and acceptable will of God this
[14:35] is the season of presentment this is
[14:37] when God will present to himself a
[14:41] church without spot or wrinkle amen now
[14:44] how would it ever be a perfect Church
[14:46] unless there would be a perfect word and
[14:48] how would a word be perfect unless it
[14:50] come from God it would be the only way
[14:53] Amen to have a perfect church is a
[14:55] perfect word it would have to be a
[14:57] perfect God that would speak it now
[14:59] according to our Bible amen that there
[15:02] would be the revealing of the mysteries
[15:05] of God now you know me I I I have to I
[15:07] have to base it somewhere I can't just
[15:09] say something it has to have a it has to
[15:11] have a basis for me to personally have
[15:13] enough Faith to preach it to be true and
[15:16] in Revelations the 10th chapter my Bible
[15:18] says in the days of the voice of the
[15:20] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[15:22] sound the mystery of God should be
[15:25] finished as he's declared unto his
[15:28] servants the prophets now that that
[15:30] Revelations the 10th chapter is
[15:31] discussing John writing the seven
[15:33] Thunders and the Bible said he said seal
[15:35] it up until the seventh angel sound so
[15:39] in the days of the seventh angel the
[15:41] mystery would be removed it would be
[15:43] sound in other words what was mystery
[15:45] would become comprehensible what was
[15:48] mystery would be spoken plainly in the
[15:51] hillbilly
[15:53] English for us to catch it and
[15:55] understand it simple like amen now here
[15:58] here the scripture says that the mystery
[16:01] would be finished in Daniel the 11th
[16:03] chapter 32nd verse it's a powerful verse
[16:06] I've used it many times and has become
[16:08] rapidly one of my favorite ones he said
[16:10] and and and such as do wickedly against
[16:12] the Covenant shall corrupt by flatteries
[16:15] but the people that do know their God
[16:18] shall be strong and do great exploits
[16:21] now the people that know their God now
[16:23] that don't have as much meaning until
[16:25] you hear what the prophet says about it
[16:28] in the Fe to the trumpets he says now he
[16:30] says see the Messiah people that's
[16:32] believing how will they know it unless
[16:35] they're constantly in the word to know
[16:37] what he is see Daniel said the wise
[16:41] shall know but the foolish and the
[16:42] unwise wouldn't know they shall know
[16:44] their God and how he shall appear in the
[16:46] last days to bring the people back to
[16:49] the word so the bride will know her
[16:52] husband now if you've never read it the
[16:54] way brother bram's reading it listen to
[16:55] the way he reads it the people that know
[16:57] their God shall be strong the brother
[16:59] Bram says the bride would know her mate
[17:02] he switches those words people know God
[17:05] bride will know mate amen and he's
[17:08] showing us that he's bringing it right
[17:11] down to his own Ministry in that he was
[17:14] to introduce the mate of the church
[17:18] which he identifies as the revealed word
[17:21] of the hour amen we come on now folks
[17:24] the marriage has already
[17:26] come and if the marriage has already
[17:29] come what have we married we have
[17:31] married the revealed word of the hour so
[17:34] then the bride does have a headship she
[17:37] is one unit with God because she's
[17:40] received the word of God Amen as a
[17:43] hearer and become one now he shall
[17:45] appear in the last days that's why this
[17:47] has to happen amen it wasn't in the
[17:50] reformers it wasn't in Luther it wasn't
[17:52] in westle that's why it was a mystery in
[17:54] those days and they taught the
[17:56] Traditions they taught about the
[17:57] marriage of of the lamb and about the
[17:59] coming of the Lord that's why books were
[18:01] written amen but they were being written
[18:03] under a veil amen and and and it's funny
[18:06] we were just talking the other day
[18:08] brother Carrie and I and brother Nathan
[18:09] and we were talking about brother
[18:10] brandom uh some of the things he taught
[18:12] early on let's just take uh the white
[18:14] horse rider in 1960 and he calls the
[18:16] white horse rider Jesus Christ he 180 de
[18:21] changes that in the first seal and says
[18:23] that it's the Antichrist and and some of
[18:25] our critics want to come along and say
[18:27] well brother BR was wrong but but no
[18:29] really he wasn't wrong because in 1960
[18:32] it had never yet been revealed who that
[18:34] white horse rider was it he was no he
[18:38] was no more wrong let me just put it in
[18:40] phrases for you Martin Luther smoked a
[18:42] pot and drank beer baptizing trinitarian
[18:45] Doctrine and was the reformer the
[18:47] messenger of God for that age was he
[18:50] wrong see if you judging by the real
[18:53] truth we know today sure he's wrong amen
[18:56] but if Martin Luther would have lived
[18:58] longer enough he would have been
[18:59] Sanctified he would have been baptized
[19:02] with the Holy Ghost he would have taught
[19:04] amen the same thing we're teaching here
[19:06] today the thing brother random did is he
[19:08] lived Spann two ages he spanned from the
[19:11] Pentecostal dispensation and moved over
[19:14] into the word age and you can see the
[19:16] development in his teaching that when
[19:19] God opens the seals the dispensations
[19:22] change and because he's a word prophet
[19:25] he follows the inspiration he don't
[19:27] worry about what denomination has said
[19:29] he don't matter what other people have
[19:31] said or taught or thought the seals have
[19:33] opened the mystery and the prophet is
[19:36] leading the bride from misunderstandings
[19:39] to realities We are following the pillar
[19:42] of fire amen we didn't come to to make
[19:45] camp on any ground we didn't come to
[19:48] build a fire in the same place every
[19:50] service come on church amen we have come
[19:53] to follow the message of the hour into
[19:56] truth into every Divine truth and every
[19:58] word that this Bible has taught us I
[20:02] believe this morning that there is a
[20:03] promise for the Church of the Living God
[20:06] Amen what we said he shall appear in the
[20:08] last day and this is the promise of this
[20:10] age so let me just let me just complete
[20:12] that by saying before the first seal was
[20:16] open God winked at the ignorance of the
[20:20] teaching of men on that
[20:22] [Music]
[20:23] subject after that opened now we're back
[20:26] to the original thought of God God Amen
[20:29] so brother Ram didn't bring a new
[20:31] teaching he brought the original
[20:33] teaching
[20:35] Hallelujah so now the only thing you
[20:37] have to do is let go of all the other
[20:39] teaching and just follow the message and
[20:42] you'll be with the original doctrine
[20:44] that Paul taught in the beginning
[20:46] somebody said well I think brother Bram
[20:48] taught something different no he didn't
[20:49] beyond the curtain of time they asked
[20:51] and he said brother R you have to stand
[20:54] for everything you taught he said will
[20:56] Paul have to he said yeah Paul have to
[20:59] and there was a bunch of people out
[21:00] there that wasn't brandom's they were
[21:03] converts of this message and they scream
[21:06] back we are resting on that and we are
[21:10] still believing that this morning our
[21:12] Doctrine rests soly upon the scriptures
[21:16] the holy scriptures let me say it I
[21:18] believe this Bible from cover to cover
[21:20] in the cover that's on it because this
[21:22] is not amen just good ideology it's not
[21:26] just a book of history or a book book of
[21:28] Prophecy it is the word of God giving to
[21:31] this generation but there's a message
[21:34] that have come to bring us back out of
[21:36] denomination Creeds and ideas and
[21:39] traditions and places back into the
[21:41] atonement of the word of
[21:43] God the genuine atonement is the word
[21:47] folks come on come out of the tradition
[21:49] come out of the denomination come out of
[21:51] the ideology come out of all of it and
[21:53] come under the
[21:55] blood the blood amen my goodness I
[21:59] believe in it I believe the blood is
[22:00] preached in this
[22:03] hour ain't going to be no more blood
[22:05] shed so the only way we're going to get
[22:07] it now is through the word the word has
[22:11] to bring the blood to the church that's
[22:14] why it says
[22:15] dispensation do you see now this is the
[22:18] promise that was for this age now watch
[22:21] brother bam and I'm just going to show
[22:23] you a little comparison here if you like
[22:25] to study you'll pick up a couple of
[22:26] these things in Feast the trumpets
[22:28] paragraph 113 and he shall appear in the
[22:31] last days to bring the people back to
[22:32] the word that's Daniel
[22:34] 11 so the bride will know her mate now
[22:37] watch he uses the word he shall appear
[22:40] in the last days now watch this next
[22:43] thing it wasn't reformers this paragraph
[22:45] 114 right below it it l was Wesley or
[22:48] Pentecostals the scripture says it
[22:51] wasn't but it will come that is the
[22:53] promise for this age we are living in
[22:56] the age is coming will be in now some
[23:00] people take an extreme amount of time to
[23:02] separate coming and appearing and I I
[23:04] certainly agree at times it is
[23:06] appropriate because we got to remember
[23:08] there's a Corporal
[23:10] body and we got to remember there's a
[23:11] leaving of the
[23:13] church but in many cases brother bam
[23:16] uses the word coming and appearing
[23:19] synonymously he literally just
[23:21] interchanged the two words here without
[23:23] switching without hitting the beat he
[23:24] just interchanged the two words and
[23:26] moved right on there he appear in the
[23:28] last day cuz this is the age his coming
[23:30] will be in she must be identified in him
[23:32] do you see he's talking about the word
[23:35] coming to the church he's talking about
[23:37] the revealed word now according to the
[23:40] leosan church age this Messenger will
[23:42] have the power of infallibility
[23:44] Revelations 10 and brother Ram said by
[23:46] by by necessity he will have the
[23:48] Capstone prophetic message and God will
[23:51] show him he won't need to speak for
[23:53] himself because God will speak for him
[23:56] by the voice of the sign
[23:59] now in Look Away to Jesus powerful
[24:01] sermon is it you would think brother
[24:03] brandom is getting you to look away Amen
[24:05] to Jesus coming in the Eastern Skies
[24:07] that's not what he's doing at all
[24:09] because he tells us the word interpreted
[24:11] is a manifestation of the name of God is
[24:14] that right and then he says he says
[24:16] everybody's speaking the name Jesus but
[24:19] they're not getting anything because
[24:21] they miss the interpretation of the name
[24:24] go ahead is that right so the the word
[24:27] interpreted word manifested is what we
[24:30] were looking for brother man he then
[24:32] gives you five manifestations of the
[24:34] third poll and I'll not go through all
[24:36] of them but you remember the speaking of
[24:37] the squirrels the speaking of the storms
[24:39] the the the speaking the raising of the
[24:41] Dead Fish and you got to ask yourself
[24:44] why he raised a dead fish when all the
[24:45] needs were out there brother Bram said
[24:47] this he was interested in the little
[24:50] things to show you he's interested in
[24:52] the small things in your life because
[24:54] God is interested so the third pull amen
[24:57] was was brought down to the smallest
[25:00] part of your life because God is
[25:03] interested in the whole thing and
[25:05] because of his interest look what he
[25:07] said he gives five manifestations and
[25:09] then he says Look Away to Jesus look
[25:12] away from what denomination schooling
[25:15] theology tradition amen all these things
[25:18] that man has said is Jesus brother R
[25:21] said they ain't right none of them he
[25:23] said because When They Crucified now you
[25:25] know these quotes When They Crucified
[25:27] him in Jerusalem it moved from the
[25:29] Pascal lamb to the Lamb of God and the
[25:32] veil was written open and mercy was
[25:35] shown in full View and that's exactly
[25:37] what's happened in this age church amen
[25:40] Mercy isn't over mercy no mercy is in
[25:43] full view in this age this is the
[25:45] greatest Mercy ever shown to any
[25:48] generation in the history of the world
[25:51] Hallelujah when we have mercy and
[25:53] partiality but at this time Mercy has
[25:55] become full thank you Jesus the mercy
[25:57] beautiful hand of God the third pul see
[26:00] was the interpretation of the word amen
[26:04] first pull was of course his hand second
[26:07] pole was the discernment the third pole
[26:10] was when a
[26:12] prophet took the scriptures and said
[26:15] this is what this means amen and this is
[26:18] what this means and this is what this
[26:20] means and this is what that me that's
[26:23] why the Revival in this hour will never
[26:27] be under the first pool it'll never
[26:29] happen under the second pool but the
[26:32] Revival is under the third pool which is
[26:35] the opening of the word and when the
[26:38] word become open now we know who it is
[26:41] standing Among
[26:42] Us now watch what we find the third pull
[26:46] has now been Vindicated brother bam says
[26:48] in 1963 now look what he says Look Away
[26:50] to Jesus this is his title and he says
[26:53] now this third pole that we've looked
[26:55] for so many years isn't that amazing
[26:59] we've looked for it so many
[27:01] years he says now it's been
[27:05] Vindicated and I'm sure you know what it
[27:08] is now some ain't figured it out now and
[27:12] it's been 50
[27:15] years cuz it's hid yeah in
[27:19] 1963 Look Away to Jesus but here is him
[27:23] to has
[27:25] wisdom the third poll is properly
[27:29] identified the third pull is here now
[27:33] let's go Christ the mystery
[27:35] 1963 how do you know it's right he is
[27:38] the word the word is
[27:40] Vindicated and when the word properly
[27:43] Vindicated is the headship it's the head
[27:46] of the church he is the word the
[27:49] headship and he properly identified
[27:53] Vindicated by his own spirit being in
[27:56] the church itself the
[27:58] person now what we're what we're seeing
[28:01] then is proper identification that's
[28:04] what happened with John and Jesus all
[28:06] right that's exactly what happened Jesus
[28:09] identified John and John identified
[28:11] Jesus amen that's actually what's
[28:14] happened in this age God has identified
[28:16] his prophet and his Prophet has
[28:18] identified God now what we then see is
[28:22] that we need to look to a the the
[28:26] teaching of a prophet to understand what
[28:29] it is that's here and what it is that we
[28:31] have received right now watch brother
[28:34] Ram will tell us this that this is to
[28:36] make known the mystery of his will to
[28:39] adopt us according to the pleasure that
[28:41] he has purposed within himself now three
[28:44] things watch mystery of his coming
[28:46] mystery of his will mystery of his
[28:48] sitting together so we want to look just
[28:50] a moment at the mystery of his coming
[28:52] now there's a there's a powerful thing
[28:54] setting here this morning because that
[28:56] we have been given
[28:57] a a a revelation in this age and some of
[29:01] you are even in possession and maybe not
[29:03] even aware of what all you're in
[29:04] possession of okay and I'll say this to
[29:07] you because when you hear the word
[29:09] Elohim the self-existent one Elohim
[29:13] there is a revelation with the name of
[29:15] Elohim in this age that has not been
[29:18] released in other
[29:19] ages now it was partially and it was hid
[29:22] but now it's been Vindicated because see
[29:25] we recognize that immediately medely
[29:28] when Jesus himself speaking and says as
[29:30] it was in the days of lot and as it was
[29:32] in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[29:35] the coming of the son of man two things
[29:37] he left out brother Mike he left out
[29:39] Enoch and he left out Abraham he left
[29:41] out the mystery of what happened in them
[29:44] days was Enoch translated Before the
[29:46] Flood and Abraham never was in Sodom to
[29:49] come out amen but we see that Elohim
[29:52] visited Abraham up there at the tent
[29:55] door and Genesis the 8 18th chapter we
[29:58] seen Elohim when he came to the tent
[30:00] door and Abraham called him Lord capital
[30:03] l r d brother brandham says that it was
[30:06] a Vindicated thing when Elohim looked at
[30:10] him and said bring me thy wife Sarah
[30:13] yeah and Sarah was laughing in the tent
[30:16] behind him and he said why does Sarah
[30:18] laugh within her heart she was behind
[30:21] him in her heart thinking something and
[30:24] he was standing at the tent door telling
[30:26] her what she had in her heart now I it's
[30:30] it's it's amazing when you get into
[30:32] who's this mdic and brother Bron brings
[30:34] it up and said no who was that but MDC
[30:38] amen he says now watch in the beginning
[30:40] was the word and the Word was with God
[30:42] there is MDC right there he's the
[30:46] word before that there was nothing God
[30:49] created it then mcedc who had no
[30:51] beginning of days no ending of life amen
[30:54] David talked about him Abraham talked
[30:56] about him but it was El cdct it was the
[30:59] theophany of God that came down in
[31:02] Abraham's tent and discerned him and
[31:05] Paul called it the word I don't want to
[31:08] put you to sleep but hang on let's let's
[31:10] walk Elohim then was at the tent door
[31:13] laying the framework of future
[31:16] generations of how Jesus himself when he
[31:19] came to the Earth the Son of God would
[31:21] use this to identify himself Jesus would
[31:24] pull out the same credentials that was
[31:27] used at the tent door of Abraham to
[31:30] Abraham's seed and he would discern
[31:32] their hearts and he would give to them
[31:33] and you know just for teaching sake he
[31:36] taught this to the Samaritans and he
[31:38] taught this to the to the Jew he did it
[31:40] at the woman at the well the Samaritan
[31:42] he did it to Philip and Nathaniel the
[31:44] Jew he did it to Peter he discerned the
[31:47] hearts of the Pharisees but he never did
[31:50] that to the Gentile church because the
[31:52] Gentiles were not looking for a messiah
[31:56] but the Bible records to us that after
[31:59] the death burial in Jesus that Paul took
[32:01] the Revelation to the Gentiles and had
[32:04] them looking for the coming or the
[32:06] appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[32:08] the last days now H you can get all tore
[32:11] up at me if you want to people say well
[32:13] brother Wayne you don't have scripture
[32:14] to preach the message of the hour no I
[32:16] got a lot of scripture most people just
[32:19] can't receive that the scripture in the
[32:21] Bible is literally talking about this
[32:23] age come on church if this is not the
[32:26] appearing that Paul was talking about
[32:28] what is if this is not the appearing
[32:31] that John was talking about what is if
[32:33] this is not what James and John and
[32:36] Peter was talking about then pray tell
[32:38] me what is when the Bible said the Lord
[32:41] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[32:44] shout and the shout is the message of
[32:47] the hour it is the Divine will
[32:50] instructions of almighty God coming to
[32:52] the church the general orders coming
[32:55] from Divine will in the Church of the
[32:57] Living
[32:59] God it's the captain of the host that
[33:02] has settled among the church it is the
[33:05] mystery of his coming is the revelation
[33:09] of
[33:10] Elohim
[33:13] brother now can we just say it there's
[33:15] just one
[33:18] God y'all know I'm telling you truth
[33:20] there just one God but that one God
[33:24] never changes his nature scripture on
[33:27] scripture I am God and I change not when
[33:30] he took the name Jesus that's why Paul
[33:32] said he's the same yesterday today and
[33:35] forever he's never changed his nature
[33:38] he's never changed his attitude whatever
[33:40] his attitude was at the tent door of
[33:42] Abraham is the same attitude this
[33:45] morning however he dealt with them in
[33:47] the Old Testament he's still the same
[33:49] God this morning his hand is not shorten
[33:52] his ear is not heavy if he healed them
[33:55] he heals now if he save then he saves
[33:58] now if he discern then he discerns now
[34:01] because he's the same yesterday today
[34:03] and forever I'm talking about God who
[34:06] does not
[34:09] change in Joel the second chapter he
[34:11] said I pour out my spirit sayith the
[34:13] Lord didn't he say it the word pour out
[34:16] brother random taught us is not like
[34:17] pouring water out of a glass he said
[34:19] it's the changing of a mask he's moving
[34:22] from one thing to another and brother
[34:25] Bram said see he wore a certain mask in
[34:27] Abraham's Day He Wore a pillar of fire
[34:29] in Paul's day he was behind the skin of
[34:32] Jesus Christ in that day but in the last
[34:35] days he'll put on another mask he'll
[34:37] come in the form of the Bride the
[34:40] redeemed Church of the Living God he
[34:42] will return as Abraham's
[34:47] seed Abraham's Royal
[34:50] seed of course he was the father of
[34:53] course he's the son but he's also the
[34:55] Holy Ghost
[34:56] [Applause]
[34:58] and where is that Holy Ghost yet a
[35:01] little while and the world see me no
[35:03] more but ye shall see me for I will be
[35:06] with you even in you until the end of
[35:08] the age that is not up for discussion
[35:12] Christ is here he's here in power he's
[35:16] here in anointing he just wears a
[35:18] different
[35:20] [Applause]
[35:22] masku he's the same Jesus in Bride form
[35:26] yes Luke 24 said their eyes were holding
[35:30] another places said he appeared unto
[35:31] them in a different form after his
[35:33] resurrection he still had a Ministry in
[35:36] John 16 he said I got things to say
[35:39] can't say them now but there's coming a
[35:41] time brother Ram said there's the
[35:43] prophecy of the opening of Seven Seals
[35:45] couldn't be done when Jesus was on Earth
[35:47] but in the last days there's coming a
[35:52] message it won't be William brandom
[35:55] speaking amen it'll be Christ
[36:00] himself in Philippians the Bible speaks
[36:02] of form Joel 2 it speaks of form Luke 24
[36:05] it speaks of form yes sir the bride
[36:08] coming of the son of man
[36:11] amen
[36:13] fatherhood fatherhood matured in the son
[36:16] of man amen
[36:19] mecdc sunship matured in Son of Man
[36:23] Jesus
[36:25] Christ Holy Ghost most
[36:28] matures as son of
[36:30] man in
[36:32] Bride now watch what we're looking we're
[36:35] talking
[36:37] about him coming down now brother Bram
[36:40] brother Bram is explicit in this point
[36:43] he carries three
[36:44] names but he's the same
[36:48] God when Jesus was on Earth he never
[36:51] changed he was Jesus one man called him
[36:54] son of David yeah and his eyes was
[36:56] healed
[36:57] and a woman saw the same one and called
[37:00] him son of David he wouldn't even look
[37:01] at
[37:03] her he never changed anything but she
[37:07] said Lord right and everything
[37:10] changed because she approached him in
[37:12] another name but he was the same God so
[37:16] when Christ descends in the last day he
[37:19] didn't promise you son of David okay he
[37:22] didn't promise you just Son of God he
[37:25] promised son of man
[37:27] that's now this is
[37:31] packing prophecy come down now you've
[37:34] seen it in and and I'll just put it
[37:36] together since I'm here but you've seen
[37:38] it there in first in John 6 when Jesus
[37:41] said I'm the bread of life that come
[37:43] down out of heaven now nobody saw Jesus
[37:47] step out of a cloud and descend into
[37:50] their midst on the contrary some of them
[37:52] knew his birth
[37:54] mother some of them knew him as a young
[37:56] child child growing up they you didn't
[37:58] come out of heaven
[38:00] right but he was out of Heaven because
[38:03] the words of Isaiah and Malachi and the
[38:07] words of Ezekiel were being
[38:10] fulfilled so he as he was saying I am
[38:13] the Fulfillment of Prophecy he was
[38:15] saying I'm the
[38:17] bread out of heaven and all that they
[38:20] seen the growth you know they seen him
[38:22] from a young child they seen the growth
[38:23] they seen him grow up they seen the
[38:25] whole thing what do you mean you
[38:27] descended Out of Heaven see in 1
[38:30] Thessalonians 4 he shall descend he
[38:33] shall come down but in Revelations 10 it
[38:37] says the same thing a mighty Angel shall
[38:40] come down out of it descend Out of
[38:42] Heaven brother B said who is that angel
[38:45] only Christ it could
[38:48] be the Covenant
[38:50] angel now watch what we're seeing is
[38:53] this is coming down bringing the
[38:56] Dynamics to the church now it's powerful
[38:59] to me can we can we look at promises
[39:01] y'all know how picky I am about
[39:03] scripture I have to make sure it's
[39:05] scripture in PSAL in Matthew 24 and 27
[39:08] my Bible says for as the lightning
[39:10] cometh out of the East and shineth under
[39:13] the West so shall the coming of the son
[39:16] of man be now that's a very good English
[39:18] word coming so so you can't get so picky
[39:21] on a period in coming that you quit
[39:23] calling it
[39:25] coming cuz the Bible called it coming
[39:29] right now watch this Luke 17:24 for as
[39:33] the lightning the light now now let me
[39:36] explain that point to you years ago
[39:38] there was some teachings that went
[39:39] around that the Lord had come and they
[39:41] really meant it like the Rapture was
[39:43] over right right and if you were
[39:46] preaching and you said we're looking for
[39:48] the coming of the Lord half of them get
[39:49] up and walk out on you because that's
[39:51] already happened so so what it was is
[39:54] it's critical spirits right that pick
[39:57] certain spots to label or disagree so
[40:00] what I'm trying to show you is brother
[40:01] bram's Revelation it contained both
[40:03] words it wasn't he wasn't as picky as
[40:06] some people
[40:07] get right now watch what he's doing he's
[40:10] saying the coming of the son of man now
[40:12] again in Luke 17 he said as the
[40:14] lightning that lith out of one part of
[40:16] the heaven and shineth under the other
[40:18] part of the heaven so also shall the son
[40:20] of man be in that day for there first
[40:23] suffer many things and be rejected to
[40:24] this generation as it was in the days of
[40:26] Noah so shall it also be in the days of
[40:29] the son of man they did eat they drank
[40:31] they married the wives they given him
[40:32] marriage until the day Noah went into
[40:34] the ark now now I not going to preach a
[40:36] sermon on it you all could amen it is
[40:38] the days of Noah
[40:40] here it's it's there okay now watch
[40:43] likewise also as in the days of lot he's
[40:46] talking about
[40:47] sodomy let me ask you without preaching
[40:50] the sermon is it there so both of those
[40:53] things are in place but in the same day
[40:55] that lot when out of Sodom it rain fire
[40:57] and brimstone from heaven and destroyed
[40:59] them all even thus shall it be in the
[41:02] day when the son of man is revealed now
[41:06] in Luke they're using the word revealed
[41:08] in Matthew they're using the word
[41:10] coming isn't it amazing that Revelation
[41:14] brings you in the presence of God in
[41:17] other words you don't think anything's
[41:19] happening but let a revelation strike
[41:21] you and you can see you're standing

[47:09] Vindicated the resurrection of Jesus
[47:12] Christ if you were going to prove Jesus

[47:16] more
[47:17] evidence than the message of the Hour

[47:22] random wasn't Jesus but he introduced us
[47:25] to Jesus and that same Jesus is still

[48:07] just a spiritual body cuz he ate and he
[48:10] drank and he got his feet
[48:12] worst right but he told them what they
[48:15] were thinking in their
[48:17] heart now Malachi and the rest of the
[48:20] scriptures in the last days before the

[48:49] brother Ram fulfilled Malachi
[48:51] 4 do you see what fulfilled that
[48:53] scripture it wasn't the phys physical

[49:18] to this your scriptural blind prosecutor
[49:20] he he was really putting it on him was
[49:22] he he says he's going to sound
[49:24] ridiculous there's spiritually blind the
[49:26] prosecutor is see what it is they're not
[49:28] recognizing it it's happening just the
[49:31] same but they're not seeing it Christ is
[49:34] here but or not seen
[49:36] it the son of man has revealed himself
[49:39] in every manner promised in Bible but
[49:42] they haven't saw
[49:43] it but then the other ra said but we
[49:46] have seen it and we believe it and we

[49:58] vindicate his
[49:59] word it would be Christ it would be
[50:02] Christ returning in the form of the word
[50:06] working in human beings showing the
[50:08] signs that was promised he promised that
[50:11] he would do now you you got to hold on
[50:14] to your seat Bel for this one he said

[50:26] revealing himself in the church the
[50:28] human flesh making himself known proving
[50:32] his word do you see what I mean the son
[50:34] of man Jesus Christ will come down into

[50:51] the son of man is revealed in the form
[50:54] of the Bride in the the last days come
[50:56] on church not every one of us is going
[50:58] to carry a prophetic word that's not
[51:00] what he's talking about William brandom
[51:02] is not uh he's not our bridegroom he was
[51:06] a part of the
[51:10] Bride yeah so he was a sheath that was
[51:14] to be waved over the church the first
[51:17] one that come to
[51:19] maturity to prove now that's of course
[51:22] the secret food that he will embody
[51:24] himself brother Bam's Ministry I got
[51:26] just a couple more and we're going to
[51:27] move on brother Bam's Ministry is is
[51:31] powerful in that watch brother badam

[51:36] Ministry from a pastor or teacher he
[51:38] said and if I say things wrong Brethren
[51:40] forgive
[51:41] me well now that would be hard for some
[51:44] theological
[51:48] discussions but he said if I say
[51:50] something wrong forgive
[51:51] me brother randam was not trying to say
[51:55] everything exactly to the place to
[51:58] dictate it like he was writing the Bible
[52:00] he wasn't doing that yeah but what he
[52:02] was doing was vindicating the
[52:05] resurrection of Jesus Christ now look at
[52:08] this he says this is my Ministry to
[52:12] declare him he is here headship is here
[52:18] now what's he doing he's identifying
[52:20] that

[54:50] behold thy King cometh amen and here he
[54:53] come off of a mountain Mountain on that
[54:56] little white donkey riding down by the
[54:59] way I think that must have been the
[55:00] donkey that had a scriptural mother just
[55:02] say
[55:03] it you know he had knocked knees and
[55:06] bold legs and may be the reason he had
[55:08] never been
[55:10] rode cuz he wasn't ridable by anybody
[55:14] else but when they turned him loose the
[55:17] master was going to get on him amen and
[55:19] everything changes when the master gets
[55:22] on a man Hallelujah can you imagine when
[55:26] he's riding when he's riding down the
[55:28] middle of of the streets and they're
[55:30] saying Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna one of
[55:32] his little one of his little mule
[55:34] buddies looked over and said hey I think
[55:36] they're worshiping you they're really
[55:37] proud of you he said no mama done taught
[55:39] me they're not looking at me they're
[55:42] looking at the lamb they're not looking
[55:44] at me they're looking at the one I'm
[55:45] packing and let me say this amen I don't
[55:48] believe we're looking at one another
[55:49] this morning we could find all kinds of
[55:52] problems but we're packing a message
[55:54] we're packing in the message of the
[55:56] coming of the Lord this is not just a
[55:59] come on it's not just a sermon or a
[56:01] little bible school amen it's the
[56:03] ministry of the son of man that's coming
[56:05] to the church with the rapturing of the
[56:07] church I don't know today tomorrow the
[56:09] next day but I do know this he is here
[56:12] for a
[56:13] [Applause]
[56:17] bride Hallelujah see the answer to the
[56:21] prophet's prophecy Zachariah is being
[56:24] answered in
[56:26] Matthew and some was looking for him but
[56:28] they did not know who he
[56:31] was because of them of course he was
[56:33] just that that drunken Soldier son that
[56:37] Mary lied about their relationship and
[56:40] had to hide
[56:42] and you know why they did that brother
[56:44] Greg it wasn't the first time that had
[56:46] been told about Virgin birth and all if
[56:49] you go all the way back to Babylon back
[56:51] to the building of of chrisan emrod
[56:53] building the tower
[56:55] the mother child remember the mother was
[56:58] a promiscuous woman and she had all
[57:00] kinds of promiscuous relationships in
[57:03] their Temple because it was an
[57:05] adulterous religion and when she become
[57:07] expecting a child amen they had to tell
[57:10] the people
[57:12] something okay so they gave them the
[57:14] idea of a virgin birth and they sold it
[57:17] off as a lie so people later with
[57:19] thinking I don't know about this virgin
[57:21] birth
[57:22] stuff and if God had to revealed it to
[57:25] you you wouldn't believe it
[57:27] either lots of Christians don't believe
[57:29] in the Virgin birth but we do because we
[57:32] are involved in the relationship with
[57:36] him who was virgin born and come back
[57:38] into the world as a manifesting presence
[57:40] in our
[57:44] lives do you see when when he when he
[57:46] came there of course he's writing and
[57:49] they're they're looking they're looking
[57:50] they're looking at the biblical promise
[57:53] now now y'all know y'all know oh what's
[57:55] amazing to me is the people that did get
[57:57] it because there was no holding them
[58:00] people
[58:01] back and they was screaming and shouting
[58:03] rejoicing and brother Bram said that's
[58:05] what was causing the
[58:07] stir you remember people talk about
[58:09] emotion brother Braham said it like this
[58:11] he said sir he said it's not fake he
[58:14] said emotion is stirred by something he
[58:17] said if somebody's scared in the alley
[58:18] it's emotion they scream out he said I
[58:20] want to know what was behind the screen
[58:23] if you hear somebody screaming out in a
[58:24] hall you won't you won't just think oh
[58:26] that's somebody screaming no you want to
[58:28] know what's behind it somebody died
[58:30] somebody get hurt was there an accident
[58:31] what happened something's behind it and
[58:34] when you hear a church going off and
[58:35] standing Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[58:38] and you see them church and moving in
[58:41] the spirit of God listen I don't want to
[58:43] call that emotionalism I want know
[58:45] what's behind
[58:46] it and if you're wondering what's behind
[58:49] it let me tell you what's behind it it
[58:51] is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and Luke
[58:53] 17:3 and John 14 and Revelations the
[58:57] 10th chapter and we see it and we know
[59:00] we're in the presence of a messiah amen
[59:03] so I don't know about you but if you
[59:05] don't want to worship scoot over why I
[59:07] do and give me some Elbow Room because
[59:10] he's worthy he's worthy of Our Praise
[59:12] that our God would come down in a little
[59:15] church like this a bunch of simple and
[59:18] humble people but he'll break out into
[59:20] the room and make himself known Among
[59:23] Us
[59:25] I believe he's worthy of Our Praise I
[59:27] believe he's worthy amen of somebody
[59:29] letting somebody know he's here in the
[59:32] midst of the room thank you
[59:36] Lord hosan go ahead to the
[59:40] king and when they didn't have nothing
[59:42] to worship with him they took their
[59:44] coats off and threw them in the floor
[59:46] and they took Palm leaves and threw it
[59:48] in front of him because the King was
[59:50] passing
[59:51] by well I tell you the same King's here
[59:53] this morning
[59:56] he didn't change none did he Hallelujah
[59:59] when he come right down they worshiped
[1:00:01] him coming right down that street death
[1:00:03] burial and Resurrection he raised up out
[1:00:04] of the Grave he went to souls in prison
[1:00:07] delivered the Church of the Living God
[1:00:09] and turned Heavenly and as he's going
[1:00:11] into the Gates of Heaven he starts
[1:00:12] singing the Psalms brother BR said he
[1:00:14] did he said lift up oh ye gates of
[1:00:16] everlasting life and let the king of
[1:00:18] glory come
[1:00:20] in and they said who is the king of
[1:00:23] glory he said he's the one one that is
[1:00:25] mighty in the battle and they swung the
[1:00:28] doors open and there the king of the
[1:00:30] city of Jerusalem come marching in with
[1:00:33] resurrected
[1:00:36] Saints now that same King has descended
[1:00:39] into this age as the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:42] Ghost to come into the person flesh of
[1:00:44] the Church of the Living God that's why
[1:00:46] in Revelations 3 it said behold I stand
[1:00:49] at the door and knock and if many man

[1:09:31] come in then cuz the latch is on the
[1:09:38] inside you have to open the door and
[1:09:43] here's amazing thing to me I was
[1:09:44] studying this some time ago and I was
[1:09:47] just thinking about the carnality of
[1:09:49] knocking doors and things you know how
[1:09:51] it
[1:09:52] is and man maybe you hit midnight some
[1:09:55] of you probably in bed and if you ain't
[1:09:56] you're wondering who's at the door
[1:09:57] anyhow yeah you lay around a little
[1:10:00] while if you set there too long when you
[1:10:03] get up and go to the window all you see
[1:10:06] is tail lights and then comes that
[1:10:09] question who was
[1:10:12] that okay see it goes from who is
[1:10:19] it who was
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:24] the
[1:10:25] judge was at the door now you you hear
[1:10:27] Brother Bram tell this in a story he
[1:10:29] tells it a couple different ways but in
[1:10:31] a couple different times but he tells it
[1:10:33] the the the center point is the same and
[1:10:36] a young man got in real trouble remember
[1:10:39] and he was on death
[1:10:41] roll and he was fising to die and he
[1:10:44] needed to stay from execution the
[1:10:47] mother got a hold of the governor of the
[1:10:51] state and brother Bram said she knew he
[1:10:54] was the only one between the boy and
[1:10:56] capital punishment so when she got to
[1:10:59] his
[1:10:59] office she got on her hands and knees
[1:11:03] and she crawled to the desk of the
[1:11:06] governor look at that
[1:11:08] approach Governor please
[1:11:11] sir my
[1:11:14] baby that he might be old he might have
[1:11:17] done horrible things but he's still
[1:11:19] mama's baby I'm going to tell you
[1:11:21] something about a mama Mama's love is a
[1:11:24] special kind of love
[1:11:26] folks it is the only thing that's the
[1:11:28] closest to the love of God there
[1:11:31] is and that Mama So entered in and so
[1:11:34] humbled
[1:11:36] herself that a
[1:11:39] governor became
[1:11:41] interested in a case like this yeah he
[1:11:44] left he left his
[1:11:48] mansion and the governor
[1:11:51] himself went down to the C
[1:11:54] s they took let him in brother Ram said
[1:11:57] he said they let him in and set him on
[1:12:00] the bed next to the
[1:12:02] fell and he and this this in the message
[1:12:05] look he he draws it like this he said
[1:12:08] but the boy
[1:12:09] refused to even look at the
[1:12:13] governor now now what brother BR is
[1:12:15] telling you he's trying to get you to
[1:12:18] look at his message as the Fulfillment
[1:12:21] of scripture amen and he said the the
[1:12:23] boy refused to even look at
[1:12:27] it he said he had a
[1:12:31] complex with
[1:12:33] religions so he thought surely it's only
[1:12:35] here to do something wrong or and and
[1:12:37] you come on many of you folks know what
[1:12:39] I'm talking about here sure you know
[1:12:41] some of you a refugee nearly from
[1:12:44] situations and
[1:12:46] spiritual takes us sometimes years to
[1:12:48] get trusting again because of spiritual
[1:12:51] manipulations and hurts and y y'all know
[1:12:54] what I'm talking about the boy was so
[1:12:57] complexed had his guard up so much that
[1:13:00] he wouldn't even look at the man he was
[1:13:01] trying to talk to
[1:13:03] him and he was trying to get his
[1:13:05] attention son could we just talk I don't

[1:13:12] don't want to look at you I want to talk
[1:13:14] to
[1:13:15] you brother Bram says in a moment he
[1:13:18] said the governor got up having
[1:13:20] fulfilled what he told the mother he
[1:13:22] would do he got up he stepped out of the
[1:13:25] cell and he starts walking down the
[1:13:28] hall and the boy just gets
[1:13:31] curious he steps over to the jail bar
[1:13:34] and he looks and he looks and sees and
[1:13:37] oh is look like an important man wearing
[1:13:39] the
[1:13:40] Su hey
[1:13:42] guard who was
[1:13:44] that he said that was the governor of
[1:13:47] the state
[1:13:49] son he said you
[1:13:52] mean the man that could save my life was
[1:13:57] in my
[1:14:00] cell and I wouldn't even look at
[1:14:05] him he should have said who are
