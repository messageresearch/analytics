What a what a tremendous hour to serve the Lord. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. We have some things on our heart and Amen. I just wonder maybe just for a moment before we go into the word. If we could just bow our heart for a word of prayer, let's just speak to the author of the book tonight and ask him for his mercy. Father, we thank you tonight for your word. And truly, Lord, that you have given [music] us this great age to live in. Lord, a prophet that had vision could look across the spans of time. And he said this was the greatest of all the [music] ages to live. And Lord, oh what it must be tonight for us to know the grace that you have shown this gentile dispensation. [music] We ask you tonight Lord that you would enter in the courts of this place Lord as we have prepared and Lord we have done what could be done from our side. But we ask you tonight that [music] you would come in, Lord, and that you would bring these things alive, Lord. That you would give us mercy and understanding, Lord, [music] above all things, Lord. We pray tonight that revelation would strike our hearts as we study your word, Lord. We ask that you would speak to us through it, Father, as we commit these things to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, [music] we pray. Amen and amen. And God bless you tonight. If you have your Bibles, we'd like to go into the book of Hebrews, uh, the first chapter. Hebrews chapter 1, uh, and I'm going to be reading Hebrews 1 and 1 and verse two. Hebrews 1 1 and two. Um, I'm going to, uh, be speaking tonight, Lord willing, uh, from the book of Hebrews. Uh, it's been on me for, uh, last couple years. I've studied through this book speaking different portions, but it's just on my heart to maybe do a little bit more deeper research in the book and just carry it through it. And after listening to brother Brandham uh for a couple times through his series on the Hebrews, it's just more on my heart than ever. Amen. So, we just want to read tonight if we can from Hebrews chapter 1. I'm just going to take the first two verses here. And God who at sunundra times and in diver manners spake in the times past unto the father unto the fathers by the prophets. But he hath in this last day spoken unto us by his son when he hath appointed heir whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. May God bless his word. As you could be seated tonight, I want to speak to you on the the book of Hebrews. This will be a a a first part of a series. This is kind of more of an introduction tonight. Um just listening to the prophet and uh and and some of the things that he spoke on the book of Hebrews. If you've never listened to the series, uh I implore you just to take some time throughout the next month or two or next week or so, however you listen. Uh but start with that Hebrews chapter 1 and just move through that series. It's a beautiful series. You'll learn a lot. It'll it'll really speak to you. Brother Brandham, it just slows way down and just speaks and and goes across the scripture. It's just marvelous to sit and listen to him. Amen. And uh and and and phone that series. I would like to tonight I'm not really I can explain myself in saying this. I'm not really maybe just going through the book uh of what brother Brandham taught. He says the book of Hebrews. There actually is a book called the Hebrews book. We have it in the message. But I'm not really doing so much a deep study on that book as I am the book of the Bible, the book of Hebrews. And then using brother Brandham so that we can go using him uh his uh expository look at that book. But tonight would be maybe more of an introduction into this book. And I I just thought as we were reading it that it would be good uh maybe to look at uh uh at what what it is and and what it does for us and why that it would be important to us as a church. Uh this is a powerful uh first of all I'd say that when you're reading the Bible I think the Bible itself uh if you sometimes I don't know uh if we're always aware of how powerful it is of what we're doing when we read scripture uh of how much it makes a difference in our life and and what what it does in giving us uh power in our hearts. Uh I I think of this in the scriptures uh written within the Bible itself. Uh in 2 Timothy 3 and:e 16 the Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and for instruction in righteousness. That's what the word of God is good for. It is good for doctrine. It is good for reproof and for correction and instruction. Now, the Bible that we read and and we speak from so much and the one you carry has great value. Don't never let anyone take from you the value of the Bible you have. And I know that it's been compiled and been written. Uh there's over 40 different writers. There's over 1,600 years that is covered. And I love how brother Brandham says in Christ revealed in his word. He said it was written by 40 different writers. 40 men wrote the Bible over a space of 1,600 years at different times predicting the most important events that ever happened in world's history. Many times hundreds of years before it ever happens. And there's not an error in the entire 66 books. No author but God himself could be so accurate. Not one word contradicts the other. Now &gt;&gt; you think about the the Bible itself. If you've read read the book of Daniel, you read about historical events where he's he's talking about uh actually the events of people who control the whole world and and and like you're talking about the Greeks and you're talking about the Mes and Persians and there's actually people that believe that Daniel wrote the book post all of those er that era because it's so exactly precise in its reading that they can't believe that a man could predict it so so so wonderfully before it ever happened. See, but God actually knows all things and he knows the end from the beginning. And he can tell you about tomorrow like it was yesterday because he knows it before it happens. Now remember this Bible was written by them. Uh brother man actually compares it. He said you take 66 medical books that deals with the body and get 40 different medical schools and get them over a 1600 year period and see what kind of continuity you'd come up with there. I'll tell you what. Yeah. Y'all know, amen. Even since uh the Second World War when the the when the Nazis done so much experiments on the Jews, God God help them. Amen. But look at the change in in modern science and look at the the increase of medical science and even uh lately we had the CO in in the in the 20s 20s. Remember how when they first started treating it, they was writing articles, this is the way you got to do it, the way you got to do it. And by the time it was over, they found out they wasn't doing it right on many cases because because uh you know, you get five different men, you get five different opinions, you get a hundred men, you get a hundred opinions. Amen. And and you find out that there is so many different opinions. It there's there's not any uh books that are written over a large scan of time that that's going to uh uh complement one with the other. They're going to contradict. But the Bible is actually the only book that has the same author. Amen. Throughout the entire Bible. So it might have been 40 different writers. But the God of heaven is the author of the Bible. It is breathed out by God. Now in Christ revealed in the word, the B prophet said it like this. Not one word of the Bible contradicts the other and not one prophet ever contradicted the other. He says there everyone perfect. And when they one come and did prophesy, it was a real prophet raised up and called down. that it was made manifest. See, so the Bible is the word of God to the true believer. &gt;&gt; The Bible is the word of God to the believer. Now, in in in the scripture, Jesus said in Matthew 5, he said, "For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tit and no wise will pass from the law till it all be fulfilled." So, heavens and earth could fail, but not the word of God. Excuse me. In Matthew 24 and35, Jesus said, "Heavens and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away." Amen. In Numbers 23:19, he said, "God is not a man that he should lie, neither the son of man that he should repent. He has said and shall not do it or hath spoken and he shall not make it good." In Psalms 19:7, the law of the Lord is perfect as for the converting of the soul, and the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. In Psalms 89 and 34, for my covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing which is gone out of my lips. In Psalms in Proverbs 30 and5, for every word of God is pure. He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. In Isaiah 40 and8, the grass witherth and the flower fadeth, but the word of God it standeth forever. In Isaiah 55 and 111, so shall my word be goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that what I please, and it shall prosper where unto the thing I sent it. in Titus 1 and2 in the hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began. Now I'm going to touch the book of Hebrews here for a moment in the sixth chapter. NOW WHEN GOD MADE promises to Abraham because he could swear by none greater he swore by himself saying surely bless and I will bless and multiply and I will multiply. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verilely swear by the greater, and an oath of confirmation is to them the end of all strife. Wherein God more willing abundantly to show unto the heirs a promise, that's us, the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things. By two immutable things. How many knows what it means? Two immutable things. Immutable means, Amen. unchangeable. In other words, the prophet said there's two immutables here. He said he is God that can't lie. And number two, he gives a promise. So there's two things here. The God that can't lie has gave you a promise. And somebody can promise you anything. Amen. And that's good to get a promise. But if somebody can't lie and then they make a promise, brother, you got assurityity then. And the Bible said that they would have a strong consolation. Now in 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 24, for all the flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass, the grass witherth, and the flower therefore fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this is the word by which the gospel is preached unto you. In Revelations 3 and:14, "And unto the angel of the church of Leodysans, these things saith the amen, THE FAITHFUL and the true witness, the beginning of the creation of God." Now, I've just took a few of the scriptures from the Bible that declare unto us that if we believe the Bible is the word of God, and I do believe that. And I I believe that every true Christian must believe that the Bible is the word of God. And if it is THE WORD OF GOD, then it is unfailing. It is inherent. It is unccorruptible. Amen. It is the word that endureth forever. Amen. Is that right? AMEN. NOW, THE PROPHET has something beautiful to say in the message. Why? He said, "I just love this old blessed Bible. I think it is the grandest thing. I think that it is God. It is God in letter form." &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. Christ revealed in his old word. It's the Old Testament alone. It's more than 2,000 times those prophets had said, "Thus saith the Lord." Over 500 times just in the first four books of the Bible. Amen. WITH MOSES, BROTHER RAM SAID, "These men being prophets, it's not me. I have nothing to do with it. It's thus saith the Lord. So the Bible is thus saith the Lord by the prophets. My goodness. No wonder Paul begins his letter to the Hebrews by saying to them, God who at sundried times end man. It didn't say man in sundry times and diverse manners. He said God in sundry times and diverse manners. WHO WAS IT SPEAKING throughout the ages? IT WAS GOD. IT wasn't It wasn't prophets. It wasn't mortals. I'm quoting. He says it was God in Sundra times. Now, now you we look tonight and and we read the book of Hebrews. And as we read it, Amen. There's many theologian tonight that don't know for sure who wrote the Bible. There's uh the book of of Hebrews. There's a lot of people who are who are uh wondering who wrote the book. Amen. But but you know, Brother Bram comes back and says, "But if you got any spiritual discernment, you would know it was Paul that wrote it." Amen. But you know, it's a funny thing. The reason a lot of people, a lot of the theologians don't want to believe that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews because they said Paul believes in eternal security and teaches it in Ephesians and Romans, but in the book of Hebrews, the sixth chapter, it sounds like a man could lose his salvation. So, they didn't want to contribute the book of Hebrews to Paul because of that. But you know what I found out? Amen. If you know how to read Hebrews 6, it has nothing to do with a man losing his salvation. BUT IT'S EVERYTHING to do meaning that when man receives salvation, he receives eternal salvation. AND IF GOD GIVE YOU SALVATION, HE GAVE YOU ETERNAL SALVATION. HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU SALVATION. You gain and lose. HE GIVES YOU ETERNAL SALVATION. HE'S AN ETERNAL GOD WITH ETERNAL REDEMPTION AND RETURN SALVATION. And the one that wrote that book of Hebrews was Paul. But brother Bram said, "Not really Paul." He says, "Because we just said God wrote it." He said, "In some it says,"Well, you said Paul wrote it." He said, "Really? Not Paul." BUT IT WAS GOD that was in Paul. It was the creative being inside Paul. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Who wrote the book of Hebrews? The creative being that was inside of Paul. My what a what a powerful thing that the creative being of God COULD GET IN A MAN, PUT PEN UPON a paper, and 2,000 years later, we would be reading IT BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD IS GOOD TO ALL people at all times and of all ages. If I wrote a letter to you, buddy, that would be good for me and you. That's all that letter would ever be good for. But when God writes a letter, that letter is good for all men at all time, for all ages. BECAUSE WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD GETS ON HIS WORD, it makes it alive. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later, the prophet speaking of the book of Hebrews, beautiful things he would have to say about it. He said, "We're studying the book of Hebrews, and it is one of the deepest, richest books that is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The deepest richest books that's in the Bible." Amen. Brother Bam says it like this. In law having a shadow, the book of Hebrews was to the Jews. Amen. And it was for the separating of law from grace. The book of Hebrews is to the Jew and it was for the separating of law and grace. Have you ever thought about I just thought about this week. Have you ever thought about the Jews receiving the book of Hebrews in their time? But honestly, they will be reading the book of Hebrews in the tribulation. &gt;&gt; YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? THAT WHAT WHAT BOOK WILL they read in the tribulation period? What would they be studying? what they they're going TO READ THE SAME BIBLE THAT YOU'RE READING TONIGHT. They'll be reading that over in the tribulation period and they'll read this same book of Hebrews and realize amen through prophetic uh uh course of course but God will steer them back to the things that Paul taught in the book of Hebrews when he was there because it was Hebrews to the Jews and it is separating law from grace. Amen. Now, brother Ram said there had been many disputes in the church of whether they should eat meat or whether they should associate with Gentiles. And I think Paul was writing this epistles to them. Hebrews is one of the most outstanding letters in the book. &gt;&gt; And to me, it's great because it's showing the law and grace and it's separating the two. &gt;&gt; And look what he done it again. It's separating the two. In Hebrews chapter 1, brother Bam said, "And he's had all of his experiences. But first, the experience was proven." And this is the key letter. This is his key letter. He calls the book of Hebrews Paul's key letter. It's the richest, deepest book of the Bible. It is a key letter. Amen. And it is one of the most outstanding letter. That's what the prophet has to say about the book of Hebrews. So, I I want to take more than just a casual look at it as we study it because it is rich and is deep and it has something for the church of the living God. Brother Bam said, "I believe with a little spiritual discernment, we would see that St. Paul wrote this book." And and tonight you're sitting here and and you know, I just appreciate a a prophet. Don't you? Because theologians uh can't come to this reality tonight. They can't just say, "Well, Paul wrote it." Because they can't they can't nail it down. But you and I under vindicated prophet, we can just take his word for it. Paul wrote it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul wrote it. AND PAUL, AMEN, was a great Bible teacher. How many realize is Paul was an Old Testament Bible scholar? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul was an Old Testament Bible scholar. And brother Ramon says, "See that's what we learned. He said under that great teacher, one of the greatest of his days of Galia. He was versed in the Old Testament. He knew it well. He was a persecutor of the way of Christ's ways. He had been trained in the Old Testament under teachers, but the teachers are usually carnal. I I hope I don't say anything wrong, but usually if a man is just teaching the ways of his schools, it's usually man-made. It isn't inspired. But because it becomes a doctrine of a school, we have it today. Presbyterians and Lutheran and Pentecostals, and they have their schools of theory, and they just wind the scriptures into it. See, but let me just break right there and say this. Paul was taught of Galia. You know your Bible says that, right? It says in Acts 22 and verse three, I'm verily a man which am a Jew. I was born in Tarsus in a city of Cecilia, yet brought up in the city at the feet of Galia, &gt;&gt; and taught according to perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous towards God as you all are this day." Now Paul is speaking Hebrew unto them at the temple and they're amazed that this Roman is speaking Hebrew. But he starts to tell them, "Hey, look, I'm much Hebrew as you are Hebrew." Amen. And I was taught the law by the greatest teacher y'all got, Galia. And he was explaining this to him. Now, if you look in Acts chapter 5 and verse 34, Amen. It's told in the book of Acts, amen, that Galia was more than just an average teacher. The Bible said he is named Gabelia a doctor of the law. And he had a reputation among all people. So if you wanted to know something about the Old Testament, Galia was the go-to guy. HE WAS THE GUY THAT EVERYBODY would have wanted to set under as a teacher. AND PAUL WAS SITTING under him. Now you know him famous if you know he said it or not, but he's famous for this saying. Amen. That when they were trying to come against the disciples, it was Galia that told him, "Look now, leave these people alone." He says, "IF IF IT BE OF GOD, you cannot overthrow it." He says, "But if it if it be of if it be uh God," he said, "then you being found fighting against God." How many ever heard somebody quote that and say, "Well, if they're doing something," Amen. You just let them alone. If it ain't the Lord, it'll fizzle out. But if it is the Lord, you don't want to fight against THE LORD. AMEN. HE WAS A VERY WISE MAN. AND THIS MAN PAUL HAD STAYED UNDER. SEE, PAUL WAS WELL TRAINED in the scriptures by the word. And you see the scriptures, no matter how well you know them, if the spirit doesn't quicken them, then the letter it killth. See, the spirit gives life. IT MUST BE QUICKENED or made alive by the spirit. If the spirit doesn't liven the word and make it a reality to you, then this letter is just intellectual. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is just intellectual. I'll give you the scripture 2 Corinthians 3 and verse 6. Paul, Paul of all men knew this to be the truth. Who also have made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. Look, under the teachings of Galia. PAUL WAS KILLING CHRISTIANS UNDER THE TEACHINGS of Galia. He knew the law better than anybody knew the law. AMEN. AND PAUL, NO. NOW, NOW NO DOUBT PAUL WAS AT THE FEET OF GALIA learning the law and listening TO THE PHARISEES THAT PUT JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS. YOU KNOW, PAUL WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE TEMPLE listening and conversing and being taught while Jesus was walking the street. BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IN THE LETTER OF THE LAW THAT WHEN THE LAW AMEN BECOME ALIVE IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD, HE WAS QUOTING THE LAW TO THE SPIRIT OF THE ONE THAT WROTE THE LAW. THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LETTER WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM. BUT WITHOUT THE QUICKENING SPIRIT OF GOD, YOU WILL CRUCIFY THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF ALMIGHTY GOD. I SAY GOD, WE DON'T JUST NEED TEACHERS TONIGHT. WE NEED A QUICKENING POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST TO MAKE THIS LETTER ALIVE IN THE HEART OF THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. NOW LISTEN, I I I CERTAINLY know that we need it. Now, the beauty of this letter to me is Paul was a very learned man of the testament. And I certainly believe the Bible said that a man ought to study to show himself approved. DON'T Y'ALL? I DON'T believe the Bible says it clearly. He says, he says, "The truth shall set you free." You know what truth sets you free? The truth, you know, set you free. I'm not just one of them guys that say, "Well, let's just live life and get up and say what comes to our mind and whatever." How do you know what's coming TO YOUR MIND'S GOD or not? AMEN. UNLESS YOU FILTER IT BY the word of God. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S DEALING WITH YOU? AMEN. THE PROPHET SAID THE SPIRITS WILL BE THE SAME. HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE DEVIL CAN MANIFEST the same as THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST. HE SAID, "BUT THE WORD IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. SO IF THERE'S NO WORD, THEN YOU'LL FOLLOW ANY SPIRIT. BUT IF IT'S JUST WORD AND THERE'S NO ANOINTING, THEN YOU CAN that you could literally crucify the manifestation of God and use the word to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But watch here. Spirit must live. And Paul of all men knew that. &gt;&gt; Paul of all men knew you can learn the law and crucify the God of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Now Paul in the Hebrews is separating law and grace. Now, that's a very powerful thing that he could separate the two and he could show a change. Now, the book of Hebrews is going to be showing a change in the priesthood. Now, this is the this is one of the greatest books in the Bible because what he's doing is he's showing these Hebrews, these Jews, this priesthood that you have have leaned upon for your offerings and for your sin offering and and for your approach to God. Amen. these these Levites that you're following. Amen. It's coming to an end and there is a new priesthood that is superior to this old priesthood. &gt;&gt; Now, that's hard for them to understand. But but if you watch you watch Levi, okay, Levi was in the loins of Abraham when he paid tithe to who? &gt;&gt; Melchazdc. Now, we'll get into it later, but let's just take the introduction. Levi was in the loins of Abraham when he paid tithe under Melchazdc which the Bible tells us was which was greater that he paid tithe to him. This man that Levi would that Abraham would pay tithe to so then later when God calls the priesthood where's he call him from the tribe of Levi. &gt;&gt; So the herionic priesthood it was a Levitical priesthood which come out because that Abraham had met Mount Mazdc. So that's how they were to be. But according to scriptures, amen, there was to come a superior priest, right? &gt;&gt; But but you recognize that THAT THAT SAME PRIEST WAS SUPPOSED TO be a Messiah, which would be a king. According to Psalms, David David testifies and said, he said, "Thou my thou art my son, and forever thou shalt be after priest, after the order of Melchazdc." But it was the same one that made David the promise. His son would be a priest also made a promise that his son would rule on the throne of Jerusalem throughout eternity. So there was a kingly there's a kingly promise that the Messiah would be king. Jesus was said to he was coming king. Okay? And he also prophesies he's going to be a priest. So he would have had to come out of Levi for one tribe and he would had to come out of Judah FOR A KING. SO, HOW YOU GOING TO GET BOTH of them together unless you come after THE ORDER OF MELCHAZDC? AND AND PAUL IS TRYING TO DESCRIBE TO THEM, WE'RE A CHANGING priesthood that is superior to THE PRIESTHOOD YOU GOT NOW. HE HAS HIS OWN COVENANT. HE HAS HIS OWN BLOOD. HE HAS HIS OWN PRIESTHOOD. AND IT'S ALL SUPERIOR. AMEN. AND HE IS NOW fulfilling the law and bringing you under the real grace of God. Paul is separating this and he's introducing Jesus Christ as the priest. The Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO THESE JEWS, HE'S A HERETIC. HE'S A HE'S A HE'S A WINE BIBBER. HE'S A BE ELABUB. HE HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED BY OUR CHURCHES AND AND HE'S BEEN RULED OUT. AND PAUL is writing them a letter to tell them he took the place of your priest. &gt;&gt; HE HAS DISENEDLED your law. HE HAS DISOWNED YOUR PRIEST. AND UNLESS YOU COME under the order of Jesus Christ, you'll have no sacrifice for your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. He changed it. Do you see? Now, he changed he changed the law and he changed the priesthood. But there's something the Old Testament priest had, wasn't it? Brother Bam talks a lot about it. We'll get maybe get into it later, but right now I want to just put it as a thought. He gets a lot into this that the Old Testament when someone had a dream or a prophecy, you remember brother Bam said they had a ura of thumbum &gt;&gt; and that belonged to the law they would tell it before the euroma of thumb and it would flash lights and it would say it was from God or it wasn't from God. And brother Bam said now notice the Levitical law had been done away with. The priesthood is done away with he said but the uromothum had not been done away with but the new uromathum WAS THE WORD. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO PAUL knowing the old law is going to comb through the Bible to preach this reality to you from the Old Testament. I I just love how Paul how Paul had a revelation. Now look folks, I I don't know how to stress the importance of revelation. I I wish we could just take a brother Ray. Amen. you if if if you could get brother Ray to tell you the sum of his life and what is the most important thing for a Christian, brother Ray, he'd tell you it's revelation. &gt;&gt; The most important thing for any believer is revelation. You know, brother Ram said it's the most prevailing power. &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Ram said you ought to pray for revelation more than anything else. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Amen. Revelation is the thing that will conquer the devil. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look, when revelation COMES, I I I I I'LL show you sometimes situations don't change. IT IT AIN'T NO DIFFERENT. SITUATIONS don't change. I've often thought about Moses. Moses went to the burning bush. He took a revelation from God. And when he got that revelation, it's amazing to me. Egypt hadn't changed. His wife hadn't changed. The situation HADN'T CHANGED. THE DES NOTHING CHANGED. &gt;&gt; But Moses changed. &gt;&gt; And a MAN WITH A REVELATION CONQUERED EGYPT. AND THE BIBLE SAID BY FAITH HE SUBDUED KINGDOMS. AND FAITH IS A revelation of the will of God. AMEN. AND PAUL NEEDED REVELATION. He had teaching. HE HAD UNDERSTANDING. HE HAD GREAT WISDOM. BUT HE HAD TO HAVE REVELATION THAT THE MAZDC HE WAS READING ABOUT WAS JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD. Oh my goodness. If you ever catch that revelation, he liveth and abideth forever. My goodness. The revelation, the thing, his revelation was so great. Amen. The pro brother said it like this. Paul had a revelation of who he was and the thing he seen. His revelation was so great he let him write the Bible like Moses in the Old Testament. Great men. Paul had revelation and knew that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah of the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now look for I I it doesn't matter to me. Amen. How you divide things up. When you get done, you're going to have to remember this. Jesus of the new is Jehovah of the old. &gt;&gt; Now, there's been some Godhead teachers that got that all messed up. &gt;&gt; And they can't figure out if Jesus was deity or if he's Jehovah something separate than Jesus. And they got all kinds of messed up. And and and people say to brother Brandham said, "Brother Brandham, how do you get that straight?" He said, "Well, let me say what you do. You forget what people say and you focus on the word of God and it'll come one to you &gt;&gt; cuz the word of God puts them as one. Do you see? You remember some of you hunters in here, you probably heard brother Bam talk about it that somebody told Brother Bam, they said, "Brother Bam, take these binoculars here and look out there in the field and look at that analopee." And he said, "There were just one lone analopee out there." He said, "When I throw them binoculars up," he said, "I could see two or three." He said, "But being that I knew there was one out there, only one," he said, "I just kept focusing them binoculars until it just showed one." Do you see what that'll do if you IF YOU SOMEBODY TELLS YOU, "AMEN." If I'm sitting here tonight and I'm saying there's just one God, and then you start trying to look through the idea of teachers at that one God, they'll separate that, make three out of that, or they'll make two out of that. But I'm telling you, there's just one. SO KEEP FOCUSING UNTIL the revelation STRIKES YOUR HEART. THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY YOU THINK YOU SEE, THERE'S JUST ONE GOD THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN YOU LET INTELLECT GO AND YOU LET REVELATION CONTROL YOUR THOUGHTS AND KNOW THAT JESUS IS GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He is deity. &gt;&gt; That's right. And anybody that would would would question that, I just ask you to do me a word search one time on the word deity. That's all I ask you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see Old Testament. Amen. We finding out that God has been veiled and and God is speaking through men. God is speaking through men to give it. Now, if you're if you're studying this, brother Bam is going to liken Paul a lot unto Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a beautiful revelation when you start seeing the correlation between Paul and Moses. Now, I want to do something in that. I want to talk about the hebrews book as it was then to those Jews. So, you can see what it is now to us in this age. &gt;&gt; But until you see the importance of it to the Jew, you'll never understand the importance to us. Now in Numbers chapter 12, I think it's amazing here. If you're in the Old Testament, let's look in the sixth verse. He said, "Hear now my words, if there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in vision, will speak unto him in dream. My servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all of my house." Now, this will come up later in the Hebrew book. Faithful in all the house. Amen. But look what he says. A prophet, watch the verse six. A prophet, I'll make myself known in visions and dreams. But Moses is different. &gt;&gt; He's making a point. There's going to be visions and dreams. You're going to see people have visions and dreams. But Moses is going to be different. He said, "With him, I speak mouthto mouth. Even apparently and not in the dark speeches and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold. Wherefore were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?" And this is when Miriam and Aaron had had had laughed at him over his marriage. And they were arguing with brother Brandham over biracial marriage. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Bad idea. Don't argue with the prophet over anything. He's not a normal prophet. Okay? &gt;&gt; It's just not. If Brother Ram says something, just just just go on with it, you know. Don't just obey the voice of the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he was different. Now, he was different than normal. See, watch watch here in paragraph 171. Brother Bam says he was different. His message was different. He was different from priest. He was different from anything. See, he was a different person. Now, the people had seen something had happened. And God had veiled himself in his prophet to speak his words to them. That's what he had done. Moses was that living word of God to the people. And he veiled by that pillar of fire speaking what was to be veiled later behind badger skins. Look, the words that Moses was going to speak was going to go in THEIR HOLY PLACE. CAN YOU IMAGINE? A MAN COULD SPEAK WORDS. HE COULD SPEAK WORDS THAT WOULD BE PLACED BEHIND THAT BADGER SKIN THAT MAN COULDN'T even look TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WAS WRITTEN. THEY WERE SO POWERFUL. This man was not JUST ANOTHER PROPHET. AMEN. HE WAS A GOD PROPHET. HE WAS A VINDICATED PROPHET. Look what he says here in the unveiling. And brother Bam said the word come uh uh uh come from Moses first. See, Moses had the word. They were written by God. Nobody could interpret them. Moses had to interpret first. That's the reason he veiled his face. Do you see it? Here it is. See, WE COULD PICK IT AND PACK it up and everything else, but it's got to be revealed. In order to be revealed, Moses had to become God to the people. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before it could become what it was meant to be, Moses had to become God to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a powerful reality. You say that's nonsense. HE SAID EVEN HE TOLD MOSES HIMSELF, YOU'LL BE A god and Aaron will be YOUR PROPHET. SO THERE HE COME. He had a veil to HIMSELF CUZ GOD is always behind the veil. Somebody say behind the veil. &gt;&gt; He was behind the veil of Moses. BUT WHEN MOSES SPOKE THOSE WORDS, those words were God. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND THEN THEM WORDS WENT BEHIND THE VEIL. MOSES WASN'T GOD. BUT GOD MADE HIM GOD TO SPEAK HIS WORD. AND HIS WORD HAD TO BECOME VEILED. THEY NEVER WENT AND WORSHIPED MOSES. THEY NEVER MADE OFFERINGS TO MOSES. BUT THE THINGS THAT HE SPOKE, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE THINGS THAT HE SPOKE BECOME THE PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR THE BELIEVER. My goodness. &gt;&gt; No wonder what a prophet Moses was. Do you see the authority that he came under? Amen. Amen. Now, years ago, I preached a sermon. If you remember it, it was called the Elohim Revelation. How many remembers the sermon? And if you don't remember the sermon, that means I've got a brand new sermon I preach on Sunday. Elohim Revelation. Amen. Now, let me just say what what that means. In the beginning, God created. The word God is Elohim. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Meaning self-existent one. Correct? All right. Now, that's the one that Moses wrote about in the Bible. And the one he met in the burning bush. Do you all know this Bible that you're reading? The first five books of this Bible. Amen. It's actually the writings of Moses. &gt;&gt; Hey, do y'all know that's where Christians, Jews, and Muslims all agree? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You Christian, Jews, and Muslims all agree on the first few books of this Bible. And Moses wrote those books, amen, of the Old Testament, amen, and he wrote them. Now, brother Bham said, now remember this. Remember, he had no Bible to READ FROM. MOSES HAD NO BIBLE to read from. He didn't have it as easy as we have it today. &gt;&gt; He couldn't read his words as others took it. Remember, he only had it by revelation. That's the same way it was Joseph in the Genesis. There was no Bible. Remember Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy. None of those characters had Bibles until Moses. See, they didn't have a Bible. Amen. Now, what he's what he's telling you is is Moses is the author of the Bible you read. SO, WE CALL THEM AMEN. NOW, I know people get funny about quoting quoting men of God and things. Amen. And they call, you know, you you you better be careful, but let me just, you know, you call it the five first books of Moses. It's not the books of Moses. It's the books of the Bible that Moses inspired was written. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see then when Moses come on the scene, he had a revelation because he met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now the pillar of fire was what revealed to Moses how the Genesis Moses wasn't alive when God created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; BUT IT GIVES A VERY detailed account of the book. HE TELLS HOW IT HAPPENED. AND IN THE BEGINNING, GOD created the heavens and the earth. Elohim, the words Elohim, right? I think the word Elohim appears in the first eight uh 18 times in the first chapter or something like that and the beginning God and then in and God on the third day and God on the fourth day AND GOD IT'S ALL ABOUT ELOHIM. SEE AND ELOHIM did this and it's revealed he wrote the first four books of the Bible for he met God in the form of a pillar of fire veiled in that pillar of fire. Now now you you look and see the authority that Moses had was because of the one he received it from. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, that's the reality. He received it so he could say to you, "What you're receiving, I ain't giving you. But if you can receive what I'm saying, you're receiving the one that said it." &gt;&gt; Now, now watch what he's talking about. He's talking about Moses meeting the pillar of fire to write the Old Testament law. Okay? Now, when Paul met the same one on the road, isn't that amazing? Paul met the same one. The same one that was in that burning bush that talked to Moses. How did Moses know what he said to Abraham at the tent? Y'all ever THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? ABRAHAM'S TALKING AND in the book of Genesis the 18th chapter, MOSES IS ABRAHAM'S TALKING TO THIS ANGEL in his uh the Lord Abraham calls him and he's talking to him and he tells Sarah, "What you're thinking in your heart?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, who told who told Moses that? Moses never met Abraham. &gt;&gt; Moses never met Sarah, &gt;&gt; but he's telling THE STORY AS ONE WHO KNOWS PERSONALLY WHAT HAPPENED THERE. &gt;&gt; He didn't meet Sarah AND ABRAHAM. HE MET THE ANGEL THAT WAS AT THE TENT DOOR. &gt;&gt; AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO MOSES AND HE SAID, "I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB." AND AND THAT GOD WAS SPEAKING TO MOSES, TELLING HIM THE DETAILS OF CREATION, &gt;&gt; TELLING HIM WHAT happened to Abraham and how he got the promises and how it come. It was that pillar of fire. So, people Amen. Now, I I I don't want to get too deep in this area, but I'll just put it out there for you. Amen. But, you know, there was probably a lot of there's probably a lot of stories &gt;&gt; during that time, folks. There was a lot of stories and from Adam all the way to Enoch. Uh uh you know there's there's a lot of stories gathered up and then it crosses over with Noah and how many people sat around the campfire at night and they told stories this way and this is how it happened. It happened over here. Brother Bam said it like this and he said something about the tent and he said something over here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when when Moses comes along, he has such an authority of how it should be that when he writes it, HE DARES ANYBODY to alter it in any way. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS REVELATION OF WHAT HAPPENED WAS SUPERIOR TO EVERY STORY, TO EVER HE SAID, SHE SAID, THIS IS HOW WE THINK IT TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE REVELATION IS THE ACCURACY THAT MAN WILL MISS. &gt;&gt; Even if you're an eyewitness, you'll tell it different than the guy SITTING BESIDE YOU. EYEWITNESSES TELL EVERYTHING a little bit different. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. BUT WHEN GOD GAVE IT, HE GAVE THE REVELATION OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE. &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS SO ACCURATE. NOW, YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE PAUL now meeting him, the same one on the road to Damascus, he meets the same one. And when he MEETS HIM, AMEN. PAUL THEN BEGINS to write the New Testament in the Hebrew, separating law from grace. AND WHILE HE'S SEPARATING IT, HE USES THE SAME LANGUAGE PAUL USES AND SAID, "I DARE YOU, ANYBODY, TO SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M TEACHING." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? They had all them disciples that what would Jesus had all them believers that had followed him three years on the earth and Paul WAS NOW TELLING THEM MY REVELATION of him is greater than any STORY YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WHEN I'M DONE you let everything you say line up with what I'm teaching &gt;&gt; my goodness either he was arrogant or he had met somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he met somebody. Amen. He met the very one Paul's authority. Where do you get this kind of authority? Can we read from Galatians 1:6? I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; GALATIANS 1:6. I marvel that you are soon removed from him that called you under grace. He's telling the Galatians straight up that you went to ANOTHER GOSPEL. IN OTHER WORDS, IF you teach anything different than I'm teaching, you got another gospel &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST WAS COMMITTED unto Paul. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? &gt;&gt; Look at this. AND HE SAYS, "WHICH THERE IS NOT ANOTHER." &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE SOME TROUBLE YOU and would pervert THIS GOSPEL. BUT THOUGH WE OR AN ANGEL, Paul said, "If I come around next month and I tell you something different THAN I TOLD YOU THAN ME OR an angel THAT WOULD COME OUT OF HEAVEN, let him be accursed." Y'ALL KNOW THEY TOLD BROTHER BRANDHAM on the on the on the on the teaching of the Godhead about water baptism. They said, "Brother Brandom, if you'll tell us that angel told you to baptize in the name of Lord Jesus, we'll go all be baptized name of Lord Jesus." And Brother Brandham says to them, HE SAYS, "LOOK, IF THAT ANGEL TOLD ME ANYTHING ELSE, I WOULD HAVE CURSE IT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD IS MORE SURE THAN AN ANGEL APPEARING to you. &gt;&gt; Listen, WHEN THIS WORD WAS GIVEN, HE SAID, "LET HIM BE A CURSE." AND I SAY AGAIN, look at that. And now I say again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than has received, let him be accursed. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT WILLIAM BRANDHAM does not have a MESSAGE SEPARATE FROM THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; WE WENT BEYOND THE CURTAIN OF TIME. AND HE SAID, "WILL PAUL BE JUDGED?" THEY SAID, "YES." HE SAID, "WELL, THEN I PREACHED WHAT PAUL PREACHED." AND THEY ALL SAID, &gt;&gt; "WE'RE RESTING ON THAT." AMEN. BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ANOTHER GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM ENLARGED THINGS THAT PAUL NEVER WENT INTO. AND PAUL said about it, didn't he? He said, "I got things to say, but can't say them now cuz you have needs." He said, "But he had a big teaching on Melkazdc. He couldn't get over." But he INTRODUCED IT. YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN IN THE OMEGA MINISTRY, HERE COMES BROTHER BRANDOM AND PICKS UP MELAZDC AND FLESHES IT OUT AND TEACHES IT FROM GENESIS UNDER REVELATION BECAUSE HE WASN'T TEACHING something different than Paul. HE WAS TEACHING THE FULLER REVELATION OF WHAT PAUL TAUGHT BECAUSE THE SEALS HAD BECOME OPENED AND THE MYSTERY HAD BECOME CLEAR. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. I It tears me up when people try to make Brother Bam's message something different than the Bible. It's not elevating brother Bam's sermons on the level of the Bible. It means the sermons he taught WAS EXPLAINING THE BIBLE YOU'RE READING. He didn't HAVE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE. HE DIDN'T HAVE A DIFFERENT JESUS. HE DIDN'T HAVE A JESUS THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT WAS IN THE BIBLE. HE WAS JUST SHOWING YOU YOUR BIBLE JESUS IS NOT DEAD. HE IS ALIVE MANIFESTING THE POWER OF [groaning and screaming] GOD IN ITS REALITY. HE IS JESUS. AND WILLIAM BRAND WAS EXALTING HIM AS JESUS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PAUL was doing. &gt;&gt; It's not a DIFFERENT GOSPEL. IT'S THE SAME GOSPEL in power and in manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul says it in Galatians 1:11. But I certify you. I love how he say he's certified, man. He's he's putting his credentials out there. I certify you that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. &gt;&gt; Sure enough. &gt;&gt; This is not the fleshly mind of man. You ever heard anything like that? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. I NEITHER RECEIVED IT OF man and neither was I taught it &gt;&gt; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Huh? Then he done forgot what Galia taught him and he got a new teacher. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Saul was taught goalia. BUT PAUL WAS TAUGHT BY THAT PILLAR OF FIRE &gt;&gt; CUZ HE CHANGED HIS NAME AND HE CHANGED HIS TEACHING ALL AT THE SAME TIME. &gt;&gt; He began for he said, "You have heard the conversation in times past and Jews. How beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it, profiting the Jews religion above many my equals my own nation, being more exceedingly jealous in the traditions of my fathers. But when IT PLEASED GOD, WHO SEPARATED ME from my MOTHER'S WOMB, AND CALLED me by his grace, to reveal his son in me, that I might preach unto among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, neither I ran up to Jerusalem, WHICH WERE THE APOSTLES WERE BEFORE ME. BUT I WENT into Arabia, and returned unto Damascus. Then after 3 years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him for 15 days. Isn't it amazing? He when he has this experience, Amen. on the road to Damascus, WHEN PAUL HAS THIS EXPERIENCE, he has met the pillar of fire. How many ever read Paul? Amen. I I don't have time to read it tonight. How many ever read it where Paul met the pillar of fire? He's going he's going to he's going to persecute the Christians. And on his way, he meets the pillar of fire which he recognizes from Galia's teachings that this is the God that hung over the meeting in the tabernacle IN THE WILDERNESS. HE RECOGNIZES THIS IS THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT LED MY PEOPLE THAT LED MY PEOPLE FROM EGYPT UNTO THIS GREAT PROMISED LAND. HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE ONE HE IS MEETING IS THAT PILLAR OF FIRE AND HE HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY, "LORD, WHO ARE YOU?" &gt;&gt; Capital L O R D. A Jew is recognizing Jehovah as a pillar of fire. AND THE VOICE SPOKE BACK OUT OF IT AND SAID, "I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; I AM JESUS." AND WHOM THEN BROTHER BRAM SAID, "OH my goodness, watch him." He said, "I came from God and I have returned to God." If you wonder about the mystery of that pillar of fire, don't wonder no more. AMEN. IT WAS GOD IN THE BEGINNING AND IT BECAME FLESH AND THE MAN JESUS CHRIST THE DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION. THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, AMEN, TURNED BACK TO GOD. MET PAUL AND SAID, "MY NAME IS JESUS." AND PAUL, I'M GOING TO SEND YOU UNDER THE GENTILES AND YOU WILL PREACH FOR MY NAME'S sake and suffer many things. And Paul went blind. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? And God had to blind his eyes to open his eyes. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's the kind of blinders church needs, ain't it? It blinded him to his traditions and blinded him from his purposes and blinded him from his persecutions. BUT WHEN HE HAD BLINDED EYES, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE, HE SAW THE THINGS HE OUGHT TO SEE. AMEN. AND GOD KEPT HIM FROM SINNING AGAIN. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO? BUT GOD KEPT HIM. WE PRAY, WE PRAISE GOD ALL THE TIME FOR THE WONDERFUL things that he does through us. But what about the things he keeps YOU FROM DOING? WHAT ABOUT THE PLACES THAT HE GETS IN THE WAY AND HE DON'T LET YOU DO WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO DO BECAUSE IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD. And Paul went down there and it's always amazed me. They called the city the street he went to called Straight Street. Paul needs some straightening. So he went to Straight Street. &gt;&gt; And it was there that God told Ananas, y'all heard that song, oh Ananas. &gt;&gt; We got to sing that. Oh, Ananas, tell me what kind of man Jesus is. &gt;&gt; That Ananas right there. He went down there to Paul and God said, "Paul, go down there." And the Lord, the Lord's speaking to Ananas, to go pray for Paul because he's blind. Hey, Amen. You know, it's pretty amazing because he speaks right back to him and said, "Lord, he kills Christians. &gt;&gt; He kills. You want to send me down to that man kills Christians?" And the Lord said, "Don't worry." He prays. &gt;&gt; He prays. And when he knocked on the door and he got down in the scripture, the Bible said Paul opened the door and Ananas said, "Brother Saul, &gt;&gt; my goodness." Amen. Brother Saul, he had already become his brother because he knew there had been some repentance. And the Bible says he prayed and the scale fell from his EYES AND THE HOLY GHOST ENTERED INSIDE PAUL. &gt;&gt; You know what he did? HE HAD HAD SUCH A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE THAT HE COULDN'T BEING A JEW, he couldn't understand. BUT WHEN HE WENT BACK AND THE BIBLE SAID HE WENT THREE years in the place of Arabia. Now y'all y'all y'all know the prophet said that Arabia was the desert. And what Paul did is he had a spiritual experience. And that Jew was not about to accept that experience till he saw it in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Took him three years. Brother Ram said he rented him a little room out there in Arabia and went through it. I got studying on Arabia today. I don't know if you've ever made the study, but they but but Arabia today is not really what Arabia was then. And it's amazing. I I did not know this, but Petra was the capital of Arabia back in that day. I've been to Petra. It's in Jordan. It's where they carve the city out of the rocks. I was unimpressed completely. But if I knew Paul had been there, [laughter] I'd have paid attention. It would have meant something way different to me. I could have had tea where Paul was having tea. I did, but I just didn't know it. But it went back to Arabia. Now, this is amazing to me because this is something else I didn't know. Brother didn't say this. I found it in the scripture. But do you know that there's something else in Arabia? In Galatians chapter 4, Paul tells you that there's an allegory of a bond woman and a free woman. And he says, "One of them is Aar, which is Mount Si in Arabia." In the 24th verse, he tells you Mount Si IS IN ARABIA. PAUL IS GOING BACK TO WHERE THE LAW WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. LOOK AT THIS THIS THIS THIS LAW. THIS MAN THAT STUDIED THE LAW HIS WHOLE LIFE. AMEN. NOW, I don't have brother Bram saying this. This is just scripture. LOOK AT LOOK AT THIS. THIS MAN STUDYING THE LAW HIS WHOLE LIFE AND MEETS THE ONE THAT WROTE THE LAW, THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, AND NOW HE'S GOING BACK TO WHERE THE LAW ORIGINALLY was written. AND HE'S STUDYING THE LAW IN THE PLACE IT CAME FROM UNDER THE AUTHOR OF IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND WHEN HE RETURNS from Arabia, HE HAS THIS REVELATION THAT JESUS is the Jehovah of THE OLD TESTAMENT. HE'S ACTUALLY RETURNS WITH A REVELATION. NOW, let me just let me just take it to this point. Brother Random says this very clearly. He said, "God separated Paul so he could put the word together. He took Moses to the desert so he could get the law out of Moses." And do you recognize that God took William Brandham to the desert? But a man said, "WHAT AM I DOING OUT HERE IN THIS DESERT?" GOD SEPARATED me from everybody. And then the prophet said, "There come the revelation." HE SEPARATED PAUL. HE SEPARATED MOSES AND HE SEPARATED WILLIAM BRANDHAM. AND THE SAME, NOW THE REALITY HERE, FOLKS, IS THE SAME PILLAR OF fire that wrote the Old Testament, wrote the New Testament, and visited William Brandom to rebr. What did he do out there? He opened up them seals. He separated them. Now, watch what Paul is saying. Amen. I I got a bunch on that. I'm going to I'm going to close here shortly. So, let's just let's just move into this point and then I'll I'll come back to that. Now, pillar of fire is the experience that Paul is studying and he actually returns. Brother Bam says in the days of Moses and this they could have took a picture of it. &gt;&gt; They could have took Put the picture up there right quick. We'll we'll visit it again sometime. But the pillar of fire that they took over to the Sam Houston Coliseum, that pillar of fire, the angel of the Lord, Brother Bam talks about all the time stepped out of that light. How many knows that? I just played it for you. &gt;&gt; You said, "Where'd that angel of the Lord?" Brother Bam said, "It stepped out of that light." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'd seen that light and I'd heard that voice, but that angel stepped out of it." He said, "And it wasn't Jesus. I've seen him two different times." He said, "He's a smaller man than this angel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said he stepped out of that light &gt;&gt; because he was an angel of his presence. The angel of the Lord. How many knows that's God's angel? How many knows that when God took angelic form? &gt;&gt; Amen. He came as a messenger to to a prophet. Think about it. That pillar of fire, that's what wrote the Bible, folks. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; You have a picture of it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can read it in the book of Genesis and you read about it in the book of Acts, but you're sitting here tonight with a visible picture &gt;&gt; that the FBI combed over this picture and said it's not psychology. &gt;&gt; The light was there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took this picture and said, "Folks, you're better to look at this picture than to see it in the room because somebody might be playing tricks with lights on you." He said, "BUT THAT IS PHOTOGRAPHED and it proven to be the only SUPERNATURAL PHOTOGRAPH." NO WONDER THE DEVIL'S ATTACKING this photo. &gt;&gt; HE'S TURNED ALL THE GUNS OF HELL AGAINST IT. AND AND I JUST LOVE TO SHOW IT ON OFTEN TIMES TO TELL THAT DEVIL, WE'RE FOLLOWING THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE WE'RE FOLLOWING THAT LIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THIS MESSAGE. WE'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THAT LIGHT. IT'S THE ONE THAT WROTE THIS BIBLE. AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, BROTHER Bram says, is appearing among us to identify this message is right. This message is right. Now watch this as we close tonight. God in sunundra times, first verse of Hebrews, God in sunundra times and in diverse manners spake in times past by their fathers. That word in sunundra times, diverse manners actually means it means uh it's spelled p o l u m- e rs. That's actually Greek. How many realizes that the Old Testament is Hebrew, the New Testament's Greek? &gt;&gt; So if you're studying sometimes English words, it'll say it one way in the New, it say one way in the Old. That's because they're written in different languages previously. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Because the the actual word means this by many portions, by many times, in many ways. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God in many times, hundred times. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In many times under many ways. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By many portions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now you you say, "Preacher, why is this the beginning of the book of Hebrews?" Because Paul's telling you a real solid thing here. &gt;&gt; God appears many times. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in many ways, &gt;&gt; in many forms, &gt;&gt; but the central theme of this entire Bible, William Brandham took it for his theme song, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. He's starting the first verse with God in many times, in many ways, in many portions, but God remains the same. &gt;&gt; He's always God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother Nathan, the Bible says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth." And theologians have took that and called it Elohim. And every theologian you read will say the word Elohim is plural. &gt;&gt; But you know what's amazing? He's not plural in person, folks. &gt;&gt; He's plural in attribute. &gt;&gt; He's plural in manifestation. And that's what Paul begins his Hebrew letter with is that God appears in many times, in many ways and speaks a lot of ways, &gt;&gt; but he remains the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, forever. Won't you stand to your feet with us tonight? God in many times, many ways. I just love this book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; I can't say it with authority, but I think it's amazing that Paul would go back to the very areas where that law was written to get a revelation. Paul is dispensational prophet. That's what he's teaching. dispensations. &gt;&gt; He's a dispensational prophet. &gt;&gt; Moses is a dispensational prophet. &gt;&gt; Three years he spent in Arabia. Three. Three years. &gt;&gt; Isn't that Isn't that Isn't that amazing, &gt;&gt; brother Kyle? The disciples spent three years with Jesus walking in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And Paul spent the same amount of years &gt;&gt; walking with a pillar of fire. He was more qualified to teach &gt;&gt; after three years with a pillar of fire &gt;&gt; than the disciples with three years in his earthly ministry. &gt;&gt; Because he didn't just know him in the flesh. &gt;&gt; He knew him in the power &gt;&gt; of his resurrection. That's the way I want to know him tonight. &gt;&gt; That's the way I want to know him. &gt;&gt; I want to know him in his power, &gt;&gt; the power of his revelation. Do you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother Ben, I saw [singing] the light. I saw the light. No more in darkness. [music and singing] No more in night. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow inside. [singing] Praise the Lord. I saw the light. I saw the light. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, no more in [singing] darkness, no more in night. Now [music] I'm so happy. No sorrow inside. Praise [music and singing] the Lord. I saw the light. I wondered soless [music] life filled with sin. I wouldn't let my [singing] dear savior in. [music] Then Jesus came like a stranger in the mind.
