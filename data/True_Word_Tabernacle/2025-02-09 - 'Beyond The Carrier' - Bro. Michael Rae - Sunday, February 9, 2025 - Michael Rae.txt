past two months and due to my present condition I give thanks to God that I can do once again forward to my responsibilities and obligations that I have been given in this world was it for the grace of God that put me in a POS in a position of suffering that I could better understand what others have endured even the suffering of Our Lord I can only imagine that Christ endured 33 years of suffering in his flesh to have the character to lay down his life for his church in our society many or most of us rely on someone else to grow and raise our food sometimes we are exposed to things that eventually lead us lead us down a path that leads to conditions in our flesh we would rather not think about we all have responsibility to be extremely careful how we live I am so grateful for medicine technology that can preserve and save lives many of the faithful Warriors in this assembly know what it is to stand firm in their faith when it seems like their whole world was being torn apart they stood and still stand as a testimony of the grace of God to be test said we are witnessing the word and during the battle we all face in this life I thank God Almighty for the opportunity to be a witness at the hospital where I continue to volunteer and meet people there in needs in need and suffering I have compassion to listen and lead them to the waters that we drink from I thank

sick and you know you hear a prophet say that a man gets where they maybe trust in medicine or they trust in um you know when you get so sick but you know when you start seeing a baby that's small and

God for the the hospitals and the nurses and doctors we were praying for them amen but you know uh there many of you were praying but long about Friday night there long about 1:30 or 2 in the morning

I was just thinking about the need of our savior you know and it there was just such a presence came in that room just sovereignly I wasn't even really praying I was just sitting there meditating and it's just like he walked in the room and the Holy Spirit began to tell me that it's going to change now and it was such a presence that came and I I knew right then that there had been a turn of a corner and you know it may take 2 or three days for that to really manifest itself and you really see it but it's that moment when change happens and you know and I I pray this morning as we're setting in the service I pray that that presence that same presence maybe there's a need in your life or a situation I pray that when he moves through here this morning it's something will just deal with your heart and you'll know things are going to be different from now on and but we take these babies and we and we know that we can only take them so far but we put them in the hands of the Lord

thing Amen to see everybody here Desiring to be in the house of the Lord this morning I bring greetings from my dad Andis but Tom bisco and the church back home I would just I just became connected over these last few years that's for certain and just such a joy but Reay has been a buddy of my daddy for a long time and uh this is the first time I've got to meet Brother Ray though I've known of Brother Ray over the years every time my dad would come home from from Ohio he'd say oh my he' just give me all the stories and tell them how much he just loved everybody here and the families and brother Ray and the family and and I finally finally got the opportunity to be here and uh you know if I could say this and forgive me for being a little bit at home a little bit here and just you know I think of Brother Ray and through all the years you know I didn't know him personally but I know of him the family but you know if I could say brother R is like the just the epitome of the message if I could say that because you know not through the course of life through the course of circumstance through the course of all many different challenges and such but Brother Ray you just stood steady all the way through you know and that's the strength to us younger Generations that can see that when the word strikes the soul it really don't matter what happens what comes what goes and so you're just so blessed to have Heritage like that here and then to have brother Wayne come in behind now and continue that Vision onward I just say don't take it for granted Saints you got something very precious very precious here you rally around the word and we'll go on right to Rapture just right around the corner and so I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here take a part of the little service last night at the Young people's at the banquet just a wonderful presence that was there I pray something was deposited uh into your heart and all the effort and work but Nathan all that you've done uh it's burden it's burden God places the burden and uh some when it gets really difficult the difficult time the burden keeps you through it's that desire to see young ones get a real walk with the Lord amen and so we're just honored to be able to come behind that burden and maybe just support a little bit here this morning so we thank you we're going to turn to the scripture I could sing some more but we we won't we'll go right to the word I I also like a good amen that's okay you won't scare me neither we to see how the Lord moves but uh we'll just try and fellowship around the world a little bit we're going to turn to First Chronicles 13 5 and 12 5-2 part of the scripture that we know well the story I should say I'm going to try and weave a little thought I if I have to make some pivots I'm just trying to maybe circle around a thought maybe not so linear but maybe in a circle so we'll take a little thought and we'll go this way and then we'll go that way and then we'll go this way and that way we'll see how see how the Lord leads us this morning amen we'll turn to First Chronicles there we'll read so David gathered all Israel together from sheor of Egypt even unto the entering of Heth to bring the Ark of God from now that's quite the word I practiced it at home but uh or in the hotel and it didn't maybe even help me k k Jam how's that did I catch it I won't say it twice and David went up and all Israel to Bala that is to kjam which belonged to Judah to bring up then the Ark of God the Lord which that dwelleth between the cherums whose name is called on it and they carried the ark and They Carried the Ark of God in a new card out of the house of abinadab and Aza and a drave the cart and David and all Israel played before God with all their might and with singing and with Harps and sues with timberl and symbols and with trumpets and when they came unto the threshing floor of chidon Aza put forth his hand to hold the ark for The Oxen stumbled and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Aza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before the Lord and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon Aza wherefore the place is called perah peris Aza unto this day and David Avid was afraid of God that day saying how shall I bring the Ark of God home to me amen let's just have a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are so desirous that Lord you Minister this morning to your people Lord I look from my far left to my far right Lord each one of your precious sons and daughters are here Lord their desire ing Lord to hear from you and you alone so Lord I pray that you open Lord these scriptures Lord and you would take the words from the page bring them to life to your people that Lord their souls might be fed not by words of man but by words Lord that come from the very heart and Throne of God so I commit this service and each one here today in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats I heard that list of ministers that were here this morning I said dear goodness what am I doing up here surely someone else that could have been preaching but as I as better Wayne said I I guess we got a handful of amens out there that's for certain at least I sure hope so amen bit of a scripture we we we know the story maybe some have heard the read this of course maybe in Sunday school even and we we know this the uh the story of Aza and the cart and I just want to focus on verse seven there and they Carri the Ark of God in a new cart and I want to just take a little subject this morning called beyond the carrier beyond the carrier and if the Lord would just allow me to move in a certain direction but a carrier in this case was a a new idea or a method a new method to carry the word of God and the Ark of the Covenant was being presented and David he had this idea that he was going to uh you know carry the The Ark in a new way and you know at the end the day why would it really matter uh you know what was what what was carrying it as long as as God was with his people as long as it was the ark you know who who really thought and maybe David didn't really think too much about what what was carrying the Ark of the Covenant you know what what did it really matter but to God it actually mattered a lot it mattered a big deal to him as something that was carrying the the Ark of the Covenant Covenant and and and and and the Cherub them The Mercy Seat there it mattered so specifically so intensely to God he it he he he wanted staves of wood he had stated in Exodus it was staves of wood overlaid with gold on the shoulders of Kath because it says there but Unto the Sons of Kath he gave none because of the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon the shoulders not a wagon not some other Contraption not some new idea not some some understanding from some other man or somewhere God had decreed in his word a very specific way to carry his word and so God cares about the carrier all right God cares about it it's very important to him and and today and and you might think and I digress a little bit but is it Super Bowl it's clearing that off I did not know that I was I was preparing just some just the direction of the Lord and and uh and so as I just go maybe into this next little part here somebody's carrying a ball today but we're going to talk about a different carrier all right but I know that's that's maybe on the world's mind today and football's a big deal but I I I stumbled upon that uh after I thought oh dear they're going to think I'm preaching this because of Super Bowl that is not the case all right just clear that out of the way right here right now cuz I'm from Canada and it don't mean nothing and we don't it don't mean nothing so Lord has maybe a sense of humor and it's sent in way there but anyways carrying the ball is a big deal on the fields of your football field here you know and and so it's it's a big deal when someone's carrying the ball we use that statement because someone's leading on a project maybe they're kind of carrying you carrying the the the the responsibility of it or the command of it you know let car to carry something so often the bulk carrier can often be a coveted position yeah right somebody wants everybody they kind of you know that want to be that one that's carrying the ball or I've got it or you know but unfortunately the carrier also takes the heat he also takes the heat when something goes wrong he's the one with the hot potato and he wants unloaded but you can't do that you're the ball carrier you got to take both the good and the bad all right and so often that that happens but every important I know in football every position's important and and I'm not going to go too deep because I would show my ignorance on the sport but you know I know you've got your defensive line and you got your QB and all of that but if you didn't have your defense your QB's toast right that's how it works it's and so it's a team effort but yet there is still somebody that's carrying the ball right you know no one everybody you don't select somebody that is incap able of carrying right right you don't select nobody that can is a fumbler I can tell you if you're a ball fumbler and all that I guess what do they call it five points of contact you know you got to keep your hands or hold it just right or whatever and M masterfully able to to ensure that ball is carried across the the line there I can tell you there people are are made specifically I'm not a defenseman yeah you see my frame yeah no you got some big defenseman out there you know the the 68 610 38 85 you know 410 lbs that ain't me I'm not that guy you know and and and in hockey or something like that we you know you got the guy that can carry the puck he's built or he's made or he's got the skill set or he's trained to carry the ball or carry the puck or whatever sport you want to deal with there right so I should say the carrier matters and brother brandham says when you're playing a ball game and it's football season again this was this was before I even knew it was uh Super Bowl Sunday the thing we want to do is not everybody trying to take the ball away from the man that's got it he's trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal he says but imagine a team so untrained is find to find one man their own man with the ball run into the field and then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball to take take off with it and every man trying to take the ball out of his Hound his hand you're bound to lose all right he said let's use our influences as tackles am man let's use our influences as tackles he says not Runners tackles that protect the runner let's pack him let let him pack the ball through because there's no opposition amen we're here to whoever's carrying the ball you want to push him through you want to block for him you want to you want to be that wall for him amen he says many time in a church a little church can have a Revival someone will want to get out there and lead a prayer meeting and then he's got a different idea from what really the Bible says but he leaves it this way and he'll start an influence and draw others away from it that's not what we're supposed to do we're supposed to get behind the leadership of the word and blocking it in our influences and what we can it's a body of Believers amen it's a team and we're blockers we're kickers we're run backers whatever it is but we're to support the word going forth a man the man that's got the ball he says don't take it out of his hands try to guard him amen try but instead of that because he don't belong to your organization you try to take it away or some man so clumsy couldn't he stumbled over the flowers and a rug brother Bram says and then try to take it away from you he says that's right now spiritually speaking I mean he says we'll stumble over a little thing like acts 238 if he ever stumbles over Mark 16 how is he going to make it man you want someone that can carry the word he said let's guard the ball he said this is the ball the holy spirit is trying to pack it it'll condemn communism it'll condemn sin it'll condemn unrighteousness it'll manifest and glorify Jesus Christ and bring his person into the midst of his people amen amen we're packing the ball of the word God has trained you placed you in this hour he's made you so you got all points of contact on this word to make sure you carry it over the Finish Line amen we're carriers of the word amen if I got to twist and turn Dodge the enemy here and there but I ain't going to put a knee or an elbow on the ground amen we're not going to touch the ground we're going to keep up amen amen amen where are we we're in the fourth down aren't we amen we'll put a football away there all right I'm just setting the scene for you a little bit amen am man we've had a prophet that's received the word this hour yeah carried it further than any Satan tried his best to stop it yeah amen but it's been handed now it's been handed to the bride now you got a part to play right you got a part to play amen but that's the if I could say we could like I said and maybe go in a hit a few angles off a certain part part but you know that's the ball if we were talking about carrying the ball carrying the word and but I want to talk about life all right I want to talk about carrying carriers of Life a mother is the greatest I could say a greatest carrier of all yeah she carries the most precious little item yeah a little baby right you know Daddy when a wife is pregnant daddy wants to make sure everything's just perfect you know Cravings he'll go to the other other ends of the Earth he'll get whatever she needs if she needs a special chair he'll go get the special chair whatever's needed dad's going to make sure that his wife's got everything just right cuz she's carrying something she's carrying life so he's he's he's very conscious and nobody I tell you nobody's going to deny a pregnant mom anything that she has has any remote chance of hindering her ability to carry the child you're going to make sure she has it because she's carrying such a precious package I should say the most precious to all of mankind cuz she's got life you know we have a lot of precious things in the world we've got jewelry and photos and this and that and artifacts and precious books and ancient this and ancient that but I'll tell you when you handle life a little baby life that is the most precious thing such care is there when you have a little stuffed doll I'm telling you if it drops on the ground it's like oh whoops but you ain't going to drop a baby right it's got life inside of it something's precious about that and and a mother to be is pregnant she's carrying life amen but what is defining what is life what is that Define that for me well I'll Define that for you all right defining what is life well to man life has certain defining properties it's got organization living things are highly organized one or more cells with different functions living organisms have a metabolism and they use energy to consume nutrients and carry out the chemical reactions that sustain life living things have homeostasis they have they regulate their internal environment to maintain a relatively narrow range of conditions your body is continually regulating a very narrow uh narrow realm and range of conditions a living organism's got the growth it grows and it regulates it it reproduces and has a reproduction uh mechanism it has a response and so it can show irritability and how to respond to stimuli and a living organism is evolves as well its genetic makeup it allows for changes as it goes or under goes a change in in his genes as he over time that's that is the properties of life to man all right but who gave life you man can Define life and say well here's the properties that that can Define it here's here's how we can can you know this does not have the defining properties of life it doesn't have cells it doesn't make itself up it it can't reproduce itself it doesn't have life in it and so man can can design or can can understand that's not living but this is living but who gave that life who made that life where did that come from right right there's one source yes there's one source it it wasn't some big bang it wasn't something out there some Cosmic combustion that happened it wasn't some no amoeba that just kind of suddenly burst forth or something like that but life came from One Source One Source of Life John 1 says that was which from the beginning which we have heard we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life where did life come from it comes from the word of God that they came from the thoughts of God God is the Creator and the being of life he is life Amen in the beginning was the word he's the word in him was life amen and in Genesis we could say as Adam was formed in the image of God and the word life breathe life into the image like God himself breathed and Man became a living amen thing Breath of God if I would pray this morning Lord I want want that Breath of God to breathe on me this morning I want the I don't want breath of man I don't want this air nothing I don't want the Winds of nothing I want the Winds of his spirit I want the Breath of God through his word to breathe inside of me to breathe his word to breathe his strength to breathe his Joy that's the source of it young people that's where you get your strength that's where you can become like a brother Ray that's through thick and T through circumstance through down and hide the life of God surges through you and I amen amen amen it was a creator that breathed life into the vessel there if you can think there back in Lazarus day at time and he was sitting in a tomb dead and gone and corrupted in in the Tomb and they rolled the stone back as Jesus stood there said roll a stone back on the grave and all were standing around and what was needed was there was a body that was corrupt it was void of Life there was no life no more it had gone from the body but there was one on the scene that had the ability the word himself was standing there and he had the ability to speak what he could speak life because the word in flesh was there on the scene and he cried out Lazarus you know what was happening at that moment Supernatural CPR was being was happening as the word breath was being pumped into that body in another realm and Drew him back to mortality oh that's what life comes from that's what life from that another realm can do when the word speaks come on that same word is present today you might be dead as sticks spiritually speaking but the same word is here today to speak life into your dead vessel I say Breath of God breathe this morning breathe this morning and you say oh God I need a Rejuvenation I need something to fill me I don't want man's life I don't want natural I want a supernatural infusion I need Super CPR this morning to breathe down my body and Infuse me and he said unto me prophesy under these bones and say to them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word what hear the life of the Lord thus say the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath yes to enter into you and ye shall live oh they were Dry Bones they looked really scary and nobody likes a skeleton there was nothing there there was no life at all but he said something's going to change and so it went from drybones then it went to some senu oh someone was dead in sin wretched looking nobody likes a skull and skeleton oh dear goodness I don't want to see that but then his senu starts to come tendons and muscles start to form oh it looks pretty good now a little better little bit of Merit little bit of morals coming into the body hey that's not too bad flesh started to come subcutaneous tissue maybe some fatty tissue maybe he looks even christian-like oh hey I look pretty good you know I'm looking more like a body even dress right he's got a suit on he comes to church put some skin on that body maybe this little epidermis right here wow oh oh man he's even got a little religious spirit he says amen here and there and everywhere but until the life was breathed into that messel there was it was dead oh my God help me this morning may the Breath of God it isn't in your marriage it's not in your good morals it's not in what you look like or what your suit is or what your skin is or even how loud you say Amen but when the life of God breaths into you the word of life brings life [Music] Hallelujah beautiful it requires the Breath of God and man became a living Soul God cares about life yeah very much he cares yeah because actually it's it's his life yes in you and he cares about his life yes amen because now to get ahead of myself but you're now a carrier wow yes sir amenti it's not just halfhazard to him all things were made by him and without him not was anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man that's why God hates a murderer yeah because it's taking and destroying something that God considers so precious God himself breathed life into Adam and Man became a living soul and there ad was and a murderer comes and takes the life away it's it God takes that as such an affront to him can you imagine The Giver of Life someone taking what the giver gave wow then a prophet can come behind that and say that's kill someone's influence and you kill the impact of the life that is uttering forth from that being God gave that life God put in that character God molded that person to craft a certain influence that they could project a certain life in this hour and then someone would come behind that and try to kill the influence God is very very angry against that but BR says you people he said to sawblade tempers dear goodness that's always spouting off in the mouth he said you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right just go and tear it down you don't have to stick a knife in him man's back to kill him you break his character and you kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor say something bad about him you just might as well have shot him told something that wasn't WR about him well it kill his influence with the people the things like that you're guilty why because they're carriers of the life inside of them and you speak that word you say something it's killing the influence that they have God cares Bo if he care yeah that's why we don't defile the body God has a memory for body defilers and destroyers and corruptors know ye not that you are a temple yeah of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are and we can recognize it's a holy Temple it's a holy vessel why because inside of you and I is a holy life that's been been deposited inside of us maybe we look at our vessel just a little bit different and someone else's vessel just a little different because they are temples temples of a living God living in flesh in this hour wow amen and God cares about them yeah so The Giver of Life cares greatly about the carrier of Life yeah he gave the ability to a woman to be a carrier I was you know when someone has been entrusted to carry something that precious to God they are given as brother Brown calls to a woman a sacred trust yeah there's a trust given right to the carrier cuz God is the author of life and he hands it to you he says all right I've trusted you with this life what are you going to do with it yeah I'm going to speak I'm speaking spiritually but Brown goes through different quotes I'll just read a couple of them he says her body speaking of a woman's given to her as a sacred Trust From God she's the only one she reasons she's so sacred she is to bring forth life into the Earth her body is a beding grounds of life therefore that's the reason she's given this sacred trust and I want you just to put your spiritual Minds on as butter Brandon was is laboring through the invisible Union of the Bride in that message and he's going through and he's speaking very naturally but you got to realize it's because there's a very significant spiritual type that we need to watch and follow it's because that sacred trust is because of life and we're carriers of this unspeakable gift an unspeakable gift as it's quoted in the scriptures but unfortunately what happens is in this day and age brother Bram goes through the sacred Trust of Womanhood and the sacred Trust of of of virtue and the sacred Trust of motherhood and such that they have and he says she must not defile that she has a sacred trust it's her character how she handles herself and how she she holds herself before other men in her pure and such these are all critical and you can look at the natural but it's a spiritual type because God is warning and urging and watching his bride in this last day you must keep yourself pure you must keep yourself urgent you must keep yourself at hold your your body and your mind before all men spiritually speaking and he goes through and he can he the prophet Cuts pretty strong he says now keep the church in mind he said she's kissing and slopping and mixing around everything else but the word let the devil and education and scientific searches and so forth he said that's what breaks up homes talking about motherhood and breaking of motherhood but he's trying to put a thought through he's trying to put a put put put the the type through to you and I you must watch you are carrying life oh but in this age in this hour it's a little bit different because it's my body it's my right come on I do what I want don't tell me what I do with my body wow is that around is that around the world yeah oh yeah but you got to watch because it's oh that's just you get caught in some natural thing but watch the spiritual watch the spiritual natural type spiritual so if then an age that we see and all through the world it's my body my choice my this my that you don't have a choice as God's body his choice your choice is his choice your his your thoughts are his thoughts it's not what you think it's not your body I'm a temple of life from the Creator it's what he desired what I surrendered to to his [Applause] will naturally speaking I can live this way I can live like a prostitute I can do what I want I can HIIT I can inhibit life Wow and that's exactly what's happening spiritually my thoughts my way my interpretation what my friend says what this person says what my family member does I'm going to do it the way I want to I'm going to believe the way I think it should be I'm going to interpret the word and the message the way I don't see the quote quite that way watch it it isn't your body it's his he created you he formed you he placed his life inside of you oh it's so subtle that Demon's so subtle you can get caught up in it yeah but I say watch it yeah amen that's what the denominational Spirit started to do in the church it rejected life in 1956 rejected the word of life that was trying to be deposited into the womb and they aborted The Life of Christ and accepted dead seed from man's ideas and are no more the carrier of life but there is a bride amen there is a bride that's been entrusted yeah entrusted yeah with life yeah amen she's a type brother Brenham says she has the same precious virtues by Spirit given to her to preserve the spirit and the word never committing adultery with anything of the world or anything she stays virgin to the word as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband it's a sacred trust to honor her Lord's word above every man's Creed so young ladies and sisters and such when you hear the message and I know it can be pretty cutting and strong but you are a you are a type God is needing in this hour someone that can naturally type the spiritual where there are those that are virtuous and they stand with their character pure and they stand as a mother fulfilling all the attributes of a mama that is so gone in this day and hour some mama that's at home and taking care of the bacon and taking care of all the the the the household and her children and instead of worrying about some Instagram feed she's teaching her boys to be gentlemen and her girls to be ladies that's a Mama you are standing in this hour cuz life is deposited in you and you are actually there as a carrier and showing to the world that this word will stand pure if you could take that solmn responsibility upon you because you are a representation of the Church of God the bride of Christ you are a mirror of the Bride spiritually oh may you take that so so trusted so sacred amen and this world wants to defile and to wash it through stand may that be an assault to your spiritual well-being yeah why is it so strong why is butter brandom so strong all through the message because there's a union that God will not Unite with a deviled bride yeah yeah the only life she can carry she must be pure and the original word seed deposited in her womb cannot be a corrupted womb defiled womb and so God so cares yeah about the carrier yeah so cares amen the church if we go through the church through the history and Through the Ages through the New Testament Church was also a carrier and I just find how the word is so you know when you just listen to the message and you see how a prophet just starts to dovetail all the types and shadows through the scripture starts to mirror it through time and he pulls back into scripture places it in time puts us into this age to me it's just incredible I just I just Marvel Marvel at it how it just just perfectly interweaves and how brother brandham takes and goes back to Abraham and he starts to type Hagar and Abraham to Luther and the stock and he starts to weave this together to show us how this life has moved through history amen he says there Hagar was a carrier of seed but a Bond woman all right she was she was a Bond woman but through doubt because Sarah doubted that it could happen and she was given to Abraham Abraham this is where your seed is going to come from this is where your son is going to come from and so Hagar has the bond woman is there to given to Abraham and produced a wild man brother BR says now Hagar one little slight difference through woman not through Abraham now Abraham didn't want to do it but God let him do it because he said he let balum go on now notice by slightly different she brought forth Ishmael which was a wild man never conquered he lives by his bow he was a wild man he is yet today that's your Prophet see does not air with a Shu notice he said she is a carrier Hagar come forth as a stalk and then come pollen and then come the Shu and then come the sea he goes now watch these carriers he goes I want you to watch there how much does God care about the life the Seed of Abraham is deposited into the womb of Hagar but Hagar was the was a Bond woman and if you want to look how much God cares about life here Hagar is then pushed out and she goes with she sent out a camp sent away with Ishmael and there they're dying yeah Ishmael is now dying and Hagar leaves and and doesn't want to see her son dies he's crying there and and and and dying of thirst and dehydration but it said and God heard the voice of the lad God did not hear the voice of Hagar but he heard the voice of the lad why because in him was the Seed of Abraham actually God cared about the seed he cared about the life so the life of Abraham is was actually in there but corrupted with Hagar but God cared so he heard the voice of the lad and sent a rescue out to them why because it was of Abraham seed yes amen he had one thing he had car for one thing yeah his seed yeah in ishmail yeah L BR says but the Bible said Lord heard the child why he Seed of Abraham he hears the Cry of the children of Abraham and if if you're in Christ tonight you are Abraham's seed if he heard ishmael's cry come on if he heard ishmael's cry who is seed of the Bond woman what about the Seed of Abraham what about you here tonight who the spiritual Seed of Abraham through faith believing What If he if he heard itnails cry can he not hear your cry can I not hear your need I'm there I'm needing water from a rock tonight I'm needing the Mana from heaven I'm needing something but your Seed of Abraham just lift up and cry out to [Music] [Applause] him he said she Hagar was very religious but he never heard her the Covenant wasn't with that it was with Abraham's seed that's and he said he swore by himself and made the Covenant unconditionally between Abraham and his seed forever he said you are Abraham's seed if you're Christ and the same promise he made to Abraham is yours amen if God can hear ishmail God can hear you and me if God can hear ishmail yeah think about it yeah now hegar the carrier the stock doesn't look like the seed right yes but life was still in there yes he said but the life that was in the seed is in the stock that was Luther that little talk had many blades and it went off from Luther into ziggly and down in Calvin and others it didn't look like the original but there was still life inside and I was with brother Aiden I don't know where you are this morning but Aiden I was in the greenhouse there on Friday it was and he was talking about the cuting and I was thinking knowing this was the direction that the Lord was maybe leading and he he had a whole thing of cuting in there and I'm like well you know help me understand this cuz I'm not a greenhouse guy there's no green thumbs here all right not even my long shot and so he had this whole box of cuting there then he then he showed me in this little tray there's they're all Little Seeds growing and little stems are already going just from The Cutting they took a cutting off not a seed not a root not a nothing they took a cutting and they put it in the dirt because there was life in the stock there was life there and he just put in the dirt it was didn't come from nothing I thought that's incredible what is doing that the life is doing that it's still there rising to the stalk it didn't look like the seed but there's still life in there amen am there it was in in in Luther's time it maybe didn't look like the seed but there was still life there it was still carrying through that St and there when I can I just put my mind back and I try to put myself in little Luther's time there and they started to receive the word of that day and he started to receive the just shall live by faith yeah you can you imagine when that was revealed yeah Luther starts to realize wait a second it's not and the merits and and all of this that I got to do and indulgences that I pay for this pray to marry that and blow this candle here and light it there put that he started to realize it's by faith that just shall live by faith by believing we're saved by faith and he started to do and then the Bible started to come and can you imagine the first time that the commoner like you and me got to read the word oh my goodness I just imagine reading there in Psalms as they go to Psalms and finally said oh give ear to my word words oh Lord first time consider my meditation oh God hearken hearken under the voice of My Cry can you imagine oh I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil they could read it for the first time oh you just read it every day of the week and and well that's a wonderful scripture No the first time yeah wow I've never read that before it's been held back by the Catholic priest he said I can't get it but no that shall live by faith and by this word you need it you need to read it you need to read it oh my goodness hallu you mean it's not in deeds and doctrines no no you it's not in sacraments and merits no it's not in that but it's by faith in Christ oh can I read more yes here it is oh thank you Lord beloved believe not every Spirit but tried every Spirit whether they be of God and so then they could go and be like wait a second this doesn't match the word you're Antichrist because they now had it they could start to feed yes the life starting to Surge through the St they still believed in Trinity but it was starting to move yeah didn't look like the seed but it's starting to move amen all right imagine the word Justified think about it the just shall live by faith imagine that moment when Luther when the word Justified struck Luther I think sometimes the word Justified needs to strike us again and again because we can go through life sometimes we go through some difficult days difficult trials and circumstances but you were Justified I mean we got to come back to the original word here and just say wait a second what does that mean can I just go back well you know what it means but sometimes we need to soak it in and drink in the water because butter Bram says Justified though you never done it at all we know this but living it God don't see your mistake as I said to the young people last night he don't care too sense about your mistake he sees you through the blood when you when you put it under the blood he sees you Justified I imagine their old Luther did a couple little he clicks when he saw it I'm Justified I didn't do it in the first place his blood covers me and he started to preach that out preach that out preach that out say you've been Justified you never did it all your wrongs are all done done they're all gone God don't even see it no more oh you know what happened life started to Surge praise God Amen it might have looked a little wild but it was carrying something life butam says notice the seed goes in the ground it's the Original Seed but when it comes forth it brings forth a life but what does life do out of a seed of wheat it doesn't produce the same stock of wheat right then or the same grain of wheat right then it's the life of the wheat but it's in a carrier stage yeah and that was the first Reformation you said when Luther came out of Darkness out of Thea of chaos it had to die he said but after Pentecost he said it had to die are they saved yeah under that anointing that was the word of their hour but what gets what happens is when they don't follow the life as it moves that's right there's the key God's life continues it grows it was growing and those that got stuck and said oh this is good enough I'm good right here there's the problem as God's life started to move through the stock and now it continues to go and here we know it came into into the westly era whatam types that back to Sarah he said now or we need more Holiness and we're Sanctified now through the blood and the cleansing power of it the scripture says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord and in Hebrews 13 wherefore Jesus said that he might sanctify the people with his own blood and so this era was now moving into a different age a different a different tassel age and life was now moving forward as it gets closer and closer to the original and Sarah brother Brown says is a free woman through promise produced a kind gentle Isaac looked a little closer a little more closer to the na in the natural promised seed but it wasn't the Royal seed all right but ABR say now notice it changes its position watch nature forming to the word of God as the sun death burial and Resurrection then come the pollen that was Wesley and like the seed that what that life did on the wheat or the corn looked a lot more like it because Wesley the second word second word word of God bring in his church up come through sanctification a holy people a nation now separating and cleansing themselves and under Holiness he said in the order of Holiness and then when he gets Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him you say well I'm Justified I didn't do it in the per first place but brother R said he needs to continue onward he may be an immoral man or woman and he's a drunkard and he smells that drink he says it's still there but when he's Sanctified it cleanses the desire out of him amen it takes the want away he can be tempted but he takes he takes the want away and he said but he said he's still not right it needed to move further cuz it wasn't still looking quite like the original quite yet it was gentle it was a promised Nation but rejected the seed and crucified him yeah that's what that Nation did it wasn't perfect Sarah laughed up her sleeve said how could this be Abraham and I haven't been as young people for 20 years and nearly 100 years old me have pleasure with my Lord oh my she goes to my my my milk veins are gone how could I God said I've promised it yeah it's coming anyhow yeah he said so did Wesley that age as they came up as the life surged and through the carrier that life kept moving and as Wesley said how can we accept speaking in tongues and Divine Healing and stuff it's not for us in this day types it back to Sarah says how could I have a son of this age wow God said it's going to happen anyway that's right yes amen hold on to that we'll keep going God said I promised in the last days I'll pour on my spirit upon All Flesh he promised to do it he went on and done it anyhow amen God went on and done it anyhow he don't care well well I don't know is that not impossible God's going to move his life through regardless his plan's going to take place regardless amen and so there then now Pentecost now comes and there that that promised seed was no Isaac but there had to be another it wasn't a natural seed but there was another seed to come life now moving on continuing more and more to look like the full wheat but now it's pushing its way through to a restoration of the gift and looking so close yeah Mary but Abraham says it types it out of the Shu she accepted the word by faith like Abraham her father and that made way for the seed to be deposited in her womb but he but this was the shook as it first pushed forth and birth it was still a carrier still a carrier I know we can look at it and we do have the faith like Mary when the word came by her way and she said Lord be it unto me and she was like Abraham the faith of Abraham something was happening and Faith was deposited so she could receive word seed into her womb but she was still a carrier still a carrier Mary by no relationship but through promise just like Abraham got the promise of God the word of God but believe the promise Behold a handmade unto the Lord God had formed All Through the Ages to think that all through the Old Testament working and molding and shaping to come to a time as prophecy was sent out there 8700 and something years earlier there Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and all the Prophecies of God Through Time molded to it came to just one little lady who could reach with faith and that prophecy reach our womb and out comes the word amen Mary was not the seed she was only the shu to the seed is your Prophet the two others was carriers of Life only the natural seed Mary was not the seed itself but like faith in God's word brought a more real image right yes the Pentecost movement came as the G gifts were brought forth and the restoration of the gifts it brought more image of what that was supposed to look like it wasn't it it was a carrier still of what was to come and people got stuck somewhere there at that point it looked so good it looked so Wonder this must be it it wasn't it was still coming forth but like the shuck of weed a corn of wheed it hold holds the weed inside and protects it until it's able to be matured on its own then the seed itself that then it was the seed itself that left her just like the seed was in her womb she wasn't the seed she didn't produce her body didn't produce the seed God is the seed yeah that's right so her War womb nurtured it God's children have that same Spirit of Mary because it's still that life moving forth but again it's when they started to draw the boundary lines and say this is great this is is it this is all we need no don't stop there don't stop there the word's still moving it still has to accomplish what it came for that's right amen and out of Mary came The Original Seed yeah the full full potency of the word cuz then the word was now made flesh amen and walked amongst men yeah yeah amen it wasn't a carrier the word in flesh yeah yeah was the original yeah it wasn't a carrier yeah life had now come through all time through through agar into Sarah into Mary the word and now it had birthed by the spoken word the original life am think of it here had come the Royal seed now the mighty conqueror everything that had been spoken in prophet I now was there on Earth not part of God not a little half and half not 99% all of God was now deposited into flesh and stood there conquering ready to take on what the word had had prophesied for him to do amen God stepped on Earth not just to be well hello no he came with with business that's right he's not here amen that's right I got a whole lot of Prophecy to fulfill yeah there's word that's been spoken that I have now come after thund hundreds of years I've now come down to flesh to fulfill my word God was coming to me in business with man amen Pentecost was as Mary Pentecostal Feast look what Mary did now watch this look what Mary did wrong what did Mary do wrong he says at a Pentecostal Feast one time she was faced with a bunch of dignitaries and priest and when her son she couldn't find him anywhere she went back three days Journeys she had left him that's right problem one she had left him she should never have left him never leave life never leave the word how on Earth did she let the Living Word of God she knew who he was and she left him behind oh I know where he at I would have stayed right beside him because she knew something was going to come about who knows that what time but I'm going to stick close to the word and she left him never leave the word Saints like a modern church today about 3 to 5 he said 25 has Church left about 50 years ago or 75 left him at the Pentecost Feast Mary went back up with Joseph 3 days looking for him she found him where did she find him in the temple discussing the word of God yeah and right in the front of those priests those dignified Mary let the curtain drop he said and she did exactly the thing she should not have done called her the mother of God that's right he said she said your father and I have sought you with tears for day and night your father and I better around is claiming that the birth wasn't Supernatural wow that one little moment wow denying that the birth was of natural ABS ordinances it was a supernatural birth and your father and I wow maybe she was there in the PRI didn't maybe didn't want to stand the shame or the scorn or maybe well your father and I it sounded simple but brother brand goes right back to that one little verse in scripture and said she denied the supernatural birth God has a very keen eye yeah for his life all the way through yes not one moment would he want that to be contradicted or something bent or some idea injected wow yeah but Mary birthed produced a seed of Pentecost birthed what so now we bring you up to now yeah our day come on where are we come on where are we in this picture yeah say well brother M that's all history all right let's get to reality amen Pentecost age birthed a son of man ministry again to reveal and produce right what the Original Seed God didn't go through all of this just to stop somewhere in the middle and be like well the Stock's just good enough or the tassel's just good enough he had a desire because he said there's got to be be one like me I am the Masterpiece I need to have one that's just like me he's gone through thousands of years to get to this point thousands of years for you and I to sit here and receive a word of this hour that can bring you and I to Perfection All Through Time B says why it's the seed coming but now forming under the husk like this he says laying it out it's got to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen in the Glorious grain into the Glorious grain forming the perfect body of Christ amen yet except for a few he said in continuing the quote not but carriers for the children who follow them and go into Canaan land there were those that were carriers of the word carries through Egypt and the different types and shadows but we come to a time in an age where it's no longer a carrier sh brother Michael I've heard a lot of this before well I pray one day it just Thrills your soul amen because this is part of the open book when you and I can see ourselves in scripture not Luther in scripture not Wesley in scripture not Pentecost in scripture but you and I in scripture and in our day and our age and you realize wait a second he's talking about me that's what this message came to tell you who you are and where we are so there's rapturing Faith inside of you and I wait a second if we're out if the Pentecost was the was was the the Shu the tassel and and then to burst forth then who am I come on Amen who are you yeah come on PR come on come on I tell you what we said well the M our Min have preached this before you know you that are married did you come to the Altar and say I love you and that's the last time I'll ever tell you exactly it didn't happen yeah your wife would kick you in the Shins and if she wasn't your wife yet she might run out the door because a husband is constantly that's right telling you yeah I love you h you're amazing to me you know what and as us men we don't do it enough right true we don't do it enough that's right but he does he tells us all the time that's what he sent a message to you as a love gift to you and me telling you I love you where are you this is where you are I've brought you to this time you're my wife you're you're that original one I've come to this hour I want you to know exactly that you're mine he's telling you you constantly I love you I'm Desiring I'm waiting for my bride he's yearing for this moment he's year for this hour thousands of years he's desired to come to this hour think about it you know brother brandham he would also then talk in quotes you know he'd often say you know just as a you know g r a h m and six letters and he say but Abraham abh but he would never continue on like I see that but you know do you want to say the rest or do I just got to say it myself yeah you see that all the way through the message he he leads you there the Lord is leading you there as he said there he says notice the life that was in the husk in the stock in the tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed the life that was in the stock went one to make the other justification to sanctification make way the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself and you and I have to look at that and say so then that's me you got to come to that God let that Revelation strike you not just read this message be this message Hallelujah where are we at we're at the state of life that's moved past the hus it's wheat time so then that does what it it it makes you and I not a marrier we're not a Mary we're not a Luther we're not a Wesley we're not a Sarah we are the original word that's who you are I could say you're not holding the ball you [Applause] are you have the life in you you are the life oh we can just catch that the age of the carrier is over we're past it on there is no more moving forward we're here look at nature we're here there's nothing once the the seed is produced and ejected by the Shu what next yeah we're here right this is the Golden Arrow Lord for the bride R says notice now when the grain life begins to lead the husk and goes to make the grain the husk opens up and excommunicates the grain he says that's right nature exactly what she said in Revelations 3 we find Le an age put him out now see it didn't back in the other ages because there was something else to be made it just passed through and passed through I've told you all along there's no more denominations coming we're at the End Amen that's where we're at we're at the end in the days of the voice of the seventh agel amen that's when all now these scriptures begin to come to manifestation because just like Christ when he came down in Earth and came and dwelt in flesh he had prophecies to fulfill yeah amen and if we are part of him in his same life we also have prophecies to fulfill that's right amen that same life has come back into a bright church that's who you are that's who this message came to call out not to produce a carrier but a living revealed life in flesh again but Braham says we'll bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength amen hallelujah amen you say brother Michael I have there's no way I how can I don't worry about it it's not your life it's his life don't you worry about producing nothing the life produces itself you don't have to conjure something up you don't have to figure it out how on Earth am I going to be the bride you just are it will just come out of you because the life that's been deposited is his life I tell you the wheat doesn't worry about producing a seed it just comes it's simple and you've heard it a thousand times but maybe one day it just puts itself inside of onebody somebody's heart and maybe you're the last one thank you Lord Jesus didn't carry a portion like Wesley or Luther other ages gone by yeah like a pregnant mother she looks more and more something's coming there's signs showing that something's going to appear That's the carrier but now when it's birthed it possesses a life and the same life of the son of man is the same life that's in you and in me now the word spoke back to Mary says hey where have you been your father and I have worrying about you oh now the word go shot back and corrected the error and said wait I must be about my father's business yeah yeah but Brown says there is the secret of the message now the father's business he said what is the father's business could you think of the of what the father's business was in him I just pondered that quote I said wow Lord the father's business brother B says to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive fulfill what Isaiah said again the leame the lame shall leap like a heart and all the things that would take place like Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you like and unto me it was the father's business to fulfill the word word he stepped onto Earth to declare the Fulfillment of the word had come right amen that's what his business was that's what the business of the father was the original seed fulfilled the word that's what he came to do every healing every Deliverance on the cross bearing the Thorns bearing the scars everything he was continually fulfilling the business of God himself he's saying Lord I'm here to fulfill the business your business I'm here to fulfill your word I'm here to follow not my will but thine done because I'm here only to fulfill the word that I've been sent to to fulfill that's right amen amen he wouldn't deviate he wouldn't change course he wouldn't do anything but Brandon says that what is it now we if that was the original produced in flesh then when his bride comes in this last Tower and is the same life now beyond the carriers what is it then for you and I to do he says we must be about the father's business amen the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir he says we must do it what vindicate you know what that means to show or to prove to be right this is you and me the Living Word in flesh in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word became flesh we know the scriptures he came to prove to show what is right the scriptures that were spoken of him so then the life that's in you and I if we are Original Seed Life what are we here to do you are here to prove and vindicate these scriptures that they're true and amen that's that puts a whole lot of responsibility or changes maybe your Paradigm a little bit of what you're walking here for well wait a second I'm actually vindicating scripture yeah wow you're vindicating scripture am Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 vindicate John 14:12 vindicate all his word that's your and I business that's righten but BR says he didn't complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so he now works in it through his bride she knows that how does she know that because she's been given a message to bring her back to who she is to let her know wait a second this is what I'm here for so she knows that amen for what it was for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left off left for this specific time amen Eve couldn't believe all the word yeah she doubted yeah that's right yeah and all through time as that life surged forth people have doubted they'll hear not believe that there no didn't see that there God did not hear This Not Right But Here we are at the end hour when all this has been opened up to you and I amen and you know what we're going to do we're going to believe it all that's right because it's in you amen it's in you to believe it all you can't help but believe it all because if you're the original life seed then you must believe it all because he did and he had the life so you do cuz you have the life Hallelujah he says I am the Alpha and Omega but Abram said he never said anything in between he said I'm Alpha and Omega first and last he said the first Ministry and the last ministry will be the same that's amen so the outcome of each ministry will also be the same he'll be a day he said that won't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light what did the son of man come to do vindicate Malachi 4 but amen but it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet so Elijah had his part to play to vindicate that scripture but there's a you in there you and I have a part to play to vindicate that if there was just Elijah and not the seed on Earth to receive it it wouldn't be fully Vindicated but because you are here and you are here you are vindicating Malachi 4 to be right and [Applause] proven son of man Ministry in this hour was half of that scripture but you're the other [Applause] part says known as at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word it's to re born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth you are just as full of strength as when Jesus Christ was here on [Applause] Earthen manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth amen Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today thank you he said and I say there's an elected church somewhere come on somewhere there's an elected Church in bluon Ohio there's an elected Church all through the world he said it's somewhere in this world that's pulling out and set aside from those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention we are at the last days amen that's why I said to young people there ain't no more there's no more continuing ages there's no more continuing process in the in the wheat example we are here amen amen and the carriers weren't full strength they were portions but you're no longer a carrier therefore you're full strength you say well I don't really feel so strong this current age is so dark so vile on so wicked so perverted do I need to get this aurus out and give you a 100 more words of what this age is in darkness but you are sitting here today young ladies young men old ladies old men all of us are here today standing as Sons and Daughters of God anchored in the word I tell you that's full strength because the devil has put his full strength in this Dark Hour he's poured all Darkness into this Dark Hour he's put every website in front of you he's put every music media in front of you but full strength says I will not Bend I Will Not Bow and I will not burn that's full [Applause] strength you got 200,000 th000 demon loosed on you this age I can tell you what's in you is combating that and holding it at Bay you might feel oh God I don't know how you are because you're still standing you're still [Applause] [Music] here he said the world now the world has to be in a certain position to make the seed break forth from the dirt going back in Prior ages as it went into the dirt to die and it had to do that for that seed to start to come forth it had to come that way he said to get it up or out of the Dark Ages there's a certain position that makes that seed Break Forth of the world and he's talking about the whole world nature he said some people oh the silent God you know all the dark dark CES and then poor martys and brother Bram talks about that man that you know said God you know was was silent there when all the Christians were died he said don't you know the seed has to lay in the dirt to die to rot before it can bring life or bring forth again the age had to be that way then for that to do that so does the age have to be this way the way it is certain economics certain positions certain world orders all have to be in a perfect state to produce the life it has to be this way don't look at the world this is so terrible I got that no it's okay it's okay it has to be that way the the Church of day go days gone by the dark AG say oh God where are you what's happening everybody's dying the martyrs are going into the car the this had to be that way so the so the seed could go into the dirt so it could rise forth so the stock could start to grow it had to be that way God said just wait a little bit it's okay I have a perfect plan I'm forming my image my life has to come through just carry it on just carry it on and I'll form the conditions to bring it to the very end right amen say look at Sodom we're living in the midst of it it looks like we're in here in the debauched world we're seeing everybody's thoughts are continually evil indeed as it was in the days of Noah yeah oh look at all this homosexuality and all that as it was in the days of lot yeah yeah the conditions yeah are made allowed get life is bursting forth but people are falling away yeah scripture Our hurs oh God it's the conditions that are spoken yeah that's right for one purpose for one purpose so that his seed can lay in the presence of the Sun and break into Rapture amen that's why the conditions are this way they have to be this way I look at the way the politics and such are going and I see all the intertwining I've never seen I said to my wife I've never seen if I could go back in my in my short little period of time I can go back in history and I look at the Dark Ages I can look at all the Catholic church and how it was so intertwined politics and the church I mean it was under the in the name of God they were doing a whole many things but it was all political okay I can see that I mean it's like clear as day all of you can read the history books you read the message you go through the church you can see the the politics so interwoven into religion but in the scripture It also says in Revelations 13 to Powers raise up and in this day and this hour I've never seen the interweaving of civil and ecclesiastical so blatant that's right so blatant wow it has to be this way but we've been given a message we've been given Optics from a prophet but a Bisal preach Prophet optic years ago to see so that we can see what's coming so then you say wait a second the conditions are just right Glory amen we're living in the conditions that are just right that's why it's like is it today you know I walk out I would I took a little clip I told the congregation back home I little clip of my uncle that was uh passed away in a car wreck many years ago and I took a little clip of that and it just brought brought it to my mind I said wait a second could I just it could it just be days away that I'll see him amen it's time oh things will change as I told the young people last night in emergencies all priorities gets moved off the table when something comes up I'll tell you when that happens everything's off the table man it's it's different time amen it's it's home time all your worries and all your troubles and all your work issues and all of this family it's all gone yeah amen that's what I'm living for amen where am I here I am almost done the says the world has to be in a certain position for this to happen a certain place so that we can he says that actually continues the quote he says see it always pulls away from it the Shu and it pushes the seed he goes there can't be no more he said it's wheat now he said but here at this time he says but we're plenty green uh-huh he says that's right have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up he said plenty green we haven't got sincerity and sacredness and I thought Lord that was 65 have we been laying in the presence of the sun long enough to we that sweet golden brown color that's where we are we've been laying in that he was looking at it then but you know I was thinking in the days you know brother Bram talks about Kennedy and and and and all of that and he was speaking about all the the different politics then and Ahab and Jezebel and giv the type and I was thinking Lord if he was seeing plenty green at that moment what else was plenty green if it was if you're looking at Kennedy and all of that it was it was green he was looking at Elvis Presley and and Pat Boon and you look back like man that wasn't terrible at all but he was looking further of what was to come he was looking at he was speaking about homosexuality like it was like it was now and I can't imagine the people sitting there in the chair and me like man I'm just not wow I don't is that like that I mean this was nuclear family stuff you know Mom Dad dog child you know son daughter was all perfect back in the 50s but he was seeing it was in his Green State but he was looking forward into its Golden State the now State he was seeing further so if the bride was green then and the world was green then what about now you're seeing rock and roll media like you never seen you're seeing the the homosexuality like you've never seen you're seeing the politics like you've never seen it's golden brown time for them they've matured but so as this bride we have matured under a pure word in this hour Hallelujah Pentecost hadn't matured yet it was in its green but here we are hallu amen this is mature time I can hear the Buckboard coming she went through all that time of preparing getting ready when he said I'm coming for you it wasn't the hour it was a little green it was premature but I'm coming and so then she prepared and she labored and she got herself ready and she got that little dress wear ready for her and she started to put on the robe of the word of her hour she started to make sure she was dressed just right she had her veil just on her stockings were right her shoes were all shiny she prepared herself so then when it came the right hour she was ready it was the mature hour and she could listen wait a second amen the world scorned her the denomination shunned her they pushed her out you all alone you were just like your you're all alone your family doesn't like you they rejected you you're all standing there by the little rail but I can tell you the Buckboard I can hear the Buckboard coming and if you can just say wait a second that's where I'm at I'm at that hour who really cares about anything else right all that matters is the dust I see some dust coming what that must mean is he's coming for me who cares about the world who cares about your troubles who cares about your trials you're prepared you're in certain position for a Rapture Hallelujah it's Eve's business the bridegroom's business is he's business to believe his word yeah and his word says if I could take another prong off of the center of thought you and I live in a carrier yeah I sure hope you do we're going to carry your flesh this body one day be dissolved yeah time would carry this body here has some numbered days yeah but inside is a life it's carrying something right and this flesh is carrying what I tell you what it's carrying it's carrying the word amen but Ram says when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened made alive he said don't do this the body quickly turns to it why because there's something inside that it's subjected to he said what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection the body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin M corruption but now it's got the earnest yeah amen it's got the word inside it's turned Heavenly now that earnest that you're going in the Rapture it's the earnest but this flesh is unconverted yeah right it's still flesh it's in contact with this Earthly realm yeah these senses but there's another body a word body that I bypassed that I have to connect with and this fleshly body is only but a carrier for that word seed that's deposited in me and one day yeah there'll be a union in a moment there'll be a time when this flesh carrier will pass away and the original word body that was originally mine that theophany body it's no shell it will Unite with this we will be [Music] one that word Seed Life In You unites with that word body and this flesh will be a carrier no longer no but mam says no she Mary was Mary was not identified in the resurrection with him he died and rose again cuz he was the word she was just a carrier she died and still in the grave her body that's right she was just a carrier not his mother not God she was a carrier like the churches she shows she was just a carrier not the word but this body this body of Christ this word Body of Christ is the bride and inside of you is resurrection yeah that's right there will be a people this day this hour yeah that will not see death amen because we have to vindicate yes and be about our father's business yes amen do we not amen there's business to be done yeah there's work to be done amen it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we yeah I sorry I was just waiting to see if anybody was here with me on that than we that's which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord there's business to fulfill there's word to fulfilled you've been placed here to be about the father's business to do what he could not do the has to fulfill this right here I am that's right here I am I'm about my father's business today and I've got business to do you might got
