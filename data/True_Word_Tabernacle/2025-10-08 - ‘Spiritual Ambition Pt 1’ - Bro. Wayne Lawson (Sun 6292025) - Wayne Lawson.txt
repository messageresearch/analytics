[Music] My let's just lift our hands to it. &gt;&gt; Let's just bless his name this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, we bless your nameless. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're worthy of all the praise and the honor that we could give to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the high and the lofty one. Lord, you're so lifted among us this morning as savior and redeemer. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have our God, our Lord, our savior, our healer. You're the counselor of our lives, Lord. You're the the very leadership of our hearts. We thank you for your presence here this morning. and we we give you a a space here today, Lord, to come and speak through your word and bless your children, Lord, as they bless you. Now, Father, we ask you for your grace on this meeting, Lord, as as we would enter into this word. We ask you that you would come, that you would take this word, that you would use it for your glory, that you would speak to the heart and the need of your children. We ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you this morning. What a wonderful morning to serve the Lord and to be in the house of God. And like to welcome everyone here today, our visitors that are here. May God bless you. And amen. If you're new here, Amen. We have a we have a rule. It's liberty. Just love the Lord with all your heart. And Amen. And if you love him and praise him, that's exactly what we're going to do. Amen. This morning, I I I have it on my heart to speak to you. I know my my voice may be just a little bit weak, but that's all right. So, you just pray and pull and it'll be real easy and then it'll just come good, you know. And so, uh, but I just have a few things on our heart. I'm going to pull out of the series that we've been on for this morning. It, uh, it just some inspiration came and and, uh, so, uh, series interrupted by inspiration. So, Amen. So, if it's okay with y'all, I'll just follow the Lord. Amen. Amen. I like it real good when when we give him the right away. Amen. I want to read from First John chapter 5 and verse 4. Amen. First John chapter 5 and verse 4. This is actually Brother Bram's text from the message uh that faith is our victory. I've been studying that tape a lot lately. Another tape we've been really going through is the faith in action. Wonderful tapes. Uh also why Christ speak another wonderful tape. Amen. But but here from the scripture for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. Now brother's going to make a big point in this sermon uh that faith overcomes. And he starts naming a lot of stuff. And he comes down and said, "But but you know, uh, John lived in a different time than we did." And he says, "And my situation's not named." He said, "But see when he said overcomemeth the world, &gt;&gt; he he covered the whole thing." &gt;&gt; So faith overcomes anything &gt;&gt; that comes from the world. &gt;&gt; And this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith. Let's also look at Philippians chapter 3 and verse 14. Philippians 3 and verse 14. For I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling. I like that. Don't you? There's a lot of callings, but there's a high calling &gt;&gt; of God in Christ Jesus. May God bless his words. You could be seated this morning. &gt;&gt; You know, it depends on what you plan to do with your life. &gt;&gt; How you approach everything in your life. &gt;&gt; So this morning, I'd like to talk to you a little bit about spiritual ambition. Usually uh ambition is a word used with a negative connotation. But this morning I'd like to take the positive connotation and talk to you about the positive side of spiritual ambition. &gt;&gt; You know because of your natural birth, the way you were born into this earth, Satan took a claim on you when you were born through your fall through your your actual birth. And the Bible said that we all come in to sin, &gt;&gt; right? Born in sin, &gt;&gt; shaped in sin. &gt;&gt; And Paul said when we come into the world, he said everyone everyone fell short of the glory of God. That's &gt;&gt; right. and through your human birth and through the the coming into this earth, there's all kinds of things mixed into you that Satan uh maybe has took claims upon and he's told you that that you know maybe you've reached the highest points you could reach as a Christian or as believer uh whatever gifts you have in your life he but but you know before you were born here if you were a Christian a son of God we speak about eternal life and one thing about eternal life we can we can recognize quickly is eternal life has no beginning so it has no ending. &gt;&gt; So you you didn't become a son or daughter of God on the day that you were saved here at the church but you were a son of God before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; And according to the Bible that we so so believe that is an inherent word of God unfailing word. It said that your name was put on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So before there was a devil, God already took a claim to your life to fulfill something that would be in his own desire. So when Satan says to you that you've reached your limit or that you've come as far as you can come or that this this there's no really no use in trying because you'll never outgrow a certain area in your life. There'll never be an ability to reach beyond whatever he's saying. I want you to know that God had first claimed &gt;&gt; that God first claimed your life for something he desired for a purpose that he has. Amen. So it's not what you were born into. It's what's born in you. &gt;&gt; It's not the family that you come from. It's not the church you were born in. It's not the the situation. Cuz some people come from very poor beginnings. They come from maybe illegitimate births. And you know, that's a big deal. I know with some people they worry a lot about that. But you know, I I I I I thank God uh for a message and and and and sister Dalton asked Brother Bham about it one time because of something he said in in the sermon and and she went to Brother Bam. She said, "Brother Bam, what about uh the illegitimate birth?" And brother Bam said, "Well, let me explain that for you." He said, "We were all illegitimate through Adam, &gt;&gt; but our second birth made us legitimate sons through Jesus Christ." So you you know uh it really doesn't matter what you're born that that's one of the beautiful things I found about the gospel of Jesus Christ when uh one some of the first trips I ever made to India. I didn't know much about the Hindu religion other than it was a reincarnation. They believed in reincarnation but you know they got steps of life and and and and it's according to how you live in one life and you can be born after you die you're birthed back into the next life. If you're good you go down if you're bad or if you're good you go up. If you're bad you go down. And sometimes it can take a reincarnation of up to 13 times I think to make the highest level of what they would call life. But you see the re realization of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that one new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can make you the highest creature in God's creation. &gt;&gt; Now we know that because the Bible tells us that when God created Adam and Eve, he quit creating after that. &gt;&gt; And someone tell you why did God quit creating after he created Adam? because he had reached perfection in that he had created a man in his own image. So when Adam fell, he didn't fall from being a man. He fell from being a God. So that when Jesus came and and and died and buried and resurrected and set on the throne of God and offered back a new birth to the church by one new birth, it sets us back in the image of God, which is the highest order of God's kingdom. So, so you you it's not a a a birth and a death and a birth and a death. Amen. It's one new birth. Amen. That's one of the great mysteries of Hebrews the 6th chapter. When people say, "Well, you know, uh I was a Christian and I committed a wrong and and and I'm wondering if I blasphemed the Holy Ghost and I might not ever be able to be saved again." What a what a lie. The enemy took God's scripture and lied on that. Amen. And made people believe that. But that scripture in Hebrews 6 actually is saying that if a man is ever born again that he could never fall so far backwards that he needs to be reborn again. &gt;&gt; Because once you are born of God, amen, there is now no way for that person to disbelieve to the place, Amen, that he would have to have a new birth again because the Bible said you were sealed until the day of your redemption. Now, now just because you're sealed under the day of redemption doesn't mean you're a finished work in as far as in your character or your growth. You're a finished work in your salvation. You're a perfect person in your soul. Amen. I I know these little babies around here, a lot of them are perfect little babies and they're they're sealed up human beings. They're full life human being. Perfect little babies, but they're not perfect adults. Amen. But but you got to you got to continue growth. And as a Christian, when you're born again, there is a continuing of your growth in Christian life. And and if you're at an adolescence in Christianity, Amen. I know how it comes in adolescence of life. You know, we'll never get through this stage. You know, you're you're old enough to want to and young enough to not be able to. You know, you you want to go, but you can't drive. You know, there's all them ages. But listen, just hold on. You'll get all that responsibility soon enough because you're going to grow into that. AMEN. A AND WE FIND OUT HERE, AMEN, that what's really you're looking AT IS THAT GOD HAS put a seed of greatness inside of every believer that he calls. Now, the Satan has tried to limit that to your gene pool or to your beginnings or how you come. But but the new birth, amen, brought you into a different kingdom under a different father with a different genetics. And it's a seed of greatness. And the lineage of this church is the lineage of David and Joshua and Jesus and Paul and Peter. Our lineage is a lineage of greatness of great men that lived that were real men like Irene that could be burned at a stake and amen and stand there and take the punishment because amen they were they were men. They wasn't just a they wasn't just a a male. They were real men that held on to the word of God. And and you see then then your circumstances of your birth is not the limitations to what God can do with you as a believer. Now I certainly believe that brother Bham preached here ye him many times. And if you like to hear the sermon here ye him, it's brother Bham's uh explanation of spiritual adoption. And in this sermon he always details that Jesus went to the went to the Jordan and was baptized and the spirit of God came into him. And then he says, "Then he went to mount transfiguration where the spirit of God overshadowed him and said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." So he showed that there's a birth and then there's a a placing or a maturing of your life at which which he was calling adoption. Now, brother Bam wasn't trying to bring a new doctrine. He was just trying to tell the Pentecostals, you've got the Holy Ghost, but if you turn down the word, you're not going no further. You you can you can have the Holy Ghost, but if you don't turn if you don't continue in the word of God, then you are limiting yourself to whatever organization or whatever your teachers have taught you or whatever's happened. But see, when God birthed a son, BROTHER MADAM SAYS IT SAY, "WELL, brother Wayne, we were always sons. We were always sons, but you had to be born, &gt;&gt; right? To have fellowship, you had to have a birth. And then when you were birthed, God, brother Ram picks up the Old Testament and does a beautiful thing and he says God sends a a tutor to the church the same as a father put a tutor over a son. You know, he taught him in the ways of the business of the father until the boy could come to a place that he thought like dad, talked like dad, act like dad and and made decisions like dad and then he received a checkbook authority because his character and his father's character was the same character, &gt;&gt; right? And that is the goal of the church is that God would send the Holy Ghost among us and that it would nurture the church into the stature of the fullness of Christ. WHAT WHAT GOD SAW about you. Don't you set your ambitions down there on just church joining. Don't don't you set your ambitions just to the place I joined THE CHURCH OR I GOT the baptism of the spirit or amen or I you know I had an experience with God or had this. We're we're looking for something far greater than that. We're we're looking for that position that God has anointed you to become. He He He has a mind and he has a purpose for every life sitting here. AND HE SENT THAT HOLY GHOST TO transform you from whatever you were to what you're GOING TO BE. AMEN. LISTEN, GOD IS WORKING ON THE church of the living God. AND HE SENT THE HOLY GHOST TO DO IT. SO I DON'T believe in just man-made, Amen. pumping into the church. You need to be this. So you know, you get real hard on the people. So they start navigating that way. That's not it. It's got to be a birth. AND OUT OF THAT birth comes reality. I I I I need character. I need love. I need patience. I NEED I NEED something to help me deal with this temper. I I NEED SOMETHING, GOD. WELL, THAT AIN'T coming from the outside. No more than a than a oak tree is reaching to the outside for a leaf. It brings the leaf from within it through the life that's on the inside. And every believer sitting here, Amen. The very moment you receive the Holy Ghost, you receive something that will take you from the birth all the way to the changing of your body, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A DIFFERENT LIFE. There will not be two comingings of THE SPIRIT, BUT THERE will be a maturing of the spirit that you have and it will come to the place that ONE OF THESE DAYS THAT YOU CAN GET SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY UNTIL DEITY CAN SPEAK through you and deity can use your HANDS AND YOUR EYES AND YOUR LEGS. YOUR CALLING IS NOT A CHURCH. YOUR CALLING IS TO BE A MATE TO JESUS CHRIST AND A SHARING OF EVERY OF EVERY EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD HAS MADE TO THIS GENERATION. Don't you set your aspects or your anticipations or your ambitions way down low. &gt;&gt; You were called for a higher calling than that. &gt;&gt; And and I'll say that I was just listening to hearing him and brother Bam, it really struck my heart the way he says this. He said, "Listen, what's the matter today is we adopted a different tutor for the church." He said, "Than what God gave us." &gt;&gt; He looked out the best tutor he could find. And his tutor wasn't a bishop or some pope, but it was the Holy Spirit that was given as a tutor to the church to raise it. And you're aware of that. &gt;&gt; And he said the Holy Spirit is to raise the church and to nurture it in honor and respect of the father and of his word. Now the the the the Holy Spirit is nurturing the church to honor his word. &gt;&gt; Do do you see that? There's there's something that makes a person honor. If you have to make somebody do the word, then they they need something in them that makes them honor the word. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? That's something just from your heart. It's a willingly it's a willing I remember how brother man prayed it. He said, "Father, give me a will to do thy will." Amen. You You need a will to do the will of God. See, and and then brother Bam says it. See, he said, "But but you see what a son of God has got now, but we've adopted men with theology and some of their man-made creeds, and you see where it's got us to." Now, he's talking to the Pentecostal world, and he's telling them, "Look, look, you've adopted bishops, and you've adopted theology, and you've let other men tell you, amen, what the church ought to be like and how it ought to be." He said, "But see God sent the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Now, now, Brother Brandon was showing them that the true sign of the Holy Ghost. Now, that's why there was such a big argument over whether tongues was the evidence or the word was the evidence. See, because brother Bannon was trying to show them if you truly have the Holy Ghost. The only real evidence of that is that you would receive the message of your age. So you would HAVE AN OPEN HEART FOR THAT MESSAGE to come because we found out the message wasn't William Brandom. It wasn't just the seven church age messenger but rather it was the coming of the Messiah. The anointed word was coming to the church and we were going to OPEN UP OUR HEARTS JUST LIKE IN HEAVEN when Jesus headed into the gates and he said lift up oh you gates of everlasting life and let the king of glory come in. They shouted back and said who is the king of glory? And he said he's the one mighty in the battle. AMEN. YOU YOU SEE AND AND THAT SPIRIT HAVE OF God has come into the church today as the great Messiah. AND YOU CAN HEAR THE VOICE. BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR NOW. LIFT UP, OH YE GATES of everlasting life. Let the Messiah come into that heart in rulership. &gt;&gt; See, in every area of life. Now, now you you say, "Preacher, uh, what are you really getting now?" I want you to see that it matters what your ambition is of what you're going to settle for. &gt;&gt; Now, if it's just your ambition to be a member of a church, then you're going to settle pretty much for any kind of preaching. &gt;&gt; If you if you just want to be a general church or just a normal church or just a carnal church, and I say normal church because brother Bam said that's the foolish virgin, right? He said they're just a normal church. He said one without the oil. &gt;&gt; But you see, it's a carnal it's a carnal church. And if that's the ambition, then there won't be there won't be any altar calls. &gt;&gt; There won't be no dying out. You won't have no prayer. You you won't have any any times of repentance and it'll all just be cushy and sugary sermons and kind of like throwing leaves on a fire. It'll be a it'll be a flame, but the fire won't last the night. &gt;&gt; Do you see? Amen. It's according what you want. You just want to hoodoo and have a big time and and and leave the same as you came. Now, if that's the case, it really doesn't matter what kind of sermon or what kind of teaching or what kind of word you sit under. But if your ambition is to be a true son, &gt;&gt; if your ambition is to be that bride of Christ, THEN GOD SENT a message to take you to that place. &gt;&gt; THEN PEOPLE ASKED ME, "BROTHER M, WHY ARE YOU SO set on on just uh preaching things brother Brandham said and and bringing the quotes and and settling the church by those things? WHY ARE YOU so set on those things? Because I know that if it's our goal to be the bride, there's only one ministry going to put the bride in her place. There isn't another ministry that's going to be able to lead this bride into the mind of God. Cuz that's where your bride in his mind &gt;&gt; and it'll take the mind of God. Now, Brother Bam says, "See, there's rules of life." And and he said, "If you cheat in the rules of life, you get disqualified." &gt;&gt; And he speaks of natural life. He says, "See, you you can get he he takes I think a beautiful thing is he takes a how that Hitler won victories and Napoleon won victories." He said, "But those victories were short-lived." &gt;&gt; He said, "Because they didn't follow the rules to get the victories they had." &gt;&gt; And he said, "And life is the same way." &gt;&gt; See, if you're taking a shortcut to your victory, &gt;&gt; then a victory won't last you. That's why that you you you can't JUST YOU YOU CAN'T just let it all go over the top all the time. See, we can teach over every issue and every problem until we can maintain a certain level. But if we're going to get higher, we've got to reach down in that heart and deal with an individual situations of our lives because we want victory to last more than the service. We want it to last more than me. What What if the church was dispersed tomorrow? We'd like to see a victory in you today that would last you until you stepped in the portals of glory. IF YOU COULD NEVER STEP foot in another church, I pray to God there's something in you that'll put you in glory. Because I'll be honest, I love to see the pews full, but that is not the ambition of Wayne Lawson. We My ambition is not to fill up this church. My ambition is to fill up heaven. I want to see people in heaven. Amen. I think of brother Brandham when he said he said I'd rather not have any children at all. It's a bunch of illegitimate children. People that can't take the word or that can't take the things of God. I pray GOD GIVE US THE HEART TO PREACH TRUTH TO THE PLACE THAT it is liberating. NOT NOT JUST STIFLING, NOT NOT A BONDAGE, BUT A TRUTH that is liberating that that'll give you grace and give you strength over the situations of your life. if you got to play it according to the word of God if you're going to keep a victory. There's so many people that doesn't seem to even have any kind of purpose in life. Now, I'm going to follow just a channel brother Brandon makes here. If you you see I it matters what you're doing to the rules you're going to play by. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and here brother Brandham is saying, "But it seems like somebody so many people don't have purpose." Now, we're seeing that in the age we're living in since uh 2020. They called it the great resignation. Uh, United States of America resigned. &gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands of workers never went back to work. &gt;&gt; They resigned. They lost purpose. &gt;&gt; They lost hopes. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's called the great resignation. That's the millennial age that we're living in. Uh people are not uh pressing forward for higher life. They're not looking for it. You know, you got young people don't don't even know what they want to do with their life yet. &gt;&gt; There's no there's no ambition. So So there's no way to start preparatory. There's no way to prepare yourself because you you you can't come to a decision. A lot of times you you can find scriptural truths. A doubleminded man is unstable in his ways. &gt;&gt; You you you can't serve God and mammon at the same time. You have to make up your mind what you want to do and then follow the path that gets you there. If you want to be a medical doctor, amen, there's certain there's a certain path to take and you can start that path early. If you want to be an engineer, you better be heavy in math. If you, you know, if you want to be in biology, you better take the sciences. You You see, in natural life, there is things that prepare you for the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we recognize this and I I'll say this and and and coming back because our ambitions naturally probably are a little different than the rest of the world naturally because we have and I don't I don't want to put one of our young ladies under conviction because some of our young ladies their great ambition in life is to be a wife and mother which I certainly believe is the highest calling there is to a to a life according to brother Brandham. Amen. Do you see then the the ambition? Amen. See and then you say you get in school. Let's just talk to the young people just a moment. You get in school and then you you get around people that have and maybe they don't have any spiritual ambition and they they watch television and and they got all kinds of characters and it's it's they do all kinds of things. Even as young girls, they start acting certain ways, doing certain ways and then our young girls are around them and and our boys are around them. Then they start trying to drift toward whatever that influence is in that school. And you watch it in work. You watch maybe an influential person in in the work and someone not real committed to the Lord and they be at work and next thing you know they're taking on characters or habits and and they're starting to follow along that line. And brother says, "See, but there it is." He says, "Now, we got to have an ambition higher than just uh uh maybe a raise in our salary or our new job." See, you need you need ambitions. Amen. I I'm going to say this very openly. Young men, you need a job. [Applause] My Bible says that if a man won't provide for his family, he's worse than an infidel. &gt;&gt; Now, don't come to me being lazy and then think that we're going to pet that devil. It is a devil. And it's easy to be lazy and find an excuse not to work. But if you want to work, Amen. There is jobs and there's ways to work. AMEN. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO do somewhere. Amen. But you see, well, if if you want to be a little lazy, you can find a way to be lazy. I I hate a lazy spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what's wrong with you?" I tell you what's wrong with you. We're living in Leodysa, and Leosa is teaching our young men not to raise up and be men. &gt;&gt; I found I found out something yesterday. I thought, man, I need to preach a whole sermon on it. I heard my wife talking to her mom on the phone. They talking about she got a bunch of new chickens and they trying to wait to develop see see if they got a rooster among them because a bunch of little chicks you know and and and I heard them talking and Chris said well the rooster ought to be developing by now but but if he ain't said one of those one of those hens will start acting like a rooster. I said no way. I mean I I'm easedropping. No way. SHE SAID YEAH. SHE SAID YEAH COURTNEY HAD ONE. And I said really? She said yeah. Is that TRUE COURTNEY? AMEN. SHE had a they they had a a group of chickens and there was no rooster and one of the hens started getting a bigger comb, started scratching, growing bigger spears, trying I mean literally started to transition into a leadership role in because there was no MALE THERE. AND SOME OF THESE men wonder WHY THEIR WIVES ARE SO AGGRESSIVE and dominant in their homes. IT'S BECAUSE YOU NEVER STOOD UP AND BEEN A MAN YET. YOU WANT A YOU WANT a You want a YOU WANT A GOOD, SOLID, SUBTLE WIFE, BE A MAN. &gt;&gt; You can't set up all night and play video games and and her respect you. Come on. She married a man, not some little boy. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm too tired to go to work. Well, put your phone down, turn the internet off, AND BE A MAN AND RAISE YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; WELL, I've got to watch Fox News, YOU KNOW. WE MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND DO IT, HAVEN'T WE? THAT'S A CURSE out of hell. It ain't nothing but 24 hours of negative and bad news and and people get so ANXIOUS AND SO FEARFUL AND HALF THE TIME WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ON THERE SO POLITICAL IT'S SUCH a lie. And instead of listening to the word of God instead of prayer, INSTEAD OF THE BIBLE, YOU FILLED YOUR LIFE WITH FOX NEWS AND CNN NEWS AND TNT AND ENTERTAINMENTS. AMEN. YOU CANNOT KEEP A VICTORY WITH THOSE RULES. YOU SAY, "WELL, PREACHER, YOU'RE JUST BEING A LEGALIST." I'M NOT BEING a legalist. Amen. It ain't got nothing to do with legalism. IT'S IT'S YOUR AMBITION. WHAT IS YOUR AMBITION? [Music] &gt;&gt; What's your ambition in this life? I TELL YOU MY AMBITION. I DID NOT MOVE TO OHIO. AMEN. TO PLAY CHURCH. AMEN. I CAME HERE UNDER THE WILL OF GOD. AMEN. AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD IN THIS PLACE. AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THE HOLY GHOST TO LEAD them into this generation. I'm I'm not just fussing. I I've been listening to a prophet. And he said it real clear. He said, "You women," he said, "I could have played you the tape." He said, "You're listening to another voice. That's why you're cutting your hair." &gt;&gt; I can read 1 Corinthians 11 and the Bible said a woman don't even have a right to pray when she cuts her hair. &gt;&gt; One prayer is the prayer of repentance. That's all she's got. Brother Brandon said, "When you wear them skin tight clothes, &gt;&gt; even if it is a dress, &gt;&gt; and you get all sensual and you're putting yourself out in front of men like that." Now, Brother Brandon said, "You're committing adultery with every sinner that looks at you &gt;&gt; and you say, "I ain't touched the man." Brother Bam said, "But on the day of judgment, when God judges that sinner for looking at you like that, you'll stand right there with him as an adulteress." &gt;&gt; Man, that's tough preaching, ain't it? It's according what your ambition is. &gt;&gt; If your ambition is to be a leodyian sex queen, oh, you hate me right now for that. But if you're looking to be a daughter of God and to come into the presence of God, you love me for preaching like that. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT WE NEED IS THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST TO CUT THE BONDAGE OFF AND TO TAKE THE PRESSURE AWAY THAT CHILDREN CAN LIVE FREE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. GOD NEVER CALLED YOU to be a makeup artist for some Maybelline. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brown say one time, "Beauty was a curse." And I didn't know what he meant until later I realized some girls are too pretty just to be common. &gt;&gt; They just cannot humble themselves to just be common. They got to put that stuff on them. &gt;&gt; They got to juice that up. Let me tell you something. Amen. I heard the prophet say this very clearly. Man, it's so strong. He said, "Lady, if you're wearing makeup, there ain't but one woman in the Bible that wore makeup, &gt;&gt; and her was Jezebel, and God called her dog meat." &gt;&gt; That's a That's a That's a prophet. &gt;&gt; A prophet of God. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, "YOU never put that on to meet God. You put it on to meet a man." And he said, "If you if you believe me to be a prophet," he said, "Before you go in the presence of God, you better wash that off of your face." &gt;&gt; That's rough, ain't it? &gt;&gt; And you know what? He fog was behind that. And way he says it, it just struck me so strong. He said, "And you men &gt;&gt; that would let her do it." &gt;&gt; And I thought, there it is. Really? &gt;&gt; There it is. There's something in that man that wants his wife to look that way or she wouldn't do that. There's something in that man that wants her a little toward the world because he's just a little ashamed of that gospel look. LET ME TELL YOU, I'M NOT ASHAMED of the gospel look. Amen. I MARRIED A CHRISTIAN. I WANT A CHRISTIAN. I DESIRED A CHRISTIAN. AND PRAISE GOD THAT THERE'S SOME CHRISTIAN WOMEN that have kept their morals in this generation. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to pet Amen. I know how it is. LET'S PET THE CAT. WELL, LET'S PET IT THE OTHER WAY AND SEE WHICH IS NATURE IS ON SOMEBODY. IT'S ALL ONE WAY, BUT AMEN. PET IT THE OTHER WAY AND FIND OUT. AMEN. CAN IT TAKE THE WORD OF GOD? Is it really the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Higher ambitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see what it is? Amen. You got to set your affection on a higher ambition. Amen. Brother man says it very clearly. He would have a purpose of us coming here. What? The God that sent you here has a purpose for you being here. You didn't just come to this earth to be here. God put you here. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD PUT YOU HERE, THERE'S A PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; He had a purpose for the tree. Had a purpose for the animals. He had A PURPOSE FOR EVERYTHING. HOW MUCH greater for his sons and daughters of God. SOMEBODY SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY PURPOSE IS." WELL, let me hit it one more time. Get off of your television. &gt;&gt; Get off of your YouTube. &gt;&gt; Get off of the internet. Get in prayer. AND ASK THE GOD THAT sent you here what it is he sent you here for. &gt;&gt; Why do y'all think the devil's so busy on that, guys? He's wanting to cut your communication with the Lord so you'll live you'll live in a way that you're no challenge to the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan is begging you, begging you to stay your mind engrossed into the issues and the modern problems because he DON'T WANT YOU TO he don't want YOU TO SEE &gt;&gt; THE CAPABILITIES AND AND THE CHALLENGE. I KNOW YOU'RE USED TO being informed. Well, the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, "Don't inform them. Confront them. &gt;&gt; Don't inform me this morning. Confront me. That's what I want." This is a house of judgment. &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT BEGINS AT THE HOUSE OF GOD. THAT'S the word of God. I you know I'm preaching &gt;&gt; and you you see what it is. How how do we we we'll never we'll never keep victory by keeping fashions of the world. &gt;&gt; And sometimes people losing victory. It's almost like they want to blame the church. &gt;&gt; Somebody having a ton of marriage trouble and they trying to find a way to fix it and you can't even get them to come church on a midweek. &gt;&gt; You you you can't get them to sit down and read the Bible or pray. &gt;&gt; Come on. And you wonder why there's so much trouble. &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing wrong with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing wrong with the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, &gt;&gt; you you see, you're keeping up with the fashions of the world. Now, watch Brother Brandham say it. You You'll never keep victory that way. &gt;&gt; But faith is a victory that overcomes the world. You see now now where this really gathers up is where brother Bam says that he said he had a traveler come to his house and he said a young man come and he was up in the age and he come knocked on the door and he comes in he says he brother Bram said I'm going to give him a sandwich he said I got to talk to him I said young man he said where you from he said oh nowhere &gt;&gt; he said where you going he said nowhere &gt;&gt; man said what what do you mean he said well just wherever I hang my hat that's where it's that &gt;&gt; he said, "How long you been doing this?" He said, "20 years." &gt;&gt; 20 years floating. &gt;&gt; 20 years in the same floating situation, &gt;&gt; no home, &gt;&gt; no life, no stability. 20 years. &gt;&gt; Do you see brother Ramis trying to tell the church something? &gt;&gt; Pentecost, you were born 40 years ago. How old are you? And how long will you just float? &gt;&gt; Do you see? He's talking to the Pentecostal world. The spirit's moving among them, but he keeps telling them, you got to get grounded on the solid rock &gt;&gt; of the word of God because we're building. We're building something. And brother Bam says, see, that's the attitude of the people. He said, like a floating driftwood. Amen. Now, I I just want to take a moment and go back to my roots back to Black Rock and Black River uh back in uh Arkansas, I I grew up on a river, and one thing that you see is during floods and things like that, you know, but then when the river settles down that a river has a bunch of bins in it, you know, and and and we like to catfish a lot. Well, a lot of times if you find where them where them log jams are, that's where them they'll dig a big big hole at one end of the other. And a lot of times that's where you find your your good catfishing and stuff. It's right in behind in big log jams. But you know what causes those log jams is? It's drifting wood. &gt;&gt; And what it is, as long as the river's straight, a big old tree can fall. As long as the river's straight, it it'll just drift right along in the river. But when a turn comes, &gt;&gt; it'll hang up in that turn &gt;&gt; because there see there's other trash there in the corners. And what it does is it hangs up in the trash piles on the corners. Now, if you're just drifting along in life's journey, see, there's a play. You're going to get hung up. &gt;&gt; You're just going to get hung somewhere. &gt;&gt; You're going to get hung up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you're going to you're going to hit one of those bins and something's going to be You just can't overcome that. &gt;&gt; It's just going to be too much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're going to have a a falling out with a church or you're going to have a falling out in the home or something's going to happen. going to be a blow up and then you're going to get hung up right there. Now, I wished it wasn't true, but I have seen many I have seen many people that never got past certain points of their life. &gt;&gt; But, Brother Bam says, "But if you'll notice this," he'll say, "You you you you people that run these rivers, and I've did it a lot, and and he says, "You do it in a boat." Now, he he was talking about a wood boat. He said, "But a wood boat could be made out of the same material that that floating log's made out of." He said, 'But the difference between the two is the log has been in the hand of the master. And he said that log was shaped, he said, to be able to cut the current and then the master will put a power motor on the back of it. And then when it comes up to them points, there's some power to push them out of it. &gt;&gt; See, if you if you don't have something to push you along, then you get caught up in those places along life's journey. You you all been there. you know, we could just start on this side of the room and just move across and there's been a log jam that tried to hang you. You know, every every person sitting here there you you've hit the log jam, but there was something that guided you out of it and and moved you on a life life's journey. And and brother Bam says, "See what it is." He says, "You'll either meet God as a masterpiece that he's worked on or a floating driftwood." See, but if you purpose something in your heart, God will bring a reality to that purpose. I purpose to be a son of God. I purpose in my heart to do the things of God. Now, amen. I believe that you can get victory over everything that it's according to the very inspiration or the ambition of your life. I believe there's ambition. Now, ambition is a strong desire to achieve something. Typically, it'll require determination and hard work. Let me give you a few words. Aspiration, intention, goal, aim, objective, object, purpose, intent, plan, scheme, mission, calling, vocation, desire, wish, design, target, end, dream, hope. In other words, something out in front of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and if you notice in John chapter 1 and verse 12, it said here, "But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become sons." &gt;&gt; Now watch this power to become. It actually means in the Greek it means to emerge or transition from one point to another. Fundamentally become. So it's not an exact equivalent to the verb to be, but it but it actually means to become to to change a condition, a state, or a place. It means to come into manifestation, movement, or motion, emerging in growth. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW WATCH, BROTHER says it in Galatians 4. He said, "Look, you're an heir, but as long as you're a child, you differ nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, but he's under tutors and governs until a time appointed. So you can be a Holy Ghost-filled Christian, but until you start growth, you differ nothing from a servant because YOU'RE NOT FINDING YOUR AUTHORITY or your ambition, amen, to learn the things that God has designed for this age. I believe THE BIBLE SAID THAT we've been predestinated unto adoption. I am not reaching for something that don't belong to me. You see, my expectation and ambition happens to be a promise that God made to the church THAT WE COULD POSSESS A DIVINE NATURE. AMEN. IT'S THE PROMISE OF GOD, a divine nature, an adoption of sons, that we could have this. Now, what does ambition mean? It's a quality or a motive of an individual that drives actions towards a particular goal. if it can help a person push themselves to engage in hard work to tasks that reap specific rewards. A driving ambition can be a powerful motivator for achieving success. Amen. We we can characterize ambition. It's the difference between healthy and potentially unhealthy levels of trait strategies and balancing in your life. So without ambition in your life, you're going to be an unbalanced person. Ambition is something that it's Latin and it actually means a strong desire to achieve a perfect end or a particular end. It also refers to an adherent desire. Amen. It means that there is a ambition is what helps you prioritize your actions. &gt;&gt; It's what helps you make a decision. Do I do this or I don't do this? &gt;&gt; You're sitting in front of that big piece of cake and you want to lose 10. &gt;&gt; Do I do it? Do I don't do I do it? Don't I? &gt;&gt; It's not law. You can eat it if you want it, &gt;&gt; but if it's your ambition to lose 10, don't eat it. &gt;&gt; But if you do eat it, don't give up on your goal. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; If it's your ambition to be a son and you going and EAT THE CAKE, DON'T GIVE UP ON your goal. &gt;&gt; SET YOUR HIGH SET YOUR CALLING HIGHER than one meal. SUCH A HIGHER CALLING THAN ONE SIN OR ONE MISTAKE OR ONE BAD DAY OR ONE BAD FIGHT. OUR CALLING IS HIGHER THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING FURTHER THAN ONE MEAL, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; You see, it's a sense of purpose, a resilience. Ambition can strengthen your beliefs and give you energy to persist to persist through obstacles when you challenge yourself and push past your comfort zones. Now, there's two different kinds of churches, and you got to be careful to not drift with the carnal because the carnal church, it seems, it seems spiritual, but it's a carnal church. And brother Bram says they're drifting back to mama church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, there's there drifting. So, don't drift with them. Just cuz somebody goes a certain way, that don't mean we go that way. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing what I'm saying? Don't get online and watch another church and then want this church to drift toward that church. &gt;&gt; You see, our calling is higher than being like another church. &gt;&gt; WE WE HAVE SET OUR CALLING ON being like Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be something if you go over and have supper with a family and you get back home, you tell Cheyenne, "I want you to be like that woman. [Music] I'm available for counsel if you need me. That wouldn't be no different than me going visiting some church and coming back here and want this church like that church. &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I I think that's a very carnal way to view things. &gt;&gt; We are a very unique church, &gt;&gt; but it's a Holy Ghostled church. and leave us alone in our oddness. WE ACTUALLY ENJOY IT. &gt;&gt; WE ACTUALLY ENJOY JUST BEING ABLE TO STAND UP AND holler amen. AND IT'S NOT SO formal that that that YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY CAN WEAR BLUE JEANS. IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH US. If you want to wear blue jeans, just just keep it keep it modest. &gt;&gt; Men, &gt;&gt; they're starting to act like organizations. We are not an organization &gt;&gt; and we're not drifting towards organization. &gt;&gt; So if you see a resistance from your pastor against organization, it's we are not drifting that way because it's a very short victory. &gt;&gt; You can have good services for a short time. You can enjoy great fellowship for a short time, but if you don't stay on the word, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; You see, they begin drifting. NOW, BROTHER BADAM TALKS ABOUT A soul that's unsaved. And he says they're drifting on life. And he says they're drifting towards, he said, without a pilot to guide them. &gt;&gt; It almost breaks my heart to hear him say it. &gt;&gt; If you ever heard the tape, he said floating him with the tides to hear the roar of them great cataracts. those falls. What a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting, &gt;&gt; coming up to the end of your life and you've been drifting without any guidance. Amen. Away from the falls. Amen. You got to come to an end. If you're here this morning and you don't know Jesus Christ, let me address you just a moment. You're drifting in your life and and you think a job is your achievement or a family is your achievement. But if you don't know Jesus Christ, you ain't achieved anything because this life is very short and all flesh is grass and your breath is just spit for a moment. You only hold the breath. You only are promised the breath you're holding in your mouth right now. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother, I don't know if I'm ready to follow the Lord Jesus." Well, let me say this. An indecision is a decision. A DECISION TO NOT follow Jesus. Amen. I won't make a commitment. Is the same as saying, "I won't follow you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Drifting and you're going to come to an end and you're going to go TO A DEVIL'S HELL and a sinner's grave. AND IT'S THE SADDEST STORY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GO through every roadblock. You're going to go through the cross of Calvary, THROUGH THE BLOOD OF CHRIST, through the prophets, THROUGH THE AGONY OF THE CHURCH, FROM THE SWEATING OF THE MINISTRIES, from the lives that were given to prevent YOU FROM GOING THAT WAY. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY TO HELL. &gt;&gt; And it's a sad day when men end up in hell when they don't have to. &gt;&gt; God is not willing that any man would perish, but that every man would come unto everlasting life. THERE IS A GOD HERE THIS MORNING. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TURN YOUR LIFE TO HIM, HE CAN SAVE YOU. AND WHILE I'M PREACHING, HE CAN SAVE YOU RIGHT NOW. ALL YOU GOT TO SAY IS, "LORD, I NEED A SAVIOR." You said, "Brother Wayne, that ain't very encouraging." Well, let me just say I I I I heard a story one time about a about a guy that was out in a boat in the middle of the ocean and he had a boat wreck and hit his head and broke his arm and it flipped him out in the middle OF THE OCEAN, PACIFIC OCEAN, and the sharks was swimming and he was bleeding and Coast Guard seen the the the distress calls and they come flying OVER WITH A HELICOPTER AND THEY'RE HOVERING over the guy. Well, let me ask you, DOES THE GUY NEED ENCOURAGING OR does he need saving? &gt;&gt; And sometimes people don't need encourage that. What they really need is an experience with God. THEY NEED TO GET THEIR SOUL RIGHT WITH GOD. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE TOLD THEY'RE SAVED when they're not saved. THEY NEED TO GET AN OLDFASHIONED EXPERIENCE THAT'LL MAKE THEM FALL IN LOVE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. LISTEN, YOU CAN'T PET THAT DEVIL. IT'LL TAKE THE SOUL TO HELL. &gt;&gt; It's not legalism, folks. It's only the acceptance of faith by the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST that can save a man. You can't offer God good works &gt;&gt; drifting over that cataract yonder. Wouldn't it be a sad thing for a man to drift out of this life into the cataracts of hell when he was offered a way out? &gt;&gt; But you know, in reading that, I got to thinking about drifting. Now, there's two ways to drift. There's there's this man I'm talking about that don't know the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then let's talk about brother Brandham in the middle of the floods back in 33. &gt;&gt; He was drifting with a motor. &gt;&gt; But he was drifting that he he had disobeyed the Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember that? &gt;&gt; And he was he had a motor ON THAT BOAT. HE WASN'T HE wasn't lost, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There was a MOTOR RIGHT THERE. HE WAS IN A WELLCRAFTED UH FINE THING. He wasn't just floating on a log. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS EVEN A MASTER BOATER. HE HE HE RUN A BOAT from a KID UP, BUT HIS motor wasn't working. See, he was drifting a different way. And and and watch this, HOW HOW THAT THINGS come up in life as Christians, AS CHRISTIANS THAT SOMETIMES WE DISOBEY the Lord. WE GET OURSELVES IN WRONG SITUATIONS or troubles or even if it's not disobedience, sometimes it's great disappointments. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm preaching to you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes things don't work out like you wanted them to. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU FIGHT REAL hard for a certain direction and then all of a sudden everything you were fighting for was took away from you and it goes another direction. &gt;&gt; See, and what happens is if you're not careful, you'll resign. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You'll pull back in your spirit and you'll hide &gt;&gt; and you'll just start drifting along. Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; Not making any headway, &gt;&gt; not not going anywhere, not doing anything. Just drifting, &gt;&gt; just drifting along. But look, you you see the them falls are just down the road down there. THERE'S COMING THERE'S COMING A PLACE. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THAT motor running. &gt;&gt; If you're a daddy, don't drift long because your family's going to depend on you having a motor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz your family will come into something you're going to need to pull them out of. I'm telling you, YOU GOT TO, BROTHERS, YOU got to lead your homes. &gt;&gt; You can't just YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT your wife to pull you to church and pull you to prayer and pull you. We need leaders. &gt;&gt; I I'm not fussing. We need leaders. &gt;&gt; You say, "My children are young. They won't be there long." &gt;&gt; We need leaders. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE FINALLY REPENTED TO the Lord. He said, "Lord, I know where I made mistake." He called them holy rollers trash. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, they're just a bunch of shouting holy rollers down there. You better be careful." &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Lord, I didn't even say it. My mother-in-law did." &gt;&gt; Remember? Well, I'd hate to been his mother-in-law. Poor mother-in-laws. Sister Dee, I called her a cow one time. I got to talk about marriage. You know, Brother Bram said, "If you want to marry a calf," he said, "Look right at the cow." And I was dumb enough to say she's a good cow. [Music] Dee was an exc is is an excellent mother and an excellent wife, an excellent homemaker, an excellent character. You know, that's that's when I when uh when Zach come uh uh come home one day had this red-headed girl on his mind. I didn't know her from anybody. He comes home said, "Dad, I met her." I said, "Who's that son?" My wife. &gt;&gt; You talk to her? Well, a little. It's about the way it went. And he says, he says, "Uh, you you you okay with it?" And I said, "Son, I ain't marrying her. You are. [Music] I mean, I'd like to like her, but you're the one living with her." So, he said, "Well, I want her parents to meet y'all." So, they come down at the house and Brother Mike, Sister Don, I'd never met him before., you know, they come to the church once or twice and I had seen them, but I never met them. They come to the house and we sit around there a few minutes and sister Don got to talking and she got to talking a little bit and I got to hearing biblical principles of womenhood and biblical principle was this and this and I got to hearing some real strong real strong moral uh background and biblical principle of what the the roles of wife and mother and what the world's doing to and I'm just listening and the Lord is just pouring out and the time I got done visiting with him about an hour I said son that that young lady will make you a good wife cuz she's been raised by somebody that gave her the right ambitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do do you see THEN THERE THERE'S GOT TO BE sometimes amen other people even in your life saying things about the the moving of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me just let me just say this real clearly. &gt;&gt; Be very careful when you go speaking about someone rejoicing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or dancing. or moving in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, be real careful about it. And the reason I'm saying that to you is cuz Brother Bam said, "If you're planning, if your ambition is to go to heaven," he said, "you better range some of the language of heaven." &gt;&gt; And he said, "That language over there is hallelujah and praise God." &gt;&gt; He said, "If it it's he said a little bit of shouting going over there." So, what it is is, see, you don't want to keep fading out that way. Crank the engine and quit that drift and pull back. Brother says it very clearly. I seen down there in hot springs that that group was headed towards organization. So I preached once more Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother man Brandon WAS SAYING THAT THAT THEY HAD BEEN BUT THEY WAS DRIFTING AWAY. HOW MANY STORIES is that like that today? People that were so fervent for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where some situation came and and they just begin to relax. Now let me let me just say the Ephesent church age. Brother Bram says it. He said they aimed at and relaxed. They had high aspirations of the age and begun to the fullness of the spirit, the depth of God. And they were aiming at the high calling and begin to give way to a less watchful attitude, &gt;&gt; a less adherent following of Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages a physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of Satan. It had become relaxed and it was drifting. Now, Brother Ray preaches here a lot, and I preach here a lot on spiritual rest, &gt;&gt; but don't relax, [Music] &gt;&gt; don't don't get to the place where there's no strength in you. &gt;&gt; Well, it's all over. I mean, you know, no, no. Keep the ambition. &gt;&gt; Keep the ambition. Don't don't just relax to the place where you resigned. &gt;&gt; Do you see? Because when they become relaxed, they're drifting. Now, what's the first thing you drift away from? Is the supernatural. &gt;&gt; It becomes a carnal intellectual affair. When the pillar of fire is absent, then you just resort to reading. &gt;&gt; I know that's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; He said, "And because there was the absence of the pillar of fire, they invited the most intellectual men they could get to fulfill and substitute the absence of the supernatural." &gt;&gt; Right? So when you begin to drift the the the the idea of miracles, the ideas of the power of God, you begin to drift away from it. And brother Bram says they began backsliding. They had left their first love. See, they had drifted and left their first love. Now I don't want to take a long time in that, but I would say this to you. Brother Bham says it in Revelations 2 and5. He said, "Remember which thou art fallen." What? Remember what you drifted away from. Look. And he says, "Now go back and do thy first works." Now watch. He said, "Now remember, evidently something had left their mind. They had forgotten." He told them to turn back in their minds at the point of origin. And that was the first age of Pentecost. They had fallen from that. They had forgotten the glory and the wonder of it. Isn't that something? It was time to go back in mind and then in reality back for them to say, "For me to live as Christ." Brother M says, "Go back there in YOUR MIND." SEE, HE SAID, and if you want to go on with it, brother Bam actually said, go back to the place. He said, you remember when things happened in the church and you didn't sit and talk about them, you prayed about them. &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to rehearse. He said, remember when things would come up and you would go and forgive people and and you didn't want to go to sleep and having said something bad about somebody or owing somebody or not paying somebody or some kind of bad business deal. You know, you know that. Listen, folks. Amen. I believe a Christian is a Christian whether they're in the pullpit, the church, or the outdoors. &gt;&gt; And if you do a business deal with somebody that don't come out right, that person shouldn't have to take you to court to make you pay that bill. &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. I mean, y'all may not want me as a pastor, but I'm going to tell you this. I don't believe in this bunch of half-hearted Christian experience life where you where you buy things and don't pay for them or you do things and and you don't finish them or you take a job and you say I'll do this and then you don't do this and then you take the money for it. &gt;&gt; And you never give the money back. You never go back and fix it. You never do it. Amen. It ain't Christian. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; it's the truth anyhow. &gt;&gt; I remember when men kept their word. I remember when you could just shake a man's hand and that's all you had to do. &gt;&gt; There's still some men like that, by the way. &gt;&gt; But when you fall away from that, that's you got to remember that's Christianity. &gt;&gt; It's not just church. &gt;&gt; It's alive. &gt;&gt; LOOK, YOU GOT TO GO back in your mind, then go back in reality. Now, I I certainly believe Brother Bam said he said there was a bunch of them out there on the on this on the on the ocean. He said they were drifting around. The fog came in. He said they got to getting scared and they got to want the old captain to do something. You move the boat right now. Brother Bam said that old captain been in that shape before. He said, "Hang on, boys." He said, "Just sit real still for a moment." He said, "And the great sun will come up in a minute and then we'll know our direction." &gt;&gt; Now, see, the church was setting in that kind of place in Pentecost. It had begun to move into confusion. But here come a prophet with a vindicated word and that would be the direction of OUR CHURCH. THAT THAT SON CAME UP AND NOW every captain on the on the on the church of the living God ought to know direction. Now direction is not one service. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's say that real clearly. Direction is not one service. You you you don't choose the church's direction by one good meeting, one bad meeting. &gt;&gt; One good sermon, one bad sermon. one good song, one bad song. You know, maybe somebody sang song you don't like. I think once it happens, you know, somebody will sang a song, somebody else don't like that song. But that don't mean it's the direction of Brother Ben's song service. Right. &gt;&gt; So, you can't you you can't label the direction of a song service because you heard one song you thought was too rocky or maybe it's too contemporary or &gt;&gt; See, you can't you can't call our direction that direction cuz it's not that direction. &gt;&gt; It's one song. &gt;&gt; I thought I'd get more backing than that. &gt;&gt; Let me preach to you young people. YOU CAN'T SAY WE'RE a bunch of old fogies just cuz we preach old rugged cross. If we sing uh Amazing Grace, you can't label us as a 1950s church off of one song. &gt;&gt; Hey y'all, is that better? You get the point? &gt;&gt; You can't take one song or one song service and label our song service as a certain way. &gt;&gt; I I'm going to say something very clearly. I think we got wonderful song service here. &gt;&gt; I think Ben DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB HERE. He sings old ones. He sings new ones. He sings fast ones. He sings slow ones. HE SINGS WHATEVER THE SPIRIT is leading HIM INTO. &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, GOD BLESS HIM. AND YOU YOU just keep letting him lead YOU CUZ OUR AMBITION IS NOT TO BE LIKE ANOTHER CHURCH. &gt;&gt; OUR AMBITION IS TO FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE POWER OF GOD AND DROP INTO A SERVICE AND A SONG SERVICE CAN BECOME A GLORY HOUSE. &gt;&gt; SHOUT THE VICTORY AND ENJOY THE PRESENCE OF GOD. WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF HUM DRUM. AMEN. HALFBAKED CHRISTIANS. WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, BORN TO THE HOLY GHOST, TONGUE TALKING. ACTS 2:38, CHILDREN OF THE living God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have a good shouting service. Somebody say, "Well, they're all Pentecostal." Well, hang on. Here comes the teaching service. &gt;&gt; Well, they preach on all they preach on is grace. Well, hang on. It's coming. &gt;&gt; See, because somebody else is leading, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The direction the direction is leadership. &gt;&gt; And and you watch this. I I I I say this something Brother Bram said made me made me just really He taught us how to get direction, right? How to how to get balance because that's what everybody wants is balance. &gt;&gt; And and I want balance. &gt;&gt; But you got to be careful because you may not be the right balance yourself. Now you may lean, right? &gt;&gt; And if you balance me by you, &gt;&gt; I guess the whole church will direction. Now, Brother Bam talks about riding the bike, right? He he says that that that boy wanted to win that swin bike, so he he rode it across there. And that one little boy, they didn't expect him to win. All these other guys, they fell off left and right and they got to the end and they they interviewed the little boy. They said, "Well, you surprising Lee with a guy who rode the whole who rode the beam. What was your secret?" He said, "Well, if you notice those other guys," he said they were looking down trying to balance. &gt;&gt; So, what they were doing was if they leaned a little this way, they was correcting. &gt;&gt; So, they started in a wobble. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, that's called reactive leadership. &gt;&gt; If the church has a little shouting meeting, then I come back and try to say, "We don't shout." &gt;&gt; And then they turn into Baptist. Then I got to come back and say, "Well, we're not Baptist." &gt;&gt; Then you see what you turn into a you turn into a wobbling &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; But direction is is when you set your ambition a little higher than one service &gt;&gt; and you look out toward the end and you go, "This is the path." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, the direction of this church is rapture. &gt;&gt; That's the direction. We're going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Shouting or not. &gt;&gt; HIGH, LOW, WHATEVER, WE'RE GOING IN THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT'S GOING TO GET US THERE IS THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GOING TO STAY RIGHT ON THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; SO, if something gets a little this way or something a LITTLE THIS WAY, HANG ON. YEAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; IT'LL IT'LL IT'LL PULL ITSELF IN THE CENTER. &gt;&gt; Because it's not in the intent to go a direction, &gt;&gt; you would have to intentionally change the direction of a church &gt;&gt; and it's not in our intent. See what you find then when you get into ambition, you you get into attitude. &gt;&gt; So your ambition will reflect your attitude will reflect your ambition. So, you know, people say ambitious and zealous are the same thing. They're actually not. &gt;&gt; Ambition deals with the goal, zeal deals with the attitude. &gt;&gt; So, you can be have an ambition but not have no zeal about that ambition. &gt;&gt; So, your attitude and your ambition moves right together. Uh, eagle stare at his nest. Brother Nathan gave me this. It's a powerful quote. I just love it. Brother Bam says God likened his church under the eagle because the eagle's nest which is the church is built far beyond the cares of the world and out of the danger lines cross the blood where the modern prowling predators never got to. You are a city that is set on a hill a candle that's lit in the room owe something. The church of the living God is built high on high ambitions. &gt;&gt; When I hear the church that hasn't got any ambition to grow, there's something wrong with that church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. The church of the living God has a high ambition. And another thing, the church of the living God is built because it's got high anticipations and expectations. Well, we belong to the church. Our father served in this church years ago. That might be fine. But the church of the living God can set still. Its ambitions is to go higher. &gt;&gt; See, we we have an ambition. It's a spiritual ambition is to go higher. Now, I I I think it's I think it's amazing when you start talking about stuff like this because you you just take a moment and you realize that the devil himself wants to go where you're going. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IN ISAIAH, IT SAYS IT VERY CLEARLY. IT SAYS THAT HE HAD A DESIRE TO GO SIT ON THE THRONE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT Satan's ambition to sit on the throne of God was to bring worship to HIMSELF AND GO HIGHER than God. But you have an ambition to go to the throne of God because you want to surrender to God and you WANT TO SERVE GOD. SEE, YOU YOU YOU IT'S AMAZING. IT'S AMAZING. I I I I I don't maybe I hope I don't get too loose in saying this, but I just got thinking about this. You know, you you you take a maybe a a woman that wants a certain man for husband, and she gets an ambition. I want this man for her husband. Well, if he's already got a wife, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That could be a problem. &gt;&gt; So, you're you do you see then your ambition needs it needs a a reality behind it. &gt;&gt; You know, you you you you need that to have a HAVE A GOAL. AND OUR our expectations, our ambitions, our desires happened to be promises God made us. &gt;&gt; And he SAID TO THE OVERCOMER, I WILL GRANT to set with me on my throne. &gt;&gt; He said in Revelations 20 that he saw thrones and they set up on them. So there's a right kind of ambition. AND PAUL'S AMBITION, IT WAS THAT HE SAID THAT I may be accepted of him. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself said, "My food is to do the will of God, him that sent me." great spiritual ambitions. Now Paul himself counted everything for loss &gt;&gt; to fulfill the ambition of his life. &gt;&gt; Go to Philippians chapter 3 and verse 8. Yeah, doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the loss of all things. For whom I have suffered the loss of all things, &gt;&gt; and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, &gt;&gt; and be found in him, not having mine own righteousnesses, which is of the law, &gt;&gt; but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith, that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto death, if by any means I might attain the resurrection of the dead. He wanted that rapture, that resurrection. Not as though I had already attained. I love how Paul says this. &gt;&gt; Either were we already perfect, but I follow this pattern, &gt;&gt; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that which from I apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind me, &gt;&gt; and reaching under things which are before me. &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark of the high calling. Isn't that something? If you have the right ambition, you can forgive. &gt;&gt; If you have the right ambition, you can forgive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, if your ambition is is is that you got to get somebody back because you got to feel it's justified. If that's your ambition in life, do you see that? That turns into a real raw life. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't think anybody's got that ambition here. But you do you recognize then if it's not your ambition, why you let a grudge carry with you? &gt;&gt; See, if it's if it's not your ambition to destroy or hurt someone, then why would you ever carry a grudge more than two minutes? &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WHY WOULD YOU EVEN PACK it alone with you? See, if you if you start seeing that in ambition, okay, I have this ambition. I want to go. I I've said this through the years. People will say things to a preacher that you shouldn't say to the devil, I think. Uh I know nobody's ever said anything to you. Probably just me. But but sometime I'm I'm straight serious now. Sometimes I'm God and sometimes I'm the devil. And sometimes I get called the devil for something I didn't even do or think. &gt;&gt; Don't feel sorry for me. It's okay. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God called me to it. So &gt;&gt; So people say, "Well, how in the world you treat a person the same &gt;&gt; after they talk to you like that?" Well, what it is is I have this pocket full of invisible passes. And this is a little thing between me and the Lord. You're his child and I'm his servant. So if someone says something to me that's not nice or unkind or it's brusky or whatever it could be and and you know sometimes I'm tender. That's something else about preachers y'all don't know that sometimes they're babies. It's just the truth. Sometimes they're so Sometimes you don't have to work to hurt their feelings. I'm gonna come over here. You don't have to You don't have to try, you know. &gt;&gt; Well, so I've carried these passes in my pocket. If somebody says or does something that I even if I even think it could be and it's going to bother me a little bit, I just pick out my pocket. I just hand it to them and walk off. And when I walk off, I gave them pass. It's cool. We're good. &gt;&gt; And I forget about it. &gt;&gt; Because because I can't carry that &gt;&gt; and be who I am. Right. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't I I cannot come before you people and preach with an open heart and carrying grudges against people and and offenses and things cuz I promise you it'd come out. They promise you it'd come out. &gt;&gt; See, but you you you can't carry that in your heart. You got TO BE FREE. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAID WHEN HEBREWS 12, PAUL SAID, "SEEING that you WERE COMPASSED BY GREAT WITNESSES, let us lay aside every weight and sin that so be easily besets us that we can run this race with patience that is set before us." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us lay aside. I WONDER RIGHT NOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING that you can lay aside &gt;&gt; if for the sake OF CHRIST, FOR THE CAUSE OF SUNSHIP, for the CAUSE OF SHOWING THE CHARACTER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. IF IF THAT'S IF THAT'S IN YOUR HEART, I WANT THE AMBITION OF ADOPTION. I WANT THE AMBITION OF representing Jesus Christ. Lord, there's a couple things this morning I need to lay aside. I I got a little prejudice. I've got my feelings a little hurt. THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING DOWN IN MY SPIRIT THAT I I JUST CAN'T WORK OUT. WELL, LOOK, SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T GET ANSWERS. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach A MINUTE, FOLKS. SOMETIMES THERE IS NO ANSWER. SOMETIMES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET IN GLORY BEFORE WE EVER UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE SITUATIONS. BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW, all things work together FOR THE GOOD OF THEM that love God and are CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. AND IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING TO YOU EVIL, GOD will make it turn out for your good. Because character is not A GIFT. IT IS A VICTORY. AND YOU GOT TO SUFFER TO HAVE CHARACTER. AND WE HAVE TAUGHT OUR CHILDREN TO CLAP. and we've taught them to love AND WE'VE GAVE THEM THINGS BUT DID WE TEACH THEM TO SUFFER? SOMETIMES OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SUFFERED AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SUFFERING MEANS. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We try to make sure nobody says nothing bad to them. &gt;&gt; You know may we we we make but you know honestly &gt;&gt; sometimes people need to learn how to deal with a with a with a confrontation. That's right. &gt;&gt; They need to learn how to deal with somebody hurting their feelings and how to how to man up and say, "You know what? I didn't deserve that, but but I'm sorry I made you feel that way." &gt;&gt; You got to get through life, folks. It's going to be a short victory if you try to cut around suffering. &gt;&gt; You're going to find yourself in a waste pile somewhere if you can't motor out of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see what it is? Amen. There's a joy that's set before him. JESUS TOOK THE CROSS for that joy. Amen. LAYING ASIDE. I I BELIEVE THIS MORNING THAT there there are there are things that are going on, amen, that you know, Amen. And I I I called it cake to to kind of help people a little bit, but there's there's besetting sins that are following people's lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, y'all probably ready for me to quit, but now &gt;&gt; they're hindering you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They're not taking your salvation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're just making you ineffective. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to say something real clear. I remember when I was a kid, somebody told me that if you had a television in your house, you'd hell. And I often thought, how in the world can that be? &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm not for televisions. I I just want to say something real clear, though. &gt;&gt; If you give that kind of power to a television, you ain't give much power to the blood yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it has that kind of power. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what it'll do. It'll sap your victory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It'll take the spiritual side of your life away from you. &gt;&gt; It'll make you ineffective as a Christian &gt;&gt; because that's the center point. And and and I I could I could get real deep here because it it used to, Brother Isaac, it used to be we could preach on them televisions, man. &gt;&gt; Then everybody's got one in their pocket. [Music] So, so, so you see what happens to law. &gt;&gt; It can't be a law. &gt;&gt; It has to be a law in your heart. &gt;&gt; I just don't want this. I don't desire this. I want to be a real Christian. I I want to move forward into Christ. You see what it is? LAY ASIDE. SEE, BEES SETTING SINS. THAT'S how men get so hooked in this pornography. &gt;&gt; I used to think it's just men, but it ain't. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's girls. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne, you ought not talk about that that in church, you know. Well, you know, sometimes I think we need to. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we NEED TO EXPOSE THAT AND TELL YOU, I don't think you're lost. I think you need to come TO THE LORD AND HAVE A TALK ABOUT THIS AND GET THAT OUT OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. AMEN. DON'T DON'T DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE BECAUSE you watched A BAD FILM. DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR MARRIAGE BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN SOMETHING WRONG. THROW THAT AWAY AND FALL IN LOVE WITH JESUS AGAIN AND BRING THE CLEANNESS BACK TO YOUR HOME. DON'T QUIT CHURCH OVER IT. COME ON. DON'T QUIT CHURCH OVER SOME BAD FILM YOU WATCH. THROW THAT FILM AWAY AND COME ON BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND LOVE THE LORD. REDEDICATE YOUR LIFE. YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO, COME AND TALK TO ME. WE won't throw you away. &gt;&gt; We'll love you through it. &gt;&gt; I'm not into human disposal. I don't throw humans away. &gt;&gt; You're too valuable to my Lord. &gt;&gt; But I hate to see someone bound in that kind of thing. See, we're not running this race, Amen, just just for a day. We're running this race, amen, that we might receive a a incorruptible crown with the Lord. You know, DL Moody actually says something. He said, "The world is yet to see what God can do with one man fully surrendered to him." &gt;&gt; Will you be that person? Now, Dion Moody was reported to have said it, but originally it was said by Henry Vley, which tells you a British revivalist inspired a man that he come so inspired by that statement that he used it a lot of times in his own ministry. And then and then DL Moody began to say, "By God's help, I'll be that man." &gt;&gt; See, the world doesn't realize what it would be for a man to come fully surrendered to God. I love how Brother Brandham says, he said, "You give me just two good members in a church that's really on fire for God. And it'll do something for that church that more than 40 revivals could do. WE COULD HAVE 40 REVIVAL MEETINGS, BUT TWO OF YOU ON FIRE FOR God can do MORE FOR THIS CHURCH THAN 40 REVIVALS CAN DO." I SAID, "GOD, LET ME BE one of them ON FIRE. WOULD SOMEBODY ELSE COME WITH ME? I WANT TO BE ON FIRE. I WANT TO BE SO ON FIRE WITH GOD UNTIL THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN TAKE A HOLD OF ME AND USE me in his glory. &gt;&gt; Y'all know Brother Bam said it. It wasn't me that done them miracles. It wasn't me that spoke those squirrels. It wasn't me on the river. He said it's what I surrendered myself to. And let me say this TO YOU. THAT SAME ANGEL THAT WAS AT THAT RIVER THAT WAS IN THOSE MEETINGS is right here IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT NOW. AND HE'S DESIRING A SURRENDERED HEART. AND I SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO BE THAT ONE. I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. LORD, I WANT TO LAY ASIDE EVERY SIN, everything that would beset ME. LAY IT ASIDE BECAUSE IT'S my ambition to BE MORE THAN JUST A PREACHER. I WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; I want to be more THAN A PREACHER. BROTHER AEN, I WANT TO BE MORE THAN JUST A PREACHER. I WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN. I WANT TO BE A MAN THAT LIVES FOR GOD. I WANT MY FAMILY TO SEE A GODLY CHRISTIAN MAN, NOT JUST A PREACHER BEHIND THE PULLPIT. &gt;&gt; LOOK, WHEN I GOT SAVED, GOD MADE ME A CHRISTIAN AND THEN I become a preacher. &gt;&gt; Why is it that when I become a preacher, Amen, that I'm not supposed to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; That's a hard one for me. Do you see responsibility? I was we was up at uh we was up at that bow shoot where brother Chuck and him they have every year and uh I was up there this year. I think it was Andrew Glover. Did Andrew preach the last one we had? Andrew preach the last one. I was actually praying about something when I was up there and I was praying about church attendance. You know, I was just thinking cuz I can be a little legalist about church. I I know that I'm I'm I'm already past that. Brother Bam said, "If you're going to be a legalist, be a legalist about that." Go look it up. [Music] I could be a little legal about that, but but I have my own experiences. So, it it Hey, I need church. &gt;&gt; I need it. I mean, some of y'all some of y'all I know, but I need church. Uh but but I I was thinking I was praying about that and you know I I've adopted a I I feel like a good attitude about church attendance. I do do y'all feel like I have a good attitude about it. &gt;&gt; Like if you can't come to church I don't bug you about it, do I? &gt;&gt; I don't I mean you know I don't think I do. I I I kind of feel bad if I say much about it and I've adopted brother brother A was always that way. He's like well if you miss a Sunday I don't think you'll miss rapture. &gt;&gt; And I don't think so either. It's not what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But but responsibility of setting church attendance in your family. &gt;&gt; See, if if you set a goal in your family that anything that comes up, church is on the back burner, &gt;&gt; then you're raising a family &gt;&gt; that will approach church the same way. &gt;&gt; And in a generation when church attendance is so so uh forsaken, See, you don't want to put that seed or ambition in your in your children or your family. &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm saying that because I was actually sitting there at that bow shoot and I was praying about this and I said, "Lord, have I been too lax about this? Am I am I too?" Because it was just bothering me and I was just praying about it and Andrew got up and preached and he says, you know, he's talking about men. and he's talking about the responsibility. And he said, "Look, God has given you a responsibility &gt;&gt; to be in the house of God." &gt;&gt; And when I heard him say that, I realized it don't matter what attitude I take toward it. &gt;&gt; I didn't give you the responsibility to be at church this morning. &gt;&gt; It it it I didn't I didn't I didn't It's not my responsibility. &gt;&gt; It's I didn't give that responsibility to you. &gt;&gt; God gave that to you. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, God gave you responsibility to come to the house of the Lord. And to fulfill those responsibilities shows a godly character. &gt;&gt; It shows an ambition. &gt;&gt; But when you get relaxed and resigned when you start backsliding, church attendance is the first thing that goes. &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell me somebody's backsliding when they can't come to the church half the time. &gt;&gt; You I don't have to ask. I can see. So when WHEN YOU FEEL YOURSELF PULLING BACK FROM THE BODY, ask yourself, what am I doing? &gt;&gt; Is that far enough? &gt;&gt; Man, I feel like a pastor this morning, brother. &gt;&gt; I don't even feel bad about it either. It's kind of like It's kind of like, you know, it's kind of like my my wife was whipping my kid one day and and they said, "Mom, don't you going to say that hurts me worse it does you?" She said, "It don't, THOUGH. [Applause] You guys are amazing. You guys are amazing." But it's our ambition. &gt;&gt; It's the ambition of our hearts. It's not what somebody's making us do. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; It's a self set it's a self- set goal &gt;&gt; and it affects our attitude. And our attitude is is to is to overcome or to recognize the devil. And if you can overcome and recognize the devil, then you got to stand up to him. &gt;&gt; You have to stand up to the devil. See, and you have to resist the devil. Do y'all know if you resist the devil, he'll flee from you. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? IF YOU RESIST THE DEVIL, he will flee from you. And brother Bam said HE WILL BECOME POWERLESS BEFORE YOU. &gt;&gt; He'll become power. Think about that, man. AMEN. SATAN BECOMES POWERLESS when you begin TO RESIST. &gt;&gt; I SAY WE NEED A RESISTANCE. &gt;&gt; WE NEED A RESISTANCE TO A COLD AND LUKEWARM CONDITION IN THE AGE OF WE NEED A RESISTANCE OF WAR AND REBELLION. &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY IT? WE NEED A PROTEST. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO PROTEST COLD CHURCH. WE NEED TO PROTEST DEAD RELIGION. AMEN. I don't know about y'all. I AM SICK of dead religion. I'VE HAD ALL THE DEAD RELIGION I want. I've got all THE TRADITION I WANT. I WANT AN EXPERIENCE WITH A LIVING GOD MANIFESTING HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION. I WANT A REAL GOD. I WANT A GOD THAT CAN HEAL OUR BABIES. I WANT A GOD THAT CAN CHANGE LIVES. I WANT A GOD THAT CAN DELIVER HEARTS. I WANT TO SEE GOD. I WANT TO SEE THE GOD OF THE BIBLE. I WANT TO SEE WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S GOD. I WANT TO SEE ELIJAH'S GOD. I WANT TO SEE THE GOD THAT WROTE THIS BIBLE, LIVE THIS BIBLE IN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, IN THESE HEARTS, IN THESE LIVES. AND WE CANNOT GET THERE ON A LOUD sin message. &gt;&gt; It'll take this word. It'll take this word on word on word. And if you begin to resist and you begin to protest this devil, you can sit here this morning and bind every spirit that is holding you and you can bind it. You can bind the devil. You can bind your complexes. [Music] &gt;&gt; You can declare the word over that thing. &gt;&gt; I've got a couple things on my heart. I hope I don't get too long. Forgive me. &gt;&gt; I think we need to resist it. I think we need to resist it. &gt;&gt; You say resist what? That stubborn spirit. &gt;&gt; You say something about me not coming to church and I'll not come to church for a month. &gt;&gt; You need to kill that devil right now. &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing more than a stubborn devil and you never got it from God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I saved and been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. How do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from? Well, my Christian brother or sister, most of the times you'll find people that's got a stubborn spirit. Usually, it's a complex. Either they've inherited from a father, mother, uncle, grandfather, or grandparent, something like that. I found it discernment, he said. So, you know what that means? It don't belong to you. &gt;&gt; So, don't feel obligated to keep it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; man. Zach moved out yesterday and I was helping him with his stuff. We got the whole family involved. Y'ALL HELP ZACH. WE HELPING HIM WITH HIS STUFF. Love you, son. HEY, LOOK. IF IT DON'T BELONG TO YOU, YOU AIN'T GOT TO STORE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOT TO KEEP IT. YOU OWE THE DEVIL NO FAVORS. A STUBBORN SPIRIT IS HURTING your home. &gt;&gt; GIVE YOUR WIFE SOME ROOM. KICK THE DEVIL OUT. &gt;&gt; MAKE SOME ROOM. MAKE SOME ROOM for love and joy and peace and forgiveness. &gt;&gt; I think it's true. YOU YOU CAN RESIST THAT DEVIL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can resist it as if it was an intruder into your home. &gt;&gt; You can resist THE DEVIL THAT IS TIED to complexes. He said, "If you will just ignore him and walk away from him, he can't hurt you. &gt;&gt; You can't hurt you. When you feel you got a stubborn spirit, lay the thing on the altar, believe God, and the thing is dead and you'll never have it no more." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Resist that devil. He'll flee from you. He'll get away quickly. So, that would be my advice to overcome it, the devil by faith. That's how you overcome it, by faith. See, if you want to, now I hope you're following my channel. &gt;&gt; If you want more than temporary victory, &gt;&gt; there's a rule to follow for this life. If you want a temporary victory, here's what you do. You take a deep breath and you count 10 times and you see your psychologist and he teaches you how to handle this. Or you could resist the devil &gt;&gt; and he'll flee from you. &gt;&gt; And if you want a permanent victory, that's how it comes. &gt;&gt; I know. I KNOW MYSELF. AMEN. Did you just preach on temper? &gt;&gt; Did you? &gt;&gt; Did you touch it last week? This your fault. &gt;&gt; He's like, MAN, I AIN'T EVEN I AIN'T EVEN UP there and you're blaming THIS ON ME. I USED TO HAVE A temper that is a little bit I was 4 foot. Y'all told y'all that, didn't I? An alligator mouth and a bird body. I thought I was 6' tall and bulletproof and I really was 4' 10, 130 lbs. But if you don't think that I wouldn't tackle somebody as big as Nathan, you're crazy. I would tackle Nathan. Hey Amen. and brother Matt at the same time and throw brother Brian and I wouldn't even care. I'm serious. I never seen a man I couldn't whip when I was mad. You said, "What do you mean?" Well, I've been beat up a lot. Kicked, stomped, and everything else. But they never did beat me up. &gt;&gt; Cuz even if I had to tell them, I'll come back tomorrow. But it was a temper. It was a horrible temper. &gt;&gt; But you know what I did? I brought that thing to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he changed that temper. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK IT OUT OF ME. AND IT WASN'T IT WASN'T JUST for a week or but that's been 30 years ago. &gt;&gt; AND THAT TEMPER'S NOT IN MY life &gt;&gt; because it wasn't a short-term victory. If you want more than a short-term victory, resist the devil &gt;&gt; and he will flee from you. Now, if a person realizes they have an inferior complex or some sort of complex, how can they overcome this? If if he was only the child that caused this in early youth, see, you got to take the opposite. &gt;&gt; If you always want your your way &gt;&gt; and that little and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way, don't be a brat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let somebody else pick where you're going to eat today. &gt;&gt; I'm trying my best to make this light cuz it's &gt;&gt; He's eating my lunch. Turn that right back around and give everything you got the other way. &gt;&gt; See, if you want stuff your way, stop asking for your way and give the other person. That's how you break that thing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE SELFISH, GIVE SOMETHING AWAY. I'M GOING TO TELL on myself. One time I started paying ties before I was saved. And and I really did. I I I was a I was a sinner boy completely, but a tenth of my paycheck went down to the to the church every week. And and and after I got saved and we got tied on money, I got a little family and it got started getting tight on money, man. I got thinking I don't I just can't hardly afford to pay my ties. So, I got it got it got hard on me to do it. It really y'all y'all ever feel that? It just be it feels fine because you ain't really think you got enough money and didn't hear you giving you know and and man it was tearing me up and one day I said you know what devil I tell you what I'm just going to start paying 20% ties &gt;&gt; that devil backed up quick &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; because I wasn't going to let that devil take me away from the blessing &gt;&gt; because it was a selfish spirit telling me that I couldn't afford to give when I couldn't afford to not give. &gt;&gt; I needed TO GIVE MORE RIGHT THEN THAN I'D EVER GAVE IN MY LIFE BECAUSE I NEEDED GOD'S BLESSING. &gt;&gt; It It's the truth. I I I I'm not preaching about money. I'm talking about something else alltogether. Killing the spirit. I remember this. I remember sitting on a platform of a church and I think I had a $50 bill, maybe $50 in hole in my pocket and that was all the money we had. and we had bills coming due and this and it was it's an odd way to thank folks but the offering plate come by and I looked my wallet and I had about this maybe $50 or so and I said you know what I don't have enough money to do nothing I can't pay nothing with this I said I'll tell you what I do I'm I just took the whole thing and put it in the offer and I said now Lord I'm broke you got to help me do you know I had about $250 before I left that platform that night &gt;&gt; people just walked up and looked at me kind of odd and handed me I got down in the floor about a week later. This is true. And I had a I had a trip to make and I had to not only did I have to pay the bills I had because because as a full-time evangelist, see, sometimes you might not get back for 3 weeks if you're on the road. And then back in them days, we couldn't deposit mobile. So you'd be out on the field and you might even have the money, but you didn't have the money at home to pay your bill. And you didn't want to lose your house while you was gone. So, you had to pay up one month or you had to get everything settled before you left. And I remember getting in the floor and I started praying. I said, "God, I know you called me to this ministry. I know you did, Lord. And you put this call in my life, but I financially cannot meet the requirements that I have obligated myself to." And they wasn't ex they wasn't exceeding. They were just simple obligations, just simple house payments. And and and I started praying. And I said, 'Lord, if you if you if you have called me this, I need your help, Lord. You know when I went down to church the next night, it was a home church. This never happens at your home church when you're an evangelist. But I was at the home church and Brother Vernon's brother walked up to me who was probably wasn't much better off financially than any of us was. And somehow they had gotten some little money in. And he walked over to ME AND SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, I WAS PRAYING LAST night and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and told me that you were in need of funds." and he said, "Told me to give you $500 here." Do you know that $500 was exactly what was needed to get me out of town? &gt;&gt; But you do you see when you decided to not be selfish, you opened yourself up that God could bless you. &gt;&gt; Of course, some of you live by that. And you know why I'm telling you truth. I want a big amen from you. &gt;&gt; And now look this. Now, now complexes are something. I'm I'm going to be closing pretty soon. Complexes are something. NOW WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S something wrong. See brother ma'am says I've wondered see one sets healed and one other not healed and then another one like this. There's something wrong somewhere. I think this is it's a complex that people build up especially people who's been sick a while. You know they begin. He said now you're going to resent me when I tell you this. Do you know a man died over brother talking about complexes in church. &gt;&gt; He got mad at brother Ram and died over him saying something about complex. Amen. God was merciful. He died in church. Brother Bam raised him back up. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a complex. See, and and Brother Bram says, "See, there's something wrong. I think a complex builds up." See, you'll resent this, but I'll tell you, it's true. You take a child that's been petted because it's to a place till it wants to be petted. It builds up a complex. And you can't do nothing with that child until you shake him up good. There's a time when a person gets sick and they become self-pied and they get into such a condition. said, "Well, I don't believe I feel any better." You know, you'll never feel any better like that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, now that's not it. It is. See, that's not the attitude. You don't approach him at all like that. &gt;&gt; That's not the right sight. Don't have a complex. See, but come in with a burly robust faith. It's a settled thing. See, SEE A COMPLEX OF SELF-PITY, you're in a pitiful condition, and it's really true. But when you get to pitying yourself, you want everybody else to pity you also. And he said, I hit that spot one time. I was glad he said it like that. &gt;&gt; I hit that spot one time. He said, I was sitting there on the porch in a breakdown staying eight days in a meeting without coming to food or anything or sleep. I stayed on the platform and I got to a place that I didn't think I could ever feel any better. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I want you to I want you to hear me because this IS NOT JUST ABOUT NATURAL SICKNESS. There's sicknesses that move into the spiritual life that you don't think it's ever going to get any better. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it becomes a complex and you want somebody to pity you because YOU'RE SITTING THERE FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF. I've been in this so long and I've been through so MANY PRAYER LINES AND THAT THAT'S NOT THE ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; IT'LL never overcome that. The only WAY TO OVERCOME IT, BROTHER MAN SAYS, "ONE DAY I heard the scream of that e that of that eagle, that Christian book called Christian confession by FF Bosworth." What is it? That that very book. Amen. Christian confession taught brother Brandham the law of confessing the word of God. And if it's in your ambition to get well, start confessing the word of God. IF IT'S YOUR AMBITION TO WALK OUT OF YOUR SICKNESS, START CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD. IF IT'S YOUR AMBITION, AMEN, to leave THAT NERVOUS SPIRIT BEHIND, start confessing the word of God. If you WANT TO LET ANXIETY GET OUT OF YOUR LIFE, START CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD. IF YOU WANT SIN OUT OF YOUR LIFE, START CONFESSING THE WORD OF GOD. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS HERE RIGHT NOW TO INSPIRE YOU TO SAY, YOU'RE SITTING THERE SAYING, "I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. I don't know if I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST." CHANGE YOUR CONFESSION. HE GAVE you the HOLY GHOST. ALL YOU got to do is accept it right now. Say, "Lord, I accept that Holy Ghost." AND DON'T YOU EVER CHANGE THAT CONFESSION. YOU START TELLING EVERYBODY AROUND YOU, "GOD, GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST." AND I'VE ACCEPTED THE HOLY GHOST. AND YOU WATCH GOD BEGIN TO MY GOODNESS, IT FEELS LIKE FIRE IN THIS BUILDING. YOU WATCH GOD BEGIN TO CHANGE. AMEN. THE LIFE COMPARED TO THE CONFESSION. But if you're walking around, I can't live very high. And brother Wayne, I can't get over this and I can't do this. Reb said, "Don't you ever take that negative confession. Don't you ever do it." AMEN. BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE A RIGHT mental attitude toward EVERY PROMISE OF GOD, IT WILL BRING IT TO PASS. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, "BROTHER WAYNE, WHAT IS THE RIGHT MENTAL ATTITUDE?" GLAD YOU ASKED. The word is a seed. &gt;&gt; That's the attitude. I want an acron tree. I WANT AN OAK TREE. Here's an acron. Take your acron. Plant your acron. Water your acron. And you'll have an oak tree. You want A HEALING? ISAIAH 53, YOU ARE HEALED BY HIS STRIPES. BY HIS STRIPES, YOU ARE HEALED. THE BOOK OF PETER, JAMES CHAPTER 5 SAID, "LAY your hands on the sick and they shall recover." You begin to declare the word of God over that situation today, and it will not be a temporary victory. IT WILL NOT BE JUST A VICTORY AND GONE TOMORROW AND BACK THE NEXT DAY. IF YOU CAN OVERCOME BY FAITH, IT'S WHAT OVERCOMES THE WORLD. COME ON. YOU ARE NOT BOUND TO YOUR BIRTH. YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD COMING UP OUT OF THE MUDS OF LEADSIA INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE living God. &gt;&gt; We have an ambition and that ambition is full maturity. It's a total victory and we might have to lay aside some things to get there. &gt;&gt; But I say it's worth it. &gt;&gt; I say it's worth it. And if you can if you're if you're away from that today, why don't you remember what it was like? &gt;&gt; And brother said, go back in your mind and then go back in reality. &gt;&gt; If you can go back in your mind, can the music come? If you go back in your mind, you can begin to change your reality. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; If you can go back in your mind and you get your mind set on the things of God. &gt;&gt; I tell I tell you, isn't that a powerful song? Y'all ever heard that? I'm so glad I got a mind that stayed on Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I got a mind that stayed on the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want no double mind. &gt;&gt; It'll affect your attitude. Now, &gt;&gt; your ambition will affect your attitude. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me it won't. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, they left Egypt and was headed to the promised land. And in the middle of miracles, in the middle of miracles, begin to murmur. &gt;&gt; They begin to complain and grumble. Look at their attitude. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they lost the vision of the promised land. &gt;&gt; And they let their minds drift back to the garlet pots of Egypt. &gt;&gt; And while eating angel food, following a pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; they begin to murmur &gt;&gt; because they lost their ambition. Right. &gt;&gt; But look at Paul and Silas &gt;&gt; praising in prison. &gt;&gt; Praising in prison. &gt;&gt; One murmur in the middle of a miracle and another praises in a prison. &gt;&gt; It's attitude. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Wayne, you got an attitude." You bet I do. &gt;&gt; I got an attitude that we're going to make it. &gt;&gt; I got an attitude that you're going to make it. You're going to go all the way. I got an attitude. We're going to sit down together in glory and we're going to talk about it &gt;&gt; and we're going to fellowship about it. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be reminded I wouldn't give up on you. &gt;&gt; There's some people in here, amen, that they they've been through some things and I've been through it with them. Amen. And they one thing they'll learn, I'm not going to give up on you. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to be able to tell me something that's going to make me throw you away. &gt;&gt; You're too valuable. &gt;&gt; You're too valuable. You say, "Well, Wayne, I'm having I'm having issues and I I don't know how to get back." Listen, you're too valuable to be thrown away. &gt;&gt; So, get some help. &gt;&gt; Don't just struggle alone. Don't struggle in silence. &gt;&gt; Get some help. So, brother, I I I don't I I tell you what you do. You take the word of God, put it in your mouth, and start declaring over this thing. So, I got me a selfish spirit. Start giving some things away. &gt;&gt; I got me a hot temper. Well, get in prayer. It'll sweeten it. &gt;&gt; It'll sweeten it. &gt;&gt; So, by the way, what can we do? I tell you what we can do. We can give ourselves to him. &gt;&gt; We can know the word. We can pray and ask God for a spirit to quote the word. And then we're not going to suffer in silence. We're going to declare the word. Let the poor say that I'm rich. Let the weak say I'm strong. Do you see your ambition? I pray that today that you set your ambition. I pray that you you say, "Well, Wayne, I I I've got low ambitions." I pray right now that you set them. &gt;&gt; And Paul said to set your affection. That means it's adjustable. Brother Matt, you you can adjust it. &gt;&gt; There's adjustments. It can be adjusted. &gt;&gt; You can set it. &gt;&gt; He He knew what I was talking about. Set triggers, you know. You can adjust him. It's adjustable. You can get your goal. If you want a pound, two pound, three pound, it's adjustable. He said, "Set your affection." It is completely a choice. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's a choice of what you're going to look at, how you're going to feel about it. You're standing there and 10 spies said, "There's giants." And Joshua and Caleb said, "We're more than able &gt;&gt; looking at the same promise, looking at the same opposition, but there was two different confessions because it was two different attitudes. I want the attitude this morning. We can &gt;&gt; we can We're more than able for this. We can conquer this. &gt;&gt; We can defeat it. Not just for a service, not just for a week, &gt;&gt; but there could be a complete victory in your life today &gt;&gt; because faith is what gives you the victory over the world. Could you stand to your feet with me this morning? [Music] Amen. Lord, I lift your name. Your holy [Music] name. Jehovah God. Elohim. You're the great I am the risen [Music] my comforter [Music] and keep. [Music] Oh Lord, I live your name. Your holy name your holy God. [Music] For the reason I am the reason, [Music] oh my God, [Music] Lord For my heart can grow so far away and cold. Yet for me your love is still the same. [Music] Lord, I bend my knee and all in fear of thee. Oh my head bow down in reence to your name is Lord. I lift your name. Your holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] You're the great I am there is [Music] yes my comfort [Music] and [Music]
