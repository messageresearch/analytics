name of the Lord and amen this first day of the week representing the resurrection of our Lord Jesus amen what a tremendous time to love him and serve him and give our hearts to iten amen I know you come to the house of the Lord this morning on fire ready to give the devil a hard time and Jesus a lot of Praise amen amen I bring you greetings from Brother Ericson I spoke with him this morning and he said please greet the Saints he's still got a little cough in his in his lungs and he said he's doing well but he he felt like he maybe wouldn't have the strength quite to preach today so amen um but he just wanted to greet you all and tell you all that he loves you amen and um we certainly looking for the Lord to just continue to touch him and his body amen we certainly love you and this this morning if we could just go to the Lord in a word of prayer amen if you have a special need this morning I I wonder maybe just we might do something a little special this morning why don't you just reach over and lay your hand on someone there and I'm going to ask you to pray and ask God that he' just reach into the need there almighty god father your Prophet taught us that Lord there was a light in the body of a Believer and when they laid their hands one on another there was an eternal light that passed from the human body to the other now Lord Jesus I can't see that light but I've had a prophet Lord to teach us and father as they begin to bind one to the other Lord father I know this morning that your anointing is real and as it moves across this building father I pray that every Spirit unlike you Lord would be bound and broken this morning by Your Word oh God and May there be a healing anointing in this room that every son and daughter of God would feel a liberty and a freedom Lord father for those that be baptized today may this be a service Lord like no other may it Electrify their heart with the presence of God lord as you prepare them Lord for a grave and a resurrection today we ask you for your mercy Lord upon this Sanctuary now Lord before your people I acknowledge my smallness Lord and my inability but oh God if you could just use us this morning For Your Glory we would praise you and honor you for it Lord we would make your grace known among your people Lord and we'll tell about your wonderful name and the works that you have committed Among Us Lord we ask you father for these things now in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you today amen certainly enjoyed that song service amen amen God bless you in the book of Ephesians we want to look this morning in the fourth chapter um amen I I I told you Ephesians 4:2 but I want to start in Ephesians 4:1 and read down to verse 6 amen Ephesians uh 4 1 to about verse six there amen um what a wonderful day to serve the Lord huh amen uh 41 uh I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech ye that you walk worthy of the vocation where with you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity somebody say keep the unity keep the Well there must have been some Unity already there and he just wanted to keep it right to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling now watch that first verse and watch this one see in the hope of your calling so your calling has something to do with this uh scripture now one Lord and one faith and one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen we love the Lord this morning may God bless you as you be seated we'd like to speak to you a little bit today and I want to speak to you here uh I'm going to exchange the word endeavoring for the word striving all righten and let's let's I want to speak to you if I take the title for this Ephesians part here I want to talk to you about striving to keep the unity somebody say keep keep amen we want to keep the unity amen because you know what we found is is that Paul amen and you remember I spent a little bit of time in the great separate or Great Divide between the Gentile church and the Jewish church but then Paul began to say that the middle wall of partition has been broke down that which was between us and we're both now which were Twain we're made one in Christ so he showed that there was a a Unity that had been brought and had the The Great Divide between Gentile and Jew you talking about it you talking about a gap now in lifestyles in laws in Traditions and in their whole lives there was such a even a racial divide amen uh H such a difference of opinions and you Remember The Strife even with Peter and Paul and and and about the circumcisions and the uncircumcision and there was just so much so much there amen but but what we find is is that Paul was saying that God is our peace and he's broken down the middle wall and then he begins to speak to us about our calling and he tells us that I'm a prisoner of the Lord and remember that being harnessed to an absolute and he said beseech ye that you would walk worthy of the vocation where with you are called so Paul knew that he had to walk a certain way as an apostle he knew there was a worthiness of his calling brother man preaches a whole sermon amen is your life worthy of the Gospel amen so there is a worthiness in other words there's a way that a Christian walks and it's because that he's called to be a Christian you know when God calls you to be a Christian you're not just another and I'll say this morning most of us here are American amen you're not just another American you're not just another person you remember brother B talks how much difference there is in the American Kingdom and in the Christian kingdom amen and just because someone's American don't mean they're Christian amen and just because someone belongs to a church don't mean they're a Christian but to be a Christian means that you have the Christlike Spirit which God gave us by the Holy Ghost and and Paul is telling us therefore that we ought to walk worthy of the vocation so he's talking about movement and he's talking about walking now one thing about the communion we've learned amen is that back in the days of our Lord they walked in the streets and of course if you've ever been uh into the middle East very much most uh most of them if they have inside bathrooms they're just poed right out to the street brother brother Alex been there in India and you had to stop step across that little trough when you come out of people's houses and the the sewer raw is just running right down the street and and the and the cattle will go through it and move it up on the street and that's why in India you always pull your shoes off when you go in people's houses cuz uh there's all kinds of things along the street that that a person would pick up when they walk and of course this is a lot to do with the custom of washing the feet back in the days of our Lord when they would wear sandals and their feet would become filthy and they would wash their feet as they come in the houses with people so Paul is saying therefore that as we walk amen we have to walk worthy of the vocation or the calling which God has gave us now each one of you this morning may not be called to apostleship or you may not be called into pastorship or into the Evangelist or you may not have the ministry of such a that but each of you are called To Be A Witness of Jesus Christ your calling is as a Christian is that you are to testify to this world that Jesus Christ resurrected on the third day and he's not in the Tomb in Jerusalem but matter of fact his spirit is alive in me this morning and because he's alive I'm alive and there is a Christian spirit in this Earth because he has sent it back into our lives and as we walk we're going to we're going to encounter situations we're going to encounter problems as a Christian you're going to walk into situations as a church you're going to move through things and as you move thank God we're not stagnant is that right amen we've had a lot of a lot of changes since I think 2020 we've had a church and then we moved to the greenhouse for a while and I thank God for those days I think the church actually grew about 50 people while we was at the greenhouse you know little did we know we was in a little building and there was people waiting to come they just didn't have a seat you know and so so there was a little change took place and we had to preach in a little oddness and there but you know the Holy Spirit used those moments and then we went over to the banquet and and then we come back over here and bought this assembly and we thought we'd go in there but it wouldn't fit by the time we got here so now we're going to have to do something else so we're constantly walking well as you move and as you walk there is opportunities amen for situations to arise for inconsistencies and and bumps into human nature and lives and and could I say it if you walk around probably going to stub your toe or there's going to be something you're going to bump against and as we move in this administration of a Christian Life we must Advance ourselves and as we advance we should be getting stronger and we should becoming more Christlike and we should be laying off the old man and moving into the newness of life and if we're going to walk Paul said this is how we must move and I love how Paul says this he says we must move with all loneliness I I I I just go back and read this in the second verse as we walk with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering for bearing one another in love now now you don't think that ain't a lot you go study it a little bit but the scripture says with all loneliness now what that actually means is this Apostle is acting here as he's directing a man to walk worthy of his vocation he's saying to to fulfill this calling you have to walk lowly now if you want to ride a high horse you'll never do it in the kingdom of God the kingdom of God doesn't have high horses all of them are the spirit of loneliness and meekness amen the scripture tells us with all loneliness now the word loneliness actually is just speaking of the word humility as you walk in humility now amen I'll tell you it's a it's a powerful place to walk and I know amen that it's not the easiest position to walk in humility amen because it seems like you get walked on a lot but let me say this amen if you walk in Christian Life you're going to have to walk humble because that's what God called you to was to humility now the prophet tells us this and I'll say this with all my heart and I found it to be true and the most powerful thing that a Believer could ever have is humility because humility brother Bram said the Way Up Is Down amen now now man's got it all messed up he thinks the way up is up and the way down is down but the prophet said the Way Up Is Down amen because we put it upside down now Jesus said let the greatest among you be the servant of all now amen if you ever thought maybe that once a man becomes a pastor you know he gets to do what he wants and have what he wants and acts like he wants now you got that all messed up amen because he becomes the servant of everyone he he probably has less of his opinion than any person in this building amen you you have to give up and and I won't tell you too much about the calling but I'll say this you can't have any of yourself left if you're going to lead you you just got to completely die to all your feelings all your thoughts all your opinions everything because you know if if you're if you're going to be in the office of pastorship it's an office of a shepherd and and what I found out is this is the great Shepherd is Jesus Christ and he's The Shepherd of this church amen amen there's just one Shepherd of the church church and I found that if we get out of his way he's a great Shepherd amen and he can lead every family and he can he the best thing that can be done for your life amen is that the Holy Spirit can get a man and he can press him and humble him and and and and and it would be it' be wonderful if you could stand up here and feel proud and pride amen but but you find out all of a sudden there's no pride in you because you know you can't do nothing you can't help nobody Everything You Touch falls apart every everything you try to personally get involved in it blows up on you after a while you find yourself in a prayer closet throwing your hands up and saying like brother Bram I'm not a hunter I'm not a preacher I'm not a leader I'm a servant of you Lord and whatever you want to do just come and do and then comes the power of God because it's not a man taking the glory it's God taking the glory listen if you got anything to boast of this morning I say you are to boast in this that God gave you the Holy Ghost and gave you the love of God and you've got a family and you got people around you because God is merciful to give this to you and if you're going to walk you have to walk in humility if you're going to walk with God Amen watch this Greek word here it actually means Amen to compare it we'll go to the book of SC of Acts chapter 2019 and let's just read this here serving the Lord with all humility of Mind serving the Lord with all humility of mind Philippians 2 and3 let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in the loneliness of mind isn't this something in Colossians 2:18 he says let no man begal you of your reward involuntary humility voluntarily humble nobody has to make you that way nobody has to beat you into it you're just voluntarily low of mind and humbled in spirit amen let no man rob you of that that in Colossians 2 and 23 which things indeed show wisdom in a worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in the honor to satisfying of the flesh colians Colossians 3 and12 put therefore the elect of God holy belov barels of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and longsuffering amen F first Peter 5 and5 likewise you younger submit yourselves to the Elder yay of all you be subject one to other and be clothed with humility for God resisteth somebody say resist resist he resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble I don't want God resisting me so I want to Humble where God can give grace to the humble now it's something to me here because amen the idea is the humility of Mind amen becomes to those who are called they will walk worthy of their calling in humility let me give you that Greek word here and I and I'd have to spell it I there's no way I could pronounce it amen but it actually means to be humble of Mind lowly to be lowly is to Humble of mind the having of a humble opinion of oneself this hey look studying this I I thought I'd get under my desk you know time or two listen to this he says a deep sense of one's moral littleness modesty humility loneliness of mind now what he's saying amen be be if you're going to walk you're going to have to have a sense of your littleness now we could each of us pick up our big side and and we could make what good parts we have shine but here Paul is saying to walk you've got to walk in Humble mind aware of your littleness it's odd because this is what brother Bram teaches in influence of another he said be conscience he said one thing to be conscious of is your littleness if you want to get somewhere with God make yourself real little the Walk of humility and influence in 1963 brother bam tells us that the prophet Isaiah goes in the presence of God and when he sees the presence of God he covers his feet speaking of a man's walk he must walk in humility amen even when Moses when the presence of God take off your shoes Moses right now now brother Danny steeman one time years ago he's preaching I thought it was was beautiful he said you know Moses and Sephora had a lot of fun back out there on the back side of the desert brother Bram said she was as hot-tempered as he was and he said it actually he said they God did that to take it out of him is that right he said Sephora was Moses's cross he it crucified his Humanity amen and and brother brother Danny he got to laugh and he said he said you know what he said God was in sefar before he ever met Moses in the bush he said because the first thing that happened when Moses come in the presence of God he said take your shoes off he said how many times Sephora had said that amen take off your shoes you know so so you recognize that God can be in the thing that's rubbing you amen before you ever get into his presence preparing you to be humble to be humble in mind to not think so much amen that when you come into the presence of God it's easily to be humbled brother B said you see you you're you're actually nothing he said take a glass of water put your hand the water pull it out he says you see that's what's going to happen when they bury you he said they're going to have a funeral procession he said then after that people's going to start forgetting about you he said but your influence is going to live on and on Amen the influence that you had in life so be conscious of your littleness amen be conscious not of how big you are but of how little you are you're small and when we're that way God can if God can do nothing without us but we can do can't do do without him see see our littleness amen even if a prophet a Vindicated Prophet had to get little in the presence of God brother B said what it ought to do to you and I amen it ought to bring a loneliness now just stay with me a minute we'll go we're just building here a little bit amen don't don't get too excited amen it's a littleness of Mind a and watch what he said with all loneliness and with all meekness and I I think this is powerful cuz we're going to deal with a couple of spirits here amen what's he doing he's talking about loneliness and now he's going to compare that with meekness now meekness actually is the opposite to anger and IR irbil of disposition in other words when me when you're Meek you're able to receive injury without retaliation see what what meekness considers is how you receive injury to yourself other words if you feel real big if you're a real big person and you're real important the slightest things offend you because how dare they talk about me like that how dare they act like that toward me how dare see the bigger you get the more offended people are but the smaller you become you're surprised people are nice to you you're surprised somebody wants to shake your hand the smaller you get amen the better things are for you somebody gives you a gift if you're great big and you don't think much about it but if you're just nothing and you ain't got nothing somebody gives you a gift man it just really just swells I don't deserve to get this and and they did this for me amen so listen you don't want to see how big you want to see how little and come into the meekness of the spirit listen now somebody said well if I become Meek somebody's going to run over me well listen meekness don't mean weakness don't don't mix up meekness and weakness because in Numbers Chapter 12 the Bible said Moses was very Meek and said he was Meek above all of the men on the face of the Earth amen but watch what happens when Meek people become really but the Bible tells us in this very verse of scripture that they got to talking about him at the Tabernacle and when they did God said Moses separate yourself and he put leprosy on them because he said to them look this man Moses is different than everybody else he might must be the meekest person he said but other people have dreams and they have visions but this man I speak live to hear with and if you want to get in a talking relationship with God see how low you can become see how Meek you can become don't worry about somebody running over you we've got a Shepherd to protect us we got a Shepherd that's over our soul listen lay down on the floor and let them walk over you but there's a God that'll take up for you there's a God that'll stand by you in the middle of it listen it don't matter what we do or what others do let them do what they want to just be meek in the spirit and let him be the shepherd of your soul I'll tell you what amen if you're protecting yourself amen you'll become a very arrogant and [Music] mean it's the truth you become defensive you have a complex then nobody can help you nobody can correct you nobody can talk to you because they're trying to destroy you but as you become meaker as you become lowly look what happens it's the manner and how you receive an injury we're actually to Bear one another patiently and not retaliate or seek Revenge woo Hallelujah somebody amen better put the seat belts on and close the doors amen how are we to retaliate not with Envy not with revenge in mind come on church amen we're to receive injury amen Without Anger or without desire of Revenge with a mild and forgiving Spirit hallelujah amen I tell you what brother amen there's got to come a time in our lives the scripture actually says it that you actually can have a conscience void of offense wouldn't that be something this morning if you had a conscience That Couldn't retain offenses wouldn't it be something if you were so built that every offense come in when out it's just like your car when it goes firing off and you drove to to the church this morning there's something happening in that car it's firing and when it fires the Pistons move and the valves move and the combustion has a has an exhaust and it goes right out the tailpipe well you let that tailpipe stop up and see how far you get so there's got to come something happening and when things happen something's got to get out and as long as you got people together there's going to be offenses that happen it's not how you get offended it's how you deal with the offense when it comes listen it is human to be offended but it is divine to forgive and the Forgiveness of God Amen comes through loneliness of mind and the meekness of our spirit I tell you what let me say this you said preacher it's going to run over me but can I say what Jesus said he said blessed are the meek they shall inherit the earth listen you might not get the respect you think you need but you're going to get the Earth itself you will be in the Millennium when it comes for blessed are the peacemakers blessed are the meek for they shall see God isn't it beautiful blessed are the meek amen now you know brother bam says it he says see knowing that you're an heir to the promise not because you deserve it because God has promised it now listen not because you've done something but God's G you the same kind of promise when you're dead in Christ and take on Abraham's seed you're Heir with Abraham and the promise and the only way you could be Heir is to be dead to yourself and to take on the Seed of Abraham isn't the promise to Abraham and his seed it was given unto him in Romans 4 to be the heir of the earth so all the promises that you're connected to is to be heir of the earth is through AB Abraham but the only way to be Abraham's seed is to be dead in Christ by the baptism of the spirit and you can kick a dead man but what happens I know sometimes I feel more alive cuz somebody kicks me and I want to say something but I say hey you got to die boy amen listen let me let me can I can I just get out there can we just preach a little bit when somebody kicks you if there's a comeback you're not dead you need to die a little more you just need to die a little more you said preacher I died yesterday but Paul said I got to Die daily and brother B said if Paul had to Die daily in that day he said we'll have to die more today than we did then kind of like a fellow I was up there in candada one time and I was preaching he was quite an older gentleman hey man had a head full of jet black hair got to talking to him and I said man I said what what how how in the world you keep hair like that he said brother he said no offenses in me he said I Die daily I said oh man that's good I said' really how do you do that and I think he said it was clar all or Harris for man or something he died every day I don't really think that's what it was talking about I think dying daily is dying out to our flesh amen dying out to who we are dying out to offenses listen if it's offended today don't carry it to tomorrow let the thing go and say God it's in your hands and we're going to Mar into the power of God we are walking on Church forgetting the things which are behind the and let us press to the calling of the high listen I don't know about you but in a hundred years from now we won't care who picked the color of the carpets we won't care are are you hearing me now we won't care amen who set the temperature or whether it was hot or was it cold who's even going to remember some of these [Applause] things but as you die is the Seed of Abraham now the Seed of Abraham was them if you watch this when God came to Abraham he told him because you're the heir of the earth I won't hold my secrets from thee as you die you set yourself in position to see the revelation of the word when you die from yourself and you die what happens is you open your spirit to the spirit of Revelation and the message of the hour can become brand new to you listen the Bible said we are in a Warfare is that right we're in a Warfare this is not a recreation game this is not a game this is a fire it's not a game now that you ever hear that song Run if you want to run if you will but I come here to stay amen it's a powerful song because really it's talking about Christian warfare that's what we're here this morning as soldiers amen and as we fight the fight of Faith we've got to learn to walk so as that we can be conquering and victorious in our walk now this is this is the thing as you as you see that we should cast down every imagination bringing it subject to the word of God in other words don't allow the devil to cut your mind off from the word because of issues in your family in your church in your lives I'm preaching to you you know complexes has robbed more joy than anything I know of it's odd sometimes sometimes I mean I tell people all the time I say I I apologize for things I never did never said never thought never felt because of another person the way they view things they take injury when there's no injury meant they take offense when there's no offense meant but it's how you're receiving it so what we want to do is change our receiver we want to we want to become Meek so that we can receive without injury with all meekness now now y'all y'all know I'm PR preaching right there with Joseph y'all now there ain't nobody ever been done more wrong than he and when his Brethren come he met them with meekness and said what the devil meant for evil God used for good that's why I can say this morning is nothing the devil can do against the Church of the Living God if God before us who can be against us KN in all things we are more and conquerors in Christ Jesus amen to him that is called according to the purpose amen listen all things work together and there ain't nothing the devil can do because God who is rich in Mercy has gave us Mercy when we didn't deserve Mercy but this morning Hallelujah we've got a glory and a unity and I don't know about you but I plan on keeping it I say Satan you can't have the unity of twt I say you can't have the unity of the ministry you can't have the unity of our youth you can't have the unity of our Brotherhood I say take your hands off Satan you are trespassing on the places of almighty God and there's one preacher in this building this morning that'll say we won't settle with the devil we won't lay our Downs down and forget it I say Satan has no rights he got no rights in the house of [Applause] God no land for peace deals around here I tell you something funny the other day brother brother CLE come from over in Hager toown is a year ago I I ain't been over in a year or better he said brother why you come over on a Wednesday night there preach for us and he said uh he said it's pretty amazing he said I had a court case I was in court with and I was trying to decide what to do and my lawyer told me to settle on this land dispute he said you come over and pre y'all probably remember the message on squatters he said you come over and preached on squatters he said you didn't we ain't going to deal with the devil and we ain't going to settle with the devil that's they ain't no it's legally belongs to us and that's all he said that day I'd prayed and asked God for a direct answer on the lamb dispute he said I took it as a word of the Lord his lawyer thought he was crazy but when it was all settled almost a year later the judge Agreed 100% with his case but even his own lawyer was wondering if he was going to win well let me say something to you this morning you've already won let me tell you the judge has already spoken and you got to ever right to tell the devil not today devil and somebody somebody told Bethany one day seen a sign said she wearing a shirt said not today devil and some old boy looked at and said then when she said never and I tell you I say the same thing not today not tomorrow not next week not the next week I say never devil you will never put Your Filthy Hands on the Church of the Living God but by the authority of the word of God we adure thee hallelujah hallelujah I think it's time just to rejoice in the presence of the Lord it's mine and I'm going to keep it Hallelujah blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the earth I will not keep things back from them that's going to inherit the earth how much more will we reveal the secrets to the church as going to inherit the earth he wouldn't keep it from Abraham and he won't keep it from the children of Israel from you if we live in the spirit we ought to walk in the spirit in Galatians 6 the Bible said we are to restore in the spirit of meekness if you think you're spiritual amen and I know a lot of you are but if somebody be overtaken in The Fault let the spiritual let the one that is spiritual now spiritual don't and Y y'all got to forgive me now but can I say it you know back when I was a kid they had a they had a show called Bozo he was a clown and he went around and give everybody a button you know like the kid knew the answer he' give them a little button well let me say this finding a fault in your brother is not going to get you a bozo button can can I can I can I give you another one usually the people that see the most fault are the most troubled sometimes you feel spiritual because you see all the problems but sometimes you're living so much in the flesh that that's all you're paying attention to and the more you look the more trouble you have and the more you focus the the more overcome you are you ever noticed that when you start seeing problems in other people's lives it don't make you feel spiritual have you ever noticed that you if you ever noticed you never seeing a problem in somebody's life say oh I want to get closer to God some reason it makes you say well I wonder if there's any truth to anything I wonder if that church has got I wonder if this isn't that odd see but what it is is if you have the spirit of meekness you could consider that yourself you have problems and I know we can't talk about them this morning amen do you see we ought to restore in the spirit of meekness brother Ram tells us about it right he says don't never let no little ISM or something a little bad feeling ever rise up amongst you get it out of the way next month oh it ain't like that he said get it out of the way right now I like that one you know why because the longer you leave it the more it festers and bitterness destroys it's kind of like shooting your muzzle loer in the fall and don't clean it to the spring if that's real gunpowder just don't clean it throw it away you're going to need a new gun cuz it's going to corrode everything involved and the longer offenses stay in lives the more corrosion and the more trouble and you know you and and the more things you have said and the more people you have talked to and the more trouble has come and now you're looking how am I going to fix this I go no call that person and I got to talk that person but if it would have just been fixed right away now I'm telling you that for a reason don't think that you can take milk out of the fridge and put it outside and it'll be better tomorrow it's not getting better if you got an issue in your marriage don't think living in separate homes for 6 months is going to fix it and any man that tells you that don't know nothing about the gospel that may be in a Christian counseling or some counselor's book somewhere but unless that man is grievously grievously evil in some manner if there's an issue in a home you know what needs to happen if you can't forgive him and he can't forgive you then you ought to go back to Calvary and you ought to get right with God and get down at an altar and pray till that Unforgiven Spirit gets out of your heart come on church amen there ought to be a Oneness in a Christian marriage and it ought to be a life of forgiveness and loneliness and meekness until you can live with one another and if you can't do that amen get your experience with God because that's what it's going to take in this in this atmosphere in this age you can't just have two in a marriage it takes three in a marriage it takes a husband it takes a wife and it takes God and if God is the office above all of it and the man is below God and the woman is below the man you'll see a home that'll strike Harmony and the power of God will FL through that come on don't you tell me it's better to live alone no it's better to fix our wrongs and get ourselves right hey glory to God somebody shout hallelujah you know I'm telling you the truth a Christian ought to have loneliness of mind he ought to have meekness of spirit he ought to have longsuffering and forbearing one with another we ought to be patient with one another's faults I'm just preaching now that isn't this amazing because he said bear patiently faults one of the other your infirmities now you said preacher how do we do that turn to 1 Corinthians 13 verse 4 to 7 now this this just this reading is to me is phenomenal charity suffereth long there's your longsuffering so brother Wayne how could I get longsuffering get in love get in love with God and you'll love everybody else do you know that's the one relationship that affects every other relationship yes sir if you really really really really really fall in love with God then you're going to love love his children and you're going to try to help his children now now I I know you know when back years ago I was with a brother he was an older brother wasn't a preacher me and him was just visiting we're talking and he said to me he said brother Wayne did you ever notice something he said if it's somebody that you really really really really love he said you sit in a room and let people start talking about him he said you'll defend them he said you won't hardly set still until you have to say well but man there might be something else there there you you you'll come up with some little defense he said but if you don't like the guy he said when somebody starts talking he said you'll pull up a chair and listen and he said you'll actually pull on them a little bit do you see you say preacher why would you say that because if you would love everybody the same now some of you can put up with a lot from some people but let the let another person do the same thing and see how differently you act then that tells you that you have a hierarchy of personalities well we come to church this morning did we so find the person you're most patient with and you're the most forbearing with and you're the most longsuffering with and then love everybody else as if it was that person and your life will become uh uh it'll become a complete completely different life because now you're loving one another do you know that's the only debt you owe to God he said the debt of love that you should love one another as Christ has loved the church now watch this suffereth long as kind chth envieth not it vauth not itself it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own is not easily that didn't say that that is not easily thinketh well that's so hard to say ain't it I know he said that because I know she said that because you know it don't think evil I'm I'm talking about transitioning your whole life I'm talking about walking in a room and filling Joy again amen when you don't think no evil you don't rejoice in iniquity but rejoice in truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things watch this endureth all things do you see what it is the virtue of longsuffering may be the most manifested virtue in our manner of Lifestyle listen I'll tell you this if you're going to walk with human beings longsuffering and forbearing is going to be one of the most essential parts of your life because you can bear long with someone meaning you're going to have more need of this because of your contacts with humans now I wish we were all I wish we were as all as perfect as Isaac but we're not I don't know if he's I don't know if he's capable of thinking a mean thought and I had to throw away three to get the right on I'm tell you it took a lot of God to save me but he saved me so if he did it for me I believe he could just do it for anybody now what is it amen what is it it's not really how A Supernatural person I love Jason Krab has a beautiful song it's not how you walk on water I'd love to see somebody walk on water but I'd lot rather see them walk in this Spirit on land I'd lot rather see the Paradox of a human being with so much love in their heart that they were quick to forgive they were long to rebuke wouldn't it wouldn't it be something such a paradox to see a human being but you see God has committed this Paradox in us there are so many dangers of Divisions in the Church of the Living God but God made us one and I'll say this with every danger of division with every danger of dissatisfaction with every danger of dis unification there's a God who Still Remains on the throne of our hearts to war against it as we walk with Longs suffering and forbearance and meekness you said preacher what are you doing I'm talking to you about keeping the unity because if you're going to keep Unity you're going to have to keep the spirit that keeps unity in the Church of the Living God do you know what Unity let me say this the unity is the most precious thing that you can have as a church and I just want to I just want to clarify to the whole world I want to tell the devil and all of his angels there is unity in True Word Tabernacle there is Unity so well I know this one fusses and that and said this and that and said that that's not what we're talking about you're never going to get past disagreements amen what you have is a Oneness of purpose you have a unity of life we're going in the rapture we believe this message we're willing to sacrifice our own ideas our own thoughts our own lives amen so that we might walk in the presence of God Unity Amen in the presence of God how beautiful it is I love how it says in Psalms 133 behold how good and how pleasant is it for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard and went down to the skirts of his garments as the de of Hermon as the de that descended upon the mountains of Zion for the Lord commanded his Blessing even life forever more so what you're seeing is David was saying this stuff's so precious that it makes it powerful it actually was like the oil that was on the beard of Aaron that ran down now the brother breaks this down I won't read all these to you but I'll tell you I got the quotes brother Bram breaks this down and he said it was required of them to go in the presence of God now Unity is required of the church to go into the presence of God Unity is required a Unity of purpose a Unity of Oneness listen let me say this amen if you get the right purpose in your life you can sacrifice everything else for that purpose so when your purpose becomes great greater than your personal thought then purpose will rule in unity in a church or in a house or in a home amen now now watch what's happening it's required to go into the presence of God y'all know when you get in the presence of God everything else changes right so what you see sometimes what you really need to do is we you just lay down whatever it is and then get in the presence of God and then the presence of God will make everything else coming to line so you don't have to you don't have to get it all you just got to get in the presence of God and how do you do that just lay it all aside and I'll say this amen I I I I want to I want to give a rose where roses due true word Tabernacle is absolutely to me the greatest assembly on the planet all right you may have another favorite assembly and I say God bless you this is my favorite assembly it's my favorite pull pit this is my favorite group you to preacher how could you feel that way how could I not it really don't matter what's going on you people come to the house of the Lord lay it all aside and shout and worship and praise and receive the word of God Amen I've seen some of you come through great afflictions of lefts and lives and troubles and trials of every situation in your homes and tragedies but that never stopped you because you were trained to know if I could just get in the presence of God it's going to be okay everything's going to be okay if I could just get in the presence of God sometimes you feel like crawling in the back door but by the time the service is over you're ready to shout out in the middle of the parking lot and let the whole world know because we are the Church of the Living God hallelujah I say lay it all aside and let the power of God move us in the presence of God it's precious this morning Unity is precious it's worth giving up everything for Hallelujah it preserves a man to go in the presence of God when Brethren can dwell together in unity he said preacher you want Unity no I want to keep Unity cuz we already have it if you have something you won't keep it listen now if you ever get a new Cadillac you probably going to want to keep it if you ever get a new fishing boat you're going to want to keep it somebody can thr well you saving for boat nope got one I'm just trying to keep it you got to make that payment yall I'm just trying to keep it so why you don't have to do nothing well they can come and get it too so if I neglect what's supposed to be done I probably can't keep it come on you're living in a house you got to keep you got a house but you're paying you got to keep it you don't have to find it you already bought it but you got to keep it so you got to do what is possible to keep it and I say that that the unity of this assembly is so precious that we'll pay the payment to keep it and if it's my opinion your opinion somebody else's opinion what is an opinion worth anyhow my my old Granddad he used to say son opinions like ails everybody's got them and they raise them up and down y'all getting a lot of hillbilly sayans lately ain't you they're just a flying out there but you got it didn't you it's simple but it's the truth see opinions change telling us the value of an opinion is only good at certain moments cuz even the person with the opinion only holds it till they find out it ain't good and then they say who thought of that anyhow a bad idea so opinions are they're not they're not they're not Priceless opinions are not that valuable that you couldn't trade it for Unity right now if you had a young person sitting here today and you trying to get them the Holy Ghost and you knew that you needed an atmosphere and let's just say you had a $100 bill in your pocket and you knew if I put this $100 bill in that offering that's all it would cost to get Unity well Unity is not bought with money but it is the surrendering of opinions it's the the laying aside of ideas now you say preacher you're you're are you really saying these now listen my desire My Desire is a pure desire because what I want to see is the best for you now Jesus said in John 17 I pray this is Jesus's prayer that they may be one even as we are one Jesus prayed for Oneness so we are either in that prayer or fighting that prayer well Hallelujah I want to be in that prayer so my desire for Oneness and unity lays in the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ it's not only my desire it's his desire so my desire was give to me from him and if you listen to Oneness of unity brother B preaches it twice and he says in both of them that the desire of oness come from God he said and watch he said watch The Devil copy God's Oneness he said he always does it he takes something that is powerful copies it and he said his Oneness is always a fake Oneness or you you remember he says watch how man brings Oneness but they bring it on a false Oneness and they bring a false unity and that usually when the false comes it comes then a force to enforce it right but God never forces Unity he gives the spirit of unity and then we release willfully anything that afflicts Unity let me say this amen it's amazing that God wants us to be one God wants us to be one now I know I don't have time to clarify all these areas but I'll say this he's not talking about denominational Oneness Unity some people want Unity here in the message are among all the churches and they said well we need Unity we need unity and here I'm standing there thinking we got Unity somebody said well we need Unity we need to get together does that mean Unity if we all sit down and agree with every verse and every scripture is that is that what unity means come on church amen but yet unity means a diversity of even thought or diversity of even feeling amen but what it means is that we have one goal and one purpose and we can be unified with people who are in Africa we never met because we're one body it's not just this assembly it's all of the body of Jesus Christ and we're baptized into those bodies amen now listen there's a diversity of ideas and feelings and and that's going to be even in your own home in your own church and and some of them opinions are see some of them come from God some come from the devil and you know it's just like the other day I said you know we all know Chevys are better sorry Aiden don't quit me horse boys just walk walked out the door but that's not affected our Oneness cuz it's a car do you see now because there's a thirst then there must be a fulfillment of thirst a thirst for Oneness is a true thirst but God has a way to do it and Paul desired this in the Philippian church he said in Philippians 2 that you may fulfill ye my joy that you be like my Ed having the same love being of one cord and one mind it was Paul's desire his joy in Ephesians 4 he says it let us endure to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace Amen in Colossians see Paul was traveling to different churches he didn't change his opinion from church to church he says this in Colossians in the colossian church Above All Things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which you're also called in one body to the Corinthian Church he said there should be no Schism in the body but the members should have the same care one for another now the word Schism here actually means division there should be no divisions right in First Corinthians Paul says it like this brethren in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ speak the same thing that there be no divisions among you somebody asked me the other day he said brother Wayne is it possible for all the message preachers to say the same thing I said if they all say say what brother Bram said it'll be easy somebody on a certain teaching they were talking to me and they said well certain certain certain Ser said this and he said that and he said that I said well what would you teach if you didn't know so and so he said well I guess I'd say what brother Bram said I said well then what's the problem see if if if another voice is added to it there's your division right so it's not the person staying with the message that's causing the division so as long as your heart is on the message you speak the same thing brother bandom said the prophet the spirit and the bride will say the same thing that will be a perfect union in that church amen that God would be able to put them together if there is anything contentious comes in now since we're teaching here in this little area let me just for a moment just touch this I'll probably not be on it for a while so might as well touch it while we're here if there would be something contentious that would come in brother Wayne how do we deal with it Mark 11:24 to 26 I say to you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive and if you have odd against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither with your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now let's go to Matthew 18 I say unto you that if two shall agree on one thing on the earth as touching anything they shall ask it shall be done of them of the Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them then came Peter to them and said Lord how off if my brother should sin against me and I forgive him till seven times ah and Jesus said unto him I say unto thee until seven times but until 70 times 7 490 times brother rap cook figured it up I think he said it was two minutes every two minutes you got to forgive somebody I preached that out brother Ron Spencer everybody running around after church and somebody said something they said you got two minutes so if you start saying something today at lunch somebody goes you know you're in trouble if you're about to leave stay two more minutes it'll help do you you see now Paul says that we ought to if possible everything that lies within us live peaceably with other men in Acts the 2 chapter they were all gathered in one room but they wasn't just in one room but the Bible said they were in one Accord they meant they wasn't just in the church they wasn't just in a home they wasn't just in a room they were in one mind and they were in one Accord you know what made them in that one mind Jesus said unto them in Luke 24:49 he said if you'll go ter in Jerusalem that you'll be endued with power from upon High I will send the promise of my father upon you when the promise of God was to be sent upon them Isaiah 28 the prophet of God said with stammer lips and other tongues will I speak unto these my people and this is the rest where with caus the weary to rest amen what was it Isaiah prophesied an outpouring of the spirit of God Jesus was telling them get in that room and I'm going to send the Holy Ghost in there he gave them 10 days to get it out of them he gave them 10 days to let it all get out of them they worked out every little issue and they worked out every disagreement with the promises of God and they got in that room and said we're going to receive the promise we're going to receive the promise we're going to receive the promise and they waited and they waited and they waited and they waited till eight days and somebody got up and said okay guys I think we got it we ought to just go home now brother B said no that wasn't the way it happened he said they waited till something happened he said and when something happened he said there was the rush of A Mighty Wind coming in that building and it filled their hearts where they were setting the Bible said that was clothing tongues of fire now Church think about this there were clothing tongues of fire that came and settled on 120 different people amen somebody said well preacher how we ever going to get the church in Oneness amen that's how they got in Oneness they got under a promise of God God and when they got in unity in that promise God sent the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God got in every one of them and made them of one body think about this the god of Heaven who was that Pillar of Fire tore himself apart that he might put his body together Jesus tore his body apart that he could put you together can you think of that this morning that God would tear himself apart so you could be one he would take him to Calvary and tear his body so you could be one I'll tell you this I believe God has got that kind of church this morning I believe he paid for that kind of church and he wants that kind of church and if I don't know about you but I want to give him that kind of church I believe there can be perfect unity in the house of God I believe there can be perfect unity in Brotherhood I think it's too bad we get away from it but I believe it's possible and I believe we have obtained it I say we ought to keep it I say we ought to not let it die brother B said that great spirit is on us don't let it die stay there stay on your days and night on your knees and keep the spirit of unity among you he says the ministry should unite the body you're not worried on me are you amen the ministry are to unite the body not denominations but you ought to unite brothers and sisters in purpose and in heart and in unity to see the coming of the Lord Jesus amen we ought to handle ourselves to maintain Unity now here's a beautiful thing brother brandom now I I don't know of a more spiritual man that lived in Our Generations there was nobody even in the same universe with William brandom in wisdom and Revelation in knowledge now now I'm not saying this because we have a church project it actually just the way brother B taught it but y'all know brother Bram had a church project in 1962 right and they Advanced the building do y'all know that brother Bram wasn't for it actually but he said I seen what the brothers wanted to do and he said we had a vote and he said that ought to be the motive of every Christian every person in the church is unify ourselves together and stick together look at this he say let's sacrifice our idea because that's the the only way to Stand United so brother brandham actually brother brandham actually voted that he didn't want the building but the rest of the church voted for it so he got behind it now now you're talking about a man you're talking about a man that was small because he could have just stood up and said look I'm a prophet and we ain't going to do this but he's saying the heart of the people people and he said you know what it's just my opinion so what he's doing he's showing you how that the appearing of the Lord would bring a Unity among the people brother Brandon was more spiritual than any of us guys and look what he done he brought Unity now you find out then the unity that the prophet teaches is to bring it he wanted to put us together and I'll say this do you know brother Bram said you're stronger together do you know the Bible said you're stronger together sir he and brother man said if you got a part of the Holy Ghost who got the Holy Ghost in here if you got a part of the Holy Ghost and I got a part of the Holy Ghost next man's got a part of the Holy Ghost put them together and is three times stronger than it was each one of you brother Bram says has a little fire in here and each one of you is a part of God and when you come together together it's the body of Christ uniting Hallelujah brother Bram says it like this we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each of us is holding a part of God we must come together the pillar of fire is manifested in its wholeness and its fullness and when his church sets together in Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings the pillar of fire back again you see what it is here we are sitting here brother B said maybe 50 of us well we're probably what six times that 50 of us sitting here together we got 50 spoonfuls where there is Unity where there is a gathering there is safety just as twice as hard in a prophet's hands as the sticks to break than two sticks are to break them one brother B I'm actually demonstrating what is an example of and you can do this when you get home if you want to take one pencil and break it and take 10 tape them together and then break that and you'll see that you're a lot weaker by yourself but when you put yourselves together the Bible says amen if one could chase a thousand then Pooh could put 10,000 to flight think about that if one could chase a th000 and two 10,000 what about you this morning what what about you this morning as a Church of the Living God I'll tell you what brother Bram says he said two good members that's really on fire for God it'll do something for a church that 40 revivals couldn't do you could have 40 revivals but two of you on fire in unity this morning can do more for this assembly than 40 Revival meetings I'll tell you what I'm looking for is for two I'm just looking can I get two this morning well I got a lot more than two well I tell you this I believe the devil's in trouble then I believe we get two on fire and what about if we get 300 on fire and their hearts begin to join together I tell you what the devil's in trouble brother B said if you give me 500 people that was in the spirit of God and on fire I'll do more for the kingdom of God than they've done in 2,000 years can you imagine this morning this is uniting time the message of the hour was released for your Unity this has never been since the early church has the seals been released to unify the church church God tied the Mysteries together to tie the church together he tied the word together to tie the church together it is written in the scripture that there would be a gathering in the last day and they would be gathered unto him so when he appears in the church it brings a gathering of the Bride of Jesus Christ and looks now when he starts appearing people were in denominations and they were disunified but when God appeared they came out people were in their homes and they were in their is but when God appeared they came out he began to unify them by his presence oh I say this morning there is a trumpet calling the church together I say there's a seal that has opened up there is a word that has been released and it's calling the church out of every Walk of Life every opinion every situation every racial divide every social divide every emotional divide he man brother B said he's got them ducks and he said one Ducks was over here and another Ducks was over were here and they had a fence in between them and brother Greg brother said there were ducks on both sides of the fence he said and you could keep them in the fence he said Till the water gots AR Rising he said after a while the water got up high enough that it let the Ducks out of the fence and I say if you have fenced yourself off with the off fences of your life with struggles and trials and differences I say the Holy Ghost this morning pour out on the Church of the Living God to raise us in a place that we can remember we're all ducks we're all the children of God we all love God hallelujah I believe it this morning I believe the Holy Spirit pulls us together amen I believe this that we ought to know this morning where there is disunity the spirit of God is not welcome and I say he's welcome here this morning he's welcome in the Church of the Living God can our musicians come today I believe this I believe expectancy we'll bring together the church brother bam said it like this he said if they hadn't to separate the American Indians it could have never whipped them so the first thing first thing the devil does is separate divide before he conquers take take those take those 10 pencils can you get a imagination with me take a ball of 10 pencils and line them up and just wrap tape around each side and try to break them you can't do it nor can you separate them because they're bonded together so the first thing you'd have to do is break the bond that holds it together and once you break that Bond scissors knife nail clippers really don't matter what you use but when you can individualize then you can break so you can see that Satan would like to break a bond of Peace so he can individualize I mean I mean we all live right we all got families and we got called to church and we all got issues anybody that ain't never been offended or troubled anything like that you go ahead and go because I ain't talking to you but anybody else have you ever notice when you get a offended your first thought is not hey I'm going to get closer to that person isn't that odd if you think somebody said something bad about you or they did something against you why isn't it your first thought I'm going to go give them a big hug and tell them how I love them it's actually opposite to that I don't know if I'll talk to them again [Music] because it's the enemy that divides but when you get to praying you ever notice this when you when you get to praying it makes you love people more and you ever notice this when you get in a forgiven Spirit you forgive everybody when somebody's really serious about forgiveness when they really get to that place they want they want when they really want people to forgive them and they want to get right with the Lord and they want to get right with people did you ever notice they're not specific on like they don't just pick one person let's just say maybe they're upset with you brother John and they're upset with 10 other people too but they won't just come to you they'll want to get it right with everybody sure but watch politics if somebody needs to correct something politically they'll pick the political Choice make it right there and not make it right everywhere else but when someone really wants to make things right and get it right in their heart they just want everybody to love them they want to make it right with everybody they'll just stand in the middle go among people and say hey if I've ever done anything if I ever said anything you watch somebody new Christian It's the funniest thing their conscience is so it's so open and they'll they they'll stop him and they'll say but way if you know of anything I've done done or anything I said I'd like to get it I'd like to just get it right and I tell you this morning God God is still moving isn't he amen I know I've been in the Ephesians book a while we we're going to be in a couple more chapters and then we'll be out of it but this morning as we walk in the calling we're called Christian kingdom there's one law but love all loneliness and humbleness of mind we should be longsuffering endeavoring striving to keep what we have I want to keep it I want to keep the unity if you want to keep something sometimes it cost you something so if there's a little something in your heart this morning something you would like to say brother Wayne before God I want to keep my Unity maybe in your home maybe in your little family your little family there's a there's an upheaval and you're sitting there thinking how how we ever going to fix this let me tell you there's a God who divided the Red Sea and put it back together again there's a God that put healing in your body I was just thinking about this this morning brother I just down preached for Matt Morrison I remember when he was a little boy he was playing and McDonald's fell down and he broke his wrist it it was broke broke and he come in there and that thing was they there was a whole group standing around there and he was crying with that broke wrist and he come up there in McDonald's and his mom and several of the sisters were standing there and they just wished over and laid hands on him and they started praying and when they started praying there was a pop and that that hand just straightened out and it healed instantly and one of them just out of their breath said it's the third pull now something can be so severely broken and everything everything in your knowledge tells you that takes 60 days to heal you might have to go to surgery and sometimes you have to and you might have to have a pen in it and then it'll hold it together wide heels and you'll have to carry it for months but there's moments under the power of the spirit that he can heal something in a second there was another little boy Kyle down there in in Arkansas my wife was standing there when it happened they was playing after a a a fellowship and there's dinner and kind of like out here and some of the kids running around little boy fell and he broke the top part of his arm there were two there were two fire uh firemen standing there and they were building a splint for it Chris is sitting right there they were building a splint for it and the little boy he started crying and he looked up his daddy's the first uh responder in the fireman he looked up his daddy he said Daddy he said can't we at least pray [Music] his daddy just said he told me brother Morgan he told me he said he said I didn't have any faith and it was going to change he said but he asked me and I felt embarrassed I should have prayed first he said so I reached over and put my hand on him we started praying and Chris is sitting right there the arm straightened and healed instantly on the spot so you come in this morning you say brother Wayne things are broken and they can't get back I serve a god that can heal it instantly I serve a God that can send a spirit in this building and things that you say they're so broken brother Wayne they can't be put back together I say that God can restore anything I say God can put things back like they're supposed to [Music] be sure brother Bram spoke to that storm out there didn't he I just I'm just rehearsing this over this week thinking brother bisco talking about the brown bear you remember that sister L with the brown bear and brother Bram he didn't go the right direction the brown bear showed up and went off and brother Bisal said he he told me this personally sitting on the couch he said brother Wayne it rained for days he said finally brother Bram said guys we need to give up and go home he said the Hunt's over we need to just go on he said we went out there and he said brother Ed which way was that bear and he said I pointed over that way and he said brother R walked over there I think he said he took his hat off I don't remember the exact record of it but he I think he said he took his hat off and stood over there in that area and when he come back he said brother Eddie it's going to be all right he said I've been the I've been the Jonah on this trip I didn't obey God he said but it'll be all right now he said we'll ride out of here dry and brother Ed said it's been raining for days brother Wayne and any hunter in here knows when it rains the leaves are soaked the trees are soaked everything's soaked you get wet walking to the deer stand how many deer hunters know what I'm talking about you walk through the bean field on that on that uh morning in October and the D just fills your legs up you know what it's like but brother Eddie said he said when we started riding out of there he said my old horse slapped aside of one of the bushes he said and that thing shook he said it wasn't a drop of water on the leaves he said there was a wind come out of
