be right uh reading Daniel 5 and verse 25 I do want to say I I I appreciate uh I appreciate our medical people here in the church and if there ever was a time people are hurting and sick and needing help it's now and uh we were having breakfast with Zach and B the other morning and I just thinking that brother Ray and I can't get in to pray for some of the sick but God's blessed us with these these young men and they're they're going in Daily and visiting with brother Daren brother Robert they're praying with them and and I just say God bless them and we sure thank the Lord for them amen um we just want to do that Daniel 5 and verse 25 if you could pull that up thank you uh and this is the writing that was written many many tickle you Farson this is the writing that was written God bless you as you may be seated this morning uh I have just read something to you uh that was supernaturally written on the party halls of the palace of Babylon when it was coming to an end I want to this morning to speak to you a little bit from Daniel the 5th chapter and uh uh the subject would be the handwriting on the wall uh we have several places that we can pull from this morning uh because of the uh because of the message of the hour uh we have an absolute Authority on this subject and a able to look deeper into it than just the surface and uh we want to if we can just maybe to take a few minutes in the setting you that was here on Thursday night we talked a lot about uh Nebuchadnezzar and his time in the field and the lessons that was Learned was a learn was of humility and uh in Daniel the 5th chapter this is a time of the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar uh the rule has left and uh NE Nebuchadnezzar's son had actually ruled for a period of time but he had brought on his grandson Bel shazar who was uh Nebuchadnezzar's grandson they were actually ruling here together there actually was I believe there was two two leaders at this moment and uh but yet the the grandson had moved up a little closer in and it was actually become the king of of Babylon here in the Book of Daniel the 5th chapter you'll read a couple different places it'll call this boy the son of Nebuchadnezzar but it was actually his grandson uh and so but as you as you read here the setting of this scene a prophet will take us back here and he'll talk to us a little bit about the city of Babylon now we've been studying The Book of Daniel and we've been talking a lot about Babylon so I'll not go deep into that area of it but but but we do know that Babylon uh was a city that was built of course uh in that time it was a great scientific City it was the leading city of the World many things we have today actually come from Babylon it's even today uh like your 60 minutes in an hour 60 seconds in a minute and 24 hours all that came from Babylon there's several even the hieroglyphics some of the arithmetic a lot of them things actually come from those time period so they're very Advanced people and uh this this city of Babylon that uh that we're reading about this morning had is come to its Glory it's come to its Heights it's uh been a city so long that it has become secure within itself and within the borders of its walls it had a a tremendous Army great Army brother Bram said it had of course I think he was referring to America when he said it but he's talking about they had the greatest of armies even of Atomic Warfare and he was talking about the power of the Army in that time and he said Not only did they have a tremendous Army and had done had done amazing feats as far as being conquerors they had also at the same time built walls around around the city of Babylon uh brother Bram says it here he say it's amazing that they was some near 200 ft high and 80t thick uh the city's circular was about 120 mil so they had 120 miles of 200t high walls that were 80 foot thick he said they could run chariot races on the top of those walls they did have the gates in the city but the gates were actually brass so there wasn't wooden gates which was a great protection from fire whenever an army would attack of course the way they would attack was they would attack the gates and if there were wooden gates they just shoot them full of of fire and then burn the gates and break through and they they go on so these guys had stone walls and they had brass Gates and they were thick enough that they couldn't get through it high enough they couldn't climb over it and brother Bram said because they had gotten Behind These Walls he said they had began to get a great security and to believe that they were Untouchable and brother B says anytime man gets in the place where he builds security like this he said this is the point that sin begins to take over when men believe that God can't see them or that there would be no re recompense or no payment for the things that done he said that's When sin really begins to ramp up uh it normally does not produce a better place to live it produces a better place to sin and so whenever that they started doing this this this is a point that brother Rah is very strong on and by making this point he brings it up in handwriting on the wall and he did something back in the Matthew series if any of you remember back that far when we were dealing with Matthew 2 uh we we actually went into how that the Bible said and God had brought uh his son out of Israel and use that specific scripture to prove that God uses the scripture more than one time so sometimes we see people read a script scripture and they think well that's the end of that scripture whatever one time it was in the Old Testament or something but brother random uh actually brings the Bible to us and says that the Bible is not just like a letter that you wrote one of your friends he said like if I write you a letter it's good one time to that one person he said but the the the Bible is the inspired word of God he said so it's so powerful he says that its meanings and its scripture are manifold in other words it it will be used again and again because of the meaning in the case of Matthew 2 I bring thy son out of Egypt he said that was Jacob when Jacob come out of Egypt when Israel come out of Egypt but again it lived again when Jesus was brought out of Egypt in his day same scripture amen but it was used the same way of course again uh we know the scripture says that uh talking Jesus one day said you seek a sign but no sign given to a wicked and adulterous gener gration except the sign of Jonas of course that's a double scripture it's in the days of Jesus but brother B said he was speaking that day but really was meaning it for this day so when we look back in the scripture and we're reading Daniel chapter 5 brother Bram uses Daniel 5 exactly the same way and he said actually see that the scripture is today repeating again like it did in the days of Babylon so when you're reading Daniel 5 you think you're reading about Bel jaar's Feast you're thinking about something that happened to 539 BC see you're thinking it's that far removed from you over 2500 years but actually you're reading uh today's newspaper you can take the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation and you can realize it's actually happening right now today because scriptures are repeating itself now what brother random is showing us is we do not have Bel shazar we do not have Babylon but we have America and we have the same spirit that was existing in the days of Babylon is existing today the same way now brother Bram is very clear to say that Spirits don't die he said men die but the spirits live on so we see that that as the repeat of scripture begins then you can go back in the scripture and brother bam does a tremendous job to do this of showing the similarities between Babylon and the current day and he actually makes the scriptures begin to live quite quite profoundly he preaches it several times it's entitled handwriting on the wall I would suggest anyone could would go listen to it and look because even brother bandam draws out points like certain like uh they had 200t roads now that that's an odd thing uh to say about a city having 200 foot roads typing it but how many you realizes that America didn't have super highways until just the last 50 years it was a you go through a lot of little towns and you you you look and see how the little bitty streets was in the towns I've been to Europe several times EUR European streets in Germany sometimes on those little streets you can't hardly even put one car and they park on the because it was in the times when America was born of course it was it was a horse and Buggies and it was small cars and then the roads come along and it was just little I don't know if you've ever seen the cars from the early 40s but they're just little narrow cars and so the the the the highways were very small in this country but after World War II remember they seen the autobond it was in Germany and they come back and Eisenhower began to build the interstate systems and he was doing it for military use to be able to uh to bring the military across and they started building interstates and super highways well you you think those things just happened but brother brandom had a vision in 1933 where there would be a an auto car automated car driving down a super highway and he explains these real super wide highways but they didn't have them in 1933 but today look at the super highways we have and he talks about Babylon in the days of its destruction having 200t highways so he's showing us that whatever was existing during those days have now begin to relive again and not just the highways being wide not just the militaries being great but we're living in a time when the attitude of the people have returned to the same attitude that it was in that day see in in this country now I know many of us is too young to remember these things but we do have history and we do have books and you can read and look and uh but in the in the 40s in America people were desperate for God not just the message people not just a few people uh that were in a certain type of church but but you had community churches and you had where people got together everybody prayed they they were praying for soldiers and the war America was almost being taken over by the Japanese and the Germans and the security of the future wasn't there and people were fasting and praying and holding visuals and Revival meetings and and they were longing for God but see after we won the war and after things begin to settle down we begin to get a bigger military we begin to get the UN we begin to depend upon one another and we thought everything was everything was settled America's too great to fall right now as soon as that attitude begin to live in America people all of the sudden watch what's happening in the same time periods rock and roll was being born television is starting to come out sin is starting to go on the increase like never before I I thought it was amazing at the parallels when brother BR begins to talk about belshazzar here who is the is actually the the the king at the time of the destruction of Babylon that his attitude brother B said his attitude his Spirit was that we canot fall we cannot be destroyed now here's the problem with that the scripture had already been prophesied when Nebuchadnezzar had had a dream and Daniel had told Nebuchadnezzar that there would come an end to his kingdom and the mes and the Persians were going to overtake it when this scripture is being transpired in Daniel 5 there has been already two great battles between the mes and the Persians and the Babylonians and the Babylonians had lost those battles and the Persians had besieged the city of Babylon they was literally circled the city of Babylon and this man was so arrogant that he didn't believe that they would be able to penetrate those walls or my kingdom cannot fall uh uh it's recorded in history that the day they threw this Festival that the per that they had looked out and the Persians had disappeared and they believed the Persians had gave up and went home that's what they thought they thought this is all over Russia's not going to attack us they're not going to use their bombs this is all finished we can all relax we can hold a party we can we can we can just go back to the business as usual and brother M says what happened that day was this this Bel chazar the Bible record towards it that he invites a thousand of the princes and begins to have a party and and they I love how brother Bram says things he said they had a rock and roll party amen they had a rock and roll party well I'm the guy I went back and looked and you know you do you realize that Elvis Presley did not even come into music until 1954 he come in Sun Records in 1954 amen from from down in the south of Mississippi there and it's amazing to me that in 1954 what was transpiring on the earth spiritually amen but the entire American popular was swung towards rock and roll in the same hours that there was a prophet on the scene and God was doing something to deliver the people and he was bringing the adoption authority to the church from The Book of Romans the sons of God was going to receive the authority of the spoken word just in a short few years that would come and an adoption robe set upon a bride a blood wash bride and while God is transpiring working in the Supernatural to bring the greatest Revival that has ever struck the planet in them same hours Satan is inspiring Elvis Presley to come out of the Pentecostal church and and bring a rock and roll and drums and a hot guitar and cause the girls to begin to Boogie wogie and brought brought actually brought sex acts right out on the platform and brought the spirit of sexuality and rock and roll and sensuality brought it right into the right into the platform back in 1954 amen every church was preaching against it the Baptist and the lutherans and everybody was preaching against it but all of the sudden amen the the people the people began to win the battle and begin to get what they wanted so rock and roll begin to take over amen it just a couple years before that prohibition had Struck it it it had never been like this in the history of the world alcohol was legalized right here this country now I come from Arkansas I just be honest for years right there in that little town in Arkansas where we come from you'd have to drive a solid hour to get a beer you you would unless you found somebody illegal CU every County around where I live was dry there was no even till today they're all dry counties there there was five liquor license give in a city I worked with in Jonesboro Arkansas and there was two clubs in that City and there there was five I believe five liquor license we looked it up one day to see who owned it three of them the Baptist Church owned they bought them and used them and said they they actually bought the liquor license so nobody else could set up a beer joint in that town that that was the kind of that's the kind of feeling that was in that area against liquor but but you recognize if that would have stuck in every family in every home now we now Liquor's been legalized so long now that people don't think that much about it just a little social drink or a little little something to be drink but but you recognize that it all always magnifies the wrong kind of nature amen and it emboldens we used to say got get a little bit of Whiskey In Me 6ot tall and bulletproof and that's true amen they're six foot tall and bulletproof they'll fight and meaner than a a snake a and make up bold things and do bold things they would never do that without alcohol but the more alcohol is drink the Bolder people come the more less they're worried about the consequences of things amen you you you see when you're thinking with the right mind you're thinking about the consequences of your choices not just your choices but when you when you get a little bit under the wrong influence you forget about the consequence and you just make the choice to whatever the whatever the flesh wants now we can promise you something that the pleasure of sin amen it the Bible calls it pleasure so the pleasure of sin is real but it is only for a season you see it is only a season that is pleasurable and then it becomes very costly there there's many homes today that have been broke apart by alcohol there's many homes today there's many there's many of little kids that will go to bed tonight on an empty stomach with no clothes amen with with with a horrible living conditions because Daddy went and spent the grocery money on on a pack of beer and got drunk and and spent I I've literally oh my Lord I don't know why I'm here but can I is it okay if I preach y'all this morning amen but literally I've seen guys give away $100 bills and their kids at home and needing clothes and needing food and but they get a little drunk and they just lit I've literally heard men holding $100 bills and burning them right in the air because they a little bit SED they wanted to be uh uh show how big they were because they were on alcohol now now now that that thing was alive in the days of Babylon and you you tell me where has it ever been any worse than it is right now you can't even go to a restaurant without there being alcohol everywhere amen and what's going on why is it brother Ram tells us in the message he says what happened is God sent a comforter he says he cares so he sends the word which is a comforter but men could not receive the spirit of Truth as a comforter so they're literally so neurotic they have to have something so the alcohol is making more alcohol than they ever have people drinking more whiskey more beer CU they're trying to satisfy or bring a comfort to that situation ation that's in their life they're smoking more cigarettes cigarettes were not even invented to the late 1800s or 1900s amen it wasn't back in the back in 1700s you know that pictures where people walking around smoking cigarettes all day that that wasn't that wasn't something to do but it wasn't until the maror man come along and then they went into the Hollywood and and Hollywood see it made a way to make it where uh important people drink whiskey and smoked cigarettes amen it made a way where people who were supposed to be a certain way did things like this which become popular which then become the a very run of the meal now I I I hope you're see what I'm trying to say to you that the spirit that was in this day was no different than it was in that day they were drinking they were having a rock and roll party they were enjoying the night life they were having a good time it wasn't just the people the president was the one that invited them to do it they're having a party because there's no consequence there's no God he can't see us we're Behind These Walls we're falsely secured that's what a prophet is telling us they were had their security in their military they had their security in their walls not in their God Amen but brother Ram says it he said but look he said amen God was not looking through the walls he said he was looking down through under through the walls he was above the walls looking down on the sin he wasn't trying to see it through so the false sec security had brought them that way now I I want to take just a moment in this deceiving age we're living in probably brother Ram said it's the most deceiving of all the ages this is the season of time when the man of sin shall be revealed now he said what was a a child of disobedience in the days of Paul has now become a man of sin he said how much greater is a man deceiving than a child is deceiving so we're living in the age right now where we have built churches and church membership and people have become members of churches and they have decided that they're secure in the church membership live like the devil five days a week go to church on Sunday but if you're a member of that church it's all right everything's okay God's not going to be able to see through that church membership amen do you see the falseness of the security that is being built within the people the lie that is been told to the people just believe and you've got the Holy Ghost just believe my Doctrine and you're safe from all tribulation you're safe from everything just believe that's all you have to do is just believe and you got it it don't take a life it don't take Doctrine it don't take truth it don't take life it don't take Holiness do do you see the falseness of the security of what the devil done in that day he has repeated in this day doing the same thing but today men are not hiding behind walls they're hiding behind the Fig Leaf of man-made r religion and they decided that God can't see through it but he saw through it in the Garden of Eden he looked right through Adam amen he looked right through zakus when he was hiding he climbed up high and got behind a fig Leaf but that Discerning Spirit of the Lord Jesus looked right at him amen and said zakus come on down you can't hide behind the leaf Adam can't hide behind the leaf and you can't hide behind the leaf you cannot cover up sin you cannot make it look pretty you cannot say it's okay because amen because I'm so and so or I believe certain thing sin God will judge wherever that it is found God will judge sin that's the truth friend amen whether it don't matter where you come from or where you're going that stands to be the truth God will judge sin and there is only one covering for sin there is only one place to hide from sin that is in Jes Jesus Christ the son of God and the only way to get into Christ he said by one Spirit we are baptized into one body and the only way you can ever say I am safe is if you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will bring a safety into your life oh aren't you so glad today to know that you're sitting under a word that is told you don't be settled on memberships don't be settled with a church don't be settled with the doctrine you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and let the spirit and the life of Jesus Christ come upon you do you see what it is it's a type of America it's a false security they close the doors and build up a military and believe they could do what they wanted to now look what they do brother bam will say it one place he'll say and while they were doing this there was a prophet in the land I thought oh my Daniel was there the whole time that was message and there was a prophet existing while they were going the way they were going amen there was a prophet there the whole time but rather than obeying the message rather than humbling to the message you know what they did they made fun of it can you imagine making fun of a message with the Persians camped outside the gates are you hearing me Russia don't have to make bombs today they got them Putin doesn't have to describe and make new Atomic Warfare he's got it what will destroy this world is setting in the bomb hangers today what is going to obliterate this world that we're in is in the bomb hangers you said well God would never do that to America but in 1933 the same guy that saw Germany being Hitler invaded in into into musolini and how musolini would die and how the cigarettes would become illegal to smoke and how they would build the magin online amen how he said an automatic car was coming how that there would be a woman dressed in purple of president or vice president of the country amen the same guy that said all of that he said the last thing I saw was America laying in ashes he said I had to turn my head from it it was so bad look church amen this America is finished this America judgment has come on it not not today in 1956 a prophet announced the Judgment Upon This Nation they had turned down the baptism of the Holy Ghost and only judgment is left for this nation that we're living in do not build your home as an American do not build your life as an American you are a citizen of another kingdom do not invest in America do not invest in the politics of America do not set your securities as an American amen be before I'm an American I'm a Son of God before I amen of any civilization of this Earth I am a child of God Daniel was in Babylon but he was not a Babylonian he was an Israelite amen and today we are the sons of God and and as the prophet said we are more Jew than the Jew because we Are Spiritual Jew by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are the Seed of Abraham and Heir according to the promise the Judgment that that's on This Nation amen does not mean our end it is declaring our a beginning my don't forget who you are now what's amazing is they bring these things out and they begin to make fun of them in one place brother randam said the vessels they were making fun of was Holy Ghost filled people God's vessels they were making fun of the vessels uh I I I think that it's amazing that the the scriptures tells us that the arrogance of this man I want you to read the chapter when you get home I'm not going to read to you a lot but but the arrogance of this man Bel chanard this is how arrogant he was in the middle of the very ones that were prophesied to take over his kingdom he literally was having a rock and roll party and to top it off you know what he done he told his his his people his authorities he said you go down there and get the vessels that we pillaged out of Jerusalem where we destroyed that place of worship you go get the vessels and bring them up here and let's drink out of them brother BR said can you imagine the vessel of God when they poured Pat's Blue Ribbon into the vessel can you imagine that he had such a a boldness that God could not get to him amen he had such a disdaining thing for God that he poured that that that full of liquor and the the thing that was concentrated designed for the worship of almighty God was being used for the worship of another God now I don't have message says this so you can take it or leave it but they say that belshazzar had switched the from the gods of Nebuchadnezzar and was worshiping a moon God whose name was sin I thought that was pretty fitting amen it was a moon God and they were worshiping and they believed that the powers of the gods that they were under were greater than the gods of Daniel who had prophesied there do you see what he's doing he's facing the end and mocking the one that prophesied he would be ended he was in the middle of it saying you there's no end coming there's no judgment coming amen somebody go get the vessels out of that false God's Temple that we took over and crushed go get them and let's drink and they were drinking from the cups now do y'all do y'all if you study the book of Jeremiah you'll find this very very interesting for the book of Jeremiah you'll find out that while they were actually drinking from these cups this is exactly when that a handwriting appears on the wall when you look at Jeremiah chapter 50 you're reading chapter verses 28-34 the Bible actually says amen that them that flee and Escape out of the land of Babylon to declare and design the Vengeance of the Lord Our God for the Vengeance of his Temple do you know in Jeremiah it is nearly 80 years or 90 before they drank out of these cups and the and the temple is being judged that God says through Jeremiah that when judgment comes to Babylon it'll be for the Vengeance of the Temple of the lord and there he sits with a cup in his hand and he's drinking from this now I I I don't have ability to set the scene but I want you to realize it's a modern America and in the middle of modern America in the middle of a rock and roll party Supernatural sign shows up on the wall and it says many tickle you Farson amen it's just a the Bible says I I think it's amazing I was trying to I was trying to picture this yesterday I was just trying to think what that King was thinking when the Bible said he actually saw a part of the hand as it wrote it on the wall can you imagine that God of Daniel can't get to me who who let him in here which one of you guards let him in here how did that hand get on that wall to even ride it because God's not subject to their rules or their orders he was involved whether they want him involved or not and he wrote he wrote right on the wall a supernatural now brother Randon when he said when this Supernatural comes he said the supernatural he said that's exactly how the Babylonian Kingdom went out the Gentile kingdom come in with Supernatural on the wall he said and that's how the Gentile kingdom is going to end the Gentile kingdom was the was the time that Daniel was living there it began and it began with Supernatural but the middle of that Supernatural was the ending of Babylon and that's exactly how the Gentile kingdoms Within is with the supernatural can can you think about this in the middle of Elvis Presley having a rock and roll concert Amen in Louisiana across the street from the Louisiana hayride was Jack Moore's Life Tabernacle where weam brandham the seventh star was being introduced to America through jack Moore's meetings and across the street was a Louisiana hay ride Elvis Presley was introducing the world to rock and roll they were both having a gathering one under rock and roll one under the word of God in the middle of the Rock and Roll Party the supernatural was being written on the wall I've literally been down the street Jack moris is on one side Louisiana Hy rides on the other side there's two stars being born Hollywood had a star but God had a star and one was going to lead us away from judgment and the other was leading thousands in the Judgment amen Elvis Presley amen you know what brother R said about him he said he was a judas's carer he said he had no business singing The Gospel of Jesus Christ amen he said he's a hypocrite he's a Judas scariot and he led a million Souls can you think about all the little girls tonight that is in hell because of that rock and roll boogie wogie music listen let me I I oh God I don't know what's wrong with me brother Ray but I tell you it's just the truth but the brother Ram said if you're unconverted he said that rock and roll will sound pretty good to you he said you can't help it these young people can't help it sounds pretty good to them but I think the Church of the Living God ought to be growed up a little bit past rock and roll I think it ought to be a shame if rock and roll is coming over our televisions and radios and whatever more in our homes and our little kids are hearing rock and roll cuz Mama and Daddy's doing well I'm preaching I might as well go ahead and preach and if anybody come to become the church tonight I'd appreciate an amen amen do you see what it is there's a rock and roll and now I know we was laughing about the other day me and my daughter be great she was talking about it she said dad I I understand countries bad he said she said when they play it people lose their dogs and they lose their homes and they lose their truck and they lose their parents and they lose their wife and they lose everything she said but you know when people play rock and roll they kill their mom and they kill their dad they burned their house amen it's just a it's just a greater advancement of the same thing now now I I don't have time to argue rock and roll if you want to have that argument we'll have it later but I can promise you I'm going to win if we take take the word if we take the word if we take modern arguments you can reason your way out of anything that's exactly what Eve did in the garden and look at the mess she ended up in so it's a good time to quit reasoning what what a prophet said and believe what a prophet said and if he said the thing will lead your soul to Hell it'll take you to Hell in a hand basket so it's time to get rid of it hello Church of the Living God it's time to have a house cleaning in the Church of God it's time to remember we are not just vessels we are Sanctified vessels of almighty god well my goodness amen do you see what it was it was a it was a it was a time of rock and roll it was a time when these things were happening they were drinking wine and they were Rock and rolling and brother R said the modern strip teasers was dancing I wish you was preaching brother R you see what it was you see the setting see what he's telling us the idea well we'll just go dance a little and have a little drink and brother BR is telling you that's exactly the state Babylon was in the day they got judged do you see what it was God had gave them a message an end is here God had gave them a prophet the end is here but they made fun of it the way people do today when you preach against rock and roll music the same way they do today sitting right in churches and they'll just kind of Snicker in the back of the mind with that old Crank That Old that old crank if he was a young guy he' enjoy well I was a young guy and I preached against it when I was 21 years old probably a little harder than I am this morning I've seasoned a little bit I'm trying to be nice but they they made fun of it do do you see that they made fun of it they made fun of what a prophet had to say about drinking and carousing and dancing and rock and roll they literally were looking at the destruction and the end of the world laughing at a prophet you said brother Wayne I'm not laughing at a prophet but the Bible says Jesus says your mouth is near me but your heart it's far from me do you see what happens is there has to be there has to be a realization of the modern America and what we're looking at there there is a reason and they're doing it but it's not scriptural see when this when this come on the wall the supernatural appears in this kind of a moment I just it just it just struck me it's happening at the same time and and now the Bible says when the supernatural comes that the king is shaken by it he he he he he's just he's just it's amazing to him that God would do something so Supernatural cuz what it done is it brought a reality that there was a God that maybe what Daniel said wasn't crazy maybe some of these things are true so when this appears on the wall he goes and gets all of his preachers and all of his susers and he says to them what does these things actually mean what does these mean now I I thought it was amazing that none of them understood what it really meant nobody could tell him what that meant what that writing was there they didn't understand the language they didn't know the handwriting they was not familiar with this words of the of the one they were dealing with so they asked everybody nobody knew nobody knew how to take care of it but brother ramam says but watch the scripture says there was a woman who was a queen who lived in that day which was the mother of Bel chazar and they brought her in brother B said notice she wasn't in the party hey she she wasn't in the party she remembered from the days of Daniel when they brought her in and she looked at the writing she says listen now there is a man that's in the Kingdom that was in the kingdom in the days of their father Nebuchadnezzar who who would be able to solve problems like this and he's here and there's a man here that can dissolve the doubts I think it's written in two places in verse 10 and verse 12 that she said there's a man here that can dissolve Z when brother bam comes to this point you would think that he would say he was the man that could dissolve the doubts brother Bram pushed that away he said see there is a man in the Kingdom he said but the man in the kingdom is Jesus Christ he said there is a man in the Kingdom today see he was standing in the Pentecostal Kingdom and he was looking at the end of the Pentecostal age and he was saying to him there's a man here right now in the Kingdom who can dissolve the doubts he can answer the questions he can tell you what the Supernatural is about what does all these things mean man has no clue what they mean but God is able to dissolve the doubts Amen Let me let me just say this I believe that brother Brandon was saying something very clear to us Isaiah 60 says that there was Darkness amen upon the Earth and gross Darkness on the people but at the same time the Bible said unto the children of God arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee in the same hour of darkness when the great light of understanding and reality in the same hour those were the same words but they meant something totally different to two types of people it took the one who could understand it to dissolve the doubts of what the real meaning of it is what is the real meaning of the message what is the real meaning I I think it's powerful what's the meaning of all the angels that were seen appearing through the 1940s and 1950s listen I I I I know some of you sitting here maybe don't realize this but the Angels were appearing to a lot more than brother randam am me not not in Ministry wise but Angels were coming to people all over the country I right within my family my grandmother had a angel come standing at the end of her bed two or three nights in a row in different periods of her life it was an Ang would literally come in and stand amen just right in front of things my dad amen had these experiences as a little boy back in the early 50s when he he'd be in a rocking chair he said wake up and it' be somebody sitting there in the rocking chair watching him sleep amen he he couldn't hardly sleep as a little boy people all over the country why was all these Ministries springing up why was with the miracle men who wasn't even good men were seeing great miracles in their lives and Revival fires Were Striking amen UFOs were being spotted everywhere people used to make fun of UFOs Air Force is now releasing videos and proof that a Air Force has being seing UFOs for years UFO unidentified flying objects amen amen what what do they mean what do they mean well it took a prophet amen but the prophet stood there and said there's a man that can tell us what it is is same thing in Genesis the 6th chapter when the two angels went down to Sodom brother B said there was an investigating judgment going on at that time and God was sending Watchers Out of Heaven to investigate what was going on on the earth look Church they're not unidentified fine objects they're Angels who are there to look at the Earth and see the condition it's in for the Bible said amen when the cup of the Amorite of the iniquity has become full that there would be a Deliverance for the Seed of Abraham and God has got angels watching those cups because there's a Deliverance that is coming on the Church of the Living God just like his angels were watching that night in Babylon Daniel was a prisoner Hebrew children were a prisoner thousands of Israelites were prisoners in Babylon and while they were reeling in their party God sent a supernatural sign on the wall it meant judgment to one but it meant Deliverance to another my when I think about it this morning I think about the grace of God when that appears that Queen said there is a dissolver of doubts there's one that can dissolve your doubts brother man said if you're having doubts about this message he said come up to the Altar and ask the Holy Spirit about it heal his arm your doubts if there's a spirit of doubt I preached a youth meeting one year in Edmonton and titled it the dissolver of doubts I didn't realize it but right then there was a there was a big critic that rose up in that area against the message and one of their youth leaders had fell under it and become a Judas and was trying to pull the young people out of the church pull them away from the message of the hour and God sent me in there right at that time and I preached a message the dissolver of doubts I didn't understand why I was preaching it at that moment but I knew I was supposed to be preaching it and while I was preaching that dissolver doubts I begin to invite the children won't you just come and have an experience with somebody who can tell you if it's right don't ask me if it's right don't ask a preacher if it's right don't ask another man if it's right there's one that knows this message is right and it's the god that sent it and if you'll get in the presence of the Angel of the Lord he will confirm to you this is the word in heaven he but in heaven they're not questioning this message they're not questioning brother rand's teachings in heaven matter of fact brother random went up there and they said brother random we're resting on what you taught Heaven's resting on it amen how much greater can we today put our rest and our hope and our strength in this message that we begin to believe let it Search Your Heart let the message Search Your Heart kill every doubt kill every feeling don't let that devil amen destroy you I know there's a lot of gainsayers there's a lot of critics we were talking at the house the other day and I told told the kids I said I'll tell you this amen I've studied a lot of preachers I've studied a lot of sermons I've read a lot of books I've watched a lot of videos I've seen brother Bam's contemporaries I've heard their tricks I've seen their shamsters I've seen all the nonsense they done amen but but honestly what did William brandom ever do but but exalt Jesus Christ honestly from your heart you you answer that to me what did Brother brandom ever do but exalt Jesus Christ if you want to prove Jesus Christ is alive right now you take any other Ministry and prove it for me but if you'll allow me to use this message I will give you physical evidence that Jesus Christ is not in the Tomb over there in Israel he is alive and he's the same yesterday today and forever he is the almighty God we're not here talking about a man named William brandom we're talking about Jesus Christ the son of God who has rose up from from the dead and is hearing power and authority and Glory you talk about safety I'm not building a bomb shelter I'm not setting up AA Allen or no alcoholics synomous either amen that there is some feathers oh God there's some feathers Amen brother brother in Psalms 91 he said we could hide amen we could hide God will hide you under the feathers and the shadow of the Almighty I believe there's a secret place don't you come on I can't I can't pull off the fact that judgment Struck it William brandom said it did Amen in 1965 he threw up a rock he said judgment has struck the west coast and earthquakes earthquakes begin to release on that West Coast that ain't stopped yet they ain't stopped yet it almost suck Alaska but there's vibrations running in the earth amen that one of those vibrations one of these days will hit the right moment and when the angels look upon the Earth and said that's the finish of it we're done with it La is going to sink friends it's going to go under the ocean and right there in that place of judgment they're producing movies and they're producing filth and they're producing everything amen but what is it God has already predicted what would happen in it but when judgment Begin to Fall amen there was something that was given to the church that she would be able to to be delivered this writing was written was me manyi tickle e Farson and Daniel himself when he comes into the room to interpret it I thought it was pretty amazing because Daniel don't just go in there interpret it he gives that King a rebuke go read it serious a serious rebuke he tells him that this kingdom is falling because of the same sin nebuchad Nezar had committed and had been seven years in the wilderness for it and he told him he said look at this he said to him he said look King you knew what happened to Nebuchadnezzar you know what happened you that was your granddaddy you know what happened to him when he revolted against God you know what happened to that man but yet you do this anyhow you you you act like this knowing you know what happened then and you acting like it ain't going to happen now come on Church come on now that adultery Spirit ruined other men it'll ruin you that alcohol ruined others it'll ruin you tobacco ruined others it'll ruin you you know what it does amen I think it's high time that we quit being arrogant and start repenting and saying Lord I'm sorry that I thought that way or felt that way cuz what it really meant many many TI you fars and what it really meant put it in simple language it meant you in trouble you're in real trouble you in the kind of big trouble you can't get out of trouble you in trouble this Prophet looks at him and says this is the interpretation of the thing meaning meaning God hath numbered thy kingdom it's finished it's finished you think about that when God says it's finished it's finished he said it's finished when God pronounces something as finished it's finished it's fulfilled it's time it's amazing when you read Revelations the 10th chapter isn't it when a mighty Angel comes down out of heaven he has his hands lifted and his announcement is time will be no more what's this message mean anyhow it's finished according to Daniel 12 the book is open at the end time according to scripture the seventh angel is the last Angel to the to the church ages it means it's finished brother B said the seven seal means the end the end of struggling nature the end what what's it the end of brother Wayne I tell you in the church AG book can I can I have some Liberty here on Church AG book in the church AG book he thinks well you done took a bunch of Liberty brother Wayne Uh in in the church age book brother brandham actually says this and I I sometimes I I just want to put in a little plug for brother Bram cuz I get so tired of people uh uh uh attacking the the the grace of God God that was sent through him but brother br will say in the church's book he said I predict and do not prophesy that the World Systems will end 1977 he said I say this by divine inspiration so people went around and brother Bram says I predict I do not prophesy do not go say brother brandham said but they did they went and said and he didn't say so what made it appear brother brandham had falsely said said well he said it by divine inspiration he did he had Divine inspired dreams seven of them or visions and he said according to those I don't see how it could go past you see brother Wayne did something end it did World Systems did end if you read in the church age Book World Systems are denominational ages according to the breach amen used to be page 74 I don't know what the page is now but according to breach page 74 brother Bram said when the book is open denominational ages are ended he said what God is doing now is revealing what they left out you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying it's finished I'm saying Church government is finished I'm saying the shuck carried the life for a period but it's finished the seed and the Shu have now separated judgment has fell upon the Shu amen it's being gathered in the Garner for the burning amen the harvesting angels have come upon the Earth and they're Gathering the Church of the Living God and denomination is bundling the rest of it together it's finished and we could preach a while on that it's it's finished amen what is it it's finished and the interpretation means Thou Art weighed in a balance and found warning other words God's word on one side and you on the other side and you don't weigh enough be the first time we were told we didn't weigh enough huh you can't meet the balance but if you see what's on the other side you'll understand why you can't meet the balance because people say well brother way I'm a good man I do good works I go to church I do this I do this and do this and they give you all these works and you put all them works on one side and you put Jesus on the other side and you still don't weigh enough because you're never going to weigh enough on those scales you know what those scales say be ye perfect even as my Father in Heaven which is perfect only Perfection will weigh out on those scales and brother BR said how are you going to be a perfect people be married to a perfect bridegroom and live in a perfect place except for the perfect word so he's telling you the only way to weigh on these scales of judgment is this message is going to have to come into you this perfect word's going to have to live not as a Doctrine but as a life it's got to come into the church because because the church the world has been found warning amen and it doesn't weigh enough and thy kingdom is then divided and given unto the mes and the Persians right then right at that very hour there was something going on Babylon had been built into the standard of like the Garden of Eden and it was a city where the palace was in the center and a river run underneath those 200 foot high walls that was a river run under those 80 foot thick walls and it was an exceptionally dry season that year and the Persians while they had besieged had secretly been out there digging a deter for that River to empty the channel that they could go under that wall so when when he looked out when Bel chazar looked out and said well they're all gone they've left the city they've run because of the Great and Mighty Babylon that wasn't what had happened they had went down into the riverbeds and they couldn't be seen and that night he went through a party to rejoice that they're all gone and while he was partying a supernatural sign said judgment has come Daniel had said your kingdom is leaving you in that same hour Persia come under them 80 foot thick walls and came straight to the Palace the Bible records that this man was killed that very night amen it wasn't a long time coming he was killed that very night but you know something that was powerful about this story the moment the Babylonian kingdom was killed amen it changed kingdoms same city same same setup same building same people everywhere but the kingdom had changed the authority had changed the dispensations had changed there had come an end to one and the beginning of another do you know what had happened Darius had been made King who was a me and he had a buddy who he was partners with was a Persian who was named was Cyrus have you ever read about King Cyrus King Cyrus had been predicted in Isaiah it was 600 years or 400 years before the fall of Babylon that that Isaiah prophesied that there would be Isaiah 45 exactly there would be a man whose name was Sirius who would come into the kingdom of Babylon and who would take over the gates of that Kingdom and would deliver the children of God can you imagine that God predict a deliverer who was a gentile who didn't even know God and say I'm going to send him in there and he's going to deliver you and not only will he deliver you he'll rebuild your temple he'll give you your Liberty he'll help you get back to your land your Exile days are over he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying when the supernatural appeared on the wall to one Kingdom it was a finish to one Kingdom it was an end it was a destruction it was the end of the system but to the other Kingdom it was the dawning of a new day the opening of The Seven Seals was not the end of the Bride it was the beginning of a bride age it was the beginning of a dispensation where the word of God was going to rule over the Church of God Amen we are not going into darkness but we have come out of dark Le oia and we have moved into the rising of the sun there has been another government issued upon the Church of the Living God I think about it this morning and I think about the ends of systems I think about the end of denomination I think about the end of the shock I think about the end of it it happened down there with Moses in the Bible when he went into Goan amen what was it his coming his Supernatural was the end to Pharaoh but it wasn't the end to the children of Israel it was the dawning of a new day the promise had come unto them the deliverer had come to their house I believe this morning church amen that this message of judgment is not a judgment upon the bride it's a judgment upon the world I believe the Supernatural means the world has come under judgment but the Church of the Living God has moved into a Rapture cycle where the anointing of God is upon their life we are at the place we're at the place Israel was when they returned back to their Homeland when they went back to rebuild the Temple when they went back to go back to the order of their worship you know what they had done sister terar when they went into captivity they had went by the willow trees and they had hung up their hearts and they went into captivity and them Hearts have been hanging there for 70 years amen but now that the supernatural sign had come they could turn around and they could go back and pick them Harps up on their way back home listen I believe that the hour of worship has come to the bride of Christ I I believe the Bible said when the book was opened up amen the Bible said they heard me John shouting they heard me on the earth and they heard me in the heaven and they heard me under the Earth what does the supernatural mean it means a day of worship for the Church of the Living God not worshiping under a Pentecostal Feast worshiping under amen the Feast of Tabernacles of the sons of the Living God adoption time Rapture time Holy Ghost time what does it all mean look up there amen Cloud appears in the sky 1963 Luke magazine picks it up Life Magazine picks it up what what does it mean what does it mean judgment what does it mean it means an End Amen but what does it mean to the bride brother B said it's our Lord up there it means divine Vindication supreme authority has return to the church we're not under the bondage of an idea of denomination this morning we have been released in the power of the Holy Ghost my Lord what is happening is God is begin to tell us the meaning the meaning of the supernatural what is the meaning the meaning is the meaning is Matthew 24 whereever the carcass is there the Eagles are gather together amen what's them Eagles gathering on Fresh Mana it means fresh food is come it means Grace has come it means the power of Salvation is come listen to me this morning young people this is not coming you're in the middle of it it's not on its way you're in the hour of it brother br said this and I I thought I'd shout out of my bedroom this morning when I read this he said listen he said he said Russia's got them bombs ready now he said they're setting ready now what destroys the world is in the hands of sinful men he said before mourning he said America could be in craters he said but let me assure you that the bride will be in glory before that I said oh glory be to God it means bonds are going to fall on Russia but the bride will be set in glory can can I tell you what my part is that's not false hope that's not false security that is the eagle anointing we have received the message church we have brought free we have come out we have set ourselves under the power and the authority of almighty God we're not here this morning under the bondage of man we have the liberty of God Upon Our Lives some of you have come through it I know you have amen every every little thing every little situation you have to approv through man believe we've come under another headship we've come under an adoption age of the church what does it mean where the carcass is there the Eagles will gather what does it mean the day when the son of man shall be revealed when Christ shall come into the church as the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ can I say it to you this morning open up oh ye gates and let the king of glory come into your heart let the power of God drop into your life is what it means what it means is it's available what it means what the supernatural means is the days of waiting are over seal it up John Till the seventh angel sounds we've had the seventh angel now can I preach the Thunders now can I preach the seals now can I preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost now can I preach predestination now amen listen I know there's a whole bunch of places you can't do it but we happen to be in a church that you you can't preach it too hard you can't preach it too simple you can't preach it too deep because they're the bride Church of almighty God where the word has come to stimulate power and authority amen listen I I'm saying the wait is over I'm saying it's finished I'm saying Revival has come I'm saying that we're not looking for Revival I'm saying we are Revival I'm not saying we're looking for Rapture I'm saying we are rapture we're not looking for a group of young people to raise up in power there is a group on the earth I tell you what I'm saying I'm saying that if you ever wanted to shout It's Shouting Time if you ever wanted to Rejoice it's rejoicing time I walked out of my house this morning the devil hitting me from every corner you can't you can't preach it like that and somebody might overreact and somebody's going to get upset and something's going to happen like that by the time I got to my car I said shut up devil I ain't taking you to church with me I let alone ain't taking you the pull pit with me amen if there is somebody in the house of God that wants to Rejoice I think it's time to kick the devil off your back and rejoice in the name of God lift up your heavy hands and remember what joy and Liberty and freedom feels like remember the grace of God that's been put in your life you remember when you used to feel the power come on you and you want to talk with other tongues this is the age to do it just go ahead and let let God do something in your life so brother Wayne it's all finished no you telling me it's finished is finished you can't act like that in the house of God that's finished for me you you you can't exercise the gifts of God listen if it's God's gifts why can't we well brother Wayne there's an order and whoever did you see get out of order with it anyhow you ain't seen nobody get out of order with it but but we welcome it we welcome the return of the pillar of fire we welcome we throw the doors open let the pillar of fire swirl in this meeting let it deliver our young people let the power of God we don't want to make fun of the moving of the Holy Ghost we don't want to make fun of the power of God that's finished that's over it's in another age this is not just a bunch of Pentecostal bubble dancing this is people who know who they are they know where they come from they believe a doctr of Truth they believe a message of the hour listen to me if the Pentecostals can shout on a guitar and a drum how much more should the Church of the Living God begin to Rejoice over the opening of Seven Seals and the power of a Redemptive book the supernatural has struck the church with authority and power it's time to say devil I'm finished with it I remember when you used to shout before you got critical I remember before the devil started talking to you amen got you all tied up looking over there at that guy looking over with that girl I remember when it was free on you amen I think it ought to be free again I think you ought to kick that devil to the curb this morning and say I'm not going to spend another hour sitting in church with an old critical spirit on me I'm going to throw that thing down this morning and rejoice in the power of God [Applause] I'm not out of the scripture brother man said it meant victory in the house of God you said I don't like that dancing we'll get a little Victory and you'll feel so much better about [Music] it what's it mean brother Wayne the devil is finished that's what it means the meaning of this writing the devil's done he's in trouble but it means something else it means the latter Glory has begun it means there's a latter Glory coming in the church amen what they had in the beginning and what they would have at the end would come together and at that Supernatural sign the god that visited Israel to begin with was leading them back to worship as Israelites and the church for the first time in the history of the world Amen the book has come open I I I don't know if I could be I don't have the the language to say the importance of that brother brother Daryl there's been millions of people on that book but we're the first people who know our names on that book we're not worshiping and shouting and rejoicing over a good feeling our our Rejoice is deeper than that our feeling is greater than that we are looking at the the Lamb's Book of Life and we can't be taken out of it all the rock and roll parties will never get you all the Devils will never get you you're sealed in with the token of the Holy Ghost what is going on a lad glory is falling a ladder Glory the former and the latter shall fall together it's a harvest rain it's an anointed word that's coming upon the church rapturing Faith it's the flatter Glory it's not just a bunch of a bunch of hoodoo coming in the in the I want to ask sometime makes me want to ask somebody if now not if now if not now then you tell me when if if it's not now you you you you get a mic and stand by me and tell me when it will happen you tell me when there'll never be ever be people who are more committed to a message than there is right now you tell me where you're going to find young people like we've got right now in history or in the future I believe this is a season I believe we're in the hour I believe the power of God has dropped upon the church Sirius was coming to deliver there's a king here greater than Sirius this morning the Bible said the Lord himself would descend from heaven Christ has come as a deliverer to the church if it's not now when is it if it's not now when is it brother visited our our a youth camp over here one of them left it said one of the church members looked over him and said man that's like a Revival he said I've been trying to tell you we in the bride's Revival I've been trying to tell you if you're not shouting it's not God's fault if you're not in Revival it's not God's fault if you're not enjoying the season you're living in you come on you're like a person you took to a steak restaurant and they ordered french fries if you're not enjoying it it's not their fault I've been to I've been to the Rock and dating with Brother David it's a little bit of expensive place to go he looks at me he says have whatever you want well if I don't who's fault is it payments there well I'll be humble really is that really what he wanted does he want me to take the cheapest thing did he take me all the way over to that restaurant to buy me a steak to make sure I didn't get what I wanted he took me there because he wanted me to have something and he wanted to give me something are you hearing me God brought you here cuz he wants to give you something God ain't God ain't want you Amen to say well I better not take that because it's just too much and I'm not worthy and it won't be God's brought you to the bride's Revival the final push of the Rapture is upon the church it's a time and a season like none you've ever lived in I'll tell you the hour for it Church the supernatural's on the wall the signs have been seen amen the world is in rock and roll parties with its alcohol but the Church of the Living God they're feeling the power of the theophany of God pulling what you've been looking for what you've been praying for sister themma can witness it right here she's been in this message for years and she's standing there saying to you you young people look at her she's an elder she's been through movements she was looking for the Dynamics she was searching for here she's standing there saying the Dynamics is here you're hearing a preacher say it there's an elder say it there's an elder say it people who have lived in the days you're looking at says this day is greater than all the other days that you've ever lived this is the hour to do it this is the hour to say it my what a time to live what an hour to be in the grace of God Amen brother man would you come what an hour what a time what a blessing what does it mean according to who you are it matters who you are what it means some people only see Doom and Gloom well if you're of the wrong race that's all it means but if you're of that bride seed it means there is a Deliverance descended upon the Earth like none has ever been a delivering power an angel Sent From Heaven to break the chains and the confinements of Babylon to release a people like the gy Liberty chains are gone dispensations are broken free brother you want me to shout like you do no I want you to be free I want you to be free I've heard people shout to the roof come off and not an ounce of power in the building we're not looking for a shout we're looking for the power of God that comes under its Liberty of the anointing and that's exactly what we're feeling in here this morning not just loud there's a power in it there's an anointing behind it there's enough in here this morning to deliver to set free to give you Mercy you said brother Wayne what I got to do I tell you what you need to do you just need to drop all your reasoning drop all your argument with the message and just accept it as king accept it as king and you'll be invited to his table y'all stand with me this morning what a day what an hour to live the dispensation that we have been given there's no day like it friends we're not going to rebuild a tabernacle we're going to heaven our Tabernacle has already been built we got a mansion so brother Wayne when's that theophany when's it well I'm of one that believes that's what's pulling on you now I'm I I believe that's what's pulling at you right now I believe when you heard the message and you said amen to it brother B said you heard you heard from your theophany something urging you this morning what an hour supernatural's on the wall friends if you got the right seed it's it's your deliverance it's not your judgment one day a lady from the church down Arkansas good family of mine she's had utmost respect and been a blessing to me for years
